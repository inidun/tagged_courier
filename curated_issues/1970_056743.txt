'Big cat' of Stone-age Cyprus
This animal head, probably of a lion or panther, was hewn from basalt rock by a Stone-age
craftsman in Cyprus, almost 8,000 years ago when these fierce members of the cat family
roamed the island. A mere 11 cm (4 in.) long, it was unearthed at Khirokitia from the remains
of one of the early Neolithic villages brought to light by recent excavations. The inhabitants
of these settlements were farmers and hunters, but they also numbered craftsmen skilled
in working stone, fashioning bowls, dishes and tools as well as necklaces and amulets.

International co-operation for
development over the last 20 years
has been of a nature and on a scale
new to history. Yet massive
aid and vast efforts by the
developing countries have failed
to close the gap between the
industrial nations and the rest of the
world. What new global strategy
could close this gap and how soon?
These are the questions examined
in one of the most important
studies on development produced
in recent years the Pearson Report.
Our cover artist, Rolf Ibach,
has sought to symbolize the
intercontinental facets of this world
problem, certainly one of the central
issues of our time.

THE
PEARSON
REPORT
This issue is devoted in major part to what has already come to be known
as the "Pearson Report", the most comprehensive analysis to date of economic
development. Entitled "Partners in Development", the report proposes a new
basis for international co-operation and spells out the responsibilities of both
donor and recipient countries. Its proposals represent a far-reaching pro¬
gramme of action, a new global strategy that can transform the present aid
framework into one that fits the changing needs of the developing world
in the next two decades.
Two years ago, the crisis of confidence in the effectiveness of develop¬
ment aid led George Woods, then President of the World Bank, to suggest
a "grand assize" in which an international group "of stature and experience
would meet together, study the consequences of twenty years of develop¬
ment assistance, assess the results, clarify the errors and propose the policies
that will work better in the future."
In August 1968, the new President of the World Bank, Roberts. McNamara,
asked Lester B. Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada and Nobel Peace
Prize winner, to form a Commission to undertake such a study. Three months
later, the Commission on International Development held its first meeting
in Mont Gabriel, Canada.
With Lester Pearson as its chairman, it comprised seven prominent inter¬
national figures: Sir Edward Boyle (U.K.), Roberto de Oliveira Campos
(Brazil), C. Douglas Dillon (U.S.), Wilfried Guth (Fed. Rep. of Germany),
Sir Arthur Lewis (Jamaica), Robert E. Marjolin (France), and Saburo Okita
(Japan). After 11 months of intensive investigations, including meetings
in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East at which some 70 govern¬
ments presented their views, the Commission drew up its findings and
recommendations in a 400-page report which has now been published (For
prices and other details see inside back cover).
The text below is the address Lester Pearson delivered in Washington
several weeks ago before the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, in which he summarized the major findings of this far-reaching study.
Other articles in this issue present excepts and summaries of the conclusions
and proposals in the Pearson Report.

LESTER B. PEARSON. Prime Minister of
Canada from 1963 to 1968, was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1957. Statesman and
diplomat, he was an adviser to the 1945 San
Francisco Conference that drew up the U.N.
Charter. He also shared In planning that led
to the creation of the Food and Agriculture
Organization and of UNRRA, which helped to
restore the economies of war-ravaged coun¬
tries and cared for displaced persons. He
led successive delegations to the U.N. Gen¬
eral Assembly, of which he was president In
1952-53, and took a leading part in most of
the historic International events of the time.
In 1960, he became International executive
chairman of the Council on World Tensions.
His books Include 'Democracy in World Poli¬
tics" (1955), "Diplomacy In the Nuclear Age"
(1959), "Peace in the Family of Man" (1968).
Nlot only is the question of
development difficult and complex in
itself ; but we have been examining it
during a tense and difficult period in
human affairs. The tone of the times
is doubtful and discordant. A decade
which began with the all but total
liquidation of the old colonial order
has ended with man walking on the
moon.
Goals reached often serve only to
illuminate the long, dangerous road
ahead. The absence of war has not
brought peace, but an uneasy twilight
zone darkened by the shadow of total
destruction. Concern for the rights
and dignity and freedom of all men
has not only sharpened conflict over
how to protect these essential values
but has revealed that there are multi¬
tudes who still do not enjoy them.
The implausible speed of techno¬
logical change has exposed and ren¬
dered less tolerable the glacial pace of
social transformation. Unprecedented
economic progress in many areas has

thrown into sharp relief the depriva¬
tions and flagging hopes of the less
fortunate.
The circumstances in which the
developing nations have tried to
modernize their societies present new
and unprecedented obstacles to the
effort. The results they have achieved
can only be properly analyzed and
appreciated against the background of
these obstacles.
Development is an ancient concept
but one which, in our modern age,
has acquired new meaning and pur¬
pose. Its pursuit unites two strands
of human thought : the belief in pro¬
gress and the conviction that man
can master his destiny.
The roots of modern progress reach
back to the origin of human civilization,
but its acceleration since the industrial
revolution has had an uneven impact
and has created serious strains. This
is true inside the industrialized
countries themselves where whole
regions are left behind in the surge
of rising prosperity. Above all, it has
produced a wide gap between the
industrialized countries and the rest
of the world.
In an attempt to bridge this gap and
to repair centuries of neglect and
stagnation, nations untouched by the
technological revolution have mobilized
their resources while the international
community has helped in an unprec¬
edented manner by a massive transfer
of resources.
It is the nature of international co¬
operation for development that it
should have a tentative, groping
quality. These are largely uncharted
areas, and the costs of exploration
are as high as the results are uncertain.
Some social and economic enterprises,
often experimental, will yield high
returns; others will not, and will be
pushed aside by more promising
endeavours.
It was not the task of our commis¬
sion to go into all the ramifications
of the development process; but rather
to enquire whether the international
co-operative effort, derived from this
new feeling of commitment, and dedica¬
ted to promoting the growth of low-
income areas, warrants continued
heavy expenditures of energy and
resources on the part of the richer,
developed countries; and, if so, how
the effort can be strengthened and
improved by steps on both sides.
E are convinced that co¬
operation for development is not only
practicable but is of essential im¬
portance. Our study of the experience
of the last two decades has confirmed
that belief. The flow of public and
private resources from developed to
developing countries, with the results
achieved, represents an example of
foresight too rarely in evidence in
world affairs. It would be tragic if we
now turned our backs on this effort.
Nevertheless, doubts and fears now
afflict the development effort. Too
often, particularly in the larger donor
countries, the prevalent attitude is one
of weariness, disillusion, and even
rejection. Recipient countries also
have increasing doubts about some
aspects of foreign assistance, which
makes development co-operation more
difficult. Too many in both developed
and developing countries are becoming
cynical, not only about the effective¬
ness of the aid effort, but about the
the validity of the very concept of aid.
Because some donor countries have
attempted to seek political influence
or direct economic gain from aid. sens¬
itive leaders in governments of some
developing countries see in such
policies even if they are designated
"aid" a form of neo-colonial inter¬
vention ; not an expression of genuine
international co-operation, or an
authentic expression of international
interdépendance or human solidarity.
In some donor countries, there is
growing opposition or indifference to
aid for development as costly, waste¬
ful, ineffective and unnecessary. We
try to deal with these objections in
our report.
There are others, however, who
would wholeheartedly support a
genuine policy of co-operation and aid
for development, who do not find this
in the current aid policies of some
developed countries which they feel
to be too closely linked with narrow
political and commercial interests of
the donor; or as something too closely
tied to a wrong foreign policy.
The fact is that we are reaching
a point of decision, even of crisis,
in the history of this novel and
noble adventure in international co¬
operation.
To cope with it, we must face up
to, and try to answer, the basic
question: why should countries, strong
and affluent it is true, but beset by

Saburo Okita
(Japan)

(France)
many agonizingly complex domestic,
economic and social problems, be
concerned to do anything about the
plight of the poor countries? In short:
why aid at all?
The first response to this question
is, of course, the moral one. Every
accepted system of values in the
world proclaims the duty of the rich
and the privileged to help the poor
and the deprived.
Every religion, every article of
humanistic faith, reminds the fortunate
of the responsibility which attends
good fortune. The growth and spread
of civilization, the building of the
communities which we have come to
call nations, the common rule of indiv¬
idual and national behaviour which
makes possible our continued exist¬
ence in a nuclear age, all these re¬
inforce the proposition that it is the
duty of those who have resources and
skills to share them with those who
have not.
This is a deep and durable reason
for support of development and for
development aid. Too often, in our
day-to-day struggle for national or per¬
sonal interest, we forget the simple
power of this instinct; even though
we know how dehumanizing the con¬
sequences would be if we were ever
finally to ignore it. However, humanita¬
rian and moral concern for others does
not by any means exhaust the case
for aid.
Of equal to some people of greater
importance are the requirements,
indeed the compulsions , of an in¬
creasingly close and interdependent
world community. These requirements
do not dismiss national interest as the
basis of policy but they insist that it
must include considerations that are
extra-national.
National self-interest is a rational
basis for policy in aid and anything
else but only if it is enlightened and
farsighted and looks beyond its own
boundaries.
The establishment of a good econo¬
mic and political relationship through
co-operation for development is a
worthy objective and could be a re¬
warding one. Certainly there will be
more development and progress in the
richer industrialized countries if the
poorer countries with two-thirds of the
world's population can develop.
IHE reverse is also true. It
becomes more apparent with every
passing day that the interests of each
nation and each man are inseparable
from those of all others. It is now
almost without reason to ask where
one nation will be twenty-five years
from now without at the same time
asking where the world will be.
The revolution in transportation, in
communications, in production meth¬
ods, and in so many other aspects
of life and society has ended forever
the day when individual countries can
gain lasting advantage through the
defeat or decay of their neighbours.
Recognition of these facts has led
to a new concept of national self-
interest, which is not the less impres¬
sive because it is so often honoured
in the breach. Basically, it asserts that
the paramount, long-term interest of
all nations, rich and poor, is in the
creation of a world in which all the
world's resources, human and physical,
are put to the greatest possible use.
This is the vision which should in¬
spire all who look beyond the anxieties
of today to the opportunities of to¬
morrow.
We have learned in the last twenty
years that this vision can only be
realized if the wealthy countries join
in a sustained effort to help the de¬
veloping countries to help themselves.
We no longer ask why rich people
or rich regions of our homeland are
to be taxed to help reduce and remove
poverty in underdeveloped areas. We
recognize such commitments as the
natural obligations of community. The
time has come for a similar national
commitment of assistance to those
developing countries who are them¬
selves willing and able to expend the
effort necessary to achieve the eco¬
nomic and social progress which the
new technology now makes possible.
Let us be in no doubt about the
intention of these developing countries.
For them, development is no longer
an option; it is an imperative. They
do not intend to slumber for more cen¬
turies. Development is part of their
unfinished revolution: another stage in
their struggle for freedom.
The question is not whether develop¬
ment will happen. It will. Rather, the
choice is between slow, halting growth
in an environment of desperation with
declining levels of assistance and em¬
bittered international relations, or
growth as part of a positive, concerted
campaign to accelerate and smooth the
absorption of the technological revolu¬
tion in the poorer countries, with a
reasonable chance that the spirit of
shared concern and effort will reduce
the frictions and the dangers, and
facilitate and expedite positive results.
If the developing countries have no
choice, developed countries have. But
do they realize how a choice for dis¬
engagement would affect their own "7
societies? /

ed societies of the world. It shapes
and informs the values by which these
societies govern themselves.
Can the denial of these rights in
the economic and social sphere which
is what we are now dealing with to
two-thirds of the people of the world
be ignored without damage to the prin¬
ciple and interests of the fortunate
few? I think not.
If the rich and the strong of this
world were to succeed in ignoring the
weak and the poor, they would do
well to examine what they themselves
had become.
The division, the disparity, the gap,
between the two worlds is widening
and becoming more critical. From this,
tragic conclusions are drawn and
frightening results are predicted. Of
course, comparative statistics can often
make the situation worse than it is,
and give a misleading impression.
It does not make sense, for instance,
to suggest that a ratio of 15 to 1 in
the "per capita" income of two
countries means that the citizens of
one country are living fifteen times as
well as those of the other. There is
much more to the quality of life than
a rising income.
I realize that governments and citi¬
zens feel a special responsibility to¬
ward their countrymen. But the world
is now too small to confine that res¬
ponsibility within national boundaries.
If the nation-state cannot meet this
test, if it cannot co-operate with other
states to ensure certain basic social and
economic conditions as the minimum
entitlement of all men, it may dis¬
appear and it will deserve to do so.
Humanity is quite ruthless in dealing
with social and political forms and
institutions which have outlived their
usefulness.
These are not new truths. We have
recognized them for years and have
accepted, in principle, their implica¬
tions. Indeed, there has been nothing
more encouraging since the end of the
last war, than the growing acceptance
of a commitment to help in this historic
task of world development. Are we
to abandon it now?
It could be for the evidence grows
that there is a weakening of the poli¬
tical will to carry on with the commit¬
ment in some, including the richest,
of the developed countries. Some rea¬
sons for this weariness and weakness
of will I have mentioned. Others stem
from expecting too much too soon;
from forgetting there is no such thing
as instant development.
Still others are traceable to wrong
impressions of how much aid has been
provided for development, as distinct
from shorter term political and military
objectives. It is no more sensible to
criticize aid provided in support of
immediate political or military goals on
the grounds that it has not resulted
in development than it is to criticize
shipments of instruments of war for
the same failure.
To these things must be added a
great misunderstanding about what
has, in fact, happened in developing
countries; about what has been achiev¬
ed and what can be achieved in the
future if there is the will to sustain

.CONOMIC statistics alone
do not give a true comparison between
the living standards and satisfactions
of a tenant in a high-rise housing
development in a packed and polluted
megalopolis and those of a village
in sunny Ceylon.
Nevertheless, after making all these
allowances, it is a frightening prospect,
and could be a tragic one, if a small
minority of the nations of the world
march into the space age, exploiting its
potential and at least having the oppor¬
tunity of solving its problems, while the
great majority are denied entrance to
this new world or find such entrance
intolerably delayed.
Of course, none of this argues that
we must now have or should have,
world government and that the nation-
state should disappear. On the con¬
trary, it is clear that the nation-state
has particularly vital functions at this
juncture in history.
What it does mean is that there
must be a great concern in all nations
for the fate of all other nations, and
that this must reflect itself in more
effective co-operation, including co¬
operation for development.

the development effort. Look at the
record of growth in Gross National
Product. This is not by any means a
complete measure, for development is
much more than G.N. P. As Gunnar
Myrdal says, "development is the
movement of the whole social system
upwards".
But figures for G.N. P. do indicate the
progress which has been made. The
average annual rate of G.N. P. for all
developing countries between 1950 and
1968 has been a remarkable 4.8 per
cent. Taking the 1960s alone it now
appears that the United Nations
development target of five per cent
per year will be met.
Even if we take income per head,
the record is still historically impres¬
sive. Some forty-one developing
countries have, since 1955, managed
average growth in income "per capita"
of two per cent or more for a ten-year
period. This is roughly what the
developed countries of Western Europe
and North America achieved in the
century starting in 1850.
It is even more encouraging that
these forty-one countries, about a third
of all the developing countries, are
not confined to any geographical area,
topography, race, religion, or popula¬
tion size. They are equally divided bet¬
ween Africa, Latin America and Asia,
and they include some of the largest
countries as well as some of the
smallest.
I do not claim, of course, that this
achievement can simply be laid at the
door of foreign aid and technical assis¬
tance. Of course not. At least 85 per
cent of the whole investment effort has
been achieved by the developing
people themselves. Aid in capital and
expertise has often been a catalyst
of local action. As a source of scarce
foreign exchange, it has frequently
been indispensable.
But the hard grinding work and
saving that underlie development, par¬
ticularly in countries with desperately
low standards of living this has been,
as it must be, accomplished by the
people themselves.
It is not easy to cast our minds
back twenty years. It reminds us of
too many of our mistakes. But it is
worth recalling that doubt was wide¬
spread in the mid-40s whether there
could be any development of signifi
cance in countries which began with
the enormous backlog of poverty,
illiteracy, inefficiency and instability
which characterized so many of the
developing countries.
Those who doubted the possibility
of progress were wrong. Under¬
development is not necessarily a vi¬
cious circle; it is an evil that man
has the power to eradicate. To use
Professor Arthur Lewis' pungent phrase,
underdevelopment is "a lickable pro¬
position". But to "lick" it, a greater
and better managed effort for interna¬
tional co-operative assistance is re¬
quired and we won't have a hundred
years to do it.
The record is all the more Impressive
if we recollect that over sixty new
countries gained formal independence
in the twenty years following the
Second World War. They have added
their voices to a clamorous protest
against the inequity of human con¬
ditions.
Which of us, knowing the conflict¬
ing political, tribal and cultural pres¬
sures, as well as the economic weak¬
ness and lack of political experience
which afflicted new developing coun-

tries, would have dared to predict that
they would pass through the crucial
early stages of political independence
with, on the whole, only limited, though
highly publicized, turmoil and with
strengthened political frameworks? It
took great faith and great foresight in
the new countries to do this. Fortu¬
nately, there were also men of the
same foresight and faith who were
prepared to help them by a massive
transfer of resources, material and
human.
Those qualities are now to be tested
once more, for we stand at a critical
point in the development effort.
The figures indicating progress are
encouraging. They show what can be
done. But against the needs and the
magnitude of the problem and against
the present mood of disengagement
they give little ground for optimism and
none whatever for complacency.
D
10
ESPITE great over-all pro¬
gress, the impact made on the poverty
of individuals comprising nearly two-
thirds of the world's population is still
pitifully small. Living conditions in
most developing areas remain well
below the standard of Europe before
the industrial revolution. Well over
half of the citizens of developing coun¬
tries still must survive on average
annual incomes below $100 a year.
Many of these countries, including
some of the largest and poorest, have
fallen considerably below the average
rate of growth. With the rapid rise in
population the improvement in income
per head is often imperceptible.
People live longer, but often not any
better.
Many more children are in school,
but the education they are receiving
is often irrelevant to their surroundings
and their country's needs. There are
immense problems of uncontrolled
urban migration and unemployment.
Even the encouraging results of the
"green revolution" in agriculture have
created new problems as well as re¬
moved old ones.
These are but a few of the problems
ahead. Yet, we now have the one
indispensable element with which
policy-makers in the 1940s were not
blessed. We know, as they did not
know, that development programmes
can work, that development can, in
fact, be induced where but only where
there is the will and the work. We
must now ask how we can use this
knowledge for a new, accepted, and
more systematic approach to the
development problems of the 1970s
and beyond.
Tragic consequences will surely
follow tomorrow our failure to
act today'
W.E strongly believe that
development must, in the future even
more than it has in the past be an
active and a genuine partnership bet¬
ween rich nations and poor. It is
futile to hope for the day when either
side can stand off at a distance and
provide or receive large quantities of
aid without fully understanding and
participating in the process by which
their allocation and use is decided.
No country has the right to intervene
in another's policy-making, but any
country or agency which transfers
resources to another country does
have a right to be heard and to be
informed about decisions which basic¬
ally affect the development it is helping
to support.
This partnership, which must be
separated as much as possible from
the vagaries of day-to-day politics, is
basic to a sustained relationship
centred upon long-term development
objectives which is the only proper
basis for a systematic approach to the
problem. It must cover not only the
official resource flows, which are the
responsibility of governments and
which, strictly speaking, are alone
entitled to be called "aid"; it must also
include policies with respect to trade
and private capital flows which can be
equally important to the growth of the
developing countries.
These private flows, of course (they
make up now nearly half the total flow
of financial resources to developing
countries) are no burden on the tax¬
payer. They may be a risk as well as
a profit for the investor, but the
burden after allowing for the very
real development value of the loan is
on those who have to do the repaying.
That burden is now heavy in certain
developing countries and is increasing
in some to the point where debt ser¬
vicing is exceeding new lending.
Second, it is clear that official aid
should increasingly be directed to
economic development, as opposed to
the many shorter term objectives to
which it has been so often directed in
the past.
There are, of course, countries where
rapid development must await basic
and long-term improvements in social
conditions, but for the great majority
of countries a concerted effort at
development which produces clear and
measurable progress should now be
possible and should be the basis for
self-sustaining growth as well as for
the social progress which must not be
separated from it.
Additional aid, in short, should be
aimed at a clear and tangible objec¬
tive and allocated according to explicit
criteria wh^ph emphasize, above all,
the economic performance of the reci¬
pient but do not ignore social change.
We feel that the over-all target for
the 1970s should be an average annual
rate of growth of 6 per cent for the
developed world as a whole...
We understand and accept that this
will be an average rate of growth, and
that some countries will do better and
some worse. Nevertheless, we believe
that this global target could be of great
use in establishing a bench-mark by
which progress can be measured and
success defined.
We also strongly believe that a
simple growth rate and a global target
is not enough. To be satisfactory to
both developed and developing coun¬
tries, aid must be planned to help an
economy reach the point where growth
is self-sustaining, and can be main¬
tained without foreign financing on
concessional terms...
s,I OME of the machinery ne¬
cessary for this purpose is already in
existence. We are encouraged by the
work of the consortia, of the consulta¬
tive groups, and of regional organiza¬
tions, which combine donors and
recipients in a regular forum in which
both past performance and future aid
requirements are reviewed.
We believe that this sort of system
should come into being in those count¬
ries and regions where it is not now
the rule. To this end we recommend
that the World Bank and the regional
banks not only take the lead in
strengthening these institutions where
they exist, but also in helping to create
new ones where they are needed.
There must be greater co-ordination
and broader consultation on all aspects
of the development process espe¬
cially in the field if the aid relationship
is to be effective and satisfactory.

bracing all relevant resource flows, and

pally according to agreed standards of

The production of electric power has multiplied by seven In Asia,
five in Africa, and four in Latin America in the last twenty years.
Although in many parts of the developing world demand still
runs ahead of supply, power production has met the needs
of rapidly growing industries, provided irrigation for agriculture
and a vastly improved service for urban consumers, and has
made possible a start on rural electrification.

Aid from the World Bank and Its associated
organizations for African development has increased
considerably in recent years. By March 1969,
loans, credits and investments totalled over
$2,000 million. They have helped to build roads,
railways and pipelines, to construct hydro-electric
installations, to improve and expand schooling
and technical training, and to develop industrial
production and mining. Photo shows huge mounds

performance, underline the need for
a much larger multilateral element in
the international aid system. The pre¬
sent flow of concessional finance from
multilateral institutions comprises only
about 11 per cent of the total flow
of official development aid. We be¬
lieve that, by 1975, it should make
up at least 20 per cent.
Multilateral agencies enjoy special
advantages for conducting an objective
assessment of both feasibility and per¬
formance, as well as the allocation of
aid, but, to play the bigger role we
12
visualize for them, they must be effi¬
cient in organization and administra¬
tion.
This does not mean, of course, that
there should be any diminution in
bilateral aid. Indeed, our recommenda¬
tions would result in two-thirds of the
increased flow going through bilateral
channels.
We particularly suggest a stronger
role for the International Develop¬
ment Association (I.D.A.). We believe
that among existing organizations,
I.D.A. is in the best position to exert
FINANCING DEVELOPMENT
Financing development is the business of three international organizations that
form the World Bank Group the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation
and the International Development Association and of the United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme.
THE WORLD BANK (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) has
acquired a formidable experience of development finance since it made its first loan
in 1947. From early support of power and transport projects, it has diversified its
operations to include financing of agriculture, industry and education. The Bank
(110 member countries) also helps member states to draw up development programmes,
advises on economic policy, assists in planning projects and studies development
problems.
THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION (IFC), established in 1956, assists
member countries (today 91) to develop the private sector of their economies by loans
and investments not secured by government guarantee. From financing mining and
manufacturing, IFC has entered new fields: food-processing, distribution services and
tourism.
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (IDA), set up in 1960,
supplies capital on especially favourable terms to the least prosperous countries. Its
funds come mainly from contributions by 18 more prosperous governments of its
102 member countries and from the World Bank's own net earnings.
During the past ten years, the World Bank Group has invested about $1,000 million
a year in development.
THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (UNDP) was set up in 1965
by a merger of two existing U.N. development operations the Expanded Programme of
Technical Assistance and the Special Fund to enable the entire U.N. family to respond
more effectively to the needs of the low-income countries. The world's largest multi¬
national source of pre-investment assistance and technical co-operation, UNDP opens
the way for large-scale capital investment: more than $1,900 million in development
investment has followed 37 major UNDP projects undertaken at a total cost of only
$43 million.
leadership in the effort to establish
criteria for the allocation of aid which
emphasize economic performance,
rather than the political relationships
and historical accidents which bear
little or no relation to development
needs or performance. We also be¬
lieve that I.D.A. can be central to the
establishment of new co-ordinated
machinery designed to pull bilateral
and multilateral instruments together
into a more coherent and regularized
administrative system.
With progress and improvement in
the allocation and organization of aid,
we recommend a substantial increase
in its volume. Specifically, we believe
that the already agreed objective of
public and private transfer from de¬
veloped to developing countries of
1 per cent of Gross National Product
should be confirmed.
We do not believe, however, that
it is realistic to assume that all
countries can reach the 1 per cent
target at once even though they have
accepted it in principle. For some
the distance to be covered is too large
and the sequence of appropriation,
commitment and expenditure too long.
We believe, however, that it is both
possible and necessary to reach or
exceed this goal by 1975. All develop¬
ed countries should accept this dead¬
line; announce the steps they intend
to take to achieve it, and report
periodically on the progress made.
Perhaps even more important, we
believe that the flow of official develop¬
ment aid, the only kind which really
involves a burden on the taxpayer,
should reach 0.7 per cent of the Gross

National Product by 1975. The addi¬
tional average annual amount, about
$1,500 million, required to reach this
target is modest enough in relation
to the annual increase of Gross Natio¬
nal Product in the developed countries,
which will be about $120,000 million,
but we recognize that it may cause
difficulty for some countries. Never¬
theless, we firmly believe that no
smaller transfers can secure the inter¬
national development objective which
all seek.
It is not enough that there be more
aid. It must also be better aid, more
effectively organized and administered.
It must be suited to the needs of sound¬
ly conceived development plans,
whether this will require project or
non-project financing. It must be in¬
creasingly untied so that the admini¬
strative and economic evils of tying
are no longer visited upon the reci¬
pients. It must be accompanied more
and more with integrated technical
assistance which provides the know¬
ledge and skill necessary to make use
of the funds provided. Our report
contains many recommendations on
this matter of quality and I cannot over
emphasize its importance.
This emphasis on official aid in no
way means that we minimize the im¬
portance of private flows. On the
contrary, we feel that private foreign
investment and the transfer of know-
how are important and need to be
stimulated. We make recommenda¬
tions to this end for improving the
climate that will take into account the
legitimate interests of both the foreign
investors and the preoccupations of
the recipient country.
The vital importance of trade for
development is also underlined in our
report. A continued vigorous expan¬
sion of world trade is a basic condition
for rapid international development.
Many developing countries must be¬
come more outward looking and com¬
petitive, but the developed countries
also must review their trade policies
to remove obstacles to the expansion
of the trade of the developing countries.
The ideas I have suggested are
heavily dependent on the success of
another effort; that to control the rapid
growth in population. This growth is
largely due to the fact that the death
rate has gone down not that the birth
rate has gone up. Nevertheless, it is
increasingly clear that nothing we do
in the development field in low-income
countries will be of lasting significance
unless and until there is a substantial
slowing of the rate of population growth
which now threatens in many countries
to overwhelm all other progress.
Population is still not an easy subject
to discuss though there has been much
more candour in talk about it in recent
years. It remains, in our view, a matter
of family and national decision in which
no outside authority ought to inter¬
vene. However, it is so important
to the future of not only the develop
ment effort but the entire world that
no aid-providing agency can ignore
performance in this area any more than
it can ignore performance in any other.
We are aware that economic and
social progress is in the long run the
best way of stabilizing population
growth. But we haven't a long run
any longer. There is a population
explosion and immediate action is
needed.
We would hope that the trend which
has already appeared and seems to
be gathering force in developing
countries toward more concern with
family planning will gain even more
momentum in the years ahead.
These, then, are some of the basic
ideas of our report. In them, we have
tried to balance the goal of self-
sustained development in the low-
income world by the end of this cen¬
tury, with co-operative policy and action
for aid based on a genuine partnership.
To those who have grasped the vision
of balanced development in a world
community, with all that this holds for
the future, but do not appreciate the
practical difficulties now in the way,
the immediate steps suggested in our
report will appear too timid.
Those who do not accept our assess¬
ment of the problem may find them
unrealistic and unnecessary. We, our¬
selves, believe that these recommen¬
dations are practicable and attainable
if and I know how big an "if'can be
there is the will to that end; a will
which will be shown on both sides of 1 Q
the development front. I U

report reveals new truths. Our hope is
more modest. It is that our findings
may provoke the world-wide reconsi¬
deration we believe the subject now
needs; that, in the words of Mr. McNa-
mara, it may "stimulate discussion and
debate and prompt action on the
issues in the widest possible forum;
among governments, among interna¬
tional agencies, among public and pri¬
vate organizations of every size and
description which are concerned with
what I believe history will regard as
the most crucial task that confronted
our century: the orderly development
of mankind itself in an era of revolu¬
tionary technological change."
We are encouraged by Mr. McNa-
mara's pledge given "to undertake a
careful analysis of each of the com¬
mission's recommendations which in
any way bears upon the (Bank's) work
and to submit these analyses to the
Bank's directors with recommendations
for appropriate action."
In the policies and action to meet
what is, in fact, a crisis in International
development, .indifference rather than
opposition is the greatest obstacle to
progress.
T,
14
HE time has come for all
men of good will to recognize that
this indifference, or the kind of mild
support that gives development assis¬
tance a very low priority, is not good
enough to meet the challenge. Aid
for development must be given a high
priority even in the company of guns,
butter and outer space. History leaves
no choice, in the coming decade, to
developed and developing countries
alike, but to face together with honesty
and energy the difficult, frustrating,
but vitally important problems that are
caused by the grossly uneven pattern
of world growth.
Basically, what we have to offer
as a rationale for action to change this
pattern is our vision of a world com¬
munity in which all peoples can parti¬
cipate with dignity and self-respect;
in which the deprived and disadvan¬
taged will join the mainstream of tech¬
nological and social progress.
We can only ask those who do not
share this vision to look ahead for
25 years and try to determine what
the world will look like then, if the
division into the rich and the poor, the
developed and the stagnant societies
continues and widens, as it will cer¬
tainly do if we do not work together
to prevent it. Then think back to the
measures we could have taken, and
thereby have avoided the tragic con¬
sequences that will surely follow to¬
morrow our failure to act today.

THE STRATEG
IN A NUTSH ELL
The following are the 30 major goals and
recommendations of the Pearson Commission Report
on international development:
IN THE FIELD
OF TRADE Vigorous expansion of world trade is needed for rapid inter¬
national development, with developing countries becoming
more outward-looking and competitive.
Developed countries should abolish import duties and excessive
excise taxes on primary commodities produced exclusively by
the developing nations. Developing countries should be assured
of an increasing share of markets for their agricultural products
which may also be produced in the developed countries.
Financing should be available to help poor countries meet short¬
falls in export earnings.
Quantitative restrictions on manufactured imports from
developing countries should be abolished during the 1970s.
Trade between the developing countries themselves must be
greatly expanded, partly through new mutual tariff concession
agreements.
Regional development banks should be more strongly supported
and they should extend export credits to developing countries.
International organizations should study the need for inter¬
national payments arrangements to facilitate trade among
developing countries, and they should negotiate mutual and
wide-ranging tariff concessions.
Financial support is needed for stores of agricultural products
to meet periods of lean years and to stabilize prices.
FOREIGN
INVESTMENT
Developing countries should remove impediments to foreign
investment and assure stability and improved administrative
procedures affecting foreign firms.
Foreign investors in developing countries should contribute
to manpower training, local industry and national growth.
Developing countries should not grant foreign investors
excessive protection and tax concessions.
CONTINUED NEXT PAGE

STRATEGY IN A NUTSHELL (Continued)
ECONOMIC
GROWTH
International organizations and creditor governments should
set up an "early warning system" to let developing countries
know they are nearing the danger zone of excessive debt
burden.
Private foreign investment is not an alternative to public aid.
Official aid to finance roads, schools and hospitals is a
prerequisite to private investment.
Increases in aid should be clearly aimed at helping the develop¬
ing countries to reach a path of sustained growth. The target
of the 1970s is to increase average annual GNP at least 6 per
cent per year. Countries that reach this level should be self-
reliant by the end of the century.
Aid increases in the future should be closely linked to the
economic objectives and development performance of the
countries receiving aid. In return, poor countries should expect
commitments of support from rich countries.
VOLUME
OF AID
The U.N. target of foreign aid by wealthier nations equalling
1 per cent of their gross national product should be reached
by 1975 at the latest. Public or government aid in the form of
grants or low or interest-free loans should make up 0.70 per cent
of the gross national product by 1975 and in no case later than
1980.
Food aid programmes will have to be replaced by other forms
of aid as developing countries become more self-reliant in
food production.
DEBT RELIEF Debt relief should be recognized as a legitimate form of aid.
To avoid future debt crises, aid terms should be more lenient
and uniform among donor groups.
AID ADMIN
ISTRATION
Foreign aid donors and receiving countries should meet this
year to cut through administrative red tape and set up three-
year programmes instead of annual budgets.
There should be less strings attached to aid-giving obliging
developing countries to buy goods in donor countries. Donor
nations should grant more leeway allowing their funds to be
used for buying in other developing countries.
TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE
16
Rapid growth during the 1960s of more than 10 per cent a
year has created shortcomings in this form of aid. It has often
failed to meet actual requirements of developing countries,
especially in agriculture and education, and has not been
adequately integrated with capital assistance.

MULTI¬
LATERAL AID
National and international corps of technical assistants should
be able to make a career of their work, with help from both
donor countries and private institutions.
Family planning should be available to all. No child shoul
be born unwanted. Birth rate control must be stressed by
both donors and recipients when planning aid programmes.
A Commissioner for Population should be appointed by the
United Nations to help direct population control programmes
in the various U.N. agencies.
The World Bank in consultation with the World Health Orga¬
nization should launch an international programme for the
mobilization of research resources in this field.
Greater resources should be made available for educationa
research and experimentation in new teaching methods in
developing countries to increase their capacity to absorb,
adapt and develop scientific and technical knowledge.
A share of research and development resources in indus¬
trialized countries should be oriented towards problems in
developing countries. Rich countries should help in setting
up international and regional centres for research and develop¬
ment in fields such as tropical agriculture, extension techniques,
education, and urban planning.
International organizations must exert greater leadership and
direction to make development assistance a genuinely inter¬
national effort.
The share of multilateral aid should be increased from the
present 10 per cent of official public aid to 20 per cent by 1975.
The International Development Association (IDA), the World
Bank's easy-loan financing agency, should become a pivotal
organization in multilateral aid efforts.
IDA should almost quadruple its work by 1975 with national
contributions reaching a total of $1,500 million compared with
a level of $400 million at present. Regional development banks
must also receive increased support.
The president of the World Bank should call a conference during
1970 of all U.N. and other international, multilateral and bilateral
agencies to work toward co-ordinating their efforts, now
lacking direction, so as to create a coherent international aid
system. | 1 J

TAKING
THE WIND
BY
THE ROOT

WMV^MMl
In regions where soil is shallow
and vulnerable to erosion by wind
and floods, tree roots, like friendly
hands, help to sustain and stabilize
the topsoil. When forests are cut
down indiscriminatingly the soil is
swept away, leaving a bare eroded
landscape. Over the centuries this
has happened in Algeria to the
detriment of farming and also of
dams which are quickly filled with silt
carried in by flood waters. To
halt the devastation of its arable land,
Algeria, with aid from FAO, has
launched a big reafforestation
programme in which young men and
women will help to restore the
country's vanished forests.

Third World
l
20
HE phrase "less developed
countries" is used to refer to almost
100 nations, poor in money income but
diverse in culture, economic condition,
and social and political structure.
Consequently, the first implication of
concern for their development is
recognition of their immense diversity.
For example:
Low-income countries include India
with 530 million people, South Korea
with 30 million, Costa Rica with
1.5 million, and Gabon with 500,000.
India has 17 states, the largest with
more people than any European
country; Gabon has fewer people than
a single borough of London.
Large size entails complex problems
of administration and political cohesion
as well as large markets and potential
economies of scale; small countries
often present a significantly different
picture, with problems centering on
limited markets, shortages of skills,
and weak bargaining power.
Population is growing rapidly in
most of the developing countries, but
there are great differences in social
and economic problems where there
are 1,200 people per square mile, as
in East Pakistan, as opposed to where
there are 26, as in Brazil. Where new
lands can be opened up, at whatever
cost, the psychology is not the same
as where fixed amounts of land are
subdivided into ever less adequate
parcels.
The political systems of the
developing countries range from fully
participatory democracy through one-
party systems to dictatorships. The
private sector is heavily relied upon in
some economies, and the public
sector in others, with a majority of
economies somewhere in between,
except for public utilities and heavy
industries which are usually owned by
the state.
As political consciousness increases
and economic power is diversified,
traditional values give way to new
patterns of behaviour, reflected in an
even richer kaleidoscope of political
patterns and economic policies.
The diversity among value systems
in low-income countries is at least as
great as in the industrialized world.
Some societies are as old as the
Mexican or Indian; some were only
recently freed from colonialism; some
are committed to rapid industrialization
while others have yet to chart a clear
economic course; some societies have
no choice but to devote most of their
energies to composing racial and
tribal differences to achieve viable
statehood. Neither the acquisition of
wealth nor the regimentation of the
machine are universally admired or
accepted.
The capacity to absorb political and
economic change also varies widely,
with the social flexibility, the colonial
history, the reservoir of skilled
manpower, and a host of other
variables. The administrative capacity
essential for coping with change is
greater in Latin America and Asia than
in Africa. However, even when there
is good administrative capacity, as in
the Asian subcontinent, it may prove
unable to move from traditional law
and order functions to promotion of
change without loss of efficiency.
There are also great variations in
income level and economic potential.
Argentina has an income of more than
$780 per head, India about $90 and
several countries less than $60. Most
of the people in some countries live
on the brink of subsistence, while in
others the minimum amenities are, or
can be, assured.
There are similarly vast differences
in economic structure. There are
many economies which place heavy
reliance on foreign trade, but also a
few, like India, which depend only
marginally on trade. Such countries
as Zambia and Venezuela have large
mineral sectors; a few, such as Hong
Kong and Mexico, have substantial
industrial sectors; but the great
majority are overwhelmingly dependent
on agriculture.
There are equally sharp differences
in patterns of ownership and income
distribution. Economic potential is, of
course, difficult to assess accurately;
discoveries of oil reserves, gas fields,
or new uses for old metals continue to
prove earlier forecasts fallacious.
Still, given our present knowledge,
Turkey is reasonably well endowed
with raw materials and a temperate
climate Chad is not. India has all
the physical resources of a great
power some countries hardly seem
to have the basic requisites for
national survival.
Thus development problems are
vastly different from country to
country. National objectives are
determined by past experiences and
by cultural and political history, filtered
perhaps imperfectly through the rulers'
desires.
CONTINUED PAGE 22
Latin America's income per head has
grown substantially since 1945, slightly
exceeding the average growth rates
for Africa and South Asia.
Manufacturing has been the most
rapidly growing sector, expanding
by an annual average of 6 per cent for
the region as a whole. Right, nylon

project to raise production by 70 per

developing countries, has provided
$1.2 million for the project.

KALEIDOSCOPE OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT (Continued)
The role of governments may be
widespread or minimal. They may
inherit extensive or negligible infra¬
structure and administrative skills;
their people may be politically unstable
or mature; they may have a tradition
of thrift and industriousness, or they
may still need to build these traits.
Despite this diversity, a common
purpose emerges in nearly every
country: to reduce poverty; to ensure
minimum levels of education, health,
housing, and food to every citizen; to
increase control over nature by the
nation and the individual; to broaden
the opportunity for choice.
The balance of the past has
been upset in many ways by new
desires, reduced mortality rates, new
technology and the material objectives
find new expressions as they merge
with old and varied cultures. One
would not expect the ascendancy of
new aspirations to be a smooth or
silent process, and it has not been.
In most countries development has
resulted only through constant struggle
between modernizing and traditional
elements.
22
LESS than twenty years
ago, much technology, some patience,
and a great deal of money were thought
to combine all the ingredients for over¬
coming poverty. Most colonial powers
believed that their colonies for many
developing countries were not yet
independent would need decades
of assistance before they had the
economic and administrative capacity
for statehood. Talk of rapid progress
after independence was considered
visionary.
In the developing countries, on the
other hand, elimination of colonial
rule was almost everywhere seen as
opening the way to early prosperity.
The nature of the obstacles that
colonialism imposed were, naturally,
seen differently in different countries.
To some it was a system that kept
them producing agricultural products
and minerals while denying them the
benefits of industrialization; to others
its most objectionable element was
its protection of foreign industrial
undertakings, which could, after
independence, be nationalized or
compelled by regulations to conform
to national interests.
Of course, concern about un¬
favourable conditions of foreign
demand for traditional agricultural
products was not limited to newly
independent developing countries, nor
were there no similarities between
the general postures of low-income
countries on matters of economic
policy.
Most such countries emphasized
domestic, import-substituting industry
as both politically necessary and
economically desirable; most believed
In direct governmental action and
ownership of industry as an essential
ingredient of national planning and
income redistribution; and most gener¬
ally ignored the importance to growth
of increases in general productivity.
Economic development was often
seen at first as something undertaken
by the elite for the masses; the need
to engage the energies of the people
was hardly considered important even
where in theory their participation was
considered desirable. Market forces,
private ownership, and profit were
often distrusted in part because they
were associated with the spread of
colonialism, in part because the ruling
groups came from the military or
administrative elite. Those who were
concerned to distribute income more
equitably had no experience of
taxation, public expenditures, and
generalized incentives as instruments
of policy.
The role of government in promoting
development was often misinterpreted.
Particularly in the former colonial
areas it was seen as an extension of
the centralized, control-oriented colo¬
nial rule. Few fully appreciated the
human resources needed for rapid
growth, the growing pressure for
social services, particularly in towns,
the importance of more and better
education and better health facilities.
The donor countries also exhibited
imperfect understanding of these
problems. The former colonial powers
continued financial and technical
assistance to the newly independent
states, and some assistance began to
flow from other donors, but develop¬
ment did not become an important
focus of assistance until the latter part
of the 1950s.
Initially, it was assumed that
technical assistance to transfer skills
and technology and commercial types
of financing was adequate. Even
where soft loans or grants were
available, e.g., from the United States,
there was little understanding of the
scale of problem being addressed, the
magnitude of the necessary social and
political change, or the time it would
take. Nor were the impact of trade
policy or the terms of assistance given
much thought.
u NDERSTANDING of de¬
velopment and its effect on the total
economy and society has gradually
improved, but only in this decade has
the improved understanding found
expression in policy. The process is
still far from complete.
These oversimplifications led both
industrial and low-income countries to
overemphasize aid flows and per
capita GNP (Gross National Product)
growth, a habit which is only slowly
giving way to the realization that the
impact of aid flows on GNP depends
largely on the efficiency with which
the recipient uses domestic resources
and on the over-all economic and

social policies which he pursues.
These policies have other goals
e.g., equality of personal or regional
income distribution, or investment in
education and social services which
sometimes must be met at the expense
of a lower rate of growth. There also
is an increasing understanding that aid
flows may be offset, or growth limited,
by unfavourable international trade
and monetary policies.
Past approaches are gradually being
modified by the experience of two
decades.
Many developing countries now
recognize that the economy must be
more outward-looking; that export
earnings, not aid, must be the principal
source of foreign exchange.
It is also increasingly clear that the

agricultural sector, which contains
most of the people, is capable of rapid
growth and that promoting growth in
this sector is necessary to create
demand for domestic industries, to
provide industrial raw materials, and
to fuel the drive for greater exports.
Even in the countries most committed
to public ownership, increasing
attention is now being paid to
mobilizing and allocating resources
through individual incentives and
initiative. The public sector retains
its generally broad responsibility in
utilities, transport, natural resources,
and basic industries, but there is a
greater willingness to work through
the market and use profit incentives,
within constraints dictated by social
and political objectives.
Industrialized countries, on the other
hand, increasingly understand that the
framework for development in today's
developing countries Is immensely
different from that In Europe and
North America during the Industrial
Revolution. Few cared then about
urban slums, child labour, poor
working conditions, and abysmal
wages. Who does not care now?
Political consciousness has created
demands for public services and
equitable income distribution which did
not occur in the industrialized coun¬
tries until a much higher level of in¬
come and productivity had been
reached.
The demographic situation is also
very different and imposes high costs.
The equilibrium between deaths and
births has been disturbed abruptly and
has accelerated population growth
rates while migration to new lands is
severely restricted.
Finally, the very technology which
the developing countries inherit, and
which makes rapid growth possible,
also brings problems e.g., manpower
training, maintenance, and a very
much higher capital cost per worker
which the industrial countries were
able to solve gradually. Educated to
some extent by their attempts to
eliminate the vestiges of poverty in
their own societies, industrialized
countries are beginning to understand
the social and political complexities of
development.
Most important, they now understand
that there is no single strategy or

KALEIDOSCOPE (Continued)
universal prescription for development
which is valid In all countries at all
times; many combinations of policies
and priorities are both possible and
necessary.
Some, but by no means all, of this
new awareness has been reflected in
the aid programmes by which donors
give meaning to their concern for the
fate of the poorer countries. External
assistance has been vital in many
countries to alleviate shortages of
skills, to make possible higher rates of
savings and investment, to improve
social services, and to accelerate, the
rate of growth.
But aid has also served a second
critical purpose. When provided in
proper ways, it has afforded low-
income countries some of the flexibi¬
lity necessary to undertake such bold
policy changes as devaluation and
liberalization of restrictions on imports.
(Of course, the failure of aid to grow
in recent years has made it more and
more difficult to mobilize adequate
support for significant policy change
in countries where a lack of foreign
exchange has been the first constraint
on growth.)
|N Africa, where foreign
exchange is not yet the major
constraint, the volume of aid and the
aid relationship nevertheless play an
important role in economic policy
formulation.
Even where the importance of local
efforts and policies has been recog¬
nized, however, discussions between
donors and recipients have often been
less than satisfactory. Sometimes
joint analysis of the problem has led
to effective joint action, but often
commitment to development is lacking
on one side or on both or is
misinterpreted.
Problems range from the unwilling¬
ness of recipients to interfere with
vested interests to donor refusal to
assist potentially competitive sectors
or to open their markets to new
products. Often, too, donor and
recipient differ about the importance
or political sensitivity of an act, or the
speed with which there is a likelihood
of it being accomplished.
Finally, political priorities of both
recipients and donors are often
indefinite and certainly changeable.
Recipient countries have received
conflicting policy advice from different
donors, or from the same institution in
different years. Their priorities are
subject to the normal political press¬
ures, and settling and acting on them
is difficult.
Thus, while attention has been
successfully focused on development
policies and the support they require,
the mechanism for implementing a
joint analysis is still, with some notable
exceptions, far from adequate.


An answer to the population dilemma
N.
I O other phenomenon casts
a darker shadow over the prospects
for international development than the
staggering growth of population. It is
evident that it is a major cause of the
large discrepancy between rates of
economic improvement in rich and
poor countries. On the other hand,
the likelihood of a rapid slowing down
of population growth is not great,
although some countries are in a far
more favourable position than others
in this respect.
Twenty years ago, it was not ex¬
pected that .population growth would
become such a major problem In low-
income countries. As late as 1951, a
U.N. projection assumed that between
1950 and 1980 the populations of Africa
and Asia would grow at an annual rate
of 0.7-1.3 per cent.
The remarkable and largely unex¬
pected success in reducing mortality
brought a sharp change. The rate of
population growth in developing coun¬
tries increased steadily in the 1950s.
By the mid-1960s, it settled down at
an average level of 2.5 per cent.
Mortality is continuing its decline,
but over-all fertility rates are only now
beginning to drop. While in a number
of developing countries, fertility has
been declining for some time, in others
it is increasing as a result of improve¬
ment in health and medical services.
Even if fertility should be considerably
reduced in coming decades, the popu¬
lation of the less developed world will
double before the end of this century.
(See Table page 26.)
There has been a remarkable awak¬
ening to the acute problems posed
by this population explosion. In only
a few years, ambitious policies to
spread family planning have been intro¬
duced in countries representing over
70 per cent of the population of the
developing world. The development
of ¡ntra-uterine contraceptive devices
(lUD's) and of oral pills has amounted
to a major breakthrough in family plan¬
ning techniques.
However, many misconceptions
about the nature of the population
problem persist among policy-makers
in low-income countries and contri¬
bute to complacency and indifference.
Even countries which have adopted
official population policies do not
always accord to them the high priority
they require.
Most widespread of all is the belief
that in small or sparsely settled coun¬
tries, rapid population growth is in the
national interest or raises no problems,
as there is much empty land. This
proposition neglects the fact that large
capital expenditures are necessary for
cultivation and settlement in empty
land in the modern world, the pos¬
session of land is not enough.
Another common opinion is that birth
rates are high and families large be¬
cause parents want it that way, and
that it would be difficult or even im¬
possible to persuade them to have
smaller families.
Actually, however, many of the chil¬
dren born today are unwanted. Num¬
erous field surveys of parents in
developing countries indicate that birth
rates would be reduced by one-third
if parents had the knowledge and
means to plan the size of their families.
The incidence of illegal abortions,
and of maternal deaths from such

No more unwanted children
abortions, is high enough to be a
grave social problem in Latin America
and elsewhere. As a consequence of
the sudden decline in infant mortality,
families tend to be larger than their
traditional size, and larger than parents
can afford. In short, there is in many
parts of the world a silent demand for
family planning.
All the burdens from large families
and high growth rates are not borne
by parents alone. When the popula¬
tion doubles in twenty-five years, the
task of development and moderniza¬
tion is compounded. It may even be
impossible to attain significant impro¬
vement in living conditions and inde¬
pendence of foreign aid. Some of the
direct difficulties created by very rapid
population growth are the following:
Expenditures for education, health,
housing, water supply, etc., Increase
sharply and create severe budgetary
strains.
The quality of the next generation,
on which the prospects for develop¬
ment crucially rest, is jeopardized.
There ¡s a strong inverse correlation
between child health and family size.
Rapid growth of the child population
also delays educational improvement.
Considerable resources are de¬
voted to the support of a large depen¬
dent population which would otherwise
be available to raise living standards
and increase capital formation.
Aid requirements are larger when
population rises fast, and the possi¬
bility of future financial independence
smaller than if fertility is declining.
The distribution of income is un¬
equal, and population growth tends to
make it more so by raising land values
and rents while depressing wages. As
ownership, too, is usually very un¬
equally distributed, the bulk of the
.population may fail to participate in
whatever improvement occurs.
Severe urban problems arise, partly
from natural increase and partly from
migration from the country into the
cities. Urban populations tend to
double in fifteen to eighteen years.
Housing already presents almost in¬
soluble problems in many of the de¬
veloping countries.
HETHER or not a deli¬
berate policy on population should be
adopted is a decision which each
individual country itself must face. This
is, of course, a highly controversial
matter which, until very recently,
placed family planning behind a wall of
silence in the industrialized countries
themselves. But it is clear that there
can be no serious social and economic
planning unless the ominous impli¬
cations of uncontrolled population
growth are understood and acted
upon.
Demographic conditions in the less
developed countries are extremely
diverse. In parts of Asia the density
of settlement is so high as to raise
concerns about the shortage of land.
In Africa and Latin America, on the
other hand, settlement is so sparse
that it is impossible to speak of over¬
population. But in all developing coun¬
tries the population is rising very much
faster than only two decades ago.
It is important to distinguish between
two quite different reasons for the
rapid increase in population. One is
that many parents have more children
than they wish, especially after the
recent declines in infant mortality
which have had the consequence that
family size increases sharply unless
birth rates decline. Another reason,
however, is that the number of chil¬
dren parents in developing countries
want to have is also quite large.
Family-planning policies by and
large address themselves to the prob¬
lem of preventing unwanted births.
They are based on the assumption that
parents have the right to decide on
the number and the spacing of their
children, and on the evidence that high
and unrestricted fertility is a major
social problem.
Malnutrition and mental retardation,
high infant mortality, and illiteracy are
all more probable when a new child
must compete for survival with its
elders in conditions of great poverty.
The need for responsible parenthood
is not disputed even by those who do
not yet endorse all contraceptive tech¬
niques, and we believe that the right
of individuals to knowledge and means
of family planning is fundamental to
social progress.
However, rapid population growth
may also be injurious to a society even
though individual parents desire to
have large families. This dilemma pre¬
vails in many countries, rich and poor.
A conflict between social and private
interests in a matter so intimate as
this is bound to raise delicate issues.
But no society which has learned to
control mortality can long escape the
need to control birth, and many of the
developing countries are now con¬
vinced of the need for population

POPULATION DILEMMA (Continued)
Family planning and economic realities
policies to bring down birth rates.
Developing countries should identify
their population problem, if they have
not already done so, and recognize the
relevance of population growth to their
social and economic planning, and
adopt appropriate programmes.
Aid-givers cannot be indifferent to
population planning and policy-making,
inadequate or otherwise, in the receiv¬
ing countries. In particular, they must
be concerned if even the magnitude of
the present population is unknown and
if trends for the future receive little
attention, as is the case in some of
the poorer countries.
B

ILATERAL and interna¬
tional agencies should, in their aid
négociations, press for- adequate ana¬
lysis of population problems and the
bearing of these problems on develop¬
ment programmes.
But it would be particularly unwise
for aid-givers to insist on the adoption
of population policies by other coun¬
tries as a condition for aid. Only a
genuine conviction on the part of
governments in developing countries
can produce the strong political sup¬
port and the determined leadership
which experience has shown that fami¬
ly-planning programmes and population
policy require.
In many of the rich countries, gov¬
ernments have not yet moved as far
in their own public policies as their
citizens have in the adoption of family
planning. To convey to their aid part¬
ners their awareness of population
problems, such governments must first
be in a position to preach what they
practice.
The population problem is serious
enough, even in the industrialized
countries, to call for much greater
preoccupation with population study
and research. This is also a pre¬
requisite for any serious technical ass¬
istance to developing countries. Out¬
side a very few of the largest industrial
countries, demography and population
studies still receive no more than
casual attention at universities and
research institutes.
The wealthy countries can hardly
qualify for an active discussion about
population policy in developing coun¬
tries without giving firm support to
international organizations which have
a much larger role to play in this field
than they have so far done. The pas¬
sivity and hesitancy of international
bodies has to a large extent reflected
the ambivalence and confusion of the
industrialized member countries.
It seems particularly wrong for coun¬
tries which themselves have so far
been spared the acute need for popu¬
lation policy to refuse international
organizations the right or the means
to help countries which request assis¬
tance in this field.
Since 1965, there has, in fact, been
a very pronounced tendency to enlarge
the scope for international action in
this field. UNICEF and other specia¬
lized agencies have all received man¬
dates to assist in the formulation and
execution of family-planning policies.
Both for the study of demographic
trends and their implications, and for
the initiation and extension of family-
planning programmes in countries
which have decided to pursue them,
there is an acute need for experts and
training. This is one of the most im¬
portant tasks of these organizations.
The financial requirements of family-
planning programmes are not very
large compared to other development
expenditures. Budgets in developing
countries, however, are often so
strained and foreign exchange short¬
ages so acute that programmes are
held up by bottlenecks which can be
broken by relatively modest amounts
of aid.
Such aid is now provided by some
bilateral donors, notably the United
States and Sweden, and on a modest
scale by international organizations.
For aid suppliers who hesitate to build
up specialized machinery for this kind
of assistance, the use of special trust
funds administered by international
organizations should commend itself.
In 1967, a Trust Fund for Population
Activities was established in the United
Nations, with the purpose of support
ing activities in the population field.
We believe that this fund could expect
far more generous support than it has
so far received if prospective donors
could be assured that good projects
are, in fact, available, and that U.N.
activities in the population field are
satisfactorily co-ordinated.
As things now stand, there are both
gaps and overlaps in the handling of
population problems by U.N. agencies.
Effective organization of assistance for
population programmes is needlessly
delayed.
Among the proposals for improved
co-ordination is the creation of a
United Nations Commissioner for
Population. His task should be to
obtain and maintain an over-all view of
the needs of developing countries in
the population field, to have principal
responsibility for the allocation of the
Trust Fund, and to head up machinery
to co-ordinate the population activities
of U.N. agencies.
It is necessary to take far-reaching
but practicable actions if the great
opportunities for international assis¬
tance in this area are to be utilized.
To make the knowledge and means
of family planning available to all is
an enormous task in societies where
communication and commercial distri¬
bution channels are highly imperfect.
Experience suggests that wherever
possible it is desirable to integrate
family-planning activities with public
health programmes.
Facilities for maternal and child
health programmes to instruct women
in family planning after delivery seem

particularly valuable, as the desire to
have fewer children is closely linked
to the conviction that they now have a
better chance to survive.
In the developing world many par¬
ents want large families for good and
valid economic reasons; not because
they are ignorant or improvident. In
such cases, access to family-planning
information and facilities will not make
much difference.
When child labour makes a sig¬
nificant contribution to family income
and when parents are dependent on a
large family for protection and security
in old age, there will be few incentives
to reduce fertilily, no matter what the
social cost of a rapidly expanding
population.
T,HIS is why the population
problem is also related to a great
number of policies and institutional
changes which affect the social and
economic functions of the family in a
traditional society. In the long run,
economic growth and modernization
tend to make a large family a heavy
economic burden rather than a source
of gain and security, and thus to
discourage fertility and slow popu¬
lation growth, but this process takes
a long time if it is not deliberately
accelerated.
Education, and perhaps particularly
female education, is recognized to be
of great Importance, but only if it really
alters people's attitudes and ambitions,
which is not always the case.
The development of mass media
press, radio, and television helps to
spread new Ideas, among them the
notion that the ideal family should
have fewer but healthier and better-
educated children.
The creation of savings banks for
small savers, as well as life insurance
and pension funds, substitutes other
and more efficient ways of providing
for old age.
Most developing countries already
have policies of social security of
one sort or another, but most of them
are poorly administered and under¬
financed. As a result social policy
tends by and large to subsidize child-
rearing more effectively than it pro¬
vides social security for old age. This
means it probably encourages large
families Instead of discouraging them.
These large and important fields of
social policy which are closely related
to the problems of family size should
receive the greatest attention from de¬
veloping countries. They also deserve
wide support from all aid suppliers.
In the world today, where economic
and social change is so accelerated,
it would be a mistake to believe that
welfare policies which reduce the

In all developing countries population is rising very much faster than only two decades
ago. But recently there has been a remarkable awakening to the acute problems
posed by the population explosion. In only a few years, ambitious policies to spread
family planning have been introduced in countries representing over 70 per cent of
the population of the developing world. Above, a newly-opened family planning clinic
in Pakistan which, with an annual population increase of 3 per cent (compared with
0.6 per cent in England and France), faces a serious threat of overpopulation.

The rising spiral
of
unemployment
28
IN many, If not most of the
developing countries, unemployment is
turning into a major social problem
and obstacle to development. The
failure to create meaningful employ¬
ment is the most Iragic failure of
development. All Indications are that
unemployment and under-utilization of
human resources have Increased in
the 1960s, and that the problem will
grow even more serious with the rapid
growth of population.
Although there is much evidence of
the appalling magnitude of the unem¬
ployment problem, there is little speci¬
fic information about it. The Interna¬
tional Labour Organization is trying to
muster the resources for a large
employment survey in the developing
countries, and this deserves all
support.
A great difficulty, especially in tra¬
ditional societies, is that there Is no
hard and fast distinction between
unemployment and underemployment.
Underemployment describes a sit¬
uation in which individual capacity
to work is not fully engaged, as when
highly trained personnel are forced to
work at menial labour for lack of
demand, or when agriculture does not
begin to absorb the labour available.
Although there are no firm estimates
of underemployment, it is clear that
recorded unemployment in the de¬
veloping countries understates the
problem.
Both unemployment and underem¬
ployment are results of the failure to
absorb the large increase of the lab¬
our force which has followed the
acceleration of population growth.
Population policies can greatly affect
this problem but only in the long term.
Those who will constitute the labour
force over the next fifteen years are
already born.
It is not impossible for employment
to grow fast, but It requires a high
degree of dynamism and flexibility,
energetic entrepreneurship, and en¬
couragement of rapid change. In the
nonfarming sectors of low-Income
countries, one of the reasons why
extensive development efforts have
failed to create adequate employment
opportunities has undoubtedly been
the overstimulation of capital-intensive
and labour-saving technology by arti¬
ficial distortion of factor prices.
Such technology is readily available
in the industrialized countries, and
there has been a tendency for aid-
giving agencies and foreign contractors
to transfer it without modification.
Although In many cases the adoption
of such technology is -unavoidable or
even desirable to preserve competi¬
tive efficiency, present policies often
make capital-intensive methods ap¬
pear too attractive. Concessional in¬
terest rates, overvalued exchange
rates, and differenciated tariffs reduce
the private cost of Imported capital
equipment, while market wage rates
overstate the real cost of labour.
Increasing capacity to absorb lab¬
our also requires that wage rates are
not raised so high as to discourage the
use of labour and encourage the use
of capital-intensive and labour-saving
methods of production.
But in many developing countries the
inequality of income distribution is an
inducement to employment policies
which are determined by political con¬
siderations and which make the cost
of labour very high. Such policies may
also have the consequence of attrac¬
ting labour from the rural sector to
the towns where even occasional em¬
ployment may be more remunerative
than full-time agricultural work.
The main burden of absorbing the
increase in the labour force falls in¬
evitably on agriculture which, in most
of the developing countries, occupies
some 60 to 80 per cent of that force.
Only a fraction of the new workers can
find employment in non-agricultural
sectors even If these expand with
great rapidity.
A strategy for agricultural devel¬
opment which Increases employment
opportunities rapidly without depres¬
sing incomes must focus on lab¬
our-using and capital-saving ways of
Improving agricultural productivity.
Much pessimism has been voiced
about the possibility of significant
change in this direction.
A,i N encouraging aspect of
agricultural development In the last
few years, however, Is that the major
increases in yields resulting from the
new varieties and intensified irrigation
are not dependent on large-scale
substitution of capital for labour.
Nevertheless, there ¡s a danger that
as agricultural income rises, well-to-do
farmers will prefer to invest in agri¬
cultural machinery rather than to em¬
ploy large numbers of people, espe¬
cially if government policy stimulates
premature mechanization. It seems
particularly important that the mistakes
of industrial policy in this regard are
not repeated In the design of agricul¬
tural development strategy.
The urgency of the unemployment
problem requires positive policies and
programmes to reduce unemployment
and underemployment. In many areas

In probably no other
area of social
improvement have

than that of public
health. Most of the
developing world has
recorded gains In life

took a century to

areas, thus increasing
capacity to work and

UNEMPLOYMENT (Continued)
more unskilled labour could be used
to meet many urgent needs. Housing,
construction of schools and health
facilities, rural markets, secondary
roads, irrigation facilities are all exam¬
ples. While this requires a massive
administrative effort and also a great
amount of money, it would create ad¬
ditional incomes which generate ad¬
ditional demand.
Unhappily, even where the adminis¬
trative capacity exists to undertake
labour-intensive programmes on a
massive scale, countries are restrain¬
ed from doing so by fear of their in¬
flationary impact and by shortage of
foreign exchange. Foreign aid and
sensible fiscal policy can mitigate
these problems if the former is pro¬
vided on suitable terms.
Progress must be made in solving
the unemployment problem if social
and political turmoil is not to arrest
the development process. For it is
in the volatile cities of the developing
world that agricultural stagnation and
industrial unemployment combine to
produce their gravest consequences.
Urban growth is almost universally
twice as rapid as the growth of the
population in general, and some of the
largest cities have even higher rates
of expansion. Rural stagnation stimu¬
lates a flow of migrants from the land,
and urban death rates are often lower
than those in the countryside while
fertility generally remains high.
It must be asked whether urban
trends can be left to be the by-product
of other forces in society. If present
trends continued, the largest city in
India would have over 35 million
inhabitants by the year 2000.
Planning strategy in developing
countries must emphasize the growth
of small and intermediate regional
centres, to offer market, service and
storage facilities, and light labour-in¬
tensive industries processing local
materials. The construction of such
new centres could offer a consider¬
able measure of employment for un¬
skilled labour.

The
Green
Revolution
yINTIL quite recently it
seemed that the hopes for rapid
economic progress in many of the
poorest countries were doomed by
very slow growth of the huge agri¬
cultural sector. Agricultural production
barely kept pace with population
growth," and In many areas fell behind.
The less developed countries, which
had been net exporters of 14 million
tons of cereal grains each year in the
1930s, became net importers of
10 million tons per year in the 1960s.
Imports rose even further fh 1966 and
1967 after the monsoon rains in South
Asia had failed two years in succes¬
sion. There was widespread pre¬
diction of imminent famine.
These dire forecasts could not take
into account the progress that has now
been made in seed research, in
irrigation practices, in extension work,
and in agricultural education. They
also ignored the impact price incentives
could have on agricultural practices
and production. As controls over
production were relaxed and prices
for farm products were made remu¬
nerative, farmers proved willing to
adopt a new technology with amazing
rapidity.
The situation today is radically
different from earlier pessimistic
forecasts. A good part of the develop¬
ing world is now experiencing a
major breakthrough in food production,
widely characterized as the Green
Revolution.
In 1968-69, India's food output was
about 8 million tons larger than the
previous record of 89 million tons in
1964-65. Pakistan increased its wheat
production by 50 per cent in two years.
Ceylon's rice production has gone up
by 34 per cent between 1966 and 1968,
and in the Philippines two bumper rice
harvests seem to have ended half a
century of dependence on imported
rice. The most dramatic advances
have been concentrated in Asia.
These dramatic increases are well
illustrated by experience in India and
Pakistan. Indian agriculture employs
70 per cent of the population and
contributes 46 per cent of the national
product. Yet, before the mid-1960s,
agriculture received only about 15 per
cent of the Indian public development
expenditures and was not regarded as
a potential growth sector.
Little attention was paid to price
incentives for farmers, to the provision
of such agricultural inputs as fertilizer,
improved seeds, and farm machinery,
or to problems of farm credit.
IHE droughts which struck
large parts of India in 1965 and 1966
made it necessary to raise the level of
food imports to 10 million tons per
year. This highlighted the necessity
of a drastic revision of agricultural
policy
Almost simultaneously, new high-
yield varieties of wheat and rice
became available. These "dwarf"
varieties had been developed In
Mexico and the Philippines under the
sponsorship of the Ford and Rocke¬
feller Foundations. They permit pro¬
fitable application of up to three or
four times as much fertilizer as
traditional varieties, which combined
with irrigation and pesticides makes
possible a doubling or tripling of yields.
These improved strains were quickly
adopted in India, investment in agri¬
culture was expanded, and support
prices were raised. Together, these
steps represented substantial new
incentives, leading to improved yields.
In West Pakistan, lack of drainage
had by the 1950s raised the ground¬
water level, which put large areas
of farmland out of production by
increasing salinity in the soil. However,
the threat of disaster was turned into
a blessing.
The solution to the salinization
problem was the sinking of deep
tubewells to lower the water level by
intensive pumping, which permitted
the saline soil to be reclaimed. The
tubewells also produced large supplies
of irrigation water.
Originally, it was assumed that
massive public programmes would
be required, but individual farmers
adopted this innovation spontaneously
because of the tremendous use in
yields made possible by the increased
groundwater supply.
The surge in private tubewell
development became one of the most
spectacular elements of agricultural
modernization in West Pakistan. In
1959-60, about 1,300 of these wells
were installed by private farmers. By
1963-64, the annual rate of installation
had accelerated to 6,600, and by
1967-68, to about 9,500.
Although, from a technical point of
view, these wells were not very
efficient, they were extremely profit¬
able. Private and public tubewell
irrigation accounted for nearly half of
the expanded agricultural output during
the period 1959-60 to 1965-66.
As in India, the introduction of the
new varieties was swift. The acreage
under the new wheat seeds rose from
200,000 acres in 1966-67 to 2.3 million
acres the following year.
The new rice variety called IR-8 was
planted on 9,000 acres in 1967, which
produced the seed for almost 900,000
acres in 1968. Fertilizer supplies,
largely financed by foreign credits, 01
were rapidly expanded, and dramatic W I
increases in grain production did in
fact occur.

GREEN REVOLUTION (Continued)
New advances in seed research and irrigation
32
The Green Revolution has been a
matter of both new technology and
new policy. Although it is too early
to say how deep and how rapid the
impact will be and whether similar
breakthroughs will be repeated In
other parts of the world, prospects for
growth obviously look far brighter.
Above all, it has been demonstrated
that the peasant farmer, contrary to
many expectations, is not hopelessly
fettered by custom and tradition and
that he is not insensitive to costs and
prices. Given the reasonably secure
expectation of large returns, he is
likely to respond. The lessons of this
experience for development policy
extend beyond the sphere of agri¬
culture.
In the fertilizer field, which is
essential to the new agricultural
technology, progress has been striking.
There have been substantial cost
reductions in the postwar period and
further improvement is in prospect.
The capital cost of new nitrogen plants
Is almost 50 per cent lower than for
"old" (pre-1963) plants. Consumption
has risen rapidly.
IN India, fertilizer supplies
were increased by almost 80 per cent
in 1966-67 over the previous year, and
by another 50 per cent the following
year. Domestic fertilizer production
more than doubled between 1965 and
1968; imports of fertilizer and fertilizer
raw materials now equal over one-fifth
of India's total export earnings.
In Pakistan, fertilizer use has
doubled every two years since 1960.
Increases ¡n other developing countries
have been equally dramatic. Compared
to the average for the five years
ending in 1956-57, total consumption
of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizer
in 1967-68 was five times as great and
potash use had increased sixfold.
The growth of several non-food
crops, though not as dramatic as that
in wheat and rice, has also been
substantial. Between 1953 and 1967,
cotton production in Asia and Africa
rose by 40 per cent and this has been
the basis for rapid growth of the textile
industry in these areas.
Coffee production In Africa has
almost tripled from 393,000 tons to
1,145,000 tons in the same period so
that Africa now produces about 30 per
cent of the world's coffee. This
rapid growth of coffee exports from
Africa has created marketing problems,
but it does illustrate the potential of
tropical agriculture for diversification
and higher productivity.
If the Green Revolution signals a
major breakthrough in food grain
production, ¡t also brings with It an
array of new problems.
For one thing, continued heavy
expenditures on agricultural research
are necessary, as one seed variety Is
likely to last only for a few years and
must be replaced by new varieties as
new diseases evolve.
Moreover, accelerated agricultural
extension and massive investments In
irrigation and fertilizer production are
needed. Increasing production also
raises the demand for better marketing
and distribution facilities and for more
farm credit.
It will also be difficult to maintain
a set of incentives for farmers which
is adequate to elicit the necessary
production, stimulate the continued
adoption of new technology, and
support diversification into other crops.
Increased tax revenue will be
needed, but to tax agricultural income
directly is difficult In most developing
countries for the good reasons that
most farmers are very poor, that such
a tax would be politically explosive,
and that the cost of collecting the tax
might well exceed the yield.
However, the new technology is
raising some rural incomes sharply.
If large increases in income are to
arise In agriculture, some of the
increased revenue must come from
these incomes. Agricultural taxation
and the general division of the fruits
of increased agricultural productivity
among urban consumers, rural pro¬
ducers, and landowners will present
thorny policy issues which have grave
political implications and will also
affect future development.
A,l REAS untouched by the
Green Revolution, such as most of
Africa and Latin America, face a more
difficult task in stimulating technolog¬
ical change in the countryside. Many
of them still seriously neglect rural
development. For all countries it is
important to achieve new technical
breakthroughs in crops other than
foodgrains, especially in exportable
ones, not only to increase the food
supply but also to improve its quality.
Land reform and consolidation of
fragmented holdings will be needed In
many developing countries not only to
accelerate technological change and
stimulate production in the long run,
but also to generate rural employment.
History teaches us that land reform
is seldom a tidy affair and is always
time-consuming. However, most gov¬
ernments now have at their disposal
the means to minimize the short-run
disruptions and conflicts arising from
a programme of structural change in
land ownership.
THE JACKSON REPORT
An appraisal of U.N. development operations
A mammoth, 6,000-page report just published presents the findings of a far-ranging
study of the operating capacity of the U.N. development system. "The Capacity of
the U.N. Development System," as the study is called*, was commissioned by the
Governing Council of the U.N. Development Programme, which appointed Sir Robert
Jackson of Australia as commissioner in charge. His report may be considered as
complimentary to the Pearson Report ("Partners in Development"), but whereas
the latter dealt with the broad perspective of problems of development aid, the
Jackson Report tackles the more specific question of the actual and potential
capacity of the U.N. system to make an effective contribution to world and economic
and social development. Its proposals are conceived as the first steps in a
long-term process of consolidation, co-ordination and rationalization of the U.N.
bodies and specialized agencies dealing with economic and social development.
They will be studied by the Governing Council of the U.N. Development Programme
whose recommendations will be submitted to the U.N. Economic and Social Council
later this year. "(From Sales Section. United Nations. New York or Geneva: Vol. I.

Letters to the Editor
MAN AGAINST NATURE
Sir,
The Soviet magazine "Za Rubezhom"
recently published some "global" obser¬
vations by the American astronaut,
Michael Collins, and the Norwegian
seafarer, Thor Heyerdahl.
Michael Collins described the fasci¬
nating beauty of our planet with its
azure expanse of oceans, and remarked
on the striking contrast it presents with
the lifeless desert of the lunar
landscape.
Thor Heyerdahl commented sadly on
the same oceans whose beauty Collins
had admired from outer space. He
expressed his concern over the growing
pollution of the oceans by man, and
warned that if the pollution of our envi¬
ronment continues, we shall soon "have
sawn off the branch we are sitting on".
As Nature Is the heritage of all
mankind, the way people treat It should
be controlled by laws applicable to all,
and the United Nations should be
directly responsible for seeing that they
are observed.
The United Nations should also be
given adequate means for making the
oceans and continents healthier places,
and funds for this should be raised
by a special tax imposed on Industries
and other enterprises whose operations,
ships, factories, vehicles, etc., pollute
soil, water or air.
It is the duty of every thinking person
to show genuine concern for the pro¬
tection of Nature on our planet lest we
unthinkingly transform it into a sad
semblance of the Earth's satellite.

TIMELY...
Sir,
Your issue on Youth (April 1969) is
a stirring, thought-provoking, timely
collection of articles by writers who
have been moved by the contradiction
between what the world could be and
what is happening to the world because
of man's greed. I predict this number
of the "Unesco Courier" will come to
be regarded as a seminal classic.
Rachmiel Forschmidt
U.S.A.
..OR TEDIOUS ?
Sir,
The subject of Campus Unrest (April
1969) is one that most people have
heard discussed too much. This num¬
ber on Youth 1969 was repetitious and
wordy. I found it the only uninteresting
one since I have been reading the
"Unesco Courier". Regardless of the
stature and expertise of the writers,
I doubt that many people would read
it through.

CELTIC CULTURE TODAY
Sir,
As a long-standing reader of the
"Unesco Courier", I have always
enjoyed your articles on the values
and traditions of relatively little-known
cultures. My only regret is that so far
nothing has appeared on Celtic culture
and in particular on the forms in which
it has been handed down and preserved
in Brittany, my birthplace.
You would have no trouble in finding
a rich mine of material for articles and
illustrations. For a great many Bretons,
like myself, the linguistic and artistic
heritage of our Celtic ancestors is a
very real part of our daily lives.

ECONOMISTS IN EMBRYO
Sir,
I am convinced that a most important
asset to world co-operation could be
furnished by providing primary school
children of all countries with instruction
in elementary Economics and a textbook
giving the scientific definitions and rela¬
tionships of the few terms which are
used in the study. A belief that Land,
for example, Is Wealth does not accord
with these definitions any more than
does the myth that Money is Consu¬
mable Wealth.
Since economic knowledge gives
support to economic ethics so ne¬
cessary to peace I think that Unesco
ought to print and publicize a Primer
for juveniles and grade-school children
on the subject.

SIBERIA CALLING SVAMIT
Sir,
In your May 1969 number we read
a letter from a 12-year-old English girl,
Anne Souter of London, who has start¬
ed a club called SVAMIT (Save Venice
and Medieval Italian Tradition). We too
are lovers of medieval traditions and
would like to be members of Anne's
club, so please give us her address.

THE ARTS AND MAN
Sir,
Congratulations and many thanks for
"The Arts and Man" (May 1969). Though
I have studied numerous artistic and
technological aspects of modern civili¬
zation while preparing for examinations,
I never fully realized to what extent
the arts contribute to every part of
daily life. Your remarkable number
showed me the Innumerable ways in
which the arts "embody the universal
qualities of mankind as well as the
endless individual and cultural differen¬
ces which exist within the family of
man".

NO MORE UNWANTED CHILDREN (Continued from page 27)
dependence on the family as the sole
source of security can have second
priority in development strategy.
Wherever possible all aid agencies,
bilateral and multilateral, should
encourage and support social policies
with fertility-reducing implications.
The developed countries also have
a great opportunity to make a
contribution in the development of a
better contraceptive technology. Here
the situation in the less developed
countries only dramatizes a general
demand for a genuinely effective and
acceptable contraceptive. The intra¬
uterine device (IUD) and the pill
represent great advances but are far
from perfect in acceptability, con¬
venience, or effectiveness in use.
Research in reproductive biology
was enormously stimulated by the
research for new methods of fertility
control in the 1960s. This was
particularly true of the study of the
hormonal aspects of the female repro¬
duction system which is where the
pills Intervene.
But many potentially interesting
methods of fertility control centre on
relatively unexplored aspects of the
reproduction process. There is no
shortage of suggestions and hypo¬
theses but there is a lack of funds,
of co-ordination, and of systematic
contact between researchers.
An international programme of
research in human reproduction,
enlisting existing institutions and lab
oratories in high priority work on fer¬
tility control might accelerate progress
in this field by years or decades.
The World Health Organization, which
would be the natural focus, has long
been constrained to take a limited view
of problems of family planning,
confining itself to family-planning
activities within the framework of
public health organizations. Moreover,
research on human reproduction can
absorb fairly sizable funds. We
therefore recommend that the World
Bank, in consultation with WHO,
launch Immediately a wide-ranging
international programme for the direc¬
tion, co-ordination, and financing of
research in the field of human repro¬
duction and fertility control.

World weather watch
Mariners, aircrews and volunteer obser¬
vers in all parts of the world recently
helped meteorologists to assemble the most
extensive collection of data on weather
conditions yet compiled. The information
will be used in preliminary studies for
the Global Atmospheric Research Pro¬
gramme (GARP), a joint international
venture of the World Meteorological
Organization and the International Council
of Scientific Unions. The global GARP
experiment, due to take place later in
the 1970s, is aimed at a fuller under¬
standing of the structure and behaviour
of the atmosphere.
'What's What'
in Academia
Academic titles and grades vary so
widely in meaning and status from country
to country that they are difficult to com¬
pare on an international level. Unesco
has now produced an international glossary
the first of a series on the inter¬
national equivalence of diplomas. Edited
in French by Professor Marcel de Grandpré
of the University of Montreal, it enables
the reader to judge the relative value of
titles awarded in the 45 countries covered
in the glossary. (Glossaire international.

Mid-point appraisal
of Hydrological Decade
A mid-point appraisal of the Unesco-
sponsored International Hydrological
Decade was made recently by specialists
from over 80 countries, at Unesco's H.Q.
in Paris. After discussing the results of
the Decade since it began in 1964, they
examined proposals for the 1970-74 pro¬
gramme and for further international co¬
operation in hydrology. These suggest that
special emphasis will be given to the
hydrological aspects of man's impact on
his environment, including the effects of
desalination and the growing problem of
water pollution. More use is foreseen of
remote-sensing devices such as instru¬
ments mounted on aircraft or space satel¬
lites to collect data on the hydrology of
vast and relatively inaccessible regions.
Causes of heart
disease queried
High blood pressure, diabetes, over¬
weight and a sedentary occupation, com¬
monly considered as causes of coronary
heart disease in affluent countries, do not
seem to bring on this condition in develop¬
ing countries, reports the WHO review,
"World Health". Recent studies in the
developing countries suggest that this
might be due to something in African and
Asian diets and ways of life. Researchers
are scrutinizing food habits in a number
of countries. In Singapore, for instance,
there are three ethnic communities: Malay,
Chinese and Indian. The Indian community.
whose eating habits differ from those of
the other groups, is particularly prone to
heart disease. Research may show what it
is the Malayans and Chinese are eating, or
not eating, which acts as a barrier to
heart disease.
Food aids forest
development
Food aid given by the World Food
Programme has helped to grow trees on
84,000 hectares of land and to build or
maintain 4,300 kilometres of forest roads.
Food aid is supplied to sixteen forestry
projects in 15 countries employing nearly
88,000 workers. Nearly 450,000 persons
(workers and families) benefit from the
food which pays part of their wages and
improves general nutrition. The World
Food Programme is sponsored jointly by
the U.N. and FAO.
Traditional music
of Viet-Nam
The music of Hué, central Viet-Nam,
is featured on the first LP record of Viet¬
namese music in the Unesco Collection,
Musical Anthology of the Orient and inclu¬
des court dances, songs of the traditionaJ
theatre, Buddhist chants and poetic
songs (1). Twenty-one records in the
Unesco Collection present music from
Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Iran, Japan,
Tibet, Tunisia and Turkey.

Modern problems
in biology
An international training course in
modern problems in biology organized by
the Institute of Microbiology, Prague, and
sponsored by Unesco and WHO, will be
held at the Institute from October 1, 1970
to September 15, 1971.' Combining pract¬
ical training and research, the course is
open to young scientists who have
graduated with a Master of Science or
equivalent degree. Applications should be
sent to: The Director, Institute of Micro¬
biology, Budejovicka street 1083, Prague
4-Krc, Czechoslovakia, by May 31, 1970.
Critical doctor shortage
in Middle East
Though Middle East medical schools
have increased from 12 to 38 since 1950,
the region remains critically short of
doctors, reports WHO. Doctor-population
ratios vary from one doctor per 400 persons
to one per 10,000 in most of the region.
About 3,200 doctors graduate annually, but
60 more schools would be required
to meet present health needs, and 160
additional schools will be needed in the
next 30 years to keep ahead of the
population explosion. Another serious
problem is the "brain drain" of foreign-
trained doctors who fail to return to their
own countries.

Flashes..,
Fifty per cent of the world's annual
potential food production Is lost through
wastage, reports FAO. If these losses
were reduced by even 10 per cent there
would be enough food and protein to give
everyone in the world an adequate diet.
Total circulation of Indian newspagers
has almost doubled in the last decade.
Over 600 dailies are published, 40 per cent
of them in Delhi and six other major
Indian cities.
The current world fish catch is only
5 per cent of the 1,800 million tons of
marine life that could be harvested from
the oceans, according to scientists at Ja¬
pan's Marine Research Bureau.
Ninety per cent of the world's initial
supply of recoverable petroleum liquids
and natural gas will be used up within
the next 65 years, according to studies
by a special committee of the Nal'.onal
Research Council of the U.S. Academy
of Sciences.

NESC
1970
INTERNATIONAL
EDUCATION YEAR
Message
from Mr. René Maheu
Director-General of Unesco
At the beginning of the New Year, I should like to remind all the
countries of the world that, at the suggestion of Unesco, the General
Assembly of the United Nations has designated 1970 as INTERNA¬
TIONAL EDUCATION YEAR; and I would ask them to do everything
in their power from now on to make this a year of significant achieve¬
ment, both qualitative and quantitative, in the field of education.
In many countries, at the present time, both the forms and the
content of education are being seriously challenged. Instead of indulg¬
ing the illusion that controversies and passions will eventually die down,
we shall do better to make a bold attempt to understand and grapple
with the crisis a crisis in which we should, moreover, discern not so
much the threat of some unthinkable collapse as the promise of a neces¬
sary renaissance.

We live in a world that is changing before our very eyes a world
in which the population explosion, decolonization and the profound eco¬
nomic and social transformations resulting from technological develop¬
ment are so many forces making for the democratization of education.
At the same time the acceleration of scientific progress is resulting in the
more and more rapid obsolescence of knowledge, while the development
of mass communication techniques and audio-visual methods is revolu¬
tionizing the traditional bases of communication. With all this it is out
of the question for education to be confined, as in the past, to training
the leaders of tomorrow's society in accordance with some predetermin¬
ed scheme of structures, needs and ideas, or to preparing the young, once
and for all, for a given type of existence. Education is no longer the pri¬
vilege of an elite or the task of a particular age; to an increasing extent,
it is reaching out to embrace the whole of society and the entire life-span
of the individual. This means that it must be continuous and omnipre¬
sent. It must no longer be thought of as preparation for life, but as a
dimension of life, characterized by continual acquisition of knowledge
and ceaseless re-examination of ideas.
**
But how is education to broaden its bounds in this way if it remains
divided in its internal organization and isolated as a whole from life and
society? Not only are the various elements involved in the educational
process often poorly integrated, but education as such is still all too often
cut off from the rest of human activity. In too many cases, the school,
the college and the university, far from living at one with the community,
constitute worlds of their own.
That an electronic engineer for example should have no properly
organized means of sharing his knowledge with those of his colleagues,
friends and neighbours who would like to bring their information up to
date; that an educational establishment should be used for a maximum
of only two hundred days in the year, and then for eight hours a day at
the very most; that young people who have studied for several years at

school or university should be unable to turn the skills they have acquired
to account on the labour market because they have failed in some com¬
petitive or other examination: all this is waste waste of material resour¬
ces, waste of human potential which must no longer be tolerated any¬
where, and least of all in the developing countries.
And since I have referred to those countries, how can I pass over in
silence the most scandalous of all the many instances of wasted human
potential: namely, illiteracy, which still, at the present time, keeps more
than one-third of the human race in a state of helplessness, below the level
of modern civilization? When shall we make up our minds to eliminate
this scourge from the face of the earth?

**
These are the sort of problems to which the world community is
invited to address itself on the occasion of INTERNATIONAL EDU¬
CATION YEAR, in order that bold and inventive solutions may be found
and applied. And it is towards the universal and life-long education I
have referred to that Unesco asks governments, institutions and individuals
to direct the necessary effort of reflection and promotion.
No one can be blind to the immense difficulties of the structural and
intellectual conversion that this idea of life-long education implies if it is
not to be allowed to sink in a bog of empty verbiage. For what is needed
is nothing less than the organic integration of school and university edu¬
cation with out-of-school education and adult education two branches
which, even today, are all too often regarded as peripheral when it is
obvious, if we take an overall view, that they are bound to play an essen¬
tial part in the continuing and many-sided moulding of the human mind.
Naturally, no one supposes that all this can be achieved, anywhere, in the
course of a single year. But the time has come for all of us to advance
boldly together along this path, which is the path of the future of mankind.
The great crises of education have always coincided with profound
changes in society and in civilization. I believe that we are approaching

one of those moments in history. The need for new human models, both
for society and for the individual, is making itself felt almost everywhere.
And while inventions of such complexity are beyond the power of edu¬
cation alone, we all realize that without education they would be quite
impossible. For, when all is said and done, no progress has reality or
meaning for man except in so far as it is projected and reflected in his
education.
It is therefore in the name of the right of every human being to edu¬
cation, as a right to progress and renewal, that I declare INTERNA¬
TIONAL EDUCATION YEAR open and appeal to peoples for that
generous emulation and to States for that beneficent co-operation on
which its success depends.

PARTNERS IN DEVELOPMENT
The widening gap between the developed and the developing countries has become
a central issue of our time. An entirely new approach to the whole problem of aid
and development, seen not in terms of one nation or group of nations, but as a global
co-operative effort of the rich and poor nations, the highly-industrialized and the
developing nations, has now been put forward in the Pearson Report entitled "Part¬
ners in Development." Photo shows a development project in the Sudan carried out
with the help of the World Bank and the International Development Association who
made available loans and credits totalling 32.5 million dollars. Photo United Nation*
