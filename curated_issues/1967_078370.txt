This unique figure of a Buddhist
altar attendant was carved in Korea
during the late Yi Dynasty (18th-
19th) century. Thirty inches high
and made of polychrome wood,
it is now in the Honolulu Academy
of Arts, Hawaii. No other similar
figure, either in Korea or elsewhere,
exists today comparable with it
either in size or quality. Such
statues were placed in pairs on
either side and in front of the
Buddha in provincial temples of
Korea. This one originally held a
bird in its hands.

One hundred years ago a woman who
was to become one of the most
illustrious scientists of our century was
born in Warsaw. Maria Sklodowska, or
Marie Curie as the world was to know
her, dedicated her entire life passionately
and unselfishly to science and above
all to the completely new science of
radioactivity, of which she was one of
the pioneers (see page 14). The
"Unesco Courier" has asked a
distinguished Polish physicist, Leopold
Infeld, and a French woman scientist,
Marguerite Perey, who worked for
several years with Marie Curie, to
recount the early life of this woman
of genius (page 20) and the closing
years of her work for science (page 23).

Mount Bezimlanyi "explodes". This
"extinct" volcano (its name signifies
"unnamed") on the Kamchatka
Peninsula, to the east of Siberia, was
considered unimportant by
volcanologists who focused their
attention on strongly active volcanoes
in the region. Suddenly, on March 30,
1956, a tremendous explosion blew
the top off Bezimianyi, hurtling debris
40 kilometres (25 miles) into the air
at a speed of over 1,000 km/h
(700 mph) and devastating 1,000 sq.km.
(400 sq. miles) of forest. This photo
was taken from 45 km. away.

THE MENACE
OF 'EXTINCT'
VOLCANOES
by Haroun Tazieff
In the almost twenty years I have been travelling
around the world trying to get to know something
about the most splendid and violent spectacle that
nature has to offer, I have gradually become
convinced of something that laymen and even
professional geologists and volcanologists usually
ignore, and it fills me with dreadthe prospect,
some day soon, of unheard-of volcanic catastrophes.
4
HAROUN TAZIEFF, Belgian geologist and
volcanologist, is well known to our readers
(see the "Unesco Courier", October 1963;
November 1965). He is the author of many
scientific publications and several popular
science books and has produced a number
of prize-winning scientific and documentary
films on volcanic eruptions. This text is
taken from a study published in Unesco's
quarterly, "Impact of Science on Society",
No 2, 1967 (annual subscription $2,50; 13/-).
You may perhaps imagine that only
the stupid outbreak of nuclear war
could cause the deaths of a hundred
thousand, five hundred thousand, or
a million people within a few minutes,
but you would be wrong; wrong, be¬
cause, ' as geological evidence has
finally convinced me, humanity has so
far been fantastically lucky and the
catastrophes of Pompeii and St. Pierre
de la Martinique are nothing to what
awaits it.
A loss of thirty thousand, forty
thousand people killed by the blast of
a volcano these were already bad
enough; but these were small towns
compared with the enormous modern
cities threatened at closer or longer
range by a volcanic outburst Naples
and Rome, Portland and Seattle, Mexi¬
co City, Bandung, Sapporo, Oakland,
Catania, Clermont-Ferrand. . .
Yes indeed! Rome, Portland, Cler¬
mont-Ferrand: volcanoes regarded as
well and truly extinct near these cities
are dead only to eyes that cannot or
will not see. Men, as we all know,
have short memories. Political or
natural, catastrophes cease to worry
them almost as soon as over, and
teach them little. A volcano may be
less than a century dormant and
people almost cease altogether to
think of it as such; all the more so
if a thousand years or more has pas¬
sed.
But volcanoes are geologically live:
time, for them, is counted not in years
or even in centuries, but in millenia and
tens of millenia. The thousand-year
sleep that is nothing to them is an
eternity to men living under their
shadow the volcanoes of the Massif

Central in France, those of Latium,
of the Cascade Range in Oregon, and
of California (although the latter had
numerous, if "not major,, eruptions
throughout the last century, and even
as recently as 1916 in the case of
Lassen Peak).
But Clermont-Ferrand, Rome?. Com¬
pletely forgotten by the inhabitants,
the fact remains that only a few mil¬
lenia separate us from the last erup¬
tions. In the course of their lifetimes,
millions of years long, there must have
been many lulls, for dozens or even
hundreds of centuries, and there are
really no grounds for supposing that
the present calm signifies the end of
the volcano's activity rather than a
period of repose. Obviously the very
length of these quiet periods is hope¬
ful; centuries, hundreds of centuries
might pass and Clermont-Ferrand,
Rome or Seattle not be wiped out.
But the interval might be much less.
The two most violent eruptions of
the twentieth century occurred at appa¬
rently extinct volcanoes; the first at
the Katmai volcano in Alaska from
June 6 to 8, 1912, the second at the
Bezimianyi Sopka in the Kam
chatka peninsula on March 30, 1956.
Relatively little was. known about Kat¬
mai and its neighbouring volcanoes,
but ten years ago it was thought that
there remained little to learn about
the volcanic chain around ' the Bezi¬
mianyi volcano indeed, Klyuchi, hard¬
ly- 50 kilometres away, is one of
the best-known volcanological obser¬
vatories. Nevertheless, and despite
intensive study of the strongly active
volcanoes in the area, no importance
was attached to this insignificant
"extinct" cone, its very name, "Unnam¬
ed" emphasizing its insignificance.
The explosion of March 30, 1956
blew the top off the mountain, hurtling
debris 40,000 metres into the air, blast¬
ing down the forests at its base, and
snapping tree trunks like matchwood
up to 20 kilometres away. As in
Alaska forty-four years earlier, no-one
was killed, but only because these
regions are practically uninhabited.
What would happen in six months, six
years or sixty times six years if a
cataclysm on this scale were to strike
Java or Japan?
In fact such a cataclysm did occur,
although fortunately on a smaller
scale, about fifteen years ago in New
Guinea. In this case it was not even
known. that the mountain was a volca¬
no; Mount Lamington, near the eastern
end of New Guinea, had been regarded
as just an ordinary mountain until the
day when, on January 16, 1951, a thin
column of vapour was seen rising from
its summit. The next day slight earth
tremors were noticed around the foot
of the mountain. The escapes of gas
and the tremors increased during the
next two days, and a small amount
of ash was ejected.
On January 20, the eruption had be¬
come spectacular; the wreath of ashes
reached up over 10,000 metres into the
sky and rumblings were heard, some¬
times dozens of kilometres away
On Sunday January 21, the volcano
was roaring continuously and at 10.40
a.m. it exploded: a fearsome wreath
of convoluting clouds of gas, spilling
ash, lapilli and blocks, shot up to a
height of 15,000 metres in a matter
of seconds and formed a huge mush¬
room cloud, while a glowing ava¬
lanche spread over the ground with
the same terrifying speed. Two hun¬
dred and fifty square kilometres of

Rome, Mexico City, Oakland, Seattle, Bandung, Catania,
Sapporo, Clermont-Ferrand... on the waiting list
countryside were laid waste, and 3,000
people killed.
I have tried to intimate to readers
my anxiety about supposedly extinct
volcanoes; but there is another, yet
more terrifying menace: the menace
of ignimbrite flows.
There has only been one ignimbrite
eruption in historic times. It was rela¬
tively moderate. I say relatively be¬
cause it nevertheless covered a sur¬
face some 30 kilometres long by 5 kilo¬
metres wide with a layer on average
100 metres deep, which, if spread over
the whole of Paris would bury it nearly
10 metres deep. This was the eruption
which created the Valley of Ten
Thousand Smokes in Alaska in 1912
to which I alluded earlier.
The geological history of the earth
is, however, full of really colossal
ignimbrite escapes in which thousands
and tens of thousands of square kilo¬
metres have been suddenly engulfed
beneath suffocating clouds of gas and
avalanches of incandescent sand.
T
6
HERE are ' a great many
sheets of ignimbrites in New Zealand,
where they were described for the first
time some thirty years ago, and there
are also many in the United States and
Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union,
Kenya, Chad, Sumatra and Central
America, Latin America, Iran and
Turkey.
All these were the result of sudden,
almost lightning-fast escapes of mag¬
ma, supersaturated with gas, which,
after forcing open a long fissure, spurt¬
ed up and spread out, allowing for
differences of scale, somewhat like
milk boiling over from a saucepan. It
is almost certain that speeds of over
100, perhaps even 300, kilometres an
hour were reached, and the very nature
of the material spewed out in this
way with droplets of lava, vitreous
fragments of exploded bubbles and
incandescent fragments of pumice
suspended in the released gas made
it so fluid that it was able to spread
over immense areas, immediately wip¬
ing out all life.
As already indicated, the only ignim¬
brite eruption known to have occurred
in the world in historic times is that
of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.
This name was given to the valley by
Robert Griggs when, after great effort,
he and his team arrived in 1917, five
years after the eruption, at the head
of the Katmai Pass and discovered the
extraordinary expanse of salmon-pink
and golden sand from which innu¬
merable jets of high-pressure steam
were rising, thousands of fumaroles
caused partly by the rivers and streams
trapped under the thick sheet of burn¬
ing ignimbrite sands, and partly by
the magma gases still imprisoned in
the sands.
Fifty years to the day after the erup¬
tion, on June 6, 1962, it was the turn
of my friends the geologists Marinelli,
Bordet and Mittempergher and myself
to arrive in this fabulous valley: only
three or four columns of steam still
rose lazily at the top end of the valley,
towards Novarupta, the small volcano
whose detonations marked the end
of the cataclysm.
We gazed for a long while at this
tawny wilderness, stretching away
astonishingly flat within its ring of
mountains. But behind the wonder
aroused by this austere beauty, behind
the geological interest, behind our
discussions of how the ignimbrites
came to be there, there lay the inesca¬
pable thought that an eruption of this
type might very well occur in the near
future, not this time in a desert as in
the Alaskan peninsula or the Tibesti
Massif of the Sahara, but in some
overpopulated part of the globe for
there are recent ignimbrites throughout
Latium and California, throughout Japan
and Indonesia.
This is what I have in mind when
I speak of the possibility, or rather
the probability, of volcanic catastro¬
phes involving a million or even
several million deaths. Like a giant
land-mine under our feet, this danger
threatens vast areas of the globe,
including a number of countries which
believe themselves safe from volcanic
perils.
Governments, whether "advanced"
or "developing", are obviously not
worried, primarily because of ignor¬
ance, but also through lack of fore¬
sight. Thus, as soon as we arrived
in a country on a volcanological inves¬
tigation mission, the local authorities
have sometimes submitted the most
preposterous projects to us, not merely
revealing a complete misunderstand¬
ing of what an eruption is but even
proposing methods for slowing or
stopping it or for harnessing its energy
for industrial use; we have really had
the greatest trouble in convincing
them that their beautiful plans were
scatter-brained.
During a recent mission to a country
where an eruption had gone on conti¬
nuously for a year, we could see as
soon as we visited the volcano an un¬
mistakable threat to the inhabited
areas around its base; as soon as the
rainy season started, the valleys would
be swept by torrents of volcanic mud,
the terrible lahars which year in and
year out claim thousands of victims
throughout the world.
Civil engineers should have set to
work months beforehand to protect the
population, building embankments to
divert the thrust of the liquid mud
pouring down at 50 or 60 kilometres
an hour.
As nothing of the sort had been
done, all that remained was to keep
a watch on the upper slopes of the
mountain where the lahars would start,
and get the people ready to evacuate
the threatened regions calmly and in
good order at any moment of the day
or night. I accordingly put a plan to
the authorities but could see straight
away that it evoked no enthusiasm
whatsoever.
After a fortnight, my friend Ivan
Elskens, the expedition's chemist, final¬
ly came up with a psychological expla¬
nation. Whatever a government may do
to avoid a . catastrophe, natural or
otherwise, it will still be criticized by
the opposition. Why lay oneself open
particularly since, whatever efforts
are made, it is almost certain that they
will not be totally successful, volca¬
nological forecasting being at present
no more foolproof than weather fore¬
casting (although it seems as absurd
not to attempt it as not to attempt to
forecast the weather)? Natural catas¬
trophes being, by the nature of
things, beyond the power of govern¬
ments, governments are unwilling to
chance their funds on undertakings
which simple prudence would dictate.
This is, I think, the reason why offi¬
cial contributions to volcanological
research have been, except in the case
of Japan, so insignificant. Earthquake
forecasting, which is much more diffi¬
cult' than the forecasting of eruptions,
receives equally little encouragement.
The authorities try to forget disasters
as quickly as possible: despite the
destruction of San Francisco in 1906,
the richest and most powerful country
in the world had to wait sixty years,
until the Anchorage disaster of 1964,
before it was decided to invest in the
necessary seismological equipment
and try to forecast future cataclysms.
A
FEW more examples like
Krakatoa, St. Pierre de la Martinique,
or Pompeii will probably be necessary
before the decision is made to set up
observatories which would make it
possible to forecast the awakening of
"extinct" volcanoes and the opening
of fissures from which ignimbrite flows
escape.
Providing the indispensable minimum
of funds are allocated, it should be
easier today to forecast the awakening
of a volcano than to forecast the wea¬
ther. This is, alas, still far from being
the case. Forecasting depends on de¬
tecting significant fluctuations in a
series of physical and chemical para¬
meters. The difficulty lies in interpret¬
ing the changes observed; some of
the parameters at times speak a rela-

The 30,000 inhabitants of Pompeii
and the 6,000 of neighbouring
Herculanum were taken completely
unawares when Mount Vesuvius
began to erupt in earnest on an August
morning in the year 79 A.D. Pompeii
had just finished reconstructing
most of its buildings, devastated in
the earthquake which ravaged the
city 17 years earlier. When the hail
of volcanic ash and pumice descended
on the city, some people sought
refuge in their homes while most fled
across the countryside. Thousands
succumbed. The city remained buried
for 18 centuries until it was gradually
dug out. Today, Pompeii, like
Herculanum, presents the dramatic
spectacle of a powerful Roman
city in the grip of fear and death.
Plaster moulds of the cavities left in
the ashes after bodies had mouldered
into dust show the postures of people
at the moment they were killed by
fumes, ashes and debris. Below,

Eruption forecasting could be easier
than predicting the weather
at the stage of
the causes and
mechanism of
tively comprehensible language while
others remain, for the present at least,
indecipherable.
Since we are still
conjecture regarding
consequently the
eruptions, these variation which mod;
em techniques make it possible to
measure cannot really be understood
nor, therefore, can their meaning be
interpreted with certainty.
But there is a gradual improvement,
and successful forecasts of impending
activity have several times been made,
the best example being the eruption of
Kilauea in December 1959-January
1960: seismographs had given notice
of the awakening of the volcano nearly
six months before it erupted.
Thanks to their excellent observa¬
tion network on Hawaii and on Kilauea
itself, scientists of the volcanological
observatory were able to determine
the focal depth of the tremors: about
50 kilometres, which is suprising
enough for volcanic seismic effects, the
hypocentre of which is usually localiz¬
ed less than 5 kilometres below the
surface, and still more surprising in
Hawaii where the lower limit of the
earth's crust itself is only 15 kilo¬
metres below sea level.
In the following weeks, the volcano¬
logists noted that the focal depth was
getting less and less and by measur¬
ing the speed of the rise they pro¬
duced an estimate of the time it would
take for this depth to be reduced to
zero, i.e., when the magma would erupt
at the surface.
As the measurements continued the
coefficient of error due to extrapolation
was reduced. A network of field seis¬
mographs was brought into service in
addition to the fixed network, allowing
high-precision determination of the

epicentres, i.e., the zones where the
eruption was likely to take place (with
this vast shield volcano, eruptions can
occur equally well in the area of the
central crater or up to 10 or 20 kilo¬
metres away on the slopes of the
mountain).
As the tremors increased in number
and intensity, the whole volcano
swelled, probably under the pressure
of the rising magma the angles and
directions of this tumescence, which
is otherwise quite imperceptible, can
be accurately measured with the aid of
instruments know as tiltmeters or clino¬
meters.
Thus, by carefully following the evo¬
lution of phenomena which had long
been known to be closely connected
with the rise of the magma, the scien¬
tists at Hawaii Observatory were able
to predict with unprecedented accu¬
racy the exact point the Kilauea Iki
crater and moment where the erup¬
tion would take place.
They went even better: when the
eruption stopped after three weeks of
violent and spectacular activity, not
only were they able to state that it
had not finished and would start again,
but were even able to say that this
would happen 15 kilometres away near
the small village of Kapoho. As a
result, it was possible to evacuate the
population and even' all their movable
belongings before the earth gaped
open to release the gas and incandes¬
cent lava which was to destroy the
houses and fields.
Unfortunately, it is not always so
easy to interpret seismograph and cli¬
nometer data. The behaviour of
volcanoes of the Hawaian type is rela¬
tively straightforward, but that of most
of the others is not particularly the
dangerously explosive stratified cones
which abound in the circum-Pacific
"ring of fire". These latter are, how¬
ever, up to now at least, the subject
of the most wary observation, since
more than half of the paltry dozen
volcanological observatories which
exist are concentrated here, most of
them in Japan, one in Kamchatka and
another in New Britain (lar9est island
of the Bismarck Archipelago to the
east of New Guinea).
There is as yet no means of knowing
exactly why eruptions of one type are
fairly predictable and why others defy
forecasting. The difference appears to
depend on the nature of the magma,
on its chemical composition, its visco¬
sity, its content in dissolved gases,
and perhaps even its origins.
Let us accept for the moment the
theory that the substance emitted by
basaltic volcanoes comes from a deep
magma, highly fluid and relatively poor
in gases and everywhere present be¬
neath the earth's crust, whilst the
circum-Pacific volcanoes are fed by
limited magma chambers, strung out
along narrow zones and consisting of
pockets, within the crust itself, of
molten rocks whose composition gives
the substance a high viscosity and a
high gas content. It is then easy to
see that the eruptive processes of
these different types of magma will
be different and so, therefore, will be
the premonitory signs which make it
possible to predict them.
To reach the surface and erupt, a
fluid magma coming up from the depths
of the earth has to force its way
through kilometres of rock, thus open¬
ing fissures first in the depths of the
earth and then higher and higher as it
rises, or widening existing conduits.
When it finally reaches the last few
kilometres, this new intruded material
produces a swelling in the configura¬
tion of the volcano itself and it ¡s
this which the seismographs and tilt-
meters register: the tremors accom¬
panying the opening of the fractures,
and the tumescence of the mountain
itself.
The magmas of the circum-Pacific
.chain are a different matter. Probably
starting life at lesser depths with the
melting of sediments within the earth's
crust itself, rich in silica and water,
they are both viscous and gas-super-
satured.
Before going any further, I would
like to point out that although these
ideas are based on geological evi¬
dence, they are nevertheless only a
hypothesis, and the evidence could be
interpreted in different ways. We know
a lot less about the inside of our own
planet than about outer space a para¬
dox that has various explanations; part¬
ly the nature of cosmic and terrestrial
matter, but also the incredible dis¬
proportion in the sums allocated for
these two different kinds of research.
The inadequacy of the funds allocat¬
ed for the study of the interior of
the earth shows once again how under¬
estimated is the importance of such
research.
Even from the utilitarian point of
view, the future of mankind lies here on
earth. Mankind will have to dig deeper
and deeper into the earth to find min¬
eral deposits when those at the sur¬
face have been exhausted, but the
old empirical methods of finding them
will no longer do, and they will have to
be located before drilling even starts;
for this we shall need more positive
theories concerning the origin of these
deposits than those we make do with
at present, and we shall find them
only if we go and look for fresh data
in the depths of the earth itself.
Accepting the hypothesis that the

circumLPacific magmas do not stretch
round the whole globe in a continuous
layer beneath the earth's crust but form
pockets within the crust, that because
of their viscosity, their mobility is
extremely low, and that they contain
a high quantity of dissolved gases, we
can understand why seismographs and
tiltmeters cannot, as in the case of
basaltic volcanoes, clearly warn of the
approach of an eruption.
If such be indeed the case, the
magma would normally be quite near
to the surface and the seismic effects
accompanying any possible rise of the
magma would not be distinguishable,
as in the case of Hawaii, by their focal
depth from the tremors due to various
causes which are constantly occurring
in the upper kilometres of any active
volcano.
Moreover, this magma is often so
viscous that the speed of its rise is
greatly reduced, if not nil. The seismic
effects connected with the rise of the
nragma may thus be lost among ordi¬
nary earth tremors, making it very dif¬
ficult if not impossible for the seismo¬
logist to distinguish genuine fore-
shocks. Tiltmeter readings would be
equally useless: the volcano will ob¬
viously not swell unless matter is rising
up inside, it.
How do these volcanoes erupt at
all if there is little or no rise of the
lava from the magma chamber towards
the surface? It may be that the action
of the gases alone is responsible.
Years or centuries may pass and
as yet we have no means of telling
from the surface of the earth that this
slow concentration of endogenic ener¬
gy is going on. As a result, such a
crater will soon come to be classified
as belonging to an extinct volcano
and we know the terrifying conse¬
quences which. this may have.
In these circumstances, how can
we forecast a renewal of activity? In
the first place, at the risk of repeat¬
ing myself, I would say that we must
get it into our heads that whatever the
type of volcano, magma or activity con¬
cerned, we shall never be able to pre¬
dict anything with any accuracy unless
a constant watch is kept by a specia¬
lized team.
Once this has been established, and
accepting the theory that the violent
explosions of volcanoes of the circum-
Pacific type are in fact the result of
the accumulation of gases under the
roof of the chamber, it would seem
logical to look for significant signs in
possible changes in the fumaroles
which the crater exhales to a grea'ter
or less extent and which have their
origins inside the pocket of incubating
lava. Changes discovered in this way
may not always be easy to interpret
in so far as they can be interpreted
at all but logically they must hold a
clue to what is going on down below.
T
HE temperature of some
fumaroles has been recorded for a long
time back, on the logical assumption
that the temperature will rise as an
eruption approaches. However, with
acid volcanoes at least, this method of
detecting an eruption has had practical¬
ly no success. This is not surprising if
we accept the theory that explosive
eruptions are the result of the building
up of gas pressure and not of the rise
of magma, since it is essentially the
latter which determines the rise in
temperature.
We are thus left with the chemical
composition of fumaroles, which ought
to depend on the deep-lying processes
mentioned above. The reflection of
these processes in the chemistry of
the fumarole gases should provide
valuable information.
Observation of a dormant volcano
may not require analyses at very close
intervals, but the development of the
chemical composition and pressure of
the fumaroles should at least be follow¬
ed step by step. Since only gases are
involved, this alone might yield warn¬
ing signs, however slight, by which to
detect renewed volcanic activity. But
the best hope for a better understand¬
ing of volcanic activity, and, hence, of
developing volcanological forecasting
is to make a close study of the varia¬
tions, both sudden and gradual, in
the gases given off from the mouth of
an active volcano sampled at a fixed
point.
This is the job with which we have
been particularly concerned; to try and
analyse the volcanic gases as nearly
continuously as possible, and to look
for warning signs in the variation in
their composition and in the compari¬
son between this variation and varia¬
tions detected by other means such
as the seismograph and the clinometer.
The first samples of gas taken by
our group were analysed in a labo¬
ratory by Dr. Marcel Chaigneau, direc¬
tor of the Gas Laboratory at the Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique
in Paris, using the Lebeau and Damiens
method over a mercury trough. The
results were extremely accurate but
the operations took so long that, with
the resources at our disposal (i.e.,
without special volcanological staff or

MOST
TERRIFYING
ERUPTION
OF ALL
The most formidable form
of volcanic activity is
an ignimbrite eruption. It
results from the sudden,
almost lightning-fast
escape of magma which,
after opening up a long
fissure in the ground,
bursts forth and spreads
out over a vast area, then
cools to form a solid
crust. Though such
incandescent "tidal waves"
were once common, only
one has occurred in
historic times. This
happened in Alaska
55 years ago, fortunately
in an uninhabited region,
and created what is now
called the Valley of Ten
Thousand Smokes. Left, at
the bottom of this valley,
glacier-like formations
mark the extremity of the
ignimbrite flow. Right, a
cliff of solidified magma

330 feet in height).

equipment) no more than two or three
series of analyses could have been
carried out in a year. The problems
to be solved in fact require the results
of hundreds of analyses for, primarily,
what we are trying to do is to detect
and follow up variations in composition
which we intuitively feel to be im¬
portant.
It was at this point that two chem¬
ists in our team1, Dr. I. Elskens of
the University of Brussels, and
Dr. F. Tonani, of the University of
Florence, rightly pointed out that the
high degree of accuracy obtained over
a mercury trough was not absolutely
necessary for our purposes, since it
was more important to detect varia¬
tions and establish relationships bet¬
ween the various constituents than to
know their exact composition.
By adopting a new industrial pro¬
cess used for quantitative analysis
of traces of gas in offices and facto¬
ries, we were able to do two analyses
a minute and on one occasion when
the explosive activity was favourable
(i.e., strong enough and at the same
time so directed that it was possibíe
to get near to the erupting mouth)
we were able to spend more than
two hours inside the crater of Strom-
boli itself and carry out a long series
of tests, mainly to determine the
amounts of water and carbon dioxide
present and with the subsidiary aim
of determining the hydrochloric acid
content. Although we expected to find
fluctuations, the range and rapidity
of those we did discover amazed us.
The carbon dioxide content went
from 0 to 25 per cent in less than
3 minutes and that of water vapour
from 0 to 45 per cent in a similar
time and even from 20 to 50 per cent
in a few seconds, that is it more than
doubled almost instantaneously.
With the hazardous and uncomfort¬
able conditions under which we were
working, it was difficult, in addition to
taking samples, to note with accuracy
the timing of eruptive effects and parti¬
cularly of explosions. It would seem
however, that there is a close con¬
nexion between variations in water and
carbon dioxide content and the explo¬
sive activity of the volcano, although
we still do not have sufficient data to
draw firm conclusions.
Continuous sampling at very fre¬
quent intervals is thus absolutely nec¬
essary for a proper study of the prob¬
lems of eruptive activity. On the other
hand, a watch can be kept quite satis¬
factorily on the fumaroles escaping
from a dormant crater, which are ob¬
viously subject to infinitely slower
varations, by less frequent analyses,
the development curve being deter¬
mined from points obtained at intervals
of only one a month or even less.
B UT to reach an understand¬
ing of the mechanism of eruptions
proper, even our new procedure is in¬
sufficient, particularly since it is un¬
usual to be able to stay more than a
few minutes or even seconds at a time
in a really active crater. In fact the
memorable "Operation Stromboli," dur¬
ing which we had several times been
peppered with incandescent projectiles
(from which our fibreglass helmets
gave us very good protection), ended
more or less in a scramble for safety
after three hours when, following an
explosion which had produced a parti¬
cularly large number of projectiles, the
rubber soles on the boots of the most
intrepid volcanologist that I know,
Franco Tonani, caught fire. We took
the hint and left.
Ivan Elskens, who quite properly be¬
lieves that the mouth of a volcano is no
place for any man in his right mind,
decided thereupon to apply himself
to the realization of our old dream
of an instrument capable of carrying
out continuous and automatic samp¬
ling and analysis of the volcanic gases
and transmitting the results to a
recording meter situated at a respect¬
ful distance from the crater. "Then you
can go and mess about near the
craters as much as you like," Elskens
told us, "and I will make myself com¬
fortable with a glaás of beer and a
book and just look up from time to
time to keep an eye on the meter."
In actual fact, in three years, with
the assistance of an electronics expert,
Mr. Bara, he succeeded in develop¬
ing this instrument. On August 29,
1966, on the slopes of the north-east
bocea of Etna, Elskens, albeit without
a glass of beer, used his field tele-
chromatograph for the first time,
measuring, to start with, a single cons¬
tituent of the volcanic gas and record¬
ing by remote control the variations
in the carbon dioxide content of gases
issuing at a temperature of 1,000°
from a vent which was belching out
molten lava.
It is too early yet to talk about the
results of this operation or predict the
potential of the new instrument, but
I am sure that a very important step
forward has been made and that the u *
simultaneous recording of two such I I
fundamental parameters as seismic
activity and the composition of the
gas given off by an erupting volcano

MENACE OF 'EXTINCT* VOLCANOES (Continued)
Research fundsthe weapon
most lacking to volcanologists
will enable us to understand this mys¬
terious phenomenon infinitely better
than hitherto.
I would like also to mention the
two other new aids to observation
and forecasting. One resembles the
tiltmeter but provides more easily
interpretable data than tilt variations
which, especially with volcanoes of
the circum-Pacific type, are often mis¬
leading.
The method consists of measuring
the diameter of a crater by means of
a tellurometer. Robert W. Decker,
whose idea it was, measured the dia¬
meter of Kilauea at fairly close inter¬
vals and discovered that it was increas¬
ing continuously and quite noticeably
right up to the time of eruption.
Before instruments were available
to measure distances of up to several
tens of kilometres very accurately and
very rapidly, such operations were
much too slow and expensive to be
of practical value in volcanology. It
is now quite possible that the Decker
method will produce results greatly
superior to those obtained by clino¬
meters.
The second method, used for long-
range forecasting (several months to,
perhaps, several years), is based on
a hypothesis deduced by Mr. C. Blot,
head of the geophysics section at the
ORSTOM Centre, Noumea (New Cal¬
edonia), from the relationship which
appears to exist between certain deep
(550 to 650 kilometres below the sur¬
face) and intermediary (150 to 250 kilo¬
metres) seismic effects, and certain
eruptions in the New Hebrides archi¬
pelago.

INCE submitting the first
of his observations at the
Assembly of the International
Union of Geodesy and Geophysics at
Berkeley in August 1963, Blot has been
applying the relationships which he has
discovered -to attempted forecasts of
the volcanic eruptions in the region of
the New Hebrides. In the last three
years, the volcanoes Gaua, Ambrym
and Lopévi all resumed strong activity
on dates forecast months in advance.
In collaboration with Mr. J. Grover,
chief of geological survey, Solomon
Islands, it has been possible to extend
these studies and forecasts to the vol¬
canoes of the Santa Cruz and Solo¬
mon Islands (Tinakula and various
underwater volcanoes).
At the last Pacific Scientific Con¬
gress in Tokyo, September 1966, Blot
and Grover presented a paper setting
out the results of these forecasts of
volcanic eruptions in the south-west
Pacific which ended a follows:
"It seems more and more likely that
a relationship exists between deep
seismic effects, intermediary effects
and volcanic eruptions. The relation¬
ship between deep effects and erup¬
tions cannot be a direct one, since
explosions and lava flows do not ori¬
ginate at depths of 400 to 700 kilo¬
metres.
"However, a certain alteration in
tensions or an abrupt change of phase
at these depths could set off a thermo-
energy phenomenon which in zones
where the critical physical conditions
obtain, particularly under the volcanic
arcs could cause other rapid changes
producing intermediary seismic effects
at depths between 250 and 60 kilo¬
metres, depending on the regional
tectonics. These would be the zones
in the upper mantle where the molten
pockets occur and where magma
forms and where, according to the
views of, for example, Dr. Shimozuru
and Dr. Gorshkov, volcanic eruptions
originate.
"By observing seismic activity in a
given area following the start of deep
seismic effects and by the detection
and localization of intermediary effects
beneath volcanic areas, it will be
possible to keep a closer watch on
one sector or one volcano several
months before a possible eruption."
The relationships discovered in the
New Hebrides and, with increasing
frequency, throughout the Pacific show
that there may be a constant interval
between the beginnings of phenomena
at different levels right up to the sur¬
face, if the depth, distances and inten¬
sities of these phenomena and other,
still somewhat indeterminate tectonic,
physical and chemical factors can be
taken into account.
These intervals appear to be, on
average, from 10 to 14 months between
the 650 and 200 kilometre levels (along
the line of the 60° inclination of the
deep structures of the Pacific arcs)
and from 4 to 8 months between the
intermediary seismic effects 200 kilo¬
metres beneath the volcanoes and the
actual eruptions.
If this theory proves true, it would
be of the utmost value for the fore¬
casting of possible cataclysms. So
far it has not been possible to verify
it thoroughly outside the New Hebri¬
des area and, even there, it is a little
early yet to draw any final conclusions
regarding the reality of these rela¬
tionships.
Though some questions remain to
be answered about the mechanical,
physical and chemical processes which
determine the upward propagation of
endogenic energy at a speed of some
hundreds of kilometres a year from
the depths up to the neck of a vol¬
cano, this link, if it really exists, will
certainly be one of the basic criteria
in volcanological forecasting in the
future.

KILAUEA, THE HELPFUL

Kilauea, on the Pacific island of Hawaii, gives due warning of its eruptions. It is one of the few volcanoes whose
behaviour has so far facilitated early forecasts of impending activity. Its eruption in December 1959 was foreseen six
months earlier thanks to recorded data which volcanologists used to predict with unprecedented accuracy the place and
time of the eruption, thus enabling the local population to be evacuated in time. Photo shows lake of molten lava
that fills the Kilauea crater (10 sq. km.: 4 sq. miles in area).

MARIE CURIE
The life of a woman
dedicated to science
The story of the life of Marie Curie recounted below is
taken from "Madame Curie", the biography written by her
daughter Eve Curie, translated into English by Vincent
Sheean and published and © 1937 by Doubleday, Doran
and Co., Inc, Garden City, New York. Drawing on docu¬
ments, narratives and recollections of Marie Curie's contem¬
poraries, and on the personal notes, letters and journals of
Pierre and Marie Curie, the book evokes with insight and
understanding the personality, astonishing career and
scientific achievements of a woman of whom her daughter
wrote: "She did not know how to be famous".

IN a night pierced with
whistles, clanking and rattling, a fourth-
class carriage made its way through
Germany. The carriage had no proper
seats. Crouched down on a folding
chair Maria Sklodowska, whom the
world was to know as Marie Curie,
was thinking of the past, and of this
journey which she had waited for so
long.
She tried to imagine the future.
She thought, quite sincerely, that one
day she would be. making her way
back to her native Warsaw, in two
years, three years time at the most,
when she would find herself a snug
little job as a teacher.
It was the winter of 1891. She was
twenty-four. And she was on herway
to Paris, to the Sorbonne. It had been
a hard struggle. To leave the country
she loved. To save enough for the
fare.
What she wanted above all was to
continue her studies, to work. But
this was impossible in a Poland,
groaning under the heel of Czarist
oppression. The University of Warsaw
was not open to women. She dreamed
of studying in Paris. And* eventually,
by skimping and saving, she managed
to collect enough for her fare.
The moment came when she was
stepping from the train on to the
platform of the Gare du Nord. For
the first time in her life she was
breathing the air of a free country.
With that ardency which was part
of her nature, Marie flung herself into
her new life.
"She worked...," her daughter,
Eve Curie later wrote in the biography
of her mother, "as if in a fever. She
attended courses in mathematics,
physics and chemistry. Manual
technique, the minute precision
needed for scientific experiment
became familiar to her. Soon she was
to have the joy of being responsible
for researches, which, though of no
great importance, nevertheless allowed
her to demonstrate her skill and origi¬
nality of mind.
"She had a passionate love for the
atmosphere of the laboratory, its
"climate" of dedication and silence,
which she was to prefer to her dying
day. She decided that one master's
degree was not enough. She would
obtain two. One in physics and one
in mathematics."
She had built herself a secret uni¬
verse, dominated by her passion for
science. Her love for her family
and her country had their place in
this universe, but something which
had no place, which she had ruled
out completely from her life, was that
other kind of love, which previously
had brought her only humiliation and
disappointment. Marriage simply did
not come into her scheme of things.
"Perhaps," Eve Curie wrote in her
book, "it is not surprising that a young
Polish girl of genius, living on the
edge of poverty miles away from her
native land, should have kept herself
to herself for her work. But it is
surprising that a Frenchman, a
scientist of genius, should have kept
himself for that Polish girl."
w,'hile Marie, still almost a
child, was living in Warsaw and dream¬
ing one day of coming to the Sorbonne
to study, Pierre Curie, returning home
one day from that same Sorbonne
where he was already making impor¬
tant discoveries in Physics confided
these thoughts to his diary: "Woman
loves life for the living of it far more
than we do: women of genius are rare.
We have to struggle against women
when, driven on by some 'mystic' love,

Maria Sklodowska in
1892. She was 24. And
she had only been in Paris
for a few months. At last
her dream of studying
science at the Sorbonne
had come true. Ten years
later she discovered
radium and received world
acclaim as one of the
greatest scientists of
modern times.
we wish to pursue some path which
is against nature, some work which
alienates us from the human beings
nearest and dearest to us."
The second son of a physician,
Dr. Eugène Curie, Pierre had received
no "formal" education. He never went
to school. Instead he was taught first
by his father then by a private tutor.
It was a scheme of education that paid
dividends. At the age of sixteen
Pierre Curie was a Bachelor of
Science. At the age of eighteen he
had a master's degree. At nineteen
he was appointed laboratory assistant
to Professor Desains in the Faculty of
Science a post he held for five years.
He was engaged on research with his
brother Jacques. The two young
physicists soon announced the disco¬
very of the important phenomenon of
"piezo-electricity."
In 1883, Jacques was appointed pro¬
fessor at Montpellier, while Pierre
became head of the laboratory at the
School of Physics and Chemistry of
the City of Paris. Even though he
devoted much of his time to his pupils,
he continued his theoretical work on
crystalline physics. This work led to
the formulation of the principle of
symmetry which has become one of
the bases of modern science. He
invented and built an ultra-sensitive
scientific scale: the Curie Scale. He
took up research on magnetism and
achieved a result of major importance,
the discovery of a fundamental law:
Curie's Law.
This was the man whom Marie Sklo¬
dowska was to meet for the first time
in the beginning of 1894.
"He seemed very young to me," she
noted, "although he was then thirty-
five. His rather slow, reflective
words, his air of simplicity and his
smile, at once serious and young, all
inspired confidence. A conversation
began between us and we became
friendly; its object was some questions
of science upon which I was only too
happy to ask his opinion."
Pierre Curie later recalled their
meeting in these words: "I described
the phenomenon of crystallography
upon which I was doing research. It
was strange to talk to a woman of the
work one loved, using technical terms,
complicated formulae, and to see that
woman, so young and so charming,
become animated, understand, even
discuss certain details with an
astonishing clarity.
"I gazed at her hair, at her high
curved forehead and her hands, which
were already stained from the acids
of the laboratory and roughened by
housework. I dug into my memory
for all that had been told me about this
girl. She was Polish. She had worked
for years in Warsaw before being
able to take the train to Paris; she had
no money; she lived alone in a
garret..."
In the July of 1895 Pierre and Marie
Curie were married.
"During these happy days was
formed one of the finest bonds that
ever united man and woman", Eve
Curie wrote. "Two hearts beat toge¬
ther, two bodies were united and two
minds of genius learned to think toge¬
ther. Marie could have married no

other than this great physicist, this
wise and noble man. Pierre could
have married no woman other than the
fair, tender Polish girl, who could be
childish then sublime within the same
few moments : for she was a friend
and a wife; a lover and a scientist.
In July 1897 their first child was
born. Irène Curie was to follow in
her mother's steps. She took up a
scientific career, married a fellow
scientist, the physicist Frederic Joliot
and in 1932, succeeding her mother
she became director of the Radium
Institute in Paris. In 1935 Frederic
and Irène Joliot-Curie shared the Nobel
Peace Prize in Chemistry.
At the end of 1897 the balance
sheet of Marie's achievements could
show two university degrees, a fellow¬
ship and a monograph on the magne¬
tization of tempered steel. The next
logical step in her career was a
doctor's degree. Reading through
reports of the latest experiments Marie
was attracted by a paper published by
the French scientist, Henri Becquerel.
Becquerel had examined the salts
of a rare metal, uranium. After Roent¬
gen's discovery of X-rays, the French
scientist, Henri Poincaré, conceived
the idea of discovering whether rays
like the X-ray were emitted by fluo¬
rescent bodies under the action of
light.
Attracted by the same problem Bec¬
querel examined the salts of uranium.
He observed, instead of .the pheno¬
menon he had expected, another alto¬
gether different and incomprehensible.
Without exposure to light, uranium
salts emitted, spontaneously, some
rays of an unknown nature. A com¬
pound of uranium, placed on a photo¬
graphic plate surrounded by black
paper, made an impression on the
plate through the paper.
Becquerel's discovery fascinated the
Curies. They asked themselves where
the energy came from, the energy
which uranium compounds constantly
gave off in the form of radiation. And
what the nature of this radiation was.
Here, indeed, was a subject worthy of
research, of a doctor's thesis.
A II that remained was the
question of where Marie was to do
her experiments. After certain dif¬
ficulties, Marie was given the use of a
little glassed-in studio on the ground
floor of the School of Physics. It was
a kind of store-room, sweating with
damp, where discarded machinery and
lumber were locked away. Its technic¬
al equipment was rudimentary, its
comfort non-existent. Deprived of an
adequate supply of electricity and of
everything that normally forms material
for the beginning of scientific
research, Marie, however, kept her
patience. She sought and found a
means of making her apparatus work
in this hole.
And it was under these primitive
conditions, on the ground floor of the
School of Physics in the Rue Lhomond
in Paris that two new elements were
discovered : polonium and radium.
But nobody had seen radium, nobody
knew its atomic weight. The chemists
were sceptical. "Show us radium,"
they said, "and we will believe you."
To show polonium and radium to the
sceptics, to prove to the world the
existence of their two new elements,
and to confirm their own convictions,
Pierre and Marie Curie were to labour
for four more years... in a wooden
shack, an abandoned shed, which
stood across a courtyard from Marie's
original work-room. This shed had
once been used by the Faculty of
Medicine as a dissecting room, but for
a long time it had not even been con¬
sidered fit for a mortuary.
"We had no money, no laboratory,
and no help in carrying out this impor¬
tant and difficult task," Marie later
recalled. "It was like creating some¬
thing out of nothing. I may say, without
exaggeration, that for my husband and
myself this period was the "heroic"
period of our lives. And yet it was in
that miserable shed that the best and
happiest years of our lives were spent
devoted entirely to work. I some-

The rarest, most precious vital force
by Marie Curie
On May 15, 1922 the Council of the
League of Nations in Geneva unani¬
mously named Marie Curie a member of
the League's Committee on Intellectual
Co-operation, of which she later became
vice-president. On June 16, 1926 Marie
Curie presented to the Committee a
memorandum on international scholar¬
ships for the advancement of science. In
it she discussed the problems of working
conditions in laboratories and the encou¬
ragement of scientific vocations, and
outlined a plan for the promotion of
international scholarships in science.
The following is the preamble of the
memorandum.
I shall devote but few words to an affirmation of
faith in the importance of science for mankind. If at times
this importance has been questioned and if the words
"the failure of science" have been pronounced in moments
of bitter discouragement, it is because man's endeavours
to achieve his highest aspirations are never perfect, like
all that is human, and because these endeavours have too
often been diverted from their path by forces of egocentric
nationalism and social regression.
Yet it is through the constant effort to expand science
that man has risen to his present pre-eminent place on our
planet and that he is also winning increasing power over
nature and a larger measure of well-being. We should
join with those who, like Rodin, pay homage to the devoted
efforts of scholars and thinkers and with those who, like
Pasteur, "believe indomitably that science and peace will
triumph over ignorance and war".
If, to judge from the experience of the recent world
conflict, the aspirations of the elites in different lands often
appear less exalted than those of the great mass of less
well educated persons, it is because of the perils inherent
in all forms of intellectual and political power when these
are not controlled and channeled toward, the high ideals
which alone justify their use. No enterprise can therefore

In 1903, Marie Curie and her husband Pierre (above)
received, with the French scientist Henri Becquerel, the
Nobel Prize for Physics. Marie Curie was the first woman
to receive a Nobel Prize. In 1911 she was also the second
woman so honoured for scientific achievements, being
awarded the N°bel Prize for Chemistry. And when a
Nobel Prize was given to a woman scientist for the third
time, it went to Marie Curie's daughter, Irene who, with
her husband Frederic Joliot (photo right) was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1935. Since then three
women scientists have been named Nobel Prize winners:
U.S. scientists Gerty T. Cori (Medicine, 1947) and Maria
Goeppert Mayer (Physics, 1963) and U.K. scientist Dorothy
Crowfoot-Hodgkin (Chemistry, 1964).

PRIZE WINNERS

have greater importance than those which seek to promote
international ties between the dynamic thinkers in all
countries and especially between the young in whose hands
lies the future of mankind.
I am sure that no one will deny that even in the most
democratic of countries existing social systems offer a
considerable advantage to the wealthy and that the roads
to higher education, open so freely to children of families
with ample means, are still difficult of access to children
of families with limited resources.
As a result every nation each year loses a large part of
the rarest, most precious vital force. While waiting for
reforms in education to resolve this problem once and for
all, the democratic response in various countries has
hitherto consisted of a partial remedy, the creation of
national educational scholarships, thus enabling higher
education to retrieve some of the young people of whom
it would otherwise be deprived.
These national efforts, highly commendable though still
far from adequate, are not our concern here, but I would
like to point out that the same problem exists with regard
to post university studies for the young people who have
managed to surmount all the obstacles encountered up to
that point.
At this post-university stage of their lives, young students
who contemplate careers in science are brought face to
face with pressing demands. In most cases the family
has done its utmost to help the young man or woman to
come this far and, unable to make further sacrifices, it
now asks them to become self supporting. And even in
well-to-do families the wish to take up very advanced
studies may encounter a lack of understanding, such studies
being considered as an extravagance or a mere whim.
Yet what in fact are the best interests of society in this
matter? Should it not give every encouragement to those
called to a scientific vocation? Is it really so well-endow¬
ed that it can afford to reject the vocations it is offered?
I believe, on the basis of personal experience, that the
sum total of the aptitudes called for by a true scientific
vocation is an infinitely frail and precious thing, a rare
treasure that it is both absurd and criminal to throw away,
a gift to which great care must be devoted so that it may
grow and fructify.
What, in reality, are some Of the qualities required of
the person who aspires to success in the field of indepen¬
dent scientific research? The intellectual qualities are an
intelligence capable of learning and understanding; a sure
judgment capable of appraising the significance of theo¬
retical and experimental demonstrations, an imagination
capable of creative effort. Equally important are the moral
faculties: perseverance, zeal and above all the unselfish
dedication that guides the novice, along a path which, in
most cases, will never lead him to material rewards com¬
parable to those offered by careers in industry or business.
Thus to foster and safeguard the scientific vocation is a
sacred duty for each society which has the interests of its
future at heart. It is gratifying to see that public opinion
is becoming increasingly conscious of this duty.

times passed a whole day stirring a
boiling mass of pitchblende, with an
iron rod almost as big as myself. In
the evening I would be broken with
fatigue."
It was in 1902, forty-five months
after the day on which the Curies had
announced the probable existence of
radium, that Marie finally succeeded
in preparing a decigramme of pure
radium. She made a first calculation
as to its atomic weight 225.
Now the sceptics of which there
were still a few could only bow
before the facts, before the super¬
human obstinacy of a woman who had
performed one of the great scientific
feats of the century. Now radium
officially existed.
Marie and Pierre were to have four
more years together, four years during
which radium became an industry, was
used in the field of medicine to cure
growths, tumours and most impor¬
tant certain forms of cancers: another
daughter, Eve, was born; in 1903 the
Curies received, with Henri Becquerel,
the Nobel Prize for Physics; the name
Curie became world-famous.
Then one rainy morning in the April
of 1906 Pierre was making his way
home up the Rue Dauphme. Crossing
the street, he was killed when the back
wheel of a horsedrawn wagon passed
over his skull.
On that day in April, Madame Curie
became, not only a widow, but a pitiful
and incurably lonely woman.

hat was to become of her
now? What was to become of the
research Pierre had left in suspense,
and of his teaching at the Sorbonne?
On May 13, 1906, the council of the
Faculty of Science decided, unanim¬
ously, to maintain the chair created for
Pierre Curie and offer it to his wife.
In 1911, Mane Curie was awarded
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. In 1912,
she was created Member of the Scien¬
tific Society of Warsaw. In 1913 she
became Member Extraordinary of the
Royal Academy of Sciences (Mathe¬
matics and Physics section) Amster¬
dam; Doctor of the University of Birm¬
ingham and Honorary Member of the
Association of Arts and Sciences of
Edinburgh. In the same "year she
attended in Warsaw the opening of the
radioactivity laboratory, dedicated to
her.
In the following year, a small white
building was completed in the Rue
Pierre Curie in Pans. Cut into the
stone, above its entrance, were the
words : Institut du Radium, Pavillon
Curie. This "temple of the future" was
now ready to receive its radium, its
workers and its director.
With the outbreak of the First World
War, Mane Curie foresaw the urgent
need to organize the manufacture of

they pursued, with the same intense passion, what
Pierre once called "our scientific dream". Their eleven
years together, working with only bare necessities, produced
a phenomenal result: the discovery of polonium and
radium. Above, the makeshift laboratory in which Marie
Curie succeeded in producing the first decigrammes

YEARS OF HAPPINESS, WORK AND TRIUMPH
In 1921, seated in a chair and
encircled by reporters and
cameramen, Marie Curie
arrives in New York. A
retiring woman, she now
underwent the ordeal of being
famous. To thank the United
States for the gift of a
gramme of radium, she had
conquered her fears and
for the first time in her life she
accepted the obligations of
a great official journey. She
was the discoverer of
radium, but lacked the means
to produce it in the quantity
needed for her research.
At the University of Columbia,
in the United States, Marie
Curie advances to receive
the honorary degree of
Doctor of Science. She was
then aged 54. During her
lifetime she was so honoured
twenty times by universities
in the U.S.A., Britain,
Poland and Switzerland.

Röntgen apparatus as well as the need
for radiological cars. She equipped and
put into service 20 of these cars, retain¬
ing one for her personal use. She
asked no special favour. She who had
once nearly starved in a garret did
not find it difficult to transform herself
into a frontline soldier.
I n 1922, 35 members of the
Academy of Médecine of Paris sub¬
mitted the following petition to their
colleagues: "The undersigned members
think that the Academy would do itself
honour by electing Madame Curie as
a free associate member, in recognition
of the part she took in the discovery
of radium and of a new treatment in
medicine, Curiotherapy."
This was a revolutionary document.
Not only was it proposed to elect a
woman for the first time to a scientific
academy in France, but, breaking with
custom altogether, it was proposed to
elect her spontaneously, without her
formally submitting herself as a candi¬
date. Sixty-four members of the Aca¬
demy of Médecine signed this mani¬
festo thus giving a lesson to their
brethren in the Academy of Sciences.
All candidates to the vacant chair
retired In favour of Madame Curie.
In the September of 1927 in her
sixtieth year and not long after an
operation to stem the onset of blind¬
ness, she wrote to her sister, Bronya :
"Sometimes my courage fails me and
I think I ought to stop working and
devote myself to gardening. But I am
held by a thousand bonds, and I don't
know when I shall be able to arrange
. things differently. Nor do I know
whether, even by writing scientific
books, I could live without the lab¬
oratory."
Madame Pierre Curie died on July 4,
1934. She was 67. The cause of her
death was an aplastic pernicious
anaemia. The bone marrow did not
react, probably injured by a long expo¬
sure to radiation. At the end she did
not call on her daughters, Irène or
Eve, or on any of her relations. At
the end she was alone with the scien¬
tific work to which she had devoted
her life.
A year later, the book Marie had
completed just before ber death, was
added to the library of the Radium
Institute in the Rue Pierre Curie. It
was a heavy volume. On its grey cover
was the name of the author: Madame
Pierre Curie, Professor at the Sor¬
bonne. Nobel Prize in Physics. Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. The title was one
word : "Radioactivity".
As her daughter Eve said of her :
"She was an eternal student; she
passed like a stranger across her own
life. She remained whole, natural and
almost unaware of her astonishing
destiny. She did not know how to be
famous."

MARIA SKLODOWSKA
The Dreamer in Warsaw
by Leopold Infeld
B EFORE the last war, in
Warsaw, near the Vistula River stood
the castle of the Polish kings which
served as the residence of Poland's
presidents between the two world wars.
Nearby lay the Old Town with its
medieval buildings, known from the
pictures by Canaletto (See the "Unesco
Courier", March 1961). Near the Old
Town was the "New Town", built a
little later.
The last war destroyed the castle,
the Old Town and the New Town

LEOPOLD INFELD, a leading Polish physi¬
cist and a member of his country's Academy
of Sciences, is head of the department of
theoretical physics at the University of
Warsaw and director of the Institute of
Theoretical Physics. From 1933 to 1935
fie was at Cambridge University where he
collaborated with the famous physicist Max
Born. From 1936 to 1938 he was at Prin¬
ceton University where he worked with
Professor Albert Einstein and from 1938 to
Î950 fie was lecturer and then professor at
Toronto University. He is the author of
numerous scientific books, among them:
"The Evolution of Physics" , which he wrote
with Albert Einstein.
Warsaw which was almost completely
obliterated by the Nazis.
The present government decided to
rebuild the Old and the New Town
exactly (at least externally) as they
were in the times of the last Polish
king and are known from old pictures
and plans. Thus for a man born a
hundred years ago, the rebuilt Old
and New Town would seem stranger
than to someone born 200 years ago.
!n the New Town there is a small
thoroughfare called Fréta Street, and
at number 16 a plaque records that
in 1867 Maria Sklodowska was born
there. One hundred years ago that
is, four years after the last Polish
Uprising was crushed. Afterwards
Czarist repression became even stron¬
ger than before, as did the patriotic
feelings of the Poles.
The mother of Maria ran a small
private school at 16 Fréta Street and
her husband, Wladyslaw Sklodowski,
was a secondary school teacher of
mathematics and physics. Maria's
parents were members of the small
Polish gentry. They formed a closely

In this section of
Warsaw's "New Town"
(destroyed during the
last war and completely
rebuilt since 1945),
Maria Sklodowska was
born and spent her
youth. Later, when she
became Marie Curie,
she wrote in her
autobiography of those
early days» "I devoted
most evenings to my
own education. I had
heard that a certain
number of women
had managed to enter
schools of higher
education in
St. Petersburg or abroad
and I determined to
prepare myself to
follow them one day."
knit family in which there were five
children, four of them girls Zosia,
Maria, Bronia, Helena and one son,
Joseph. All, with the exception of
Helena Sklodowska Szalay, died
before the last world war.
There must have been a really cul¬
tured atmosphere in the Sklodowski
home. Let me quote a passage from
the biography of Maria Sklodowska
Curie by her daughter, Eve Curie,
who writes :
"It was true that Mr Sklodowski
knew everything, or nearly everything.
The poor man, father of a family,
balancing his budget with the greatest
difficulty, had found leisure to develop
his scientific knowledge by going
through publications which he procur¬
ed by considerable effort. It seemed
to him quite natural to keep up with
the progress of chemistry and physics,
just as it was natural to know Greek
and Latin and to speak English, French
and German (as well as, of course,
Polish and Russian); to translate the
finest works of foreign authors into his
native language in prose or verse..."
The family often moved house,
depending on the state of their finan¬
ces. Nowollpki, Karmelicka and Leszno
Streets appear in the early biography
of Maria. Before the last war I knew
these streets well. They we're in the
heart of the Jewish district. They
were ugly, narrow cobble-stoned
streets, often jammed with horse-drawn
droskies filled with merchandise.
In the Russian gymnasia (high
schools) which prepared students for
the University, pupils were not allowed
to talk to each other in their mother
tongue. They were not allowed to do
so even in the street. Polish was
treated and taught as a foreign lan¬
guage. If someone was found guilty
of the "crime" of speaking Polish he
was denounced and punished by soli¬
tary confinement. A second offence
led to a beating and if it happened for
the third time the culprit was expelled
from the school and no other school
could accept him. But the attempts of
the Czarist authorities to Russify
Poland by such draconic laws proved
a completa fiasco.
Some Polish students attended pri¬
vate schools, at least for the beginning
of their education. The young Maria
went to Jadwiga Sikorska's school for
girls at the corner of Marszalkowska
and Królewska Street. Schools like
this which did not give the right to
enter university, were centres of Polish
patriotism and organized resistance.
At a moment's notice, when a certain
bell rang in the class a warning that
the Czarist inspector had come to
visit the school everything changed
in a few .seconds as if by magic. A
patriotic lesson in Polish history would
suddenly become a lesson on mathe¬
matics conducted in Russian. Such
changes were made easier by the
rottenness and corruption of the
Czarist Regime. Almost all the inspec¬
tors were ready to take bribes, usually
handed to them between the covers
of a book.
ARIA was the best student
in her class. In order to enter any
university anywhere she also had to
finish the hateful gymnasium which
she did, winning a gold medal when
she was barely 17 years old. The
Czarist university at that time did not
accept girls. In any case, few Poles
attended it and from 1905 there was
an organized boycott of all govern¬
ment schools, including the university.
Yet it was impossible to curb the
Polish spirit of learning. As they did
60 years later under the Nazi occu¬
pation, the Poles organized a "univer¬
sity on the run" : classes were held
secretly, each time in a different home.
The students also brought education
to the workers. The young people
around Maria felt that what the people
of Poland needed most was educa¬
tion.
It was the era of Positivism in lit¬
erature and the time when Polish youth
rebelled against Romanticism. They
were influenced by philosophers like
Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer;
they recognized the importance of the
work of great scientists such as Pas¬
teur and Darwin. Maria was also
influenced by this trend. Indeed, we
know from a letter to her father that
she read Spencer's books on sociology
in French and "a wonderful book on
anatomy and physiology by Paul Bert
in Russian."
Maria Sklodowska was 18 when her
older sister Bronia went to Paris to
study medicine.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that
while in Paris Bronia met and married
Doctor Dluski, and that after they
returned to Poland the young couple
established a sanatorium in Zakopane.
This health resort, lying in the beautiful
Tatra Mountains later became a vaca¬
tion resort for Pierre and Maria
Slodowska Curie, who were among the
first to discover Zakopane, now known
as "the pearl of Poland".
While Bronia was in Paris, her father,
on his salary as a school teacher,
was unable to go on supporting the
burden of paying for his daughter's
studies. Maria agreed to help, and a
position of governess was offered to
her by the Zurawski family.
During the holidays the Zurawski's
eldest son Karol came home from the
University where he was studying
mathematics. A love-affair began
between Maria and Karol. Maria had
beautiful platinum blond hair, gray,
sparkling eyes, and a determined
mouth. Karol was the first young, well
educated man in whom she had
become interested.
But a marriage between the daughter
of a gymnasium teacher and the son
of a landowner was regarded in 19th
century Poland, as in most of Europe,
as a "mesalliance". The parents of
the boy did not give their consent.
I met Karol Zurawski when he was
about 50; I was around 20 and a
student at the Jagellonian University,
Cracow, where he was then a profes¬
sor of mathematics.
He was a good mathematician and
there is still a theorem in hydro¬
mechanics known by his name. I saw
him even after the Second World War
in Warsaw, where he had moved from
Cracow, and where he died, twenty
years after Maria's death.

THE DREAMER IN WARSAW (Continued)
11
Maria's interest in mathematics
started just at the time when she met
him. She was always very capable
and had a good memory. But I believe
her friendship with Karol showed her
the first vista of the beauty of mathe¬
matics.
If one once understands Mathematics
and Physics, one becomes their slave
and lover for the rest of one's life
as did Maria Sklodowska.
When she returned to Warsaw she
worked for some time in the Museum
of Industry and Agriculture. There,
under the guidance of her relative
Joseph Boguski, who later became a
professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic,
the young girl enjoyed her first ex¬
periments in physics and chemistry.
Because of the disappointment of
her first love, because of her awakened
interest in Science and because Rus¬
sian universities were closed to women,
Maria decided to go to Paris in 1891
and to study there. She intended to
return to Poland as a qualified teacher
in mathematics and physics. Although
fate interfered with her plans, she
was always in close touch with her
family and with her country, which
she visited many times.
IN May 1912, after the
death of her husband, and after the
Curies had received the Nobel Prize,
à Polish delegation was sent to Paris.
Among its members was the famous
writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, author of
"Ouo Vadis", who urged Maria to re¬
turn to Warsaw to continue her scien-
tifio work there.
Maria's daughter writes that it was
a difficult decision for her to take.
But I find this hard to believe.
Warsaw was then a desert as far as
experimental physics was concerned,
and no experimental scientist can work
in a desert. She promised, however, to
direct from afar the new laboratory
that was planned and she recommen¬
ded for posts on its staff her two most
talented Polish students, Jan Danysz
and Ludwik Wertenstein.
The laboratory was opened in August
1913. Money had been provided by
an industrialist who wished the labora¬
tory to be named after his son, a pupil
of Maria's in Paris, who had died as
a young man. So the laboratory,
named for Dr. Kernbaum, was created,
and for its inauguration Maria visited
Poland and gave a lecture in Polish.
The history of this laboratory,
belonging to the " Learned Society of
Warsaw", and the role it played in the
scientific development of Poland
deserve a few words.
Jan Danysz, one of the Polish stu¬
dents recommended by Maria, was
killed a few years later in the Battle
of Verdun. His son is now a distin¬
guished physicist in Warsaw, and is
the co-discoverer, with Jerzy Pniewski,
oí the fundamental particles known as
hyperons.
The laboratory was directed by Pro¬
fessor Wertenstein, undoubtedly the
most distinguished but officially the
least recognized experimental physicist
in Poland of the generation between
the world wars. It had little or no
State support, though in 1921 it rec¬
eived an important grant from Maria.
Yet, because of its scientific work and
because of the schooling it gave to a
few young scientists, it became known
throughout the world as the only
laboratory in which studies on nuclear
physics were kept alive in Poland.
When, after the First World War, a
free Poland was created, Maria dream¬
ed of building a big institute in
Warsaw devoted to research on radium
and its power for healing. But the
new-born country spent vast sums on
its military preparations and it was
left to a specially organized society to
collect money and to present the
Institute as "a national gift" to Maria
Sklodowska Curie.
In 1925 Maria came to Warsaw to
lay the corner-stone for the laboratory
building, and in 1932, when the hospital
at the Institute was finished, Maria
again came to Warsaw to present the
Institute with a gramme or radium
which she had received in the U.S.A
Two years later Maria died, and
seven years later night fell on Europe.
Science is an international venture.
There is no English, French or Polish
Science. But there are contributions
of each country to the development of
science, usually commemorated by
the names of the men responsible for
each gigantic step forward.
On its way science smashes old
dogmas, looking for new truths. The
dogma of the Moving Sun was demo¬
lished by the work of Copernicus,
Gallileo, Kepler, Newton, Laplace,
Einstein. It would be idle to ask who
was the greatest. But the first of them
was Copernicus.
The dogma that the atom is the
indivisable, smallest part of matter was
smashed by Pierre and Marie Curie,
by Irène and Frederic Jolliot-Curie, by
Sir Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, and
a hundred others who came after
them. But the first were Pierre and
Marie Curie.
Poland can be justly proud to have
given to the world Copernicus and
Maria Sklodowska Curie.

This photo, taken near
Geneva on a misty day in
1925, records a meeting
between two great scientists
Marie Curie and Albert
Einste'n during a break
between meetings at the
League of Nations. In 1922
the Council of the League
of Nations unanimously
named Marie Curie as a
member of the Committee on
Intellectual Co-operation.
In this committee she worked
ardently to promote the
development of science
devoted to the service of
man (see text page 16).
THE WOM
by Marguerite Perey
Marguerite Perey, the distinguished
French woman scientist, was a re¬
search student of Marie Curie's and
later collaborated with her for some
years. Here she recalls the feelings
which Marie Curie inspired in all who
worked closely with her, and acknow¬
ledges the debt which her own career
in science owes to her illustrious
teacher. Five years after the death
of her "patronne", Marguerite Perey
herself discovered a new radioactive
substance, francium. Today she is
professor in the Faculty of Science at
the University of Strasbourg, where
she directs the nuclear research
centre (nuclear chemistry).
I N June 1929, as a shy
young student not yet
twenty, I had to face an interview
with Madame Curie, who had asked
the Chemistry School to choose a
new graduate to work with her.
I was shown into a cheerless little
waiting-room, where I was quietly
joined by a lady in black, very pale
and frail-looking, with a chignon of
curly grey hair and thick spectacles.
I at first took her for a secretary, but

AN WE CALLED LA PATRONNE
to my great confusion, I soon realiz¬
ed that I was face to face with
"Madame Curie". We talked for a time,
and I felt I was showing up very badly;
then she said, "I will let you know in
the course of the summer whether the
research fellowship has been granted
or not."
I considered this a most polite way
of dismissing me, and gave an
immense sigh of relief when I crossed
the threshold of the august institution,
for what was, I was convinced, the
first and last time: I had been struck
by the general dreariness and gloom,
and was delighted to think that I had
certainly forfeited any possibility of a
second visit. I went on holiday with
a light heart, until I received a letter
from the Institut du Radium informing
me, to my stupefaction, that the
fellowship had been granted, and I
was to join the Laboratory on
October 1, 1929. Such was the start
of my career in the Curie Laboratory.
Madame Curie herself, the friendly
atmosphere and the fascinating work
so completely won me over that the
few months' research work I expected
to put in stretched to twenty years.
In Paris, I first had to be initiated
into methods of work and scientific
problems of which I was totally
ignorant. The big chemistry room,
facing the redoutable waiting-room of
my first visit, looked full South
towards the garden on the other side.
It became a sort of wonderland for
me, thanks to the help and encou¬
ragement 1 received from all who
guided my first steps in "Radioactivity"
a field which embraced both
chemistry and physics.
Madame Curie loved to have a
happy, young and eager team around
her, although our eagerness might
sometimes break out in slightly noisy,
emphatic or surprising forms.
She loved to mix with us and share
our life. Our favourite meeting-place
was in the passage, facing her office
door, at the foot of the stairs. We
talked about everything under the sun,
whether or not it had any connexion
with our work; but I think the talk
opened up vast horizons for us. We
usually ended by discussing some
scientific article which had just
appeared.
The garden was another spot
beloved of Madame Curie, where
she liked to work with one of us or
bring us all together. "Her garden"
was a very modest affair, between
the "Curie Building" and the "Pasteur
Building", where she had planted
limes and rambler roses when the
Radium Institute was established. It
was furnished with spartan chairs,
benches and tables, and Madame
Curie planned any number of experi¬
ments with us in the garden, which
she preferred to her office.
Receptions for guests of honour or
new Doctors of Science were held
there when weather permitted. We
prepared everything ourselves, and
tea and ices were served in beakers
with glass rods.
Once I was acclimatized, I was
appointed as assistant to one of the
research scientists. We worked in the
"Little Building", and I spent years
behind its thickly-barred windows,
for this isolated building held the
precious, dangerous stocks of radium
and other concentrated radioactive
products.
Madame Curie would often tell me
what results she expected, but I had
to give her the exact results I had
obtained, after repeating each experi¬
ment several times. She prized inte¬
grity and enthusiasm above all else,
and as she trusted me, I very soon
had the immense privilege of work¬
ing with her.
Everything needed for a delicate
experiment had to be prepared under
her watchful eye, and nothing over¬
looked. It was marvellous training to
Work under her supervision and benefit
from her advice and commentary. It
was an ample reward for quickness
and skill when a substance of a high
degree of purity could be prepared
and used.
Marie Curie was the first woman
to be admitted as Professor at the
University. It was in 1906, after the
death of Pierre Curie, that she found
the courage to carry on her husband's
teaching at the Sorbonne, and pursue
their researches.
I only knew Marie Curie in her last ..
years, when radiation had already y X
taken its toll, and she was worn out.
Her classes made great demands on
her. If there was some special point
CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE

24
'LA PATRONNE' (Continued)
she wished us to understand, her
even tone would become resonant,
her deathly pallor would light up.
She was obviously most interested
in the experimental periods which
followed her classes; but it was with
her research team that she showed
herself a surpassing teacher. She
exacted fervent enthusiasm and
dogged persistence. Those who were
not imbued with the spirit of her
laboratory did not stay long.
I owe an immense debt of gratitude
to Marie Curie. If she realized, when
we were working together, that I had
lost the thread of her explanations,
she would go over the ground again,
and would tactfully "forget" to check
the relevant pages in my notebook.
But she made sure, during the next
few days, that I had worked at and
fully understood them, before going
on to the next step.
Marie Curie often brought us
together in the lecture-room, where
one of the team would explain his
work. In the early days, I found this
a most unusual and arduous exercise,
but Marie Curie could always breathe
life into it. She was close enough
to us to understand and feel our joy
at success, and our. disappointment
at failure.
To the very end, in spite of all
difficulties, she had the gift of wonder.
As she put it, "I am one of those who
see great beauty in science. A
scientist in his laboratory is not a mere
technician; he is also a child watching
a spectacle of natural phenomena
which move him as deeply as a fairy
tale. Nor do I believe there is any
danger of the spirit of adventure
dying out: the most vital force I see
when I look around me is that very
spirit of adventure, that indestructible
urge akin to curiosity."
In spite of every care, protective
measures were very inadequate at
that time, and the danger of certain
substances which we often manipu¬
lated was still not fully understood.
In June 1934, Madame Curie, already
very ill, was taken to Sancellemoz,
where she died on July 4. Her death,
which robbed us of "La Patronne,"
as we lovingly and deferentially called
her, was a cruel blow.
I have tried to keep faith with
Marie Curie, and continue research
in the field she opened up, as I pro¬
mised her. Before leaving for San¬
cellemoz, she told me to make all
preparations to obtain the emission
spectrum of actinium in Professor
Zeemars' Laboratory at Amsterdam,
which had all the necessary apparatus.
I had to get all the products and
equipment ready at Amsterdam, and
she was to be there for the experiment
when the day came . . . The following
autumn, with the help of the lab¬
oratory staff, we were able to carry
out this experiment by which
Madame Curie set such store, and
which was, I believe, the culmination
of her last experimental work.


RUBEN DARIO
and the resurrection of
Hispano-American poetry
Portrait of the great Spanish American poet by José Lamuño.
Collection Luis Felipe Ibarra, Paris

by
Emir Rodriguez Monegal
A
century has passed since
Rubén Darío was born In a little town
in Central America and during those
hundred years, the child born in
Metapa, Nicaragua, has become the
most celebrated poet of the Spanish-
speaking world, triumphing on both
sides of the Atlantic, and dying at the
height of his fame to become immortal
in his verse, with the other great
Spanish poets. During those hundred
years, the antiquated, provincial poetry
of a whole continent was changed by
the force of his genius into the new,
vigorous poetry of a score of modern
peoples.
When Dario was born, Nicaraguan
poetry was practically non-existent,
Spanish American poetry was known
in Spain only to the erudite, the
poetry of Spain itself was dying under
the weight of tradition, lassitude and
repetition. Darío changed all that in
the space of a few years. Striding
from Nicaragua to Santiago de Chile,
from Chile to Buenos Aires, from the
shores of the Plata to Madrid,
Darío took the provincial, wandering,
sluggish stream of verse and trans¬
formed it to a pure current which sings
and dances, flaunts its native or bor¬
rowed brilliance, and delights in its
own distinctive music. That music is
still to be heard.
The success of Dario's first notable
works, from Azul ... to Los raros
and Prosas profanas, in the torpid
years of the late nineteenth century,
scored a victory for the refinements
of a literature that was deliberately
and unashamedly literary. Darío (the
Spanish American) sang to the mar¬
quises and princesses of Versailles,
delighted in the' play of words, was
shockingly frivolous.
It was a gentle air, of slow
[measures:
the Fairy Harmony timed its
[cadences,
and half-formed phrases and gentle
[sighs
mingled with the sobs of the
['cellos (1).
EMIR RODRIGUEZ MONEGAL, a Uruguyan
writer and journalist, is director of "Mundo
Nuevo" (New World) a Spanish language
literary review published in Paris. He was
formerly professor of literature at the Uni¬
versity of Montevideo.
It is a joy to follow the Intricacies
of the lines which echo with the
rippling laughter of the Marquesa
Eulalia. With these and other poems,
Darío came to symbolize the emulation
of all poets in the New World for the
elegance and refinement of the
modernists.
At that time, Paris was the capital
of their frivolous, luxurious world:
Dario's poetry mirrored as closely as
it could the lustre of Paris. Many
eminent critics reproached him for
his gallic mentality, and bade him
(with a certain solemn officiousness)
return to his own country to describe
"the girls of his village," and try to
forget Paris "where he had spent
perhaps two or three weeks in his
life."
Other critics maintained, on similar
grounds, that Dario was not the bard
of Spanish America, but merely an
uprooted foreigner. Many viewed his
poetry as a mere projection of Ver¬
laine and Leconte de Lisle, a strained
adaptation of the inventions of Poe
or Mallarmé, the frothy tribute of an
admirer of French exoticism. As a
great Spanish writer put it: "In Darío,
you can see the Indian feathers
showing under his hat," implying that
he, like the Indians, was dazzled by
the latest European notions.
But the unjust quip of the great
Don Miguel de Unamuno touches only
the superficial Darío. His visits to
Paris, his active Involvement with the
diplomatic world, his thirst for luxury
and worldly success, seemed to justify
such strictures. Darío gave the
impression of being the typical Latin
American poet, stifling in our rude
lands, who cannot abide the "crass
municipal" populace (as he once
called it), and has no aptitude for
paying tribute to a new-born demo¬
cracy or a President of a Republic.
This incomplete, synthetic, fanciful
image was thus imposed on many
critics and readers. Darío himself
gave it currency, with a mixture of
amusement and childish impudence.
He wished to outdo the subtle in
subtlely, explore the farthest bounds
(1) Era un aire suave, de pausados giros:
el Hada Armonía ritmaba sus vuelos,
e iban frases vagas y tenues suspiros
entre los sollozos de los violoncelos.
of the decadent civilization of his time,
and he loved to scandalize the worthy
bourgeoisie of Latin America. He
wrote defiantly in his introduction to
Prosas profanas:
"Is there a drop of African, Cho-
rotegan or Nagrandanian Indian
blood In my veins? There may be,
in spite of my aristocrat's hand;
but Io! my verses sing of princesses,
kings, empires, visions of far-off or
impossible countries. What would
you? . I detest the life and times
I chanced to be born to; and I can¬
not acclaim a President of the Repu¬
blic in the tongue in which I would
sing to thee, O Halagaball whose
court of gold, silk and marble I visit
in my dreams ..."
I
hose who regarded Darío
as a mere imitator of the French school
overlooked his other achievements,
which were perhaps more important
than the trivial aping of Verlaine or
Banville. Darío came to Latin Amer¬
ican literature at the critical moment
in the development of a new cultural
tradition. For nearly a century, that
literature had been struggling to attain
an identity to match the continent's
political independence. The romantics
(who flourished practically throughout
the nineteenth century) were suc¬
ceeded by the "fin-de-siècle" poets,
who struck the first blows, in their
separate countries, for more subtle
and flexible verse, freer utterance,
newer and bolder images.
They were Mexican, like Salvador
Díaz Mirón and Manuel Gutiérrez
Nájera, Cuban, like Julián del Casal
and José Martí, Colombian like José
Asunción Silva or Salvadorian like
Francisco Gavidia. Each played his
, part in renovating the Spanish lan¬
guage and Spanish verse; but the only
one who was acquainted with them
all, learnt from them all and surpassed
them all was Rubén Darío.
Genius that he was, he absorbed
the spirit of different generations of __
poets and fused their many tongues J*\
into the unique, matchless, highly ^
distinctive voice of one poet: Rubén
Darío. This was his first feat: to

RUBEN DARIO (Continued)
The birth of a new idiom :
the haunting music of the soul
convert the speech of a scattered tribe
into an individual poetic utterance.
His second feat was equal to the
first: he succeeded» in imbuing other,
younger poets with the new spirit;
his genius embodied it in a language
common to a whole rising generation.
It was shaped in Santiago de Chile,
spread to Buenos Aires, and triumphed
in Madrid. Darío returned to the
fountain-head (like a modern conquis¬
tador whose caravels were to reverse
the course of history); he came to
Spain to restore to its poetry and
language the life, force and grace
which they lacked.
The younger Spanish poets were
the first to acknowledge the master,
and joyfully harnessed themselves to
his triumphal chariot. Antonio Ma¬
chado, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Ramón
del Valle Inclán, adopted this Latin
American as their guide and paid
homage to him in their verses.
Before Darío came on the scene,
these young poets were gagged by
the prevailing mediocrity. Then Darío
sauntered in smiling, to open new
vistas, lighten the prose, electrify the
verse.
What Darío, the "Indian", brought to
Spain was not the gallic idiom, as the
older critics complained, but the
modern idiom: a new idiom of his own
invention, and yet as old as the lan¬
guage spoken in Spain at the conquest
of the New World; the speech he learnt
as a child in Nicaragua, sharing the
same roots with all its sister langua¬
ges; the Spanish American tongue.
D
26
ario came home like the
prodigal son, with no riches but his
words. He thus returned to the source,
and brought the mother country the
language preserved in America by the
sons of the conquistadors. The
treasures displayed by this "Indian"
were intangible, yet they were a
precious cargo: each word was new,
and yet immeasurably old.
Those who still accused him of
triviality did not look below the
iridescent surface of his verse. In
truth; Darío is much more earnest
than he seems, and the poet's
fundamental gravity underlies many of
his poems about flirtatious Marquises
and sorrowful princesses. He loved
to juggle with lines, rhythms and
rhymes, but behind the façade lay a
passionate, tragic soul.
His passionate side was obvious
and easy to copy. His gallant exploits
went the round of the literati; they
all knew of his escapades, his mar¬
riages, his many muses of flesh and
blood. And there was much talk of
his artificial paradises. The legends
were no doubt exaggerated, but the
poet's fame was not solely compound
ed of truth; falsehood also played
its part.
In reality, Dario was no Don Juan:
he was a headstrong, vulnerable man,
who could be possessed or even
swept away by love. Any number of
his poems, singing of the joy and
sorrow of love, are familiar to all
admirers of poetry. He once con¬
fessed:
Like an unbridled colt my instincts
[galloped;
My youth rode an unbridled colt;
Intoxicated, with a dagger at the
[waist;
If I did not come to grief, it was by
[God's good grace.
In my garden stood a beautiful
[statue;
It seemed of marble, but was of
[living flesh ;
A youthful soul within,
Sentimental, sensitive, sensuous (2).
For many years, readers and critics
closed their eyes to any image of
Darío but that of the victor, spending
his life in the pursuit of pleasure and
the capture of applause. But another,
very different image lay behind.
Masked by the harmony of this verses
is a poet who suffers and is dying
by inches. One of his most haunting
poems brings us face to face with
the reality: it shows him clinging to
life, passionately hugging it, while
Death inexorably draws near. The
poem is Lo fatal (The Inevitable).
Happy the tree almost bereft of
[feeling;
Happier still the rock, impenetrable,
[insensitive;
No greater pain than that of being
[alive;
No greater sorrow than to live and
[feel.
To exist and to know nothing, to
[have no set course;
To tremble at the thought of life's
[quick ebb,
And the terrifying certainty of death
[tomorrow;
To suffer for life and for the
[shadow.
For the unknown or the dimly
[conjectured;
To feel the temptations of the
[flesh, sweet and tendril-like,
And the cold tomb crowned with
[funeral wreaths,
And not to know where we are
[bound, nor whence we came . . . I (3)
His biographers explain that at
that time, Dario was disintegrating
physicaly, drinking himself to death,
dissolving into nothingness, a process
sublimated Into pure poetry. Darío
had discovered that the flesh is stub¬
born and does not want to die, and
that the infinite patience of Death is
a pure fiction. Death consumes us
implacably day by day; Death shapes
and overshadows our lives. And in
his verses even the best, the most
mournfully melodious he is tracing
the progress of Death's invasion and
victory.
Thus, Dario's third great feat was
to attain this profound insight for the
Spanish and American verse of his
time. Like every authentic creator,
Dario was constantly at odds with his
time. The conflict had its vicissitudes,
periods of peace and even sudden
gleams of cheerful harmony; but every
victory in the long struggle compro¬
mised his closest links with his envi¬
ronment.
A
t one time, the Spanish
language seemed threatened by his
gallicisms and thirst for modernity. At
other times, bourgeois conventions
were endangered by the white-hot
passion of his poetry. He sometimes
offended the most sensitive political
susceptibilities, which can influence
the destiny of a whole continent.
For that reason he lived much of his
life as a fugitive. Although firmly
rooted in the land and language of his
childhood, although he had covered
the whole of Latin America in his
triumphal progress, Darío lived a large
part of his life in exile in Paris, and
became a cosmopolitan. Only thus
could he become still more deeply,
more tragically Spanish American.
Up to the very end of his life he
took no respite, but went on seeking
and fighting. Death, which finally
vanquished him one day in 1916, did
not have an easy victory. The poet
refused to yield an inch without a
struggle, a cry, a lament. Long after
his death, his poetry (and the poet's
aspirations) live on.
(2) Potro sin freno se lanzó mi instinto,
mi juventud montó potro sin freno;
iba embriagada y con puñal al cinto,
si no cayó, fue porque Dios es bueno.
En mi jardín se vio una estatua bella;
se juzgó mármol y era carne viva;
una alma joven habitaba en ella,
sentimental, sensible y sensitiva.
(3) Dichoso el árbol que es apenas sensitivo,
y más la piedra dura, porque ésta ya no
[siente
pues no hay dolor más grande que el
[dolor de ser vivo,
ni mayor pesadumbre que la vida cons¬
ciente.
Ser, y no saber nada, y ser sin rumbo
[cierto,
y el temor de haber sido y un futuro
[terror...
y el espanto seguro de estar mañana
[muerto,
y sufrir por la vida, y por la sombra y
[por
lo que no conocemos y apenas sospe¬
chamos,
y la carne que tienta con sus frescos
[racimos
y la tumba que aguarda con sus fúnebres
[ramos,
y no saber adonde vamos,
ni de dónde venimos...!

Michael
Faraday
T
HE distinguished British scientist Sir Humphrey Davy was
once asked what he considered his greatest discovery.
"Michael Faraday," was his answer. The son of a blacksmith,
Faraday (1791-1867) had little formal education, but as a book¬
binder's apprentice, he became fascinated by the scientific
treatises in the books he bound. He devoured this knowledge,
attended scientific lectures and at the age of 22, was engaged
as laboratory assistant to Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal
Institution in London. Thereafter, he was to perform experi¬
ments which yielded some of the most significant inventions
and principles in scientific history. He built the first rotary
electric motor (1821), the first transformer and the first dynamo
(both in 1831). Every generator, every electric motor and
transformer, every one of the innumerable pieces of electric
equipment all over the world operates today because of Fara¬
day's work in electromagnetism. Faraday also made notable
contributions to chemistry, including the liquifying of gases by
use of pressure and the discovery of benzine. His laws of
electrolysis linked chemistry and electricity and paved the way
for today's electro-plating industry. Faraday's outstanding
achievement was the discovery of electromagnetic induction:
that moving a magnet rapidly near a coil of wire produces an
electric current. A lady who saw his perform the experiment
asked, "But, Professor Faraday, even if the effect you explained
is obtained, what is the use of it?" "Madam", replied Faraday,
"will you tell me the use of a new-born child?"
Johann
Bernoulli
B«FORN in 1667, Johann Bernoulli, the distinguished Swiss
mathematician, came from a family which left Antwerp to
escape religious persecution and settled in Basle. Over the
next two centuries, the family produced so many scientists
that encyclopedias'today distinguish them by putting a number
beside their christian names, as in the case of kings. The
name of Johann Bernoulli, however, stands out above the rest.
As a young man he held a minor post in commerce and then
studied mathematics and medicine. In 1694 he was awarded
his doctorate at the University of Basle and the following year
became a professor at the University of Groningen. His next
post was at the University of Basle where he succeeded his
brother Jacob (a mathematician celebrated for his work on the
differential and integral calculus). A friend of Leibnitz, Johann
Bernoulli discovered the exponential calculus and was the first
scientist to determine the line of swiftest descent followed by
a body. Before he died in 1748, Johann Bernoulli trained a
number of young men who were also to become eminent in
science his sons Nicholas I, Daniel and Johann II, and Leonard
Euler. AH four made important contributions to the develop¬
ment of mathematics and physics.
Jonathan
Swift
J,IONATHAN Swift(1 667-1 745) was one of the greatest satirists
of all time and one of the most misunderstood. Many people,
not seeing what lies behind the savage irony of his work,
have represented him as harsh and misanthropic. Yet the
venom of Swift's pen contrasts sharply with the humanity
and charity he showed to friends, relatives and the poor.
He left all his modest fortune to build and endow a hospital
for lunatics, idiots and, as he put it, "those they call incurable."
Even his greatest work, "Gulliver's Travels," intended as a
ferocious indictment of human nature, delighted the world
instead of shocking it. The strange lands visited by Gulliver
had much in common with the countries Swift knew. The
tiny Lilliputians had the vices and weaknesses of ordinary
men. In the island of Laputa, where "wise" men were
engaged on fantastic projects, Swift parodied some of the
scientists and philosophers of his own day. Born in Dublin of
English parents, Swift was educated in Ireland where he entered
the church in 1695. The country vicar gradually became well
known through the writing of minor political tracts, but the
publication of "Tale of a Tub" made him famous overnight.
This satire on humanity in general and the church in particular,
and "The Battle of the Books," a parody of literary controversy
(both published in 1704) are still read for their comic commen¬
tary on human stupidity. With the "Drapiers Letters" (1724).
Swift foiled the British Government in its attempts to impose a
debased currency on Ireland, and five years later he published
perhaps his most terrible satiric pamphlet, "A Modest Propo¬
sal" that the people of Ireland eat their children as the only
way to keep England from starving them to death. Swift
continued to defend Ireland's cause and for the rest of his
life he was the idol of the Irish people.

José Enrique
Rodo
A,IMONG the score of brillant literary figures flourishing in
Uruguay at the turn of the century, the one who best embodies
the hopes and ideals of the times is the essayist and
philosopher Jose Henrique Rodó (1872-1917). A mostly self-
taught scholar, Rodó managed to reflect his vast culture and
love of beauty in a prose of extraordinary flexibility and
elegance, ill reflected in most of the translations of his works.
Rubén Dario, whose genius Rodó was one of the first to
recognize, was to say of him: "José Enrique Rodó is the
Spanish-American thinker of our times. . . I would say that
he is a sort of Latin Emerson, with a serenity originating in
Greece." For all his love of ancient Greece, Rodó had the
French philosopher Fenan for an ideological model. His own
life oddly resembles that of his master. But in a literary
magazine of which he was a co-founder in 1895, he became from
the start a penetrating critic of the new Spanish writing. He
analyzed and praised the work of the young Spanish-American
poets. "Ariel," a call to a new idealism published in 1900,
when the clouds of social change and revolution were already
gathering in the European skies, was a lesson on democracy
addressed to the Spanish-American youth; it is interesting
to note it has lately had quite a revival. The beginning of
the century was a time of social reforms, the heyday of the
liberalism and the moderation of which Rodó became a
champion. A plea for the protection of child labour made
a sensation in 1903, when he wrote a study on working
conditions in Uruguay. In 1909, Rodó published his master¬
piece, "Motives of Proteus": meditations, parables, aphorisms
and maxims whose central theme is the lifelong evolution of
man and his need to direct it through self-knowledge.
Georg Philipp
Telemann
S,MX thousand works, including 44 Passions, 100 oratorios,
40 operas and 12 cycles of cantatas, each of 52 works
composed the voluminous musical heritage left by Georg Philipp
Telemann, a gifted musician and the most prolific composer
of 18th century Germany. Born in Magdeburg in 1681, he
composed his first opera at the age of 12, an accomplishment
that displeased his parents who planned to make a lawyer
of this born musician. Aged 27 and already famous, he was
appointed as Kapellmeister at Eisenach where he met Johann
Sebastian Bach, became his friend and was later godfather
to Bach's son, Karl Philipp Emanuel. When Telemann died
in 1767 at the age of 86, his godson succeeded him as director
of church music in Hamburg. At that time Telemann's music
was admired in every part of Europe. But his works were
soon forgotten and some fifty years later Franz Schubert
condemned the world's neglect of a composer who he
considered as "a master among the masters". Today Telemann
is acknowledged as an innovator who was able to infuse
into the new classicism all the grace and vigour of Baroque
music.
Nicolai
Lobachevsky
FcOR centuries the world's basic textbook on geometry was
the "Elements" of the Greek mathematician Euclid written
about 320 B.C. For nearly 2,000 years no one presumed to
question Euclid's famous postulate that only one line parallel
to a given line can be drawn through a fixed point. The man
who challenged this by advancing his own "scandalous"
postulate that there are two parallels to the given line through
any fixed point was the Russian . mathematician Nikolai
Lobachevsky (1792-1856), who founded the new school of
"hyperbolic" or "non Euclidean" geometry. Lobachevsky's
entire academic life was linked with the University of Kazan
(a city on the Volga, and today capital of the Tatar Republic)
where he was a student, then a teacher and finally rector.
His searching mind was to question not only long-accepted
scientific beliefs but also, and as a result, some of the
foundations of the philosophy of idealism which affirmed the
a priori character of Euclidean ideas, without foreseeing that
this could ever be contradicted. Lobachevsky announced his
first studies on the new system of geometry in 1826 (when he
was 34) and completed it in 1855. Conceived and developed
independently, it agreed with conclusions reached by the
German mathematician Frederic Gauss and by the Hungarian
Janos Bolyai. The name of Lobachevsky thus remains
inseparably associated with non-Euclidean geometry and with
a striking revolution in human thought.
Petr
Bezruc
|N his homeland, Czechoslovakia, Petr Bezruc is one of the
best known and appreciated of poets, and some of his
poems have been translated into many languages. The poet's
real name was Vladimir Vasek. Petr Bezruc was the pseu¬
donym under which he wrote verses extolling the Czech
struggle for national rights and denouncing the social, economic
and ethnic oppression of his people by the Austro-Hungarian
empire. Petr Bezruc was born in Opava, Silesia, in 1867. His
father, Antonin Vasek, a schoolmaster and journalist, was one
of the Czech nationalists whose struggle against Habsburg
domination grew sharper towards the end of the 19th century.
Petr Bezruc's first verses were published in 1899 and many
of his poems were later collected in book form as "Silesian
Songs" (a selection translated into English was published by
Artia, Prague, in 1966). He was not a professional poet in the
sense of having literary aspirations. As he once put it: "Year
after year, the immense oppression weighed upon me... so I
wrote down these few poems to give voice to that oppression.
If they have had effect it is only the truth of rattling chains."

Vicente
Blasco Ibanez
V ÍCENTE Blasco Ibañez, born in Valencia, Spain, in 1867,
started writing' at the age of 12. At 14, he was already
completing, in Madrid, the works of a novelist who had engaged
him as his secretary. His youth was marked by incessant
pamphleteering and political protest, which forced him twice to
flee Spain and took him to jail about 30 times. He also was
elected six times to the Spanish Cortes. In 1909, tired of
politics, he went to Argentina, whose scene was to inspire
three of his most famous novels. One of them, "The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse," published in 1914 more as an
anticipation than an actual comment on the world conflict, was
the first international success among modern war novels,
opening to him the doors of the American literary market and
Hollywood fame. Blasco Ibañez died a millionaire. He wrote
no less than 30 novels which reveal his talent for creating
characters and his gift for conducting narrative action.
Charles
Baudelaire
THE "case" of Baudelaire is unique in the history of literature
already rich In examples of misunderstanding and dramatic
reversals of opinion. Charles Baudelaire, one of the greatest
names in French poetry, gained the recognition refused him
in his lifetime long after his death in 1867. Born in 1821, he
began to write at an early age. Among the poems in Les
Fleurs du Mal (The Flowers of Evil), a collection published In
1857, are some he wrote In 1842 and 1843. The book caused
a scandal and Baudelaire was prosecuted for offending against
public morals. Although such literary giants as Victor Hugo
and Théophile Gautier recognized in Baudelaire a writer of
startling originality, the poet's works were scorned by the
critics in vogue and he was wantonly vilified. It was perhapè
less his private life (somewhat wild and unrestrained for his
day) than the profound distress that imbued his poems and his
discovery of "modernity" (a word he coined) which earned
him the suspicion and hatred of contemporary society. That
society had no wish to question any of the established social
or literary norms nor to consider the possibility of the
metamorphosis of such values. Baudelaire created a new
poetical art that was to make its impact on French literature
and prepare the way for Rimbaud and Mallarmé. A brilliant
critic he drew attention to new aesthetic values in many fields.
In literature, for example, he revealed to his countrymen the
works of Edgar Allan Poe, in French versions that are
masterpieces of the translator's art. In music he analyzed
the revolutionary innovations of Richard Wagner. In painting,
his studies on Eugène Delacroix, Constantine Guys, Daumier
and Edouard Manet brought out the meaning of the new tones
and forms In colour and drawing. Baudelaire's personal
journals speak of his prolonged sufferings and his solitude
from which a serious illness delivered him in 1867.
Luigi
Pirandello
F OR nearly half a century, the name of Luigi Pirandello
dominated Italian Letters. When Pirandello was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934, two years before his death,
he had become a world-famous dramatist who had given the
theatre a new psychological dimension. Born in 1867 at
Agrigente in Sicily, he first taught Italian literature in Rome
and began publishing short stories and novels in 1893. Many
of these deal with the lower middle class milieu or the farming
communities in Sicily. Though Pirandello wrote some
300 stories and six novels, his work as a novelist has been
somewhat obscured by his fame as a playwright, though he
used the same themes in both media. Novels such as "The
Late Mattia Pascal" (1904) reveal the same irony, the same
compassion that inspired the author to create the contradictory
and vacillating characters found in many of his plays.
Pirandello's main themes are the necessity and vanity of
illusion, the multiform appearances, all of them unreal, of what
is presumed to be the truth; man is not what he thinks he is,
but he Is "one, no one and a hundred thousand" (the title of
a Pirandello novel) according as he appears to different
persons, and is always different from what he creates himself
in his own mind. Pirandello's plays have been translated into
many languages, and have taken their places among the
masterpieces of the modern theatre.
A
60th anniversary of the use of
Arabic in Egyptian schools
RABIC is today a language fully adapted to the needs of .
the 20th century with an abundant vocabulary of technological
and scientific terms which, as it continues to expand, constantly
adds new, expressive terms to the language of the Koran.
Scientific works, technical manuals, books and reviews on
science are written in Arabic or translated Into it. The up-to-
date vocabulary of the spoken word, with its mobility,
inventiveness and imagery is being grafted on to the traditional
written language, bringing with it the new ideas of the atomic
age and the era of space exploration. The swift renovation of
Arabic io all the more remarkable In view of the decline it
suffered for four centuries following the invasion of Egypt by
the Turks in 1517. Until the beginning of the 19th century
Turkish replaced Arabic which thus was in danger of becoming
a dead language. Since the first Arabic language university
was created in Egypt sixty years ago and the use of Arabic
was established for schools, the press and government
services, the language has recovered its vigour and powers
of adaptability. The Unesco General Conference in 1966
decided to add Arabic to English, French, Spanish and Russian
as a working language of Unesco.

THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME
A new form of aid for development
by Colin Mackenzie
30
ODERN international aid,
in the years since the discovery that
wealth can be shared without too much
risk, with honour and indeed with pro¬
fit, has come to assume varied forms.
Cash of course predominates for, as
Schopenhauer once remarked, money
is the one thing which is not only a
concrete satisfaction of one need in
particular, but an abstract satisfaction
of all. In addition, however, there is
a wide variety of material and equip¬
ment. There is also technical advice
experts of one kind and another
spread around the developing coun¬
tries armed with anything from syringes
to theodolites. And now, as a rela¬
tively new form of aid, there is food.
Relatively new? After all, as long
ago as the third century B.C., Hleron II,
Tyrant of Syracuse, sent grain to Egypt
in time of famine. Yes, but food aid
today is something rather different. It
is not merely concerned with the feed¬
ing of hungry people, for, in the con¬
text of the looming world food crisis,
such a course would be not only
completely insignificant in relation to
the size of the problem but also totally
irrelevant to the need for curing the
basic economic malaise which has
caused it. Food aid, like other forms
of modern aid, is intended to produce
something more tangible and materially
lasting than the prospect of a descent
of blessings on the givers.
To get an idea of food in action as
a stimulus to a country's economic and
social development, one needs to look
at some of the projects that the World
Food Programme (W.FP) is aiding.
In the north of Morocco, some
30,000 children are being fed in pri¬
mary and secondary schools in seve¬
ral areas, with the result that enrol¬
ment is up by 15 to 20 per cent. This
means that one day there may be just
that many more doctors or administra
tors or engineers in Morocco than
there would otherwise have been.
In 1964, the Programme invested
some $300,000 to help in the
reclamation of land in the Republic of
China. The food was distributed for
two years to settlers while they went
about preparing the land and sowing
their crops. Now, 2,500 hectares
(6,200 acres) of wasteland have been
transformed into prosperous farms
whose annual production will be worth
five times the original investment of
food.
In Columbia, inhabitants of some of
the poorer city suburbs have worked
after hours paving their own streets.
Their incentive and to some extent
their compensation was the food sup¬
plied by the Programme.
In one village in Senegal, one ton
of couscous made from WFP sorghum
was used to mobilize enough people to
clear and plant enough land to pro¬
duce 45 tons of rice.
Ihese are a few small in¬
stances taken at random from the 230-
odd projects that have been approved
since the Programme started opera¬
tions at the beginning of 1963. The
range of development activities it has
aided is very wide.
There have been projects for feed¬
ing, not only school-children and stu¬
dents, but also expectant and nursing
mothers and children still too young
to go to school all this investment in
countries' future resources in human
skills.
The Programme has helped to
resettle Bedouins in the Middle East,
refugees in Africa and communities
threatened with inundation after the
building of the Aswan Dam. With the
food it has supplied, previously unem¬
ployed (or underemployed) rural wor¬
kers have set to work planting new or
more abundant forests, particularly in
sorely eroded areas around the Medi¬
terranean where there are the ravages
of 2,000 or 3,000 years to be repaired.
It provides animal feed to help fatten
and multiply a country's livestock.
There is a $10,000,000 project to im¬
prove milk supplies in India. Roads
have been built in one instance, in an
island off Korea, linking up 95 isolated
villages. There are projects in Tur¬
key to» help feed workers in some
industries and mines and thus boost
productivity. WFP food has been used
as part payment of the wages of wor¬
kers repairing the famous Hedjaz
Railway that runs from Damascus to
Medina and was originally built
largely to carry Moslem pilgrims.
A point to be remembered about the
Programme's assistance to countries
in their pursuit of economic and social
development is that it is only assis¬
tance. It has been found that, on aver¬
age, something like 80 per cent of
the costs of projects is borne by the
countries themselves. WFP aid is
often primarily a stimulus, the extra
incentive that makes the difference
between whether a project is started
or not.
It was said earlier that merely feed¬
ing the hungry is not enough. But
there are of course times of dire emer¬
gency when not feeding the hungry
would also be less than enough. That
is why the Programme, with the stocks
of food it has at its disposal, also
comes to the aid of victims of emer¬
gencies, whether these are sudden,
unforeseeable catastrophes like hurri¬
canes, typhoons, earthquakes and vol¬
canic eruptions or the slowly punishing
ravages of a long drought.
Emergency operations, however, are

not the primary aim of the Programme,
and so far never more than about a
quarter of its resources have been
allocated to them in any one year. The
success of the operations has varied
inversely with the size of the emergency
and the number of victims. In Bots¬
wana, where there was a prolonged
drought, food supplies at a total cost
of less than $5.5 million helped to keep
the entire country going for several
months when things were at their
worst. On the other hand, more than
$13.5 million spent in the last year or
so on sending food to the drought-
stricken areas of India, including the
states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, has
had little impact on so wide a sweep
of suffering.
The fact is that the resources
of the World Food Programme,
as yet, are totally inadequate for
meeting any kind of famine on the
scale that now seems to threaten.
What are these resources? And,
indeed, how did the World Food Pro¬
gramme come into being at all?
The story probably goes back to
the 1930s, when for the first time
people were struck by the disquieting
phenomenon of a glut of huge, waste
ful agricultural surpluses in some coun¬
tries (notably the United States,
although in Brazil too, for example,
75 million bags of coffee had to be
burned during the period) while masses
of people in other areas of the world
went hungry. It was the pressure to'
find an outlet for surpluses that origi¬
nally prompted the idea of food aid.
From the end of the Second World
War, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) worked hard on
the problem of surplus disposal, but
the most important large-scale initia¬
tive for putting food aid into practice
was taken by the United States in
1954 with the passage of an Act
usually known as Public Law 480 as
a result of which $13,000 million worth
of surplus agricultural commodities
were shipped to other countries in the
decade that followed.
By this time, however, the idea of
development aid on the multilateral
pattern was gaining ground, especially
following the heavy influx of newly-
independent nations into the councils
of the United Nations and its Specia¬
lized Agencies.
So the two trends a constructive
method of surplus disposal and the
new emphasis on multilateral aid
merged. At the end of 1961, follow¬
ing studies carried out by FAO at the
United Nations' request, parallel reso¬
lutions in the two organizations set up
the World Food Programme on an
experimental three-year basis with a
target of $100 million in commodities
and cash. Thus the Programme,
which formally started operations on
January 1, 1963, is the child of both
the United Nations, with its general
concern for economic and social dev¬
elopment, and FAO, with its special
competence in matters connected with
food.
By the end of 1965 when the ex¬
perimental period was drawing to a
close, the Programme had sufficiently
proved itself for the United Nations and
FAO to decide to continue it "for as
long as multilateral food aid is found
feasible and desirable." Despite the
fact that by its nature the Programme
is meant to be only a preliminary
to plenitude, this looks like being for
some while yet.
The Programme lives by pledges of
commodities and cash from its parti¬
cipating countries participation is

open to all Members of the United
Nations or FAO. The proportion is
two-thirds in commodities food and
animal feed,, with cereals heavily pre¬
dominating and one-third in cash or
services such as shipping. During
the 1963-5 experimental period, the
target of $100 million was very nearly
fully subscribed. For the new three-
year pledging period 1966-8, a much
higher target was set $275 million.
This time the response in pledges has
been 'proportionately much lower the
resources at present available to the
Programme are worth less than
$60 million a year, a figure which
should be set against the annual
$1,500 million to $2,000 million which
represents the totality of food aid in
recent years.
In comparing these figures, it should
once again be remembered that there
is a growing preference for multila¬
teral aid not only among the dev¬
eloping countries which would thereby
have a greater say in events, but also,
in the case of food aid, among some
of the major donors which would like
to see the burden more evenly shared.
It may thus be that the Programme will
be allotted a really sizeable part of
the extra 4.5 million tons of food aid
that was agreed on in the closing days
or nights of the Kennedy Round
negotiations, and also that future
pledging targets and, even more per¬
tinently, the pledges themselves will
in the 1970s go sufficiently beyond the
$200 million now proposed for the two-
year period 1969-70 to enable the Pro¬
gramme to measure up more adequa¬
tely for its part to the trials awaiting
the international community.
The curious might, still inquire how
the Programme actually handles the
food it already has. The answer is
simple in general terms, but extremely
complicated in practice. Everything
must begin with a country's request for
aid which, in the case of development
projects, is submitted to a formidable
process of scrutiny by the Executive
Director and his staff in Rome and by
whichever of the co-operating inter¬
national organizations is concerned
Unesco in the case, for example, of
a school-feeding project. The preli¬
minaries for emergency operations
which have to be authorized by the
FAO Director-General are naturally
much more summary.
Among the most strenuous com¬
plications are those of earmarking
and allocating the variety of food-

stuffs from the large number ' of
countries which have pledged them to
the variety of projects or emergency
operations needing them and in the
quantities and units in which they are
needed. At the end of 1966, about
40 countries had pledged food and
WFP was operating in about 50. In
addition, unless a donor country pro¬
vides its own shipping, the Programme
has to organize transport of the goods,
including insurance, to the recipient
country. The World Food Programme
is very much a business operation.
So, from what was originally the
problem of how to make the best use
of unwanted agricultural surpluses has
grown a new form of aid for develop¬
ment in the long-term interests of all.
The need is great, but so are the po¬
tentialities. It is worth recalling what
John F. Kennedy once said, even before
he became U.S. President, addressing
a farm audience at Mitchell, South
Dakota, in the late fifties. "I don't
regard the . . . agricultural surplus as
a problem," he declared. "I regard it
as an opportunity." For, he affirmed,
"...food Is strength, and food is
peace, and food is freedom, and food
is a helping hand to people around
the world ..."

From the Unesco New:
World's first 'International
Literacy Day' and the
Reza Pahlavi Literacy Prize
The world's first 'International Literacy
Day', was celebrated on September 8 in
all Unesco's member states. On this oc¬
casion, Mr René Maheu, speaking at Expo
67 in Montreal, and U Thant, Secretary-
General of the United Nations, called for
an international effort in support of the
global fight against illiteracy. On Septem¬
ber 7, Mr Maheu presided at the presen¬
tation of the first Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
Literacy Prize, during a ceremony held at
Unesco H.Q. in Paris. The $5,000 prize,
contributed by His Imperial Majesty the
Shahinshah of Iran, was awarded to stu¬
dents of the Girls Secondary School at
Tabora, Tanzania, who as volunteer teachers
visited homes and community centres to
give literacy teaching to more than 400
people. Their example has encouraged
students In other Tanzanian secondary
schools to start adult literacy classes.
Since 1964 Tanzania has developed literacy
programmes as part of its national develop¬
ment plan. By January 1965, 7,257 classes
were operating, attended by over 540,000
adults, of whom about two-thirds were
women.
Visitor from
outer space
A meteorite in two main pieces, one
weighing 12 tons and the other about 3
found in a remote part of Western Australia,
is Australia's largest meteorite and the
eleventh largest found in the world.
Geophysicists believe this visitor from outer
space is 93 per cent iron and nearly 7 per
cent nickel, that it crashed to earth tens
of thousands of years ago and probably
came from an asteroid belt between the
planets Jupiter and Mars.'
140,000 U.S.-international
educational exchanges
Over 140,000 persons college and
university students, teachers and scholars
were Involved in educational exchange
between the U.S. and 172 other countries
and territories in 1966-67, according to
"Open Doors" 1967, the annual survey of
educational exchange statistics published
by the Institute of International Education,
New York. This record figure included a
total of 100,262 students from abroad
enrolled In 1,797 U.S. institutions of higher
learning, which also were hosts to more
than 10,700 professors, scholars and
researchers from a record 118 countries.
Associated schools and
the Marie Curie centenary
To mark the centenary of the birth of
Marie Curie, Polish schools which are
members of the Unesco Associated Schools
project have prepared materials on her life
and work for the schools abroad that they
correspond with. A suggestion by the
Polish National Commission for Unesco has
led to the "twinning" of the Marie Sklodow-
ska-Curie School in Lublin with the Lycée
Marie Curie at Sceaux, near Paris.

New Soviet vessels
for 'World Weather Watch'
The Soviet Union is building about ten
new research ships some of which will
supply vital data for the World Weather
Watch programme during its first phase
1968-71. The programme calls for at least
seven new weather ship stations to fill
"gaps" in the southern hemisphere. The
Soviet ships are expected also to under¬
take important work in oceanography,
communications data, processing, fore¬
casting and, especially, storm warnings.
As ocean areas cover 70 per cent of the
surface of the globe and are poorly served
by meteorological stations, the weather
watch programme will also make more use
of merchant shipping for obtaining
observations.
Saving grain by
nuclear radiation
The world's first plant for saving grain
by using nuclear radiation to kill insect
pests is installed at Iskenderun, Turkey.
Grain from large hoppers falls past a
powerful source of radioactive cobalt
whose gamma radiation sterilizes the insects
in the grain. A degree of protection is
thus given against reinfestation by the same
species. World grain losses through in¬
sects total some 5 per cent of all grain
produced; the amount lost each year could
feed 100 million people.
Floating laboratory
for ocean research
A new ocean research vessel, the
"Oceanographer" has been launched in
the U.S.A. Designed to stay at sea for
five months at a time, the ship has over
4,000 square feet of laboratory space, and
a computer capable of 10,000 operations
a second. The computer will be used to
sort, analyze and store data on temper¬
atures, sediments, currents and other mari¬
time phenomena.

Letters to the Editor

LESSON FROM THE PAST
Sir,
I have been deeply shocked by the
recent tragic conflict in the Middle
East. It has shown once more that
only an atmosphere of friendship and
mutual understanding can bring the
true peace and effective co-operation
so urgently needed by both Jews and
Arabs.
A Utopian thought? It may seem
so nowadays, but there were times,
indeed centuries, when peaceful co¬
existence and cultural exchanges
existed between these peoples and
brought fruitful results in Medieval
Spain for example. One need only
recall the achievements of such great
thinkers as Maimonides, the Jewish
rabbi, savant, physician and philos¬
opher and his contemporary, Averroes,
the Arab scholar, lawyer and phil¬
osopher.
By publishing a number of the
"Unesco Courier" devoted to the
cultural and scientific aspects of Arab-
Jewish co-operation in the past,
Unesco could make an important
contribution to the cause of peace
in the Middle East.

NEW LIGHT ON
POPULATION PROBLEMS
Sir,
The presentation of the population
problems facing our children and
grandchildren ("Unesco Courier", Feb¬
ruary 1967) was fascinating. How¬
ever, your distinguished contributors
and in this they follow most contem¬
porary scientific .writers may have
accepted too easily the current pro¬
jections of the orthodox demographers.
In the face of such overpowering
figures, has objective, and especially
external judgment of these parameters
been suspended just a bit? The line
of man's fate seldom turns out to be
the shortest distance between two
points, and it seems time that related
disciplines brought their gains to bear
more closely on the demographers.
In the last few years developments,
even revolutions, in accepted concepts
in anthropology, zoology, physiology
and in particular endocrinology, and
psychosomatic and psychological
medicine have produced potentially
enormous contributions, which have
not been fully integrated in the main
demographic stream. There is a wealth
of deductions to be harvested for in¬
stance from the work of Leakey,
Keith, La Barre, Marais, Elliott,
CR. Carpenter, Wynne-Edwards, Bolk,
J.J. Christian and A.D. Jonas, to name
but a few. In some sections, popu¬
larization is abreast or even ahead
of the academics exemplified by
Ardrey's "Territoria Imperative", which
will mean much more to demography
than has yet been expounded.
Insights from the disciplines men¬
tioned can provide for instance the
sort of links which Jean Fourastié is
seeking in his passage on the "four
quantities of space". A striking fore¬
taste of the way in which, when a
wider range of disciplines is called
in aid, some of the present question-
marks in studies of population, in¬
dustrialization and urbanization, and
medicine fall into place was provided
in a paper read at the last annual
meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science
by the Swedish demographer, Olin,
entitled: "Feedback mechanisms in
human populations: a hypothesis
about the self-regulation of population
growth". This opens up the possi¬
bility of a more hopeful adjustment
of projections, which the press in
North America was quick to seize
upon.
The rapid mobilization of inter¬
disciplinary influences on contempo¬
rary demography will be a vastly in¬
tricate and highly intellectual task,
which Unesco should be particularly
well fitted to foster.

'AFRICAN ARTS -
ARTS D'AFRIQUE
Sir,
Readers who enjoyed your excellent
June 1967 Issue devoted to "Africa
and the African Genius", may be
interested to know that in October,
1967, the African Studies Center of
the University of California, is bring¬
ing out a new quarterly, African Arts-
Arts d'Afrique.
This magazine, richly illustrated (in¬
cluding full-colour pages), will serve
to record African traditional art and
to encourage contemporary African
artists in all fields of artistic endea¬
vour, graphic, plastic, performing, and
literary. Its mission also is to broaden
the appreciation of the art of Africa,
in and beyond Africa.
Congratulations on the continued
excellence of the "Unesco Courier".

MAN AND HIS RELIGION
Sir,
In your April 1967 issue I especially
loved the centre colour page (stained
glass, Tournai Cathedral). That naugh¬
ty prelate taking precious cash from
the bread-seller is admirable.
On another subject: the EXPO 67
article is excellent but I wish you
could have found space for a photo¬
graph of Canada's own pavilion. I
find the architecture of this pavilion
quite outstanding of equal interest to
that of "Habitat", for example. And
the theme of the Canadian Pavilion
gives the theme of the entire EXPO
in miniature. Perhaps you could
publish a separate article about this
Pavilion in a later issue.
It is ironic that, among all the
themes of EXPO, there is no mention
of Man and his Religion. Perhaps,
indeed, we modern prelates would
have been unable ever to agree on
the contents of such a Pavilion (yes,
in spite of the World Council of
Churches and Vatican II). But this
omission points up an enormous "la¬
cune" in EXPO 67; an enormous
"lacune" also in the U.N., in Unesco
and in the world. However I am old
enough and (maybe) wise enough to
realize that I suggest the impossible
. . . but since "all things are possible
with God", I daresay I don't care
overmuch.
Please don't tell me that there is
a Pavilion devoted to Religion at
EXPO 67. I know this already, but it
pays only lip-service to what I am
trying to say.

HIROSHIMA'S MONUMENT
Sir,
Reading your article on the statues
of Rameses II at Abu Simbel being
given a new home (February 1967)
reminded me that we in Hiroshima
also had a monument awaiting pre¬
servation the ruins of the municipal
buildings high above whose dome the
first atomic bomb was exploded in
1945.
The campaign to maintain the ruins
as a monument began in Hiroshima
and became nationwide, but municipal
funds for urgent preservation measu¬
res were insufficient. More money
was raised and the task is in hand.
It is not our Intention to comme¬
morate hatred or revenge against
America. We aim to end war for all
time by instilling the desire for peace
in the minds of all who will come
to see the dome. We support the
Constitution of Unesco.

the globe millions go hungry while elsewhere countries have difficulty in
finding outlets for their surplus food. To meet this paradoxical situation, the United Nations

food surpluses of 40 countries to relieve hunger and malnutrition in fifty others, (see page 30).
