The printed word and the
world paper crisis
WORDS and images printed on paper have been
the means by which men and women in all
countries have most often and most widely
made contact with one another across geographical dis-
tance and through historical time.
The wisdom of the ages, and the thoughts and feel-
ings of the human beings who made or preserved it,
have come to each new generation largely through
books printed on paper. Education has from time
immemorial depended on such books-old and new.
And in our own era of great development of communica-
tion among masses of men, the exchange of factual
information through words print : d on paper has become
a vital element in the mutual understanding among
peoples which is the very foundation of peace and pro-
gress, as well as of the enrichment of civilization itself.
New means of mass communication have evolved
and become enormously important-films, the radio
and television. But, with the steady advance of the
struggle against illiteracy and with the advance of new
forms of education, of the exchange of knowledge and
information, books, newspapers and periodical publica-
tions have also taken on added importance. And it
remains true that more men, women and children in
the world depend upon words and images printed on
paper for their information and knowledge than on any
other means of mass communication.
Hence, the availability of paper-for newspapers,
for books, for similar exchanges of facts and ideas-
is a matter of deep and immediate concern for practic-
ally every person in the world, and certainly for all
national groups, for all forms of society.
Unfortunately there is a serious lack of balance
between the available supply and the growing need for
newsprint-the kind of paper used for newspapers.
Moreover, there is also a grave discrepancy between the
need and the use of newsprint-a lack of harmony in
the distribution.
The effect, in technical respect, of the relative
shortage and of the inequitable distribution of news-
print is to raise prices, hence to make this basic where-
withal of information even less available in precisely
those vast areas of the world which need it most-those
areas where the struggle against illiteracy con only go
forward with books, and the paper to print those books.
And the general effect is to deprive many millions of
men and women of the chance to find out what they
need to know about the world in which they live.
Lack of the paper to carry the message of informa-
tion means lack of the awareness, the interest and the
sense of participation and personal responsibility that
play so large a role in sound citizenship. Limitation of
education inevitably penalizes progress ; and since it is
in the minds of men everywhere that the foundations of
peace must be laid, the shortage of newsprint acts as a
brake on the co-operation of all peoples toward a just
and durable peace.
For the past few years, Unesco has been studying
various factors related to the distribution of the world's
paper supply. It has assembled the facts on the pro-
duction and consumption of both newsprint and print-
ing paper and made these facts public. Acting'on a
resolution voted by the General Conference of Unesco
last year, the Director-General asked the Secretary-Ge-
neral of the United Nations to place the newsprint
problem on the agenda of the Economic and Social
Council. This was done. In August, 1951, ECOSOC
adopted a resolution proposing both short-term and
long-term action. It directed an appeal to the main
consumers of paper to reduce slightly their consumption,
and to producers to expand their production. A recom-
mendation was also made to governments to draw the
attention of their nationals to this appeal and to the
desirability of voluntary co-operation. The Food and
Agriculture Organization was requested to continue its
studies and research into forestry resources, so as to
indicate measures for increasing production, including
the use or substitute raw materials. During the FAO
conference in Rome last November and December, a
series of decisions was approved to decrease and gra-
dually overcome the present deficit of newsprint and
printing paper. (Details of these decisions wilL be found
on page 13 of this issue.)
Today, a new kind of hunger is spreading across the
globe. For have not books, magazines, newspapers
and every category of printed publication been called
the chief nourishment for the human mind ? The new
hunger is robbing millions of men of their mental nou-
rishment. Only planned world action can halt it.

Lame Morel', CuI'ly-hpaded Iorel, Morel the
Deputy Mayor and so on. But the \"iIlage
blacksmith, although aged 46, had to wait
until last year before he had the most high-
sounding nickname of all conferred upon
him :"EquaHty"More).
It is no use asking-"Eqllality" Morel how
he got the name. He

a story.
Sitting in the café
opposite the village
post office, the Mayor
Will start on the
story once he has
filled his pipe and
taken a sip of pasts.
"Well,"he tells you,
"Morel got the name
because of the poster
about Human Rights
and the business
of Blanchette. Blan-
chette was a Negro
working on the
threshing machine.
You know, all sods of
fellows work on
these threshing gangs.
They come from the
north and the south ;
often they don't even
speak French. The
people round here
have seen Poles, Ita-
lians, Spaniards and
Arabs before, but
this was the first
time there'd been a Negro in the village.
"\well, complaints started to come in at
once. A couple of chickens were stolen
from a farm-they said it must be the
Negro. A rabbit was killed on another farm
- the Negro again. If the weather turned
bad, it was all because of the Negro. You
'could have thought that Blanchette was'he
devil himself. In fact, one Sunday, an old
maid came up to me :'Aren't you ashamed,'
she cried,'to let this devil stay in the village ?
We are all afraid to go out at night.'
"Such foolishness did not really matter
very much, and Blanchette's employer
insisted that the Negro was a good worker
and never caused any trouble, and I think
that things would have calmed down. But
one day something Worse happened in the
village : a hay stack caught fire and burned
to the ground.
"Who do you think it belonged to ? Why,
by Georges FRADIER
the old maid, of course. This time the real
trouble began. The police came along and
questioned everybody, but since they couldn't
find any real evidence about the cause of
the fire, they couldn't accuse anyone.
"The people here, of course, all said it
was a waste of time to hold an enquiry.
Everyone believed that Blanchette had
started the firs, and for three days the
Negro's boss had to be his bodyguard.
Then, what I had been afraid of, happened.
A full-scale delegation, led by the women,
came marching up to the town haH. Quite
honestly I couldn't see the use of resisting
any longer. Blanchette's employer was fed
up, and the only thing he felt he could do
was to pay the poor chap off and send him
away to shift for himself elsewhere.
"Well, at that point, Moret turned up. I
never thought I'd see anything like it in
the village. The hall was packed ; the
women were chattering ; the mew were
muttering. In comes More ! and sits down
beside me.'Antoine,'he says, in a loud
voice,'If you do this, you're a swine,'
and, thumping his fist on the table,'And
the rest of you, too.'What a grand sight it
was. The others tried to interrupt him,
calling him alp sorts of names, but he
shouted them all down and in the end they
had to listen to him. I never knew he
could talk so well.
"'You're accusing a man,'he said,'you
blame him for every crime that's committed.
Why ? Have you any evidence ? Have you
show you what rights
mean.'And with that
he took down a poster
that the schoolmaster
had got from Vatence,
and which had been
put up on the vall for
some reason or other.
It was the Universal
Declaration of Human
Rights.
"'Here,'says Morel,
.'here's a declaration
that our Government
and dozens of other
Governments h a v e
signed. A Universal
Declaration. Its meant
for everybody-
every man and every
woman Article 1.'
And he began to read
out Article 1. But
he didn't read it like
a lawyer. Oh, no ! He
was furious as he read
it ! Then came Ar-
ticle 2. It was about
all human beings, you
know, free and equal,
without distinction of
race, colour, etc. He
read it slowly and
even translated it into
our patois to make
sure that it was
understood. It was
grand to watch, I can
tell you."
By the time he gets
to his third pastis, the
Mayor is even more
enthusiastic."It was
really magnificent,"
he says. Then he
relights his pipe and
goes on, shaking his
finger for emphasis ;
"And would you
believe it ; he actually
managed to calm the
people down ; he got
them laughing and
rr) f) de them see that
the whole thing was ridiculous. The people
round here are a very decent lot. In a week's
time, they were tumbling over themselves
to offer Blanchette a drink. All the same,
Morel had upset a few people with his
speech ; those who nicknamed him'Equal-
ity'Morel did not mean it as a compliment.
But he'd proved his point and the nickname
stuck."
The moral of this story may be obvious,
but it needs emphasizing, especially when
one remembers that there are many people
who, looking at the Universal Declaration
of Human Blights, shake their heads
sadly and comment,"A fine set of prin-
ciples, but they haven't had much effect."True, no tex  b itself can cco plish a mi-
racle, but the world could hope for a great
deal from this particular text if enough men
were willing and able to use it in the
manner of"Equality"Morel.
caught him red-handed ? No, of course you
haven't. Your only reason for suspecting
him is that his skin isn't the same colour as
yours. Now, why don't you just stop to
think for a moment ?'
"'We have thought !' one woman called
out.'This is a free country. \-Ve'\, e e\'ery
right to get rid of anyone we don't like. You
never know what such people may be up to.'
"Morel burst out laughing.'So that's what
you think,'he said,'you think you're entitled
to send off a poor workman to starve just
because you don't like the look of him ?
well, since you're talking about rights, I'll

THINGS ARE
LOOKING UP IN
THE'FORGOTTEN
VALLEY'
by Tibor ME. NDE.
tn) 947. the Government of Haiti and Unesco inau-gurated a pilot project in fundamental education
- that is, education to achieve better living stan-
dards-in the Marbial Valley region of this island republic.
This year, the Haiti project became part of Unesco's
programme of technical assistance for economic develop-
ment. Now educators from Haiti and Unesco are
working to make it a laboratory where teaching methods
and materials can be tested under practical conditions
before they are placed into general use. In order to
get a first-hand picture of conditions in Marbial, Mr. Tibor
Mende recently visited the Valley during a trip to Cen-
tral and South American countries on assignment for
Unesco. The article published below is the first of a
series which will appear in the Courier on Latin America.
PHOTO : PICTURE POST, R. S. KLEBOE
THE rain stopped, leaving thetropical vegetation which en-
veloped the wooden building
swollen with fresh water. Three
youngsters had been sheltering on
the verandah, talking seriously,
while the water dried up a little.
Now, we started to talk together,
their Creole resembling French as
much as my French their Creole.
Toulin Jeremi, a boy of 12, was
holding a piece of cow-horn in his
hands and Elid Daglin, a curly-
haired girl of nine, had her copy-
book. The third of the group,
Job Lerich, the tallest and oldest
of the three, stood by, listening
with all that aloofness of the most
experienced. After some hesita-
tion, they admitted that they were
talking of their plans for the
future.
The girl proved to be the most
communicative. They were talk-
ing, she said, of a store in the
Marbial Valley where they live.
She would be the couturier, taking
charge of dresses ; Job would make
sandals ; while Toulin was a born
merchant and would arrange mat-
ters very successfully. But Toulin
hastened to add that he too had
his speciality, and proudly showed
the cow-horn in his hand. With
the help of the instructor, he
explained, he had started to make
combs, and now he could finish one
in half-an-hour and sell it for
15 cents. Elid, with a bright
smile, interrupted him :"'He's
already selling them to the local
hairdresser, and even in Jacmel.
For this one, he has been paid in
advance...", and her little brown
face was shining with pride for all
three of them.
These three young Haitians
were children of the Valley. Their
parents and grandparents lived be-
tween the steep hills rising on both
sides of the Gosseline river. Tri-
vial as this chat with the three
children seems, there was some-
thing about it that was as new
and as startling in this sad valley
as if the denuded hillsides had
suddenly turned green again.
That something was hope.
Children in the Marbial Valley get lessons in Creole, the language which most Haitians speak.
This big noticeboard at the entrance of the Unesco Experimental Centre says, in Creole :
"Unesco Centre'Amikoiat'at Na Mago". Na Mago is a village on the road to Marbial.
The name of Marbial is little
known, even in the Caribbean area.
It is a forgotten valley. It has
neither villages nor hamlets, and
its people, living in their scattered
wooden huts, are no part of any
community : they are merely the
folk of Marbial. They have to
work hard to keep alive. A few
decades ago, as the older ones still
remember, life was much easier.
Since then tropical disease, soil
erosion and over-population have
combined to spread ignorance and
misery.
Trees have been cut down and
the once blossoming hillsides are
barren ; meat has become a rarity ;
children grow up illiterate and
their parents have to make almost
superhuman efforts to try to pay
off debts and feed their increasing
families. Most families own or
rent three to five acres of land, and
grow coffee for sale at the Jacmel
market ; but they must clear more
and more of the coffee groves
to produce maize and other
foodstuffs for themselves. While
the population of
the valley nears the
30, 000 mark and the
land is sub-divided
among the children
in ever smaller par-
cels, there is more
and more exhausted
land and the valley
has been lowly
dying.
In this picture of
desolation, the prac-
tices of Christianity
are but a thin ve-
neer over the old
African traditions.
The terrors of the
iupernatural world,
Jf voodoo and magic,
are still important
in the lives of the
people of Marbial.
But none of these
practices helps to
provide v'hat is so
deeply needed in
this atmosphere of deterioration
- hope.
There are some craftsmen among
the people of the valley, such as
leather workers, tailors and basket-
makers ; but their main job is on
the land, and their craftsmenship
only provides for the needs of the
neighbourhood. If Elid wants to
make dresses, Job to learn tanning
and make sandals, and Toulin to
make combs, there is nothing very
unusual in it. What is new is that
they are thinking of trade with the
town, of combining to create a
store, that they display an aware-
ness of things beyond the valley,
and that they are building plans
for the future. The new realiza-
tion of wider horizons beyond their
valley, the unconscious search for
something new for a better future
- these are new. They show that
these three young Haitians, in one
of the forgotten corners of their
country, have re-discovered what
their parents lost long ago : hope.
To reach the wooden verandah
where the three were discussing
their plans called for a rough jour-
ney of several hours in a jeep.
From Port-au-Prince the road leads
across plantations and forests, hills
and ravines ; often it disappears
under the thick tropical vegetation.
Or you can fly in a quarter-of-an-
hour from the capital to Jacmel,
where the plane lands on a meadow
studded with thatched cottages,
without a runway. From there,
along neglected roads, it is another
hour's drive to the Valley. After
the rains the river is often too
swollen even for the jeep, and the
traveller has to mount a horse to
cross it. Poor communication
have made it difficult to bring h'
to Elid, Job and Toulin.
When Unesco first decided to
"tart a pilot-scheme for basic edu-
cation in Haiti, the Marbial Valley
seemed the least promising place
for such an experiment. It was a
courageous decision to launch the
experiment among people bent
under the weight of a merciless

JANUARY ! 952 Page 5-UNESCO COURIER
RESULTS HAVE BEEN SLOW BUT UNMISTAKABLE
nature, rather than taking the
easier road. It meant that no
quick or spectacular results could
be expected ; but it also meant that,
in case of success, it would provide
experience which would prove in-
valuable in a variety of other tro-
pical areas faced with similar
obstacles and difficulties.
Today, after barely three years
of work, the decision seems to have
been justified. The results have
been slow, but they are un-
mistakable and have probably been
achieved more quickly than was
generally expected. The verandah
on which the children's conversa-
tion took place surrounded the
project's centre : their confidence
was a small and symbolic indication
of what the project was achieving.
From a small solitary building,
the centre has grown into a group
of hutments, carrying out a va-
riety of activities, all in a modest
way. It now has a primary school
with two classrooms and meagre
equipment for its 105 pupils aged
between six and 16. A doctor
holds a clinic four times a week, a
dentist receives patients once a
week, and the people of Marbial
are getting used to the idea of qua-
lified medical aid. They accept
this as one more example of the
usefulness of the centre in their
daily lives, and on the morning of
the appointed days long rows of pa-
tients queue up between the bananza
plants in front of the doctor's
building.
There is a small stock-raising
station which gives practical de-
monstrations under expert guid-
ance of better ways of poultry and
pig-raising, thus showing the local
farmers how they could apprecia-
bly improve their living conditions.
Its vegetable nurseries and affores-
tation school meet a similar need.
The activities of the Unesco
experimental s. tation are discussed
in the adult educational classes
and the results achieved are made
known to the population by word
and picture, by pamphlets and
leaflets written in simple language.
In tiny workshops, under the guid-
ance of local specialists, groups of
students learn sisal and mat
making, tanning and basketry. La-
ter, pottery-making will be taught.
There is plenty of clay in the Val-
ley, but up to now nothing has
been done to utilize it, though
potteries could contribute to the
meagre income of the population.
The credit co-operative, launched
with the help of a small Unesco
loan, is making good progress. Be-
gun in June 1950, it already has
over a hundred members and, apart
from its practical benefits, its open
discussions help members to air
their grievances and encourage
them to take an interest in the
improvement of their community.
The co-operative's meeting, usually
attended by the local priest, is
convincing proof that the self-
reliance and resourcefulness of the
peasants can be improved with a
judicious appeal to their self-inter-
est as well as to their co-operative
instincts. More recently a regional
committee was organized, and it is
fast becoming a democratic discus-
sion forum where constructive pro-
posals are examined and analysed
by the very people who would carry
them out.
While the new building of the
social worker's centre is under
construction, 19 small centres in
the open air are in operation. The
shaded and simple wooden benches
of these"classrooms"are used by
over 800 people, with an average
attendance of 40 adult pupils for
each group. Twenty student-teach-
ers, selected by competition, get a
token salary of $10 a month, while
the others come voluntarily before
or after their daily work in the
fields. Conventional subjects like
arithmetic and history are taught,
as well as practical subjects such
as hygiene, soil improvement and
domestic economy. The pride of
the centre is Visciere Pierre, a
woman of 42 who learnt to read
and write there and, in her anxiety
to disseminate her newly acquired
knowledge among the people of the
valley, is busily preparing for her
new role as a social worker. She
goes around and talks to people
about the great work ahead and
encourages them to follow her
example.
Added to a variety of other acti-
vities-like the regular spraying
of houses with DDT, the building
of pit-latrines, the hygienic clean-
ing-up of markets and the con-
struction of an abattoir to prevent
the bleeding of slaughtered animals
into the river-the centre is mak-
ing progress in the Marbial Valley.
People are displaying growing
confidence in the centre. No longer
do they just regard it as another
"official"building to do things for
them ; they realize that the centre
is there to help and guide them to
achievements by their own efforts.
In growing numbers they come
to the clinic and to the dentist and
discuss their personal problems
with the members of the centre.
As a typical example, the female
equivalent of the medicine-man in
the valley, the woman who used to
help at child-birth, is now attend-
ing the clinic to comp) her'2du-
cation with a few bits of"real
medicine". More and more of
the people of the valley send their
children to the centre with confi-
dence and its gardens and build-
ings are gay the whole day long
with children in classes, or
workshops, or at table-tennis.
And now two merchants from
the neighbouring town of Jacmel
have decided to establish branches
in the valley."'This is the first
time a merchant of Jacmel has
taken any interest in us,"a volun-
tary worker boasted to me."What
is more, once a week a bus has
started to come to the valley..."
And so, what were originally
reticent and suspicious peasant
greetings have now turned into
friendly smiles when the people of
the valley meet someone from the
centre. A new feeling is develop-
ing among them ; the incredulous
growing belief that, after all, the
people of'"the forgotten valley"
are not abandoned.

IF we put aside myths and assumptions, our civilization rests
on certain fundamental acquisitions. Among them are
those corner-stones of our age, the achievements of techno-
logy, which smooth and regulate our lives, enable us to move
easily from place to place, ensure our wellbeing and simplify,
yet complicate, our work ; all this for good or will, according to
whether we make them our servants or our masters.
Take paper, for example, whose beginnings seem almost
like a fable.
What must have been the astonishment of man when, after
long endeavour to perpetuate his name in stone or other mineral
substance, he first held in his hand this pulp, product of his
ingenuity, with its instant appeal to his mind. He must have
felt the delight of a child who wins a game, but fear, too, of that
blank surface in which can be discerned the duplication of the
self, a mirror in which the reflection outlives the original, in
which expression has to discover its rules and work out its forms,
a miraculous springboard off which the mind will plunge, silently
and alone. Through tentative gropings, clumsy reflections of
everyday life, the written word, by dint of toil, adapts itself to
human speech. Joy inspires songs, fear engenders myths,
until at last we get the first thoughts that reveal the man
himself, alike friendly and hostile to the world about him, proud
of controlling events and of mastering time, transforming the
past into the present, the present into the past, and proposing
that the future shall preserve the record of these changes.
Then scattered thoughts make room for systematic thinking.
The age of simplicity is past. Pride reverts to humility.
"Alas, for my glad thoughts of yesterday,"cried Nietzsche,
"what have I done with you ? What has become of you ?" Self-
knowledge is a labyrinth from which no one can find the way
out ; the enchanted path pursues its tortuous way, the writer a
prey to alternating moods of rapture and despair.
But writing leads to reading, and we can imagine the first
reader as we did the first writer-she was probably a woman
and certainly inquisitive-turning back and forth the page on
which another hand than hers had traced signs that convey the
sound of the writer's voice and the movement of his lips with a
subtlety known only to the author.
Who can say if the inventor of paper was not tempted to
preserve his secret, to keep this mute and indulgent confidant to
himself, this unfailing memory, this evidence now made lasting
by paper ? But the key to dreams was surrendered. We shall
never know at what cost, nor what part was played by vanity,
fear, ambition and curiosity in that very ordinary yet crucial
colloquy by which the secret was extorted-a colloquy that
never took place.
Thus author and reader were born. The presence of another
person was no longer needed for the communication of ideas.
Man could speak to man, yet be alone, provided he had this link
with his fellows. This is one of the world's great miracles.
Its effects were prodigious. Paper and the written word
broke over the world like a tidal wave. And, with them, men's
brains were set awhirl by the products of genius and stupidity,
vileness and sublimity. Their minds became distraught by
anxiety, swayed to and fro by contradictions, now bound by
earthly chains, now exalted to the skies-all at the whim of
paper.
For writing means choosing.
Or rather, it once meant choosing, both for author and reader.
The choice was between truth and falsehood, beauty and
ugliness, good and evil, with no other guide than a man's own
judgment, and this became more and more incapable as writing
grew more complex and more specialized, creating a language
of its own, understood only by the initiated."One used to be able
to read", Lucien Febvre says,"and to read nearly everything
worthwhile in one's own field. Nowadays it is impossible to
read even the essentials. And, what is more, one doesn't want
to. One is surfeited before one begins."
Does this mean that paper is leading us from daylight into
darkness ?
"The idol of Progress", writes Valéry,"has its counterpart
in the idol of anti-Progress, and that gives us two clichés."And
it is true that the pendulum always swings back.
Ortega y Gasset's"Torrent of Books", the avalanche of
imbecile publications and the sacrifice of quality to quantity, have
made paper so scarce, that unless we deliberately choose non-
sense, circumstances will force us to pay heed once more to the
voice of reason and good taste. We shall be driven to sacrifice
some of our frivolity in order to safeguard education and science,
on which our future depends, and to bring the blessings of
reading and writing to the millions who know nothing of either.
Surely it is remarkable that the sale of"serious"books
is going up, while the sale of light reading falls off. This is an
unforeseen result of the rise in the price of books. People do
not want to pay as much for a book bought to pass the time as
for one of lasting worth. Authors themselves, knowing that
their public matters more and more and that their publishers
are quite aware of it, try to polish up a manuscript that may
sell, rather than dash off three books that will find no readers.
The number of specialists who indulge in esoteric language
and in jargon is increasing. But, in terms of human beings,
the man who tries to understand is more important than one
who has understood. What matters is the attitude, the thirst
for knowledge, the direction a man gives to his enquiries and
his need for an answer.
Paper, as a factor in this dialogue, is only the pretext. An
aid to expression, we wrongly identify it with expression itself
and bless it or curse it as such. Actually it remains the passive
tool in its master's hands, who alone can be held answerable for
the use made of it.
Whether it is ideas or confetti, the product of an author or
of a lawyer's scribe, platitude or conceit, a poem or wrapping-
paper, an engraving or a photograph, posters or transfers, cigar-
ettes or lithographs, postage-stamps or wallpaper-paper
unwinds itself about our lives like a streamer, from the registra-
tion of our birth to the signing of our death certificate.
Thoughts cannot be expressed without a material basis, but
it is not to be supposed that evolution stops or that paper is the
ultimate form of invention. Others, at present only foreshadow-
ed, will follow.
In future ages, it may be that man will express himself by
groups of coloured sound-waves, which, replacing the discon-
nected utterances of our day, will merge in a complete unity of
thought and tone. Transcending the limits of worn-out words,
we should thus attain to a more perfect form, which, opening up
new horizons to the mind, would impart to it a renewed, vitality.

FROM FOREST TO PRINTER
As soon as man invented ways of expressing his thoughtsthrough drawings and characters, he began to look
around him for"something to write on."Among the first
substances which came to his hand were bones, stones and wood,
after which he turned to slabs of clay or metal. He tried fabrics,
then palm or papyrus leaves and nnally animal skins, from which
he obtained parchment-a material which some lawyers in
Europe and America continued to use until the 19th century.
But, all these writing surfaces had one drawback or another.
Those that were neither bulky nor liable to deterioration were
found to be very expensive. A bible printed by Gutenberg on
parchment, for example, required the use of 300 sheeps skins.
The Chinese, prolific writers and remarkable calligraphers, pro-
gressed rapidly, however, from the use of bones and tree barks
to that of bamboo and silk, and in the first century A. D. they
used slim rods, rather like Venetian blinds, to make books.
It was the rapid development of calligraphy by Chinese
scholars and their adoption of the camel's hair brush and fluid
pigment that produced the need for a writing substance that was
cheaper and more practical than woven textile.
This urgent need for a new writing surface inspired the
Chinese eunuch Tsai Lun to proclaim, in A. D. 105, his marvel-
lous invention of true paper-a thin felted material formed on
fist, porous moulds from macerated vegetable fibre.
The Chinese were quick to realize the importance of this
discovery, and Tsai Lun was venerated almost as a deity by suc-
ceeding generations of his countrymen. The manufacture and
use of paper spread with amazing rapidity and the records of
the following centuries contain many references to its employ-
ment, not only for writing and bibliographical purposes, but for

PAPERMAKING TOOK OVER 1000 YEARS
TO SPREAD FROM CHINA TO EUROPE
(Continued from page 1)
ornamental use in Chinese houses
and temples in the farthermost
corners of the Empire.
The art of papermaking took a
long time to cross frontiers, how-
ever, and it was only at the start of
the 7th century that the secret of
the production methods as used in
Korea, then a part of China, was
learned in nearby Japan. The
Japanese used it about the year
770 for preparing printed charms
at the order of the Empress Sho-
toku and thus produced the
world's first printing on paper.
Towards the West the spread of
knowledge about paper took even
longer, for the Celestial Empire
kept the manufacturing process a
closely guarded secret.
In 751, however, a battle was
fought by the Chinese in Turkes-
tan on the banks of the Charaz
river. Among the Chinese taken
prisoner there were a number of
skilled papermakers and their cap-
tors set them to work. By the
year 900, paper was being manu-
factured in Egypt and two centu-
ries later in Fez, Morocco, from
where the craft travelled to Spain.
The first papermaking mill was
set up at Jativa in the province of
Valencia, and in 1150 the geo-
grapher EI-Edrisi said of the city :
"Paper is there manufactured,
such as cannot be found anywhere
else in the civilized world, and is
sent to the East and to the West."
The papermakers were mostly
Jews who carried on their work
under the protection of the Caliph.
They continued to enjoy this pro-
tection under the new authorities
after the province of Valencia was
reconquered by Jaime I in 1238
A. D.
Thus it had taken over 1, 000
years for papermaking to spread
from China to Europe where the
early paper was regarded with
disfavour, being higher in price
and more fragile than parchment,
which had hitherto been used for
making books. Paper was dis-
trusted also on account of its
introduction by"'infidels."In
1268, however, a paper factory
was set up at Fabriano, near
Ancona, Italy, and soon became
very prosperous."From Fa-
briano,"proclaimed the city's
coat of arms,"paper is sent all
over the world."This was the
were not set up until about 1348.
Shortly afterwards in Nuremburg,
Senator Ulman Stromer built a
mill with the assistance of skilled
Italian workers who, in 1391, tried
to organize the first strike in the
history of papermaking. The in-
dustry as a whole developed slowly
and it was often the sudden in-
crease of local needs that brought
about the construction of plants.
A typical example was the one set
up by the General Assembly of
Basle.

rather, the introduction of print-
FIVE STEPS IN MAKING PAPER
No matter what kind of paper is made there are five steps that
must be followed in order to produce a sheet of uniform strength and
quality from the cellulose fibre of a tree or other planet, These five
steps are :
1) separate the cellulose fibre from the raw material.
2) reduce the fibre to a watery pulp.
3)"beat"the pulp until the fibres are of the required thinness
and are thoroughly mixed with certain materials or chemicals.
4) form a"web"of paper on a fine sieve which lets the water run
through but holds the solid parts in a thin, even layer on top.
5) dry, smooth and finish the paper web in various ways.
results of the improvements
brought to the manufacturing
processes by Italian craftsmen.
By the : end of the 13th century,
twelve sheets of paper cost the
same price as one sheet of parch-
ment, thanks to these craftsmen.
Other mills were set up at Bolo-gna, Cividale, Padua, Treviso and
Genoa, and the renown of Italian
paper spread as far as Asia.
The French and the Germans
continued for a long time to buy
this paper. In France it seems
that the first centres for paper-
making, at Troyes and Bar-Ie-Duc,
ing in the West towards the
middle of the 15th century, gave
a powerful boost to the paper in-
dustry, and in the battles of
humanism, of the Reformation and
the counter-Reformation these
arms were widely used.
In England, however, paper con-
tinued to be despised. It was only
towards the end of the 16th cen-
tury that a German, John Spel-
man, one of the goldsmiths to
Queen Elizabeth, managed to open
a business which quickly prosper-
ed.
Prior to this, the Dutch had
built a mill at Dordrecht. They
took advantage of the distress
caused in Germany by the Thirty
Years'War and of the mistakes
made by France after the revoca-
tion of the Edict of Nantes. By
the 17th century, Dutch paper was
considered to be the finest in the
world, and it was at Amsterdam
that the papermaker, Wilhelm
Rittinghausen, studied the craft
before emigrating to America,
where he set up a paper mill at
Germantown, Philadelphia, in
1690. His mill, however, was not
the first in the New World, where
since 1580,"a mill with a hammer
in which paper is made"had been
functioning at Culhuacan, in
Mexico. And, in any case, the
Mayas had already discovered
how to make paper centuries
before.
By the end of the 17th century
paper was being manufactured in
all the countries of the West, and,
with a few modifications, it was
being made by the same methods
and under the same physical diffi-
culties as those experienced by the
workers who produced the first
true paper for Tsai Lun in China,
fifteen centuries earlier.
Even in our mechanized age,
the processes used in the making
of paper are basically the same.
The raw material-bamboo, rags,
straw, bark or coniferous wood-
still has to be softened and
ground. Pressing and drying
remain essential. As in the Far
East, the vatman continues to be
the most important worker in the
small-scale production of high-
class paper ; he it is who with-
draws the mould which has been
plunged into the pulp, and then
shakes it so that the fibres fall in
perfect formation. He is assisted
being round, and their delivery to a newspaper building, where they will be transformed into"tomorrow's newspapers".

by the coucher who skilfully re-
moves the sheet onto the felt, until
he has a pile of sheets and felts
ready for the press. He too is a
craftsman-and for him there
has been no outstanding innova-
tion for a couple of thousand
years. In fact, until the invention
of machinery, improvements were
extremely rare. _
A long time has passed since the
Arabs did away with pestle and
mortar in the manufacture of pa-
per ; these past masters in the art
of irrigation were quick to turn
to water-power for crushing the
raw material. The paper mill
which they invented, with its bat-
tery of beavers, remained in use
for centuries with but few modifi-
cations. Not until the 17th cen-
tury was it replaced by the Hol-
lander, a water-wheel which
revolved a wooden cylinder fitted
with 36 iron knives. Little by
little the Hollander was improved.
In 1750 John Baskerville invented
a wire frame for it which"wove"
a paper that was perfectly smooth
- vellum.
while research continued on
new developments, discoveries no
less startling were being made in
the sphere of raw materials.
Réaumur observed that wasps
made their nests from wood fila-
ments that resembled paper-but
the"experts"were sceptical when
he suggested that man, too, could
make paper from wood. Chris-
tian Jacob Schaeffer, a Regens-
burg clergyman, fought hard to
prove he was right : but his idea
was not definitely accepted until
Friedrich Gottlob Keller, a weaver
from Saxony, discovered wood
pulp in 1844. It is to him that
the modern paper industry owes
fifty per cent of its prosperity.
For the other fifty per cent, the
inventors of machinery must be
thanked. The main operation in
papermaking-draining out the
moisture-was done by hand
until about 1820, when mechaniza-
tion took over. In 1798 Nicolas
Louis Robert invented a paper-
making machine (later perfected
by engineers such as Bryan
Donkin and the Fourdrinier Bro-
thers), which revolutionized the
industry, for, by enabling paper
of unlimited length to be produc-
ed, it made possible the modern
rotary press.
The Paper Age goes back hun-
dreds of years in the Far East,
and it would be hard to say which
people and era made the greatest
use of paper. In the sixth century
the Emperor Kao Tsung instituted
paper money, and it was even plac-
ed in tombs instead of pieces of
silver. Marco Polo was amazed
at the amount and variety of
paper which the Chinese set on fire
at their ceremonies. Before his
time, Turkish explorers had
remarked on its everyday use in
Chinese homes : linings for cloth-
ing, sandals, slippers, toys, petards
and fireworks made of paper were
accepted as a matter of course.
In Japan, as is well known,
there were multifarious uses of
paper : window-panes (scientin-
cally a sound idea, as paper lets in
the ultra-violet rays), lanterns,
screens, umbrellas, overcoats,
bags, covers. Plain or finished,
oiled or glued, pulped or made into
cardboard, articles made of paper
formed an indispensable part of
everyday life.
Little by little, the idea spread
to Europe and America. Even
before the discovery of wood pulp,
vehicle builders had made coaches
of paper. But the lack of raw
material hampered the industry :
so much so that in the 1850s, a
number of American paper firms
tried to combat the shortage by
importing mummies from Egypt
and using their bandages.
Perhaps it is fortunate that at
about the same time wood pulp
made its first appearance, and in
1854, collars, cuffs and shirt fronts
made of paper were on sale in
New York. Ten years later,
aprons, hats, carpets, casks and
floorings were being made of it.
It was used to make coffins (but
the Persians had thought of that
idea long before then), houses,
and at least a couple of churches :
one in Oslo, the other in London.
In 1883 a Dresden clockmaker
produced a clock made entirely of
paper. In 1891 the Bell Company
used paper as an insulator for
telephone cables. In 1897 a horse-
shoe made of paper was intro-
duced in Chicago : it was then the
latest of a thousand applications
of this proteinic substance. Now,
there are 14, 000 uses made of it.
There is little doubt that plas-
tics will eliminate many of these
uses. But today printing works
are more then ever before crying
out for millions of tons of it-
and the papermakers are unable
to satisfy them.

PAPER : Pbnt or vegetable
fibre called cellulose,
is at base of almost
every kind of paper.
The cellulose fibre of
any plant will produce
paper, but in practice
only a few kinds are
used commercially. To-
day two-thirds of all
paper is made from
woodpulp. Some is
made from hemp, jute,
straw, cornstalks, su-
gar cane waste or rags.
About a quarter of all
new paper comes from
waste paper.
PULPWOOD : the trees, or
soft wood from these
trees, used in paper-
making. Spruce, pop-
lar, hemlock, white
pine, basewood are the
most usual pulpwoods.
WOODPULP : the ground-up
pulp made from pulp-
wood trees either me-
chanically (by crush-
ing) or by chemical
process. Four kinds of
woodpulp are produced
and used in various
combinations :
1. Groundwood pulp :
contains all the im-
purities. Newsprint is
about 75% groundwood.
2. Sulphite pulp : wood
chips treated with che-
mical fumes to purify
the cellulose. Impor-
tant basis of most book
papers. 3. Soda pulp :
wood chips boiled with
caustic soda produces
soft bulky pulp. Gives
mellowness to many
kinds of book paper.
4. Sulphate pulp : So-
dium sulphate and
other chemicals pro-
duce strong, dark fibres
used for wrapping pa-
pert.
NEWSPRINT : machine-
finished paper, usually
in rolls, made chiefly
from groundwood pulp
and used mostly for
newspapers. Esparto
grass (a Spanish and
Algerian grass) is also
used, chiefly in Eng-
land. Nearly 45 % of
world's paper produc-
tion is newsprint.
BOOK PAPER : made largely
from sulphite and so-
da woodpulp. Used for
books, magazines and
other printing papers.
When dipped in a gela-
tine-like solution paper
dries smoother and less
absorbant to ink. Me-
tal and fibre rollers give
extra high smooth fin-
ish. Book paper con-
J'titutes 20 % of world's
paper output.
PRINTING PAPER : general
term including news-
print and book paper.
WRITING PAPER : includes
bond and ledger papers.
Linen and cotton rags
are reserved today for
highest grade paper.
WRAPPING PAPER : Made
of various fibre-
wood, straw, jute, old
rope and twine, manila
hemp (hence name
"manila paper") and
old paper. Kraft, used
for wrapping and grain
and flour sacks, is a
very tough dark-brown
paper made of digested
wood chips.
"BIBLE"PAPER : usually
made of linen rags.
RICE PAPER : What is usual-
ly called rice paper is
not paper, has nothing
to do with rice. It
is a natural tissue de-
rived from pith of a
tree. But paper made
from rice straw is also
called rice paper.

WHY THERE IS A
NEWSPRINT CRISIS
INSUFFICIENT
BEFORE the war, the annual outputof newsprint-7, 000, 000 metric
tons-was just about equal to
the demand. The United States con-
sumed nearly half the world's supply,
while Britain used one sixth-more
than the whole of the rest of Europe
combined (excluding the USSR).
Canada was the main producer of
newsprint with the United Kingdom,
the United States and the Scandina-
vian countries well behind her.
The post-war situation. however.
was very different. Production had
fallen far behind the world's needs.
Although the United States was now
using more newsprint than ever
before, circumstances resulting from
hostilities had resulted in a sharp
drop in European countries.
What is the present situation ?
The most recent statistics-thosf
of 1950-show that world produc-
tion has increased by more than
2, 000, 000 metric tons over the 1938
total. Once again Canada has been
in the lead : production there has
risen from 2, 624, 000 to 4, 788. 000 tons.
In comparison, the United States'
increase has been small-180, 000
tons. United Kingdom production
has dropped by 300. 000 tons, and
that of Germany by 160, 000.
But, at the same time, consumption
in the United States has gone up by
2, 300, 000 tons-in other words, the
United States has more than absorbed
the rise in world production. Mean-
while, while the countries of the
European continent more or less
maintained their 1938 level of con-
sumption, Britain has had to drop to
about half her pre-war figure-from
1. 261, 000 tons to 653, 000.
In summing up the present situa-
tion, therefore, (leaving out the ques-
tion of needs) the United States
having absorbed the world's great
increase in production and the Conti-
nent of Europe's consumption having
remained stable at its pre-war level,
the dominant factor is the reduction
in the United Kingdom's consumption
of newsprint.
by Jacques Kayser
of the French delegation to ECOSOC
This state of affairs is, however,
only partly a matter of supply diffi-
culties. The main problem is one of
foreign exchange faced by countries
outside the dollar area. Thus, it can
be seen that the two essential ele-
ments in the present newsprint crisis
are an inadequacy of production,
accompanied by a rise in prices.
It may seem at first glance that
talking about inadequacy of produc-
tion is not entirely accurate, since
world production has gone up by a
third in the period between 1938 and
1950. But the demand for newsprint
has also soured : and only in the
United States. and perhaps in Canada
and other producing countries, has it
been satisfies.
It must. however, be borne in mind
that the demand for newsprint has
increased all over the world, and not
only in the United States. If such
factors as wartime restrictions, econo-
mic recovery and austerity pro-
grammes explain some of the limita-
tions on the use of newsprint, they do
not indicate a healthy or lasting state
of affairs, and certainly not one that
should be encouraged. The problem
is far more than merely technical or
economic. New and constantly
expanding markets for newsprint are
being created by the growing use of
mass communication and means of
information ; by the awakening of
interest in national and international
problems among millions of human
beings ; by the vital importance for
every one of us of the problems that
face governments and influence
public opinion ; by the first results of
emancipations recently achieved by
certain peoples and of sovereignty
newly acquired by a number of
States ; by the great can : paigns which
are being waged against illiteracy.
Yes, there is certainly room for
more newspapers (and bigger ones,
for in most European countries they
have greatly diminished in size) if
only the paper were available-and
if it could be obtained at prices which
potential users could pay..
HIGH
PRICES
But there are two difficulties, which
do not apply only to newsprint, but
are particularly applicable to it. One
is that most of the available news-
print is in the dollar area, and must
be paid for in dollars. Thus, on a
free international market, consumers
outside the dollar area have an
obvious disadvantage. The other dif-
ficulty is that prices have soared. A
recent study by Unesco revealed that
the price of a home-produced ton of
newsprint in the United Kingdom rose
from'$84. 40 in January 1950 to
$163. 80 in March 1951. In Belgium,
between the same dates, the increase
has been from $112 to $205.
The figures for imported newsprint
were equally alarming. In Belgium,
the cost of a ton of imported news-
print has gone up from $124 in
January 1951 to $280 in March 1951,
while in Egypt the rise was from
$140 to $336. And since this survey
the figures have risen still higher.
In other words, the many-sided
problem of newsprint éalls urgently
for remedial measures on an interna-
tional level. But, even if the prelimin-
ary recommendations of Unesco and
of the Economic and Social Council
of the United Nations are accepted
and carried out ; even if the produ-
cers succeed in increasing their out-
put rapidly ; even if the main consum-
ers give a good example of unsel-
fishness and international solidarity
by agreeing to cut their consumption
slightly-there will still be a need
for energetic action in the matter of
prices if the situation is to be made
normal and the urgent needs satisfied.
Failing such action, the newsprint
crisis will continue to worsen in those
countries which feel the need most
acutely to provide their people with
free, plentiful, varied and easily
accessible information.
It is hard to say who or what would
benefit from such a situation, but it
is quite easy to name the victim why
has already begun to suffer from the :
present state of affairs. The victim
is democracy.
Photo shows that a newspaper weighing almost 2 Ibs requires over 5 tbs of wood, coal and chemical substances
in its production : 3 tubs of spruce wood, 1 ounce of sulphur, 1 ounce of bleaching powder, 1. 5 ounces of unslacked
lime, and red and blue dye. These are converted into enough stock for one newspaper by about 2 Ibs of coal.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 12 JANUARY 1952
France's newspaper publishers
talk about their difficulties
"VERY citizen may speak, write andpublish freely"
France wrote this revolutionary
idea into her Declaracion of the Rights of Man
in 1789. But, in the France of 1952, the right
to read what is published threatens to become
a luxury reserved to those citizens who can
afford to pay for it.
This is the opinion of French newspaper
, editors and publishers interviewed by this
reporter on the effect of the world newsprint
shortage on a free press.
The shortage has resulted in a rise in the
price, and a drastic cut in the size, of
newspapers. It has led to a reduction in
French daily newspaper circulation from
18, 000, 000 before World War II to 12. 000, 000
today, according to Robert Salmon, presi-
dent of the Société Professionnelle du Papier
de Presse (a newspapers publishers'organi-
zation responsible for distributing newsprint
to French newspapers).
"And, if we have to keep raising our prices,"
declared M. Salmon, who is also Chairman
of the Board of Directors of France-Soir, the
newspaper with largest circulation in France
today,"the French press will be lucky to sell
200, 000 copies daily."
Today, a Frenchman pays 30 times more
for his newspaper than he did before the war,
but his income has only gone up 20 times.
The villain in the piece, men like M. Salmon
will tell you, is newsprint, which now costs 45
times as much as in 1939.
French newspapers, he said, have estimated
their needs for 1952 at 350, 000 tons-but only
320, 000 tons are in sight."On the face of it,
this does not look like a shortage of much more
than 10 per cent,"he said,"but the situation is
much more serious than that."
French publishers, in 1952, can count on
only 250, 000 tons ; of ordinary newsprint stock,
known to the trade as AFNOR I-I. Although
the cheapest paper available, it nevertheless
costs 83, 000 francs (about $240 or L85) a
metric ton, as compared to the equivalent of
45, 000 francs a ton in the United States and
65, 000 francs in Great Britain.
In addition, said M. Salmon, French pub-
lishers can expect to get 40, 000 tons of higher
quality paper (one of the grades now offered
newspaper publishers is so expensive that it
was abandoned several years ago by a leading
French picture magazine). This will cost an
average of 105, 000 francs a ton.
Finally, as a partial remedy for the deficit
remaining, France hopes to be able to import
30, 000 additional tons from abroad at 110, 000
francs a ton (at this price, a kilogram of
newsprint is worth almost ten kilograms of
potatoes).
Under this programme, said M. Salmon,
French publishers believe they can maintain
their present stocks of 10, 000 tons-enough
for about ten days of publication. In normal
times, they had a 30 days'reserve of newsprint
on hand.
If these conditions prevail, he predicted that
the French publisher will soon pay about
95, 000 francs a ton for his newsprint. Thi. s
promises to have severe repercussions on the
budgets of newspapers which. he said, suffered
by Daniel BE. HRMAN
circulation losses as high as eight per cent
several months ago when they raised news-
stand prices from 12 to 15 francs on the basis
of paper at about 85, 000 franco per ton.
Henri Massot, editor of Paris-Presse, the
city's second largest afternoon newspaper, and
president of the Syndicate of the Parisian
Press, also commented on the effects the
newsprint shortage is having on the Paris
press.
Before the war, he explained, many Paris
newspapers used to publish 12 and 14 pages
daily, and two-thirds of their readers were in
the French provinces. There was enough
space available to give national and interna-
tional news and, at the same time, to reserve
a page for news of local interest in each
region. This is now impossible. With eight-
and ten-page papers there is no room for
regional news, and international news is often
reduced. Today, only 25 per cent of the
readers of Parisian dailies are in the pro-
vinces. Last August, to build up newsprint
stocks, the largest papers in France voluntarily
put out several six-page editions.
These changes have not been without effect
on the journalistic profession. Paris-Presse,
M. Massot said, was forced to make a ten per
cent cut in its staff recently and, in general,
the journalistic profession has one of the
highest unemployment rates of any in France
- where overall unemployment is extremely
low.
Maurice Bernard, assistant secretary-gene-
ral of the Federation du Livre, the French
printers'trade union, said that his organi-
zation has been forced to regulate admissions
to printers'trade schools.
Until now, the union has been able to find
new jobs for men thrown out of work when a
newspaper ceased publication. But M. Ber-
nard, speaking for his group, expressed alarm
at the disastrous consequences of present
newsprint prices.
"Newsprint prices are now so high that
many newspapers can no longer operate
without losing money,"he said,"and it's not
easy to convince a publisher to pay the current
wages if he is losing money himself."
What is the result of this situation on the
newspaper itself, whose duty in an democracy
is to keep the public well-informed ?
"In the first place our articles are too short
and we can't present all sides of a question,"
said Claude Bellanger, editor of the Parisien
Libéré and secretary-general of the Interna-
tional Federation of Newspaper Proprietors
and Editors.
"French papers are sometimes criticized
abroad because they do not always give com-
plete coverage on a story. I use four press
agencies.-Associated Press, United Press.
Reuter, and the Agence Franee-Presse-in
addition to my own correspondents, but I just
don't have room to run all details on a single
event.
"We have correspondents, for example, in
New York and Buenos Aires, but I haven't been
able to run any of their despatches for the last
two weeks. Our man in London has instruc-
tions to give us as little as possible. We have
a readership which demands a certain amount
of local news. good sports coverage and a novel
in serial form. If I cut these out, I'd lose read-
ers. As a journalist, I would like to devote
more space to foreign affairs and to problems
of world interest, but as a publisher, I cannot
- not with an eight-page paper."
M. Bellanger pulled a closely-written sheet
of paper from his desk. It was a table showing
how much advertising lineage a paper is requir-
ed to publish before the Société Professionnelle
du Papier de Presse (S. P. P. P.) will allocate sup-
plementary newsprint to allow a paper to in-
crease in size from six to eight pages or to ten
pages.
"Unfortunately, not every publisher can
count on getting this additional allocation,
which means that he must pay more than the
S. P. P. P. price for his additional newsprint,"he
said."That's one reason why the price of
newsprint is 40 per cent of a newspaper's costs
in France today, as compared to 25 per cent
before the war."
And this is how the newsprint problem is
seen by Jean Baylet, Editor of La Dépêche du
Midi, published at Toulouse, in Southwest
France, and one of France's leading provincial
newspapers."You must realize that you can't
have a free press unless it pays it way,"said
M. Baylet, who is also a Deputy in the French
National Assembly, and a member of the
Assembly's press committee.
"As things stand today, daily newspapers in
France are assured of a vital minimum of
newsprint for six pages by the Société Pro-
fes. sionnelle. Now, if you want to run more,
you have to buy it at a higher cost,"he said.
He pointed to a bill for newsprint at 105, 000
francs a ton, explaining that it was"superior
quality"-that is, he had been charged on the
basis off'''superior quality."
M. Baylet also explained that he and his edi-
tors have to find room for the general cover-
age given by Paris newspapers and at the
same time supply the local news their readers
demand. As a result the Dépêche du Midi puts
out as many as fifty editions a day, in some
cases using an edition for one district of a
French county.
"We would like to have enough pages to
cover local news of an entire county in one
edition, but we now have to split it up because
we don't have the paper,"he explained. His
newspaper has also been forced to reduce cer-
tain feature columns, such as those on literary
and cultural subjects, children's stories,, fash-
ions and agricultural problems.
"If the cost of newsprint keeps going up."he
said,"small papers will disappear in France
and the French press will be reduced to four
or five newspapers in Paris and four or five
more in the provinces."
As an important French publisher recently
put it :"We in the newspaper profession in
France are continually being told that well-
informed citizens are the best guarantee of a
free world. But how do you expect us to in-
form them it they cannot afford to buy a
newspaper ?"
'I CANNOT
AFFORD TO
BUY BOOKS
ANY MORE'
THE impact of price increaseson the cost of paper already
felt by the reading public in
practically all countries is likely
te become much more severe
according-to two leading book
publishers : Allen Lane, managing
director of Penguin Books, Great
Britain, and René Vaubourdolle,
director of the textbook depart-
ment (AWM clrlssiq/ll's) of tile
Librairie, Hachette, France.
Both publishers, in an interview-
with the ["II ('SCO Couricr, \\'arned
that more extensive book price
increases will occur when present
stocks have heen sold and new
hooks are printed on paper bought
since the cost began to mount
sone eighteen months ago.
Mr. Lane, who prints 10, Ooh, No
Penguin Books a year, reported
that his paper costs have risen
from f : 40 a ton at the beginning
of J () : JO to f : ! 10 a ton in June 1951.
These costs, nonnahy amounting
tn only about 2.') per cent of the
price of a book, now represent
: ; 0 per cent. Formerly sold ail
prices varying from Is 6d to Fis.
Penguin books are now to be
raised to a minimum of 2s.
The rise in publishing costs
also has serious repercussions
on authors, Ir. Lane explained.
"publishers must look for book.,
that are certain to selt,"he said,
"and that means diftìcult times
for new creative writers."
This picture of paper prices
gradually driving book out of
reach of readers is also reflected
in France. In Paris. M. Yauhour-
dolle of Hachette explained that.
while paper prices had increased.
the public's buying power had
decreased.
Todav in M'ance, text hooks are
available-hut often at prices
which I. Yaubourdnlte termed
"prohibitive."He chose some
examples from the Hachette
catalogue. One French grammar
had gone up from 180 to 260
francs. Another had risen from
300 to 440 franc". A history book
was up from 65 to 120 francs.
On his desk he had a weighty
Latin-French dictionary. It was
marked 2, 500 francs."There are
three kilograms of paper alone in
this hook,"he said,"If I had to
reprint it today, I could not sell it
for less than 3, 500 francs."
The increase in the cost of text-
books has. been a hard blow
to French municipalities which
furnish free books to children in
primary schools. Municipalities
establish their school budgets at
the beginning of a year, explained
M. VaubourdoHe. In January 1951,
the price of ordinary newsprint-
tlle paper used for elementary
school texts-was 50. 400 francs
a ton. BvJu) v of 195), it had
gone up to nearly 80, 000, but the
budgets were the same.
"the result is that. in some
schools, hooks have been bought
on the ha ; : ; i ; : ; of one for two
children. and teachers ; most dic-
tate texts to the resit of the class,"
he said.
Adually, the rise has been even
more severe. With newspapers
clamouring for newsprint, HacheUe
Itas not heen ahle to find enough
for it, ; elemental'Y sellOol book, ;,
and has been forced to use higher
quality paper, at prices going ns
ing-has 110, 000 francs a ton.
The final result is the sam as
elsewhere. From March 1950 to
March 1951, paper costs were 28
per cent of Haciiette's expenses.
"Today,"said M. Vaubourdoiie,
"they probably represent <12 per
cent, for exactly the same books,"
"['\'e made an estimate of the
prices paid by a fattier who buys
new book, for a 14-yeaI'-0Id child
in the third class'in secondarv
school,"he commented."In 19 ; Ù
it woutdiiave been 8, 000 francs as
compared to 6, 000' francs the year
before.".
The effect of new hook prices
on the buying habits of the French
reading pubtic was shown during
a recent conversation which
: \1. Vauboul'dotle had with a friend
\\'who i, one of the chief school
inspector in France. asked if he
had bought a certain new book the
education of1ìcial rl'plied."Oh
no :. I'm not rich ennuglt to buy

POSSIBLE
ANSWERS
TO WORLD
NEWSPRINT
FAMINE
by Bernard MINNS
THE world paper shortage
first began to occupy the
attention of Unesco soon
after the organization was
set up six years ago. For it was
plain even then that the post-war
political and social changes would
create a wider demand for reading
matter in large areas of the world.
When, in 1947, Unesco asked a
commission of experts to investi-
gate the shortage, they reported :
"There is not enough newsprint
available to enable the Press
adequately to do their essential job
of informing the people of the
news and opinions that are vitally
important at this critical juncture
of the world's history."
This report underlined the cur-
rent needs of a paper-hungry
world. National independence re-
cently won by a number of coun-
tries in Asia has increased this
need, for it has already provided
new opportunities for millions of
illiterate people. With the re-
surgence of nationalism and the
steady growth of industry, the
mental horizon of the under-pri-
vileged in most parts of the globe
is today widening, thus increasing
the demand for enlightenment.
This thirst for knowledge will
certainly grow as national literacy
campaigns now being organized by
many governments get under way.
It is already invading Africa, the
Middle East, and Latin America,
as well as pushing forward in Asia.
And it will inevitably go on for
decades, since the task involves
bringing knowledge to one half of
humanity that today still remains
unlettered.
Unhappily, these additional de-
mands from under-developed
countries for more newsprint and
other printing paper coincide with
urgent needs for extra paper in
all the more developed ones. These
overwhelming claims have created
a production crisis, for present
output cannot meet the world's
current requirements, let alone the
long-term literacy needs of the
under-developed countries.
Indeed, it has been estimated
that if the number of people able
to read goes up by only five per
cent, it will be impossible to
provide them with the books,
newspapers and other publications
they will need.
The basic problem or paper was
well summed up by M. Torres
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco,
to a Montreal conference convened
by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization in 1949.
He asked the Preparatory Confer-
ence on World Pulp Problems to
remember that"even if present
manufacturing capacity were fully
utilized, and the most up-to-date
methods applied, it could not fill
immediate needs, still less the
needs of the world tomorrow.
"It is essential,"he stressed,
"notwithstanding the difficulties,
to equip new factories and to
encourage research into the pos-
sibility of utilizing other raw
materials ; to reserve the most
suitable species-fir, balsam, poplar
and spruce-for the manufacture
of newsprint and printing paper,
using other timbers wherever pos-
sible, for purposes of building,
heating, manufacture of pit-props
and Kraft."
Study and research into forestry
resources, conservation and deve-
lopment is now being conducted by
the Food and Agriculture Organi-
zation, so that it can indicate to
the Social and Economic Council
the technical measures necessary to
increase production, including the
use of substitute raw materials.
Current and future demands for
paper call for short-term and
long-term programmes, if the
world's cultural needs are to be
met. As a beginning, the Eco-
nomic and Social Council-the
United Nations'co-ordinating body
- has appealed to major consumer
countries to limit consumption, so
that more newsprint can be made
available to the paper-hungry areas
of the world. America today con-
sumes over 60 per cent of world
output, arid if a small fraction of
this were diverted to needy coun-
tries, it could ease the paper crisis
in most non-dollar lands.
Owing to a shortage of dollars,
certain paper-producing countries
cannot import sufficient raw ma-
terials to keep their mills on full
production. According to the
Newsprint Association of Canada,
they could, if they had the cur-
rency, increase production by
60, 000 metrics tons, or nearly twice
the present output of Great Britain.
It has also been suggested that
all Canada's mills should work a
seven-day week. Canada is al-
ready responsible for 46 per cent of
the world's newsprint output ; with
Sunday work it could increase pro-
duction by one-fifth.
In a number of countries, var-
ious substitutes like eucalyptus
wood, esparto grass, bamboo and
papyrus are being used for manu-
facturing different kinds of print-
ing papers, Kraft and cellulose. In
Italy, there are plans for building
a factory producing 15, 000 tons of
paper a year from chestnut and
poplar wood, straw, ht ! mp fibre,
rushes and reeds. By using these
for making other printing papers,
similar quantities of wood-pulp are
released for newsprint.
These are some of the short-
term measures that can be taken
to alleviate the growing crisis.
But even if they were all carried
out, it would still not solve the
basic problem-insufficient raw
materials to supply the world's
steadily increasing needs.
As far as long-term measures are
concerned, the chief need is to push
on with intensive research to find
substitute raw materials that
could be mixed with small quan-
tities of the usual ones for making
newsprint and printing paper.
Such experiments are under way
in many parts of the world.
In the United States at Sav-
annah, Georgia, and at Lufkin
Texas, two factories are working
for American, African, Indian,
Finnish, Mexican and New Zealand
manufacturers. Raw materials
being studied include palmetto,
sugar cane, fibre, straw, bamboo,
African bango and cotton stalks.
Great Britain has carried out
research on the use of elephant
grass which is common in East
Africa.
Promising developments are
going on in Australia. Wholly
dependent on imported newsprint
until a few years ago, this country
is today turning out 30, 000 tons of
newsprint made from hardwood,
and is expected to treble her output
by next year. In India and
China, rice straws are used for
making rice paper upon which it
is possible to print newspapers.
But of all the substitute raw
materials being examined, it seems
that bagasse is the most promis-
ing. It is the fibrous residue of
the sugar cane after the sugar has
been extracted, and is inexpensive.
From the Brazilian sugar industry
alone, bagasse could produce
1, 500, 000 tons of paper.
In the Philippines, one factory
daily produces ten tons of extra fine
paper made out of bagasse which
compares favourably with the
imported paper. A similar mill is
being constructed in India.
Unesco has reported that in
America, a complete edition of the
Daily Transcript of Holyoke (Mas-
sachusetts), has been printed on
bagasse paper. The American
paper industry is showing consider-
able interest in this material, and
leading U. S. experts are now
carrying out research in Hawaii
into its possibilities.
From these experiments all over
the world, raw material substitutes
will be found sooner or later that
may finally solve the problem of
supplying sufficient newsprint and
printed paper to every corner of
the globe.
RECENT FAO ACTION
IN order to decrease and gradually overcome the present world deficit
of newsprint and printing paper, the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion, meeting last month in Rome, adopted the following recommen-
dations :
(1) that FAO, in consultation with the International Materials Con-
ference and other interested inter-governmental agencies, survey the
possibilities for increasing the production and transportation facilities for
pulpwood.
(2) that member governments
(a) take action aimed at increasing pulpwood supplies including
adjustments in forest policy such as planting quick-growing pulpable
species and developing and using suitable supplementary or substitute
raw materials.
(b) consider the advisability of establishing or encouraging new pulp
and paper manufacturing plants in areas where permanent supplies of
raw materials (including processing materials) in adequate quantities
are assured.
(3) that member governments avail themselves of facilities provided
by addressing formal requests to FAO for :
(a) exploratory missions to assist in selecting possible sites for new
pulp and paper mills, taking into account local technical and economic
conditions.
(b) advisory missions to help in drawing up detailed plans for such
mills, with due consideration to the conservaton of forest resources and
the estabiishment of the necessary transport facilities.
The Conference invited the Director-General of FAO to facilitate the
rapid conclusion of technical assistance agreements in this connection,
and to report periodically to ECOSOC on the progress achieved.

HARVESTS FROM PLANT LIFE IN THE SEA
ALL food is made by plants,
for plants alone have
mastered the process of
manufacturing certain
basic chemical substances from
which every kind of food must
come. Any type of animal,
whether it feeds directly on
plants, or only indirectly through
the flesh of other animals, must
thus depend on plant life for its
continued existence.
One of the chemical miracles
wrought by growing things is
their production of sugar from
water and the carbon dioxide gas
present in the air. It is the
action of sunlight on the green
colouring matter of plants that
brings about this so called
photo-synthesis, which is the
source of most of mankind's
energy-giving foods.
A further unique ability of
plants is the making of sub-
stances called proteins-complex
chemicals that are necessary
constituents of all living cells,
both animal and vegetable. Pro-
teins are essential to the growth
of living tissues, and while we
may get much of our protein
foods from such animal products
as meat, milk and eggs, the true
source is the growing things
upon which animals feed.
From prehistoric times man
has tapped those vast food re-
sources of ocean, lake and stream
by fishing. Is it not possible,
however, to use the plant life of
the earth's waters more directly ?
This has. indeed been done in a
limited way, for edible seaweeds
are known, and other forms of
by ire M. Freeman
sea growth have long been used
as fertilizers for land farming.
In Western Europe alone, mil-
lions of tons of seaweed are used
for this purpose each year. But
just in the last few years an
even more direct and promising-
way of garnering food and other
useful products from the vege-
table life of the sea has been
intensive ! y investigated. The
method makes use of the class
of simple organisms called algae.
These tiny plants form the fami-
liar green, slimy masses seen
on the surfaces of ponds and
lakes (some varieties are red,
others are brown).
Algae are able to use the
energy of the sun's rays to syn-
thesize proteins that serve not
alone as food, but for many
industrial uses such as manu-
facture of paints, varnishes
and plastics. Moreover, they are
able to do this much more effi-
ciently than plants grown on
land. For example, agriculture,
even under the best circum-
stances, can convert only about
three-tenths of one per cent of a
year's solar radiation into useful
organic materials ; the algae, on
the other hand, are able to do
fifteen to twenty times as well.
There is a disadvantage, how-
ever, in depending on natural
beds of algae, since a pond is able
to sustain only slightly more than
one kilogram of these plants for
each million litres of water. For
this reason, investigators in
various parts of the world have
devoted their efforts to growing
algae under controlled laboratory
conditions in an effort to in-
crease the rate of production.
The weight of protein that could
be obtained from a given area of
a) gae cultivation would be more
than sixty times the weight now
obtained from the same area if
devoted to soy beans-the most
productive agricultural c I'0 P
known.
In the United States of Ame-
rica the (Carnegie Institution is
at present supporting a number
of research projects aimed at
investigating the conditions
under which algal plants can be
grown most abundantly under
controlled conditions. The expe-
rimenters work with a particu-
lar form of one-celled algae call-
ed chlorella. Some workers
grow the plants in solutions of
chemical nutrients in tall glass
tubes. Carbon dioxide gas is
bubbled through the solution,
and the tube is exposed to sun-
light or to the light from a set of
electric lamps. As the algae
colony grows, parts are drawn
off and processed to obtain the
protein. This is then used for
feeding laboratory animals in
order to check on its usefulness
as a food. It is found that by
changing the nature of the
nutrient solution, the fraction of
the product that is in the form
of protein or of fat can be alter-
ed to a remarka. Me degree. For
food purposes a high protein
content is wanted, whereas for
the manufactured of paint or oils
a high fat content is desirable.
In order to grow a successful
and continuously productive
co ! ony of algae, it is found
essential to draw off portions of
the crop at precisely the proper
rate, so that the colony does not
strangle itself by overcrowding.
One of the foremost research
workers in this field, Dr. Pau) M.
Cook of the Stanford Research
Institute in California believes
that"it is not difficult to visua-
lize a system where constant
conditions can be maintained in
a continuous system permitting
the most efficient use of land,
sunlight and equipment. By
continuously harvesting at the
rate at which the algae increase,
and supplying the necessary raw
materials, the optimum condi-
tions may be maintained and the
maximum possible production
realized."
Chlorella is but one of a large
number of types of algae, and
further research may show that
other species are even more pro-
mising. Alga breeding tanks,
row upon row, could become a
common sight in the sunnier
areas of the world. For the pres-
ent, the important fact is that
photo-synthesis has been used
and controlled, with the promise
of new ways of using the energy
of the sun in the fight against
famine.

DE-FORESTATtON AND ITS ABUSES
THEN, in a plane heading for Teheran, the
late President Roosevelt saw betow
him vast stretches of desert rock, he
was surprised to learn that he was crossing a
country which in bygone days had been a land
flowing with milk and honey. Gone were the
stately forests ; only devastation remained.
But the President was not unfamiliar with
the devastation caused by man, for his own
Tennessee Valley Project was conceived to
repair similar ravages caused by mal-
treatment and abuse of natural resources.
These abuses are widespread, for through-
out history man has been a great destroyer.
During the past 2, 000 years, 106 unique and
irreplaceable forms of mammal life have
disappeared from the earth ; 67 per cent of
these have become extinct during the past
century.
One-third of the world's original forest land
has been turned into desert by man-and
growing technical ability has hastened this
dread process."If the foresters approved, the
most beautiful and oldest forest could be razed
in a few weeks,"says the Italian Professor

rivers, for instance, could transport the logs

matchsticks".
So far as the problem of newsprint its
concerned, this savage destruction of forests
is not of key importance. The trees ! that
supply us with woodpulp for papermaking
are earefully conserved. But so far as our
everyday lives are concerned, we are intima-
tely affected by the death of the world's trees.
It is not generally realized how far wood is
at the basis of dailv existence. More than
two-thirds of the inhabitants of this earth use
11 for cooking or warmth. In fact, most of
the wood consumed throughout the world is
used as fuel, although this process is extre-
mely wasteful. When wood is turned into
charroal in this primitive way, only one-third
acts as a fuel.
by Maurice Goldsmith
The followi ng table shows, in lIIi Ilions of
cuhic metres, the main purposes for which
wood is consumed per annum :

To provide man with the wood he needs,
the virgin forests are being destroyed.
Forest today covers about one-third of the
surfaces of the earth. This area is twice as
large as the land actually being cultivated.
Of the world's forests, 2, 500 million acre. 
have been used or pillaged, for about half
of them are devastated. It is an unpleasant
truth that less than 10 per cent of the world's
forests are managed in a planned way so that
they are renewed regularly.
This is a crime against mankind. FOI
according to Egon Glesinger, former secretary-
general of the Comité International du Bois,
and now of the Food and Agriculture Organi-
zation, modern technology applied to forestry
can greatly increase the world's real wealth.
He suggested, for instance, that in under-
developed areas wood gas"can he the vehicle
for spreading progress and civilization to
individuals, communities and nations which
lack other fuel supplies". Wood will never
he ahle to compete as a fuel with coal or oil,
he adds. But because it is the most widely
used of fuels, it provides an easy means of
starting to turn the whee) s that) ead to modern
civilization.
Without the restoration of forests, economic
independence will he diffieult to achieve in
the underdeveloped territories of the world.
Vtillions of Chinese and Indians do not use
wood for fuse !, because it does not exist in the
regions where they) ive. They use as fuel the
dung that should serve as a fertiliser. Given
adequate wood supplies, food output could be
increased by at least 13 per cent.
The forest, in fact, can provide a complete
industrial economy-and a permanent one,
for, as distinct from coal and oil, forests can
be renewed. The forest can feed, clothe,
shelter and warm us.
Now that we are beginning to understand
the full implications of this, it is time we put
an end to our indiscriminate waste, not only
of this natural resource, but of natural re-
sources generally. It is in our own interests
to understand the workings of nature. That
is behind the work of the International Union
for the Protection of Nature (IUPN), which
was founded in 1948 with the help of Unesco.
The IUPN has set out to facilitate co-
operation in the protection of nature and
natural scenery ; to organize scientific research
and the spread of knowtedgeon the protection
of nature and to help in regional planning for
the protection of nature, and the creation and
conservation of natural parks and reserves.
Unesco is interested, because one of the
principal causes of world unrest is lack of
natural resources and the wasteful use of
pxisting ones. Also the teaching of the proper
techniques for utilization and conservation is
Ihe joint task of Fundamental Education and
the popularizers of science.
As one writer has put it :"Nature provides
us with everything : our nourishment, clothing,
shelter, comfort, in addition to the beauty and
the health gained by taking advantage of the
facilities nature offers. Therefore we ought
to love nature as one loves a generous mother,
who is also beautiful, and in whom we place
our trust.
"Man must not be negligent and impoverish
this mother to whom he owes so much. For
if mother nature loses her riches, her children
will be the first victims."

LARGEST MAN. MADE
FOREST
The world's largest man-

New Zealand-will shortly
supply newsprint under a
$ 30, 000, 000 project. Planted
since 1920, the forest covers
1, 000 square miles. In New
Zealand's sub-tropical cli-
mate, its pine trees have
matured more rapidly than
in their native California
and Oregon. A large pulp,
paper and saw-mill to be
built at Marupara will have
an estimated capacity of
100, 000 tons of newsprint,
10, 000 of other printing pa-
per and 10, 000 tons of pulp.
Two-thirds of the output
will be available for export.

Wood is the basic raw material used for making newsprint and many
other products. Forests can be made to grow again and again, but only
if their exploitation is carefully planned. Ruthless destruction of trees
leads to devastation and prevents the continued use of this natural
resource. Afforestation will not only protect nature-it will also protect
man himself. (Photo Copyright K. W. Gullers, Stockholm.)

Haiti's Marbial Valley region has become a testing ground for
modern methods of education introduced into the valley by the Haitian
Government in co-operation with Unesco. The purpose of Unesco's
pilot project in fundamental education is to find ways of giving
people the basic knowledge they need to improve their standards
of living-always keeping in mind that these methods must be
entirely within their means. The Marbial Valley, where these
methods are being tested, once was a prosperous farming region
but it has suffered heavily from soil erosion (in the rainy season its
Gosseline River becomes a muddy torrent, washing away priceless
topsoil). The photo above shows some of the inhabitants of the
valley crossing the Gosseline River. A first-hand report on the Marbiai
experiment in action is published on Pages 4 and 5 of this issue.

WORLD POLITICAL EVENTS AND UNESCO
by Jaime TORRES BODET
A S ! rise 10 speak, and to greet you on behalf of Unesco. I cannot helpthinking of the day in September 1947 when, as leader of the Mexican
-- delegation. I had the honour of addressing the General Assembly for the
first time. The world had iust emerged from the war. Out of the ruins,
amid splendid dreams, peace was striving to establish itself. The various
agencies of the United Nations were in their infancy. I thought it appropriate
then to emphasize that the mission of the United Nations and that of the Special-
ized Agencies in the common task of securing peace was basically the same.
In that belief I accepted, in the following year. the office of Director-General of
Unesco. Passing thus from the service of my own country to the service of an
international organization, from politics to administration, I felt that I was remain.
ing true to the same cause-the cause of peace founded on economic and social
justice and on the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind-of peace, in
short, which would depend not merely upon Governments but upon the peoples
of the word.
to combat certain evils : hunger, disease, ignorance and want.
faced with which every man, to whatever country or party he
may belong, feels the same need for help or the same brotherly
urge to help others.
Two peculiarities distinguish Unesco from the other Specialized
Agencies. More than any of the others, it is directly affected by
Certainly I cannot forget the disappointment and the anxieties of the last four
years. But precisely because these difficulties are piling up in the political
sphere, it is imperative to reaffirm that peace is not a purely political pheno-
menon. It is also conditioned by economic, social, intellectual and moral factors.
less spectacular than the political ones, perhaps, but not less important. The
more obstacles the United Nations system encounters on the political plane, the
more desirable it is that its efficiency should be manifested in other domains.
where the concrete needs and the real aspirations of men in the last resort reside.
That is exactly what the SpeciaUzed Agencies are trying to do. They set out

over and expanded by the govern-
ments. This is a source of qreat
satisfaction to us, since our aim is to
help countries to help themselves.
As in malaria control, so also qreat
progress is being made in many
countries, with assistance from WHO,
in combatting the venereal infections
and tuberculosis which for centuries
have claimed millions of victims each
year. In the field of public health
administration 27 countries have
asked for and received help through
WHO during 1951 alone. This year,
too, there are joint UNICEF/WHO
programmes under way in 16 count-
ries for improving the health of
mothers and children.
One of the most important func-
tions of WHO is to promote the
exchange of scientific information so
that knowledge and skills acquired
by any one country become avail-
able to all others. In this connection
I could cite the 12 major teaching
and training projects being carried
out at the present moment or the 498
fellowships which have been award-
ed this year by WHO to specialists
from more than seventy countries for
study abroad. I might also mention
the world-wide importance of the
International Pharmacopoeia which,
published, a few days ago, marks the
culmination of 14 years of work by
experts from many countries.
My list of examples could be
continued almost indefinitely : but I
prefer to bring it to an end by telling
you in slightly more detail the story
of just one of many activities, one
which aptly illustrates the fact that
the seeds of international co-
operation, once well planted, are
certain to grow and bring forth
fruit.
Early in its history WHO consider-
ed how it could help meet the need
for more widespread knowledge of
modern techniques in anaesthesio-
logy. Individual consultants were
sent, first to Austria, in 1947, and
then to Poland and Finland in 1948.
By 1950 interest had qrown so
strong in the Scandinavian countries
that a training centre to serve this
area as a whole was opened in Co-
penhagen, jointly operated by WHO
and the University of Copenhagen.
As the work of this training centre
in anaesthesiology became known,
other countries outside the Scandi-
navian group began to send students
there. Indeed, Yugoslavia, France,
Greece and Israel wished to have
similar training centres set up in
their own countries. The work of
the centre was therefore broadened
and, in addition to all the Scandi-
navian countries, included physicians
from Switzerland, Greece and France.
In the same year we sent individual
consultants in anaesthesiology to
Yugoslavia, Israel and Turkey. Dur-
ing 1951 this work has been con-
tinued in Israel and started in Iran.
The beginning of 1952 will see con-
sultants at work in Ceylon, in
Burma and in Thailand.
From a very small beginning
WHO's activity in this one field has
spread from country to country on
the common ground of need, so that
within just these few years since
1947 seventeen countries have gain-
ed tangibly in knowledge and skills
with which to protect and promote
the well-being of their peoples.
What. you are entitled to ask, is
likely to be the enduring significance
of the various kinds of work which
WHO has initiated around the globe ?
In at least two important respects we
can give. even now, very concrete
and very categorical answers to this
question. First, throuqh the existence
of a world health agency the suffer-
ing of millions of human beings in
scores of countries will be alleviated
and many, many thousands of lives
will be saved. Second, the move-
ment of doctors. nurses. sanitary
engineers, etc. from one country to
another under the auspices of WHO,
the actual teamwork of specialists
coming from different regions with
differing social and cultural back-
grounds. is resulting in a valuable
cross-fertilization of ideas and in
establishing strong emotional and
intellectual bonds across inter-
national boundaries.
All thi creates conditions which
are unquestionably favourable to
the development of harmonious re-
lations and mutual understanding
among the nations. But can we go
beyond this and say flatly that the
work being done now by WHO is. a
major contribution to the cause of
peace ? I think not-at least not
under present circumstances and not
unless we make certain reservations.
And this brings me to the second
lesson which I believe we have
learned from the brief experience of
our work in WHO. It is a lesson
which, like the first one, has impor-
tant implications for the whole of the
United Nations system.
In attempting to evaluate projects
we were carrying out, we quickly
discovered the fallacy of equatina
health work with health progress, let

BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS
FOR LABOUR
by David A. MORSE
Director-General, International Labour Organization.
T HE General Assembly will be called upon during
the present session to take further decision--
(-ol1cerning the proposed Covenant on Human
Rights and its implementation. The Internatiolla I
Labour Organization win continue to give it"filII 1'0-
uperalion in the consideration of those rights which
constitute its special responsibility.
Four years ago the General Assembly asked us t
proceed with the adoption of an InlernationaI Lalnmr
Convention on the protection of trade union rights, am !
two years ago the Economic and Social COllnei ! askp"
us to establish a fact-fending and conciliation commission
which conld conduct an impartial examination no
allegations concerning the infringement of trade union
rights. The Convention was adopted by the tenter-
naLlonal auour omerence m ty : rrs ana o m nwv rn trrn nr m· m nwrrn-
ments whic ! i have ratified it, but widespr'ead further ratincatinn is still neces-
sary to make the Convention an effective safeguard for the protection of trade
union rights throughout the world. I therefore appeal to the Government-
which have not yet ratified this Convention to give it urgenl consideration.
The fact-finding and conciliation commission has been established hut it can
function onto with the consent of the Governments concerned. Hitherto no
Government has given its formal consent 10 t'efer to the commission questions
concerning it. The governing body is taking action to expedite the preliminary
examination of allegations so that the reference of appropriate cases to the
commission may he facilitated, but the responsibility for our success or failure
in this task, which live have undertaken on your beha) f. rests squlrely upon the
Governments concerned. I make an earnest. appeal to Governments to accept
the principle of impartial and disinterested investigation of allegations as the
only alternative to continuing international tension. The International Labour
Organization witi provide facilities for the impartial examination of the facts in
an atmosphere free from political prejudice or propaganda.
In the same spirit the ILO has approached the problem of forced labour.
Tile Secretary-General and I have appointed a committee to survey the use of
forced labour as a means of political coercion and as an important element in
national economies. We have been particularly concerned to ensure that it is
a body enjoying the independence necessary for completely impartial and
objective examination of the nvhote question.
The International Labour Organization, in its search for social justice and its
efforts in laying a basis for world peace, is engaged in a variety of basic pro-
grammes ranging from improving the lot of indigenous workers to improving
methods and techniques of production. It Js carrying on widespread technical
assistance activities both as part of ils normal work as well as through tlie
Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance. It has established field office
and miss : ons in several countries, while technical experts are working under its
auspices in a great number of countries, dealing with a variety of questions.
It is because of the political urgency of the matter that we have given special
emphasis in our recent work to the problem of migration from Europe. Our
chief concern is to see that the problem is solved before it becomes a major
element in international tension. Recently, \ve put forward an international
plan for migration at a conference in Naples. The nations represented felt
unable to consider the plan on its merits but we succeeded in focussing attention
on the gravity of the problem and in drawing out the views of the various
governments concerned with the migration of Europe's surplus millions. \\e
still urge that the problem must be solved and solved without undue delay.
The regional activities of the International Labour Organization have been
further intensified, especially in Asia and in Latin America. \\e are taking
steps to extend activities in the Middle East.
In conclusion, I would like to echo the plea in the Secretary-General's report
on his Twenty-Year Programme for universalit y in the membership of the
United Nations and the Specialized Agencies. The International Labour Orga-
nization remains universal in its interests and outlook. It is not, and will never
be allowed to become an instrument of the policy of any State or group of
States. It welcomes to membership all States which are willing to accept the
obligations of its Constitution, and co-operates with all regional organizations
which are prepared to act with it. To make it possible for all human beings,
irrespective of race, creed or sex to pursue their material well-being and their
spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security
and equal opportunity-that is our objective, and we look forward 10 the day
when we can be proud to have achieved the active and'whole-hearted (4)-
operation in pursuit of this objective of evpl'Y : \ff'mher of fll,. {"nill'cJ :'\a I ion,. :.

sophy an explicit recognition of the
fact that efforts to raise standards of
physical, mental and social well-
being are at the same time steps
which lead toward the achievment
of collective security and enduring
peace.
The WHO Constitution, which has
now been accepted by 79 States,
proclaims that the health of all
peoples is fundamental to the attain-
ment of peace and security."It
further declares that"the enjoyment
of the highest attainable standard
of health is one of the fundamental
rights of every human being with-
out distinction of race, religion, po-
litical belief, economic or social
condition and that these principles"are basic to the happiness, har-
monious relations and security of all
peoples.
The organization which was built
on these fundamental concepts is
today only a little over three years
old. Despite serious limitations
WHO is already carrying out an im-
pressive number of important inter-
national projects. If we consider
them together for a few minute, I
am sure that the same questions will
occur to all of us : What are the
lessons which our common action
against disease and for better health
has taught us so far ? And, above all,
what has WHO been able to con-
tribute to the cause of peace ?
The first lesson which we in WHO
have learned is. I believe, that true

There are already many cases in the

ple, there is the astonishing progress
made by a number of countries in

as well as in other parts of the world
against one of the worst age-old
scourges of makind : malaria.
In many places this progress has
been buttressed through help given
by WHO and UNICEF in the form of
international demonstration teams.
In some countries, after barely two
years of such demonstration work,
projects affecting the health and

PEACE CANNOT BE BUILT IN
A HUNGRY WORLD
THE General Assembly under-
) stands clearly that world peace
cannot be built upon a founda-
tion of hunger and misery,
for the Assembly has itself emphasis-
ed this in 1946 and upon other occa-
sions. The Economic and Social
Council, in its last two major ses-
sions, has placed the need to improve
the food situation in the very fore-
front of the world's economic and
social problems.
We need to continue measuring the
size and the growth of the job to be
done, but we need talk at no great
length about how important it is.
The overwhelming and immediate
need is to find and do the concrete
and effective things that will pro-
duce more food and bring it to the
world's hungry,
The size of the problem is enor-
mous, but not too vast to grasp. It
is growing larger, but not at a rate
which we cannot overtake, provided
only that we begin to act.
The League of Nations in 1935-37
found that half the world's popula-
tion suffered from malnutrition and
dnder-nutrition. The post-war situa-
tion was somewat worse. In 1946,
FAO's World Food Survey found
that if only reasonably adequate diets
were to be available, the world's food
production would need to be increas-
ed 90 per cent by 1960, and 120 per
cent by 1970. A further survey is
now being made.
Nineteen-sixty is only eight years
away. Since 1935-38, world popula-
tion has increased by 12 per cent,
world food production by only 9 per
cent. The greater increase in food
production occurred in parts of the
world already well fed. Upon a per
capita basis, the world has less food
available than before the war.
Furthermore, present trends in a
number of cuntries indicate that
amour s of ford entering interna-
tional trade a-' likely to decrease
rather than increase. This is serious,

Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization.
not only for normal food-importing
countries, but also for countries
which usually have not had to im-
port food but which today find them-
selves urgently in need of imported
supplies.
The cruel famine which millions in
India are now suffering, in spite of
great efforts by their government, re-
veals how dangerously thin is the
margin between bare subsistence and
actual death. Nor do the famine
headlines reveal the millions of hu-
man beings who are today hungry,
weak, inefficient and doomed to
early death. To the world's shame,
this is so usual that it is not news.
What has to be done is known.
During the last six years, in FAO's
meetings, the ministers, administra-
tors and technicians of 65 countries
have reached substantial agreement.
Numerous studies by our secretariat
have contributed the factual bases.
These six years have brought pro-
gress, but not enough. Within the
limited means of FAO, now substan-
tially increased by the Expanded
Technical Assistance Programme, we
are now giving some degree of direct
assistance to more than 40 countries,
and in many fields..
In the people's hands
THE heart of the problem lies inwhat governm nts can and will
do. FAO can help them, but we
cannot do what governments cannot
or will not do. International advice
and assistance are of little good
unless governments themselves take
vigorous action, sometimes even
drastic action.
The technical steps that need to be
taken are known clearly enough for
all parts of the world, even though
often there are not yet enough train-
ed technicians But while trained
technicians are indispensable, they
cannot themselves add one mouthful
of food to the world's supply.
Food is not produced in government
ministries.
Only the people who farm the land
and fish the waters can produce
more food. It is in their hands that
the giant power of modern techno-
logy must be placed. And this can
be done only if the necessary eco-
nomic and social conditions are
created.
These conditions include, in many
countries, improvements in land
tenure and other rural institutions,
the provision of credit, the avail-
ability of tools and equipment,
improved seed, and fertilizers.
Above all, he must have the
incentive to produce, and must feel
that, if he improves his methods, he
can increase his crops and better his
condition. This knowledge must be
brought to the individual farmer on
his individual farm, in practical
ways that he will understand and
accept, even over the barriers of
ignorance and illiteracy.
To create these conditions and
services, which alone can unlock the
power of technology and give us
the hope of feeding the world better,
will require a great intensification
of effort by governments and by
their international agencies. All
experience shop s that large expendi-
tures by governments for these
purposes will be profitable invest-
ments. The greater amount of the
expenditures will need to be internal.
The international agencies can only
supply the little leavening. And the
effort must be all along the front,
for food production is locked to
health-and both to education.
At this point, we need simple,
practical, positive
action. How sim-
ple and practical
the steps to pro-
gress can be is
illustrated by one
of our projects
in Afghanistan, where the govern-
ment asked FAO's help in its pro-
gramme to improve the tools and
methods of farmers. In village
demonstrations, FAO's practical spe-
cialists in small farm tools have
shown farmers how one man with a
scythe can mow as much hay as 13
men with primitive sickles. Scythes
can be made by village blacksmiths.
No clearer voice
THE General Assembly has animportant part to play. There
is no assembly in the world
with a louder and clearer voice than
yours. Not only do ministers and
technicians listen when you speak,
but rulers and peoples. For this
reason, FAO has warmly welcomed
the initiative taken by the General
Assembly in 1950 regarding problems
of land tenure.
If the dreadful gap between the
hungry and the fed continues to
widen, it will, like the fatal crack
in the foundation of a building,
forever threaten the stability of the
structure of world peace which this
Assembly is trying to build for the
peoples of all the world.
I know that the General Assembly
is convinced of the extreme se-
riousness of the world food problems
and of the urgency of national and
international action. If you speak
for action, you will strongly reinforce
the efforts which, I am sure, the
FAO Conference will make to set
action in motion in each individual
country toward the conquest of
hunger, enemy of peace.

political events, and more than the
others too. it is deeply committed to
long-term policies. On the one hand,
its standing with the public depends
largely on the authority of the inter-
national order for which you are res-
ponsible, and on the other hand it is
responsible to you for stimulating
that international morality without
which your efforts could have no
lasting result.
In 1933. writers, scientists and philo-
sophers from a number of countries
were brought together by the Interna-
tional Institute of Intellectual Co-
operation to discuss the future of
civilization. They agreed on a
seven-point declaration, of which the
first two read as follows :
"1. The immediate future of civiliza-
tion. in all its forms, is closely depend-
ent upon the maintenance of peace.
and all other circumstances of a more
particular and technical nature turn
upon this issue.
"2. The future of culture, even within
individual countries, is essentially
bound up with certain universal factors
which, in their turn, are dependent
upon the organization of the human
race as one moral and legal entity."
It would be difficult to find better
words to define the way in which the
day-to-day administrative work of
Unesco is dependent upon the political
action of the United Nations.
We are constantly receiving proof
of this. Every worsening of inter-
national political relations immediately
reacts upon those who are carrying
out our programme, accentuates their
ideological differences, and threatens
to destroy their aspirations towards
world harmony.
Rampart of hope
AGAINST the rising tide of passionand fear. Unesco is erecting a
rampart of security and hope by
demonstrating the benefits of interna-
tional intellectual co-operation. By
helping scientists throughout the world
to get in touch with one another, it
reveals the existence of a way of
thought controlled by standards of uni-
versal truth. Still better, it tries to mo-
bilize experts in certain fields for a spe-
cific task of an international character.
either by organizing national research
according to an international plan. as
in the case of the problems of the arid
zone, or bv creating international in-
stitutions like the Computation Centre,
whose services are placed at the dis-
posal of Member States. Similarly, by
facilitating cultural exchanges, Unesco
provides proof that every culture pos-
sesses treasures which could and
should enrich humanity as a whole.
and vice versa that every culture can
be revivified by contact with other
civilizations. In all these domains, the
work carried out by Unesco has the
effect of liberating and strengthening
the reality of an international com-
munity of minds, which foreshadows
and prepares the way for the world
community of peoples.
It is not within Unesco's power to
determine whether the transition from
one to the other shall take place rapid-
ly or not. That issue depends on the
political rather than the technical
opportunity. National frontiers must be
opened to the free now of ideas, of the
persons who generate them, and of
the material which arises from these
ideas and helps to carry them into
effect. Freedom of expression must be
guaranteed, the rights of scientists,
authors and artists must be assured.
Then only shall we be able to measure
the full extent of the power of the in-
telIect as the organizing and unifying
principle of human society.
If we want intellectual and moral
factors to play their effective part in
the friendship and mutual understand-
ing of peoples, there must be a re-
adjustment in the political sphere.
First and foremost we must adequately
secure the present, so that the mind,
freed from preoccupation with the
immediate future, can have enough
perspective of time before it to recover
its utmost capacities.
End to inequality
ON this subject I can only agreewholeheartedly with the Secreta-
ry-General. whose twenty-year
plan for peace, among its other merits,
has the advantage of trying to extricate
the policies of the United Nations from
an atmosphere of crisis and give them
back their proper dimensions in time.
Unesco's work for peace must be

regarded in this broad perspective. For
the task to which it summons its Mem-
ber States is vast and arduous.
More than half the population of the
world can neither read nor write, and
is plunged in almost total ignorance.
What a waste of energy ! What an
opening to exploitation ! What a breed-
ing-ground for revolt ! How can a
regime of peace, that is
to say, of reciprocal
respect for rights, or
how can peaceful pro-
gress for all, result from
such inequalifies ot
knowledge ?
It is to the lessening
of this inequality that
Unesco is bending all
its efforts, by carrying
out its policy in two
parallel directions : pri-
mary education and
fundamental education.
The Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights
proclaims in Article 26
the principle of free
and compulsory primary
education. Unesco is
steadily endeavouring
to promote the effective applica-
tion of that principle. Last July, in
association with the International Bu-
reau of Education, we considered the
problem as a whole at the Fourteenth
Conference on Public Education. This
conference, which was attended by the
delegates 01 fifty Governments, recom-
mended that every State in which pri-
mary education does not yet extend to
the entire population 01 school age,
should draw up as soon as possible a
priority plan which, while taking into
account the needs and resources 01 the
country concerned, would provide prac-
tical measures over a period 01 years
to ensure the steady expansion 01 free
and compulsory schooling.
Basing itself upon the conclusions 01
the Geneva conference, Unesco is now
proposing to organize regional cone-
rences, to be held every other year.
at which we shall lace and discuss
the relevant economic, social and
intellectual facts in every part 01 the
world. The purpose 01 these regional
conferences will be to help States in
working out and putting into practice
their respective national plans by pool-
ing their experience and knowledge.
However, so lonq as the majority of
Jaime Torres Bodet
the children of the world are denied
access to primary education, we
cannot ignore the mass of illiterates of
all ages who have never had the ad-
vantage of such education. It is for
the benefit of these outcasts. who have
been reckoned for decades in hundreds
of millions, that Unesco has formulated
the concept of fundamental education.
By fundamental educa-
tion we mean that mi-

ral and civic instruction

science, culture or in-
formation in the most
elementary sense in
which modern commu-
nities understand those
terms. Admittedly, in
comparison to primary
education, fundamental
education is no more
than an expedient. But
it its an urgent expedient,
if we do not want whole
generations, in a large
number of countries, to
run to waste.
After several years of
research, the General Conference of
Unesco at its last session adopted a
project which involves the setting up
of a network of international centres
where we shall work out, with due re-
gard to the special needs of the va-
rious regions of the world, methods of
training staff and producing the neces-
sary material for fundamental educa-
tion. The first centre was opened this
year in Latin America. We estimate
that to carry out this project in its
entirely will take twelve years and
will result in the training of about five
thousand fundamental education spe-
cialists who in their turn will train
teams of specially qualified teachers
in their own countries.
Thus, on the two fronts of the pre-
sent and the iuture. Unesco has taken
up arms against ignorance. But the
problem of education is not purely one
of quantity : it is one of guality. too.
The number of schools, teachers and
pupils is not the only thing to be con-
sidered : the kind of education given in
these schools, by these teachers, to
these pupils, is still more important.
For if it is possible to educate people
for liberty, it is also possible to train
them for servitude.
Unesco does not attempt to impose
any particular ideology. On the con-
trary, Unesco is founded on respect for
all creeds and it wants to see them all
represented in its orbit. Yet in the
debate between peace and war. liberty
and injustice, which sets men in oppo-
sition not merely to ideas, but to men,
Unesco can never be neutral. It will
always be found in the service of
human rights and of international
law, the establishment of which is more
necessary than ever if these rights are
to be guaranteed.
Value of the mind
CLEARLY, those who foundedUnesco in 1945 did not fores e
we should have tao grow up
in a world like that of today.
They did not think that six years
later the military budgets of the
nations would reach a total of one hun-
dred billions of dollars, as the Secre-
tary-General has stated in his Report,
nor that Governments would feel
themselves obliged to pay more fatten-
tion to the production of weapons of
death and destruction than to the
peaceful requirements of education,
science and culture.
Nevertheless, even in this world
poisoned by distrust and paralyzed by
fear, Unesco works to maintain and
establish peace. It works to maintain
peace by demonstrating to the masses,
as well as to the elite. the value that
the mind can add to earthly existence.
It strives to establish peace by giving
to all men intellectual and moral ac-
cess to the rights and responsibilities
of heedom, and by promoting the
triumph of the international civic
spirit over individual and collective
selfishness.
Mr. President and delegates, I have
shown how Unesco is affected by your
difficulties, shares the anxieties which
at present beset you, and yet feels that
it is the bearer of your highest and
most exalted hopes. You will under-
stand therefore, how very important this
Session of your General Assembly is
for us, and how ardently I wish you
success in your deliberations. On this
same site on which, three years ago.
by the adoption of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights, you held out
a qreat promise to mankind, may your
labours lead the peoples of the world
towards the highways of justice, of
truth, and of peace.
