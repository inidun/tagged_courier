The banner of peace
"To develop the creative talents of young
people throughout the world; to encourage
the exchange of ideas in the field of educa¬
tion; to help spread knowledge of the
cultural heritage and traditions of the na¬
tions of the world; to promote a more sear¬
ching scientific analysis of the pedagogical,
professional, social and human problems
involved in the full development of children
and to increase their creative potential"
these, in brief, writes professor Nikolai
Todorov of the Bulgarian Academy of
Sciences, are the objectives of the Banner of
Peace movement. Originating in Bulgaria,
this movement has the support of many
countries and of several international
organizations, including Unesco. One of
the highlights of the International Year of
the Child, 1979, when the young people of
Bulgaria were hosts to 1 ,300 children from
76 countries, was the inauguration of the
Banner of Peace Monument. This consists
of a central tower surrounded by two semi¬
circular walls from which are hung bells
sent from many countries each accom¬
panied by an appeal for peace on earth.
Above, a group of children photographed

gathering of children, Sofia 85, is to be held
this year in the Bulgarian capital.

The Courier
A window open on the world

Editorial
IT is the great virtue of anniversaries that, paradoxically,
they are timeless occasions, when present, past and
future briefly escape the tyranny of calendar and clock
to remind us of their essential unity. Looking back into the
past we see the roots of the present; looking forward we see
the shadowy outlines of a number of possible futures the
choice between which depends upon our present actions.
In this issue of the Unesco Courier, which commemorates
the fortieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World
War, while remembering with awe the heroism and the suf¬
fering of its fifty million dead of all nations, our aim is
primarily to stress the appalling cultural wounds inflicted in
a conflict in which spiritual values were the first to be
attacked.
Our second purpose is to draw attention to the grim future
that eminent Soviet and US scientists agree we are preparing
for the world. In fact, they say, backing up their words with
cold scientific evidence, that if a nuclear war were to occur,
the world would be plunged into the darkness of "nuclear
winter" and we would have no future at all.
Today it is clear that the physical and moral courage that,
forty years ago, prevented the world from slipping back into
the Dark Ages is no longer enough. As the preamble to
Unesco's Constitution declares "... it is in the minds of men
that the defences of peace must be constructed..."
Nevertheless, it is proper that we should remember the
sacrifice made by men, women and children of many nations
four decades ago. Within the limitations of our thirty-six
pages it is clearly impossible to compile a complete roll of
honour, nor was it our intention to attempt to do so; in evok¬
ing one great collective feat of arms, one act of individual
courage and endurance, one example of the human spirit
withstanding the worst horrors that man is capable of inflic¬
ting on man, we pay homage to them all.
Their greatest achievement was to give us hope. They
paved the way for the emergence of new nations and preserv¬
ed the cultural heritage which has made possible new con¬
quests of the human spirit.

Peace
and human values
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
» Director-General of Unesco
THE Second World War came to an end in 1945, on 8 May in the
European theatre, on 2 September in the Pacific. The war had
seen the systematic practice of collective massacres, the destruc¬
tion of cities on a massive scale, the deportation of entire populations,
and the organization of many extermination camps. Precipitated by the
will to dominate, its mainspring blind intolerance and prejudice, the
war afflicted humanity not only through its toll of flesh and blood but
by striking at the source of its deepest beliefs, the most precious
elements of the cultures of peoples. The brutal rejection of human
values was a characteristic of this world conflict, but so too was the un¬
compromising defence of such values. It is our duty to honour those
who gave their lives to preserve world civilizations and human freedom,
and to remind today's generations of their sufferings and sacrifices.
To honour their memory is also to recall the task of reconciliation and
reconstruction which began at the end of the war with the foundation
of the United Nations and of Unesco. The mission specially entrusted
to Unesco has been to reinforce peace between the nations through
education, science and culture, by contributing to the establishment of
new relationships based on the principles of knowledge, justice and
mutual comprehension.
Today more than ever, this mission which Unesco has resolutely
endeavoured to accomplish remains imperative.
The image of the world which is increasingly gaining ground in the
minds of people everywhere is that of a single and complex expanse in
which the sources of friction are proliferating while the means of com¬
munication are growing more effective and the reasons for co-operation
are becoming explicit.
Never more than today have men felt so capable both of mutual
understanding and of mutual destruction. Since 1945, there has been an
endless succession of so-called local wars which have caused the deaths
of tens of millions of persons. Today the acceleration of the arms race,
coupled to the extension of these local conflicts with international
ramifications, heighten the danger of a generalized confrontation and
threaten the future of mankind to an unprecedented degree.
The gravity of these dangers is beginning to be widely felt and giving
greater prominence to the aspiration of all the peoples of the world to
a lasting peace, based on respect for the rights of individuals, for the
liberty of nations and for justice, and on universal progress.
This is why Unesco, faithful to the principles set forth in its Constitu¬
tion, is continuing to make a contribution to the development, in its
fields of competence, of mutual understanding, tolerance, respect and
solidarity between individuals and between peoples, as well as the
recognition of their reciprocal rights and duties.
It is incumbent on all of us to work towards a genuine renewal of
values, bringing to them the sense of an uninterrupted continuity bet¬
ween the rights of each man, those of each nation and those of the entire
human community.
The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the end of the Se¬
cond World War reminds us of this duty and urges us to perform it.

Why war? A letter from Albert Einstein to Sigmund Freud
The text below is a slightly abridged version ofa letter written by Albert Einstein
to Sigmund Freud. Under the title Why War ?, the letter and Freud's reply to it
were published in 1933 by the International Institute of Intellectual Co¬
operation. Theyformedpart ofan international series ofopen letters, sponsored
by the Institute, in which leading intellectuals exchanged ideas on major ques¬
tions, the most crucial of which was the threat of war.
Caputh near Potsdam, 30 July, 1932
Dear Professor Freud,
...Is there any way of delivering mankind from the menace of
war? It is common knowledge that, with the advance of
modern science, this issue has come to mean a matter of life
and death for civilization as we know it; nevertheless, for all
the zeal displayed, every attempt at its solution has ended in
a lamentable breakdown.
I believe, moreover, that those whose duty it is to tackle the
problem professionally and practically are growing only too
aware of their impotence to deal with it, and have now a very
lively desire to learn the views of men who, absorbed in the
pursuit of science, can see world-problems in the perspective
distance lends. As- for me, the normal objective of my thought
affords no insight into the dark places of human will and feel¬
ing. Thus, in the enquiry now proposed, I can do little more
than seek to clarify the question at issue and, clearing the
ground of the more obvious solutions, enable you to bring the
light of your far-reaching knowledge of man's instinctive life
to bear upon the problem...
...As one immune from nationalist bias, I personally see a
simple way of dealing with the superficial (i.e. administrative)
aspect of the problem: the setting up, by international con¬
sent, of a legislative and judicial body to settle every conflict
arising between nations. Each nation would undertake to
abide by the orders issued by this legislative body, to invoke
its decision in every dispute, to accept its judgments
unreservedly and to carry out every measure the tribunal
deems necessary for the execution of its decrees. But here, at
the outset, I come up against a difficulty; a tribunal is a human
institution which, in proportion as the power at its disposal is
inadequate to enforce its verdicts, is all the more prone to suf¬
fer these to be deflected by extrajudicial pressure. This is a fact
with which we have to reckon; law and might inevitably go
hand in hand, and juridical decisions approach more nearly
the ideal justice demanded by the community (in whose name
and interests these verdicts are pronounced) in so far as the
community has effective power to compel respect of its
juridical ideal. But at present we are far from possessing any
supranational organization competent to render verdicts of in¬
contestable authority and enforce absolute submission to the
execution of its verdicts. Thus I am led to my first axiom: the
quest of international security involves the unconditional sur¬
render by every nation, in a certain measure, of its liberty of
action, its sovereignty that is to say, and it is clear beyond all
doubt that no other road can lead to such security.
The ill-success, despite their obvious sincerity, of all the ef¬
forts made during the last decade to reach this goal leaves us
no room to doubt that strong psychological factors are at
work, which paralyse these efforts. Some of these factors are
not far to seek. The craving for power which characterizes the
governing class in every nation is hostile to any limitation of
the national sovereignty. This political power-hunger is wont
to batten on the activities of another group, whose aspirations
are on purely mercenary, economic lines. I have specially in
mind that small but determined group, active in every nation,
composed of individuals who, indifferent to social considera¬
tions and restraints, regard warfare, the manufacture and sale
of arms, simply as an occasion to advance their personal in¬
terests and enlarge their personal authority.
But recognition of this obvious fact is merely the first step
towards an appreciation of the actual state of affairs. Another
question follows hard upon it: How is it possible for this small
clique to bend the will of the majority, who stand to lose and
suffer by a state of war, to the service of their ambitions? (In
speaking of the majority, I do not exclude soldiers of every
rank who have chosen war as their profession, in the belief
that they are serving to defend the highest interests of their
race, and that attack is often the best method of defence.) An
obvious answer to this question would seem to be that the
minority, the ruling class at present, has the schools and press,
usually the Church as well, under its thumb. This enables it to
organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its
tool of them.
Yet even this answer does not provide a complete solution.
Another question arises from it: How is it these devices suc¬
ceed so well in rousing men to such wild enthusiasm, even to
sacrifice their lives? Only one answer is possible. Because man
has within him a lust for hatred and destruction. In normal
times this passion exists in a latent state, it emerges only in
unusual circumstances; but it is a comparatively easy task to
call it into play and raise it to the power of a collective
psychosis. Here lies, perhaps, the crux of all the complex of
factors we are considering, an enigma that only the expert in
the lore of human instincts can resolve.
And so we come to our last question. Is it possible to control
man's mental evolution so as to make him proof against the
psychoses of hate and destructiveness? Here I am thinking by
no means only of the so-called uncultured masses. Experience
proves that it is rather the so-called "Intelligentzia" that is
most apt to yield to these disastrous collective suggestions,
since the intellectual has no direct contact with life in the raw,
but encounters it in its easiest, synthetic form upon the
printed page.
To conclude: I have so far been speaking only of wars bet¬
ween nations; what are known as international conflicts. But
I am well aware that the aggressive instinct operates under
other forms and in other circumstances. (I am thinking of civil
wars, for instance, due in earlier days to religious zeal, but
nowadays to social factors; or, again, the persecution of racial
minorities). But my insistence on what is the most typical,
most cruel and extravagant form of conflict between man and
man was deliberate, for here we have the best occasion of
discovering ways and means to render all armed conflicts
impossible.
Yours very sincerely, A. Einstein

Cultural persecution: the first step
towards genocide by Frederic V. Grunfeld
"Part of my purpose in writing this book [Prophets Without Honour, see biographical note
below] is to give readers some inkling of what was lost in the collapse of thé Weimar
Renaissance, and how much of it remains forgotten to this day. Those who have not studied
the arts ofGermany in detail can hardly be expected to grasp the magnitude of the disaster... "

THE racial policies of the Third Reich
were applied with equal ferocity to
the orthodox and the assimilated,
to bankers and beggars, Nobel laureates,
department store clerks and school
children; to the president of the Academy,
Professor Liebermann, and to the German
women's fencing champion, Helene Mayer
(popularly known as die blonde He), who
won two Olympic medals for Germany; to
the 100,000 Jewish veterans, many of them
wounded or crippled, who had fought for
Germany during World War I and had
earned their 31,500 iron crosses as bravely
as the next man. At the same time, the Nazis
proceeded with the willful destruction of
everything that had to do with the Weimar
Renaissance. During the early years of the
regime the world was treated to the unusual
spectacle of a whole nation deliberately
committing cultural suicide. In the prevail¬
ing mindless frenzy to follow-the-Fo^re/-,
the mere possession of intellect became
grounds for suspicion, and "Aryans" who
persisted in trying to exercise it were de¬
nounced in the Nazi press as weisse Juden
(white Jews). As one popular Nazi jingle ex¬
pressed it:
Intellectual the word sounds so Jewish
and shrill;
A true German man can never be an
intellectual!
Nazism from the first had been essential¬
ly a revolt of the Know-Nothings, though
their ranks were soon swelled by members
of the aristocracy: as a cultural revolution it
aimed at nothing less than the annihilation
of the German intelligentsia. It was as if the
early Nazis could hardly wait to get their
hands on the machinery of State so that
they could begin smashing works of art and
burning books. As a matter of fact, one of
the party's first official acts, after winning
the local elections in Thuringia in 1930, was
to order the destruction of the fragile,
elegant murals created by Oskar Schlemmer
(an artist of impeccably "Aryan"
antecedents) for the Bauhaus at Weimar.
And within months after taking over the
central government of the Reich in 1933
they had succeeded in paralyzing the
literary life of the nation, pauperizing its
theatrical and musical activities and stripp¬
ing its museums of all great modern art
from Van Gogh and Picasso to Max
Beckmann and Paul Klee.
All this was done with an air of triumph
and complacency, as well as an utter
disregard for any practical consequences.
More than 1,100 "non-Aryan" faculty
members of universities and technical in¬
stitutes lost their jobs in the initial wave of
persecution. When the Nazi minister of
education, Rust, jovially inquired of Pro¬
fessor David Hubert, mentor of the famous
Göttingen Mathematical Institute, how
mathematics was faring at Göttingen under
the new dispensation, he received the
laconic reply "But Herr Minister, there is
no mathematics left at Göttingen!" A
travelling exhibition that made the rounds
of German schools at the same time
displayed Einstein's picture in the form of a
"wanted" poster that identified him as an
exiled subversive who remained at large and
"still unhanged." A postwar German
writer, assessing the damage which Nazi
policy inflicted on the nation's scientific
establishment, described the result in the
rueful phrase, die emigrierte Bombe.
Altogether, some 360,000 people-
slightly more than half of the German-
Jewish community were able to flee Ger¬
many so long as the exits remained open;
virtually all those who were left behind were
annihilated. The refugee intellectuals ac¬
counted for only a small fraction of the
total, yet they constituted the greatest in¬
tellectual migration in history. Included
among them were countless non-Jews who
chose not to make their peace with Hitler:
Heinrich and Thomas Mann, for example,
or the playwright and ex-cavalry officer
Fritz von Unruh; the poet Max Hermann-
Neisse, the Austrian novelist Robert Musil,
Erich Maria Remarque (All Quiet on the
Western Front) and the Bavarian writer
Oskar Maria Graf, who had responded to
the Nazi burning of the books with an open
letter demanding, "Burn my books, too!"
They were joined in voluntary exile by musi-
' cians like the brothers Fritz and Adolf
Busch and the composers Paul Hindemith
"A comprehensive system ofconcentration
camps served as an instrument for massive
population annihilation in the occupied
countries. The Nazis established 6,900
camps ofvarious kinds within the Reich and
the occupied countries in Poland these in¬
cluded A usch witz, where 4, 000, 000 perish¬
ed, andMajdanek, with 360,000 victims. In
addition to mass assassinations, such as
those at Auschwitz where whole convoys of
prisoners were taken from the arrival point
direct to the gas chambers, starvation was
also used as a means of extermination.
Prisoners' rations provided only about 700
calories a day and this, coupled with heavy
manual work, soon resulted in physical
deterioration. The average life expectancy
of a prisoner in a concentration camp was
barely six months".
Piotr Matusak (Poland)
The infamous concentration camp
of Auschwitz-Birkenau (Oswiecim-
Brzezinka), in southern Poland. It is now
the site of the Oswiecim State Museum
founded in 1946 as a memorial to the vic¬
tims of the Nazi terror who perished there
during World War II.

and Ernst Krenek; by the architects Walter
Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,
and by the painters Max Beckmann, Kurt
Schwitters and Paul Klee. Their attitude
was summed up by the composer Bêla Bar¬
tok, who left Hungary for America when he
saw the Nazis taking over the lands of the
old Hapsburg empire: "If someone stays on
here, when he could leave, he can thereby be
said to acquiesce tacitly in everything that is
happening here."
For understandable motives, some of the
minor poets stayed behind to applaud the
exodus. "Our wheat is being threshed on
the threshing-floor of literature," declared
the neo-romantic poet Börries von
Münchhausen (appropriately enough, a
descendant of the celebrated "Liar Baron"
von Münchhausen). "What does it matter
that, in sweeping out the chaff, a few
golden grains are lost? Germany, the heart
of all nations, is wasteful, like all true
hearts; stormy and Siegfried-like beats its
pulse." The truth was that virtually the
whole harvest had been swept out the door.
As Dorothy Thompson informed her
American readers, "practically everybody
who in world opinion had stood for what
was called German culture prior to 1933 is
now a refugee." But it was not until after
the war that the full extent of the damage
became apparent. "German literature is so
mutilated that it cannot recognize its own
condition," wrote Walter Muschg, who
had watched "the destruction of German
literature" from a neutral sanctuary in
Switzerland. The Nazi years had extinguish¬
ed a vital spark. "Since then Germany has
no longer possessed a great literature. When
the terror came to an end it remained
silent."
A whole generation of writers had been
"buried alive" in the process, their books
sent to the pulp mill, their names expunged
from the libraries. In exile, if they were not
already internationally known like Thomas
Mann, they lost their reading public and the
possibility of earning a living with their
native language: only a few of the younger
authors able to switch languages in
midstream, like Arthur Koestler, could con¬
tinue to support themselves by writing. And
postwar Germany, for a variety of reasons,
was slow to come to terms with its uncom¬
fortable ghosts of the twenties and thirties.
What remains is "a literature of the dead,"
as Muschg pointed out, "or rather of those
who died too soon, of those who were
disowned and forgotten. There is a great
modern German literature, but it lies buried
beneath the ruins."
But besides material for a tragedy it also
contains the makings of an epic, for the
most terrifying Odyssey of modern times
had, at almost every stage and station, its
poets and chroniclers who left a soul-
shattering record of their struggle to remain
human in a murderous world where death,
in Paul Celan's bitter line, had become "a
master craftsman from Germany"(fer
Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland. There
was, I am afraid, no satisfying moral con¬
clusion to this epic: as a test of human en¬
durance it was as meaningless as the trial of
Kafka's Joseph K. Significantly, one of its
first victims was the assassinated Existen¬
tialist Theodor Lessing, whose most in¬
teresting work, Geschichte als Sinngebung
des Sinnlosen, concerns the idea that the
writing of history is the art of conferring
meaning upon events that, in the very
nature of things, have no meaning. If one
searches for a meaning in the German-
Jewish tragedy there is, I fear, only one
lesson to be learned: thai in the never-
ending confrontation between the head and
the truncheon, the latter usually wins out, at
least in the short run. As the philosopher-
poet Salomo Friedländer, who called
himself Mynona (anonym spelled
backward), pointed out at the time, "Any
damned fool can put a bullet through the
most brilliant brain."
FREDERIC V. GRUNFELD, of the USA, is a
cultural historian and a contributing editor to
Connoisseur magazine. He is the author of
several books including Berlin, The Hitler File,
a social history of Nazism, and Prophets
Without Honour (McGraw-Hill, 1980) from
which this article is extracted. His Wayfarers
of the Thai Forest: the Akha (Time-Life Books,
7 982) is the first book ever on these hill people
from the Burma-Thai border region.
On 10 May 1933, a torchlight procession
of students, carefully orchestrated by
Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels,
wound its wayalong the Unter den Linden
to a square opposite the University of
Berlin where a huge pile of books had
been accumulated. Torches were set to
the pile and some twenty thousand books
went up in flames in the biggest auto-da-
fé of modern times. Among the authors
whose books were thus destroyed were
Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Lion
Feuchtwanger, Erich Maria Remarque,
Albert Einstein, Jack London, H.G. Wells,
Freud, Gide, Zola and Proust.
The Polish paediatrician, educator and
writer Janusz Korczak (1878-1942)
devoted most of his life to writing for and
about children and to work in child
welfare, notably as director of a Warsaw
orphanage for Jewish children where he
practised educational methods far ahead
of his time (see Unesco Courier, June
1 979). In October 1940 his orphanage was
transferred to the newly constructed War¬
saw ghetto. Two years later Korczak died
in the Treblinka extermination camp to
which he was deported with the orphans
whom he had refused to abandon
although he received several offers of
safety for himself. Unesco has published
a selection ofKorczak's works (in French)
as part of its literature translations pro¬
gramme. Below, Korczak with some of
the pupils of his Warsaw orphanage.

Strange hiding-place
An arms cache in the Lascaux grotto
by André Malraux
The text published right is an extract
from André Malraux's autobiogra¬
phical work Antimemoirs, published in
1967. In it the famous French writer
and politician (1901-1976) evokes his
experience as a member of the Resis¬
tance. Under the name "Colonel
Berger", Malraux was leader of the
maquis in the Lot-et-Garonne and Cor-
rèze départements of southwestern
France. After playing an active role in
the Resistance he fought in Alsace and
Germany as commander of the "Als¬
ace-Lorraine" brigade.

The underground press played an Impor¬
tant role in French resistance to the Nazi
occupying forces. As well as spreading
information, it denounced economic
pillage and the requisition of workers,
and revealed the exploits of patriots and
the harshness of Nazi repression. In 1943
2 million copies of some 1,000 under¬
groundjournals were being printed. After
the war a large number of new French
publications grew out of these clandes¬
tine news-sheets.
From its scattered beginnings, the
French resistance grew constantly in
range and organization between 1940 and
1944. The units which fought against the
occupying forces came from a wide spec¬
trum. At the beginning of 1944 they
became the Forces Françaises de
l'Intérieur (F.F.I.), whose action would be
co-ordinated with Allied operations. In
the great battle which expelled the Nazis
from France, General Eisenhowerreckon¬
ed that the F.F.I, and the Resistance were
worth 15 divisions. Right, in Brittany, two
members of the Resistance brief advanc¬
ing Allied soldiers after the Normandy
landings in June 1944.
AT the beginning of 1944, I had in¬
spected the hiding-places of all our
maquis for the first time. Some of
them contained the arms which were intend¬
ed for the volunteers who would join us
when the landing was announced. There are
numerous caves in Périgord, and we climb¬
ed the iron ladders placed there for pre-war
tourists to locate our hidden weapons in a
honeycomb of cavities like the boxes of a
Magdalenian theatre. But the biggest cave,
at Montignac, was underground, and the
cache a long way from the entrance. We
carried powerful torches, for night had
fallen, and anyone who got lost there was a
dead man. The passage became so narrow
that soon we could only advance sideways.
There was a right-angled turn, and on the
rock which seemed to bar our way a vast
drawing appeared. I took it for a guide-
mark made by one of our guides, and shone
my torch on it. It was a frieze of superim¬
posed bison.
At Font-de-Gaume, the prehistoric paint¬
ings were blurred. These bison, on the con¬
trary, were stamped in the rock like seals,
their sharpness all the more remarkable for
the fact that the walls were great smooth
stones, now rounded,, now hollowed out,
not like rocks but like organs. These
petrified entrails through which one had to
worm one's way, for the rock-fault did not
form chambers, seemed like the bowels of
the earth. The bison, if not now a guide-

mark, had perhaps been one some twenty
thousand years earlier. All subterranean
caverns arouse disquiet, since a sudden
caving-in could bury one alive there. Not
death, but entombment; and the bison gave
this tomb a mysterious soul, as if they had
risen up from the ageless earth to guide us.
Over our heads, perhaps, German patrols
were prowling; we were, advancing towards
our weapons; and the bison had been pranc¬
ing on the stone for two hundred centuries.
The crevice widened out and ramified. Our
torches did not illuminate these chasms:
their beams guided us through them as a
blind man is guided by his stick. We could
no longer distinguish the rock except by the
gleaming fragments of the walls which sur¬
rounded us. In each cleft, one's torch would
pick out another cleftreaching down into
the heart of the earth. This darkness had
nothing to do with the night; it belonged to
chasms as enclosed as the sky is open, suc¬
ceeding one another endlessly, and ever
more disquietingly because they appeared
to have been consciously fashioned. My
companions had ceased to talk except in
whispers. Then a passage so narrow as to be
encompassed by the haloes of our torches,
and in which we had to stoop, led to a
crevasse about a hundred feet long and thir¬
ty feet wide. The guides stopped, and all the
beams converged. On red and blue para¬
chutes spread out on the ground lay con¬
tainer after container. Suggestive of two
animals of some future era, a pair of
machine-guns on their tripods, like Egyp¬
tian cats on their forepaws, kept watch over
them. On the roof, clearly visible this time,
immense horned animals.
This place had undoubtedly been sacred,
and still was, not only because of the spirit
of the caverns but also because an inex¬
plicable bond united these bison, these
bulls, these horses (others receded beyond
the circle of light) and these containers
which seemed to have come here of their
own accord and which were guarded by
these machine-guns pointing at us. On the
vaults, covered in a kind of saltpetre, ran
sombre and magnificent beasts, carried
along by the movement of our beams of
light like a flight of heraldic emblems. The
man next to me lifted the lid of a container
full of ammunition, and the torch which he
put down cast an enormous shadow on the
roof. Doubtless the shadows of the bison-
hunters cast by the flame of their resin
torches had been the shadows of giants long
ago...
We went down by a knotted rope into a
fairly shallow pit, on the wall of which was
an elementary human form with a bird's
head. A pile of bazookas fell over with a
weird clang which faded into the shadows,
and the silence returned, more desolate and
more menacing than before.
As we went back, the rock here and there
suggested limbless animals, as old walls sug¬
gest human figures. And we emerged to find
the little trees on the hillside white with
frost, the River Vézère, the war-time
darkness over the dim hump of Montignac,
the stars, the transparency of the terrestrial
darkness.
"Are you interested in the paintings?"

Destroyed during the War, the National
Library of Serbia in Belgrade (above) was
reconstructed In 1974. In that year a
liaison committee between the Library
and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris
was created in order to encourage French
libraries to offer books to the newly-
rebuilt institution. One of those who
responded to the appeal was André
Malraux who in June 1975 presented to
the National Library the manuscript of his
book La Tête d'Obsidienne (see text
below).
"In the darkest hours of the last war-
after Warsaw, Rotterdam and
Dunkirk (...) Belgrade rose in
rebellion one Spring morning in 1941. It
and all its people chose liberty. (...) The
ensuing reprisals were a measure of the
rage caused by its refusal to submit.
From the earliest moments ofthe bomb¬
ing of the city, begun without a declara¬
tion ofwar, tens ofthousands ofhuman
beings were annihilated, and, with
them, the Library, an institution fun¬
damental to any national culture.
"In commemoration of these events I
have decided to donate my manuscript
to the National Library of Serbia, now
rebuilt. I see in the destiny of your
Library the destiny of a people for
whom culture andfreedom are one and
indivisible. Human dignity, which has
always cost your country dear, still in¬
spires its independence. "

The art of concealing art
Saving the treasures of the British Museum
by Harold Plenderleith
TO anyone who has not been caught
up in a major war or who may not
have been exposed to the possibility
of annihilation by aerial bombardment, the
problem of protecting inanimate objects
may seem straightforward, namely to bury
them in the ground or, at least, in a deep
cellar or "pill box", sheltered from the
possibility of a direct hit or exposure to
blast. This, however, is less than a half
truth, as the British Museum was to find out
when, in the course of the First World War
(1914-1918), London was suddenly
threatened by imminent bombing as part of
a Zeppelin attack.
A disused section of the Underground
Railway was hurriedly commissioned and
converted as a "safe deposit" for valuables
(with little foresight!) on the grounds that it
lay deep in the earth and at the same time
was conveniently near to the museum.
What the conditions were like there, no
one now knows, but when at the conclusion
of hostilities the collections came back to
the museum, they were found to be in such
a dreadful condition that the facilities
available for salvage and repair proved to
be inadequate. The solution was to establish
a chemical laboratory to investigate causes
of deterioration, to devise and supervise the
application of "safe" procedures for
restoration, and to publish the results. Such
was the origin of the British Museum
Research Laboratory.
The main cause of deterioration was not
far to seek. It arose from the sudden and
prolonged exposure of objects in a hostile
environment. Varying atmospheric condi¬
tions, temperatures and relative humid-
dities, inadequate or excessive ventilation
and polluted air had taken their toll, having
reacted differently upon objects according
to their structure and the materials of which
they were composed.
On 7 September 1940, Hermann Goering
launched the bombers of the Luftwaffe
against London in an attempt to break
British morale and will to resist by
destroying the capital. In the first two
nights some 850 civilians were killed and
2,350 wounded. The assault on London
and other cities, "the Blitz" as it was
popularly called, continued almost
without a break until May 1941. The bom¬
bing of London continued intermittently
throughout the war, intensifying during
1944 with the launching of the V1 and V2
pilotless planes and rockets. Right, Lon¬
don in 1941 during an air raid.

In some cases the objects contained the
seeds of their own destruction. Insect
parasites had attacked wood, paper, textiles
and leather, and affected books and
ethnographical material. Examples of stain¬
ed paper, drawings and watercolours were
common. Growths of micro-organisms oc¬
curred on leather and buckram bookbind¬
ings, as these provided a generous measure
of the required nutrients and proliferation
was encouraged by darkness and damp;
metallic corrosion was promoted by the
presence of water-soluble salts, especially
noticeable in the objects from the deserts of
Egypt and Mesopotamia.
In parallel with diagnosis and the earliest
experimental treatment of objects, the
laboratory instigated tests to study the
growths of micro-organisms under varying
conditions with a view to defining, if possi¬
ble, what might be regarded as a safe
museum climate.
As twenty years elapsed between the end
of the First World War and the outbreak of
the Second World War there was ample
time to devise measures for overcoming
hostile environments.
One thing was clear. There could be no
doubt that some of the most valuable of the
National Collections were in the heart of
London and located too near to target areas
for safety. A policy of decentralization was
therefore an urgent necessity and this in¬
volved endless visits of inspection to
localities far from the metropolis. In time a
short list of acceptable reception areas was
drawn up. The packing and loading in
museum basements presaged the long trek
by road or rail from the museum to these
destinations not by any means an easy
task in those days of severe transport
congestion.
The National Library of Wales in
Aberystwyth was chosen as the main
repository for the most valuable books and
manuscripts and it functioned admirably.
The National Gallery in London had its
own special requirements. Paintings are
essentially two-dimensional and easily
damaged by excessive man-handling and
are best hung on dry internal walls or
mobile hanging metal screens where they
can be easily inspected. Furniture, on the
other hand, requires floor room, duck-
boarding and racking, and smaller objects
of all kinds have to be accommodated in
dust-free boxes of easy access as this is
essential both for study and in the interests
of systematic inspection.
With the completion of the scheme there
was no doubt that much had been done to
avert a major disaster to the national
treasures, assuming that the museums in
London, and indeed anywhere else, would
never be regarded as targets for the
bombers. There came a sinister moment,
however, in 1940, when Coventry
Cathedral was destroyed by enemy bombs.
This heralded the advent of the so-called
Baedeker Raids, the name suggesting that
there might now be no limit to artistic
losses.
From then onwards, thoughts turned to
the desirability of establishing one great
central depository. But where? All the likely
sites had by this time been snapped up, and
it took a Mr. Winston Churchill (as he then
was) to solve our problem by offering an
underground limestone quarry in Wiltshire,
of enormous size, ideal in every respect save
that it had been at one time earmarked as a
mushroom farm and the relative humidity
inside was of the order of 98 per cent!
Following detailed discussion among the
various authorities concerned and tests by
engineers, who discovered a means of
waterproofing the walls, floors and ceil¬
ings, the quarry was gratefully accepted. A

plant-room was installed with equipment to
air-condition the repository and auxiliary
generators were at hand in case of
breakdown. The result was that within a
year we had the ideal underground museum
store with a constant atmosphere at 15°C
and 60 per cent relative humidity, well lit
from end to end and occupying a volume of
no less than 5,600 cubic metres. This was
enough to accommodate the greater part of
the already decentralized collections of the
British Museum as well as furniture, carpets
and other objects from the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London and smaller col¬
lections of the first importance from many
sources.
In the meantime the National Gallery had
been evacuated and its paintings
transported in adapted railway containers
from Trafalgar Square to a great slate
quarry near Blaenau Festiniog in Wales.
The Manod quarry, as it was called, had
high vaulted ceilings and a series of shelters
could be constructed within, each protected
by a powerful metal over-structure lest
there should be any falling debris from the
vaulted roof above. All was well, however,
save perhaps for the prevalent light-grey
slate dust. This was found to be neutral and
non-scratching and easily removed,
although at first it gave cause for misgiv¬
ings. These shelters provided 1,600 cubic
metres of storage volume.
The interesting discovery was made at
Manod that while the average temperature
was fairly constant, heating the air to 15°
reduced the relative humidity to 58 per cent,
a close approximation to optimum condi¬
tions, and it was thus much cheaper to
maintain conditioned air there than in the
British Museum Quarry in Wiltshire where
the freeze-drying process applied. They
even established a restorer's studio in the
Manod quarry where paintings could be
maintained in excellent condition: but less
and less treatment was found to be
necessary with the passage of time. The
behaviour of both painted panels and can¬
vases in this respect indicated the great ad¬
vantage of using conditioned air, at least, in
the preservation of paintings, and, as the
officer-in-charge at Manod commented,
"the pictures behaved admirably and gave
far less trouble in cracking and blistering
than had ever been the case at Trafalgar
Square." One good result has been the con¬
ditioning of the air in the National Gallery

buildings in Trafalgar Square in London,
now completed. It seems that despite the
complicated processes to which they had
been subjected there was no single case of
serious damage to paintings to be reported,
and the collection was eventually reinstated
in London in its entirety six and a quarter
years after the first load had left for Wales.
A similar survival claim can be made for
the collections from the British Museum
and the Victoria and Albert Museum.
As things happened, it was the British
Museum main buildings in London that
caused the greatest concern as these still
contained a large quantity of books.
Manifestly, it had been found impossible to
move some ten million books to safety: the
task was to extract from the shelves the
most valuable, and that task was for¬
midable enough. There remained, in fact,
almost the entire contents of the four steel
quadrant book-stacks and one of these suf¬
fered a direct hit from what seemed to be a
large oil bomb. This gave rise to a major fire
which could only be contained by profes¬
sional fire brigades, and many of these
came to our assistance from far and near.
As each quadrant was designed to con¬
tain a quarter of a million books, the loss
was great but, since then it has been largely
made up with the help of generous gifts
from all over the world and, not least, from
our former enemies.
If there is any important lesson to be
learnt, even from this short account of a
tragic period in museum history, it is to em¬
phasize the supreme importance of prepar¬
ing plans, in detail, well in advance of a
threatened catastrophe.

THE BLUE AND WHITE SHIELD
"Many wonders of the world have been
lost in war and strife; He who protects
and preserves has the happiest lot. "
Goethe
The path of devastation left in the wake
of World War II emphasized to an un¬
precedented degree the need for an in¬
ternational code for the safeguard of
works of art during wartime. A major step
forward in this direction was made on 14
May 1954 when the international Con¬
vention on the Protection of Cultural Pro¬
perty in the Event of Armed Conflict was
signed at a conference convened by
Unesco at the Hague (Netherlands). The
Convention, the emblem of which is a
blue and white shield, set up a kind of
cultural "Red Cross" under which works
of art, monuments and historic buildings
would be accorded the kind of protection
given to hospitals, ambulances and
medical personnel in time of war. As of
22 January 1985, 73 States had
deposited instruments of ratification or
accession to the Convention.
On the night of 17/18 September 1940,
the British Museum had a fortunate
escape when it was struck by a large
(1,000 kilos) high-explosive bomb which
failed to explode. The bomb penetrated
four concrete floors and ended up in the
basement. Had it exploded it would have
completely wrecked the building. Below,

Art under siege
The Hermitage Museum during the 900-day onslaught on Leningrad
by Boris Piotrovsky
A few days after Nazi Germany at¬
tacked the Soviet Union, it became
clear that an enemy army group
had launched an offensive against Len¬
ingrad, one of the USSR's most important
political, economic and cultural centres,
and the cradle of the October Revolution.
What could be done to evacuate the city's
population, moveable property, and above
all the treasures of the Hermitage, one of
the world's greatest museums?
Ten days after the outbreak of war, a
convoy set off eastwards for Sverdlovsk
with the most precious objects; it was
followed by a second convoy twenty days
later. In all, 1,118,000 art objects were
evacuated. Meanwhile, on the Museum
Leningrad, 1941. Sculptures from the
city's summer garden find a refuge.
premises in Leningrad much remained to be
done: the remaining collections had to be
stored in safety and precautions had to be
taken against fire. Empty frames hung from
the walls like gaping holes, sheets of
plywood were spread out on the floors and
covered with sand. Barrels of water for
fighting incendiary bombs were placed in all
the rooms.
Caught in the grip of a powerful
blockading force, Leningrad defended itself
for 900 days. It was subsequently learned
that the Nazi leaders intended, after the city
had been captured, to destroy it completely
by flooding as a place of "no political or
cultural value". Consequently their troops
were ordered to reject offers to surrender,
"if any such offer were to be made".
No such offer was made. Leningrad was
resolved not to surrender. In spite of the ex¬
treme rigours of the siege and the ferocity of
the artillery barrages and bombing to which
they were subjected, the people of Len
ingrad did more than resist; they fought for
victory with all their might.
For the population of the beleaguered
city, the worst hardship was starvation,
aggravated by the onset of cold and the
terrible shortage of heating fuel. In autumn
1941, factory workers were only getting 250
grammes of bread a day; for other
categories of the population the ration was
reduced to 125 grammes. A number of
substitute foods were developed thanks to
the ingenuity of the city's scientists. Never¬
theless, 640,000 persons died of starvation.
But hunger was not the only killer. The
besiegers dropped over 100,000 bombs and
fired over 150,000 shells on Leningrad, a
museum-city of major historical and
cultural importance. In shelters improvised
in the cellars of the Winter Palace and
the Hermitage more than 2,000 people
crammed together, including the museum
employees and their families, scientists,
painters and other artists.

The Hermitage was hit by two bombs
which caused minor damage. More serious
harm was done by accurate artillery fire: all
the windows were shattered, snow
penetrated into the rooms, and the
Museum's walls, roof and ceilings sustained
heavy damage. A shell hit the famous gate
of the New Hermitage.
In spite of everything and although eighty
museum workers died of hunger, the sur¬
vivors resolutely worked on, supported by
the whole population. Scientific works were
written, meetings were held, the great
cultural events of the peoples of the USSR
were commemorated. In October 1941, a
lecture was given in the icy rooms of the
Hermitage to mark the 800th anniversary of
the birth of the Azerbaidjani poet Nizami.
In December of the same year, in the depths
of the hardest winter, a lecture was given to
mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of
Navoi, the founder of Uzbek literature. The
poets Nikolai Tikhonov and Vsevolod Ro-
jdestvenski, wearing their uniforms, came
to spend a day's leave. In June 1942, the
first exhibition of works by Leningrad
painters depicting the defence of the city
was organized. Four such exhibitions were
held during the war, bringing to the people
of Leningrad some 6,000 paintings, draw¬
ings, sculptures and works of graphic art.
The cultural activities of Leningrad were
never interrupted.
Restoration work on the Museum began
even before the end of the war. In
November 1944, those works which had
never left the city were exhibited in three
renovated rooms. On 8 November 1945,
after the victory, sixty-nine exhibition
rooms were reopened for the objects which
had returned from evacuation.
BORIS PIOTROVSKY, Sower archaeologist
and orientalist, is director of the Hermitage
Museum, Leningrad. A member of the USSR
Academy of Sciences, he is the author of
many studies on the history and archaeology
of the Transcaucasus and the ancient East, for
which he was awarded the USSR State prize.
He was among the Soviet archaeologists who
took part in Unesco's campaign to save the
temples of Nubia.
During the 900-day blockade of Len¬
ingrad, almost 700,000 men, women and
children died of cold, hunger, bombing
and shelling. Entire families were wiped
out. One of them is described in a diary
kept by 1 1-year-old Tanya Savicheva, left.
Again and again she recorded yet another
death in her family (below). Tanya herself
was later evacuated from Leningrad, but
her body was weakened by hunger and
she died in 1943.

Can we save
civilization? by Yuri Kirshin
DURING 5,000 years of history,
mankind has ' experienced more
than 14,000 wars. The aims pur¬
sued through these wars were widely dif¬
ferent. States took up arms in order to en¬
force political or economic domination, to
plunder or exterminate peoples, or to speed
up or slow down the pace of other nations'
political, economic or spiritual develop¬
ment. Wars were widespread at the time of
the foundation of centralized States. The
waging and outcome of a war influenced
social processes; the aggressor could con¬
quer economic centres, sources of raw
materials and commercial outlets, impose
unequal terms of trade, and bring security
to its empire. Political authorities also often
turned to wars of conquest to solve their in¬
ternal problems and overcome their own
crises.
However, the kings, emperors or chiefs
of general staff who prepared their future
campaigns in the tranquillity of their head¬
quarters, or the politicians who were engag¬
ed in the clash of parliamentary debate, did
not fail to weigh the advantages and disad¬
vantages of a war. Would the State lose
more than it gained? Would the expense of
occupying the territory of another State be
justified? Might not the cost of such and
such a victory turn out to be too high?
Realistic politicians, considering a given ob¬
jective negligible compared with the efforts
required to achieve it, have often turned
their backs on war, and signed peace
treaties instead.
Today, a world war and, a fortiori, a
nuclear war can no longer constitute a.
political instrument. It would be madness to
pretend otherwise, because the only effec¬
tive riposte to a nuclear attack is a nuclear
counter-attack. Since the chances of re¬
stricting a nuclear attack are nil, the latter
would immediately spread to all the con¬
tinents and would convulse the entire
planet, compromising the very survival of
humanity. Thus, whatever its objective
military, political or economicnuclear ag¬
gression would be an absurdity.
In addition to these cold practical con¬
siderations, there is a highly important fac¬
tor which no politician should forget even
for a second: those who lose their lives in all
wars, great and small.
"A house has been hit. There are few vic¬
tims; one dead. Imagine that it is your child,
your wife or your father. Would you say
that there were few victims? This one victim
was perhaps your reason for living." In t
these few words, Serguei Obraztsov, an in¬
ternationally known Soviet man of the
theatre, sums up all the horrors of war.
The 14,000 wars have claimed four thou¬
sand million human lives. A third world
war, if nothing is done to prevent it, would
alone claim as many victims. In the past ar¬
my confronted army, soldiers fought
against other soldiers. But weapons have
become more and more lethal; innocent
populations are increasingly affected. Ten
million died in the First World War, almost
all of them soldiers. The Second World War
claimed 50 million human lives, and there
was one civilian victim for each soldier kill¬
ed at the front. A nuclear world war would
exterminate the whole of humanity.
If war spells the death of humanity,
preparation for war is like a serious illness
which gnaws at all the organs. In 1982,
world spending on arms amounted to over
650 thousand million dollars,; more than the
total income of one-third of humanity liv¬
ing in the fifty poorest countries. The 1982
Report of the Independent Commission on
Disarmament and Security issues, under the
chairmanship of Olof Palme of Sweden,
pointed out that a 10 per cent reduction in
arms expenditures by the nuclear powers
alone would make it possible at least to dou¬
ble aid to the thirty-one least developed
countries. The industrialized countries are
not the only ones caught up in the arms^
13

"When we speak of victory, we are speak¬
ing also ofsomething of the utmost impor¬
tance that is a fact of life todaycollab¬
oration between States with different social
systems and structures. Theforming of the
anti-Hitler coalition was very instructive. In
recognizing that they had to work together
to save their own people and, indeed, all
humanity, the statesmen of the time set
what has become a standard of wise and
responsible policy".

^ race: the developing countries, 90 per cent
of whose population live in the direst pover¬
ty, account for two-thirds of the volume of
the international arms trade. The 130 armed
conflicts which have occurred in the last
forty years, and which have been
characterized by a growing interna¬
tionalization, have taken place in these
countries.
Whereas there was only one point of ten¬
sion on the eve of the First World War
Europe and two on the eve of the
SecondEurope and the Far East, today
the world's trouble spots are proliferating
and each one of them could spark off a
world war.
Humanity today faces no more urgent
task than that of braking this dangerous
trend, of limiting and reducing arms, in a
word, of saving civilization. To banish the
spectre of world war is to provide resources
for solving all the other fundamental world
problems, notably those relating to food,
the environment, and energy. Only peace
and peaceful coexistence between States
with different social systems can really open
future perspectives to the inhabitants of our
planet.
In this context, the objectives of the
struggle for peace have acquired a new
dimension. The struggle for peace is now
the struggle for the continuance of the
human species.
Nuclear world war is not inevitable. The
time when an aggressor could decide at the
drop of a hat whether or not to spark off a
war is long since over. Nevertheless, the
preparations for nuclear war have gone
much too far. It will only be possible to
avoid such a war if we fully devote ourselves
to the defence of peace throughout the
world, and do all we can to safeguard
civilization. The defence of peace will be
truly world-wide if all peoples, whatever
their socio-economic system, devote
themselves to it with the means at their
disposal.
Some countries have not known peace for
generations. Children are born while bombs
fall, learn to read and write in shelters; peo¬
ple move around with their rifles, eyes fixed
on the skies where enemy aircraft may ap
pear at any moment. All these people know
of peace is what their elders have told them
about it. During this time in Europe, for the
first time in our history, a second genera¬
tion is growing up which only knows about
war from books and films. If for forty years
the world has not been devastated by a
general conflagration, the merit must large¬
ly go to the United Nations, which was
created precisely to maintain peace,
strengthen security, and promote co¬
operation between peoples. But at the pre¬
sent time the United Nations and Unesco
must multiply their efforts in this field. For
if humanity is incapable of defending peace
today, there will be no one left tomorrow to
talk of it to coming generations, even sup¬
posing, and it is an unlikely supposition,
that such generations will be born.

and peace, a subject on which he has publish¬

raged from 17 July 1942 to 2 February
1943. A turning point was reached on 23
November 1942, when two Soviet attack¬
ing groups joined up near Kalach to com¬
plete the encirclement of some 330,000

"There werefive of us in the family home,
fresh out of school. What should we do?
The decision was unanimous. We would not
bend the knee, we would prepare to fight.
So every morning we went secretly to the
scenes of recent battles to collect weapons.
Soon we had amassed enough weapons to
arm an entire detachment. Graduallyyoung
men from neighbouring villages joined our
group which became the nucleus of a par¬
tisan unit. We had to face many problems.
Most of us knew nothing about handling
weapons. Furthermore, winter was ap¬
proaching. We had to dig rough sheltersfor
ourselves in theforest. Each day was a new
ordeal and we often went two days at a time
without food. After long marches in the

The forgotten resistance
The story of resistance to Hitler within Nazi Germany has been
largely forgotten. For most people internal German resistance
was limited to the unsuccessful bomb plot of 20 July 1944. Yet
by 1937 opposition to Hitler was beginning to build up even
among those who had at first supported him. Among the first
resisters were such men as Carl Goerdeler, the mayor of Leipzig,
who broke with the Nazis in 1936 over their anti-semitism, and
Ulrich von Hassell, former German ambassador in Rome whp left
the diplomatic service early In 1938.
As William Shirer writes in his history of Nazi Germany, The
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich:
"There were others, lesser known and mostly younger, who
had opposed the Nazis from the beginning and who gradually
came together to form various resistance circles. One of the
leading intellects of one group was Ewald von Kleist, a
gentleman farmer and a descendant of the greatpoet. He worked
closely with Ernst Niekisch, a former Social Democrat and editor
of Widerstand (Resistance), and with Fabian von Schlabrendorff,
a young lawyer (...) There were former trade-union leaders such
as Julius Leber, Jakob Kaiser and Wilhelm Leuschner. Two
Gestapo officials, Artur Nebe, the head of the criminalpolice, and
Bernd Gisevius, a young career police officer, became valuable
aides as the conspiracies developed (...)"
Other well known opponents of the Nazi regime included
Count Helmuth von Moltke, who later formed the "Kreisau Cir¬
cle" resistance group, Count Albrecht Bernstorff, Freiherr Karl
Ludwig von Guttenberg, editor of a Catholic monthly, and the
eminent Protestant clergyman Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
The first important military recruit to the resistance was no less
a person than the Chief of the Army General Staff, General Lud¬
wig Beck. On 18 August 1938, unable to persuade Hitler to give
up his plans for action against Czechoslovakia, which he believ
ed would lead to a general war in Europe, he resigned as Chief
of the General Staff but continued to work with the resistance.
Other high-ranking officers were won over, including Genera!
Erwin von Witzleben, commander of the Berlin military district,
General Franz Haider, who had replaced Beck as Chief of Staff,
General Count Erich von Brockdorff-Ahlefeld, commander of the
Potsdam garrison, and General Erich Hoepner, commander of
an armoured division. The conspirators planned to seize Hitler as
soon as he gave the final order to attack Czechoslovakia. The
plot collapsed when news came through of the signing of the
Munich agreement on 29 September.
The resisters did not give up. By 1941 many more top German
officers, among them notably General Henning von Tresckow,
had become disillusioned with Hitler. Plans were made to arrest
Hitler but these were thwarted by the Fuehrer's tight security ar¬
rangements. Assassination seemed to offer the only solution.
In 1943, von Tresckow organized a number of assassination
attempts. On 13 March, a bomb disguised as two bottles of
brandy was placed on the aircraft taking Hitler back to Germany
from a conference in Smolensk, but the detonator failed to fire.
Following this setback, Colonel Freiherr von Gersdorff
courageously volunteered to undertake a suicide mission. With
two bombs with ten-minute fuses concealed in his greatcoat he
went to a Heroes Memorial Ceremony held on 21 March attended
by Hitler, Goering and Himmler. His plan was to stay as close to
Hitler as possible and to blow up both the Fuehrer and himself.
Hitler was scheduled to spend half an hour at the ceremony, but
he left after only eight minutes. A number of other suicide bomb
attempts were made later but all of them were thwarted, in¬
cluding a first attempt, on 26 December 1943, by Klaus Philip
Schenk, Count von Stauffenberg.

Losses
in World War II
Von Stauffenberg'was to be the hero of the famous, and almost
successful, bomb plot of July 1 944. Although by then the war was
clearly lost, the plotters were inspired to go ahead with this last
desperate attempt by a stirring message from General von
Tresckow:
"We must prove to the world and to future generations that the
men of the German Resistance Movement dared to take the
decisive step and to hazard their lives upon it. Compared with
this objective, nothing else matters. "
As all the world now knows, the attempt failed by a
hairsbreadth. Hitler's riposte was swift and devastating. Some
7,000 arrests were made and 4,980 victims met horrific deaths
to slake the Fuehrer's thirst for vengeance.
Many others committed suicide rather than face the horrors of
trial and execution by the "People's Court". Among them was
General Henning von Tresckow. The day after the failure of the
bomb plot he drove away from his headquarters on the Eastern
front and blew himself up with a hand grenade. His last words to
his aides constitute a fitting epitaph to all those Germans who
died resisting the inhuman Nazi machine:
"Now they will fall upon us and cover us with abuse. But I am
convinced, now as much as ever, that we have done the right
thing. I believe Hitler to be the arch-enemy, not only of Germany,
but indeed of the entire world. In a few hours time I shall stand
before God and answer for both my actions and the things I
neglected to do. I think I can with a clear conscience stand by all
I have done in the battle against Hitler. A man's moral worth is
established only at the point where he is prepared to give his life
for his convictions. "
"The work of a thousand years is nothing but rubble".
This was how Carl Goerdeler described the bombed areas of
western Germany in a letter to Field-Marshal von Kluge in July
1943 in which the former mayor of Leipzig begged the Field-
Marshal to join the German resistance in its efforts to eliminate
Hitler. Photos show the ruins of the Reichstag building, Berlin
(below), devastated Dresden (far left) and Hamburg (centre).

Estimates of total losses during
the Second World War, vary bet¬
ween 40 and 50 million dead.
Whereas the dead of the War of
1914-1918 (in which 68 million
men were mobilized) were for
the most part members of the
armed forces, the dead of the
1939-1945 War consisted of
almost equal numbers of
civilians and military personnel
(92 million men mobilized). This
high proportion of civilian vic¬
tims was due to a number of
special characteristics of the last
War, including the widespread
introduction of aerial bombard¬
ment but, above all, the physical
liquidation (in gas chambers,
massacres, etc.) by the Nazis of
several million Jews (about 6
million?) and of Soviet prisoners
of war, famine, partisan strug¬
gles, reprisals, etc. Among
countries which suffered most
from such atrocities, on the
basis of estimates which clearly
can only be approximate, Poland
comes first with 5.8 million dead
(of whom only 300,000 were
military personnel), or 15 per
cent of total population, follow¬
ed by the USSR with about 20
million dead (including 7 million?
civilians), or 10 per cent of total
population, and Yugoslavia with
1 .5 million dead (of whom 75 per
cent were civilians).
The USA lost 300,000 dead, all
military personnel; the United
Kingdom lost 326,000 military
personnel and 62,000 civilians;
France lost 205,000 military per¬
sonnel and 400,000 civilians (in¬
cluding 180,000 deportees); Italy
lost 310,000 dead, half of whom
were civilians; Germany lost 4.4
million military personnel (in¬
cluding Austrians), 3.5 million of
them on the Soviet front, and
about 500,000 civilians.
To these losses must be added
those of Belgium (88,000),
Bulgaria (20,000), Canada
(41,000), Finland (90,000),
Greece (160,000 including
20,000 military personnel),
Hungary (about 430,000), New
Zealand (12,000), The Nether¬
lands (about 210,000), and
Romania (about 460,000). In
Asia, China lost some 6 to 8
million dead and Japan 3 million
(including 600,000 civilians,
150,000 of whom died at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki). The
figures for other countries oc¬
cupied by Japan, as well as for
India, where famine was the ma¬
jor killer, are not known.

In 1940 some 400,000 Jews were
herded into the Warsaw Ghetto, an
overcrowded section of the city seal¬
ed off behind a high wall. By the
Spring of 1943 only about 60,000
were left; the rest had died of star¬
vation or been transported to exter¬
mination camps. On 19 April an
uprising broke out in the Ghetto. It
was crushed by the Nazis after a
month's heroic struggle, and the
Ghetto was completely destroyed.
There were few survivors.
Two days after the aerial attack on
Pearl Harbour, on 7 December
1941, Japanese forces landed in the
Philippines and by May 1942 con¬
trolled the entire territory. United
States forces returned to the Philip¬

not until February 1945 that all
resistance was overcome. Photo,

line established in 1944 to block the
Allied advance on Rome. In the
course of four months bitter
fighting the monastery was com¬
pletely destroyed. After the war it
was re-built to the plans of its
predecessor. The library, archives
and some paintings were saved as
were the famous bronze doors

No place to hide. An anxious

his troops against three neutral
States, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Luxembourg, on 10 May 1940.
Four days later, overwhelmed by
the suddenness and the ferocity of
the attack and faced with the threat
that Rotterdam and Utrecht would
be bombed mercilessly if resistance
continued, the Netherlands
Government had little choice but to
capitulate. Within a week, despite
heroic resistance, Belgium loo was
overrun and, on 27 May 1940, the
Belgians were obliged to ask for an
armistice. Underground resistance
to the Nazis continued in the
Netherlands and Belgium through¬
out the war, and many men from
both countries escaped to England
to join the Allied forces.

The indiscriminate bombing of
Chinese cities, which began in
earnest in May 1939, was an appall¬
ing feature of the long war between
China and Japan that lasted from
1931 to 1945. One of the main
targets was Chungking (photo), to
which the Chinese Government had
transferred in 1937. Chinese losses
during the War have been estimated
at between 6 and 8 million.

marked one of the turning points of
the war. Allied forces entered Tunis
and Bizerta early on 7 May 1943 and
all resistance in Africa ceased five
days later. Over a quarter of a
million prisoners were captured
along with huge quantities of arms
and other war materials.

the face of fierce resistance and by
nightfall 156,000 men had come
ashore. Within days the bridgehead
was firmly established and the final
stage in the overthrow of Hitler's
Third Reich had begun.

Directly in front of us stood an
enormous ship, and the GIs [US

A road cleared amidst the devastation of Hiroshima.



A time-table for peace
by the Venerable Gyotsu N. Sato
MOST Japanese over sixty today
remember the Second World
War with great bitterness.
They remember the agonizing loss of
life of their families and other loved ones.
They remember with no less regret,
although without the same inner suffering,
the loss of their precious possessions and
livelihoods as well as the destruction of
the all-encompassing texture of their
cultural values.
The vast potential for death, destruction
and evil inherent in war, either in the form
of sudden slaughter or of protracted suf¬
fering on a massive scale, has grown in
the past four decades until the total denial
of life-sustaining social and environmen¬
tal systems is now possible, including the
ultimate disruption of the environment on
a global scale.
To some extent this was perceived by
wise observers forty years ago, but today
it is a nightmare experienced by
everyone.
On this bridge at Hiroshima a passerby
left a white "atomic shadow" on the
pavement which his or her body had
screened from nuclear radiation. It is
estimated that 60 per cent of the deaths at
Hiroshima were caused by thermal rays
and fire, 20 per cent were due to injuries
caused by the blast, and 20 per cent to
physical disorders caused by radiation.
The war's far-reaching destruction both
of mind and matter, and its after-effects
which went far beyond those of previous
wars, enable us to envisage for the future
a vast, comprehensive human suffering
reaching its ultimate dimension.
In view of the immensity of the scourges
of war, we, the people of the United Na¬
tions, developed a common conception of
a time when international security should
no longer be sought in the accumulation
of armaments, through the doctrine of
alignment and strategic superiority, or
through a precarious balance of deter¬
rence, but in disarmament. This concep¬
tion has been transformed into a historic

human consensus set forth in the Final
Document of the United Nations Special
Session on Disarmament, 1978.
We Japanese are unable to forget even
for a moment the results of a hurried war¬
time experiment in societal destruction
wreaked on two medium-sized cities,
each with a population of 400,000,
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One reason why
the experiments were performed was to
compare the results of different fissile
matters: Hiroshima was destroyed with a
bomb whose fissile material was uranium
equivalent to 12.5 kilotonnes of TNT,
Nagasaki by 25 kilotonnes of TNT
equivalent of plutonium.
It has been calculated that 1 50,000 died
at Hiroshima, and 75,000 at Nagasaki
within six months of the bombs being
dropped. Even today there are scientists
who claim that less casualties were caus¬
ed by the effects of radiation than was
once believed. They have tried and are
still trying to lay more emphasis on blast
effects than on the effects of radiation, at
a time when Japan's Hibakusha, the
atom-bomb survivors, are engaged in the
final stages of a struggle for a State
Reparation Law, before the last witnesses
have disappeared.
There must be renewed efforts on the
part of all the world's nation-States,
whether or not they are members of the
United Nations, to reconfirm the agreed
Principles of Disarmament unanimously
adopted in the First Special Session on
Disarmament in 1978. There must be

disarmament negotiations and a time¬
table leading to General and Complete
Disarmament, with nuclear disarmament
being given the highest level of priority.
Our fellow Buddhists, under the
guidance of the late Sage the Most
Venerable Nichidatsu Fujii, have travelled
all round the world in a World Peace
March. In support of a Time-Limited Com¬
prehensive Disarmament Programme,
they travelled over five continents via five
routes, starting from the venue of the
World Assembly of Religious Workers for
General and Nuclear Disarmament held
in Tokyo in April 1981, and ending at the
Second Special Session on Disarmament
held in New York in June and July 1982.
How can the disarmament time-table be
arranged? How should we bind the
behaviour of all States? Here I should like
to plead that all nation-States should now
agree to the Comprehensive Disarma¬
ment Programme and complete their im¬
plementation of it by the end of this cen¬
tury at the latest. They should, first of all,
Declare the use of nuclear weapons il¬
legal, under any circumstances,
Defuse and abandon on a prorata basis
all nuclear war-heads ¡n all carriers and in
all arsenals,
Stop production of nuclear fissile
material for military purposes,
Stop nuclear explosions at once either
for military or "peaceful" purposes,
Stop immediately extra-territorial
deployment of nuclear-related weapon
systems.
This reiteration of the historic consen¬
sus is imperative if this generation of ours,
which is responsible for having created
the interacting postures for fighting
nuclear war on each side of the con¬
fronting blocs, is not to unleash a nuclear
war.
Let us all demand not only the powerful
nuclear super-States but all States around
the world, to co-operate in the formulation
of the Comprehensive Disarmament Pro¬
gramme accompanied by the binding
time-table mentioned above, and then let
us see!

'Emancipation
for men and for peoples'
"The Second World War put to a severe test not only coun¬
tries andpeoples, but also, in a sense, the whole system of in¬
ternational relations. Fascist aggression endangered the very
existence of races, States and nations. And so the war against
fascism was not confined to the field of military operations
and, with the achievement ofvictory, led to the revision ofin¬
ternational relations based on force, colonialism, inequality
and the servitude of men and peoples. The ensuing changes,
of which the anti-colonial, revolution is perhaps the most
significant, emanatedfrom the world's new awareness, of its
refusal to live in future as it had before the conflict.
"The creation of the United Nations would bring new
possibilities of emancipation for men and for peoples...
"The struggle for liberation which the Yugoslav nations and
nationalities waged during the war against fascism has one
particular aspect ofwjiicfi thepeople ofmy country are rightly
proud. It was both a fight for"liberation against fascism and
an act ofself-determination on thepart ofour nations and na¬
tionalities. These were determined to create a new community,
to establish between themselves relationships of a new type,
and to set up a new social system. Under this new system the
fundamental law of the country would enshrine, firstly, the
right ofeach nation and nationality to itsfull identity, and to
political, economic and culturalfulfilment; and secondly, the
right of everyone not only to enjoy individual liberty but to
participate effectively, on an equal footing, in the self-
managed determination of the destinies of a community of
liberated men and peoples".
Kole Casule
(Yugoslav writer)
A broadening of the trend towards
decolonization was one of the major
results of the Second World War. A spirit of
resistance had grown in countries oc¬
cupied by the fascist powers, and this fer¬
ment was echoed in other colonies where
the call for independence was voiced by
increasing numbers. One important
milestone in the anti-colonial movement
was the Asian-African Conference held at
Bandung (Indonesia) in April 1955. It was
attended by delegates from 29 countries
representing over half the world's popula¬
tion. The Chinese Prime Minister Chou En
tai, below right, played a leading role at the
Conference, which was organized by In¬
donesia, Burma, Ceylon, India, and

Unesco was set up immediately after
World War II to contribute to international
peace and security by promoting interna¬
tional co-operation in education, science
and culture. When its Constitution was
adopted in London on 16 November 1945
it bore the signatures of delegates
representing countries from every conti¬
nent. Below left, the cover of the Con¬
stitution, featuring a photo of St Paul's
Cathedral during the Blitz. A Preparatory
Commission was established to draw up a
plan for the future programme of the
Organization. The Constitution came into
force on 4 November 1946 when it had
been accepted by 20 countries. Left, a
meeting, in February 1946, of the Com¬
mission's Sub-Committee on the Educa¬
tional, Scientific and Cultural Needs of
Devastated Areas. Below, the Preamble
to Unesco's Constitution.
The Governments of the States Parties to this
Constitution on behalf of their peoples
declare:
That since wars begin in the minds of men, it
is in the minds of men that the defences of
peace must be constructed;
That ignorance ofeach other's ways and lives
has been a common cause, throughout the
history of mankind, of that suspicion and
mistrust between the peoples of the world
through which their differences have all too
often broken into war;
That the great and terrible war which has now
ended was a war made possible by the denial
of the democratic principles of the dignity,
equality and mutual respect of men, and by
the propagation, in their place, through ig¬
norance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the
inequality of men and races;
That the wide diffusion of culture, and the
education of humanity for justice and liberty
and peace are indispensable to the dignity of
man and constitute a sacred duty which all the
nations must fulfil in a spirit of mutual
assistance and concern;
That a peace based exclusively upon the
political and economic arrangements of
governments would not be a peace which
could secure the unanimous, lasting and
sincere support of the peoples of the world,
and that thepeace must therefore befounded,
if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and
moral solidarity of mankind.
For these reasons, the States Parties to this
Constitution, believing in full and equal op¬
portunities for education for all, in the
unrestricted pursuit of objective truth, and in
thefree exchange of ideas and knowledge, are
agreed and determined to develop and to in¬
crease the means of communications between
their peoples and to employ these means for
the purposes of mutual understanding and a
truer and more perfect knowledge of each
other's lives;
In consequence whereof they do hereby create
the United Natipns Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization for the purpose of
advancing, through the educational and scien¬
tific and cultural relations ofthepeoples ofthe
world, the objectives of international peace
and of the common welfare of mankind for
which the United Nations Organization was
established and which its Charter proclaims.

A new hope in the nuclear age
by Lewis Thomas
TWO years ago, I felt in my bones, as
a dead certainty, that we were in for
World War III, and that it would be
fought with thermonuclear weapons. I had
no idea when it would come, or how, but I
was sure that it would come, sooner or
later.
I thought we were well along in the same
sequence of prewar years that had occurred
in the decade just before World War I,
when international folly suddenly exploded
to everyone's astonishment, with no one
realizing at the time how it had happened or
what was to come. Or in the same series of
blundering, feckless years before the slower
explosion of World War II. I could see no
differences in the public behaviour of
statesmen and diplomats, or in the steady
blind build-up of arms, or in the tone of in¬
ternational rancour.
Two years ago, my highest hope was that
I wouldn't live to see it.
I thought that every reason for abandon¬
ing nuclear weapons had been discussed
often enough and publicly enough.
Everyone knew the necessary numbers.
They were easy to remember once you'd
read them, strung together in those
analytical studies, the worst-case numbers:
1 . 1 billion human beings killed outright in
any full-scale exchange of nuclear bombs
between the superpowers and their allies.
And another 1.1 billion dying in the after¬
math a few weeks later. All told, 2.2 billion
abrupt deaths, approximately one-half of
the human species, most of them in the
United States, Europe, the Soviet Union,
China and Japan. Most hospitals gone,
most doctors gone, and, even if not gone,
left with nothing whatever to be done for
the kinds of injury to be expected under
such weapons.
And yet, all the evidence seemed to prove
that we were getting ready for just such a
war.
Everyone has always said, of course, that
they will never be used. They are not even
intended to be used. They are here in order
to prevent the other side from using them
against us. They are symbols of strength, of
will, even'patriotism, and that is all. And
recently we have been hearing a new kind of
reassurance about them. Do not worry, the
technical people are saying, science will
soon be making them safe. The missiles that
carry them are being- equipped with ar¬
tificial intelligence, computers carrying
detailed maps of the underlying targets on
the other side of the earth, with guidance
systems enabling them to explode within a
few yards of an enemy's commanding
general. The bombs are getting smaller,
neater, less destructive because of these
gifts from science. We can have wars the
old-fashioned way, delicate and precise, as
romantic as medieval swordplay. Do not
worry about evaporated cities, they say. But
then the people who talk this way always
add in a lower voice, "but we must keep
some of the big ones on hand, just in case
something goes wrong." More technology
will save us.
I have never heard of a war in which
things did not go wrong, most of the time as
incalculably wrong as possible. I would ex¬
pect, as something close to a certainty, that
any use of thermonuclear bombs by any na¬
tion would sooner or later be followed by
full use, by everyone, in an atmosphere of
total confusion and total fury.
The truth of the matter is that there exists
an important and influential body of people
with excellent minds and good public man¬
ners who wish mightily to preserve nuclear
weaponry, and to improve it to the ultimate
aim of unqualified military superiority. I
am certain that views like this are held by
many in places of authority throughout the
world. It is not true that everyone agrees on
arms control and eventual arms reduction,
even though everyone asserts this ambition
in public.
The present situation goes against the
grain, beyond comprehending. We are, I
suspect, the most fundamentally,
biologically, compulsively social creatures
on the planet. As individuals, we spend
most of our waking hours at this: we nod at
each other, make endless small-talk, keep at
each other from dawn to dawn, make
friends wherever we can. We begin smiling
at other people in our earliest infancy, hop¬
ing for a smile back, and the hope never dies
even when, as happens in some unlucky
lives, it never does happen. We cannot get
along without each other, and when we try
to do this it takes the fun out of living. No
doubt about it, we are a sociable social
species.
What we need right now is more common
sense, and collective common sense at that.
Most of all, we need a new set of reasons for
giving up nuclear weapons.
I think we have one, and that is why I feel
differently from my despair of two years
ago, with some hope for the future. Not
much, just some, and qualified hope at
that, but these days I'll take any hope I can
get.
The two circles superimposed on this
photo of a nuclear test explosion il¬
lustrate dramatically the enormous in¬
crease In explosive power of the arsenals
of the world that has occurred since the
end of World War II. If the small circle
represents all the explosives used during
World War II, the large circle would repre¬
sent the size of present-day nuclear
arsenals; present stockpiles of nuclear
weapons are estimated at 20,000
megatons (one megaton is equivalent to
one million tons of TNT) four times the
threshold level that scientists believe
would be enough, if nuclear war were to
be launched, to trigger the onset of
nuclear winter and the certain annihila¬
tion of the human race. To give an idea of
the qualitative change that has occurred
in destructive potential it need only be
pointed out that a single thermonuclear
bomb can have an explosive power
greater than that of all explosives used in
all wars since gunpowder was invented.
Paradoxically, the reason for optimism is
the scientific discovery, first bumped into
about 3 years ago, that nuclear weapons are
much worse, immeasurably worse, than
anyone had previously guessed. It is the
nuclear winter scenario (see article page 26)
that gives me hope.
This is the heart of the matter. If the
scenario is as probable as it now seems, but
even if it is only a possible one, it means that
no single country will ever be able to fire
enough bombs at another country, in quan¬
tities sufficient to be of decisive military
significance, without risking its own
destruction in the process, even if there is no
return fire. The weapons have turned out to
be not just homicidal and genocidal. The
wonderful thing about them, which changes
everything for the future of arms control
and arms limitation negotiations, is that
they are suicidal.
The way it works is embarrassingly sim¬
ple, so simple that no one understands why
it was not thought of until we were 35 years
into the nuclear age. It is smdke that does it.
The only way to avoid the catastrophe
would be to avoid setting fires, especially
fires in cities. But this is what nuclear
bombs are designed to do, what they are
good at. If you can imagine a nuclear war in
which cities and forests are scrupulously
avoided, and submarine ports, munitions
factories, oil and gas fields and refineries,
railroads and military headquarters are left
alone, and nothing is aimed at except other
bombs in very remote silos, or other
generals standing alone in open fields, then
24

you can imagine a nuclear war without the
risk of nuclear winter, but you would have
to imagine that such a war would begin and
then end in that way, without involving
cities. Given the record of other wars in this
century, I find it hard to imagine such
ascetic, aseptic restraint on the part of any
nation, especially any nation on the verge of
defeat. If there is ever to be a nuclear war,
the cities will be targets. Except for one
thing: the country that fires off enough
bombs to bring the other country to its
knees will have a few days to celebrate, and
will then find itself under the same black
cloud, frozen solid along with all the other
non-combatant bystander countries.
I have been astonished that the press and
television news programmes have thus far
paid so little attention to this scenario. It
ought to have been a running front-page
story from the outset, and it should still be
on the front pages.
If the predictions are correct, or
anywhere near correct, the revelation of
nuclear winter will come to rank, I believe,
as one of the great scientific achievements
of this century maybe, considering what is
at stake, the most influential of any cen¬
tury. The explosives simply cannot be used
as military weapons, and that, I believe and
pray, is that.
That is the substance of my "hope in the
nuclear age". It is not just a hope for
human beings, and for our children and
their grandchildren and theirs and theirs. It
is a hope for the earth.

Nuclear winter
The world-wide consequences of nuclear war
by
Carl Sagan
Vladimir Alexandrov
Paul Ehrlich
Alexander Pavlov
We present below extracts from the abridged transcript of a forum on the
worldwide consequences of nuclear war, held in Washington, D.C., on 8
December 1983, under the chairmanship of United States Senators Edward
Kennedy and Mark Hatfield and sponsored by the Nuclear Freeze Founda¬
tion. The main speakers at the Forum were four United States and four
Soviet scientists; Carl Sagan, Vladimir V. Alexandrov, Paul Ehrlich, Alex¬
ander S. Pavlov, Jack Geiger, Sergei Kapitza, Lewis Thomas and Yevgeny
P. Velikhov. The transcripts werefirstpublished in Disarmament, aperiodic
review by the United Nations.
DR. CARL SAGAN, Director of the Laboratory for Planetary
Studies at Cornell University:
The work I am about to describe has been done with four scientific
co-workersRichard Turco, Brian Toon, Thomas Ackerman and
James Pollack, besides myself. From the initials of the authors, this
has been called the TTAPS Study.
What we have attempted to do is to calculate, for a wide range
of possible nuclear-war scenarios, what the global climatic con¬
sequences will be.
To begin, I should like to describe our baseline case, which is a
nuclear war in which 5,000 megatons are exploded. This is between
one third and one half of the joint strategic arsenals of the Soviet
Union and the United States, and is by no means the worst nuclear
war that could be imagined.
The results that I am to describe have been discussed in a special
meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in April 1983 by 100
specialists in this field. Confirmatory studies have been performed
by some eight or ten other groups worldwide, including two such
studies in the Soviet Union. There have been other studies in the
Federal Republic of Germany, in Australia and in this country, at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, at the Lawrence
Livermore Weapons Laboratory and elsewhere. There is a major
study starting up at Los Alamos.
What I am describing is by no means just the conclusion of our
group, because the results of all the groups I have mentioned are
more or less the same.
I want to stress that there are differences on points of detail. We
can differ, for example, on what scenarios are more likely. But as
I will mention in a moment, the consequences seem surprisingly in¬
dependent of the kind of war waged, above a certain expenditure
of megatons.
And I do not for a moment want to suggest that there is no more
work to be done on this subject. There is a great deal more work
that needs to be done. The results I am describing are from what
is called a one-dimensional model in which the fine particles are free
to move up and down according to the laws of physics, but the
spreading in latitude and longitude is not by any means done
precisely.
Dr. Alexandrov will describe the first Soviet three-dimensional
model in which there is an attempt to describe the spreading quan¬
titatively in latitude and longitude. His results are quite similar in
general to those at the National Center of Atmospheric Research.
Here again, there seems to be a good convergence of results.
So now, let us consider the 5,000-megaton baseline case that I
described before; this is a case in which both cities and hard targets
like missile silos are targeted, so that there would be both soot and
fine dust produced.
The immediate consequences of such a war which would
presumably be fought in the northern mid-latitudes is that, in the
target zone, the obscuration of the sun by soot and dust would
make it pitch black. As the fine particles spread, initially in
longitude and then in latitude, things get brighter, but it appears
that the average in northern mid-latitudes would be about one per
cent of the ordinary sunlight on a clear day. And, as Dr. Ehrlich will
describe in greater detail, this by itself is already extremely
dangerous for plant photosynthesis. Many varieties of plants
throughout the northern hemisphere (and, as I will mention, in the
southern hemisphere as well) are in deep trouble when, to this ex¬
tent, the sun has been turned off. And this turning off is for a
significant period of time, probably a few monthspossibly much
longer.
Because the amount of sunlight reaching the surface of Earth
would now be so much less, and because it is sunlight that heats the
surface of Earth, it gets cold, and, for the baseline case, the
temperature decline is substantial; in our calculations to something
like -23°C, roughly - 10°F. These are average continental
temperatures in the northern hemisphere, far from coastlines. (The
severity would be moderated somewhat by the oceans, which act as
reservoirs of heat). And that means that many exposed plants,
animals and humans would freeze to death.
26

In addition, you know how in the burning of skyscrapers, say,
most casualties come not from the fire itself, but from toxic gases
produced by the conflagration of synthetics, insulation, drapes and
so on. In the' burning of large cities, there would be a great deal of
that, and so there is an additional thing to worry about, the produc¬
tion of a toxic smog that would persist at ground level for substan¬
tial periods of time.
Now, the fine particles that block the sunlight also carry radioac¬
tivity, and since we have tracked the motion of these fine particles,
we have in effect also tracked the intermediate time-scale radioac¬
tive fall-out. Almost all previous studies assumed that all the
radioactivity not promptly deposited on the ground went into the
stratosphere, taking a long time to fall out, by which time much of
the radioactivity had decayed. In contrast, we find that for a
reasonable mix of yields, there are many fine particles put into the
lower atmosphere (or troposphere) that fall out faster. The in¬
termediate time-scale fall-out doses are considerably larger, about
10 times more, than has been generally thought in the past.
To give some idea of these numbers, for the baseline case,
something like 30 per cent of northern mid-latitude land areas
would receive a dose (in the fall-out patterns that go downwind of
targets) of something like 250 rads, that is, approaching the mean
lethal dose for unprotected human beings. The intermediate time-
scale dose of radioactivity far from targets turns out to be
something like 50 to 100 rads all over the northern hemisphere. At
this dose, the human immune system our capacity to resist
disease begins to become compromised. This intermediate time-
scale dose represents a much more serious radiation burden than
has been described in the past.
After the soot and dust fall out, the sunlight gets down to the sur¬
face, and things warm up again. This is many months latersay,
six to nine months later, although it may be much longer when
conditions may return to their normal values. But there is an addi¬
tional negative effect: the ozone layer has been disrupted by the
high-yield explosions, and so now considerably more ultraviolet
light is penetrating to the surface of Earth, several times the amount
27

Urban dislocation
Within a week after a war, the amount of sunlight
at ground level could be reduced to just a few per
cent of normal. Urban survivors would face ex¬
treme cold, water shortages, lack of food and fuel
and serious radiation, pollution and disease pro¬
blems. They would probably attempt to leave the
cities in search of food.
^ that penetrates now. Ultraviolet light is extremely dangerous to
organisms; the nucleic acids and proteins, the two main biological
molecules, are sensitive to light in the near-ultraviolet wavelength
range.
It now seems that the southern hemisphere would almost certain¬
ly be involved in these effects. Conventional wisdom that the
southern hemisphere would not be involved comes, in part, from
tracking the debris from a single nuclear-weapon explosion. But a
single nuclear-weapon-explosion cannot provide enough fine par¬
ticles to heat the upper atmosphere significantly and cool the sur¬
face. However, if you have something like 10,000 explosions, the
case is very different. Then, the fine particles absorb sunlight in the
northern hemisphere, and the upper atmosphere heats up enor¬
mously. The temperature difference between the northern
hemisphere and the southern hemisphere then drives a new kind of
circulation, on which Dr. Alexandrov will have something more to
say, which transports the fine particles across the equator, thereby
carrying to some degree the cold, the dark and some of the radioac¬
tivity into the southern hemisphere. The idea that there are sanc¬
tuaries on the planet to which someone could flee in expectation of
a nuclear war now seems much less credible.
So, if we put together these consequencesthe dark, the cold, the
chemical toxins from the fire, the fall-out, the ultraviolet flux and
the fact that the phenomenon would be worldwide (perhaps less
severe in the southern hemisphere), we have a new circumstance, a
circumstance in which life everywhere on the planet is threatened.
The biologists even raise the possibility that the extinction of the
human species may be accomplished by nuclear war and nuclear
winter.
I would like to stress that there is a level of conflict below which
nuclear weapons could not drive the climatic catastrophe, what we
call "nuclear winter", and there are levels at which the world
arsenals certainly could drive nuclear winter. We do not know
precisely where this threshold is, the transition, but it seems clearly
far less than the present strategic stockpiles. Very roughly the
threshold may be somewhere near 1,000 strategic warheads it may
be a few hundred, it may be several thousand (depending in part on
how many cities are targetted). I do not want to pretend we know
this to high precision. But let us, just for the next minute or two,
call it 1,000 warheads. The global strategic arsenals are somewhere
around 18,000 strategic warheads. And with the present
planned buildup in American and Soviet strategic weapons, they
will rise in the next few years to something like 25,000 strategic (and
theatre) warheads. That means that we are somewhere between 18
and 25 times larger than the threshold needed if that is the
word to provoke, trigger, this nuclear winter, and put the biology
of the planet in jeopardy.
DR. VLADIMIR ALEXANDROV, Head of the Laboratory of
Climate Modelling at the Computer Centre at the Soviet Academy
of Sciences:
I would like to describe briefly the main climatic consequences of
nuclear war.
The climatic effects are, number one, the terrible geophysical
consequences of nuclear war. The results which I would like to pre¬
sent today are keyed by a simulation of the large computer climatic
model of the Computer Centre of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
It is a large three-dimensional model, which includes the general cir¬
culation model of the atmosphere and the thermodynamic model of
the upper zone.
The calculation of climatic consequences is our last experiment
using this model. To simulate these consequences, we used the
scenario of Professor Sagan's group, and we studied the con¬
sequences of the so-called basic version or basic scenario.
The main impact of nuclear war on our climate is the abrupt,
shocking, very deep and long-term cooling of the air over the con¬
tinents. This cooling is induced by the pollution of the atmosphere
by dust and, mainly, soot.
The fireballs of atomic bombs will ignite cities, plants, fuel
storage sites and forests. Our civilization is full of organic
materials, and the main building block of organic material, the
main atom, is carbon. In the atmospheric environment, synthetics
do not burn completely, so during burning, elementary carbon is
released. This elementary carbon creates the soot. The elementary
carbon has a pretty high conductivity, so it absorbs the solar light
intensively. So the atmosphere will be opaque to solar light, and the
solar flux will be blocked by the pollution of the atmosphere by dust
and soot. This result, the absorption of solar light, is highly sen¬
sitive in the scenario of nuclear war.
I would like to show you just one example of the temperature
drop. In 40 days, the temperature will drop over the United States
about 30°C to 40°C. this means that in July, the temperature over
the territory of the United States will be 0° to - 20°F, or something
like that. In January, it will be something like - 40 to - 60°F. The
picture will be the same over the European territory of the USSR.
The temperature drop over Scandinavia will be about 50°C; over
Saudi Arabia, up to 50°C; over West Siberia, 50°C; over Latin
America, 22°C, and so on; over northern Africa, 20°C.
This means that human beings will be involved shortly in very low
temperature environments. A very important factor during this
period is the strong inter-hemispheric transport. The reason for this
is the strong temperature contrast between the air in the northern
hemisphere and the southern hemisphere.
We studied the change of the global circulation of the at¬
mosphere, using our model, and we found that the global circula¬
tion will be drastically changed in the first three or four weeks. The
classical scheme of circulation disappears, and the global circula¬
tion represents just one giant cell of circulation, which will
transport the enormous amounts of pollutant from the northern
hemisphere to the southern hemisphere.
The oceans
As a result of the darkness and cessation of
photosynthesis, the phytoplankton rapidly die off,
food chains are disrupted and sea life declines.
Toxins and silt draining off the land contaminate
the coastal zone, and the thermal differential bet¬
ween intensely cold continental land masses and
the warmer oceans creates violent coastal storms.
Ocean food sources for humanity largely disap¬
pear and access to the remainder is severely
impaired.
28

^3É
Chemical spills
Nuclear explosions in or near cities would ignite oil
and gas storage facilities and would rupture tanks
containing various toxic chemicals which would
spill into rivers and streams. The pollution would
kill natural aquatic life.
This means that in about three weeks not more than one
month the situation in the southern hemisphere will be as bad as
in the northern hemisphere, and the tropical region will suffer in an
automatic way.
But as a whole, the atmosphere will absorb more energy than
now, because it will be dirty. The upper atmosphere will be warmed
up more than 100°C. So the temperature will increase with altitude.
Now, it decreases with altitude in the troposphere, in the lower layer
of the atmosphere, at the bottom of which we live. And when the
atmosphere becomes very hot above and very cold below, it will
create an enormous superstability. This means that the vertical mo¬
tion, the so-called convective motion, will be strongly suppressed.
At the same time, the vertical transfer of water vapour will be sup¬
pressed, so the hydrological cycle will be highly suppressed, and the
natural cleaning of the atmosphere by rain will also be suppressed.
So, the pollutants will stay in the atmosphere a much longer time
than is now the case.
The permanent increase of temperature described means that the
troposphere will disappear, and the stratosphere will start im¬
mediately from the surface of Earth.
The whole picture means that in a month maybe a little bit less
or maybe a little bit morethe whole globe will be involved in these
terrible consequences of nuclear war, regardless of where and how
the nuclear war occurs, because the pollutant, the dust and soot,
will be mixed very rapidly all over the globe in the space of some
weeks, and the presence of this pollutant will induce this mixing,
because the presence of this pollutant will create the huge
temperature contrast, which will increase the process of mixing.
The suppression of the hydrological cycle will provoke, will in¬
duce, droughts over continents. These droughts will take place in
very low temperatures.
At the same time, the oceans will not cool very much. Our
calculation shows that the mean temperature drop of the ocean in
10 months will be 1.2°C. So the air over the ocean will be as cool
as it is now, maybe several degrees Centigrade less than now. It
means there will be huge temperature contrasts between land and
sea. These temperature contrasts will create severe storms along sea
coasts. During these storms, a huge amount of sea air, full of water
vapour, will be transported over the land, and this water will
precipitate over the land in the form of snow, of course, and it will
start a severe nuclear winter lasting for many months, regardless of
when the conflict occursin July or in January, it does not matter.
And this severe meteorological environment will erase civilization
along the sea coasts.
During the heating of the upper atmosphere, the high mountains
will probably be warmed up. In our calculations, the temperature
over Tibet will increase up to 20°C in eight months. This means that
the hydrological cycle of mountain snow and glaciers will be chang¬
ed in crucial ways, and it is highly probable that this will cause large-
scale floods. Because of the melting of huge amounts of snow and
ice, these floods may be continental in scale. At the same time, in
eight months, the temperature over the land will be low enough
over the United States, the temperature drop will be as much as 20°
or 30°C; over northern Africa, as much as 10°C, and so on.
Finally, I would like to say a little about biota climatic feedback.
The shocking temperature drop will kill the tropical forests,
because tropical forests exist in very narrow temperature bands. So
the shocking cooling up to dozens of degrees Centigrade will kill the
biota and will kill most living species in our world.
At the same time, the biota, the forests of the temperate zone,
will be killed also. This means that the physical properties of the
land surface will be changed for many years ahead, after the
conflict.
This means that the reflectivity coefficient of the solar sun, sun¬
shine reflected from Earth's surface, will be increased two, three or
four times. It means, hence, that the amount of energy which these
huge areas of land have now will be decreased by two, three, four
times. It means that our climatic system, which is extremely fragile
and sensitive to any variations of external and internal parameters,
will inevitably rest in a new state. We do not know what state it will
be. Maybe it will be a new Ice Age. It is too early to give an answer
to this question. But anyway, this state will be absolutely terrible.
So the presentation which I have just made shows that it is highly
probable that in the post-war world, Homo sapiens will not have an
ecological niche. I mean that the environment will be so hostile to
human beings that probably life in the very low-temperature areas
will not be economically viable without fuel, without energy, with
completely frozen water, without any water supply (because all
fresh water will be in a frozen state), without a food supply and so
on.
DR. PAUL EHRLICH, Bing Professor of Population Biology at
Stanford University:
Let me say that I think the scientific results in this case are
something that scientists normally call "robust". Dr. Sagan has
given one reason for the robustness, namely, that the climatic ef¬
fects have been checked in several different kinds of studies in
several different laboratories.
Let me say they are robust in another way, particularly from the
point of view of an ecologist, namely, they have been very conser¬
vative in many of their assumptions. They have been conservative
in their assumptions about the size of firestorms, assuming that
about 4 per cent of the land surface of North America would be
burned off, when other estimates run over 50 per cent. They have
been conservative in not including factors that they know about but
which are hard to model, such as the fugitive dust, which would
blow off from the denuded landscape. If you recall pictures of dust
storms back in the Depression days, they are equally capable of
making it midnight at noon and could continue to produce, along
with long-term fires, some of these climatic effects for much longer ^
times than have been cited.
Agricultural impact
In a spring or summer war, sub-freezing
temperatures would kill or damage virtually all
crops in the Northern Hemisphere. The low light
levels would inhibit photosynthesis and the conse¬
quences would cascade through all food chains.
Most farm animals would be destroyed or severely
weakened by radiation. Those that survived would
soon die of thirst since surface fresh water would
be frozen in the interior of continents.
29

The forests
After a nuclear war, freshwater systems would
freeze to considerable depths, killing off the food
for woodland creatures. Radioactive fall-out would
kill many conifers. Dead dry conifers would
become kindling for massive forest fires.
production for a year in the northern hemisphere. That in itself
would be the greatest catastrophe ever delivered upon Homo sa¬
piens: just that one thing, not worrying about the prompt effects.
So that even below the threshold, one cannot think of survival of
nuclear war as just being able to stand up after the bomb has gone
off.
Some 70 biologists have reviewed the climatic results. In a
meeting last April [1983], they were able to come to a unanimous
conclusion about what these results mean, simply because built into
them is a level of biological overkill such that there can be no
disagreement. Asking ecologists and evolutionists to, evaluate the
biological impact of a nuclear winter was the equivalent of asking
a group of distinguished physicians: "If everyone in this room put
a loaded double-barrelled shotgun in his or her mouth and pulled
both triggers simultaneously, what would be the medical results?"
The darkness alone, as Dr. Sagan mentioned, would be more
than enough to cut off our ecological systems at their base because,
as you know, we all depend on plants for our lives. In the oceans,
the thermal inertia of the water would Iceep them relatively warm,
but the plants that support the oceanic food chains (single-celled
phytoplankton) have essentially no reserves and would die im¬
mediately. In temperate areas, all of the growing land plants would
die. They would be killed not just by the dark, but also by the ex¬
traordinary cold. If the war occurred during the growing season, as
it would be likely to do, many of the plants that in other seasons
are able to take quite a bit of cold would be killed outright, because
they would not have the chance to harden (increase their cold-
resistance) as they normally do in the fall.
Basically, you have: the dark, which could be more than enough
to destroy biological systems, at least in the northern hemisphere;
and the cold, which also would be more than enough to destroy
biological systems. Then there would be the extraordinary amounts
of radiation which were a surprise for the biologistswe had long
known that there would be very serious radiation effects on human
beings, but the new findings indicate they would be large enough to
damage ecosystemsthe toxic smog and the ultraviolet-B. Any one
of those would be more than enough to put ecological systems into
deep stress. Most of them would be enough, each by itself, to kill
off that year's food production, anyway. And, in combination,
there is an incredible level of overkill, so much that the biologists
were able to conclude unanimously that, if there were a large-scale
nuclear war triggering these kinds of climatic effects, in essence,
you could kiss goodbye to the northern hemisphere. No civilization
would survive in the northern hemisphere.
The only survival that there might be would be in extraordinarily
deep shelters, with huge supplies of food, with self-contained air
supplies and so on. And all those people, of course, would only be
delaying their deaths, because when they came out, there would be
nothing to come out to a denuded, highly radioactive continent
with no way to go back to agriculture to supply food, to supply any
of the amenities of life.
If the effects spread to the southern hemisphere, then, of course,
the biologists concluded, as Dr. Alexandrov has just indicated, that
the extermination of human life could not be precluded, and under
some circumstances, would be likely.
And let me stress that I have a long list of other ecological effects
which I and others had identified long before, that have long been
ignored, and that I am going to leave out today because of the over¬
riding effects that we have just been discussing.
If a war below the threshold occurs and there is no full-scale
nuclear winter, we would in no sense be out of the woods in terms
of the long-term biological effects. For example, a smaller war,
which set off fewer fires and put less dust in the atmosphere, could
very easily depress the temperatures in the northern hemisphere by,
say, 7° or 8°C. That would be enough to essentially cancel grain
DR. ALEXANDER PAVLOV, Director of the Moscow Scientific
Institute on Radiology:
Considering the after-effects of total nuclear war, it is necessary
to take into account both immediate, direct effects, connected with
the destructive factors of nuclear weapons, and remote, indirect in¬
fluences on human health and life, due to the inevitable disastrous
changes in the environment.
Today we are well aware of the destructive influences of such fac¬
tors of nuclear weapons as shock wave, high temperature, radiation
and contamination by radioactive nuclides.
I should like to note that after nuclear explosions, there will
develop in different proportions combined lesions with different
syndromes caused by mechanical traumas, thermal burns and
radiation.
The World Health Organization holds that human losses in a
total nuclear war would amount to more than one thousand million
persons, with the same number of wounded. In total, about half of
the world population would become a direct victim of nuclear war.
The fate of another half of the world population will depend on
harmful influences of radiological, climatic, socio-economic and
other factors.
Speaking about immediate effects of nuclear-weapon use, it is
necessary to dwell particularly on a new form of pathology that
is, the radiation lesions.
Today, numerous data have been collected, showing the
biological action of radiation on living beings. These data open
wide prospects for the use of radiation in medicine for thé benefit
of mankind. But radiation has another aspect. External or internal
radiation of the total body causes a pathological condition, so-
called radiation disease. The severity of radiation disease depends
on the size of the absorbed dose and the volume of irradiated
tissues. There exist various forms of that disease.
When high doses of radiation act on a human being, the clinical
picture is characterized by changes in the central nervous system ac¬
companied by stupor, which end with death in the next few hours,
or days, after radiation.
Radiation with lesser doses causes such clinical manifestations as
gastrointestinal changes, with haemorrhagic diarrhoea or
haemopoietic tissue, lesions with cytopenia, anaemia and im¬
munological damages. Infectious complications such as stomatitis,
pharyngitis, enterocolitis, pneumonia and others aggravate the
state of patients even further. Very often, such conditions end with
the death of the injured people.
The long-term effect will depend on the particular environment.
Human life cannot be thought of as separate from its environment.
Therefore, all data on the ecological and climatic changes on the
globe which will take place due to tremendous nuclear explosions
are extremely important and decisive for the estimation of the
remote consequences.
Worldwide effects
The cold and darkness following a nuclear war in
the Northern Hemisphere would probably extend
into the sub-tropics and tropics of both the Nor¬
thern and Southern Hemispheres. These would
cause large-scale injury to plants and animals
there and would severely damage or destroy
tropical rain forests, the great reservoir of Earth's
organic diversity. .

After 40 days
Maps show changes in surface air
temperatures 40 days (above) and 243
days (below) after the launching of a
nuclear war in which 5,000megatons are
exploded, as calculated by the Com¬
puting Centre of the USSR Academy of
Sciences. The lines are isotherms [an
isotherm is a line connecting points of
equal temperature] graded at intervals of
5 degrees. After 40 days there would be a
drop in temperature of 30 to 40 degrees
(Centigrade) over the USA and the USSR,
50 degrees over Scandinavia and Saudi
Arabia, 22 degrees over Latin America
and 20 degrees over Africa. After 243
days heating of the upperatmosphere will
lead to rises in temperature over large
mountain systems ranging from 5 to 6
degrees over the Andes to 20 degrees
over Tibet, enough to provoke flooding
on a continental scale.
After 243 days
Global atmospheric and climatic consequences of a nuclear war
would have a destructive influence on the future existence of all liv¬
ing beings on Earth and, in the first place, on the human popula¬
tion. The abrupt decrease in air temperature and impermeation of
the atmosphere by solar radiation would create extreme conditions
for the existence of mankind.
Those houses that remained unruined would be inadequate for
sheltering people. They would have to search for shelters
underground. That fact would lead to overcrowding, to the im¬
possibility of ensuring the simplest sanitary conditions, which
would cause epidemics of such infectious diseases as classical
typhus and enteric fever, cholera and viral diseases, etc.
The disappearance of forests, which are rightly regarded as the
"lungs" of our planet, would lead to an abrupt decrease in the ox¬
ygen content of atmospheric air. That would have an extremely
negative effect on the existence of living beings.
Low temperatures and a decrease in solar radiation would lead
to the disappearance of vegetables and agricultural crops that
would deprive mankind of the possibility of obtaining food pro¬
ducts. Chronic starvation would lead also to immunity damage,
that would facilitate the development of various infectious diseases.
The world's oceans and all other bodies of water would cease to
be a source of goods. In connection with global effects, oceans
would become a tomb for all animals and plants. That would
deprive mankind of its last source of food. The water supply would
be completely disrupted, with all that implies.
The human body has high possibilities of adaptation to various
extreme conditions. Man is able to live for a long time on ice drifts,
in Antarctica, to fly to space stations, to live in a blockaded town
for instance, during the Second World War, people lived in
blockaded Leningrad for 900 days. But in all these cases, a certain
hinterland .exists, which supports the people. In the case of nuclear
catastrophe, such a hinterland would not exist.
After a lapse of several years, from the moment of total nuclear
war, an approximate recovery of the atmosphere and normalization
of climatic conditions would be possible.
Restoration of the vital functions of living beings, capable of liv¬
ing in conditions of anabiosis, would be also possible. However,
human beings would not be alive then. My short excursus as a doc¬
tor into the- future after global nuclear war is naturally incomplete,
because it seems to be difficult to enumerate all the factors which
can arise within a complicated change of climatic, natural,
ecological and socio-economic interaction.
Destructive effects of a nuclear catastrophe would certainly lead
to the disappearance of human beings, that crowning point of
evolution on Earth.

Unesco and peace research
An important objective of Unesco's Major Programme No.
XIII, Peace, International Understanding, Human Rights
and the Rights of Peoples, is to encourage reflection on the
factors contributing to peace by means ofstudies combining
philosophical reflection and moral considerations and to
clarify, in an historical perspective, the causes of conflicts
and their various interpretations. The article below is based
on a working document prepared by the Unesco Secretariat
for an Expert Meeting on Philosophical Research on Ac¬
tivities Linked with the Strengthening of the Spirit of Peace,
held in Paris in December 1980.
Reaching up to the Mediterranean sky,
the temple of Athena Nike (Giver of vic¬
tory) stands like a sentinel at the entrance
to the Acropolis, the natural heart of
Athens. Beyond it stands the Parthenon,
the rectangular, columned temple of
Athena whose deceptive simplicity is an
expression of the ideal ofclarity and unity
that Is the mainspring of the Platonic
tradition, Greece's spiritual bequest to
the world.
True successors to Leónidas, the Greek
armed forces inflicted a severe defeat on
Mussolini's Fascist forces who invaded
Greece in October 1940 and held out
against the combined Axis forces until
the end ofApril 1941. Greek losses during
the conflict are estimated at 160,000, of
whom 140,000 were civilians.
THERE is an urgent need to elab¬
orate a generally acceptable
modern philosophical framework
on which to base activities aimed at
strengthening peace; this would include
an epistemology of the investigation of
peace/war phenomena, a distillation of
the philosophical essence of what con¬
stitutes a stable peace, and the ethical
foundations of peaceful relations in all
domains.
The lack of a general epistemology
tends to weaken many well-intentioned
attempts at peace research. A number of
recent attempts to explain the peace/
war phenomenon have exhibited a
common methodological weakness
oversimplification. Oversimplified models
of analytical abstractions have, for exam
ple, been constructed in the hope of
throwing new light on complex, little-
understood phenomena by comparing
them with other, simpler and better-known
phenomena. The descriptive accuracy of
such models is doubtful, their capacity to
provide valid explanations of phenomena
is restricted, and they are only of limited
use in practical applications and in
forecasting.
In order to clarify the theoretical bases
of modern peace research it is necessary
to analyse its phraseology and ter¬
minology, sometimes borrowed from
other disciplines and often ambiguous. At
the 26th session of the United Nations
General Assembly, for instance, it was
suggested that "polemological baro¬
meters" should be establisheda meta
phor designating mechanisms capable
of predicting local conflicts that could
threaten peace.
Subsequently, the metaphor was car¬
ried further when it was proposed that an
attempt should be made to detect "fronts
of collective aggressivity", analogous to
the meteorologists' "weather fronts";
.computers were thought to be the best in¬
struments for establishing these "baro¬
meters" and detecting these "fronts".
Thus an elaborate meteorological
metaphor for the peace/war phenomenon
was built up.
We should not denigrate all the work ac¬
complished in the elaboration of com¬
puterized "polemological barometers",
but the dangers involved in the use of
such metaphors and the extrapolation of
32

methods from one field of research to
another, from a natural science to a social
science, should also be borne in mind.
Less popular has been the "medical"
model which assimilates peace and war to
good health and sickness in the human
body. Inventors of this model themselves
point out that "whereas the human body
clearly fits the idea of a 'natural system',
including the processes of self-
maintenance and aging, we have some
difficulties in conceptualizing the interna¬
tional system in a similar manner".
. Nevertheless, Norwegian theorist
Johan Galtung, explaining a distinction
between negative peace (defined as the
absence of war) and positive peace
(presence of patterns of co-operation),
supposes that it runs parallel to a distinc¬
tion between negative and positive health
in the medical sciences and the "health"
of the international system may depend to
a certain extent on the "health" of its
parts, i.e. nations.
"Meteorological" and "medical" con¬
ceptions of peace/war patterns are, of
course, clearly recognized by peace
research students as preliminary
metaphors rather than as fully elaborated
models. But in the field of peace research
there are also models whose
metaphorical character is not so obvious.
Among these are psychological Freudian
and behaviourist models, anthropological
models, ethological models, and so on.
Every attempt at modelling bears in
itself the danger of reductionism, of ar¬
tificial oversimplification of the object of
research. But when the theoretical ap¬
proach is derived from the natural
sciences (such as medicine or
meteorology) and extrapolated to the
social sciences, the danger is increased.
Modelling based on a comparison of con¬
flicts between primitive tribes and modern
conflicts between States (i.e. wars), being
within the social sciences, may very well
display external and immaterial
similarities. It can be presumed that con¬
flicts in societies with different social
structures will present some differences
as well as similarities, since the social
nature of conflicts as well as their degree
of complexity are variable. They cannot
be considered merely as simple ancient
and complicated modern forms of the
same phenomenon.
The need for peace research to develop
its own paradigm, or exemplary model, is
evident and, in fact, several such
paradigms exist. A well known one is the
theoretical Marxist structural explanation
of the cause of war which presumes
private ownership of the means of produc¬
tion, exploitation of populations by the
minority possessing classes and an an¬
tagonistic class stratification of society to
be the principal ground of external ag¬
gression and war, perpetual peace being
an ideal of a future world socialist com¬
munity free from every kind of exploita¬
tion. There are many modern modifica¬
tions of this scheme, using different
phraseologies but similar in their content.
Of course, the Marxist account of war
and peace has also been criticized.
From the philosophical point of view, for
instance, a fundamental criticism is
A prayer for peace. Monks in meditation
against the backdrop of the snow-capped
summit of Fujiyama, the sacred mountain
of Japan.
sometimes made. Although the Marxist
approach to an explanation of war and
peace does not rely on an explicit
metaphor or model, it is, nevertheless,
reductionist in that it attempts to explain
tensions and hostilities between
sovereign States in terms of conflicts of
another kind within the separate States.
The history of social science is strewn
with the relics of unsuccessful reduc-
tionisms; and this is why adoption of an in¬
terdisciplinary "systems" approach to the
phenomena of war and peace is thought
to hold some promise for the future. Nor
should we forget the positive models
elaborated since 1966 within the
framework of the World Order Models Pro¬
ject (WOMP) and which reached a high
level of conceptual design.
Another philosophical problem that it is
difficult to avoid is that of the status of
"laws" governing the development of
society. The debate has been a familiar
one at least since the publication of Sir
Karl Popper's Poverty of Historicism, but
it remains as relevant today as it was a
quarter of a century ago.
To what extent are the "laws" of social
development that we have discovered so
far, or that we can expect to discover,
similar to the laws of the natural sciences?
In what respects are they different? For
example, it is argued that whilst the laws
of nature cannot be changed by man, who
33

won a prize in a children 's
ad contest held during a "Two
days with Unesco" event organized
in June 1984 on the initiative of the
cultural centre of Lucy-sur-Yonne (France)
under the auspices of the Unesco Courier.
The theme of the contest was: "Getting
to know each otherthe way to commu¬
nity and better mutual understanding. "
Other award-winners were: Sandrine Mar¬
tin (aged 7), Raphael Gomez (aged 10),
Séverine Déjardin (aged 12), André Beau-
vallet (aged 14), Patrick Beauvallet,
Fabrice Fougeron and Florence Go-
din (aged 16). A large number of
local schools took pan in the
event.
^ can only adapt himself to them and use
his knowledge of their peculiarities in his
activities, the laws of society, according to
Marxist belief, can be changed by human
activity to the benefit of mankind.
Is the establishment of perpetual peace
possible today? We know that throughout
history there has always been more war
than peace. Is this because of the ex¬
istence of specific laws governing society
and human behaviour that make war in¬
evitable or even, as some thinkers have
suggested, indispensable? If such laws
exist, are they absolute like the laws of
nature? Or can they, like other laws gover¬
ning society, be changed? Can their ef¬
fects be tempered or in some way
channelled?
Thus peace research has already pro¬
vided us with a number of theories,
elements of theories, models and
metaphors for the analysis of war and
peace; but a number of deep
philosophical questions arise with an in¬
sistence that makes it difficult for us to ig¬
nore them.
Peace research is an interdisciplinary
field of great complexity. Attention must
be directed to the "dialectic of peace", in
the sense of the complex interrelation¬
ships between the peace/war dimension
on the one hand, and, on the other, the
dimensions of human rights, development
within nations, equity between nations on
both the political and economic levels,
and the existence and recognition of
cultural diversity. Each of these dimen¬
sions in turn involves an ethical aspect
and discussion of peace/war problems of¬
fers an opportunity to test and refine the
principal theories of ethics that philosophy
has developed over the course of its
history, whether they be rationalistic, ¡n-
tuitionistic, utilitarian, or of any other type.
The view of Kant, for example, im¬
mediately comes to mind: a reasonable
being must act only according to maxims
which may constitute a system of laws.
According to Kant, who also outlined the
idea of perpetual peace, rational
behaviour must be based on a clear,
developed system of coherent ethics, em¬
bodied in laws and rules.
The notion of such a system underlies
proposals for a New International Order. A
fully thought out philosophy, above all an
ethical philosophy, of a New International
Order is needed, and this philosophy has
to form the basis of the modern concept of
peace. An understanding of the fun¬
damental concepts of the great theories of
ethics is of the utmost importance to an
appreciation of the values implicit in the
peace/war dialectic; and the practicalities
of the problems faced by the world today
in peace and war can, if carefully examin¬
ed and reflected upon, help to enrich the
ethical theories of philosophy itself.
