Ancient Magyar pottery
Unearthed in Hungary in 1958, these three funerary urns date
back some 4,000 years to the late Bronze Age. They range
from 24 to 48 centimetres in height. With their grey colouring
and primitively fashioned human faces, they recall pottery
of the same period discovered at Troy. They are now preserved
in the Hungarian National Museum, in Budapest.

"OTH human beings and animals use sound as
a means of communication and it is often difficult to dis¬
tinguish the articulated sounds we call language from other
elements, such as the pitch and the relative duration of
sounds which form the basis of what we call music.
There are tone languages, sung recitations and musical
structures analogous to those of spoken language. Close
connexions exist between gesture and articulated speech
and between gesture and music, and this is what we call
dancing.
In societies with an oral tradition, that is to say in the
early stages of every society, we find psalmody or sung
recitation as the vehicle for historical narrative, mythology
and the teaching of philosophical and moral concepts.
Bards specializing in this art and possessing highly
trained memories become veritable living libraries. We
owe the Iliad and the Vedas to sources such as these
and it is the bards of today who preserve a great number
of the epic poems of India that have not yet been trans¬
cribed and almost the entire vast oral heritage of African
thought and culture.
Throughout the world, sung recitation has provided the
vehicle for the transmission of culture among men ; but, in
all cultures, it was the union of gesture, rhythm and dancing
that led to the evolution of psycho-physiological processes
which make it possible to create states of trance and to
communicate with the supernatural world.
We find this intoxicating use of sound everywhere, in
the Dionysiac dances of ancient Greece, in the Indian
kirtana, in the Islamic dhekr and in the dances of exorcism
and magic once practised by all the peoples of Asia, Africa
and pre-Columbian and African America.
From these forms of music, associated as they are with
life itself and with human society, forms of musical art
evolved in all civilizations which, to a greater or lesser
extent, are liberated from their social function and which
we sometimes call learned music or art music.
This evolution, however, has taken on very different forms
according to the conceptions which the various cultures
have come to hold of the nature of the arts, their role and
their purpose.
Apart from Western harmonic music which is a compa¬
ratively recent creation, we can distinguish among the
civilizations of today four great musical "epicentres", whose
points of origin cannot be fixed with certainty, but which
correspond to principles of musical art common to vast
areas of the world.
The first of these is the modal conception, according to
which a melody is developed on the foundation of a fixed
and continuous sound called the tonic. To this form of
music belong the music of India and Iran, Arab and
Turkish music, and almost all the ancient music of the
Mediterranean countries.
The second very ancient musical sphere is that of south¬
east Asia, the old kingdom of Champa, of Cambodia,
Thailand and Indonesia. This is a wholly independent
culture that makes particular use of percussion instruments
in polyphonic forms superimposing several kinds of sound.
The third sphere is that of the Far East including China,
Korea, Mongolia, Japan and Viet-Nam. The highly sophistic^
ated musical forms encountered here are based on a system
of five-note scales.
The fourth sphere of musical culture has its centre in
Africa and is characterized by the predominance of rhythm.
African culture suffered greatly during the colonial period,
but musical forms of great refinement still exist which
recall the presence of highly evolved cultures.
Outside these major cultural currents there are of course
several regions in which distinctively independent musical
forms survive, such as the music of the Pygmies in the
heart of Africa, or the music of Tibet in the heart of Asia.
Many of the musical forms of pre-Columbian America,
however, appear to have connexions with the music of the
Far East and the music of Polynesia is related to an ancient
musical family extending from tribal India to Australia but
which now survives only in folk music forms. '

MUSIC
OF THE
CENTURIES
New and lost horizons
of musical traditions

by Maurice Freedman
MAURICE FREEDMAN fs an internationally
famous name in the world of anthropology.
He is Professor of Social Anthropology at
Oxford University (U.K.) and the author of
a 230-page chapter on Social and Cultural
Anthropology to appear in the forthcoming
Part II of Unesco's study entitled "Main
Trends of Research in the Fields of Social
and Human Sciences." Part I was published
in English by Unesco-Mouton, The Hague,
in 1970 (See "Unesco Courier", March 1973.
page 4). The text presented here is a
passage from a special section on music.
HE study of the music of
non-literate societies, and more widely
of non-European societies, was nurtur¬
ed during the first half of the twentieth
century by some university depart¬
ments of anthropology in the U.S.A.
and Europe and largely ignored by
the more conventional musicologists.
For the latter, music was an art belong¬
ing almost exclusively to the European
tradition.
The exotic element in musicology
was represented for the most part by
the popular traditions collected and
analyzed within the folklore studies of
continental Europe. Since about 1950
that general trend has been reversed.
While in much of continental Europe
the folklore tradition of musicology
has pursued its course, ethnomusico-
logy has during the last few years
exhibited a number of newer trends.
In the first place, there has been
a tendency partly to disengage the
study of non-European music from the
framework established within Western
musicology, the non-Western musical
cultures being examined in their own
terms. One stimulus for this devel¬
opment has been the emergence of
a body of scholars within the "new"
nations who, in studying their own
music by the basic methods devised
within the Western tradition, yet bring
to their work a view from the inside.
A related movement, although one
which embraces the foreign investi¬
gators, might be called the field
worker's "internalization" of non-Eu¬
ropean music by his study of practical
performance and composition, an effort

THE 'JUKE-BOX' CRISIS
IN ASIAN MUSIC
by Tran Van Khê
LLMOST all the countries of
Asia, Africa, Oceania and Latin
America are non-industrial societies.
In all these countries, as in certain
strata of society in Western countries,
music, for the workers who constitute
the great mass of the population, is
not simply entertainment, a source of
spiritual satisfaction, or an art cultivat¬
ed for its own sake, but is closely
interwoven with everyday work and
life.
Professional musicians and music-
lovers approach music more as an art
form, clothing it in theory and relating
it to a certain world outlook or philo¬
sophy. Yet both for this élite and for
the ordinary people, music remains
bound up with social and religious
functions.
Music rocks babies to sleep, and
children use music in their games. It
helps the labourer to forget how hard
his work is, it is "the food of love"
and a balm for hurt bodies and minds.
It sees the dead on their way and
consoles the living. It provides an
accompaniment to all the operations
of the farming calendar, the ploughing,
harrowing, sowing, planting, harvesting
and threshing and the husking and
grinding of the rice.
In non-industrial societies, particu-

TRAN VAN KHE is not only a specialist on
Asian music but an accomplished performer
himself. He comes from a Vietnamese
family that has produced several generations
of musicians and has an extraordinary know¬
ledge of Asian musical instruments. He at
present directs the Centre for the Study of
Oriental Music at the Sorbonne's Institute of
Musicology in Paris. He also heads a
research team at the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique, also in Paris, and Is
a member of the Unesco-sponsored Internat¬
ional Music Council. For his recordings and
commentaries on Vietnamese music he was
awarded the Grand Prix de l'Académie des
Disques Français in 1960 and 1970 and the
Deutscher Schallplatten Preis (1969). A more
detailed study of the subiect dealt with by
Prof. Tran Van Khe in this article will be
published in September 1973 in a special
issue on 'Music and Society" of Unesco's
new international magazine "Cultures".
larly among the mass of the people,
music is not an art pursued for the
sake of art, but is present at all the
important events of life birth and
betrothals, weddings and funerals.
Farmers and craftsmen each have
their own repertoire and music is pre¬
sent at all rural and seasonal festivities,
at ceremonies to ward off misfortune,
to placate evil spirits or thank the
tutelary gods and guardian spirits.
Such music is usually vocal, some¬
times with the accompaniment of sim¬
ple but ingenious folk instruments
which provide the melody or the
rhythm. It is anonymous and orally
transmitted, and each performer has
the right to imprint his own character
upon it. Performers are for the most
part workers or semi-professionals.
Being essentially functional, this
music differs from that practised as an
art by professional musicians and con¬
noisseurs who use more elaborate in¬
struments, more complex vocal and
instrumental techniques and more
varied scales, and have richer reper¬
toires.
Music of this kind, seen as an art
form, may have its origins in the music
of the people, but differs from it in its
artistic level and its function. As it
is more sophisticated, it is harder to
learn, and those who spend years
learning it must either be able to make
a living from it or be rich enough to
regard it as a pastime.
In the old days, professional musi¬
cians, often of humble origin, had to
seek employment in many cases as
bondsmen or menials with music-
loving chiefs, aristocrats or sovereigns.
At the Court of Hue (Viet-Nam), for
example, palace musicians were gen¬
erally regarded as servants and were
given jobs to do which were quite un¬
connected with their musical functions.
Musicians were somewhat better
treated in China, Korea and Japan but
were not held in great esteem. In
ancient Persia and in India under the
reign of the Emperor Akbar, musicians
and singers enjoyed the favour of the
sovereigns, but at the end of the 19th
century in Persia, when rich men enter- *
tained, there were only two or three
musicians who, according to Claude
Huart in Lavignac's Encyclopédie de
la Musique, sat on the floor in a cor¬
ner during the meal.
The griots, or professional musi¬
cians, of Mauritania formed a separate
caste. Michel Guignard, in a book
entitled Musique, Honneur et Plaisir au
Sahara, has offered an explanation of
their menial status : "To place the
gn'ot on any but a very low rung of
the social ladder would be to suggest
that entertainment and amusement
were of no less value than the courage
and political strength embodied by the
warriors or the religion and learning
embodied by the marabouts."
Even in countries where music is
held in high regard, professional musi¬
cians do not always enjoy the status
they should be entitled to. In present-
day Iran, for instance, performers and
teachers of traditional music prefer to
call themselves employees of the
Ministry of Fine Arts or teachers at
the Conservatoire or the University.
I|N the nineteenth century,
after attempting to conquer the coun¬
tries of Asia and Africa by the
"peaceful" method of converting the
population to Christianity, the Western
powers tried to overrun them by force
of arms. Several of these countries
lost their independence, whilst others
came under foreign economic control.
The vast majority of the population
in the countries which thus fell under
colonial rule consisted of countryfolk
landless peasant tenant-farmers,
agricultural workers at the mercy
of landowners and money-lenders
deeply attached to the traditions of
their ancestors.

ASIAN MUSIC (Continued)
A few chords to get rich quick
8
Craftsmen, tradesmen and petty offi¬
cials belonged to the "middle class",
forming a moneyed and partly western¬
ized bourgeoisie. The introduction of
capitalist production methods created
a proletariat which worked in the
mines, factories, mills and plantations.
All these political and social upheav¬
als brought about profound changes
in the musical life of the non-industrial
societies. Some kinds of music fell
into disuse or disappeared altogether.
Science and technology have done
away with certain back-breaking jobs,
but at the same time many work songs
have disappeared or are about to do
so. With the advent of power-driven
ploughs, machines to husk the rice
and modern irrigation systems, the old
songs that used to accompany these
operations are no longer heard. As
steamboats replace sampans, canoes
or sailing craft, the songs of the
boatmen will become a thing of the
past.
The development of science and
medicine has spelt the end of the old
superstitions in many countries.
People now prefer to go to the doctor
rather than the witch-doctor when they
are ill, and the incantations for healing
the sick, driving out devils and com¬
municating with spirits are beginning
to disappear.
Transistor radios have now penetrat¬
ed even into very remote areas, and
the peasants and shepherds who can
now listen to music at home are not
In any hurry to go to the market-place
to listen to strolling singers, just as
city-dwellers are no longer so easily
drawn to concerts or plays when they
have television at home. Listening to
the "new" music put out by the broad¬
casting stations, country folk tend to
imitate an urban style of singing, parti¬
cularly that of well-known singers or
musicians.
The worst thing about this situation
is that young country folk are deterred
by the "new" music composed by
young people under western influences
from composing new songs in the
traditional styles.
In contact with city-dwellers and lis¬
tening to "arranged", "harmonized"
versions of folk-music, they adopt a
new repertoire composed by young
musicians who are often unaware of
their own traditions and have merely
picked up a few rudiments of western-
style composition, modelling their
style on that of popular songs. Crea¬
tive talent and the artistic level of
folk-music are everywhere in decline.
Several musical genres have indeed
disappeared. Chinese, Korean and
Viet-Namese court music is dying out
now the courts themselves have gone.
It is performed only on very special
occasions, e.g. for national holidays
for receiving ambassadors, for groups
of tourists, etc.
Confucian temple music is no longer
played in China and Viet-Nam and
is only heard in Seoul and Taipeh,
where societies for the preservation of
musical traditions have attempted to
save them. The old ceremonies are no
longer performed in Confucian temples.
In Iran, the ta'ziya, a historical and
religious spectacle comparable with
the medieval passion-plays, showing
the martyrdoms of the Imams (legiti¬
mate successors of Mohammed), is
no longer performed in the big towns,
with the exception of Shiraz where it
was presented during the internatio¬
nal festivals of 1967 and 1970. The
custom lingers on in the countryside
but the plays are no longer performed
with the same spontaneity as of old.
In Mauritania today, the character
of the griot has greatly changed.
Michel Guignard, whom we quoted
above, writes in this connexion that
they are becoming less and less the
minstrels and familiars of the nobility.
Anyone can now go and listen to them
or hear them on the radio. They
therefore reach a wider audience with
tastes and needs different from those
of the minority whom they formerly
served.
Similarly, the expert Hugo Zemp
writes that now that the traditional
way of life of the chiefs of the Senufo
of the Ivory coast has gone into
decline, or has completely vanished
as a result of changing political condi¬
tions, the flute orchestra has lost its
raison d'être.
In Morocco, the Near East, India
and Cambodia, all observers empha¬
size that modern life and the intrusion
of modern technology deprive folk-art
of new subject matter and seem to
dry up the wellsprings of musical
inspiration.
new music is appearing
everywhere, often as a result of the
"acculturation" of traditional music, a
process which is no less prejudicial to
tradition than the disappearance of the
old musical genres. "Acculturation"
is a modern term signifying the adop¬
tion by a given people of a culture
i -Hi?
other than its own, but the phenomenon
is by no means new.
Japan adopted Chinese music of the
T'ang dynasty, Korean music and cham
music in the ninth century, and the
result was the Togaku, Komagaku and
Rinyugaku styles of Japanese court
music (Gagaku). Viet-Nam not only
assimilated the Chinese tradition but
also the Indian, through the inter¬
mediary of the ancient Indian-influen¬
ced civilization of the Champa king¬
dom, while north Indian music was
influenced by the music of Islam.
In the last few centuries, it has been
primarily the encounter between west¬
ern music and the traditional music of
the non-industrial societies which has
caused the most profound upheaval in
the latter.
The causes of acculturation are
many. In the beginning, it may be a
praiseworthy desire to learn some¬
thing new, a desire for progress, which
incites musicians to do something dif¬
ferent from their masters or predeces¬
sors, . to give their music a personal

stamp. When they had to rely on
their own resources, change was slow;
when they came into contact with
neighbouring countries, more significant
changes occurred. Acculturation is
the product of contact between peo¬
ples and civilizations, combined with
the attraction of novelty.
Contact between countries with the
same culture is very fruitful consider
the impact of Chinese music, particu¬
larly of the Tang dynasty (eighth-
ninth centuries) on Japanese music,
of T'ang and Sung (tenth-eleventh cen¬
turies) music on Korean music, and of
Ming dynasty (fourteenth-fifteenth cen¬
turies) music on the Vietnamese of
the Le dynasty (fifteenth-sixteenth cen¬
turies). Thai music owed a great deal
to the Khmer tradition and the instru¬
ments of the p'iphat orchestra of Thai¬
land are the same as those in the bas-
reliefs of Angkor. Turkish, Arab and
Persian musicians all paid allegiance
to the same musical theorists.
Above all, the encounter with the
West has engendered hybrid musical
forms. Africa and the East have fol¬
lowed the western lead and some have
ascribed this to the superiority of
western music.
The colonial peoples tried to imi¬
tate those who dominated them by
the superiority of their technology, in
the belief that their culture too must
be equally superior, and ended up
confusing progress and modernization
with westernization.
Lastly, the development of such media
as radio, television and records speeds
the process of acculturation even
more. Transistors and records have
reached even the remotest villages.
Under constant musical attack from
all sides, young people today are
drawn and fascinated by this easy-to-
write, easy-to-play, easy-to-remember
music, and no longer have the patience
to spend several years of their lives
learning the traditional music.
They need only learn to play a few
chords on the Spanish guitar and after
six months they can accompany them¬
selves singing the western-style songs
written by their compatriots. Those
who fall in with the fashion of the day
may become radio, television or record¬
ing stars and get rich quick.
The development of communications
has also made it easier for musicians
to travel. Some Oriental virtuosi who
have given concerts in the West have
been impressed by symphony orches¬
tras and returned home with the idea
of writing concertos for a traditional
instrument and symphony orchestra.
The result is hybrid music.
Etymologically, the words hybrid or
hybridization are not pejorative. As
biological terms, they refer to the
crossing of different species or even
different varieties of the same species.
In everyday speech, a hybrid is some¬
thing in which two elements of differ¬
ent nature are artificially combined.
Applied to language, to art or music,
the term implies a certain disdain.
At the Shiraz seminar on Asian
Music in 1968 and again at the Con¬
gress of the International Music Coun¬
cil in New York, I suggested that there

ASIAN MUSIC (Continued)
were two distinct sorts of hybridization.
Firstly, there is the sort which im¬
poverishes, which sometimes destroys
the national character of one of the
two traditions involved, which is what
happens in most cases when the music
of the East or of Africa comes into
contact with western music.
Oriental or African musicians accom¬
pany songs based on particular tona¬
lities on a piano tuned to an equally
tempered scale, or use clarinets, saxo¬
phones and even electric guitars to
perform traditional music, playing com¬
mon chords or arpeggios to punctuate
the musical phrases of traditional
music. Hybridization in such cases is
detrimental because it tries to apply
the instruments and styles of one tra¬
dition to another tradition with which
they are incompatible.
On the other hand, there have been
cases of beneficial hybridization where
the borrowing of foreign elements has
led to a new flowering of a particular
tradition.
This was what happened when the
music of northern India came into
contact with the Islamic tradition, when
Japanese court music was enriched by
the influence of T'ang dynasty Chinese
music, Korean and cham music, and
when Vietnamese music assimilated
both the Chinese and Indian traditions.
The effect is beneficial because the
elements borrowed are compatible
with the original tradition.
Acculturation has reached epidemic
proportions and caused havoc among
the musical traditions of the non-indus¬
trial societies, because instead of bor¬
rowing from the West new and con¬
structive elements such as would lend
new vigour to their own musical tra¬
ditions, Asians and Africans have bor-

rowed elements which are incompatible
with the basic principles of their tra¬
ditional music.
Acculturation is a universal pheno¬
menon. What we must try to do is
to turn the potentially destructive
forces involved into constructive
forces. The problem appears to me
to be one of incompatibility and com¬
patibility. Whereas the combining of
compatible elements produces a suc¬
cessful "graft", the incompatibility of
the elements concerned causes "re¬
jection".
A very thorough knowledge of one's
own national culture and the culture
from which the elements are to be
borrowed is needed in order to avoid
"rejection". Unfortunately, the leading
exponents of the traditional music,
aloof in their ivory towers and blinded
by their own superiority complexes,
refuse to allow change and in many
cases are unfamiliar with any tradition
other than their own, which they con¬
sider to be the only valid one.
Young people, on the other hand,
are only interested in western music,
the only form they consider valid, the
music of their own country being
regarded as mere "folklore". Thus
neither the traditional musicians nor
the young are capable of distinguishing
which elements are compatible and
which are incompatible and thus avoid
ing a type of acculturation which is
prejudicial to their traditions.
In many countries, the new music
corresponds to a new need, the need
to sing together at mass gatherings.
It has thus made its own contribution
to the awakening of national conscious¬
ness and to preparing the peoples of
those countries for the national lib¬
eration struggle, and has hence fulfilled
its historical mission. In most cases,
however, such music leaves a great
deal to be desired from the artistic
point of view.
Several young musicians have stud¬
ied composition in the conservatoires
of Europe and America and have
adopted the# Western musical idiom
once and for all. The general public
is not yet receptive to their music, but
at the same time it has lost interest
in traditional music, which now only
has a minority audience. Private con¬
certs are given less and less frequen¬
tly, while radio, television and records
plug the new, heavily westernized
music.
I do not agree with the fatalistic
argument that traditional music is
dying and must soon disappear to
make way for another type of music,
which, though perhaps less authentic,
is more in keeping with the needs of
modern society.
The traditional music of the non-
industrial societies is not "dying" ;
it may be sick, but the thing to do
with a sick man is not to kill him off
or to let him die without trying to cure
his sickness. The present trouble
may turn out to be nothing more than
growing pains if proper steps are
taken straight away.
The re-birth not the survival of
musical traditions is, needless to say,
a problem which requires primarily a
national solution. The cultural and
educational organizations, public and
private, and the governments of Asia
and Africa could improve the teaching
of traditional music, raise the standard
of living of traditional musicians and
reorganize national musical life.
Western countries could, however,
help us in our task of rescuing our
* musical heritage by showing an interest
in our authentic traditional music.
Performers of such music who have
been invited to give concerts in
Western countries enjoy greater
prestige among their compatriots.
The International Music Council and
the International Institute for Compa¬
rative Music Studies and Documenta¬
tion have not only helped the Western
public to appreciate Asian music at
its true worth but have also helped to
restore the confidence of masters of
the art of traditional music in Asia.

BEETHOVEN
TAMES THE JUNGLE
by
Dmitri
Shostakovich



A great Soviet composer
presents his views
on music without frontiers
HE interaction and the play
of mutual influences between the mu¬
sical cultures of West and East, of
peoples brought up in the traditions of
European musical thought and the peo¬
ples of the rest of the world, con¬
stitutes a key factor for the under¬
standing of the evolution of national
musical traditions.
In this connexion, I fully agree with
those who rightly point out how wrong
it is to use the term "developing
countries" with regard to the ancient
and great cultures of the Asian, Afri¬
can and Latin American states. Where¬
as these countries may lag behind
Europe and North America industrially,
it is highly inappropriate to speak of
them patronizingly as "developing" in
the sphere of the arts.
To what extent can the means of
expression accumulated over the cen¬
turies by one people be used or sub¬
ordinated to the artistic norms of
another national culture ? To me the
question of the so-called "incompati¬
bility" of modal and harmonic sys¬
tems, of the "harm or benefit" which
the polyphonic or harmonic devices
characteristic of European music bring
to the cultural heritage of the coun¬
tries of the East, is not entirely clear.
But of one thing I am firmly con¬
vinced, namely the basic equality in
human culture of all the various natio¬
nal musical traditions, the whole rich
fund of melodies, rhythms, timbres and
subtle poetic discoveries created by
folk singers, instrumentalists and pro¬
fessional composers.
To my mind, the point is not the
DMITRI SHOSTAKOVICH Is the world
famous Soviet composer. He has written
more than a dozen symphonies as well as
ballets, operas, chamber music, choral works
and film scores. The article presented here
is an address given by Shostakovich at an
international music congress held in Moscow
in 1971 on traditional and contemporary
music, organized by the International Music
Council and the Soviet National Music Com¬
mittee.
"compatibility" or "incompatibility"
of the various musical systems, but
how and by which methods the prob¬
lem of the interaction and mutual in¬
fluence of the cultures of peoples dif¬
fering from one another ethnically and
geographically is solved.
Here everything depends on the
artistic tact and talent of the people
concerned the composer, performer,
teacher or theoretician their sense of
responsibility to the art and their pro¬
fessional honesty.
They may, of course, encounter
many a stumbling-block. There is
always the great danger of standardi¬
zation, of reducing the musical cul¬
tures of various peoples to the
"average European level".
And one can well understand the
concern of people who are closely in
volved in guiding these processes,
who are connected with training pro¬
fessional musicians for their country,
and who are familiar with all the forms
of propagating music.
One cannot allow of a thoughtless
or, worse still, commercial approach,
a disregard for the great humanist tra¬
ditions of all the peoples of our planet.
Such a course could lead to the des¬
truction of century-old artistic values
and to the burying of one's own natio¬
nal heritage in oblivion.
But nor should one attempt to iso¬
late the art of this or that people from
the natural exchange of creative
achievements between nations, from
the mutual borrowing of elements in
the various systems of musical
thought and musical speech.

Caruso and
Chaliapin:
the centenary
of two
'Mastersingers'
This year the whole world is celebrating the
centenary of the birth of two great singers
the bass Fedor Ivanovich Chaliapin and
the tenor Enrico Caruso. Born at Kazan
(USSR), Chaliapin quickly won inter¬
national fame not only for his stupendous
voice, but also for his skill as an actor which
enabled him to interpret such great roles as
Strauss' Don Quixote (left) and Mussorgsky's
Boris Godunov, on the principal stages of
the world. Caruso was born in Naples
(Italy). The exceptional purity and power of
his voice earned him world-wide acclaim
and a reputation as one of the greatest
tenors of all time. His prestige is still so
great that a London street-musician (right)
can attract an audience merely by advertising
"songs of Caruso".

One of the natural and logical forms
of development of the national tradi¬
tion is not only its direct link with the
life around it, with new social condi¬
tions and the growth of people's
awareness but also its ability to
absorb and enrich itself from every¬
thing that is genuinely progressive in
the ideological and technological
sense, which is created by other tradi¬
tions, sometimes even very remote
ones.
Naturally, this process must take
the form of mutual exchange and not
be imposed from outside. To illustrate
these remarks I should like to men¬
tion a few well-known facts from the
history of Russian music.
Did not Borodin, Balakirev, Mus¬
sorgsky and Rimsky-lKorsakov enrich
their work by turning to individual spe¬
cimens or elements of the folklore of
the peoples of the East? How much
poorer Russian music would be
without Borodin's Polovtsian Dances,
Balakirev's Islamey, Mussorgsky's Per¬
sian Dance and Rimsky-Korsakov's
Scheherazade and many other pages
of Russian music about the East.
And then there is the dedicated
work of a number of Moscow and
Leningrad composers in the Central
Asian republics, where an incredibly
short period of time saw the emer¬
gence of national schools of compo¬
sition using the experience of Russian
and West European music to build their
own national cultures.
The experience, of my country I
have in mind the period after the vic¬
tory of the Great October Revolution
testifies to the fact that the efforts of
several generations of Soviet musi¬
cians to build a musical culture for all
the peoples of the U.S.S.R. were
directed along the right lines.
In order to appreciate the greatness
of this task presented by history it¬
self one must be able to envisage the
vast size of our country and the great
variety of geographical and ethnic con¬
ditions which mould the life and cha¬
racter of its peoples, who speak and
sing in a hundred and five languages.
In the complex process of founding
a musical culture for the Soviet peo¬
ples an important part is played by
Russian classical music and the fine
traditions of the Russian school of
composers. These traditions are
deeply rooted in the everyday life and
culture of the Russian people. They
have been further developed in the
new conditions of socialist life in our
multinational state.
The last thing I should want is that
the development of our musical cul¬
ture composition, performing, teach¬
ing and musicology should appear
to be smooth and entirely free from
contradictions and difficulties. We
have also had our difficulties and mis¬
takes and irritating failures.
Nevertheless I am convinced that
the direction of our searching was and
remains a correct and fruitful one.
This may be seen from the truly his¬
toric accomplishments in the building
of a progressive culture and art in the
Soviet Asian republics which can be
measured by quantitative and, more
importantly, qualitative data of an in¬
disputable kind.
The intensive advance of Soviet
musical culture in breadth, embracing
millions of people in all parts of our
country, has developed and is still

developing in depth, enriching our
lives with bold, truly innovatory finds
and discoveries.
It should suffice to mention here the
name of the great composer Sergei
Prokofiev, who has given a mighty im¬
pulse to the creative searchings of
many composers and performers all
over the world. Another of Prokofiev's
great contributions is his profoundly
original discovery of the riches of Rus¬
sian, and not only Russian, folk music.
I should just like to mention his fine
second string quartet on Kabardinian-
Balkar themes.
The world-famous composer Aram
Khachaturian, who has delved deep
into the music of the Transcaucasian
peoples, has succeeded in using this
basis to create symphonic works
which have greatly influenced the
development, first and foremost,
but not exclusively of his native Ar¬
menian music.
The same can be said of the crea¬
tive role of the talented composer
Kara Karayev who stands at the head
of an interesting and most promising
school of composers in Soviet Azer¬
baijan.
To my mind, those who support
"protective tendencies" with respect
to the musical cultures of non-Euro¬
pean peoples, are somehow ignoring
the realities, the generally recognized
artistic values which have been and,
I am convinced, will be created as a
result of the bold, creative interven¬
tion of the composer in a sphere
which is at first alien to him.
While rejecting the crude repression
of one culture by another and the
views current in the West about cul¬
tural genocide and the implanting of an
alien musical culture, we cannot never¬
theless agree with the appeals for
complete isolation of one musical sys¬
tem from another for the sake of pre¬
serving these cultures in their original
purity.
HhET the Asian and African
peoples who have created a high
culture and a rich original folklore,
develop their art and perfect their
musical speech, but at the same time
let them not close their ears to the
great achievements in the music of
other peoples.
I remember the unforgettable im¬
pression which a certain documentary
left on me. It was a film about the
life of what appeared to be a very
primitive Indian tribe living in an
almost inaccessible area somewhere
in the upper reaches of the Amazon.
There was a really moving scene in
it, where the chief and several of the
tribesmen listened to a tape-record¬
ing of the Beethoven violin concerto.
On the faces of these people, who
had just been shown at work, hunt¬
ing, in their primitive everyday life,
one saw extremely strong emotions
verging on shock. Beethoven was
addressing himself to a person from
another world and that person was lis¬
tening to his speech and understand¬
ing it.
This seems to me to suggest the
following conclusion. Music does not
allow of national limitations and does
not need protective measures aimed
at isolating one culture from another.
On the contrary, what is required
is that countries possessing more
developed means of spreading musi¬
cal culture, highly qualified specialists
and teachers should come to the aid of
peoples who suffered centuries of
colonial rule without the opportunity to
develop their national culture freely.
Of course, this help should not turn
into cultural "aggression". And musi¬
cians who are sincerely concerned
about the fate of music the whole
world over, must try to find a common
language for affirming and preserving
the great cultural values, those which
the peoples of the world have already
created and those which they are sure
to create in the future.

THE ANGEL
OF THE MARACAS
By Alejo Carpentier
Latin American rhythms and
instruments have influenced
the work of every modern
composer
16
ALEJO CARPENTIER of Cuba is not only a
famed novelist whose books have been
translated into 22 languages, but also a
musicologist of repute, author of a book
entitled "La Música en Cuba", and a former
lecturer in music at the Universities of
Havana (Cuba) and Caracas (Venezuela).
His books translated Into English include:
"The Kingdom of this World" (1957), "The
Lost Steps" (1957), "The War of Time" (1958),
all published by Knopf, New York, and
"Explosion in a Cathedral", Little Brown,
Boston, 1963. Formerly Professor of the
History of Music at the Cuban National
Conservatory, Havana, he is at present Coun¬
sellor for Cultural Affairs at the Cuban
Embassy in Paris.

Wearing sumptuous costumes,
Indians in Copacabana (Bolivia)
dance the "Morenada" to cele¬
brate the annual religious fes¬
tival of Candlemas ("Candela¬
ria") on February 2. Though
performed during the carnivals
and religious feasts introduced
by the Spanish, this traditional
dance goes back to pre-Colum¬
bian times. The dancers have
ornate plumed headdresses and
wear crinoline-type costumes
weighing nearly 20 kilogrammes,
. "built" over metal hoops and
embellished with pearls and
glass trinkets. The dancers, car¬
rying hand-bells, execute gra¬
ceful movements despite the
weight and dimensions of their
costumes.
'NE day in the year 1608,
shocking news reached the Cuban
town of Bayamo. The much-loved
bishop, Fray Juan de las Cabezas
Altamirano, had been captured by
Gilbert Giron, French pirate and
marauder of the Caribbean islands,
who was holding him for ransom.
Undaunted by the demand for
money or jewels, the indignant towns¬
men of Bayamo banded together into
an armed militia and set off to deliver
the captive. As a large force was
needed for the rescue operation, they
called upon the help of a negro slave
by the name of Salvador Golomón,
who was renowned for his valour.
During the fighting, Golomón chal¬
lenged the pirate to single combat and
lopped off his head with a well-aimed
stroke of his machete. The plunder¬
ers were put to flight and the victors
returned triumphant amid rejoicing and
celebrations.
A hymn composed specially for the
occasion by a choir master versed in
the art of counterpoint was sung in
honour of the rescued bishop in the
church of Bayamo.
The townsfolk brought out their gui¬
tars and rebecks, their flutes and
fiddles, and held a great ball at which
the sound of European instruments
mingled with the beat of African drums,
maracas and claves, and even some
Indian instruments, among them one
called a tipinagua, which must have
resembled the bell-like instruments
played by Indians throughout the
American continent.
Watching the scene of rejoicing, one
of the citizens, Silvestre de Balboa
(1564-1643?), was fired by poetic ins¬
piration and wrote the magnificent epic
stanzas of his "Mirror of Patience" (a
poem whose hero, for the first time in
history, was a negro, on whom, as the
poet put it, all the gods of Greek
mythology looked down in admiration).
This poem was to be not only one
of the first great texts of Latin Ameri¬
can literature, but was also the first
account of a religious and secular
concert combining all the instrumental
and vocal components that were later
to characterize Latin American music.
It was these qualities which brought
the music of the continent to the fore¬
front of the rich panorama of world
music at the beginning of the present
century.
When Hernán Cortés caught sight
of the coast of Mexico, relates his
companion in arms and future historian
Bernai Díaz del Castillo, the Conquis¬
tador, hoping for fortune in battle,
quoted a romance of the "Carlovingian
cycle", which told of Roland and his
valiant companions.
In 1946, I had the surprising expe¬
rience of hearing the verses mentioned
by Bernai Díaz del Castillo recited by
a Venezuelan folk poet who could
neither read nor write, who had never
left his native region of Barlovento,
and to whom they had been handed
down by oral tradition.
During my childhood, young Cuban
girls still used to dance rounds to
the strange "romance" of Delgadina,
an unfortunate maiden mistreated by
"a Moorish dog and a renegade
mother". This reveals the medieval

origin of verses, dating back to before
the reconquest of the Kingdom of Gra¬
nada, whose extraordinary propagation
throughout the whole of Latin America
has been the subject of intensive
study by Ramón Menéndez Pidal.
We know the names of some of the
musicians guitarists and singers
who accompanied Hernán Cortés on
his fabulous adventure, and we also
known something about a certain Juan
de San Pedro, a trumpeter and musi¬
cian at the court of Charles V, who
settled in Venezuela during the early
years of the 16th century.
Some time between 1530 and 1540,
the music of small portable wooden
organs could be heard in the nave of
the original cathedral of Santiago de
Cuba, which at the time was no more
than a great barn, a vast straw hut
with a roof of palm leaves, and where
the Cuban musician, Miguel Velazquez,
first came into prominence.
We also know that the early evan¬
gelists in the New World brought about
one of the first close associations of
two totally alien cultures by the inge¬
nious device of adapting the words of
Christian liturgical texts to the tradi¬
tional melodies sung by the newly-
colonized Indians.
From there it was but a step to the
full-scale, semi-religious, semi-secular
concert described by the poet Silves¬
tre de Balboa.
At this point, however and this
is already apparent in the "Mirror of
Patience" the religious and the
secular parted company and went their
own separate ways, just as scholarly
and popular music existed side by side
but quite independently of each other
in Europe at that time.
w
18
ITH the construction of
what were becoming real cathedrals,
religious music took the path to Mexico
City, Morelia and Lima, where musi¬
cians were beginning to develop a
polyphonic art with a high degree of
technical virtuosity and were already
producing, in the 17th century, liturgi¬
cal works of great importance.
The churches gradually became real
schools of music : the great polyphonic
works of the Mexican composers
Guerrero and Morales were sung
everywhere, as well as those of the
Cubans Porpera and Marcello, and
especially Pergolesi, whose Stabat
Mater had a "best-seller" success
throughout the continent and exerted
a powerful influence on many Latin
American composers.
This brings us to the 18th century
when, obviously familiar with contem¬
porary developments in European reli¬
gious music, composers evolved from
austere polyphony to a harmonic style
in keeping with the fashionable aesthe¬
tic dictates of the period.
There emerged a new style with
greater freedom of composition, and
which demanded a certain degree of
virtuosity on the part of the performer.
Musicians were carried along by the
current of their own invention and
showed increasing interest in the
melodic aspects of vocal works.
Stringent discipline gave way to a
breath of fresh air from Italy, where
musicians had cast off the shackles of
a certain musical scholasticism. This
new Italy was represented in Argen¬
tina by the Florentine Domenico Zipoli
(1688-1726), who held the office of
organist in Cordoba's Jesuit church
and whose scores, with which choir¬
masters quickly became familiar,
brought to church music new models
and techniques which fell upon recep¬
tive ears.
From this background sprang the
remarkable work of the Cuban Esteban
Salas (1725-1803), choirmaster of the
Cathedral of Santiago de Cuba. In
addition to masses, hymns, canticles,
etc., based on Latin texts, Salas pro¬
duced a hundred or so Villancicos, or
carols, for voices, two violins and
thoroughbass.
These pieces have the unusual cha¬
racteristic for that time of being com¬
posed on somewhat naive but fresh
and lively verses written in Spanish.
(The earliest of Salas' Villancicos we
know of dates from 1783).
In the meantime, popular music was
also evolving. From a mixture of
Spanish ballads, African drums and
Indian instruments came forth the
"devilish sarabands of the Indies"
mentioned by Cervantes and other
great classic Spanish authors such as
Lope de Vega and Góngora.
They were danced in the ports of
Havana, in Cartagena, in Portobello
and Veracruz, in Panama "it comes
from Panama", says Lope de Vega,
describing a son (sonata), which
appears in one of his countless plays.
Here was a mingling of negro
rhythms with "romance" melodies, as
well as an echo of the past in the
Indian sonajeras, as the chronicles
called them, coupled with claves, mara¬
cas, bongos and drums of various
kinds, and simple percussion instru¬
ments, whose most complete and finest
form of expression lies in the extra¬
ordinary Brazilian batucadas.
The inspiration, improvisation and
spontaneous imaginative techniques of
their dynamic rhythm patterns could
be studied to advantage by modern
groups interested in this means of
expression, such as the well-known
"Strasbourg Percussionnists".
When Bizet wrote a habanera into
"Carmen", the word habanera the
music of Havana entered the world's
musical vocabulary. Debussy wrote
part of his Nuit à Grenade to the
rhythm of a habanera, and Ravel used
the same rhythm in the third move¬
ment of his "Spanish Rhapsody".
Erik Satie also amused himself by
putting a habanera into his S/tes Auri¬
culaires.

THE MOOD-MUSIC
OF INDIA
The colour paintings on the following pages
are four miniatures from northern India dating
from about the 1 7th century. They illustrate
a type of Indian music known as ragas. The
raga, meaning "colour," "feeling," is diffi¬
cult to define since the word stands not only
for an infinitely variable combination of
sounds and intervals within a fixed time
scale, but also for the emotion it arouses.
Each raga is conceived with the aim of excit¬
ing and sustaining a particular mood in the
listener and can last from a few minutes to
over two hours. Over the years, ragas have
come to express moods appropriate to differ¬
ent hours of the day and night and these
associations in the Indian mind are indicated
by traditional paintings, such as these en¬
larged miniatures, conveying the essence of
the ragas in pictorial form.

UNESCO & THE WORLD OF MUSIC
I
M was no mere chance that led
Unesco to play an active part in the world of music. On the
contrary, judging that music offered the world a "language without
words" and a vehicle of artistic expression capable of transmitting
a universal message, Unesco's Member States included music
in the organization's world programme from the very start.
Thus, one of the first non-governmental organizations established
under Unesco sponsorship was the International Music Council
(IMC), which celebrates its 25th anniversary during the 1973-74
musical season.
The IMC was allotted the task of studying the development of
music throughout the world and maintaining permanent contact
between Unesco and national and international bodies, including
state radio and television services, concerned with the creative
and educational aspects of music and with its diffusion.
The Council also has a responsibility for promoting contem¬
porary music and encouraging the spread of knowledge of tradi¬
tional music of all cultures. Thus the preservation of non-western
musical forms is an important feature in its projects and programme
in which it aims to cover all aspects of music.
Jazz and the more recent phenomenon of "pop" music are signs
of the beginnings of a profound upheaval affecting the whole field
of musical creativity. Realizing the importance of this musical
revolution, Unesco has undertaken a number of studies of the
increasingly popular new musical forms and the instruments musi¬
cians are and will be using, as well as of the sociological back¬
ground against which the musical forms of today are born and
flourish.
It is in this context that the meetings of music experts organized
by Unesco are held. The first of these meetings, which took
place at Yaounde (Cameroon) in February 1970, was devoted
to the study of musical traditions in Africa South of the Sahara
and gave a new insight into many aspects of traditional African
music, particularly with regard to its evolution and dissemination
(see article by Akin Euba page 24). The findings of this meeting
have been published in English under the title "African Music"
by "La Revue Musicale", Paris, 1972.
A second meeting organized by Unesco at Stockholm, in
June 1970, examined a question which preoccupies most musicians
today the relationship between the arts and technology. The
papers and reports presented at this meeting have also been
published in English under the title "Music and Technology" by
"La Revue Musicale", Paris, 1971. Latin American music was the
subject of a third meeting held in Caracas (Venezuela), in Novem¬
ber 1971, at which experts drew up a systematic study plan
covering traditional music, avant-garde music and musique concrète.
Another Unesco initiative in this same context is the series of
records issued under the general title of the "Unesco Collection".
These records are produced in collaboration with the International
Institute for Comparative Music Studies, a cultural organization
established In Venice in 1970 with among its aims the production
of recordings of the highest technical quality of the top musicians
and groups of the various musical cultures of Africa and the East.
The Unesco Collection (see pages 36 and 39) now includes
two anthologies and two series of records prepared for the IMC
and Unesco by the International Institute for Comparative Music
Studies. Another series, produced since 1972, forms an exten¬
sion and sequel to the musical "Rostrums" organized by the
International Music Council.
The two anthologies, both issued under the Bärenreiter-Musica-
phon label, consist of record albums accompanied by commenta¬
ries and illustrations which open the way to the study of the tradi¬
tional music of several countries of Africa and the Orient. "A
Musical Anthology of the Orient" includes music from Afghanistan,
China, India, Iran, Japan, the Khmer Republic, Laos, Malaysia,
Tunisia, Turkey, the U.S.S.R. and Viet-Nam ; An Anthology of
African Music" includes music from the Central African Republic,
Chad. Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Rwanda.
The "Musical Sources" series, issued under the Philips label,
covers music of the world's most ancient civilizations and includes
recordings of Arab music and music from Bali, Egypt, northern
India, Iran, Israel, Java, the Khmer Republic, Korea and Tibet.
The second series, "Musical Atlas", consists of recordings of
living folk music still played in certain communities throughout
the world. Issued by Odeon-EMI Italiana, if includes music from
Bengal, Ivory Coast, the Khmer Republic and Portugal.
Contemporary music is catered for by the International Rostrum
of Composers, initiated in 1954 by the IMC in collaboration with
Unesco, which holds annual meetings attended by representatives
of radio stations to encourage the exchange of contemporary music.
Delegates from the radio organizations of 34 countries took part
in the 1971 Rostrum and each radio station undertook to select
and broadcast during the 1971-72 music season at least six of
the 89 contemporary works presented at the Rostrum.
Since 1972, the Rostrum has given rise to a new series of
recordings in the Unesco Collection entitled "Contemporary
Music" (see page 36).
The International Rostrum of Young Interpreters, organized by
the IMC in collaboration with Unesco, and from 1973 to be held
annually, is designed to help young performers in their careers
by presenting them in person before leaders in the world of
music, opera, radio, television, etc. The 1972 Rostrum was held
in Bratislava (Czechoslovakia) as part of the Bratislava Music
Festival. A new Unesco series of recordings Is to be based on
these Rostrums.
Two other Rostrums, organized by the IMC, Unesco and the
International Institute for Comparative Music Studies, are held in
alternate years.
The Asian Music Rostrum, created in 1969, brings together
representatives of Asian radio stations to listen to and exchange
authentic traditional music of their countries and to make it known
in other regions of the world. Eight countries were represented
at the 1971 Rostrum held at Unesco's Paris headquarters Hong
Kong, India, Indonesia, Irak, Japan, Jordan, Korea and the U.S.S.R.
The African Music Rostrum, inaugurated in 1970, also aims to
enlist the help of radio stations to make the authentic traditional
music of the various musical cultures of Africa known throughout
the world. The last session was held in Venice in 1972.
THER international musical events
and meetings, such as the International Music Congress organized
by the IMC, are held throughout the year. The theme of the 1971
International Music Congress, held in Moscow in collaboration
with the Soviet National Music Committee, was "The musical
cultures of peoples: traditional and contemporary." One of the
participants at this Congress was the world-famous Soviet compo¬
ser Dmitri Shostakovich who spoke on national musical traditions
and the laws of their development (see article page 13).
To mark the 25th anniversary of its foundation by Unesco,
the IMC is to hold a series of musical events in Switzerland,
beginnning In September 1973 and continuing into 1974, which are
being organized in co-operation with Unesco and the Swiss
National Music Committee.
A predominant place will . be reserved for works and artists
selected at the four IMC Rostrums. The theme of the first part
of the Symposium at Geneva will be "In search of a new musical
public, approached from the double angle of musical 'animation'
for youth and the presentation of music by the audio-visual media".
Unesco's programme also includes plans for a musical workshop,
to be held in 1974, bringing together musicians from Europe and
Asia. At the same time studies on musical education and the
relation between "pop" music and youth will be undertaken in
collaboration with the Fédération Internationale des Jeunesses
Musicales and the International Institute for Music, Dance and
Theatre in Vienna. Finally, Unesco's programme provides for the
award of study and travel scholarships to musicians and musical
specialists.
Music, then, is accorded the important place it merits in AA
Unesco's cultural programme. For some countries the problem IÄ
of music is one of preserving and encouraging an art; for others
the preservation and promotion of music is bound up with the
whole problem of national development.

Research of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corp¬
oration and Lecturer in Music at the Univ¬

Fellow in Musicology at the University of
Ife. His essays on music have been publish¬
ed in the "International Folk Music Council
Journal", "Nigeria Magazine", "Africa Report'
and "Odu". Akin Euba has written three large-
scale compositions based on elements of
African traditional music: "Four Pieces for
African Orchestra", "Chaka", a setting of
Leopold Senghor's- dramatic poem, and
'Dirges", a setting of poems by African
authors, for speakers, singers, Instrumen¬
talists and pre-recorded African music. The
article presented here Is based on a paper
prepared for a meeting organized by Unesco
on "Musical Traditions of Africa South of
the Sahara", held in Yaounde, Cameroon, in
February 1970.
O the casual observer it
might appear that, in face of powerful
influences from the Western world,
traditional African music has lost its
meaning in contemporary Africa.
Yet most Africans continue to live
according to traditional patterns of
culture and maintain their traditional
music which forms their primary
experience of musical art. It is only
in urbanized Africa that cosmopolitan
culture is so predominant and Western
music so much in evidence.
Among those Africans who have
received a Western education and
whose pattern of existence exposes
them to various aspects of Western
culture, musical taste is of two kinds.
A small minority have cultivated a taste
for the more contemplative forms of
Western music classical and sacred
(and jazz); the vast majority have little
interest in any kind of music except
"pop".
I do not believe that Africans who
have forsaken African for Western
music did so because of artistic
values; it is only that most of them
were born outside the tradition of
African musical culture and are only
vaguely aware of the elements that
make it so important to its practitioners.
Assuming an equal education in both
types of music, those who are most
sensitive to the highest music in their
own culture would probably also be
those who respond to what is best in
a foreign culture. Hence, there is little
danger of Africans, if adequately
educated musically, abandoning their
traditional musical culture when heavily
exposed to Western music.
The reasons for a possible domina¬
tion of African music by Western must
therefore be sought elsewhere.
Africans qualified in Western music
are materially better off than prac-

titioners of African traditional music.
A first class concert pianist can earn
more by a single recital than an equally
gifted traditional musician could hope
to make in a year. African "pop"
musicians not only receive much
higher fees, but get their music
recorded and broadcast as standard
fare on local radio stations.
A taste for Western music implies
acquiring a taste for other aspects of
Western culture also. For the average
contemporary African, a good Western
education opens the way to important
jobs and social influence, and this
explains why an African master-
drummer will encourage his son to
spend his time acquiring one rather
than spend it becoming a master-
drummer.
One of the success symbols in
Africa today is a big radiogram

an intent to listen. Whatever the
owner's feelings towards traditional
music, most of his records will
inevitably contain music that is non-
African or at best neo-traditional
popular African; if he wants African
music records he must probably seek
them abroad.
A radiogram owner is a music
patron, contributing to the popularity
of the musicians who get recorded.
In the past, African chiefs were,
financially, the most influential indi¬
vidual patrons of traditional musical
art. But today, financial influence has
passed from them to the radiogram
owners whose musical tastes how¬
ever traditional before have now been
affected by the only records that are
on sale.
Technological advance is now a
basic aim of African societies. Does
technological development automati¬
cally spell doom for a non-technologi¬
cal art culture? So far, the parameters
have largely been determined in
Europe and America: is modern
technology feasible in Africa without
a total conversion to Euro-American
standards? African traditional music
is bound up with African traditional
social life; if the latter becomes
westernized, can the music retain its
characteristic identity, survive in a new
social context?
m OR some scholars, mean¬
ing in African music is bound up into
the functions music serves in society;
the frequency with which it is
integrated with non-musical activities
has led to generalizations about its
utilitarian functions with the implica¬
tion that it is meaningless outside its
specific social context.
There is, however, a second
category of listener, little concerned
with scientific analysis, much more
interested in the "soul" of the music.
That he does derive some satisfaction,
however incomplete, from African
music, suggests that this music,
removed from its social contexts, is
not entirely meaningless.
However, for the listener not in
touch with the context ¡n which its
music is customarily performed, and
who hears it purely as music, a
knowledge of the speech language of
the ethnic group to which the piece
belongs would be crucial to an under¬
standing of the musical language.
For those who watch musicians
perform, the visual impression adds
an artistic side, a dramatic element
that complements the musical element
with a dimension that Is lacking for a
listener who is not actually present.
He who sees as well as hears is
closer to a correct interpretation of
the music's meaning, but only that
much closer, for the total meaning of
the music in relation to the context
cannot be realized by the observer but
only by the participants.
Musical meaning in African tra¬
ditional culture can thus be of different
shades, ranging from the purely tonal
through the linguistic to the socio-
dramatic. Lacking its socio-dramatic
associations, part of its meaning is
missing, but, purely as music, it could
not fail to have meaning for musical
ears partial but intense, and including
aspects which are unimportant or
imperceptible to the average African
listener.
People unfamiliar with African
traditional music, and hearing it out
of context, sometimes find it too
repetitive. But the more clearly the
listener can understand the music's
function, the less is likely to be his
irritation, until he eventually realizes
that repetition is one of the primary
aids the music utilizes in order to
fulfil its purpose.
Contact with Western culture has
introduced a few African musicians to
the idea of composing music meant
just to be listened to, an approach
that may spread in an increasingly
technological Africa as former social
values break down and music sep¬
arates from the context that hitherto
has provided much of its impetus.
Some fear that, in such a situation,
African traditional music may cease to
exist.
Music, of course, cannot live with¬
out new creative forces to sustain it
through changing social circumstances.
But will the African creative genius,,
which has in the past survived so¬
cial change, now become unproductive
in the atmosphere of contemporary
society?
Should traditional music lose its
present social context it should not
be too difficult for it to transform and
become a purely contemplative art-
form. The way is already open, even
if Africans do not customarily listen
contemplatively.
The music may lean very heavily
on poetry whose "real" meaning
is invariably one or more steps
removed from the literal meanings of
individual words and sentences, a sym¬
bol for something else. But even if
we fail to grasp this "real" meaning,
the music may still convey artistic
feeling.
'NE of the challenges to
the contemporary composer in Africa
today is how to carry the essentials
of this poetical sense in African music
over into musical settings of modern
African poetry in non-African langua¬
ges.
Experiments by Senghor and others
in the use of African traditional in¬
struments to accompany recitals of
African poetry in European languages
foreshadow new creative openings.
Again, in Wole Soyinka's plays, texts
spoken in English are juxtaposed with
texts in Yoruba, sung and accom¬
panied in the traditional style of
Yoruba music.
The challenge has been thrown
down by the writers. It remains for
the composers to work towards a
total fusion of non-African speech with
African musical language. The prob¬
lems are immense. African traditional
song composition is conditioned by
the nature of African tone-languages,
and would seem incompatible with
European song.
But although speech meaning in
European languages is only partially
conditional upon tonal considerations,
there are possibilities as for exam¬
ple in the sprechgesang (intoned
speech) compositions of Arnold
Schoenberg of making an artistic use
of the speech tonality of European
languages. African music also utilizes
speech-song, and this might provide a
basis for a co-ordination of cultural
styles setting African literature in
European languages to an African
musical idiom.
The way in which African traditional
music may gradually accomodate itself
for contemplative listening can be seen
in African-language plays written for
the modern theatre. The music fol¬
lows traditional music styles and even
borrows from the existing repertoire.
These plays are really transposi¬
tions of traditional music and drama
from their social context into the con¬
text of the modern theatre and are

thereby a direct evolution from the mu-
sico-dramatic art of traditional culture.
Their success and increasing popula¬
rity are sufficient to justify the view
that traditional music can survive on
its own terms, away from the cus¬
tomary social context.
The ultimate result may be a music
which exists in its own right, devoid
of visual connotations. But if the new
African composers are to maintain
contact with local audiences, they
must approach abstract creativity in
stages and take advantage of the
opportunities offered by the combina¬
tion of music with drama in the con¬
temporary African theatre.
They can learn much by collaborat¬
ing with dramatists and choreogra¬
phers to produce stage versions of
typical scenes from traditional culture,
such as ceremonies pertaining to
chieftaincy, marriage and birth rites.
The dramatic intensity of these events
in their real-life contexts transposes
very well to the stage, where the
events assume an artistic meaning
that is little apparent in real life.
HE components of the new
musical art will be essentially those
which constitute traditional music as
we know it, but re-combined in a new
way and accordingly an extension of
traditional culture. For example, re¬
petition, although retained, will prob¬
ably be subdued or camouflaged.
An instrument that hitherto repeat¬
ed the same pattern continuously may
now share the pattern with other in¬
struments repetition certainly but with
shifting timbres. And, instead of allow¬
ing the leading instrument of an
ensemble, and it alone, to play varia¬
tions, several instruments might be
allowed to share this rôle, simultane¬
ously or alternatively.
Instruments found within one ethnic
group can be classified in broad
general families but otherwise are not
shared with other ethnic groups and,
.even within the same ethnic group,
are commonly designated for specific
functions (a condition which deter¬
mines the patterns of orchestral
groupings).
By doing away with such reserva¬
tions and developing an orchestral
technique that freely combines in¬
struments from his own and other
ethnic groups, the modern African
composer can create a varying texture
of instrumental timbres to sustain the
new music.
Geographically, Western music is
widespread in the world today not
because of any inherent superiority,
but because the West has developed
superior communications. Phonograph,
tape-recorder, radio and television
were all perfected in Western coun¬
tries which still largely retain a mono¬
poly of their use.
Africans now have access to these
media, but even within Africa, gramo¬
phone records circulated through wes¬
tern channels are likely to reach a
wider African public than if circulated
through African companies.
In Nigeria, for example, most re¬
cording companies are controlled from
overseas, and the records of Nigerian
music they produce are those that will
fetch the quickest returns locally. The
record-buying public is concentrated in
the cities who prefer neo-traditional
or westernized popular music.
If these companies ever publish
records of classical traditional music
this will most likely be due to pressure
from non-African musicologists who
have done research in Nigeria. Such
records seldom find their way back to
Nigeria along the normal channels
(i.e. those through which western
music is distributed).
Admittedly, records can effectively
convey only the sound of the music,
whereas much African music can best
be presented through audio-visual
media. Those wanting to hear African
music once had to be present at the
place of performance, but with the
increasing need for communication
across the whole continent, new
modes must supplement and extend
those that hitherto served.
Records and radio provide excel¬
lent media in cases where the visual
aspects are not so important; where
the visual elements are integrally re¬
lated to the rest (a majority of cases,
apparently), television and cinema are
the most effective media. At present,
neither is sufficiently utilized for tradi¬
tional music.
Ministries and agencies concerned
with Africans arts must establish well-
defined projects and considerably step
up the production of films of African
music, calling in the aid of music¬
ology, choreology, anthropology and
other disciplines to help the film tech¬
nicians to' produce films that capture
the essential spirit of the music.
Given the effort and outlay, such films
should be given the widest possible
distribution throughout Africa, with
adequate facilities to enable sponsor¬
ing organizations to exchange films.
UBLICATION of scores is
also important. The transcription of a
musical art that has no tradition of
notation presents many difficulties,
notably that of creating national sym¬
bols to convey the peculiar nuances
of African musical sounds.
But if contemporary Africans are to
become knowledgeable about African
music they must be able to study it
without having to hear it directly from
its exponents; hence the vital impor¬
tance of the printed score, in combina¬
tion with recorded sound.
Improved techniques for making
African traditional music better known
should not overlook contemporary
music. African audiences should be
familiar from the start with new dev¬
elopments in the music of their cul¬
ture, for they have a rôle to play in
shaping the new tradition.
Contemporary African composers
trained in western musical institutes
are now producing music which, using
African elements in a western idiom,
can be classified as Africanized Wes¬
tern. This is a welcome new addi¬
tion, but does not represent a true
evolution from the African main¬
stream and should not be taken as the
main trend in African contemporary
music.
Most African musicians are working
with traditional means and several
new composers have been experiment¬
ing with new ways of employing them.
As African societies become more and
more technological, African traditio¬
nal music may become less utilitarian
and increasingly contemplative. It is
also likely, however, that the new
music will not necessarily replace the
music we now regard as traditional,
and that both forms will coexist.
African music has survived previous
eras of social change because it had
and has enough creative vitality to fl
adapt itself to changing circumstan- ^ '
ces; there is no reason to suppose
that it will not continue to do so.

LET THE TRUMPETS SOUND...
In Tibetan music, wind instru¬
ments play a predominant role.
Invariably played in pairs, they
symbolize the eternal links bet¬
ween Knowledge and Method,
between Male and Female, or
the voices of peaceful and hos¬
tile divinities. The instruments
are usually made of copper
and silver, sometimes embellish¬
ed with precious stones. Pho¬
tos show from left to right: short
trumpets, oboes, long trumpets
resting on a support represent¬
ing a supernatural being, and
telescopic horns which can be
extended to enormous lengths
(up to four metres).

Cymbals and trumpets

wind instruments weave a majestic
pattern of sound, punctuated and sus¬
tained by the percussion, drawing the
listener on towards distant, unexplored
musical horizons.
Disconcerting though the music is,
even the layman cannot fail to recog¬
nize in it a strict order and discipline
which leaves nothing to chance. What
we are listening to is the ancient
Buddhist music of Tibet, brought to
us by the magic of the gramophone.
Tibet, the region of China that is
often called "the roof of the world", is
the cradle of an astonishing civilization.
It lies at altitudes varying between
10,000 and 23,000 feet and its only
relatively hospitable region is a plateau
some 13,000 feet up between the peaks
of the Himalayas and the trans-
Himalayas.
These geographical details throw
an interesting light on some aspects
of Tibetan culture. Before the con¬
struction of roads and the modern¬
ization of Tibet carried out by the
Chinese during the 1950s, it took
months, even a year, for a caravan
from Peking to reach Lhasa the capita!.
Yet over the centuries Tibetan cul¬
ture was enriched and influenced by
other civilizations. Whilst the ethni¬
cally mixed population remained cha¬
racteristically Mongol, the country had
contacts to the west with India, Iran
and even Greece, to the north with
the Turko-Mongol peoples, to the east
with the Han civilization of China, and
to the south, north and east with
peoples among whom the Buddhist
tradition was. already established
Nepal, Khotan and Yunnan.
Buddhism reached Tibet during the

seventh and eighth centuries. It came
from northern India and was steeped
in tantrism (from the Sanskrit word
tantra, meaning warp, originally of a
fabric, later "doctrine" or "rule"). In
Tibet, it gradually replaced the old
shamanistic local religion known as
Pön, which, in a variety of forms, had
spread throughout Central Asia from
the Eastern marches of Iran to China.
Pön was not unconnected with tan¬
trism, with the result that tantrism,
Pön and Buddhism mingled, and also
absotbed the ancient Tibetan religion
called the "religion of men" (as against
the "religion of the gods"), thus giving
Tibetan Buddhism its own particular
character.
This tantric Buddhism which spread
throughout the Himalayan countries
outside Tibet itself Nepal, Bhutan,
Sikkim and Kaddak (see "Unesco
Courier" February 1969) as well as
certain parts of West Bengal and
India was to produce one of the
most original forms of music to emerge
anywhere in the world. Today, thanks
to the gramophone record, this music,
or fragments of it at least, may be
heard far from its land of birth.
The origins and history of Tibetan
Buddhist music have not yet been
explored to the full. The facts given
here are based on material gathered
during eight months' research in Nepal.
Tibetan Buddhist music, extremely
subtle and complex, is indissociable
from the ancient traditions which give
it its full significance, a music with an
essentially spiritual purpose. Whether
vocal or instrumental, it demands not
only a perfect knowledge of the orally-
transmitted texts but a high degree of
virtuosity.
Being closely linked with religion, it
plays a leading part in the life of the
monastic community. The lamaseries,
or monasteries, are thus schools of
music where monk-musicians receive
training of an advanced level, form
vocal and instrumental groups, and
preserve an original art form with its
own carefully codified system of
expression.
The instruments used (wind and per¬
cussion alike) are of mixed local and
foreign origin. Some come from India,
as for example the great white conch-
shell trumpet, dung kar, which is
fished in the waters off the east coast
of Hindustan. This is the instrument
which, according to the great Hindu
religious classic, the Bhagavad Gita,
emits "that awesome noise which
shakes heaven and earth"; its player
needs an unfailing ear and lungs of
steel. The handbell and the hour¬
glass drum the damaru of Shiva
are also Indian.
Other instruments appear to be Tibe¬
tan in origin, for instance the kang
ling, a trumpet made of a human shin-
bone, and the chö dar, an hour-glass
drum made of two human skulls, to
the "waist" of which are attached
thongs with strikers at the ends.
Iranian influence, direct or indirect,
via India, is present in a form of oboe,
the rgya-gling, and Chinese influence
in that of cymbals. It is difficult to
say where the other instruments came
from, but it seems likely that Tibetan
Buddhist music, like Tibetan Buddism
itself, picked up elements from various
sources, while retaining certain ancient
characteristics particular to Tibetan
civilization.
In a tradition so steeped in religion
as is Tibetan music, it is not always
easy to define exactly what is meant
by religious music. The great national
epic of Tibet, recounting the exploits
of the King and magic hero, Gesar of
Ling, and sometimes called the "Iliad
of Central Asia", as well as the secular
drama of Lhamo, for instance, contain
numerous important religious elements,
while even many folk songs are
directly inspired by religious themes.
Here, the term religious music is
used to mean what in Tibetan is
known as rolmo : the vocal or instru¬
mental music accompanying various
rituals. Performed exclusively by
monks, as already pointed out, it is
distinguishable from the other Tibetan
musical traditions by its vocal tech¬
nique, the instruments used, the rules
which it obeys, and its symbolism.
It is performed both inside the
monastery and outside. Inside, it
accompanies religious ceremonies,
particularly in the prayer halls, and
sometimes, for certain rites, in the
courtyard. It is played as a signal
for the lamas to begin their medita¬
tion in their cells or to make offerings
to certain divinities, in the latter case
being played on the roof of the monas¬
tery so that the sound carries far.

CYMBALS AND TRUMPETS (Continued)
Outside the monastery, it is perform¬
ed in private homes for births, mar¬
riages, deaths or other special occa¬
sions, or because someone wishes to
gain "merit" so as to obtain a better
reincarnation. It is also played in
processions, or to welcome eminent
visitors. Musicians practise outside the
monastery, as the sound of the instru¬
ments, most of which are very loud,
might disturb the other monks at their
prayers or studies.
The music is also played, outside the
monastery or in the courtyard, as an
accompaniment to the cham, masked
religious dances performed only by
the monks and representing, with
comic episodes, the triumph of
Buddhism over the older Tibetan
religion.
The orchestras consist only of wind
or percussion instruments. The for¬
mer include, in addition to the conch
and the shin-bone trumpet already
mentioned, copper or silver trumpets,
horns of the same metals measuring
up to twelve feet long, and a kind of
long, conical oboe.
The percussion instruments include
two types of cymbals, one bearing the
same name, rolmo, as the ritual reli¬
gious music, two gongs of different
sizes, a kettledrum which may be as
much as six feet across, a smaller
upright drum played with a sickle-
shaped stick, the two drums already
referred to the chö dar (Tibetan)
and the damaru (Indian) a handbell,
and the ting sha, two metal discs on
a string.
In the bigger monasteries, other,
less common instruments were some¬
times used : a long, telescopic horn
fitting into another giant horn which
impressively amplified its sound,
various other huge horns, a side-blown
flute, gongs and an enormous bell.
30
EVERYTHING about this
music, the instruments and the sounds
they make, is laden with symbolism.
According to certain monastic trad¬
itions, the sound of the trumpets
symbolizes the voices of certain
aggressive divinities, whilst the oboes
represent those of peaceable divinities.
In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the
Bardo Thödol, the parallel is drawn
between the sounds of the instruments
and the inner sounds which only cer¬
tain lamas who have attained great
proficiency in the practice of medita¬
tion can hear a spiritual exercise in
which auditory perception replaces
vision. The handbell symbolizes both
wisdom (or knowledge) and the sacred
power of the word. The shape of the
bell, seen from above, recalls that of
the mándala the geometrical figure
representing the nature of the world.
Even the orchestration is dictated
by the symbolic relationship between
the instruments and the divinities.
Peaceful divinities such as Dolma and
the Buddha himself are associated
with the oboes, conchs and cymbals,
and the warlike divinities, whose func¬
tion is to defend truth and to extermi¬
nate hostile spirits, with the short
trumpet and the smaller rolmo cym¬
bals, while horns and drums are asso¬
ciated with both.
It is usually the leader of the orches¬
tra who plays the cymbals, on which
the relationship between the parts
played by the various instruments lar¬
gely depends. It is also the leader
who conducts the ceremony, the sing¬
ing and recitation of prayers, and sets
the tempo of the performance.
The more important the occasion,
the slower the tempo is, and its varia¬
bility may even effect the oboe melody
line. The oboe players must learn to
try and work out, for a particular
tempo, on what note they have to
stop as the piece comes to an end,
and how long to hold a particular note
in order to finish with the rest of the
orchestra. As a result, no two perfor¬
mances are quite alike, and this mix¬
ture of strictness and flexibility, pre¬
cise rules and improvization, is a cha¬
racteristic feature of Tibetan music.
In the books of certain religious
orders, there are special signs to show
where the instruments come in, signs
which incidentally change from one
monastery to another, while for some
instruments oboe, hour-glass drum
and handbells there is no form of
notation.
The special type of vocal music
known as yang also has its own nota¬
tion, contained in the yang-yin (books
of special prayers) and often varying
from one book to the next. The nota¬
tion indicates not so much the pitch
as the volume, which varies within a
very limited range, and also certain
details of voice production. Red ink
is sometimes used to indicate the
parts to be sung solo by the monk
in charge of the ceremony.
Tibetan Buddhist musical notation
would in fact be virtually undeciphe¬
rable if it were not for the oral tradi¬
tion, and it leaves large areas of
music uncovered, being intended only
as a mnemonic device and to a lesser
degree as an aid to the learner.
In the yang style of singing a
continuous melodic line the voices
are deep and guttural, and the sylla¬
bles of the text are chanted very
slowly. It is this chanting which, per¬
haps even more than the orchestral
accompaniment, produces even in the
casual listener the extraordinary
impression of entering an unfamiliar
world, transcending that of the senses ;
for yang, as a Tibetan commentary
explains, aims to communicate with
the gods, and the manner in which one
communicates with gods is not the
same as that in which one communi¬
cates with men.
But there is nothing haphazard about
this singular style : everything is subor¬
dinate to rules which demand of the
performer the utmost skill. From
childhood the singers practise produc¬
ing sounds as low and guttural as
possible.
II N some monasteries, this
modification of the human voice is
carried to lengths which seem to verge
on the impossible. This practice is
probably connected with the tantric
belief that the deeper the sound, the
more " immaterial", the closer to
silence it is. The surprising result is
that the voice thus produces harmonics
at the same time as the basic note,
so that each singer becomes, as it
were, a "one-man choir".
This technique, however, is not
exclusively Tibetan ; it is to be found
also in Mongolia and in certain parts
of Siberia.
This musical phenomenon is not
constructed on a particular set of more
or less homogeneous concepts, but
appears to spring direct from the
actual art of musical performance,
which is itself intimately bound up with
religious theory.
Tibetan Buddhist music, however,
pays little attention to aesthetic theory,
but is on the other hand inseparable
from the idea of a consummate artistry
which obeys the established rules,
demands an unfailing musical sense,
and manifests itself in the quality of
vocal and instrumental sound and in
the fine balance between the two.
For the monks, the music is a means
of spiritual expression and is played
only for the gods. The fact that the
musician, though conscious of the
essentially "celestial" nature of the
music, takes a professional pride and
interest in it, does not conflict with the
nature of the music, but on the con¬
trary ensures that the tradition, though
essentially religious in inspiration and
ultimate purpose, survives on earth.

ON THE DELIGHTS
AND PLEASURES
OF MUSIC
Reflections, of a 10th century
Islamic philosopher
1,1 00 years ago. one of Islam's greatest philosophers. Mohammed Abu
Nasr al-Farabi, was born in ancient Transoxiana (today the Soviet
Turkmen Republic in central Asia). Writer, mathematician and astrono¬
mer, al-Farabi died in Damascus (Syria) in 850, having profoundly
influenced the cultural, artistic and scientific development of the Islamic
world. Al-Farabi, considered by many persons almost on a level with
the great Avicenna, was also a famed musical theoretician. We are
pleased to present, translated into English for the first time, a passage
from his celebrated "Treatise on Music".
by
Mohammed
Abu Nasr al-Farabi
HERE are three different
kinds of music. The first merely gives
pleasure, the second expresses and
gives rise to emotions, and the third
stimulates our imagination. Natural
melody (music) is that which as a rule
brings about in men one of these three
effects, whether it invariably affects all
men, or almost always most of them
in this way. The most natural music
is that with the greatest universality
of effect.
Music which brings us sensations of
pleasure is best suited to moments of
repose ; it provides restful entertain¬
ment. Music which provokes emotion
is played when we wish to cause
someone to act under the influence of
a particular passion or desire to instil

OF MUSIC (Continued)
in him a frame of mind dominated by
a specific emotion. Music which stimu¬
lates the imagination serves to en¬
hance poetry and certain other forms
of oratory, where the effect of the
words is accentuated by a musical
accompaniment.
The first type of music, that which
produces a pleasant effect, can also
give rise to emotions, and as in the
case of the music intended to produce
emotion, it can also stimulate the ima¬
gination. We have shown in other
treatises the manner in which emo¬
tions sharpen the attention and whet
the imagination. And when the words
of a poem are accompanied by pleas¬
ant music, they have a greater hold
over the listener's attention.
The music which most nearly attains
perfection is that which possesses at
one and the same time the three qual¬
ities of which we have just spoken.
Its effect upon us is similar to that of
poetry, although less complete, for it
fulfils only partially the function of
poetry.
When adapted to a poem, the music
will have a more powerful effect and
the words will in their turn have greater
force of expression. The most per¬
fect, excellent and effective music is
therefore that which possesses each
of the qualities we have named. Al¬
though instrumental music can have a
number of them, only the music of the
human voice possesses all these
qualities.
Talent in musical execution is hence
of two orders : one relates to the exe¬
cution of the perfect melodies produced
by the human voice, and the other to
the playing of musical instruments.
The latter order is subdivided accord¬
ing to the nature of the instrument in
question, whether it is a lute, a lyre
or another resonant instrument of the
same kind.
Sung music can also be divided into
different categories according to the
type of poetry to which the melodies
are applied and depending upon the
result desired. Different types of
talent are required for singing a ballad,
a lamentation or an elegy, just as for
the intoned delivery of a poem or any
other form of vocal art. The hida, or
camel-drivers' song, demands another
kind of skill.
Instrumental music provides res¬
ponses to song inasmuch as it is
capable of imitating the human voice.
It is used to accompany the voice, to
enrich it, or to serve as a prelude or
an interlude. The interlude allows the
singer to rest ; it also completes the
music by expressing whatever is
beyond vocal possibilities.
There exists another type of instru¬
mental music, whose conception is
such that it is difficult to make it imi¬
tate perfect (vocal) music, and it can
be of no assistance to the latter.
This kind of music can be compared
to a decorative design whose lines
do not represent any form of reality
but are simply pleasing to the eye.

by Romain Goldron, Editions Rencontre, Lausanne, 1365
Examples of music of this kind are the
tarayiq and rawashin of Khurasan and
Persia, whose sound no human voice
can reproduce.
As we have pointed out, this type of
music lacks certain elements of per¬
fection, and in listening to it one seeks
those which are missing. In the end
it becomes wearisome and irritating
to the ear, whose demand remains
unsatisfied. Music of this style should
only be used to educate the ear, or
for the purpose of practising the art
of playing musical instruments : it can
also serve as a prelude or interlude
to a sung melody.
It is by virtue of natural, innate apti¬
tudes instinctive to man that he is
capable of composing and creating
music. Among these aptitudes let us
mention man's bent for poetry, the
instinct which drives him to produce
certain sounds when he feels joyful
and other sounds when in pain or
sorrow.
We must also mention the instinct
which causes him to seek rest after
hard work, and to find a way of divert¬
ing his thoughts from the fatigue of
his labours. For music possesses the
gift of absorbing our attention and
dispelling the weariness caused by
work. It casts from our mind all notion
of the time spent at a task, and helps
us to endure and withstand the fati¬
gue it produces.
Indeed, the notion of time calls to
mind the fatigue engendered by move¬
ment for is not time an essential
element of movement, just as, in fact,
movement is an element of time ?
Since fatigue is caused by movement
and time is inextricably linked to move¬
ment, loss of the notion of time also
means loss of the notion of fatigue.
It is also claimed that singing has
an influence upon animals ; this is
borne out by the hida, the song of
the Arabian camel-drivers, which
affects the behaviour of their beasts.
So much for musical inspiration.
Let us now consider the way in which
the various branches of instrumental
and vocal music came into being.
Music has grown into a science, thanks
to those innate aptitudes and instincts
we have mentioned.
People have sung to achieve pleas¬
ant sensations or relaxation, to forget
their weariness and to lose all notion
of time. Others have sought to height¬
en or to dispel an emotion or a state
of mind, to alter or intensify it, to
forget or find appeasement for it.
Others yet have used singing to give
greater force of expression to their
poetry and to stimulate still further
the imagination of the listener.
For all of these reasons men in
early times began to take pleasure in
humming, singing and the vocal arts,
and gradually throughout the ages,

from one generation to the next, from
one people to another, musical works
increased in abundance.
Especially gifted men acquired a
talent for composing music of all the
three types we have described. Each
one sought to surpass his predeces¬
sors and their determined perseve¬
rance in their work led them to great
fame. Among their followers were
those who, unable to compose original
music, produced imitations of the works
of their precursors while perfecting
certain technical aspects ; others
possessed a talent for composition,
drawing inspiration from the works of
their predecessors and contributing to
the enrichment of the art of music.
In this way musicians followed on
from each other, and their art was
handed from people to people from
one .generation to the next throughout
the ages. In the process, the distinc¬
tions between the three types of music
eventually became blurred until they
finally blended and merged into each
other.
It was recognized that if the aim
was, for example, to stimulate or soothe
a given emotion, the most satisfactory
means of doing so was to use music
that would achieve the desired effect,
adding some notes to produce a
pleasant sensation and others to excite
the imagination, while at the same
time associating them with words in
short, by using vocal music.
In the same way, when the intention
was to excite the imagination and give
greater impact to a poem, it was seen
that the most effective way was to
use not only the corresponding music,
but also music whose special quality
is its power to calm or provoke a
given emotion in the listener as well
as music pleasing to the ear.
This was the means of capturing his
imagination, helping him better to
understand the poem and stamping
the desired impression more durably
upon his mind, while at the same time
driving away fatigue and boredom.
The story has it that the poet "Alqamah
Ibn 'Abdih presented himself one day
at the court of al-Harith Ibn Shamr
king of Ghassan, to read him a poem
and request a favour. The sovereign
paid not the slightest heed to him ;
but when he put a melody to his poem
and began to sing, the monarch
immediately granted him his request.
When musicians realized that the
accompaniment of an instrument impar¬
ted to vocal music a richer sound,
greater resonance and brilliance and
that the association of poetry and
rhythm made it pleasanter and more
easy to learn by heart, they endea¬
voured to make the various instruments
produce notes comparable to those of
the sung melody.
In their minds they carried the notes
that made up the familiar, well-remem¬
bered melodies of their own regions
and they tried to locate the precise
part of an instrument that reproduced
each of these notes. Once this was
determined, reference marks were
made on the instrument.
Successive musicians selected those
instruments, whether naturally occuring
objects or artificially made, which
most perfectly reproduced these notes.
In this way they gradually improved
the various instruments. Faults were
slowly eliminated until the lute and
other instruments eventually acquired
their final form.
Once the art of musical perfor¬
mance was in this way perfected, rules
of melody were determined and it
became possible to distinguish bet¬
ween the notes and harmonies natural
to man and those which are not, and
to establish the degrees of conso¬
nance and dissonance.
The perfect consonance of the notes
produced by the human voice or by
some musical Instruments has been

compared to the essential nutritive ele¬
ments, and the other consonances,
which have a lesser degree of per¬
fection, to superfluous nourishment.
Very shrill or deafening sounds are
not natural, and neither are the in¬
struments which produce them. These
sounds are used only in special cir¬
cumstances ; their effect can be com¬
pared to that of a remedy, or perhaps
even to that of a poison, in that they
are intended to benumb and stupefy
the senses.
Sounds of this kind were made by
the instruments reserved for use upon
the battlefield ; a king of ancient
Egypt ordered the use of rattling bells,
and a king of Byzantium other strident
instruments with the same effect.
When the kings of Persia set out on
an expedition they were accompanied
by men whose function was to shriek
and howl as they went along. Sounds
such as these are dissonant in them¬
selves, but when merged with other
sounds and slightly modified, they can
become consonant.
This was how the various practical
musical arts we have enumerated were
born.
As greater interest was given to
certain instruments, it was found that
they could create notes and melodies
of quite a different kind from those
produced by the human voice. How¬
ever, they shared with the latter the
capacity to have a pleasing effect, and
although they did not posess all the
qualities of the sung note, they appear¬
ed natural.
Far from rejecting these instruments,
musicians adopted them and, with
occasional departures from the rules
of sung music, used them to the great¬
est possible advantage. This was the
origin of purely instrumental music,
which the voice cannot imitate.
The ancient rawashin of Khurasan
and Persia are examples of music of
this kind. Instrumental music as an
accompaniment to sung melody streng¬
thens the song and throws it into relief,
and is also capable of replacing or
complementing the voice in various
circumstances. The two kinds of
music are therefore closely linked.
Tambourines and tabors, timbáis,
hand-clapping, dancing and rhythmic
mime can all be considered elements
of music.
The least perfect of these is cer¬
tainly rhythmic mime ; the play of
eyebrows, shoulders, head, legs and
arms is, in fact, no more than move¬
ment. Yet these movements suggest
an impression of sound. Furthermore,
since the movements of the body
occur at intervals of time identical to
those separating two beats, these inter¬
vals are measurable. Hence, though
consisting solely of movement, mime
is regulated by rhythm and has an
underlying musical intent.
The rhythm of hand-clapping or
stamping feet, the tambourine, timbáis
and dancing all belong to the same
category. These are of a higher order

than mime, in that the movements they
require culminate in a percussive
sound. This sound cannot however
be considered as a note, for it lacks
the continuity and length of duration
which gives to a sound the quality of
a musical note.
The lute, the lyre, the zither, the
rebeck and wind instruments are
superior to those mentioned above in
that they produce a sustained note.
This sound has the quality of continuity,
but still does not possess all the pro¬
perties of the human voice, which
comprises all the qualities of these
sounds and is the most perfect among
them.
By comparison with the notes pro¬
duced by the voice, those of all in¬
struments are inferior. They can there¬
fore be used only to enrich the son¬
ority of sung music, to increase its
effect, add to its beauty, accompany
the voice and make the song easier to
memorize.
The instruments which produce notes
whose qualities are most akin to those
of the human voice are the rebeck and
the wind instruments, for those are
the ones which best imitate its sound.
These are followed by the lute, the
zither and other instruments of the
same family, and then the others we
have mentioned.
With regard to the lute, its sound
resembles that of the human voice to
the extent that it can produce vibrato
and sustained notes. Flutes, the ra-
bab and other similar instruments have
a more perfect resemblance to the
voice ; their notes possess certain
qualities which produce the same
impression as some vocal sounds.

THE ANGEL
Nor did it stop there ; upon his
return from a diplomatic mission to
Rio de Janeiro where he accompanied
the French poet and playwright, Paul
Claudel, Darius Milhaud wrote his
Saudades do Brasil for piano. As he
recounts in his Mémoires, this work
draws its inspiration from Brazilian
folklore, learned by listening to popu¬
lar pianists who at that time used to
play at the entrances to cinemas on
the Avenida de Rio Branco.
On his return to France, Milhaud
wrote L'Homme et son Désir, a ballet
with a libretto written by Claudel,
whose source of inspiration lay in
the power and mystery of the Ameri¬
can forest. It mobilizes a tremendous
battery of percussion instruments
whose expressive potential was reveal¬
ed to him by what he heard in the
New World. He was also to use
Cuban rhythms in a symphonic "Over¬
ture".
Some years later, Edgar Várese, the
power of whose prophetic genius is
today fully recognized, was to study
the graphics, the notation of certain
Latin American instruments in the
works of his friend the Brazilian Heitor
Villa-Lobos, and those of the Cubans
Caturla and Roldan, in preparation for
his own works, such as Ionisation,
which have become classics in the
realm of innovative music.

l,v;
OF THE MARACAS (Continued from page 18)
To go back a little, Latin American
composition based on techniques of
European origin but also directly or
indirectly influenced by popular music
and by the inventive imagination of
individual singers and instrumentalists
who in towns and rural areas were
developing new forms of expression
experienced a fundamental, deep-
rooted need to find a particular style
of its own.
At the same time in the streets, in
town dances, new forms were emerg¬
ing the tango, rumba, conga, etc.
whose popularity, like that of Ameri¬
can jazz, was to spread throughout the
whole world in the 20th century.
This began to have a certain in¬
fluence upon the work of conservatory-
trained musicians. Since romantic
opera, often in the style of Meyerbeer,
and especially Verdi, was fashionable
in Europe, operas, preferably of a
national character and specifically
Latin American in content if not in
musical form, had to be written.
And written they were, in Mexico,
Venezuela, Cuba, on noble themes
with a slight historical touch, evoking
national myths and legends.
Yet none was to reach the standard
of those of Carlos Gomez (1836-1896),
whose Guarani remains an authentic
classic of Latin American romantic
music. No subsequent work of simi¬
lar inspiration produced in our conti¬
nent has ever managed to equal its
dramatic impact or the orchestral and
vocal treatment of the theme.
At the beginning of the 20th cen¬
tury, Latin American composers faced
a problem very similar to that encoun¬
tered by Russian musicians in fairly
recent times. Arriving late on the
world music scene, with no traditions
other than liturgical or religious vocal
music, they turned inwards towards
their birthright of a powerful popular
tradition.
Within this popular tradition they
found their own individual style, as
did Glinka and Mussorgsky in Russia,
and Smetana in Czechoslovakia. Thus
in the 1920s Latin American musicians
who had emerged after 1900, and had
therefore reached a certain degree of
maturity, turned for inspiration to their
folklore, which seemed to them like
a new discovery.
As though all guided by the same
compass, musicians of the period del¬
ved into the rich resources of popular
tradition, rhythms and melodies in
Cuba, Amadeo Roldan (1900-1939),
Alejandro Garcia Caturla (1906-1940);
in Mexico, Silvestre Revueltas (1899-
1940), Carlos Chavez (b. 1899) ; in
Argentina, Juan Jose Castro (1895-1968)
and in Venezuela, Juan Bautista Plaza
(1898-1965), and these are but a few
names from a long list of musicians.
But it is interesting to observe the
coincidence of the dates, for they dis¬
close a significant trend.
It is also important to note that the
careers of these musicians show how,
starting from a nationalist-folklore con¬
cept, all of them, like Manuel de Falla
in Spain and Bartok in Hungary, tended
to move away from themes noted down
on the spot during carnivals and popu¬
lar celebrations, to find their own per¬
sonal forms of expression. Some¬
times the "national" accent was
retained, but the final inspiration came
from an inner source.
It is appropriate here to mention the
greatest, most remarkable and univer¬
sal of all Latin American composers
of this century, the Brazilian Heitor
Villa-Lobos (1887-1959), whose works
are constantly played at concerts and
in radio and television broadcasts
throughout Europe and America.
Perhaps sensing that the guitar was
to become an instrument of tremen¬
dous versatility in our day, Villa-Lobos
wrote a number of preludes and stu¬
dies which are to guitarists today
what the preludes and fugues of Bach's
"Well-tempered Clavicord" have been
to pianists of every generation a

lems of its technical execution, is a

highly articulate form of musical com¬
munication.
The recordings of works by Villa-
Lobos increase every day. Besides
some minor ones, they include a num¬
ber which are already classic master¬
pieces such as his "Bacchianas", No. 1
(for cellos), No. 5 (for voice and
orchestra) ; the wonderful Choros 7
(for small chamber ensemble), the
Cuartetos, 5 and 6, and works for
every instrument and all conceivable
orchestral combinations.
Instead of becoming buried in musty
archives and dictionaries of musico¬
logy, they live on vigorously after the
death of their author, imposing a
dynamic Latin American presence in
the world of music.
In 1928 or thereabouts I had occa¬
sion to meet Heitor Villa-Lobos, and
asked him what the thought of musical
folklore. "Folklore? I am folklore",
he answered, putting in a nutshell an
image of the immediate future of Latin
American music.
Since then, our instruments and
rhythms have been incorporated into
modern orchestration. They have to
be added to the arsenal of percussion
instruments foreseen by Berlioz and
Rimsky-Korsakov in their treatises on
instrumentation.
Messaien, Boulez and others among
the most qualified exponents of con¬
temporary music are familiar with
them, just as were earlier composers
such as Milhaud and Edgar Várese.
The contribution made by Latin Amer¬
ican instruments and rhythms are part
and parcel of the grammar, syntax,
phonetics and even the semiology of
every modern composer.
Heitor Villa-Lobos' phrase "I am
folklore" reminds me of the carved
spandrel over the door of a convent
in Misiones, Argentina : among the
traditional figures of the "heavenly
concert", with the traditional lutes,
harps and theorbos, appears that of
an angel playing the maracas.
A maraca-playing angel I To me this
sculpture the immortal angel and
the maracas of our earthly continent
sums up the whole spirit and
character of the entire history of Latin
American music, from the Conquest to
the research now being carried out by
the young composers of this New
World in fields still strewn with pitfalls
but open to new possibilities.
In the final analysis, this New World
of ours, through its traditions, its heri¬
tage and all it has received from else¬
where, assimilated and transformed, is
in fact as old and mature as the other
worlds of our planet.

MUSIC OF THE CENTURIES Continued from page 5
apparent chiefly in those cultures
where the systematic teaching of music
is an indigenous tradition, for exam¬
ple in the civilizations of Asia.
During the first half of the century
ethnomusicology was in search of the
"authentic", that is to say, musical
systems uninfluenced by the West, in
much the same manner as many ethno¬
graphers sought in more conventional
branches of anthropological investiga¬
tion, and in the same period, to
abstract or ignore the Western forces
impinging upon institutions and ideas.
But in recent work musical change and
acculturation are elevated to the rank
of a chief problem; and the adoption
of an historical approach for its treat¬
ment forms a link with the historians
of Western music.
HE newer view of non-
European music has carried over to the
study of the musical culture of minority
groups, above all in the United States.
We have witnessed a revived interest
in the study of Afro-American music
in the Americas as a whole, in that
of the American Indians as a minority
culture (rather than as an isolated
group of remnant cultures), and in
the music of bilingual communities.
An extension of this interest has
led to the study of the musical culture
of certain definable groups (for exam¬
ple, adolescents) within general popu¬
lations, and to an emphasis being
put upon the music of urban life.
Ethnomusicology now becomes rele¬
vant to a very wide range of social
interests, and its practitioners, by a
sort of applied anthropology, play a
role in establishing the cultural iden¬
tity of societies and groups within
societies.
WANT
AN ISSUE
POP MUSIC?
Ethnomusicology in the traditional
fields has, increasingly since about
1960, become specialized and (in the
social scientist's jargon) problem-
oriented. The older style of research
was aimed at characterizing the total
musical culture of a unit (society or
tribe) ; the newer style seeks typically
to investigate a particular technique
or problem. A recent issue of the
journal Ethnomusicology, for example,
includes a survey of oboes in India,
an investigation from various points
of view of a single Hausa song in
Africa, and a study of music and the
structure of town life in northern
Afghanistan.
New techniques of analysis have
appeared. Computers, even though
not greatly used (although experiments
have been going on for the last twenty
years or so), have made an impact
on ethnomusicology. A particularly
important development in the use of
machines has been the attempt objecti¬
vely to reduce musical sound to visual
form; the machines, usually called
"melographs", have been developed
in, among other places, the University
of California at Los Angeles, the
Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and the
University of Oslo.
Efforts have been made to devise
descriptive and analytical procedures
and techniques for coping with aspects
of music not traditionally studied, such
as the manner of the use of the human
voice, tone colour in singing and in¬
strumental music, and the relationships
between singers and performers in
ensembles.
Further along this line of develop¬
ment, exercises have been mounted
to correlate types of performance with
types and configurations of culture.
From a study by Lomax and his col¬
leagues entitled "Folk Song Style and
Culture" (1968) there have emerged
The Editors of the " Unesco
Courier " are considering the
publication of a future issue
on " Pop " and other forms
of modern music. If you
would like us to deal with
this subject in a special issue,
please let us know.
hypotheses on, among other matters,
the relation between work groups and
complex choruses, and that between
the élite supervision of work and solo
singing. In this study it was found
that "a culture's favourite song style
reinforces the kind of behaviour essen¬
tial to its main subsistence effort and
to its central and controlling social
institutions."
In earlier ethnomusicological re¬
search the musicians of non-Western
cultures tended to be treated anony¬
mously, and it was implied that all
members of a culture were more or
less equal in their musical competence
and participation. There is now much
more readiness to treat musicians as
individuals and to accord them some¬
thing of the treatment given to their
counterparts in the West.
The studies of individual musicians,
of their biographies and their contribu¬
tions to musical culture, parallel the
trend in other fields of anthropology
by which individual creativity ceases
to be concealed behind the over-
generalized formulas of cultural style
and social homogeneity.
I|T will be seen, therefore,
that ethnomusicology shows some
marked trends of development, but it
is clearly hampered in moving towards
a true anthropology of music by the
preponderance within it of narrower
musicological concerns.
Most ethnomusicological research is
still centered upon the description and
comparison of music. It cannot reach
into music as culture until, as in the
case of visual art, literature, and tech¬
nology, music ceases to be treated
only as a special subject and becomes
a part of more rounded attempts to
treat thought, feeling, and behaviour.
And much the same can be said about
an even more neglected branch of
study, that of dance.
Of course, there are difficult techni¬
cal problems in the way of achieving
a satisfactory anthropology of music
and dance; but that there are such
problems follows from the specialized
skills of the cultures from which most
anthropologists come; they limit the
ethnographer's vision and lead him to
be insensitive to or uncomprehending
of major aspects of the cultural life
of the peoples he undertakes to ob¬
serve. The "total" suffers from the
musicologist's specialization and from rt"l
the anthropologist's lack of technical Jf
competence.

Letters to the Editor
FOR CHILDREN 8 TO 80
Sir,
Thank you for publishing the children's
supplement on Copernicus in your
special Issue on the great scientist
(April 1972). But may I point out that
there are many adults whose education
and culture are no more advanced than
those of a primary school child. Indeed
this is true of my own parents. Al¬
though they are not, strictly speaking,
illiterate, they might be considered as
such on the basis of say a Unesco
definition of illiteracy. Many other
people are in the same position.
The wonderful thing is that at last,
and thanks to the "Unesco Courier",
my parents now know about Coper¬
nicus, his achievements and his contem¬
poraries. May I suggest that great
figures and events that lend themselves
to this kind of popularization should
be presented in the same way in future
numbers. Though intended for children,
such features would benefit many adults
in the situation I have described.

SCIENTISTS WHO TOY
WITH THEOLOGY
Sir,
In "Copernicus as told to children"
Jean-Claude Pecker writes: "Science
still hasn't found the answers to many
questions and there are many legends
which masquerade as scientific fact
about the origin of life to mention only
one example. But one day science
will come up with the right answers
just as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and
Newton did. And then we'll have to
admit that the old legends were lovely
stories and perhaps nothing more."
I find this declaration of rationalist
faith, which sees science as the only
path of knowledge, with all the answers
(if not today ,then at least tomorrow)
and which classifies the Bible stories
as "old legends" or "lovely stories",
most revealing. If the earth is no
longer' at the centre of the universe,
human reason still is.
The theologians of the Middle-Ages
played at being scientists. Misguidedly,
they abused their authority. But there
were the inquisition and the stake.
Yet these theologians like those of
today always placed God at the centre
of the universe and affirmed with vigour
that God alone is the source of all
life, of all knowledge, etc.
Nowadays scientists have an unfor¬
tunate tendency to toy with theology
or with atheology which comes to the
same thing. They may not have
inquisitorial courts, but they have provi¬
ded us with a powerful ABC (atomic,
bacteriological, chemical) of weapons.
For them, man is no longer at the
centre of the universe, but I am inclined
to think that they place science at
the centre of the world, and why
not? at the centre of the universe.
They are the priests of a new religion!
But after all, whether the sun turns
round the earth or the earth turns
round the sun, there are innumerable
people who hunger for justice and to
whom this question is of little interest.
With Its "old legends" and "lovely
stories", the Bible at least has the
merit of speaking to people such as
these. But having said this, may I add
that I have nothing against science or
indeed against scientists, especially
when they make the distinction between
the realm of the "how" (which is their
domain) and that of the "why" (which
is that of the theologian).

MAN'S PLACE
IN THE UNIVERSE
Sir,
Jean-Claude Pecker's "Copernicus as
told to children" made fascinating read¬
ing.
This is indeed how the lives of great
men should be recounted to young peo¬
ple, combining that gift of youth a
sense of wonder and admiration with
the objectivity of the scientist.
But it strikes me that on the last
page the author abandons his scientific
objectivity and airs his own philoso¬
phical views when he declares with
an air of triumph that Copernicus'
discovery "helped us to get rid of the
idea that man, too, was the centre of
the universe". Does it embarrass him
that man, by his intelligence, dominates
his environment, and perhaps even the
universe?
If the earth were in fact at the centre
of the universe, it would not mean that
man would occupy the central position
in that universe. The one does not
necessarily follow from the other.
Where a man lives is not of material
consequence. Living in the centre of a
town or on its outskirts does not
make me more or less important. There
are many other more significant quali¬
fications in the life of a human being
level of intelligence, education, a per¬
son's sex (and here I imply no disrespect
for one sex or the other) and so on.
Thus whether man inhabits a small
or a large planet, whether the planet
be central or not, alters nothing in the
human condition nor deprives man of
any of his prerogatives.

Sir,
What a great idea you had in publish¬
ing the children's supplement on Coper¬
nicus. You can be sure it is just as
popular with your adult readers a real
fountain of rejuvenation, spontaneity and
sunshine. Thank you for making the
idea a striking reality.

GALAXY OF WRITERS
Sir,
What a pleasure to read your fine
number, "The Emergence of Man"
(August-September 1972).
In an issue which featured a galaxy
of international authorities, readers
were able to familiarise themselves
with views on many a problem.
One feature I particularly appreciate
is the chronological account of man's
evolution, "The Road to Homo Sapiens",
and also the account of the geological
periods of the "cradle of mankind".
Full credit for assembling this impos¬
ing "symposium" of anthropologists as
well as for the wonderful illustrations
chosen for the articles should be given
to the Editorial Board of the "Unesco
Courier". I am sure that most other
readers share my opinion and are
grateful for this issue.
The latest archaeological discoveries
concerning the civilizations of prehis¬
toric man as interpreted by notable
figures in world science deserve future
coverage.

OUR FACES ARE RED 1
Sir,
May we point out an error in your
issue on "Three Faces of Art Today"
(March 1973). The reproduction of the
painting by Botticelli (page 21) is not
the artist's "Primavera", as the caption
states, but his equally famous "Birth
of Venus".

STUDENT SUPPORT FOR U. N.
Sir,
Your letters' page of February 1973
carries one from Martin Fairbairn a
university student at Bangor (North
Wales) who wants to help publicize the
work of the U.N.
I would like to suggest one way in
which he can assist the enormous task
of stimulating interest at the "grass
roots level" in the United Nations, its
ideals and programmes and those of
Agencies such as Unesco. That is that
he should work with our Association,
of which at least his College in Bangor
regretfully is not yet aware.
