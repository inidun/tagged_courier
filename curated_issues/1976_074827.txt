This terra cotta head (13 cms. high) was unearthed at Aksum, the ancient capital of Ethiopia, which
has remained a spiritual and cultural centre to the present day. The head dates from between the
4th and 7th centuries A.D. and is now in the National Museum, Addis Ababa. The artists of Aksum
were distinguished by the delicate skill and gracefulness with which they embellished everyday
objects : this head with eyes serenely closed was used as the lid of a jar. Photo © Luc Joubert. Paris

"a more equitable place
in the sun for the new nations'
by Trygve Bratteli
fr«.
MOST people are of the opi¬
nion that prevailing econo¬
mic and social inequalities
bring us face to face with a gap
dividing the peoples of the world that
is both intolerable and unacceptable.
And there are many who demand that
a more equitable sharing of burdens
and benefits should form the central
feature of a new and better world
order.
Here we come right up against
emotion-laden differences and con¬
flicts of interest which have dogged
mankind throughout its history.
Why are economic conditions and
levels of progress so different from
one country to another?
What have been the motivating
factors in those areas of the world
which today are well-established and
enjoy the benefits of advanced scien¬
tific and technological development,
high productivity and a high level of
income per capita?
What are the factors which have
kept back other areas, struggling in
varying degrees with primitive pro¬
duction methods and very low income
levels for all those hundreds of
millions who have an existence under,
subsistence levels? f

Norway from 1973 to 1976 and has been

Very little is to be gained by assum¬
ing that some nations are rich be¬
cause they have robbed the poor
countries or that the poor nations
remain in a poverty-stricken . state
because the rich nations take from
them what little they have.
Basically we must be clear in our
minds that the picture is of a far
more complex nature than that. We
find countries at all levels from the
poorest on the lowest rung of the
ladder right up to the richest indu
strial countries at the top of the
economic scale.
But over and above this we have
the fact that regardless of the rung
on which we can place any given
country, each of them is also split
internally by wide gaps between poor
and rich individuals.
This applies in equal measure to
the poor as well as to the rich na¬
tions. It can even be said that in
the poor countries the gap between
the many poor and the few rich may
be greater and more provocative than
in many rich industrial nations.
Small exclusive groups in the Third
World are able to live in a state of
luxury to which it is difficult to find
a parallel in the modern industrial
states. The modern capitalist is more
interested in industrial enterprise,
trade and securities and not so much
in acquiring palatial homes and living
in ostentatious luxury.
All countries both rich and poor
depend for their further development
6

on increased international trade in
goods and services. All of them will,
to an increasing extent, make good
their opportunities through close con¬
tact with a world economy.
About 150 years ago life in Norway
was characterized by abject poverty,
back-breaking human labour, a high
infant mortality rate and a low life-
expectancy. Today, in economic
terms, Norway, with its four million
inhabitants is relatively speaking, one
of the "top ten" nations with a very
low rate of infant mortality and the
longest life-expectancy in the world.
The high level of economic activity
has been integrated in the world eco¬
nomy to such an extent that today
Norway sells half of its production
outside its own borders and imports
a corresponding amount.
On the basis of such a historical
experience, I have little faith in the
doctrine that the poor countries will
take the road to prosperity by wea¬
kening their ties with the international
economy. Progress and prosperity
for the poor countries also depend
on furthering an equitable division of
labour and the exchange of goods
and services between all nations.
Nor have I heard any representative
of the poor countries postulate the
doctrine that the salvation of these
nations lies in being left alone in
economic terms, each one in his own
back-yard so to speak. On the
contrary, they desire broad contacts
with countries all over the world.
The principal issue then is to pro¬
vide suitable opportunities and condi¬
tions for the exchange of goods
and services between countries at
very different levels of economic
development.
A strategy for a new international
economic order must consist of two
parts, both equally necessary.
We must try to clarify how in fact
economic forces operate and why
the benefits derived from the ex¬
change of resources and the interplay
between nations have come to pro¬
duce the results we have, been able^
to register up to the present time. r
Climbing tortuously up the steep flank of the Chala
mountains, in Angola, this recently completed road links
the port of Mossamedes with the interior of the country.
Manila's striking new cultural centre houses under one roof
exhibits from every group in Philippine society, so diverse
that linguistically alone the nine main groups can be
divided into 70 sub-groups.

We must agree on joint measures
which can enable the world economic
system to operate satisfactorily for
the benefit of the new nations, which
are now seeking to achieve a more
equitable place in the sun within the
system.
We must persist in this work
without being hampered by the idea
that some nations must necessarily
be the losers if others are to achieve
economic gain.
There is a growing mutual depen¬
dence between nations generally and
between regional groups of countries.
The rich industrialized countries can¬
not live a secure existence, protected
against the political and social effects
of the inhuman conditions of life
which are the lot of the broad, under¬
privileged masses of the world's
population. And these masses will not
be able to free themselves from their
destitution and achieve economic
independence without the active sup¬
port of countries which have pro¬
gressed further in technological in¬
sight and know-how.
Mutual dependence between the
main groups of developing and indus¬
trial countries, however, does not
operate equitably both ways. There
is here a lack of balance detrimental
to the developing countries. They
are therefore easily placed at a
disadvantage both with regard to a
balancing of interests on international
issues as well as in the competitive
system of the international economy.
This arises out of circumstances
which cause a serious lack of stabi¬
lity in the world economy and the
absence of a firm basis for the long-
term planning of International eco¬
nomic relations. As far as the deve¬
loping countries are concerned, eco¬
nomic planning in accordance with
national requirements is a necessary
prerequisite for progress.
The basic premise lies in the
exploitation of one's own resources
and how these may be utilized to the
best advantage within the framework
of a global economy. However, ¡t is
essential that this process should
lead to a distribution of income bet¬
ween the nations which ¡s politically
acceptable to all.
The efforts to achieve a better
balance must take into account cer¬
tain fundamental characteristic fea¬
tures of world trade which tend to
place the developing countries in a
very exposed position. Three-quar¬
ters of their foreign trade is with the
Western market economies. Western
Europe alone takes 40 per cent of
the developing countries' exports.
Trade between developing coun¬
tries makes up almost all the remain
ing quarter. The countries of the
East are a negligible factor in the
developing countries' economic rela¬
tions with the rest of the world. This
imposes a great responsibility on the
countries of the West, and espe¬
cially on Western Europe.
On the other hand three-quarters of
the Western industrially developed
countries' foreign trade ¡s conducted
between themselves. Only about 20
per cent of their exports go to the
developing countries.
As a group the developing coun¬
tries are net importers of foodstuffs.
In the main they are supplied by the
food surplus of the Western industrial
countries. In the case of some deve¬
loping countries the Imports of grain
from the West are of vital importance
for their nutrition. This seems to be
an unreasonable state of affairs con¬
sidering the unexploited agricultural
production potential existing in the
developing countries.
The developing countries' exports
consist mainly of raw materials, which
are produced under unstable condi¬
tions with regard to both prices and
profitability. But the developing coun¬
tries are not a dominant factor in the
world trade ¡n commodities. The
exports of raw materials from the
industrialized countries are almost
twice as great and the substantial
part of the trade in these commodities
is conducted between these Western
industrialized countries themselves.
The developing countries have here
only a marginal production and are
very vulnerably exposed during pe¬
riods of recession. Apart from energy
products, the industrial countries
themselves cover 85 to 90 per cent
of their raw material requirement.
It ¡s therefore not correct to des¬
cribe the developing countries as the
raw material producers and the In¬
dustrial countries as the producers of
manufactured goods. Some of the
very poorest and most populous areas
of the world are notable for their
lack of energy resources as well as
raw materials.
A high level of prices for commo¬
dities thus represents no key solution
for overcoming the poverty of the
developing countries. For some of
the poorest developing countries, high
energy and commodity prices are no
less than a catastrophe, as we have
seen in recent years. For some of
the richest Industrialized countries
higher prices for commodities repre¬
sent increased earnings.
All countries have a legitimate need
for a reasonably secure system of
supplies of energy and raw materials.
Traditional trading patterns provide
no solution to the highly differen
tiated and varied interests which
arise between the developing and the
industrialized countries when they
both engage themselves ¡n a world
economy.
It is in our common interest that
we preserve the multilateral nature
of world trade, and that it remains an
open, trading system with access for
all. However, this system must be
more firmly tied to the more basic
and broader tasks facing the coun¬
tries of the world in their economic
policies. ;
It is not possible to create a system
which automatically resolves all future
problems. Once-for-all solutions al¬
ways have a limited life-span. An
important aspect of a new economic
world order must therefore be to
reach suitable arrangements enabling
the countries of the world to solve
problems by means of joint measures
according to changing circumstances.
Some people may object that such
a continuous and lasting form of
cooperation between states will tend
to alter the character of what has
hitherto been regarded as the free
market economy of world trade.
However, without such extensive and
long-term joint measures there is a
real danger that trading patterns will
emerge which will exclude both free
trade as well as a well-planned
system for regulating the crucial pro¬
blems of markets and supplies.
We must therefore continue to per¬
severe in the work on the scope
of an international commodity pro¬
gramme and Its attendant financing
arrangements.

BLACK GOLD FROM THE JUNGLE.
The growing needs of world industry
have pushed the search for natural
resources into increasingly remote
places : from deserts to the high seas
and, as shown here, to the heart of
the Amazonian jungle. It was in 1971
that Peruvian geologists and engineers
first struck oil in the heart of the immense
Amazonian forest. Today, jungle-hopping

THE SEARCH FOR A NEW
WORLD ECONOMIC ORDER
x Should we dump
the present economic systems
and start again from scratch? '
by Samir Amin
SAM I R AM I N, internationally known Egyptian economist, is Director
of the African institute for Economic Development and Planning,
in Dakar (Senegal) . A uthor ofmany studies on the economic problems
ol the Third World, he took part in the round table on cultural and
intellectual co-operation and the new international economic order,
at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris, in June 1976. We present here salient
passages from his contribution to the round table.
WHEN we examine the stages
in the struggle for a new
economic order, both national and
world-wide, we realize that this is not
an entirely new struggle and that it has
been carried on by the Third World
countries for at least twenty years
past. Nevertheless, it must be admitted
that it ¡s only during the last few years
that the actual subject of a New World
Economic Order has assumed the
importance it has today and become,
in a way, fashionable.
The Third World countries, particu¬
larly those of Asia and Africa, first
fought for their political independence.
After the Second World War, a long
series of political struggles and often
armed struggles were necessary be¬
fore the old forms of colonial depen-^
dence were eliminated. Over a score r

Oswaldo
Guayasamin's
'weeping
woman'
Over 30 internationally-known artists, scientists and statesmen took part
in a round tablejon cultural and intellectual co-operation and the new world
economic order'at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris, in June 1976. During the meeting
the Ecuadorian painter Oswaldo Guayasamin presented one of his works.
Weeping Woman, to the Director-General of Unesco. The painting, to be
auctioned with gifts from other leading artists, was shown during
a special cultural week in Venice sponsored by Unesco, in September 1976,
in support of the international campaign for the preservation of Venice.
During the presentation ceremony Oswaldo Guayasamin stressed the need
for solidarity among artists in the world of today. "We now perceive in
the culture of Latin America," he said, "certain scars, perhaps less visibleyet
similar to those of Bonampak (Mexico) and of Machu Picchu (Peru). And
Unesco, which is helping to safeguard these majestic creations of the human
mind, has also undertaken to preserve the personality of each of our conti¬
nents, of each of our regions now in peril. The treasures of past art are
indeed durable testaments to the creative genius of mankind, yet the cam¬
paign for a new world economic order has, in my view, a still more huma¬
nistic quality, since it seeks topreserve the vitality of cultures which, unless
they are protected today, will be beyond hope of conservation tomorrow".

, of years, therefore, the countries of
Asia and Africa were mainly occupied
with the combat for political indepen¬
dence and with activities undertaken
in the interests of solidarity with those
countries which had not yet achieved
political independence.
The non-aligned movement which
was inaugurated as a result of the
historic Bandung Conference in the
middle 1950s was exclusively concern¬
ed, over about a decade, with the ma¬
jor problems of the political indepen¬
dence of the Third World countries,
with the problems of South-East Asia,
the Vietnam War, Palestine, apartheid,
the Portuguese colonial war, and
Cuba, which some powers wanted to
isolate. This was the almost exclusive
theme with which the States making
up the Third World were concerned.
The national liberation movements,
and therefore the governments which
emerged from such movements, did
not elaborate a new viewpoint on
economic affairs. They considered
that the development strategies used
during the colonial epoch could be
more or less pursued at the price of
a few minor adjustments, that the
integration of new States into the in¬
ternational division of labour and the
world economy presented so many
advantages in itself that there was no
point in calling it into question.
They thought that national indepen¬
dence would make possible, and in
fact almost automatically imply, poli¬
tical and economic independence,
which was the condition of a genuine
Interdependence, even if ¡t was only
interdependence between unequal par¬
ties. Within Europe there are countries
which are unequal not only in size but
also ¡n their degree of development,
and yet they may be considered as
interdependent.
The same cannot be said of the
world generally. We can scarcely
speak of interdependence in relation
to such an asymmetrical picture, and
that being so it is better to speak of
dependence.
It was only during a second stage
that Third World countries gradually
came to understand that, all things
being considered, political indepen¬
dence did not count for very much
unless it resulted in economic inde¬
pendence, and that the latter remain¬
ed to be achieved in the same way as
political Independence.
It would not come about of its own
accord and would not emerge from a
development strategy based entirely
or. almost exclusively on the interna¬
tional division of labour or the internal
growth and development which are
by-products of the development of the
world system and, therefore, the by¬
products of the development of the
most highly-developed centres, with
just a few minor adjustments here and
there.
Now unless I am mistaken, the idea
that economic independence had to
be achieved and that this would in¬
volve a struggle in the same way as
for political independence first be¬
came the theme of the; non-aligned
countries and therefore of the 77 de¬
veloping countries, at the Non-Aligned
Summit held at Lusaka in 1970. It may
have been a few years earlier, but it
was certainly not later than the Algiers
Non-Aligned Summit in 1973.
The New World Economic Order
which the Third World was beginning
to claim consisted mainly in two ideas.
One was that the producers of raw
materials ought to organize themsel¬
ves. It was necessary to set up pro¬
ducers' associations, taking into
account the producers' different situa¬
tions and the position of each of the
raw materials on world markets.
These associations could be diffe¬
rent in strength and would impose a
revision of the terms of trade, to¬
gether with a real and substantial rise
in the prices of raw materials. This
would make it possible to create. tho
conditions for a stabilization policy
which would not be a farce but a real
dialogue one between partners who,
in spite of divergent interests, know
that they can reach a real compromise
instead of attempting to impose the
view of only one side.
The second idea put forward by the
non-aligned countries at that time was
that, in order to engage ¡n this strug¬
gle and obtain results, it was neces--
sary that there should be solidarity
among the Third World countries. The
idea of setting up a solidarity fund
enabling the producers' associations
to join battle and reduce the pressure
exerted by developed countries on the
underdeveloped countries which had
gone furthest in this . direction was
based on this fact.
Today everybody is aware that one
of these associations, OPEC (Organi¬
zation of Petroleum Exporting Coun¬
tries) has been in existence since the
beginning of the 1960s, but it was
only ¡n 1970, and even more in 1973
that it was in a position to use a fa¬
vourable economic and political situa-
10

tion to impose a rise ¡n the price of
energy. Up till then the developed
countries of the ,West had not under¬
stood that the objectives in the strug¬
gle for economic Independence were
anything more than just pious wishes,
conferences, vague charters and
statements of good Intentions.
Nevertheless, the world economic
system and the Industrially developed
countries took all the necessary mea¬
sures to ensure that the danger of a
real struggle for economic indepen¬
dence was averted. The idea of an
organization of Third World countries
and the setting up of a solidarity
fighting fund was gradually replaced
by beautiful but quite harmless ideas
which would change nothing in the
economic order but merely reinforce-
the status quo and morally place the
victims of that status quo in the odd
position of aggressors if they should
happen to question some of its ele¬
ments unilaterally.
The Idea of a unilateral rise in prices
and of negotiations to be undertaken
by producers' associations from a
stronger position was therefore gra¬
dually replaced by that of a continuing
dialogue between producers and con¬
sumers, that of a stabilization fund, etc.
And yet, none of the proposals of the
Third World was included in the much
watered-down draft resolutions of the,
Non-AJigned Conference held at Da¬
kar in February 1975 or of the Manila
Conference which took place just
before the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development Session
in Nairobi.
Now this was very odd! For on the
other hand there is Increasing talk in
the developed countries themselves of
the iniquity and dangers of the vast
wastage of raw materials which occurs
on a world scale, of the growing
awareness of the price of economic
growth as it has been pursued thus
far, and of what ¡t costs not only the
peoples of the developed countries
(in terms of quality of life, deteriora¬
tion of the environment, pollution, etc.)
but also the victims of that same
growth, the peoples of the under¬
developed countries.
For three centuries past, these
peoples .have been subjected to the
rising prices imposed on them and
have been obliged to provide free, or
almost free, the wealth of the planet,
without anyone caring about their
future or, of course, the future of
mankind in general.
Should it be concluded that this
talk about the fears inspired by the
wastage of the planet's resources is
mere demagogy and that the institu¬
tions, governments and authorities of
the developed countries are incapable
of making the slightest concession
when Third World countries ask them
to agree to changes which logically
would result in a better use of the
world's resources?
I think an event like the rise in the
price of oil should have been greeted

The new international economic order should offer children
in the villages and cities in the Third World the prospect of
a future based on social justice and human dignity.
with open arms by all developed
countries if they were logical and
really wanted to conserve the resour¬
ces of the planet, and that this rise
should have been approved of and
supported by them. Hitherto there has
been little sign of this, and every op¬
portunity has been and still is being
sought of breaking up the association
of petroleum producers, which shows
that we really are faced with a battle.
But as it became apparent that the
struggle was having practically no re¬
sults, except where a group of dev- ,
eloping countries had managed to
impose its views unilaterally, and that
the struggle to change the World Eco¬
nomic Order was bringing to light all
the weaknesses of the system and the
Impossibility of achieving even the
slightest change in the terms of the
international system by means of talks
and negotiations, another idea began
to gain ground.
This idea was that the Third World
should count increasingly on its own
resources and that, therefore, the road
towards development should consist
in a more or less marked withdrawal
from the International system of divi¬
sion of labour if this system was going
to remain inequitable and continue to
be the basis of à world polarization
and exploitation.
For it may well be asked whether
integration .into the world economic
system is really necessary, at any rate
for Third World countries, since it ¡s
based on a division of labour which
is responsible for the inequitable dis¬
tribution of income and therefore for
Increasing the distortions (in terms of
the pattern of consumption) which
constitute a hindrance to real deve¬
lopment. It may also be asked, there¬
fore, whether such Integration should
continue to be considered as a condi¬
tion for development.
One therefore comes to wonder
whether, ¡n order to rebuild the world
system for this will, I think, have to
be done one day one should not
begin by destroying it (i.e. pulling out
of it) and whether ¡t is not by with¬
drawing from the system of the inter¬
national division of labour that we
shall create the objective conditions
for the possible rebuilding of a better
system which will bring out the real
potentialities of the various peoples.
The fact is that the resources of the
planet are not distributed evenly and
that consequently it would be advan- .
tageous to build a new world system r
11

Water from this recently completed dam on the Euphrates river (Iraq) will irrigate
new lands for crop growing. It will also generate electricity for industrial
development in Iraq.
L But any such withdrawal from the
world system is only a last resort and
an unhappy obligation. Is it caused
by some kind of cultural nationalism,
and can it be justified in terms of
specific patterns of development or
the preservation and development of
a national culture with its particular
features?
Circumstances are such that gene¬
rally, when an economic development
strategy is adopted, it is accompanied
by an ideological and political argu¬
ment which is compatible with it. I
personally therefore am not shocked
to see this strategy of withdrawal from
the world system accompanied by a
certain degree of nationalism.
There are various patterns of deve¬
lopment and all of them are universal
¡n character. Whether the pattern is
the capitalist one in existence in most
countries, which has been formed and
has imposed itself throughout the
world over a long period, having
started three centuries ago in many
countries and spread considerably
during the 19th and 20th centuries, or
the pattern which has emerged from
the experience of Eastern Europe,
particularly the Soviet Union, or again
that drawn from the current experience
of Eastern Asia, China, Vietnam and
Cambodia they are all universal in
character.
Capitalism has created a world-wide
system, and we can consider either
extending it and developing along the
lines and ¡n the logic of that system
or withdrawing from it. History cannot
be effaced.
We must therefore realize today
that any pattern for the organization
of society, no matter what its level
of development, presupposes short or
long-term objectives related to techno¬
logical development, production, con¬
sumption, the supply of mankind with
material goods and the provision of a
social organization, all of which are
necessarily universal in character.
The ideologies which accompany
these patterns are universalist. They
certainly converge at some points, if
only because this history exists and
productive forces exist at a certain
level of development. But they also
have many points of divergency, and
these are undoubtedly more marked.
Whereas science is universal, techno¬
logy, which is only putting science to
work in a social context, is probably
less universal than it appears to be.
The Third World, by which I mean
all the countries of Asia, Africa and
Latin America except the communist
ones, has not produced any particular
pattern, and I do not believe it is ca¬
pable of producing one in this sense,
because it is still economically subject
to the laws governing the development
of the world capitalist system, even
if it calls them partly Into question by
means of the World Economic Order.
I therefore think ¡t is useless to ask
ourselves whether we ought to leave
countries free to work out suitable
patterns for themselves or not, since
I think that they will either take such
liberty or not as they think fit.
The real question we ought to ask
ourselves is whether, among the pat¬
terns of universal character put for¬
ward there are some more likely to
respect diversity in global develop¬
ment. For I believe that there are
many advantages in diversity and that
these advantages are not only cul¬
tural but also economic.
Are there, then, patterns and ideo¬
logies which, while necessarily being
presented as they are that is of
universal character are more likely
than others to maintain diversity rather
than consider it as an obstacle to
development, and if so how can they
be applied?
I think that the capitalist system has
hitherto been extremely destructive
and has not looked upon diversity as
an asset. It has also been creative,
of course! It has created vast things
together with a level of development
of productive forces without which,
undoubtedly, nothing else would be
conceivable. !
And we ought to ask ourselves whe¬
ther this was not a stage in history,
whether ¡t did not merely create the
conditions for doing something better
and whether, consequently, the des¬
truction of cultures which it brings
about is not in accordance with its
most fundamental laws.
I do not believe it is the machine
itself which ought to be blamed but
rather the social relations which, by
means of certain forms of social orga¬
nization, division of labour, etc., dic¬
tate certain habits and a certain
subjection to the machine. It ¡s not
the technology itself but the social
relations within which the technology
is applied, which must be called into
question.
I cannot help thinking that any talk
of cultural diversity is always very am¬
biguous. I wonder whether it is a very
positive protest against the machine
which destroys cultures that the capi¬
talist system has been and still is, or
whether it is utterly inadequate.
In my opinion, the only proper way
of fighting the capitalist system is by
opposing it with a pattern which, while
of universal character, really respects
diversity and makes it an asset for the
enrichment of nations. Then undoubt¬
edly, the conditions will be achieved
for cultural and Intellectual co-opera¬
tion which in itself can only be consi¬
dered as positive.

Snaded areas on this map show zones of copper ores at the time of the earliest
copper metallurgy (7000 to 4000 B.C.). It now seems likely that metallurgy in bronze
(an alloy of copper and tin) was known to craftsmen thousands of miles away from
this region, at Ban Chiang, in Thailand, as early as the 4th millennium B.C.
ALL over the world, archaeolo¬
gists are continually discover¬
ing ancient artifacts made of
stone, volcanic glass, bone, wood,
minerals or metal. Metal objects are
particularly interesting because, al¬
though they may have been burled in
the earth for almost 5,000 years, they
are often found in remarkably good
condition.
I shall discuss only one of the ques¬
tions raised by ancient metals: whe¬
ther a Copper Age really existed be¬
fore the Bronze Age, as several
recent books claim.
The discovery of metal and metal
working were revolutionary in the his¬
tory of Man's development as he gra¬
dually changed over from the use of.
stone to the use of metal implements r
13

L whose superiority he prized. Metal
became a means of distinguishing
between the ages of history: Man's
development was divided Into the
Ages of Stone, Bronze and Iron.
Christian Jurgensen Thomsen, a
Dane, was thought to have devised
this "three-period system" in 1836,
although, in fact, the thinkers of anti¬
quity had already spoken of different
ages in the history of Man. As early
£ Lance head made of arsenical
< copper. Discovered near
® Stavropol, in the Caucasus,
o it dates from the second
£ millennium B.C.
as the 7th century B.C., the Greek
poet Hesiod wrote of five ages: gol¬
den, silver, bronze, "heroic" and iron.
Homer also mentioned bronze ¡n the:
Iliad. The Latin poet Lucretius, ¡n his
poem De rerum natura, written just
before the Christian era, and Yuan
Kang at almost the same time (the
Han Dynasty), had already divided
history into three stages: stone (or
bone), copper (or bronze) and iron. .
Yet no matter how Man's ancient
history was divided, none of the sys¬
tems makes a clear distinction be¬
tween the Bronze and Copper Ages,
due to these ancient writers' tendency
to call copper and bronze by the
same name. They thought that these
were the same metal because of their
similar appearance.
I want to stress that chemists, not
archaeologists, initiated the chemical
analysis of ancient metal objects,
which launched an active co-opera¬
tion between the two groups. The
German chemist, Martin Heinrich Kla-
proth, is generally considered the
pioneer of systematic analysis of an¬
cient metals, begun in the 18th cen¬
tury. Outstanding chemists such as
Jons Jakob Berzelius of Sweden, Karl
Fresenius and Justus Lieblg of Ger¬
many, and Marcelin Berthelot of
France continued the research.
The findings of these analyses
showed that the objects were made of
copper and not bronze. This was the
basis for the first theory in 1876 that
a Copper Age had existed, at least in
parts of Europe. From his later ana¬
lysis of Egyptian articles, Marcelin
Berthelot claimed that a Copper Age
had also existed in Egypt. Thus a
"four-period system" emerged for
much of the ancient world: Stone,
Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages.
Most books claim that tools at the
beginning of the Copper Age were
fashioned from native copper forged
cold. Yet a Soviet geochemist, Vladi¬
mir Ivanovich Vernadsky, had pre¬
viously expressed doubts about the
use of native copper by Man as the
first metal, except where there are
large deposits of native copper, as in
the area of Lake Superior (U.S.A.).
As a result of later laboratory exper¬
iments, the existence of a Copper
Age in most regions did not seem
plausible. By the 1930s, the old che¬
mical analyses of ancient metals
which had provided the basis for a
technological history of Man's use of
metal were largely invalid.
New physical and physico-chemical
methods have recently taken the
place of old methods, substantially
modifying earlier findings. Thus,
when I received a report in 1966 from
the American researcher and histo¬
rian, Cyril Stanley Smith, stating that
tests on the microstructure of ancient
copper Implements found near Lake
Superior revealed that they were not
fashioned from cold-forged native
copper, I was not surprised.
Emission spectrum analysis, used
not just on ancient metal objects but
also on the residue from smelting,
slag and moulds, brought about the
most important modifications. Spec¬
trum analysis of ancient metals was
first used in 1933 in Halle (Germany)
and a little later in Leningrad
(U.S.S.R.). However, quantitative
spectrum analysis of ancient metal is
the brainchild of the Baku Laboratory
of the History Institute of the Azerbai¬
jan academy of Sciences, where the
first significant results were obtained.
Metal objects found in the Trans-
Caucasus in monuments dating from
the third millennium B.C. had long
been attributed to the Copper Age.
While spectrum analysis confirmed
that these objects contained no tin, it
established the presence of large
amounts of arsenic.
Considerable admixtures of arsenic
were also found in objects discovered
in an ancient settlement on the Kultep
mound in the Nakhichevan Autono¬
mous Republic. Analysis of ¡terns
from various parts of the Northern
Caucasus and the Ukraine gave simi¬
lar results. The "copper" contained
up to 10 per cent arsenic in working
implements and 30 per cent or more
in ornaments. Further analysis of
casting residue, moulds and slag
showed that the arsenical copper had
been locally produced.
Still more ancient examples were
sought. During the on-going excava¬
tions . at the Kultep mound, seven
other metal items were discovered: an
arrowhead, an awl and various frag¬
ments dating from the fourth mllle-
nium B.C. Analysis showed that a
large proportion was made from arse¬
nical copper and that one also con¬
tained a considerable quantity of
nickel. Only a few were found to
contain ho arsenic.
A small knife and fragments from
the same period found in the ancient
settlement of Tekhuta, near Echmia¬
dzin in Armenia, are made exclusively
of arsenical copper. The use of ar¬
senical copper in the Trans-Caucasus
that long ago, meant that the Copper
Age in that region was hypothetical
and that Man's early use of metal
began simultaneously with arsenical
and unalloyed copper.
Later spectrum analysis carried out
on ancient metal objects from other
countries has shown that arsenical
copper was common from the Indus
Valley to the British Isles. It was

4,000 to 1,000 B.C.
How did ancient metal-founders
add arsenic to copper? Extremely
rare in nature, elementary arsenic was
not discovered until the 12th century
A.D. In 1954 we wrote that arsenical
copper was probably obtained by
smeltjng cuprous minerals together
with arsenical ones like realgar and
orpiment, large deposits of which are
found in the Trans-Caucasus.
¡, Why did metal workers of antiquity
choose to add to the copper arsenical

rather than stannic [tin-bearing] mine¬
rals or lead or antimony-bearing
minerals which are very pleasing to
the eye? Man did not use stannic mi¬
nerals, which are uncommon in nature,
until much later. Lead was also used
from earliest times, in fact, but it was
alloyed with copper later and less
frequently since the smelting of lead
and copper alloys called for greater
skill and their mechanical properties
were inferior.
This was also true of copper and
antimony alloys. A fragment of an
antimony vase found in Tello in Lower
Mesopotamia and attributed to the
same chronological period as the
arsenical relics found in the Caucasus
confirms the use of metallic antimony
as early as the third millennium B.C.
Magical properties have been attri¬
buted to red minerals from earliest
times. Bright red realgar, commonly
encountered ¡n nature with gold-co¬
loured orpiment, could have caught
the ancient metal-founder's eye for
precisely that reason.
Six thousand years ago, the Egypt that preceded the pharaohs and the pyramids
already possessed a flourishing civilization. It has been named from Nagada,
a site 50 km. north of Luxor, where numerous artifacts dating from that period
have been unearthed. Among them are several unusual statuettes similar to
the one shown here carved in shale. Its high pointed bonnet recalls the white
crown that was later to become the traditional headdress of the kings of Upper
Egypt. Superimposed on photo are copper tools used by the people of Nagada.

> Pieces of realgar obtained from a

Lake Rezaiyyeh in Iran have confirm¬
ed the use of this substance in the
Middle East ¡n ancient times. Al¬
though the properties of arsenical
copper are as good as those of cop¬
per mixed with tin, production of ar¬
senical bronze declined gradually with
the appearance of the tin alloy, pro¬
bably due to the wholesale poisoning
of foundry workers by arsenical
secretions.
In such regions as Thailand and
Vietnam, arsenical copper never exist¬
ed. None of 80 fragments of metal
objects found ¡n excavations at the
Non Nok Tha mound in Thailand was
made of arsenical copper. At the
same time, it was established that the
most ancient tin bronze from Thailand
had a tin content of 20 per cent or
more and dates from 3,000 B.C. or
before (1).
English archaeologist James ¡Mel-
laart discovered even earlier metal ar¬
tifacts in a neolithic settlement dating
from about 6,500 B.C. at Çatal Hüyük
in Turkey consisting of copper and
lead beads and other objects. Study
of slag found ¡n one of the dwellings
confirmed that it had come from the
smelting of copper ore. The date
when metal smelting began was a
significant revelation.
More ancient metal was found in
Turkey at Çayonii Tepesi during the
digs conducted by American archaeo¬
logist Professor Robert Braidwood
and Turkish researcher and archaeo¬
logist Halet Cambel. They found
about 30 objects including small flat
disks, pins and awls in layers dating
from 7,200 B.C., which they claimed
were made from cold-forged native
copper. However, these artifacts, the
most ancient metal objects ever
found, had not been subjected to
spectrum analysis, making ¡t pre¬
mature to assert that they are made
from native copper.
Nevertheless, analytical research
makes it possible to affirm that in
many areas of the ancient world,
Man's development passed through
two major stages prior to the appea¬
rance of iron: the "arsenical" stage
of arsenical copper, provisionally
named arsenical bronze by scholars,
and the "tin" stage with the appea¬
rance of tin bronze, although arsenic
was still widely used due to the scar¬
city of tin.

BRANCUSI
i



an artist in quest
of the absolute
by Barbu Brezianu
BARBU BREZIANU, Romanian art critic.
Is a member of the International Association
ofArt Critics andan honorary research worker
at the Arts History Institute of the Romanian
Academy. He is the author of a major study
on Brancusi, published by the Academy of
the Socialist Republic of Romania, in 1974.
CONSTANTIN Brancusi was un¬
deniably one of the great
sculptors of the 20th century. And
yet today, 20 years after his death,
although the name of this Romanian
artist is universally known, his work
is not as fully appreciated as it
should be.
Brancusi was born in 1876 of pea¬
sant stock and was to retain a life¬
long nostalgia for the mountains and
forests of his native region of Oltenla.
His artistic education in Romania
lasted from 1894 to 1902, first at the
School of Arts and Crafts ¡n Craiova
and then, at the National School of w
Fine Arts in Bucharest. r
In 1922 Brancusi began to think of creating a monument to the dead of the
First World War. He executed this war memorial in 1937-1938 in a park in the town
of Tirgu-Jiu near his birthplace in Romania. Among the major works in the
ensemble of sculptures at Tirgu-Jiu are the Table of Silence (above), a table of
spiritual communion with the dead and the Endless Column (right), an axis of
communication between earth and heaven.

Photos below show two stages in the experimentation with forms that
preoccupied Brancusi throughout his life. In Sleeping Muse or The Sleep (below)
a marble sculpture executed in 1908, the influence of Rodin can still be seen.
Another Sleeping Muse (below right) displays the originality of Brancusi's search
for purity of form.
, In 1904 he moved to Paris, where he
studied at the famous Ecole des
Beaux-Arts until 1907. Two of his
fellow students were Georges Braque
and Fernand Léger. Paris was his
chosen place of residence for half
a century, and here he worked conti¬
nuously until his death in 1957, trans¬
forming marble, wood and metal Into
sculptures which frequently discon¬
certed his contemporaries by the
unfamiliarity of their underlying
concept.
Yet from very early on it was clear
that Brancusi could have had a first-
class academic career. In 1898 he
exhibited a bust in Craiova which
attracted much notice; and the Ecor-
ché (anatomical model) which he
made in 1901-1902 at the School of
Fine Arts in Bucharest, impeccable
¡n Its technical execution, revealed
the unusual virtuosity of the novice
sculptor. For he had studied anato¬
my painstakingly, even to the extent
of attending numerous dissections of
corpses.
He was a tireless worker, and had
soon mastered all the difficulties of
his craft. The bronzes and marbles
18

which he sculpted at the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts in Paris bear witness to
the sureness of his representations
of the human body, though he. was
soon to reject these, refusing as he
put it to sculpt "bronze and marble
corpses" because he was exasperat¬
ed by the technique which he believ¬
ed turned "the living body of a hu¬
man being" Into "my inert sculpture...
the corpse of my model".
During his last year at the Ecole
des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1906-7) Bran¬
cusi discovered Rodin. The French
sculptor, thirty years his senior, en¬
joyed almost universal renown at the
time. Under his influence Brancusi,
who was not yet doing direct carving,
began to work towards a more sen¬
sitive way of modelling which would,
through the right balance of light and
shadow, contrasts and volumes, bring
out the interior expression of the
model.
But Brancusi was not cut out to
be a. disciple: the vision which ins¬
pired him was his own. He could
not be satisfied by producing "one
sculpture a day like Rodin. I could
not work by his side, even though
he was fond of me. I did what he
did. I was imitating him, not inten¬
tionally, but I realized what was hap¬
pening. I was not happy these were
years spent in searching, groping to
find my way."
In 1952, five years before his death,
Brancusi in a "Homage to Rodin"
destroyed a myth which alleged that
he had worked in Rodin's studio. "Ever
since Michelangelo sculptors have
wanted to create the magnificent, but.
they have only succeeded in achiev¬
ing grandiloquence... Rodin came on
the scene and changed everything.
In his work man again became the
measure of things, the module from
The Prayer, a bronze funerary monument executed in 1907
for the cemetery of Biizau (Romania). It is now
in the National Gallery of the Bucharest Museum of Art.
which the final statue grows. He
made the form and content of sculp¬
ture human again. In 1906 Rodin
offered to take me as a pupil, but
I refused, because nothing can grow
in the shadow of tall trees. When
he heard my decision Rodin just said
'He's right; after all, he is just as
obstinate as I am.'"
Brancusi found his own way in the
years 1907-1908, as ¡s evident from
two examples of his work: one is
The Prayer (1907), a bronze monu¬
ment for a tomb in a Romanian ce¬
metery (today in the Bucharest Mu¬
seum); it represents a nude woman
kneeling with the body leaning for¬
ward, and is a perfect signpost to¬
wards everything that we shall find
in Brancusi's subsequent develop¬
ment. The statue is not simply a
woman praying: it is the quintessence
of prayer.
The second sculpture is The Kiss
(1908), one of Rodin's basic themes,
but in this case so far removed from
Rodin that it might almost be regard¬
ed as diametrically opposed to the
latter's work. It has been carved .
directly from a block of rough quar- r

, ried stone and ¡s composed of the
waist-length figures of two lovers
embracing. The same theme of two
human figures in an embrace this
time full-length is found again in a
work of funerary sculpture for which
Brancusi was given the commission
in Paris for the Montparnasse Cem¬
etery. In this version abstraction has
been taken one step further.
This nude woman praying, this nude
couple united for all eternity, present¬
ed an unusual sight in a cemetery
during the first decade of the twen¬
tieth century at a time when old
aesthetic and moral conventions still
prevailed. The statuary could have
caused amazement and even indigna¬
tion had it not been for the austere
simplicity of Brancusi's nudes, the
legacy, it could be suggested, of the
Byzantine tradition and the ancient
world.
These works form an important
milestone in the history of modern
sculpture. The Prayer, exhibited at
the 26th Salon des Artistes Indépen¬
dants in Paris in 1910, undoubtedly
influenced the works produced from
1911 onwards by the German sculp--
tor Wilhelm Lehmbruck, a Parisian by
adoption who in his turn and despite
his early death in 1919 exerted a
significant Influence on German sculp¬
ture during the period following the
First World War.
The Kiss produced in 1908 was
sculpted at the time when Brancusi
was rejecting modelling in clay as
done by Rodin, a method which he
had hitherto used himself. "Which
of us was it who said that clay was
like mud? He was quite right", he
said to Modigliani who was to be¬
come one of the greatest twentieth-
century painters and at that time was
beginning to sculpt. The significance
of this rejection of soft material
should not be underestimated: in the
stone of The Kiss Brancusi eliminated
all superfluous detail and achieved
the ultimate simplification of volume.
The Kiss ¡n its many variations fi¬
nally evolved into the Gate of the
Kiss (1938), one of the main elements
in a sculpture ensemble created as
a war memorial to the dead of the
First World War at Tirgu-Jiu in Roma¬
nia. The memorial also includes the
7ao/e of Silence, whose structure re¬
calls that of the drum-shaped stone
altars of Romanian village churches;
¡t is surrounded by twelve hour-glass-
shaped stone stools.
Another work in this group is the
remarkable Endless Column, compos¬
ed of sixteen elements with lozenge-
shaped or rhomboid planes, which
Brancusi likened to a "preliminary
design for a column which when en¬
larged would support the vaults of
heaven."
In his essay, "Brancusi and Mytho¬
logies", the great historian of reli¬
gions, Mircea Eliade, wrote as follows
about this 30-metre-hlgh column in
metallized cast iron: "It is significant
that Brancusi chose a motif ¡n Roma¬
nian folklore which has developed
from a mythological theme dating
back to prehistory... the 'heavenly
column' which supports the vaults of
heaven... The image must have
haunted Brancusi, for it was part of
the symbolism of ascension, flight,
transcendence... In many ancient
dwellings the central pillar was a
means of communication with the
heavens. "
We can see that the concepts un¬
derlying Brancusi's works, and even
the names of the statues, bear wit-,
ness to his personal spiritual vision,
so closely linked with the land and
whose origins go back to the ancient
culture of Thrace. It is this vision,
already exemplified in the first Kiss
of 1908, which will illuminate his ar¬
tistic output for the next half century.
It will also be responsible, even to¬
day, for Brancusi's reputation as a
"difficult" artist, that is to say diffi¬
cult to understand.
Yet around the same time, Picasso's
painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon
(1907) revolutionized art. It was a
first step towards Cubist expression
and reflected African art which the

and 1949.

The Kiss is one
of the
fundamental
themes in
Brancusi's work.
This remarkable
sculpture
represents the
force of love in
the face of
eternity. " We
feel a heart
beating there",
it has been said ;
the heart of the
world.
Western world was just discovering
and which would overthrow traditional
values ¡n the plastic arts in Western
culture for many years to come.
Brancusi was undoubtedly drawn
to African and Oceanic art for a
brief period, and it probably had
some influence on works of his which
have been lost or destroyed. But in
the same way as he had earlier refus¬
ed to work with Rodin he now.turned
. away from masks and fetishes and
also from the experimentations of
Picasso. He preferred to tread his
own solitary path, as dictated by his
own spiritual make-up, equilibrium,
serenity and philosophical wisdom.
Right up to the end of his life
Brancusi subjected his works (to¬
talling just under 300) to a continuous
process of purification. Henry Moore
denned the historical significance of
the Romanian sculptor and his works
in the following words: "Since the
Gothic, European sculpture had be¬
come overgrown with moss, weeds
all sorts of surface excrescences
which completely concealed shape.
It has been Brancusi's special mis¬
sion to get rid of this overgrowth,
and to make us once more shape-
conscious. To do this he has had
to concentrate on very simple direct
shapes, to keep his sculpture, as it
were, one-cylindered, to refine and
polish a single shape to a degree
almost too precious. Brancusi's
work, apart from its individual value,
has been of historical importance in
the development of contemporary
sculpture."
Brancusi's sculpture is a return to
the primeval element, the primary
molecule, the germ of all life: the
egg. Throughout his life he search¬
ed for, and achieved, . the fullest
possible significance of ovoid forms.
The First Cry, the First Step, the Be¬
ginning of the World, to mention only
three, are the fruits of a continuous
and profound process of reflection.
"Reality", he said, "is not the out¬
ward shape of things, but their essen¬
ce". And so the sequence of Sleeping
Muses was created, and the Birds
sequence which began in 1912 with
the Maiastra, a mythical bird figuring
in Romanian folk tales. The 1912
version of the latter, ¡n polished
bronze, ¡s not merely the suggestion
of a bird about to take flight: it is
the essence of flight and the whole
upward movement of life itself.
Between 1919 and 1940 Brancusi
continued the Bird ¡n Space sequen¬
ce which numbered twenty-two ver¬
sions, some in polished bronze and
others in marble of different colours,
their sheen and polish varying ac¬
cording to the material used. Each
curve describes an asymmetric ellip¬
se which merges into the heavens.
This image of movement towards
the absolute the sculptor even suc¬
ceeds in Imparting to the form of a
turtle, that most ponderous of beasts,
in his unusual Flying Turtle (1943)
This sculpture in marble is reduced
to its simplest expression, with an
oblique movement suggesting an up¬
ward pull against gravity, flight in a
dream.
We find the harmony of ovoid forms
again in the remarkable portraits of
Mademoiselle Pogany, about whom
the. sculptor-poet Jean Arp wrote:
Who is this beauty?
It is Mademoiselle Pogany, related to
Lady Shub-ad, the beautiful Sumerian
woman, and to Nefertiti.
Mademoiselle Pogany is the fairy god¬
mother of abstract sculpture.
She is made of arches, curves, pure
shells,
Encased in pearl. .,
Her eyes hatch white moons.
According to the Romanian art
expert Edgar Papu, Brancusi believed
that his materials were alive, suf¬
fused with their own powers of
thought and spirit. In the reflections
of Brancusi's lovingly polished bron¬
zes, Papu could even perceive light
being formed from the sculpted
material.
Right up to his death Brancusi
continued to search and make dis- ^
coveries. He can be regarded as a r

one he went further in his
search for simplicity and purity
of form.
precursor of kinetic art: in his studio
he sometimes used electric motors
to move his sculptures round on a
base. He invested the pedestal with
a new significance: instead of being
the mere support of a piece of sculp¬
ture it became an integral part of it,
an essential complement, a work in
itself. For the variations on a theme
¡n his sequential works, we find that
in each case the pedestal is a crea¬
tion in itself, rich in resonance like
the music to the lyrics.
In addition to being a virtuoso in
marble and bronze, Brancusi gave
new life to sculpture in wood, suffu¬
sing the carving with a secret and
Intense life of its own. We can see
this in the four hollows of the Spirit
of Buddha (dating from the 1920s),
later renamed the King of Kings,
which truly seem to be inhabited by
spirits. The same applies to Socrates
(1923), Chimera (1918) and Adam and
Eve (1917), an abstract work over
2 metres high carved in old oak on
a chestnut wood and limestone base,
which is a perfect example of the
pedestal as conceived by Brancusi,
i.e. an inseparable part of the total
concept of the sculpture.
Writers, poets, philosophers, pain¬
ters, sculptors, critics and art histo¬
rians a whole generation has reco¬
gnized the genius of Brancusi's art.
It ¡s as though the world has been
confronted with another, new world.
We will leave the last word to Jean
Arp ¡n his evocation of the studio of
the Endless Column on "one even¬
ing in May 1929".
Day was drawing to a close, but the
space around a bird was dreaming of
an arrowed flash of lightning and did
not notice that the bird had flown off
and was finding its way to the studio
of the endless column.
The cock was crowing cock-a-dood¬
le-doo and each sound made a zig
or a zag in its neck.
Brancusi's cock is a saw that is joy.
This cock saws the day of the tree
of light.
All these sculptures come from a
human fountain:
The cock
The seal
His self-portrait: the endless column.
The fish, giant king of the flint-rocks
swimming in a cloud.
The prodigal son who mounts the
steps by descending.
The penguins which lay the egg of
the newborn.
A fountain recounts these plastic fa¬
bles.
These are fables of such subtlety
that the revelations they offer us are
limitless.

RENE MAHEU
international co-operation
and the struggle
for development
by Paulo E. de Berrêdo Carneiro
RENE Maheu was sworn in as
Director-General of Unesco
on 14 November 1962, and I
was President of the 12th Session of
the Unesco General Conference when
he took the oath to abide by the
principles of our Constitution.
I had the privilege of being René
Maheu's friend and associate from
the time of Unesco's creation, and I
was able to see him at work during
the finest years of his life.
At the time he became Director-
General, René Maheu had been with
Unesco for just over 16 years. "I
often feel nostalgia for those far-off
days,"he said in his inaugural speech,
"not only because I was younger
then and my responsibilities were less
onerous, but also because there was
then within the Organization a feeling
for ideas and intellectual quality for
their own sakes: of course it was
sometimes naive, or makeshift from
the administrative point of view, but
still it imbued the Secretariat with a
sort of youthful vigour full of original
thought and enthusiasm."
"I wonder ¡f I can convey to you,"
René Maheu said later in this inaugu¬
ral speech,, "the depth of the feelings
aroused ¡n me by everything that
Unesco stands for... as a teacher
coming from a family who were all
teachers themselves, I have spent the
major part of my life concerned
solely with the austere and noble
vocation of education. If I listen to
PAULO E. DE BERREDO CARNEIRO

Board of which he was chairman during
1951-52. He was permanent delegate of
Brazil to Unesco from 1946 to 1965.
René Maheu at the age of 36,
when he was teaching
humanities and English at the
Muslim College in Fez (Morocco).
He also taught philosophy at the
French lycée in Fez. Five years
later, in 1946, he joined Unesco,
of which he was to be Director-
General from 1962 to 1974. René
Maheu died in December 1975.
a ,discussion about the fight against
illiteracy, my heart immediately evokes
memories of my paternal grand¬
parents, with whom I spent my
childhood and who were themselves
illiterate.
"...Yet it was from them that I
learned the things which I consider
to be truly fundamental to my cha¬
racter and beliefs; first and foremost
the thirst for education amongst
humble people, and their passionate
desire for social justice. Because of
this I was not surprised ¡n later years
when I witnessed the upheavals which
rocked colonized nations throughout
the world, ousting even the oldest,
proudest and most firmly-rooted ruling
powers.
"I recognized in this irresistible
movement the same search for en¬
lightenment and dignity, the same
thirst and the same passion, as had
been experienced by those who had
created my own heart and blood, but
were now being manifested on the
greater scale of humanity as a whole.
And since I have found in Unesco so
many personal raisons d'être and
potentials for achievement within a
framework of universality, it is right
that I should today commit myself to
Unesco without reservations."
Indeed, no commitment has ever
been honoured more faithfully.
As Unesco grew ¡n his hands, René
Maheu grew with it. Personal exper¬
ience had taught him that Unesco,
concerned as it was with things of
the mind, had to be an intellectual .
and spiritual reality itself if it was to
be truly effective.
His contacts with every kind ofr
23

person throughout the world had
been a living proof to him of the
unity of the human race. Humanity
is a single being composed of past
and future generations; thus if harm
is done to one of its members harm
is done to all.
Neither disapproval nor political
prejudice ever prevented René Maheu
from proclaiming Unesco's universal
vocation, nor from opening its doors
to welcome all those countries who
were ¡n the process of freeing them¬
selves from colonial domination.
When Vittorino Veronese, then Di¬
rector-General of Unesco, appointed
him as Deputy Director-General in
November 1959, René Maheu dis¬
played a flawless knowledge of
Unesco's means of action, the pro¬
blems it faced, the resources it re¬
quired and each of the many aspects
of a programme designed to meet
the needs of all its members, whether
great or small, rich or poor, in the
fields of education, science and cul¬
ture. Already at that time, no one
was better qualified to lead Unesco
than René Maheu.
When the six years of his mandate
were up, Unesco's member states
(whose numbers had increased con¬
siderably following the accession of
many African countries to indepen¬
dence) unanimously re-elected him to
office on 19 October 1968.
This was a just reward for the
results that he had achieved with
equal success in the two domains
intellectual co-operation and aid for
development which he had always
striven to render complementary.
In years to come, when a historian
examines Unesco's archives, he will
find the documents bearing witness
to René Maheu's twelve years of lea¬
dership to be of Inestimable value in
understanding the intellectual and
political problems of our time.
René Maheu anticipated this, and
the care he took to depict the truest
possible image of Unesco in his writ¬
ings and speeches is the best proof
of his respect and love for the Orga¬
nization.
The anthology which contains a
large part of his works, under the
expressive title of Civilisation de l'Uni¬
versel, makes it possible for all those
who share the hopes and fears of our
century to participate in the efforts
being made by Unesco to create a
new social order based on the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights.
René Maheu was proud to devote
the most important part of his life, his
thoughts and actions to the search
for a way of creating a peaceful
world devoid of divisive cultural and
economic inequalities in which each
individual would be consciously aware
that his share of happiness formed a
part of happiness on a universal

DE L'UNIVERSEL»
Beyond national sovereignty
I am deeply convinced that in the
world of today, true independence of
nations goes beyond the classic attri¬
butes of sovereignty and derives es¬
sentially from autonomy in national
development. However, since dev¬
elopment can only take place from
within; and as education, science and
culture are without a doubt vital fac¬
tors in any such development, ¡t fol¬
lows that the part played by Unesco
in these domains which constitute its
field of operations are a factor of true
independence.
Development as we understand it
today means the development of man
by man and for man. What the 20th
century, making use of socio-econo¬
mic terminology, describes as dev¬
elopment, is the same thing that the
18th century, in more strictly poli¬
tical terms, called freedom.
The dawn of a planetary
civilization
... Mankind is moving towards a
planetary civilization. It is being mov¬
ed ¡n this direction by a twofold im¬
pulsion, firstly the unceasing advance
of technology, and secondly oy a
moral aspiration just as ineluctable,
namely man's desire to attain humani¬
ty. For Unesco there is no nobler task
and none more. in keeping with its
mission than to work for the
achievement of a united mankind, ¡n
control of itself and of the universe.
Unesco, Paris, 22 October 1964 (13th
Session of Unesco's General Conference).

Development
and human dignity
The transformation of the world and
its economic and technological pro¬
gress would be meaningless if man,
as a physical being possessing a
body and a mind, who is both the gen¬
erator and beneficiary of all these
necessary changes, were not the ul¬
timate goal of progress. Development
is no more than a tool to be used for
creating a final product. This product
is human dignity.
Paris, 20 November 1963. Reopening of
j, the Institut Français de Presse.
Man : the alpha and omega
of development
Man does not only constitute the
resources and materials of develop¬
ment, nor is he simply its agent; he is
its true purpose. After all, who and
what are being developed, and for
whom? The answer is man; for his
own sake. Of course it is a fine thing
that human beings and the activities
of society are nowadays looked upon
as means of production, so to speak,
rather than mere consumer goods.
However, we should not be content
to let matters rest here nor congra¬
tulate ourselves too readily; for an
economy which makes use of man to
increase productivity cannot be des
cribed as humanist. In fact the only
kind of economy which can be quali¬
fied as humanist is one which consi¬
ders man to be both the alpha and
omega of development.
Paris, 22 April 1964. Lecture given at the
Sorbonne on the Invitation of the Univer¬
sity of Paris and the French Institute of
Economic and Social Development.
Education and human change
Nothing at the present time is as
important as education. I am not just
speaking from an ethical or moral
point of view, but rather from a realist
and even political one; for educational
problems have now acquired political
dimensions.
The times have passed when minis¬
tries of education were concerned
solely with technicalities. In all coun¬
tries, whether they are already deve¬
loped or are still developing and as
far as education is concerned every
country is still developing a mutation
is taking place in mankind, and it is
precisely in education that it is
revealed.
We are Indeed witnessing a real
mutation of mankind, which involves
profound and radical changes in edu¬
cation. When these changes fail to
take place, educational problems take
on a political aspect and reveal them¬
selves in disturbances which can
affect the stability of governments
and sometimes even whole regimes.
Unesco, Paris, 26 August 1965. Report to
Unesco's Executive Board.
The art of learning
The continual evolution of our civi¬
lization, together with the constant
growth and renewal of human know¬
ledge, make it imperative for every
man and woman to keep up-to-date
what he or she learnt earlier in life.
Thus the purpose of education is not
so much to provide once and for all
a fixed sum of knowledge as to teach
the art of learning: and to make learn¬
ing a lifelong process.
Bangkok, 22 November 1965. Conference k
of Ministers of Education ¡n Asia. r

the globe from one industrialized
country to the next, leaving

LWar on illiteracy
I believe the fight against illiteracy
to be the most urgent and exciting
task facing our generation.
In order to eliminate illiteracy we
need to fight simultaneously on two
fronts. First and foremost we must
make sure that there is compulsory
primary education everywhere, since
otherwise legions of new Illiterates
will incessantly be joining the ranks
of those bequeathed by the past. At
the same time we must redouble our
efforts to reduce the huge existing
backlog of adult illiterates.
In this age when science is opening
up the way to the stars, it is totally
inacceptable for two-fifths of mankind
to remain the prisoners of ancient
deprivations. Do we really want man¬
kind to be divided, with one half
reaching the stars and the other left
behind in caves? No peace could
possibly be lasting in the face of this
terrible injustice whereby the benefits
of progress are so unequally distri¬
buted.
Copenhagen, 26 August 1964. Conference

The educational values
of sport
Sport is an order of chivalry, an
honour, a code of ethics and aesthe¬
tics, whose members are recruited
from all peoples and social classes
and intermingled ¡n a worldwide fra¬
ternity. Sport represents a truce.
In our technological societies,
where we are subject to the merciless
law of work, being judged by what
we have and having only what we
earn, it provides a free and sublime
enrichment of our leisure hours. In
"We need to take a fresh look at
out-of-school education for young
people and adults, particularly in
terms of training illiterate adults for
more productive jobs, expanding
workers' education facilities, linking
functional literacy to agricultural
development, and thereby enabling
millions of men and women to
participate in the life of the
community."
René Maheu, Bangkok, 1965.
Conference of Ministers of
Education In Asia.

this era beset by antagonism and
conflict, ruled by the lust for power
and pride, sport is a sublime respite
in which fair competition ends in
mutual respect and friendship...
... Sport is education, of the truest
and most positive variety, that is to
say education of the character. It
¡s a science, because a sportsman
must have patiently acquired self-
knowledge in order to attain perfec¬
tion.
Sport is culture, because the ephe¬
meral movements with which it embel¬
lishes space and time highlight, by
giving them a dramatic form, some
of the most fundamental and thus
the most profound and far-reaching
values of nations or indeed of the
entire human race. Sport is also
culture in that it creates beauty, espe¬
cially for those who have least
opportunity to enjoy aesthetic
pleasures...
What could be more barbaric than
this public identification with cham¬
pions, this national appropriation of
an individual's or a team's victory?
These flags and anthems, these ban¬
ner headlines in the newspapers
screaming "We won" or "National
defeat" do you not agree that they
are an odious exaggeration of the
spontaneous reactions of a crowd,
and also a shameless exploitation of
its most generous impulses? At all
events it is the direct opposite of a
catharsis: it is a regression to a
primitive mentality.
Unesco, Paris, 28 October 1963. Address
on the centenary of the birth of Pierre de
Coubertin.
Sport and individual
self-expression
Sport ought to play the same for¬
mative part in adult leisure as it does
in young people's education. How¬
ever, if adults are to use their leisure
hours for sport, they will require faci¬
lities of a standard equal or superior
to that usually found in schools and
universities. It must be admitted that
in many countries these facilities are
rudimentary, and where they exist,
they are not always of a purely edu¬
cational nature, aimed solely at giving
an individual the opportunity for free
self-expression.
Tokyo, March 1965. Message presenting
the "Manifesto on Sport" published by
the International Council of Sport and
Physical Education.
Universities in
an age of change
Nothing is of greater importance
for a university than to apprehend
the significance of this vital moment
which heralds a new age. If univer¬
sities should fail to achieve self-
renewal they would disappear, at any
rate in the form that we know and
value, together with their wealth of
humanism bequeathed by ancient
traditions.
"Sport is probably the aspect
of modern life which is most
widely encountered through¬
out the worldthe only one,
perhaps, which is common
to both industrialized com¬
munities and developing
countries. It is also, in a
steadily increasing degree,
one of the most vigorous
forces in international rela¬
tions. There are few inter¬
national exchanges, encoun¬
ters or contacts which arouse
so much mass feeling as
sports events."

prove able to accomplish this self-

changes which are essential if they
are to recruit their members and
achieve intellectual excellence on the
widest possible basis of social
justice.

The search for cultural
identity
Every struggle for freedom involves
a fundamental need for a renewed
awareness of the nation's cultural
Identity. Because of this, the first
steps to be taken on gaining Inde¬
pendence consist in re-establishing
the national culture which has be¬
come estranged and in creating new
conditions for its existence so that
it can be master of its own destiny.

when René Maheu was awarded the de¬
gree of Doctor honoris causa of the Uni¬
versity of Algiers.
Towards a new
humanism
We need to evolve a new form of
humanism which will strike a balance
between science and culture, between
science and technology, and within
the confines of science itself bet¬
ween the natural and human sciences.
In an age when man's domination of
realms once unheard-of, such as
atoms or the stars, is continually
being extended, he needs to keep a
tight grip on himself and his percep¬
tions, not only because he ¡s the
measure of all things, but much more
because he chooses the path of his
own history and is the sum of all his
endeavours. Man's existence only has
meaning as a total concept.
At the present time there is no task
more urgent than to provide modern
man with a new meaning embracing
the whole range of his ideals. I be¬
lieve universities are the best place
for working out this humanist synthe¬
sis with all the necessary freedom
and discipline of thought.
Cracow, 31 January 1964. Address at the
Jagiellonian University of Cracow (Poland).
The nature and meaning
of science
"Knowledge is power", said Fran¬
cis Bacon. True enough the whole
of our technological civilization is
based on this fact. But knowledge
implies, first and foremost, thinking
conceiving naure in a certain way.
Knowledge ¡s scientific only by and
through the mind that produces it
and which alone gives it meaning
for man and relevance to things.
Science is not just a collection of
facts and formulae which can confer
power on man without more ado. To
think along these lines is to regard
knowledge as magic. But science is
the opposite of magic. Scientific
knowledge is simply the crystalliza¬
tion of certain acts of the mind. It is
above all this mind this scientific
spirit without which knowledge could
not bear fruit or even have meaning,
that must be Implanted and developed
at every level of intelligence and
activity.
Geneva, 4 February 1963. Opening of
U.N. Conference on the Applications of
Science and Technology for the Benefit of
the Less Developed Areas.
Science and intellectual
liberation
The acquiring of knowledge, espe¬
cially practical knowledge, takes far
too great a precedence over the
acquiring of the scientific spirit. This
spirit is Inadequately instilled into the
minds of middle and lower grade
officials, who usually concentrate on
remembering the facts and formulae
of science which they then apply
mechanically.
Teaching of this sort, where mem¬
orizing is given priority over the fos¬
tering of intelligence, has more to do
with training than with education in
the true sense. It leads right away
from science, which is essentially a
principle of intellectual liberation and
the mastery of nature. It also leads
right away, from what developing
countries most need ¡f they are to .
regain control of their history.
There is much discussion of stres¬
ses and lack of balance caused by
the opposition between an imported
scientific and technological civiliza¬
tion and traditional national cultures
¡n developing countries. Of course
this problem does exist, just as ¡n
every case where a society is subject¬
ed to a process of rapid evolution
under the influence of external fac¬
tors. But this opposition and the
resulting stresses really occur be¬
cause the countries concerned are
not presented with the true face of
science.
For science constitutes a civiliza¬
tion or rather it is the only potentially
universal civilization. But to these
countries it seems more like a sort
of magic from abroad which gives
them sudden power. And if this
civilizing factor is not apparent to
28

those who only extract from science
its practical technological advantages,
this is mainly because science teach¬
ing is neglecting the vital point,
namely, the scientific spirit and the
methodology of science.
Geneva, 8 February 1963. Address to the
U.N. Conference on the Applications of
Science and Technology.
A universal cultural heritage
The notion of a universal cultural
heritage, which belongs to mankind
as a whole and must be preserved
in the interests of the world commu¬
nity, ¡s a characteristic feature of our
age. It is quite different from the
purely national, not to say nationalist,
concept of culture, which in the past
often gave rise to incomprehension
or even contempt towards other civi¬
lizations...
... The works which are today des¬
cribed as monuments differ widely in
their character and appearance, but
they have one thing in common; they
form an integral part of the environ¬
ment which man has created in which
to live, devised by him with regard
both for spiritual values and for the
material needs of his life. Hence
beneath their purely decorative as¬
pect, these monuments express what
¡s most primal and most meaningful
in man's being, namely his roots in .
history. Monuments are that history
turned to stone.
They may be the humble remains
of prehistoric dwellings or sumptuous
palaces from the great classic ages,
temples once devoted to religions
which are now dead or holy places to
which worshippers still flock, complex
edifices which we owe to the subtle
skill of great artists or unpretentious
examples of traditional architectural
craftsmanship. But each of them
bears witness to a particular way of
life and expresses the aspirations,
tastes and beliefs of the men who
built it.
Unesco, Paris, 2 June 1964. Opening of
the International Campaign for Monuments.
Continuing its major international
campaign launched ten years ago for
the preservation of Venice, Unesco
organized a World Week in the city
in September 1976. The participation
of internationally famous artists
(musicians, actors, dancers, singers
and comedians) from different parts
of the world gave the gala week a
brilliance appropriate to the
renowned city of the Doges. Left,

Cathedral in Venice.
Unesco's humanist mission
It has often been said but it can¬
not be said too often that Unesco
is an organization concerned with
man and his destiny.
All its undertakings are based on
a particular conception of mankind
which it is continually trying to pro¬
mote and put into effect on a univer¬
sal scale. In all Unesco's work,
however technical or specialized it
may be, there is always a purpose,
a meaning, a dimension which bring
out the totality of man that is in each
of us and the oneness of humanity
that is in all of us.
Unesco is thus, by Its very nature,
committed to the spirit of synthesis,
and we must make sure that neither
the lure of erudition, nor any demand
for efficiency, draws it so far into
specialization that ¡t loses sight of
the humanistic vocation which is
Inseparable from its ethical mission.
Unesco, Paris, 13 December 1965. Sym¬
posium on Science and Synthesis.
The spirit of justice
and tolerance
Unesco is founded on the belief
that in the long run it is the freedom
of man which decides the path of
history, and ¡n particular which makes
the choice between war and peace
"wars are born in the minds of men"
so that there can only be true peace
as long as the mind abides by an
order which it respects.
What is this order? It ¡s that of
the dignity of man, which finds its
expression as specified in the various
human rights; whose authority in
society is called justice; and whose
prevalence in people's hearts is
called love, or at least tolerance.
This is the reason why the founders
of Unesco stated that "it is in the
minds of men that the defences of
peace must be constructed".
Education, science and culture are
the great disciplines which shape and
inspire the mind; and Unesco's mis¬
sion, Its ultimate reason for existing,
is to use these disciplines and I ^
stress the word usein order to instil r
29

as deeply as possible in the cons¬
ciences of people and nations this
desire for justice and tolerance which

Geneva, 7 July 1966. Address to the U.N.
Economic and Social Council for Unesco's
20th anniversary.
Human rights,
justice and peace
It ¡s Human Rights, as defined in
the Universal Declaration of 1948,
which inspire the whole of Unesco's
Work, and give it its meaning; Its work
for the establishment of standards,
the aid it furnishes to development,
Its promotion of intellectual effort,
in fact all its activities are designed
to facilitate the advent of a civilization
of the universal.
Peace itself has no value and,
strictly speaking, no reality for Unes¬
co unless it is founded on justice,
which is nothing other than human
rights in action. Peace, for Unesco,
is not the illusory security or transient
stability represented by the domin¬
ance of one power or even a balance
of power, the goal pursued so despe¬
rately in an armaments race that is
as vain as it is exhausting.
Peace is justice acknowledged and
this, we know full well, can be attained
only by radical changes in the struc¬
ture of societies and the organization
of the world. From Unesco's point of
view, in which the static has no place,
the cause of peace and the cause of
progress coincide.
The unity of mankind
... Beyond the relative effectiveness
of its work, Unesco's greatest triumph
is that it perhaps more than any
other organization has enabled the
men and women of today, despite
the diversity of their cultures, interests
and regimes, to show, at least poten¬
tially, the universality of their convic¬
tion that mankind is one, sharing a
common nature and ¡deal. And it is
in this way, paradoxically, that Unesco
is coming to represent a force with
which the political realists will have
to reckon.

published by Unesco for Its 25th anniver¬
sary, Unesco 1972.
Towards human
brotherhood
International co-operation is both
a necessity and an ideal.
It is a necessity for modern civili¬
zation, because the opportunities for
development which this civilization
offers can only be exploited, the pro¬
blems of development which it pre¬
sents can only be resolved, by orga-
AGAINST RACISM AND APARTHEID. During a quarter of a century Unesco has
sought to combat the injustices and iniquities for which racism and the policy of
apartheid are responsible in the world. "We shall have to struggle for many more
years, "declared René Maheu, at Unesco's H.Q., in 1963, "before education at
every level and in all subjects can free the rising generations from the distorting
influence of stereotypes and prejudices."
nlzing the communication of know¬
ledge, the confrontation of ideas,
the pooling of resources and the
conjunction of efforts within Increas¬
ingly extensive and complex systems
which transcend the boundaries of
nations, however vast and powerful
these may be.
It is also an ideal and by that I
do not mean a dream, but a moral
imperative for men are coming to
realize more and more that they are
morally as well as physically inter¬
dependent.
Each of us is increasingly aware
that he cannot be completely happy
if others are destitute or live under
bondage, that he cannot be really at
peace with himself if others are
waging war against one another in
short, that he cannot attain his full
stature as a man if injustice and
want are preventing other men all
of them from attaining that stature,
like him and with him. I say all of
them, for, once we admit in our
thoughts or in our deeds, that some
shall be excluded from humanity's
family, we lose a part of our own
individual humanity.
Such is the twofold justification
for International co-operation, which
institutions like Unesco are designed
to serve, and I call upon you to de¬
dicate yourselves to it from now
onwards, with all the enthusiasm and
generosity of your youth.
For, although international co-ope¬
ration needs sound organization and
technique if it is to be effective, it
cannot be achieved by those means
alone. Even more, it needs a certain
openness of mind, a certain warmth
of heart, ¡n short a readiness to serve,
which itself Implies a conversion to
human brotherhood.
It is to this great cause that I call
upon you to dedicate yourselves.
Please do not misunderstand me.
I do not ask you to abandon those
tasks which you are to undertake
within the context of your family, your
career, your country. I only ask you
to remember, when carrying out these
tasks, that you also belong to a lar¬
ger family, a broader life and a vaster
community, which is mankind.
I ask you to realize that the mean¬
ing and value of your existence go
beyond the immediate confines of
your own personal destiny and that'
you are taking part ¡n the same
splendid adventure as the rest of
mankind, an adventure which calls
for understanding and effort from all.
Lastly I ask you to regard every man
you meet as a brother, that is, as
your equal ¡n dignity, with the same
needs and the same hopes, regard¬
less of his race, country, language,
social status or beliefs.
You are growing up in a period of
technological miracles. Your genera¬
tion will reach the stars, but ¡t is
Man that I should like you, above all,
to reach, to respect and cherish, in
yourselves and in others.

AN
INTERNATIONAL
CULTURAL
CENTRE
IN THE HILLS
OF BURGUNDY
by Philippe Ouannès
IN January 1975, the people of the
French town of Avallon, on the
edge of the Morvan hills, the gateway
to Burgundy, witnessed the arrival of
a number of earth-moving machines
which set about levelling off the top
of a small mound close to the town
centre. Some months later they were
intrigued to see taking shape a weird
piece of futuristic architecture with
roofs which also served as porches
and with doors set into the roofs.
This was the International Docu¬
mentation and Cultural Activities Cen¬
tre (Centre International de Documen¬
tation et d'Animation Culturelle)
which opened ¡n June 1975. It got
into its stride almost at once by hold¬
ing, in turn, an exhibition of "One
hundred drawings by Japanese chil¬
dren" and a Unesco philatelic exhi¬
bition and by hosting in October a
travelling exhibition on the art of T. , * ». , ». . ,
n^ani, Am<,ni,»HL The International Documentation and Cultural
Oceania, organized by Unesco. Activities Centre in Avallon is designed on avant
However, events such as these are V garde lines. Inside the buildings mobile partitions
enable rooms to be adapted for different uses,
		 including exhibitions, conferences and film shows.
The section of Avallon
lying between the
Clock Tower and the
Square of St. Lazare is
one of the most
ancient parts of this
small town in
Burgundy. The house
at the corner of the
square dates from the
15th century.

, only part of the many activities under¬
taken by the Centre, which was de¬
signed ' to cater for the varied and
complementary requirements of its
sponsors: the French National Com¬
mission for Unesco, the municipal
authorities of Avallon and the Asso¬
ciation Culturelle de l'Avallonnais, a
regional cultural association of inter¬
national scope.
Their alms were of two kinds: first¬
ly to provide the French public with
information about Unesco's ideals
and programme and also about the
activities of organizations in the Uni¬
ted Nations family, and secondly to
arrange meetings, symposia and var¬
ious other events embodying these
ideals and enabling Avallon to play a
full part as a host town and a meeting
place.
But there was also another aim,
namely to create, somewhere other
than in a capital city or large town,
an international centre for documen¬
tation and cultural life and bring in¬
formation closer to those for whom it
is Intended. In this respect the Cen¬
tre is an outstanding example of its
kind. As an attempt at decentraliza¬
tion it has proved a big success.
The "weird building" was to be¬
come a hive of activity and between
June 1975, when it opened, and June
1976, ¡t was visited by almost 10,000
persons. School groups, cultural so¬
cieties and passing visitors were thus
enabled to attend various events such
as exhibitions (for example an exhi¬
bition of African art, accompanied by
film shows) audio-visual montages
(such as one organized to mark Inter¬
national Women's Year, using mate¬
rial supplied by Unesco) and so on.
Not only is the Centre a focal point
of regional activities but it has also
become widely used for meetings and
receptions. Seminars and training
courses on integrated environmental
planning have also been held there
for specialists from Algeria, Benin,
Brazil, Canada, Ivory Coast, Japan,
Laos, Lebanon, Madagascar and
Venezuela.
In March 1976, the Centre was visit¬
ed, at the invitation of the French
National Commission for Unesco, by
the Secretaries-General and repre
sentatives of the National Commis¬
sions for Unesco of Algeria, the Cen¬
tral African Republic, Chad, the Arab
Republic of Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Mo¬
rocco, Nigeria, Switzerland, Tunisia
and Zaire.
Among the topics discussed by the
Secretaries-General at one of their
working sessions was the role of the
National Commissions with regard to
Information and liaison between Na¬
tional Commissions, and between the
Commissions and Unesco.
One of the principal responsibilities
of these Commissions is to make
Unesco's projects more widely known
and to set them more firmly into the
cultural context of each of the Orga¬
nization's Member States. This is
also one of the objectives of the Do¬
cumentation and Cultural Activities
Centre. As Mr. Yves Brunsvick, Se¬
cretary-General of the French Natio¬
nal Commission, pointed out, "What
is needed is to draw on the fund of
ideas in Unesco and put them into
wide circulation through the agency
of the National Commissions. "
In addition, the Centre arranges
visits and study sessions for promi¬
nent figures from abroad who are in
France under the auspices of Unesco.
The co-operation and hospitality of
various sectors of the local commu¬
nity and the municipal authorities
have enabled all these guests to find
out about the everyday life and attrac¬
tions of a French town of some
10,000 inhabitants with a rich histori¬
cal and artistic past, situated in' one
of the most beautiful regions of
France.
The location of the building and its
low profile were dictated by a speci¬
fic concern to respect the urban envi¬
ronment. Indeed, only a few hundred
yards away, as the crow flies, is the
clock tower, one of the town's most
ancient monuments. Stretching away
from the tower is the "Terreaux", a
terraced walk providing a vantage
point from which one can see a pa¬
norama of the town and its surround¬
ings, the magnificent Burgundian val¬
leys steeped in a singularly intense
light.
The Centre is built in a fold in the
ground so that it in no way obstructs
or spoils the view of the surrounding
countryside in which the golden corn
alternates with "the lush green pas¬
ture ¡n which herds of sleek white
cattle peacefully graze", and in which
the ochre tiled roofs typical of Bur¬
gundy and steeples and turrets faced
with slates nestle among clumps of
trees.
The Centre thus fulfils several func¬
tions both nationally and internatio¬
nally. The building also had to be
sufficiently versatile to fulfil a number
of functions with rooms of various
sizes tailored to meet different re¬
quirements: exhibition and projection
rooms, working and meeting rooms,
space for filing and storing documen¬
tation, reproduction and information
material as well as audio-visual
equipment (magnetic tapes, films,
slides, etc.).
For in addition to Unesco docu¬
ments, the Centre also distributes
material produced by the United Na¬
tions and its principal specialized
agencies including the World Health
Organization, the International Labour
Office and the Food and Agriculture
Organization.
Two figures alone are enough to
illustrate this intensive flow of infor¬
mation ¡n all the fields in which inter¬
national organizations are involved.
In 1968 more than 7,500 documents
concerning the United Nations were
circulated (periodicals, brochures,
audio-visual material, etc.) as against
more than 75,000 in 1975. Growth on
this scale speaks for itself. And one
might add that the periodical most in
demand at the Centre is... the "Unesco
Courier".
Finally, the Centre is also a perma¬
nent focus for local cultural activities.
The mass of Unesco documentation
and audio-visual material available
for on-the-spot use by the people of
Avallon, as well as the opportunities
to exchange views and make perso¬
nal contacts, provide a basis for
continuous activity, unique of its
kind, to promote international under¬
standing and co-operation. The ex¬
pression coined in Avallon itself,
"Unesco ¡n the community" has now
become a firm reality.

Avallon, the Chapter Tower

OUR SPLIT BRAIN
Sir,
May I enthuse loud and long about
the magnificent "Courier" issue on the
"Split Brain" (January 1976). I have
heard its praises sung by neurologists,
psychologists, psychiatrists and humble
educators like myself. It most certainly
is one of the very best pieces of "po¬
pularization" of scientific material ever
published anywhere. In this issue you
have really excelled yourselves.

ETHICALLY INDIFFERENT
BRAIN RESEARCH ?
Sir,
The "Unesco Courier" issue on brain
research (January 1976) is fascinating,
but only to the point where it becomes
frightening. Our century has already wit¬
nessed chemists who have discovered
the most dreadful poison gases; physi¬
cists who could not prevent others from
using their inventions for the production
of nuclear bombs; genetic experts with
ambitions to correct defective hereditary
traits.
And now neurophysiologists, psychia¬
trists, brain researchers, biologists and
others initiate us into the very free re¬
search which they do coolly and impar¬
tially. They not only treat rats, birds,
' dolphins, bulls, goats, cats, monkeys, but
also premature babies and patients with
paranoic or other behaviour disorders,
by means of drugs, injections, electric
shocks, cranial probes, two-way radio
transmissions, evaluation by computers,
etc.
Ano* all this, of course, for the greater
honour of science (or of scientists ?) in
the best interests of the patients and for
the benefit of animals and human beings.
(Who, by the way, has invested us hu¬
mans with the right to implant metal
probes into the cranium of a gibbon?)
Distinguished by his "cool resear¬
cher's mentality" and unafraid of any
consequences of his work is Prof J.M.R.
Delgado, of Spain, (author of one of your
articles).
It is sad that an uncounted number
of persons have to suffer from the results
of such research. They are systemati¬
cally ill-treated, tortured and abused in
the name of research.
How can people trust scientists such
as these researchers into the human
brain who fail to devote even one para
graph to the ethical or social conside¬
rations of their work ?
Ingo Knaup
Wettingen, Switzerland
Editor's Note - Professor J.M.R. Delgado
has sent us the following reply :
Ethical issues in brain research are ot
paramount importance, and most inves¬
tigators are deeply concerned about
them. In my own book ("Physical
Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychoci-
vilized Society," Harper & Row, 1969),
a full chapter (No. 21) is devoted to
"Ethical Considerations," and another
two deal with related subjects: "Social
Dependence and Individual Freedom"
(No. 24) and "Natural Causality and In¬
telligent Planning in the Organization of
Human Behavior" (No. 25). Literature on
ethical awareness ot scientists involved
in brain research is abundant (see bi¬
bliography in "Experimentation with Hu¬
man Beings," by J. Katz, Russell Sage
Foundation, New York 1972).
It is well known that as a result ot
recent developments in brain research,
thousands of patients suffering from
brain tumors and other disorders have
been operated on and saved. Discover¬
ies in the new. field of neuropharmaco¬
logy have made it possible to release
hundreds of thousands of mental pa¬
tients from psychiatric hospitals and
return them to community life.
Science should not be blamed for the
misuse of knowledge. The destructive
application of atomic energy demonstrat¬
ed the functional inadequacy, of the
human brain which has not yet learned
to solve behavioral conflicts reasonably.
Instead of resorting to emotional phra¬
seology to criticize brain research, re¬
vealing personal fears and prejudices,
it would be preferable to present facts
and offer intelligent solutions to the
problems facing humanity which deeply
preoccupy neurophysiology investiga¬
tors.

EARTHQUAKES AMD
NUCLEAR UNDERGROUND
EXPLOSIONS
Sir,
I wonder why your issue on earth¬
quakes (May 1976) failed to mention that
underground nuclear explosions can be
a possible cause of earthquakes.
Michel Ziller
Llverdun, France
Sir,
Reading in your issue on earthquakes
that on several occasions dam construc¬
tion has accidentally triggered off earth¬
quakes, I wonder if it is also a fact that
underground nuclear explosions may
have been the cause of certain seismic
events.
Dora Tim
Minugio, Switzerland
Editor's note: E.M. Fournier d'Albe, who
is in charge of Unesco's programme in
geophysics related to natural disasters
and their prevention, replies :
In several cases underground nuclear
explosions have been followed by small
earthquakes in the vicinity ot the explo¬
sion. Such earthquake activity is limited
to an area within 100 or 200 km. of the
explosion site and earthquakes which
have followed such explosions are of
magnitude (energy) less than the explo¬
sion itself. There is no evidence so far
that underground nuclear explosions
trigger distant or destructive earthquakes.
A ROCK-FORTRESS
IN THE CAUCASUS
Sir,
Readers may be interested to know
about a discovery made by an expedition
of the North Ossetian Museum of Local
Lore, History and Economy, in the
U.S.S.R. Founded in 1893, our museum
is the oldest institution of its kind in the
Caucasus.
Recently, an expedition looking for
ancient rock-carvings came across a
hitherto unknown castle near the village
of Zadalesk, 2,000 metres above sea
level.
We had to use mountaineering equip¬
ment to climb the 60-metre rock to reach
the castle. There was no path and Its
builders and defenders must have used
rope ladders or chains. The former oc¬
cupants had hewed out a patio for the
castle, and 20 metres above it in a cave¬
like niche we found a medieval kitchen.
Over the main entrance we discovered
a rock carving and the imprints of human
hands. It is difficult to tell what the mys¬
terious lines and forms of the carvings
could mean. Perhaps they were the
mark of the builders.
M. M. Bliyev, a professor at the North
Ossetian State University who took part
in the expedition, has commented: "The
castle in the rock of Zadalesk is a uni¬
que medieval structure. It is different
from any other military fortifications in
the region. Its architecture, its mason¬
ry of local stone and its finish are superb
for the Middle Ages."

NEW ENGLAND'S
FIRST FOUR STATES
Sir,
May I point out an error in the colour
illustration caption on page 22 of your
American Bicentennial issue (July 1976).
New England at the time of the Ameri¬
can Revolution had only four of the
13 English colonies (not six as stated).
The four were New Hampshire, Massa¬
chusetts Bay (today Massachusetts)
Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Vermont
was separated from New Hampshire and
became the 14th state in 1791. Maine
was separated from Massachusetts and
became the 23rd state in 1820.

Niederhoffer's award was for an act of out¬
standing sportsmanship when his oppo¬
nent in last year's North American Open
Squash Championship was injured, and
Zatopek and Mathias were selected for
the awards as a tribute to exceptional
careers consistently marked by their high
sporting spirit. The prizes were presented
by Mr. Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, Unesco's
Director-General, at Unesco headquarters
In Paris.
Israeli device for
probing water pollution
A remote sensing method capable not
only of locating pollutants in water, but
also of determining their concentration and
origin industrial, agricultural or domes¬
tic has been developed by Israel's Ins¬
titute of Technology. Using photo equip¬
ment coupled with sophisticated optical
and electronic devices, it is based on the
principle that a measurable relationship
exists between colour as recorded on film
and the quality of the water being photo¬
graphed.
Prehistoric Indus Valley
town unearthed
A well-planned town laid out on a grid
pattern and resembling Moenjodaro, one
of the major sites of the ancient Indus
Valley civilization, has been unearthed at
Banawali, in the north Indian State of Ha-
ryana. Excavations at Banawali have re¬
vealed pottery, bangles, flint blades and
beads typical of the Indus Valley culture
that flourished some 5,000 years ago.
Unesco is conducting an international cam¬
paign to conserve Moenjodaro (in Pakistan)
and a commemorative medal is available
in gold, silver or bronze, from the Philatelic
Service, Unesco, Place de Fontenoy, 75700
Paris. Proceeds from the sale of the medal
go to the Moenjodaro fund.
In praise
of traditional building
"Habitat", a new Unesco series of 48
colour slides, illustrates the beauty and
practicality of traditional buildings around
the world, which are rich in diversity and
are the work not of architects but of the
people living in them. The "Habitat" se¬
ries Is available at 40 Fr francs a set from
the Photographical Service of Unesco,
Place de Fontenoy, 75700 Paris.
'Operation Tiger'
The Soviet Union is to undertake a count
of all its tigers, starting in the Far East of
the country, home of one of the largest
species, the Ussuri tiger. Tigers are also
found in southern Turkmenia, along the
River Amu-Darya and in Transcaucasia.
The census is part of "Operation Tiger",
a country-by-country survey to discover
the tiger's chances of survival, sponsored
by the International Union for the Conser¬
vation of Nature and Natural Resources.
U.N. conference
on encroaching deserts
The United Nations Conference on De¬
sertification, scheduled for autumn 1977,
will probably be held in Nairobi (Kenya).
In 1974 the U.N. General Assembly called
for international co-operation in trying to
stop desertification of arable and pasture
land. One ninth of the earth's surface is
affected by this "march of the deserts".
Unesco, in collaboration with the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and
the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) is preparing global maps showing
areas vulnerable to desertification.
Flashes...
Surinam became Unesco's 137th Mem¬
ber State on 16 July 1976.
Australia is to return to Papua-New
Guinea some Important art works from
that country now held in Australian col¬
lections, it was reported at a recent Unes¬
co seminar on Asian museums, in Tokyo
and Kyoto (Japan).
Unesco is now printing publications on
recycled paper as part of a raw materials
conservation campaign. The books and
documents carry a distinctive symbol.
This year's World Medical Assembly,
meeting in Sao Paulo (Brazil) from 24 to
30 October, Is making a special study of
environmental pollution.
The British Broadcasting Corporation
has begun a series of Sunday television
programmes aimed at helping two million
British people 6% of the adult popula¬
tion who are illiterate.
