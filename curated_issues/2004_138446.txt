verybody was on their feet swaying to thé music, happy to
be sharing an exceptional moment. To bring thé International
Year for thé Commémoration of thé Struggle against Slavery
and its Abolition to a dose, Gilberto Cil, musician and
Brazilian Minister of Culture, performed an exceptional concert at
UNESCO's Paris Headquarters. "Thé most fantastic contribution of
thé Black diaspora to thé world is thé cultural, racial and spiritual
blending it has spawned, " Gil commented in between an evocative
ballad about thé island of Corée, a song of revoit and hope by
Bob Mariey and John Lennon's "Imagine".
Thé concert hall was packed on that evening of December 3.
As with events over thé whole of 2004, it served as a poignant
reminder of thé abominations of slavery, thé célébration of
its abolition, and thé need to continue thé struggle against ail
contemporary forms of slavery. At thé same time, it also highlighted
thé extraordinary exchanges that thé slave trade engendered, and
how they hâve iiifluenced thé world in which we live today.
Thé concert was thé final event on thé evening's emotionally
chargea programme. Earlier, poet Aimé Césaire took part, live
via videolink from his home in Fort de France in Martinique. He
was awarded thé Toussaint Louverture Prize, specially created by
UNESCO for thé International Year. With finesse and précision, he
spoke of thé universal dimension of thé combat against injustice
and for human dignity. Quoting from his writings on thé freed slave
who went on to lead Haiti, he emphasized how seriously Toussaint
Louverture had taken thé Déclaration of thé Rights of Man and of
thé Citizen, which was adopted by thé National Assembly of France
in 1789.
Thé founder of thé Teatro Expérimental do Negro, Abdias
Nasacimento of Brazil, was there in persan. He also received thé
Toussaint Louverture Prize for his efforts aver almost 70 years to
rehabilitate Afro-Brazilian héritage, and his commitment to thé
struggle against domination, racism and intolérance. He called for
vigilance and launched a vibrant plea in favour of Haiti and Africa,
denouncing ail mechanisms that today maintain injustice and
oppression.
Earlier in thé day, in la salle des pas perdus, a travelling
exhibition was inaugurated. « Lest we forget : thé triumph aver
slavery", was conceived by thé Schomberg Centre in New York
in collaboration with UNESCO's Slave Route project. Thé facts
and figures, thé methods used and thé terrible logic of thé slave
trade presented in this exhibition serve as a sober reminder of thé
suffering endured by so many men and women.
Thé dossier published in this issue of thé new UNESCO Courier
focuses on thé « blending » that resulted from thé population
movements that resulted from thé slave trade. It takes us on a
strange cultural odyssey, shedding a completely différent light on
some of thé most dreadful pages of human history

ICH'LEJE
Science is becoming more and
more universal. In order to
respond to thé questions raised
by modem science, ethics
must go global, with common
points of référence established.
Thé International Bioethics
Committee (IBC) has been
working at this task for several
months, creating thé basis of
a déclaration on thé universal
norms of bioethics. Thé IBC
will soon hand thé bâton to
govemment experts, who are
expected to meet and generate
thé final document that will
be submitted to UNESCO's
Général Conférence in 2005.
IBC Président Michèle Jean of
Canada answers our questions.
What wiM this future déclaration inctude?
Takiiig into account our consultations with UNESCO niember
states, we've chosen to focus thé déclaration on human beings
as moral actors with responsibiiities vis-à-vis animais, thé
environment and thé biosphère. Thèse areas could be thé focus
of other work done either by thé World Commission on thé
Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST), thé
IBC or other bodies.
Who witl thé déclaration be targeting?
Thé déclaration aspires to create a framework that could inspire
states in thé implementation of their policies, législation,
rules of good coaduct and codes of ethics. It's an instrument
that should help countries draft their own policies and their
own guidelines, while taking into account their cultures and
traditions, une of thé challenges is not to fall into thé trap of
cultural relativism.

UNESCO | thé nciu Courier | December 2004

Thé IBC's text is based on a séries of fundamentat prînciples,
with human dignity at thé forefront. Can this principle realty
be defined?
This notion is very complex and l don't thiak that we'll end up
with a précise définition. Human dignity can take diverse forms
in différent cultures. Others before us hâve tried to do it and we
always end up with solutions that don't allow for thé principle
to maintain its universality.
So, what's thé point then?
Human dignity is a notion that crops up in several international
texts, notably in thé Universal Déclaration of Human Rights,
and in thé works of philosophers Uke Kant. This principle bas
fhe advantage of putting forward a vision oî thé human being.
If we don't take human dignity into considération, what is
thé use of talking about principles like autonomy or informed
consent? l think that this notion constitutes a vision or an
objective to which we should strive, an objective which allows
us to establish a certain aumber of other principles that we can
define more cleariy.
Does such a plurafetic approach risk weakening thé
instrument?
We must not fall into any kind of cultural relativism, where
everything is mixed up and we can do aaything in thé name
of cultural diversity. This is why we specify in thé déclaration
that one cannot undermine thé values of justice, human dignity
and human rights in thé name of cultural diversity. Nothing
that bas been implemented should run contrary to thé général
and fundamental principles that we define. But one can - in
one's way of working, in one's relationship with spirituality and
religion - corne up with différent ways of implementiag thèse
same principles.
One of thé goats of thé future déclaration is to prevent
thé stigmatization of and discrimination against individuals
or a group of individuate. Coukl you give some récent
examptes of cases In which seiwrtlfic progress came up
against such a risk?
New risks hâve appeared, notably with thé development of
genetic science. For example, if you study thé "susceptibility"
of a given. population to certain aînesses, there is a risk that
certain sectors of thé population could be stigmatized. Those
who are more susceptible than others to developing a certain
iïlness due to their genetic make-up are maybe going to see
themseives denied jobs or health insurance. How can we make
sure that, on one hand, epidemiological reaearch - which can
benefit from thé study of genetic data from certain populations
- moves forward, but on thé other hand, that this does aot lead
to thé stigmatization of individuals?
There is also a question about thé collective diinensioas of
consent. If you décide to submit to a DNA test, it can reveal
certain susceptibilities withia your family and thus hâve
repercussions within thé family. On thé other hand, everything
should not be "geneticized" as thé mdividual is made up of
genetic data, but also of phenotypes, thé éducation he or she
bas received aad his/her environment.
Thé draft highHghts that scientific progress should always
attempt to promote thé wetl-being of individuals and
of thé human species as a whole. Are there sftuations in
which thé interests of thé individual and thé interests
of thé community clash?
Thé gréât challenge in bioethics is, as a matter of fact, to try to
reach equilibrium between those mterests. For example: if you
hâve a médication that costs 20,000 dollars a year per person in
a public health System funded by thé state, you might be forced
to décide not to subsidize that médication because it is too
costly aad those costs could adversely affect thé entire System.
There are collective iatercsts that must be counterbalanced with
thé intercsts of an individual. Bioethics allows us to inform
such a choice.
On such an issue tike thé one you just mentioned, how
could thé déclaration hâve helped hiform thé décision?
When we're talking about acting for thé good of thé individual
or individuals, thé déclaration is not necessariïy going to

UNESCO created thé
International Bioethics
Committee (IBC) in 1983,
at a time when human
genome research and
genetic testing were
beginning to take shape.
With culture, éducation and
thé sciences as its mandate,
UNESCO wanted to use this
Committee -which did not
yet hâve a formai structure
- to contribute by drawing
up a déclaration on thé
human genome and human
rights. Thé Universal
Déclaration on thé Human
Genome and Human Rights
was drafted by thé IBC
and adopted by UNESCO's
Général Conférence in 1997,
and later approved by thé
United Nations Général
Assembly in 1998.
In 1998, thé IBC was given
a formai structure with
ststutes, rules and formai
working procédures. Thé
Committee was quickly
given a mandate to prépare
anothar déclaration,
this time devoted to
human genetic data. This
déclaration was adopted
in 2003 and, at thé same
time, thé Committee was
given thé mandate to work
on a draft déclaration
on universal norms in
bioethics. That text witl

help because thé level of social acceptability is not thé same
everywliere. But we hope to provide a framework that will
allow us, whea we're looking at thèse types of questions, to
make thé best possible décisions in thé given drcumstances
by applying thé fundamental aad secondary principles of thé
déclaration.
Thé text introduoes certain new or emerging principles
like thé principls of responsibUHy, of aceountabHity. What's
thé point of this prindple?
This principle is particulariy important iii thé current coiitext. Il
touches on thé whole question of thé integrity of scientists and
their responsibility, but also on thé responsibility of iadividuals.
We don't talk about it that often, but as individuals in a society
we also hâve a certain degree of responsibility with respect to
our health, thé way we behave, feed ourselves and live, with a
view to not undermining thé health System for our countrymen.
We often say, "My freedom stops where yours begins" that is
a question of balance.
AU of thèse principles remain rather général. Are you worried
that thé déclaration could become merely a statement of
good Intentions? What is its tnie usefulness?
Thé déclaration also recommends rather concrète measures,
like thé establishment of ethics committees, public debate, etc.
On ail of thèse issues, we hâve tu eiigage in public debates and
foster dialogue with scientists and civil society, to see how far
we want to go and how it would work. Ail this is very concrète
- we need ethics committees, we need ethics éducation
programs for scientists and health professionals, we need to
develop genetic couaseling programs... As for UNESCO, it must
develop procédures to implement thé déclaration, as well as
évaluation and monitoring procédures. AU thèse things will
breathe life into thé déclaration.

This déclaration is aimed at estabUshing ethical prindples
that will provide a framework for récent scientiHc progress.
te it truly possJble to croate norms that wttl keep up with thé
speed of scientific évolution?
Certainly, science is developing at breakneck speed, but that
is predsely why we need this déclaration. In addition, thé
déclaration is due to be reviewed later on to take scientific
progress into account so that certain areas that might not be
initially covered can be included in subséquent work. l don't
think we should give up on moving forward just because
science is moving too quickly. On thé contrary, we must
continue to develop useful frameworks. Once we hâve a
good framework, we can gradually - notably through reports
and opinions - follow thé évolution and make thé necessary
adjustments. We cannot forget that bioethics must bc based
on an adéquate sdentific background and must not make
pronouncements based on unfounded principles.

Much of our carbon gas émission is absorbed by thé océans. This is a boon for thé
atmosphère, already saturated with gases contributing to thé greenhouse effect.
But it is a growing danger for marine ecosystems, in which acidity is increasing.
UNESCO and thé sdentific community are sounding thé alarm.
Austraiia. /-f l , , , now, we considered it a blessing
Underwater robot l/1 I^L'l/ 11 for thé environment. Thé océans
nearthe Gréât covering two-thirds of thé planet's surface absorb
Barrier Resf much of our carbon gas émissions, particularly
carbon dioxide, which would otherwise contribute
to thé greenhouse effect. Thé problem is that
océans are being harmed in thé process. Thé
océan environment has significantly increased
in acidity since thé start of thé industrial era. In
May 2004, UNESCO and thé scientific community
sounded thé alarm at a symposium organised by
thé Intergovernmental Océanographie Commission
(IOC) and thé Scientific Committee for Oceanic
Research (SCOR).
In récent years, heat waves, unusual droughts,
a succession of cyclones and storms hâve
focused attention on thé climate and supposed
signs of global warming. Up until now, interest
in what is happening in thé océans was limited
to discovering their influence on climate
models and their response to a warming of thé
planet's atmosphère (raised water levels and
températures). But thé absorption of around a
third of thé carbon gas output of human activity
aver two centuries - some 118 billion tonnes
between 1800 and 1994 - has threatened thé
chemical balance of thé sea's upper levels.
Concern over climate change has now been
overtaken by worries of a potentially disastrous
dégradation of marine ecosystems.
PLANKTON IN DANGER
In soluble form, carbon gas is acidic. Thé
increased acidity of seawater, that is to say its
lowered pH* level, translates to a deficiency in
carbonates (l). But carbonates are used by coral

and some plankton species to form protective
outer shells made of calcium carbonate. "A
decreased availability of carbonates will lead ta
a lessened calcification of thé exoskeletons of
thèse species" of between 10 and 40 per cent, says
James Orr, a biogeochemist at France's Laboratory
for Climate and Environmental Science [LSCE)
and member of thé planning committee for thé
SCOR-IOC symposium. Based on measurements
taken at nearly 10, 000 sites between 1990 and
1998, Richard A. Feely, Christopher L. Sabine
and their colleagues hâve clearly highlighted thé
importance of thé level of carbonates in seawater
[l). Their research shows that, at thé current rate
of carbon gas émissions, thé décline in this level
is going to worsen.
Coral reefs are among thé first victims of this
change. They are no longer threatened only by
thé increase in thé ocean's température but also
by thé shift in its chemical balance. Various
uncontrollable chain réactions are being triggered.
One of thé most important is thé réduction in thé
size of some plankton species which serve as food
for fish and other marine organisms. Thé entire
food chain is being perturbed in unpredictable
ways that could imperil thé ocean's biodiversity
and production.

CARBON GAS IN THE OCEAN'S
DEPTHS?
Thé reasons to view thé océans as CO; "sinks"
hâve become well-established. Thé discovery was
ail thé more eye-opening because very few experts
had anticipated it. Thé océan in effect acts as an
enormous réservoir of carbon (holding around
37,000 gigatonnes, or 37,000 billion tonnes),
much more than in thé atmosphère (around
800 gigatonnes). Thé addition of human-produced
carbon gas (nearly two gigatonnes a year of
thé total six gigatonnes generated by industrial
activity(2)) would seem relatively harmless.
Some hâve even theorized, and still theorize,
that carbon gas could be captured at its source,
compressed into a liquid form, and injected into
thé ocean's depths. Based on oceanic circulation
models, carbon gas stored in this way would not
cycle to thé surface and into thé atmosphère for
several hundred years.
Cesare Marchetti was thé first to suggest this
solution in 1977, while he was working for thé
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IASA) in Austria. His idea for disposing of thé COz
produced in Europe was to send it to thé bottom
of thé Atlantic Océan, off thé Strait of Gibraltar.
Marchetti's proposai was picked up two years
later by American scientists, and in thé 1980s thé
US Department of Energy started researching thé
possibility. Thé underiying question was: Given
that thé carbon gas dissolved on thé surface is only
very slowly circulated into deep water, is there a
way to speed up thé process? Especially as deep
water, being colder, absorbs carbon gas at a much
faster rate than surface water.
CAUTION IS THE WATCHWORD
Thé European Commission currently faveurs
carbon gas storage underground or in saline land
aquifers and gives little support to researching
océan storage. This path is mostly being explored
by Norway, Japan and thé United States, though
as it stands US authorities seem unconvinced by
thé technique. Scientists in those three countries
are working together on thé Océan Abyssal
Carbon Experiment (OACE) project (2002-
2005). Ceertain results were presented at thé 7th
International Conférence on Greenhouse Cas
Control in Vancouver in September 2004(3). In thé
industrial sector, caution reigns, as expressed in
a report prepared by scientists from thé oil group
Total and thé Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP)
for thé 19th World Energy Congress in Sydney
* Thé pH of a

average between 8
and 8. 3. This level

in September 2004, which read: "Even with a
certain scientific guarantee as to thé system's
equilibrium, it would not be easy for thé public to
allow our océans - part of our universal héritage
and a source of life - to be used as storage sites.
Thé océans hâve long been unwisely considered
bottomless trash cans [... ]" (4).
This sort of storage also has to be evaluated
in thé light of international measures protecting
thé océan environment, such as thé London
Convention on waste disposai at sea, even
though, strictly speaking, COi cannât be
considered waste. But whether we like it or not,
part of thé carbon gas output resulting from
human activity has already gone into thé océan.
Therefore, if we short-circuit C02's présent route
(through thé atmosphère and surface océan)
by putting it directly at thé bottom of thé sea,
thé question is whether this créâtes additional
risks to thé deep océan environment, as Takashi
Oshumi, Japanese scientist and member of thé
SCOR-10C planning committee, wrote in 2002. (5)
One achievement of thé conférence was bringing
together thé various points of view and scientific
knowledge from différent disciplines (chemistry,
physics, biology, ecology, paleoceanography... ),
as another member of thé committee, French
biogeochemist Liliane Merlivat, pointed out.
LOOKING BEFORE LEAPING
A multidisciplinary confrontation is crucial
for evaluating each alternative on scientific,
environmental and économie grounds, as thé
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) bas recommended. That also holds for
proposais to fertilize thé océan environment
with injections of iron, an élément essential for
activating photosynthesis. Thé idea now is to
encourage thé growth of océan végétation in order
to sequester some of thé carbon dioxide generated
by humans. Despite inconclusive results so far,
some companies hâve already started to develop
techniques implementing this process, notes
Patricia Bernai, thé lOC's Executive Secretary. For
symposium participants, thé scientific évaluation
has to continue before any décision is made on thé
method's large-scale application.
Given thé volume of émissions predicted
for thé décades ahead, nothing should be left
to chance. Scientists predict that by 2100 thé
décline in surface seawater pH will accelerate
further, multiplying by as much as a factor
of three compared to thé level recorded since
thé beginning of thé industrial era. This is a
phenomeaoa unprecedented in thé last 20 million
years, says Maria Hood, a specialist researcher for
thé IOC. UNESCO's initiative aims to address thé
situation. "Our main message, " Patricia Bernai
stresses, "is to leave no path unexplored, but to
evaluate each one according to strict scientific
principles. This is thé key to making fully
informed political décisions about a problem that
goes far beyond mère national interests."

Thé World Commission on thé Ethics
ofScientific Knowledge and Technology''
(COMEST) brought scientists, légal
experts and space programme directors
together for a symposium on "thé légal
and ethical framework for astronauts"
at UNESCO's Paris headquarters on
October 29
To whom do l complain to if thé sky falls on
my head? What law applies and which court
is compétent?» Those are thé questions
Gabriel Lafferranderie** half-seriously asked
himself in 1997. Since then, thé development of
thé 16-nation International Space Station (ISS)
has not made matters any clearer. Let's say débris
does drop out of thé sky. Will it be necessary
to ask which part of thé station it cornes from?
Which of thé 16 countries built that section of thé
«erector set» spacecraft?
Like space itself, space law might seem quite
murky to mère Earthlings like us. There are texts,
such as thé 1967 Space Treaty, thé Agreement
on thé Rescue of Astronauts, thé Return of
Astronauts and thé Return of Objects Launched
into Outer Space and even thé 1998 Agreement on
thé International Space Station, which attempts
to untangle in advance thé légal intricacies that

UNESCO | thé neiu Courier | December 2004

might anse if a crime took place aboard thé
ISS. Ail thèse texts might seem largely sufficient
because they pertain to situations that, for thé
most part, hâve not occurred yet. What's more,
thé burden of determining what constitutes a
crime will fall primarily on a small group of
individuals living and working in close proximity
to each other, and will probably require ethical
judgement before légal judgement.
But chances are that thèse texts and thé
ethical reflection swirling around them will fall
short in thé near future. New directions in space
exploration are opening up horizons very différent
from those of thé period of thé moon launches
and thé Cold War. Commercial and national
interests are increasingly looming up behind



astronauts, described as "envoys of mankind" by
thé Outer Space Treaty. Thé two flights thé private
rocket-powered plane SpaceShipOne made in
September and October 2004 show that thé âge
of space tourism opened up by billionaire Dennis
Tito's May 2001 trip is hère to stay. Thé ticket
is still quite pricey - 160,000 euros - but Virgin
Galactic says aver 7,000 potential passengers
are already queuing up for its flights, which are
scheduled to begin in 2007 or 2008, and other
'carriers" will probably follow suit. That means
there will be many more astronauts in a few years
than during thé entire first half-century of space
exploration.
MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AND
FINANCIALUABILITY
But it also means new problems, from something
as banal as lost luggage to determining what
constitutes an acceptable risk to space tourists.
(Astronaut Jean-Pierre Haigneré says that in 1969
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had just one
chance in two of coming back from thé moon safe
and sound, and today thé risk is 3 %, which is
quite high for mère tourists!) Thé growth of space
tourism will also raise thé likelihood of seeing
crimes and misdemeanours committed in space,
but thé existing text applies only to thé ISS. "Thé
fîrst recognized space criminal, " North Carolina
University anthropologist Péter Redfield said at
thé October meeting, "could in fact prove to be
an unethical corporation that violâtes commercial
law in search of greater profit, or a particularly
rude and belligerent space tourist who goes one
step too far. "
A single example is enough to show thé limits
of présent law in dealing with today's situation.
Dennis Tito and his fellow trailblazers were
still "envoys of mankind" and they incurred thé
moral responsibility and fiaancial liability of thé
State responsible for launching thé vessel aboard
which they travelled. Imagine a passenger on thé
Virgin Galactic or another future carrier causing a
disaster during a space flight. Neither thé party at
fault nor thé company that sent thé craft into orbit
could afford to cope with such a possibility.
Tourist-astronauts will be joined by future
astronaut-colonists. At thé October 29 meeting,
Jacques Arnould, of thé CNES (Centre National
d'Etudes Spatiales, thé French space agency),
pointed out that for thé moment astronauts are
still campers "working and living in space", but
thé day is coming when they will be "settled
in space". Longer and longer space sojourns,
increasingly far from Earth, will raise new
technical problems as well as ethical and légal Sillionaire Dennis

issues. How will existing principles be applied to
thé situation? Should new régulations or ethical
considérations govern astronauts' activities? In
thé long run, one may wonder whether a spécial
status will hâve to be created for space settlers'
descendants whose ties with Earth are so loose
that they could only be described as a différent
species.
PONDERING ASTRONAUTS'
STATUSANDOTHERETHICAL
QUESTIONS
Without peering quite so far ahead into thé
future, it might be worth pondering whether thé
foundations of thé astronaut's status should be
revised. Until now, astronauts hâve been considered
pioneers pushing back new frontiers, focusing
mainly on scientific research and geostrategic
compétition. Is thé driving force behind space
exploration shifting, with économie motives
taking precedence aver research? It might also
be worth asking other kinds of ethical questions
involving space exploration: wouldn't thé resources
swallowed up by flights to Mars be put to better
use on Earth, to combat illiteracy for example?
Thé October 29, 2004 meeting, organised
by UNESCO, thé European Centre for Space
Law (ECSL), thé European Space Agency
and thé Institut du droit de l'espace et des
télécommunications at Université Paris XI-Sceaux,
tried to map out thèse uncharted territories.
"We're hère to move thé debate forward, or rather

Thé people of Timbuktu in Mali used a suitcase radio donated by

Thé suitcase radio bas enabled us to save

says Birama Diallo, of UNESCO's Community
Multimédia Centre pronject in Bamako, thé
capital of Mali. He explains that "it enabled us
to disseminate information about traditional
methods of fighting thé locusts that had been
forgotten because there had been no locust
attacks in so long. Thanks to thé suitcase radio
we hâve been able to reach everybody, including
nomads. " Thé last major invasion of locusts
occurred some 20 years ago, according to Diallo.
"Thé equipment was used to broadcast daily
crisis programmes, retransmitted on ail four radio
stations in Timbuktu, to tell people where to go
and to organize thé fight against thé invading
swarms, " explained radio technician Mahi Touré.
With few government resources available
for actions such as airborne surveillance and
spraying, Timbuktu had to rely on traditional
methods like smoking thé locusts out, beating
thé swarms with sticks and with traditional
boubou cloth. This requires thé participation of
many people. Thus thé mobile radio, which was
taken to thé anti-locust operational headquarters
run by thé authorities and even into thé fields
to broadcast live from thé local communities,
was essential in mobilizing thé necessary large
numbers.
Thé languages spoken in this cultural
crossroads include Tamacheq, Songhay, Peulh,
Arabie, French and Bambara, and radio provides
thé only effective means of ensuring urgent

proved vital in times of crisis.
"Old people explain thé traditional methods of

to mobilize thé villagers. Today, thé army and
thé youth of Timbuktu will be going out together
to fight thé swarms, " explained Mr Touré. Thé

and in producing "radio browsing" programmes
in which thé présenter browses pre-selected
web sites on air, explaining and discussing thé
contents with a local expert in thé national

In less critical times, thé stations also use thé
suitcase unit to cover local sporting events such
as football matches and officiai célébrations. Thé
unit has even been much in demand to give a
spécial touch to Touareg weddings at nomadic
camps in thé désert surrounding Timbuktu.
But with thé locust crisis, it had become clear
that thé suitcase radio has a vital rôle ta play in
reaching thé people scattered across thé area.
UNESCO bas decided to provide thé radio stations
with a 100 watt suitcase, which increases thé
broadcast radius from thé 15 to 20 kilomètres
possible with thé 30 watt transmitter to upto
60 km, covering thé entire populated area of
Timbuktu and thé 40 villages situated in thé Niger
Delta.
Although thé radio stations of Timbuktu are
small and under-funded, they hâve successfully
managed to share thé cost of maintaining thé

Endangered by civil war, deforestation and poaching, certain

onsidered thé "world's second green lung"
after thé Amazon, thé Démocratie Republic
of Congo (DRC) is home to a number of
animal species that are now under threat. For
that reason, UNESCO rallied ail of its Member
States and partners in September to join a major
international campaign to support thé DRC's rich
natural héritage. This western African country
has five sites inscribed on thé World Héritage List
and thé World Héritage in Danger List that are
thé habitat of emblematic species and sub-species
such as thé bonobo, thé okapi, thé mountain
gorilla and thé Northern White Rhinocéros.
No other African country can boast such a
variety of animal and plant species. One reason
is thé diversity of climates and ecosystems:

Another problem: thé white

rhinocéros was born in a zoo
in Dvur Kralove, in thé Czech
Republic, but that was thé first
birth for ten years. What can be
done? In July, a meeting was
held in Nairobi to deveiop an

mountains, volcanoes and lakes. Thé civil war
and instability in thé Gréât Lakes région are
endangering thé conservation of thèse species,
which are threatened by de-forestation, poaching,
thé movement of refugees or thé illégal extraction
of ore.
In an attempt to reduce this damage, UNESCO
and thé United Nations Foundation launched a
Project in 2000 called "Biodiversity Conservation
in Régions of Armed Conûict: Conserving World
Héritage Sites in thé DRC", aiming to préserve
thé sites in their entirety in a country embroiled
in war. This programme used 62 percent of
its budget of three million dollars to pay thé
salaries of thé park wardens, who sometimes risk
their lives to protect thé parks. This intensive
surveillance of thé sites has, for example, allowed
thé mountain gorilla population to rise from
325 individuals at thé start of thé programme
to 355 aow. Thé staff of thé parks hâve also
benefited from training programmes to help them
deal with thé crisis. Another important part of this
alliance, which thé DRC governmeat and several
conservation organisations active in thé DRC hâve
joined, has been thé launch of a "diplomacy of
conservation". Its main achievement has been
to develop links and contact with ail belligerent
parties.
Thé event in Paris, which took place from
September 14 to 26, included an international

donors conférence. Thé countries and institutions
taking part made commitments to donate 50
million dollars, which will prolong several
programmes. More specifically, 3. 5 million dollars
pledged by thé governments of Belgium and Italy
as well as thé United Nations Foundation and thé
Wildlife Conservation Society will fund thé second
phase of thé programme launched in 2000. Arthur
Z'Ahidi N'Goma, one of thé four Vice-Presidents
of thé DRC's government of national unity,
pledged to do everything possible to stop thé
dévastation of thé forest and to keep troops and
displaced people away from thé protected areas.
Other events were aimed at thé wider public:
UNESCO hosted an exhibition organised by thé
Royal Muséum for Central Africa in Tervuren,
Belgium, and a charity concert featuring rumba
music and other traditional Congolese rhythms.
Thé programme established in DRC by
UNESCO and thé UNF can serve in future as a
model for thé protection of héritage in times of
conflict. Meanwhile, thé survival of a number
of threatened species dépends on thé initiative's
success.

news: More children are going
to school than ever before. But
unfortunately, many drop out before grade 5 of
primary school or graduate without mastering
even a minimum set of cognitive skills, concludes
thé 2005 Education for Ail Global Monitoring
Report, launched November 8 in Brasilia (Brazil).
Thé Report, which monitors progress towards
thé six Education for Ail goals* set by aver 160
countries at thé World Education Forum in Dakar
(2000), finds that significant efforts are being
made to increase resources, broaden access to
school and improve gender parity. However,
exhaustive analysis of research data shows that

UNESCO l thé new Courier l December 2004

thé quality of éducation Systems is failing children
in many parts of thé world, and could prevent
many countries from achieving Education for AU
bythetargetdateof2015.
In one third of countries with data, for example,
less than 75 percent of students reach grade
5. National and international assessments also
show that performance levels and very weak in
low and middle-income countries and among
disadvantaged groups in some industrialized
nations.
"Overcrowded classes, poorly qualified teachers
and ill-equipped schools with scant learning
materials remain ail too familiar pictures in
many countries, " said UNESCO Director-General
Koïchiro Matsuura. "Yet, achieving éducation
for ail fundamentally relies on assuring décent
quality: what children learn and how they learn
can make or break their school expérience and
their subséquent opportunities for life."
DEVELOPMENT INDEX
Thé importance of quality is reflected in thé
report's EFA Development Index, which measures
thé overall progress of 127 countries towards
EFA. Thé Index is based on indicators for thé four
most measurable Dakar goals: universal primary
éducation, adult literacy, éducation quality as
proxied by survival rate of pupils to grade 5 and
^ender parity.
Norway, Denmark and thé Netherlands head a
list of 4l countries at thé top of thé Index, which
hâve achieved or nearly achieved thé four goals.
Almost ail are in North America and Western,
Central and Eastern Europe, except for a few
in Latin America and thé Caribbean, such as
Argentina, Cuba and Chile, and five small island
states.
They are followed by another 51 countries,
headed by Remania, Bulgaria and Costa Rica
and including many of thé Arab States and thé
countries of Latin America, which are well on thé
way to achieving some of thé goals, but are being
held back by slow progress on others, notably
quality.
Finally, a third group of 35 countries, 22 of
them in sub-Saharan Africa, but also including
thé high population countries of Bangladesh,
India and Pakistan, are "very far from achieving
thé goals", with "multiple challenges to tackle
simultaneously if EFA is to be assured."
Thé report provides a detailed analysis of thé
key factors influencing thé quality of éducation,
including financial and material resources for
schools, teacher numbers and their training, core
subjects, pedagogy, language, thé amount of
actual learning time, facilities and leadership.
There is a clear upward trend on many of
thèse fronts. Education spending, for example,
has increased aver thé past décade in many
developing countries, and access to éducation
continues to improve. But there are still 103.5
million out-of-school children, a figure that is
declining too slowly to achieve universal primary
éducation by 2015. Thé report also emphasizes
that improved access has not beea matched by an
expansion of educational facilities and resources.
INSUFFICIENTTRAINING
FORTEACHERS
This is most notable, for example, with teachers,
who, thé report emphasizes, "are thé stroagest
influence on learning. " In many low-income
countries, teachers do not meet even thé
minimum standards for thé profession. In Togo,
for example, only two percent of teachers met thé
minimum national standard of lower secondary
éducation. In Botswana, where thé standard was
an upper secondary éducation for teaching in
primary, only 10 percent of teachers made thé
grade. Similariy, a récent study of seven Southern
African countries, cited by thé Report, "found
that some primary school mathematics teachers

possessed only basic numeracy and actually
scored lower than students on thé same tests."
Too often, thèse poorly trained, teachers must
also face over-crowded classrooms. Thé report
finds that in countries with thé highest pupil/
teacher ratios, "barely one third of students who
start primary reach grade S. " In many countries
of sub-Saharan Africa and South and West Asia,
where éducation has expanded rapidly aver thé
past décade, pupil/teacher ratios hâve actually
risen. In most countries of thèse régions, thé
number of pupils per teacher exceeds 40 in
primary éducation and climbs above 60 in several
cases, including Malawi, Mozambique, Central
African Republic and Chad. Furthermore, in many
low-income countries, teachers' real wages hâve
declined relative ti average incomes and their
earnings are too low to provide an acceptable
standard of living.
HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC:
UNDERMINING EDUCATION
Thé HIV/AIDS pandemic is another factor
"severely undermining" thé quality of éducation,
states thé report. In Zambia, for example, an
estimated 815 primary school teachers died of
AIDS in 2001, "corresponding to 45 percent of
teachers trained that year. " Across sub-Saharan
Africa, "more than 11 million children under
thé âge of 15 hâve lost at least one parent to
HIV/AIDS". "Their opportunities to learn" points
out thé report, "are often curtailed by thé need
to care for sick family members or contribute to
household income."
Thé Report présents case studies from 11
countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Chile,
Cuba, Egypt, Finland, Republic of Korea, Sénégal,
South Africa and Sri Lanka) showing how both
rich and developing nations are tackling thé
quality issue. It also proposes a séries of policy
measures to improve thé quality of éducation,
emphasizing that although "there are no universal
recipes, a robust long-term vision for éducation,
strong government leadership and a motivated,
well-supported teaching corps are conditions for
successful qualitative reforms."
Thé international community has a crucial rôle
to play in supporting this process. Récent pledges
may double thé amount of aid to basic éducation
to about US$3-3.5 billion by 2006, but even this
figure falls short of thé estimated US$7 billion
per year required for achieving universal primary
éducation by 2015.

agaiast humaaity*, thé
slave trade constitutes one
i. of thé most tragic pages of
our history. Four centuries of terrer and humiliation.
Human beings captured, chained, deported, sold like
merchandise, exploited, tortured. Ten million? Twenty
million? Thé exact number is unknown, and could
hardly convey thé extent of thé catastrophe of thèse
dehumanized people: families separated, populations
decimated, a continent dispossessed of its greatest
wealth.
Thé year 2004, which marks thé bicentennial of
thé création of Haiti, thé first independeat black
state, has been proclaimed International Year for thé
Commémoration of thé Struggle against Slavery and
its Abolition by thé Général Assembly of thé United
Nations (p. 47). It is a time to accomplish our duty of
remembrance, but also to "to bring renewed attention
to this abiding and widespread influence of African
cultures and civllizations, " to quote thé Director-General
of UNESCO, Koïchiro Matsuura.
Despite thé horror that pervaded it, this commerce
in human beings carried with it cultural values and
ideas. It laid thé ethical and cultural foundations of
Caribbean and Indian Océan societies and profoundly
affected sodeties on thé American continent. It was thé
origin of a blendîng of cultures that coastitutes one of
thé modem's world's greatest riches. A peculiar cultural
odyssey.
Africaa influence is most obvions in music and
religion (p. 26 aad 30). But we hâve more than just jazz,
jongo and voodoo. We also hâve agriculture. Africa is
présent in thé daily life of Americans, down to thé food
on their plates, whether they rcalize it or not [p. 32).
Thé legacy of slaves is often little known, if not Uterally
obscured, particulariy in thé sciences. Few are aware,
for instance, that thé "father of thé smallpox vaccine"
Edward Jenner was not even born when Onesimus, a
slave, revealed to his master thé method used by African
healers to combat thé disease (p. 35). And not many
people suspect that thé "typically Palladian" houses in
Louisiana are just as typically African (p. 39).

UNESCO thé neiu Courier December 2004

Créole culture, formed around an African core,
is undoubtedly one of thé most positive outcomes
of thé slave trade - a barbarie act that led ta thé
création of new societies. By putting down thé
foundations of new societies that incorporated
their cultural, linguistic, spiritual and esthetic
characteristics - in short, their identity - slaves
brought about a genuine miracle (p. 42).
If this dossier in UNESCO's New Courier focuses
primarily on little-known aspects of African
influence in thé world, born of thé slave trade, it
also opens an even lesser-known chapter: how
cultural values, customs and social practices that
were exported with thé slaves then returned to
Africa (p. 44).
Ten years ago, UNESCO launched thé programme
"Slave Routes" with thé purpose of retracing
thé slave trade's path, analyzing particulariy
thé interpénétration of différent cultures of thé
continents concerned. A number of publications
hâve emerged on thé subject, and new projects
are multiplying, especially targeting young people.
Commemorative sites such as Stone Town of
Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania) or James
Island (Gambia) hâve been inscribed on thé World
Héritage List, while thé Carnival of Barranquilla
(Colombia) and La Tumba Francesa (Cuba), as
well as a number of other cultural expressions and
practices, hâve been proclaimed masterpieces of oral
and intangible héritage of humanity (p. 48).
In presenting a dossier devoted to thé diverse
legacies that African slaves and their descendants
left behind, UNESCO's New Courier is attempting
to discover thé positive effects of thé slave trade.
Examining thé past is a way of calling thé présent
into question.

slavery.
Thé African héritage is also a primary basis of
Brazilian samba, Cuban rumba and Trinidadian
calypso, which ail became internationally popular
Combining thé skills of African story telling, singing
and instrument making, calypso usually involves
some social commentary, typically in thé form of
satire, with an infectious béat. It bas since been
influenced by European, North American and other
Caribbean cultures to produce reggae and thé most
controversial of ail forms of black music today, rap.
Cubaa music too has its roots in thé ritual music
of African slaves mixed with Catholic liturgies and
thé brass bands and guitars of Spanish colonialists.
It developed in a rural setting in which African
slaves and small farmers from Andalusia worked
and played music together. With thé end of thé Cold
War and thé popularity of "Thé Buena Vista Social
Club", film by German director Wim Wenders,
Cuban music is enjoying a résurgence around thé
world.
Another slavery-related art form enjoying global
popularity is Capoeira, leaping and wheeling in
stylized combat lo thé rhythm of drums. Rooted in
Bantu tradition of Angola, Capoeira was iised by
Africans enslaved in Brazil to practice their fighting

authorities, who at ftrst thought it a harmless dance,
eventually learned its rcal purpose they banned it on
penalty of death. But it continued to be practiced by
fugitive slaves who set up independent settlements,
known as Quilombos (see page 31). Capoeira
remained illégal in Brazil until thé 1930s, when il
received national récognition as a martial art. In
récent years it exploded out of Brazil and continues
to grow in popularity. According to thé International
Capoeira Angola Foundation, it is aow practiced
in 74 countries, and there are over 1,000 Capoeira
schools listed on thé intemet.
Besides culture, enslaved Africaas also carried
spiritual traditions with them to thé New Worid,
where they were modified to meet thé conditions
of slaver^ and arc aow being re-exponed back

Thé former coffee fazenda, converted now to
subsistence farming and small-scale stock breeding,

According to his descendants, Pedro belonged
to thé Cabinda nation. Back then, thé slaves in
thé région were mostly of Bantu origin, sent to
Brazil from thé slave trade ports on thé coasts of
Angola and thé Congo, or via Mozambique. Thé
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-
grandchildren of Pedro and Militana now form
thé Sâo José da Serra community, a group that
perpétuâtes thé intangible héritage of its aacestors.
Nearly 80 people live in some 15 clay and straw
houses, with roofs made from plant materials and
mud floors. There is also a small chapel in thé
fazenda, and since 1970 a public school. Because
researchers, journatists and jongo fans from thé
big cities hâve "discovered" Sâo José da Serra, it
recently got electricity.
"Thé captive black man/ Worked so hard/ He
won his freedom/ Today May 13. " Thé inhabitants
of Sâo José da Serra dance to thèse words during
thé commémoration, which lasts several days, of
thé 1888 abolition of slavery in Brazil, on May 13.
Thé high point is thé caxambu, dance around a big

is formed and one couple dances in thé middle
while thé rest sing jongos, songs which are often
improvised, to thé rhythm of timbus, drums made
from hollow tree-trunks sealed with animal hide.
According to thé elders, magie is an ingrédient

Such perspectives were challenged in Melville
Herskovits' 1941 Thé Myth o f thé Negro Post,
which demonstrated "that African survivais can be
discovered in almost ail phases of Negro life in thé
United States. " Yet in 1963 sociologist E. Franklin
Frazier maintained that, ". . . because of thé manner
in which thé Negroes were captured in Africa and
enslaved, they were practically stripped of their
social héritage."
Twenty years later, in an article about engineer
Lewis Latimer, in thé book Blacks in Science Andent
and Modem, thé African American scholar John
Henrik Clarke maintained that "Thé collective
contributions of African Americans to science and
inventions is so extensive that it is not possible to
live a full day in any part of
thé United States, or thé world in général, without
sharing thé benefits of
their contributions."
Why is there such ignorance and déniai of this
African présence in U. S. culture? Because in spite
of ail of thé accurate information that bas been
available for décades, schools and thé média
portray Africa as a continent characterized by
sévère problems rather than tremendous wealth
and resources, that has folklore rather than culture,
and that certainly could not hâve contributed to thé
civilization of thé United States.
This déniai of Africa as part of thé foundation of
U.S. society is especially true concerning intellectual
and technological matters.. Thé "Carolina"
served with thé okra gumbo, which niight be more
apprupriately tenned Seiiegambian rice, is an
excelleiit example.
Thé rice grown in South Carolina and other parts
ot thé Americas is Oryzaglaberrinia, différent froin
thé Asijn Ory'zii sativa. This West African rice
and thé complex System of knowledge involved
in growing it and making it edible were broiight
by Africans, but they hâve not been given crédit.

Cotton Mather, thé Puritan pastor in Boston,
found it hard to believe, but he finally published
thé "discovery" in a text - Some Account of What
Is Said of Inocuîating or Transplanting thé Small
Pox - and found himself thé laughing stock of
thé era's médical profession, with thé exception
of Zabdiel Boylston. He tested thé vaccine on
his own son and two of his slaves. It was a
success. He continued thé experiment on 241
people. Only six were infected. Late, Thomas
Jefferson had complète success with 200 slaves,
80 of them his own. After that, thé vaccine was
accepted by thé white population and saved a
good number of American soldiers from illness
during thé war of independence.
Edward Jenner, internationally recognized as
thé father of thé smallpox vaccine, wasn't bom
when Onesimus taught his master thé method
used by African healers to fight thé illness. Thé
young African had been deported to America in
1706. His name remains inscribed in thé history
of medicine, but in a footnote.
Other slaves kaew similar fates. A certain
César, for instance, devised an antidote for
rattlesnake bites, mixing several ingrédients
induding wood ash and tobacco. It is very
probable that thé remedy was based on
traditioaal African kaow-how. A description was
published in 1792, in Massachussets Magazine.
Thé remedy did not earn ils inventor worid

People in thé United

often say they want "thé

probably hâve no idea
that they are referring
to a gadget invented by
an African American,
Elijah McCoy. In 1872, he
received a patent for thé
drip cup, a tubricating
device for steam engines
that fed oil to moving
machinery, avoiding thé
waste and cost of having
to stop engines in order
to lubricate them. People
were so confident in thé
reliability of McCoy's
invention, which had a
séminal impact on thé
evolving railroad industry,
that to be sure they were
getting his device rather
than someone else's
imitation of it, they asked
for "thé real McCoy."
McCoy, who arrived in

thé Civil War, was thé
son of African-Americans
who had escaped from

Benjamin Banneker, son of a slave father
and free mother born in Maryland in 1731, was
granted more récognition. A brilliant astronomer
and mathematician, he published an Almanac
in 1791 containing such an impressive wealth of
information that Thomas Jefferson was prompted
to Write him a letter. In his letter, Thomas Jefferson
speaks of thé almanac as proof "that nature bas
given to our black brethren, talents equal to those
of thé other colors of men" and informs thé author
that he is sending it to Monsieur de Condorcet,
Secretary of thé Academy of Sciences in Paris. It
was a revolutionary gesture for thé time.
Thé Fédéral Gazette and thé Baltimore Daily
Advertiser also paid tribute to Banneker's genius,
publishing articles about thé "direct descendant of
an African" a few days after his death on October
25, 1806.
Other scientists such as thé engineer Lewis
Howard Latimer (1848-1928), who became one
of thé "Edison Pioneers", or Norbert Rillieux
(1806-1894) from New Orléans, whose process
for refining sugar cane juice into sugar is used
to this day, also received récognition. But for thé
most part thé scientific contributions of slaves and
their immédiate descendants remained cloaked
in silence. Too often, as in thé case of Onesimus,
it was thé masters who published or patented
thé slaves' inventions, with thé latter considering
themselves lucky to hâve their names even
mentioned.
Only recently has research exhumed thèse
personalities, who should be familiar to us,
Sarah Breedtowe was not
predestined ta become a
millionaire. Born in 1867 on
a Louisiana Delta plantation,
a child of former slaves,
she went to school only
intermittently. Married at âge

30, she was working as a

of our duty to remember, but also a contribution
to intercultural dialogue founded on inclusive

1850, thé American Congress passed
a bill known as thé Fugitive Slave Act.
It stipulated that any white persan
could arrest and detain anyone of African descent
suspected of being a runaway slave. Even those
who had been bom free, unless they had irréfutable
proof, were at risk of being captured and dragged
into bondage. As a result, thousands of African
Americans picked up and fled thé northern states.
For many, this destination was Canada. It was a
phénoménal movement of refugees on what was
known as thé Underground Railroad: 20,000 people
are estimated to hâve settled in Canada between
1820 and 1860.
At thé time of thé fugitive slave law, Mary Ami

Shadd, a young freeborn woman, was a teacher in
thé northeastern United States. Mary Ann was born
in Delaware in 1823 into a prominent abolitionist
family. When her services were requested by
Henry and Mary Bibb, founders of thé first Black
newspaper in Canada, Voice of thé Fiigitive, she
moved to Windsor (Ontario) and started a school
in 1851 for thé children of fugitive slaves. She also
quickly became a leading emigrationist, hiding
numerous fugitives in her home.
In 1852, she published A Plea for Emigration;
or Notes of Canada West which touted thé country
as a major refuge not only for escaping slaves but
also free African Americans experiencing increasing
restrictions on their lives in northern states. Her
skills as an orator convinced many, but her public
outspokenness got her into trouble. A dispute with
thé Bibbs aver thé question of separate schools for
Blacks spilled onto thé pages of their newspaper, thé
Voice of thé Fugitive, and led to her firing from her
teaching position.
Shadd than decided to start her own weekly,
where she could control how her ideas were
disseminated. One of Canada's first women
journalists thus became thé first Black woman in
North America to found a newspaper. Thé Provincial
Freeman began publishing out of Toronto on March
24, 1853. Because she was aware that her name
on thé masthead could alienate a leadership that
preferred thé strict gender codes of thé 19th century,
she had asked Samuel Ringgold Ward, Black
abolitionist and agent of thé Anti-Slavery Society of
Canada, to become editor. Shadd then spent a year
on thé lecture circuit drumming up subscriptions
and interest in her paper, which became a daily thé
following year.
First and foremost, thé Provincial Freeman was
an anti-slavery paper. It focused on thé importance
of Black self-reliance and intégration into Canadian
society and denounced thé practice of "begging,"
or fundraising on behalf of thé "downtrodden
fugitives" by presenting them in an unfavorable
light. It also championed women's rights, providing
a forum for activists Lucy Stone Blackwell and
Lucretia Mott.
Yet in spite of its success, thé paper could not
stay afloat, dépendent for its readership upon
a small educated élite. In 1860, it succumbed.
Seven years of publishing a newspaper under
such circumstances was nonetheless quite an

researchers.
After thé death of her husband Thomas F. Cary,
a Toronto businessman she married in 1856, Shadd
Cary left Canada with her two children. Hired by
Martin Delany as perhaps thé only woman to recruit
Black soldiers during thé Civil War, she later went
on to study and practice law in Washington D. C.,
being one of thé first women of her race to do so.
She also became increasingly vocal and active on
thé issue of women's rights and suffrage during her
later years.
Shadd Cary died on June S, 1893. A woman who
pushed thé boundaries and limitations normally
ascribed ta her race and sex, she was designated a
persan of national historié significance in Canada,
one of a number of posthumous honors she
received.

and sisters, live ail over Canada and thé United

Ce^ry
years ago, l visited
some of thé plantation
homes along thé
Mississippi River, outside New Orléans. It was not
my first visit to thé area, but l had never before
wanted to visit them. This time, however, l vetttured
out to see thèse beautiful places that once witnessed
so much humaa suffering. l was silenced when l
saw one-room slave cabins built on raised wooden
posts, weathered by time, but still standing.
Thé first site l visited was Laura Plantation. La
maison principfde or manor house was built in 1805,
on land granted to thé French owner by Président
Thomas Jefferson.
Thé main house was built by thé descendants of
thé first slaves brought to Louisiana from Sénégal
in thé eariy 1720s. Builders from thé Bambara
and Wollof tribes were highly valued for their
construction skills. Every spring, thé Mississippi
River would flood, just as rivers in Africa flooded,
and thé slaves used thé same architectural solution
as they did for houses in Africa. As Joseph Dunn,
spokesman for Laura Plantation, explains, "Thé
main house of Laura Plantation rests on 72 pyramids
that are identical to those found in West Africa. in
thé Sénégal and Gambia région, according to thé
architects that we coasulted."
Because thé house was built on alluvial laad,
thé builders dug a 750 m2 hole, 2. 5 m deep. At thé
bottom of thé hole, they put down a sort of raft of
cypress and willow logs, on top of which they built
72 brick pyramids to support thé foundation aad
make thé ground level stable. Once thé hole was
filled with earth, brick columns were erected on
some of thé pyramids. Thé columns support thé
horizontal beams that hold up thé building, forming
an above-ground basement.
Today, when visitors stand on thé floor of
thé above-ground basement and look up at thé
horizontal beams supporting thé first floor, they
can see thé Roman numerals numbering one to 30
on thé beams. Thé slave builders eut thé beams

from 1000-year-old cypress trees harvested from thé
nearby swamp. It took them approximalely one year
to sélect and eut down thé trees.
Because thèse houses were constructed on 30
horizontal beams and 30 vertical posts. tliey were
called "maisons de trente". Predating thé Civil
War, they share a striking number of arcliitectural
features with West African houses: gatleries,
porches, pillars one tu four feet liigh, (lie use of
plastered clay for walls, thé decoratioii of façades
with patterns in bas relief OT in paint, relativeiy
small interior rooms, and detached kitcliens built
away from thé main house. Thèse characteristics are
found in plantations along thé Mississippi, in thé
Garden District residential quarter of New Orléans,
and in Charleston, South Carolina.
"Thé method used by thé Senegalese builders was
similar to what we now call prefabricated. They
prepared everything in advance and thé house had
to be finished in 11 days, " says Duna, adding, "Thé
Créole architectural style that is typical of oui région
is a blend of Palladian and African ingrédients.
That's why it's very close to thé style found in West
Africa, and even in thé Indian Océan."
African understanding of doiiieslic space, which
was ideally suited for thé subtropical climate in thé
south of thé United States, as well as construction
techniques an-ived in Louisiana by way of thé
slave trade route, stopping off iii Brazil and in thé
CdribbCtin and making modifications to suit each
locale along thé way.
In 1733, a factory building constructed in thé
Gambia by local Mandingo designer-builders far tlie
English Royal African Compaiiy was described by ils
British factor:
"Their next work was to mdke a porch, callcd
an Alpainter by thé natives, who preteiid a right
to hâve oiie at every factory, that they inay liave

In 2002, thé New Orléans
Muséum of Art presented
an exhibition, "Raised to
thé Trade" showcasing
thé artistry of thé building
trades and thé talent of thé
builders who helped make
New Orléans an architectural
gem. Thé muséum also
recorded, aver four years,
thé oral historiés of builders
who are living today, but
growing older. Because
young people today hâve not
been interested in learning
thé building trades, thé skills
of thèse master craftsmen
coutd be lost. Thé exhibition
curators hope that "Raised to
thé Trade" will inspire young
people to learn thèse unique
building skills, ensuring
that thé architecture of New
Orléans witl be preserved by
qualified restorers.

This passage also attests to thé expérience of thé
Mandingo designer-builders and of thé economy and
skill with which they worked. It forever répudiâtes
thé idea that Africans came to thé Americas as
unskilled, uncivilized people. Dunn adds, "It has
been our expérience that many of our visitors
think only of African slaves within thé context of
fieldwork. Hardly ever are they afforded crédit
for designing, constructing and maintaining such
buildings as Laura Plantation, and yes, most of thé
French Quarter in New Orléans."
Descendants of slaves handed down from
génération to génération thé building techniques
inherited from their ancestors. Résides thé brick
pyramids, thé main house at Laura plantation also
incorporâtes what is known as "Senegalese plaster",
made of ground oyster shells, sand and water, aad
"evaporation planks" at thé point where horizontal
beams meet vertical pillars, intended to protect thé
wood from humidity.
and European technique bas been perpetuated until
now.
Thé names of slave architects aad builders are
lost to us, but thé architectural treasures they built
continue to enchant ail who visit them. In spite of
beauty in architecture, iron work, thé décorative arts
and furniture. That beauty is with us today.

de-socialized, de-cultured, almost dehumanized.
They were a sprinkling of individuals in exile,
torn from their familles and peer groups, eut off
from their myths, symbols and everything else
that anchored their reason for being. No lineage,
no name, no genealogy. Slaves were barred from
forming groups, and often could not understand
each other: Makuas, Yaos, "Inhambanes," Makondé,
Betsimisaraka, Sakalava, Merina, Betsileo and
other ethnie groups from Africa and Madagascar,
Indians, Malaysians and Indonesians, spoke différent
languages and belonged to différent traditions.
Hunters, stock breeders, farmers, from matrilineal,
patrilineal, polygamous, monogamous, gérontocratie
or monocratic societies, they had little in common.
Nonetheless, for thé saké of survival, they managed
to adapt to inhuman living conditions in a hostile
universe and to leave traces of their existence for
postenty.
Out of 63,447 slaves counted in 1826 on Bourbon
Island (now Réunion Island], 79.2% were farmers
(between 1680 and 1810, agriculture in thé islands
of thé Indian Océan was 90% dépendent on slave
labour); 16% servants; 2. 9 manual workers, 0.9%
sailors, 0. 6% day labourers and 0.4% fishermen.
In thé French colony, as in thé British colony of
Mauritius, thé slave "s thé équivalent of a tool,
"portage".
Nothing permitted thé immense majority of
thèse oppressed peuple to develop creativity or
spécifie professional skills. Yet "slaves with talent"
- what they called carpenters, cabinetmakers,
and stone masons at thé time - produced genuine
masterpieces, including roads, sugar factories,
churches, and East India Company buildings. Gol
Castle in Saint-Louis and thé Desbassays house
[Réunion), what is now thé history muséum in
Mahébourg and thé port of Saint-Louis (Mauritius)
are only a few examples of héritage they left
behind. And they made discoveries, such as thé
one by Edmond Albius (see box p. 21), which
revolutionized agriculture and inade thé island thé
top producer of vaailla in thé worid.
It has often been said that slaves did nothiiig
more than obey thé orders of thé boss or overseer.
Is that any reason to deny their contribution to thé
development of thé colonies and thé construction
of thé island societies in thé Indian Océan? Their
traces can be seen in areas as diverse as territorial
planning, social stnictures, economy and culture.
In a life story collected by Eve Prosper, historian
from Réunion, an elder more than 70 years old says:

UNESCO | thé new Courier | December2004

"Thé most wonder&il tesson oiir slave ancestors
left us is thé knowledge of how to work with
persévérance, even m a hostile climate, and to get
good results. " Research donc on thé héritage left by
former slaves, notably oral tradition, show that thèse
men's share was crucial to thé évolution of Indian
Océan societies. It must be pointed out that they
numbered 140,000 in 1830, which amounted to 70%
of thé total population of Mauritius, Bourbon Island
and thé Seychelles.
While it is true that slaves were more likely to
carry out than to conceive thé création of material
héritage, it is just as true that they left us an
authentic intangible héritage. They succeeded in
something that no one, neither masters nor colonial
authorities, had foreseen. In laying thé foundation
of a new society which today bas its own cultural
specificities, ils language, spirituality and esthetics,
they accomplished a true miracle: thé "Créole
miracle".
Thé miracle is visible everywhere and primarily
in thé Créole laaguage. It was made up by slaves
and masters spoke it too. Today it is part of thé
cultural héritage of ail Indian Océan islands. Despite
attempts in thé 1960s to eradicate it from Réunion, it
resisted and finally was given thé status of régional
language, which thé political authorities long denied
it. In Mauritius, Créole is spoken by everyone, and
is currently being introduced experimentally as thé
language for primary éducation. In thé Seychelles,
Créole became thé officiai language after thé
country's independeno.

Food, handicrafts, medicine, taies and legends
are ail components of thé rich legacy of thé slaves,
and ail part of thé Créole miracle. Particularly
music: sega and maloya, very popular with young
people, typical of thé islands in thé Indian Océan,
perpetuate thé memory of thé ancestors on public
and private radio (see box p. 7)
Of course, not ail Indian Océan island inhabitants
lay daim to thé history of slavery as their own.
As a conséquence of racism, undoubtedly, certain
descendants of slaves from Africa or Madagascar
do not recognize themselves as such, or try to
conceal thé fact, forgetting that "A people that
bas no memory has no future, " in thé words of
Aimé Césaire, poet from Martinique. Yet in récent
décades, a genuine cultural révolution is taking
place in thé région, and more and more thé
people are embracing their history. February 2 and
December 20 are holidays in Mauritius and Réunion,
commemoratiag their abolition of slavery in 1835
and 1848 respectively.
Finally, let us say that thé miracle has taken place
mainly at thé level of Créole identity, making thé
concept of "residential identity" thé keystone of
Créole societies in thé Indian Océan. While Africa
and Madagascar remain thé cultural références for
much of thé population, thé country we live in is
our real homeland.

phenomena of physical or spiritual
return to thé ancestral homelaad
began even before thé end of
slavery. Often thé same ship that transported
human cargo to thé New World returaed to thé
African coast with other people aboard, who
carried with them new knowledge, ideas and
practices. Thé latter aonetheless seemed familiar to
local populations.
For nearly four hundred years, thé Atlantic
shipping route in both directions allowed for
exchanges that gave birth on both sides of thé
océan to hybrid cross-breed cultures, which remain
fundamentally African. There is no better illustration
of thé movement of Africans and their descendants

They acquired valuable knowledge of navigation
and a number of them went into trade, accumulating
enough capital to buy their freedom.
Such exchanges were undoubtedly thé most
fruitful between Bahia, in BrazU, and thé Benm Gulf.
According to certain estimâtes, nearly two million
people crossed thé océan aboard slave ships in 250
years. During this period, Braziliaas of ail origins
and conditions - white slavers, mulattos, free men
and slaves - settled in places ranging from thé cape
of Sao Paulo to thé mouth of thé Niger River. Port
cities such as Agoue, Aneho, Ouidah, Cotonou,
Porto-Novo, Badagri and Laos were marked by thé

return of freed slaves of Brazilian origin, called
Aguda or Amaro.
Thé expérience acquired during their years of
captivity and thé kaowledge of European languages
and customs were extremely useful to those who
decided to try their luck on thé African coast as
traders, craftsmen, farmers or hired help. Many
started shops; others made their fortune in thé slave
trade. Masons, foremen, carpenters, cabinetmakers,
goldsmiths and barber-surgeons brought new know-
how to thé région. A aovel architectural style was
created, using previously unknown methods and
unusual materials. Converted to Catholicism, thèse
retomados brought with them religious practices
that continue today, such as thé extravagant feast-
days in honor of thé Lord of Bonflm, identical to
those in Bahia.
Following thé abolitions of slavery, freed
slaves from Brazil, Cuba, thé West Indies and
thé United States settle on thé Slave Coast and
inland, reinforcing and diversifying thé American
influences. Ghana, Libéria and Sierra Leone thus
became important réception centres for retomados
and people freed by British forces fighting thé illicit
slave trade. Maay of them contributed to developing
thé cultivation of oil-yielding plants, which became
thé region's principal économie activity to replace
thé slave trade.
Starting in thé 19th century, Afro-American
churches in thé United States began to send aid and
missionaries to thé African coast and sometimes
even inside thé African continent. Black missionaries
converted and brought Western-style schooling to
some of thé population, at thé same time promoting
American university éducation for Africans and thé
founding of vocational schools in several African
régions. Mostly they intensifted thé exchange of
ideas between Africans and Americans.

of représentatives from thé US and thé Caribbean,

participation, in thé birth of a supranational and

intercontinental identity, as well as an alliance
against racial and colonialist dominance. Following
World War II, many national libération movements
picked up thé ideas that came eut of thé conférences
to justify their struggle. In thé long term, pan-
Africanism provided a solid ideological base for thé
leaders pushing for modem policies in Africa, some
of whom became thé principal actors in thé new
international relations that emerged as countries
became independent. Pan-Africanism also served as
thé basis for founding thé Organization of African
Unity (OAU), now thé African Union (AU).
During thé 20th century, économie exchanges
between thé two continents deteriorated, but
cultural exchanges, particularly in music and thé
performing arts, did not diminish. North-American
music noticeably affected thé birth of urban identity
in South Africa. On thé western coast, thé musical
dialogue is even aider. Retornados from Cuba
and thé West Indies. as well as British soldiers
recruited in thé Caribbean, introduced syncretic
musical styles in thé region's urban areas. Those
returning from Brazil put an indelible mark on
urban music in Nigeria and Bénin. Thé introduction
of record-players and records facilitated extensive
dissémination of music from thé other side of thé
Atlantic. Recordings by thé famous groups Septeto
Habanero and Trio Matamores béat ail thé audience

Instruments of mixed origin like thé maracas,
congas and bongos, which arrived in Africa in thé
1950s, led to thé development of an impressive
style of rumba, characteristic of today's Démocratie
Republic of Congo. Thé rumba, calypso, Bahia's

genres of African origin, came/returned to Africa
and are now enjoying undeniable success ail aver

nspired by thé DVD of thé same
name, Silk, Scents and Spice tells thé
fascinating story of thé silk, scent and
spice trade routes. At once a fasdnating
history and travelogue, this book is filled
with astonishing colour photographs,
illustrating thé author's journeys along
routes once traced by gréât trade caravans
and vessels. Besides exotic merchandise
thèse routes also carried new ideas,
technologies and religions across vast
distances, shaping thé history of hunianity.
Thé oldest route was thé Incense Trail,
which linked thé frankincense-produdng
régions of Arabia with thé empires of
antiquity. Thé Silk Road was thé longest
of thé routes, stretching across mountains,
désert and thé steppes of Central Asia,
joining thé markets of China with those
of Europe and thé Middle East. Thé Spice
Route connected thé gréât civilizations
of Europe, India and thé Orient for aver
2,000 years. Arab dhows, Chinese junks
and Spanish galleons would sail this route
laden with precious spices from South-East
Asia and thé treasures of thé Orient. Their
trade of thèse routes bred international
rivalries and conquests, and thé search for
thèse riches impelled Columbus to cross thé
Atlantic and Magellan to circumnavigate
thé globe.
