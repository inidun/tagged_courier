LET us take a moment - but no longer -
to pity frightened men. Then let us plan
and work to dispel their fear and bring
them into our purposeful society of the
makers of things and the architects of hu-
man peace and progress. This is what we
must do, to save them and to save ourselves
from the consequences of their fear and
folly. \vie must learn to recognize and
know them.
Tiley can be recognized to-day by their words.
To-day, as before, they attack the very heart of
education and of science, by saying that every-
thing is already known. Among the things they
"know"so well are these :
Hunger and despair are and must he the com-
mon lot of most of the each's people (just as
their forebears said, before the days of deep
freezers, curing or meat and hybrid corn). War
is an incurable trait of human nature (just as
it was once human nature for some to he slaves
and others to be masters). Science is cvil (as
labour-saying machinery was once considered
evil). Universal education is wrong because
educated men will no longer"know their place"
(as the Renaissance proved).
Yet in defiance of all the tiling that once
were "known", the experiments have been made.
with lire, water, wood. iron and the "indestruc-
tible" atom itself - and we have the trains, ships,
printing presses and medicinal isotopes to
prove it. The challenges have been made and the
victories have been counted in every field of hu-
man endeavour-because courage itseif is a
common element in human nature.
ON this page is illustrated one of the most
dramatic demonstrations of human determi-
nation-for thcre is one place which is the
most natural home for fear. That place is the
world of perpetual darkness and sotitude. inha-
bilated by the blind. If this is not terrifying.
and if this does not justify fatalism and sur-
render - what is there for man to fear ?
Once, unbroken loneliness. ignorance and de-
pendence were the common lot of those who
could not see. Now, the bravest among them
have defealed darkness. Working in full part-
nership with their sighted colleagues, in UNESCO
meeting rooms, and in thousands of places
throughout the world, they are helping all handi-
capped men. women and childre 10 take the
place so long reserved for them in our society.
UNESCO knows many of the courageous men
and women, in the broad fields of education.
science and culture, and has helped bring
them together in thousands of meeting, to plan
and carry forward co-operative work - of the kind
exemplified on this page.
To study progress reports on such work, and
to make plans for the future, UNESCO will open
its Fifth
on the 22nd of May. Before then, UNESCO will
have sponsored meetings on such projects as
these :
To speed the reconstruction of schools : to en-
courage the international dissemination of music : :
to provide for the increased interchange among
nations of workers, teachers and students : to
help solve the educational problems of physically
handicapped children : 10 open a fundamental
education centre in Mexico to serve the whole
of Latin America : to increase the international
availability of educational, scientific and cultural
materials : to help doctors, chemists and engineers
to learn quickly of the work of their colleagues
in other countries... and to accomplish other
work that there is no space to list.
These are among the indispensable elements
for the practical attainment of a better world.

F) ND ! T S
MORE FUN
TO BE GOOD
Every year, millions of dollars are spent on the treatment of juveniledelinquents-the young people who break t  laws of their country,
city or community, again and again. Many people are aware of such
causes of delinquency as poverty, broken homes, unstable parents, war
conditions and other social evils. Yet, few know exactly what can be
done to present the crimes committed daily by boys and girls under twenty-
one. The article below tells the story of one unusual experiment which
is going on in Great Britain to help wayward youth.
If you were walking along a quietstreet in the West End of London,
you might be startled to hear the
husky shouts of youth at play, the
splinter of glass and the thud of a
football. You might be even more sur-
prised to learn that the sounds of
rough and tumble were coming from
a one-time convent, a building with
austere stone walls and a conservative
design. But, if you took one more step
and went inside the door, you would
understand at once why those youthful
sounds were coming from the building.
It is the Institute for the Scientific
Treatment of Juvenile Delinquency.
The methods which this Institute uses
to treat wayward youth make it out-
standing in the British Isles, and per-
haps unique in the world.
Hundreds of children are selected
from the court rooms of London each
year to attend the Institute. There is
nothing frightening about their wel-
come, when they come to spend one or
two afternoons a week there. Though
they are not aware of it when they
enter, a team of experts begins work-
ing in their behalf. Health reports,
intelligence, school and home reports
are thoroughly prepared.
When these check-ups are completed,
the children come to play-in the two
basement playrooms of the Institute,
under the watchful eye of a man and
woman. These are highly trained
play teachers, who recreate, in a sense,
the symbols of a father and mother in
the family circle. They give the
children complete care and coopera-
tion, but they never tell them directly
what to do.
What goes on in these playrooms
may seem strange at first. But, when
one stops to consider that about
seventy per cent of these difficult and
unhappy children are treated success-
fully at the Institute, it seems worth-

while to examine the methods care-
fully.
From* Destruction
to Creation
first, the children, especially thosewho are aggressive, forceful, and
somewhat backward in school, are
put in what is known to the staff as
the"`Dirty Room,"Here, every child
begins by being allowed to do exactly
as he likes-except that he may not
hurt anyone else. He is encouraged to
make a mess, to produce those fami-
liar noises which often echo in the
streets. Pots of paint are placed on
the floor, just waiting to be daubed on
the walls and flung at the ceiling.
Earth, sand and water lie ready to be
made into pies and plastered anywhere.
Newspapers are there to be lighted and
allowed to name.
The children, unlike normal boys
and girls, become very aggressive in
isolation, and usually run wild in this
Dirty Room. All the pent-up violence
and tension is flung out at the walls
and ceiling. When they have worked
off the hidden anger which has dis-
turbed their behaviour and made them
unhappy, they become less tense, grow
more creative than destructive, and
feel more confident with their teach-
ers.
Then, as most patients finally do,
they move from the Dirty Room to the
Clean and Quiet Room. Here, there
are constructive games, paints and
clay, tables and chairs, cards, and
even boxing gloves for organized
fights.
« Drawing out >&gt;
Nightmares and fears
The pictures painted by the childrenare very important. When the
youngsters are encouraged, they
draw their nightmares and the things
that frighten them. And after they
have drawn and discussed them, they
gradually lose their fears. At first,
the pictures are vague, impersonal and
confused. But after more effort and a
chat with the play teacher, they begin
to draw with real design and purpose.
Later, when these children can play
games, accept rules and defeat, and
take their turn in an organized
fashion, they have made considerable
progress.
When they have reached such a
stage, they are nearly ready to be
released from treatment at the Insti-
tute. Elizabeth Draper, General SR-
cretary of the Institute, says that they
are now prepared to make a realistic
adjustment to their homes and back-
grounds. For the Institute always
treats the children while they are still
l1ving at home-so that they may
make a healthy arrangement for living
within their immediate situation.
Today, this Institute for the Scienti-
fic Treatment of Juvenile Delinquency
is more than seventeen years old. Its
clinic for the cure of young people who
have got into trouble with the law has
been taken over by the British Minis-
try of Health, while its research work
has had the support of the United
Nations Appeal for Children. Its me-
thods may seem unusual at first, but
they have had results, which may in-
fluence the treatment of what has been
called wayward youth all over the
world.

RECLAIMING AFRICA
to feed its people
A projected survey of the Bang-weulu swamps in.'<ol'thern Rho-
desia promises to open up an
important new chapter in the dramatic
storv of the struggle to turn the im-
mense food-producing potentialities of
Africa to practical use.
Unlike many parts of the continent,a targe section of the central African
plateau hats an excess of water. It
cullects in great swamps, the most
impressive of which is in Northern Rho-
desia, where there are about
: :'0, 000 square miles of seasonally
flooded land. of which at least one-
third is perpetual swamp.
Swamps have an important place in
nature, for they present the too rapid
run-off of rain in the short wet season.
But the evaporation is very great and
this moisture docs not return as rain.
The Bangweulu swamps are ordinarily
about :). 000 square miles in area, and
; . 00 square miles in the Hood season.
Around their edge is a fringe of fertile
grassland up to five miles wide, which
is lIooded every year tor several
months.
Another fertile area of about
tOO. OOO acres inside the swamp has to
be abandoned periodically by its
lhousands of inhabitants. The plan is
to conlrul the cyclical floods and also
to use surplus water to enlarge the
fertile area..
Several months of preliminary work
will be needed before this end can I ; >os-
sibly be achieved, but all indicatIOns
are favourable.
Singing the praises of literacy.
The title of this song, taken from
an Indonesian pamphlet used in
literacy teaching is * Leam to Read"
and the words of the song repro-
duced above go :"If you want to
become famous you must work hard
and carefully at your studies. If
you study hard you will soon be-
come clever."

which gives a practical value to literacy. The photo and the text
(above) which means'strip cropping and the grass ley'are taken
from a chapter which aims to show African farmers how to improve
grazing for their cattle and the fertility of their soil. This book is
part of a collection received by Unesco's Education Clearing House
from France, Great Britain and Holland, which the Education
Department is using in an Exhibition illustrating the use of text books
for adults in Africa, Indonesia and Indo China. The purpose of the
Exhibition which opened in Paris on February I, and which will later
be sent to Brussels, Amsterdam and London, is to encourage text
book production for use in adult literacy teaching.

Report on the desert : RITCHIE CALDER BEGINS
t new kind of desert war is on. It is not a battle of men against men, of weapons against
weapon. It is a fight against the sands of the arid zones of the world.
To tell the peoples of all nations about the progress of this vital battle, Unesco has
developed a unique educational and information project in co-operation with the U. K. National
Commission, the London"News Chronicle"and Ritchie Calder, science editor of that paper.
Mr. Calder left Paris last month on a seven weeks trip to gather material for a report on
the desert.
He will tell the story of the struggle which many old civilizations have lost, now being waged
by scientists and other experts in remote stations. More than a quarter of the earth's surface
is desert land, covering parts of Asia, Africa, North and South America and Australia
These vast expanses of land can play a vital part in solving the world's food problems. Each
daY new soil is being lost by erosion and by tbe march of the deserts encroaching on fertil"
land.
What can be done now to reclaim there areas ? This is the problem facing the nations of
the world. As the Scientific body of the United Nations. Unesco has already begun to tackle
it and is collecting information on reclamation research going on in the science outposts
of the desert. Mr. Calder will visit a number of these outposts and tell the story of the
modern"legionnaires of science"who live and work in them.
On January 10 he left Paris for North Africa following an interview with M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, D : rector-General of Unesco."The problem of developing for human use the vast desert
surfaces of our planet is one to which Unesco attaches special importance", M. Torres Bodet
told Ritchie Calder,"Your articles, by awakening the public imagination to the challenge
and p03sibility of the desert will render a valuable international service. They should prove
particular : y useful in making the experience of scientists and engineers in the regions you visit
known to readers in other countries where similar conditions exist."
This is the route Ritchie Calder will follow on his 5. 000-mile tour of the deserts.

MEXICAN EDUCATION CENTRE

World-Wide
"Running Commentary"
RITCHIE CALDER'S journey istakmg him over 5, 000 miles
through North Africa and the
Middle East, from Carthage to
Babylon, and the high deserts ot
Persia. His first objective was a
Saharan outpost south of Algiers, on
the Frontiers of Morocco. Then he
panned to visit Carthage and to travel
eas. ward through the wartime battle-
fields of Tripolhania, Cyrenaica and
the Western Desert of Egypt.
Eastwards from there he will go t
the Sinai desert to study research
projects. The great areas of the
Euphrates and Tigris where irrigation
projects have been recommended as
part of the UN Technical Aid to
Underdeveloped-Areas is next on the
trip. In Persia, he will survey the
territory, where it is planned to use
f200, 000, 000 to plough back the wealth
coming from under the earth, before
his trip finally ends in Israel.
These areas are only part of thr
Arid Zones which extend over the
world. But, they form the great
classical desert in which ancient
civilizations have been buried. By
finding out what is happening in these
desert stations and by publ1cising
examples of useful experiments, this
research tour will be a guide to action
and study for future projects in other
parts of the world.
As part of the extensive press and
radio coverage, Ritchie Calder will
write a "running commentary" to be
published in the "News Chronicle" and
in a series of newspaper throughout
the world. The British mass circula-
tion publication,"Picture Post", IS co-operating by sending a photographer
on the trip. Through the B. B. C..
Ritchie Calder's voice will be heard
telling of his experiences.
Schools to Follow
Desert Journey
THE educational aspects of thissurv y h ve lready aroused great
interest in Britain. In this
connection the U. K. National Commis-
SIon for Unesco is promoting an
educational project in schools and
adult education organizations.
Plans include a series. of articles un
the essential facts of the trip to be
published in educational journals, a
special wall map produced by the
"News Chronicle"fer use in schools.
showing the routes with pictures of
the principal places to be visited,
supplemented by an illustrated pam-
phlet and periodical reports of the
desert survey.
The conclusions drawn from the in-
vestigations will appear in special
articles in a British weekly"New
Statesman and Nation ". Finally, as a
permanent record, a presentation of
all this material will be. published as
a text-book suppiemented by visual
aids.
Ritchie Calder has had discussions
with some of the experts who met at
Unesco House recently to consider
plans for an Institute of the Arid
Zones. These experts proposed that an
International Council for Research in
the Arid Zones be created to co-relate
information on projects bemg carried
out in the desert areas of the world.
to promote ether types of investigation,
where they are lacking, and to encou-
rage fundamental research in academic
and other institutions.
The report on the desert made by
this well-known British science writer,
will help us to see this urgent problem
in its perspective. and to reinforce the
action that the nations must take for
its eventual solution.

which has placed a building facing
the PIazza del Mayo at its disposal
and has agreed to provide postal

The Organization of American States

Senor Mendez-Pereira has held the
post of Minister of Education in
several Panamanian Cabinets and has
been Ambassador to the United
States, Cuba and Chile and Minister
to France and the United Kingdom.
He has also represented his country
at United Nations and other interna-
tional conferences, and has written
several works on education and in-
ternational relations.
In his new post he will be assisted
by Professor René Halconruy, a
Belgian expert in fundamental edu-
cation, who has spent many years in
Latin-America as professor at the
University of Sucre, in Bolivia and
director of the School of Languages
at the same university. Professor
Halconruy has written several books
and made a number of surveys on
educational problems.

and an assistant, both of whom
will be members of the Unesco sec-
retariat for at least the first year
of operations. The educational and
training pro ramme of the centre
will be reviewed during Mr. Bowers'
slay in Mexico City. It is planned
that the trainee instructors will have
an eight-month course ;. initially
Inhere will be forty students.
Plans for the training and pru-
duction cenlre formulated at
Unesco's Fourth General Confe-
rence in Paris last September spe-
citìed that such an institution
should serve « a region with
common problems and, as far as
possible, a common language ». It
was further suggested that some
regional organization be asked to
share responsibility. In the pre-
sent instance, both these require-
ments are met, as the centre will
serve all of Latin-America, and an
0. A. S. donation of 100. 000 dollars
has facililated development of the
plan.
Materials for anti-illiteracy cam-
paigns will be produced in the cen-
tre. including texts, wall charts,
cartoons and diagrams, as well as
lilm strips and scripts for cinemas
and radio use. Materials thus pro-
dueed will be lested in actual field
work.
It is proposed to draw 10 trainees
fro Mexico, and the remaining 30
from other Latin-American states.

MUSICIANS and muste-lovers through-out the world are celebrating this
year the memory of Johann-
Sebastian Bach. A number of countries
are organizing special ceremonies to
mark the second centenary of the great
composer's death on July 28th 1730.
Among the many project being
arranged by UNESCO in this connection,
the publication of a catalogue of all
Bach's works and of all Bach record-
ings made during tile last fifty years,
icill be of special interest to musicolo-
gists and music-lovers everychere.
This work is the second volume in
the series "Unesco Archives of Recorded
Music" whose first volume was devoted
to the works of Frederic Chopin. The
Rach catalogue will also include an
introduction, annotations and inset
illustrations.

AMEETING of six men and womenin Unesco House last month
set in motion plans which
with have profound and lasting
effects upon almost every child
who will be attending schoot, in
must countries of the world, in
1951 and thereafter. The event
my was the seventh meeting of the
Joint Committee of Unesco and the
International Bureau of Education.
Together, the conferees planned
a major part of the Agenda for the
Thirteenth Session of the Inter-
nationai Conference on Public
Education to be held in Geneva
from Ihe 6th 10 the i4th July this
year.
To record the educational develop-
ments of 1949-1950 in about 50 nations
which submit reports to the I. B. E., so
that the best and most effective of them
may be distributed and studied by
teachers throughout the world, will lie
the first point on the Conference
Agenda. These reports will be contain-
ed in the International Yearbook of
Education, published regularly for the
past fifteen years.
The Conference will deal with the
best means for introducing children 10
the rich and engrossing world of
mathematics ; how to increase their
grasp of a study which can do so much
to make them more effective men and
women, to discharge a greater part of
the work-load which awaits their ge-
neraUon with greater ease.

Preparing A " Charter " Charter
To help broaden the outlook andimprove the value of teachers to
their pupils, the Conference will
take up a question of increasing the
international exchange of teachers-a
question which has been the subject of
special studies by Unesco. On all these
points, the Conference will make recom-
mendations directly to Ministries of
Education, urging the adoption of prac-
tical measures to implement the prin-
ciplcs involved.
During 1950, the I. B. E. is expected to
continue work already under way, in-
volving standards of training and of pay
for school-teachers. Specifically, the
Organisation will finish its enquiry into
the remuneration of primary teachers,
and will begin its study of the training
of secondary teachers. an enquiry into

T HE year 1950 marks the 25th anni-versary of the I. B. E. During its
quarter century, the Organization
has issued more than one hundred
works dealing with educational develop-
ments in some fifty countries, seeking in
each field to keep all countries abreast
of the latest advance. Its publications
have dealt with such matters as school
buildings, rural education, teaching of
living and classical languages, school
inspection, geography teaching, organi-
zation of school libraries, physical
education, hygiene, and many others.
Unesco and the I. B. E. have worked in
the closest consultation since an agree-
ment between the two organizations was
initialled in Paris on 12th november
1946, even before the first scssion of the
Unesco General Conference. The Di-
rector of the I. B. E., Prof. Jean Piaget,
accepted the temporary charge of
Unesco's Department of Education to fill
the vacancy left by the recent departure
of Dr. Clarence Beeby.

HUMAN RIGHTS MESSAGE
WILL BE SPREAD BY
TRAVELLING EXHIBITION
A REPLICA of the Unesco Exhibition on Human Rights, held in the Musée
Galliéra in Paris last Autumn is to begin a tour of the French provinces
this month. The tour, made possible through the co-operation of the French
National Commission for Unesco, which is paying all expenses, will cover the
principal French cities and towns, beginning with Toulouse, where the exhibi-
tion will be opened in the newly-built Musée Pedagogique. It will then go to
Bordeaux and Limoges, and its arrival in the latter city will coincide with the
creation there of a Unesco Youth Club.
Unesco's Paris Exhibition, illustrat-
ing the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and
showing how the Rights it proclaims
have been fought for throughout the
centuries, was visited by over 16, 000
persons, including six thousand school
children. Hundreds of others wrote.

Original historical Human Rights
Documents, loaned to this exhibition,
including the French Declaration of
the Rights of Man, the Constitution of
1791, and the 1849 Constitution of the
Roman Republic have been photo-
graphed. and will form part of the
exhibition touring France.
An offer by Unesco to provide
facilities for other countries to
organize similar exhibitions has al-
ready been accepted by a number of
governments.
A collection of sketches and photo-
graphic reproductions of different
parts of the Paris Exhibition will
constitute a working basis for
architects and decorators in these
countries. Where two dimensional
exhibitions are being planned, albums
of photos and texts taken from the
original displays will be available, and
for teachers in small country centres
there will be bound books made up of
non-detachable photos and texts.
Altogether, 658 photos and 50 sketches
have been prepared to help carry the
Human Rights message in visual form
to the peoples of many countries.

Trygve Lie (Norwegian), Secretary-Ge-
neral of United Nations, contributes an

kind of human society In which survival
will be based on co-operation Instead of
competition."It calls", he says,"for
people with real maturity, Two basic
qualities of a mature person are
adaptability and compromise, and'both
of these qualities are required of those

ration of Human Rights :"I am even
more hopeful that If we begin to try and
live up to the Declaration we will remove
one of the great causes of war ".

- m-NDIAS renowned poet, Radindranath Tagore. once called on
his country to"welcome the world to its breast,"During
the heat and passions of World War II, his calm voice
assured mankind that the future would see a great"coming
together of nations", and the growth of creative understanding
among them.
Responding to the invitation, and inspired by the same confi-
dence, the Unesco Seminar on Rural Adult Education for Com-
munity Action was held in Tagore's country during November
and the early part of December.
At this"coming together of nations" (1) at Brindavan Gar-
dens, Mysore, nearly 70 educationists pooled their ideas, know-
ledge and experience during 4 1/2 weeks and produced recom-
mendations for an action programme which Unesco will coor-
dinate and send out to all its Member States.
In this space it is possible only to provide a brief outline of the
enormously detailed elements of
the programme ; and merely to
suggest the Iar_ reaching effect
which this programme can bring
about. The four main divisions
of the Seminar's report are
"Literacy","Health and Home
Life","Economic Aspects"and
"Social Life and Citizenship".
These words imply vast and in-
callculalble changes in the lives
of nearly half the inhabitants of
the earth-and a consequent
elevation in the standards of life
for all men and women.
Here, in brief, are some of the
main conclusions of the four
working groups into which the
Seminar was divided :
Practical Approach
to Lltcracfl
LITERACY teaching is anacquired skill and needs
teachers specially trained
for the job."Quick and easy"
techniques still used in many
countries have proved faulty and
shoUild not be employed, whatever
superficially impressive results
they may claim.
The methods, although adapted
to local conditions, should always
be built on modern scientific
principles. The most important of
these is to teach reading through
perception of whole thought
units, and not sylla. 1 :) : e-by-syUaible
or word-by-word. It is impera-
tive that the contents of the
teaching material should be use-
ful and meaningful to pupils ; the
ordinary juvenile ABCs are
nonsensical to adults and tend
to limit reading speed and make
learning to read appear useless.
These are some of the conclu-
sions arrived at by the working
group dealling with LITERACY.
The first task, after agreement
on teaching methods, is to train
instructors. This is urgent in
Asian countries where the adult
population Is still largely illite-
rate.
A midwife for every 5000 people ;
a health centre composed of a
public health nurse, one or two
midwives, a sanitary Inspector
and a social worker for every
10, 000 ; a health unit composed
of several centres and a dispen-
sary under a medical officer for
every 30, 000. These are the mini-
mum requirements for an ade-
quate health service according to
the study group on this basic
problem of HEALTH AND HOME
LIFE.

sights impressed on all the educa-
tionists at the Seminar a sense of
urgency and impatience to put their
action programme into enect.
This group also emphasized the
need for follow-up work in lite-
racy teaching, the most important
aspect of which Is preparation
and distribution of specially
designed reading material. The
readers'interest must be caught
and held by dealing with subjects
of immediate concern to them,
of practical importance to their
dally lives.
Distribution of the literature
can be accomplished by setting
up rural lib ries founded on
modern principles. Energy and

with the development of rural

lating of policies affecting the
home-life of a nation. The at-
tention of governments which
feel he. sitant to initiate rural
adult education programmes on
a mass-scaile owing to lack at
workers, should be drawn to the
vast untapped resources that can
be found among university stu-
dents and patriotic and socially
minded adults.

sed the fact that the tow stan-
dard of living in Asia is largely
due to under-employment of the
agricultural population.
The setting up 01 health

by the group dealing with

Literacy is not the same as Education. but rather a means of pening up
the fields of education and of culture. In Asia* in much the same way
as it was conserved throughout he centuries in Europe, a rich cultural
heritage has been handed down by artists, philosophers, scholars and
by men of religion. such as the Burmese Shan monk. shown in this photo.
One of the aims of the work done at Mysore is to open up this heritage

ministration and its own budget.
This group formulated its re-
commendations after a detaited
study of home and health condi-
tions in Asian rural communities.
The problem of disease-breeding
dirt was the dominating one in
all the areas surveyed. Lack of
cleanliness in cooking, sleeping
and living quarters ; lack of per-
sonal cleanliness ; absence of suf-
ficient latrines and adequate
drainage are at aspects of the
same problem.
Woman's Hole in
Fight For Health
ALL these deficiencies can bealleviated through educa-
tion ; and the prevalence
of malaria, tuberculosis and
other diseases can thus be
reduced.
The need for preventive medi-
cine-at least as important as
curative medicine-was stressed.
Here, the rural community worker
can play an important part.
even if not speciality trained in
medicine. A minimum knowledge
of individual and public health
is part of the necessary equipment
of each village worker. The
position of the woman in the
family must be improved and
her work appreciated : she must
be made the centre of all efforts
for educating the family to
he2, lth : er ways of living.
Unesco was asked to make its
member states aware of the im-
portance of giving women more
adequate representation on inter-
national seminars, national
It considered the following as
appropriate means of creating
fuller employment :"A com-
prehensive survey by experts of
the rural communities'primary
needs ; establishment of rural or
cottage industries to meet these
needs in order of priority. In
the choice of such industries,
self-sufficiency of the village
should first be aimed at-in
general, no attempt should be
made to compete with large-scale
urban industries using mass-
production methods". To fur-
ther achieve self-sufficiency, sub-
sidiary occupations should be
found, especially those that
provide work during periods of
seasonal unemployment. Train-
ing centres are required to
teach the skills necessary for
economic production of good
quality-these should also be
community centres which can
also serve as rural marketing
agencies. Co-operative organiza-
tion is necessary for almost all
cottage and rural industries, from
financing to production and
marketing.
Unesco has been asked to
collect and distribute to its
member stales all available infor-
mation on cottage industries.
"The teacher should not be
like the merchant seeking goodly
pearls, but like the husbandman
who waiteth for the precious
fruit of the earth and hath long
patience of it". This is one of
the basic principles which the
group considered should govern
the approach to the economic
uplift of rural communities.
Begin where the people are and
with what they have ; teaching
should reach down to the level
of the poorest ; no deserving
person should be deprived of
educational benefits by reason of
poverty.
Detailed reports of village com-
munity life in fifteen, mainly
Asian, countries served as the
background to the work of the
group which dealt with SOCIAL
LIFE AND CITIZENSHIP. They
revealed certain, trends common
to almost all rural communities,
the most important of which is
the Isolation of the village. The
village as a world of its own is
undoubtedly a danger to the
development of modern Asian
countries.
This study-group drew up à'
seven-point curriculum for citi-
zenship traini, ng with these
headings : Personal dignity and
worth ; respect and consideration
for all human beings irrespective
of social and economic status
and political and religious affilia-
tions ; kinship with the commu-
nity and cooperation in commu-
nity activities ; interdependence
of the social, economic and cultu-
ral life of the country as a whole ;
concept of one-world and its
implications in terms of world
citizenship ; cultural and national
heritage and unity in diversity ;
political rights and duties.
It was stressed that a curricu-
lum does not consist only of
informational items to be taught,
but also activities and experien-
ces which give life and reality
to them. Citizenship itself is a
dynamic concept which expresses
itself in activities. The group
has therefore indicated suitaMe
activities and experiences toge-
ther with the information to be
imparted.
No Blind Belief
in Modern Method
MUCH time was spent on thestudy of media and me-
thods in citizenship train-
ing as outlined In the curriculum.
Among the old traditional media
considered were : festivals, fairs,
pilgrimages to temples and tombs,
ashrams, folklore folk dances and
dramas, sport. These media of
proved worth should not be dis-
carded In a blind belief In the
superiority of the modern mecha-
nistic media such as press, radio
and film. The new media can
play a vital part In rural commu-
nity education, but they must be
handled with care, knowledge
and skill.
Other recommendations were :
In areas where the population
Is not yet enfranchised, local
self-governing institutions shouldbe introduced ; every country
should encourage the establish-
ment of special agencies for the
training of personnel and for
production of literature and other
aids for civic and social training
in rural areas ; Unesco should
undertake the production of adult
education literature and visual
aids especially suited for Asian
conditions ; it should draw up
specimen programmes for the co-
ordinated and Intensive use of
mass media In the presentation
of themes pertaining to adult
and fundamental education ;
follow-up seminars on a regional
and national basis should be
organized.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 6

History is often regarded as a fixed collection of standard facts, which it would be
all but sacrilegious to think of"rewriting"-yet it is just that task of rewriting
history which is one of the main concerns of responsible educators in all countries.
The job of correcting textbooks, and improving teaching methods ; of deciding
that this or that event is of greater or less importance, is truly an unending one. At this
mid-point of the 20th century, more attention is being paid than ever before to the
urgency of that task-whose importance is suggested by other stories on these pages. More
recently recognized, but equally vital, is the proper teaching of geography, to make young
people aware of the day-to-day interdependence of peoples.
Accordingly, UNESCO has convoked two seminars, dealing with closely related aspects
of the same job, to be held at the same time, in Brussels, Belgium, and at McGill University,
Montreal, Canada. At Brussels, from July 12 to August 23, more than one hundred
experts from many countries will discuss"The Improvement of Textbooks, Particularly
of History Textbooks."
The principal aims of this group will be to increase the emphasis on the teaching of
world history as the basis for national histories ; to focus more attention on the construc-
tive work of mankind, particularly through the great foe, milky of international organizations ;
to eliminate or at least reduce"jingoism"and deprecatory statements about"foreign"
nations and peoples.
Similar broad purposes will guide the experts meeting at Montreal on"The Teaching
of Geography as a Means of Developing International Understanding."

boy in Germany, who first learned
to read between 1933 and 1937.
learned fro  his first school books
that other boys had been born to
be his slaves ; that the lands of other
men had been stolen from his fatherland ;
that the rightful victory of his country
had somehow been"stolen"10 or 14
years before he was born.
He was taught to burn the books that
could have helped to save him and all
mankind from what was to follow.
In 1949, that boy and his surviving
classmates were asked a series of questions
by interviewers for the French Institute
of Public Opinion. Here are some of the
answers :

students, aged 18 to 22, said Hitlerism

and that it will return to power ; that

race prejudices ; thAt the Allied powers
had no right to try men as war criminals,
and that they have no right to enforce
de-Nazification of the country.
From the first day of their schooling,
the minds of these young men and their
contemporaries in Italy and Japan had
been flogged by slogans :
"BELIEVE, OBEY AND FIGHT !...
WAR IS LIFE !... THE STATE IS THE
ONLY REAL BEING... THE LEADER IS
ALWAYS RIGHT !... A BOOK AND A
MUSKET !... WAR IS THE FATHER OF
CREATION AND THE MOTHER OF
CULTURE."
Even their elementary arithmetic books
had problems like this :"If one of our
bombers... If one of our soldiers... If you
have three hand grenades..."
Finding the Happy Medium
ONE must not infer from this thatonly the f rmer Axis power have
been guilty of bias in their textbooks.
In the school histories of nearly every
country,"we"have fought purely to
defend justice and civilization, and
"they"have had only sordid motives.
"We"have generally won-or lost-
against"overwhelming odds".
The history of cooperative efforts to
remove bias from schoolbooks records
victories of a better kind. It was natural
enough that soldiers returning to their
countries after World War I should have
been revolW by schoolbooks which
glorified war, and that they led in efforts
for reform. It was natural, too, for
Anatole France to oversimplify the pro-
blem, in addressing a Congress of French
Elementary School Teachers at Tours m
1919 :
"BURN THE BOOKS WHICH TEACH
HATRED ! BURN THEM ALL !"
Gradually the negative approach gave
way to positive action, as teachers
within their own countries worked to im-
prove teaching materials. Increasingly
they arrived at certain common conclu-
sions :
In history books it was important tur
writers to eliminate fiat falsifications 01
fact, but also to become aware of and
eliminate their own unconscious bias and
prejudice. War as a topic was greatly
over-emphasized-taking up more than
30 per cent of most textbooks-but it
was realized that an arbitrary"de.
emphasis"could distort truth as badly as
the prevailing jingoism.
It was agreed that new and revised
textbooks should contain more informa-
tion about the building of cities, the de-
velopment of inventions, the expansion of
industry, the spreading of railroads and
she peaceful trading between nations. It
was felt to be very important to devote
more attention to the history of inter-
,'national peace organizations.
Mutual Fairness
In School Books
BUT how, for example, could even themost conscientious historian elimi-
nate his own"unconscious bias" ?
The answer was found in making t'leer
studies international.
Children throughout Europe, with intimate memories of war, are likely to produce
the ugly shapes of bombs instead of Bowers, when asked to draw a garden ; to depict
a demon torturing mankind, when asked to illustrate"life to-day"The examples above
ing for mutual fairness in school books.
The first such treaty was signed by the
Argentine and Brazil in 1933,
The most comprehensive job of all was
accomplished by the Norden Societies of
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and
Sweden, from 1919 onwards. Working in
close consultation, the Societies studied
compared and revised all the history
books used in their schools-to provide
factual and non-provocative material
about these countries and the past rela-
tions between them. All proposed new
history texts are now submitted to all
the Norden Societies.
On the initiative of Germain teachers,

aeroplanes in a light. a squadron and a wing, the children were asked :"How many planes in
squadrons ? in 2. 4. 6. squadrons ? Three wings make a group. How many planes in a group ?"
Considerable perspective was gained on
the War of 1812 when the Canada-United
States Committee on Education made a
joint study of U. S. textbooks which
described it as a fight fc r"freedom of
the seas"and of Canadian books which
spoke of it as.'a stab in the back... delhi-
vered when Britain was fighting for the
freedom of the world".
Similar groups worked in the same way
to improve understanding among a
number of Latin American countries.
Where governmental authority over the
school system permitted, formal treaties
were agreed to between countries provid-

French and German historians met in
Paris in 1935 and reached agreement on
39 disputed points about Franco-German
relations from 1789 through the signing
of the Locarno Pact in 1925, Where
complete agreement was impossible, they
took note of each other's reservations.
An extensive programme for encourag-
ing revision of books in the two countries
was agreed to, but the German Govern-
ment withdrew support for the project
and the findings were disavowed.
Many studies were stimulated by the
International Institute on Intellectual
Cooperation, whose work for textbook
revision was jointly supported by the
French Government and the League of
Nations. The signing of international
treaties was encouraged, but it was found
that the educational systems of the larger
countries were too decentralized to be
bound by such treaties. In other words
- international understanding by pupils
had to be reached through international
understanding among the teachers, his-
torians and writers.
The Real Fruits
Of Civilization
UNESCO has taken on a leading roleU inthe fight for better understanding
through better textbooks. In 1946.
the Preparatory Commission of Unesco
published"LOOKING AT THE WORLD
THROUGH TEXTBOOKS". Since then.
Unesco has done many things, among
them the following :
1. It has distributed to all Member States
copies of"A MODEL PLAN FOR THE
ANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENT OF.
TEXTBOOKS AS AIDS TO INTERNA-
TIONAL UNDERSTANDING". This
work, prepared by Dr. 1. James Quillen.
of Stanford University provides a large
number of practical proposals for the
"TESTING"of books and encouraging
higher standards of writing and selec-
tion.
2, Unesco has encouraged special studies,
by Member States of the treatment in
their own textbooks of agencies of
international cooperation, from the
founding of the League of Nations to
the present.
3, The Organization has given specific
assistance to nations, groups and indi-
viduals working on projects for texts- !
book improvement. In this connection.
Unesco has recently published"A
HANDBOOK FOR THE IMPROVE-
MENT OF TEXTBOOKS AND TEACH-
ING MATERIALS".
As such work progresses, fewer and
fewer young people will be tramed to
believe they were born to avenge ima-
ginary.'historic wrongs"and that nam : ;-

More and more of them will understand
that the reality of history lies in such

Unesco, the International Civil Aviation

are the work of German children, and vividly illustrate the need for mental reconstruc-
tion. Of the many aspects of re-education, the revision of textbooks is one of the
most imperative. To this work. needed in all countries. Unesco is giving practical aid.

THE end of the war in the Far East
provided the much needed opportu-nity to implant in Japanese child en
a truer appreciation of the indivi-
dual as a human being and to give them
a mere realistic picture of their own
country in relation to other nations.
'The first essential task was to reform
the teaching of history, for this subject
had been much distorted in the books in
use at that time. These books had been
issued in 1943 and were written from a
rnilitaristic viewpoint.
Japan's new textbcoks are no longer
illustrated with Samurais on horseback
and gods descending from the heavens.
Instead, they show works of art, popular
scenes, or scholars and scientists at
work.
In one, for instance, is the story of
Fenellosa, the foreign art critic, who,
towards the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury, fought against the destruction by
the Japanese themselves of relics of
Japan's artistic past.
The new texts stress the importance of
modern rather than ancient times. The
origin of the Japanese race is no longer
explained by legends of ancient mytho-
logy, but in the light of the scientific
findings of anthropologists and archae-
ologists.
Instead of learning the episodes of the
clan warfare of feudal times, children are
taught the history of their country's
c'vil administration, that of navigation
and of the development of popular insti-
tutions. Instead of speaking about the
aggressive policy of European nations, the
new history books explain the decline of
the Samurais, the democratic evolution
of the Meiji era, and the cultural evolu-
tion of modern Japan.
The old textbooks go no further than
the celebration of the 2, 600th anniver-
sary of the empire 0940 in the Christian
calendar) ; the new ones include the
attack upon Pearl Harbour and stress the
importance of the Emperor's radio speech
in which he announced Japan's uncondi-
tional surrender.
The history book ends with these
words :"The advent of the military
clique brought misery to Japan and
dragged the nation to Mar".
Written in a Spoken Language
IN this way, the interest of Japanesechildren is being turned from martial
matters to scientific and cultural
subjects. By studying ancient tombs and
fossils, they learn how their country
originated and developed.
Studying the history of their people
within the general pattern of world his-
tory widens the cultural horizon of these
children, so that they gradually become
aware of Japan's place in the world as
a whole.
They are beginning too to use their
powers of discrimination, to establish
parallels between the culture of ancient
Japan and that of Persia and Arabia.
They are taught to develop their indi-
viduality and critical sense by answering
sets of questions at the end of each
chapter of their history books.
Another important reform is that these
textbooks are now written in the
"spoken"language. This language,
simpler than the classical vocabulary
which includes Chinese and compound
Sine-Japanese words, js more easily
understood by children.
Historians With Fresh Vision
THE new textbooks, therefore, teach thechildren to see history in a n w light :
when speaking of the sixteenth cen-
tury, for example, they no longer refer
cnly to the subject of feudal unification ;
they also tell of the first ccntacts with
the outside world through Christianity
and cf trade with Holland and Portugal.
Finally the old chronology based upon
the reigns of the different emperors has
been abolished. Each emperor was given
a posthumous name and the dates were
established in relation to each reign.
Today, Japanese textbooks use the
Christian calendar so as to enable
parallels to be drawn with the history
of other nations.
In this way, historic and intellectual
isolation is being abolished.
Effcrts are being made to introduce for
school study the works of Japanese
scholars which would have a far greater
value than those hitherto employed. One
of the most suitable of these books is
"The Y amato Era", which was inspired
by H. G. Wells'"Outline o/World
History".
This work deals with the creation of the
world and with Japanese anthropology
and archaeology, starting with the story
cf the Ainus, a white race which origi-
nally occupied the country.
Japan's increasingly broad-minded and
socially conscious h'stcrians are daily
expanding their own vision of the world.
as they gain access t new sources for
research and study. The children of
Japan, and cf all lands, are deriving
benefit from this improved vision.

ONE of the aims of iruly internationaltinkers is that history should she
written and taught, as a glohal
subject. The story of man's strug-
gle up to his present stage of culture
should context of the whole
study of human history.
This is not a new idea. Suggestions
for revising history textbooks were agreed
upon shortly after the First World War
when experts cited the fact that a third
of most hbtol'Y hooks was devoted to the
study of wars. Schemes for such revision
have been under way for many years, and
have been carried out with good results
hetween Scandinavian countries, Canada
and the United States, between several
Latin-American nations, and on a limited
scale, between some European countries.
It should be noted that these agreements
for the revision of history teaching took
place before \\'orld \\'al'II.
\\'e can still say truthfully Ihatltiston-
teaching is improving. But it is a slow
process to reduce ultra-nationalistic tend-
rncies in both writing and teaching
history. A child can be taught to regard
history as an account of the evolution or
customs and traditions. He can learn
something of peaceful developments
without, losing slight of the destruction
naused by wars.
There are many distinguished interna-
tional authorities on education who believe
Ihe basic principles for teaching history
should he changed. Some of these people
met recently at Unesco House, in Paris, to
consider draft outlines of a handbook for
history teaching which may bring about
this change. The history instruction
handbook will he printed first, next Sum-
met, after it is analyzed by a seminar on
lextbook improvement at Brussels.
Since The Time Of
Thucydides
THE draft. oulline for this work was pre-pared for tile Unesco meeting by
Mme. M. T. Maurette, of the Inter-
national School of Geneva, setting forth
some ideas on the teaching of history
which might hclp harassed teachers to
present a halanced interpretation of
human events. She agrees with Paul
Valéry, who felt that history-teaching
which encourages mistrust of all"foreign-
ers"is so had from the world harmony
viewpoint. Ihat it might be better if history
were not taugh at all.
"Since) the time of Thucydides the
writing of history has been a continual
striving toward the truth", her outline
states. "But whereas he tried to esta-
blish it for his small world of Greece, we we
must now try to establish it for the whole
world."
Mme. Maurette would like to slow up
the process of history instruction for the
young, and limit, a child's study to "pre-
paratory " work before the age of 12.
initialty, a student would concentrate
upon the history and international deve-
lopment of floods, clothes, habitation.
transportation, and the modes of play
among children of all the world. Concen-
tration upon these "centres of interest"
replaces the old system of administering
large and rather indigestible doses of
dates and trends. Then pre-history would
follow. including comparalive study of
living primitive peoples. teaching thc chid
how our species came to its present state
of culture. In early adolescence the
pupil should hegin to sludy his national
history, and world history, either combined
of separate.
An "Eye-Opener"-
For Children
IN each case, Mme Maurelle emphasized,instruction should dhere firmly to a
policy of showing "the increasing in-
ter-dependence of the peoples of the world
in cultural, technical, economic and poli-
tical fields", and or making children
aware of "prejudices, intolerance, and
national sellistiness. and of the necessity
to overcome them". Specific teacher-
methods were included for the classroom
on each of her points.
Under this system the teaching of
history would be carefully graded to match
the progressive development of the pupils'
capacily for understanding.
Adopting the general outlines of these
suggestions, the experts at Unesco House.
who had come from six different coun-
tries, added the following suggestion in
the further hope of safeguarding the
history student of the future :
Page 7-UNESCO COURIER
A special section should be included,
called Aims and Purposes to stress "cultu-
ral interpenetration, the importance of a
balanced presentation of the contributions
of different parts of the world, un under-
standing of foreign relations, the impor-
tance of the teacher's attitude...
And finally an emphasis on " the absence
in the classroom of any tendency to ridi-
cude other groups".
In short, let's have a teaching of history
that is adapted to the mental and psycho-
logical development of the child and
which at the same time helps to open his
eyes to the world.

SEMINARS
A NEW
APPROACH
TO WORLD
HISTORY
IN producing this Handbook, Unesco has
provided its Member States with a
basic guide for their textbook impro-
vement activities.
First major publication of Unesco's
Textbook Improvement Project, it follows
a previous booklet, Looking at the World
Through Textbooks ("Les Livres de Classe
et la Découverte du Monde") published
in 1946,
The first part of the Handbook tells the
story of efforts to improve textbooks,
beginning after the first World War when
the movement "took on the spirit of a
crusade, with teachers organizations and
peace societies in the vanguard.
During this period, the League of
Nations had its International Institute of
Intellectual Co-operation working on the
problem, and in Scandinavia, the Norden
Association developed its unofficial system
of criticizing history textbook manuscripts.
And there were dozens of other private
groups working to make textbooks into
instruments of peace.
Part Two of the book outlines Unesco's
programme for textbook improvement,
and gives a Model pan which suggests
techniques of analysis : It also includes a
specific proposal to Member States that
they begin by increasin their textbook
coverage of the United Nations and other
international agencies which have existed
since 1918.
A set of recommendations, varied
enough to suit the conditions found in
all Unesco's Member States are contained
in Part Three, as well as a bibliography
of books and articles in eight languages
which provides ample material on the
background of the textbook revision move-
ment. Finally, two appendices reproduce
the texts of "textbook" treaties between
different countries and the League of Na-
tions'famous Casares Resolution of 1926
together with its later amendments.
The major part of the publication was
prepared by Dr. 1. James Quillen, Profes-
sor of E'ducation at Stanford University
(U. S. A.), during his year's service in
Unesco's Department of Education,
editorial assistance being given by
Mr. George H. Kelly, formerly of the
Department of Political Science at Stan-
ford University, who prepared the chapter-
on textbook treaties.
This Unesco Handbook, whose present
English language edition will be followed
in March by one in French, will serve as
a"bible"for Member States and edu-
cators who are active in textbook impro-
vement.

G WORLD'S ENGINEERS
AK THE SAME LANGUAGE
It is to the skill of shuctural and electrical engineers that we owe the construction and
smooth running of hydro-electrical projects such as the one at Genissiat, France
(shown above) whose success is equally important to the worker and the housewife.
Work on the Genissiat Dam-the largest in Western Europe to-day-began in
1936 but was interrupted by the war. Completed and put into operation in 1948. this
dam is over 300 feet high, nearly 200 yards wide and has a base thickness of nearly
300 feet. Genissiat. which dams the River Rhone, is designed to produce an annual
output of 2. 000 million kilowatts. Another giant hydro-electric installation. Boulder Dam,
in the United States, has an annual production of 5. 000 million kilowatt hours. One of
the most striking examples of how this vital source of energy,"white coal"', as
the French call it. can be used, is the work done in the Tennessee Valley, United
States. Twenty dams, built over a period of ten years, transformed this once"dying
valley"into a rich and prosperous countryside. (Photo : United Press.)
FOR lack of a dictionary, a waterpower project may be delayed, or
the design of a machine to in-
crease production 01 tractors, or snoes
or telephones may be held up.
The reason is that the majority of
the documents on engineering are
published in very few languages. For
historical reasons, engineering has
been a specialization of a very few
countries in the main, and it is esti-
mated that 80 per cent of all the pa-
pers engineers should read are pub-
lished in French, English or Ger-
man. Thus it is necessary to have
accurate engineering dictionaries to
facilitate translation and permit
practical use of this material.
This technical civilization of ours
presents some special difficulties be-
cause it is easy to misunderstand
terms that are used in different
countries. Even among the world's
leading engineers, misunderstanding
may arise because they use the same
technical expression tor different
ideas. Therefore, to assist the free
now of engineering information, some
method must be devised to ensure that
what is meant is clearly and exactly
understood, and has the same meaning
to a II cnginpers.
This is the fundamental problem
discussed recently at Unesco House
in Paris by a study group of en-
gineers. The immediate need is not
10 increase the number of documents
available to engineers, but to help them
track down quickly the necessary
material to solve some new problem,
or to study some specific construction,
among the mass of documents con-

Urgent Need For
New Dictionaries
BEFORE the war, technical diction-aries in six l nguages were avail-
able. But these are now difficult to
find, and would, in any case, need
drastic revision because of the great
progress made in scientific engineer-
ing. A number of international asso-
ciations are tackling the problem. The
Permanent International Association
of Navigation Congresses, for example,
has published five volumes of a series
of fifteen which, when complete, will
include all the terms needed by engi-
neers in this field. The International
Commission on Large Dam Construc-
tion has also completed preparations
for a dictionary. Similar projects are
being considered for bridge and struc-
tural engineering, electrical engineer-
ing, soil mechanics, and topography.
These projects are, however, making
slow progress. The publication of
a dictionary is rarely a profitable
commercial venture, and the lack of
general directives is also a serious
handicap. It is, of course, inevitable
that dictionaries of terms used in the
different branches of engineering
should overlap. and it is therefore es-

THE selling up of Popular Science
Institutes where the " man in the
streel " could see how science can
and does change his way of life is one
of the suggestions made in the latest
report published by the Division for l'"hli"llI'tI hy Ihe/) h'ision fll"
Science and its Popularization, of
Unescos Natural Sciences Department.
The Report, "The Theory and
Practice of Popular Science " has been
written by Dr David S. Evans, a young
scientist of Welsh brith, now working
awl at the Radcliffe Observatory, Pretoria,
Union of South Africa.
Surveying the field of popularization
of science and assessing the problem as
a whole in relation to modern times,
Dr. Evans, who was formerly advisory
editor of the British science magazine
"Discovery ", emphasises the urgency
of making science understandable to
the layman. He discusses the strategy
and tactics of popularizing science in
the press, magazines and books, through
the spoken work and in scientific films.
Popular Science
Institutes I."rged
HE believes that "the newspapers andthe scientists need to co-operate
ever more closely so that the for-
mer can acquire a better appreciation
of the handling and presentation of
scientific subjects, and the latter should
so organize themselves, that this need
is met".
He advocates the selling-up of Insti-
tutes of Popular Science, which he sug-
gests could probably be made a finan-
cial success. Each of these should
include film projection rooms, a plane-
tarium, laboratories and a small te-
) escopc, demonstrations, lectures and a
library and museum. "The new em-
phasis", he says, "should, if possible,
be on direct manual experience rather
than on visual instruction. Il is clearly
a large programme, but its political
implications alone, in a country based
on technical advances, would make the
project worth while ".
He advocates also the introduction
into universities, where important
fundamental scientific advances are
made, of Public Relations Officers who
can ct as skilled interpreters of new
developments. These P. R. O. s would
help to "smooth out the irrigating
misconceptions of new advances which
are the bane of the scientists responsi-
ble for for them ".

other Reports, may be obtained on

sential that the same terms appearing
in different dictionaries should have
the same translation. It is suggested
that there should be not only a trans-
lation but also a drawing, where pos-
sible, so that no doubt will exist as
to what exactly is meant.
The engineering experts therefore
recommended that Unesco consider
this task as a number one priority,
and proposed that a"dictionaries
committee"should be set up. These
recommendations are now being acted
on through the work of the Natural
Sciences Department of Unesco.

IN the year 1749 a certain Mon-
sieur de la CUza drew up plans
and started building a town,
which was to be called 1'Hopital,
on the West coast of the island of
Haiti. Situated in a wide bay, pro-
tected by two long peninsulas arid
by the lie de la Gonave, this city later
became Port-au-Prince, capital of the
Republic of Haiti.
Port-au-Prince has had a troubled
history. It was destroyed by earth-
cendants of these slaves who are to-
day free men and citizens of the
Republic of Haiti.
During the last one and a half cen-
turies the people of Haiti have walked
a hard path from conditions of gene-
ral slavery to emancipation as a free
people. And their conception of
Human Rights has been more than a
legal or philosophical concept.

abolition of slavery in all French colonies (see above). One of the most famous of these
coloured deputies was lean-baptists Belley (1746-1804) whose portrait (reproduced ctbove)
was painted in 1797 and is now in the Versailles Museum. Another diorama at the exhibition
shows Monsieur de Saint Lo, the Haitian delegate to the United Nations Third General
Assembly, presenting the draft Declaration of Human Rights, on December 9. 1948.
It is therefore appropriate that the
theme of Human Rights should figure
in the celebration of Port-au-Prince's
second centenary this year and to this
end, Unesco is organizing an exhibition
for inclusion in the International Exhi-
bition to be held in the capital of
Haiti.
On January 2nd, crates weighing
over a ton left Unesco House in
Paris for Haiti. They contained
wooden and aluminium wall-panels,

shown at Port-au-Prince and later in
other towns of the Republic.
Some of the exhibits will be of
special interest to Haitians. There is
a scale model of the"Ouragan" (Hur-
ricane), a slave-ship built at Nances
in 1830 ; it was originally a schooner
and later converted into a 150 ton brig.

opened a new chapter in the history of
Human Rights, a period which should

Young Egyp tians

CLAY OF THE N ! LE
Last month, an exhibition of sculptures tapestriesand drawings by youngEgyptians was opened at UNESCO House, Paris, by H. E. Ahmed
Saroit Bey, the Egyptian Ambassador in Paris and by M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Director-General of UNESCO.
This exhibition, which created something of a sensation amongst the
critics and the general public, was organized by UNESCO'S Department
of Cultural Activities, as part of its project for the Arts in General Edu-
cation. This project is concerned with ways in which the arts are used
throughout the world as a means to education.
worked to bring about in recent years
an extraordinary change in the atti-
tude towards the aims and methods
of education.
Habib Gorgi, as an educator in a
responsible position, was well aware
of these developments. In his official
capacity he succeeded in introducing
many changes in the methods of
training teachers and of teaching the
arts in Egypt. Aided by his wife, he
also carried out special experiments
in methods of art teaching in his own
home and in a few small private vil-
lage schools for small groups.

WARE of the great value of the
yak arts both for developing indivi-dual cultural appreciation and
expressicn and promoting inter-
national understanding, Unesco works,
to promote wider diffusicn of the arts,
and to encourage greater apprecia-
tion of their significance as instru-
ments of education. It pursues this
aim particularly thrcugh its project
for the Arts in General Education.
Unesco therefore welcomed the
opportunity of sponsoring an exhibi-
tion whichßo admirably demonstrated
what can/be done, even with the sim-
plest materials and equipment, to de-
velop the natural artistic abilities of
children, provided they are taught and
encouraged with sympathetic insight
and understanding.
These are qualities which particular-

the sands of Egypt, but in the sub-
conscious minds of his young compa-
triots for traces of that great art
which characterised ancient Egypt.
Gorgi, in accord with Jung's theory
of the collective unconscious, believed
these traces could still be reached
through his pupils if only he could
give them the right conditions.
To decide en the right conditions

was a difficult problem. Habib Gorgi
does not accept the modern attitude
which, as he puts it"permits the child
to become his own master with unres-
tricted liberty. In practice, this theory
has to be modified. In art especially,
the majority of children do not profit
by this unbridled freedom. They
often indulge in a precess of unceasing
self-repetition".
Gorgi realized that the crux of the
problem lay in the teacher-child
relationship. Whilst the teacher
should neither impose a standard of
aesthetic values nor kill enthusiasm by
misguided criticism, it was his respon-
sibility deliberately to create situations
in which the child could decide upon
the appropriate reactions.
The existing attitudes and conditions
in the schools scarcely allowed for
such experiments, and so Gorgi
worked on his own.
STORY OF SAYEDA
AND THE LION
HE went to that part of the popu-lation where life had undergone
no basic change since the time of
the Pyramids-to the peasant class.
He tells a delightful story of the day
he found Sayeda Missac, who lived in
cne of the poorest districts in Cairo.
She and her many brothers and sisters
lived largely by their wits-playing
and begging. As soon as a school
was opened in the neighbourhood
Sayeda enrolled. There one day Gorgi
found her"struggling to sculpt
Daniel in the Lion's Den. She had
never seen a lion. but she closed her
eyes and asked for the power to make
something very ferocious", What
she produced was a creature with
little resemblance to the kind, of
beasts, but easily excelling him in
ferocity..'"'
Subsequently Sayeda lived its. bib
Gorgi's household for seven years.
Sometimes she goes back to the excite-
ment of the crowded streets and to
a life of idleness, but she always comes
back in chastened mood and, of her
own accord, works harder than ever.
She was the first of many eh11dren
who came to stay and work in the
favourable environment of the Gorgi
household, in company with his own
children.
REFLECTION OF AN
ANCIENT TRADITION
FOR working materials, Habib Gor-gi has given the children paper
and crayons, and there are many
examples in the Exhibition of their
drawings. These, apart from the local
Egyptian subject matter, have the
same basic characteristics as those
which distinguish children's drawings
everywhere. But it is interesting to
find that linear and pictorial expres-
sion did not altogether suit the needs
of these children. So Habib gave
them clay and also let them make
tapestries on primitive looms.
It is above all clay and sculpturing
that seem to suit them best, and it is
through this medium that they find
true freedom, and at the same time
most obviously reflect the subconscious
memory of their own Egyptian artistic
traditions. Similarly, in the low-relief
carvings in white stone there is the
strongest echo of the subtlety of the
finest ancient Egyptian friezes and
panels.
The teaching technique is something
difficult to describe in words, for like
all good educational methods it does
not eonsist so much of a rigid formula
as of a mutual relationship. It does
not depend on Habib Gcrgi imparting
his knowledge to the children. He
says that his function consists mainly
in creating an atmosphere and a
situation"which will liberate the
child of stored images and make him
richly productive, and at the same
time protect him from the influence
of undesirable elements".
In practice he may tell them tradi-
tional fairy tales and mythological
stories ; he encourages them to draw
inspiration from the scenes and events
of their daily lives, but most of all he
depends upon establishing the right
relationship between himself and his
children. He says :"We sit upon the
ground in our big room and we work
together ; we are all working and
singing and we are happy."
