The mists of time
Etching (39.5 x 49 cms) by Roland Maison
Belgian artist Roland Maison's etching of a forest of figures riven
by a vertical crevasse evokes the abyss of time. This haunting
work has affinities with Maya art, especially with the masks of
the sky-serpent in the palace at Kabah (Yucatan) and with certain
Toltec sculptures with big, dreamy eyes.

Interview
Maurice Béjart
A journey of initiation
When you started out in the 1950s,
ballet was still very much in the
classical mould. You gave it shock
treatment, as Nijinsky had done. He
shocked in order to rejuvenate dance.
Maurice Béjart: My aim has never been
to shock, but rather to help awaken
people's sensibilities. My revolution has
not been an aesthetic revolution, like
Nijinsky's, but a social one. Nijinsky
introduced a completely new aesthetic
in music, decor and acting. But he
would give only four or five perfor¬
mances of each ballet in opera houses
and before an audience of connoisseurs.
What I wanted to do was to change
the venue and the public. I hired 5,000-
seat sports stadiums for a month and
offered seats at prices people could
afford. I got dance accepted at the Avi¬
gnon Festival, in open-air amphitheatres
and popular venues. In my view dance
can no longer be elitist. It's a universal
language, a universal means of bringing
people together. In popular dances all
over the world, the first thing people do
is join hands. Dance is a means of social,
political and religious communication.
And members of the public are caught
up in that magic, in that moment of
empathy. Their hearts miss a beat, their
minds broaden and their bodies yearn to
unfold. I agree dance should break
the mould and move to the rhythm of
passions and impulses, death and
rebirth. The aim should be to put
across not a coded, highly symbolic mes¬
sage, but an inner élan.
Hence one of your innovations:
immobility and meditation within the
framework of dance itself.
M. B.: This is an area where I have been
greatly influenced by certain Oriental
disciplines. My father spoke and wrote
Chinese. I myself studied Zen under the
master Deshimaru. Zen teaches us a
bodily attitude to time and space which
is very different from the Western one.
It is based on the principle that empti¬
ness is something beneficial. The idea of
emptying the egg of the world of all its
dross and filling it with the transparency
of light and air is something that con¬
cerns the choreographer and the
dancer. Through dance I try to make an
offering of serenity and unity to Western
man, who is so atomized, fragmented
and compartmentalized.
You have also been influenced by
the martial arts, haven't you?
M. B.: Yes. The martial arts suggest one
way of reintegrating our bodies into the
cosmos. They are not about combat or
competition, but rather an internal dis¬
cipline that enables us to regulate the
energy within us. Human beings are sub¬
ject to a process of ebb and flow, yin and
yang, and continuous change of one into
the other, and the other into one. They
are therefore closely bound up with the
unity and multiplicity of the world,
which abounds with possibilities and is
at once unchanging and in a state of per¬
petual flux. They are subject to
rhythms which mark their daily lives
and which dance tries to put across:
activity and rest, absorption and elimi¬
nation, budding, flowering and death.
They are an integral part of that uni¬
versal order. Dance should above all cel¬
ebrate that fact.
A droj) of rain falling on the tree out
there in the garden will change a leaf,
which will change a fragment of an
oxygen molecule, which in turn will
change the way we breathe. Everything
is closely interconnected. Wc are
nothing but flux, as we go from one
moment to the next. That is why it is so
important to be present, undividedly
and concentratedly, in each of those
moments, in each of our actions. The
smallest leaf or tiniest drop of water can
contribute to the equilibrium of the
world. Dance must become part of that
general momentum.
Is there a dividing line in your work
between the sacred and the profane?
M. B.: There is no such thing as the pro¬
fane. Everything is sacred, from eating
and sleeping to making love and dancing.
If God were not constantly present in
each of our lives, there would be no
point in giving him a name. God isn't a
bearded old man who rules the world
from afar. He is among us, within each
of us. That's why fanaticism, intoler¬
ance and social exclusion are all insults
to the divine. The divine is unity. To my
mind, Islam answers that yearning for
unicity, union and simplicity. Islam is a
religion which is thoroughly integrated
with the cosmos, a religion where every
daily act is marked by a belief in indivi¬
sion, where the practice of the sacred
is daily and constant. But all religions
are linked to the divine. They are all of
equal worth when we practise them
with faith and purity, and when we
strive to discover our divine essence
through them.
I try to make an offering
of serenity and unity.

The French-born dancer and
choreographer Maurice Béjart
is one of the great creative
figures of modern dance. The
hallmark of his ballets, from
Symphonie pour un homme
seif J (1955) to Nijinsky, Clown
of God (19%), has been a
rejection of aestheticism in
favour of dance as a universal
language and total theatre.
Here he talks about some of
the themes that frequently
crop up in his work.
Does the theme of the androgyne,
which recurs again and again in your
ballets, refer to that notion of unity,
the unity of an absolute human being
before division?
M. B.: Precisely. Obviously it's absurd
and unnatural to try and argue in favour
of some supposed superiority of man
over woman, or vice versa. The world is
inseparably male and female. It is sheer
madness to want one half to commit
genocide on the other. Man can do
nothing without woman, and woman
nothing without man. In the beginning
of time, their union existed within a
single body. This theme has always
obsessed poets, writers and painters.
Honoré de Balzac's masterpiece
Sêraphita treats that myth, in which
oppositcs identify with and espouse one
another. This is the vital principle of
complementarity between yin and yang,
and the constant resonance between the
female and male poles that are in all of
us. Separation of the two is a wound
which we try to heal through artistic
expression. The essential thing is whole¬
ness, union and identity, not division.
M Why are you so attracted to the Far
East, and especially to Japan?
M. B.: I'm drawn to the whole of Asia.
It's a continent that contains the origins
of our past and of all the great religions:
Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Bud¬
dhism, Hinduism, Shintoism. Asia con¬
sists of three and a half billion men and
women, who form a mosaic of peoples,
languages and skills. But it is also the
centre of tomorrow's technological
developments. Asia will be the third
millennium's centre of gravity.
Then there is my personal experi¬
ence of the Ear East. I was taught by a
great Japanese master of Zen, and many
of my (lancers are Japanese. But I have
also been deeply influenced by India
and Iran. I'm of mixed blood. My
maternal grandmother was Kurdish, my
maternal grandfather Catalan, and my
paternal grandmother Breton. I have
roots all over the world. I'm a nomad
and feel at home wherever I am. I don't
live anywhere. Wherever I go, I just
pitch my tent, then set off somewhere
else. But aren't we all made up of a
patchwork of cultures?
Your father once said: 'Space is
more real than time'. That seems
to be a theme that runs through your
work.
M. B.: We live in space, we project our¬
selves into it, we inhabit it. Time, on the
contrary, is something which inhabits
us; and it slowly destroys us. It grows
iij) and grows old with us. Time is the
heart, with its relentless tick-tock beat.
Space, on the other hand, exists only

Béjart
ofinit
through objects. And we are an object
like any other in that space like that
car over there in the car park, or that
tree in front of me. Dance enables us to
sculpt the space surrounding us, to
structure it. As long as we live in the
present tense. The present is linear,
serene and pure. The present is time
that has become eternity.
You create your ballets intuitively.
The body creates the substance of your
figures, and the scenery is often
reduced to a few lines in space.
M. B.: Yes, first comes a corporeal intu¬
ition, which forms a canvas. But after
that I need to work on the idea for a
very long time. For some ballets, I gath¬
ered material for two years and read
hundreds of books. Ultimately, intuition
and knowledge go hand in hand. The
dancers themselves also suggest figures
to me as they project their bodies into
space or inform them with certain
rhythms. The architecture of dance is
transparent, helping it to achieve grace
and escape its material trappings.
Modern dance means the end of an arti¬
ficial aestheticism tacked on from the
outside. It still makes technical
demands, but aims to be increasingly
expressionistic and energetic. The torso
is as bare as an unfurled sail; the gaze is
more intense; the arms, which are also
bare, suggest the flight of the body
more effectively. Classical dance con¬
cealed the dancers' bodies beneath
tulle and embroidery. Today the flesh
reveals itself; it glorifies impulses and
passions that would have caused a
scandal in the past. If Nijinsky shocked
the bourgeoisie, it was because the por¬
trayal of ecstasy had hitherto been
regarded as obscene. With him it
became maieutic, a catharsis to be
shared with the public. Dance is now a
ceremony of sharing, of participation.
So how does Saturday night
dancing in nightclubs fit in?
M. B.: Nightclubs are ersatz. They are
an artificial substitute, like the ersatz
coffee we drank during the war instead
of real coffee, the ersatz bread we ate
instead of real bread. Human beings
need dance. But since it no longer exists
in its truly ritual context, since there
are no longer popular get-togethers in
village squares or in churches, where
people used to join hands so that they
could open their hearts, since we have
deprived ourselves of these simple, pow¬
erful joys, we make do with Saturday
night revels. Human beings lose a cer¬
tain dimension of their presence in the
world if they are deprived of dance. Sat¬
urday night substitutes are obviously
"anti-dances", yet in a very diluted way
they do remain a form of dance a way
of releasing natural forces and sensing
one's body, which during the previous
week has been little more than an
empty husk dragged from one seat to
another, from office to car to home. Sat¬
urday night dances are full of sweat,
drink, desire, high jinks and hidden
exultation. I'm not sure what they all
add up to, but they are necessary to
people's psychological equilibrium.
People dance at times of ceremony,
but also at times of crisis.
M. B.: Times of ceremony are becoming
less frequent. There are fewer and
fewer festivals and more and more holi¬
days. Festivals were rituals, and were
accompanied by dances and communion.
Holidays are no more than an empty
moment in life a mechanical, robot
like period of rest during which indi¬
viduals are even more divided and even
more separated from their bodies, from
others, from the cosmos.
In your ballets there are often
disjointed bodies which seem to suffer
as though they were giving birth or
emerging from a chrysalis.
M. B.: In some ballets, such as Pyra¬
mide, I prefer more rounded body
movements, with less rhythmic disrup¬
tion. But sometimes one needs to man¬
handle harmony and aim for a daring,
baroque visual effect, with lopsided
movements, twisted bodies, jerky ges¬
tures and arms that seem to reach up
for some impossible flight. Human
beings will always be tempted to follow
Icarus, because they are like Sisyphus.
We are all temporarily blind as we move
from one threshold of our lives to the
next, straining towards the eternal light.
It is that initiatory journey which I
portray on stage. Some dance figures
show a man unfurling himself after
nestling on his mother's lap. Dancers seek
their point d'appui in a geometry that is
at once pure and baroque, where lines are
broken and movements sometimes clash
so as to show the dislocation of the world.
Habit is a terrible straitjacket which I've
always sought to destroy. As a result of
habit, we can no longer see, smell, hear or
sense. I try to show births, to write "the
gospel of universal harmony" that Niet¬
zsche talked about. Modern dance has, I
believe, the ability to tune in directly to
the earth and to humankind. Thus,
ballet's quality of poetic celebration can
temporarily dispel the misfortune of the
modern individual. That miracle is pos¬
sible because the individual possesses all
the components of his or her illumination
and metamorphosis. Dance does no more
than reveal them.
And communication is achieved.
The public is caught up in that
We are all temporarily blind as we move from one
threshold of our lives to the next, straining towards the
eternal light.

empathy where those who dance and
those who watch, the mobile and the
immobile, become one.
M. B.: Theatre is about watching and
being watched. It's about a child who
dances or acts out a La Fontaine fable
for its mother. It's that kind of contact,
and nothing else.
You're fascinated by kabuki. Is it
because it's a complete art, whose
components include make-up, words,
theatre and philosophy?
M. B.: Yes, I like complete theatrical
forms. In Greek tragedy, the chorus sang
and danced, the actors mimed, acted
and spoke. The kabuki actor is a great
dancer and a profound thinker. He
shows us the ineffable, the point at
which divisive thinking is stopped in its
tracks and replaced by unifying silence.
I am in love with unity. I work for the
unity of human beings, who are torn
apart because their bodies, souls and
minds never have time to come together.
Art must provide them with an opportu¬
nity for that union, so they can counter
the daily threat of disintegration.
The Rite of Spring (1988).
Choreography by Maurice Béjart.
You say we need myths.
M. B.: Myths are not of secondary
importance. They are central to our
being and therefore to our art. No civi¬
lization can do without myths. Ours has
tried and failed. Myths are phoenixes
which always rise from their ashes
transformed and travestied, but
eternal. They are a compost of eternity
which tells the modern generation
about the gods of the distant past.
Myths are human beings who sheathe
themselves in a superior skin, become
invulnerable, travel down the centuries
and transport themselves from one
point to another in time and space, but
remain, with all their strengths and
weaknesses, utterly human. The divine
and the demoniac rub shoulders within
human beings. That is their permanent
duel. But they need that duel to
emerge from nothingness, just as they
need myths, icons and glimpses of a
superior world to give their existence a
name. Myths form the foundation on
which people can shape themselves and
find their creative energies. Dance
sculpts those myths on stage, live, and
in front of audiences who will make
that metamorphosis an integral part of
their daily lives and a way out towards
higher things.
I work for the unity of human beings,
who are torn apart because their bodies, souls
and minds never have time to come together.

MANAGING SOCIAL CHANGE
Unksco's Management of Social Transforma¬
tions (MOST) programme, which lias been
operational since January 1994, is designed to
promote international comparative research in
th<! social sciences. Its primary emphasis is to
support large-scale autonomous research, to
transfer data to decision-makers and to
encourage capacity-building. MOST operates
in three high-priority areas of social transfor¬
mation: cities; multicultural and multi-ethnic
societies; and the effects of global changes at
local and regional levels. This year, in associa¬
tion with Unksco's Man and the Biosphere
(MAB) programme, it is launching a six-year
programme on "Cities: management of social
and environmental transformations".
The Most Newsletter, which is published
quarterly in English, French and Spanish, pro¬
vides information on the programme's activities

PLANET SOCIETY
Young people from 35 countries are taking
part in UlNKSCo's Planet Society Programme
which is seeking to set up a worldwide
exchange network to contribute to the sus¬
tainable management of the planet. The Pro¬
gramme's first campaign, launched at the end
of 1994, is called "The World's Still in the
Making". It aims to encourage 6- to 15-ycar-
olds to initiate and take part in local projects
to develop their community's natural and cul¬
tural environment. Planet Society has already
set up a New Projects Data Bank containing
data from projects submitted by children and
has created an Exchange Market to enable
children to exchange resources, ideas, experi¬
ences, funds, aid and materials. An Informa¬
tion and Communication Service serves as an
intermediary between the Exchange Market,
the general public and the media. I

A PRIZE FOR TOLERANCE
AND NON-VIOLENCE
The UNESCO Madanjeet Singh Prize, which has
been created on the occasion of the United
Nations Year for Tolerance and the 125th
anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, is
to be awarded biennially (beginning this year)
to individuals, institutions or organizations who
make outstanding contributions to the promo¬
tion of tolerance and non-violence and to the
families of intellectuals who, like Mahatma
Gandhi, are victims of intolerance. The win¬
ners will he selected by the Director-General
of UiNHSCO on the basis of recommendations
made by an international jury. Candidates will
be nominated by U.MiSCO Member States and
intergovernmental and non-governmental orga¬
nizations with consultative status with
U.NKSCO. Prize-winners will receive $40,000.
The donor, Mr. Madanjeet Singh, is a well-
known writer, painter and photographer who
is special advisor to the Director-General of
Unksco.
1995 LITERACY AWARDS
On International Literacy Day, 8 September
1995, the Director-General of Ul\KSt:o, Mr.
Federico Mayor, presented ihe three interna¬
tional prizes awarded by UrsKSCO for literacy
work.
The "Community Academic Services Pro¬
gram" of Canada's New Brunswick province,
whose network of free literacy and elementary
education services has obtained outstanding
results, was awarded the International Heading
Association Literacy Award.
The Noma Prize went to the Family Wel¬
fare Movement (PKK I'embinaan Kese-
jahterann-Kelnarga) of Indonesia for pro¬
moting the mobilization of community mem¬
bers, especially women, and reducing poverty
by integrating functional literacy into income-
generating programmes.
The King Sejong Literacy Prize was pre¬
sented to joint winners: the All-China Women's
Federation for its literacy work among women,
especially in rural areas, in a country where
women constitute 70 per cent of the illiterate
population; and to Ecuador's Pilot Literacy,
Post-Literacy and Training Project for the
improvement of the Quality of Life of Rural
Women (PKOCALMUC).
EXPOLANGUESA WINDOW ON WORLD
LANGUAGES AND CULTURES
Expolangucs, the annual Paris Fair devoted to
the study and use of languages and the dis¬
covery of world cultures, highlights a different
country each year. Turkey has been chosen for
special attention at this year's Fair, which will
be held from 15 to 19 February in the Grande
Halle de la Villette. Msitors to Expolangucs will
have an opportunity to familiarize themselves
with the latest language teaching techniques
and to learn about other cultures via song, dance
and theatre. This year sees the inauguration of
a competition and a special award for transla¬
tors and interpreters. Among those taking part
in Expolangucs will be the UXRSCO Courier and
its 30 language editions. H

NOTICE
You may have been surprised (and, we hope, gratified) to
receive two examples of our 8-page photo supplement "50
years of Unesco", in the November and December issues
respectively. The colour reproduction on the paper used in
the supplement inserted in the November issue was poor.
The paper in question was chosen by our printer, who in
view of the result later decided to reprint the supplement
on more suitable paper at his own expense and insert it in
the following number. This explanation should have
appeared in last month's Issue. We hope readers will
accept our apologies for publishing it a month late and
that the mystery is now solved.

2. Daniel Williams of the Washington Post
discussed the significance of this piece of news in
an article entitled, "An Old Heresy Finds a
Receptive Audience in the Catholic Church"
(International Herald Tribune, 3 November 1995).
"Is it possible to speak of 'revelation' in other [i.e. non-Christian] religions?" asked
an article published in a recent issue of the Jesuit journal La C'mltà Cafto/zca1. The
answer appeared to be yes. In other words, the voice of God is heard in other sacred
writings than the Bible.
Perhaps not everyone will grasp the full significance of this viewpoint. Yet it
marks a real break with a tradition that runs through the history of the revealed reli¬
gions. It is true that a few great thinkers down the ages have dared to express such
thoughts, in some cases risking their lives to do so. More recently, attempts to pro¬
mote a rapprochement between religions have been based on the same premise, but
never until now has it been endorsed in a journal close to the Holy See?.
There has always been a very strong temptation for the authorized interpreters
of each of the revealed religions to consider themselves the sole repositories of the
divine message, even though they may argue among themselves about its exact
meaning. All too often this has sown discord between different religious communi¬
ties, each one claiming to be the only defender of God's true word. This situation
exists today in many societies in the throes of crisis, where an extremist interpre¬
tation of a religious message can be used to mobilize and intensify the passions
unleashed by a community's quest for identity.
This is why the article in La C'mltà CattoUca should be welcomed. In acknowl¬
edging that all the world's great religions have access to revelation it accords equal
dignity to all their followers, i.e. equal rights to respect and to a hearing. It is thus
consistent with an intellectual approach that advocates in all fields, not only that of
religion, open-mindedness and fraternity in opposition to the tyranny of exclusive
truths: a higher spirit that unites people and the world against the divisions and
afflictions of sectarianism.
Something of this spirit informs the pages of the present issue devoted to dance.
Readers may even feel that some of this month's contributors, such as Maurice
Béjart, help to explain its mystery.

Modern people have a paradoxical rela¬
tionship with space. They may have
reached to the stars, explored the ocean
depths and fathomed the unfathomable, but
they have also cut themselves off from their
environment and the forces around them.
They abandon the earth and risk becoming
rootless, "extra-terrestrial" creatures. Long
gone are the days when, as peasants, they had

physical contact with the land. Today, high on
their tractors, they have become human
machines. Long gone are the days when, as
navigators, they were at one with wind and
water. Today, as they wing peacefully, com¬
fortably and hygenically from continent to
continent, they have lost touch with the
dream of Icarus.
They have hardly any active contact with
10

the elements, with matter, or even with
gravity. In their daily lives they do less and
less of the things that once linked them to the
world. Once upon a time they were used to
walking; they strode up hill and down dale.
Today, in lifts, escalators, cars and trains,
movement is levelled. Many once-familiar
physical actions beating, hammering,
pounding, grinding and wood-turning are
now done by machines.
Various kinds of recreation compensate
for this loss. Some, such as funfairs with
swings, Ferris wheels and roller-coasters, are
not new. More recent forms of diversion
include sporting activities such as jogging,
skiing, water-skiing, surfing, windsurfing and
hang-gliding, virtually all of which are marred
by the spirit of competition.
A ritual act
Today people tolerate their bodies, reluc¬
tantly accept their weight and maltreat their
vertebrae (although some civilizations still
teach the art of sitting). They may become

restless as they passively consume sounds
and images, but they avoid real movement.
What about dancers? Once upon a time,
like peasants and sailors, they were in tune
with earth and sky, with seasonal activities, the
lunar month, the weather, and the rhythms of
life. But as traditional farm work disappears,
this kind of dancing is also dying out, and so
too is dancing as a form of festivity.
Since the beginning of the century, how¬
ever, new dance forms have appeared that
seek to revive the time-honoured relation¬
ships between people, their bodies and the
natural world. Today, as part of the globaliza¬
tion process, dance more than any other form
of expression is an area of exchange and under¬
standing where East, West, North and South
are meeting, not without incident, perhaps,
but with growing enthusiasm. Why is this so?
Dance testifies that people belong to the
universe and its profundities: gravity, silence
and sanctity. Even when performed outside
sacred precincts, it is full of ritual meaning.
Performance is a rite whose preparation,
rehearsal and production is a communion.
Ritual is inherent in an activity that estab¬
lishes a special relationship between dancer
and teacher, during a time of awakening and
initiation. Dance is a rite in which the body is

and Choreographic Education of

listened to and cared for, calling to mind the
ancient idea of the body as a temple.
A dancing body establishes a relationship
with the universe and becomes a point of
contact with energies, forces and flows. In its
extreme affirmation of verticality it points the
way to ecstasy.
Dancers do not take leave of their senses.
On the contrary, they use their senses with
great subtlety not only the so-called objec¬
tive senses of sight and hearing but also the
subjective senses, especially touch, by which
they make contact with the physical world.
Dancers are physically normal people
who stand apart from the passivity of
everyday life and the tension of sporting
achievement. They occupy the middle
ground between the interior and the exte¬
rior; they commune. They compete neither
with themselves nor with others. Dancing
together in a group is only possible if there is
harmony. Dancers discover space in a state
of rapture that is not far from the rapture of
the soul.
The element of dance is empty space; its
instrument is the human body. There is no
need for words, colours, earth, stone or
wood. Dance lives in the present tense. Its
life is one of loss and renewal. It vanishes and
reappears. The dancer, the only begetter of
the dance, is mortal. The body ages and one
day will rot. Dance has no Stradivariuses, and
there are no museums of ancient dance
instruments. Constantly reinventing them¬
selves, intoxicated with perfection, dancers
throw themselves headlong into their art.
Art in the present tense
The repository of the dance tradition is mainly
the body and the spoken word. Knowledge is
transmitted by one-to-one contact between
master and pupil. The camera and written
notation are useful tools, but they can never
replace the moment of transmission, the
unique instant of sublime pleasure when the
core of a movement is communicated like a
secret to a child or an adult. The dance master
is something of a shaman.
The essence of dance is rarity, quality
rather than quantity, being rather than having.
The way to perfection lies through
learning by repetition, a long apprenticeship
whereby a movement is rarefied from ordi¬
nariness into dance. Dancers do what anyone
can do, but the way in which they do it makes
their dance different and unique.
They are transformed by their efforts.
They embody in concentrated form all the
movements of the plant and animal kingdoms.
They are trees whose roots move; they are
fish and birds. Tall moving trees, tall earth-
bound birds, they progress through space
horizontally and vertically, like great moving
crosses.
But the inner movement of dance is silent.
Except in the rare cases where body sounds
are heard hammering feet, clapping hands,
snapping fingers it is a movement that
emerges from silence and the void. Breathing
provides its inner resonance.
The embodiment of harmony between
earth and heaven, the physical and the meta¬
physical, high and low, dark and light, the
expressible and the inexpressible, dancers are
enraptured and enrapture those who watch
them. What they create is as dazzling and tran¬
sient as a flash of lightning. The dancer has and
is a sacred fire. H

the group. At these times, dance dramatizes
the often diffuse power relationships on
which the group is based, even if it does not
put its members on equal terms.
When it dances, society functions like a
body. Like the individual body, the social
body has its needs that must be recognized
and satisfied in good time. Dance restores its
fluidity, encourages its members to circulate,
and reveals its physical condition, its vitality
and resilience. The dancers who take part in
the Shrove Tuesday carnival held each year at
Binche in Belgium, dress up in their heavy
feather costumes at four o'clock in the
morning and have to dance to a punishing
tambourine beat for three days. Here we are
not far from voodoo trances or ritual Indian
dances experiences in which dance com¬
municates with the invisible and flirts with
the unsayable.
Grape-pickers and harvesters would
never dream of taking leave of each other
without holding a dance to celebrate harvest
home, thank the gods, commune with the
elements and promise to meet again. Outside
the family, social or ethnic context, dancing to
celebrate national holidays is an avenue to the
universal.
Dance is not so much an aspiration to
defeat the laws of gravity as a desire to be at
one with the harmony of the spheres. Singly,
in couples or in groups, dancers always
express more than is strictly required by the
occasion that brings them together. They
tread beyond the bounds of real time and
space. Pan is not dead; he has become a punk
or a rapper.

such thing as a dance of despair. This is why
humanity's immediate reaction to events is to
dance. It may be a dangerous thing to do. It

may be playing with fire. But in communicating
with one another it is the alpha and the omega.
Dance, rather than the written and spoken
word, is the language of the soul. To dance is



to take the pulse of the world and become
attuned to its rhythm. Dance means listening
to others, acknowledging the existence of
common ground.
All human society is based on this principle.
Dance is a leitmotif of private and family life, of
religious and social life. It is a crossroads of
meeting and exchange between the irrational
and the rational. Whenever men and women
get together and dance, they save from extinc¬
tion and standardization the untamed side of
human nature that is indispensable to our sur¬
vival. To dance is to refuse the paralysis of con¬
formity and to rediscover the essence of
democracy: diversity, potentiality, and freedom
of movement.

drama :s
hidden
depths
by Eugenio Barba
In African and Latin American cultures
dance is the vehicle that brings human
beings close to the gods. While the gods do
not necessarily dance themselves, dance is
the elusive area, on the border of the physical
and the spiritual worlds, in which their force
is expressed.
Theatre belongs to the same order. The
French actor and director Jacques Copeau,
who was, with Konstanin Stanislavsky, one of
the leading innovators of twentieth-century
drama, believed that dance is the essence of
drama. Surprising though it may seem, there
are many reasons to think that this is so.
In the art of corporeal expression, the dis¬
tinction made between dance and theatre is a

The choreography, by Ivo
Cramer, was inspired by

product of certain fairly recent European
conventions. It did not exist in ancient Greek
and Roman theatre, in medieval or Eliza¬
bethan theatre, or in commedia dell'arte. Nor
does it exist in the classic forms of Asian the¬
atre. It is ignored by actors in their practice of
stagecraft. Actors all dance, although their
dance is sometimes concealed from the audi¬
ence by their acting.
Nor is dance "naturally" dependent on
music. The author of an anonymous Italian
pamphlet against carnivals that appeared four
centuries ago (Discorso contro il carnevale,
1607) condemned dance out of hand. To illus¬
trate what he regarded as the diabolical nature
of dance, he suggests that one should look at a
roomful of men and women dancing and
then suddenly pretend that one can no longer
hear the music. Observe the artificial move¬
ments, he says. Note the contortions the
people make as they touch each another, take
each other by the hand, lean towards each
other, search for each other and lose each
other. Do they look like civilized men and

women? No, they are grotesque, jerky,
affected or obscene. One might think they
are mad. Unbeknownst to themselves, they
are in the hands of the devil. . . .
Let us take this idea of switching off the
music a little further. I think it is an excellent
exercise for directors and actors. What hap¬
pens? If dance only gives rise to forced, exag¬
gerated movements, it is not the kind of
dance that springs naturally from the body
but an attempt to apply a veneer of music to
the body. When dance bubbles up from the
body, it contains its own music. It does not
matter whether the music is silent or whether
it really provides delectation for the ear.
The living body
A performer trained in a classical Asian tradi¬
tion who dances without music loses none of
his or her inwardness and ability to captivate
the spectator. Add music, singing, the poetry
of words and the fantasy of a story-line and
the display becomes richer and more com¬
plete, a feast in which the spectator tastes only
a little of each dish. But even in the midst of
this, profusion, the performance retains its
force and vitality by virtue of its inner naked¬
ness.
This observation can be applied to any
dancers, whatever their origin or training,
who can find within themselves the music
most appropriate to their physical action
the music of the body. This is not formal
dance; but the dance of the body that has
come to life. The word life is not used gratu¬
itously; it means presence, purely and simply.
It is neither expression nor communication,
but it makes both possible; it is inherent in
each. It is what I call in my research on the
anthropology of theatre, the "pre-expres-
sive" level.
And so even if there is a dividing line
between theatre and dance today, it is not her¬
metic. On the contrary, there are many points
of contact between the two. Theatre and dance
form one vast territory, which can be explored
both from the viewpoint of the geographer
interested in neighbourhoods, crossroads and

panoramas and from that of the geologist who
wants to explore the underground layers
common to regions which are superficially
divided and differentiated.
It is the geologist's approach that interests
me.
In all actors I look for the hidden dance
that gives intensity to their presence. I try to
discover the undulations of rhythm, of pow¬
erful action harboured in the depths of their
bodies, even if they barely make any move¬
ment, if they are seemingly motionless and
their behaviour is apparently quite "normal".
When actors conceal the violence and
energy that infuse life into their stage pres¬
ence, even if they do not dance overtly
something dances within them. Without this
hidden dance, their acting is not authentic.
For an actor, acting is not a matter of pre¬
tence. Acting is only real when it involves the
whole body, when the slightest movement is
rooted in the torso, not in a part of the body
such as the hands, the eyes or the mouth, and
springs from the unity of body and mind.
This integrity, this unity of the living organism
is what I call "dance".
When the hidden dance ceases to be latent
and expresses itself freely in space, then
rhythm, drums and music are required to
create a dialogue.
Shakespeare,
Verdi and candomblé
I should like to give an example from my
own experience. Recently I worked for
some time with a modern Brazilian dancer
and choreographer who is also closely con¬
nected with the dances and ceremonies of the
Afro-Brazilian candomblé cult. We decided
that we would bring our two cultures into
contact but not attempt to blend them. I
come from the villages of southern Italy,
where on festive occasions brass bands play
tunes or overtures from operas by Verdi,
Puccini, Donizetti or Bellini.
We staged a one-man show which juxta¬
posed the theme of Verdi's Otello, based on
Shakespeare's play, with the stories and figures

of the Orisha, the gods of candomblé, who are
summoned by drums. The orchestra played
Verdi and the drums were beaten. The story
of the Moor of Venice alternated with the
invasion of the higher forces which take pos¬
session of him.
To some extent I wanted to go back to one
of the traditional interpretations of Othello:
the man resplendent as night who bears
within himself both the forces of the forest
and those of the elegant city built on water,
and who derives his charm and destructive
power from their imbrication. Of course I
also wanted the audience to understand that
there is no unbridgeable gap between the cul¬
ture that produces Othello and that which
produces the terreiro, the candomblé ritual
in which drums summon the gods.
But on an even more personal level I was
trying to show what I see whenever I observe
an actor or an actress who can reach down to
the sources of life when on stage. It doesn't
really matter whether they are acting in a
comedy or a tragedy as soon as attention
moves towards their bodies I can feel the
beating of life.
All I have to do is release myself from the
grip of words and plot, facial mimicry and hand
gestures, and concentrate on watching what the
actor or actress is doing with his or her body. I
see nothing but the dance concealed beneath
the veneer of theatricality. The dragon of life
surfaces from the depths, expresses itself in
ways that are by turns barely perceptible and
violently explosive. It is then that I know that
drama, with or without music, is dance.
Let us remember what happened on stage
in Shakespeare's time. At the end of the
grimmest play, after reducing to ashes the
audience's illusions about the great ones of
this world and revealing the bestiality that
lurks beneath the noble words of knights,
after showing how love can be a bitter
struggle, Shakespeare's actors would sud¬
denly abandon their fictional characters and
begin to dance to the lively rhythm of a gigue.
At that moment, perhaps the scales would fall
from the eyes of at least one member of the
audience who would realize that the actors
had, in spite of all appearances to the contrary,
been dancing all through the play.
19

Nijinsky
On 19 January 1919, in a Swiss hotel, a
dancer dressed in white silk pyjamas
advanced towards an audience of some two



hundred people. The career of Vaslav Nijinsky,
the century's greatest dancer, would shortly
end. Thirty years of mental illness would follow.
As if to signal the catatonic immobility that
^was about to claim him, Nijinsky made a
strange, simple gesture that symbolically
opened dance to the modern world. He
grabbed a chair, sat down facing the audience
and stared at them. The nervousness that elec¬
trified the dancer passed in a hypnotic current,
and the magic of empathy swept over the audi¬
ence. When the pianist began a Chopin pre¬
lude, Nijinsky moved. He began to improvise
a mystical ballet, a kind of requiem, a pacifist
message in the wake of the First World War.
"Overcome by the war, he placed on the
floor a cross made of cloth, then danced on it to
signify the crime that had been committed
against humanity." This, the "combat of life and
death", was Nijinsky's last ballet, the day of
what he called his "marriage with God".
The rebel
On the verge of madness, Nijinsky laid bare his
soul in the diary that he wrote in six weeks and
took with him to the asylum. He insisted that it
should be published.1
The French dramatist and actor Antonin
Artaud called the diary an "exorcism", a cry of
anger, "a metaphysic of word, gesture and
expression", the savage pleasure of scraping off
a veneer of varnish. Since Nijinsky's spectac¬
ular leaps had not taken him beyond the con¬
fines of the stage, since people were incorri¬
gibly worldly and artificial, he would teach
them a lesson or two. He would shake them
up. He was a man of extremes who had long
before broken out of the straitjacket of his cen¬
tury, its bourgeois conventionality and its
numbing, blinding aestheticism. "I don't want
war. I don't want state borders," he wrote. His
choreography, his expressionism and his life all
broke the mould: "My madness is love for
humanity." An ecologist before the word
existed, he felt that humanity was abusing the
earth. "The planet is falling apart," he wrote.
"The earth is suffocating. People are covering it
with ashes."

*"

by Martine Leca The greatest dancer ofhis time was
a soul in torment
Nijinsky was born into a family of Polish
dancers, brought up in Russia, and worked in
France. Not surprisingly, his Russian was pep¬
pered with Polish and French expressions.
This explains the jagged structure of his writing,
whose raw, direct, expressionistic language has
much in common with his "wild, savage"
dancing. What was important for him was not
phrase-making but "transcribing thought". His
diary is a song, an invitation to all humanity. It is
like Gregorian chant sung in guttural tones. "I
am not a revolver; I am God, I am love."
Nijinsky's work as a dancer and choreogra¬
pher spanned ten years. It was hallmarked by
four ballets which gave birth to contemporary
dance: Debussy's L'Après-midi d'un faune,
Stravinsky's The Rite ofSpring, Debussy'sjeux
and Richard Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel.
Under the leadership of Sergei Diaghilev,
creator and grand master of the Ballet Russe,
and later away from Diaghilev's thrall, Nijinsky
took humanity back to essentials, to its pagan
traditions. Tight embroidered costumes gave
way to looser blouses. What mattered for
Nijinsky, inspired as he was by the Greek tra¬
dition, was "to act as little and feel as much as
possible". Dance was to express inner feelings,
to reveal the inner person.
Once the mould of academic dance was
broken, the day of the nineteenth-century
conventions was over. The music of Debussy
and Stravinsky was an extension of the revolu¬
tion in gesture that would be brought about by
concrete dance. Stravinsky regarded Nijinsky
as the only dancer who could put his music to
movement, a performer who made direct
contact with the audience, had no qualms
about moving against the beat or the tempo,
and rejected aesthetics in favour of expres¬
sionism. Nijinsky was not afraid to translate
into sometimes disjointed movements and
positions the violence that impelled him. After
centuries of imprisonment in ornament and
posturing, body and soul began to speak in the
new vocabulary of dance. Nijinksy tore
romantic smoothness to shreds with his
chaotic and violent rhythms.
The key moment in this revolution was the
performance of The Rite of Spring in Paris on
23 May 1913, which caused a sensation and trig¬
gered a head-on clash between the "old guard"
and the "avant-garde". Nijinsky's innovations
were profound. They sounded the death-knell
of the romantic aesthetic.
The masks of the human comedy were
torn away. Nijinsky asked dancers to transcend
themselves, forcing them to adopt difficult
positions. His choreographic language, which
was more easily described in drawings than in
words, was almost unperformable and puzzled
more than one dancer. "I had a hard time
learning my role by mechanically imitating the
positions he showed me," wrote ballerina
Tamara Karsavina. "I had to keep my neck
twisted to one side and my hands folded back
on themselves, as if I had been born crippled."
The bombshell
This abandonment of traditional form, mixed
with Debussy's impressionistic and Stravinsky's
violent music, made a high-powered avant-
garde cocktail that was bound to arouse strong
feelings. The bombshell of The Rite of Spring
sparked off a revolt against vapidity, subtlety,
chiaroscuro, elegance and refined harmonics.
Nijinsky challenged the established author¬
ities and lifted life and feelings to a more spa¬
cious realm of freedom and creation. His
dancing signalled a return to the primitive magic
of rhythm and a systematic simplification of
construction accompanied by a determination
to do away with hierarchies and privileges.
After The Rite of Spring Nijinsky showed
his taste for independence in another pio¬
neering ballet, Jeux, in which four dancers
obey a quadrangular geometry. "Nijinsky has
given a strangely mathematical twist to his way¬
ward genius," Debussy noted.
His genius cast a huge shadow over the
century and today's dancers and choreogra¬
phers follow in his wake. Nijinsky wanted to
have done with the ballet as a spectacle. He
wanted to bring the audience into contact with
the birth-throes of reality, the fluctuations of
the inner life and the leap towards the absolute.
He brought to an end the day of trompc-l'oeil
and art that copied reality. The eyes of the audi¬
ence became part of the action. The depths of
consciousness began to stir.

JOCHEN SCHMIDT,
German writer and journalist, is
artistic director of the

Deutschland ("Dance Theatre in

documentary film on Pina Bausch.
"Post-modern" must be the hardest
term to define in the world of dance.
The notion of "modern dance" was already
unpopular enough, and Martha Graham, for
instance, never accepted it as a description of
her art. But at least we knew what it meant
a form of stage dancing that was created in the
early twentieth century and broke with the
rules of classical ballet.
Very few people have any idea what the
term "post-modern dance", which made its
appearance in American dance literature in
the late 1970s, actually means. To my mind,
the best definition of it was given by the
choreographer Alvin Ailey some years ago at
a press conference. "Post-modern dance?"
he said. "Easy. It means dance after Merce
Cunningham." This seems to denote no
more than a time frontier, but in fact the term
describes the position of not just one but sev¬
eral generations of choreographers in relation
to the American dance genius of the second
half of the century. They have either taken up
the torch handed on by Cunningham or
rebelled against his style and aesthetic.
For America this makes sense but prob¬
ably not for Europe. It is true that Cun
ningham has been extremely influential in
France since the 1960s and has inspired many
young choreographers. But in France and
almost everywhere else in Europe, in the last
fifteen years at least, the influence of the
German choreographer Pina Bausch has
been stronger than Cunningham's.
Many new forms and trends
Of course, Pina Bausch herself is not free
from foreign influences. She was trained in
Essen and at the Julliard School of Music in
New York. However, there is more to post¬
modernism than the "dance theatre" which
she created in the 1970s and which became a
style model all over the world.
The fact is that contemporary dance has
no stylistic and aesthetic unity; it is a highly
complex edifice with many rooms, all fur¬
nished differently. It cannot be limited to
post-modern American dance, which
encompasses the pale neo-classicism of
Karole Armitage as well as the early mini¬
malist exercises of Trisha Brown, or to Euro¬
pean dance theatre, whose variants in Ger¬
many and France, Belgium and Spain differ
widely from one another.

Contemporary
dance finds
inspiration all
over the world
There are many other trends in contem¬
porary dance as well as these two major cur¬
rents. A list of them would include Japanese
Butô (see article page 27), and choreogra¬
phers such as Saburo Teshigawara who have
tried to go further than Butô; the first, occa¬
sionally timid, but highly fertile and deter¬
mined excursions of non-Western cultures
into modern dance, e.g. the alchemy with
which Lin Hwai-min in Taiwan has fused the
Chinese tradition and Western dance tech¬
niques; the démythification of Indian dance
by Chandralekha in Madras; the revolu¬
tionary blend of Indian Bharata Natyam
dance and Western music created by
Shobana Jeyasingh in London; African dance
as performed by Irène Tassembedo and her
Ebene group from Burkina Faso; and the
opening of traditional dance forms of Aus¬
tralian Aborigines to contemporary themes
by the Aboriginal and Islander Dance The¬
atre and the Bangara Group in Sydney.
Dancing on turf, earth and water
This variety of contemporary dance, which
is not even remotely covered by the label of
post-modernism, is such that it is hard to
predict how dance will develop. At the same
time it gives grounds for hope that when one
form or another runs out of steam the devel¬
opment of dance will not come to a standstill.

Whatever happens, however, the free¬
doms won by the two dominant figures of
recent decades, Merce Cunningham and
Pina Bausch, are sustainable acquisitions that
will shape the future of dance. In Cun¬
ningham's case they include the abolition of
the one-dimensional perspective and its
replacement by an open, spatial view which
corresponds in a sense to the world-view of
modern physics. Bausch has raised the possi¬
bility of turning every human movement,
however banal or routine (including the
spoken word and singing) into choreography
and of abandoning the classic dance stage in
favour of more natural surfaces such as turf,
earth and even water.

In future, there will be more and more
dance pieces that will not be designed for the
traditional theatre stage but for theatre in the
round; more and more pieces in which the
dancers speak and sing when movement
alone is not enough to explain their action;
more and more pieces that are not dedicated
to a single dance code (such as the Martha
Graham style or the José Limon technique);
and many others in which mastery of con¬
ventional dance movements will not even be
essential. It does not interest us here whether
aquatic ballets in swimming pools and aerial
ballets in which the dancers climb up and
abseil down walls are an aesthetic fad or rep¬
resent genuine artistic progress. The fact is
that they exist and are likely to become more
widespread in the future. Falling Angels [1383),

A list of the ways in which modern
Western dance has fused with non-European
dance forms may give the impression that
Western style is increasingly influencing
dance in non-Western cultures via a modern
form of cultural colonialism. That impression
is not totally incorrect, but in dance aesthetic
influence is not a one-way street. Dance styles
from outside Europe are increasingly gaining
ground in the West. African and Asian dance
forms are being transplanted to the West by
migrants from those continents to their new
homes in the West, and today a European or
an American who wants to see authentic
African or Asian dance does not necessarily
have to travel to Africa or fly to Asia. Cities
like New York, Los Angeles, London and
Paris have much to offer in these fields.
More and more Western dancers are
beginning to study non-European dances as
well as or instead of Western techniques, and
their studies are naturally having an impact on
their work. Today, many Western groups
have assimilated Japanese Butô, and it is not

necessary to have been born in Madras or
Jaipur to master the subtleties of Bharata
Natyam or Kathak. Influences of this sort can
only enrich dance. The multicultural society
of the kind which is developing in the capitals
and big cities of many Western countries will
also develop its own special dance profile and
its contours will no longer be purely Western,
something from which everyone will benefit.
However, the influence of classical ballet
cannot be disregarded. Since modern dance
and ballet buried the hatchet (in Episodes,
staged jointly by Martha Graham and George
Balanchine in New York in 1959), the two great
Western concepts of dance have moved closer
together. The spectator who sees choreog¬
raphy by the Swede Mats Ek, the Czech Jiri
Kylian, the American William Forsythe, or the
Dutchman Hans van Manen, will often not

know whether it is an example of ballet or the
new form of dance. In any case, it does not
really matter into which particular compart¬
ment the critics try to place Jiri Kylian's solo
Double You or Ek's duo-ballet Grasse.
Through their sheer quality such pieces influ¬
ence the neighbouring field of free dance.
One thing is perfectly clear. In dance as in
pictorial art, the tendency to put less and less
substance into the frame has gone. Mini¬
malism has had its day. It was probably neces¬
sary in order to chart the extreme limits of
what could still just be described as dance. The
trend today in Japan and America, Germany
and France is back to more movement all
kinds of movement in all kinds of surround¬
ings. Dancers will have to dance and not stand
still or sit motionless if we are to accept their
performance as dance. '

tradition and renewa
Nô and Butô are
two very different
forms of
expression united
by a common
philosophy
Above, "Eggs", (1986), a
Butô dance performed by the
Sankai Juku Company.
In Nô, the most typical form of tradi¬
tional Japanese dance drama, there are no
acrobatic leaps, no pirouettes, no movements
intended to surprise the audience. The actor,
whose body is not even fully stretched, moves
about the stage with almost irritating slowness.
It is hard to imagine what Nô could have
in common with Butô, one of the leading
contemporary forms of Japanese dance. On
the face of it the two seem totally different.
But when they are examined more closely it
becomes clear that a conception of the body
rooted in tradition is part of the philosophy
of Butô.



The body in Nô
Zeami Motokiyo (1363-1443), the author of
the finest Nô plays, " metaphorically
described the three essential qualities of a Nô
actor as "skin, flesh and skeletal structure".
The "skin" is visible beauty, the beauty of
physical appearance and movements.
"Flesh" is the range of techniques that the
actor learns to master. "Skeletal structure" is
the most important of the three. It refers to a
physical intensity which must not be relaxed
at any point in the performance.
This intensity is the result of an inner ten¬
sion, not liveliness of movement or physical
strength. It must exist even when the body is
completely immobile, as when the dancer
adopts the fundamental posture of Nô,
kamae. Actor Hisao Kanze says that when a
beginner is trained to practise kamae, "even
in an unheatcd place in the depths of winter,
all he has to do to forget the cold is to adopt
27

the posture". No particular psychological
effort is required.
In fact, the exercise is not focused on the



position of the body, but on muscular ten¬
sion and breathing technique. It is said that
the powers of a Nô actor can be assessed
simply on the basis of his kamae. The kamae
of the greatest actors gives an impression of
unshakable balance and a very strong pres¬
ence. The actor must achieve this physical
intensity before he starts to perform on
stage.
For centuries, audiences all over the
world have regarded the movements of the
dancer's body as transcending the everyday
world. Japan is no exception to this rule.
The lineage of traditional Japanese dance
includes certain religious ceremonies during
which a divinity borrows the carnal enve¬
lope of a miko, a female shaman, in order to
appear in this world. During the ceremony,
the body of the miko hovers on the edge of
ordinary space and obeys principles dif¬
ferent from those that are familiar to us.
In everyday life we only exploit the pos¬
sibilities of our bodies to a very limited
extent. In Japan, the traditional martial arts,
especially kendo ("the way of the sword"),
attach great importance to the static "guard"
position which is designated by the same
name as the basic Nô posture, kamae.
Again, it is said that the strength of a budôka
(a person who practises the martial arts) can
be gauged simply from the way in which he
adopts this posture. In the kamae position,
the body of the budôka does not move an
inch. Inwardly, however, all his muscles arc
poised to mobilize the maximum amount of
energy. This does not mean that each
muscle is tense but rather that not one is at
rest. Consciousness is not focused on any
single point of the body, but on all of them.
Kamae is thus defined as a posture open to
all eventualities, as virtual movement.
Virtual movement
In the same way, the kamae of a Nô actor
contains latent energy that the spectator
perceives in the form of corporeal intensity.
This energy is revealed in static postures and
slow movements. When the actor moves,
the economic yield is particularly great
because he knows how to use inertia and
forces of reaction.
Far greater tension and energy are
needed to prevent a stick held vertically in
the palm of the hand from toppling over
than to stop it from falling to the ground. In
the same way, a tremendous amount of
inner control is needed to keep the body on
an even keel while moving horizontally, and
this means controlling the slightest physical
mechanisms and expending considerable
energy. It is important that the spectators
should be able to realize that this inner effort
is taking place. Through this process, which
is not rational in itself, the body appears to
be completely controlled and reveals both
its latent possibilities for movement and the
amount of energy within it. Hence the
impression of intensity that radiates from it.
The prime objective of Nô is not so much
movement as the creation of this corporeal
intensity. Paradoxically, the surest way to
achieve this goal is to restrain one's move¬
ments. This is why Zeami's teaching is based
on the following principle: "Move the mind

Relationships", 1995).
ten tenths, the body seven tenths." The
remaining three tenths constitute potential
movement and give the body its intensity. It
is only later that the "flesh" of virtuosity and
the "skin" of beauty arc engrafted onto the
"skeletal structure" of the body. These arc
the three elements without which Nô dance
cannot achieve fulfilment.
A cultural straitjacket
Butô appeared around 1960, when it was
created by Tatsumi Hijikata, a modern
dancer without any experience of traditional
Japanese dance. He wanted to base this new
form of dance on his experience of life in his
native village. Butô was a reaction against
Western dance and traditional Japanese
dance forms, both of which are part of an
urban and aristocratic culture.
The environment in which the young
village boy grew up was grotesquely frag¬
mented. Everything was imperfect: nature,
home, daily life. The only thing he was sure
of was his vulnerable body. From childhood
on his body was imprisoned in a cultural
straitjacket by education. The prime func¬
tion of dance should thus be to reawaken
the potential of a body stifled by culture.
This is difficult because people cannot
imagine possibilities that they have never
known or imagined. All he knew was that
he had to bring these lost opportunities back
to the surface by a process that had nothing
to do with reverting to childhood or to the
state of primitive man.
Performing and
becoming
"Butô is a corpse which gets to its feet at
great risk to itself," says Tatsumi Hijikata. If
people rejected all the routine movements
imprinted in their bodies, they might find it
hard to stand upright. And yet they have to
get to their feet and then stay upright. This is
how their bodies can discover new possibil¬
ities, and this is the essence of Butô. Pre¬
cisely because it is utterly graceless and the
antithesis of the cultural refinement
achieved by Nô and kabuki, it should
demonstrate the falsity of contemporary
culture. If refined bodies are the products
and victims of culture, the ugly, clumsy
bodies of Butô destroy our conventional
ideas about bodies and thence about the cul¬
tural system itself.
Of course the body of each Butô dancer
is unique. One may skilfully repress a feeling
and let it simmer away inside himself in order
to heighten the impact when it suddenly
erupts to the surface. Another has the trans¬
parent vulnerable body of an angel. A third
changes in response to a given place, time and
audience. This has less to do with style or
choreography than with individual talent. In
every case, however, the Butô dancer must
first kill his cultural body, become a corpse,
and then stand upright. Only then does he
have to know how to move.
Whereas the Western dancer can be
defined as someone who "performs" move¬
ments that are beyond the capacities of ordi¬
nary people, the Nô actor "becomes"
someone on the edge of ordinary life. The
Western dancer is above all a specialist in
29

movement. His training is largely based on
acquiring great virtuosity by subjecting his
body to strict discipline. The Nô dancer, on
the other hand, lives his daily life with a per¬
fectly ordinary body, and on stage brings to
life a body that is out of the ordinary. Con¬
trary to what happens in Western theatre, the
artist does not use an actor's skills to play the
role of someone else or reproduce their feel¬
ings. His body starts to function according to
a different principle.
And so although Butô is at odds with
accepted aesthetic models, it has certain
similarities with Nô in the sense that it is
concerned with becoming rather than per¬
forming. It seeks primarily to bring to the
surface a body which has hitherto been
latent. "Performing" takes second place.
Only the presence of this particular body
(Zeami's "skeletal structure") allows the
"flesh" (movement) and the "skin" (expres¬
sion) to come into play. When they do, says
Zeami, "the instants when nothing is done
become captivating". Both Nô and Butô
dancers thus concentrate entirely on their
inner selves; they try to capture the subtlest
sensations of their bodies and control their
slightest movements. Hence their extreme
slowness.
The elegant movements of Nô, which
are described by the adjective yûgen
(obscure and profound) can only be made
when the dancer has a vigorous body. By
executing these movements the ballet
dancer seems to float weightlessly. The Nô
dancer must be full of intensity before he
can perform yûgen movements. It is clear
that Butô has inherited No's conception of
the body. This approach is not specific to
Butô. Many teachers of modern Japanese
dance, inspired by American and German
schools, are not primarily concerned with
movement but with increasing awareness of
the body.
Discovering the body means concen¬
trating on parts of it that usually escape per¬
ception, consciously making gestures that
are usually made mechanically and thus
becoming alert at every moment to what
the body is saying. As a result of this dis¬
covery, which is neither creation nor
expression, the body must be consciously
repossessed. This is the fundamental goal of
dance. Expression is achieved through
repossession of the body.


THE ARAB WORLD
emancipation
by Wendy Buonaventura
Women dancers
in the Arab world
are both admired
and rejected
by society
The Tunisian dancer, teacher
and choreographer Leila
Haddad during a performance
of Oriental dance in 1995.
Some years ago, at a wedding in
Morocco, I was invited to go and see
the hired dancers perform for the men (the
women of the house having retired to their
own quarters to entertain each other). Whilst
I was watching one of the performers dance
with a tray of lighted candles on her head, I
became aware of a rustling and whispering
above my head. I looked up at the balcony
and caught a glimpse, between the wooden
bannisters, of the women in their brightly
coloured dresses. So eager were they to see
the hired troupe that they had crept softly out
of their room and were crouched there, out
of sight, enjoying the performance.
Later, my Moroccan friend, knowing that
I myself performed and wrote about Arabic
dance, invited me to give a short improvisa-
30

radition and renewa
tion. Afterwards several of the Moroccans
went over to my partner and shook his hand,
congratulating him on my dancing and telling
him I had danced "like a real Moroccan".
When they learned that I had danced in the¬
atres in my own country, they looked at me
with curiosity. Why was I, a European,
dancing in such a way and, moreover, in
front of strange men? And why, with my
education, did I not belong to a "respectable"
profession such as teaching?
It was ten years ago that this happened,
but almost the same situation obtains today
vis-a-vis professional dance as it did then.
For an Arab woman of my background it is
almost unthinkable to contemplate a career
as a professional dancer. It is uneducated
women from the poorer classes who
become dancers. Dancing in the home is one
thing. Dancing in public is something else.
Dancers may bring a sense of celebration and
delight to social gatherings. They may thrill
their audience with their grace and beauty
and earthy sensuality, yet in the eyes of
society they are nonetheless engaged in the
lowest of professions. Indispensable at every
wedding, they themselves are hardly consid¬
ered marriageable material.
In this, their situation is no different from
that of Western ballerinas a hundred years
ago. Whilst opera was a popular art form,
upper-class girls were not allowed to attend if
a ballet was included in the opera. A balleri¬
na's costume in particular, which revealed
her legs up to the thigh clad in salmon-
coloured "fleshings", was considered far too
risque for the innocent eyes of well-bred
young ladies.
Social outsiders
Traditionally, Arab women dress splendidly
in private, yet in public they are expected to
conceal their charms beneath all-enveloping
robes. If they display themselves in public
and look about themselves too freely they
lay themselves open to being dishonoured.
Most Islamic societies have never looked
kindly on dancers. In Islamic thought the
sacred and the secular are indissolubly linked,
and it follows that recreational pursuits must
be reconciled with ethical principles. In tradi¬
tional Islamic society a woman's place is the
home.
Dancers have been the only women who
have not only intruded upon a male environ¬
ment, but appeared unveiled in public. They
are doubly disturbing to men in that their

Love (1949), a film by Ahmed

dance includes a strong sensual element. A
woman who performs in public in front of
strangers thus transgresses a traditional pro¬
hibition. Yet, paradoxically, she performs a
necessary function in her society. For the
presence of sensuality must be acknowl¬
edged somewhere in public life, and dancers
are the expression of it.
Professional performers were often out¬
siders, women from Gypsy and other
minority groups, and while they paid lip ser¬
vice to Islam, they often maintained their old
customs.
In a sense, condemnation of public
dancing by "respectable" women was advan¬
tageous to the poor, opening up a place for
them in society which could not have been
31

filled by anyone else. And today, dancers
enjoy benefits which counteract their pre¬
carious position in society. Their status as
breadwinners inevitably lends them self-
confidence and authority, as well as a
freedom not permitted other women. This is
reflected in popular descriptions of them.
The Moroccan chikhat who travel from
village to village, entertaining at family festiv¬
ities, are known as "women who do not want
men to tell them what to do". They are not
necessarily denied marriage themselves, nor
the rewards of a family, and indeed, their
male relatives are likely to be dependent on
them for a living. It is an interesting reversal
of the normal order in which men are the
breadwinners and women, confined to the
home, are considered in their own society to
be protected from the harsh realities of a
cruel world.
Mobility and independence
In the Arab world a family generally hopes
for the birth of a son rather than a daughter.
Yet in an interview some time before his
death, Yousef Maazin, the father of a famous
Egyptian troupe, said that he had been lucky
to have been blessed with so many beautiful
daughters, for they had provided him with a
handsome living.
Yet despite their fame the Maazin sisters
are acutely aware that, among their own
people, they are not considered acceptable
marriage partners. As one of them says:
"The only time I wish I wasn't a dancer is
when a man from another tribe falls in love
with me or one of my sisters. His family
would fight a war to stop him marrying a
dancer, a girl who performs in front of
others. They call us ghaiuazee, which means
'outsiders', 'invaders'. To them it's a dirty

marriage in Fez (Morocco).
word. But to us it means we invade their
hearts and minds with our dancing."
In many respects dancers like the Maazin
sisters can be regarded as fortunate. They are
not obliged to conform to all the rules of
society; their work gives them social
mobility and independence; and though their
position may be ambivalent, that in itself can
be a kind of freedom.
Arab films offer a fascinating insight into
the social status of dancers, and also give a
good idea of street morality and aspirations.
They testify to the popularity of dancing by
very often making the heroine a performer.
The film Balak Min Zouzou ("Beware of
Zouzou", see box) is one of the few Arab
films which advances the proposition that
there is nothing inherently shameful about
being a dancer. But such a film is rare, and
today Islamic fundamentalist groups are
seeking to eradicate the public expression of
sensual female dancing. Some performers
have been bribed to stop dancing, and in
some cases less protected dancers have been
beaten up.
A career in dance
At the other end of the spectrum, the situa¬
tion is more encouraging. For a new genera¬
tion of dancers is emerging among educated
women from middle-class families who have
such a love of Arabic dance that they are pre¬
pared to withstand convention and family
pressure in order to pursue a career about
which they are passionate. In the Middle East
a theatre structure docs not exist for the bold,
sensual women's solo dancing known as raqs
sharqi; folk dance alone is encouraged and
sponsored by the government in countries
such as Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.

A LYRIC OF LOVE
The solo dance of Arab women, known as raqs sharqi or oriental dance, has for centuries exercised
a fascination on men and women alike, both in the West and in the Arab world. Western travel liter¬
ature is full of lengthy descriptions of it. In the mid-nineteenth century, an American journalist, G.
W. Curtis, witnessed a performance by the legendary Kutchuk Hanem, whom many travellers jour¬
neyed up the Nile to visit at Esna. He wrote:
"The sharp surges of sound swept around the room, dashing in regular measure against her
movelessness, until suddenly the whole surface of her frame quivered in measure with the music.
Her hands were raised, clapping the castanets, and she slowly turned upon herself, her right leg the
pivot, marvellously convulsing all the muscles of her body. There was no graceful dancingonly the
movement of dancing when she advanced, throwing one leg before the other as gypsies dance. But
the rest was most voluptuous motionnot the lithe wooing of languid passion but the soul of
passion starting through every sense, and quivering in every limb. It was the very intensity of
motion, concentrated and constant. It was profoundly dramatic; a lyric of love which words cannot
tell; profound, Oriental, intense and terrible." W.B.

an Egyptian film by Hassan El Imam.
ZOUZOU DEFENDS HER ART
In the film Khali Balak Min Zouzou (Beware of Zouzou), Zouzou is a student who has paid her way
through college by dancing in her mother's troupe. She has kept this fact a secret, but has decided
to give up dancing because she has fallen in love with a college professor. Zouzou 's lover breaks
off a former engagement, and his ex-fiancee discovers Zouzou's secret. A wedding is to be cele¬
brated at the lover's home. Unknown to Zouzou, the abandoned fiancee arranges for Zouzou's
mother's troupe to entertain at this wedding. Meanwhile, there is a poignant scene in which
Zouzou admits that she has loved working in the troupe, and tells her mother, "I used to sit at your
feet and watch you dance. You were so beautiful. Why should we be ashamed of what we do?"
The day of the wedding dawns. Zouzou, who is there as her lover's guest, sees her mother's
troupe arrive, and in a moment of grand confusion everyone realizes Zouzou's connection with
them. Her mother is so humiliated for her daughter that she stops dancing. But Zouzou, rising mag¬
nificently to the occasion, ties a scarf round her hips and performs in her mother's place. She
ends by giving a dignified defence of her art.
When this film was originally screened in Lebanon some years ago it created quite a stir. For the
first time, raqs sharqi was portrayed as being acceptable for its own sake. That women should
dance for the joy of it, and even take it up as an honourable profession, were startling notions.
Many women in the audience jumped up and began to applaud, and it would be nice to think that
some of them danced in the aisles. W.B.
Europe and America, where a craze for this
dance has spread like wildfire over the past
ten years or so. They have to contend with
considerable family pressure in order to go
this way, and more than one of them has not
felt able to tell her family back home what
she does for a living. For these women all
have one thing in common: they have left
their native countries, and are working
within a context of Western art and theatre.
A Tunisian friend with whom I have per-
« formed has found opposition from an unex-
¿ pected quarter. Performing at an arts festival
| in Tunis she encountered a group of Tunisian
f feminists who said to her, "Why do you try
1 and take this dance into the theatre? Why not
I leave it where it belongs? In cabarets and
clubs?" My friend went on, "For them, intel¬
ligent women must only use their heads, sac¬
rificing their bodies and denying their sensual
side."
In the non-Christian world the sensuous
arts have always been celebrated. Ironically,
by accepting the puritan ethics of their
Western counterpart, feminists such as these
deny a vital, life-enhancing aspect of their
own culture. And it is this sensual aspect of
the dance that has proved such an attraction
to the thousands of Western women who
are now flocking to studios in the major
cities of Europe and America to learn Arabic
dance.

Today she is one of the most popular cabaret
performers in Egypt. Her family still has not
accepted her change of career, despite her
fame. She says her ambition is to open a
dance school for children. But she knows
that she will not be able to obtain a licence
from the government to do this. And even if
it were possible, no women would send their
little girls along to her school.
Yet who knows what will happen in the
future? For, ten years ago, it would have
been unthinkable for a woman with her
background to even contemplate such a
career. I know and have worked with
women from similar backgrounds to Dina's,
women from Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and
Tunisia who are treading the path of profes¬
sional dance, but this time with significant
differences.
One difference is that they are seeking
ways in which to develop and expand raqs
sharqi in a theatrical context. They perform
not in cabarets but at festivals of the per¬
forming arts. They teach at dance studios in

bour across the road. It houses the Dora
Stratou Theatre of Greek Dances, which was
founded in 1953. Justly called "the living
museum of Greek dances", it is at the same
time a museum, a theatre, a research institute,
a school and, of course, a dance troupe.
The theatre is unique in many ways, not
least in the way it recruits its dancers. Every
year in January, dancers from all over Greece
come to the theatre and rehearse alongside
the older members of the company. They
continue to do so for about three months, by
which time the ones who don't make the
grade will have left, a process which brings
the numbers down to around thirty. From
this group a final selection of new dancers
can be made before performances begin in
May.
Once they are in the company, dancers
are required to work three hours a day
(including rehearsals and performances),
seven days a week for the five months of the
summer season. Since they are paid only a
small fee for expenses, it is obvious that for
the dedicated core of dancers this is a labour
of love.

What the audience sees on stage each
night is the result of months of painstaking
work not only in the form of rehearsals but
also research. Every step a dancer performs
has its roots in history and village culture.
The process begins when the theatre
decides on a particular village or island it
wants to include in its programme. A team of
folklorists is sent to gather information about
the history and folk customs of the area.
Then a team from the theatre, often joined by
a few dancers, goes to the village and stays
there for at least a few days in order to make
contact with the local people and study their
culture.
They conduct informal interviews with
the older members of the village, who are
encouraged to play traditional music and
dance for their guests. The music and dances
are recorded and the recordings are taken
back to Athens to be studied by musicians
and dancers from the theatre.
A group of villagers is also invited to
Athens, where members of the company
have the opportunity to dance and play
music with them and absorb their particular
style of execution. As unofficial "goodwill
ambassadors" for their local culture the vil¬
lagers are usually filled with pride, and feel a
renewed interest in keeping it alive at home.
At present the company has eighty different
villages in its repertoire and each year one or
two more are added to the list.
The principle used for dance research is
applied to music as well. Special attention is
given to the unique style of singing and
playing in each village and the particular
instruments that are popular there. The the¬
atre has two singers and fifteen permanent
folk musicians who play for rehearsals and
performances every day. No recorded music
is used, in order to maintain the personal rap¬
port between dancers and musicians which is
inherent in folk culture.
Great emphasis is also placed on the per¬
formers' attire. The theatre houses the
country's biggest collection of traditional
Greek costumes 2,500 at the last count
half of which are between fifty and a hundred
years old. The costumes cannot be bought in
shops and are cither sold to the theatre by
elderly villagers or else the villagers are asked
to make them, using traditional weaving,
dyeing and embroidery techniques.
As the "preserver of traditional Greek
dance" and a cultural centre for Greek folk¬
lore, one of the most important of the the¬
atre's activities is spreading the dance mes¬
sage via courses for beginners, advanced
dancers and children. Regular weekend
workshops are held featuring dance, music
and costumes from a particular region. The
© The Dora Stratou Theatre of Greek Dances, Athens
Theatre also holds summer courses for non-
Greek dance teachers from other countries
who want to incorporate Greek traditional
dance into their teaching programmes; this is
a particularly good way of ensuring that the
traditions of Greek dance are kept alive the
world over.
Finally, the Theatre acts as a publishing
house. It has produced forty-five records and
cassettes, as well as numerous ethnographic
books, all dealing with the different aspects of
Greek dance, costumes and music.

The International Dance Council (IDC)
"Dance," wrote the French philosopher Roger Garaudy, "is a way of existing." By
changing with the times and being receptive to a wide range of cultures, it can
express life in all its richness and diversity. Studying dance in other cultures than our
own does not involve copying but enriching the vocabulary of dance by asking new
questions and giving new answers to prepare the body to translate our relationship
with the world into movement.
The International Dance Council, which was founded with UNESCO support in
1973, has taken this concept of dance as a total art and a universal language as the
framework of its activities. The Council seeks to promote all forms of dance by safe¬
guarding it as part of the intangible artistic heritage, and by encouraging choreo¬
graphic and choreological creation and research and their integration into general
education. In collaboration with UNESCO, it also encourages the creation of spe¬
cialized documentation centres, the setting up of national committees, the organi¬
zation of congresses, festivals and competitions and the training of dancers.

I Indian classical dance reveals a world
that is normally beyond the reach of
our senses. Every aspect of it has a sacred
dimension, reflecting its origins as a sacred
temple ritual designed to propitiate the gods.
The two chief Hindu gods, Shiva and
Krishna, are closely associated with dance,
which is described in an ancient treatise,
Bharata's Natya Shastra, as an offering to God,
a cleansing of the soul, a path to salvation and
an expression of God within oneself.
The overwhelming impact of a perfor¬
mance of Indian classical dance today is made
by its sculptural quality, its symmetrical
beauty and its stylized grace. Following intri¬
cate rhythms the dancer makes sinuous con¬
vulsions which culminate in timeless poses
when he or she seems solidified, a statue with
the unresisting density of honey poured
upon honey.
Sensuous and spiritual
The ethos of Indian dance is both sensuous
and spiritual. The dynamism of the human
form becomes a vehicle in which the dancer
embodies imperishable spirit and noble sen¬
timent. In the Natya Shastra, Bharata writes:
"Having made the invocation, the dancing
must begin. The song should be sustained in
the throat; the mood (bhava) must be
shown by the glances and the time {tala) be
marked by the feet. Wherever the hand
moves, there the glances follow. Where the
glances go, the mind follows. Where the
mind goes, the mood follows. Where the
mood goes, there lies the flavour {rasa)." It is
said that the ideal spectator relishes this rasa,
or rather that the rasa is reflected in the
spectator. To witness classical dance-forms
such as Bharata Natyam, Odissi or Kathak is
to face a mirror in which one's spiritual self is
reflected.
In classical dance a distinction is made
between pure dance sequences {nritta) and
mimetic and interpretative gestures {nritya).
The dancer uses his or her entire body for
abhinaya or dramatic interpretation, but
chiefly the face and the hands, with two
modes of interpretation lokadharmi (real¬
istic) and natyadharmi (stylized). It is
through the latter mode that imaginative sug¬
gestions are made, much to the aesthetic
delight of the rasika (connoisseur).
The legendary Bharata Natyam dancer
Balasaraswati believed that dignified restraint
was the hallmark of abhinaya. In her own
words, "Even in the best of laughter, there is
a restraint on the mouth movement, even at
the height of wonder, there is a limit for
opening the eyes, even in the white heat of
amorous sport, the danseuse has no use for
movements of the torso but gestures only
through the face and hands. This decency,
decorum and dignity impart to Bahrata
Natyam its divine character."
Fixed in time
Unlike other Indian art forms such as
painting, sculpture and theatre, the dominant
dance culture of urban and modern India has
not entered into dialogue with changing
times. For centuries Indian dancers have
been evoking Krishna's divine pranks and
the moods of archetypal nayikas (heroines).
Why does Indian dance not reflect the issues
of contemporary life?

In view of the freedom that modern
choreography demands, its natural place is in
the Western dance idiom, a salient feature of
which is the organization of horizontal space.
It could be said that Indian classical dance is
organized along vertical lines. The dense
vocabulary of its movements is not the stuff
for free-flowing exploration of space. Rather
it aspires to move in time, from rhythmic
time to timeless frozen postures.
However, if the dominant dance culture
in modern India is to find creative vitality and
freshness, perhaps it should redefine some
of its values and articulate a conviction for
creative freedom. A new synthesis should be
created.
And yet quite a few independent Indian
dancers and choreographers have forged
links between their traditional roots and their
experiences and feelings of contemporary
life. Some have searched for new repertoires
and texts; others have sought inspiration
from the myriad forms of folk dances in
India or have made a fusion of Indian and
Western dance genres.
One hopes, then, that the timeless theatre
of the Indian spirit will increasingly be dotted
with niches of individual creative statements
of dance, without tipping Saraswati or
Ganesh from their pedestals. Like its dancers
who bend and angle their physiques so
gracefully, let Indian dance culture be more
flexible today.

COMMENTARY BY FEDERICO MAYOR
A NEW OUTLOOK FOR
HUMANITY
The construction of peace must begin at
the moment when life begins. More than
ever before, we must struggle to ensure
that the inalienable principle of the right to rights
applies to all citizens; more than ever before, soci¬
eties must reject violence and corruption; more
than ever before, all social forces civil, military
and religious must combine their efforts, skills
and imagination in the search for new solutions to
new problems which can only be solved by spiri¬
tual force. More than ever before, we must turn
our backs on inertia and routine, and become the
architects of our own destiny.
We must make constant efforts to identify and
address the economic, social, ideological and polit¬
ical causes of all forms of discrimination, humilia¬
tion and deep-rooted inequality that can give rise
to rivalry and confrontation.
If there is to be a fresh flowering of life on earth
it will need to grow out of a firm alliance between
culture and nature, in which knowledge and pop¬
ular wisdom must play their part alongside the
great advances of science and technology.
We are now approaching the end of the twen¬
tieth century, one of the most violent in the history
of humanity. Between two Balkan wars we have
witnessed two worldwide conflagrations and
dozens of regional and local conflicts. It has been a
century tragically marked by violence. At the same
time, the good seed that lies dormant in humankind
has sprouted into hope for the future, based on an
awareness of our common destiny as a planetary
society and the realization that we are all citizens of
the world, with the rights and duties this entails.
Educating by example
At the dawn of a new century and a new millen¬
nium let us assume the responsibilities of this new
citizenship which does not conflict with our citi¬
zenship of birth, but enriches and complements it.
One of the dilemmas we must overcome is the
apparent contradiction between the universal and
the local, the global and the national. We must
respect, safeguard and nurture diversity. The elim¬
ination of differences is dangerous not only in cul¬
tural terms, because it leads to standardization and
uniformization; worse still it contributes to the
creation of an indifferent, undifferentiated world.
We can only aspire to universality if we have a
strong awareness of our local roots. And the more
generous we are in universal terms and the more
respectful of others the stronger our national iden¬
tity will become. As the Spanish poet Antonio
40

Machado put it: "A good description of your own
village will make you universal". And an old adage
reminds us that "In the beginning was our region;
the world was given to us as a bonus".
High walls which once seemed impregnable
have been brought down by the irresistible force
of the human longing for freedom, dignity and the
affirmation of identity. But new walls have been
built by the uneven distribution of wealth between
and within nations, and by disparities arising from
the production and use of knowledge and from
ethnic and religious differences.
To combat racism, xenophobia and discrimina¬
tion, we must teach by example. Children will not
take their cue from what we say to them, but from
what we do. Youth, sport, music, unselfish com¬
petition, learning to win and lose all these activi¬
ties, together with "history without war" must
now become the core of a new kind of teaching
and nothing teaches more than love for the
world's children and young people.
Ethical principles
If we are to construct a culture of peace, we must
be inspired by ethical principles, not market forces
or opinion polls, since what really matters in the
final analysis is not the free market but free people.
Ethics signifies coherence between what we preach
and what we do, between what we say and our real
motivations. And, to quote Bolivian stateman José
Luis Tejada, we must not remain silent "when we
could have spoken and should have spoken, and
loudly at that". "I should have cried out when I saw
that the dawn was under threat, but I felt sadness
and fear." Our concern with economic deficits
must not allow us to forget that spiritual deficits are
at the root of the problems that beset us.
The twenty-first century can be the century of
"justice and dignity" proclaimed in UNESCO's
Constitution. It will be a century of peace or it will
be nothing; it will be a century of lasting develop¬
ment or it will be nothing; it will be a century of
imagination and creativity or it will be nothing; it
will be a golden age of solidarity and love or it will
be nothing; it will be a century of reconciliation
and the rehabilitation of the excluded or it will be
nothing. If the twenty-first century is to be equal
to our dreams and hopes and Utopia is to be made
possible, we must be bold and dare to change.
The twenty-first century will come into its own
if we are capable of demolishing the barriers within
us that deny access to a new form of civilization. It
will come into its own if we can surmount new
obstacles such as those preventing the full, just and
egalitarian development of women; those that
hamper the legitimate aspirations of young people
to play a full part in society; and those that discrim¬
inate against ethnic minorities and condemn them
to wretched and hopeless lives. The Indian scholar
and statesman Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan warned
us of this at the very first session of UNESCO's Gen¬
eral Conference, when he said: "UNESCO stands not
merely for a new set of adjustments but for a new
way of life, a new outlook, a new philosophy which
will inspire humanity. . . . What is essential today is
not so much the rehabilitation of schools and
libraries, or shops and factories, as the rehabilitation
of man. We must recreate man if we are to recreate
a new world community.

V The temple
of Apollo
the Helper
by Takis
Theodoropoulos
On a grandiose and lonely site in the
Péloponnèse, the majestic ruins of an
ancient Greek temple registered on the
World Heritage List in 1986
HSSPS
©Andritsaina/ICOMOS
I I first set eyes on the temple of
I Apollo Epicurius (the Helper), at
Bassae in Arcadia, in the late 1970s. At
that time it was not covered by the tar¬
paulin which shrouds it (luring restora¬
tion work today.
Its columns came into view at a bend in
the road that climbs from Andritscna to
Bassae. A set of slender shadows in a
lonely place, silhouettes designed to cap¬
ture the essential relationship of the
human body with space, they seemed pre¬
destined to occupy this lofty site which
dominates the surrounding countryside.
But had not the temple of Segesta in
Sicily inspired the same thoughts? Do I
not feel the same whenever I see the
ruins of Delphi appear beneath the
Castalian rocks? Do I not always come
to tlie same conclusion in summer when
I sit on the tiered seats of the theatre at
Epidaurus and contemplate the sunset
while waiting for the performance to
begin? Before they devoted themselves
to the joys of arithmetic and geometry,
the ancient Greeks had carefully
observed the landscape around them.
But in choosing to build the temple
of Apollo Epicurius on this isolated site,
devoid of any trace of human presence,
they faced a particular challenge. This
is a far cry from Byzantine monasteries
perched on the edge of steep cliffs or
hidden away in remote places, seemingly
at the mercy of a landscape ready to
engulf them.
The temple's architect whether it
was Ietinus, the architect of the
Parthenon, as is widely thought, or
someone else did not feel that kind of
humility. He had no need of a mediator
to converse with his god, a god of light
and observation.
A MOMENT OF HARMONY
On my way to the summit, among the
builder's rubble a jumble of rocks left
by time and the elements I discovered
the surrounding countryside. In the dis¬
tance I could see the massif of
Taygetus, and beneath it the oval bulk
of Mount Ithomus, then a stretch of the
Ionian Sea, and the peaks of Arcadia
beyond. Through some miracle of light,
this immense landscape had become
accessible.
This impression is familiar to those
who know and love the rugged outlines of
the Peloponnesian landscape. If you see
it steadily and see it whole, then the
horizon, without ever losing its depth, is
never far away. But on the pitted floor of
this ancient temple, through columns
which seemed to have absorbed into their
42

flesh the shadows of the setting sun, the
phenomenon was at last explained. The
temple seemed to have been designed to
be the virtual centre of a world which had
become circular and complete.
Built in grey Arcadian limestone and
not in the white marble from Pcntelicus
which gives the Parthenon its trans¬
parency and brilliance, the temple of
Apollo Epicurius sharpens your powers
of observation and whets your curiosity.
Its architecture encourages one to
look at the landscape in a new way. Seen
from this temple built 1,100 metres
above sea level, mountain peaks, sea,
and patches of dark green stipple the
harsh grey-green tones of the Arcadian
landscape, so that a world which a
moment earlier seemed indifferent, like

a story without beginning or end,
becomes an open book and can at last
be properly observed.
The French philosopher Alain
described ancient architecture as "the
moment of harmony between the view¬
point of everyone and the unique world
which is common to all and different for
all."
AN OUTBREAK OF PLAGUE
But without their history, without the
many histories that jostle behind their
barrier of silence when we discover them
in an undulating landscape, ancient ruins
would doubtless be no more than beau¬
tiful objects. That is why I have always
preferred archaeological sites to
museums. In their native disorder, in the
midst of their natural surroundings, old
stones are redolent of human activity,
reminding us that they arc the traces of
a bygone age which can be conjured up
by looking at them with care.
As I look at the temple of Apollo
Epicurius and as I learn about Ictinus, I
find myself imagining the Parthenon's
exiled architect walking the paths of
Arcadia, a region set apart from his¬
tory's great highways, where stories of
werewolves were still told and the local
goat-legged god, Pan, held sway.
Why did Ictinus have to leave
Athens? Perhaps he was afraid of
meeting the same fate as his ailing col¬
league Phidias, whom the Athenian
democracy, suspicious of those who had
the temerity to distinguish themselves,
accused of stealing gold from the statue
of Athena Parthenos and then threw
into prison where he died. Perhaps he
simply needed work. Perhaps, as he saw
the Peloponnesian War drag on and state
money being spent on building more and
more ships, he decided to leave Athens
and earn his living in Arcadia.
Whatever the truth may have been,
it is known that in 420 B.C., around the
time when the temple was built, there
was an outbreak of plague in Arcadia.
In order to escape the danger of
infection, the inhabitants of the nearby
city of Phigalia sought protection from
Apollo. Like other Greek divinities, this
god from the north, who had learned
the art of divination from Pan and
ordained the fate of the Greek world by
returning the Pythian oracles to Delphi,
had many, sometimes contradictory,
functions. One of his leading roles was
to protect medicine, and it was in grati¬
tude for his qualities as a healer that
the Phigalians referred to him as "the
Helper". To thank him for delivering
them from the plague, they built a
dwelling for him at Bassae.
"The city of Phigalia is surrounded
by mountains. . . . Mount Kotilion is
located about forty stages from the city
where there is a place called Bassae,
and the temple of Apollo Epicurius",
43

wrote the 2nd-century-A.D. Greek trav¬
eller and historian Pausanias {Arcadia,
XLI, 7). Pausanias noted that the
temple was more harmonious and beau¬
tiful than all others in the Péloponnèse,
but only devoted a few sentences to it. A
little further on he admits that he jour¬
neyed to Phigalia to make a sacrifice to
Demeter in her sanctuary.
AN UNUSUAL SANCTUARY
I wonder whether Pausanias actually
went as far as Bassae. If he had, would
he not have written a few lines to
describe the low-relief sculptures on
the pediments and the frieze inside the
temple showing Greeks fighting the
Amazons and Centaurs fighting the Lap-
iths? Would he not have been surprised
by the building's unusual orientation,
which breaks one of the ground-rules of
the sacred architecture of Antiquity,
namely that the entrance to a temple
should be in the east and that the
statue of the god should be at the far
end of the building, on the western side,
looking towards the entrance?
Built on a narrow platform in a moun-
AN ORIGINAL TEMPLE
Built at Bassae (altitude 1,130 metres) in
the Péloponnèse on the territory of the Arca¬
dian city-state of Phigalia.
Begun in the second half of the 5th cen¬
tury B.C. by Ictinus (according to the Greek
geographer Pausanias) and completed by
another architect in the first quarter of the 4th
century B.C.
A peripteral temple (I.e. with a single row of
columns around it), with an extremely elon¬
gated ground-plan (39.87 metres by 16.13 and
6 x 15 columns), and an unusual north-south
alignment; built largely in local grey limestone.
Most remarkable innovation: first recorded
use of a Corinthian capital.
An outer Doric colonnade surrounds the
inner portico (pronaos) and the celia (naos),
interspersed at regular intervals by engaged
Ionic columns acting as buttresses. A long
frieze of sculpted marble (now in the British
Museum) adorned the interior of the naos, por¬
traying combat between Greeks and Amazons
and Lapithae and Centaurs.
The temple had a considerable influence on
the monuments built in the 4th century B.C. at
Delphi and in the Péloponnèse, especially at
Epidaurus.
tainous valley (the ancient meaning of
the place-name Bassae or Bessae is
"small valley") the temple is aligned
from north to south. This unusual ori¬
entation, imposed by the lie of the land,
confirms the ancient Greek adage
whereby one should not break the rules
unless compelled to do so.
When the temple was finished, the
Phigalians and their architect faced the
tricky problem of where to put Apollo.
They had chosen this lofty site so that
the god could dominate the surrounding
countryside, but they could not have
him look towards the remote and
sombre north whence he had come. This
seems to have been why they chose the
most economical solution. The statue
was duly placed at the far end of the
temple, but facing the east wall, where
a hole was pierced so that the god could
see the sunlight, and, I imagine, present
a fine Greek profile to visitors.
I fear that Apollo may have felt
slighted at having to endure this
unusual location for so many eenturies.
It is certain that these stories, these
infringements of the rules, reveal the

ritual of a religion whose laws were not
recorded in writing, which left the
sweet smell of anarchy behind it as well
as great works of art, thus confirming
the impression that it was designed to
accept life on a human scale and not cut
it down to size in Procrustean fashion,
or magnify it to emulate the gods.
A WOUNDED BODY
Today, beneath its white tarpaulin, the
temple of Apollo Epicurius looks like a
massive wounded body lying in an oper¬
ating theatre while it receives emergency
treatment. It has many wounds, and for a
life that has lasted so many eenturies
intensive care may take decades.
Many of the Doric columns on the
outside are dangerously askew. Inside
the temple, the engaged Ionic columns
forming buttresses rest on ground rav¬
aged by time, winter snow and earth¬
quakes. The last two frame a single
Corinthian column, perhaps the oldest
specimen of its kind, near to which the
statue of the god once stood.
This isolated temple long remained
in the shadows. It was not until 1765
that it was discovered by the French
architect Joachim Bocher. In 1812 the
site was visited by the Society of Dilet¬
tanti, a group of antiquarians from
Britain and other European countries.
The visitors drew the bas-reliefs of the
metopes and any transportable object
that came to hand including the
marble parts of the wooden statue of
Apollo and returned two years later to
remove them, on the orders of the
future King George IV. Since then their
booty has been in the British Museum,
near the Parthenon friezes. Fortunately,
the temple columns were solidly
implanted and were too massive to be
carried by the mules which transported
the bas-reliefs to the port of Kyparissia.
The columns have stayed where they
are, stubbornly resisting the passage of
time, pillars of authenticity amidst the
luminous lines of the landscape which
saw their birth.

A CROSS-GRAINED
SUCCESS
France's National Institute for Agronomic
Research (INRA) announces that it has
created a promising new plant variety,
which it has called "triticale", a cross
between Triticum (wheat) and Sécale
(rye). The basic idea was to combine
rye's hardiness (its resistance to
humidity, cold and acid soils) with
wheat's abundance. Already 200,000
hectares of triticale are growing in France.
Previously, unsuccessful attempts had
been made since the end of the last cen¬
tury in Scotland, Germany,
Russia and North Americato cross
soft wheat with rye. Research is contin¬
uing to improve the variety, which has
numerous advantages as animal fodder,
but does not replace wheat for making
bread.
CALLING THE SHOCKS
A number of phenomena that act as
warning signs of earthquakes have been
identified by modern seismologists. They
include ground deformation, variations in
the temperature and level of water in
wells, an increase in the chlorine content
of spring water, emissions of radon (a
radioactive gas given off by volcanic soil)
and changes in the earth's magnetic
field. Laboratories have been set up in
Chile, Tibet, Greece and other countries
to study these phenomena, and as part
of a European project known as GAIA
(Geotectonic Activity Instrumentation
and Analysis) a battery of sensors to
monitor them has been installed in a cave
in the Gulf of Corinth (Greece), a seismi-
cally active region. However, scientists
are still unable to predict with precision
the date, epicentre and scale of an
earthquake.
MY BELOVED
PLANET
A 250-page book providing a factual pre¬
sentation of major environmental issues
via a blend of illustrations and simple
texts has just been published with aid
from Unesco in French and Spanish (an
English version is in preparation). Entitled
My Beloved Planet, it is a useful source
of ideas for teachers and their pupils,
giving practical advice and down-to-earth
explanations of some of the harm inflicted
on the planet by human activity.
AT LOGGERHEADS
Loggerhead turtles need beaches to
propagate, and every year Sekanla Beach
on the Greek island of Zákynthos is the
site of the Mediterranean's largest con¬
centration of nesting females. However,
although a law to protect these tiny crea¬
tures has been on the books for fifteen
years, local people have built a road to
the beach to facilitate access for
tourists. According to the Greek branch
of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF),
the problem is that it takes less time to
build a road than it does for the bureau¬
cracy to act. Time is not on the side of
the loggerhead, which does not repro¬
duce until it is thirty years old.
OLD KING COAL
According to the 16th World Energy
Council, which was held in Tokyo (Japan)
in October 1995, fossil fuels will rconsti-
tute 75 to 80 per cent of world energy
sources until the year 2050. The most
popular of these will be coal, the earth's
most abundant fossil energy source,
worldwide consumption of which will
double by the year 2020 and overtake
that of oil. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts a 1.5
per cent annual increase in the volume of
world carbon dioxide (C02) emissions
until the year 2025. In view of these
problems, industrialists are carrying out
research into more economical and less
polluting equipment and into the devel¬
opment of new energy sources.
FLEXING MUSSELS AGAINST
POLLUTION
On 18 September 1995, the French
Research Institute for Exploitation of the
Sea (IFREMER) and the Rhone-Mediter¬
ranean-Corsica Water Company began an
unprecedented experiment to monitor the
quality of France's Mediterranean coastal
waters. 82 yellow buoys, each with two
baskets containing a few kilograms of live
mussels, were anchored in waters 20 to
30 metres deep. Since mussels concen¬
trate the chemical contaminants that pol¬
lute sea water, they will be used to mon¬
itor water quality over a one-year period. It
is hoped that the operation will eventu-

ally lead to reduced waste disposal in the
Mediterranean.
THEIR WORLD
IN THEIR HANDS
In Papua New Guinea ownership of 90 to
97 per cent of the land remains with com¬
munities rather than individuals or the
state. Nearly all the country's rainforest
is thus in the hands of the people who
have a real interest in preserving it.
Recent deforestation rates are no higher
than about 0.1 'per cent annually,
whereas other Asian countries experience
rates from ten to twenty times higher.
FATHERS WHO GIVE BIRTH
The male seahorse has the extraordinary
capacity of getting pregnant and giving
birth. After the female deposits eggs in
his brood pouch, he fertilizes them, car¬
ries them for twenty-one days, then expels
from 4 to 1,572 babies (a world record)
depending on the species. Couples mate
for life and reinforce their bonds with ritual
"greetings". Each morning the female
visits her pregnant spouse, both sexes
brighten in colour and wrap their tails
round a blade of sea-grass, and then sway
gently back and forth face to face. But
this harmony is threatened by a legal
global trade along the shores of six conti¬
nents that nets 20 million seahorses
every year for use in traditional Chinese
medicines and aphrodisiacs, in aquariums
and in food.
ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY TUNISIA
In 1993 Tunisia produced a report listing
all its environmental problems. A second
report, published in September 1995,
confines itself to just three of them:
water, desertification and energy. The air-
pollution problem, according to
Mohamed Mehdi Mlika, Tunisia's Min¬
ister of the Environment and Land Use
Planning, has been solved by a 60-million-
dinar ($65 million) investment, and the
waste-water problem is on the way to
solution. Beach management is a
thornier problem because local govern¬
ment lacks sufficient funds to clean pop¬
ular beaches, and there have been 800
infringements of waterfront building
codes. Although there is no lack of water
at present, there are fears that it will be in
short supply by the year 2025. Esti¬
mated costs of environment-protection
programmes are put at $3 billion for a 10-
year period.
EARTHY COLOURS
Heavy metals such as lead, chromium and
cadmium are used by industry to produce
the pigments used in the manufacture of
paints and coloured plastics. However,
more and more countries are prohibiting the
use of these metals because of their toxic
effects. Anticipating a tightening of legisla¬
tion in France, the Rhône-Poulenc company
is looking for ways to replace heavy metals
with rareearth metals (the lanthanide
series) and relatively abundant minerals like
tritium, cerium and lanthanum, which are
already used for making halogen lamps, cat¬
alytic converters for automobiles and
colour screens for televisions and com¬
puters. Whether this means lower paint
prices is another matter entirely.
A NEW BROOM FOR
NORTHWESTERN RUSSIA
The European Commission has agreed to
provide 50 million ECUs to aid projects
recently adopted by the six Foreign Minis¬
ters of the Euro-Arctic Council of the Bar¬
ents Sea (Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Russia and Sweden), including
the refurbishment of the Kola nuclear
plant near Murmansk (Russia), the
recovery and reprocessing of nuclear
waste that has been jettisoned around
the Barents Sea, and the modernization
of the region's factories and road net¬
work. The Euro-Arctic Council has already
embarked on 60 of 84 projects proposed
at its first two annual conferences.
ARID ZONES AT RISK
A booklet entitled Les zones arides dans les
programmes de ¡'Unesco ("The Arid Zones
in Unesco's Programmes") has just been
issued (in French only) by Unesco's Divi¬
sion of Ecological Sciences. Clear, well illus¬
trated and easy to read, it will be of interest
to all concerned with the fight against
desertification.

Isabelle Leymarie talks to
The master puppeteer
HUANG HAI-TAI
Ninety-four-year-old Huang Hai-Tai,
who comes from Yunlin in central
Taiwan, bears the secrets of a very
ancient tradition. He is probably the
oldest hand-puppeteer still at work, and
has trained and influenced many others.
His wife and some of his twelve children
work with him, and several of his grand¬
sons are also puppeteers. One of his
daughters is currently in Budapest
studying the tradition of Hungarian
puppetry.
As well as being highly entertaining,
his puppet shows have a sacred pur¬
pose. They are accompanied by catchy
music and are full of symbols that have
profound significance for those who
know their language and context.
"Almost in spite of himself," one spe¬
cialist has written, "the puppeteer is
the High Priest of popular ritual. He is
invited to inaugurate temples, attract
the blessings of Heaven, ward off evil
and generally fulfil his role as a creator
and provider of good things."
In September 1995, at the Maison
des Cultures du Monde, a Paris cultural
centre, Huang Hai-Tai put on several
shows based on two classics of Buddhist
literature, Legends of the Mad Monk
and Journey to the West.
Even for the uninitiated, Huang Hai-
Tai's subtle art has great fascination. In
Paris, the audience was particularly
delighted when, at one point in the
show, the Master came out from behind
his curtain, sat down smiling in front of
the stage and manipulated some of his
puppets. At the end of the evening he
asked the gods to bestow good fortune
and happiness on the audience.
During the following interview I was
struck by his fine, slender hands, the
pride of his hearing and his mobile,
radiant features.
You area singer and musician as
well as a puppeteer. What are the
origins of your art?
My father taught me bei-guan, the
singing style I use to accompany my
shows. It probably originated in the
Fujian region, on the east coast of
China, and crossed the Straits of For¬
mosa in the seventeenth century. The
words are a blend of Taiwanese and Bei
jing dialects, but their origins go back
to very ancient times. They have reli¬
gious overtones, and although this form
of puppet theatre has popular appeal,
its purpose is profoundly moralistic. It
aims to encourage virtue and to teach
values such as kindness, justice and
fidelity. Some of the musicians' instru¬
ments come from Hunan province in
southern China. My father knew how to
play them all, except the violin.
If someone wanted to enter your
profession, what would they have to
do?
First of all, they would have to learn
how to work the puppets' hands, which
are articulated. Then they would have
to learn the dialogue and the different
voices, which are conventionalized. As
in Chinese opera, there arc archetypes:
the female servant, the monk, the
scholar, the devil, the Taoist, the young
bride and the monkey. Each one has a
specific vocabulary and vocal range. You
have to know how to bring the charac¬
ters to life and give them their specific
colour. Then you have to learn the bei-
48

guan style of music, which is the most
widely used today in Taiwan, and how
to play the instruments, first the pei-gu
drum (the drummer leads the band),
then the cymbals and the violin. There
are five musicians, whose role is essen¬
tial although they are hidden behind
the curtain. Then you have to learn how
to sing. As in the Beijing Opera, there
are specialists for each role. I have
three or four assistants, but I'm the one
who does all the voices; this is very rare
in my profession.
It's astonishing that you can vary
your register so much! Could you do
the monkey's voice for me?
[Huang Hai-Tai bounced up and down,
laughing and making the piercing
squeals of a chimp, accompanied with
vivid expressions and gestures.]
During your shows, are you
allowed to create, to introduce new
elements?
Basically, no, because we perpetuate
an ancient and ritualized art form. Pro¬
duction is traditional and gestures are
codified, corresponding to a given pro¬
fession or social class. A mandarin
doesn't act or express himself like a ser¬
vant or a thief. But on the basis of what
my father taught me, I sometimes add
topical touches. I sometimes modify
dialogue or characterization. The audi¬
ence knows the repertoire by heart, and
if we didn't introduce a few changes, we
would be in danger of losing it.
Several scenes feature martial-arts
combat, pitting, for example, a
Buddhist monk against Taoists. The
puppets leap from the street into a
house, diving backwards through the
window as in a kung-fu movie. Is it
hard to get that right?
[He laughed] Jumping through a
window is the easiest part! But fighting,
especially with swords and clubs, is very
complicated and exacting. It takes
about three and a half years of practice
just to rehearse that!
In bunraku, the classic puppet
theatre of Osaka in Japan, the
musician and the narrator arevisible
at the side of the stage. Why are your
musicians hidden?
Because tradition requires it, but
also for aesthetic reasons. With us it is
the puppet that sings, and the puppets
lead the musicians. If the musicians
were visible, it would disturb the
smoothness of the performance. The
puppets' actions and the rhythm of the
singing set the tempo of the music, the
speed of the drumbeat.
[Huang Hai-Tai handed me two pup¬
pets dressed in brightly coloured cos¬
tumes: green, pink, red and blue bro¬
cade with appliqué, inlayed mirror
fragments andfur trimming. They had
aristocraticfaces and thin, delicatefin¬
gers.]
In the past the costumes were made
in southern China. We still have some
of the old puppets, but today, modern
costumes have been simplified and are
made in Taiwan. Unfortunately the
hands are no longer made of wood as
they used to be, but of plastic. You can
buy them anywhere for a small sum.
And what about the monkey?
The Beijing Opera monkey is very
stylized, while this one is more realistic.
Your theatre puts Confucianists,
Buddhists and Taoists on the stage.
Do you belong to one of these
religions?
I believe in all three and practise
them all!
Are you planning to perform
abroad again?
The heavens have allowed me to live
this long. I'd very much like to travel
some more!

How the gift idea started
by Claude Lévi-Strauss
*S
The custom of making New Year gifts has both a
simple and complicated history. It is simple enough if
wc merely think of the general meaning of the custom
itself, and examine, for example, Japan's New Year
wish, "O-ni wa soto fuku wa uchi" (Out, all demons!
Let good luck come in). Just as the old year should
take ill luck away with it, so the enrichment and hap¬
piness brought by the exchange of gifts on New Year's
Day are regarded as an omen, almost as a magic spell,
to ensure that the New Year will continue as joyfully
as it has begun.
It is more difficult to trace the exact origin of the
custom of New Year gifts in the Western world. The
ancient Celtic Druids had a ceremony which they per¬
formed on the day which corresponds to January 1.
They cut mistletoe, which was considered to be a mag¬
ical plant with protective powers from the oak trees,
and distributed it to the people. Hence the name given
in certain parts of France, until quite recently, to New
Year gifts: guy-Tan-neuf, corrupted sometimes into
aguignette (from the French gui: "mistletoe" and l'an-
neuf: "New Year").
In Borne during the second half of December and
the early part of January, festivals took place at which
gifts were exchanged; those offered in December were
usually of two kinds wax candles (which we have
adopted for our Christmas trees) and dolls made of
clay or some edible substance, which were given to
children. There were others, too, described in great
detail by Martial in his epigrams; Roman chroniclers
related that the patricians received gifts from their
plebeian dependents, and the Emperors from the cit¬
izens. Caligula took possession of his gifts in person
and spent the whole day in the vestibule of his palace
for this purpose.
Traces of their dual origin in pagan customs and
Roman rites seem long to have been preserved by
New Year gifts. Why otherwise would the Church
throughout the Middle Ages have tried in vain to
abolish them as a barbaric survival?
New Year gifts, as we know them today, are not so
much a relic of these popular customs as the democ¬
ratization of an aristocratic tradition.
It is well known that Elizabeth I of England relied
on her New Year gifts for her pocket money and the
L.
upkeep of her wardrobe; the archbishops and bishops
each used to give her from ten to forty pounds, while
she received dresses, skirts, silk stockings, garters,
cloaks, mantles and furs from her noblemen and such
presents as precious caskets, pots of ginger, orange-
flower and other confections from her doctors and her
apothecaries.
During the European Renaissance, metal pins
became a favourite form of present as they were then
a great novelty; until the fifteenth century, women had
used wooden pins to fasten their clothing. As for New
Year cards with pictures and ornamental texts, they
are known to have been in use from Europe to Japan.
To understand why the practice of exchanging New
Year gifts is so persistent and so widespread we must
look beyond these entertaining details for the under¬
lying significance of the custom. "The manner of giving
is more important than the gift", the saying goes, and
all peoples appear to believe that it is better to receive
objects as presents than to acquire them oneself, as if
the act of giving or receiving has added to the value
of the object. The Maoris of New Zealand believed
that a magic power, which they called hau, entered
into the present and created a permanent link between
the giver and the receiver. Similarly, the Roman
custom of offering gifts seems to have grown out of a
like belief. It originated in the offering of green
boughs to the Sabine king, Tatius, who shared the
royal power with Romulus. These boughs were taken
from the sacred wood of the goddess Strenia, and were
thus called strenae in Latin, from which is derived the
French étrennes.
Strenia was the goddess of strength. For the
Romans and for the Maoris alike, presents were
objects endowed with a special power through the act
of giving. From where did this power come? By the
exchange of gifts, often of mere token value, people
give expression in outward and visible form to the inner
spirit of community life spontaneous acceptance of
interdependence one with another. This annual New
Year festival at which flowers and sweets, ties and
illustrated cards change hands, is not then to be
derided. It is an occasion when all men realize that the
society in which they live is based on this very prin¬
ciple of give-and-take.
