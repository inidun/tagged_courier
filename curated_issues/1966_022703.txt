These graceful statuettes (modelled in terracotta and lightly enamelled) depict two
Chinese ladies of the T'ang dynasty (7-10th centuries A.D.). They figure among
325 illustrations in an unusual book on art, L'Amateur Chinois, des Han au XXe siècle.
by Michel Beurdeley, just published by the Office du Livre, Fribourg (Switzerland).
Other language editions will shortly appear in several countries (English edition :
The Chinese Collector through the Centuries). The author undertakes a new ap¬
proach to the study of Chinese art. Using ancient manuscripts, scholarly journals
and catalogues of Imperial and private collections, he presents each work in its authen¬
tic historical context and shows how China's family, religious and social life in¬
fluenced artists and the tastes of its art lovers and collectors during 2.000 years.

A far-reaching Unesco plan pre¬
sents an entirely new concept of the
importance of monuments and the
need to preserve them. As increas¬
ingly popular tourist attractions,
monuments have become a key
factor in the economic development
of many countries. Iran, Peru and
Turkey, for example, are all planning
to make greater use of their wealth
of monuments in programmes of
tourist development, and have asked
Unesco's help in co-ordinating these
projects. This stone relief in the
ruins of Persepolis, Iran, depicts
Darius, the ruler of the ancient Per¬
sian Empire (see page 35).

1967
INTERNATIONAL
TOURIST YEAR
The United Nations General Assembly has designated 1967 as Inter¬
national Tourist Year. In devoting this issue to international tourism,
and more especially to that new phenomenon of our times " Cultural
Tourism ", we have sought to show, in the words of Mr Arthur Haulot,
president of the International Union of Official Travel Organizations,
" the far stronger ties now drawing men everywhere closer to each
other and thereby achieving the cultural enrichment of all mankind. "
0 VER 115 million tourists,
180 million air passengers in 110
countries, 130 million cars in the world.
These figures for the year 1965 indi¬
cate the importance of the new econo¬
mic and social phenomenon represent¬
ed by international tourism.
The recent growth of tourism is
related to the increase in purchasing
power and in the practice of taking
holidays, the availability of cheaper
transport and the appearance of new
forms of transport which are faster
(aircraft) or more convenient (private
cars). In countries with a high stan¬
dard of living, tourism, both domestic
and international, is no longer the pre¬
rogative of a small minority; it has
become a mass phenomenon and is
increasing by about 15 per cent in rela¬
tion to a 10 per cent increase in family
income. In some countries, it accounts
for an average of 8 per cent of family
expenditure, not including transport
costs or secondary residences.
Inter-continental tourism depends
mainly on air transport and regional
tourism on the. private car. There has
been a continuous reduction in air
fares. Taking into account the increase
in charter flights, it can be estimated
that, in terms of constant prices, fares
have been reduced by more than half
in the last fifteen years. In the same
period, the duration of the flights has
also been reduced by more than half.
In the United States of America
almost 90 per cent of all journeys are
made in private cars, in spite of the
growth of domestic air travel, and in
Europe the mileage travelled has
tripled in the last ten years, while the
number of foreign cars entering the
country has increased six times in
Spain, 6.5 times in Denmark, 30 times
in Yugoslavia and even more in Bul¬
garia.
Europe's motorways grew by 680 km
(400 miles) in 1965, bringing its total
network to 8,000 km (5,000 miles). In
July 1965, the opening of the longest
road tunnel in the world (12 km;
8 miles) under Mont Blanc linked the
French and Italian road networks.

INTERNATIONAL TOURIST YEAR (Continued)
IT 5 million tourists abroad
in a single year
Within six months 350,000 vehicles
had passed through the tunnel.
As it grows, tourist traffic is becom¬
ing more diversified. Thanks to the
increased rapidity of air travel, every
country is now within the reach of the
regions from which the majority of the
tourists come. New tourist patterns
have been added to the traditional
ones as a result of the opening up of
new regions and of the desire of tour¬
ists to explore new countries.
Touring holidays are on the increase,
but resort holidays abroad are
increasing even more rapidly and the
countries which benefit most from this
are the Mediterranean countries and
the West Indies, because of the attrac¬
tion of sea and sun. Individual and
group travel are increasing at the same
time, without affecting each other's
growth. The number of tourists taking
winter sports holidays is doubling
every seven years, and more and more
people are taking more than one holi¬
day a year.
Special visits abroad particularly for
professional conventions and for sport¬
ing or cultural events are becoming
increasingly popular and more widely
distributed geographically. The same
is true of cruises; for example, bet¬
ween 1958 and 1963 the number of
passengers to Bermuda increased from
71,500 to 200,000, and to Greece from
22,300 to 68,200.
In 1965, the world's travellers spent
$57,300 million on international and
national tourism, according to a special
report on the development of tourism
published in October 1966 by the Or¬
ganization for Economic Co-operation
and Development. If the cost of trans¬
port were included the figure would be
about 30 per cent greater. Spending
on national tourism totalled $46,000
million.
More people went abroad in 1965
than ever before: nearly 6 million from
Britain, 3.5 million from France, almost
3 million from Italy and over 2.5 million
from the U.S.A. travelled overseas, to
give but four examples.
Relative expenditure on domestic
and international tourism varies ac¬
cording to the country; it is estimated,
for example, that, not including the
cost of transport, international tourism
accounts for 10 per cent of the travel
spending of residents in the U.S.A.,
40 per cent in the Netherlands, 50 per
cent in Argentina and nearly 80 per
cent in Belgium. In some countries,
the expenditure per inhabitant on
foreign travel is considerable: almost
$29 a year in Canada and Switzerland,
almost $24 in Belgium, almost $22 in
the Federal Republic of Germany,
about $12.5 in France and the United
Kingdom, and $11 in the United States;
in other countries, expenditure per
inhabitant is much smaller: $2.9 in Mo¬
rocco, §1 in Nigeria and $0.05 in In¬
dia (1).
Earnings from international tourism
sometimes represent a considerable
portion of the national income. They
represent, for example, more than
24 per cent of the national income in
Barbados, more than 7 per cent in
Austria, Ireland and Lebanon, more
than 6 per cent in Mexico, more than
5 per cent in Jamaica and Jordan,
almost 4 per cent in Puerto Rico,
2.6 per cent in the United Arab Repub¬
lic and 2 per cent in Morocco, while
in the United States of America they
represent about 0.2 per cent and in
the Federal Republic of Germany,
Japan, Sweden, Thailand and the Unit¬
ed Kingdom they are in the region of
1 per cent. These figures do not take
account of the multiplier effect of tour¬
ist spending; on that score, they
should in most cases be doubled.
International tourism can be a very
important source of foreign exchange;
it accounts for between 10 and 20 per
cent of the total visible and invisible
foreign exchange earnings in Greece,
Italy and Switzerland, and for more
than 40 per cent in Spain, where the
foreign exchange from tourists amount¬
ed to $919 million in 1964; in Panama
the profit balance from tourism halves
the balance-of-payments deficit. On
the other hand, tourism shows an
adverse balance in tourist-exporting
countries, particularly in the United
(JJ Most of the figures quoted in this and
succeeding paragraphs are based on the
estimate of the International Union of Official
Travel Organizations (IUOTO), and relate,
unless otherwise indicated, to 1963.

THE SPECTACULAR
GROWTH
OF INTERNATIONAL
TOURISM
The development of international
tourism has been spectacular. Bet¬
ween 1958 and 1963 the rise in tourist
expenditure was about 75 per cent.
The rise in 1964 is estimated at 15 per
cent. The distribution of international
tourism among the different regions of
the world, however, is very unequal,
as this table shows. It should be
noted that the table covers both tour¬
ism within each region and tourism
between regions.

Kingdom, the Federal Republic of
Germany and the United States of
America, where the deficit in respect
of tourism amounted in 1964 to some
$200 million, $600 million and $1,120
million respectively.
In Europe, tourists from other conti¬
nents accounted for only 15 per cent
of the 1963 total of 66 million (see table
page 6), and even so they have been
counted several times in the table
when, as happens very frequently, they
have visited several European coun¬
tries. Expenditure by United States
tourists in other countries, apart from
Canada and the frontier region of
Mexico, was $1,326 million, including:
$815 million in Europe and the Medi¬
terranean countries of Africa and the
Middle East;
$310 million in the Caribbean and
Central America;
$93 million in Asia and Australia;
$65 million in South America.
To this must be added transport
expenses, which benefited foreign
transport organizations to the extent
of some $635 million.
T,HESE figures show the
importance of Europe and North Am¬
erica in international tourism. It is these
areas that provide the great majority
of tourists. It is to these areas, too,
that by far the largest number of tour¬
ists go. In 1964 approximately 2 million
Europeans went outside Europe and 2
million tourists from the United States
went to foreign countries other than
Canada and the frontier region of
Mexico.
Spending on international tourism
in 1965 totalled $11,600 million, or the
equivalent of over 6 per cent of all
world exports of goods and merchan¬
dise. Earnings from international tour¬
ism were well over $7,000 million for
European countries among which Italy
remained in first place ($1,288 million;
up 24 per cent) closely followed by
Spain ($1,157 million; up 26 per cent)
and then France ($910 million; up 11
per cent).
The growth in the tourist movement
shows no sign of slackening. The
number of overseas visitors to the
United States rose from 516,000 in
1961 to 962,000 in 1964 and to over a
million in 1965. It was because of this
increase that the deficit in the coun-

Spain, with 34 million inhabitants, was visited by 15 million tourists from
abroad in the first nine months of 1966, thus beating its previous annual
record for tourist arrivals. In 1965, Spain earned the equivalent of
$1,157 million from tourism, or almost as much foreign currency as was brought
in by overseas trade. This tourist poster shows Salamanca's magnificent
palace, the Casa de las Conchas, named for the scallop shells on its façade.

try's tourism balance-of-payments did
not grow until 1964 despite the consid¬
erable rise in United States travel
abroad.
More than 1,200,000 persons visited
the U.S.S.R. in 1965. A vast building
programme was launched this year to
provide hotel and motel accomodation
for 50,000 extra visitors.
In Europe, the year 1964 saw a very
large rise over the previous year in
the number of foreign tourist arrivals
in certain countries (e.g., Portugal 100
per cent; Spain 33.4 per cent; Yugo¬
slavia 23 per cent; United Kingdom
11.8 per cent; and Turkey 10.7 per
cent.) On the other hand, there was
a decline of 4 per cent in Italy and
2 per cent in Greece. The number of
nights spent by foreign tourists rose,
in each of the years 1963 and 1964, by
an average of no more than 5 per
cent over the previous year, but this
figure gives a very inaccurate idea of
the development of tourism, because
supplementary means of accommoda¬
tion (camping, caravaning, residences
abroad, rooms in private houses, etc.),
which are developing very rapidly, are
often not included in the statistics. (It
is estimated that in France only 45 per
cent of the total number of nights
spent by visiting foreign tourists were
in hotels.)
Probably the fastest expanding feat¬
ure of domestic and international tour¬
ism nowadays is the camping holiday.
France now has 3,600 camping sites,
the U.K. has 3,000 and the Netherlands
2,800. Bulgaria, France, Turkey, Spain
and Yugoslavia are some of the coun¬
tries where hundreds of camping sites
and holiday camps are springing up.
Since 1963, many countries and nota¬
bly Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania, Spain
and Bulgaria, have launched large-
scale programmes to build, extend and
modernize their hotels. In Europe, the
country with the most hotel accommo¬
dation is the U.K. (just over 1 million
beds) with Italy almost neck. and neck,
followed at some distance by the Fed¬
eral Republic of Germany (700,000
beds). France's classified hotels have
600,000 beds, but France has more
supplementary accommodation than
any other country (1.5 million beds).
The African countries are making a
great effort to develop their tourism.
Measures have been enacted for the
protection and preservation of nature
and national parks in Dahomey, Ga¬
bon, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria. His¬
torical and cultural centres are under
the protection of the state in Daho¬
mey, Guinea and Nigeria. The devel¬
opment of handicrafts, folklore and
hunting is encouraged in Tunisia. Stu¬
dent exchanges and the establishment
of vacation colonies are likewise en¬
couraged in Dahomey, Gabon, Guinea,
Nigeria and Zambia.
Large-scale publicity campaigns in
foreign countries and programmes for
the construction of roads and expan¬
sion of air services have been under-

taken by most of the countries.
Through the press and radio, the popu¬
lation is becoming aware of the bene¬
fits brought by tourism. The countries
from which tourists come to Africa are,
in order of importance, France, the
United Kingdom, the United States, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Spain and Sweden. But inter-regional
tourism is little developed in Africa.
In the Pacific and East Asian region,
the number of tourists in 1964 was
16 per cent higher than in 1963. This
trend continued in 1965. The Inter¬
national Union of Official Travel Organ¬
izations estimates that in Australia
the number of visitors, which was
146,000 in 1963, rose to 180,000 in
1965, while in Hong Kong it rose from
ed Arab Republic being 23 per cent,
for Lebanon 30 per cent, for Jordan
18 per cent, for Syria 16 per cent and
for Israel' 8 per cent. There was a
decline, however, in Cyprus. The
amount of tourism within the region is
considerable. Foreign visitors from
outside the region come mainly from
the United States, the United Kingdom,
France and the Federal Republic of
Germany, plus a good number from
Greece and Iran. The annual rate of
growth during the period 1960-1964 for
such non-regional tourism was 16.8
per cent for the United Arab Republic,
18.1 per cent for Lebanon and 30 per
cent for Jordan.
In Central America, the number of
tourists to Mexico grew by 12 per cent
ductions no satisfactory progress has
been made in the 'staggering of holi¬
days and the extension of the tourist
season.
Reports on tourism in the first
months of 1966 show that the upswing
in international tourism has further
increased. Greece recorded a 20 per
cent rise in tourist revenue up to Sep¬
tember, and in Austria, U.K., Bulgaria,
Italy, Rumania, France and Spain, tour¬
ist arrivals were up to 24 per cent
higher than during the same period of
1965. The U.S.A. had 14 per cent more
visitors from overseas and 14 per cent
more Americans travelled to Europe.
With the popularization of internation¬
al tourism, tourist spending abroad
has long since lost its luxury character.

295,000 to 410,000, in Thailand from
195,000 to 250,000 and in Hawaii from
429,000 to 610,000. Many new hotels
are being built in Australia, China,
Hong Kong, New Zealand, the Philip¬
pines and Thailand. Many airports
have been built, particularly in Malay¬
sia and the Republic of Korea.
In addition, many countries in the
region are developing their national
parks and tourist regions, training
qualified hotel staff and organizing
tourist offices. Malaysia and the Philip¬
pines are engaged on important
tourism development plans. Studies of
the tourist market and the economic
gains that can be derived from inter¬
national tourism are being made by
most of the countries.
In the Near and Middle East, the
total number of arrivals of foreign tra¬
vellers was generally higher in 1964
than in 1963, the increase for the Unit
in 1963 and by a further 12 per cent in
1964. In 1964, for the first time, the
country's currency earnings from tour¬
ism, according to certain estimates,
exceeded $1,000 million. For South
America, Central America and the Car¬
ibbean together, the number of tour¬
ists from the United States rose by
10 per cent from 1963 to 1964, but their
expenditure seems to have risen by
only one per cent. In the opposite
direction, the number of tourists from
the area to the United States rose by
24 per cent and their expenditure by
just over 10 per cent.
One of the crucial problems of
tourism is the staggering of holidays.
Despite measures taken against holi¬
day congestion in many countries co¬
ordination of paid holidays in large
firms and administrations, timing of
school holidays, displacement of offi¬
cial holidays and off-season price re-
International tourism is important not
only from an economic standpoint, but
also from social, educational and cultur¬
al viewpoints. And it contributes to a
better understanding among nations.
International tourism, which has
developed most actively since 1961,
is likely to expand even more rapidly
in years to come. Factors which
should contribute to this development
are: increases in living standards and
leisure time in many countries, the
need for relaxation and cultural better¬
ment, the desire to escape from big
cities, demographic pressure which
tends to increase the proportion of
young people and of the active popu¬
lation among whom international tour¬
ists are drawn, availability of cheaper
transport, and the virtual elimination in m
many countries of red tape and admin- JJ
istrative barriers to the free move¬
ment of the tourist.

H,ow can money be raised for the restoration and protection of the world's
heritage of monuments ? A new Unesco plan offers an answer turn the
monuments into paying affairs. Unesco's plan, which is expected to have far-
reaching results, suggests that countries should turn their cultural assets into
economic ones by giving priority to monuments in programmes of tourist devel¬
opment, increased revenues from cultural tourism would stimulate economic
development and would provide the means to restore monuments and other
cultural treasures. Unesco has been studying the problem since 1964 and last
year, in answer to requests from Peru, Turkey and Iran, Unesco specialists went
to help these countries in drawing up co-ordinated projects for monument pro¬
tection and tourist development. Unesco is studying how funds for such
projects can be obtained from regional and international organizations and through
the UN. Development Programme, since the tourist industry is seen as a key
factor in economic development.

The best preserved
theatre of ancient
Greece Is at
Epidaurus in the.
Peloponnesus.
It was built
in the 4th century
B.C. by the
architect and
sculptor Polycletus.
Each summer a
Greek classic-
theatre festival is
held at Epidaurus.
HE cultural importance of
monuments has been acknowledged by
everyone. But until recently monu¬
ments were classed as a sort of luxury
and it was felt that the large sums
needed for their preservation should
be used for more urgent and essential
tasks. In an exceptional case the
international campaign to save the
monuments of Nubia Unesco was
able to call on international generosity
to help save a rich ensemble of artistic
and archaeological wealth in a region
about to be engulfed by the waters of
the Aswan High Dam.
The success of the Unesco-sponsor-
ed Nubian campaign stimulated world¬
wide interest in the protection of mon¬
uments.
Now, Unesco has been led to
reconsider the whole problem and to
examine whether some economic value
can be attached to historic monuments,
irrespective of their immense cultural
significance. These studies have
shown that the preservation of mon¬
uments can contribute to economic
development since monuments are a
tourist attraction and thus a potential
economic asset, which should be
developed.
Increased leisure time is giving a
strong impetus to tourism and to the
tourist earnings of many countries. In
the developing countries particularly
tourism can stimulate economic growth
and earn much-needed foreign curren¬
cy. Thus investments in the preserva¬
tion of monuments can be made in
conjunction with investments for tour¬
ist development and thus form an inte¬
gral part of national plans for economic
development.
Unesco seeks to promote the pre¬
servation of cultural property and to
make it play its full role in the life
of the community. If it is recognized
that monuments can do much to pro¬
mote tourism, their preservation will
become easier and knowledge and
appreciation of them will be vastly
enhanced.
Unesco encourages the development
of tourism because tourism contri¬
butes in innumerable ways to education,
culture and international understanding.
When projects for the preservation of
monuments are included in program¬
mes of economic development, nation¬
al and even world-wide attention is
focussed on these monuments, and
every section of the community is
encouraged to give a greater place
in daily life to the values symbolized
by the world's cultural heritage.

Higher standards of living and the
modernization of transport are giving
a continual impetus to the tourist
industry. Under the impact of the
spread and improvement of education
tourism is also taking new forms. It
is no longer motivated solely by the
urge "to get away from it all"; increas¬
ingly it reflects a desire to use loisure
for cultural enrichment. The restora¬
tion and display of historic monuments
would seem to be the ideal way of
satisfying and encouraging these
aspirations.

understanding of the world. Today,
monuments are an increasingly popu¬
lar tourist attraction, offering people a
new incentive to visit other countries
for cultural reasons. They give the
visitor from abroad a broader and
clearer image of a country and he may
be able to judge its people better if
he has a more discerning grasp of
their history. Monuments thus help to
eliminate prejudices which are so
often the cause of ideological and
racial conflicts.
Monuments also play a key role in
developing "long distance" tourism,
drawing people from the leading "tour¬
ist exporting countries" of Europe and
North America to far away places. The
flow of tourists to countries like India,
Iran, Peru and Turkey is ¡argely due
to the attraction of their national monu¬
ments. Nowadays, too, people in¬
creasingly take advantage of business
trips to visit outstanding monuments
and sites.
A growing number of tourist resorts
are being created close to monuments,
in areas far from the beaten track
which have nothing else to offer the
tourist. In 1958, nearly 5,500 tourists
were drawn to Cambodia, just to visit
the magnificent temples of Angkor.
Assuming an average stay of two days
and an average expenditure of $100
by each visitor, it can be seen that
the temples brought Cambodia almost
$550,000, and this was achieved when
Cambodia had no special tourist deve¬
lopment projects, only limited means
of transport, no access road and a
single hotel.
Art and history also display a simi¬
lar drawing power in highly developed
tourist areas. In 1962, hotels in
and around Florence registered over
560,000 guests ; the same year, the
city's famous Uffizzi Gallery was visit¬
ed by 513,000 people who paid a total
of $240,000 to admire its treasures.
There can be no doubt that the pri¬
mary tourist attraction in Florence is
the city's rich artistic heritage.
The advantages to be gained from
displaying historic monuments and
sites are so considerable that inter¬
national programmes are now being
arranged. Mexico, Honduras and Gua¬
temala are jointly planning tours whose
main attractions are visits to each
country's historic remains and parti¬
cularly those of the extraordinary pre-
Columbian civilizations.
T he exploitation of historical
remains for tourist development pro¬
grammes that provide means of access
and accommodation, coupled with ade¬
quate publicity, will automatically
attract more tourists, regardless of the
distance they have to travel. Distance,
which used to be a major obstacle to
international travel, is much less so
nowadays thanks to the modernization
of transport, a reduction in air fares,
and facilities for group travel and the
chartering of aircraft, which bring air
travel within the reach of an ever
larger number of people.
In 1958, 60,000 tourists visited Thai¬
land whose chief attraction is its innu¬
merable monuments and temples.
Thailand expects to receive 230,000
tourists in 1968, at the end of its ten-
year tourist development programme,
and it calculates that they will spend
about $35 million an increase of 300
per cent over the $8 million spent by
tourists in Thailand in 1958. In the light
of a general growth in world tourism,
Thailand's expectations are realistic,
and one indication that its plan is go
ing to schedule is that already in 1963
it received 134,000 tourists.
Historic remains can be used to
create entirely new tourist trends and
also to bring new life to economically
depressed areas. In the Soviet Union
this has led to the launching of a new
tourist industry in Armenia by restor¬
ing many early Christian churches.
The majority of tourists choose to
visit seaside and mountain resorts. As
new attractions, monuments not only
draw more visitors, but also help to

TURKEY
AiREAS of Asia Minor once
ranked among the most famous and pros¬
perous places of the ancient world, only
to become almost forgotten lands as the
tides of history flowed away from them.
These places the western and southern
regions of present-day Turkey are now
being rediscovered by a growing number
of tourists.
The pleasant climate and the exceptional
natural beauties of these regions are not
the only reasons for their increasing popu¬
larity. Their outstanding tourist attraction
is a wealth of ancient monuments Hittite,
Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Otto¬
man.
Along the routes followed by the modern
tourist lie remains of cities with illustrious
names: Heracles of Latmos, Miletus, Did-
yma, Nysa, Hierapolis and Ephesus, whose
great temple of Artemis was hailed by the
ancients as one of the Seven Wonders of
the World. In the valley of the Meander,
historic Aphrodisias, a capital of the arts,
is being restored (see the Unesco Courier,
January 1965). Its Roman stadium with
30,000 places is one of the best preserved
in the world. These regions possess an

MOTELS FROM
ANCIENT CARAVANSERAIS
Turkey plans to repair many of the ancient
caravanserais along its highways and to
convert them into modern motels. Some
of these caravanserais, built between the
12th and the 15th centuries, have great
historical worth and architectural beauty.
But through neglect, the erosion of time
and weather and the use of their walls
as stone quarries by local people, many
of these buildings have passed from dila¬
pidation to almost total ruin. With their
conversion into motels they will once again
fulfil their centuries-old purpose of provid¬
ing shelter for travellers and their convey¬
ances (with the automobile replacing the
traditional camel and mule). The plan to
adapt the caravanserais to modern needs,
while preserving their characteristic appear¬
ance, will help to enlarge the network of
hotels in areas to which the Turkish Go¬
vernment has given priority for tourist
development. Above, engraving of the

incomparable network of antique theatres
which could be restored and revived as
centres for cultural spectacles.
On the Cappadocian plateau of Central
Turkey is the region of Urgüp, long re¬
nowned for its rock-hewn churches. At
Urgüp, the erosion of wind and water has
carved out rocky valleys and left them
filled with cones and pyramids of stone
in which at different times men have made
their homes and excavated tombs, shrines
and churches (see the Unesco Courier,
September 1958).
With Unesco's co-operation, Turkey has
drawn up a special programme which in¬
tegrates the protection of monuments with
the development of tourism. Special prio¬
rity is given to the coastal regions of Izmir
and Antalya and to the area of Urgüp. The
plan proposes large-scale investment in
road improvement and the expansion of the
hotel network, as well as measures for the
preservation and protection of the historic
monuments which are a major asset of
Turkey's expanding tourist industry.

At Pamukkalé, near Izmir, in western Turkey, the architectural
splendours of the ruined Roman city of Hierapolis are rivalled
by the beauty which nature has created close at hand.
"Niagaras" of white stone (opposite page), formed by the
calcareous waters of thermal springs, flow down the hillside,
on which they have formed huge natural basins. The springs,
which in ancient times were visited by people from all parts
of Asia Minor, have almost dried up. But plans are being
made to regenerate them and thus restore to life a grandiose
spectacle of nature.
Termessos, an ancient Greco-Roman city set in the mountains
that dominate the plain of Antalya and the Mediterranean coast,
is sometimes called "The Machu Picchu of Turkey". Much
of the site has still to be cleared and restored, including
the magnificent Roman theatre (above), one of many surviving
stadiums in this part of Turkey one of the most famous
crossroads of the ancient world. The province of Antalya,
which looks across to Cyprus, has over 90 recognized
archaeological sites, but these are believed to be only a
fraction of the sites that are likely to be discovered in this area.

CULTURAL TOURISM (Continued)
Monumental success stories
in Europe, America and the Middle East
relieve pressure on already popular
resorts.
Most countries where tourism is
highly developed now encourage peo¬
ple to visit their new tourist areas. An
increase in visits to Spain's great
centres of art and monuments such
as Granada, Seville, Pamplona and
Madrid, has helped to relieve pressure
on coastal resorts in places like the
Costa Brava, which has an exception¬
ally heavy tourist influx in the summer
season. Mexico too is encouraging
people to visit not only its seaside
resorts, but also its outstanding mon¬
uments, thereby increasing the length
of visits and spreading tourist spend¬
ing over more of the country. Bulgaria
is using monuments to create "inter¬
nal tourist industries", thus drawing
off some of the pressure on the Black
Sea resorts, in particular the town of
Plovdiv.
T,
16
he staggering of holidays
is another problem that preoccupies
the tourist countries. Unlike holidays
spent in seaside and mountain resorts,
tourism based on monuments and his¬
toric sites is relatively unaffected by
the weather. Tourist organizations
are now taking advantage of the
opportunities thus offered to launch a
big drive for out-of-season tourism. In
Europe, where people used to visit
the Mediterranean only during the
summer season, many take advantage
of special facilities (longer holidays,
out-of-season rates for hotels and
transport, cheap cruises) now offered
at other times of the year, particularly
at Christmas and Easter, solely to see
the rich monumental heritage of this
part of the world.
The tourist industry can play an im¬
portant, sometimes vital, role in a
nation's economy (see article page 5).
In 1965, world revenue from interna¬
tional tourism totalled well over
$11,000 million, while world expendi¬
ture on national tourism was about
$46,000 million. These figures com¬
bined, which represent about five per
cent of private consumer spending
throughout the world, show the
economic impact of tourism today.
International tourism is often one
of the major exports of the economical¬
ly developing countries, and one of
their chief sources of foreign currency
earnings, with a capacity for develop¬
ment well above that of most other
economic activities.
The impact of tourist spending on
different sectors of the economy varies
considerably according to whether
visits last for less than 24 hours or for
longer. Revenue from the day excur¬
sionist is by no means negligible. The
University of Colorado (U.S.A.) has
calculated that 100,000 visitors who
stay an average of two hours in a
town spend as much as $350,000.
Longer visits are naturally more pro¬
fitable to monuments and sites and
to the local economy because of
greater spending on hotels, restau¬
rants, shops and local travel.
Tourist resorts therefore try to
induce visitors to prolong their stay
by offering all kinds of attractions
museums, theatres, historical, cultural
and art exhibitions, folklore program¬
mes and visits to natural beauty spots.
Ri evenue from both kinds of
tourism is in any case considerable and
a large proportion comes from visits to
monuments and art centres. In Italy,
for instance, receipts from visits to
monuments and museums rose from
$3,770,000 in 1956, to over $5 million
in 1964. In the same period, Italian
spending on domestic tourism increas¬
ed from $84 million to $140 million.
Domestic tourism in the U.S.A., which
represented 5.8 per cent of consumer
spending in 1950, rose to over 6 per
cent in 1963. Visits to U.S. national
parks increased more than threefold
between 1950 and 1963 from 33
million to over 102 million annually.
These figures show that people
are spending more and more on
leisure time pursuits, and that increas¬
ingly these activities are inspired by
an interest in history and art.
Spending on cultural tourism, how
ever, still represents only a small
proportion of global tourist expend¬
iture, which benefits the wide range
of industries and activities that are
needed to satisfy the multiple needs
of the modern tourist.
The expansion of tourism leads to
development and modernization of the
hotel, restaurant and retail trades.
Farm produce finds new markets,
local traditions and folklore are pre¬
served and crafts and industries stimu¬
lated. Local production and activities
are given a new impetus, either rapidly
from the direct effects of tourism or
indirectly over a longer period. As a
result traditional economic structures
are radically transformed.
u ps and downs in the an¬
nual cycle followed by tourism are
well known, and ways can be found to
adapt to these seasonal fluctuations,
particularly by giving greater import¬
ance to monuments in tourist develop¬
ment programmes. Studies show that
the tourist industry is actually in a
stronger and more stable position than
some consumer goods which also are
subject to seasonal variations.
Stimulation of the tourist industry
by making more use of monuments
to attract visitors helps to create new
jobs and a greater demand for man¬
power. This can be met by the local
population and, if need be, by perma¬
nent or seasonal immigration from
overcrowded or economically-depress¬
ed areas.
The University of Tennessee and
the First National Bank of Hawaii
have calculated that for every thou¬
sand visitors staying in hotels in a
given region of the U.S.A., 279 jobs
are created in the tourist trade itself
and 107 in activities indirectly related
to tourism. For every thousand cam¬
pers, however, only 57 jobs are
created in the tourist trade and only
32 in auxiliary activities.
Rapid industrialization in developing
countries often disrupts traditional
social and economic structures and
sets off an exodus of workers to the

About one-quarter of Jordan's foreign
currency earnings come from the foreign
tourists who visit its historic sites.
One of the most famous is the city of
Petra, built In the 3rd century B.C. as
the capital of the Nabathean Empire.
Here, glimpsed between the walls
of a narrow gorge leading to the
city, is one of Petra's noble buildings.
towns, particularly farm hands from
economically-depressed areas. This
in turn leads to overcrowding, under¬
employment and often to pitifully low
living conditions. Promotion of the
tourist trade through the restoration
and display of monuments may be the
means, and in some countries the only
means, of counteracting this drift to
the cities.
The protection of plants, animals,
beauty spots and monuments is often
covered by a single set of laws. As
part of the preservation, restoration
and display of monuments, specific
laws should be passed to protect them
against damage from natural causes
or by man.
A long with the restoration of
monuments, efforts are needed to
create a harmony between monuments
and their surroundings, and protective
zones should be established. In
France all construction is controlled
within a radius of 500 metres (one-
third of a mile) of any building classed
as an artistic or historic monument.
Great care is now taken by town
planners to protect and enhance
monuments and sites. The layout of
the site and its approaches, and the
design of garages, information offices
and houses for caretakers and guides
should not only blend harmoniously
with a monument, but also accentuate
its attractions.
When large sums are invested in
programmes of preservation and re¬
storation the prospects of their amor¬
tization need to be carefully calculated.
Charges on loans from national and
international financial bodies are fairly
heavy. The usual rate of interest is
5 per cent, and repayment has to be
made within seven years. Estimates
made before a programme is launched
should confirm that income from tourist
development will permit the State to
repay its debt, plus interest, within
prescribed time limits. Unesco esti¬
mates of profits on tourist investment
relating to a project in Peru (see
page 27) have shown that the exploit¬
ation of monuments under tourist
development programmes can produce
big returns.
Examples abound of development
programmes which, after being quickly
amortized, have earned handsome pro¬
fits. A classic instance is the resto
ration of Williamsburg, Virginia
(U.S.A.). In 1926 a project was laun¬
ched to restore this famous site of
American Revolutionary times and to
stimulate a revival of the town and
its neighbourhood.
Large-scale restoration and exten¬
sive excavations have since been
carried out. Nearly 600 modern build¬
ings have been demolished, nearly
200 old ones rebuilt on their original
foundations and nearly 100 restored.
Today in the heart of the modern
city of Williamsburg in an area about
a mile long and half a mile wide the
image of an American city of 200 years
ago has been recaptured.
In 1960 nearly 450,000 people visited
the monuments of Williamsburg and
several hundred thousand the town
itself. In 1964 there were almost a
million visitors.
Tourism in Williamsburg employs
1,800 persons, excluding the teams of
archaeologists who sometimes work
there, and other persons employed
in related activities directly or indirectly
connected with the Williamsburg site.
Ri estoration work is carried
out by two organizations: Colonial
Williamsburg Inc., and its subsidiary,
Williamsburg Restoration Inc.
The income of Colonial Williamsburg
Inc. increased from $2,068,000 in 1960
to $2,776,000 in 1964. The gross
income of Williamsburg Restoration
Inc., which pays the same taxes
as a private undertaking, rose from
$7,493,000 in 1960 to $10,059,000 in
1964. Local taxes paid by these organ¬
izations in 1960 totalled $254,000.
In 1964 the property taxes they paid
(as owners of nearly 16 per cent of
land in the town) represented nearly
30 per cent of municipal revenue from
this source. The income of both
organizations finances the educational
programme of Colonial Williamsburg
Inc.
Williamsburg Restoration Inc. owns
and runs numerous lodging houses,
inns and other tourist enterprises. Its
total reserve fund rose from over
$47 million in 1960 to over $51 million
in 1964.
In 1965, Spain developed a number
of sites and monuments in connexion

of Valcarlos, Jaca, Pamplona, Estella,

da, Burgos, Fromista, Leon, Astorga,

In Jordan a seven-year plan for
developing tourism (1963-1970) is
restoring and preserving the holy
places and archaeological sites which
are the country's chief tourist attrac¬
tion. Over 900,000 Jordanian dinars
($327,000) is being spent on mon¬
uments at Petra, Jarash, Karak, Cho-
bak, Ajilun, Godara, Sebastye, Iraq and
Amir, and on the Omayah Palace and
the citadel of Amman.
18
ITALY, Greece and Egypt
have used restoration programmes
and publicity campaigns to increase
the well established tourist appeal of
their historical and artistic treasures.
Across the Atlantic, Miami's large
tourist centre now offers as a major
attraction the restored cloisters of the
Sacremenia monastery.
Some regions and cities owe their
fame as tourist centres to a single
outstanding monument. The Alhambra
in Granada (Spain) was seen by half
a million tourists in 1963, but far fewer
(350,000) visited the town itself.
Among other celebrated monuments
which draw a constant stream of tour¬
ists are the Taj Mahal and the Ajanta
Caves in India and the temples of
Kyoto and Nara in Japan.
In all parts of the world, from Mexi¬
co, Peru and Guatemala to Thailand,
Cambodia and Iran, monuments contri¬
bute enormously to the promotion of
tourism. If these cultural resources
were exploited more vigorously, they
could become a key factor in the
future development of the tourist
industry.

Sparking tomorrow's
tourist explosion
e
PERU
P eru is giving high priority
to tourism in its national economic and
social development plan for 1967-70.
The Peruvian Government has
announced that action to promote tour¬
ism will include:
improvement of roads, health ser¬
vices, sanitation and telecommunica¬
tions in touristic regions, and develop¬
ment of local crafts;
protection and preservation of
Peru's cultural and touristic heritage;
construction, expansion and opera¬
tion of hotels, restaurants and lodging
houses and training for hotel staff,
guides and other personnel. These
measures aim at the development of
three regional touristic areas compris¬
ing: Puno, Cuzco, Machu Picchu and
Quillabamba; Trujillo and Chan Chan;
Callejón de Huaylas .and Chavin.
Most people think of Peru primarily
as a land where Renaissance Spain
imposed its domination on a people
called the Incas. They often consider
the whole of Peru as Inca, as having
had an Inca population, Inca princes
and Inca rule. It is true that the Incas
produced a princely dynasty in the last
two centuries of pre-Colombian times,
and have left a profound mark on
popular imagination because of their
contacts with the Spaniards.
The true history of Peru, however,
began ten thousand years ago. Few
are familiar with this history and it is
not easy to retrace since no written
documents exist on which to recon
struct it. Ruins and the remains of
monuments and works of art are the
only evidence to indicate the movement
of populations and the space and time
in which they evolved.
Few people are aware that Peru is
one of the handful of places in which
the very ancient cultures of the world
originated. In this sense, the history
of pre-Columbian Peru, like that of
Mexico, is quite unlike the history of
other American regions whose cultural
contribution was insignificant in pre-
Columbian times. For thousands of
years, Peru has been a cultural centre
where agriculture and a settled existen¬
ce developed almost at the same time
as they did in the Near East, some
eight thousand years ago.
Eight thousand years ago, the Peru¬
vians were already living in villages,
fishing and raising manioc. Six thou¬
sand years ago, they were growing
beans, and five thousand years ago
were using cotton for their clothes,
and creating their remarkable art of
weaving which reached its height some
two thousand years ago and was to
gain the admiration of the world.
Four thousand years ago, the Peru¬
vians began to build complex stone
structures faced with clay, which in¬
cluded most of the architectural fea¬
tures subsequently embodied in the
great buildings of classical Peru.
Some three thousand five hundred
years ago, the inhabitants of the Peru¬
vian coastal strip began to grow maize
and to produce pottery. The art of
weaving developed and, about two
thousand five hundred years ago, the
great structures of the Chavin culture
adorned with carved stones and floor
tiles were built. The Chavin culture
left at least a hundred buildings of
importance along the coast and in the
Andes valleys. These are mostly
hidden under mounds of rubbish and
are often overlooked even by the
specialist. Like the structures of still
earlier cultures, they are . of great
value for an understanding of the
history of mankind just as are the
Mexican buildings of the Olmec, Ven¬
ta, Monte Alban and other cultures.
The fact that an American monument
was built 3,500 years ago whereas
comparable monuments were erected
5,500 years ago in the Near East in no
way diminishes the significance of the
New World structures. Comparisons
have to be made within the context of
the relative chronology and not the
absolute chronology of dates, i. e. the
comparison should be between the
achievements of peoples living on the
same cultural and technological level,
such as the early stages' of agriculture
and the Bronze Age.
The end of the Chavin culture in
Peru coincided with the development
of the first major regional cultures,
Mochica in the North, Lima in the cen¬

about 500 and 800 A.D. when a phen¬
omenon occurred, the origins of
which are obscure and which pre-
historians describe as "the impact of
the Tiahuanaco culture". Following
what may have been a climatic and
hydrological crisis the regional coastal
cultures appear to have declined and
this seems to have been followed by
an invasion of tribes from the Andes.
As early as the twelfth century,
however, the regional cultures took
shape again and the last three pre-
Columbian centuries seem to have
been Peru's Golden Age. The Chimu
princes dominated in the North, with
Chan Chan as their capital. Lima and
the central coastal region were domi¬
nated by the Chancay culture, while
the South East was held by the Chin¬
cha, lea and Nazca princes. Peru
entered on a period of urban life and
intensive agriculture based' on major
irrigation systems. The population
increased greatly and may have reach
ed 10 millions which is almost that of
present-day Peru.
It is possible that a new crisis was
at the root of the Inca conquests.
The history of the conquests achieved
by the dynasty of the Cuzco princes
(a dynasty which was short-lived in
comparison with the long history of
pre-Hispanic Peru) is not readily
understandable except on the assump¬
tion that the power of the coastal
principalities had again declined.
The gigantic effort made by the
Inca princes to create and organize
an empire covering some two million
square kilometres (nearly 800,000
square miles) is a prodigious exploit
if we consider that its authors had no
knowledge of writing, that they had
neither chariots nor draught animals,
and that their metal industry was only
in its earliest stages. The achieve¬
ment of the Incas in creating on the
basis of Cuzco the only American
empire deserving of the name is an
astonishing feat and one worthy of
admiration. (The Inca empire is often
compared with the Aztec empire, but
the administrative and military organiz¬
ation which the Incas imposed upon
their conquests have few points in
common with the Aztec wars.)
The assimilation of the Incas by the
Spanish conquerors was slow and
difficult. This process has been sev¬
erely criticized by many historians and
sociologists but, in order to be
correctly understood and appraised, it
should be set in the anthropological
and cultural context in which it took
place. In the sixteenth century, two
worlds came into violent contact, one
living as in the Egypt or Mesopotam¬
ia of six thousand years ago, the
other inspired by the profound Chris¬
tian faith of the Spaniards mixed with
new ideas imported from the Near
East as a result of Arab invasions
and of the Renaissance. Clearly, a
new evolution resulting from this tragic

Peru's share of world receipts from international tourism in 1965 was a mere 1 /730th.
In Peru's national plan for economic development for 1967-1970 a high priority is given to tourism.
Measures to promote tourism will include road improvement and an expansion of the hotel network.
Priority is given to the region of Cuzco, the former seat of the Inca Empire and one of
Peru's most remarkable cities. Built at a height of nearly 3,500 metres (11,500 feet)
at the head of an Andean valley, Cuzco is now linked with Lima, the capital, by air.

meeting could only emerge with diffi¬
culty. The cultural gulf that existed
between the two peoples explains the
reluctance of the indigenous popula¬
tion to change its ways of life and
thought, and this gave rise to repres¬
sion and excesses.
During some eight to nine thousand
years of pre-Columbian history and
four centuries of Spanish domination,
Peru has acquired an architectural and
monumental heritage of an importance
which has scarcely been realized by
most people. This heritage, which has
been neither studied nor made known
systematically and scientifically, is
therefore more familiar to plunderers
of tombs and treasure hunters than to
even the cultured reader.
Some 50,000 or so pre-Columbian
and Hispanic archaeological sites exist
in Peru. This architectural heritage
ranges from very small sites which,
nevertheless, are of value for studying
the history of mankind, to large-sized
towns. The world has few antique
cities which are almost intact and
cover an area of over five square kilo¬
metres, like Paestum in Italy, for
example. Yet Peru has several that
cover even larger areas.
Stone monuments are to be found
side by side with vast complexes of
unbaked adobe, one of which the
Temple of the Moon at Moche com¬
prises more than twenty million bricks.
The Andes conceal innumerable stone
cities with buildings ranging from the
monolithic structures of the Incas to
the two or three-storey buildings set
up by other civilizations. Even in the
Amazonian fringe of the Andes, vast
cities lie hidden under the tropical
vegetation.
The passion for building continued
during the Hispanic period, though
monasteries and churches then replac¬
ed the polytheistic temples. The Cuzco
school of painting and wood-carving,
for example, may be compared to that
of Quito, and the tapestries of Caja-
marca introduce an original note which
combines Indian craftsmanship with
the inspiration of Rubens and Euro¬
pean motifs.
The monumental heritage of Peru is
obviously of considerable scientific,
cultural and aesthetic interest. It is
a possession which, through touristic
development, could be made to contri¬
bute appreciably to the country's
economy. The study and protection
of this heritage which is essential for
its fuller development, will be warmly
welcomed by scientific circles through¬
out the world.
Peru, with 3,000 kilometres (nearly
2,000 miles) of Pacific coast, the
Andean mountain chain including peaks
over 6,000 metres (20,000 feet) high
and the Amazonian jungle, is one of
the most varied and fascinating parts
of the South American continent.

Peru has not only its wealth of artistic
and cultural treasures, including
innumerable Indian and Spanish-Indian
monuments to offer the tourist, but
also the grandiose scenic beauty
of the Andes. The people who live
'm the valleys and high plateaux
of the Andes maintain their
ancient traditions and folklore. Right,

spectacle of the vast tropical forests
which cover a large part of the country,
and which are still not completely
explored. Its flora and fauna are
among the richest and most unusual in
the world.
Travel in the interior is only possible
by air or along the giant rivers that
cross this region. Iquitos, the largest
town in Peruvian Amazonia, is linked
with Lima by a daily airline flight, and
to the Atlantic by regular boats sail¬
ing up the Amazon river.
Trujillo, on the Pacific coast, is a
pleasant town with fine churches,
attractive houses with elegant balcon¬
ies and windows, and handsome
parks and squares. Huanchaco, where
the fishermen to this day use curious
boats made of reeds, is a picturesque
little port. But the main tourist
attraction of Trujillo is its proximity to
Chan Chan, the ruins of the fabulous
capital of the Chimu empire; and to
Moche, with its two enormous adobe
pyramids.
Not only the Trujillo region but the
whole of the Peruvian coast has much
to offer the tourist, and is reasonably
well equipped to receive visitors. It
is crossed by the Pan American High¬
way, and has an adequate network of
hotels. In its valleys still stand many
pre-Columbian monuments: at Sechin,
Panamarquilla, Cerro Blanco, Carbo¬
nera, Huancarpon, El Paraíso, Cajamar-
quilla, Tambo de Mora, Tambo Colo¬
rado, Haytara among other places;
those at Pachacamac, near Lima, have
been partially restored.
Seventeen international airlines link
Lima, the capital with other South
American capitals and with North
America, Europe and Asia, via Japan.
From Callao, the port of Lima, ships
sail to all parts of the world. Three
airlines provide services on internal
routes, and a road and a railway line
connect Lima overland with the Sierra.
The jagged peaks of the Andes give
the Sierra a grandiose scenic beauty.
The climate of this region with its
valleys and plateaux inhabited at alti¬
tudes of up to 4,500 metres (14,500
feet), is dry and healthy, hot in the
daytime and cold at night. The
western slopes have constant sun¬
shine; the eastern slopes, exposed to
tropical rainfall, are covered with jungle
up to an altitude of almost 3,000 metres
(10,000 feet).
The people have preserved their
language and customs, their tradi¬
tional dress and their crafts; and the
folklore, both Indian and Spanish, is
remarkably rich and varied. The region
also has thermal springs, numerous
waterfalls and lakes (including Lake
Titicaca, the world's highest navigable
lake) and excellent facilities for sports
(fishing, hunting, climbing).
Lastly and most important, It Is in
the Sierra that the largest number of

i

monuments and architectural remains
have survived. In addition to the Inca
and pre-lnca remains, art treasures of
the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries are
numbered in hundreds.
The Puno-Cuzco-Machu Picchu-Quil-
labamba region, the heart of the Inca
empire, also possesses monuments of
exceptional interest. The world famous
Inca citadel of Machu Picchu not only
merits the conservation work at pre¬
sent being done by the Peruvian
authorities, but would justify the spend¬
ing of far larger sums. Other archaeo¬
logical monuments of outstanding
interest in this region include those
at Ollantaytambo, Sacsahuaman, Ken-
ko, Pisac, Sicuani, Sillustani and Chin¬
cheros.
Cuzco, a veritable museum city,
was both the capital of the Inca
empire and the first centre from which
Spanish culture spread through Peru.
Here the elegant refinement of 18th
century Spanish architecture and art
blends to remarkable effect with the
dignified severity of Inca building, and
this has made Cuzco one of the most
frequented tourist centres of Peru. By
following the examples of Toledo in
Spain and Siena, in Italy, it would be
possible, at relatively little cost, to
reorganize Cuzco touristically and to
give new life to the city.
Several planes a day fly from Lima
to Cuzco, where a new airport is now
being built. There are also roads and
a railway line which pass through
magnificent mountain scenery and
cross the Cordillera at very high alti¬
tudes. The Anticona road pass, for
example, is nearly 5,000 metres (16,000
feet) high. A network of hotels spans
the region; new ones are being built
and more are planned. Yet this area
is still one of the poorest and least
developed in Peru.
The second locality of the Sierra
earmarked for tourist development,
the Callejón de Huaylas, is a long,
broad green valley with an excellent
climate, bounded by two imposing
mountain chains, the Cordillera Blanca,
and the Cordillera Negra. The road
from the coast is hard going, and the
scenery, though grandiose, is bleak
and bare until it dips down into the
Callejón, where the traveller suddenly
comes upon a spectacle calling to
mind the smiling valley of James Hil¬
ton's "Lost Horizon" a gay welcom¬
ing scene, fertile and well-watered
country and a prosperous people.
However, the most remarkable pre-
Columbian monuments of the region,
those of Chavin, lie some distance
away from this fertile valley. There
. are no prospects of development, so
that the sole means of rescuing the
people from their present destitution
would be to develop this historical
site as a tourist centre. The archaeo¬
logical and architectural value of

Peru's rich museum collections and particularly that of the Anthropological
Museum in Lima, afford the tourist an opportunity to admire the astonishing
originality and diversity of art created by the ancient Peruvian civilizations.

Chavin warrants restoration work on
a larger scale than that now being
carried out.
The climate, the scenery and the
folklore of the Sierra are first-class
tourist assets, but it is none the less
the stupendous monuments of Peru¬
vian history that are the country's
most precious resources. The funds
needed for the restoration, protection
and display of these monuments repre¬
sent only a fraction of the cost of
implementing the tourist development
plan as a whole. Since most of the
monuments are still completely un-
cared for, a prey to wind and weather
and to the depredations of art plun¬
derers, prompt action is called for.
The Peruvian authorities are aware
of the danger and commendable efforts
are being made to cope with the
situation; but they do not go far
enough. The tourist development plan
provides an opportunity for action on
a large scale.
One of the measures proposed is
to establish a technical school for
research and for training personnel in
the study, conservation and restoration
of monuments. The Peruvian authori¬
ties also intend to draw up an inventory
of historical monuments and sites,
showing an order of priority. Unesco
has been asked to assist in carrying
out these projects.
A Unesco survey made at the
request of the Peruvian government
indicated that it would be well worth
while investing $38 million for the
development of Peru's tourist facilities
(communications, hotels, restoration
and display of monuments). This sum,
plus bank interest estimated at $7.7
million would increase the country's
revenue by $385 million within ten
years. Indirectly, this would benefit a
large part of Peru's economy, not
counting the airlines, which might earn
as much as $10 million a year.
In certain regions of Peru where
geographical factors, over-population
and the lack of exploitable resources
combine to make development acutely
difficult, building up a tourist industry
appears to be the best means of
establishing a "development nucleus".
Peru's share of more than $11,000
million spent on international tourism
in 1965 by over 115 million people was
about $15 million, or 1/730th of the
total an insignificant proportion in
view of Peru's immense potential tour¬
istic assets.

A CITY
WRESTED
FROM
THE JUNGLE
Hardly a year goes by in Peru without some
new discovery being made of relics from
pre-Columbian civilizations. In 1965, an im¬
mense city of pre-lnca times was found in the
region of Pajaten, where the eastern slopes of
the Andes sweep down towards Amazonia.
The city covers some 34 square kms. (12
square miles). Hacking away the jungle
vegetation, an expedition uncovered massive
stone structures built on circular terraces,
temples adorned with winged human figures
and condors, and traces of a vast network of
roads. It is believed that the city was built
by the Chachapoyas, a people conquered by
the Incas in the mid-fifteenth century. Right,
ruins of a temple decorated with carved stone
heads and geometric designs. Below left, a
stone condor. Many stylized figures of this
bird, which was worshipped by the Chacha¬
poyas, were found. Below right, freeing a build¬

ÍRAN
tomorrow's
plosion
RAN is launching a special
programme to show its vast inheri¬
tance of historical monuments to more
people. It is doing this with the co¬
operation of Unesco.
The careful restoration and display
of Iran's artistic and architectural
treasures will help to reveal to the
world their full cultural significance.
To study these monuments is to
contemplate a panorama of the coun¬
try's history and art. Scattered across
the million and a half square kilo¬
metres of this arid plateau traversed
by mountains are the legacies of every
period. Hundreds of Stone Age settle¬
ments lie along the former shores of
dried-up lakes. The Zoroastrian fire
worshippers have left shrines which
range from primitive altars to the ruins
of sophisticated temples. The ancient
capital of the Medes, Ecbatana, is still
hidden under the modern buildings of
the city of Hamadan; but the Persian
Empire, which Cyrus founded 2,500
years ago and which was the real
beginning of the Iranian state,
reappears today in the palaces of Pas-
argades and Susa, the monumental
bas-relief of Darius I at Bisotoun
(whose inscriptions made it possible
to decipher cuneiform writing) and
especially the royal city of Persepolis,
one of the world's most impressive
historical sites.
The Parthian rulers, who recovered
Iran's independence from the succes¬
sors of Alexander the Great, and the
later Sassanian dynasty have made
their own contributions: domed palaces
in picturesque settings and huge bas-
reliefs on the sides of mountains are
memorials of a time when the Great
King of Persia and the Roman Empe¬
ror were called the twin lighthouses
of the world.
This powerful head was once
part of a capital (shaped as the
forepart of a human-headed bull).
It crowned one of the innumerable
columns in the mighty palaces
and halls of Persepolis, Iran,
and is now in the Tehran Museum.

The largest inheritance has been
that of Islam, which, from the seventh
century onward, changed every aspect
of Iranian civilization; new ideas of
art, architecture, philosophy and scien¬
ce, new customs and ways of living
are reflected in its mosques and pal¬
aces and tombs. The style and
conception of these Islamic monuments
which varied greatly during success¬
ive periods, for example, those of the
Seljuks, the Mongols and the Timurids
are in harmony with the contem¬
porary poetry, miniature painting,
ceramics and carpet-weaving that
gave peculiarly rich expression to the
Iranian genius.
F,ROM the beginning of the
sixteenth century to the beginning of
the eighteenth, the Safawid rulers,
especially the fabulous Shah Abbas I,
gave Iran a new Golden Age. Every¬
where in the country, the works of
the Safawids remain, but their most
astounding achievement was the thous-
and-and-one-nights city of Isfahan,
whose palaces, mosques, fountains,
gardens and mysterious streets have
survived until our time.
The subsequent Zend and Qajar
periods were an age of decay, when
technologically the country was fall¬
ing behind the nations of Europe and
North America galvanized by their
industrial revolution. Nevertheless,
many subtle baroque monuments of
this time form a valuable portion of
the cultural inheritance of Iran.
The Christian and other religious
minorities which have lived side by
side with the Moslems of Iran have
left original monuments to their own
faith and customs, dating from the
Middle Ages down to this century.
The importance of these monuments
for the cultural life of Iran is obvious.
Yet the problems of maintenance, to
say nothing of restoration and display,
are enormous. Guardians for several
thousand scattered units, many of them
in isolated areas, and the payment of
the most urgent repairs call for sub¬
stantial sums. For the vast number
of historical buildings in private hands,
the difficulties are even greater. The
archaeological sites of Iran are them¬
selves a huge enterprise. The national
administrative and technical machinery
for the protection of monuments needs
to be strengthened, and schools for
specialists created. Many new mu¬
seums are needed; for example, there
is not yet a carpet museum in the
country.
In fact, the effort required could
seem almost too much for a develop¬
ing country that should husband all
its resources to improve its economy
and the social conditions of its people.
However, the growth of tourism has
changed the problem. The expansion
of modern communications has at last
made international tourism in Iran pos¬
sible; it is expected to take on con¬
siderable proportions during the next
few years. It will not only open up
the country and its culture more widely
to the rest of the world, but also
stimulate its economy. Financial sacri¬
fices which will contribute to tourism
are therefore acceptable and even
necessary.
Now historical monuments and sites
are important to tourism everywhere,
but in a country like Iran they are vital.
People will not travel this far merely
for sport or recreation which they
can get closer to home but for a
unique cultural revelation. Iran, which
wants to preserve its cultural heritage
for its own sake, is also duty bound
to do so for practical reasons.
As soon as it laid down this prin¬
ciple, the Iranian Government sought
to translate it into action. For this, it
called upon the technical aid of
Unesco. Missions were sent to advise
the Iranian authorities on the prepara¬
tion of a specific plan for the preser¬
vation and display of monuments and
the development of tourism consider¬
ed as a single, integrated activity.
The special programme which result¬
ed from these studies has three main
features. It was decided not to extend

uments and audience halls,
including a Throne Hall with
99 columns and a Hall of
100 Columns. The construction
of Persepolis was begun by
Darius I in 520 B.C. and con¬
tinued by his son Xerxes and
by Artaxerxes I. To Perse¬
polis each spring came the
peoples of the Persian Empire
to render homage. Portrayed
in stone that once glittered
in bright colours, they still
seem to be mounting the
stairways and filing towards
the throne hall of their ruler
(see page 18). This ritual
procession in stone is one
of the actual ceremonies that
took place here nearly 25 cen¬
turies ago, when Darius con¬
ceived Persepolis as a meet¬
ing place for all his subject
peoples. For many years Iran
has taken steps to protect
the noble ruins of Persepolis
from the erosive effects of
wind and weather. Several
Unesco missions have made
on-the-spot studies at Iran's
request. In 1963, a Unesco
specialist suggested the use
of photographs taken ten
years earlier (including this
panoramic view) to detect by
comparison any deterioration
in the sculpture and stonework.

Around the world to see Isfahan
action to the country as a whole, but
to concentrate it on four priority areas,
leaving to the future the development
of other regions. Secondly, since
tourism and the preservation of monu¬
ments involve tasks which are of the
competence of many different kinds of
specialists, the programme will need
to be carried out by a special inter-
ministerial commission in which all the
ministries, departments and govern¬
mental services concerned with any
aspect of the work are represented.
Lastly, the programme is designed to
form an integral part of the national
five-year plan for development.
The monuments in the four priority
areas of Iran's programme represent
all periods of Iranian history, show
practically all aspects of its culture and
are set in impressive and contrasting
landscapes. For each of these areas,
the programme has a list of specific
projects bearing upon communications
in the area, tourist plant such as
hotels, restaurants, recreational and
other facilities, the preservation and
display of monuments and sites
and the organization of museums, and
lastly, laws and regulations relating
to this action.
T

HE first area lies along the
road from the Turkish frontier in the
northwest to Tehran. This has always
been one of the main lines of commu¬
nication between Europe and the
Orient. Today it is to become a
section of the great Asian Highway.
The road, when it enters Iranian
territory, crosses the high volcanic
plateau of Azerbaijan. Mt. Ararat, near
the corner where Turkey, Iran and the
U.S.S.R. meet, is visible from the road.
The picturesque villages have often
beautiful mud houses well adapted to
the extremes of the climate. They
would seem doomed to be replaced
by more modern buildings, but the plan
is to preserve the external appearance
of at least some of these villages which
are gradually being endowed with
modern conveniences.
The area is dotted with medieval
Armenian churches of original styles,
the most famous of which, the
eleventh-century Qara Kilissieh or
Black Church, is à place of annual
pilgrimage for Armenian Christians
throughout Iran.
Contrasts are everywhere. At the
edge of the town of Maku, a late
nineteenth-century baroque palace
built by a great feudal lord of the
region and stocked with all the curio
sities which the wealth of that time
could accumulate, is to be opened as
a museum. The town of Khoï has a
Mongol tower whose sides are decorat¬
ed with the horns of dozens of wild
animals. Marand has a Mongol mos¬
que, but also a primeval shrine of the
fire-worshippers.
The great city of Tabriz lies some
distance away from the vast salt lake
of Urmieh. Tabriz, all in red brick,
has many exquisite mosques, an old
bazaar, a curious museum devoted to
the revolution of 1906 which gave
Iran its first constitution, and the ruins
of the thirteenth-century Blue Mosque
with ceramic tiles whose exact hues
have not been reproduced elsewhere.
Farther east, other mountain ranges
are crossed. A ruined sixteenth-cen¬
tury red-brick caravanserai beside
the road, of unusual beauty, which
would soon disappear altogether if it
were .left as it stands, is to be restor¬
ed and made to serve as a motel.
A side road from the highway will
lead to a place in the mountains call¬
ed the Takht-e-Soleiman or Throne of
Solomon, near a lake in the crater of
an extinct volcano. This may one day
prove to be one of the major curio¬
sities of this part of Iran. A dead
city here, now being excavated by a
German archaeological expedition, was
one of the holiest centres of the
Zoroastrian fire worshippers, and
Zoroaster himself was believed to
have been born here.
The traveller along the highway
encounters medieval castles and
bridges, then the glistening nineteenth-
century Persian city of Zenjan. Later
on he reaches the famous funerary
mosque of the Mongol sultan Oljaitu
Khodabendeh. Of the great city of
Soltanieh which surrounded it, no
trace is to be seen. Today the great
lonely mosque rises above a tiny mud
village on a long plain against a back¬
ground of snow-capped mountains.
The monument will be given extensive
repairs and the old village preserv¬
ed. Modern buildings for tourists will
be allowed only at some distance,
beside the highway.
A series of measures are needed
at Qazvin, once the capital of Iran
and rich in palaces, mosques, chur¬
ches and baths of the past three cen¬
turies. The highway runs parallel to
the Elburz Mountains in which are the
castles of the Hashishin, a Mohamme¬
dan sect whose warlike piety and
mysticism during the Middle Ages
earned it a dire reputation among its
enemies.
The second priority area covers
Tehran and its surroundings. The
capital of the country is the natural
centre of its communications system,
as well as of its cultural life, and
practically all foreign visitors come
here. The great modern city in the
throes of rapid expansion gives, at
first, the impression that it has little
connexion with the past. However,
in addition to the museums and such
famous curiosities as the jewels and
regalia exhibited at the national bank,
there are many richly decorated pal¬
aces of the Qajar period (often
converted into administrative build¬
ings), old mansions which give a vivid
idea of the life of that time, one of
the city gates now lying in a private
garden, and the immense bazaar.
Projects are being planned for them
all. The Golestan or Rose Garden
Palace, with its ornate halls and
collections of furniture, carpets and
objects of art, will be reorganized to
house a group of museums.
s ITES and monuments out¬
side Tehran, belonging to a number
of periods of Iranian history, call for
protection and repair. Among them
are the early Islamic monuments surviv¬
ing from the ancient city of Rey (or
Rhages), which was destroyed by the
Mongols, the Qajar bas-reliefs of
Cheshme AM (one of them above a
spring which is also famous for the
sight of the carpets laid out to dry
on the rocks after washing), a nearby
Sassanian fire temple, and the Mongol
shrines and tombs at Varamin.
Lovers of Isfahan which is the
third priority area say that it would
be worth a 4rip around the world even
if one saw'ilothing else along the way.
The riches of an Islamic civilization at
the height of its glory, preserved
almost intact, are displayed before
the visitor's eyes.
The monument here is the city itself:
none of its buildings can be consider¬
ed separately. The programme for

In the luxuriant valley of Darius and Xerxes
restorations and improvements is a
plan for Isfahan as a whole. Though
some 150 buildings (including 80 private
houses) are officially considered to be
of historical or artistic interest, the
others also play a role in determin¬
ing the appearance of the town. A
group of old houses clustered around
a mosque can, in a certain way, prac¬
tically form part of that monument.
The improvement of gardens, the
proper lighting of streets and build¬
ings are not to be separated from the
preservation work.
T

O read through a list of
the projects planned for Isfahan is to
make an exciting imaginary tour of the
city. The Royal Square of Shah
Abbas, one of the most beautiful
squares in the world, has on its four
sides the palace of the Safawid rulers
or Ali Qapu, the Shah Mosque, the
Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque and the
monumental entrance to the bazaar;
two storeys of loggias complete the
rectangle. The urgently needed re¬
pairs and embellishments will restore
its full splendour to the whole.
Behind the Ali Qapu, the immense
Safawid gardens lead (though across
a few recent obstructions) to the
Forty Columns or Chehel Sotoun.
Nearby, the fifteenth-century Timurid
Palace and the Ashraf Hall, which
have been abandoned to administra¬
tive uses, will become museums and
will be reincorporated in the garden.
Similar improvements are called for in
another pavilion, some distance away,
the hexagonal Hasht Behesht. This
whole central part of Isfahan will thus
form one monumental ensemble.
The Juma Mosque, to the construc¬
tion of which every Islamic period has
contributed, will require considerable
work, as will the many buildings of
the bazaar and a number of other
mosques and minarets. The city's
private mansions of exceptional
interest will be bought (with their
valuable furnishings), or else their
owners will be assisted in preserving
them, and these buildings will be
made available to the public. The
general care and embellishment of the
city will be pursued rationally.
Certain private initiatives at Isfahan
lie outside the scope of the pro¬
gramme but will help it to achieve its
objectives. One of these is the gra¬
dual installation in a Safawid cara¬
vanserai of the luxurious Shah Abbas
Hotel. The decoration and furnishings
of this hotel seek to reproduce the
atmosphere of Isfahan's Golden Age.
The last of the four priority areas
is that of the province of Fars, the
original "Persia", whose capital is
Shiraz (the language of Iran is Farsi).
It is a city of Islamic poets; Saadi
and Hafiz, whose tombs are covered
by respectful modern mausoleums,
sang here of the joys of life. The
pleasant city in its fertile plain en¬
compassed by mountains is still
decorated with "gardens", that is,
rich villas surrounded by ornate
gardens. The palace has become a
post office, the citadel more graceful
than menacing a prison; there are
rich museums in old buildings, mos¬
ques and even churches with a per¬
sonality of their own, magnificent
private mansions. All these are to be
set to rights and made enjoyable
again for the many people who will
wish to see them.
But Shiraz is also the centre for
some of the most impressive excur¬
sions of the Middle East. Remains of
the most ancient Persian times are to
be found on all sides. For each of
these, the programme defines the
urgent steps to be taken.
At some distance to the northwest
of Shiraz, the deserted city of Pasar-
gades preserves the tomb of its
founder, the great Cyrus, as well as
fragments of his palaces, a citadel on
the hillside, a fire-temple in the wilder¬
ness.
Persepolis, on a high platform
against a mountain dominating a
luxuriant valley, was the capital of the
ancient Persian Empire: there reigned
Darius and Xerxes and Artaxerxes,
several of each name. No one who
has seen them will ever forget the
high pillars of Persepolis, its ceremon¬
ious and yet realistic, humoristic
friezes of courtiers and satraps, or
the play of light at different times of
day on the walls of its palaces.
The valley is a jungle of ancient
remains: the painted Sassanian sculp¬
tures of Naqsh-e-Rajab, now badly in
need of protection; the tomb of Cam-
byses, the still buried city of Istakhr,
the royal Achaemenian tombs of
Naqsh-e-Rostem, which are huge,
pillared shrines carved out of the side
of a cliff.
The other main excursion points
were the creation of the Sassanian
kings. The road to Firouzabad leads
through a long pass dominated by a
monument to be repaired: the Qalaeh-
ye-Dokhtar or "Castle of the Daugh¬
ter". At several levels of the cliff
beyond, bas-reliefs of which the
ancient Persians were fond depict
historic scenes, especially defeats of
Roman Emperors by Sassanian sov¬
ereigns. The city of Firouzabad is
still to be fully excavated, and much
of it is still preserved underground;
but the palace of the Great King
Ardeshir I is fully visible; it is on
the point of crumbling today, but it
is to be protected and cleared of its
rubble; the fountain will form a small
lake for the palace gardens.
To the west of Shiraz, and across
a difficult mountain range, the Sassa¬
nian king Shapur I founded, in the
third century of our era, the city of
Bishapur. This deserted capital is
still a vast underground rectangle, the
forms of whose buildings can be
guessed at. Only the palace and a
few shrines have been exposed. The
rest will gradually be brought to light.
On the hill above stands another ruin¬
ed castle; a narrow pass leads into
a hidden valley, marvellously fertile,
with some of the most striking hillside
bas-reliefs in Iran. In the upper part
of this valley is a cave the logical
conclusion of this excursion inside
of which lies a colossal statue of the
Great King.
A,LONGSIDEand apart
from its programme for the preserv¬
ation of monuments and the develop¬
ment of tourism, Iran wishes to launch
new archaeological excavations in Iran
on an international basis. The terrain
is so rich that the country will welcome
increasing international co-operation in
its endeavour to bring this concealed
heritage to light. It may be remember¬
ed that archaeological excavations are
often the first step in making historical
monuments available to the modern
world.
One more thing can be said by way
of a conclusion. Iran has today, like
many countries, reached . a turning
point in its history. The sovereign,
the government and the people of
Iran are dedicating all their efforts to
the arduous task of bringing this great
country into pace with modern times,
so that it may assume its rightful role
in the technological age. But Iran
intends to be fully modern without
banishing the riches of the past. On
the contrary, they must be better
studied, better known and appreciat¬
ed, and help to evolve the new Iran-
¡an civilization which, in turn, will
offer its contribution to the civilization
of the world.

International co-operation
in seismology
Seventy-five teams of seismologists from
research institutes in France, Germany and
Italy recently combined efforts in a series
of studies of the underground rock structure
in the Western Alps. Nine charges of
explosives, ranging from one to 50 tons,
were set off in Southern France, in Savoy
and in Central France, and seismologist
teams recorded the waves set up by these
explosions within a range of 300 miles.
Next year, seismologists in Finland, Nor¬
way, Sweden, U.S.S.R. and U.K. will
measure the speed at which seismic waves
travel through strata from Lake Ladoga
in U.S.S.R. to Scotland.
India's women scientists
Six thousand Indian women are now
doing post-graduate work in science,
according to a survey by the Indian Council
of Scientific and Industrial Research.
Other facts from the survey: 70 per cent
of India's women scientists are under
thirty years of age; over 50 per cent are
in biology, 5 per cent in chemistry and
10 per cent in mathematics and physics.
Iran sets an example
In May 1966, Iran set a historic example
to other countries by freeing military credits
for use in the world fight against illiteracy
(see the Unesco Courier, July-August 1966).
On November 3, 1966, Princess Ashraf,
personal representative of the Shahinshah
of Iran, presented a cheque for just over

UNESCO CELEBRATES ITS 20 YEARS
O N November 4, 1966, Unesco celebrated the 20th anniversary of its foundation.
The commemoration coincided with the 14th Session of the Unesco General Con¬
ference which opened in Paris on October 25. An important programme of
ceremonies and events marking the anniversary has been taking place in conjunction
with the Conference.
Before the Conference opened, the Unesco Executive Board travelled to London
on October 19 for a special ceremony commemorating the adoption of Unesco's
Constitution by a preparatory conference which met in London in 1945. This event
was attended by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Wilson, and other leading figures
from the United Kingdom.
On November 4, a solemn celebration of Unesco's 20th anniversary was held
at Unesco headquarters in Paris, in the presence of General Charles de Gaulle,
president of the French Republic.
At this session the Conference approved a declaration of principles of international
cultural co-operation, laying down guidelines for relations and exchanges in education,
science and culture. The Conference also heard the conclusions of a round table
on Unesco's contribution to peace. Participants in the round table, held in Paris
from October 31 to November 3, included three Nobel Prize Winners Lord Boyd
Orr, Philip J. Noel Baker and Linus Pauling.
The General Conference, which formulates and approves Unesco's programme
and budget every two years, elected as its president, Professor Bedrettin Tuncel
of Turkey, former Turkish minister of education. On November 2, the 120 member
states attending .the Conference unanimously adopted a budgetary ceiling of just
over $62,500,000 for 1967-68. During this period Unesco will also dispose of
approximately equal funds from the United Nations Development Programme.
$705,000 to Unesco's Director-General,
Mr René Maheu. This represents one
day's expenditure under Iran's arms budget.
Mali and Morocco respond
Two countries Mali and Morocco have
responded to the appeal by the Shahinshah
of Iran for all nations to help finance liter¬
acy by making deductions from their
military budgets. In September 1956, Mali
gave $8,000 to Unesco, and on November
8, Mohammed Benhima, Morocco's Minister
of Education, presented a cheque for
$30,000 to Mr René Maheu, as his country's
contribution to Unesco's world literacy
fund.
A charter for 16 million
teachers
A "Teachers'. Charter" has been approv¬
ed by nearly 80 countries at a special
intergovernmental conference convened by
Unesco at its Paris headquarters. This
international recommendation sets forth
what it affirms should be the professional,
social and economic status of teachers
and their rights and responsibilities (see
the Unesco Courier, September 1966).
The Charter is the result of long studies
and consultations between Unesco and the
International Labour Organization and the
co-operation of international, governmental,
non-governmental and teachers' organiz¬
ations.
Europe's first range
for peaceful rocket research
Europe's first launching range for peace¬
ful rocket research has been inaugurated
in Arctic Sweden. It has been built to
the north of Kiruna, and will be operated
by the European Space Research Organiz¬
ation. It will be used to launch experi¬
mental rockets to heights of between 50
and 100 kilometres (30 to 60 miles).
Tolstoy exhibition in Japan
A big exhibition on the life and work
of Leon Tolstoy the first ever held in
Japan is being opened in Tokyo. In
Japan the great Russian novelist has long
been one of the most widely read authors.
The Soviet Union is sending more than
500 items from its Tolstoy collections,
including the author's personal possessions
and original manuscripts.
Jawaharlal Nehru
and the modern world
A round table discussion on the role
of Jawaharlal Nehru in the modern world,
organized jointly by Unesco and the
Government of India, took place recently
in New Delhi. Some twenty leading
figures from all parts of the world particip¬
ated. An exchange of views took place
on some of the great problems to which
this pioneer of international reconciliation
devoted outstanding thought and action.

Letters to the Editor
THE MYSTERY
OF AMERICAN AMBER
Sir,
I found the article on amber by
Wladyslaw Grzedzielski (March 1966)
most interesting. I have seen pieces
of amber which supposedly came
from American Indian graves and
wonder if this amber is of European
or American origin. I have never
heard of any major source of amber
in the New World. All the amber
I have ever heard of seems to have
come from the Baltic area. If all
amber does come from this area, it
seems most strange that any could
have come to pre-Columbian America.
And since the trees which might pro¬
duce amber are found in other areas,
but don't seem to have produced any
amber to speak of, how does one
account for all amber coming from
the Baltic region? It has been suggest¬
ed that some great catastrophe sev¬
erely damaged the trees in the area
causing them to disgorge large
amounts of resin. At any rate, I would
appreciate your views on the sources
of American amber.
Ronald J. Willis
Arlington, Va., USA
Wladyslaw Grzedzielski replies:
I cannot give you a definite expla¬
nation for the interesting discovery
of amber in the American Indian
graves. First of all a chemical analysis
of the amber should be made and
this would probably prove that it is
not alriber, but an amber-like resin
which can be found in various conti¬
nents and countries, for instance in
Burma. If, however, it is Baltic am¬
ber, there are several ways to explain
its existence on the American conti¬
nent for instance as result of dilu¬
vian glacier migration, if we consider
the hypothesis of its having been
brought in the pre-Columbian era by
the legendary Vikings to be too fan¬
ciful.
A Polish scientist Professor Za-
blocki from Torun University is working
on a thesis that the process of the
formation of amber is not exclusive
to the Baltic area and that amber is
a resin of a variety of trees, not only
coniferous ones, which in certain cli¬
matic conditions becomes "clarified"
through a specific process.
PEACE RESEARCH
JOURNALS
42
Sir,
Congratulations on the excellent
article on peace research by Professor
B.V.A. Röling (January 1966). Un¬
fortunately Dr. Röling's article did not
mention the two journals which are
official publications of the International
Peace Research Association (both
journals have received grants from
Unesco). I say "unfortunately" be¬
cause the great need for both Journals
is to make themselves known to
librarians and scholars active not only
in the field of peace research but also
in the general field of world affairs
and international relations.
The two journals are:
The International Peace Research
Newsletter, published three times a
year by the Secretariat, Polemological
Institute, University of Groningen,
Ubbo Emmiussingel 19, Groningen,
Netherlands. Subscription, $2.00 per
year. Editor, Elise Boulding, Univer¬
sity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan,
48104, U.S.A. This journal reports
on research in progress or being
considered, and on recent publications.
Peace Research Abstracts Journal,
published 12 times a year by the
Canadian Peace Research Institute,
Clarkson, Ontario. Subscription for
institutions, $60.00 per year or per
volume. Volume 1, Number 1 was
published in June 1964, and because
this is a reference work the earlier
volumes should also be purchased.
The journal is edited by Dr. Alan and
Dr. Hanna Newcombe at 25 Dundana
Avenue, Dundas, Ontario, Canada, and
publishes 200-300 word abstracts of
any article relevant to the peace/war
theme which has been published any¬
where in the world since 1945.
There are two other publications
which will probably become official
publications of the International Peace
Research Association at its next meet¬
ing in 1967:
The Journal of Peace Research,
published four times a year by the
Peace Research Institute, Oslo. Sub¬
scription, $4.00 or equivalent. Volume I
was published in 1964. Subscriptions
should be sent to Universitetsforlaget,
University of Oslo. P.O. Box 307,
Blindem, Oslo 3, Norway. The editor
is Dr. Johan Galtung of the Peace
Research Institute, Oslo.
The Journal of Conflict Resolution,
published four times a year by the
Center for Research on Conflict
Resolution, University of Michigan.
Subscription for institutions, $8.00 per
complete volume. Volume X is being
published in 1966. The editor is
Elizabeth Converse of the Center for
Research on Conflict Resolution.

For more facts on the activités of
the International Peace Research
Association and on books and other
publications relating to peace research,
readers are referred to the issue of
Unesco's quarterly, International Social
Science Journal, devoted to peace
research (Vol. XVII, No 3. 1965).
IMPACT OF TOYS AND GAMES
Sir.
Today's mass-produced and highly-
structured toys tend to stifle the im¬
agination and frustrate the creative
impulses of children. Could this be a
contributing factor in the increase of
juvenile delinquency or maladjustment?
In contrast, such activities as sand-
modelling contests stimulate the
child's imagination and challenge both
his ingenuity and his technical skill.
Would you consider devoting an is¬
sue to children's toys and play activ¬
ities, and to the influence these have
on the child's emotional development
and social adjustment? I believe this
is of interest to parents everywhere.

A NEW DIMENSION TO TRAVEL
Sir,
I was particularly interested in Bar¬
bara Bray's article on Ibn Khaldun
(June 1966 issue), as I had visited Fez
last year. Articles like this add a
new dimension to one's travels.
In the same issue (From the Unesco
Newsroom) you referred to the World
Festival of Negro Arts held in Dakar
last April. Having visited Dakar and
the Théâtre du Palais a few years ago,
I can imagine what a fascinating and
inspiring experience it must have been
to all concerned.

MODERNIZING
KERALA'S FISHING
Sir,
With the article, "Ungathered Har¬
vests in the Ocean" (Sept. 1966), on
page 14 there is a picture of fishing
nets introduced 18 centuries ago, used
by fishermen of Kerala, as an illustra¬
tion of outdated techniques. This is
contrasted with a picture of a modern
Norwegian whale-hunting vessel.
In 1953 an Indo-Norwegian fishing
community development project was
established precisely in what is now
the state of Kerala. The basis for the
project is an agreement between In¬
dia, Norway and the United Nations
concluded in 1952 and four supple¬
mentary agreements signed in 1953,
1956, 1961 and 1963. The purpose
was to bring about a higher standard
of living for the community in the pro¬
ject area through introduction of me¬
chanization and modern methods in
the fisheries and by improvement of
the health and hygiene conditions of
the fishing population.

Peru and Unesco are jointly studying a major plan for tourist development which gives
priority to the region of Cuzco and Machu Picchu, the heartland of the ancient Empire
of the Incas. The citadel of Machu Picchu, which was only discovered in 1911, is built
on many levels between Andean peaks and precipices and has no less than 3,000
steps (see page 18). Peru plans to build a new road network and hotels in this area.
