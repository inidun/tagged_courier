Florentine gracefulness
The extraordinary hands shown above are a detail from The Virgin of
the Rocks (left) which Leonardo painted in 1483. Upper hand is that
of the Virgin Mary; below, an angel's finger points towards the infant
John the Baptist. Leonardo was only thirty-one when he executed this
masterpiece of the Italian Quattrocento, which today hangs in the Louvre,
Paris (see p. 26). The figures have the natural gracefulness of 15th-
century Florentine art and harmonize perfectly with the natural setting
and the precisely rendered flowers and leaves. Some 23 years later
(about 1506), Leonardo painted a second version of The Virgin of the
Rocks. In this later version, which now hangs in the National Gallery,
London, Leonardo made many changes: the angel no longer points his
finger at the infant John the Baptist, and many of the details of rocks,
vegetation and drapery are different from those in the 1483 painting.

COVER
This is one of the most striking of the
hundreds of drawings in two long-lost
manuscripts by Leonardo da Vinci redis¬
covered recently in Madrid's National
Library and now being published in fac¬
simile for the first time. Drawing repre¬
sents the head and neck sections of the
outer mould of a colossal bronze eques¬
trian statue which Leonardo undertook
to execute (see full story page 37).
Leonardo's mind was like a moving
searchlight, constantly probing into the
darkness, illuminating one subject, then
rapidly passing on to another. Crammed
with brief notes and sketches, done
with unfailing precision, the Madrid
notebooks give us a deeper insight than
ever before into Leonardo's work in
mechanics, military engineering, geome¬
try, perspective, optics, casting, and
many other subjects.

This issue is devoted to the work of
Leonardo da Vinci as revealed in two
long lost notebooks which were
re-discovered in Madrid in 1965. Now
known as The Madrid Codices I and II,
they constitute one of the great
manuscript finds of the present century.
This autumn a 5-volume facsimile edition
of The Madrid Codices is being published,
by arrangement with the Spanish
government, by Taurus Ediciones of Spain,
and McGraw Hill Book Company of the
United States (1). The entire work was
conceived and edited by a brilliant
Vincian scholar, Ladislao Reti, who
completed the transcriptions, translations
(into modern Italian and English) and
commentaries just before his death last
October. Co-editions are being published
in Italian, German, Japanese and Dutch.
In the Foreword to The Madrid Codices,
Luis Sanchez Belda, Director General
of Spain's National Archives and
Libraries, in Madrid, emphasizes "the
broad spirit of international collaboration
that has presided over the publication of
the manuscripts: financed and directed by
an American Company, the reproduction
of the illustrations has been made in
Switzerland, the composition in England,
the editing in Italy and America, the
printing in Spain, and the binding in the
Fed. Rep. of Germany."
At the same time, a lavishly illustrated
320-page volume entitled The Unknown
Leonardo (2), also edited by Ladislao Reti,
is being published by McGraw-Hill and
co-publishers in Spain, Italy, France,
Fed. Rep. of Germany, Netherlands
and Japan. Part of a chapter from
this book is published on page 16
of this issue.
Another unique Leonardo manuscript, the
recently restored Codex Atlanticus is
now also being published in a 12-volume
full-size facsimile edition by the
Florentine publishers Giunti-Barbera and
the Johnson Reprint Corporation (3).
The Editors of the "Unesco Courier"
wish to express their thanks to
McGraw-Hill Book Company, Taurus
Ediciones, and Giunti-Barbera for their
generous help in making this special
issue possible. All photographs, unless
otherwise specified, are copyright and
reproduced from Codex Madrid I and II.

THE STRANGE
VICISSITUDES
OF LEONARDO'S
MANUSCRIPTS
J OR almost three centuries, Leon-
«l^ardo da Vinci's mass of scientific
I jottings and sketches languished
} in obscurity. They were buried
in notebooks and scribbling pads
which were chaotically disorganized
and hard to read. That is why, until the
end of the 18th century, Leonardo's
fame as an artist far surpassed his
reputation as a scientist and engineer.
Then too, after Leonardo's death in
1519, his manuscripts were first
neglected and later split up and dis¬
persed. Many of them disappeared
forever.
In his will Leonardo left all his manu¬
scripts to his faithful pupil Francesco
Melzi, who had accompanied him on
his travels and was present at
his death-bed. Melzi transferred his
precious inheritance to his villa at
Vaprio d'Adda near Milan. After
Francesco's death in 1570, his son and
heir, Orazio, failed to see the signifi¬
cance of the Leonardo material and
simply dumped it in the attic.
Thus it was an easy matter for Lelio
Gavardi, the tutor in the Melzi house¬
hold, to get his hands on thirteen
Leonardo manuscripts. Gavardi went
off to Florence with his prize, hoping
to sell it for a high price to Duke
m#H
by Paolo Galluzzi
Francesco de Mediéis. However, in¬
credible though it may seem, one of
the Duke's counsellors advised his
master that "These are not things for
Your Excellency to bother with," and
the sale did not go through.
Gavardi now abandoned his idea of
selling the manuscripts and asked his
friend Ambrogio Mazzenta, who was
about to leave for Milan, to take them
back to Orazio Melzi. However, Orazio
did not want them and (according to
the account in Mazzenta's memoirs)
"was amazed that I had gone to all
this trouble and made me a present
of the manuscripts."
At this point, Pompeo Leoni of
Arezzo comes on to the scene, and
his role in the strange story of
Leonardo's manuscripts is extremely
important. Leoni, court sculptor to
Philip II of Spain, showed great interest
in the Leonardo manuscripts preserved
by Francesco Melzi's heirs and man¬
aged to acquire many of them in
exchange for promises of personal
favours and protection. Leoni also
got hold of ten of the thirteen note¬
books given to Mazzenta by Orazio
Melzi. Thus, in the eight years between
1582 and 1590, almost all Leonardo's ^
papers passed to a new owner. r

PAOLO GALLUZZI is the director of the
Leonardo Museum and Library at Vinci, west
of Florence. He is currently preparing for
Italy's National Research Council a dictionary
of Galileo's philosophical and scientific ter¬
minology. He has written many studies on
the history of Italian scientific thought in the
16th and 17th centuries.

, Leoni wanted to present the docu¬
ments in a more attractive package,
and therefore decided to split up
several of the notebooks and re¬
arrange them into large codices. But
he was totally incompetent for this
kind of work, and the net effect of
his bizarre attempt at "restoration"
was to alter the whole arrangement
of Leonardo's papers and to destroy
vital evidence as to when they were
composed, in what order, the original
number of notebooks, and so on. He
also paved the way for a new Odyssey
of loss and dispersion.
There is no evidence that Leoni
carried out the intention which he
expressed to Orazio Melzi of handing
the Leonardo material over to Philip II
of Spain as a gift. It appears that he
only gave a sample of the documents
to his royal patron and kept the rest
for himself, since many of the manu¬
scripts came into the hands of Polidoro
Caichi, Leoni's son-in-law and heir,
who put them up for sale.
Around 1622 Caichi sold the large
volume compiled by Leoni and now
known as the Codex Atlanticus to
Count Galeazzo Arconati of Milan, and
in 1636 Arconati gave this Codex
(together with other Leonardo manu¬
scripts) to the Ambrosian Library in
Milan.
Other Leonardo documents which
had been in Leoni's possession ended
up in England. Thomas Howard, earl
of Arundel, managed to acquire the
second large volume of Leonardo
papers compiled by Leoni. This is the
collection of drawings now known as
the Windsor Collection, since it is
housed in the Royal Library, Windsor.
Another manuscript (the present Codex
Arundel 263) was also acquired by
Thomas Howard and subsequently
given by one of his heirs to the Royal
Society. The earl of Arundel's acqui¬
sitions date from 1630-1640.
In the 18th century new "movements"
of Leonardo manuscripts took place.
Around 1715 Lord Leicester acquired

navigable because of tortuous bends
and sudden changes in level.

and took back to England the Codex
which now bears his name. Another
manuscript, the so-called Codex Tri-
vulzianus (notable for the long lists
of words recorded in it by Leonardo)
was back in the Ambrosian Library
around the year 1750 Arconati had
donated it to the Library and later
removed it.
At the end of the 18th century even
those notebooks which seemed to have
found a permanent home started to
move around again. During the Italian
campaign in 1796-1797, Napoleon was
ordered by the French government of
that time, the Directory, to confiscate
Italian art treasures and send them to
Paris. The Codex Atlanticus and the
manuscripts housed in the Ambrosian
Library were among the major works
which thus found their way to the
French capital.
The Codex Atlanticus was deposited
in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the
manuscript material was handed over
to the Institut de France. Then at the
end of the Napoleonic Wars the
foreign governments involved managed
to obtain the restitution of many of
the art treasures which had been
removed from their countries. The
Codex Atlanticus was returned to
Milan, but the Institut de France held
on to the other Leonardo manuscripts.
In the 19th century English libraries
enjoyed a new influx of Leonardo
documents. In 1876, for example, John
Forster gave the South Kensington
Museum (now the Victoria and Albert
Museum) the three Leonardo note¬
books which are today known as the
Forster Codices. However, after this
generous gesture another extremely
alarming episode occurred. Count
Guglielmo Libri, a bibliophile and a pio¬
neer of modern scientific historiogra¬
phy, became interested in Leonardo,
and even thought of bringing out an

THE MADRID
For Leonardo, drawing was a kind of
language In Images more Immediate and
telling than words. Drawing below, from
Codex Madrid I, is one of several lie made
to demonstrate the impossibility of
perpetual motion. As "The Unknown
Leonardo" states. Leonardo was scornful
of the seekers after perpetual motion and
likened them to the alchemists who tried
to convert base metals to gold.

NOTEBOOKS
by Anna Maria Brizio New aspects of
Leonardo's genius emerge from his
rediscovered manuscripts
HE recent discovery of two
large manuscripts of Leo¬
nardo da Vinci, containing
drawings and notes long
thought to be lost, has opened up
a new, exciting chapter on the work
and thought of Leonardo, the Universal
Man.
The new manuscripts form part of
the extraordinary collection of notes
and drawings into which Leonardo
poured a lifetime of research, exper¬
iment and reflection on art and "natu¬
ral philosophy" (science), on mecha¬
nics, geometry, anatomy, hydraulics,
the motion of air and the mechanics
of flight.
The two notebooks have added no
less than 700 pages to the former total
of 6,000 pages of Leonardo manu¬
scripts. The Madrid Codices are rich
in new information which now helps
to clarify issues which have long been
discussed by Leonardo scholars and
left unsolved because of insufficient
or fragmentary evidence.
Together, the new notebooks cover
the fifteen-year period between 1491
and 1505 when Leonardo was at the
peak of his creative activity. How¬
ever, the two manuscripts differ
ANNA MARIA BRIZIO Is the president of
the Ente Raccolta Vlnclana (the famous Centre
for the collection of Leonardo da Vinci's
works) at Vinci, where Leonardo was born.
She is a member of the Commissions Vinciana
(Committee of Vinci studies) and the Higher
Council of Fine Arts of Italy's Llncel National
Academy. Professor of art history at the
University of Milan, she is the author of many
important studies on Leonardo da Vinci.
from each other in subject-matter:
Codex Madrid I presents an exception¬
ally uniform range of material and
deals principally with mechanics,
whereas Madrid II covers a wide
variety of subjects, most of which have
some connexion with art.
For example, Madrid II contains
subtle notes relating to painting and
deals with colour and colour effects.
Extracts from some of these notes in
fact appear in Leonardo's Treatise on
Painting (compiled after his death).
An entire section of the Codex is
devoted to plans for casting the Great
Horse of Milan, the equestrian statue
of Francesco Sforza which Leonardo
worked on for many years but which
was never actually cast (see page 37).
The Codex also includes a series of
architectural sketches of fortifications.
When we are dealing with Leonardo,
however, any distinction between
artistic and non-artistic drawings is
meaningless and indeed unjustified
for he conceived of no such distinction
in his work. His artistic and scien¬
tific activities always sprang from a
single source, so that the conclusions
reached in an artistic venture affected
the development of a scientific project
and vice versa.
Furthermore, Leonardo's drawings
are always a living language endowed
with extraordinary creative force and
possessing the same clarity and
elegance, whatever their subject-
matter. The airy red chalk drawings
of mountains in the Madrid folios are
modern in their luminous and im¬
pressionistic depiction of landscape.
It is interesting to note that they were
in fact executed as part of a series of
maps of the Arno river valley.
Again, the drawings of machines in
Madrid I are so lucid and compelling
that they suggest not only the surface
appearance of the objects but also the
dynamic force which makes them work.
We get the same impression from
Leonardo's anatomical drawings.
Of all the Leonardo notebooks
which have come down to us, Madrid I
is one of the most systematic (if such
a word can ever properly be applied
to Leonardo), perhaps because it is
almost entirely devoted to a single
subject mechanics. In appearance too
it is one of the most orderly, and many
of its pages give the impression of
being a definitive copy. On many
pages the drawings are so neatly and
carefully sketched and shaded, and
the accompanying texts so impeccably
laid out, that one wonders whether he
was actually preparing them for
publication.
The earliest and latest dates
mentioned in Codex Madrid I are
1493 and 1497. However, I am
personally inclined to place the work
as a whole nearer to the earlier of
the two dates, because of the nume¬
rous parallels with other Leonardo
manuscripts from the early 1490s.
This was the crucial period of
Leonardo's work in Lombardy, when
he was applying himself with growing
determination and success to both the
theoretical and practical aspects
of mechanics. His theoretical work
centred on the definition of the
"powers" (Leonardo uses the word
"potenzie") which move the universe:
weight, force, motion and impact. His
practical work consisted in the appli¬
cation of these principles to the con- *
struction of mechanical devices. r
Leonardo's drawing of a windlass to be
used for hoisting heavy loads (right), is so
precise as to be the envy of a modem
draftsman. The assembled mechanism Is
sketched at left; at right, an exploded view
of its wheels, discs and gears. Here
Leonardo brilliantly resolved the problem
of translating rotary to reciprocating motion.

Some of Leonardo's most exquisite
drawings in Codex Madrid I deal with the
transmission of motion and power by
means of toothed wheels, screws and
levers. Mechanism shown above is an
example of his constant efforts to design
improved devices. Leonardo's diagram,
above right, illustrates his explanation of
the nature of accidental and natural motion.
To demonstrate his theory he used as an
example the pendulum effect produced
when a weight suspended from a cord Is
allowed to fall and swing freely.
k Leonardo set forth his ideas on the
link between theory and practice In
two famous maxims: "The book about
the science of machines precedes the
book of applications"; and "Mechanics
is the paradise of the science of
mathematics, because through it one
reaches the fruit of mathematics."
The most spectacular section of
Leonardo's Madrid I manuscript is the
part devoted to a detailed analysis
and depiction of machinery, or more
precisely, the components of various
machines. This manuscript consti¬
tutes a kind of handbook of mechanics
and gained immediate fame for the
beauty and elegance of its drawings.
Ladislao Reti was the first Leo¬
nardo scholar to examine the Madrid
notebooks at first hand. He spent
years of passionate study on them,
and drew special attention to the large
number of Innovations and ingenious
solutions to mechanical engineering
questions found in Codex I. Many of
these are based on principles and
techniques which are astonishingly in
advance of his time foreshadowing
developments made many decades or
even centuries later.
From amongst the mass of obser¬
vations on mechanical engineering
contained in Madrid I, Reti underlines
two themes which, he says, are worthy
of exceptional interest because of their
originality and the extensive treatment
given them by Leonardo, namely, the
motion of projectiles and the motion
of the pendulum.
Leonardo divides motion into "natur
al motion" and "accidental motion",
and analyzes their characteristics and
the laws which govern them. Natural
motion, in Leonardo's sense of the
term, is dependent on the force of
gravity: "All weights desire to fall
towards the centre of the earth by the
shortest possible path", writes Leo¬
nardo in his typical style in which he
often personified things and events
In Nature.
"Accidental motion", on the other
hand, is caused by a force (Leonardo
uses the word potenzia, or "power"),
which opposes the object's "desire"
to get as near to the centre of the
world as possible. And "accidental"
motion will be violent, says Leonardo.
On the recto side of folio 147 of Ma¬
drid I, Leonardo analyzes the laws and
behaviour of natural and accidental
motion.
"We shall propose as example", he
writes, "a round weight suspended from
a cord, and let this weight be a (above,
letters reversed). And it shall be lifted
as high as the point of suspension of
the cord. This point will be f ... I affirm
thus, that if you let this weight fall, all
the motion made from a to n will be
Right, Leonardo's drawing of flywheels
equipped with a crank, for regulating the
speed of a machine. Many of Leonardo's
machines had built-in errors, according to
Lord Ritchie Calder in his book "Leonardo
and the Age of the Eye." Ritchie Calder
recalls a newspaper article which pointed
out that a tank devised by Leonardo would
not have worked because Leonardo had
arranged the crank in such a way that the
front wheels would have rotated one way
and the rear wheels the opposite way.
"This was no error," says Ritchie Calder.
"It was a deliberate mistake, typical of
Leonardo's sardonic habit of putting
a 'spanner in the works'. Was it mischief,
or was it Leonardo's way of 'patenting' his
ideas so that only he could make them?"
Conducting research into Leonardo's
technical work, Luigi Boldettl, a lecturer at
a polytechnic in Milan, consistently found,
working from Leonardo's diagrams, that
there was frequently "something" which
prevented the machine from working an
extra cog-wheel, a misplaced crank, or an
unnecessary ratchet When he had
"debugged" it, the machine would work.

The elements
of machines
In the Madrid Codices, Leonardofor the
first time in the history of technology
develops a systematic analysis of the
concepts and elements of machines. In
a chapter of the forthcoming volume,
"The Unknown Leonardo", entitled
"Elements of Machines", Ladislao Reti
states that "Codex Madrid I proves beyond
doubt that in this work Leonardo attempted
to compose a true treatise on the
composition and work of machines in
general." Leonardo's understanding of
individual mechanical elements as distinct
from whole machines set him apart from
other technologists of his time and from
many who came after him. Previously
scholars have held that It was not until the
1870s that Franz Reuleaux, in his classic
work, "The Kinematic of Machinery",
founded the modern theory of mechanisms.
Codex Madrid I now establishes, in
conjunction with a note found in the Codex
Atlanticus on pump cylinders and pistons,
that all the 22 elements of machines listed
by Reuleaux were analyzed and studied by
Leonardo, with the exception of rivets
(which he purposely excluded). Chart
above, reproduced from "The Unknown
Leonardo", shows Leonardo's drawings
in each case.

^called natural, because it moves in
^order to approximate itself as near to
the centre of the world as possible.
After reaching the desired site, that
is, n, another motion takes place, which
we will call accidental, because it goes
against its desire."
Leonardo next asserts that "Such
accidental motion will always be less

quently, natural motion, the more it
approaches its end (from "a" to "n"
as in the diagram) increases its veloc¬
ity. Accidental motion (from "n" to
"m") does the contrary."
In the same passage, Leonardo also
analyzes the motion of a projectile
launched in the air: "But if such
motions are made towards the sky, as
stones thrown in an arc, then the
motion made by accident will be
greater than the one we call natu¬
ral . . ." and (in its return towards the
ground after it has reached the zenith
of Its upwards motion) "the stone will
cease to follow in the air the shape of
the arc it began, but, due to the great
desire to go back down, it describes a
line of much greater curvature and
shorter than when it went upwards."
Almost a century later Galileo still
believed that the line traced by the
motion of projectiles in the air was a
perfect parabola. With his sharp eye,
Leonardo had "seen", both literally
and metaphorically, the real trajectory
of projectiles and correctly depicted
the curve in his drawings.
Leonardo had also correctly observ¬
ed the motion of the pendulum. He had
seen that when a pendulum swings,
the arc of its upwards motion is
shorter than its descending arc, and
that this ascending arc becomes

Galileo in 1582 and Huygens years later are
usually credited with the invention of
a pendulum clock. However, Codex
Madrid I contains notations and drawings
which show that Leonardo had the
completely original idea of applying the
pendulum to clocks, thus anticipating
Galileo by nearly a century. Leonardo's
drawings include a number of pendular
escapements (the escapement is the device
for regulating the motion of the wheelwork
in a clock) and on one page (folio 157
verso) he drew the complete clock
mechanism shown here (on left) with
a counterweight using a cord wound round
a drum wheel, a series of cog wheels, a cam
and a fan escapement, assembling the
elements here into an ideal mechanism.
Other drawings on this double page
illustrate Leonardo's lifelong research into
time-keeping devices and the ingenuity
he displayed in devising more efficient
mechanisms for them.
All the parts of a mechanical timepiece W
are described by Leonardo in Codex '
Madrid I. However, he does not depict or
describe complete clockworks except for
the one drawing shown at right, depicting
the general set-up of a weight-driven
clockwork provided with striking
mechanism. Many important parts are
nevertheless missing.

, shorter as the oscillations of the pen¬
dulum become slower. Leonardo also
realized that the smaller the arc
becomes, the more uniform become
the pendulum's oscillations.
We know about Leonardo's research
into the possible application of pen¬
dular mechanisms to drive saws,
pumps, and especially mill-wheels.
But did he ever think of applying the
pendulum to clocks? This question
has been much debated, but never
fully resolved.
In many pages of the Madrid I Co¬
dex, however, Ladislao Reti found a
significant number of notations and
drawings by Leonardo which he care¬
fully analyzed and found to be studies
for the adaptation of the pendulum to
a clock escapement. Reti's arguments
were sufficiently impressive to con¬
vince Silvio Bedini, one of the world's
great experts on clockwork. The two
scholars have written an entire chapter
on the subject for the book The Un¬
known Leonardo amply illustrated with
reproductions from Leonardo's Codex
Madrid I.
Leonardo was always interested in
time-keeping devices. He shows a
clear knowledge and deep curiosity in
the large clocks and planétariums that
existed in Lombardy at that time. He
was particularly interested in the clock
In the tower of the Abbey of Chiara-
valle near Milan, and the astronomical
clock (or astrarium) by Giovanni de'
Dondi in the ducal library of the Vis¬
conti Castle at Pavia, and made many
sketches of their highly complicated
parts.
Bedini and Reti point out that cer¬
tain pages of the Madrid I Codex (folio
9 recto, folio 61 verso, and above all
folio 157 verso) contain conclusive
evidence that Leonardo had the com¬
pletely original idea of applying the pen¬
dulum to clocks, thus anticipating the
research of Galileo in this domain (1).
On folio 9 recto, Leonardo draws a
crown-wheel connected to a horizontal
rod, driven by a drum with cord and
weight. On folio 61 verso there are
some exceptionally clear-cut drawings
of two different kinds of pendular
escapement, one with a horizontal
tooth-wheel, the other with a vertical
tooth-wheel.
Finally, on folio 157 verso there is
a rapidly drawn sketch, but it depicts
a complete mechanism with a counter¬
weight using a cord wound round a
drum-wheel, a series of cog-wheels,
a cam with sinusoidal track, and a fan
escapement. All these components
recur repeatedly in various folios of
Codex Madrid I, but here they are
apparently assembled into an ideal
mechanism..
Yet nowhere in Codex Madrid I did
Leonardo actually draw a complete
clock with a pendulum mechanism; on
folio 157 verso, for example, there is
no indication as to the motor required
to drive the device.
However, It is characteristic of
Codex Madrid I that Leonardo gener¬
ally tends to sketch the individual
component parts of a mechanism, in
order to gain a clearer picture of its
structure and the way it works, rather
than to make a final drawing of the
fully assembled model. In the draw¬
ing on folio 157 verso we are fully
entitled, according to Bedini and Reti,
to see the first ever project for a pen¬
dulum clock almost a century before
Galileo!
All kinds of other mechanisms are
analyzed by Leonardo in Codex Ma¬
drid I: springs for driving time-keeping

Leonardo's
theatre
in the round
Leonardo was a brilliant and enthusiastic
organizer of shows and spectacles of
various kinds. The lavish entertainments
he arranged at the court of Lodovico II Moro
in Milan (see page 25) were legendary,
and in later life, when living at Amboise,
he is known to have staged at least one
spectacular show for King Francis I.
He designed scenery and theatrical
costumes as well a,s a revolutionary kind
of theatre and the machinery to work it.
Leonardo's theatre consisted of two
semicircular amphitheatres which rotated
around a pivot and then closed to form
a complete circle. He took the idea from
Pliny's Natural History, which says that
a theatre of this kind existed in ancient
Rome but does not describe how it worked.
Leonardo worked out his own solution to
the problem. He closed the two
semicircular halves of his theatre into
a circle using what he calls "chains
of beams."
Bottom right, we show the diagrams of
this ingenious system as Leonardo depicted
it in Codex Madrid I. When open the
theatre consists of two semicircles joined
together in the form of a rounded X
(drawing no. 1). The audience takes its
seats, and when the theatre is full the
chains at the back of each amphitheatre
(see drawing no. 3) are hauled until the
two amphitheatres are side by side (drawing
no. 2). The walls then continue to move
around the pivot until they meet to form
a complete circle (drawing no. 4). This
invention is not impracticable. An engineer
named James E. McCabe has In fact
constructed a model of this theatre in the
round from Leonardo's instructions, thus
proving that the mechanical principles on
which it is based are correct. Top centre
and centre, model of theatre shown in
various positions. The same principle Is
also found in the toy held by child (top
right) in painting by Bernardino Luini
(1475-1532). Perhaps Leonardo took the
idea of the chains which manipulate his
theatre from a children's toy, just as he
may have done for the helicopter
(see page 30).

\LTHOUGH Leonardo has always
been extolled as "the universal
genius", his musical thought
and his musical activities have
received little serious attention and
have never been treated systematically.
It is characteristic that the standard
works of Leonardo, even in our
considerable number of ingenious
musical instruments and made im¬
provements on existing ones. He also
had some highly original ideas about
the philosophy of music that were
intimately connected with his philo¬
sophy of painting.

century, do not mention music at
all, or content themselves with
quoting remarks by Vasari, the
author of the famous Lives of the
Painters.
Leonardo was, in fact, profoundly
occupied with music. He was a
performer and teacher of music; he
was deeply interested in acoustics and
made many experiments in this field
that had immediate bearing on music;
he wrestled with the concept of
musical time; and he invented a
Sforza became the Duke of Milan,
Leonardo, already famous, was brought
to the duke to play for him, since the
duke had a great liking for the sound
of the lira; and Leonardo brought
there the instrument which he had
built with his own hands, made largely
of silver but in the shape of a horse
skull a bizarre, new thing so that
the sound (I'armonia) would have
greater sonority; with this, he sur¬
passed all the musicians who met
there to play. In addition, he was the
16

best improviser of rhymes of his time."
A number of later historians also
extolled his musical ability, notably
the Milanese painter Giovanni Paolo
Lomazzo, who in his Trattato dell'arte
delta pittura of 1584, and Idea del
tempio delta pittura of 1590, names
"Leonardo Vinci painter" as one of
the outstanding masters of the lira.
The lira mentioned in these sources
was the lira da braccio, the most noble
and subtle polyphonic bowed instru¬
ment of Leonardo's day a fiddle with
seven strings.
Leonardo inquired into the origin of
sound ("What is sound produced by a
blow?") and examined the sonorous
impact of bodies upon bodies, ex¬
panding age-old Pythagorean notions.
He investigated the phenomenon of
vibration and sympathetic vibration, of
how the percussion of a body makes
it oscillate and communicate its oscil¬
lation to the surrounding air or to
liquid or solid matter, for example.
He studied the propagation of sound
waves as differentiated from light
waves, the reflection and refraction
of sound waves and the phenomenon
of echo, the speed of sound and the
factors that determine degrees of
loudness, investigating the laws that
govern the fading of sound by varying
the distance between its source and
the ear.
Especially characteristic of his
approach in this context is his estab¬
lishment of what can be called a
perspective of sound, parallel to the
laws of optical and pictorial perspec¬
tive so important to him as a painter.
Also, as a musician he was naturally
occupied with the factors that deter¬
mine musical pitch, and he experi¬
mented with vases of different shapes
and varying apertures. Of musical
importance, though Leonardo could
not foresee Its implication, was another
of his observations: when he struck
a table with a hammer, small heaps of
dust formed on its surface; here
Leonardo anticipated by three cen¬
turies the German physicist E.F.F.
Chladni's discovery of the geometric
sand figures produced by setting the
edge of a plate in vibration with a
fiddle bow.
Leonardo's notes and designs
dealing with musical instruments are
scattered in many of his manuscripts.
Cryptic as many of these notes and
drawings appear to be if studied
in isolation, methodical comparison
reveals that they are not merely
diverting devices for performing magic
tricks, but that they serve systematic
efforts by Leonardo to realize some
basic aims.
The most important of these aims
are the following: automation of
certain instruments and facilitation of.
playing technique through new kinds V
<$*-
ï
Leonardo was a highly proficient musician.
He invented some new musical instruments
and improved others. He was deeply
interested in the construction of drums and
sketched many different kinds in his
notebooks. He wanted to extend the
musical possibilities of drums and also
make them easier to play through various
methods of automation. This drawing
(opposite page) of a mechanized military
drum in the Codex Atlanticus with Ha
battery of drumsticks looks like part of
a street musician's one-man band. The axle
of the carriage wheel drives a central
cogwheel which then turns other cogs
which activate the five drumsticks on each
side of the cylindrical drum.

In his work in art and science, Leonardo
gave much attention to studies in anatomy,
such as the drawing above of the
larynx and trachea (now in the Windsor
Collection). This probably inspired in him
the idea for the two musical pipes, above
left, in a drawing from the Codex Atlanticus.
Leonardo wrote that the pipes changed
their tone "in the manner of the human
voice", and there Is a close resemblance
between upper opening of the larynx shown
here and that of a recorder.
17

L of keyboards; increasing the speed of
playing; extension of tonal range to
make it possible, for instance, to play
melodies on drums; overcoming the
quick fading of the sound of plucked
strings, by giving the instruments an
endless bow; enriching comparatively
simple instruments to make them
capable of polyphony or a wide range
of successive tones; and even having
a polyphony of the sounds of bowed
strings at the control of a keyboard.
Leonardo was greatly interested in
the construction of drums. He not
only tried to make them easier to play
but also expanded their musical
possibilities, such as tonal range, far
beyond the limitations of the con¬
ventional instruments of his time.
Leonardo endeavours to enrich the
traditional function of drums by making
them capable of producing chords and
scales. For this he tries two different
methods. One is the combination of
several drums or skins of different
pitch into one single instrument. The
other consists of devices to make one
skin produce tones of different pitch
in rapid succession.
This aim is realized in various ways:
either through the introduction of side
holes, or through the use of scissor
levers or screw devices to change the
tension of the skin while it is beaten,
or through slides that open and close
a large hole in the resonating body,
or, finally, through mechanisms that
detach the skin cover from the body
of a pot drum.
Among the many musical instru¬
ments contrived by Leonardo, the viola
organista is by far the most com¬
plicated. No less than six different
pages in the notebooks contain
sketches for it.
The drawings are all concerned with
the idea of a stringed instrument with
keyboard, in which the strings are set
The ingenious drum design shown below
in detail of a page from the Codex Arundel
is of outstanding importance because it
allowed the drum's pitch to be changed
while it was actually being played. By
moving the scissor-like levers at either side
of the square drumhead the player could
tighten or slacken the drumskin. A drum
whose pitch can be changed during
performance did not appear in the West
until the close of the 19th century.

The most complicated of the new musical
instruments contrived by Leonardo was the
viola organista, a string instrument with
a keyboard. We do not know how near
Leonardo came to constructing it. The
strings were to be set into vibration
mechanically, and in his various notebooks
Leonardo drew several devices for bowing
many strings simultaneously. The most
feasible and elaborate solution is in the
sketch shown above, from a manuscript in
the Institut de France. It shows a
workable keyboard instrument with a belt
of horsehair passing across the strings
in an endless bow.

In his typical way, Leonardo is here trying
to obtain from a single bell sounds which
could normally only be produced by four
bells. The bell, sketched in Codex
Madrid II, is fixed; it does not swing.
Two hammers strike its rim at opposite
sides. Leonardo has noted: "The same
bell will appear to be four bells. Organ
keys with a fixed bell. And when struck
by hammers, there will be a change
of tones as in an organ."

nes, S.A., Madrid, Spain
into vibration by a mechanical device
a wheel, a bow with a back-and-forth
motion, or a belt of hair moving across
the strings as a sort of endless bow.
Such an instrument would fill a big gap
in the multitudinous array of instru¬
ments, not only in Leonardo's time
but also in our own.
It would combine the polyphonic
possibilities of the keyboard with the
tone colour of bowed strings and thus
would be something like an organ
with string timbre Instead of wind
timbre, and in addition it would provide
the possibility of producing crescendos
and decrescendos by finger pressure.
Although it is not known in what
order Leonardo made his sketches, it
is possible to arrange the drawings
in a logical sequence if we assume
that Leonardo progressed from less
workable solutions to more practical
18
ones. In fact, he proceeds from an
instrument with a bow moving back
and forth across the strings, to one
with a friction wheel, and finally to
several versions of a revolving band
of hair that sets the many strings into
vibration.
The most workable, and apparently
ultimate, solution is in Manuscript H,
where we find a sketch of a perfectly
consistent, workable keyboard instru¬
ment with an endless bow (archetto),
a belt of hair moved by a motor
attached to the side of the sound box
and passed across the strings by
means of two small rollers. Leonardo
also designed a mechanism permitting
the player, 'by pushing the small pro¬
jecting buttons, tq,select the desired
strings and draw' them against' the
archetto.
We do not know, however, how near
Leonardo came to the actual con¬
struction of the viola organista or
whether he ever made working models.
Today, with an electric motor in place
of one using weights or springs, the
construction of the instrument would
be greatly facilitated.
We must finally consider two instru¬
ments which have special interest
because their invention seems directly
inspired by Leonardo's anatomical
studies; in fact they are applications
of mechanisms Leonardo found in the
human body. The first is in the Codex
Atlanticus, where we find, among
numerous small sketches for various
machinery, drawings of two pipes.
Every connoisseur of musical
instruments will recognize immediately
two recorders by their characteristic
heads and mouth holes. Their basic
structure has not changed substantially
since Leonardo's time. Beneath the
upper end held by the player's lips is
a hole with a sharp edge which is
struck by the air-stream emanating
from his mouth.
Ordinarily recorders have on their
sides six finger holes which are closed
and opened by the fingertips of the
player to produce the distinct tones
of the scale. But Leonardo's recorders

Stretched out in the grass behind
his grandfather's house a young
lad, who was to grow up to be one
of the greatest painters and sculptors
the world has ever known, waswatching
the circling flight of a birda kite-
round the main tower of the castle in
the town of Vinci. His uncle was lying
in the grass next to him, trying to
explain the mechanics of the way a
kite flies, soaring round in circles so
as to exploit the slightest breath of a
breeze. But the young lad was tired:
his eyes were already closed and he
had fallen asleep. His name was
Leonardo da Vinci.
It was an afternoon in May, the
earth was sweet with the scent of hay
and crickets sang out from their
hiding-place in the grass. Leonardo
had a strange dream about the kite: he
dreamt that he was still in his cradle,
but no longer at home. Lucia, his
grandmother, had carried the cradle
into the field and then gone away.
The kite made ever-narrowing cir¬
cles until it plunged from the sky and
dropped on top of him; however, the
bird did not scratch Leonardo with its
claws or peck him with its beak. It
simply flapped its wings and tried to
open the boy's mouth with its forked
tail. When Leonardo's mouth was
opened in this way, the kite struck
his lips and his tongue with its tail.
Suddenly Leonardo woke up with a
cry and found himself sitting on the
grass with his uncle, Francesco.
"What's the matter with you?" asked
his uncle.
"That kite", stammered the lad, still
not quite sure that he had woken up
from his dream, "Uncle, I had a dream
about that kite!"
Many years later, when Leonardo
was grown up, he wrote in the city of
Milan that this was his first childhood
memory, a striking one which he had
never forgotten. Now that he was
studying the mathematical laws that
had to do with birds' flight, that kite
seemed to him to have been some
kind of messenger telling him his
future destiny.
BRUNO NARDINI, publisher and founder of the
International Book Centre in Florence, is the author
of "Vita di Leonardo" ¡Life of Leonardo), written for
children and illustrated with stills from an Italian
television film on Leonardo directed by Renato Castel-
lani (Nardini and Giunti-Bemporad Marzocco Publi¬
shers, Florence, 1974). He has adapted the fables
and legends which Leonardo ¡otted down in his
notebooks into two books for young people: "Favole
et Leggende", to be published in English as 'Fables
of Leonardo da Vine' (Collins, U.K.; Hubbard Press,
U.S.A.), and "Animali Fantastic/" (Nardini and Giunti-
Bemporad Marzocco, 1974). He has also published
a book for youngsters on the life of Michelangelo.
In this house, on the slopes of the Tuscan
hills near Vinci, Leonardo was born on
April 15th. 1452.
And what a splendid destiny it
would be! Born in a poor village of
Tuscany in central Italy, near the River
Arno, he never had a mother of his
own like other children, or a loving
father. Instead he had a step-mother
and a strict grandfather. His only
real friend and teacher was his uncle
Francesco, who was seventeen years
older than Leonardo. '
Leonardo was born on the 15th of
April, 1452. The Middle Ages, a long
period of gloomy tower-keeps and
independent communes, were coming
to an end. The period of local lord¬
ships, government by the richest and
strongest, was coming in their place.
The gloomy old keeps were giving
way to luxurious palaces.
Leonardo arrived at Florence with
his father, Ser Piero, on their horse-
and-cart, for his father had decided
to move to the big city for good, to
work as a notary like his ancestors.
Leonardo was also accompanied by
Ser Piero's second wife, a young
woman called Albiera who took the
place of his mother.
We have no record of what hap¬
pened during that first period of
Leonardo's life at Florence. All we
do know is that Ser Piero sent his son
to do music arid grammar classes;
music consisted of learning to play
the flute and grammar meant learning
how to write. Then, in 1465, step¬
mother Albiera died and Ser Piero
married again. Leonardo's new
"mother" was called Francesca. By
now he was thirteen years old and
he had already decided what he was
going to be when he grew up: not a
notary, like his father, or his grand¬
father Antonio, but a painter.
It was quite by accident that Ser
Piero found out his son's secret am¬
bition. One day he went into Leo¬
nardo's room and came across a pile
of neatly rolled up papers and realized
that they were drawings. "Not bad at
all", Leonardo's father said to him¬
self. "In fact, they are pretty good."
Without wasting any further time
Ser Piero put the rolls of paper under
his arm and took himself off to show
them to Andrea di Cione, whom we
know as the painter Verrocchio.
"Listen, Maestro," said Ser Piero,
"I found these drawings done by my
son. What do you think of them?"
Verrocchio looked at Leonardo's
drawings one after the other, paying
ever more careful attention, then he
asked: "How old is this lad?"
"Just seventeen", was the answer.
"Then bring him round to me. He
can live in my house. I'll turn him
into a great painter."
The next day young Leonardo,
accompanied by his father in abrusque,

30 in 1482, when he left for Milan.
serious mood, entered Verrocchio's
workshop as an apprentice. He did
not feel out of place or nervous, and
he didn't have to face his strict new
teacher on his own. A crowd of young
pupils welcomed him noisily among
them: these were all young boys of
his own age, and they too were to
become famous in their own ways.
The oldest were Sandro Filipepi,
also known as Botticelli, and Pietro
Vannucci, known as Perugino. Amongst
the younger pupils of Verrocchio were
such names as Lorenzo di Credi, Fran¬
cesco Botticini and Francesco di
Simone. Surrounded by friends like
these, in those enormous studios full
of blocks of chalk and marble, with
tables loaded with brushes and paints,
Leonardo felt happy in the constant
atmosphere of hard work and creation.
He willingly carried out the most
humdrum tasks, sweeping the floor,
washing the dishes, grinding the colour
substances, preparing the paints,
cleaning the brushes and posing for
his master who was working on a
statue of David.
But what occupied him more than
anything else was keeping his eyes on
everything that was going on around
him, soaking in every experience so
that he would soon know the tricks of
the trade. A little later he was en¬
trusted with the task of preparing the"
plaster for the frescoes; then he was
allowed to transfer some of the "car¬
toons" (the word used to describe the
plan the painter works from) on to
the wall; finally he was given the
brushes and told to touch up some of
the work on the wall which Verrocchio
had done himself.
One day Verrocchio had assigned
Leonardo the job of painting an
angel's head on a large canvas which
represented "The Baptism of Christ".
He noticed that the angel's head which
he had already done on the painting
wasn't so impressive as Leonardo's.
The story goes that Verrocchio picked
up his brushes and broke them, as if
he was declaring that from then on
he wouldn't have anything more to do
with painting.
From this period in Leonardo's life
come many sketches and studies of .

where he was apprenticed at the age of 17.

a monument of Bartolomeo Colleoni,
the military captain, seated on his
steed. Leonardo often amazed his
fellow-apprentices by drawing with
his left hand, and he always wrote
from right to left, back to front, like
a wizard scribbling out his spells.
One day, when he was twenty-two
years old, he decided to join the Guild
of San Luca, an association of artists;
so he left Verrocchio's workshop to set
up in business on his own, as we
would say nowadays. Lorenzo the
Magnificent gave him a contract to
draw a Madonna, another patron
asked him for an "Annunciation", then
he was asked for a Saint Jerome, and
an "Adoration of the Magi".
His own father asked him to paint
the wheel of a cart for a peasant from
his home town of Vinci. He never
refused anybody, he took all his jobs
seriously, even the wheel, which he
adapted into a kind of grotesque
monster. With every task he under
took, Leonardo aimed to arrive at an
even greater perfection, until eventu¬
ally he had to give up and leave his
works unfinished. This was the hidden
drama of Leonardo's whole life.
Leonardo, however, was not just a
painter. He also did sculpture. Earlier
on he had modelled a number of
human heads and a Via Crucis. Later
on he was to sculpt an enormous horse.
He was also a musician. He could
play the flute and the lyre, and people
who knew him have recorded that he
"sang exquisitely".
At Vinci he had learnt from his uncle
Francesco to distinguish the different
plants and the effects they had: this
means that he was also a skilled botan¬
ist and knew about herbs. At Florence
he had come to know a number of
famous doctors, and even started to
study anatomy. At night he would slip
into the hospital's mortuary to dissect
the dead bodies and then sketch the
various organs of the human body.

He studied the way rivers flow, and
made plans for canals that ships could
sail down. He read history books and
books about the art of warfare, then
he promptly sat down to invent strange
new war engines. He studied buildings
closely, among them the Cathedral of
Florence where Verrocchio had placed
an enormous ball of copper on the
lantern (the open structure on top of
the dome) designed by the great archi¬
tect Brunelleschi, and he thought up
extraordinary machines that could lift
and transport huge weights in the air.
He watched the way that birds fly and
dreamt of a machine that would allow
men to fly through the sky.
He analyzed the sea-bed and could
already picture a frogman's suit and
mask in his mind's eye. He watched
men at work, and anticipated modern
cybernetics and "time and motion"
studies by working out machines that
could cut out some of their movements
and save them trouble.
He read the works of Greek and
Latin philosophers, until he could
discuss their ideas in such a way as to
impress his listeners. He was not rich,
but the generosity of those who ap¬
preciated his genius meant that he
could live in the style of a prince. He
was handsome, tall and strong: with
his hands he was capable of bending a
horseshoe. Yet he was also' gentle and
refined, full of help for others and never
boastful.
He appreciated everything about life,
and knew how to pick out the good side
of things, the most noble and attractive r

k side to life. He was a great lover of
Nature: nowadays we would call
him an "ecologist". He even planned
an ideal city with lots of greenery and
criss-crossed by canals, the streets
carried overhead and the houses
tucked underneath.
He also loved animals. Whenever
he saw birds in a cage, he would buy
them in order to let them go. He
considered everything to be a "wonder
of the universe", and whatever he set
eyes on seemed to him to reveal the
hand of its creator, God, whom he
called "The Prime Mover".
Leonardo, then, was a man of the
future, the first and most deeply
convinced citizen of the world.
At the age of thirty Leonardo went
to Milan, to the court of Lodovico il
Moro, who had asked Lorenzo de
Medici for a sculptor to carry out a
monument in memory of his father
Francesco Sforza.
There is an extraordinary letter
which Leonardo sent to the Duke of
Milan just after his arrival in the
Lombard capital. In this letter he
makes a list of all the things he knew
how to do, like making giant slings
and gun-shot for bombardment, self-
propelling cannons, tanks, multiple
machine-guns and siege platforms.
24
At the end of the letter he even states
that he can out-class all others at
architecture, painting and sculpture,
and challenges the Duke to put these
abilities to the test.
Leonardo was taking quite a risk.
Lodovico il Moro could have simply
locked him up as a starry-eyed lunatic.
Instead, the Duke summoned Leo¬
nardo to his presence, listened to what
he had to say and gave him the task
of raising the monument to his father.
He also gave him the official title of
"Engineer to the Duke."
It was at Milan that Leonardo
revealed another ofhis secret passions:
the art of staging elaborate shows,
making him the equivalent of what we
understand by the word "director".
He produced an allegorical represent¬
ation called "Paradise" for the mar¬
riage of Gian Galeazzo Sforza to
Isabella of Aragon, as well as the
"Joust" for Lodovico's wedding to
Beatrice d'Esté, and both perform¬
ances have become legendary.
In the first show the seven planets
were seen following their orbits
round a star-studded sky, accompanied
by music and singing, while the
chariot of the sun, drawn along by
steaming horses (an extraordinary
example of self-propelling machinery),
slowly crossed the stage. In the other
show, the "Joust", a live horse
covered with golden scales stole the
scene, with a ram's head and a fitted
tail that would have suited a serpent.
From this period which Leonardo
spent at Milan there remain famous
works like the painting The Virgin of
the Rocks, of which a version by
Leonardo's sole hand is in Paris, and
a version by both Leonardo and the
Milanese artist De Prédis in a gallery
From an early age Leonardo carried out
meticulous studies of human anatomy.
He made this drawing (about 1 508) of the
dissection of the principal organs of a woman.

in London. He also did a "Madonna"
for Matthew Corvino, the King of
Hungary, and a portrait of a girl with
a stoat in her arms, as well as a
portrait of a woman in profile, who
may well be Beatrice d'Esté.
Lastly there is the stupendous
Cenacolo (painting of Jesus' Last
Supper), which has its own tragic
story. What happened is this: Lodo¬
vico il Moro gave Leonardo the task
of painting Christ's Last Supper with
his Disciples .on to a wall of the
dining-room in the Dominican convent
One of Leonardo's secret passions was the
staging of elaborate spectacles or shows on
festive occasions. For the marriage of Gian
Galeazzo Sforza to Isabelle of Aragon he
put on an allegorical representation called
"Paradise", in which a chariot of the sun
crossed the stage drawn by a fuming,
snorting horse, shown in photo below.

Leonardo", directed by Renato Castellani

Leonardo contemplates the Last Supper, the
monumental composition he executed in
Milan, on a wall of the refectory of the
Dominican Convent of Our Lady of the Graces
in a scene from the Italian film on Leonardo.
Around Leonardo are the sketches from
which he worked to complete the painting.
Below left, one of Leonardo's preliminary
studies for the Last Supper.
L of Our Lady of the Graces (Santa
Maria delle Grazie). Leonardo went
straight to work: he even stopped
passers-by in the street so as to fix
some detail of movement or facial
appearance in his mind's eye.
Night and day he worked on sketches
and plans for the various characters
in his mural, until the cartoon was
ready in every detail. Unlike other
artists, who had always tended to
depict the Last Supper as a gloomy
meeting before the final Passion, Leo¬
nardo's plan was to paint the exact
moment when Christ uttered the words
"One of you will betray me!" Horror,
indignation and amazement were to
be expressed on the faces of the
Apostles, while Jesus would be seated
motionless in the centre, isolated and
detached from the passionate reaction
ofhis followers.
But the ever-scientific Leonardo
wanted to test out a new kind of
plaster, made up out of three separate
layers of stucco. When he had finished
the painting, and the people of Milan
crowded into the refectory to admire
the completed masterpiece, Leonardo
sadly realized that the layers of stucco
were not capable of resisting the out¬
side temperature to the same degree.
This meant that his great painting
would not last for very long. Fifty
years later it was already wrecked,
though we can still gain an idea of the
original when we look at it today.
As soon as the painting was finished
Leonardo had to leave Milan for Venice.
The French troops of King Louis XII,
under the command of Trivulzio, had
entered Milan after the retreat of Lodo-
Leonardo devoted two compositions to the
theme of The Virgin and Child with Saint
Anne. The first version, shown here, is
known as the Burlington House Cartoon from
the collection to which it formerly belonged.
Most authorities date it from about 1498-99.

crossbowmen found an immense horse
fashioned out of clay in a courtyard.
They had no way of knowing that it
was Leonardo's model for the monu¬
ment to Francesco Sforza, ready for
its final casting into bronze. For that
matter they would not even have
known who Leonardo was. They play¬
ed a game of knocking it to pieces,
aiming at it with their crossbows to see
who could hit it most often.
From Venice Leonardo moved back
to Florence again, but this time he
was returning to his city with a solid
reputation built up over twenty years.
He took lodgings with the Servants of
Mary, in the Convent of SS. Annun-
ziata, for he had promised them a
painting of St. Anne and the Madonna
for the main altar.
Everyone wanted something from
him, every organization wanted his
advice and recommendations. The
Secretary of the Florentine Republic,
Niccolô Machiavelli, even asked him
if he could divert the waters of the
river Arno, which flows into the sea
at Pisa, in order to starve out the
Pisans who were at war with Florence

Leonardo never felt like refusing; his
favourite motto was "I am never tired
of serving others". But the friars of
SS. Annunziata were impatient, so
Leonardo locked himself in a room of
the convent to work on the St. Anne
and Madonna painting, and in less than
a month the cartoon was ready.
For three whole days the people of
Florence filed past Leonardo's design
in a solemn procession. Amongst
them was Pier Soderini, the ageing

k sculptor who had recently returned
from Rome where he had completed
a stupendous Pietà. His name was
Michelangelo Buonarroti.
Writers of the time tell us that the
rivalry that developed between Leo¬
nardo and Michelangelo was intense.
It began when Soderini assigned
Michelangelo a block of marble which
had been lying behind the Cathedral
for more than sixty years and had
already caught Leonardo's interest.
While Michelangelo was chiselling
away at that marble to create his
famous David, Leonardo had gone to
Romagna with the rank of "Architect
and general,, engineer" to its duke,
Cesare Borgia.
When he got back to Florence he
found that he had been chosen as one

rY
of the committee who were to decide
what to do with Michelangelo's David.
Michelangelo was irritated by Leonar¬
do's presence on the committee, and
they spoke rudely to each other.
When Soderini offered Leonardo a
wall of the Great Council Hall of the
Palazzo Vecchio to paint a battle
scene, Michelangelo asked for the
other wall to paint another battle
scene on. This request was granted,
and an. elegant contest developed bet¬
ween the two great artists, which was
watched and followed by the whole of
Florence.
Both painters sought to excel them¬
selves, rather than each other. Leo¬
nardo's cartoons, depicting the battle
of Anghiari, and those of Michelangelo,
dealing with an incident from the
battle of Caseína, were shown to the
general public at different times and
places. The Italian artist and metal¬
worker Benvenuto Cellini was later to
call them "the school of the world."
In the meantine Leonardo was
working on the portrait of a beautiful
but rather melancholy woman, the
celebrated "Gioconda", or "Mona Lisa."
After he had completed the cartoons
for his battle scene, Leonardo began
to paint his subject on to the wall
of the Palazzo Vecchio. Yet once again
the demon temptation of experiment
led him astray. He had found in a
work by the Latin writer Pliny a for¬
mula for a special plaster used by the
ancient Romans called "encaustic".
It was a kind of paste, based on a
mixture of oily substances and Greek
pitch, dried out against a flame to
make the colours sharp and brilliant
like enamel.
Leonardo made a series of successful
tests, then decided to use the encaustic
process for his Battle of Anghiari
mural. But when his ambitious project
was already nearing completion and
only the upper half remained to be
done, Leonardo discovered that the
flame was too far away and the colours
could not be hardened into place.
It was a desperately sad night for
him: the colours were beginning to run,
and Leonardo anxiously ordered more
wood to be burned in the large brazier
which was suspended by a pulley near
the painting. But by now it was too late
and the flame failed to harden the
colours: by being brought too close to
the wall it even spoiled the colours
which had already dried. In the space
of one hour Leonardo's planned mas¬
terpiece was ruined.
With an icy feeling in his heart
Leonardo fled to a friend's house in the
nearby village of Fiesole. But here he
was destined to meet with another
failure. After years of study he had
finally rigged up a mysterious "flying
machine". Everything was ready for an
imposing test run, and this took place
on Mount Ceceri (which means
"swan"). But the human swan (an
assistant of Leonardo's) could not get
up into the air with the machine and
LEONARDO AND FLIGHT
Leonardo was one of the great forerunners
of modern aviation. On these pages
we can see a few examples
of his revolutionary ideas.
One of his most cherished dreams was
to enable men to "take to the air"
by various means. After years of study

were dashed. Photo, the start of the ill-fated
test, is from the Italian film on Leonardo.

stay there. He managed to cover a few
metres and then plunged into the
bushes underneath him. Thus another
long-cherished dream was shattered.
By now he was happy to leave Flo¬
rence, and went back up to Milan. The
King of France, Louis XII, wanted him
in his court, and the Governor of
Milan, Charles of Amboise, heaped
him with honours and favours. Leo¬
nardo recovered his nerves again,
started enjoying his friends' company,
and went back to his scientific research.
He painted a series of Madonnas for
the King, which are now unfortunately
lost.
But political upheavals made it
necessary for Leonardo to leave Milan.

The French thought it best to retreat
back over the Alps, and Leonardo took
refuge in Vaprio d'Adda, at the home
of his young pupil Francesco Melzi.
Meanwhile Pope Julius II had died
at Rome, and Cardinal Giovanni de
Medici, son of Lorenzo the Magni¬
ficent, had been elected Pope with the
title Leo X. Gradually the artists began
to flock to Rome from all over Italy,
and Leonardo decided to go too. Giu-
liano de' Medici, the youngest of
Lorenzo's sons, put him up as a guest
in his palace and gave him various
commissions: a portrait of a woman,
research into optical mirrors, and a
project to reclaim the Pontine marshes.
France, however, was planning to
recapture Lombardy, which now had
an alliance with the Pope. Louis XII
was dead, and his successor, the youth¬
ful Francis I, made a quick move
across the Alps and defeated the
defending Italian force at Marignano.
Leonardo had left Rome with the
court of Giuliano de' Medici, who was
commander in chief of the Pope's
army. But Giuliano fell sick and
stopped at Florence, where he died.
Leonardo continued with the army
as far as Piacenza. The Pope then
came up to Bologna, in an attempt to

by a diplomatic conference with the
French monarch. Because he knew
that Francis I was a great art-lover,
the Pope called for a number of
artists, including Leonardo, to be
present at the conference.
When Leonardo was presented to
the French king he was as amazed as
everybody else when the king came
up and embraced him with the words
"My father...!"
Two days later Leonardo accepted
the king's invitation to go to Amboise
in France, where His Majesty would
make a whole castle, Clos-Lucé, per¬
sonally available to him.
Now begins the long slow twilight
of Leonardo's life. Helped by his faith¬
ful pupil Francesco Melzi, the ageing
artist began to reorganize his writings
and drawings in order to collect all his
research into a "corpus", or grand
encyclopaedia containing ancient, med¬
ieval and contemporary knowledge.
The French king never asked for
specific paintings from Leonardo, he
was content just to go and see him
and hear what he had to say about
things. Later on Cellini would say:
"I heard the king declare that he did
not believe there could be a single man
in the world who knew as much as
Leonardo... and that Leonardo was a
supreme philosopher."



As a favour to the king, Leonardo
drew up an astonishing project for a
canal system in the Loire. He planned
a castle for the king's residence and
organized an enormous festival mar¬
ked by the appearance on stage of a
roaring lion which hears the king's
name and then tears its breast with its
talons, causing a cascade of French
lilies to come out of it. W

the most famous painting in the world.

In his death agony, on May 2, 1519,
Leonardo imagined that King Francis
of France had entered his bedroom.
at Amboise. This legend has been
immortalized in this famous drawing
by the French painter Ingres.
k In the peaceful surroundings of
Amboise Leonardo relived in solitude
his long life of toil, and wrote in his
diary: "A well spent life is a long one."
A kite flew above the castle of
Amboise. It was spring, May 2nd in
the year 1519. In his ill-lit room
Leonardo was dying. He had a vision
of the king hurrying to be with him,
already arriving down below in the

courtyard, and yet nobody came to
his side. He wanted to call out aloud,
but his voice would not obey him.
Finally a rough, indistinct sound
emerged from his lips. His pupil Melzi
heard him, and rushed in to lift Leo¬
nardo onto the pillows and arrange
round the dying man's shoulders the
fine cloak which he always wore when
Francis I came to visit him. In his
feverish delirium Leonardo then im¬
agined that the king was coming into
the room, approaching his bedside
and embracing him in tears.
Leonardo was overcome by his
emotion and closed his eyes.
This legend, for that is all we can
call it, has been immortalized in a
famous drawing by Ingres. But if
Leonardo did not die in the arms of the
King, it was only because Francis I
was far away from Amboise at the
time. Otherwise he would have rushed
like a son to Leonardo's bedside, and
the legend would have been made into
reality. Bruno Nardini

look strange. The one on the left has
two broad slits on the side of the tube,
and the other has one long, thin slit.
Fortunately we have an explanatory
text in Leonardo's most beautiful
calligraphy, running from right to left:
"These two flutes do not change their
tone by leaps as most wind instru¬
ments do, but in the manner of the
human voice; and one does it by
moving the hand up and down just as
with the coiled trumpet and more so
in the pipe a; and you can obtain one
eighth or sixteenth of the tone and just
as much as you want."
Obtaining an eighth or a six¬
teenth obviously means in acoustical
language to reach the upper octaves;
and "moving the hand up and down"
evidently means not to stop pre¬
arranged finger holes, but to move
along the silts to change pitch gradu¬
ally, or as we say today, to produce
glissandos, or gliding tones.
Where could he have found the idea
or a model for his glissando pipes?
The clue lies in the words "the human
voice", though I must confess that
I found the solution by chance and
then had it confirmed by Leonardo's
own words. The model for our glis¬
sando pipes is found in the larynx,
and it is significant that Leonardo calls
the larynx "the human voice", applying
this term to the machinery that
produces the voice as well.
Leonardo made designs of the
larynx and the trachea, now in Windsor
Castle, in which we recognize im¬
mediately that the upper opening
resembles that of a recorder. Fur¬
thermore, in accompanying texts in the
anatomy manuscripts the trachea is
called fistola, 'fthich is also the name
of a vertical flute such as the recorder.
There is, though, one flaw in our
analogy: Leonardo wrongly attributed
the change of pitch of the human voice
to the narrowing or widening of the
cartilage rings of the trachea and
failed to observe the function of the
vocal cords in the larynx. This failure
was probably caused by the technical
difficulty of dissecting the small and
fragile larynx. (By the way, Leonardo's
drawings are thought to have been
based on the anatomy of an ox.)
Still, we have in Leonardo's glis¬
sando recorder a new musical instru¬
ment which opened, or could have
opened, a new musical horizon; which
works well (some reconstructions that
I have made function perfectly); and
which was patterned after an ana¬
tomical analogy, that of the larynx,
even though Leonardo misunderstood
its actual function. Hence we have
here a positive result built upon
wrong premises.
The Madrid Codices contain only a
few pages devoted to musical matters,
but they add considerably to our
knowledge of Leonardo's interest in
music and musical instruments and to
our comprehension of his indefatigable
mind, so overwhelmed by new ideas,
associations, and technological im¬
agination that he could cope with this
onslaught only by jotting down passing
thoughts, often so sketchily that im-
ln drawing, above from Codex Arundel,
Leonardo has combined three drums into
a single instrument. It consists of three
shallow boxes beaten by mechanism
attached to left of drum, and was intended
to produce a chord of three tones. Models
have been made of most types of drum
sketched by Leonardo and they have
been found to work well.
portant details, which he evidently
took for granted, are neither delineated
nor explained in his comments.
One of Leonardo's drawings of
musical instruments In the Madrid
Codices is of a bell with a wide rim.
Instead of a clapper inside, ¿fcwo
hammers strike the rim from opposite
sides. To the left of the bell there is
a mechanism including what seems to
be a set of four keys operating on
a tracker action that in its turn controls
four levers ending in oval heads. In
my opinion, these heads must be
dampers. The accompanying text says,
"The same bell will appear to be four
bells. Organ keys with a fixed bell.
And when struck by two hammers,
there will be a change of tones as in
an organ."
Acoustically important in this ex¬
planation are the indication that the
bell is firm, neither swinging nor
equipped with a clapper In the manner
of a church bell, and the statement
that It produces "a change of tones",
which is in all probability one of pitch,
not of timbre.
Thus Leonardo must have believed
that the upper section of the bell has
ring-shaped areas that produce tones
of different pitch If they are slightly
muted when the rim is set into
vibration by the hammers. It is in¬
teresting that Leonardo, here as in
many other of his musical inventions,
tried to obtain from one instrument
what could normally be produced only
by several instruments or by an entire
set of instruments.

Another of Leonardo's brilliant solutions
to the problem of obtaining different tones
from a single drum is shown in sketch
above from Codex Arundel. This drum has
holes in its sides like a flute. It has been
reconstructed by the author of this article,
who found that by closing the various
holes while beating the drum he could
in fact obtain differences in pitch.

devices, mechanisms using the spring
principle to obtain a constant motor
drive, cog-wheels to transmit motion,
and so on. Leonardo pays consider¬
able attention to the problem of reduc¬
ing friction and comes up with some
ingenious solutions.
Here I should like to develop several
observations by Carlo Zammattio, who
has pointed out how absorbed Leo¬
nardo was In water-courses when he
was in Lombardy. Leonardo was inte¬
rested in water and the uses it could
be put to, such as providing power for
machines, driving a mill-wheel, etc.
A particularly compelling example of
the way Leonardo proceeds to a uni¬
versal rule from his observation of a
specific phenomenon is provided by
his method of working out the
"powers" (i.e. the motor force) of a
series of jets of water pouring from
apertures of the same size but at
various different heights in a recep¬
tacle which is kept full of water at the
same level. Now, Leonardo is aware
that the force behind the individual
jets remains Identical.
This is how he explains the pheno¬
menon: each particle of water, once
it falls free from the aperture, responds
exclusively to its own weight and
acquires an impetus which produces
a corresponding force of impact if It
meets something in its path. But in
the original receptacle, the water par¬
ticles are subject not only to their own
weight, but also to the weight of all
the water that lies above them.
So when the jets of water emerge
from their apertures at varying heights
and fall towards the same horizontal
surface below them, the force of their
impact is bound to remain constant,
because their "power" is a sum of the
weight of the column of water that
pressed down on them in the recep¬
tacle and the velocity acquired during
their downward trajectory once releas¬
ed from it. Hence the more the one
increases, the less the other becomes,
and vice versa.
Zammattio points out that the method
and conclusions in this analysis by
Leonardo correspond to the theorem
enunciated in 1738 by Daniel Bernoulli,
in other words, the fundamental equa¬
tion of hydrodynamics. Such were
the formidable results which Leonardo
was capable of drawing from minute
observation.
A number of other comments remain
to be made in connexion with Leo¬
nardo's Madrid II Codex. There is,
for example, a passage which immedi¬
ately became famous because of its
obvious reference to Leonardo's mural
for the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence,
The Battle of Anghiari, which was
ruined before completion:
"Friday the 6th of June, 1505, at the
stroke of the thirteenth hour I began
to paint in the Palace. As I lowered
the brush, the weather changed for the
worse and the bell started to toll,
calling the men to the court. The
cartoon was torn, water poured down
and the vessel of water that was being
carried broke. Suddenly the weather
became even worse and it rained very
heavily till nightfall. And the day
turned to night."
Some persons have considered this
passage as a solemn record of the day
on which Leonardo began to paint The
Battle of Anghiari; this interpretation
does not seem to me to have a solid
basis. This is a typical reference to
an exceptional meteorological occur¬
rence. These always fascinated Leo¬
nardo, and as well as arousing his
scientific curiosity about their natural
causes, stimulated the fantastic, apo¬
calyptic side of his imagination.
A long list of Leonardo's books
comes next, containing 116 titles. It
is the longest list of book holdings
that Leonardo has recorded in any of
his manuscripts, and therefore consti¬
tutes a precious source of information
about the authors which he drew on.
There is also a shorter and more
cursory list of fifty books. The titles
are not recorded and the books are
simply grouped according to their
shape and size. This list almost
certainly refers to autograph manu¬
scripts by Leonardo himself.
There are also some superb colour¬
ed maps of the Arno valley and the
plain of Pisa, drawn up as part of
Leonardo's research into a plan to
divert the course of the Arno in order
to cut Pisa off from the sea at a time
when the Pisans were at war with
Florence. These maps can be dated
to the summer of 1503. Also there
are the red chalk sketches of moun¬
tains which we have already
referred to.
A side of Leonardo's activities which
was completely unknown until the
discovery of the Madrid II Codex is
revealed in the repeated references
around November and December 1504
to Leonardo's work on the harbour
and citadel of Piombino. The Codex
contains many drawings dealing with
problems of architecture and forti¬
fications.
Once again the insatiable student
of nature that Leonardo was could not
resist the proximity of the sea, and in
the Madrid II manuscript we find notes
on currents, winds and navigation.
There are also drawings of sailing ships
in the different positions they adopt
according to the changing direction of
the wind. Often these drawings are
no more than a few rapid strokes but
they are always strikingly evocative.
Then come drawings and notes on
the flight of birds, descriptions dealing
with aspects of painting, comments on
geometry, proportion, and so on. The
quantity of material is breathtaking.
However, Codex Madrid II is not a
single manuscript. It actually contains
two separate manuscripts. The folios
numbered 141 to 157 verso make up a
separate section entirely devoted to
the casting of the "Great Horse of
Milan" for the monument to Francesco
Sforza. This monument was never
cast. Leonardo protracted his research
into it for so long that the duke
eventually used the bronze which he
had allocated for the horse to smelt
some cannons instead. Nonetheless,
the detailed studies which Leonardo
made for the project and which he
records in these pages are packed
with bold and ingenious solutions.
Taken together, the two Madrid
Codices cover a long period of time,
from 1491, a date which can be found
in the part devoted to the casting of
the Great Horse, to 1505, the date of
the projected Battle of Anghiari mural.
This period stands at the very centre
of Leonardo's creative span, covering
his experience at Milan and Florence,
his activities as "engineer general" to
Cesare Borgia, and (as we now know
from Codex Madrid II) his service as
an engineer to other local despots,
such as the Duke of Piombino.
Above all, the Madrid notebooks
were rediscovered at a time when
Leonardo studies were directed more
at the contents of da Vinci's manu¬
scripts than his paintings and other
works of art proper. The immense
range of subject matter found in the
notebooks, especially the scientific
and engineering studies, has come to
light at a time when the world is
increasingly interested in science and
technology and their history.
The forthcoming publication of the
facsimile edition of the Madrid Co¬
dices, reproducing the beauty and
elegance of the originals, will place
a unique fund of new knowledge at
the disposal of scholars and the
general public everywhere.

changed his mind and decided to cast
it upside down to allow proper distribution
of the molten bronze. See illustration

NN 1482 Leonardo wrote a remarkable letter to the
lruler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza. In it, the brilliant
. /and self-confident young man of thirty offered his
\~S services as engineer and architect, and at the end
of the letter, in a cunning attempt to arouse Lodovlco's
interest, he suggested that "the bronze horse may be taken
In hand, which is to be to the immortal glory of the prince
your father of happy memory..."
He was referring to the equestrian statue which Lodovico
wanted to construct of his father Francesco Sforza.
Leonardo was hired as an engineer by Lodovico and
during the next ten years or so he pondered and planned
how to construct this great monument, in the intervals
between amusing the court with entertainments and paint¬
ing The Last Supper.
Originally the bronze statue was to be life-size, but as
Lodovico's power and ambitions mounted, so did the size of
the monument. Finally the horse alone was to be over
23 feet high. To cast it, 100 tons of bronze would be
required. No sculpture of this size had ever been attempted
before.
Leonardo wanted to cast the colossal statue in a single
operation to avoid the disfiguring seams which mar statues
cast in several pieces. But existing technology was inade¬
quate for a single casting on such a scale.
By May 1491 Leonardo had completed a full-scale clay
model of the great horse. It was unveiled in the old yard
of Lodovico's ducal residence at a betrothal ceremony
in November 1493, and became one of the wonders of
Milan. But the horse was never cast. In 1494 the bronze
set aside for it was sent to Lodovico's brother-in-law to be
made into cannon.
For centuries no one could be sure whether Leonardo
had solved the intractable problems of casting on such a
massive scale. Now the problem is clarified by almost
twenty fascinating pages in the second Madrid notebook
in which we can actually see Leonardo thinking aloud about
the casting. These notes are virtually a treatise on casting
problems. *

mould. It "can be made in one day", he notes. "Half a
boatload of plaster will serve you. Good." He decides to
cast the horse on its side. Then he changes his mind and
thinks that It would be better upside down. He draws the
bolts which will hold the outside mould together. The
ideas tumble onto the page from his fertile brain.
Leonardo abandoned the traditional "lost-wax" method
of casting, whereby a wax model was created over a clay
core, an outer mould applied, the wax then being heated and
drained off, to be replaced by the molten bronze. The
worst disadvantage Is that the original model is lost.
Leonardo's method was much more complex. He does
not describe it fully In the Madrid manuscript, but it can
be more or less reconstructed as follows. First an outer
female plaster mould was to be made from the original clay
model. This outer mould was then to be lined with wax or
potter's clay and inside it a male mould of refractory clay
was to be made.
This male mould would then be baked, the wax or clay

lining removed, and in the empty space between the two
moulds a wax countermodel cast. All imperfections were
to be eliminated from this wax model and then a new
female mould of refractory clay was to be made over it.
The wax would then be heated and tapped off, the outside
mould removed, strengthened, and then refitted on the
male.
The molten bronze would then be poured in.
This was the new system Leonardo devised. Historical
circumstances deprived him of an opportunity to put it
completely to the test.
The great clay horse came to a sad end too. When
the French conquered Milan in 1499, their bowmen used
the horse for target practice. It cracked, and then fell to
pieces. The mould was also soon lost.
It is interesting to note that some 200 years later when
a huge equestrian statue of Louis XIV was constructed in
Paris in 1699, the moulding and casting process used was
almost identical with Leonardo's.
Leonardo's manuscripts are filled with countless
sketches of horses, showing his unceasing
study of their various postures and movements,
which he drew without compromising the
spontaneous quality of real horses. Many
sketches, like the study of a foreleg above
from the Windsor Collection in England show
the minute precision with which he drew horses,
dividing their bodies into sections
and measuring them.

LEONARDO da Vinci spent many
years of his life as a restless
wanderer. After his early years
in the stimulating artistic climate
of Florence, his life reads like a
travelogue.
In 1482, at the age of thirty, he
moved to Milan to enter the service
of Lodovico il Moro as an engineer,
for in those days artists were
considered craftsmen and technicians
and it was common practice for them
to be interested in and work on
technical and scientific questions.
Then in the 1490s a period of change
and instability began in Italy. Lorenzo
the Magnificent died in Florence.
France (and later Spain and Austria)
invaded Italy. There was crisis in the
Duchy of Milan. And in Florence Savo¬
narola was organizing his Republican
experiment.
Amidst all this turmoil Leonardo first
went to work for the French, then
wandered from one Italian city to
another: to Mantua and the splendid
court of Isabella d'Esté, back to
Florence, to Urbino where he was
received by Cesare Borgia and then to
Rome. Finally in 1516 he moved to
France at the invitation of King
Francis I. When he died three years
later he had met and worked for some
of the most exceptional men of his
time and had lived through a period
of renaissance art and culture in Italy
and France, which was without parallel
in Europe.
EUGENIO GARIN, professor of the history
of philosophy at the University of Florence, is
internationally known for his studies on the
culture of the Renaissance and medieval
thought. He is the author of major works on
tenth-century Italian culture.
Yet, it would not be incorrect to say
that in many ways Leonardo was a
tragic figure. He was a man alone.
He had no family (he was an illegitimate
child) and had no social standing. He
knew that the world was breaking up
around him and that its values were
being swept aside by the blind force
of events. Amidst the wars and turmoil
surrounding him, he plodded on with
his eternal search for a supreme
harmony. Death cast its shadow over
everything: "I thought I was learning
how to live," Leonardo wrote, "but
I was learning how to die."
The lifeline which had once bound
the intellectual to the city was broken.
The idea of civic pride was on the
wane. Political power in Italy had
passed into the hands of rich
oligarchies and tyrants, some mean-
spirited, others able men. The in¬
tellectual was no longer a churchman.
In Leonardo's time he was a layman
who thought of himself first and fore¬
most as a technician ready to offer
his services to any ruler who was
interested. Leonardo would offer to
build a bridge across the Golden Horn
for the Sultan.
Referring to himself as "the infidel
called Leonardo," he wrote to the
Sultan as follows: "I, your servant,
have heard it said that you intended to
build this bridge but that you could not
do so because you could not find men
capable of doing it. Now I, your
humble servant, know how to build this
bridge and will build it."
Leonardo also undertook to build
a fortress for Cesare Borgia and a
model city for the ruler of Milan, duke
Lodovico il Moro. He set to work
designing all kinds of machines, such
as a device for flying from a mountain
top and a means of underwater
transport. He Invented ingenious
machines for use at court entertain¬
ments, and made elaborate war engines
to put paid to his patron's enemies.
(It didn't really matter to him who the
enemies were.) As an engineer, he
had a lot in common with the politician
of that period who was also scientist
and expert, chief among them being
Machiavelli.
The legend surrounding Leonardo,
as an expression of his own time and
a model for all ages, began to take
shape almost with Leonardo's death.
Its outlines are eloquently drawn by
Giorgio Vasari in the first edition of
his Lives of the Painters, published
in 1550, only thirty years after Leo¬
nardo died.
Vasari's Leonardo was a man fas¬
cinated by science, a passionate
enquirer into the mysteries of science
and nature, a man driven by the
curiosity of a magician oran astrologer.
"His capricious research led him to
natural philosophy," Vasari wrote, "to
study the properties of herbs and to
observe the movements of the heavens,
the moon's orbit and the progress of
the sun." And in this first edition of
his Lives, Vasari also added: "He
developed such a heretical stance that
he lost interest in religion of any sort,
perhaps more interested in being a
philosopher than a Christian."
However, Vasari, who was being
perfectly faithful to what Leonardo had
written about himself, omitted this
sentence from the second edition of
his Lives, published in 1568, in the
straitened atmosphere which set in
after the Council of Trent.
For Vasari, Leonardo had been the
incarnation of the Ideal man as de¬
lineated by the philosophical dis¬
cussion group centred on Lorenzo de
Medici. "The heavens often rain down
the richest gifts on human beings
naturally," Vasari wrote, "but some¬
times with lavish abundance bestow
upon a single individual beauty, grace
and ability, so that, whatever he does,
every action is so divine that he out¬
distances all other men, and clearly
displays how his genius is the gift of
God and not an acquirement of human
art. Men saw this in Leonardo da
Vinci."
Thus Vasari was simply depicting,
in his own way and according to the
perspective of his times, the man that
Leonardo had wanted to be. Not so
much the ¡mage of himself that Leo¬
nardo presented as the character
which he had delicately yet carefully
fashioned for himself.
The basic premise underlying all
Leonardo's work is that the artist, and
above all the painter (which is how
Leonardo primarily thought of himself),
must understand every object he
depicts if he is to be worthy of his
art, since his task is to represent
reality in all its facets. In other words,

he must know the whole world around
him: its Innermost secrets, its fun¬
damental laws, its origins and causes.
If we fail to understand this essential
fact about Leonardo then we risk
missing the point of his life's work.
Leonardo himself was perfectly
clear on this point. He declared that
the painter should be a "universal
master", capable of "imitating" through
art "all the different shapes which are
produced by nature." "The artist must
"first have a mental picture" of every
form. He must know the reasons for
everything. He must use his intellect
to master the brute force of the
elements, and he must learn how to
construct all kinds of machines and
devices which will enable him to
reproduce reality and triumph over it.
"The painter," Leonardo proclaims, 'is,
in conflict and competition with Nature; r
41

he is the Lord and Master of Nature."
It has been said that the enormous
mass of material in Leonardo's note¬
books gives the impression that he
intended to produce an encyclopaedia
of human knowledge. It is most pro¬
bable that this was indeed his purpose.
The idea was not a new one: Leo¬
nardo was acquainted with the en¬
cyclopaedias of the Middle Ages and
knew Pliny's Natural History, which
was widely read and admired during
the Renaissance. And Leonardo was
apparently much more aware than he
lets on of what was going on in the
"sciences" during this time.
The real novelty lay in his line of
approach. He did not simply seek to
accumulate facts and data or examples
of strange occurrences for his own
edification and contemplation. His
purpose was action: he wanted to
create, to become "Lord and Master"
over Nature. And so he strained to go
beyond what the senses observed and
sought to apprehend the deeper forces
which act on the senses.
It was precisely because he wanted
to produce in the eyes of the beholder
the effects that the real world
produces, and because he wished to
do so in a fresh, transfigured way, that
Leonardo felt that he had to reach
down into the roots of the visible world
and that he had to comprehend the
impulses which produce optical images.
If an artist wants to render all the
possible effects of light, Leonardo
reasoned, then he should learn what
light actually is, study light rays and
the laws governing their diffusion, the
structure of the eye and the charac¬
teristics, of sight. Before undertaking
to carve the human form, an artist
should have long practice in the
dissection of dead bodies. He should
be an expert in anatomy, have a good
knowledge of muscular movement, and
the whole process of movement in a
living body.

Similarly, to paint the macrocosm
that is, the world around us the artist
must study the anatomy of the uni¬
verse, scrutinize its subtlest fibres and
examine its every movement and
manifestation.
Leonardo's notebooks are the ex¬
traordinary fragments of this great
new-type encyclopaedia, based not on
texts or scholastic disputes, nor
indeed on superficial experiments, but
instead on studies in depth into the
unknown, using calculations, measure¬
ments, laws and elementary forms
which then make it possible to work
back to the surface of things, to
phenomena which we can understand
and thereby dominate, transform and
mould to our needs.
Such an encyclopaedia, as conceived
by Leonardo is not unlike a great
anatomical or physiological study of
the universe. Just as man is a world
in miniature (a microcosm) and in¬
corporates everything contained in the
universe (and hence is capable of
knowing everything, and can do and
become everything), so the world is
like a great living organism (a macro¬
cosm) with water. instead of blood as
its life-giving force, and its "causes"
that is, its mathematical laws are its
soul.
Light, motion and life these are the
fabric and structure of the universe.
We see that the chapters of the en¬
cyclopaedia fall naturally into place
with sections on optics, mechanics,
hydraulics, anatomy, biology, physi¬
ology and cosmology. Then come the
machines which enable man to rival
Nature. And finally we have the crown
and summit of It all, the science of
painting, which Leonardo saw as fun¬
damental and basic to the whole work.
For through art, according to Leonardo,
a new world is created inside the
world. This is the world of man the
"creator" and poet, a world which
triumphs over the existing world.
The world-view which found its most
extraordinary outlet in Leonardo cannot
obviously be considered his own
unique creation. The circles in which
he moved during the first thirty years
of his life had seen other distinguished
artists with a broad cultural back¬
ground including training In scientific
as well as literary disciplines.
Filippo Brunelleschi, for example, is
known to have carried on an intellec¬
tual exchange for many years with one
of the greatest mathematicians and
scientists of the century, Paolo Tosca-
nelli.
Italy had also known other en¬
cyclopaedic minds before Leonardo,
such as Lorenzo Ghiberti and Leon
Battista Alberti. Alberti, like Leonardo,

He hoped that this machine would
bring him "60,000 ducats a year", but
it is unlikely that it was ever constructed.
was a skilled artist. He had made a
special study of physics, mathematics
and optics because he felt they were
indispensable for an artist.
But throughout their lives these men
had preserved an attachment to their
cities. Leonardo on the other hand
is totally detached from the idea of
the city-state (Florence, Milan); his
science transcends civic and national
boundaries and has no ideological or
national loyalty.
Leonardo had nothing in common
with the humanist "dignitaries" of his
time or with the scholastics entrenched
in their cities, nor for that matter with
the artists attached to a particular
court or belonging to a specific school.
His patriotism extended quite simply
to the universe, to which he belonged
entirely, like his mathematics, science
and philosophy.
His architectural projects fired the
imagination of rulers such as Cesare
Borgia, Lodovico il Moro, the King of
France, and the Sultan of the Ottoman
Empire. Leonardo's work is inscribed
in great geometrical flourishes across
the open book of the universe.
Science and technology owe allegiance
to neither church nor country.
To understand Leonardo's detached
attitude, his wanderings from city to
city, his readiness to offer his
"secrets" to the sovereigns of so many
different lands, the above remarks
must be kept constantly in mind.
Leonardo's "secrets" were not, or not
only, his exquisite paintings; they were
weapons and instruments of war. But
for Leonardo they were nothing more
than machines that reflected man's
scientific Inventiveness, his drive to
interpret Nature and bend it to his
will. For him, these "instruments",
were neither good nor evil but simply
effective in other words, they did the
job required of them.
It is here, in his "detachment" as a
scientist and engineer, that Leonardo
parallels Machiavelli, an affinity much
more significant than the fact (not
without its own importance) that both
men passed briefly under the aegis
of Cesare Borgia in his court at Urbino.
The extraordinary synthesis achieved
by Leonardo reached its culmination,
as we have pointed out earlier, in
"painting", which for him, was charged
with very special meanings. Leonardo
saw the work of the painter as
dominating the process of human
knowledge. It was the ultimate goal
of scientific enquiry and the starting
point of creative endeavour. Creativity
and scientific research are not two
separate activities but part of the same
circular process with the artist standing
at the critical juncture. He is the
meeting point between knowledge and
action. More precisely, where know¬
ledge is transformed into creation.
It is no accident if Leonardo extols
the painter for he always attributes
special importance to the eye and the
act of visual perception, as well as
anything having to do with the world
of images.
Leonardo always tended to express
42

Leonardo's notebooks
contain many drawings,
diagrams and architectural
plans for an "Ideal City"
In a manuscript now at
the Institut de France,
Paris, Leonardo writes
that "A building should
always be detached on
all sides in order that
its true shape may be
seen." Leonardo wanted
the inhabitants of his
ideal city to enjoy as
much privacy as possible
and to this end devised
ingenious access systems
by staircase: above
right, building with
quadruple staircase, and,
above, a double spiral
staircase designed for
the "Ideal City". In
Codex Madrid II Leonardo
drew many architectural
studies and sketches,
using his ideas on private
corridors and staircases
to design a castle in
which the lord could see
what was going on
in the building.
his ideas in visual terms: "The
painter," he wrote, "should resemble
a mirror." He should welcome "the
multiplicity of things," not just their
external forms, but also their inner
properties and essence, and their
elementary geometric patterns, which
stand at the roots of perceptual ex¬
perience and allow us to understand it.
Hence the primacy of mathematics
over the evidence of the senses: "no
human enquiry can properly be called
science unless it passes by way of
mathematical reasoning," said Leo¬
nardo. Hence too the "philosophical"
importance of painting: "Anyone who
feels contempt for painting has no real
affection for philosophy . . . Painting
itself is philosophy because it captures
the movement of bodies through space
in their full spontaneity. And philos¬
ophy does exactly the same thing ..."
These two aspects of human activity,
knowledge and action, "seeing" and
"creating", cannot, therefore, be sep¬
arated. The circular process science-
engineering-art and seeing-doing is a
single unique activity.
For Leonardo, the invention and
construction of machines underscore
a number of important considerations:
(1) that technology and science are
inseparable, the two being linked by
the "mathematical" structure of all I

Leonardo is exclusively concerned with
social and hygienic goals, unlike most
architects of his time.

k things; (2) that the skeletal framework
of physical objects can be reduced to
a mechanical model; (3) that there is
a fundamental connexion between
mechanics and real life; (4) that
research into models based on visual
observation shows that "the eye is the
least fallible of all the human senses."
From all this we can clearly see the
perfect unity that existed in Leonard
encyclopaedia, in which it is absuiv.
to separate science, technology and
art. Vasari's mistake was to break, or
rather misunderstand, the close link
between these three domains, with the
result that he failed to see the real
significance of the work, and finally
concluded that it was an example of
Leonardo's madness and incoherence.
"He perpetrated many such follies,"
Vasari wrote, "he studied mirrors and
made curious experiments to find oil
for painting . . . His knowledge of art,
indeed, prevented him from finishing
many things which he had begun, for
he felt that his hand would be unable
to realize the perfect creations of his
imagination, as his mind formed such
difficult, subtle and marvellous
conceptions that his hands, skilful as
they were, could never have ex¬
pressed them ..."
Vasari referred to these activities
of Leonardo as "caprices". But in
reality they were part of an unending
search for the unifying factor in human
experience, for a meaning of the
created universe, for man's place
in the world. Here was the restless
beginning of a new era, a new way
of understanding art and science.
Each of Leonardo's thousands of
manuscript pages, with their awesome
entwining of fragments of minutely
detailed prose and delicately refined
illustrations, strange machines and
precisely sketched anatomy, not only
symbolizes man's perennial dreams
and aspirations but also expresses
a totally new way of considering man's
task on earth as an endless search
to master the transient stuff of reality.
I have taken care to stress Leo¬
nardo's extreme refinement in every¬
thing (whether it be his hand-writing
or the disdain he showed for the
literati). He was an exquisitely literate
man, and we know from the Madrid
notebooks that he possessed a rich
and widely diverse library.
All of Leonardo's "caprices" are
justified by an awareness that man
and his works are fragile. And here
perhaps is the sign, and the secret,
of Leonardo's relevance for all of us
today: the fact that he understood
and expressed with superlative skill
the enigmatic insecurity of man and
the mystery of his destiny and condi¬
tion, at a time when unforeseen and
unforeseeable possibilities were open¬
ing up in art and science.

THE GLORY by Carlo Pedretti
Reflections
on art
in the
Madrid II Manuscript
OF PAINTING
Photo O Anderson-Giraudon. Paris
Leonardo defined his whole approach to art
in Codex Madrid II. "Do not make the muscles
of your figures apparent", he writes, "because
even if they are in their right places they do not
show prominently unless the limbs in which
they are located are exerting great force or
are greatly strained." He criticizes "barren
and woody figures" and applies the phrases
"bag of nuts" and "bunch of radishes" to
nudes that are "woody and without grace."
Leonardo attacked many artists who were
guilty of this abuse, and in a manuscript
dating from 1513-1514 (known as "Manuscript E",
at the Institut de France in Paris) his Imprecation
appears to be a criticism of Michelangelo's
nudes in the Sistine Chapel, in Rome. Above
left, red chalk nude by Leonardo (about 1503-1504).
Above right, Adam and Eve expelled from Paradise,
detail of a fresco by Michelangelo on the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (1508-1510).
LIMBS which are not in exercise must be drawn
without showing the play of muscles. And if you
do otherwise, you will have imitated a sack of nuts
rather than a human figure."
This is one of the notes on painting found in the second
of the recently discovered Madrid Manuscripts of Leonardo
da Vinci dating from the first years of the 16th century.
It is of great interest because it illustrates how Leonardo
and Michelangelo differed sharply in their approach to
depicting the human form, particularly as portrayed in *
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes (1508-1510). For r
CARLO PEDRETTI Is the author of many books on Leonardo. The
latest, "Leonardo: A Study In Chronology and Style', was publishea
in 1973 by Thames and Hudson, London. He is a professor in the
Department of Fine Arts at the University of California, Los Angeles.
This article is inspired by a chapter on the "Notes on Painting in
the Madrid Manuscripts" published In Italian in his book "Leonardo
da Vinci Inédito" (Leonardo' da Vinci's unpublished works), published
by Barbera Editore, Florence, 1968.

k Leonardo, the human body was not an excuse for the
artist to show off his skill in depicting bulging muscles
unnecessarily.
This and the other notes on painting in Codex Madrid II
were written at a crucial moment of Leonardo's career, and
as such they reflect the innovations in the artistic theories
of the Cinquecento (16th century).
It is no longer the appearance of things that Leonardo is
concerned with, but their structure, so that he adopts a type
of drawing which moves away from atmospheric effects to
stress form: form which is defined by sharp contours and
by lines of shading which curve around it with deliberate
slowness.
It is no longer the Florentine gracefulness of the late
Quattrocento but a more heroic and herculean sense of
proportions which is reflected in his anatomical studies, and
in the studies for the warriors of his Battle of Anghiari,
which appear to conform, like a silent homage to Masaccio,
to the example provided by Michelangelo with his David,
completed in 1501.
Form is expressed by style; and by style I mean not only
Leonardo's art but also his thought as expressed by words,
for there is a close affinity between his writing and his
drawing. An example is given by a text already known, in
which Leonardo tells the painter how to retain the images
of human figures in action by using essential lines,
something like shorthand.
"In order to draw a head," says Leonardo, "make an O,
for an arm make a straight or bent line, and do the same
for the legs and bust, and when at home turn such notations
into perfect form."
However, our eye does not need to "turn" those notations
Into "perfect form"; on the contrary it is able to perceive
the impulse that has guided the artist's hand, and it is
undoubtedly seduced by the open touch, which leaves much
more to the imagination.

An eye of Mona Lisa. Leonardo began work
on the painting about 1501 and finished it
more than four years later (Louvre Museum, Paris).
The notes on painting in Leonardo's Codex Madrid II
pertain not only to the human figure but also to the problems
of light, shadow, and colour.
On one page Leonardo brings together two major aspects
of pictorial vision: the representation of colour "in per¬
spective", (that is, the colour of objects as it Is affected by
intervening atmosphere and therefore varying in intensity
according to the distance of the objects), and human
movement.
These aspects are further elaborated in other parts of the
manuscript, and while the first is treated with a considerable
degree of abstraction which can only be explained with the
language of the diagram, the second is exemplified by quick
notations of the human figure in action.
Some of them recall the sketches for the Battle of
Anghiari drawings of an energy which approaches fury,
done with an explosive line, such as the one at Windsor
in which Leonardo juxtaposes the screaming expressions of
men and animals, lions and horses. This is a sheet of
thoughts, more than the definite path of an idea for com¬
position: a search for the expression of human bestiality
in war.
In Codex Madrid II one can see how optics is closely
related to painting. One example: "The surface of every
opaque body takes on the colour of the object opposite
to It. But green subjects, such as meadows and other
such things should be arranged opposite the shadows of
green bodies, according to art, so that the shadows that
take on the colour of such an object do not lose their
quality and appear to be the shadow of a body other than
green; should you put bright red facing a green shadow,
the shadow will become reddish of a most ugly colour, and
will be very different from the true shadow of green."
Most Interesting here is the advice given to the painter
to make colour juxtapositions "according to art", so as to
achieve the kind of harmony that derives from retaining in

WHEN LEONARDO EYES
ARE SMILING
In Codex Madrid II, Leonardo states that the
human face and body are defined by the
light surrounding them. He notes that
reflected and refracted light as well as coloured
shadows are all what he calls "the truth
of colours". This may explain the affinity^
between the many faces he painted which
the photographic enlargements on this double
page clearly reveal, especially Leonardo's
rendering of the eyes and the smile. The
enlargements show how skilfully Leonardo
played with light and shadow in order to achieve
his enigmatic smile and beautifully expressive
eyes (thousands of pages have been written
about Mona Lisa's smile). In Codex Madrid II,
Leonardo advises the painter to strive for a
subtle blend of shadows which he describes
as "the gracefulness of shadows, smoothly
deprived of every contour". By so doing he
has given us his secret of how he achieved
such delicately nuanced forms in his models.
An eye of the lady in the portrait known as
the Belle Ferronnière. (Louvre Museum, Paris.)
a shadow the colour of its object (Leonardo refers to the
"true shadow") and by avoiding what he calls "very bad
shadows", which are those affected by the reflection of
another object of different colour, as would be the case
with a green object that comes to produce a reddish shadow.
All the elements of Leonardo's painting are present in the
theories expressed in the Madrid Manuscript. Another
series of notes, in addition to those on form and colour,
deals with light and shadow and the smooth transition from
light to shadow, which is the true essence of the famous
Leonardo sfumato. The notes on this subject in the newly
discovered manuscript are numerous, but it is interesting
to note that each one takes into account the element of
colour.
When in the first period of his activity Leonardo was
dealing with the problem of light and shadow he conceived
of objects in terms of geometrical entities and was mainly
concerned with the study of the gradations and degrees of
intensity of the shadows.
After 1500 his major concern becomes the study of light
and shadow on objects placed in the open air, thus taking
into account colour and reflections. Light becomes the
vehicle that blends the elements of landscape into a har¬
mony of transitions from colour to colour, and this Leonardo
calls "grace".
The human figure too becomes part of the landscape (one
thinks of the Mona Lisa, The Virgin and St. Anne, Leda) and
thus participates in the phenomena of reflection, refraction,
and Interplay of coloured shadows, as is the case with every
other object placed under the light of the sky. What can
be seen under the projection of a roof is also to be seen
under the chin of a human face.
One of Leonardo's most beautiful observations pertains
to the way a human face should be represented. He
advises the painter to arrange the setting so as to achieve ^
the most delicate sfumato effects in the shadows, what he r
The smile of St. John the Baptist. The smile of the lady in the Belle Ferronnière. 47

calls "the gracefulness of shadows, smoothly deprived
of every sharp contour."
The setting is provided by the walls of the houses flanking
a street, through which the light penetrates light made of
air without brightness, a golden, diffuse light such as that
of Giorgione.
Now, says Leonardo, "light ends upon the pavement of
the street and rebounds with reflected motion at the
shadowy parts of the faces, brightening them considerably.
And the length of the aforementioned light of the sky
created by the boundaries of the roofs hanging over the
street illuminates almost as far as the beginning of the
shadows which are underneath the projections of the face,
and so it is gradually changed into brightness, until it ends
over the chin with imperceptible shadows all over."
It is a widely accepted opinion that Leonardo was in¬
sensitive to colour and that for him the "glory of painting"
lay only in the effect of relief that it can produce. The
chronology of his notes on painting shows that this may
apply to the first period of his theoretical work, when his art
was still bound to the teaching of the Florentine school of
the Quattrocento.
But after 1500 his observations on colour gradually
intensify to a point where his theories have no application
in any of his works which have come down to us. It is
enough to mention the effects of violet light at sunset,
a light that he designates as being of the colour of the lily
and that makes the landscape "most cheerful and pleasant."
"The beauty of colour," concludes Leonardo, "is to be
found in the main lights." Light is taken as a symbol of
virtue, and the "truth of colours" is the beauty that light
reveals in them.
What is most interesting in this d^ase as in many others
is what the British would refer to as the "unpredictable
Leonardo", the Leonardo who cannot be anticipated, because
the notes he writes are nothing but the record of the move¬
ments of his mind, so that his precepts to the painter do not
have the stiffness of academic teaching but the freshness
of a revelation.
But enough of comments, explanations, and interpret¬
ations! Leonardo's words come to us with the precision
of mathematics and yet they are evocative of the space
that opens up in the background of his paintings:
"What I would remind you of, concerning faces, is that
you should consider how, at varying distances, different
qualities of the shadows are lost and that only the main
spots are left, that is, the pits of the eye and the like: and
finally that the face remains dark, because the lights, which
are small compared with the medium shadows, are absorbed
by darkness. For this reason, at a distance, the qualities
and quantities of the main lights and shadows are con¬
sumed, and everything blends into a medium shadow. And
this is why trees and all objects appear darker at a distance
than if the same objects were near the eye. From this
obscurity on, the air which is between the eye and the object
causes the object to become brighter and to turn towards
blue. But it turns bluish rather in the shadows than in the
luminous parts, where one can see better the true quality
of the colours."

Whirling movements of every kind fascinated
Leonardo. He likened the eddies of whirlpools,
which he called "the cosmic breathing of the
ocean", to the "lake of blood extending
through the human body". He saw a parallel
between water and hair. "Observe the movement
of the surface of water", he wrote, "how
it resembles hair, which has two movements,
one of which comes from the weight of the hair,
the other from the curves of the curls. Thus
water has its whirling curls, some of which
follow the rush of the main current, while
others have a movement of incidence and
reflection". Leonardo's scientific drawings
of water in motion are veritable works of art.

LEONARDO'S MANUSCRIPTS
(Continued from page 7)
edition of Leonardo's unpublished
writings.
However, Count Libri could not re¬
sist the temptation of removing a num¬
ber of leaves from the Leonardo note¬
books which he studied at the Institut
de France. Libri was a sharp business¬
man and he set about selling the
manuscripts he had appropriated.
Some of the stolen manuscript pages
found their way to England, while
the small Codex on The Flight of Birds
was purchased for 4,000 lire by a cer¬
tain Count Manzoni, who later sold it
to an eminent Leonardo scholar, Theo¬
dore Sabachnikoff. Meanwhile, the di¬
rectors of the Institut de France be¬
came suspicious of Libri, the only
person who had been in a position to
consult the Paris manuscripts. Libri
denied the theft energetically, but the
evidence against him was overwhelm¬
ing, and he was sentenced (in his
absence) to ten years' imprisonment.
After this scandal, the Leonardo pages
that had illegally crossed to England
were returned to the Institut de France,
and Sabachnikoff handed over The
Flight of Birds Codex to the Biblioteca
Reale in Turin, where it still is today.
The story of the main changes of
ownership of the Leonardo notebooks
might have ended there. However, at
the beginning of 1967 came official
news of an astonishing find : two Leo¬
nardo notebooks previously consid¬
ered lost had been discovered in the
Madrid National Library.
After an initial reaction of justified
amazement, people began to ask how
these two manuscripts could have tur¬
ned up in Madrid. Scholars have come
up with the following answer. Some of
the Leonardo material owned by Pom¬
peo Leoni was sold in Spain after his
death. One of the purchasers was
probably Juan de Espina, a Madrid
collector. Between 1620 and 1630 first
the future Charles I of England (then
the Prince of Wales) and later the
Florentine Vincenzo Carducci visited
de Espina and saw his collection.
Both visitors were particularly im¬
pressed by two books "written and
drawn by the great Leonardo da Vinci."
When de Espina died in 1642, he
left his precious collection to the King
of Spain. The legacy included the two
Leonardo books, and these were then
deposited in the Palace Library, which
around 1830 became the nucleus of
Spain's recently founded National Li¬
brary. It is highly likely that the two
recently discovered notebooks are the
two manuscripts which once belonged
to de Espina.
In a nineteenth-century printed cata¬
logue of the Madrid National Library,
there is a reference to two Leonardo
"autographs". However, everyone who
followed up this reference and asked
to consult the precious manuscripts
was disappointed. Other manus¬
cripts were found at the shelf-marks
given in the catalogue, and there was
no sign of the Leonardo autographs.
At the end of the 19th century, a
Florentine bibliophile named Tammazo
de Marins tried to find the manus¬
cripts in the Madrid Library, but he
This drawing from the Codex Atlanticus
suggests that Leonardo envisaged

was unsuccessful and the Library's di¬
rectors decided to consider the two
volumes as definitely lost.
Then, in 1964, an eminent French
Leonardo scholar, André Corbeau, ex¬
pressed his conviction that the two
manuscripts were in fact in the Natio¬
nal Library and that their failure to
come to light might well be due to an
error in the printed catalogue. At this
point the Library's directors decided to
make another attempt to locate the two
notebooks.
This time the search was success¬
ful. At the beginning of 1965, Don Ra¬
mon Paz y Remolar, the director of the
manuscript section of the Library, had
the immense surprise of finding the
Leonardo volumes, not at the shelf-
marks given in the nineteenth-century
catalogue (Aa 19 and 20), but at shelf-
marks Aa 119 and 120.
The news of this important discovery
spread by word of mouth through the
world of scholarship. In 1967 the news
was officially confirmed, and today the
massive contribution to our knowledge
of Leonardo's work provided by these
new manuscripts is at last being made
available to the public in a facsimile
edition to be published this autumn
by McGraw-Hill Book Company of
Codex Madrid /and Codex Madrid II,
as they are now called.
Another event of the last few years
which can be compared without exces¬
sive exaggeration to the discovery of
a new manuscript is the restoration
of the Codex Atlanticus belonging to
the Ambrosian Library in Milan.
The man behind this great project
was Cardinal Montlni, Archbishop of
Milan, now Pope Paul VI. In 1962 he
successfully urged the directors of the
Ambrosian Library to send the precious
Codex to be restored at the Convent
of Grottaferrata near Rome. The idea
was not only to conserve the Codex
Atlanticus, but to salvage as much as
possible from the disastrous scissors-
and-paste job carried out by its compi¬
ler, Leoni, who had arbitrarily gathered
together whatever he thought related
to mechanics in the Leonardo papers
and notebooks belonging to him.
Leoni had taken large sheets of thick
white paper (the size used for atlases,
hence the title Codex Atlanticus), and
used them as a backing on which to
"stick" the original pages by Leo¬
nardo, which were considerably smal¬
ler and often covered from top to bot¬
tom with sketches and writing.. Some
of Leonardo's pages were covered
with drawing and writing on just one
side of the paper. In these cases, or
whenever Leoni considered the hand¬
ful of notes and hurried sketches on
the verso of the paper to be unimpor¬
tant, he stuck the verso directly on to
the backing page.
When, however, Leonardo had cov¬
ered both sides of the paper with nota¬
tions and drawings, Leoni made a kind
of window in the backing page so that
both recto and verso were visible. Fi¬
nally, when dealing with large-sized
Leonardo pages, Leoni adopted yet
another system : he folded the page
in two, introduced a window in the
backing page on which he mounted
one of the two halves, and left the
other half of the Leonardo page hang¬
ing folded just as it was.
Leoni's barbaric treatment of the
manuscripts had unfortunate results.
A large number of verso sides on
which Leonardo had recorded his
thoughts are lost. The margins of the
pages which have been pasted on to
"windows" are also lost, and these
often contained parts of a drawing
or the continuation of writing. Third¬
ly, in the case of the large pages
folded in two, the part left hanging
has often been torn off and conse¬
quently has disappeared.
The restoration carried out during
ten years of devoted work at Grotta¬
ferrata has entirely altered the appear¬
ance of the Codex Atlanticus. In many
ways it is now a completely new docu- .
ment. The restorers used the most
advanced techniques. For example, the
Leonardo originals were scrupulously
washed and toughened with sophis¬
ticated modern fibres and chemicals
in order to make them more resistant
to the ravages of time.
Today, as a result of this great
enterprise, the Codex Atlanticus con¬
sists of 1,068 pages, divided into
twelve leather-bound volumes.
There was no question of letting the
newly-restored Codex be used for con¬
sultation, and so a facsimile edition of
it is being produced by the Florence
publishing house of Barbera. The
first volumes, the end-product of re¬
fined technology and painstaking colla¬
tion with the original, have already
been published, and the Commissione
Nazionale Vinciana is at present pre¬
paring more transcriptions of the Co¬
dex, which will thus soon be available
to Leonardo scholars in its entirety.
Thus modern scholars and restorers
have done much to repair the havoc
wreaked on Leonardo's manuscripts
and we can now appreciate more fully
the activity of one of the most power¬
ful and universal minds the world has
ever known. Paolo Galluzzl

This is a page from
Leonardo's rediscovered
manuscript Codex
Madrid II. It shows
new designs for
windmills which
Leonardo worked out.
Some of them (bottom
row) had sails
designed to rotate
horizontally. In the
margin Leonardo
scribbled this note:
" Check tomorrow-
morning whether the
spruce trees at Porta
della Giustizia [in
Florence] are good for
making such a mill."
