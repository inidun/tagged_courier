Mother and child
This wooden statuette (68
cm high) of a mother and
her child is the work of a
sculptor of Mali's Dogon
people. The Dogon, who
number some 250,000, live
on and around the rugged
Bandiagara cliffs south of
Timbuktu. Most of their
sculpture is inspired by
their complex religious
system, a major feature of
which is the ancestor-cult.

In this issue the Editors of the Unesco Courier have set out to give readers a
preview, in the form of specially chosen excerpts, of a major work of
international collaboration in scholarship, the Unesco-sponsored General
History ofAfrica (see page 5). Although it incorporates some material from a
later volume, this selection is based largely on texts from vol. I, entitled
"Methodology and African Prehistory", and vol. II, "Ancient Civilizations of
Africa", the French and English editions of which are now in the final stages
of preparation. For reasons of space alone our anthology can only reflect a
handful of the many themes evoked in the early parts of the eight-volume
General History. As work proceeds in this long-term enterprise, the Unesco
Courier will be furnished with opportunities to focus on other important
aspects of early African history. In particular, it has been necessary to
postpone until a future issue publication of a study on the extraordinary
expansion of Islam in Africa, since volume III ("Africa from the Seventh to the
Eleventh Century"), of which this will be a major theme, is still in course of
preparation. The General History ofAfrica will be published first in English,
French and Arabic; later, translated versions are scheduled to appear in such
African languages as Kiswahili, Hawsa, Fulani, Yoruba and Lingala. Also
foreseen are translations into other languages such as German, Russian,
Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish, and the production of abridged versions
aimed at a vast international public. In cover photo, taken from a space
satellite, the outlines emerge of a continent the whole span of whose history
. is now for the first time being "viewed from within". Cover photo © nasa

The General History
of Africa
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
THE face of Africa has long been concealed from
the world by myths and prejudices of all kinds.
African societies were regarded as societies
without a history; in spite of major studies produced in
the early decades of this century by such pioneers as Leo
Frobenius, Maurice Delafosse and Arturo Labrlola, many
non-African scholars, wedded to preconceptions rooted in
their own background, maintained that such societies
could not be studied scientifically because sources and
written documents were lacking. This amounted to a
refusal to see Africans as the creators of original cultures
which blossomed and perpetuated themselves for
centuries in distinctive ways of their own which historians
can only grasp by adopting new methods.
Furthermore, the African continent was virtually never
considered as a historical entity. On the contrary, stress
was laid on everything which might give credence to the
idea of a division, since time immemorial, between a
"white Africa" and a "black Africa", each ignorant of the
other. The Sahara was often presented as an impenetrable
expanse which completely prevented any mixing of ethnic
groups and peoples, any exchange of goods, beliefs,
customs and ideas between the societies established on
each side of the desert. Impassable frontiers were traced
between the civilizations of ancient Egypt, of Nubia, and
those of the peoples living south of the Sahara.
Today it is generally recognized that the civilizations of
the African -continent, through the variety of their
languages and cultures, form, to varying degrees, the
historical contours of an ensemble of peoples and
societies united by links stretching back for centuries.
Another phenomenon which has had a deleterious
effect on the objective study of the African past is the
existence of racial stereotypes, which appeared with the
slave trade and colonization, bred contempt and
incomprehension, and became so deeply rooted that they
actually perverted the conceptual basis of historiography.
From the moment when the notions of "whites" and
"blacks" were adopted to serve as generic descriptions of
the masters and the dominated peoples respectively,
Africans had to struggle against a dual enslavement,
economic and psychological.
Identifiable by the pigmentation of his skin, earmarked
for labour in mines and plantations, one commodity
among others, the African came to symbolize in the minds
of his oppressors an imaginary racial abstraction, falsely
infused with the notion of inferiority, which was
categorized as negro. This spurious process of
identification reduced the history of the African peoples to
the status of an ethno-history in which any appreciation of
their cultures was bound to be distorted. As for the image
of themselves which the colonizers gave to the Africans,
need it be said that all too often, alas, this was no more
than a caricature of the civilizations whose values they
were supposed, to embody?
The situation has changed radically, especially since the
African countries have achieved independence and now
actively participate in the life of the international
community and the mutual exchanges which it exists to
promote. In exercising their right to take the initiative
where their own history is concerned, the Africans
themselves are profoundly aware of the need to re¬
establish on firm foundations the historical nature of their
societies.
Herein lies the importance of the eight-volume General
History ofAfrica, upon whose publication Unesco is now
embarking.
The specialists from many countries who have
participated in this work decided to begin by defining Its
theoretical and methodological basis. They have
scrupulously re-examined the unjustified simplifications
originating from a restrictive, linear conception of history,
and, whenever necessary and possible, have revised
accepted positions so as to present the facts in their true
light. They have made every effort to bring into focus the
historical data through which it is possible to comprehend
the development of the different African peoples in their
specific social and cultural contexts.
Work on this immense task, made even more complex
and arduous by the diversity of sources and the dispersion
of documents, was undertaken by Unesco in three stages.
The first (1965-1969) consisted of work on documentation
and planning: the collection of oral and unpublished
written sources in the field; the preparation of a Guide to
the Sources of the History ofAfrica based on an inventory
of the archives of European countries; meetings of experts
to discuss questions of methodology and to trace the
broad outlines of the project. During the second stage
(1969-1971) international meetings of experts held in Paris
(1969) and Addis Abeba (1970) confirmed the
interdisciplinary character of the method chosen. The third
phase is that of the drafting and publication of the work,
under the intellectual responsibility of a 39-member
International Scientific Committee, two-thirds of whose
members are Africans.
The General History ofAfrica throws a new and original
light on the continent's past, considered as a totality,
because its authors have avoided the pitfalls of
dogmatism in tackling such fundamental questions as the
slave trade, which was responsible for one of the cruellest
deportations in the history of mankind and emptied the
continent of part of its lifeblood; colonization and all its
consequences; the relations between Africa south of the
Sahara and the Arab world; the process of decolonization
and the accession to independence of the new African
States. The General History brings into focus both Africa's
historical unity and it's relations with the other continents,
notably with the Americas and the Caribbean islands,
where the African heritage has left its imprint on ways of
feeling, thinking, imagining and acting, and where the
descendants of Africans have actively contributed to the
fashioning of national identities.
I am convinced that the whole sense and thrust of the
future draws its force from an intensely felt consciousness
of history, faithfully transmitted from generation to
generation through education. In Africa, as elsewhere, this
consciousness is one of the essential conditions of the
independence, development and affirmation of peoples.
Unesco is thus serving the entire international community
by helping to make known and by restoring to its proper
perspective Africa's contribution to human progress.

With its shifting sand dunes (above) and rocky wastes, the Sahara, the world's largest desert,
forms a climatic hiatus between the Mediterranean and the tropical worlds. Inhabited by
nomads and traversed by caravan routes, it acted not as an absolute barrier but as a filter
limiting the southward penetration of Mediterranean influences. The great rivers of Africa too,
although important as communication routes over their navigable stretches, played a role in
the compartmentalization of the continent. The cataracts of the Nile, the falls and rapids of the
Zambezi, the Senegal, the Orange and the Limpopo, particularly in their lower reaches, formed
virtually impassable barriers. At the Victoria Falls (right), one of the scenic wonders of the
world, the Zambezi plunges 100 metres over a sheer precipice 1,700 metres wide, sending into
the air a wall of spray that at times is visible up to 40 miles away.

Africa and its history
A continent
viewed from within
by Joseph Ki-Zerbo
AFRICA has a history. The time has
long gone by when maps had great
empty spaces representing the
African continent as marginal and subor¬
dinate, and the knowledge of scholars on
the subject was summed up in the cryptic
phrase : Ibl sunt leones here be lions.
But then came the discovery of the
mines and their profits, and incidentally of
the "native tribes" which owned the
mines, but which like them were annexed
as the property of the colonizing countries.
The history of Africa, like the history of
mankind as a whole, is really the story of an
awakening. The history of Africa needs
rewriting, for up till now it has often been
masked, faked, distorted, mutilated, by
"force of circumstance" I.e. through ig¬
norance or self-interest. Crushed by cen¬
turies of oppression, Africa has seen
generations of travellers, slave-traders, ex¬
plorers, missionaries, governors, and
scholars of all kinds give out its ¡mage as
one of nothing but poverty, barbarism, ir¬
responsibility and chaos. And this image
has been projected and extrapolated in¬
definitely in time, as a justification of both
the present and the future.
For Africans, the history of Africa is not
a narcissistic mirror nor a subtle excuse for
avoiding the tasks and burdens of today. If
it were an alienating device of that kind, the
scientific objects of the whole enterprise
would be compromised. But is not ig¬
norance of one's own past, in other words
of a large part of oneself, even more
alienating?
All the evils that afflict Africa today, as
well as all the possibilities for the future,
are the result of countless forces transmit¬
ted by history. And just as the first step in a
rational diagnosis and therapy is the
reconstruction of the evolution of the v
disease, in the same way the first task in r
JOSEPH KI-ZERBO, of Upper Volta, is pro¬
fessor of African history at the University of
Ouagadougou and Secretary-General of the
African and Malagasy Council for Higher
Studies. A recently appointed member of the
Executive Board of Unesco, he also serves on
the Governing Board of Unesco's International
Institute for Educational Planning. He is the
author of many articles and books on Africa in¬
cluding Le Monde Africain (The African World)
and Histoire de l'Afrique Noire (The History of
Black Africa). He is editor of Volume I
(Methodology and African Prehistory) of The
General History of Africa, now in preparation
under the auspices of Unesco.

AFRICA AND ITS HISTORY
,any overall analysis of the African conti¬
nent must be a historical one. Unless one
chooses to live in a state of un¬
consciousness and alienation, one cannot
live without memory, or with a memory
that belongs to someone else. And history
is the memory of nations.
And thus we come to the formidable
question of methodology.
In this connexion, as in others, we have
to steer a middle course between treating
Africa as too exceptional a case on the one
hand, and on the other, dealing with it too
much in terms proper to other parts of the
world. Some people say that before we can
talk of a real history of Africa we should
wait to find the same kinds of evidence as
in Europe, the same array of written or
epigraphic documents. In short, for them,
the problems of the historian are the same
everywhere, in the tropics as at the poles.
In fact, the difficulties specific to the
history of Africa can already be seen when
one looks at the facts of the physical
geography of the continent. Africa, a lone¬
ly continent if ever there was one, seems to
turn its back on the rest of the Old World,
to which it is joined only by the fragile um¬
bilical cord of the isthmus of Suez.
It is to the south, amid the austral
waters, that Africa thrusts her solid mass,
bound in by coastal ranges through which
rivers force their way by means of heroic
defiles, in themselves great obstacles to
penetration. The only sizeable passage bet¬
ween the Sahara and the Abyssinian
mountains is blocked by the vast marshes
of Bahr el Ghazal.
Strong winds and sea currents guard the
coast from Cape Blanc to Cape Verde,
while in the middle of the continent three
deserts add internal barriers to isolation
from without: in the south, the Kalahari; in
the centre, the "green desert" of the
equatorial forest with all its dangers which
man had to overcome before he could
make it his refuge; and in the north, the
Sahara, desert of deserts, a huge continen¬
tal filter, a wild sea of shifting sand dunes
and rocky wastes which joins with the
mountain fringe of the Atlas to separate the
fortunes of the Mediterranean part of
Africa from that of the rest of the conti¬
nent. These ecological forces have weigh¬
ed heavily on every aspect of Africa's
destiny.
They have also enhanced the value of all
the natural loopholes which were from the
start to act as corridors in the exploration
of Africa, begun thousands of millennia
ago. One example is the great meridian
groove of the Rift Valley, stretching from
the very centre of Africa and across the
Ethiopian ridge as far as Iraq. The curve of
the valleys of the Sangha, Ubangi and Zaire
must have acted as a corridor in an east-
west direction. It is not by chance that the
first kingdoms of black Africa developed in
these more accessible regions, these
Sahels at once permeable from within, to a
certain extent open towards the exterior.
and in contact with neighbouring regions
of Africa with different and complementary
resources.
These open areas, with their com¬
paratively rapid evolution, afford, a con¬
trario, the proof that isolation was one of
the key factors in Africa's slowness in pur¬
suit of certain kinds of progress. The very
vastness of the African continent, with a
diluted and therefore readily itinerant
population living in a nature generous with
its fruits and minerals, but cruel with its
endemic and epidemic diseases, prevented
it from reaching the threshold of
demographic concentration which has
almost always been one of the precondi¬
tions of major qualitative changes in the
social, political and economic spheres.
Moreover, the slave trade, a severe
demographic drain from time immemorial
and especially from the fifteenth to the
twentieth century after the traffic was
organized on a large scale, can only have
helped to deprive Africa of the stability and
human dynamism necessary for all out¬
standing creativeness, even on the
technological plane.
Neither nature nor man, geography nor
history, have been kind to Africa. And it is
indispensable that we should go back to
these fundamental conditions of the evolu¬
tionary process in order to pose the pro¬
blems in objective terms, and not in the
form of such myths as racial inferiority,
congenital tribalism and the so-called
historical passivity of the Africans. The
best these subjective and irrational ap¬
proaches can do is conceal a deliberate ig¬
norance. As for the worst, the less said the
better.
It must be admitted that as far as Africa
is concerned the question of sources is a
difficult one. There are three main sources
for our historical knowledge of Africa: writ¬
ten documents, archaeology and oral tradi¬
tion. These are backed up by linguistics
and anthropology, which enable us to
elaborate and refine on the interpretation of
data which may otherwise be crude and
unyielding.
Written sources, if not very rare, are at
least unevenly distributed in time and
spaced The most obscure centuries in
African history are "those which lack the
clear and precise illumination that comes
from written accounts, for example, the
centuries preceding and following the birth
of Christ (here North Africa is an
exception). But even when such evidence
exists, its interpretation is strewn with dif¬
ficulties and ambiguities.
On the quantitative plane, large masses
of written material, archival or narrative,
have still not yet been exploited, as is
shown by the incomplete inventories of
unpublished manuscripts concerning the
history of black Africa which are being
found not only in libraries in Morocco,
Algeria and Europe, but also in the libraries
of Sudanese scholars and leading citizens
in towns throughout the Bend of the Niger,
and whose titles suggest some promising
new veins. Unesco has established the
Ahmed Baba Centre at Timbuktu to pro¬
mote the collection of such material. The
archives of Iran, Iraq, Armenia, India and
China, not to mention the Americas, must
hold many scraps of African history
awaiting some perspicacious and im¬
aginative researcher.
The silent witnesses revealed by ar¬
chaeology are often more eloquent than
the official chroniclers. The marvellous
discoveries of archaeology have already
served African history well. These include
articles made of iron, together with the
technology involved; ceramics, with their
production techniques and styles; objects
made of glass; writings, and different .
graphic styles; the techniques of naviga¬
tion, fishing and weaving; foodstuffs; and
geomorphological, hydraulic and eco¬
logical structures linked to the evolution of
climate.
The language of archaeological excava¬
tion has by nature something objective and
irrefutable about it. Thus a study of the
typology of the pottery and objects of bone
and metal found in the Nigero-Chadian
Sahara demonstrates the link between the
pre-lslamic peoples (Sao) of the Chad
Basin and cultural areas extending as far as
the Nile and the Libyan desert. The living
ties of the past are revived, beyond the
modern landscape with its crushing
loneliness and apathy, by the kinship
shown in statuettes of baked clay wearing
cross-belts, in the designs of the bodies of
figurines, in the shapes of jars and
bracelets, harpoons and bones, in ar¬
rowheads or tips, and in throwing knives.
Besides the first two sources of African
historywritten documents and ar¬
chaeology tradition takes its place as
a real living museum, conserver and
transmitter of the social and cultural crea¬
tions stored up by peoples said to have no
written records. This spoken history is a
very frail thread by which to trace our way
back through the dark twists of the
labyrinth of time. Those who are its custo¬
dians are old men.
Whenever one of them dies a fibre of
Ariadne's thread is broken, a fragment of
the landscape literally disappears
underground. Yet oral tradition is by far the
most intimate of historical sources, the
most rich, the one which is fullest of the
sap of authenticity. Tradition clothes
things in flesh and blood and colour, it
gives blood to the skeleton of the past.
Of course, in epic the weakness of the
chronological sequence is the Achilles'
heel: mixed-up temporal sequences cause
the image of the past to reach us not clear
and stable as in a mirror, but like à fleeting,
broken-up reflection on the surface of a
ruffled stream. The average length of
reigns and generations is a highly con¬
troversial question, and extrapolations bas¬
ed on recent periods have to be accepted
with very great reserve, because of
demographic and political changes, to
name only two factors. Sometimes an ex¬
ceptional and magnetic dynast polarizes
the exploits of his predecessors and suc¬
cessors around his own person, and thek
others are literally eclipsed. Y

The written word
à
Towards the end of the 4th millenium BC, the Egyptians invented a system of hieroglyphic writing
that employs characters in the form of pictures. The signs could be read as pictures or as symbols for
oictures, but they quickly acquired a phonetic value regardless of their original pictorial meaning.
Many ideograms (pictorial representations) were however retained and a complicated system had
to be devised to prevent misreadings. Above, an Egyptian hieroglyphic taxt dating from the time of
Darius the Great (550-486 BC) which reads: "The Pasha, the Count, the Royal Chancellor, the sole
companion, 'he who lives among them', the prophet, the great doctor Udjahorresne, son of Atermitis,
jdeclares: His majesty the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Darius, may he live for ever, ordered me to
return to Egypt whilst his majesty remainad in Elam; at that time he was the Great King of all the
other countries and Sovereign of Egypt."
Early examples of Egyptian hieroglyphics show the beginnings of the
transition from the pictorial representation of an event to symbolic use of
signs. The famous "Palette of Narmer" (above) depicts king Narmer
(about 3100 BC), the first monarch of the first dynasty triumphing over his
enemies. The falcon (see detail above right) symbolizes the god Horus, the
patron divinity of the royal house of Upper Egypt, who is seen ho/ding a rope
that binds a captive; beside him are six papyrus stems, the hieroglyphic sign
for the figure 1,000. The meaning of the pictograph is thus that the king of
Upper Egypt triumphed over his enemies and took 6,000 prisoners.
The origin of the Nsibidi writing of the Ekoi people of southern
Nigeria is not known. It consists of highly conventionalized
pictographs and is used chiefly by a secret society and for magical
purposes. Each sign represents a particular concept or association
of ideas. Above, a Nsibidi writer portrays the joys and problems of
four married couples. From left to right, This husband and wife
love each other dearly and embrace each other with joy (out¬
stretched arms). The yare rich for they have three cushions and a
table on either side of them. The second couple have quarrelled;
they have turned their backs on each other and are separated by a
cushion. The third couple belong to the Egbo tribe whose emblem
is a feather. The fourth couple are separated by a river (note the
canoes tied up at each bank). The crosses show, however, that
they have been able to exchange messages.

The Meroitic language was spoken in the ancient
Kingdom of Meroe (see article page 55) from about
200 BC to the 4th century AD. Surviving only in
inscriptions, Meroitic was written from right to left
in an alphabet derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics
and in a cursive form. Although a few Meroitic
, words and some elements of the grammar are known,
it remains largely undeciphered. Attempts are now
being made to unravel the mystery of the Meroitic
language with the aid of a computer.
Extinct as a spoken language, Ge'ez is a Semitic
language of the same group as Amharic, the official
language of Ethiopia. Unlike other Semitic langua¬
ges it is written from left to right. Although Ge'ez
ceased to be spoken sometime between 900 and
1 200 AD, it continues as a literary and liturgical
language. Above, 1 6th century portrait on wood of

Bamun writing (above left) was invented in 1895 by Sultan Njoya of Foumban (Cameroon). The first syllabary consisted
of over 1 ,000 signs, but successive simplifications have reduced it to 70 signs. Above right, the sound "ka" as represented

^ Furthermore, an oral account taken out
of its context is like a fish out of water: it
dies. Taken in isolation, oral tradition
resembles African masks wrested from the
communion of the faithful and exhibited to
the curiosity of the uninitiated. It loses its
significance and life. Yet it is through that
life, because it is always being taken over
by fresh witnesses charged with transmit¬
ting it, that oral tradition adapts itself to the
expectations of new audiences; and this
adaptation relates mainly to the presenta¬
tion, though it does not always leave the
content intact.
Even the content of the message is often
hermetic or esoteric. For the African,
speech is a weighty matteran ambiguous
force which can make and unmake, which
can be the bearer of evil. That is why the
message is not articulated openly and
directly, but wrapped up in fable, allusion,
hint, proverbs that are hard to understand
for the ordinary man but clear for those
who possess the antennae of wisdom.
The hermeticism of this half-speech
shows at once the inestimable value of oral
tradition, and its limits: it is almost impossi¬
ble to transfer all its richness from one
language to another, especially when that
other is structurally and sociologically very
remote. Tradition does not stand up well to
translation. When uprooted it loses its
vigour and authenticity, for language is
"the home of being". And many errors
ascribed to tradition itself are due to in¬
competent or unscrupulous interpreters.

Wooden mask (above) of the Ivory Coast's Baulé people
represents a male divinity. The disc-shaped headdress and
ornamental scarifications on forehead and temples represent rays
of light projected by the gods, while the zigzag line around the
face evokes rain, the source of life. The plaited beard is both a
symbol of the life-force and an emblem of power. The beard
resembles that on the golden mask which covered the
mummified face of the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamen (above right).
There is also a resonance between the striations of the Baulé
headdress and the flowing bands of Tutankhamen's headgear,
with Its royal insignia of vulture and uraeus (the sacred asp),
symbols of life and death. Perhaps such points of resemblance
explain why the faces have an identical expression of absolute
sovereignty (see also central colour pages and photo p. 26).

being a handicap, is on the contrary only a
further guarantee for critical history. When
accounts agree, as in the case of the Bam-
bara and Fula griots, who belonged to op¬
posing camps, the authenticity of the
evidence is reinforced.
This rigid, formal and institutionalized
oral tradition usually has its structure rein¬
forced and supported by court music,
which unites with it and measures it out in
didactic and artistic sections. Some of the
instruments used are so old that they
would repay an archaeological Investiga¬
tion in themselves. These instruments, the
vehicles of spoken history, are sacred, the
object of veneration. In effect they are part
of the artist, and their importance in com¬
municating the message is all the greater
because music is directly intelligible; the in¬
strument becomes the artist's voice, and
he does not need to utter a word.
In linguistics African history has not an
auxiliary science but an independent
discipline which nevertheless leads history
right to the heart of its own subject. True,
much still remains to be done in this com¬
plex fieldand what needs doing first
is to define scientifically the languages
concerned.
The descriptive approach must not be
sacrificed to a comparative and synthetic
one which aims at being typological and
genetic. It is only through minute and
laborious analysis of the facts of language,
in the living experience of the speakers of a
given community, that one can extrapolate
backwards, an operation often made dif¬
ficult by a lack of historical depth in
people's knowledge of the languages con¬
cerned.
Linguistic studies show that the routes
and paths of migration, and the diffusion of
both material and spiritual culture, are
marked out by the diffusion of related
words. Hence the importance of diachronic
linguistic analysis and glotto-chronology to
the historian who wishes to understand
the meaning and dynamics of Africa's
evolution.
At any rate, linguistics, which has
already done African history good service,
should discard from the outset the
disparaging ethnocentric attitude which
characterized the African linguistics accor¬
ding to which the languages of the Indo-
European family are at the summit of evolu¬
tion, and the languages of the blacks are at
the very bottom of the ladder, though it us¬
ed to be thought that they were interesting
in that they revealed a state near to the
original state of language, when languages
were supposed to be without grammar,
speech just a series of monosyllables, and
vocabulary restricted to an elementary
inventory.
The same remark applies a fortiori to an¬
thropology and ethnology. Ethnological
discourse has by the force of circumstance
been a discourse with explicitly
discriminatory premises, and conclusions
implicitly political, with, between the two,
a "scientific" exercise which was
necessarily ambiguous. Its main presup¬
position was often linear evolution, with
Europe, pioneer of civilization, in the van of
human advance, and at the rear the
primitive "tribes" of Oceania, Amazonia
and Africa. It asked the question: what on
earth was it like to be an Indian, a black, a
Papuan, an Arab?
Other people, whether backward, bar¬
barous, savage to a greater or lesser
degree, are always different, and for this
reason objects of interest to the scientist or
of greed to the trader. The ethnologist was
thus delegated to be the "Minister of Euro¬
pean Curiosity" vis-à-vis "the natives".
The ethnological outlook, strong on
nakedness, misery and folklore, was often
sadistic, lubricious and at best pater¬
nalistic. Ethnological essays and reports
usually sought to justify the status quo and
contributed to the "development of
underdevelopment".
Thus the whole of Africa was presented
in ¡mages which Africans themselves might
regard as strangejust as if, at the beginn¬
ing of this century, Europe was personified
by the housing conditions, table manners
or technical level of certain rural com¬
munities.
Lastly, by an implacable dialectic, the
very object or "other" of ethnology
gradually disappeared under the influence
of colonialism. The primitive natives who
lived by hunting and gathering, if not by
cannibalism, were transformed into sub-
proletariats of peripheral centres in a world
system of production which has its pole of
attraction in the northern hemisphere. That
is why those who had been cast in the role
of objects, in this case the Africans, decid¬
ed to initiate an independent mode of
discourse of their own, as subjects of
history.
All that is necessary is to admit that while

Africa's dialogue
MAN is an historical animal, and
African man is no exception.
Just as everywhere else all over
the world, he created his own history and
his own idea of it. Yet at first glance, and
even after reading many ethnological
studies, one gets the impression that the
Africans were submerged, almost drown¬
ed, in mythical time, a vast ocean without
shores and without landmarks, while the
other peoples of the world advanced down
the avenue of History, a great highway
marked out with the milestones of pro¬
gress.
And it is true that myth, the imaginary
representation of the past, does often
dominate African conceptions of the
development of the lives of nations. So
much so, that the choice and significance
of real events sometimes had to obey a
mythical model predetermining even the
most prosaic actions of ruler or people.
Myth, in the guise of immemorial customs,
thus governed, as it also justified, history.
From this context emerge two striking
characteristics of African historical
thought: its timelessness and its essentially
social aspect.
In this situation, time is not duration as it
affects the fate of the individual. It is the
rhythm of the collective breathing of the
social group. It is not a river flowing in one
direction from a known source to a known
outlet. Traditional African time includes
and incorporates eternity in both direc¬
tions. Bygone generations are not lost to
the present. In their own way they remain
contemporary, and as influential as they
were during their lifetime, if not more so.
In these circumstances causality
operates in a forward direction, of course,
from past to present and from present to
future, not only through the influence of
bygone facts and events, but through a
direct intervention which can operate in
any direction. When Kanku Musa, emperor
of Mali (early 14th century), sent an am¬
bassador to the king of Yatenga asking him
to be converted to Islam, the Mossi ruler
answered that he would have to consult his
ancestors before taking such a decision.
This shows the past in direct connexion
with the present through religion,
ancestors acting as special and direct
agents in matters occurring centuries after
their death. Similarly, at many royal courts
officials responsible for the interpretation
M. BOUBOU HAMA, of Niger, specializes in
research on the kingdoms of the Niger Valley, on
which he has published several works, drawing
his inspiration largely from the oral tradition. A
former president of the National Assembly of
Niger, he is the initiator of a drive for the collec¬
tion and preservation of ancient manuscripts in

but written in Arabic characters).

of dreams had considerable influence on
political action, and might almost be
described as ministers of the future.
In this kind of suspended time, the pre¬
sent may even act on what is regarded as
the past but in fact remains contemporary.
The blood of sacrifices offered up today
can help the ancestors of yesteryear. Right
up to our own times, Africans have ex¬
horted one another not to neglect offerings
made in the name of their ancestors, for
those who receive nothing are the poor in
the parallel world of the dead, and have to
live on the charity of those in whose name
generous sacrifices are made.
In a more fundamental way still, some
cosmogonies attribute to some mythical
time advances which were made in
historical time; as the latter is not perceived
as such by each individual, it is replaced by
the historical group memory. An example
of this is the Gikuyu legend about the first
making of iron. Mogai (God) had divided
up the animals between men and women.
But the women were so cruel that their
animals ran away and became wild. The
men interceded with Mogai on behalf of
their wives, saying, "We wish to sacrifice a
lamb in thy honour, but we do not want to
do it with a wooden knife lest we run the
same risk as our wives." Mogai con¬
gratulated them on their wisdom and, so
that they could have more efficient
weapons, told them how to smelt iron.
This mythical and collective conception
of time made it an attribute of sovereignty.
King Shilluk was the mortal repository of
immortal power, for he combined in his
own person both mythical time (he was the
incarnation of the founding hero) and
social time, regarded as the source of the
group's vitality.
Indeed, one has to go as far as the
general conception of the world in order to
understand the Africans' vision of time and
its real meaning for them. We then see that
in traditional thought, time in the ordinary
sense is only one aspect of another time ex
perienced by other dimensions of the in¬
dividual. When a man lies down at night on
his mat or his bed, to sleep, that is the mo-
' ment his double chooses to set out and
retrace the path the man himself followed
during the day, to frequent the places he
was in, and to repeat the work and actions
he performed consciously during his daily
life. It is in the course of these peregrina¬
tions that the double encounters the forces
of good and evil, both benevolent spirits
and the sorcerers who eat up doubles or
cerkos as they are called in the Songhay
and Zarma languages.
It is in his double that a man's personality
resides. When the Songhays say óf
someone that his bya (double) is heavy or
light, they mean that his personality is
strong or weak, and the purpose of
amulets is to protect and strengthen the
double. The ¡deal is to succeed in merging
into one's double so as to form a single en¬
tity, which thus acquires superhuman
wisdom and strength. Only the greatest in¬
itiate or master (korté-konynii, zimaa) can
attain this state, in which time, like space,
ceases to be an obstacle.
Social time. History, experienced in this
way by a group, amasses power, and this
power is usually symbolized and given con¬
crete form by some object which is
transmitted by the patriarch, the chief of
the tribe, or the king, to his successor. It
may be a golden ball kept in a tobal or war-
drum, together with parts of the body of a
lion or elephant or panther. Or it may be
kept in a box or chest, like the regalia (tibo)
of the Mossi king. Among the Songhay
and Zarma, the object is a rod of iron
pointed at one end. Among the Sorko in
the old empire of Gao it was an idol in the
shape of a big fish with a ring in its mouth.
Among those who worked in iron it was a
mythical forge which sometimes grew red-
hot at night to express its anger.
The transfer of such objects constituted
the legal transmission of power. The mosu
striking example is that of the Sonianké,*
The cosmology of many African peoples includes a god of creation, invoked through
secondary deities or mythical ancestors which mediate between man and the invisible
world. Ancestor figures are depicted in African statuary in poses which correspond to
their role or refer to an event in popular mythology. This wooden statuette (13 cm high) of
the Dogon people (Mali) probably represents Dyongu Seru, a mythical ancestor, hiding his
face after violating a series of taboos. The statuette is a reminder of the forbidden acts
committed by Ogo, the first living creature created by Amma (God). Opposite page,

of Sonni Ali, who have chains
of gold, silver or copper, each link
representing an ancestor and the whole
chain representing the dynastic line back to
Sonni the Great. The chains are produced
from the mouths of the celebrants in the
course of magical ceremonies, much to the
amazement of the onlookers, and when a
Sonianké patriarch dies, he disgorges the
chain for the last time, and it is swallowed
from the other end by his chosen suc¬
cessor. He dies as soon as he has passed
the chain over to whoever is to continue
the line a concrete will and testament
which well illustrates the strength of the
African conception of mythical and social
time.
Some people have thought that such a
view of the historical process was static
and sterile, placing the perfect archetype
far back in the past, in the origins of time,
and thus seeming to set before succeeding
generations an ideal which consisted in
stereotyped repetition of the doings and
exploits of their ancestors.. Myth would
then be the motive force of a history which
was immobile. But as we shall see, African
historical thought cannot be confined to
this one approach.
It must also be recognized that a
mythical approach lies at the origins of
every nation's history. Every history starts
off as religious history. But can African
time be regarded as a historical time?
Some people have said it cannot, arguing
that the African only sees the world as a
stereotyped reproduction of what has gone
before. This would make him a stubborn
disciple of the past, justifying all his actions
by saying "That was how our ancestors did
it".
The social nature of the African concep¬
tion of history itself lends it a historical
dimension, for history is the developing life
of a group. From this point of view, we
may say that, for the African, time is
dynamic. Man is not a prisoner marking
time, or condemned to do the same things
over and over again, either in the traditional
view or according to the belief of Islam.
Of course, in the absence of the idea of a
mathematical and physical time made up of
homogeneous units added together and
measured by special instruments, time re¬
mains something pragmatic and social. But
that does not mean, in this context,
something neutral and indifferent. In the
black African overall conception of the
world, time is the area where man can
always carry on the struggle against the
depletion and for the increase of his vital
energy. That is the main feature of African
animism, in which time is an enclosed
space, a market where the forces that in¬
habit the world contend or conclude
bargains. The ideal of both the individual
and the group is to defend themselves
against any diminution, to improve their
health and strength and the size of their
fields and flocks, to increase the number of
their children and wives and villages. And
this conception is undoubtedly a dynamic
one.
Power in Black Africa is often expressed
by a word that means force or strength.
But it is not just a matter of crude material
force. It is a question of the vital energy
which contains various polyvalent forces
ranging from physical integrity through
chance to moral integrity. Ethical value is
regarded as a sine qua non of the benefi¬
cent exercise of power. Popular wisdom
bears witness to this idea in many tales
which depict despotic chiefs who are finally
punished, thus literally drawing the moral
of history.
This vision of the world in which ethical
values and requirements form an integral
part of the ordering of the universe itself
may appear mythical. But it exerted an ob¬
jective influence on people's behaviour,
especially on that of many African political
leaders. In this sense one may say that
while history is often a justification of the
past it is also an exhortation for the future.
In pre-state systems moral authority
capable of guaranteeing the conduct of
public affairs or of chastising those who
conducted them was vested in special,
sometimes secret groups, such as the lo of
the Senufo or the poro of Upper Guinea.
These groups often constituted parallel
powers which could be appealed to outside
the established system. They sometimes
ended by clandestinely usurping official
power. The people then saw them as oc¬
cult centres of decision depriving the na¬
tion of control over its own history.
In the same type of society, the organiza¬
tion into age-groups is of prime importance
for establishing the people's history. This
structure, in so far as it conforms to a-
known periodicity, makes it possible to
trace history back to the eighteenth cen¬
tury. But at the same time it played a
specific rôle in the life of the societies
themselves. Even in rural communities
which knew no major technical innovation
and were therefore fairly stable, conflict
between the generations was not
unknown.
So it had to be controlled, and relations
between the generations so structured that
the conflict would not degenerate into
violent confrontation and sudden change.
The generation engaged in action sent one
of its members as a delegate to the next
generation, the one that would immediate¬
ly succeed it. The rôle of the delegate was
not to stifle the impatience of the younger
group, but to channel their reckless energy
so that it was not harmful to the communi¬
ty as a whole and did not impair the
younger group's ability to take over public
responsibility when the time came. The
Alladians of Moosou (near Abidjan), for
example, are still organized into five gene¬
rations, each reigning for nine years, even
for modern activities such as building, cele¬
brating a diploma or promotion.
Africans are vividly aware of time past,
but time past, though it greatly influences
time present, does not do away with its
dynamism, as is attested by many pro¬
verbs. The conception of time as one sees
it in African societies is certainly not inhe¬
rent in or consubstantial with some essen¬
tially African nature. It is the mark of a cer¬
tain stage in economic and social develop¬
ment. Proof of this is the striking differen¬
ces one sees even today between the time-
is-money of African city-dwellers and time
as it is understood by their contemporaries
and brothers in the bush. The essential ele¬
ment in historical time is the idea of a deve¬
lopment starting from origins which are to
be sought and examined.
Even beneath the crust of tales and
legends and the dross of myths, there is an
attempt to rationalize social development.
Sometimes even more positive efforts have
been made to try to calculate historical
time. This may be linked with space, as
when a period of short duration is referred
to as a step. It can also be linked to biology,
in references to a breath, in or out. But it is
often linked to factors not connected with
the individual, and the references then are
to cosmic, climatic or social phenomena,
especially when these are recurrent. In the
savannah of the Sudan, the followers of
traditional African religions usually count
age by rainy seasons. To indicate that a
man is old, one says how many rainy sea¬
sons he has lived through, or, more ellipti-
cally, that "he has drunk much water".
More developed systems of computation
have sometimes been attempted. It has
been shown that the Akan (Fanti,
Ashanti...) evolved a complex calendar
system, with a week of seven days, a
month of six weeks and a year of nine
months, which was regularly re-aligned on
the sun by methods that are not yet fully
understood. But the decisive step will
come only with the spread of writing,
though the existence of a literate class is no k
guarantee that the whole people will r
Time and the river
Striking aerial photo of the Niger, right, shows jutting sandbanks narrowing the river's
course. In the 16th century a great State, the Songhay empire, flourished on the middle
reaches of the Niger. It succeeded in unifying much of the western Sudan and became the
centre of a brilliant civilization. The Songhay and other peoples which constituted the
empire were traders and farmers but also included fishing peoples of the Niger, notably the
Sorko. The trading cities became Muslim but the great mass of the Songhay and the
peoples of the empire lived outside the towns and remained attached to their ancestral
beliefs, honouring magical counterparts or "doubles" known as holes and nature spirits
whose favours they sought. The Sorko, who practised animism and invoked the spirits of
the air, the soil and the river, have a rich mythology featuring such ancestral figures as the
gluttonous giant Faran-Maka, who devoured a whole hippopotamus at each meal and
swallowed ponds of water at a single gulp. The female patron of the Sorko is Haraké, a
beautiful girl with light-coloured hair who is supposed to emerge from the river's depths at
nightfall and sit on the rocks to await her lover. When he arrives she leads him beneath the
Niger waters to a fabulous world of glittering cities where her marriage is consummated to
the sound of tom-toms and stringed instruments.

^ become aware of possessing a common
history. But at least it makes it possible to
establish certain points of reference around
which that history shaped itself.
The introduction of monotheistic
religions rooted in another history has ser¬
ved to provide the mental image of the col¬
lective past with another, parallel set of
models which can often be glimpsed in the
background in various stories. For exam¬
ple, the dynasties are often linked arbitrarily
to the sources of Islam, whose values and
¡deals the black prophets were to make use
of to change the course of events in their
own countries.
But the greatest upheaval in time comes
with the introduction of the world of profit,
and the amassing of money. Then accultu¬
ration changes the sense of individual and
collective time into the mental schémas
operative in the countries which influence
Africans economically and culturally.
The Africans then see that it is money
that makes History. African man, once so
close to his history that he seemed to be
creating it himself, in microsocieties, is
then confronted both with the risk of a
colossal alienation and with the chance of
being a co-author of world progress.

Tongues that span
the centuries
POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD is symbolized by this
ceremonial carved axe of the Lele people of Zaïre. It
would be virtually impossible to overemphasize the
importance of the oral tradition in Africa where, it has
been said, whenever an old man dies a whole library
disappears with him. In societies that have opted for oral
rather than written records, it is by word of mouth that
the guardians of the collective memory hand down from
one generation to the next stories and legends, society's
moral values and religion as well as detailed accounts of
actual events of yesterday or today. Any authentic
history of Africa must take the oral tradition as its raw
material and approach it with the same objective rigour
as other forms of historical evidence.


The faithful guardians
of Africa's oral tradition
by Amadou Hampâté Bâ
WHEN we speak of African tradition or history we mean
oral tradition; and no attempt at penetrating the history
and spirit of the African peoples is valid unless it relies
on that heritage of knowledge of every kind patiently transmitted
from mouth to ear, from master to disciple, down through the
ages.
This heritage is not yet lost, but lies in the memory of the last
generation of its great repositories, of whom it can be said: "they
are the living memory of Africa."
For some scholars, the whole problem is whether we can place
the same trust in the oral as in the written when it comes to
evidence of things past. In my view, that is not the right way to put
the problem. Written or oral, evidence is in the end only human
evidence and it is worth what the man is worth.
What is involved, therefore, behind the evidence itself, is the ac¬
tual value of the man who is giving the evidence, the value of the
chain of transmission he is part of, the trustworthiness of the in¬
dividual and collective memory, and the price attached to the truth
in a given society. In short: the bond between man and the spoken
word.
Now it is in oral societies that the function of the memory is
most highly developed and, furthermore, the bond between man
and the word is strongest. Where writing does not exist, man is
bound to the word he utters. He is committed by it. He Is his word
and his word bears witness to what he is. The very cohesion of
society depends on the value of and respect for the spoken word.
In African traditions at least the ones I know, which pertain to
the whole savannah zone south of the Sahara the spoken word
had, beyond its fundamental moral value, a sacred character
associated with its divine origin and with the occult forces
deposited in it. Superlative agent in magic, grand vector of
"aetheric" forces, it was not to be treated lightly.
Many religious, magical or social factors, then, combined to
preserve thé faithfulness of oral transmission. .
If a true African traditionalist were asked, "What is oral tradi-r

of the Executive Board of Unesco from 1962 to 1970. Founder and former
director of the Mali Institute of Human Sciences, he specializes in the
study ofAfrican literature and ethnology and, in particular, of the peoples
of the Niger Bend. His many books include L'Empire Peul du Macina (The

African Religions) and L'Etrange Destin de Wangrin (Wangrin's Strange
Destiny), a work for which he received the 1974 Grand Prix of Black

tion?" he would probably be nonplussed. He might perhaps reply,
after a lengthy silence: "It is total knowledge", and say no more.
What does the term oral tradition cover, then? What realities
does it convey, what knowledge does it transmit, what science
does it teach, and who are its transmitters?
Contrary to what some may think, African oral tradition is not
limited to stories and legends or even to mythological and
historical tales, and the man whom the French call a "griot" a
wandering minstrel/poet is far from being its one and only
qualified guardian and transmitter.
Oral tradition is the great school of life, all aspects of which are
covered and affected by it. It may seem chaos to those who do not
penetrate its secret; it may baffle the Cartesian mind accustomed
to dividing everything up into clear-cut categories. In oral tradition,
in fact, spiritual and material are not dissociated.
The oral tradition is able to put itself within men's reach, speak
to them according to their understanding, unveil itself in accor¬
dance with their aptitudes. It is at once religion, knowledge,
natural science, apprenticeship in a craft, history, entertainment,
recreation, since any point of detail can always take us all the way
back to primordial Unity.
Based on initiation and experience, oral tradition engages man in
his total being, and therefore we can say it has served to create a
particular type of man, to sculpt the African soul.
Linked with the everyday behaviour of man and community,
African culture is not, then, something abstract that can be
isolated from life. It involves a particular vision of the world, or
rather a particular presence in the worlda world conceived of as
a whole in which all things are linked together and interact.
African tradition conceives of speech as a gift of God. It is at
once divine in the downward direction and sacred as it rises up¬
wards. Let us look at the traditions of the savannah to the south of
the Sahara (what was formerly called the Bafour and constituted
the savannah zones of former French West Africa).
The Bambara tradition of the Komo (one of the great initiation
schools of the Mande group of peoples of Mali) teaches that the
Word, Kuma, is a fundamental force emanating from the Supreme
Being himselfMaa Ngala, creator of all things. It is the instru¬
ment of creation: "That which Maa Ngala says, is I " proclaims the
cantor, the singing priest of the god Komo.
The myth of the creation of the universe and of man which the
Komo Master of Initiates (who is always a smith) teaches circum¬
cised youths reveals that when Maa Ngala felt a yearning for an
interlocutor he created the First Man: Maa.
The story of Genesis used to be taught during the sixty-three-
day retreat imposed on the circumcised in their twenty-first year,
and then twenty-one years were spent in deeper and deeper study
of it.
On the edge of the sacred wood, where Komo lives, the first of
the circumcised group would chant to a rhythmic beat:
Maa Ngala! Maa Ngala!
Who is Maa Ngala?
Where is Maa Ngala?
The Komo cantor would respond:
Maa Ngala is infinite Force
None can place him in time.
Nor yet in space.
He is Dombali (Unknowable)
Dambali (Uncreated- Infinite).
Then, after the initiation, the recital of the primordial genesis
would begin:
There was nothing except a Being.
That Being was a living Emptiness,
Brooding potentially over contingent existences.
Infinite Time was the abode of that One Being.
The One Being gave himself the name Maa Ngala.
Maa Ngala wished to be known.
So he created Fan,
A wondrous Egg with nine divisions.
And Into It he introduced the nine fundamental
States of existence.
"When this primordial Egg came to hatch,- it gave birth to twen¬
ty marvellous beings that made up the whole of the universe, the
sum total of existing forces and possible knowledge.
"But alas! None of those first twenty creatures proved fit to
become the interlocutor (Kuma-nyon) that Maa Ngala had craved.
"So he took a bit of each of those twenty existing creatures and
mixed them; and then, blowing a spark of his own fiery breath into
the mixture, he created a new Being, Man, to whom he gave a part
of his own name: Maa. And so this new being, through his name
and through the divine spark introduced into him, contained
something of Maa Ngala himself."
Synthesis of all that exists, pre-eminent receptacle of the
supreme Force and confluence of all existing forces, Maa, Man,
received as his legacy a part of the divine creative power, the gift
of Mind and the Word.
Maa Ngala taught Maa, his interlocutor, the laws according to
which all the elements of the cosmos were formed and continue to
exist. He installed him as guardian of his Universe and charged him
with watching over the maintenance of universal Harmony. That is
why it weighs heavy, being Maa.
Initiated by his creator, Maa later passed all that he had learned
A wealth of cosmological meaning was carved into this granary
door by 'a sculptor of the Dogon people of Mali. The rows of
figures represent men and women from all over the world,
sprung from the remotest ancestors. The lock takes the form of
an altar to the ancestors, while chevrons at each side of the
central panel symbolize the flow of water and of speech. The
two door-posts are decorated with turtles. In Dogon lore a turtle
replaces the patriarch of each family during his absence.

"The smith forges the Word, The weaver weaves it. The leather-
worker curries it smooth", goes an African saying that expresses
the close relationship between traditions of craftsmanship and
the power of the word. According to tradition, craftsmen
accompany their work with ritual chanting, while their gestures
retrace the mystery of the creation. The weavers know the
secrets of their looms : of the eight main pieces of wood that
constitute the frame, the four vertical struts symbolize the
elements (earth, water, air and fire) and the four cardinal
compass-points, while four cross-pieces symbolize the four
collateral points. The weaver, placed in the middle, represents
the first man, Maa, at the centre of these eight dimensions of
space. Before setting to work he must touch each piece of the
loom, uttering words or litanies which correspond to the forces
of life embodied in them. The movement of his feet to and fro on
the pedal recalls the original rhythm of the creative word. Photo

on to his descendants; and that was the beginning of the great
chain of initiatory oral transmission of which the order of Komo
(unlike the orders of Nama, Kore, and so on in Mali) claims to be a
continuator.
In the image of Maa Ngala's speech, of which it is an echo,
human speech sets latent forces into motion. They are activated
and aroused by speechjust as a man gets up, or turns, at the
sound of his name.
Speech may create peace, as it may destroy it. It is like fire. One
ill-advised word may start a war just as one blazing twig may touch
off a great conflagration.
Tradition, then, confers on Kuma, the Word, not only creative
power but a double function of saving and destroying. That is why
speech, speech above all, is the great active agent in African
magic.
It must be borne in mind that in a general way all African tradi¬
tions postulate a religious vision of the world. The visible universe
is thought of and felt as the sign, the concretization or the outer
shell of an invisible, living universe, consisting of forces in
perpetual motion.
Within this vast cosmic unity everything is connected,
everything is bound solidly together; and man's behaviour both as
regards himself and as regards the world around him (the mineral,
vegetable, animal world and human society) is subject to a very
precise ritual regulation, which may vary in form with the various
ethnic groups and regions.
Violation of the sacred laws was supposed to cause an upset in
the balance of forces which would take expression in disturbances
of different kinds. Therefore magic action, that is, manipulation of
forces, generally aimed at restoring the troubled balance, re¬
establishing the harmony of which, as we have seen, Man had
been set up as guardian by his Creator.
The word "magic" is always taken in a bad sense in Europe
whereas in Africa it simply means management of forces, a thing
neutral in itself which may prove helpful or harmful according to
the direction it is given. It is said: "Neither magic nor fortune is bad
in itself. It is use of them that makes them good or bad."
Good magic, the magic of initiates and "master knowers", aims
at purifying men, animals and objects so as to put forces back into
order. This is where the force of speech is decisive.
But for spoken words to produce their full effect they must be
chanted rhythmically, because movement needs rhythm, which is
itself based on the secret of numbers. Speech must reproduce the
to-and-fro that is the essence of rhythm.
In ritual songs and incantatory formulas, therefore, speech is the
materialization of cadence. And if it is considered as having the
power to act on spirits, that is because its harmony creates
movements, movements which generate forces, those forces then
acting on spirits which themselves are powers for action.
In African tradition, speech, deriving its creative and operative
power from the sacred, is in direct relation with the maintenance or
the rupture of harmony in man and the world about him.
That is why most traditional oral societies consider lying as
moral leprosy. In traditional Africa the man who breaks his word w
kills his civil, religious and occult person. He cuts himself off from Y
19

himself and from society. It is better both for himself and for his
family that he should die rather than go on living.
The cantor of the Komo Dibi at Koulikoro, in Mali, sang in one of
his ritual poems:
Speech is divinely accurate.
One must be accurate with it.
The tongue that falsifies the word
Taints the blood of him that lies.
Here blood symbolizes the inner vital force whose harmony is
disturbed by the lie. "Who spoils his word spoils himself", says the
adage. When a man thinks one thing and says another he cuts
himself off from himself. He breaks the sacred unity, reflection of
cosmic unity, creating discord in and around him.
Now we can better understand the magico-religious and social
context of respect for the word in societies with an oral .tradition,
especially when it comes to transmitting words inherited from
ancestors or elders. The thing traditional Africa holds dearest is its
ancestral heritage. Its religious attachment to all that has been
passed down comes out in phrases like "I have it from my
Master", "I have it from my father", "I sucked it at my mother's
breast".
The great repositories of this oral heritage are the persons who
are called "traditionalists". They, the living memory of Africa, give
the best evidence as to Africa. Who are these masters?
In Bambara, they are called Domas or somas, the "knowers", or
donikebas, "makers of knowledge." In Fulani, they are called, ac¬
cording to region, silatiquls, gandos, or tchioriknes, words which
have this same sense of "knower".
They may be Master Initiates (and Masters of Initiates) in one
particular traditional branch (initiations of the smith, the weaver,
the hunter, the fisherman, etc.) or may possess complete
knowledge of the tradition in all its aspects. Thus there are domas
who know the blacksmith's science, the shepherd's, the weaver's,
arid there are also great initiation schools in the savannah in Mali,
for instance, the Komo, the Kore, the Nama, the Do, the Diarra
Wara, the Nya, the Nyawarole, and so on.
But let us make no mistake. African tradition does not cut life in¬
to slices and the knower is rarely a specialist. As a rule he is a
generalist. For example, one and the same old man will be learned
not only in plant science (the good or bad properties of every plant)
but in earth sciences (the agricultural or medicinal properties of the
different kinds of soil), and water sciences, astronomy,
cosmogony, psychology, and so on. What is involved is a science
of life in which knowledge can always be turned to practical use.
Keeper of the secrets of cosmic genesis and the sciences of life,
the traditionalist, usually gifted with a prodigious memory, is often
also the archivist of past events transmitted by tradition or of con¬
temporary events.
Therefore a history intended to be essentially African must
necessarily depend on the irreplaceable testimony of qualified
Africans. "You cannot dress a person's hair when he is away",
says the adage.
Generally speaking, the traditionalists were brushed aside if not
actually pursued by the colonial, power, which needless to say
sought to uproot local tradition in order to implant its own ideas
for, as they say, "Neither in a planted field nor in a fallow does one
sow". For that reason initiation usually took refuge in the bush and
quit the large towns, which were called tubabu-dugus or towns of
the whites meaning the colonizers.
Yet in the countries of the African savannah that made up the
Bafour, and doubtless elsewhere too, there still exist knowers who
continue to transmit the sacred deposit to those who consent to
listen and learn and show themselves worthy of receiving instruc¬
tion by their patience and their discretion, basic rules required by
the gods.
In ten or fifteen years all the last great domas, all the last old men
who have inherited the various branches of the tradition, will pro¬
bably have vanished. If we do not make haste to gather their
evidence and their teaching, the whole cultural and spiritual
patrimony of a people will go down into oblivion with them and a
rootless younger generation be abandoned to its own devices.
More than all other men the traditionalist-cfomas, great and
small, are bound to respect the truth. For them lying is not merely
a moral blemish but a ritual ban, violation of which would lay them
under interdict and make it impossible for them to continue to fulfil
their function.
This ritual prohibition exists, to the best of my knowledge in all
the traditions of the African savannah.
More than all others, the domas are bound by this obligation, for
as Master Initiates they are the great holders of the Word, the prin¬
cipal active agency of human life and of spirits.
A Dogon Master qf the Knife from the Pignari country (Ban-
diagara district) whom I knew in my youth was once led to lie in
order to save the life of a hunted woman whom he had hidden in
his house. After that incident he voluntarily resigned his office,
deeming that he no longer fulfilled the ritual conditions which
would make his tenure valid.
If the traditionalist or knower is so respected in Africa it is
because, to begin with, he respects himself. Inwardly in good
order, since he must never lie, he is a well-regulated man, master
of the forces that inhabit him. Round about him things fall into line
and disturbances subside.
Given this way of looking at things, the importance traditional
African education attaches to self-control can be better
20

As the "Master of Fire" and possessor of the secret of
transmutations, the smith plays a major role in African
oral culture. According to the tradition of the Bambara
people of Mali, the smith's skills go back to Maa, the
first man, to whom the mysteries of the forge were
revealed by his creator, Maa Ngala. In the language of
the Bambara the word Fan, meaning forge, is the same
as that denoting the Egg from which the universe
emerged at the moment of creation, for this "Primordial
Egg" was the first sacred forge. Far left, a young
apprentice of the Dogon people (Mali) keeps the smithy
fire alive by working the bellows. The forge, like the
smelting furnace and other work-places, provided the
ancestors with an opportunity to transmit to the young,
often through play, the group's cultural values. Left,

understood. To speak sparingly is the mark of a good education
and the sign of nobility. Very early the young boy learns to master
the expression of his emotions or his suffering, to contain the
forces that are in him, in the ¡mage of the primordial Maa who con¬
tained within him, submissive and orderly, all the forces of the
cosmos.
Of a respected knower or a man who is master of himself people
will say: "He's a Maa!" (or in Fulani a Naddo): that is, a complete
man.
We must not confuse the traditionalist-cfomas, who know how
to teach by amusing and by putting themselves within their au¬
dience's reach, with minstrels, story-tellers and public enter¬
tainers, who are usually of the dieli and woloso castes. The
wolosos (literally, ones born in the house) or house-captives were
servants or servant families attached for generations to one
household. Tradition allowed them complete freedom of gesture
and speech as well as considerable material rights over their
masters' possessions. For these, the discipline of truth does not
exist; and as we shall see later tradition recognizes their right to
travesty or embellish the facts, even grossly, so long as they con¬
trive to divert or interest their public. "The dieli', people say, "is
allowed to have two tongues."
By contrast, no African from a traditionalist background would
dream of questioning the veracity of what a traditionalist-t/oma
says, especially when it is a matter of passing on knowledge in¬
herited from the chain of ancestors.
Before speaking, the doma out of deference addresses the souls
of former men and asks them to come to his aid and save him from
a slip of the tongue or a lapse of memory that would make him
leave something put.
A traditionalist-cfoma who is not a smith by birth but knows
sciences relating to the forge will say before talking of it: "I owe k
that to so-and-so, who owes it to so-and so, etc." He will pay*
21

t homage to the ancestor of the smiths, crouching in token of
allegiance, with the tip of his elbow on the ground and his forearm
raised. Always there is reference to the chain in which the doma
himself is but one link.
In all branches of traditional knowledge the chain of transmis¬
sion is of supreme importance. If there is nb regular transmission
there'is no magic, only conversation or storytelling. Speech is then
inoperative. Transmitted through the chain, it is supposed to con¬
vey, from the original transmission on, a force that makes it
operative and sacramental.
This notion of respect for the chain or respect for transmission
means that the non-acculturated African will generally tend to
report a story in the very form in which he heard it, aided by the
prodigious memory illiterate persons have. If contradicted, he will
merely answer: "So-and so taught it to me like that!" always
naming his source.
Beyond the traditionalist-cfomas' personal integrity and their at¬
tachment to a chain of transmission, an additional guarantee of
authenticity is provided by permanent control by the peers or
elders who surround them, who keep a jealous guard on the
authenticity of what they transmit and pick up their slightest error.
Traditional education, especially when it concerns knowledge
associated with an initiation, is linked with experience and in¬
tegrated into life. That is why the researcher, European or African,
who wants to get close to African religious facts condemns himself
to remaining on the outer edge of the subject unless he consents
to live the initiation that corresponds to them and accept its rules,
which presupposes at the very least a knowledge of the language.
For there are things that are not to be explained but are experienc¬
ed and lived.
The traditional artisanal crafts are great vectors of the oral tradi¬
tion.
In traditional African society, human activities often had a
sacred or occult character, particularly those activities that consist
in acting on matter and transforming it, since everything is regard¬
ed as alive. Every artisanal function was linked with an esoteric
knowledge transmitted from generation to generation and
originating in an initial revelation.
Traditional craftsmen accompany their work with ritual chants
or sacramental rhythmic words, and their very gestures are con¬
sidered a language. In fact the gestures of each craft reproduce in
a symbolism proper to each one the mystery of the primal creation,
which, as I indicated earlier, was bound up with the power of the
Word. It is said:
The smith forges the Word,
The weaver weaves it.
The leather-worker curries it smooth.
The smith must have knowledge covering a vast sector of life.
Since he is reputed to be an occultist, his mastery of the secrets of
fire and iron make him the only person entitled to perform circum¬
cision; and, as we have seen, the grand Master of the Knife in the
Komo initiation is always a smith.
The smelting smith, who is both extractor and smelter of metal
is the one who \s furthest advanced in knowledge. To all the skills
of the founder he unites a perfect knowledge of the Sons of the
womb of the Earth (mineralogy) and the secrets of plants and the
bush. Indeed, he knows what kind of vegetation covers the earth
where it contains a particular metal and he can detect a lode of
gold merely by examining plants and pebbles.
The craft or the traditional function can be said to sculpt man's
being. The whole difference between modern education and oral
tradition lies there. What is learned at the Western school, useful
as it may be, is not always lived; whereas the inherited knowledge
of the oral tradition is embodied in the entire being. The in¬
struments or tools of a craft give material form to the sacred
words; the apprentice's contact with the craft obliges him to live
the word with every gesture he makes.
That is why oral tradition taken as a whole is something more
than the transmission of stories or of certain kinds of knowledge. It
generates and forms a particular type of man. One can say that
there is the smiths' civilization, the weavers' civilization, the
shepherds', and soon.
If the occult esoteric sciences are the apanage of the Master
of the Knife and the cantor of the gods, music on the other hand.
as well as lyric poetry, tales which enliven popular recreation, and
often history as well, are the province of the dieli, a sort of
troubadour or minstrel who may wander about the country or may
be attached to a family.
It has often been wrongly supposed that the die/is were the only
possible traditionalists. Who are they?
They can be divided into three categories: the musicians; the
ambassadors and courtiers; and the genealogists, historians or
poets (or men who are all three in one), who are usually also
storytellers and great travellers.
Tradition confers a special social status on die/is. Unlike the
borons (nobles), they have the right to be shameless, and they en¬
joy a very great freedom of speech. They may act uninhibitedly,
even impudently, and they sometimes joke about the gravest,
holiest things without its mattering.
They are under no compulsion either to be discreet or to hold the
truth in absolute respect. They can sometimes tell brazen lies
without being held to account. "That's what the dieli says! It isn't
the true truth, but we take it as it is." This maxim shows well
enough how, without being gulled by them, tradition accepts the
fabrications of the dieliwho, the maxim adds, has "a torn
mouth".
Since African society is fundamentally based on dialogue bet¬
ween individuals and discussion between communities or ethnic
groups, the dielis are the natural agents in these exchanges.
Authorized to have "two tongues in their mouth", they can if need
be unsay what they have already said without being held to strict
account. This would be impossible for a noble, who is not allowed
to go back on his word or change a decision overnight. A dieli will
even shoulder responsibility for a fault he has not committed in
order to remedy a situation or save face for the nobles.
Their Bambara name, dieli, means blood. And indeed like blood
they circulate in the body of society, which is cured or falls ill ac¬
cording to whether they temper or exacerbate conflicts with their
words and songs.
I should say at once, though, that all this is a matter of general
characteristics only and that dielis are not all necessarily impudent
or shameless. Far from it. Among them there are men who are call¬
ed dieli-faamas These are in no way inferior to
noblemen when it comes to courage, morality, virtues and
wisdom; and they never abuse the rights they have been granted
by custom.
The dielis took part in all the battles in history at the side of their
masters, whose courage they inspired by recalling their high
pedigree and the high exploits of their forefathers. For the African,
the evocation of his family name has great power. Even today one
greets him and gives him praise by repeating the name of his
lineage.
The secret of the die/is' power and influence over the horons
(nobles) resides in their knowledge of genealogy and family
history. Some dielis have been real specialists in this. Such dielis
seldom belong to a household, but travel throughout the country
in quest of more and more extensive historical information.
It is easy to see how the genealogist dielis, specializing in family
history and often endowed with prodigious memories, have quite
naturally become as it were the archivists of African society and,
occasionally, great historians. But let us keep in mind that they are
not the only persons with such knowledge. The historian dielis
can, admittedly, be called traditionalists; but with this reservation,
that theirs is a purely historical branch of tradition and that tradi¬
tion has many branches.
The fact of being born a dieli does not necessarily make a man a
historian, though it gives him a certain inclination in that direction.
Nor does it make him learned in traditional matters, a knower far
from it. Generally speaking the dieli caste is the one farthest
removed from matters connected with initiation those requiring
silence, discretion and control of one's speech.
The opportunity to become knowers is not closed to them,
however, any more than to anyone else. Just as a doma-
traditionalist (the traditional knower in the true sense of the term)
can be at the same time a great genealogist and historian, so a
dieli, like any member of any social category, can become a
traditionalist-cfo/ra if his aptitudes permit and if he has gone
through the corresponding initiations (with the exception, though,
of the Komo initiation, which is forbidden him).

A griot, or musician-entertainer, chants one of his
stories to the accompaniment of the kora, a
traditional instrument of the Malinke people of West
Africa. The griots are among the transmitters of
the oral tradition which is the very fibre of African
history. Above all else they are popular performers
who take liberties with words which are strictly
forbidden for the other custodians of the oral
tradition, known as domas, who embody the
solemnity of the spoken word.
The dieli who is also a t/oma-traditionalist constitutes an ab¬
solutely reliable source of information, for his being an initiate con¬
fers a high moral value on him and makes him subject to the pro¬
hibition against lying. He becomes another man. He is the "dieli-
king" whom people consult for his wisdom and his knowledge and
who, albeit able to entertain, never abuses his customary rights.
Generally speaking, one does not become a cfoma-traditionalist
by staying in one's village. The man who travels discovers and lives
other initiations, notes the differences or similarities, broadens the
scope of his understanding. Wherever he goes he takes part in
meetings, hears historical tales, and lingers where he finds a
transmitter of tradition who is skilled in initiation or in genealogy;
in this way he comes into contact with the history and traditions of
the countries he passes through.
One can say that the man who has become a cfoma-traditionalist
has been a seeker and a questioner all his life and will never cease
to be one.
The African of the savannah used to travel a great deal. The
result was exchange and circulation of knowledge. That is why
the collective historical memory in Africa is seldom limited to one
territory. Rather it is linked with family lines or ethnic groups that
have migrated across the continent.
Many caravans used to plough their way across the country, us¬
ing a network of special routes traditionally protected by gods and
kings, routes where one was safe from pillage or attack. To do
otherwise would have meant exposing oneself either to a raid or to
the risk of violating, unawares, som'e local taboo and paying the
consequences dearly. Upon arrival in a strange country travellers
would go and "entrust their heads" to some man of standing who
would thereby become their guarantor, for "to touch a guest is to
touch the host himself."
The great genealogist is necessarily always a great traveller.
Thus Molom Gaolo, the greatest genealogist I have been privileged
to know, possessed the genealogy of all the Fulani of Senegal.
When his great age no longer allowed him to go abroad he sent his
son Mamadou Molom to carry on his survey of the Fulani families
that had migrated through the Sudan (Mali) with El Hadj Omar.
When I knew Molom Gaolo, he had succeeeded in compiling and
retaining the history of about forty generations.
He had the habit of going to every baptism and every funeral in
the leading families so as to record the circumstances of deaths
and births, which he would add to the list already filed in his
astonishing rnemory. So he was able to declaim to any important
Fulani: "You are the son of So-and-so. . . Each of them died at such
and such a place of such a cause and was buried in such and such
a spot", and so on. Or else: "So-and-so was baptized on a certain
day at a certain hour by the Marabout So-and-so..." Of course all
this information was and still is orally transmitted and recorded by
the genealogist's memory alone. People have no idea of what the
memory of an "illiterate" can store up. A story once heard is
graven as if on a matrix and can then be produced intact, from the
first word to the last, whenever the memory calls on it.
Molom Gaolo died at the age of 105, around 1968 I believe. His
son Mamadou Gaolo, now 50, lives in Mali where he is carrying on
his father's work by the same purely oral means, being himself
illiterate.
Everyone is something of a genealogist in Africa, and capable of
going far back in his own family tree. If not, it would be as if he
had no "identity card." In Mali in olden times there was no one
who did not know at least ten or twelve generations of his
forebears.
But today the great problem of traditional Africa is in fact the
break in transmission. Fleeing the large towns, initiation has taken
refuge in the bush where, because of the attraction of the large
towns and because of the new needs, the old men find fewer
docile ears to which they can transmit their teaching.
For the oral tradition and all that bears on it, therefore, we stand
today in the presence of the last generation of great depositories.
That is why the work of collecting must be intensified over the next
ten or fifteen years, after which the last great living monuments of
African culture will have vanished, and with them the irreplaceable
treasures of a special kind of education, at once material,
psychological and spiritual, based on a feeling for the unity of life
the sources of which are lost in the night of time.

The Hamitic
myth exploded
Modern findings have refuted
a once-prevalent theory
on the peopling of the African continent
by Dmitri A. Olderogge
HISTORIANS were long convinced
that the peoples of Africa had
never had any history of their
own, nor any evolution that was particular¬
ly theirs. Everything in the nature of a
cultural achievement was thought to have
been brought to them from elsewhere, by
waves of immigrants coming from Asia.
Such convictions are reflected in the works
of many nineteenth-century European
scholars.
These views provided linguists with a
basis for what is known as the Hamitic
theory, according to which the develop¬
ment of civilization in Africa was influenced
by the Hamitic peoples who came from
Asia. This theory reflects the influence of
the ideas of Hegel, who divided the peoples
of the world into two kinds: historical
peoples, who had contributed to the
development of mankind, and non-
historical peoples, who had taken no part
in the spiritual development of the world.
According to Hegel, there was no real
historical evolution in Africa proper. The
destinies of the northern fringes of the con¬
tinent could be said to be linked to those of
Europe. As a Phoenician colony, Carthage
was an appendage of Asia and there was
nothing of the African spirit in Egypt.
It was in Asia, said Hegel, that the light
of the spirit dawned and the history of the
world began. This was considered to be
beyond dispute and European scholars
regarded Asia as the cradle of. mankind
from which emerged all the peoples who
invaded Europe and Africa. Hegel's ideas
exercised a considerable influence over
almost all the scientific research done on
Africa in the nineteenth century. The
cultural and historical school of thought
repudiated the theory of a uniform, overall
development of mankind and advanced a
diametrically opposed theory, postulating
the existence of different cycles of civiliza¬
tion, differentiated by intrinsic elements
derived from a mainly material culture.
DMITRI A. OLDEROGGE, of the USSR, is an
egyptologist and specialist in the history and
social and cultural anthropology of Africa. A
corresponding member of the USSR Academy
of Sciences, he is the author of several books
and studies including Western Sudan, Peoples
of Africa and The Hamitic Question in African
Studies.
According to these writers, the spread of
cultural achievements was due mainly to
migrations. The original population of
Africa consisted of dwarfish races the
Pygmies and the San possessing virtually
no elements of culture. Then, from south¬
east Asia, dark-skinned, fuzzy-haired
Negritic peoples arrived in migratory
waves; they spread all over the Sudanese
savannah and penetrated into the
equatorial forest, bringing with them the
beginnings of agriculture, the cultivation of
bananas and root tubers, the use of
wooden implements and bows and arrows,
and the building of round and square huts.
They were followed, so the theory main¬
tained, by waves of proto-Hamites, also
from Asia, but in this case from regions fur¬
ther north than those where the Negritic
people first developed. The newcomers
spoke agglutinative-type languages with
noun classes and they taught the in¬
digenous peoples of Africa the use of the
hoe in agriculture, the cultivation of
sorghum and other cereals, the rearing of
small-horned cattle, and so on. The cross¬
breeding of the proto-Hamites with the
Negritic peoples resulted in the birth of
Bantu peoples.
The next arrivals were successive waves
of fair-skinned Hamites, coming into Africa
through the Suez isthmus and across the
Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. They were said to
have been the ancestors of the Fula,
Hausa, Masai, Bari, Galla and Somali
peoples and also of the Khoi-Khoi. They
brought further elements of culture to
Africa, large-horned cattle, spears, multiple
uses of skins and hides, shields, and so on.
These fair-skinned Hamites, it was main¬
tained, came originally from the steppes of
western Asia.
The next migratory wave brought the
Semitic peoples, who provided the basis
for the development of the culture of an¬
cient Egypt. They brought with them the
cultivation of cereals, the use of the plough
and various objects of bronze. They were
followed, in Egypt, by the arrival of the
Hyksos and the Hebrews and, in Ethiopia,
by that of the Habashat and the Mehri. The
last to come were the Arabs, in the seventh
century. All these peoples brought with
them to Africa many elements of civiliza¬
tion that were quite unknown before their
arrival.
In linguistics, the Hamitic theory began
to emerge parallel with the theories of the
cultural-historic shool. The founder of this
theory, C. Meinhof, held that the ancestors
of the present-day San were the original in¬
habitants of Africa, that they spoke
languages with the click consonants and,
in general, that they belonged to a par¬
ticular racial type. The Negritos, con¬
sidered to be the original inhabitants of the
tropical and Sudanese region, spoke
languages of an isolating type, with
monosyllabic roots. Subsequently Hamitic
peoples came into the Sudan from Arabia
by way of North Africa. These newcomers
spoke inflected languages; they engaged in
cattle-breeding and, from the cultural point
of view, were on a much higher level than
the Negritos. Some of the Hamite invaders,
however, traversed the savannahs of East
Africa and cross-bred with the indigenous
population to produce peoples speaking
the Bantu languages.
In short, this pattern can be reduced to a
film in four sequences. At the outset, there
were, the click languages and these were
followed by the highly rudimentary
isolating languages spoken by the Negritic
peoples of the Sudan. The mixture of these
languages with the Hamitic languages pro¬
duced the Bantu group of languages of the
superior agglutinative type. Finally, the
languages spoken by the Hamitic con¬
querors introduced the inflected languages
which were eminently more developed.
The Hamitic theory, which originated in
Germany, was upheld by many linguists
and was widely accepted throughout
western Europe and beyond.
In the period between the two World
Wars, however, all these theories collaps¬
ed. The discovery in Cape Province, in
1924, of Australopithecus raised the first
doubts. Other discoveries followed and arew
still constantly being made, not only in theP

southern part of Africa, but also in North
Africa and, more particularly, towards the
east, in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia. All
these discoveries combined to show,
without any possibility of error, that the
development of man in all his racial variety
took place in Africa. Thus, any theories ac¬
cording to which Africa was populated by
consecutive waves of immigrants are
untenable.
Africa is the only continent where there
is evidence, in unbroken chronological se¬
quence, of all the stages in the develop¬
ment of man. In fact, specimens of
Australopithecus, Pithecanthropus,
Neanderthal man and Homo Sapiens suc¬
ceeded one another, each with their im¬
plements, from the most distant eras right
through to the Neolithic age. These
discoveries proved that it would be totally
wrong to deny that Africa had an en¬
dogenous cultural development. In this
respect, the rock paintings and petroglyphs
in the Atlas mountains, in southern Africa
and in the Sahara, provide striking
evidence with the most far-reaching im¬
plications.
There is no longer the faintest shadow of
doubt about the great age of ar¬
chaeological remains, since relative
chronology (based on the form and treat¬
ment of objects and their position in the
various geological strata) has now been
supplemented by absolute chronology bas¬
ed on such scientific methods as carbon-14
and potassium-argon dating. The picture
of the pattern of the cultural evolution of
the African peoples has been completely
transformed. For instance, it has been
found that the Neolithic era at the latitudes
of the Sahara and the Sahel dates back
much further than was thought. This
discovery completely alters the relationship
between African development, the
Mediterranean world and especially the
Near East.
The remains discovered in the moun¬
tainous regions of Tassili N'Ajjer and also at
Tadrart-Acacus in the borderland between
Algeria and Libya are quite conclusive. Ex¬
amination of the traces of hearths and the
remnants of ceramics discovered, shows
that the people were already using pottery
in 6000 BC. From these findings we may
conclude that the Neolithic age in Tassili
N'Ajjer and the Ennedi is apparently older
than the Neolithic age in the countries of
the Maghreb and is contemporary with that
of southern Europe and Cyrenaica.
Of particular significance are the results
of research done on the organic remains
found in Lower Nubia in camps going back
to the Neolithic age. From the results ob¬
tained it has been possible to draw the con¬
clusion that people already gathered and
prepared grain from wild cereals in the thir¬
teenth millennium before our era.
We may expect that some chronological
tabulations may subsequently be made
more precise. However, the theory about
the peopling of the Old World is completely
discredited. Instead, Africa must be
recognized as the centre from which men
and techniques were disseminated in one
of the key periods in the development of
mankind (the lower Palaeolithic). In later
eras we find evidence of a reversal of this
trend with migratory currents flowing back
to the continent of Africa.

Horses and (possibly) antelopes
disport themselves in this prehistoric
painting on stone at Jabbaren, Tassili
N'Ajjer (Algeria). On the next eight
pages we present a selection of
masterpieces incised or painted on
living rock by African artists in
prehistoric times. Most of our
illustrations are details from the
mysterious frescoes, discovered at
hundreds of sites in the Sahara since
the last century, which afford vivid
but tantalizing glimpses of a society
and its natural environment many
thousands of years before climatic
changes made the region largely
uninhabitable.



Old masters
of the New Stone Age
Rock paintings that present
a dazzling pageant of African prehistory
by Joseph Ki-Zerbo
AFRICAN prehistoric art is found
mainly in the high plateaus and
uplands of the continent. The
mountain ranges, and the depressions,
river basins and forest lowlands of the
equatorial zone are far less rich in this
respect. In the areas where the largest
number of finds occur, sites are mainly
located in cliffs on the edges of the
uplands.
The two most important areas are the
Sahara and southern Africa. In the zone
bounded on the north by the Atlas Moun¬
tains, on the east by the Red Sea, on the
south by the tropical forest and on the west
by the Atlantic, hundreds of sites have
been found, containing tens or perhaps
hundreds of thousands of carvings and
paintings.
Examples are found to the south of Oran
and in the Tassili N'Ajjer area in Algeria; in
southern Morocco; in the Fezzan (Libya) ;
in Air and Ténéré (Niger) ; in Tibesti
(Chad) ; in Nubia; in the highlands of
Ethiopia; in the Dhar Tichit (Mauritania)
and at Mocamedes (Angola).
The other main area is in the tapering
part of southern Africa bounded by the In¬
dian Ocean and the Atlantic which includes
Lesotho, Botswana, Malawi, Ngwane,
Namibia and the Republic of South Africa,
with particularly significant finds in the
Orange Free State, the Vaal River area and
the Transvaal.
As to why there should have been this
flowering in the deserts and steppes, one
reason is that at the period in question they
were nothing of the kind. When they
became so, this in itself, plus the dryness
of the air, helped to preserve them and turn
them into natural museums. In the Sahara,
for instance, objects have been found that
had lain undisturbed for thousands of l
years. As to why it should have occurred I
27

OLD MASTERS OF THE NEW STONE AGE
on the edges of the upland valleys, the
reason is that these were the best habitats,
most easily defensible and within reach of
water and game.
If we are to fit prehistoric art finds into an
intelligible time-scale, our first approach
must be geological and ecological since the
environment, for peoples without our
technological adjuncts, was more of a con¬
straint than it is today and both provided
and imposed the general framework of ex¬
istence.
Although some authors consider that its
origins go back to the Mesolithic, African
rock art dates essentially from the
Neolithic. It has become customary to call
the major periods of rock art by the name
of an animal which thus provides a
typological reference point. Four major
series are thus named after the Bubalus,
the Ox, the Horse and the Camel.
The bubalus (Bubalus antiquus) was a
kind of enormous buffalo which, according
to the palaeontologists, dates from the
beginning of the Quaternary. It is depicted
from the beginning of rock art (around 7000
BC) to about 4000 BC. This period is also
characterized by elephants and
rhinoceroses. The ox is either Bos ibericus
(or brachyceros) with short, stout horns, or
Bos africanus, with a magnificent lyre-
shaped pair of horns. It appears around
4000 BC.
The horse (Equus cabal/us) sometimes
pulling a chariot, makes its appearance
about 1500 BC. The "flying gallop" gait,
whilst not realistic, is naturalistic on the
western track from Morocco to the Sudan,
whereas on the eastern "road" from the
Fezzan it is highly stylized. By now we are
well into the period of history when the hip¬
popotamus disappears from rock pain¬
tings, no doubt denoting the end of peren¬
nial water. The camel brings up the rear of
this historical caravan. Introduced into
Egypt by the Persian conquest about 500
BC, it is common towards the beginning of
the Christian era.
In general, where both exist, carvings are
earlier than paintings. Carving was done in
the softer sandstone rocks, and in granite
and quartzite as well, by means of a
sharpened stone struck with a Neolithic
hammerstone, specimens of which have
been found near the carvings.
With only this minimal equipment, the
precision of the technique is brilliant. The
elephant at Bardai (Chad) is delineated with
a single light line. It is hardly more than a
sketch, but it brings out the essentials. The
elephants at In Galjeien (Mathendous) and
In Habeter II, on the other hand, are deeply
carved with a heavy, lifelike line, and so is
the rhinoceros at Ganoa (Tibesti). The
groove is either V-shaped, or shaped like a
U and taken down to a depth of about a
centimetre. The notches were made either
with a stone axe or a piece of very hard
wood, damp sand possibly being used as
an abrasive.
Making these carvings must sometimes
have called for distinct athletic ability. At
Oued Djerat, for instance, there is an
28
elephant 4.5 metres high, and the beginn¬
ings of a rhinoceros 8 metres long.
In central and southern Africa, carvings
with broadly incised outlines are thought to
be associated with religious purposes,
whilst delicately grooved carvings possibly
denote an initiatory or instructional aim.
Delicate effects are achieved by hollowing
and highly polishing some internal surfaces
to represent the shades of animals' coats or
their loads. This technique foreshadows
the bas-reliefs of Pharaonic Egypt. Indeed,
trte figure is sometimes produced by carv¬
ing it entirely in intaglio, like a cameo.
The natural rock is used very appositely.
For instance, a giraffe is carved on an
oblong block whose shape it exactly fits
(West Transvaal). Similarly in the Leeufon-
tein area, a rhinoceros is carved on a rock
with a rough surface and angular ridges
that precisely reproduce the animal's
carapace.
Rock paintings should not be considered
in isolation from carvings. Outline carvings
on certain walls suggest that the artists first
carved and then painted. Here again, ar¬
tistic work sometimes called for feats of
athletic prowess.
At Oued Djerat there is a Horse period
painting 9 metres long on a steeply sloping
ceiling, and at some of the Tassili sites,
such as Tissoukai, paintings begin more
than 4 metres from the ground, as though
it was wished to avoid the lower levels
within people's reach. This necessitated
the use of crude ladders or even scaf¬
folding. The paintings are either in
monochrome or polychrome.
Traces of workshops have been found.
At l-n-ltinen, for instance, little flat grind¬
stones have been dug up along with tiny
grinders to reduce the rock to powder and
also little pans of paint.
The relatively extensive range of colours
is based on certain basic tones such as red
and brown, obtained from iron oxide
ochres, white obtained from kaolin, animal
droppings, latex or zinc oxide, and black
extracted from charcoal, ground calcined
bones, or from smoke and burnt fat. There
are also yellows, greens, violets, and other
colours.
The ingredients were ground to a fine
powder with a pestle and mortar, mixed
together, and then made up with a liquid,
perhaps milk, the casein in which is an ex¬
cellent binder, dripping, or else white of
egg, honey or cooked bone-marrow. This
explains the brightness of the tints after all
these thousands of years.
The colours were applied with the
fingers, with feathers, with straw or chew¬
ed wood spatulas, or with brushes made of
animal hairs fixed to sticks with tendons.
They were also sprayed on by squirting the
liquid from the mouth. It was this last pro¬
cess that was responsible for the outlines
of hands still to be seen on rock faces and
which are a kind of authenticating
signature on these masterpieces.
Sometimes corrections are made without k
erasing the original lines: giving oxen withf
Some of the oldest works of African rock
art show the tropical animals that
flourished during a period of humid
climate when the Sahara was a region of
lakes and rivers bordered by luxuriant
vegetation, rich in game and fish, grassy
valleys and wooded mountain slopes.
Modern scholars have named the most
ancient style of this art after the Bubalus
antiquus (a type of buffalo with massive
horns, now long extinct) although other
animals such as elephants and
rhinoceroses (see next double page) are
also found depicted in the semi-
naturalistic Bubalus style. The horns of
this specimen (1) engraved in the rock at
Oued Mathendous (Libya) measure 72 cm
from tip to tip. Incised between them is
an ostrich. (2) The giraffe, an animal found
in its natural state only in Africa, is so
frequently depicted that specialists believe
that it must have proliferated in the
Sahara in Neolithic times. The creator of
->

this masterwork at Enneri Blaka (Niger)
made sure that the markings of each
animal's coat, realistically rendered by
intricate patterns of tiny dots hammered
into the rock, were subtly different from
those of the rest. (3) Graceful portrait of a
horse, also at Enneri Blaka. Paintings of
horses, antelopes and mouflons (wild
sheep) are thought to belong to a later
stage than the Bubalus style. The mouflon
with powerful horns (5) at Ti N'Zoumaitak
(Algeria) is surrounded by curious forms
including a jellyfish-like creature (right)
and a strange animal with a human nose
(left). (4) By the time this tranquil pastoral
scene at Sefar (Algeria) was painted,
prehistoric man had learned to dominate
and control livestock in a Sahara of
villages and encampments. (Note the
dwelling at right of painting.)

, four horns, men with three arms, and so
forth.
The term "petroglyph" has been coined
for rock pictures. More than any other in
fact, this kind of art is a sign language, i.e.
a bridge between reality and idea. It is a set
of graphic symbols and to read it one needs
a key. When it comes to explaining it pro¬
perly, the main drawback is our ignorance
of the society that produced it. That is why
it is important not to make over-hasty inter¬
pretations by omitting the descriptive stage
in which the sign language itself is sub¬
jected to formal analysis.
Providing African rock paintings with
captions such as "Justices of the Peace",
"The White Lady", "Man pulling teeth",
"Josephine sold by her sister", "Martians"
and suchlike, distorts them from the
outset, since it superimposes an interpreta¬
tion of a single observer from another
civilization with quite different symbols and
codes. African prehistoric art must be inter¬
preted by reference to indigenous values
and it is only when the local environment of
time, space and culture fails to provide an
answer to a problem that we are entitled to
look elsewhere for the solution.
To what extent can African prehistoric
art be regarded as the illustrated edition of
the first African history book?
In the first place, it constitutes a
documentary film about the physical en¬
vironment of the first societies to live on
our continent. H. Lhote has found hip¬
popotamus bones at a site at Adrar Bous,
radiocarbon dated to about 3100 BC, which
confirms the historical accuracy of (for in¬
stance) the group of hippopotamuses
depicted at Assadjen Ouan Mellen. Now
this animal is an ecological indicator since it
required perennial water in order to exist.
The elephant which eats enormous quan¬
tities of vegetation daily is another indicator
and the Sahara of the prehistoric paintings
must have been a great expanse of
parkland with Mediterranean vegetation,
traces of which have survived to this day.
This environment gradually gave way to a
Sudanic Sahel biotope. In the Horse and
Chariot period, some representations of
trees are found, such as palm-trees, no
doubt indicating oases.
In southern Africa the northern or
Rhodesian style is full of drawings of trees
some of which are identifiable. Shelters in
areas that are now desert are peopled with
a teeming, varied fauna, like some latter-
day Noah's Ark or a petrified zoo. There are
carvings of fish, tremendous shaggy wild
animals like the extinct buffalo, with its
enormous horns up to 3 metres across,
felines like the cheetah and the aardwolf,
guenons and baboons (at Tin Tazarift),
ostriches, owls and so on. On all sides
there are hunting scenes, reminders of the
perennial duel between man and beast.
This profusion of hunting scenes from
the Nile to the Atlantic is vivid illustration of
the existence of a whole hunting civiliza¬
tion. Even large animals like the elephant
did not escape, as witness the great hun¬
ting scenes at Upper Mertoutek. Traps are
nearly everywhere associated with the
symbols of hunters in a very original
cultural pattern, which existed over almost
the whole of Africa for tens of thousands
"This kind of art is a sign language, a set
of graphic symbols", writes Prof. Joseph
Ki-Zerbo, "and to read it we need a key".
Photos on these pages illustrate some of
the conundrums facing specialists as they
try to interpret these beautiful but baffling
images and explain the interplay of styles,
techniques and influences which may
connect them. Photo 1, sweeping curves
convey the intensity of movement in this
silhouette of a woman with a bowl (Sefar,
Algeria). With photo 7, showing
silhouetted dancers from a prehistoric site
at the Tsisbab Ravine (South Africa) it
draws attention to the seeming kinship
between specimens of Saharan rock art
and that of southern Africa whose artists
also worked within a figurative tradition.
In the present state of knowledge it is
impossible to say whether influences were
transmitted between the two regions or
whether these artistic traditions evolved
independently. (8) One of the most
celebrated frescoes in southern Africa
(also at the Tsisbab Ravine) depicts a so-
called "White Lady" accompanied by
figures painted yellow, brown or black. It
is thought that the white colouring may
indicate ritual make-up. Portraits of a
rhinoceros (2, 3 and 4) bring out three
distinctive techniques of representing the
same animal. In (2) the essential outlines
of the rhino's body are traced with a
thick, heavy stroke that contrasts sharply
with the fine incision delineating the
animal shown in photo 4 (at Oued Djerat,
Tassili N'Ajjer, Algerian Sahara). Photo 3
shows a painted rhino at Oumet el Ham
(Mauritania). Such paintings, in which the
pigment is applied to the rough rock with
great artistry, seem to be later than
engravings. In spite of differences in
technique, each image shows a real
knowledge of the animal and a flair for
precise observation. Two puzzling images
that have so far defied all attempts at
explanation are the two-headed cow
(Sefar) in photo 5 and the even more
intriguing representation of a cow with
two hindquarters and no head (Oued
Mathendous) in photo 6.

of years until very late in the historical
period.
These pictures also show the gradual
transition from trapping animals or taking
them into captivity, to feeding them and
then to domesticating them. There is a man
armed with a bow holding an animal on a
leash, whilst at Tissoukai moufflon are be¬
ing hunted with hounds. The lifelike saluki
at Sefar was obviously the friend of desert
man then as now. There are also sheep and
goats. Even boats are depicted, including
one at Tin Tazarift shaped rather like the
papyrus boats of the lakes and rivers of
Chad and Nubia.
There are paintings at l-n-ltinen showing
men bending down using angled tools,
.which are reminiscent of the harvest
scenes with sickles of Pharaonic bas-
reliefs. At Battle Cave, San girls are
depicted setting off food-gathering, their
digging-sticks over their shoulders. The
sheer profusion of artifacts depicted on
rocks or found loose over enormous areas
of Africa, especially those that are now
desert, gives an interesting idea of the
population density in those areas.
African prehistoric art has also much to
tell us about the clothing of the people of
those days. As often happens in early
civilizations, we find that the men were
more decoratively dressed than the
women, until the Ox period, when the
situation seems to have been reversed.
The home is often depicted schematical¬
ly by hemispheres representing huts, in
which furniture and also family scenes can
be seen. Buxom women are seen sitting in
front of the huts with their children, calves
are carefully tethered in a row to a rope,
whilst men are busy milking the cows.
The vast fresco at the Iheren shelter, one
of the high points of prehistoric painting,
shows finely caparisoned oxen, ridden by
women in rich attire, passing by with
waterskins hanging from their flanks.
Some animals lower their heads to the
water-hole, whilst a huge herd moves for¬
ward in stately fashion. Women in their
finery lounge outside their homes, and men
. with feathers in their hair have stopped,
seemingly to greet them.
We do not know the meaning of the
two-headed oxen or the oxen with two her¬
maphrodite bodies and but a single head to
be seen at Oued Djerat nor of the
magnificently carved helixes associated
with many animals, as with the Bubalus at
Oued Djerat. Some scholars consider that
the helix symbolizes the continuity of life.
As for the umbilical link to be seen between
two people, as for instance one starting at
the intersection of a woman's thighs and
ending at the navel of a bowman out hun¬
ting, it seems as though it stands for a
magical flux going from the mother (who is
praying, with upraised hands) to her son,
who is in a dangerous situation. Again, in
southern Africa (Botswana), a rain-making
animal is shown being led across the coun¬
try on a rope held by a procession of expec¬
tant people. Sun motifs form part of the
same religious background.
Some pictures nevertheless,, are still
obscure, and they will only ever be explain- k
ed by reference to a genuinely African Y

OLD MASTERS OF THE NEW STONE AGE
, cultural and religious context. This is what
happened with regard to a scene at Tin
Tazarift, previously entitled "conven¬
tionalized oxen". Because their legs seem¬
ed to be reduced to stumps, it had been
supposed that they were lying down, but
A. Hampaté Ba realized that in fact they
had been led into the water as part of the
lotori ceremony to celebrate the ox's
aquatic origin.
The tendency to explain all the features
of African culture by the theory of outside
influence must be rejected. This does not,
however, mean denying any outside in¬
fluence, but simply involves defining it
carefully. Franco-Cantabrian rock art,
which goes back about 40,000 years, is
Palaeolithic and hence earlier than African
prehistoric art. (Saharan Neolithic, on the
other hand, is earlier than European
Neolithic). There was thus a strong tempta¬
tion to argue that the inspiration of artists
on the African continent came from the
north, and there was even talk of a
Eurafrican art with its focal point in
Europe in fact, a sort of Hamitic theory in
the field of African prehistoric art (see arti¬
cle page 24).
Now there is no truth in this at all. Quite
apart from the fact that there is a difference
of 15,000. years between the development
of the two schools of art, it is accepted that
the art of eastern Spain (which would have
had to be the connecting link for any in¬
fluence there was) has nothing in common
with the art of southern Oran, the Tassili
and the Fezzan. The real flowering of
prehistoric art came from the Atlas, and its
focal points are nothing if not African.
People have also wondered whether it
was not from the east (i.e. from the Nile
Valley) that this type of art radiated out to
the interior of the continent. Now it is ob¬
vious that the art of the Egyptian Nile
flourished much later than that of Saharan
and Sudanic Africa. The Saharan represen¬
tations of oxen with discs between horns
are much earlier than those of the cow god¬
dess Hathor. The magnificent ram with a
sphere at Bou Alem is much earlier than the
ram of Amon, which only appears in Egypt
under the XVIIIth Dynasty. The superb
Egyptian-type boats depicted in the Sahara
(e.g. at Tin Tazarift) are no doubt simply
Saharan type boats.
Of course Egypt had a tremendous in¬
fluence on the interior of Africa, though no
doubt it was limited, but what is even more
certain is that the prehistoric civilization of
the Sahara is earlier in time. It is also true
that no obstacle except distance separated
the peoples of the Ahaggar, the Tassili and
the Fezzan from the Nile Valley, which was
for a long time (until the drying-up of the
Sahara) a rather unpleasant swampy area.
It was only from the so-called "historic"
period onwards that Egyptian civilization
achieved that splendour as a result of
which everything is now attributed to it.
But where art and technology are con¬
cerned, the focal points were originally in
the Sahara, in what is now the modern
state of the Sudan, in East Africa and in the
Middle East. Moreover, the Sahara of
prehistory is itself much more indebted to
the centres of the south-east than to the
Middle East.
Some authors hold that the Bubalus
period of rock art is to be attributed to ill-
defined "Mediterranean" people, white or
half-caste according to different authors.
The so-called "round head" period is at¬
tributed to "negroids" whom some con¬
sider to have interbred with peoples from
the Middle East and who supposedly con¬
stitute the Sudanic Neolithic tradition. The
Ox period was supposedly the work of the
ancestors of the Fulani. Lastly, it is claim¬
ed, the influence of the so-called Guiñean
tradition, further south, can be seen as far
away as in the buildings of the Tichit cliffs
(Mauritania).
The whole edifice of this reasoning, it
must be said, remains highly precarious
and gives great weight to population
movements from outside Africa. People
can refer to "the distinct African influence"
in a Sahara rock picture. But above all, this
reconstruction tends to equate concepts as
Using skilful stylization and turning to their advantage the rough
texture of the rock, artists of the Neolithic Sahara could achieve
subtle and expressive effects when portraying the human form.
Like so manv rock paintings, that of the so-called "Abyssinian of
Jabbaren" (1) with his wispy beard (Tassili, Algeria) has survived
the passage of time with astonishing freshness owing to the
resistance of the pigment. The dynamic, willowy movements of a
sprinter and two archers are captured in studies from Jabbaren
(5), Sefar (6) and Tafilalet (4) in Algeria. The bow must have
revolutionized life in the Sahara in Neolithic times. The portrait of
the sprinting woman (4), here published for the first time, is fron;
one of several prehistoric rock art sites discovered in the Sahara
in the last few years by the French ethnologist H.-J. Hugot and
the Swiss photographer Maximilian Bruggmann. (2) Curious
study of a "unicorn ox". Artists depicted the horns of oxen with
particular care and often used a convention whereby the animal's
head was shown in profile and the horns frontally. At some
prehistoric Sahara sites small sculptured figures of hares, rams
and other animals have been unearthed. (3) Polished
granite miniature from Oued Amezar, Algeria, is believed to
depict a ruminant lying down.

different as race, ethnic group, life-style
and culture. People refer to blacks, whites,
Fulani, Africans, Capsians and Sudanic
peoples without defining any of these
terms for obvious reasons.
The "white ladies" in African rock pain¬
tings, like the one in South Africa whose
face only is white (reminding the Abbé
Breuil of the frescoes at Knossos, and
"processions of prospectors from the Per¬
sian Gulf"), no doubt represent priests,
hunters or African girls coming out of in¬
itiation ceremonies, just as they are to be
seen today, painted with white kaolin
which denotes the death of a previous per¬
sonality and the acquisition of a new
status.
African prehistoric art is not dead. In the
field of aesthetics proper, it is the source of
inspiration for modern African art. To this
day its characteristic range of colours is
repeated in masks and in dancers' regalia.
It lives on, if only in the unchanging place-
names. A valley running into the Oued
Djerat is called Tin Tehed, or "place of the
she-ass" and there is indeed a fine carving
of an ass there. Issoukai-n-Afella is
reputedly haunted by spirits (junun),
perhaps because there is a horrible animal
figure, part-fowl, part-owl, with a colossal
sex organ who peers over a pile of votive
stones thrown there to propitiate it.
Africans are cut off from this art-form by
distance, a barrier overcome only by
scholars and experts from wealthy coun¬
tries, and it deserves to be reintroduced in¬
to their lives, at least through the medium
of school syllabuses. It needs to be jealous¬
ly protected from the various kinds of
damage that threaten it daily, for it is a
legacy without price. A complete register
should be compiled, to facilitate com¬
parative study.
Prehistoric art offers many pointers to
aspects of the life of early African man,
from his physical environment to his lof¬
tiest feelings, and the image is sometimes a
sign as eloquent as writing. The evidence
is, of course, ambiguous, enigmatic and
needs to be supplemented from sources
such as palaeontology, climatology, ar¬
chaeology and oral tradition.

The skills of African wood-carvers
may be seen at their most
outstanding in the images and masks
which were invested with sacred
meanings and used during religious-
mystical ceremonies, dances and
other social functions. Shown here,
two remarkable specimens of the
mask-carver's art (see also Unesco
Courier, May 1977, pages 16-19).
Mask top left was used in ritual
ceremonies of the N'Domo secret
society of the Bambara people of
Mali. Its face and comblike horns are
decorated with cowrie shells. Right,
helmet mask attributed to the Tétela
people of south-central Zaire.
Surmounting it is a kind of crest
consisting of four carved heads (two
of them very small) set back to back
so that the mask looks in four
directions at once. Below, profusely
decorated bronze snail shell from
Igbo Ukwu (Nigeria) dates from the

The cradle
of mankind
by Joseph Ki-Zerbo
ALTHOUGH there cannot be any
absolute certainty in the matter,
if only because the history of
human origins, the hidden history of
mankind, is not yet entirely exhumed,
discoveries so far made point to Africa as
one of the great centres, if not the principal
centre of man's development.-
Kenyapithecus (Kenyapithecus wickeri),
considered by some to be the initiator of
the human dynasty, appeared twelve
million years ago. Ramapithecus of Asia is
but one of its varieties which probably
spread to India from Africa. But
Australopithecus (Australopithecus
africanus or prometheus) is ¡ncontestably
the first hominid, the biped explorer of the
savannahs of eastern and central Africa,
mouldings of whose brain case revealed a
development of the frontal and parietal
lobes of the brain indicative of an already
advanced level of intellectual faculties.
Thereafter came the Zinjanthropes and
the variety bearing the prestigious name of
Homo habilis, all representing a new leap
upward in the progression towards the
status of man. There follow the Archan-
thropes (Pithecanthropes and Atlan-
thropes), and Paleanthropes or Neander-
thalians, and finally the Homo sapiens type
(man of Elmenteita in Kenya, of Kidish in
Ethiopia) of whom many authors have
noted the frequently negroid features in the
upper Aurignacian period.
Whether polycentrist or monocentrist,
every scientist recognizes that it is in Africa
that all the links are found in the chain con¬
necting us with the most ancient hominids
and prehominians, including those varieties
which appear never to have developed
beyond the stage of manlike creatures, and
were unable to make the final step in evolu¬
tion to rise to the stature and status of
Adam. Furthermore, Africa is where the
ancestors, or rather the supposed cousins,
of man are still to be found. According to
W.W. Howells, the "apes of Africa, the
gorilla and chimpanzee, are more closely
related to man than is any of the three to
the orangutang of Indonesia."
And there is good reason why! Asia in its
lower latitudes, and particularly Africa
because of its remarkable extension into
the southern hemisphere, escaped the
discouraging climatic conditions of the nor¬
thern zones. Thus Europe, covered by ice
sheets during the roughly 200,000 years of
the Kageran (a period also known as the
Gunz Glacial Stage), offers no trace of ear¬
ly stone age implements, whereas the same
period in Africa produced three successive
varieties of progressively sophisticated
palaeolithic tools. During that period the
tropical latitudes had the advantage of a
temperate climate that favoured the
development of animal life. Indeed, in order
to survey the influences that led to man's
emergence one must first consider the
geographical and ecological environment.
Thereafter, technology and, finally, social
development must be taken into considera¬
tion.
The capacity to adapt to the environ¬
ment was one of the most powerful factors
affecting Man's development from the time
of his origins. The physical characteristics
of African populations were elaborated
during that crucial period of prehistory.
Thus the glabrous skin, its brown coppery
or black colour, the abundance of sweat-
glands, the expanded nostrils and lips of
many Africans, the curly, crisp or frizzy
hair, all stem from tropical conditions.

Melanin and frizzy hair, for example, pro¬
tect from heat. Moreover, the adoption of
an erect posture, which was such a
decisive step in man's development and
which involved an adjustment of the pelvic
girdle, was provoked, according to certain
prehistorians, by the need to adapt to the
geographical environment of the high
grassest of the savannahs of the East
African plateaux: it was always necessary
to stand erect to see over them to stalk
prey or flee from hostile beasts.
The technological conditions they
created was the second factor that enabled
the African hominians to feel distinct from
the rest of nature and later to dominate it.
It was because he was a faber (artisan)
that man became sapiens (intelligent).
With his hands freed from having to sup¬
port his body man was able to relieve the
muscles and bones of the jaw and cranium
of numerous tasks. This both freed and in¬
creased the size of the brainpan, in which
the motor-sensory centres developed.
After having learnt to hew stone crudely
by breaking it into parts of haphazard sizes
(pebble culture of Olduvai man), prehistoric
African men progressed to a more con¬
scious stage of creation.
From the beginning prehistoric man
made constant progress in the technique of
tool-making; in the changes in the
materials used and in the finish of tools and
weapons can be seen that constant striving
for greater efficiency and for adapting to in¬
creasingly complex ends which is the mark
of intelligence and places man above the
purely instinctive level. This progress,
which is marked by continual exchanges
and borrowings between techniques, takes
on the form of waves of invention which
led up to the period of historical antiquity,
following the mastery of agricultural and
pastoral techniques and the invention of
pottery. The cultivation of wheat, barley
and plants for textiles, such as the flax of
Fayum, became widespread, as did the
raising of domestic animals.
Two principal centres of agricultural
selection and exploitation doubtless ex¬
erted a marked and widespread influence
as early as the sixth or fifth millennium: the
Nile valley and the Niger Bend. Sorghum,
millet, certain varieties of rice, sesame,
fonio, and farther south the yam, the oil
palm and possibly a certain variety of cot¬
ton were domesticated.
In addition, the Nile valley profited by
Mesopotamian discoveries, such as emmer
(wheat), barley, onions, lentils and peas,
and melon and figs, whilst from Asia were
introduced sugar cane, other varieties of
rice, and the banana, the latter doubtless
through Ethiopia. The latter country also
developed the cultivation of coffee.
Numerous plants domesticated during
prehistory still persist, sometimes in im¬
proved forms, as part of African diet to this
day. Their use encouraged the settling and
stabilizing of men, without which there can
be no progress towards civilization. The
true Neolithic, which did not develop in
western Europe till between 3000 and 2000
BC, began three thousand years earlier in
Egypt. Moreover, the pottery of Elmenteita
(Kenya), which probably dates from 5000
BC suggests that knowledge of pottery
reached the Sahara and Egypt from the
uplands of eastern Africa.
The mastery of food production in the
Neolithic must have given rise to a sharp in¬
crease in population which in turn set
migrations into motion; the characteristic
dispersion of certain prehistoric workshops
with stone artefacts of similar style attests
to this. The radius both of forays and of
permanent migrations increased with the
efficiency of implements and weapons,
facilitated by the fact that they were
becoming less unwieldy. Africa is a conti¬
nent where men wandered about in every
direction, as if drawn on by the immense
horizons of that vast land.
The inextricable overlappings which an
African ethnic map presents today is a
jigsaw puzzle that would discourage a
computer and is a result of this complex
movement of peoples over a period of
thousands of years. As far as can be judg¬
ed, the initial migratory impetuses seem to
have come from the Bantu in the east and
north-éast and to have radiated west and
north. Then, from the Neolithic onward,
the general trend seems to have been a
southward movement, as if under the
repellent effect of the giant desert. This
ebb-tide to the south and east (Sudanese,
Bantu, Nilotics and so on) was to continue
during the historical period into the nine¬
teenth century, when its last waves died
away on the coasts of the southern sea.
The final results of these migrations,
prompted by successes (or failures) in the
original environment, were ambiguous. On
the one hand, they assisted progress
because their successive and convergent
waves gradually ensured that the conti¬
nent, if not mastered, was occupied, and
through the exchanges they involved, they
gave rise to numerous innovations which
were cumulative in effect. But on the other
hand, the migrations, by diluting the
population over an enormous space,
prevented human groups- from reaching
that threshold of concentration which
human multitudes must achieve to surpass
themselves in invention in order to survive.
Dispersion over a wide geographic range
increases the ascendancy of the environ¬
ment, and it tended to pull back the first
African clans to those dark origins whence
man painfully struggled to maturity
through the opaque crust of the unfeeling
universe.
If the beginning of history is dated from
the use of iron objects, it can be said that
prehistory continued in a number of
African regions until around the year 1000.
As late as the nineteenth century, the pro¬
ductive forces and socio-economic rela¬
tions of numerous African groups (and not
only the palaeo-negritic groups) were
substantially no different from those of
prehistory, save for the use of metal im¬
plements. Even in our own century, the
hunting techniques of the pygmies are the
same as those of prehistoric. Africans of
thousand of years ago.
Obscured perhaps by the dazzling sum
mit of Egyptian civilization and the glorious
achievements of so many African
kingdoms and empires, that weighty reality
remains, giving body and texture to the
development of African societies, and
deserving to be dwelt on here.
So it is that in primitive communities,
contrary to European experience (ancient
and Germanic), where the private owner¬
ship of land developed from its common
ownership, in Africa there is no sign of
private ownership. In African village com¬
munities, the higher authority, the State,
was no more the owner of the land than
were private individuals. Moreover, the
State generally did not undertake any ma¬
jor projects.
In spite of instances of sanguinary
autocracy, the State authority in black
Africa nearly always took the form of a
limited monarchy within a framework of
corporate bodies and customs, veritable
unwritten constitutions, institutions most
often inherited from an earlier organization
or social stratification.
Even when prestigious and efficient
States such as the Empire of Mali, describ¬
ed with admiration by Ibn Battuta in the
fourteenth century, spread over immense
territories, their decentralization, adopted
as a deliberate choice, allowed the basic
communities to function with a very real
measure of autonomy. In any event, since
writing was generally little used and tech¬
niques of travel were still not very well
developed, the sway of the capitals was
always mitigated by distance. Distance also
rendered very real the constant threat that
subject peoples would evade any attempt
at autocracy by running away.
Moreover, production surplus to the
needs of the basic communities appears to
have been modest in Africa, save where
there was a State monopoly of precious
commodities such as gold, in Ghana or
Ashanti, ivory and salt. But even in such
cases, the counterpart services (security,
justice, markets) provided by the chieftain¬
cy must not be overlooked, nor the fact
minimized that a good proportion of the
taxes and levies was redistributed at the
customary festivals, in accordance with the
code of honour governing those obliged to
live nobly. This explains the lavish
generosity of Kanku Musa the Magnificent,
Emperor of Mali, at the time of his sump¬
tuous pilgrimage in 1324 (see article page
60).
As for production based on slavery, did it
exist in Africa? In almost all the societies
south of the Sahara, slavery played only a
marginal role. Slaves, or more precisely
captives, were nearly always prisoners of
war. However, captivity did not reduce a
man to the state of chattel, of property
pure and simple. The African slave often
enjoyed property rights. He was not ex¬
ploited like an instrument or an animal. In
Ashanti, to ensure national integration, it
was strictly forbidden even to allude to the
servile origin of anyone, and so a former
captive might become a village chief. "The
condition of captive, although common in
Africa... did not imply the restricted role in
production that characterizes a social
class."

Homohabilis 2,500,000
Recent discoveries in East Africa of
primitive stone tools have pushed back the
estimated emergence of Homo habilis to
around 2,500,000 years ago. If the period
of prehistory is taken as being equivalent
to twenty-four hours, the whole of
historical time (about 5,000 years) would
represent just under three minutes.
massive and qualitatively different
character, as in Dahomey, Ashanti and
Zanzibar in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the social structures involved
stem from an already dominant mode of
production, which was capitalism, and
were in reality the result of external
economic influences.
Finally, one must take into account the
socio-economic structures such as the
matrilineal family system which originally
so strongly characterized African societies,
at least before later influences like Islam or
Western civilization gradually introduced
the patrilineal system. This social structure,
so important in defining the prominent role
of women in the community, also had
economic, political and spiritual conse¬
quences, since it played a remarkable role
in the inheritance both of material wealth
and of the rights to royal succession, as in
Ghana. Uterine kinship appears to have
come from the depths of African
prehistory, at the time when permanent
settlement during the Neolithic exalted the
domestic functions of women, to the point
where they became the central element in a
social entity.
Given these conditions, how then can
the characteristic evolution of prehistoric
African societies be described? The first
thing to note is that, during this period,
Africa served in intercontinental relations
as a pole and a central source for the inven¬
tion and dissemination of techniques. But a
subordinate and peripheral status rather
quickly followed that exalted role, not only
because of the conflict of internal factors
mentioned above, but also because of the
tapping of African resources and services
without any adequate counterpart, in the
form, for example, of an equivalent transfer
of capital and techniques.
This exploitation of Africa lasted several
thousand years and had three peak
periods. First, in Antiquity, following the
decline of Egypt, the Nile Valley and the
other Roman provinces in North Africa
were exploited to become the granary of
Rome. In addition to food, Africa supplied
the Roman Empire with an enormous
quantity of imports, including wild animals,
slaves and gladiators.
In the sixteenth century the sinister era
of the slave trade began. Finally, in the
nineteenth century, dependence took the
form of territorial occupation and coloniza¬
tion. The simultaneous and complementary
phenomena of capital accumulation in
Europe and the rise of the industrial revolu¬
tion could not be conceived of without the
enforced contributions of Asia, the
Americas and especially Africa.
Parallel to these phenomena, even dur¬
ing the centuries when external rapacity '
was not too pronounced (from Antiquity to
the sixteenth century), many internal con¬
tradictions in the African system itself con¬
stituted home-bred structural handicaps,
which prevented any moves from within
the societies towards more progressive
structures.
The Africa of clans and villages which
was still in existence, was little given to
private possession of land (a common asset
as widespread and as precious, but also as
free, as air), and was for a very long time
ignorant of the acquisition of land as a
source of conflicts between social groups.
But that was not the only archaic social
form found in Africa. The vicious circle of
low-level techniques and production was at
once the cause and the consequence of a
dwindling population within a continental
space that was virtually unlimited.
Natural obstacles impeded long-range
commercial traffic which, as a result, never
became widespread and too often concer¬
ned luxury products usually destined for
the palaces. But it should be noted that,
wherever barriers to trade were overcome
either wholly or in part, as in the Nile Valley
and, to a lesser degree, in the Niger Valley,
social development blossomed as a conse¬
quence of an increase in population and
private ownership.
Thus, in black Africa, apart from a few
exceptions, there was neither slavery nor
feudalism as they are understood in the
West. One cannot even say that there were
African variations of these systems as their
characteristic elements were missing.
In short, Africa presents a remarkably
continuous indigenous mode of production
similar to other "primitive" communities
but with fundamental differences, in. parti¬
cular its avoidance of private or State
ownership.
Then there was a gradual and sporadic
transition toward State forms, themselves
long immersed in the network of
underlying pre-State relations, but gra¬
dually extricating themselves by internal
impetus and external pressure from the
matrix of destructurized primitive collecti¬
vism, and restructuring themselves on the
basis of private property and the growth of
the State, in a capitalist mode of produc¬
tion, first dominant, then monopolistic.
The colonial State was in fact created to
administer capitalist commercial agencies,
before giving way in the middle of the
twentieth century to an independent capi¬
talist State. Alternatively, the transition
was from a dominant community to a
dominant colonial capitalism, and thereaf¬
ter to a socialist type of development.
In any case, one fact in Africa compels
recognition: since the structure of society
has not changed for at least five hundred
years, and in spite of an increase in popula¬
tion, the productive forces have stagnated,
though not to the exclusion of sporadic
localized growths which usually failed to
flourish. This stagnation does not exclude
the extraordinary blossoming of art, nor
the refinement of personal relations. It is as
if the Africans devoted the essence of their
creative energy to these domains.
The more productive forces increase, the
more antagonisms sharpen the edge of
interested motives and the will to power.
The liberation struggles which today are
still raging in certain territories of Africa are
both the indicator and the negation of the
attempt to domesticate the continent
within a system that might be called the
African mode of under-production.
In Africa, the creation, the self-creation
of Man which began thousands of millen¬
nia ago still continues.

Africa's overlapping
time spans
The chronology of technical development
on the immense African continent has
differed widely from region to region.
Whereas iron working, for example. Is
now known to have been practised In
some parts of Africa in the first century
BC, In others iron objects only began to
be used around 1000 AD. Rock paintings
in the prehistoric tradition were still being
made in the 19th century, yet as early as
the first half of the 16th century artists of
the ancient kingdom of Benin were
producing exquisite bronzes using the
sophisticated "lost wax" technique.

Cultivated by the ancient Egyptians of the Nile Delta region, the papyrus reed was an
important and versatile raw material. Its fibres were used not only to produce an early
form of paper, but also in the manufacture of sails, cloth, mats, rope and sandals.
Bundles of papyrus stems formed the supports of mud and wattle dwellings or protected
the corners of mud-brick buildings. When construction in stone began, builders imitated
the appearance of the papyrus bundles and palm-tree trunks and branches used In
primitive buildings, as in these columns of the temple of Isis at Philae (above)) These
plant motifs were also found in many objects in everyday use, such as this princely mirror
handle in the shape of a papyrus umbel embellished with gold and turquoise (left).



Inventors and technologists
of pharaonic Egypt
by Rashid el-Nadoury with the collaboration of Jean Vercoutter
RASHID EL-NADOURY, of Egypt, is professor
of ancient history and vice-dean of the Faculty
of Arts of the University of Alexandria. A
specialist in prehistoric and protohistoric com¬
munities of the Nile valley and north Africa, he is
the author ofmanypublished works including an
Ancient History of the Maghreb.
JEAN VERCOUTTER, of France, is director of
the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology
(Cairo) and a specialist in the ancient history and
archaeology of the Nile valley.
PHARAONIC civilization was remar¬
kable for the continuity of its deve¬
lopment. To succeeding civiliza¬
tions of Africa in particular, it bequeathed a
legacy whose importance should not be
underestimated. It inherited from Neolithic
times techniques which were transmitted
and enriched in the pre-dynastic period
. (3500 to 3000 BC) and were subsequently
preserved when the historical period was in
full flower.
In the crafts, the ancient Egyptians' con¬
tribution can be traced in stone, but also in
wood, glass, and many other materials.
As early as 3500 BC, the Egyptians, the
heirs to the Neolithic period in the Nile
valley, used the flint deposits there,
especially those at Thebes, to carve in¬
struments of incomparable quality, of
which the Gebel-el-Arak Knife is one exam¬
ple among hundreds.
This craftsmanship is also found in the
carving of stone vases. Here, too, the
technique of the Neolithic period carried on
through the pre-dynastic period and the
Old Kingdom and continued to the end of
ancient Egyptian history. The Egyptian
stone-carver used every kind of stone, even
the hardest varieties, working with basalt,
breccia, diorite, granite, porphyry as readily
as with the softer calcareous alabasters,
schists, serpentines and soapstones.
47

, From Egypt, stone-carving techniques
later passed to the Mediterranean world.
The carvers of Cretan vases must surely
have learned their skills, if not in Egypt
itself, at least in a milieu that was
thoroughly steeped in Egyptian culture like
the Syro-Palestinian Corridor. Even the
shapes of the vases of the ancient Minoan
period betray their Egyptian origins.
The dexterity of the cutters of hard
stones passed to the sculptors. This can be
quality of the goods produced by Egyptian
weavers. Here we have a graphic example
of one of the ways in which the Egyptian
legacy was handed down.
Egypt contributed, if not the invention,
at least the distribution of glass-making
techniques to world civilization. While it is
true that Mesopotamia and the civilizations
of the Indus were likewise familiar at a very
early time with glazing, the technique
which is the basis of glass making, there is
moulded in coloured glass, were set in
wood or stone to make inscriptions. The
techniques of the Pharaonic glass makers
were handed down to craftsmen of the
Hellenistic period who invented blown
glass.
Alexandria then became the main centre
for the manufacture of glassware, export¬
ing its products as far as China. Aurelius
levied a tax on Egyptian glassware im¬
ported into Rome. The Meroitic empire
later imported some glassware from Alex-
The common unit of
measure in Egypt was the
cubit, a measure based on
the length of the forearm
from the elbow to the tip of
the middle finger. The
standard rule of Egyptian
craftsmen was made of
wood and had a bevelled
edge; It measured a "short
cubit", standardized at
450 mm. The "royal cubit"
had a length of 525 mm.

glazed paste, carved in the
form of a human hand

traces of red paint of the

craftsmen to indicate
alignments and levels during
construction of a building or

layout of wall decorations.

seen in the great Egyptian hard stone
sculptures, from the diorite Chefren of
Cairo to the large black basalt sarcophagi
of the Apis bulls. The skill then passed to
the sculptors of the Ptolemaic period and
later found expression in the statuary of the
Roman empire.
The cultivation of flax rapidly led to great
ability in hand-spinning and linen making.
The latter was known from the start of the
Neolithic period and its beginning coincid¬
ed with the emergence of civilization in the
Nile valley. The women spun the linen, do¬
ing so with great skill since they frequently
handled two spindles simultaneously.
For the Pharaohs, woven fabrics con¬
stituted a commodity particularly ap¬
preciated abroad. The finest cloth of all,
byssus, was woven in the temples and was
especially renowned. The Ptolemies super¬
vised the weaving shops and controlled the
quality of the manufacture, and their cen¬
tral administration, doubtless following the
pattern set by the earlier Pharaohs,
organized sales abroad which brought the
king huge revenues because of the superior
no evidence to suggest that they spread it
abroad.
It is certain that the Egyptians
demonstrated their aptitude in the art of
glass making in a relatively short time. The
presence of glass beads seems to be at¬
tested in the pre-dynastic period, although
it is not certain that they were deliberately
made by the craftsman.
Glass, as such, was known in the fifth
dynasty (c. 2500 BC) and began to spread
from the time of the New Kingdom (c.
1600). It was then used not only for beads
but also for vases in the form of fishes.
They were usually polychromatic and
always opaque.
Transparent glass made its appearance
under Tutankhamen (c. 1300 BC). Starting
about 700 BC, Egyptian polychromatic
glass vases, in the form called alabaster,
spread throughout the Mediterranean area.
They were copied by the Phoenicians, who
developed their manufacture into an in¬
dustry.
In the later period, hieroglyphic signs.
andria but, above all, adopted its manufac¬
turing techniques and spread them to the
upper Nile valley.
One of the most important industries
was that of the production of papyrus in¬
vented by the ancient Egyptians. No plant
played a more significant role in Egypt than
papyrus. Its fibres were used for boat mak¬
ing and for caulking, for the wicks of oil
lamps, for mats, baskets, ropes and
hawsers.
The hawsers which served to moor the
pontoon bridge that Xerxes tried to lay
across the Hellespont were made in Egypt
out of papyrus fibres. When tied together
in bundles, papyrus stems served as pillars
in early architecture until classical ar¬
chitects took them as a model for their sim¬

were shaped like closed or open flowers.

successive layers of fine strips taken from
the stem of the plant which, after pressing
and drying, formed a large sheet.
Twenty sheets of papyrus joined
together while they were still moist formed
a scroll three to six metres in length.
Several scrolls could be joined together and
reach a length of thirty or forty metres.
It was scrolls of this kind that constituted
Egyptian books. They were held in the left
hand and unrolled as the reading proceed¬
ed. The volumen of classical antiquity is a
direct heir of this scroll.
Of all the writing materials employed in
antiquity, papyrus was certainly the most
practical. It was supple and light. Its sole
drawback was its fragility. Over a long
period it stood up poorly to humidity, and it
burnt very easily. It has been estimated that
to maintain the inventory of a small Egyp¬
tian temple, ten metres of papyrus were re¬
quired each month.
Provincial notaries, during the Ptolemaic
dynasty, used from six to thirteen scrolls or
from twenty-five to fifty-seven metres each
day.
Every large estate and royal palace and
all the temples maintained registers, inven¬
tories and libraries, which indicates that
hundreds of kilometres of papyrus must
have existed at that time whereas only a
few hundred metres have been
rediscovered.
The papyrus used in Egypt from the time
of the first dynasty (c. 3000 BC) until the
end of the Pharaonic period was later
adopted by the Greeks, the Romans, the
Copts, the Byzantines, the Aramaeans and
the Arabs.
A large part of Greek and Latin literature
has come down to us on papyrus. Papyrus
was, unquestionably, one of the major
legacies bequeathed to civilization by
Pharaonic Egypt.
The Egyptian expertise in wood working
is brilliantly manifested in their ship¬
building. The necessities of daily life in the
Nile valley, where the river is the only con
venient thoroughfare, made expert
boatmen of the Egyptians from the earliest
times.
In 1952, two great pits dug into the rock
and covered with huge limestone slabs
were discovered along the southern side of
the Great Pyramid. In the pits, partially
disassembled, but complete with oars,
cabins, and rudders, were discovered the
very boats used by the Pharaoh Cheops.
One of these boats has been removed from
the pit and restored. The other one is still
waiting to be taken out of its tomb.
Cheops' boat, now in a special museum,
has been rebuilt. When found it consisted
of 1,224 pieces of wood which had been
partially disassembled and stacked in thir¬
teen successive layers in the pit. The boat
measures 43.4 metres long, 5.9 metres
wide, and has a capacity of about forty
tons. The side planks are between thirteen
and fourteen centimetres thick. Cheops'
boat has no keel, and is flat bottomed and
narrow. The most remarkable fact is that it k
was built without any nails: the pieces of f

As long ago as 2500 BC, Egyptian physicians were famous for their ability to diagnose and
treat hundreds of diseases and to perform many kinds of operations. They could, for
example, reduce and set fractures using strips of linen soaked in resin or asphalt (photo
above left) and understood the nature and causes of hernia, from which the bearded
harvester (top photo) clearly suffered. Above right, detail from a bas-relief at the Temple
of Kom Ombo in Upper Egypt is thought by scholars to represent surgical instruments
used sometime during the Ptolemaic dynasty (323-30 BC).
¡^ wood are held together solely by the use of
tenon and mortise joints.
Beginning with the fifth dynasty, and
probably even before, the Egyptians knew
how to adapt their ships for ocean-going
voyages. The boats of Sahure show that
for use at sea the height of the prow and
the poop were greatly reduced.
In Cheops' boat, these were raised high
above the waterline. This made the ship
difficult to manage in the waves of the
Mediterranean or the Red Sea. In addition,
Egyptian naval engineers lent great solidity
to the whole structure by equipping the
ship with a torsion-cable passing over the
bridge and tying the stern firmly to the
bow. This cable also acted as à keel, ensur-
. ing the rigidity of the entire structure and
reducing the danger of its breaking in the
middle.
50
With these modifications, the Egyptian
ship was capable of plying the furthest
maritime routes opened up by the
Pharaohs, whether on the Mediterranean in
the direction of Palestine, Syria, Cyprus
and Crete, or on the Red Sea towards the
distant country of Punt.
The Pharaonic contribution to science
and applied mathematics has left a valuable
legacy.
It was, undoubtedly, the knowledge they
acquired from mummification that enabled
the Egyptians to develop surgical tech¬
niques at a very early period in their history.
We have quite a good knowledge of Egyp¬
tian surgery, in fact, thanks to the Smith
Papyrus, a copy of an original which was
composed under the Old Kingdom, bet¬
ween 2600 and 2400 BC. This papyrus is
virtually a treatise on bone surgery and ex
ternal pathology. Forty-eight cases are ex¬
amined systematically.
Several of the treatments indicated in the
Smith Papyrus are still used today. Egyp¬
tian surgeons knew how to stitch up
wounds and to set a fracture using wooden
or pasteboard splints. And there were
times when the surgeon simply advised
that nature should be allowed to take its
own course.
Of the cases studied by the Smith
Papyrus, the majority concerned superficial
lacerations of the skull or face. Others con¬
cerned lesions of the bones or joints such
as contusions of the cervical or spina!
vertebrae, dislocations, perforations of the
skull or sternum, and sundry fractures af¬
fecting the nose, jaw, collar-bone,
humerus, ribs, skull and vertebrae.
Examination of mummies has revealed
traces of surgery, such as the jaw dating
from the Old Kingdom which has two holes
bored to drain an abscess, or the skull frac¬
tured by a blow from an axe or sword and
successfully reset. There is also evidence of
dental work such as fillings done with a
mineral cement, and one mummy had a
kind of bridge of gold wire joining two
shaky teeth.
By its methodical approach, the Smith
Papyrus bears testimony to the skill of the
surgeons of ancient Egypt, skill which it
would be fair to assume was handed on
gradually, in Africa as well as in Asia and to
classical antiquity, by the doctors who
were always attached to Egyptian expedi¬
tions to foreign lands.
Moreover, it is known that foreign
sovereigns, like the Asian prince of
Bakhtan, Bactria, or Cambyses himself,
brought in Egyptian doctors, that Hip¬
pocrates "had access to the library of the
Imhotep temple at Memphis" and that
other Greek physicians later followed his
example.
Medical knowledge can be considered as
one of the most important early scientific
contributions of the ancient Egyptians to
the history of man. Documents show in
detail the titles of Egyptian physicians and
their different fields of specialization. In
fact the civilizations of the ancient Near
East and the classical world recognized the
ability and reputation of the ancient Egyp¬
tians in medicine and pharmacology.
Among the ailments identified and com¬
petently described and treated by Egyptian
doctors were gastric disorders, stomach
swelling, skin cancer, coryza, laryngitis,
angina pectoris, diabetes, constipation,
haemorrhoids, bronchitis, retention and in¬
continence of urine, Bilharzia and
ophthalmia.
The Egyptian doctor treated his patient
using suppositories, ointments, syrups, po¬
tions, oils, massages, enemas, purges,
poultices, and even inhalants whose use
the Egyptians taught to the Greeks. The
Egyptian pharmacopoeia contained a large
variety of medicinal herbs, the names of
which, unfortunately, elude translation.
Egyptian medicinal techniques and
medicines enjoyed great prestige in antiqui¬
ty, as we know from Herodotus.
The Greek writers Herodotus and Strabo
concur in the view that geometry was in-

vented by the Egyptians. The need to
calculate the area of the land eroded or ad¬
ded each year by the flooding of the Nile
apparently led them to its discovery.
Egyptian geometry, like mathematics,
was empirical. In ancient treatises, the task
was first and foremost to provide the scribe
with a formula that would enable him to
find rapidly the area of a field, the volume
of grain in a silo or the number of bricks re¬
quired for a building project. The scribe
never applied abstract reasoning to the
solution of a particular problem but just
provided the practical means in the shape
of figures.
Nonetheless, the Egyptians knew
perfectly well how to calculate the area of a
triangle or a circle, the volume of a
cylinder, of a pyramid or a truncated
pyramid, and probably that of a
hemisphere. Their greatest success was
the calculation of the area of a circle. They
proceeded by reducing the diameter by
one-ninth and squaring the result which
was equivalent to assigning a value of
3.1605 to TZ , which is much more precise
Few traces remain of the ordinary houses of the ancient Egyptians, yet
archaeological excavations, plans, documents and archives that have survived
bear witness to the skills of ancient Egyptian architects and town-planners.
(1) Plan of the remains of the city of Kahun, built during the reign of Sesostris
II (1897-1878 BC) in the present-day region of al-Fayyum, reveals the existence
of five types of houses designed for the different social categories notables,
scribes, office-workers, artisans and workmen. The houses of the notables were
located on the northern edge of the city while the humbler dwellings formed the
workmen's quarter to the west. The house marked "Acropolis" on the plan was
probably used by Sesostris himself. Despite their size they had seventy or more
rooms and antechambers the notables' houses were built In the same style as
the smaller (two to nine rooms) dwellings (see [2] detail to right of plan). (3) This
"soul house", a pottery model placed in a tomb as a symbolic dwelling for the
soul, was found in an 18th dynasty (1567-1320) tomb and represents a country
house. Unlike the average town house it has windows on all sides and a roof
terrace accessible by means of an interior staircase. Photo (4) Cross-sectional
painting from an 18th dynasty tomb of an elegant Theban town house. The
principal rooms have a higher ceiling than the others and receive light and
ventilation from small windows placed just below ceiling height. An additional
refinement is the air space between the ceiling and the upper floor. The ground
floor seems to house the domestic services whilst on the roof terraces are to be
seen the customary grain storage silos.

than the value 3 given to 71 by other an¬
cient peoples.
The Egyptian contribution to astronomy
must be deduced from practical applica¬
tions made on the basis of observations.
This contribution is however far from in¬
significant.
The Egyptian calendar year was divided
into three seasons of four months, each
having thirty days; to these 360 days, five
were added at the end of the year. The
365-day calendar year, the most accurate
known in antiquity, is at the origin of our
own calendar year inasmuch as it served as
the basis of the Julian reform (47 BC) and
of the Gregorian reform of 1582. Side by
side with this civil calendar, the Egyptians
also used a religious, lunar calendar and
were able to predict the moon's phases
with adequate accuracy.
Ever since the Napoleonic expedition to
Egypt, Europeans have been struck by the
accuracy of the alignment of structures
built at the time of the Pharaohs, particular¬
ly the pyramids, the four façades of which
face the four cardinal points. The Great
Pyramids deviate from true North by less
than one degree. Such accuracy could
have been achieved only by astronomical
observation.
The ancient Egyptians applied their
mathematical knowledge to the extraction,
transportation and positioning of the huge
blocks of stone used in their architectural
projects. Their tradition of using mud-
bricks and various kinds of stone went back
to very early times. They first used heavy
granite during the beginning of the third
millennium before our era. It was used for
the flooring of tombs belonging to the first
dynasty at Abydos. During the second
dynasty they used limestone in construc¬
ting the walls of tombs.
A new phase began during the third
dynasty. This was a vital development in
the history of Egyptian architecture, for if
was the construction of the first complete
building in stone. This is the step pyramid
at Saqqarah, which forms a part of the
huge funerary complex of King Zoser.
Imhotep, who was probably the vizier of
King Zoser (c. 2580 BC), was the architect
who built the ensemble containing the step
pyramid where hewn stone was used for
the first time. The blocks were small and
looked very much like a limestone imitation
of the sun-dried brick used earlier in
funerary architecture. Similarly, the imbed¬
ded columns and the ceiling joists were
stone copies of the bundles of plants and
beams used in earlier construction. Thus,
there is every indication that Egyptian ar¬
chitecture was amongst the first to use
hewn stone in coursed work.
Until the Roman conquest, civil architec¬
ture continued to use sun-dried bricks even
in the building of royal palaces. The out¬
buildings of Ramses in Thebes and the
great Nubian fortresses provide a very
good idea of the versatility of this material.
It could be used with the utmost refine¬
ment, as can be seen from the Palace of
Amenhotep IV at Tell el-Amarna with its
pavements and ceilings decorated with
paintings.
Another contribution in the field of ar
chitecture was the creation of the column.
This was at first attached to the wall but
later became free-standing.
In developing this architectural skill the
ancient Egyptian was much influenced by
the local environment. For example, in ar¬
riving at the idea of a column, he was in¬
spired by his observation of wild plants
such as reeds and papyrus.
He cut the capitals of the columns into
the shape of lotus flowers, papyrus and
other plants, and this was another architec¬
tural innovation. The lotus papyrus palm
and fluted columns of ancient Egypt were
adopted in the architecture of other
cultures.
The technical knowledge acquired by the
Egyptians in construction and irrigation as
the result of digging canals and building
dikes or dams manifested itself in other
fields allied to architecture.
By 2550 BC, they had sufficient skill to
build a dam of hewn stone in a wadi near
Cairo. Somewhat later, their engineers cut
navigable channels in the rocks of the First
Cataract at Aswan. By all evidence,
towards 1740 BC, they seem to have suc¬
ceeded in erecting a barrage on the Nile
itself at Semna, in Nubia, to facilitate
navigation to the south. And finally, during
the same period, they built a ramp parallel
to the Second Cataract, over which they
slid their boats on the fluid mud of the Nile.
The ramp extended over several
kilometres, a predecessor of the Greek
Diolkos of the Isthmus of Corinth, and en¬
sured that the rapids of the Second
Cataract never hindered navigation.
Cultural ties linking Egypt with the
African interior existed during the earliest
stages of prehistory as well as in historical
times. Egyptian civilization under the
Pharaohs permeated the neighbouring
African cultures.
Comparative studies prove the existence
of common cultural elements between
black Africa and Egypt, such as the rela¬
tionship between royalty and natural
forces. This is clear from archaeological fin¬
dings in the former territory of the land of
Kush: royal pyramids were built in El-
Kurru, Nuri, Gebel Barkal and Meroe. They
bear witness to the significance of Egyptian
influence in Africa.
Unfortunately, our ignorance of the
Meroitic language, and of the extent of the
Meroitic empire, prevents us from judging
the impact it had on the cultures of ancient
Africa as a whole to the east, west and
south of the Meroitic empire.

The ancient Egyptians developed the carving of hard stone to
a fine art as witness the detailed perfection of this
mythological scene incised on the lid of a priest's
sarcophagus found at Saqqarah, near ancient Memphis, and
dating probably from the 30th dynasty (380-343 BC). The
arched body of the sky goddess Nut forms the vault of the
sky. Within the inner circle can be seen the prostrate body of
Shu, the god of light and air and supporter of the sky.
Bordering this inner circle are the banners of the forty nomas
or provinces of Egypt. Within the larger circle, on either side,
stand the goddesses of East and West. Between their
extended arms, on which sail the ships of day and night,
passes the winged disc of the sun which is swallowed each
night by the goddess Nut to be reborn each morning.

After the sack of Napata by the
Egyptian pharaoh. Psamtik II, in about
590 BC, the capital of the empire of
Kush was transferred further south to
Meroe, near the sixth cataract.
Above, granite statue, over three
metres high, of Aspalta (593-568 BC),

geological conditions Meroe became
a prosperous agricultural, mining and
trading centre.



The Empire
of Kush
An original civilization
which flourished for a thousand years
in ancient Nubia
by Jean Leclant
THOUGH today the region is ex¬
tremely isolated behind a barrier of
deserts and the difficult hurdles of
the Second, Third and Fourth Cataracts of
the Nile, Dongola and the adjacent basins
of the Middle Nile were formerly the centre
of rich and powerful political structures. In
the first half of the second millennium the
so-called Kerma culture marked a rich and
prosperous kingdom, the Kush of the
Egyptian records.
The extremely patchy archaeological
prospection of this still little-known zone is
quite inadequate for fixing the history of
this sector after the brilliant but relatively
short phase of Egyptian domination under
the New Empire (1580 to 1085 BC). For
nearly three centuries, the link between
Africa and the Mediterranean world seems
to be broken and almost total silence
blankets Nubia. But from the end of the
ninth century BC we get a re-awakening:
excavation of the Kurru necropolis near
Napata below the Fourth Cataract revealed
the tombs of a succession of princes.
These were the royal ancestors of the
line which effected the union of Egypt and
the Sudan, known as the twenty-fifth or
"Ethiopian" dynasty of Egypt.
With the illustrious monarch Peye, we
enter the mainstream of history. One of the
inscriptions which he caused to be carved
at Napata is now preserved in the Cairo
Museum and is one of the longest and
most detailed texts of ancient Egypt. On
front, back and sides are 159 lines of
hieroglyphs describing the deliberations of
king in his palace and the phases of his
campaign against the Libyan princes who
were masters of Middle Egypt and the
Delta.
Towards 713 BC, Shabaka, brother of
Peye, ascended the throne. He brought the
entire Nile valley as far as the Delta under
the empire of Kush. The international
JEAN LECLANT, of France, is a professor at
the Sorbonne and director of studies at the
Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris. An
egyptologist, he specializes in Nubian studies
and Ethiopian archaeology. His publications
include Dans les Pas des Pharaons (In the Steps
of the Pharaohs) and Recherches sur les
Monuments Thébains de la 25* Dynasty
(Research on Theban Monuments of the 25th
Dynasty).
politics of the Middle East drew the
Kushites towards Asia where Assyrian
pressure was beginning to make itself felt.
But to begin with, Shabaka seems to have
preserved good relations with Assyria. In
the Sudan and Egypt, he launched a policy
of monument building which was expand¬
ed under his successors, the two sons of
Peye, first Shabataka (700 to 690 BC), and
then the glorious Taharqa (690 to 664 BC).
Taharqa's name is found on numerous
monuments throughout the whole length
of the valley. He built his sanctuaries at the
foot of the holy mountain of Gebel Barkal,
a kind of sandstone table formation which
dominates the large fertile basin of Napata.
Taharqa had accepted the challenge of
war with the Assyrians. His name looms
large in the Bible where the terror caused
by the black warriors of the land of Kush is
evident. Assarhaddon failed in his attempt
to invade Egypt and it was his successor
Assurbanipal who, at the head of an ex¬
tremely strong army, captured and sacked
Thebes in 663 BC. The Kushites withdrew
southward and their dynasty in Egypt came
to an end.
We shall do well to pause over this fifty-
year period during which Egypt and the
Sudan combined as a great African
power. The Kushite kingdom presents
itself as a twin monarchy; its symbol is the
double Uraeus, the two snakes which rise
above the forehead of the Pharaoh and
protect him. In their general style, their
clothing and their attitudes the sovereigns
of the twenty-fifth dynasty copy the
Pharaohs of Egypt who preceded them and
whose successors, if not descendants,
they claim to be.
The style of their monuments is typically
Pharaonic. The inscriptions are Egyptian,
recalling the pure classical tradition. But
the faces portrayed on reliefs and statues
show marked cheekbones, heavy chins and
thick lips. They also wear ornaments
characteristic of the Sudan. A popular
headdress is a kind of close cap fitting
tightly to the neck with a sidepiece protec¬
ting the temple; a thick knotted head-band
holds It in place leaving two streamers w
hanging behind the shoulders. Earrings and Y
55

r, the pendants of necklaces are adorned with
rams' heads, the ram being the sacred
animal of Amon.
After the retreat of the Kushites from
Egypt under the assaults of Assyrians, their
history is much more difficult to determine.
For a millennium a State survived, becom¬
ing ever more African, the kingdom of
Kush, the name of its own choice from the
ancient native name for the territory.
To begin with the capital remained at
Napata, at the foot of the sacred mountain,
Gebel Barkal. Later, almost certainly in the
sixth century BC, it was transferred much
further south to Meroe near the Sixth
Cataract.
A possible explanation for the transfer of
the capital may have been climatic and
economic considerations. At Meroe the
steppes were much more extensive than in
the basins around Napata, hemmed in by
deserts. Agriculture was practised as well
as livestock raising, cultivation being
perfectly possible in this zone of summer
rainfall. Enormous irrigation basins (hafirs)
were dug out adjacent to the principal
sites. Commerce must have been brisk, as
Meroe was an ideal entrepot for the
caravan routes between the Red Sea, the
upper Nile and Chad.
With Queen Shanakdakhete (around 170
to 160 BC) we appear to get the accession
to full power of a typically local matriarchy.
It is on an edifice in her name at Naga that
we find inscriptions engraved in Meroitic
hieroglyphs which are among the most an¬
cient known.
These hieroglyphs are borrowed from
Egyptian but differ in their values. They are
written and read in the opposite way to the
Egyptian ones; this "may attest a deliberate
desire to be different. With these
hieroglyphs there goes a cursive form of
writing often abbreviated; the signs seem
to be derived in part from the demotic
writing used in Egypt at that period for ad¬
ministrative and private documents.
Whatever the case may be, the Meroitic
language, whose nature is still not known,
and the graphic system are completely dif¬
ferent from the Egyptian.
Thereafter a preponderant place falls to
two queens, Amanirenas and Amani-
shakheto. Their husbands remain forgotten
and we do not even know the name of
Amanishakheto's. The throne was also oc¬
cupied for some years by a king, the former
prince Akinidad, son of Queen Amanirenas
and King Teriteqas. Nevertheless it is im¬
portant which of these two queens or
"Candaces" came first (the word Candace
is the transcription of the Meroitic title
Kdke according to the tradition of the
classical authors).
One of the two queens had dealings with
Augustus in a famous episode, one of the
rare occasions when Meroe appears on the
stage of universal history. Following the
sack of Aswan by the Meroites (which was
probably when the statue of Augustus was
captured, the head of which has been
discovered buried under the threshold of
one of the palaces of Meroe), the prefect of
Roman Egypt, Petronius, mounted a
punitive expedition and captured Napata in
23 BC.
A permanent garrison was established by
the Romans at Primis (Qasr Ibrim), which
held off the Meroites. In 21 or 20 BC a
peace treaty was negotiated at Samos,
where Augustus was staying at the time.
The Roman garrison appears to have been
withdrawn; the exaction of a tribute from
the Meroites was renounced and the fron¬
tier between the Roman and Meroitic em¬
pires was fixed at Hierasykaminos (Mahar¬
raqa).
This period around the start of the Chris¬
tian era is one of the peaks of Meroitic
civilization, as a number of buildings attest.
The names of Akinidad and of the Queen
Amanishakheto are inscribed in Temple T
at Kawa, and a palace discovered in the last
few years at Oüad ben Naga close by the
river has been attributed to the queen. Her
fine tomb is still to be seen in the Northern
Cemetery of Meroe. The pyramid, with the
traditional eastern approach of pylon and
chapel, is one of the most imposing in the
old city.
Natekamani, son-in-law and successor
of Amanishakheto, and his wife. Queen
Amanitere (12 BC to AD 12) were also
great builders, and their names are in¬
disputably those recurring most frequently
on the Kushite monuments. Throughout
the major cities of the empire, these
monuments speak of the power of a dynas¬
ty at its apogee. The royal couple also put
in hand the restoration of Napata,
devastated by Petronius' expedition, and in
particular of the temple of Amon. They
devoted particular attention to Naga, the
great centre of the steppe-country south of
Meroe: the frontal approach to the temple
of Amon became a pylon whose decoration
combines Egyptian influences and purely
Meroitic features, while the most famous
building is the Naga lion temple whose
reliefs are among the most representative
examples of Meroitic art.
We know very little of the last centuries
of Meroe. The indigenous component in

the culture becomes more and more impor¬
tant. The control of the caravan routes bet¬
ween the Nile valley, the Red Sea and the
Nilo-Chadian savannahthe economic
cornerstone of this empire was probably
not easy to maintain.' The royal pyramids
become progressively smaller and poorer;
while the rarity of Egyptian or Mediterra¬
nean objects indicates a cutting-off of out¬
side influences.
The Meroites, who until then had beaten
back the raids of the nomad tribes,
thenceforward became a tempting prey for
their neighbours, Axumites to the south,
nomadic Blemmyes to the east and Nubas
to the west. It is almost certainly to this last
group, mentioned for the first time by
Eratosthenes in 200 BC, that the overthrow
of the Meroitic empire should be ascribed.
The glory of Kush is quite surely
reflected in certain legends of Central and
West Africa. The Sao and the
Bushongothey have legends of the bring¬
ing of knowledge by men from the east.
Knowledge of techniques spread; certain
peoples cast bronze by the "lost wax"
method, as in the Kushite kingdom. But
above all, and of vital importance, it would
seem to be thanks to Meroe that the work¬
ing of iron spread over the African
continent.
Whatever the importance of this
penetration of Meroitic influences through
the rest of Africa, the role of Kush should
never be underestimated: for over a thou¬
sand years, first at Napata and then at
Meroe, there flourished a strongly original
civilization which, beneath an Egyptian-
style veneer fairly constantly maintained,
remained profoundly African.
Jean Leclant
Carved from black granite and nearly four metres in height, this
powerful portrait of king Taharqa (690-664 BC) of the 25th, or
"Ethiopian", dynasty comes from the temple of Gebel Barkal,
near Napata. Under the uraeus, the emblem of royal power in the
form of the sacred asp worn on the headdress of ancient
Egyptian sovereigns, Taharqa Is depicted wearing the typical
Ethiopian skull-cap. Missing from the statue are the tall feathers,
the attributes of the warrior god Onuris, with which the
headdress was originally adorned.
Built during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, this group of
pyramids, fourteen. metres in height, forms part of a royal
necropolis at Gebel Barkal, near Napata. Although at the time
they were built the capital of the empire of Kush had been
transferred to Meroe, a number of rulers were still taken to
Napata for burial.

THE most outstanding feature of poli¬
tical power in Nubia and central
Sudan from the eighth century BC
to the fourth century AD seems to have
been its remarkable stability and continuity.
Unlike many ancient kingdoms, the coun¬
try escaped the upheavals associated with
violent dynastic changes. Indeed one can
say that basically the same royal lineage
continued to rule uninterruptedly following
the same traditions.
Some of these traits are significant in
helping us to sketch the character and
nature of the political and social structure
of the empire of Kush.
One of the peculiar features of the
political system was the choice of a new
sovereign by election. Classical authors,
from Herodotus in the fifth century BC, to
Diodorus of Sicily in the first century BC,
express their surprise about this usage, so
different from that of other ancient
kingdoms, in their accounts of the "Aethio-
pians", as the inhabitants of the Kush em¬
pire were then generally called.
They insist on the oracular choice of the
new king. Diodorus affirms that "the
priests previously select the best of can¬
didates and from those that are summoned
the people take as a king the one whom the
god chooses as he is carried round in pro¬
cession... Straightaway they address and
honour him as if he were a god since the
kingdom was entrusted to him by the will
of the divinity."
An analysis of all the relevant texts
shows that the office of king was
hereditary in the royal lineage. In contrast
to the Pharaonic or any other ancient
Oriental system where the succession nor¬
mally followed the father-son pattern, in
Napata and Meroe the king was chosen
among his royal brethren.
The initiative in choosing a new
sovereign came from the army leaders,
high officials and clan chiefs. Any claimant
of doubtful ability or unpopular with the
electors might well be passed over. The
oracular confirmation was merely a formal
ratification of a previous choice and had
rather a symbolic character designed for
the public which was persuaded that god
himself had elected the new ruler.
Further it is plain that in theory the
crown was to pass to the brothers of a king
before descending to the next generation;
from among twenty-seven kings ruling
before Nastasen (d. about 310 BC), four¬
teen were the brothers of preceding kings.
There were, of course, exceptions when
this or that king usurped the throne, but in
such cases he tried to justify and legalize
his action.
There are also some signs that the right

The matriarchs
of Meroe
A powerful line of Queens
who ruled the Kushite Empire
by Ahmed M. Ali Hakem
with the collaboration of Ivan Hrbek and Jean Vercoutter
Dedicated to Apedemak, the
Meroitic warrior god with the
head of a lion and the body of a
serpent (photo right), the lion
temple at Naga, to the south of
Meroe, is famous for its
inscriptions and reliefs which are
among the finest examples of
Meroitic art. The temple dates
from the late 1st century BC or
early 1st century AD during the
reign of king Natekamani and his
queen Amanitere, depicted
(above right) on the towers flanking
the entrance to the temple. The
importance of the role of the
candaces (queens) in the Meroitic
monarchical system is apparent
from the fact that the sculptor
has given equal importance to
both figures and from the
imperious gesture with which
Amanitere, like her royal husband,
strikes down the enemies of the
kingdom. Although their attitudes
and gestures and the style of the
relief show Egyptian influence,
clothing and ornaments are
typically Meroitic.

to the throne might depend even more on
claims through the maternal line than on
royal paternity. The role of the queen-
mother in the choice of a new king is seen
from many inscriptions. Some of these
traits have close parallels among kingdoms
and chiefdoms in various parts of Africa.
The exact role played by royal ladies in
the earlier periods is not quite clear but
there are many indications that they oc¬
cupied prominent positions and important
offices in the realm. During the Kushite rule
over Egypt the office of the chief priestess
(Dewat Neter) to the god Amon in Thebes
was held by the daughter of the king and
gave her great economic and political in¬
fluence. Even after the loss of Egypt, and
consequently of this office, royal ladies
continued to hold prominent positions
coupled with considerable power among
the temple priesthood of Amon at Napata
and elsewhere.
The queen-mother's important role at
" the election and coronation ceremonies of
her son is mentioned in inscriptions relating
to the coronation of Taharqa (690-664 BC)
and Anlamani (623-593 BC) in such a way
as to leave no doubt about her decisive in¬
fluence and specific status. She also exer¬
cised an influence through a complicated
system of adoption, whereby the queen-
mother, designated by the title Mistress of
Kush, adopted the wife.of her son.
The iconography confirms the enhanced
status of queen-mothers. In religious
scenes on temple walls they occupy promi¬
nent positions, second only to the king
himself, whereas on the walls of the
pyramid chapels the queen appears behind
the deceased king participating as the prin
cipal person in the offerings presented to
him.
In the later period these queens either
mothers or wives started to assume
political power and proclaim themselves
sovereign, even adopting the royal title Son
of Re, Lord of the Two Lands (sa Re, neb
Tawy) or Son of Re end King (sa Re,
Nswbit). Many of them became famous,
and in Graeco-Roman times Meroe was
known to have been ruled by a line of Can-
daces, Kandake or queens regnant.
This title is derived from the Meroitic
Ktke or Kdke meaning queen-mother.
Another titleqere meaning ruler, was
not used until the Meroitic script appeared.
As a matter of fact only four queens are
known to have used this title, namely
Amanirenas, Amanishekhete, Nawidemak
and Maleqereabar, all by definition being
candaces.
It is noteworthy that in the royal tombs
of Nuri, from Taharqa to Nastasen there is
no evidence of a queen having the full
burial of a reigning monarch and during
this period no reigning queen is known.
The earliest attested reigning queen was
Shanakdekhete, early in the second cen¬
tury BC, and she was allowed a full royal
burial. Most probably, in the beginning, the
title and the office did not mean more than
queen-mother. She was entrusted with
bringing up the royal children.
She was thus in a position to exercise
great power and influence which were
manifested by her special role in the cor¬
onation ceremony and her adoption of the
wife of her sbn. At some stage the queens
would outgrow their sons or husbands and
take a favourable moment to assume all
power to themselves.
From Shanakdekhete onwards we have
a series of reigning queens, but beginning
with Amanirenas in the first century BC
there seems to be another development.
This was the close association of the first
wife of the king and, perhaps, their eldest
son on many of the important monuments.
This suggests some degree of co-regency
since the wife who survived her husband
often became the reigning candace.
However, this system did not last for more
than three generations and seems to come
to an end after Natekamani, Amanitere and
Sherkaror in the first half of the first cen¬
tury AD.
All this points to the internal develop¬
ment of a local institution which was not a
copy of a foreign practice such as that of
the Ptolemies in Egypt (cf. Cleopatra). In¬
deed we can observe how these institu¬
tions grew in complexity over the cen¬
turies.
This kingship system had some advan¬
tages over a rigid system of strict direct
succession since it eliminated the danger of
an unsuitable successor, whether a minor
or an unpopular personality. The injection
of new blood into the royal family was
assured by the system of adoption. The
various checks and controls inherent in this
system, the prominence given to the
queen-mother and the insistence, on
rightful descent ensured the rule of the
same royal family. All this may have con¬
tributed to the continuity and stability en¬
joyed by Napata and Meroe for such long
centuries.

Sundiata and Mansa Musa
Architects of Mali's
golden empire
by Djibril Tamsir Niane
THE Manding historical tradition as
taught by the griots forms a corpus
centred on the character of Sun¬
diata, founder of the Empire of Mali. Yet it
is probable that if Ibn Battuta, in 1353, and
Ibn Khaldun, in 1376, had not mentioned
the great conqueror in their writings,
classical historians would have gone on
regarding Sundiata as a mythical or legen¬
dary ancestor, so great is the part at¬
tributed to him by oral tradition in the
history of Manding or Mali.
History relates that Nare Fa Maghan,
king of the Mandingo (1210-1230), had
several wives, one of whom was called
Sogolon Conde. She gave birth to a sickly
child who did not walk until after the age of
ten. This child was named Sundiata.
Because of his infirmity, his life was spared
by Sumaguru, king of the neighbouring
Soso people, when he overran Manding.
Tradition has it that, resolved to succour
his country, Sundiata called for an iron bar
with which to hoist himself to his feet, but
the bar bent i-nder his weight. A member
of his entourage cried out: "Give him his
father's sceptre to lean on", and with the
aid of this royal symbol Sundiata rose to his
feet.
But the harsh rule of Sumaguru con¬
tinued and Sundiata went into exile. He
settled at Mema where a delegation from
the Mandingo clans called on him to lead
the revolt against Sumaguru. At Kirina,
between Bowako and Kangaba, on the left
bank of the River Niger, the rebels led by
Sundiata defeated Sumaguru thus laying
the foundations of the great Empire of
Mali.
Manding tradition attributes to the
young victor of Kirina the codification of
the customs and prohibitions which still

govern relations between the Mandingo
clans and their relations with the other
clans of West Africa. Many things have
been ascribed to this African "Alexander"
which belong to a much later date. But the
main outlines of the Constitution and the
administrative structures are to a large ex¬
tent the work of Sundiata.
According to tradition it was at Kurukan
Fuga that the Gbara or Great Assembly
took place at which Sundiata was solemnly
proclaimed Emperor, King of Kings. Each
ally was proclaimed king or governor
(Farm) of his territory. In fact, only the
chiefs of Mema and Wagadu bore the title
of king.
The Assembly decreed that the Emperor
must always be chosen from the line of
Sundiata, that the princes must always
choose their first wife from among the
Conde. clan (in memory of the happy mar¬
riage of Sundiata's parents Nare Fa
Maghan and Sogolon Conde), and that in
accordance with ancient tradition, the suc¬
cession was to be fratrilinear. The Mansa
was the supreme judge, the patriarch, the
"father of all his subjects", whence the for¬
mula "M'Fa Mansa" (king, my father) for
addressing the king.
The Malinke (Mandingo) and the allies
were divided into sixteen clans of free men
or nobles (Tonta-Djon Tanni Moro), the
sixteen clans who bore quivers. The five
marabout clans, the first of Sundiata's
allies, among them the Toure and the
Berete, who had actively sought out Sun¬
diata in exile, were proclaimed the "five
guardians of the Faith, or Mori Kanda
Lolu". Men practising special trades were
divided into four clans (G'hara Nani). These
included the griots, the shoemakers, and
certain clans of smiths.
As the tradition says, Sundiata "divided
up the world". That is to say, he fixed the
rights and duties of each clan. A special
measure dealt with the defeated Soso:
their territory was declared the property of
the empire, and they were distributed
among the various craft castes or clans.
Some of them fled to the Futa-Djallon
mountains.
This Constitution was very important in
itself, and had far-reaching effects. It
reproduced the age-old pattern of the Em¬
pire of Ghana, in which the individuality of
each region was recognized. But above all,
Sundiata codified the system of craft clans
so that professions became hereditary. It
seems that in the days of the Ghana Empire
every man exercised the trade of his
choice, but henceforward the son had to
practise the same trade as his father,
especially within the four craft clans or
castes.
Each province or kingdom retained a
large degree of autonomy. The name Man¬
ding or Mali applied to all countries with a
large Mandingo population, and the official
title of the Emperor was Be Bara Mansa,
"Emperor of all the peoples".
Al-Omari, adviser and secretary to the
Sultans of Cairo and Damascus, has left us
a list of twelve provinces and fourteen
towns. They have not all been identified
(Arabjc manuscripts are difficult to read
because most of the Arabic writers who
provide the sources of the history of Mali
were translated at a period when little was
known about the toponymy and geography
of the Sudan).
Al-Omari's town of Nyeni can certainly
be identified as Niani, a little village on the
borders of Guinea and Mali. Al-Omari
wrote: "The town of Nyeni is the same in
length and in breadth, being about one
berid long and the same distance wide. It is
not surrounded by a wall, and the houses
stand separately for the most part. The
king has a group of palaces surrounded by
a circular wall. A branch of the Nile (Niger)
surrounds the town on all four sides...
"The houses are built in layers of clay,
like the walls of the gardens at Damascus.
This is how they proceed: they build in clay
to a height of two-thirds of a cubit, then
leave it to dry. Then they repeat the pro¬
cess until all is finished. The ceilings are
made of beams and reeds. They are mostly
in the shape of a cupola or of the hump of a
camel, like arcades. The floors of the
houses are of earth mixed with sand".
Excavation of the tumuli at Niani is now
providing confirmation of Al-Omari's ac¬
count. The stone foundations under the
accumulation of banco or beaten earth;

The international renown of the Mali Empire, which covered much of West Africa
between the 13th and 15th centuries, is reflected In the famous "Catalan Atlas" (1375)
produced by Abraham Cresques for King Charles V of France. Mali ("ciutat de Melli") is
prominently shown along with this portrait of its Mansa (Emperor) wearing a European-
style crown. The ruler Is holding a large nugget symbolizing Mali's fabulous wealth in

tery; traces of the ground plan of a mosque
and of a wall round the palace all these
now make it possible for us to say with cer¬
tainty that it was on the banks of the
Sankarani that Sundiata set up his capital,
which for more than a century was the
political centre of the western Sudan.
Beautifully situated, on a huge plain by
the Sankarani, Niani was surrounded by a
semi-circle of hills crossed by passes and
dominated by a rocky peak. The Sankarani
was deep and navigable all the year round.
Mani, as the town was originally named,
was on the edge of the Guinea-Ivory forest,
a source of gold and palm oil where
Malinke traders sold cotton and copper
goods. Hitherto it had been just a small
town made famous by the resistance of its
king against Sumaguru. When he settled
there, Sundiata changed its name to Niani,
which in Malinke means "suffering". Oral
tradition calls it Niani ma bori, the exile of
Sundiata (the flight of sorrow). The new
name indicated that the conqueror's
troubles were over.
Niani spread swiftly over the plain and at
the foot of the mountains, served by two
ports on the Sankarani, a northern port and
a southern port, and linked to Man'ding
(Bouré) by the Manding Road or Manding
Sila, and to the Niger valley by the
Sarakolle Road or Sarakoule Sila. Niani at¬
tracted both the black merchants and the
Arab/Berbers.
There are several legends cencerning the
death of Sundiata. It is almost certain that
he was drowned in the Sankarani, some
ten kilometres upstream from Niani where
there is a place called Sundiata:dum (Sun¬
diata's shelf). This part of the river is very
deep and the pirogues take care to avoid it.
On either side of the river the Keita set up
sacred places, stone altars where from time
to time, on great occasions, the descen¬
dants of the Conqueror met to sacrifice
fowls and sheep and oxen.
Roughly speaking, Mali at its height
covered the Western Sudan from the
saltpans of Teghaza in the Sahara to the
Ivory-Guinea forest in the south, and, west
to east, from the Atlantic (Tekrur, Gambia,
Bambadinka or Guinea-Bissau) to the Air in
the Es-Souk region, where the copper
mines were then being actively exploited.
It is difficult to estimate the size of the
Empire's population. In the sixteenth cen¬
tury Mahmoud Kati said Mali had 400
towns, and it is certain that the Empire was
well populated, especially in the Niger
valley between Djénné and Timbuktu.
Tekrur and Casamance had a large rural
population. In its heyday in the fourteenth
century, Niani and its many towns must
have had at least a hundred thousand in¬
habitants.
The old principle of succession passing
from brother to brother was not observed
after Sundiata's death, when his eldest
son. Mansa Yerelinkon (or Oulin or Ouali)
seized power and reigned from 1250 to
about 1270.
In about 1307 Kanku Musa, a nephew of
Sundiata, came to the throne. As Mansa
. Musa I he reigned from about 1307 to .1337.
Under him, Mali reached its height.
Mansa Musa is the best known of the
Emperors of Mali, largely because of his
pilgrimage to Mecca in 1325 and his visit to
Cairo, where' he gave away so much gold
he caused a depreciation on the market.
The pilgrimage had important conse¬
quences for the subsequent history of the
Western Sudan, for after it Egypt, the
Maghreb, Portugal and the merchant cities
of Italy took an increasing interest in Mali.
Mansa Musa, who was very proud of his
power, did much to make the rest of the
world think of his Empire as an El Dorado.
Mansa Musa made elaborate prepara¬
tions for his pilgrimage. In accordance with
tradition he levied special contributions
from every trading town and every pro- l
vince. He left Niani with a vast retinue. Y

Djénné, described by the 14th-century
Arab historian Es Saadi as "one of the
greatest markets in the Muslim world",
still boasts a number of fine buildings.
Particularly outstanding Is the Imposing
mosque which, with the equally famous
mosque at Timbuktu, is one of the jewels
of "Sudanese style" architecture. It was
built in 1905 of banco (beaten earth)
strengthened with wood, the material
used centuries before in the prestigious
monuments erected by the Mali Empire's
great ruler Mansa Musa. Far right, rooftop

^Although the figures given by the Arab
writers are probably exaggerated, they give
some idea of the resources Mali could
muster: 60,000 porters and 500 servants
decked in gold and each carrying a golden
staff. ; At the beginning of the sixteenth
century, Mahmoud Kati relates how accor¬
ding to tradition the Emperor was still in his
palace when the head of his caravan arriv¬
ed in Timbuktu.
He was received in Cairo with the
honours due to a great sultan, and created
a great impression by his bearing and Ara¬
bian Nights lavishness. He is one of the few
kings of whom we possess a description.
"He was a young man with a brown skin",
wrote Maqrisi, the contemporary Arab
historian, "a pleasant face and good figure,
instructed in the Malekite rite. He appeared
amidst his companions magnificently
dressed and mounted, and surrounded by
ten thousand of his subjects. He brought
gifts and presents that amazed the eye with
their beauty and splendour".
Tradition says that he bought land and
houses in Cairo and Mecca to accom¬
modate pilgrims from the Sudan. But the
important thing is that he established
sound economic and cultural relations with
the Mamelukes.
Impressed no doubt by the majestic
palaces he saw in Cairo, Mansa Musa
returned home with a famous architect,
Ishaq al-Touedjin, who built the great
mosque at Gao, of which only a few re¬
mains of the foundations and a part of the
mirhab survive. In Timbuktu he built
another great mosque or Djinguereber, and
a royal palace or Madugu. .
But his finest work was certainly ther

i famous audience chamber at Niani, on
" which he lavished all the resources of his
art. The Emperor wanted a strong building
covered with plaster, and Touedjin "built a
square room surmounted by a cupola...
and having covered it with plaster and
decorated it with arabesques in dazzling
colours, he produced a wonderful edifice.
The sultan was delighted and gave Toued¬
jin twelve thousand mitqals of gold dust as
testimony to his satisfaction".
No doubt the Emperor's architect had to
use the most common material in that part
of the Sudan, i.e. beaten earth. Buildings
made of earth need constant repair and
restoration in such latitudes as that of
Niani. Further north where the rainfall is
lighter, buildings last better, as is the case
with the mosques at Djénné, Timbuktu and
Gao. In the absence of stone, the banco or
beaten earth is strengthened with wood;
hence the characteristic Sudanese mos¬
ques bristling with bits of timber.
With the successive destructions of
Niani, the wearing away of the plaster,
years of rain, the poet-architect's great
achievement was finally reduced to a heap
of clay. Perhaps one day the archaeologists
will discover beneath it the stone founda¬
tions of the building that so delighted Man¬
sa Musa.
In Cairo Mansa Musa had been very
, ready. to answer the questions of courtiers
and men of learning, and he described his
empire in detail, not without some exag¬
geration. He said he had "the exclusive
right to gold, and that he gathered it in like
a tribute". Mansa Musa exaggerated the
size of his empire: "The inhabitants are
very numerous", he said, "a vast
multitude. Yet if you compare it with the
black populations which surround it and
stretch to the south, it is like a little white
spot on the coat of a black cow". Musa
was well aware of the existence of large
populations and powerful kingdoms in the
south, and especially of the large popula¬
tion of the Western Sudan.
He also revealed that he had a town call¬
ed Tiggida (the modern Azelik) "where
there is a mine of red copper which is
brought in bars to Niani. There is nothing in
all my empire which is such a large source
of taxes as the import of this unworked
copper. It is got from this mine and from no
other. We send it to the lands of the
heathen Negroes where we sell one mitqal
of it for two-thirds of its weight in gold...".
It was also in Cairo that Musa revealed
that his predecessor on the throne had died
at sea, "for he would not allow that it was
impossible to get to the other side of the
Surrounding Sea, and did all he could to
achieve this purpose...". After the failure
of 200 ships filled with men, and others fill¬
ed with enough gold, water and provisions
to last for years, the Emperor himself took
charge of operations, fitted out a thousand
ships, and set off. He was never to return.
What was'the fate of this expedition and
how far Musa is to be believed are in¬
teresting questions. But at least this anec¬
dote shows that the Mandingo conquerors
who reached the coast, including Gambia,
were not indifferent to the problems of
navigation.
After his famous pilgrimage, the
Marinids of Fez and the merchant cities of
the Maghreb began to take a lively interest
in Mali, and there were exchanges of gifts
and embassies between the rulers.
Musa set up Koranic schools, for he had
bought many books in Cairo and the holy
places.
As a builder. Mansa Musa left an endur¬
ing mark on all the cities of the Sudan, with
their characteristic buildings of beaten
earth strengthened with wood. The
mosques at Djénné and Timbuktu were the
prototypes of what is called the Suda¬
nese style.
As a patron and friend of literature.
Musa helped lay the foundations of the
Negro-Arab literature which was to bear its
finest fruit in the cities of Djénné and Tim¬
buktu in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen¬
turies.
It was under the Mali Empire that urban
development really began in the Sudan. In
the North, Walata was the great crossroads
for the caravan routes. Djénné on the Niger
and Timbuktu on the Niger bend began to
expand. But undoubtedly Niani, the
capital, was in the fourteenth century the
great meeting point for the merchants.
Islam became strongly established in the
towns. The king of Djénné, a vassal of
Mali, was converted in 1300, probably
under pressure from the many Sarakolle
and Malinke traders. While gold played an
important part in the development of trade
across the Sahara, it must not be forgotten
that the economy of the Sudan was also
based on many other kinds of wealth.
Since the time of Sundiata, agriculture
had been, developing fast. Cotton, in-
64

traduced by the Arabs before the tenth
century, was grown in the Sudan-Sahel
belt, and weaving and dyeing had soon
become the specialities of certain clans. Al-
Omari and Ibn Battuta both speak of the
growing of rice, millet and fonio.
The inner delta of the Niger, in the region
of Djénné, was the rice reserve of the Em¬
pire. The city itself, the apanage of the Em¬
presses, grew in importance daily, becom¬
ing a sort of depot for the export of oil,
rice, kola nuts, millet and honey to the
semi-desert regions of Timbuktu, then the
second most important caravan crossroads
after Walata. The western and Atlantic
regions, especially Gambia and
Casamance, produced large quantities of
rice and cotton. Weekly fairs were the oc¬
casion for the exchange of goods by barter.
Several monetary systems were in use
within the Empire: cotton strips, twists of
iron and, above all, cowries were the most
common currencies. Small lumps of rock
salt were also used. The Emperors of
Mali, like the Emperors of Ghana before
them, had regalian rights over gold and
copper. The customs levied on imports and
exports were strictly organized, and there
was a heavy duty on goods exported to the
north. Ibn Battuta observed how closely
the governor of Walata inspected the
caravans.
The Emperors of Ghana, and after them
the Mansas of Mali, were well aware of the
importance of gold in their transactions
with the Arab/Berbers, and strictly forbade
traders from the north to enter the gold-
producing regions. Sudan's control of the
Sahara saltpans gave them still more
power, for there was a severe lack of salt in
the interior of Africa.- Salt was a great
source of revenue for the merchants and all
the Sudanic Empires would try to control
the salt trade.
But, for medieval Europe, Mali was
above all a great exporter of gold, and
before the discovery of America, gold from
the Sudan supplied almost all the Arab
Mediterranean trade. In the fifteenth cen¬
tury the merchant cities of Italy and the
kings of Portugal would vie for access to
the fabulous Sudan.
This great commercial activity fostered
the development of cities, and Niani,
Djénné, Gao and Timbuktu attracted more
and more Arab/ Berbers, while the Malinke
and the Sarakolle (the Diula) set up
markets and fairs all along the border of the
forest. As a result the Mandingo spread far
and wide, from the coasts of Gambia to the
gold-producing regions of Ashanti.
Mali flourished until the sixteenth cen¬
tury, its merchants rivalling the Portuguese
since they controlled the sources of gold in
the African hinterland. Between 1550 and
1599 the last sovereigns struggled in vain to
restore Mali to its former glory; but the
years of greatness were past.

and bold as brass
These tiny ornamental figures are
examples of the brass or gold weights
once used in parts of West Africa for
weighing gold dust. Each one illustrates a
popular saying or proverb. The two
drums, left, of the Akan group of peoples
who live in Ghana and the Ivory Coast,
convey a stark message: "The hide of the
doe who does not follow her mother
always ends up on a drum".
Left, Akan "Adjabia" (Throne of State)
weight symbolizing the King, the State
and the Nation. On seats of this kind the
Akan make sacrifices to the shades of
their ancestors. The moral : "Where there's
no throne there can't be a King" and "The
King is mortal but Adjabia is eternal".
"True solidarity is a matter of arms and
legs" is the saying associated with this
"Atatafé" (solidarity) weight. In other
words if you really want to help others
then be ready to use your muscles.
Another proverb, "We are united because
we have eaten the same food", is even
more explicitly related to the figurine. It
alludes to the unity that comes from
sharing the same spiritual sustenance.

Backward-looking bird, above, is a royal
emblem meaning "The King sees
everything". The moral: sometimes it's a
good idea to see what's going on behind
your back.

The property of the last Sultan of Kilwa, this colourful fez is
typical of Swahili culture, drawing on African influences for
its bead embroidery and on Arab sources for the fez design.
A maritime city-state built on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani,
off the coast of present-day Tanzania, Kilwa was a
flourishing trade centre from the 12th to the 15th century.



The
shaping
of Swahili
civilization
****** *- ^- éï9>^âi\â\r^9W^m
by Victor V. Matveiev
IN the history of the islands and coast of
East Africa the period from the twelfth
to the fifteenth century stands out as
that of the formation of what may best be
termed the Swahili ethnic community.
Around the twelfth century the Swahili
people did not form a homogeneous com¬
munity either ethnically or socially.
Ethnically, a nucleus of Bantu-speaking
peoples was joined by people from the
closer parts of the hinterland and emigrants
from the countries of the northern shore of

tor of research at the Ethnographic Institute of

specialist in African history and ethnology and is

and Records of Early Arab Authors on Bantu
Peoples.
the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean,
comprising Arabs, Persians and Indians.
Social disparity was a fact too, since in
addition to the main body of ordinary, free
members of the community, there existed a
distinct and isolated rich élite which en¬
joyed the influence stemming from tradi¬
tional functions. Alongside this élite the
community included individuals who were
also rich but did not wield traditional power
and influence. Their wealth derived from
trading. The commoners formed the ma¬
jority and the main body of the Swahili
people.
The common Swahili people lived in huts
which they made from sticks and clay and
thatched with palm leaves or grass. These
huts were grouped to form villages and
towns. However, Arab sources tell us of
the more advanced culture of the towns of
the East African islands and coast which
was related to the development of maritime
trade.
These towns probably consisted for the
most part of huts, but they also had stone
buildings and were the dwelling places of
the wealthy and noble members of Swahili
society. The important point was that the
towns were trading centres where local
wares were assembled and ships from
overseas put in. They were at the same
time centres of Islam on the coast.
Archaeological work carried out at Kilwa
Kisiwani, a small island off the eastern
coast, provides a picture of fairly developed
trading. Finds have included a large quanti¬
ty of cowrie shells, which were used as
money, imported pottery of the yellow
sgraffito type with a cream shading and
also with dark green glazing, and
66

glassware. A small quantity of glass, cor¬
naline and quartz beads and steatite vases
from Madagascar have also been found.
The main export item here was gold. In the
mid-twelfth century Kilwa started to import
Chinese Sung porcelain together with a
small amount of celadon.
In the early thirteenth century the
"Shirazi" dynasty ruled at Kilwa and it
seems that Mafia Island came under its
sway. In the mid-thirteenth century Kilwa
fought the Shanga people, who were most
probably the inhabitants of the island of
Sanje ya Kati. The likely cause of the strug¬
gle was rivalry to control local trade. As
related in the Chronicle of Kilwa, Kilwa
ultimately prevailed. This victory probably
underlay the subsequent rapid develop¬
ment of Swahili trade and the Swahili
civilization, which can be reckoned to
begin in the early fourteenth century and
coincided with the advent at Kilwa of a new
dynasty associated with the name of Abu-'l-
Mawahib.
In the fourteenth century the volume of
trade was, it seems, at its height. Our main
source in Arabic for that period is Ibn Bat¬
tuta, who visited East Africa. He describes
Mogadishu as a major trading centre and
relates that it was customary for each mer¬
chant who arrived to choose from among
the citizens a confidential agent to manage
his affairs.
Mogadishu exported "maqdashi" (i.e. of
Mogadishu) cloth. Mogadishu's trade links
were distinct from those of the other towns
farther south. Thus maqdashi cloth was ex¬
ported to Egypt, while other cloth was im¬
ported from Egypt and from Jerusalem.
We know of the huge quantity of cloth ar¬
riving at Mombasa and Kilwa for onward
dispatch to Sofala in the fifteenth century.
The part played by cloth in the early
period is clear, for instance, from the ac¬
count in the Chronicle of Kilwa of the pur¬
chase of Kilwa Island. When Hussein Ben
Ali, an Arab, expressed the desire to pur¬
chase Kilwa Kisiwani, the local African
chief replied that he would sell the island
for a length of cloth sufficient to encircle it.
Hussein Ben AN had the cloth made and
took possession of Kilwa.
The main export items were ivory and
gold. In addition to these were slaves (the
slave raids being referred to by Ibn
Battuta), rhinoceros horn, ambergris,
pearls, shells and, in the northern part of
the coast, leopard skins.
There were undoubtedly links between
the coast and the inland gold-bearing
regions near Lake Nyasa, from which the
gold was brought to Kilwa. The gold-
bearing regions near the Zambezi in the
heart of the continent and on the territory
of what is now Zambia were probably the
first with which trade links were establish¬
ed. This is attested by finds of cowrie
shells, which were exchanged for gold and
ivory. In the Engaruka area of present-day
Kenya, excavation of a trading settlement
yielded the same type of cowrie shells and
beads (of the fifteenth and sixteenth cen¬
turies) as in excavations at Kilwa and other
coastal towns.
In this trade it was cowrie shells more
than any other article which provided a
medium of exhange. They are found in all
excavations and, as indicated, not only on
the coast but also in the interior of the con¬
tinent. The same purpose seems to have
been served by beads and, at a later date,
by china. Where commercial activity was
the most intense a new type of medium of
exchange was introduced in the form of
coins of copper and silver. The minting
centres seem to have been Kilwa and
Mogadishu.
Coins are found in the major trading cen¬
tres such as Kilwa Kisiwani, Kisiwani
Mafia, Kwa on Juani Island, and the
islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. It may also
be supposed that coins had a greater ex¬
change value than cowries, and their in¬
troduction is a likely indication of the large
scale of business done. This is borne out by
the fact that the main article of trade at
Kilwa was gold, with its very high intrinsic
value. At that time the abundance of gold
and its rôle in commerce as an article of
trade obviously precluded its use as a
medium of exchange.
Trade underlay the social and cultural
development of Swahili society. The con¬
tacts that are a natural part of trading
familiarized it with the cultural
achievements of other peoples, in par¬
ticular the Arabs, Persians and Indians.
Despite the vast quantity of goods of
Chinese origin found in the course of ex¬
cavations, the Chinese did not take a direct
part in trading with Africa until the early fif¬
teenth century.
A consequence of the development of
trade was the appearance of an influential
group in Swahili society competing for
power with the old aristocracy. The rise of
this new influential group and its
endeavour to consolidate its position called
for a new ideology. This was provided by
Islam which had become known through
contacts with the Arabs and Persians.
The penetration of Islam seems to have
begun at the end of the seventh or eighth
century. In the tenth century Al Masudi
reports the presence of Muslims on Kan-
balu Island speaking an African language.
That is the period to which the spread of
Islam on the East African islands is usually
attributed. In the thirteenth century Islam
spread to the coast itself. This East African
Islam should evidently not be put on a par
with that of the Arab countries, for in¬
stance. In all probability, what was impor¬
tant at the beginning was simply to be con¬
sidered as being Muslim, and the new
religion coexisted with traditional cults.
In the course of time the influence of
Islam grew and went deeper, and the
number of adherents increased. An out¬
ward indication of this kind of change is the
rise in the number of mosques. The start of
this extension process should probably be
dated back to no later than the last decades
of the twelfth century, and its full develop¬
ment must have coincided with the four¬
teenth and fifteenth centuries.
The adoption and spread of Islam under
conditions of intense commercial activity
was accompanied by much borrowing from
Arabic, particularly with regard to trade,
religion and law. Judging by the reference
in Ibn Battuta's work to the cadis of
Mogadishu and Kilwa, Swahili society
assimilated some elements of the Muslim
legal system (but probably not the entire
system). The demands of trade and
religion, with the need to keep accounts, to
observe a number of Muslim religious
ceremonies, and to fix the rights and
privileges of the various sections of Swahili
society, also led to Swahili being put into a
written form based on Arabic script.
A consequence of the development and
spread of Islam among the Swahili was not
only the construction of mosques but also
the development of building in stone. Its
beginnings date back to the twelfth century
in Gedi, Zanzibar and Kilwa. This initial
period had its own building methods,
which consisted simply in laying coral
blocks on red clay. The only edifice from
that period to have survived to this day is
the Great Mosque of Kilwa but it was
rebuilt a number of times and is now a
completely new building.
In the fourteenth century the main
trading centre of Kilwa underwent a period
of growth and prosperity in architecture as
well as in commerce, and building methods
developed further. Use was simply made of
undressed stone of more or less uniform
size, which was placed in mortar. New con¬
struction elements included spherical and
pointed cupolas, semicylindrical vaults,
stone columns and various ornaments. But
it seems that those elements were then on¬
ly to be found at Kilwa. Elsewhere flat roofs
continued to be the rule.
In the course of the fourteenth century
many stone houses were built in Kilwa and
it became a large town. This construction
activity undoubtedly denotes the growing
wealth of the town. In the first half of the
fifteenth century this activity continued at
Kilwa and was accompanied by further im¬
provement in building methods. The mor¬
tar was poured into casings and completed
with rubble. Even cupolas were built in this
way. Monolithic columns were replaced by
columns of stone and mortar. The basic
type of house remained the same but
houses of two or three floors made their
appearance.
A characteristic detail of building at that
time was the custom of adorning vaults
and cupolas with glazed vessels of Chinese
and Persian porcelain set into the body of
the construction. The house with a
mosque within the bounds of Makutani is a
monument of that period at Kilwa. In the
reign of Sultan Sulaiman ibn Muhammed
al-Malik al-Adil (1412-1442), the Great
Mosque of Kilwa was reconstructed in its
present form, and it is a very fine example
of East African Swahili architecture.
According to Portuguese sources, the
streets of the districts of Kilwa comprising
mud-wall houses were narrow and covered
over with protruding palm leaves forming
the roofs of the houses. The buildings in
the town had wooden doors and, probably,
other details in wood richly adorned with
carving. Work of this kind has come to
light in various parts of the coast, par¬
ticularly Bagamoyo and Zanzibar.
The Portuguese were impressed by the
towns, by the wealth of the inhabitants and
by the elegance of their rich gold-adorned
silk and cotton clothes. The women wore i
chains and bangles of gold and silver on I

The Great
Mosque
of Kilwa
"Faith and righteousness are their foremost
qualities", declared the Arab historian Ibn
Battuta in a description of the people of Kilwa
written in 1331. For not only was Kilwa an
important trading centre, it was also a centre of
Islamic Influence. Construction of the Great
Mosque of Kilwa was begun in the 12th century
and as the city's prosperity grew the Mosque
was rebuilt several times. During the reign of
Sultan Sulaiman ibn Muhammed al-Malik al Adil
(1412-1442) the Great Mosque was reconstructed
in its present form (aerial photo above) and with
its cupolas, columns and vaults (right) it remains
a fine example of East African Swahili
architecture. Kilwa imported large quantities of
Persian and Chinese pottery, including Sung
porcelain and celadon and, later, Ming blue and
white porcelain. A curious practice among
builders of the time was to inset porcelain bowls
as a ceiling decoration. Above, a fallen portion

their arms and legs, and earrings set with
precious stones.
The furniture consisted of carpets and
mats, and sometimes stools and luxurious
beds inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl,
silver and gold. The rich made everyday
use of imported pottery from Iran, Iraq and
China, as well as from Egypt and Syria.
East African Swahili towns, like Kilwa,
were often administrative centres and the
capitals of small States ruled over by the
local Muslim dynasties. But above all they
were trading centres. Indeed, it seems clear
that the East African Swahili civilization
was the fruit of commercial development.
It was trade that prompted the growth and
progress of a civilization. But it can also be
said to have underlain its weakness, for it
. was not tied in with development of the
productive forces of the region.
From the occupations of the population
it can be seen that the Swahili people as a
whole did not endeavour to develop its pro¬
ductive forces beyond the level which pro
bably obtained in traditional Swahili society
before the advent of trading on a substan¬
tial scale.
This is also evident from the fact that few
iron tools or other metal instruments have
come to light in excavations. Almost all the
goods got or produced by the Swahili were
intended not for local consumption but for
sale and export. This was also true of hunt¬
ing and the mining of such commodities as
gold and iron.
At the same time, trade alone was an in¬
sufficient basis and stimulant for a civiliza¬
tion. The loss of former trade routes and
the disruption of commercial relations
threatened to bring trade to a standstill,
with the inevitable consequence of a rapid
depletion of wealth and of the civilization's
vital force. This, as we now know, was
what the future held in store for the East
African towns.
Various circumstances are considered to
have contributed to the decline of the
Swahili civilization. There was the Zimba
invasion, and it also seems that decreased
rainfall and the consequent upsetting of
the water balance hindered the further
development of the coastal towns.
It is possible that all these factors did ac¬
tually sap the Swahili civilization. The chief
cause, however, was the disruption of
maritime trade by the Portuguese. Being
well fitted out, equipped with artillery and
built for the very purpose of naval warfare,
the Portuguese ships were an invincible
force. Their constant presence in the
region under the command of Ruy Lorenso
Ravasco, the seizure of twenty vessels
laden with goods, the defeat of Zanzibar's
large fleet of light craft, and the plundering
and destruction of the coastal towns, par¬
ticularly Kilwa, were all blows from which
East African maritime trade never
recovered, and beneath them medieval
Swahili civilization perished.

The imposing ruins of Great
Zimbabwe, former capital of
two great southern African
states the Monomatapa
Empire (12th to late 15th
century) and the Changamire
Empire (late 15th to early 19th
century) are situated near
Fort Victoria in present-day
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The
construction of Zimbabwe's
hilltop stronghold, and the
Great Enclosure on the plain
below must have required an
effort comparable to that
involved in the building of the
Egyptian pyramids. The conical
tower, right, 9 metres in
height, lies within the massive
walls of the Great Enclosure
which was erected in the 13th
and 14th centuries. The wealth
of Zimbabwe was based on
the region's gold and copper
mines and the recent discovery
in the ruins of a coin bearing
the effigy of Sultan Al-Hasan
Bin Sulaiman (1320-1333) of
Kilwa seems to confirm that
Zimbabwe was regularly
visited by Arab traders from
the east coast.

A continent viewed from within
the "being" of Africans is the same that
of Homo sapiens their "being-in-the-
world" is different. Once this is done, new
instruments can be developed with which
to apprehend their particular evolution.
Four main principles must govern
research if we want to push forward to a
new frontier in African historiography.
To begin with, interdisciplinarity. This is
so important that it can almost be regarded
as a source in itself. The application of
political sociology to the oral tradition con¬
cerning the Kingdom of Ségou, for exam¬
ple, has filled out considerably a picture
which would otherwise be nothing but a
bare genealogical tree decked with a few
stereotyped exploits. And was it not a
datum of cultural anthropology the in¬
itiatory text of the Fula shepherdswhich
enabled prehistorians to unravel some of
the enigmas of the Tassili frescoes in
Algeria ?
The expansion of the Bantus, as attested
by the concordant sources of linguistics,
oral tradition, archaeology, anthropology,
and the early written sources, Arab, Por¬
tuguese, British and Afrikaaner, becomes a
living reality which can be set out in a vivid
synthesis. Similarly, while linguistic
arguments converge with those of
technology to suggest that royal gongs and
twin bells spread from West Africa to
Lower Zaire, Shaba and Zambia, ar¬
chaeological evidence would of course pro¬
vide invaluable confirmation of this.
The Ennedi provides an excellent exam¬
ple of the coming together of all available
sources. In this region it has been possible
to establish a diachronic typology of pic¬
tural and ceramic styles and to draw from
them a chronological series extending over
eight millennia; and all this supported by
stratigraphie soundings, and confirmed by
carbon datings and the study of flora and
fauna, the habitat, and oral tradition.
When eclipses are linked to the reigns of
various dynasties, a list of dated eclipses,
more or less visible according to area, can
occasionally help with chronology. But, in
general, chronology requires the use of
several sources, for a variety of reasons:
firstly, the average length of reigns and
generations varies; secondly, the nature of
the relationship between a sovereign and
his successor is not always clear.
On the other hand, it is very important
that the whole course of the historical pro¬
cess should be reintegrated into the con¬
text of African time. The Africans' idea of
time is based on the principle of causality.
But of a causality applied according to par¬
ticular norms, in which logic is steeped in
and diverted by myth; in which the
economic stage reached is elementary, and
time is not money, so that there is no need
for it to be measured numerically; in which
the rhythm of work and of days is
metronome enough for human activity; in
which calendars are not abstract or univer¬
sal, but deal in natural phenomena such as
moon and sun, rain and drought, and the
movement of men and beasts.
Every hour is defined by concrete acts.
Thus, in Burundi, amakama is the time to
milk (7 a.m.); maturuka is when the herds
are let out (8 a.m.); kuasase is when the
sun spreads out (9 a.m.); kumusase is
when the sun spreads out over the hills (10
a.m.), and so on. Jn this cattle-raising
country, time is measured in terms of
pastoral and agricultural life.
This conception of time is historical in
several respects. In gérontocratie African
societies the idea of anteriority is even
more significant than elsewhere, because
upon.it alone are based such rights as
public pronouncement, participation in
special dances and certain dishes, mar¬
riage, the respect of other people, and so
on.
Primogeniture is not usually a matter of
exclusive right to royal succession, and the
number of those with potential claims
(uncles, brothers, sons) is always high. The
fact that age is taken into account in the
context of a very open competition again
lends significance to chronoiogy.
Another imperative requirement is that
African history must be seen at last from
within, not still measured by the yardstick
of alien values. There cannot be an in¬
dependent collective personality without
an awareness of self and of the right to be
different. Of course, the policy and practice
of self-examination do not consist in ar¬
tificially abolishing Africa's historical con¬
nexions with the other continents of the
Old and New Worlds. But these connex¬
ions have to be analysed in terms of mutual
exchanges and multilateral influences, in
which something will be heard of Africa's
contribution to the development of
mankind.
Moreover, this history can only be the
history of the peoples of the African conti¬
nent seen as a whole, including the
mainland and neighbouring islands such as
Madagascar. The history of Africa obvious¬
ly includes the Mediterranean sector in a
unity consecrated by age-long and
sometimes bloody links, which make the
two parts of Africa on either side of the
Sahara the two leaves of one door, the two
sides of one coin. It has to be a history of
peoples, for even the despotism of certain
dynasts has always been tempered in
Africa by distance, by the absence of those
technical means which add to the weight of
centralization, and by the permanence of
village democracies, so that at every level.
from base to summit, the council called
together through and for discussion con¬
stitutes the brain of the body politic. It
must be a history of peoples because, ex¬
cept for a few decades in modern times, it
has never been shaped according to the
frontiers fixed by colonization, for the good
reason that the territorial bases of the
African peoples differ everywhere from the
frontiers inherited from colonial partition.
So in the continental context, the em¬
phasis should be on common factors
resulting from common origins and age¬
long inter-regional exchanges of men,
goods, techniques and ideas, in other
words of both material and spiritual com¬
modities. Even since prehistory, despite
natural obstacles and the low level of
techniques, there has been a certain degree
of historical solidarity on a continental
scale, between the Nile valley and the
Sudan on the one hand and the forest of
Guinea on the other; between the Nile
valley and East Africa, including among
other things the dispersion of the Lwos;
between the Sudan and Central Africa,
through the diaspora of the Bantu; and
between the Atlantic and east coasts,
through transcontinental trade across
Shaba. Migration, which took place on a
large scale in both space and time, is not to
be seen as a vast human tide attracted by
emptiness and leaving emptiness in its
wake.
Our history of Africa must avoid being
too narrative, for otherwise it would be in
danger of according too much importance
to external factors and influences. Of
course, the establishment of key events is a
task of the first importance, indispensable
to the task of defining the original outline
of African evolution. But the main concern
will be civilizations, institutions, structures:
agrarian and metallurgical techniques, arts
and crafts, trade networks, and conception
and organization of power, religion and
religious and philosophical thought, the
problem of nations and pre-nations, tech¬
niques of modernization, and so on. The
methodological approach makes inter¬
disciplinarity even more necessary.
Finally, why this return to African
sources? While for an outsider this quest
for the past could be merely a way of satis¬
fying curiosity, a highly stimulating intellec¬
tual exercise for someone eager to solve
the riddle of the Sphinx, the real intention
of our enterprise should go far beyond
these purely individual aims. For the history
of Africa is necessary to the understanding
of world history, many passages of which
Will remain impenetrable enigmas as long
as the historical horizon of the continent of
Africa has not been lit up.

Pre-publication announcement. . .
the General History of Africa
The first two volumes of the English and French editions of this eight-
volume work, to be published by Unesco in collaboration with a
number of well-known publishers, are expected to be available to the
public in mid-1980. The History is being prepared under the
intellectual and scientific responsibility of an international committee of
scholars composed of thirty-nine members, twenty-six of whom are
African.
The General History of Africa will be a history of ideas and
civilizations, societies and institutions. It will introduce the values of
oral tradition as well as the multiple forms of African art.
The History will be viewed essentially from the inside. It will reflect
the way in which African authors view their own civilization. Prepared
in an international framework and drawing to the full on present
scientific knowledge, it will be a vitally important element in the
recognition of the African cultural heritage.
Africa will be considered as a totality. The History will show the
historical relationships between the various parts of the continent and
between Africa and the other continents. It will bring out Africa's
contribution to the development of mankind.
The History will not seek to be exhaustive. It will be a work of
synthesis and a statement of problems showing the present state of
knowledge and the main trends in research.
The work Is to be presented in eight volumes of 750 pages :
Volume I : Methodology and African Prehistory
(Editor: Prof. J. Ki-Zerbo)
Volume II : Ancient Civilizations of Africa
(Editor: Dr. G. Mokhtar)
Volume III : Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century
(Editor: H. E. Mr. M. El Fasi)
Volume IV : Africa from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century
(Editor: Prof. D. T. Niane)
Volume V : Africa from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century
