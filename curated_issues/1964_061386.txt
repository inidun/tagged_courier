TODAY'S TRENDS
IN WORLD
COMMUNICATIONS
i Paul Almasy. Paris
Every day, some 300 million copies oí daily
newspapers, 400 million radio receivers and
130 million television sets bring news and information to
the people of the "world. Over 212,000 fixed cinemas and
many thousands of mobile units provide them with
entertainment and information.
These facts emerge from a 380-page report, World
Communications (1), just published by Unesco, which
gives the latest information on press, radio, film and
television facilities throughout the globe. It also
highlights trends in these media during the past decade.
Significantly, all the mass media, except the daily press,
expanded more rapidly during this period than world
population, which increased by 26 per cent. The world's
total of radio receivers advanced by 60 per cent; the
number of fixed cinemas doubled and the total of TV

cations Center, New York.
sets tripled. Dally newspaper circulation rose by no more
than 20 per cent.
Many gains in press, radio and film were scored in the
developing countries. Television, almost unknown in
1953 in Africa, Asia and Latin America, has spread
swiftly to all parts of the world. Nevertheless, the
cinema has maintained a leading role in the world of
entertainment, its weekly total of spectators equalling
one-eighth of the world's population.
There has been a world-wide growth in the news agency
field. As many as 155 agencies are now operating in
80 countries, compared to 96 agencies in 54 countries a
decade ago.
Another striking trend has been the growing use of the
mass media for education in both developed and
developing countries (see article page 12).
World Communications emphasizes, however, that the
information media are very unequally shared between
nations and points out that some 70 per cent of the

Unesco's latest global report on press, radio, films and TV shows that though information media are outpacing population
growth, they are still very unequally shared, 70% of the world lacking adequate facilities. Europeans, for example, buy
38% of world daily papers and North Americans 23%, while Africans, Asians and South Americans together only buy 26%.
Above, study in intent readership offered by youngsters around a street-corner magazine vendor's pitch in Lima, Peru.
world's peoples, living in over 100 countries of Africa,
Asia and Latin America, still lack adequate communication
facilities: in terms of daily newspapers there should be
at least 10 copies for every 100 people.
Europeans buy 38 per cent of world dally papers, and
North Americans 23 per cent, while Africans, Asians and
South Americans together buy only 26 per cent. In the
United Kingdom there are 51 copies of daily papers for
every 100 people the world's highest level compared to
only one paper for every hundred Africans or Indians.
In most countries throughout the world, dally news¬
papers have increased in circulation since 1950. Some of
the larger countries have registered significant advances.
The general interest dally press of the United States,
with a total of 59 million copies, claims a rise of four
million since 1954. In the same period, dally circulation
has expanded by five million copies in Japan and nine
million in the U.S.S.R. to reach a level of 39 million in
each country.
It seems clear that newspaper publishing now stands
on the verge of the most important technical revolution
In Its 400-year history.
In the field of printing itself, electronics and automation
have solved many problems in production control, espe¬
cially on high-speed rotary presses, as well as in actual
production. This is a feat which few believed possible
as little as 15 years ago.
There has been a vast improvement in rotary offset
printing, due largely to the use of photocomposition,
better Inking, faster etching methods, the electronic
engraving of plates and electronic control of registers.
Indeed, the days of conventional printing in raised type,
used since the time of Gutenberg and Caxton, appear to
be numbered. Its place will probably be taken by various
forms of photocomposition or filmsetting, that is, of
printing plates prepared from photograph negatives,
including both text and illustrations in the same process, 5

From carrier pigeons to satellites
with a great gain in speed, versatility and economy.
A major result of these advances is that the need for
skilled technicians will be minimized.
Within a decade or two, it seems, only the mass
circulation newspapers and magazines will be printed as
they are today, though they will doubtless be able to
convert to the new processes eventually. The fact that,
for the time being, these techniques are particularly
suited to small circulation dailies, to weeklies and other
periodicals is of special interest to the developing
countries.
Newspaper publishing has also benefited from the
application of new telecommunication techniques, in
association with news agency development. These
advances have been made more particularly in the
developed countries. In Japan, newspaper and news
agency interests undertook post-war research on the
facsimile transmission of ideographs, as well as on
Monotype and Teletypesetting, as a means of raising
efficiency and conserving manpower. This culminated,
in 1959, in the simultaneous publication of newspaper
editions In Japanese cities hundreds of miles apart.
In 1962 a New York daily went a stage further with the
simultaneous publication, by high-speed facsimile and
Teletypesetting, of editions in Paris and Los Angeles, the
rate of transmitting material being 16 times the normal
speed by cable and radio. Later in the year, the same
newspaper transmitted several articles, by photo-
facsimile, to its Paris edition through the first commu¬
nications satellite, as well as seven pages to and from the
satellite.
These developments, It was foreseen, pointed the way to
the simultaneous production of newspaper editions
throughout whole regions and, ultimately, of "global

FIRST TRANSATLANTIC
LIVE TV VIA TELSTAR
Television experienced a spectacular development in 1 962 when
the first live programmes were relayed across the Atlantic by
means of Telstar, a communications satellite. Eighteen countries
in the Eurovision network participated with the United States
in these exchanges, viewed by an audience of over 200 million
in Europe and North America. The first image across the Atlantic
was a shot of engineers at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in the
United States (below). This transmission, relayed by Telstar
as it circled the globe, was picked up by the giant horn antenna
at Pleumeur-Bodou in western France (left) and by a British
station at Goonhilly Downs, from where, a few days later, the
first transmissions of colour TV via satellite went to the U.S.A.
C.N.E.T.. Paris
newspapers." The subscriber would dial a telephone
number and the front page of his "paper" would appear
on his television screen, remaining there until he pressed
a button, when it would be replaced by the second page
and so on. He would, in fact, be able to view not only
his local newspaper but papers in all countries in this
way.
Recent advances in telecommunications culminated on
July 19, 1962 in one of the most dramatic events in news
agency history. On that day the world news agencies
entered the space age by using the first communications
satellite to relay dispatches by telephone and teleprinter
between continents. London and New York newspapers
also exchanged dispatches through the satellite.
It was foreseen that three "stationary" satellites, each
orbiting over the equator at a speed synchronized with
the rotation of the earth, could provide any type of
telecommunication service over the whole globe. Pro¬
fessional organizations of the press, such as the Inter¬
national Federation of Newspaper Publishers and the
Commonwealth Press Union, prepared for further develop¬
ments in the expectation that facilities of this kind would
be available to press and other users by 1968.
Ironically, the conditions of modern life have at times
forced a return to "new-old" techniques of com¬
munications. A somewhat fanciful example Is reported
by Reuters, which transmitted news dispatches by carrier
pigeon In 1850 and by communications satellite In the
historic experiment of 1962. The agency states that
pigeons have come back as carriers of newsfllm Items
across metropolitan areas. Pigeons are not worried, as
dispatch riders can be, by traffic Jams.
Many of the problems encountered In the field of the
press do not arise, or are less acute, In radio broadcasting,
and the developing countries In particular are giving
priority to this medium In expanding their information
facilities. Since 1950, the number of radio receivers for
every 100 people in all regions has Increased much more
rapidly than the ratio of dally newspapers. Only two
regions, Africa and Asia, now average fewer than five sets
per 100 people, suggested as a minimum of adequacy by
Unesco. The Americas, Europe, Oceania and the U.S.S.R.
exceeded this level by from 10 to 73 sets on a regional
basis.
here has been a parallel Increase in the
number of transmitters. Africa had 140
transmitters In 1950 and 370 in 1962. The number in
Europe rose during the same period from 566 to 2,700.
The total more than doubled In South America, almost
tripled in Asia and almost quadrupled In the U.S.S.R.
It is evident that, despite the world-wide challenge of
television, radio has a long and active future before It as
a medium unsurpassed In speed, range and economy.
Like the press, radio in the developed regions Is a
well-established medium. But, again like the press, It
has experienced many technical changes since 1950 and
Is on the threshold of new developments.
In recent years the transistor has brought "pocket
radio" within the reach of millions of people In all
regions. But the transistor receiver is no longer a
toyan object of Interest only because of Its diminutive
size. It is now a high-grade instrument capable of giving
both the volume and quality of sound usually associated
only with sets having four or five valves and working
from power mains.
Ieanwhile, the trend towards "miniaturi¬
zation", spurred by the revolution In elec¬
tronics and the development of space satellites, Is making
for still smaller receivers and other radio equipment.
Even now, the transistor Is being superseded by micro-
components such as the tunnel diode, which is already
in mass production. Within a decade, It Is expected by
some technical observers, the wrist-watch radio, powered
by the heat of the listener's body, will be generally
available. Such developments are giving further stimulus
to the mass production of low-cost receivers for use in
the developing countries. These developments are
moving so swiftly as to anticipate the day when there
will be one receiver for every family In the worlda
target which would at present require over 400 million
additional sets.
The past decade has witnessed the increasing adoption
of frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting, which
provides the listener with a high quality signal relatively
free from Interference and, moreover, employs hitherto
unused very high frequencies in the overcrowded radio
spectrum. The experience of a number of developing
countries, particularly in Europe and North America, has
shown that FM broadcasting for local services is capable
of expansion in a way which would relieve much of the
present burden in the low, medium- and high-frequency
bands and thus improve conditions for national, regional
and International transmissions. The introduction of FM

broadcasting Is therefore of special interest to the
developing countries, and particularly to tropical areas
affected by solar Interference.
Meanwhile, the high quality of FM transmissions has
stimulated a whole Industry catering to the radio-de¬
veloped taste for high fidelity musical recordings.
Coupled with this has been the development of stereo¬
phonic broadcasting which, by using two matched sources
of sound, gives breadth, depth and movement to musical,
theatrical and other programmes.
.fter only 27 years since its initial direction to
^a mass audience, television has established
Itself as a potent medium of information, education and
entertainment throughout the world. It was in 1936 that
the British Broadcasting Corporation inaugurated the
first public telecasts. The second world war halted tele¬
vision development. But, with the coming of peace, the
developed countries began to turn their electronics
industries to peaceful purposes.
Television is now expanding with fantastic speed. In
1950, Africa, South America, Asia and Oceania had no
television receivers at all. Today, countries in every

A NEW ERA
IN PRINTING
A technical revolution is taking place
in printing today through the increas¬
ed adoption of photocomposition or
filmsetting in place of the use of
raised type. Left, a glass type-wheel
in the photographic unit of an
ultra-modern electronic photosetting
machine. This rotating disc, only
8 inches in diameter replaces three
tons of normal lead matrixes. It has
1,440 characters. In operation a stro¬
boscope light passes through the se¬
lected character on the disc into an
optical system which projects the light
in the form of a type character on to
sensitized film. As the light lasts only
a few microseconds, the image is
"stopped" on the film without halting
the rotating disc. The machine is ope¬
rated from a main keyboard similar to
that of a standard typewriter with
additional keys for various type com¬
posing functions. A second keyboard

region maintain services. The world total of sets has
risen from a mere 11 million in 1950 to 130 million in 1963.
The number of transmitters has also increased
spectacularly during the same period, from 130 to 2,380.
For the first time more than half the world total of TV
receivers is to be found outside the U.S.A. Europe has
registered the greatest increase of all regions from
15 to 1,160.
IInternational programme co-operation has
become a regular feature of television develop¬
ment. Most exchanges so far have been made through
telerecordings. The direct transmission of programmes
across frontiers has progressed rather slowly because of
the need for link stations, coaxial cables and converters
to permit transmissions on one line definition (number
of lines and band-widths) to be received by another
system.
However, 18 Western European countries now exchange
programmes through Eurovision, sponsored by the
European Broadcasting Union, and with the United
States. Six Eastern European countries and the U.S.SH.
exchange programmes through Intervision, and also
co-operate with Eurovision in programme exchanges.
Nordvision links the Scandinavian countries. Bilateral
exchanges make available a wide range of other
programmes.
Many Asian, African and South American countries arc
unable to meet production costs for independent pro¬
grammes, or even the costs of better quality Imported
programmes. As a result, their television screens often
reflect the less impressive cultural standards of "popular"
commercial television in the developed countries. Never¬
theless, some of the developing countries are boldly
imaginative in their use of television facilities for
education.
In the field of reception, both small and "full size"
transistor sets, which work by battery or off the mains
and can thus be used Indoors or outdoors, have been
developed. It Is expected that, as in the case of radio,
the transistor will before long be superseded by even
smaller components which will make possible the
production of diminutive "handbag" sets, operating In
colour. Also foreseen is the manufacture of home sets
with the picture tube separated from the receiver. These
sets would be built into a wall for better viewing.
In the field of transmission, colour television is being
actively developed in the United States, Japan, the
U.S.S.R. and a number of European countries. Advances
are also being made in stereophonic television. Other
Innovations are the use of video tape the recording of 9

both sound and picture on magnetic tape rather than
slowly-processed film; more "miniaturization" of cameras
and, hence, more "live" coverage of news; and the de¬
velopment of the transistorized tape recorder, by which
a picture can be seen as soon as it Is recorded and thus
can be edited on the spot.
A new dimension has meanwhile been given to an
old medium through "theatre-vision", described as "a
marriage between the living theatre and closed-circuit
television". By this means audiences in out-of-town
theatres can see plays or operas transmitted hundreds of
miles by telephone from a city theatre and projected on
large cinema screens.
he most spectacular development in television
history was the relaying, in 1962, of live pro¬
grammes across the Atlantic by means of the first com¬
munications satellite. Eighteen countries In the Euro-
vision network participated "with the United States in
these exchanges, viewed by an audience of over 200 mil¬
lion in Europe and North America.
During the first four months of the satellite's operation,
47 intercontinental transmissions were conducted, in¬
cluding five in colour of remarkable clarity. This
inspiring co-operative effort pointed to the coming of
world television, with all the diversity and enrichment it
will hold for the viewer of the future.
Apart from a few countries, mainly in North America
and Europe, where television has developed most exten¬
sively, the cinema has continued to expand both in terms
of film production and exhibition and has retained its
pre-eminent role in the world of entertainment. Since
1954, an increasing number of countries have entered
into film production and, at the same time, the total
number of fixed cinemas has doubled from over 100,000
to 212,000. Their present weekly audience of 376 million
equals one-eighth of the world population.
The principal gains were scored by the U.S.S.R. and
the developing countries, where mobile units further
expanded the cinema audience. Throughout most of
Africa and Asia, however, the number of cinema seats
still fell below the level of two per 100 persons, suggested
as a minimum of adequacy by Unesco.
For several decades the United States, which still
maintains a predominant role in world markets, was the
largest producer of feature films. Since the mid-1950's,
however, American output has trailed behind that of
Japan, India and Hong Kong. In 1960, there were 26
countries which produced 20 or more features annually.
They included 12 in Europe, 8 in Asia, 2 in North America,
2 in South America and 1 in Africa, plus the U.S.S.R.
In the production field, there have been significant

cameras with sound. Advances have also been made
in the production of colour films for screening both In
cinemas and on television, as well as In stereophonic
sound and optical systems which assure better images
for both of the media.
Nother development, of particular interest to
'tropical and semi-tropical countries, Is the
production of projectors which use the sun as their
source of light and can be employed to screen fllmstrlps
In remote, non electrified areas.
New types of cinemas, such as "drive-ins" for motorists
and "theatroramas," are making a fresh appeal to
potential cinemagoers and, as in the United States for
example, are helping the industry to regain part of the
audience lately lost to television. Some of these units,
located in new suburban shopping and recreation centres
with adequate car-parking space, have been more speci¬
fically classified as "drive-to" cinemas.
The development of closed-circuit television, which
links groups of cinemas for the screening of special
events, presages the time when the projection booth for
hundreds of halls will be located in a single television
station. These and other advances point the way to the
gradual integration of the cinema with television.
This is, In fact, already being realized in the realm of
space technology, where narrow- and wide-angle tele¬
vision cameras are being increasingly employed in
communications, metereological and astronomical satel¬
lites, as well as in space exploration vehicles. The screen¬
ing of film Images transmitted directly to the earth
from outer space may be expected to give further stimulus \\
to what has been described as "the renaissance of the
cinema".

he sights and sounds of radio, television,
newspapers and film are today becoming as
familiar in classrooms around the world as blackboards
and chalk in some cases even more so.
Increasingly, the dual role of the mass media in
information and education is being recognized through¬
out the globe. The developing countries, where the
lack of communication and educational facilities is
greatest, realize that the new audio-visual aids can
revolutionize the teaching of subjects as varied as
languages, geography and science.
World Communications a recent Unesco report (see
page 4) shows how these media are being used today: by
some countries to enrich already adequate schooling, by
others to supplement inadequate teaching resources and
elsewhere to bypass the barriers of illiteracy, or to combat
It directly.
Rural areas of less developed countries, the poorest
In means of communication, are also generally those with
12 the fewest schools.
This fact underlines the crucial role of the mass media
in promoting education as well as economic and social
advancement generally. Unsurpassed in speed, range and
impact, the mass media offer unlimited possibilities for
providing both technical as well as general education on
a broad scale.
This is why many African governments are encouraging
the development of a rural press to reinforce their
literacy programmes. Ghana and Nigeria, for example,
print weeklies for country areas, mostly in vernacular
languages.
Radio's possibilities in education are being widely
explored. The developing countries are giving priority to
this medium and the more developed countries are
extending its scope.
Almost every South American country now uses radio
as an educational aid. Radio "schools" in Colombia
reach 170,000 elementary school listening groups each day.
The Peruvian government stations as well as 14 inde¬
pendent stations regularly transmit educational pro¬
grammes. Private stations in Chile are required to
broadcast the Ministry of Education's school and popular
educational programmes which are compulsory listening

for all schools. The Argentine Education Ministry uses
the national radio system to broadcast to more than 300
schools daily. In Central American countries, commercial
stations must provide free time for educational broad¬
casts to schools and for public interest, cultural and new
programmes.
Educational programming is a major feature of Asian
broadcasting. Two recently established "radio and TV
universities" in mainland China have enrolled 19,000
college students. All-India Radio has established 2,000
radio farm forums throughout the country and broad¬
casts special programmes to some 18,500 schools. Radio
Pakistan transmits special educational programmes for
adults in local languages from all stations.
Nearly all European countries broadcast to schools and
lay varying emphasis on educational and language pro¬
grammes for the general public. Poland's University of
the Air enrolls some 200,000 student listeners. Denmark
conducts an "Evening High School" and a "Sunday
University". The BBC's London and Far Eastern services
transmit 150 "English by Radio" lessons a week, in the
world's biggest language-teaching operation.
In the United States there arc 187 non-commercial
educational stations operated by universities and state
and municipal authorities.
Educational programmes are broadcast on a regional
basis In the U.S.S.R., and in Australia are received by 94
per cent of schools.
Television is not yet widespread in the developing
countries but those using it give an Important place to
educational programmes. Western Nigeria, for example,
broadcasts three hours dally for schools and finds that
these programmes are widely viewed by the general public
as well. Educational programmes form one-sixth of
Kenya's service. Northern and Eastern Nigeria also
concentrate on educational broadcasts. The Rhodesian
service is under contract to provide school programmes
regularly.
In Chile, all stations are educational and operated by
universities. Venezuela's one government-owned station
broadcasts educational and cultural programmes for about
six hours a day. .¡3

In high-flying aircraft and covering 78,000 square miles

satellites might do on a much larger scale for educational
broadcasting.
Television for schools is receiving increasing attention
in Europe and has been particularly well-developed in
Italy and the United Kingdom. In the U.S.S.R., a high
percentage of viewing time is devoted to educational
programmes for children and adults. The "People's
University" programme offers courses in science and
technology, arts and English.
(ocumentary and educational films have spread
throughout the world and are being produced
In increasing numbers by feature film producers, govern¬
ment agencies, Industrial concerns, foundations and
various non-profit organizations of a cultural, scientific
or educational character. In many countries, the film has
become an accepted part of the school curriculum, some¬
times being used to enrich an already adequate course of
Instruction, sometimes to supplement instruction where
there is a deficiency of textbooks, equipment and qualified
teaching staff. With the aid of mobile units, educational
and documentary films reach audiences previously un¬
influenced by the cinema. Throughout Africa, Asia and

LASE
100 MILLION MESSAGES
ON A BEAM OF LIGHT
¿y ßruno Friedman

Lasers produce a visible light beam one million times more intense than thought of tho same colour emitted
by the sun and offer great promise in many fields. Here a scientist checks a helium-neon gaseous laser.
0|ur modern technology, all aspects of our
highly technical civilization, may be poised for
a forward surge that is unimaginable in scope. All this
is based on the re-stimulation of an old science, the
science of light, by a new device, the "optical maser" or
"laser". So new is this device that is first prototype
was put Into operation less than three years ago.
A laser does this: it produces a narrow beam of light,
which is "monochromatic" of a single, sharply defined
colour or wave lengthrand "coherent", that is, with all
the light waves marching in regular order, like the waves
of a smoothly running sea. Light with these characteris¬
tics has never before been available to man. Being avail¬
able now, it opens the way to major developments in com¬
munications, radar, surgery, power transmission without
lines, and so on. All the possibilities have not even yet
been imagined.
These possibilities are particularly amazing in the field
of communications. A single laser-produced light beam
has inherently the ability to carry all the information
transmitted by all the television stations, radio stations,
teletypewriters, and telephone lines in the world, op¬
erating at the same time. Developing the technical means
to use this amazing message-carrying ability is a major
problem facing scientists; but the first steps have already
been taken. Television pictures and voice messages have
already been experimentally carried on light beams.
Light for communications will come Just In time. The
entire radio spectrum Is already vastly crowded. More¬
over, the demand for additional communications channels
will multiply many times during the next decades.
Lasers were theoretically predicted In the United States
in late 1958 by Dr. C. H. Townes of Columbia University
and Dr. A. L. Schalow of Bell Telephone Laboratories. The
first operating laser, built in 1960 by Dr. T.H. Malman of
the Hughes Aircraft Corporation, was followed rapidly
by others.
The essentials of a laser are simplicity itself. The first
and best-known one, the ruby laser, consists of a synthetic
ruby rod. less than a centimetre in diameter and 10-40 cm.
long. This is surrounded by a tubular lamp, wound around
It In the form of a spiral. Lighting up the tubular lamp
causes a narrow pencil of bright red light to emerge from
one end of the rod. This is the laser beam and It is a
million times more intense than light of the same colour
emitted by the sun. It is visible to the naked eye 40 kilo¬
metres away.
But what happens to the atoms within the ruby rod Is
even more significant. In the planetary model of the atom
electrons revolve in orbits around the atom's central
nucleus. These orbiting electrons can shift to hlgher-

deep red, but scientists hope to
produce other colours such as
blue-green which could be used,
for example, to throw probing
beams into the sea's depths. Ex¬
periments are now being carried
out with a laser using a fluor¬
escent liquid instead of a ruby.

energy orbits, farther away from the nucleus, by absorbing
light. They can also shift back again to their original
orbits, in this case emitting light. The light they absorb
and the light they emit are both of a very specific colour,
though not the same colour.
The ruby is composed of aluminium oxide (alumina) plus
a very small sprinkling of chromium atoms. It is the elec¬
trons in the chromium atoms which do the shifting of
orbits. From the light of mixed colours produced by the
tubular lamp they absorb green light and go to higher-
energy orbits. Some of these higher energy electrons now
spontaneously drop back to their original orbits, emitting
red light. This released red light stimulates other elec¬
trons, which are still in their higher-energy orbits, to fall
back to their original orbits, also emitting red light.
It Is this stimulated release of light which gives the
laser its name, made up of the first letters of the words
"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."
The laser-produced light has the very important charac¬
teristic of "coherence." This means that the waves com¬
posing the light flow In completely regular sequence, like
smoothly running ocean waves. Radio waves have this
coherence. Such regular waves can serve as information
or message carriers. Thus, at the transmitter, the com¬
plete regularity of the carrier waves can be varied electro¬
nically, the variations representing a television picture
or a voice. At the receiver, the variations from complete
regularity of the carrier waves are noted. These varia¬
tions are then transformed back into reproductions of the
original voice or picture.
Coherent light has inherently such great message-
carrying capacity that theoretically millions of messages,
such as television pictures or telephone conversations,
could be imposed on it, rather than merely one message.
This follows from a simple rule: the information capacity
of a carrier is proportional to Its vibration frequency.
Since the frequency of light is something like a hundred
million times as great as that of radio waves, its capacity
for carrying information is correspondingly great.
A laser beam, already extremely narrow, can be con¬
verged even more by lenses. In 1962, scientists of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Raytheon
Corporation sent a beam through a telescope so that it
emerged through the small end to the moon. Here it
made a spot of light only 3 km. in diameter. Laser beams
have also been converged to a fine, hot point by micro¬
scope lenses, making an ultra-fine scalpel to painlessly
remove a tumour from the retina of a human eye.
The original ruby laser emits light In very brief pulses.
For communications purposes a continuous beam will be
required. Such laser beams have already been produced
from gases and from various solid materials. These pro¬
duce light of various frequencies, in the infra-red as well
as in the visible range.
Opening one's Imagination to to-morrow can suggest
remarkable things from laser light. For example, Imagine
a system of communications satellites orbiting the earth.
Properly distributed, Just a few such satellites could relay
all the messages radio, television, cable, telephone
passing between all the continents of the globe, trans¬
mitted on very few light beams.
This fine picture has Haws. For one thing, the extreme
narrowness of the light beams creates problems In aiming
at and hitting a small target. However, electronic com¬
puters will doubtless be able to handle this problem.
More difficult to handle Is the Interference of clouds,
mist, fog, and smoke. This difficulty may be met to some
degree by using Infra-red light, which penetrates clouds
and mist more readily than visible light; also, by locating
light-projecting stations In arid regions, with good year-
round weather conditions; and by having auxiliary stand¬
by stations for times when the main stations are closed
due to bad weather.
Another possibility Is to send the laser beams along the
ground through wave guides, which are simply pipes
enclosing a vacuum. Repeater stations located on the
wave guides at Intervals, say, every 100 km., will amplify
the partially faded light beam and re-transmit It to the
next repeater station.
It is easy to imagine such wave guides running across
continents, with a single beam In the guide serving as the
equivalent to hundreds of thousands of telephone cables.
Laser light may be used for communications with colo¬
nies on the moon or on planets or with men in spacecraft
or between spacecraft. But the problems of aiming and
getting sufficient power output from a laser must be met,
for adequately powerful continuous-beam lasers do not yet
exist. It may also be noted that the tightness of the laser
beam has certain other characteristics. It will be impossi¬
ble, for example, either to Intercept messages or to Jam
transmissions.

GLASS-MAKING

burial cave on Mount Carmel.
C Keren Hayesod, Jerusalem
he period covered in this article extenas irom
the first recorded references to glass-making
on the Phoenician coast in the 15th century B.C., until the
ancient industry was brought to an end in the 15th cen¬
tury A.D. by the Mongol invasion which destroyed the
ancient patterns of life all over the Middle East.
No matter to what sources one turns for enlightenment
on the origins of glass-making, whether legend, mythology
or history, one is invariably brought back to the Phoeni¬
cian coast. Archaeology too corroborates that the area,
which in ancient times extended south of the bay of
Acco (Acre) and north of Byblus, was active in the manu¬
facture of glass from a very early period.
This Ls not surprising, when one realises that the ori¬
gins of glass-making are tied up with the beginnings of
metallurgy. From 2,600 B.C. onwards, the narrow strip of
Canaan known as Phoenicia was acting as a long bridge
between Mesopotamia, the cradle of technology, and
Egypt, the ever-open market for goods, ideas and crafts¬
men. It was no one-way traffic. The glass industry, like
that of the bronze, ivory, dyeing and textile industries,
was subject to a constant interplay of Influences and
stimuli between Mesopotamia and Egypt, as sometimes
one country was in the ascendency, and sometimes the
other.
It may never be possible to ascertain whether or not the
craft of glass-making actually originated at the mouth of
the Belus. Nevertheless, it remains a fact that the oldest
traditions of glass-making that have come down to us
are centered on this mysterious little river, today called
the Naaman, In Western Galilee.
The classic association of the River Belus with glass-
making is to be found in Pliny's Natural History. Pliny
has been so maligned and so misquoted that it is
worth giving his perfectly reasonable statement in full.
It has been taken from the 1962 translation by Elchholtz
in the Loeb Classical Library, Book XXXVI.190.
"That part of Syria which is known as Phoenicia and
borders on Judea contains a swamp called Candebla on
the lower slopes of Mt. Carmel. This ls believed to be the
source of the River Belus, which, after traversing a dis¬
tance of five miles, flows Into the sea near the colony of

are unwholesome to drink, although they are regarded as
holy for ritual purposes.
"The river is muddy and flows in a deep channel, reveal¬
ing Its sands only when the tide ebbs. For it is not until
they have been tossed by the waves and cleansed of
Impurities that they glisten. Moreover, it is only at that
moment, when they are thought to be affected by the
sharp, astringent properties of the brine, that they become
fit for use. The beach stretches for not more than half a
mile, and yet for many centuries the production of glass
depended on this area alone.
"There is a story that once a ship belonging to some
traders in natural soda (natron, an Egyptian product) put
in here and that they scattered along the shore to pre¬
pare a meal. Since, however, no stones suitable for

supporting their cauldrons were forthcoming, they rested
them on lumps of soda from their cargo. When these
became heated and were completely mingled with the
sand on the beach a strange translucent liquid flowed
forth in streams; and this, it is said, was the origin of
glass."
Pliny takes no responsibility for the story about the
origins of glass-making. He is merely repeating what was
"common knowledge" among the Greeks for centuries
before his time. This story may well be one of the many
travellers' tales circulated after the Greeks began their
contact with Egypt in the 7th century B.C. For it is from
Egyptian sources that we have the first documented In¬
dications of glass-making on the Phoenician coast.
They were not writing about glass as such, unfortun¬
ately. Glass merely makes its appearance incidentally, as
part of the vast booty which the Pharaohs of the 18th
Dynasty began to bring back from Syria and the Lebanon
after Tuthmoses Ill's dramatic capture of Megiddo in the
15th century B.C. The lists of items, and their places of
origin were engraved on the walls of the temple of Amen-
Re, at Karnak, where Tuthmoses deposited his booty.
From the Phoenician coast came "green stone, every
costly stone of the country, and many stones of 'sparkle'..."
The latter is a mysterious hieroglyph referring to a costly
stone, and having a fire determinative. In other words,
a "molten stone."
This sparkling molten stone must have been a translu¬
cent glass, and of a type peculiar to Phoenicia, for we
have other references to glass as it was known in those
days; namely, the blocks and pieces of "artificial lapis
lazuli from Babylon" which the chiefs of Assur and Shi-
nar sent to Tuthmoses III as Indications of their good will.

TREASURES
IN THE SAND
The oldest traditions of
glass-making seem to be
linked with the banks of
the Belus, a little river today
called the Naaman, in wes¬
tern Galilee. Pliny, the Ro¬
man naturalist, relates that
some merchants encamped
on the sands of the River
Belus placed their cooking
pots on blocks of soda and
that the heat from the fires
fused the sand and the soda
to form glass. What is
known for a fact is that
the ancient Syrian glass-
makers found the sands in
this area ideal for their
work. Left, the former

and Syria. They reached their highest development and
eventually declined within the 200 years that the Egyp¬
tians used the Phoenician harbours as bases from which
to keep the annual tributes of precious commodities, arti¬
ficers and slaves flowing from the merchant princes of
Canaan.

the Pharaohs set up shrines to their own gods and monu¬
ments to themselves alongside the local sacred sites. The
closeness of Egyptian contacts with the River Belus is
seen in the Memnon monument, a statue in honour of
Amenophls III, which was still standing at the mouth of
the Belus in the 1st Century A.D., when Josephus men¬
tions it. Perhaps it resembled the two colossal statues of
this self-aggrandizing monarch which can be seen today
on the plain West of Thebes.
The Egyptians did further honour to the sacred, glass-
sand-producing river of the Canaanites by giving it the
same name as their holy Nile. "Sehor" they called it.
which means the water of Horus. This Ls the Shlhor
Livnat" which we find cited in the Dlble as the border
between the tribes of Asher and Zcbulun.
Glass to the ancients had a deeply mystic slgniilcance.
The glass paste, therefore, the objects made from them,
and the beautiful but limited range of colours Introduced
into them, were so highly valued because of their reli¬
gious significance. The place where the Item was made,
or even where the sand came from, would be part of its
mystic value. It Ls not necessary to go Into the O.slrls-
Adonis cults which were associated with the River Belus
to understand how the processes of glass-making would
be taken to symbolize the soul's transformation Into beau¬
tiful, Imperishable life, after the dross of the body had
been purified by the flames. Nor why the superstitious
would feel that a jar of this magically-tinted glass in the
tomb with them was an assurance of Immortality.
The formative period in glass-making In Egypt was
under Amenophls II, who followed up his father's cam¬
paigns in the Lebanon, returning with more treasures and
slaves. Supplies from the Phoenician coast were vastly
augmented by grandson Amenophls III. from whose
reign, and that of his son, Akhenaten of Tel Amarna fame,
we have the most plentiful supplies of ancient Egyptian
glass.
Like the other imported treasures, the glass, In whatever
form it came, and the enslaved artificers, would be sent to
the temple of the god. or to the mortuary temple of the
Pharaoh himself. There would be small workshops
attached to the temples, for we find the high priest of
Memphis bearing the title "director of the glass factory."
It ls interesting to speculate whether among the slaves
who escaped from Egypt with the Children of Israel were
descendants of those craftsmen which the Illustrious 18th
Dynasty records having brought in such quantities from
Phoenicia over a period of 200 years.

GLASS-MAKING (Cont'd)
Fiery furnaces of Babylon
the River Belus, that we find the first reference to glass-
making In the Bible.
This is In Deuteronomy 33, which records the blessing
which Moses bestowed on each of the tribes before his
death. In Verse 19 the seafaring tribe of Zebulun, here
linked with that of Issachar, is assured that "they shall
suck of the abundance of the sea, and of treasures hid
in the sand."
The Mldrash, which Ls a collection of oral legends,
derived from many sources and going back to remotest
antiquity, elaborates on this. Zebulun, it is related, once
complained to the Holy One: "Lord of the Universe, to
my brethren you gave beautiful land, and to me you gave
the sea. To my brethren you gave fields and vineyards,
and to me you gave sand." To which He answered: "Yes,
but did I not give you the snail (the purple murex) ? Did
I not give you glass?"
Although traditions older than recorded history are
embodied in the Blessings of Moses, it is, nevertheless,
possible to extract certain facts. The noted Biblical exe-
gete, the late Prof. Robert Pfeiffer, has ascertained that
the blessings in Deut. 33 were recorded during the time
that the Northern Kingdom was at the height of its power
and prosperity under Jeroboam II (785-746). Archaeology
reveals that industries of various kindsamong them the
dyeing Industry which, from later Hebrew writings, appears
to have been associated with glass-making as a village
craft flourished exceedingly at this period. This would
suggest that glass-making was one of the industries of the
prosperous Israelites at the time when the Northern King¬
dom was finally absorbed by the Assyrians in 721 B.C.
Glass-makers, then, would be among the varieties of
craftsmen taken into exile to enhance the splendour of the
Assyrian capitals.
Were any of these captive glass-makers from the King¬
dom of Israel, or their descendants, among the craftsmen
who produced the highly developed recipes collected in
Assurbanlpal's library at Nineveh, on the- banks of the
Tigris, some 50 years later? For the time being, one
cannot say.
Assurbanipal (668-626), one of the last of the great
Assyrian kings, caused to be collected in his capital copies
and translations of every Important book (clay tablet) to
be found in the temple cities of Mesopotamia. These
tablets included magical spells for every occasion, treatises

on medicine, chemistry, geology, etc. Among them were
recipes for making varieties of coloured, gold, and clear
glass. There were also instructions to the glass-makers
regarding the type of fuel to use, and the manipulation of
the furnace.
The Assurbanipal tablets are the earliest literary record
of the plant and processes of glass-making. As they are
copies, they probably date back much earlier. They reveal
a highly developed and unsuspected glass industry in
Mesopotamia in the 7th century B.C., some four hundred
years after Egypt had faded out of glass history. There
is another aspect which is very important for our know¬
ledge of how this Industry developed In antiquity.
The tablets reveal, relate Prof. R.J. Forbes, in "Studies
in Ancient Technologies" that "by the 7th century
glass furnaces had developed considerably in Mesopotamia,
and the glass-workers had gone a long way in the battle
for sustained and intense heat. Here in Mesopotamia
we must see the origin of the reverbatory furnace which
is the pre-condition of glass-blowing."
In other words, when they learned how to make a

furnace that could maintain a high enough temperature,
the glass-makers were able to bring their glass batch to a
state of liquifaction where It could be blown into a variety
of shapes, Instead of merely being wound round a core,
or pressed into a mould as previously.
The final development of the Babylonian glass furnaces
must have taken place somewhere on the Phoenician coast,
for it is here, some 500 years later, that the history of
glass-blowing begins. The time lag fits in well with the
fact that in the pre-scientific age, the average time-span
for new technological developments was about 500 years.
A clue as to how these techniques came from Babylonia
to the Phoenician coast can be found in the Bible.
When the Persians, under Cyrus and Darius, became
the conquerors of the Middle East, they "turned again the
Captivity of Zion" (Psalms 126). The returning exiles
brought with them new ideas, new methods of writing (the
Hebrew script used today), new art forms, and new techni¬
ques acquired during their sojourn in the great cultural
centres of the ancient world. Some of these exiles must
have been glass-makers who returned to the traditional
centres along the Phoenician coast.
The Bible does not refer to the return of these Northern
exiles, because the books of Nehemia and Ezra were
written by and are concerned almost solely with the doings
of the priestly caste centred in Jerusalem. But one can
find references to them, the simple people, the craftsmen,
in later Hebrew writings, such as the Mishnah and the
Talmud, which deal with the laws pertaining to the
everyday life of the people, not only within the confines
of the Holy Land, but also in the neighbouring areas, such
as Tyre and Sidon, or wherever there was a community
large enough to maintain a synagogue.
The return of craftsmen to the Phoenician coast may
have begun during the time of Darius (521-485). The
Bible reports that he encouraged a further return of Baby¬
lonian exiles. And it was he who began to co-ordinate
the great Persian Empire by establishing new trades,
industries and methods of commerce. He aimed at de¬
veloping the economic structure of his own country, up to
then a backwater, and to create means of exchange for
the Greek products which the Persians wanted.
Certainly the harbours along the Phoenician coast took

on new life after the Persian conquest and so did glass-
making. The majority of the pre-blown vessels to be seen
in museum collections belong to this period from the
6th to the 4th centuries B.C. While similar In many
respects to the beautiful cosmetic jars of Egypt's 18th
Dynasty, they are in reality quite different from them
(and often inferior in colour and form to those made
almost 1,000 years earlier).
Achziv, a point on the Phoenician coast some 35 km.
south of Tyre and some 16 km. north of the great natural
harbour of Acco, must have been one of the centres of
glass-making at this time. Although recorded references
to it are sketchy, since it was always overshadowed by
Acco on the one side, and Tyre on the other, nevertheless
Achziv was an important town from early history, and the
remains of an ancient harbour are still to be seen there.
Was this one of the old glass-making centres to which
the Babylonian exiles returned? There ls some evidence
to support this belief. The Mishnah refers to Achzib
(Chezib) as that part "which they that came up from
Babylon in the time of Ezra occupied." And archaeological
finds indicate glass-making in that area from the Persian
period, through the Hellenistic, early Roman, Byzantine
and Islamic periods. Apart from the glass fragments
scattered everywhere in the area, and some glass slag,
complete vessels from Achziv can be found in museums
and private collections in Israel, and elsewhere. (In par¬
ticular, the Haifa Museum of Ancient Art has a collection
of B.C. 6th-4th century sand-core vessels all very similar

Products renowned from Gaul to China

the others "from the Phoenician Coast").
Tyre would certainly have been a centre of glass-making
during the period of 400 years or so that it took for the
Imported Babylonian furnace techniques to develop into
the glass-blowing stage which ushered in the first golden
age of glass at the beginning of the Christian Era.
However, until Crusader times, records mention only Sldon.
This may be due to the fact that during the Persian
period, from which time we begin to get direct references
to glass-making on the Phoenician coast, Sidon superseded
Tyre as the leading city of Phoenicia. The type of many-
coloured ungüentarla or perfume bottle which is charac¬
teristic of the Persian period was widely distributed by
Greek traders together with their Attic pottery. Later,
they distributed the mould-pressed and lathe-turned
vessels which were found In the most far-flung areas of
the ancient world during the Hellenistic period. Sidon
was probably their chief port of call along the Phoenician
coast, and it ls Indeed the Greeks who made Sldon syno¬
nymous with glass-making, with the Phoenicians, and with
Phoenicia in general.
By the time the Romans came to the Middle East
that Is, around 63 B.C., Phoenicia was widely famed for its
glass and glass-makers. That is not to say that they were
making the most beautiful glass in the ancient world.
The Alexandrian glass-makers were doing that. From
Alexandria came the rich gem-like pastes, the vessels
carved like rock crystal, and the millefioris. This profit¬
able trade in imitation of the fabulous precious and semi¬
precious stones of India and the nearer East which reach¬
ed the Roman market via Alexandria, kept the Egyptian
glass-makers tied to their static cutting and moulding
processes. This left the Phoenician glass-makers free, in
fact eager, to experiment with competitive techniques.
This brings us to the greatest single advancement in the
history of glass-making: the blowing iron, which has been
rated one of the great discoveries of mankind.
It has been put with admirable conciseness by Mr. W.A.
Thorpe, author of "English Glass": "Inflation was de¬
veloped in Syria, probably at Sldon, about the third to
first centuries B.C. It was a commercial development by
a commercial people, who wished to enlarge the usefulness
of their wares. The Pax Romana gave them their chance,
and they took it, and they kept it. When they first made
sale for the new wares, the industrial world was still
clinging to Greek routine. For a time Sidon manufac¬
turers were tied to shapes and patterns which did not
emerge from Syrian glass processes or from the Syrian
mind . . . When they blew free, glass became a new art."
By "Greek routine" Mr. Thorpe refers to the
vessels made by blowing glass Into moulds
imitating the shapes and decoration popular in vessels
of other materials. For the first time mass production
of decorated glass became possible as this new process
replaced the tedious work of the older artists.
"Hallmarks" were introduced by these enterprising
master craftsmen of the Phoenician coast. Vessels
¡stamped with names like Aristón, Artas, Jason, and Ennion
of Sldon became known all over the Roman world. The
names were Greek, because Greek names and language
had been fashionable since Alexander's conquest 300 years
earlier.
Ennion ls one of those who is believed to have migrated
26 to Italy, or possibly to have set up a branch there. He is
the most famous of the glass-makers, and each of the
handful of pitchers and vessels signed with his name fetch
several thousand dollars today. Their appeal is only to
the connoisseur. The static pressed designs in rather
lifeless blue or amber glass look much like our cheaper
type of machine-moulded glass, which, fundamentally, is
only a sophisticated modification of the ancient process
Invented in Sldon.
Strabo, who actually visited the area in 25 B.C., verified
Sidon's early importance as a glass-making centre by
adding that the sand of the Belus was taken there to be
"cast" into glass. Twenty-five years after the latest date
for the discovery of glass-blowing, Strabo does not appear
to know that a revolution had taken place in the art of
glass-making.
Sldon would probably have had a large-scale factory-
type of production. But not all the glass would have been
produced under such circumstances. Home industries must
have been the order of the day rather than the exception,
and many of the vessels exported from Tyre and Sidon
would have been collected by itinerant merchants going
from house to house. There is a charming picture in
Proverbs XXXI. 2412 of the woman of worth who "maketh
fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the
merchant." In the original Hebrew, the word "Ca-
naanite" is used, not "merchant". "Canaanite" has a dual
use in Biblical times, meaning both the inhabitants of
Canaan (which Included the Phoenicians), and those who
dealt in trade.
IIt is the cottage type of industry which is so
vividly illuminated in the Hebrew laws and
regulations compiled in Galilee during the first centuries
of the Christian Era. They -cover almost every aspect
of the industry, from the different types of ovens and
furnaces, to the sale of the finished items. There must
have been a phenomenal production of glass in Palestine
at that period, judging from the fragments which one
finds in every ploughed field, with endless variations on
the theme of the glass-thread decoration. Slag from glass
furnaces of the Mishnaic period (from the 2nd to the 5th
centuries A.D.) are comparatively plentiful as well. The
writer, without making any particular effort, has collected
specimens of glass slag from eight sites, six of them in
the area of the Phoenician coast.
Among the items made out of glass wejre plates, bowls,
wine and water flasks, trays, pickle and preserve jars, cups,
pitchers, vases, perfume bottles, cosmetic jars, milk
funnels, urinals, feeding bottles, glass spoons, mirrors,
funerary urns, coffins, trays, architectural decorations,
including pillars; bracelets, beads, rings.
Like the earlier vessels, the blown glass travelled to
Gaul, South Russia, India and China. Presumably it was
In the inevitable clay jar that this fragile cargo was
transported by ship, by donkey, or by camel caravan. As
Mr, Thorpe traces in the introduction and early chapters
of "English Glass," the glass-makers of the Phoenician
coast followed their markets to Italy and Gaul, laying the
foundation of a European glass industry which bore the
marks of their ancient origins right into the 16th century.
These glass-makers spread throughout Asia as well. All
traditions associated with glass-making in the countries
of the East, including India and China, claim "Syrian"
origins.
In spite of the changes which took place in Palestine
and Syria after the Moslem conquest in the 7th century,
there appears to have been no cessation of glass-making
on the Phoenician coast.
Tyre regained its supremacy. William of Tyre in the
12th century refers both to the fine sand and the many

beautiful vessels famous for their transparency which
were "carried to far distant places and easily surpass all
products of the kind..."
Benjamin of Tudela also writes about Tyre in the 12th
century. He describes it as having a magnificent port,
frequented by traders "from all parts," adding: "About
400 Jews reside in this excellent place . . . (they) are
shipowners and manufacturers of the far-renowned
Tyrian glass ..." In Sidon he found some 20 Jewish inha¬
bitants, who were glass-makers, and in Antloch about 10.
By this time Damascus had become the centre of a new
development in the Eastern glass industry, the richly
enamelled Saracen glass beakers and mosque lamps. But
the Belus was still an important source of sand, Sir J.
Mandeville recording, during a trip to Palestine in 1322,
that "Men comen fro fer watre be shlppes and be londe
with cartes, to fetchen of that gravelle."
The Venetians provided shipping, services and supplies
for the Crusades. In return they secured special privi¬
leges and quarters on the East Mediterranean coast. By
1124, at the height of Crusading success, they were firmly
established in Jerusalem, Acre, Sldon, and particularly
in Tyre. Raw materials together with craftsmen were
exported to Venice, and as early as 1224 there was à glass-
blowers' guild there.
When Tamerlane took Damascus In 1401 and virtually
extinguished the Syrian glass Industry by deporting its
craftsmen to Samarkand, Venice replaced the East as the
world's centre of fine glass-making, although it was some
two centuries before Venice could begin to rival the wares
of Syria.
Anita Encle is a Canadian-born writer now living in
Israel. The above article is a summary of the independent
research she has been doing for the past ten years on the
history and origins of ancient glass, which is to be
incorporated into a forthcoming book tentatively entitled
"Cracked About Glass." This will be a Mediterranean-
wide survey of ancient centres of glass-making, particu¬
larly those areas whese glass-making is still carried on in
the ancient manner.

AMAZING
MODERN
GLASS
If any of us have tended to take
glass for granted the photos on
this page should help to set us
straight about its amazing
versatility. Thanks to modern
research glass is now not only
shatter-proof and heat-resistant but
can be made as soft and smooth
as silk or as hard as steel. Right,
a glass tube so tough it can
hammer a nail into a block of wood.

Though traditionally an insulating

No wires are needed. A film of
metallic oxide 20 millionths of
an inch thick is bonded to the glass
and conducts current as easily as a

CYPRUS Byzantine frescoes

CYPRUS
Mediterranean
The Island of Cyprus has been an inde¬
pendent republic since August 16, 1960.
One hundred and forty miles long by sixty
miles wide, it has nearly 600,000 Inhabitants,
of whom 100,000 live in Nicosia, the capital.
The majority of its population comprises two
main groups: people of Greek and Turk¬
ish descent. Although chiefty agricultural,
Cyprus has important mining deposits, parti¬
cularly of gypsum and copper. Situated at
a Mediterranean cross-roads used by many
great civilizations of antiquity, Cyprus
became a melting pot in which artistic tra¬
ditions from Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Greece
and Rome flowed and mingled. Cyprus is
the only United Nations member state
whose own outline an island silhouette in
gold appears as an emblem on its flag.
I t was not until 1931 that a systematic survey of paintings
and mosaics In Cyprus revealed the full extent of the
Island's artistic heritage. Carried out under the direction of the
Byzantine Museum In Athens, it paved the way for a restoration and
preservation campaign that ls still in progress.
The mosaics and frescoes In the churches of Cyprus are not merely
works of great beauty; they are the record of an artistic development
closely linked with historical events on the island.
Down the centuries Cyprus has known many rulers and been subject¬
ed to many Influences. On the division of the Roman Empire It
became a Byzantine province. From the 7th century onwards It
experienced Arab Invasions, and Byzantine authority was not restored
until 965 A.D. From the 13th to the early 16th century the island
was ruled first by the French dynasty of the Luslgnans and. from
1489, by the Republic of Venice. It fell to the Ottoman Empire in
1571. Social upheavals and new cultural patterns all left some
Imprint on the art of Cyprus, but never managed to efface Its original
Byzantine characteristics.
The Island was slow to recover from the effects of the Arab Inva¬
sions. Mosaic decoration, In fact, never revived, but the art of
fresco painting came to Ufe once more and developed vigorously
throughout mediaeval times. One of the Island's medlseval monu¬
ments is the Hermitage of St Neophytus. Here, near Paphos, this
cave-dwelling Cyprlot recluse lived for half a century from 1159 A.D.

Little-known
masterpieces of art
Among the frescoes on the walls of his cell is one signed by Theo¬
dore Apseudes, one of the earliest Byzantine painters known by
name.
As long as Cyprus, under Luslgnan rule, remained linked to the
Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Cypriot painters were subjected
to the influence of their Latin overlords. Later, with the Venetian
regime, orthodox church decoration increasingly absorbed Renais¬
sance elements. But the Cypriot fresco painters always preserved
much of the Byzantine style of which, in its purest form, Cyprus
possesses such fine examples.
A new album In the Unesco World Art Series, "Cyprus: Byzantine
Mosaics and Frescoes" has been devoted to these still little-known
masterpieces of art; 32 full-page colour reproductions present works
executed between the 6th and the 15th centuries. This album, the
20th in the Series, is published by the New York Graphic Society by
arrangement with Unesco. Printed in Italy by Amilcare Plzzi, Mi¬

photo of one of the three statues
composing the monument to Henry
M. Stanley at Leopoldville. As the

EAST-WEST CONTACTS
Sir,
Congratulations on the excellent
articles, "Orient-Occident: A Study in
Ignorance" (April 1963 issue).
I always find The Unesco Courier
interesting and instructive. Your pub¬
lication is certainly . playing a vital
role by giving its readers a wealth of
enlightening information. East-West
understanding is very important for
world peace. In this regard, I believe
correspondence helps us a great deal.
I suggest people in the West write
more to those in the East and vice
versa.

THE MITTENWALD TRADITION
Sir,
The article by Claude Marly, "Mus¬
ic on a String" (Sept. 1962) provided
a glimpse of the nature and history
of stringed-instrument making, but
omitted a number of facts which
should be stated. For example, the
wood for the resonant box (Picea
excelsa) is found not only in Switzer¬
land, but all over the Upper Alps, the
most prized being the spruce fir of
Upper Bavaria. This was an import¬
ant factor in the development of ins¬
trument-making at Mittenwald.
Much has been written about violin
varnish and in particular about its so-
called secret composition which has
no doubt greatly impressed authors
and readers alike. However, I would
say that it is not the nature of the
composition of the ancient Italian
varnish that has been lost, but under¬
standing and knowledge concerning
the organic, natural varnish and its
ageing. This has been lost little by
little as the craft became more com¬
mercialized, to the detriment of the
creative spirit of instrument-making.
Your article also omitted to mention
stringed instrument-making in Ger¬
many, its impact in 14th-century
Europe and its most flourishing period
in the 15th century. From Füssen
it spread far and wide and led to
instrument-making in Mittenwald
"The Cremona of Bavaria" as it has
often been called.
In the time of the great Jacobus
Steiner and the master instrument
makers of the Klotz family, the achie¬
vements of Mittenwald represented,
both in Germany and neighbouring
countries, the acme of instrument-
making. The sonority of Mitten-
wald's violins corresponded exactly to
the tastes and ideals of that period.
In a historical context, German string¬
ed instrument-making is thus placed
between the Italian and the French.
There was no reference to Mitten¬
wald in your article, which, to give
the complete picture, should also have
mentioned Markneukirchen in Saxony,
the Czech production centres, and the
new German centre of Bubenreuth.
Austria, the Netherlands and Switzer¬
land have had individual master-crafts¬
men, but no recognized centres of
stringed instrument production.
Today, Mittenwald is no longer a
great production centre but its school
of instrument-making, which has
existed for over a century, maintains
the tradition and draws young student

craftsmen from all parts of the world.
The teaching is based on international
experience and knowledge in instru¬
ment-making, and is constantly adapt¬
ed and modernized. The school aims
to restore to instrument-making the
brilliance and perfection conceived by
the great masters of the past.

HOW MANY ESPERANTISTS ?
Sir,
In "One Language for the World"
(Nov. 1963 issue) Professor Mario Pei
says that something like eight million
people speak Esperanto. This is far
more than the most optimistic estima
tes. In a report submitted to Uni.sco
in 1951, the Universal.! Esperanto
Asocio quoted the already greatly
exaggerated figure of 380,000 F.spe-
rantists. Allowing for the fact that
this association, which includes every
kind of Esperantist, from the most
skilled exponents to the merely inte¬
rested, had 32,660 members on
January 31, 1962, it seems likely that
the world total of people who actually
speak Dr. Zamenhof's language to a
greater or lesser degree can hardly
be more than 55,000 or 60,000.
I\ L.
Villejuif, France
Ed. Notl: Professor Mario Pei
writes: The estimate of eight million
people who, in one fasliion or another,
speak Esperanto, was supplied to me
by the former Secretary of the Espe¬
ranto League of North America.
He staled at tlie time that this was
frankly a very rough estimate, possibly
a little on the optimistic side, based
on unofficial figures from Esperanto
groups all over the world. To my
knowledge, there is no precise census
of Esperanto speakers. The figure,
according to this official, was intended
to include not only registered members
of official Esperanto groups, but also
those not so registered, and those who,
at one time or another, had studied
Esperanto and taken an interest in the
language, even if not in the movement.
On this basis, the figure does not
seem exaggerated. In the United
States, a nation that is certainly not
among those most interested in either
Esperanto or the international language
problem, I have been amazed in ¡he
course of my travels to find Esperanto
groups in all the major cities. In
countries where the movement is much
stronger than it is here {Brazil, Japan,
Holland, the Scandinavian countries,
to mention a few), it stands lo reason
that the number of people interested
must be much larger, ¡low else to
explain the very flourishing Esperanto
literature, and the numerous perio¬
dicals?
In the case of a constructed lan¬
guage like Esperanto, one cannot
speak of "speakers" in the same sense
that one speaks of speakers of national
languages like English or French. I
have devoted considerable attention
and study to Esperanto, but I must
admit that I do not handle it with
anything like the fluency with which
I handle the national languages I
know best (English, French, Spanish,
Italian). At the same time, I feel that
my description applies to me. Really
fluent speakers, who handle Esperanto
with the same facility with which they
handle their own native tongues,
probably come closer to the figures
cited by your correspondent.
At any rate, it must be admitted
that the hypothetical figure of eight
million is only a rough estimate, and
that an actual census of speakers of
the language, even on a limited scale,
has never been taken.

TION: Last year over 520,000 children
were enrolled in Tunisia's elementary
schools an increase of nearly 10% over
the enrolment for 1962. A branch for
teacher training has been set up in every
secondary school to help train the additional
teachers needed for Tunisia's expanding
educational programme which aims to bring
every child of primary school age into the

TELEPHONE FOR THE DEAF

Institute of Technology in Haifa have been
experimenting with a "telephone" which
would enable deaf-and-mute persons to
communicate. The speaker "plays" on
sensitive vibration keys as he would on a
piano, while the listener places his fingers
on a vibration-receiving diaphragm. A
duplicate reversed system enables the
"speaker" to become the "listener". The
language is based on coding the tactile
vibrations, on either a single or multiple
frequency. A three-frequency code, for
instance, makes possible the development
of a language of nearly 5,000. words.

The first known reference to
glass is inscribed on the walls of
the temple of Amen-Re at Karnak
where the Pharaoh Thutmoses III
deposited the treasures he
brought from Syria in the 15th
century B.C. Archaeology has
nowbeenableto confirm the long-
held belief that glass was
manufactured on the Phoenician
coast in far-off times. With a
beauty rivalling that of precious
gems and an infinity of shapes
and colours, glass has given
delicately artistic forms to even
the most everyday objects.
Above, a 14th century Mosque
lamp from Damascus. Right, a
decorated Roman glass vessel.
Far right, from top: a marble
glass vase; an Islamic period
bottle decorated with inscrip¬
tions; a blue jug by Ennion,
a Phoenician master glass-maker
whose works, prized throughout
the Roman world, are still sought
by modern collectors. See p. 20.
