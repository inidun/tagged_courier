22 Nepal
The bathing of the carrots
The economy of Nepal is based essentially on
the cultivation of food crops, and agricultural
produce is the country's main source of export
earnings. In the densely populated valley of
Kathmandu with its warm temperate climate,
the land is intensively farmed, even in winter.
Apart from rice, maize, wheat, potatoes, beans,
onions and other vegetables are grown. Above,
farmers wash carrots in the river Baghmati near
Kathmandu.

lODAY we must proclaim a
bold objective that within a
decade no child will go to bed
hungry, that no family willfear for its next
day's bread, that no human being's future
and capacities will be stunted by
malnutrition..."
What has been achieved in the struggle
against hunger in the ten years that have
elapsed since these brave words were pro¬
nounced at the World Food Conference
held in Rome in 1974?
The opening article of this issue of the
Unesco Courier, based on an independent
assessment by an international group ofex¬
perts, offers a mixed reply. Despite the ad¬
dition to the global population of nearly
one thousand million people, in global
terms ample supplies of cereals are
available today. Nevertheless, chronic
hunger remains a problem for tens of
millions of people.
During thepast decade, Asia, where most
of the world's undernourished people live,
has witnessed a remarkable increase in
agricultural production. In Africa, on the
other hand, food production has fallen
even further behind population needs, par¬
ticularly in the hunger belt that stretches
across the sub-Saharqn region.
For Antoine Dak ouré, the key to redress¬
ing this situation ties in a more dynamic ap¬
proach to development aid, a stiffening of
political resolve to implement agrarian
reform, and a determined effort to gain the
wholehearted involvement of agricultural
workers without which no real change can
occur. This, however, depends upon
political guidelines which only the develop¬
ing countries themselves can decide.
The head of the WorldWatch Institute,
Lester Brown, draws attention to two ma¬
jor problems: the risks involved in the
world's overwhelming dependence on one
region (North America) as a buffer to meet
national shortfalls in grain production and
the alarming annual loss of some 23,000
million tons of topsoil through erosion,
coupled with diminishing returns from ad¬
ditional use of chemical fertilizers.
The first victims of undernourishment
and malnutrition are the children of the
Third World, yet, as V. Ramalingaswami
points out, many of the diseases that afflict
them, such as endemic goitre, nutritional
blindness and anaemia, could be very simp¬
ly and inexpensively controlled. In many
cases, theproblem is one ofsheer ignorance
of the basic facts ofgood nutritional prac¬
tice. In this domain, Unesco's nutrition
education programmes are beginning to
make their impact felt.
Ironically, the vast majority of the
world's undernourished people are to be
found among the ruralpoor and are engag¬
ed in the production of food. As Paul
Lunven of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations sug¬
gests, some rural developmentprojects may
have been placing too much emphasis on in¬
vestment in cash crops, to the detriment of
the food crops on which rural families de¬
pend for their food supply.
On a more optimistic note, Yuri Ovchin-
nikov outlines some of the more promising
achievements in the biological sciences. Re¬
cent scientific advances are makingpossible
higher crop yields and new and far more
productive strains of livestock.
Finally, two broader observations
emerge from this assessment of the world
food situation. The first is that the coun¬
tries ofthe world are now so interdependent
that only through international action can
poverty and hunger be defeated. The sec¬
ond is that so long as one man, woman or
child goes hungry, the scandalous waste of
resources on armaments' brings added
shame upon us all.

THE United Nations World Food Conference, held in Rome
in 1974, represented a bench-mark in thinking about
the global food system. The immediate threats of
famine in the Indian sub-continent and the African Sahel, coupl¬
ed with the drawdown of world reserves to their lowest levels
in twenty-five years and corresponding increases in food j
prices, shocked the international community into a mood of
serious concern and reappraisal.
The first and overriding assumption in the minds of many
delegates in 1974 was that the world was entering a period of
tight food supplies brought about by population growth,
without a cushion of large reserves, and that mass starvation
was a distinct possibility. Demand was in danger of outpacing
available supplies in the developing regions, especially in Asia.
At the same time, demand for grain and meat was expanding
in higher-income developing countries.
In these circumstances, the major food-producing countries
would not be able to produce enough grain to meet the demand;
nor did it appear likely that such large projected import re¬
quirements could even be transported, assuming foreign ex¬
change to pay for them. Moreover, since the balance of supply
and demand would at least be close, with little surplus, recur¬
rent food crises were more likely, given climatic variability and
man-made disruption. Therefore, new international
mechanisms were needed to ensure adequate food supplies.
The answer proposed to the world food problem was essen
¡ally increased agricultural production in the food-deficit
developing regions. Increased production would mean greater
food self-reliance and less dependence on trade. There was
reasonable confidence about the technical means to increase
production in the food-deficit regions, if sufficient priority and
resources to agriculture could be allocated and maintained.
Hence there was an implicit optimism at the World Food Con¬
ference, at least in the rhetoric, that with increased production
in food-deficit areas the worst aspects of hunger could be
eradicated in a decade and the threat of starvation could be vir¬
tually eliminated.
Great emphasis was placed on mobilizing the political will
necessary to keep food issues in the forefront. To maintain
political momentum, special follow-up and oversight bodies
were created, including the World Food Council, the FAO Com- 1
mittee on World Food Security, and the Committee on Food Aid
Policies and Programmes. There was also the feeling that inter¬
national agreements were needed in order to establish a system
of nationally-held food reserve capabilities and to ensure ade¬
quate food aid levels in times of emergencies and local produc¬
tion shortfalls. .
The fear of another period of rising prices prompted a concern
for expanding agricultural production to promote food self-
sufficiency ("zero imports") and for negotiating international
reserves and food aid agreements that could protect low-
income countries from natural or man-made disasters, high
prices, or political vulnerability due to dependence on large food
imports. Hence, food security was implicitly identified with
commercial food prices and physical availability and less with
demand and consumption issues regarding poor people or nutri¬
tionally vulnerable groups.
By 1 984 many of the assumptions emanating from the 1 974
Conference have proved to be ill-founded, or have developed in
circumstances different from those originally anticipated. No

doubt, the major assumption that has not been borne out was
that the world was entering a period of tight food supplies
globally, and hence rising prices. à . .
After a slow start in 1975, the years 1976, 1977 and 1978
witnessed a substantial recovery in cereal production and in the
levels of reserves held by the major grain producers. Total
world production fell below aggregate consumption in 1979
and 1980, with a resulting drawdown in reserves; but bumper
world production levels in 1981 and 1982 brought in record
surpluses and the lowest real market prices for cereals in 30
years.
Despite such variability in grain crop production perfor¬
mance, market adjustments were made fairly smoothly after
1 974, even without an effective International Wheat Agree¬
ment in place. Demand for grain-fed livestock grew rapidly in
the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and some middle-income
developing countries. During the decade, trade in coarse grains
increased fourfold, yet supplies proved more than ample to
handle this demand.
In the decade after the World Food Conference, the net addi¬
tion to global population has been approaching one billion peo¬
ple. Much of this increase has taken place in those countries or
regions known for acute food problems, but this has not led to
any strain on the world food situation. On the contrary, by
1 984 the world cereal situation was similar to that of the early
1970sample supplies at the global level, depressed grain
prices, and unmarketable production in North America and the
European Community, f . ', £
While the threat of rising international food prices has not
been borne out during the decade, international agricultural
trade has been marked by the disruptive influence of interna¬
tional market instability.
The decade has also witnessed a clearer understanding of the
nature and extent of malnutrition. The "hunger problem" is no
longer perceived to be one of starvation or protein deficiency,
but rather of chronic undernutrition, affecting a range of
vulnerable groups whose common bond is their poverty. As
called for in 1 974, the potential for mass famine has been large¬
ly eliminated given the willingness of a stricken country to ac¬
cept assistance. The international response process has made
notable improvements. Relief supplies, both domestic and in¬
ternational, have been mobilized for the large majority of
emergency situations during the decade, most of which were
local in character and the result of man-made disasters and en¬
suing refugee movements.
Despite these improvements, chronic hunger is still a stag¬
gering problem for tens of millions of people. Reaching them
as opposed to disaster or famine victims has proved to be a
much more intractable task than many imagined in 1974.
It is now realized that the hungry are closely linked to their
particular food- and labour-market conditions and to the impact
of changing technologies on their societies. Ironically, the
undernourished are often engaged in the production of food.
Overall, the focus of international concern about food and
hunger problems has slowly shifted from Asia to Africa. Asia,
as a whole, has made rapid strides in increasing agricultural pro¬
duction; and dependency on imported cereals has been reduc¬
ed, although Asia still has the largest absolute number of poor
and chronically undernourished. Africa, on the other hand,
seems to be living out the 1974 fears. Food production has
fallen well behind population needs, and external food supply
has become increasingly essential. The undernourished in
Africa are now a much higher percentage of total population in
that region than they are in Asia.
Finally it is recognized that overcoming hunger is ultimately
linked to viable employment opportunities and income genera¬
tion, whether in the countryside or in urban areas.

F for a hungry world
by K. Antoine Dakouré
FOR years, the vast problem of hunger
in the world has been the focus of
lengthy debate in various organiz¬
ations at the governmental, non¬
governmental and international levels. A
world conference organized by the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), held in 1974, exposed the
global scale of this drama and provided an
K. ANTOINE DAKOURÉ, of Upper Volta,
has held a number of senior posts in his coun¬
try's government, including those of Minister
of Agriculture, Minister of Planning and Rural
Development and Adviser to the President of
the Republic. President of the Governing
Council of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) in 1973 and Upper
Volta's ambassador to the European

Commission.
opportunity to identify its causes, to
analyse them in depth and to single out
those measures which, it was widely agreed,
could lead to the eradication of hunger
within a decade.
In a noteworthy study entitled
Agriculture: Toward 2000, published three
years ago, the FAO warned all nations of
the deteriorating situation and offered con¬
crete suggestions for controlling hunger ef¬
fectively. Today, however, it must be ad¬
mitted that the plight of the world's under¬
privileged is steadily worsening. Nearly 500
million human beings, stagnating in pover¬
ty, are under daily threat of famine. The
population of the most vulnerable countries
increases by 2.5 per cent a year, whereas the
annual increase in cereal production has
levelled out at 1 per cent. If current trends
continue, requirements for cereal aid,
which totalled 7.6 million tonnes in 1979,
will reach some 21 million tonnes by 1990.
Land resources are very seriously
depleted in many regions. Demographic
pressure, which is responsible for the in¬
creasing over-exploitation of arable land,
the destruction of plant cover and the
damaging effects of extensive grazing, is the
ultimate cause of accelerated desertifica
tion, whose consequences in the medium
term are just as harmful as a nuclear
holocaust. Our planet is threatened by
famine and yet, at the same time, we con¬
tinue to exhaust almost twenty million hec¬
tares of land every year.
Why does the problem seem insoluble
despite all indications that it has been
carefully and perspicaciously analysed?
There are undoubtedly many reasons, the
most serious of which, it would seem, is that
both the developing and the industrialized
nations lack the political courage needed to
implement the measures recommended.
"Even the best rural development projects
designed by experts and backed with all the
material, technical and financial resources
needed, are destined to fall if thefarmers in
whose interest they arepurported to be car¬
ried out do not feel sufficiently concerned
to offer their unreserved participation and
if they lack the assurance that the projects
are for their own benefit".

Citizens of the industrialized nations only
become aware of hunger, of the tragedy af¬
flicting hundreds of millions of human be-
.ings every day, when it reaches catastrophic
proportions, as in the Sahel. Emergency aid
is mustered amid sweeping gestures of
human solidarity in response to these cries
of distress. Interest slackens once steps have
been taken and aid donors can again sleep
with a clear conscience. There is general ap¬
proval of the praiseworthy efforts and
perseverance of the non-governméntal
organizations, but what do these amount to
compared with the enormous potential still
lying dormant?
Governments and political parties should
do more to promote a more dynamic image
of development aid, too often seen as a sim¬
ple act of charity. Too few people seem to
understand that helping their neighbours
progress to the point where they can par¬
ticipate in mutually beneficial exchanges is
certainly one of the most effective ways of
safeguarding their own future. Helping to
increase the purchasing power of the less
fortunate countries would stimulate pro¬
duction and ease the strains of
immigration.
Unfortunately, such an evolution of the
"weaker partner" will remain virtually im¬
possible as long as international economic
relations are subject to the existing system
which was designed by the strong to satisfy
their own needs. The complex of subser¬
vience it induces among the less strong
results inexorably in tensions that threaten
world peace. A starving and impoverished
man is' easily driven to extremes precisely
because he has nothing to lose. As the
popular Turkish saying so aptly puts it: "If
you starve a lamb, he will become a wolf."
If no decisive steps are taken to reverse
current trends whereby the poor grow daily
poorer, social and political tensions, caused
by economic difficulties, exaggerated fur¬
ther by poverty, will certainly have harmful
repercussions on North-South relations.
It is the duty of all mankind to fight to
control poverty and limit its consequences,
for humanitarian reasons, of course, but
also, and above all, to achieve a state of
peace which all living creatures require if
they are to thrive.
The notion that the eradication of hunger
in the world is an international responsibili¬
ty is not new. Considerable efforts already
under way prove that this notion of respon¬
sibility is receiving increasing acceptance;
yet there is no doubt that the scourge of
hunger is still rife, particularly in the rural
areas of Africa, Latin America and the
Near and Far East.
What is to be done? Given the extreme

complexity and diversity of the peoples con¬
cerned, it is impossible to find a single solu¬
tion suited to all countries. However, as the
rural sector is usually the most vulnerable it
is on this sector that we shall concentrate
our attention.
National development plans have almost
always granted the highest priority to the
rural sector, with special emphasis on self-
sufficiency in food. Leaders quickly
become aware of the vanity of their nations'
desire to achieve independence and under¬
take development efforts while their
underdeveloped rural sectors are incapable
of satisfying basic needs and supporting ex¬
pansion in other sectors of the national
economy. Despite this realization, govern¬
ment policies have continued to under¬
estimate the importance of the measures
required.
It is unrealistic to attempt to increase
food production without first considering
all the steps needed to motivate and en¬
courage the main protagonists of
agricultural development. These steps de¬
pend upon political guidelines which only
the countries concerned can determine. At
this stage the developing nations' major
share of the responsibility can be gauged.

Western or Eastern industrialized nations

World trade in agricultural products is
dominated by the developed countries.
Nevertheless, those developing coun¬
tries that lack oil resources are heavily
dependent on agricultural commodities
for their export earnings. On average,
four out of every ten dollars earned from
exports by these countries come from
sales of agricultural, forest and fish pro¬
ducts. Unfortunately, export prices for
many of these commodities have declin¬
ed in real value while the cost and volume
of imports from the developed world
have risen. In 1981, the value of imports
by the developing countries as a whole

decisions of the weaker nations, I do not ac¬
cept outside intervention as an explanation
of all our shortcomings in the area of
agricultural development.
The allocation of resources employed to
execute development plans, which we
ourselves decide, only rarely reflects the
priorities defined in these plans. Further¬
more, we vigorously condemn arms expen¬
ditures which swallow up some five hun¬
dred thousand million dollars every year, or
ten times more than the amount needed to
ensure that no human life be lost for lack of
nourishment, yet our contribution accounts
for 20 per cent of this sum. Many other ex¬
amples could be cited, but this is not the
main point at issue.
We must learn from experience and
systematically avoid repeating our past er¬
rors in order to build a better future. Self-
sufficiency in food is clearly the top priority
goal. Each country is drafting its strategies
according to specific social, economic,
cultural and political criteria. Secondary
goals and steps to be taken are also being
determined. Whilst the funds required
generally fall short of needs, the paucity of
material or financial resources is a doubtful
pretext for mediocre results, as we shall see
below. I shall use the following example to
highlight an observation I feel to be of para¬
mount importance before proposing not a
panacea, but rather a few factors that might
be considered in the quest for solutions.
At the beginning of the 1960s, a group of
experts on a field assignment drafted and
carried out a soil recovery project in the
Sahelian region of Upper Volta. Accurate

measurements and calculations showed that
the erosion caused by a torrential rainstorm
lasting about twenty minutes amounted to
some 14 tonnes of fine topsoil per hectare.
This calculation gave eloquent proof of the
interest of the project, for which farmers
were recruited to help dig small dikes along
contour lines to control rainfall. To the ex¬
perts the value of this laudable project was
evident. Unfortunately, however, the pro¬
moters failed to ensure that the farmers also
understood the advantages it offered them".
Because they were neither consulted nor
paid to maintain the dikes, the farmers soon
lost all interest in the "white man's
ditches". It was only some years later, when
those dikes that had not collapsed controll¬
ed the rainwater flow, bringing more water
to the wells and improving neighbouring
fields, that some of the farmers began to
understand the value of the project. Those
farmers who recognized the benefits to be
obtained requested no financing what-
. soever to repair or rebuild their dikes. *
This experience and many others observ¬
ed in the field provide proof that even the
best rural development projects, designed
by experts and backed with all the material,
technical and financial resources needed,
are destined to fail if the farmers in whose
interest they are purported to be carried out
do not feel sufficiently concerned to offer
their unreserved participation and if they
lack the assurance that the projects are for
their own benefit.
It is important, therefore, to seek
methods of approach that involve farmers
as much as possible rather than insisting on
taking decisions for them and imposing
solutions on them without taking the
precaution of soliciting their opinion. This
is an essential prerequisite to obtaining their .
collaboration. Without the farmers'
wholehearted involvement no profound
changes can take place. Their participation
cannot be obtained by presidential decree
or ministerial decision. Tangible, co¬
ordinated measures are required which will
progressively create a favourable environ¬
ment, working at a pace acceptable to the
farmers and not racing ahead at the speed
of technicians and politicians. The farmer
must be assured that the land he needs as
well as seeds, equipment and other inputs,
of adequate quality, will be made available
to him at the right time and in sufficient
quantity. Furthermore, he must have some
guarantee that, when production begins, he
will not be despoiled of the fruits of his
labour.
Such guarantees, which would certainly
help motivate farmers, imply the following
pre-conditions:
well prepared and carefully executed
agrarian reform to ensure equitable
distribution of farm land;
the restructuring of research methods at
. the national and regional levels in order to
adapt them to local conditions. The concept
of technology transfer must be seriously
revised because the methods currently used
to increase agricultural production,
developed in the North, rarely generate
similar results in the developing countries.
Agronomic research can only respond ade¬
quately to farmers' expectations to the ex-
7

tent that it can be adapted to help solve par¬
ticular local problems. Moreover, since
research entails investment beyond the
possibilities of individual countries, it can
only be truly effective as part of regional co¬
operation schemes;
the granting of tax relief to reduce initial
costs as well as the cost of production
factors;
the institution of an agricultural credit
scheme flexible enough to respond to
farmers' needs and possibly even help them
meet some of their social obligations. These
obligations, generally ignored by official
banking organizations, force farmers to ac¬
cept loans from speculators at exorbitant
rates of interest;
the introduction of measures to
discourage imports, for example, by raising
the price of imported food products;
a more rational organization of the col¬
lection, distribution and marketing of pro¬
duce which would guarantee farmers more
attractive profits.
Naturally, the social aspects of develop¬
ment, education, hygiene, health, culture,
balanced nutrition, the rational use of
water resources and nature conservation
must be given special attention. Of course,
it is most important to fight hunger by in¬
creasing agricultural production, but all
these factors have an undeniable impact on
trends in the rural sector for reasons so ob¬
vious that it is unnecessary to enumerate
them here.
As stressed in the study Agriculture:
Toward 2000, it should be possible to solve
the problem of hunger in the world by the
year 2000. Generally speaking, however,
while considerable emphasis has been plac¬
ed on all the sectoral areas that influence
programme success, I feel that the vital
question has yet to be answered: "What
concrete measures can be taken to create the
motivation essential to progress in the field
of agricultural production?" Unesco and
the FAO could undertake joint initiatives in
order to make a detailed examination of
this question with the appropriate organiza¬
tions in the countries concerned. If the
answer to this question could be found, we
Growing population pressure on limited

should be able to solve the problem of
hunger despite the modest funding
available.
As a first step, food aid, which enables us
to attend to the most urgent cases rapidly,
is a highly positive factor. It can 'help
stabilize food prices and encourage efforts
to increase the quantity and improve the
quality of agricultural production.
However, it must be restricted to these goals
alone and be used only to meet clearly
defined needs.
Beneficiaries and donors of food aid
must ensure that it does not become self-
perpetuating. A prolonged commitment
would constitute a long-term hindrance to
the development of local agricultural
production.
This reservation aside, nobody can deny
that well organized food aid is precious. It
could, however, become a formidable
weapon and a serious threat to peace if the
donor countries were to succumb to the
temptation to use it as a lever in interna¬
tional relations.

Have we reached the end of a growth era in world food output? by Lester R. Brown
AS the world recovered from World
War II, hopes for improvement in
world J agriculture were high. An
accumulating backlog of agricultural
technologies such as hybrid corn and
chemical fertilizers were waiting to be ap¬
plied on a massive scale. Between 1950 and
1973 world grain production more than
doubled, to nearly 1.3 billion tons.
Although output expanded more rapidly in
some regions than in others, all regions
shared in the growth. This rising tide of
food production improved nutrition
throughout the world, helping to boost life
expectancy in the Third World from less
than forty-three years in the early 1950s to
over fifty-three years in the early 1970s.
This period of broad-based gains in
nutritional improvement came to an end in
1973. After the oil price hike that year the
growth in world grain output slowed. Since
LESTER R. BROWN, of the USA, is President
of WorldWatch Institute, Washington, D.C., a
non-profit research organization which was
created to focus attention on global problems
and is funded by private foundations and
United Nations organizations. The present ar¬
ticle has been extracted from "Securing Food
Supplies", a chapter from State of the World
1 984, a WorldWatch Institute report on pro¬
gress toward a sustainable society. The
report, of which Lester Brown was project
, director, monitors changes in the global
resource base (land, water, energy and
biological support systems). It is published by
W. W. Norton and Co., New York and London.
1973 world grain production has expanded
at less than 2 per cent yearly, barely keeping
pace with population. Although the period
since the 1979 oil price hike is too short to
establish a trend, $30-a-barrel oil may well
slow growth further.
In per capita terms world grain output
climbed from 248 kilograms in 1950 to 326
kilograms in 1973, an impressive gain of 31
per cent. Since then, however, annual grain
output per person has remained around 325
kilograms. A global average, this figure em¬
braces countries where yearly grain
availability per person averages only 150
kilograms, requiring that it all be consumed
directly, as well as countries where it ex¬
ceeds 700 kilograms and is largely con¬
verted into meat, milk, and eggs.
Since 1973 attention has focused on the
impact of petroleum prices on food supply,
but demand has also been affected. On the
supply side, rising oil prices have increased
the costs of basic agricultural inputs
fertilizer, pesticides, and fuel for tillage and
irrigation thus acting as a drag on output.
On the demand side of the equation,
escalating oil prices combined with ill-
conceived national economic policies have
contributed to a global economic slowdown
so severe since 1979 that it has brought
world growth in per capita income to a vir¬
tual halt.
Had incomes continued to rise at the
same rate after 1973 as they did before,
prices of food commodities would have
been stronger, thus supporting a more
vigorous growth in farm investment and
output. Agricultural under-investment in
Third World countries has also contributed
to the loss of momentum, but the central
point is that the rise in oil prices, affecting
both food supply and demand; has brought
the era of robust growth in world food out¬
put to an end.
Oil is not the only resource whose ques¬
tionable supply is checking the growth in
food output. The loss of topsoil through
erosion is now acting as a drag on efforts to
produce more food, And the scarcity of
water is also beginning to affect food pro¬
duction prospects. Since World War II, the
world irrigated area has more than doubl¬
ed, but the flurry of dam building of the
past generation has now subsided. With oc¬
casional exceptions, most of the remaining
potential projects are more difficult, costly,
and capital-intensive.
As the demand for food has climbed each
year, the farmers of the world have begun
to "mine" its soils, converting them into a
non-renewable resource. It has been
estimated that erosion on cropland exceeds
new soil formation by 23,000 million tons
peryear and that topsoil reserves will disap¬
pear in about 150 years if steps are not
taken to protect them. Below, cactus being
grown as an anti-erosion measure near the
Ousseltia experimental and demonstration
centre, Tunis.

» The worldwide loss of momentum will
not be easily restored. Although
agricultural mismanagement abounds, it
has not worsened appreciably over the
years. Nor can the situation be explained by
any farmer's loss of skills. The explanation
lies in the more difficult circumstances fac¬
ing farmers everywhere.
The cheap energy that permitted farmers
to override easily the constraints imposed
by the scarcity of land, soil nutrients, or
water is simply no longer available.
Increasingly, the energy used in
agriculture will be in the form of chemical
fertilizer. As population grows, cropland
per person shrinks and fertilizer re¬
quirements climb. And erosion that has
robbed soils of nutrients is forcing farmers
to use more fertilizers. Even urbanization is
raising demand, since as people move to
cities it is harder to recycle the nutrients in
human and household waste. Yet the com¬
bination of rising energy costs and
diminishing returns on the use of additional
fertilizer raises doubts that adequate food
supplies can be produced in the future at
prices the world's poor can afford.
The central importance of the popula¬
tion/land/fertilizer relationship is a recent
phenomenon. Before 1950 increases in food
output came largely from expanding the
cultivated area, but with the scarcity of fer¬
tile new land and the advent of cheap
chemical fertilizer this changed. Between
1950 and 1983 world fertilizer use climbed
from 15 million to 114 million tons, nearly
an eightfold increase within a generation.
In effect, as fertile land became harder to
find, farmers learned to substitute energy
in the form of chemical fertilizer for land.
Fertilizer factories replaced new land as
the principal source of growth in food
production.
This substitution of energy for land is
graphically evident: In 1950, when world
population totaled 2.51 billion, the
harvested area of cereals per person was
0.24 hectares. As growth in population
greatly outstripped that of cultivated area,
the area per person fell steadily, declining to
0.15 hectares by 1983. While the amount of
cropland per person declined by one third,
the fertilizer consumption per person quin¬
tupled, climbing from just over 5 kilograms
in 1950 to 25 kilograms in 1983.
The hybridization of corn and the dwarf¬
ing of the wheat and rice varieties that have
been at the heart of Third World
agricultural advances over the last two
decades figured prominently, of course, in
the growth in world food output. So, too,
did the doubling of irrigated area. But the
effectiveness of all these practices depends
heavily on the use of chemical fertilizer.
Without an adequate supply of plant
nutrients, high-yielding cereal varieties hold
little advantage over traditional ones.
Likewise, an increase in irrigation is of little
consequence if the nutrients to support the
higher yields are lacking.
The response of crops to the use of addi¬
tional fertilizer is now diminishing, par¬
ticularly in agriculturally advanced coun¬
tries. During the 1950s, the application of
another ton of fertilizer on average yielded
1 1.5 more tons of grain. During the sixties,
the fertilizer/grain response ratio was 8.3 to
1. By the 1970s it had fallen to 5.8. Some
10
countries, such as Argentina and India, still
apply relatively little fertilizer and so have
quite high response ratios. But worldwide
the return on the use of additional fertilizer
is on the way down.
At some point, biological constraints on
crop yields will make the substitution of fer¬
tilizer for cropland increasingly difficult
and costly. When this is combined with the
projected long-term rise in real cost of the
oil and natural gas used to manufacture,
distribute, and apply chemical fertilizer, the
difficulty in restoring the steady upward
trend in per capita grain production of
1950-73 becomes clear.
With grain, as with oil or any other basic
resource, excessive world dependence on
one geographic region for supplies is risky.
As the North American share of world
grain exports has increased it has surpassed
the Middle Eastern share of oil exports and
made the world more dependent on one
region for its food than ever before, f
This extraordinary dependence on one
geographic region for grain supplies is a
historically recent phenomenon.
As recently as the late 1930s, Western
Europe was the only grain-deficit region
and Latin America was the world's leading
grain supplier, exporting some nine million
tons per year. North America and Eastern
Europe (including the Soviet Union) each
exported five million tons of grain annual¬
ly. Even Asia and Africa had modest expor¬
table surpluses.
By 1950, the shift from regional grain
surpluses to deficits was well under way and
the outlines of a new world grain trade pat¬
tern were beginning to emerge. Today, with
North America's unchallenged dominance
as a grain supplier, international grain trade
bears little resemblance to that of the 1930s.
The restructuring of world grain trade
over the last generation has resulted in part
from soil erosion problems and in part from
differential population growth rates, as a
comparison of North America and^ Latin
America shows. During the late 1930s,
Latin America had a larger grain export
surplus than North America, but the
region's more rapid rate of population
growth soon changed this. Indeed, if the
regions had grown at the same ratefsince
1950, North America's population in 1983
would be so large that it would consume the
entire grain harvest, leaving little or none
for export. And North America, too, would
now be struggling to maintain food self-
sufficiency.
Today the countries with significant ex¬
portable surpluses of grain can be counted
on the fingers of one hand the United
States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and
France. Of these, the United States ac¬
counts for over half and with Canada
covers close to 70 per cent of the total.
This overwhelming dependence on one
region, and on one country in particular,
brings with it an assortment of risks. To
begin with, both the United States and
Canada are affected by the same climatic
cycles. A poor harvest in one is often
associated with a poor harvest in the other.
When reserves are low, even a modest fluc¬
tuation in the region's exportable grain
surplus can send price tremors through the
world food economy.
Countries that rely on North American
food should take heed of the philosophical
debate emerging within the United States
about the wisdom of mining the nation's
soils to meet the ever-growing world de¬
mand. Both agricultural analysts and en-
virorunentaJists argue that the country
should make whatever adjustments in its
agricultural practices are needed to protect
the resource base, even though this would
reduce the exportable surplus.
Some argue that it makes little sense to
sacrifice a resource that has been a source of
economic strength since colonial days mere¬
ly to buy a few billion barrels of oil. And
some contend that the current generation of
farmers has no right to engage in the
agronomic equivalent of deficit financing,
mortgaging the future of generations to
come. \e
The current trend is fraught with risks,
both for those whose livelihoods depend on
sustained land productivity and for those in
countries dependent on food imports that
eventually will dry up if the mining of soil
continues. Even for the importers, reduced
supplies in the short term and less pressure
on North American soils would be better
than losing the region's export capacity
over the long term.
One of the most useful indicators of the
world food situation is the food security in¬
dex, which incorporates both grain carry¬
over stocks and the grain equivalent of idled
cropland. This combines the world's two
basic reserves of food and expresses them as
days of consumption, a concept readily
understood by policymakers everywhere.
The two components of the index differ
in important ways. Carry-over stock's, the
grain in storage when the new crop begins to
come in, are readily accessible and require
only time for shipping arrangements to be
made and for transport. Idled cropland, on
the other hand, can take a year or more to
be converted into food by farmers.
The food security index measures the
adequacy of food supplies at the global
level and thus the broad potential for
responding to national shortages, but it
says nothing;; about conditions within in¬
dividual countries. Here the best indicator,
of course, is the nutritional state of a coun¬
try's population.
Assessing nutritional adequacy requires
some knowledge of how the national food
supply is distributed. But a lack of data on
distribution makes it very difficult to
estimate the extent of malnutrition, thus
leaving the subject open to continuing
debate.
The only time a decline in nutrition shows
up officially is when it is severe enough to
affect mortality. When this happens a
country is facing famine, the most obvious
and severe manifestation of food insecuri¬
ty. Using this criterion, inadequate though
it is, developments over the past decade
have not been encouraging.
From the postwar recovery years until the
early 1970s, famine virtually disappeared
from the world. Except in China, which
now admits to a massive famine in 1960-61 ,
%hen it was largely isolated, the world en¬
joyed a remarkable respite from famine for
a quarter of a century. Whenever famine
did threaten, the United States intervened
with food aid, even when it required nearly

,¿ . ' c L.
one-fifth of the U.S. wheat crop two years
in a row, as it did following monsoon
failures in India in 1964 and 1965.
By the early 1970s, however, food
deficits were widening and famine was un¬
folding in several African countries and in
the Indian subcontinent. Several famines
claimed hundreds of thousands of lives,
providing a grim reminder of the fragility of
food security even in an age of advanced
technology. Most were the product of
drought and a failure of international food
relief mechanisms.
During the late 1970s world reserves were
rebuilt and, except for strife-torn Kam¬
puchea, famines subsided only to return
in 1983, a year of widespread climatic
anomalies. The capacity of poor countries
with falling per capita food production and
deteriorating soils to withstand drought and
floods has lessened. As a result, more coun¬
tries than ever before face the possibility of
famine in early 1984.
Among the threatened countries are
Bolivia and Peru in Latin America, and
over a score of countries in Africa. An FAO
team of agronomists assessing the food
situation in Africa in late 1983 identified 22
countries where crisis seemed imminent
Angola, Benin, Botswana, Cape Verde,
Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia,
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Mali,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Sao Tome and
Principe, Senegal, Somalia, Swaziland, the
United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Zam¬
bia, and Zimbabwe. The team of experts
concluded that four million tons . of
emergency grain supplies would be needed
to avoid starvation among the 145 million
people living in these countries.
There is no simple explanation of why ef¬
forts to eradicate hunger have lost momen¬
tum or why food supplies for some
segments of humanity are less secure than
they were, say, 15 years ago. Declines in
food security involve the continuous in¬
teraction of environmental, economic,
demographic, and political variables.
Some analysts see the food problem
almost exclusively as a population issue,
noting that wherever population growth
rates are low, food supplies are generally
adequate. Others view it as a problem of
resources soil, water, and energy. Many
economists see it almost exclusively as a
result of under-investment, while agro¬
nomists see it more as a failure to bring
forth new technologies on the needed scale.
Still others see it as' a distribution problem.
To some degree it is all of these.
The issue is not whether the world can
produce more food. Indeed, it would be dif¬
ficult to put any foreseeable limits on the
amount the world's farmers can produce.
The question is at what price they will be
able to produce it and how this relates to the
purchasing power of the poorer segments
of humanity. The environmental, demo¬
graphic, and economic trends of the 1970s
and early 1980s indicate that widespread
improvements in human nutrition will
require major course corrections. Nothing
less than a wholesale re-examination and
re-ordering of social and economic
prioritiesgiving agriculture and family
planning the emphasis they deserve will
get the world back on an economic and
demographic path that will reduce hunger
rather than increase it.

Children in peril
by V. Ramalingaswami
THE British economist Barbara Ward
spoke of two environments "the
inner environment of biological
health, full creativity and mental develop¬
ment and the outer environment of culture,
stimulus and beauty, of shared affection
and civil security". How can we bring
about a harmonious development of these
two environments for the world's children?
Developing countries are not a
homogeneous entity. They are at various
stages of socio-economic development, and
are developing at various speeds, but they
all face one most important problem high
infant and child mortality rates and mor¬
bidity. In India for example the infant mor¬
tality rate is around 129 per thousand live
births, more than 50 per cent of infant
deaths occur within the first month of life,
and low birth weights are found in almost a
third of all births. For mothers under twen¬
ty years of age, the birth weights are
significantly lower than for mothers from
twenty to twenty-four years of age. The fre¬
quency of low birth weight increases with
rising birth orders.
The story of infant and child health in the
Third World is one of needless illnesses, of
avoidable disabilities and of missed human
opportunities. Acute diarrhoeal disease is
the leading cause of death in children under
one year of age. Malnutrition, over¬
crowding, lack of protected water supplies,
poor environmental sanitation and low
levels of education all act together in a
vicious cycle.
When oral rehydration with glucose-salt
mixture is instituted early, the death rate
from this group of disorders can be brought
down dramatically within a short period of
time. One oral rehydration solution can
now be used to treat most cases of watery
diarrhoea, irrespective of the causative
agent virus, vibrio or bacterium. The goal
is to make oral rehydration therapy a home
remedy so that in the not-too-distant future
the bulk of diarrhoeal diseases may be no
more than a mere nuisance managed by the
mothers themselves in their homes.
Many factors combine in the form of a
chain reaction to perpetuate protein-energy
malnutrition as one of the most endemic
and intractable nutritional disorders of the
Third World. These factors include defi¬
cient intake of food, diarrhoea and other
common childhood infections, the attitudes

12
and perceptions of mothers, traditions and
taboos with regard to infant feeding prac¬
tices, and poverty with all its ramifications.
This vast problem has still not been tackl¬
ed effectively. The supplementary feeding
programmes of the past few decades have
had remarkably little success in bringing
about lasting changes in the attitudes of
mothers towards providing the best possible
nutrition for their children. Protein-energy
malnutrition is a problem that calls for co¬
ordinated multi-sectoral action to deal with
the convergence of poverty and unemploy¬
ment, of disease and illiteracy accentuated
by rapid population growth. These issues
are in turn linked to cultural factors,
economic distortions, human inequalities
and social injustices.
Action should be carried out within the
health sector to provide a package of in¬
tegrated services wherein nutritional and
health care services, especially infection
control measures, are combined. Efficient
surveillance, early diagnosis and simple
treatment of common childhood infections
can be carried out by village volunteers and
mothers, who should be regarded as first
among front line health workers.
Certain illnesses can be remedied by sim¬
ple and inexpensive "magic bullets" (see
also article overleaf).
Nutritional blindness affecting young
children is a problem that can be resolved
by increasing the intake of either pre¬
formed vitamin A or of pro-vitamin A in
the form of green leafy vegetables as a
regular part of the diet. Pending this long-
term solution, it has been shown by Indian
workers that giving massive doses of
vitamin A every six months to children
under the age of five is a feasible method of
controlling this deficiency.
Endemic goitre which afflicts an
estimated 200 million persons, mostly in the
Third World (including 40 million in India
alone) can be treated by the simplest and
cheapest public health measure known to
man iodized salt. Injected or administered
orally, iodized salt will not only control
goitre but when given to pregnant women
will eliminate the developmental disorders
of deaf mutism and cretinism which are
associated with severe forms of iodine defi¬
ciency. But in spite of their cheapness, pro¬
grammes to control goitre are not working
effectively in many parts of the developing
world.
Nutritional anaemia is essentially the
result of an iron deficiency which can be
made good by a periodical supplementation
of the diet with an iron-containing tablet or,
as has been shown by Indian workers, by
the fortification of domestic salt with a
small quantity of iron.
It is in the application of what we know
that we are failing more than in the
discovery of new knowledge. We need to
carry out serious social science research in
order to identify the behavioural factors
which influence the acceptance and diffu¬
sion of a given technology. The health
history of the world teaches us that there is
a direct relationship between improvement
in socio-economic status and reduction of
infant mortality rates. It is futile to believe
that a health system can function outside
the overall developmental processes. The
maximum health benefits can be derived
from development when health activities
are integrated into activities in other
sectors.
In the Third World experience during the
past two decades has shown that with able
leadership, well-designed and effectively
operated programmes, appropriate tech¬
nologies and forms of health-care delivery
together with professional back-up sup¬
port, infant mortality rates can be reduced
by 50 per cent or more even by poor coun¬
tries, in a relatively short period of time and
at a cost less than the equivalent of 2 per
cent of annual per capita income.

THE most important nutrition prob¬
lem in developing countries affect¬
ing infants and young children is
that of protein energy malnutrition. Most
frequently this occurs as the complex result
of an inadequate diet in a deprived environ¬
ment. Families often do not have sufficient
knowledge of the nutritional health needs
of infants and small children.
Once the nutritional status of a young
child starts to deteriorate a vicious circle of
malnutrition and infection is set up. Infec¬
tions 'interact with nutrition by decreasing
the resistance of the young child, by lower¬
ing his normal food intake and by
diminishing utilization of nutrients from
the food. A large number of children can be
expected to be suffering from an acute or
chronic infection during a considerable part
of their first years of life.
Other nutritional problems arise from
specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
The principal problems are associated with
lack of Vitamin A and Vitamin D, and the
mineral salts iodine and iron/folate. Severe
lack of Vitamin A in the diet gives rise to
blindness and the disease is known as
xerophthalmia. Lack of Vitamin D causes
the disease known as rickets which affects
the bones of the body and causes bending of
the leg bones in particular. Lack of mineral
salt iodine causes endemic goitre, and lack
of iron in the diet gives rise to nutritional
14
anaemia. Anaemia may also occur as a
result of lack of folic acid in the diet and is
usually combined with lack of iron.
Nursing mothers and young children are
the most vulnerable to Vitamin A deficien¬
cy, especially if they live in areas where the
staple food used for the weaning diet con¬
sists primarily of rice, maize or cassava and
where small amounts of animal foods, leafy
vegetables and fruits are eaten.
Xerophthalmia is called a "disease of
darkness" because an early symptom is
nightblindness or difficulty in seeing in dim
light. This eye disease is prevalent in Asia,
Africa, South America and the Caribbean.
Once the sight has been destroyed, and this
can happen with great rapidity, nothing can
be done to restore the child's vision.
Yet in most countries where this blinding
malnutrition is serious there exists a cheap
supply of Vitamin A, in green, leafy
vegetables. Because of custom and ig¬
norance, many of these vegetables are not
introduced to children's diet by the mothers
or other caretakers of the children. The task
is to persuade them to do this through nutri¬
tion education. (See article page 29).
Fat is needed for the absorption of a
substance called carotene which is found in
the green leaves and from which the body
manufactures Vitamin A. The carotene
taken by the mouth in the green vegetables

may not be absorbed into the blood and
does not reach the body cells if the weaning
diet is lacking in fat. Palm oil, cottonseed
oil and other food oils locally available can
be used to mix the staple food which is the
basis of the weaning diet for the baby.
Rickets is caused by a shortage of
Vitamin D, together with a poor diet, so
that there is not enough calcium present in
the blood stream for calcification of the
bones. If the bones are not proRerly
calcified then they remain soft and when the
baby begins to walk the leg bones bend
under his weight. Rickets again is a child's
disease and is highly endemic in some
regions of the world. Cases of rickets are
not usually fatal but the deformities can be
permanent. Bow legs or knock knees are
only one symptom of rickets. Vitamin D
can be supplied from such foods as fatty
fish and eggs. It can also be made in the skin
under the influence of ultra violet light
from sunshine. Exposure of the child's
body and limbs to afternoon sun in the
tropics can heal and prevent symptoms of
rickets. Milk powder and baby foods, as
well as margarine, enriched with Vitamin D
should be utilized.
Endemic goitre is a widespread disease
and has been reported from all areas of the
world. It appears in early childhood and
progresses into adolescence and sometimes
adulthood. Women of childbearing age are
of particular concern. Goitre is caused in
some areas by a deficiency of iodine in the
soil and water. Iodized salt has been proved
successful in eliminating goitre in different
regions. The total population under risk is
estimated at 400 million.
Nutritional anaemia caused by iron defi¬
ciency is probably the most common form
of specific nutritional deficiency ; in the
world today. It affects mainly young
children and women of child-bearing age.
Evidence also suggests that nutritional
anaemia adversely affects the productivity
of workers. Iron is needed to form blood.
People who suffer from anaemia cannot
supply enough oxygen to their tissues. They
are lethargic, sluggish and easily fatigued.
They lack concentration, get out of breath
on even slight exertion and lack vitality.
Anaemia occurs when there is a prolonged
loss of blood, or failure of absorption or a
dietary shortage over a very long period.
Suckling anaemia has been known in
many parts of the world. Babies in tropical
areas may have a low haemoglobin count as
early as three months of age. Normally the
baby receives enough iron from the mother
for the first six months of life, but if the
mother has suffered from iron deficiency in
the last months of pregnancy, the baby does
not get its full quota. Poor absorption of
iron may account for some of the deficien¬
cy. Frequent attacks of malaria and
parasitic' diseases will cause a temporary
anaemia. This will pass if the child is receiv¬
ing enough protein and iron in the diet.
Anaemia due to deficiency of folic acid
may also occur. It is less frequent and usual¬
ly combined with iron deficiency. It is
generally associated with pregnancy. Folic
acid is a problem nutrient. There are very
heavy demands by the body for this vitamin
during pregnancy when the diet has to pro¬
vide four to eight times as much as the nor¬
mal quantity required. Folic acid is a water
soluble vitamin of the B complex and is
needed for blood cell formation as well as
protein production in the body. It also con¬
tributes to the formation of the material of
which chromosomes, the genetic
mechanism of cells, are composed. Good
sources of folic acid are: yeast, liver,
spinach and lettuce. Poor sources which
nevertheless make some contribution to the
diet are milk, poultry, eggs and meat. A
larger consumption of animal products is
needed, and a decrease in the infestation
rates with parasites that cause loss of iron
from the food and system.
Described by UNICEF (the United Nations
Children's Fund) as "potentially the
greatest medical breakthrough of this cen¬
tury", oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a
simple cure that can save the lives of most
of the 5 million children who now die each
year from the dehydration caused by diar¬
rhoea. Whereas previously the only effec¬
tive treatment for dehydration was the in¬
travenous feeding of a saline solution, a
child can now be rehydrated by drinking a
solution of salts, sugar and water ad¬
ministered at home. So far 34 developing
countries have openedfactories to produce
oral rehydration salts, and total world pro¬
duction is running at approximately 80
million sqchets a year. However, says
UNICEF, "ORT will not came anywhere
near its dramatic potential for saving life
and health unless it is also promoted
through the primary schools and colleges;
through the churches and the temples;
through the women 's nutrition classes and
the workplace;... and through every other
channel which can reach out to help link
present kno wledge to people 's needs. ' ' Fac¬

FIRST
by Paul Lunven
IT is generally accepted that the problem
of hunger and malnutrition can only
be solved by tackling the root causes,
that is to say, by improving the economic
and social conditions of the poorest classes
of the population. Malnutrition, which is
particularly widespread in rural areas but is
also to be found in towns, is always directly
linked to the development of agriculture. In
developing countries which lack mineral
resources, agriculture is the chief source of
income and employment, an important sup¬
plier of food to both town and countryside,
and an essential contributor to the foreign
trade balance. Responsibility for improving
a country's nutritional situation falls,
therefore, to those in charge of agricultural
planning.
Despite the considerable efforts which
have been made in developing countries to
stimulate agricultural production and rural
development, a large proportion of the
population, especially children, still suffer
from malnutrition. Although significant
progress has been made in productivity, it
has not led to a perceptible improvement in
food consumption and nutritional levels.
According to FAO estimates, about a
quarter of the total population in develop¬
ing countries (excluding Asian countries
with centrally planned economies) do not
have access to a diet which meets the
minimum energy needs of a human being.
Since the vast majority of the
malnourished are from poor rural families,
farm labourers and small subsistence
farmers, it can fairly be concluded that any
significant reduction in the prevailing
malnutrition can be achieved only insofar
as agricultural policies and projects include
food and nutritional objectives. Conse¬
quently, it must be ensured that the ultimate
beneficiaries of development are the most
needy and that the benefits of development
are primarily applied to eliminating the
most glaring deficiencies.
To ensure the future prosperity of the
populations concerned, and to achieve a
general improvement in nutrition and food
consumption, there must be both a reorien¬
tation and a better utilization of existing
resources, in addition to ad hoc nutritional

and Nutrition Division of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), in Rome.
A down-to-earth approach
to nutrition
and rural development
action of the traditional type such as educa¬
tion and supplementary feeding.
Reorientation of agricultural production
in order to provide for target groups (cer¬
tain categories of persons within families
and certain categories of families within
communities) is one of the most important
aspects of development and one of the
most difficult to achieve. It often comes up
against political opposition or ad¬
ministrative obstacles. It is necessary to
ascertain the activities of the needy groups
to be assisted, the kinds of food they eat
and the ways in which they provide for their
food needs, especially during periods when
supplies are difficult to obtain. For in¬
stance, the poor generally consume a high
proportion of cereals and tubers such as
manioc or sweet potatoes, whereas the well-
off consume a higher proportion of oils
(which provide a large amount of energy)
and meat.
Well-off consumers do not suffer from
the alternation of the seasons. On the other
hand poor farmers, in addition to looking
after their own farms, have to work outside
during peak periods. Their wives have to do
a bigger share of the farm work and there is
a danger that the subsistence of the family
may become largely dependent on the fruit
of the woman's labours. The children are
then called upon to help in the fields. In ad¬
dition to all the problems due to uncertainty
of food supplies and the low level of their
incomes compared to the hours of work
they put in, the poor have to cope with
indebtedness, illness and a high rate of in¬
fant mortality.
For all these reasons the FAO and other
United Nations agencies have for several
years been studying the processes which
link the food consumption of low-income
rural populations to agricultural invest¬
ment, in order to measure their impact and
identify the mechanisms which would
enable agricultural planners to take account
of food and nutritional considerations in
agricultural development work at the pro¬
ject level.
In overall terms it is conceivable that,
despite apparently adequate supplies of
food at the national level, pockets of
malnutrition may persist because of in¬
equalities in the distribution of income. But
it is surprising that, in spite of the con¬
siderable means applied, well-intentioned
aims, and possibilities for permanent super¬
vision of the food chain from production to
consumption, projects explicitly aimed at
raising the living standards of the rural poor
do not succeed in improving the food situa-

tion of the most needy to any significant
degree.
It is necessary, therefore, above all to en¬
sure that projects do not entail negative
nutritional effects for the most deprived
groups because of the way in which they are
formulated or executed.
This has happened in the past in the case
of projects which were concentrated on par¬
ticular groups of producers or particular
agricultural products. The poor were com¬
pletely excluded from these projects. Sub¬
sistence food production was completely ig¬
nored, or even eliminated, in the concentra¬
tion of resources.
Other projects have had negative effects
on wages, prices and employment, with the
result that the purchasing power of the poor
declined. When it is considered that up to 80
per cent of their income may be spent on
food, it can be seen what effect a decline in
income can have, because the remaining 20
per cent cannot be squeezed.
It is true that the . negative effects of
development projects on family nutrition
are quite unintentional, and that their real
causes are difficult to identify. When by
chance an assessment reveals a deteriora¬
tion in the situation,- it is commonly at¬
tributed to such factors as backwardness,
ignorance, and traditions. The nutritionist
and the sociologist, for their part, strongly
criticize the very nature of the project
without offering a satisfactory explanation
or an alternative solution. A typical case is
the introduction of cash crops into regions
previously devoted to mixed subsistence
farming. This has often been blamed for a
recrudescence of malnutrition despite an
apparent improvement in living standards.
Nowadays agricultural planners are
aware of the dangers which a sharp transi¬
tion from a subsistence to a market
economy can have for small farmers who
suddenly find themselves obliged to pur¬
chase a large proportion of the food re¬
quired by the family. Certain measures of a
general nature are, therefore, taken in
regard to supplies and prices, in order to
avoid a sudden deterioration in the family's
food supplies. But this is not enough. For
instance, one of the things overlooked in
plans is the woman's role in supplying the
' family's food, for women are always
regarded as consumers, not producers. But
recent FAO studies show that women con¬
tribute as much as 60 per cent of the family
food supply and that they are almost ex¬
clusively both the producers and preservers
17

of what are commonly called secondary
crops.
By eliminating the plots devoted to these
crops, or increasing the demand for the
female labour necessary to maintain them,
the introduction of cash crops has a
negative effect on the family's food supply
(and the preservation of indigenous plant
varieties) despite a substantial increase in
cash income. This effect will doubtless be
attributed to the woman's lack of education
and her consequent inability to manage a
budget, whereas- the prime reason is ig¬
norance of her essential role in keeping the
family Jcitchen supplied.
Indeed, this explains the failure of so
many well-intentioned, carefully planned
development projects. After a certain time
the "beneficiaries", seeing their food situa¬
tion deteriorate, either emigrate or go back
to traditional subsistence crops.
It can therefore be said that, in general,
agricultural and rural development projects
whose primary concern is to increase pro-
. 18
duction rates and incomes can have unfor¬
tunate results on the nutritional level for the
populations concerned. Some of the causes
are the preferential allocation of
agricultural credit for cash crops to the
detriment of food crops; a decline in food
production on the lands affected by the pro¬
ject because of a growing scarcity in the
amount of land available and because of the
demand for labour; an increase in the prices
of purchased foodstuffs due to speculation
and archaic marketing systems; .the appeal
of commercial products with a low nutri¬
tional value, such as carbonated beverages.
To this must be added the fact that it is
always the poor farmer who directly or in¬
directly finances the subsidies on produci
of mass consumption in the towns.
These facts are now known an
documented, but it is nevertheless quite ce:
tain that governments whose main soun
of hard currency is commercial agriculture
cannot be expected to sacrifice the latter to
meeting the nutritional needs of low-level
income groups. This is why the FAO h,

Women play a crucial role in the produc¬
tion, storage andprocessing offood in most
societies. They make up one third of the
work force in the developing countries.
Women often have well-defined specializa¬
tions infoodproduction and are increasing¬
ly becoming the principal farmers and
breadwinners in countries where men
migrate in search of work, or where divorce
and separation are common. Yet this in¬
creased burden of work is not accompanied
by a greater share in the taking ofdécisions.
Chores such as the collection of wood and
the drawing of water are usually left to the
women and despite their importance to
agricultural production they face severe
handicaps. The excess burden of work on
women (the "double day" of farmwork
plus housework) also acts as a stimulus to
have many children so thai they can help
out with the chores from an early age. Fur¬
thermore, development policies often tend
to favour increased production of cash
crops (the man's domain) to the detriment
ofsubsistencefood crops which are usually
the woman 's responsibility, so that family
nutrition suffers. All this means an extra
burden on women, with longer journeys to
work on more marginal land and often ad¬
ditional unpaid work on their husbands'
crops. Top left, a Kababish nomad woman

taken steps to develop agricultural planning
methods which not only identify and
eliminate the causes of deterioration in
food supplies but benefit from the impetus
given by investment in deprived areas, in
order to ensure that the living standards of
the population, and especially their food
supplies, are preserved in terms of quality
and improved in quantity.
In the context of this approach the
economist must ask whether the project en¬
visaged, irrespective of whether it concerns
a food or an industrial crop, will lead to an
increase or a decline in the amount of food
available in the country; whether food
prices will remain stable or will increase,
and whether one or other of these factors
will have negative effects on nutrition.
These questions may seem simple, but the
answers are not, especially if production
targets are considered to be imperative and
must not be sacrificed.
Many experts are at present considering
how to assist the agricultural planner by
supplying him with the tools which will
enable him to achieve the ideal compromise
between economic and social development.
This work is only in its early stages, but
initial results seem to confirm that
agricultural and rural development projects
offer encouraging prospects for improving
the food and nutritional situation in
developing countries.
Of course, if we recall the resolution
adopted by the World Food Conference
just ten years ago that "all governments
must ensure that by 1984 no man, woman
or child will go to bed with an empty
stomach", we cannot but deplore the
meagre results obtained during this period.
It is not the purpose of this article to dwell
upon the impact of the world crisis and
over-armament on the poor in developing
countries. However it can be said that the
essentially economic view of the campaign
against hunger and mulnutrition which
prevailed until recently is slowly changing.
The days are over when the only criteria
of success were an increase in production
and an improvement in national income.
While these are still prime objectives of
agricultural and rural development, the fact
remains that today, despite all the inade¬
quacies of which we are aware, man is no
longer regarded only as an agent of
development, but as its first and ultimate
objective.

World Food Day
In 1979 the 147 nations represented in the
Conference of the Food and Agriculture
Organization ofthe UnitedNations decided
to establish World Food Day on the an¬
niversary of the founding of the FAO, 16
October 1945. The purpose of the Day,
which has been observed annually since
1981, is to heighten public awareness of the
nature and dimensions of worldfoodprob¬
lems and to develop a sense ofnational and
international solidarity in the struggle
against hunger, malnutrition and poverty.
In 1983, the third World Food Day was
celebrated in over 140 countries by a wide
array of activities ranging from art and
essay competitions, to seminars on food
problems and fund-raising appeals in
favour of agricultural development pro¬
jects. Left, a painting by 11-year-old Tuni¬
sian schoolboy Riadh Rouissi, won first
prize in an art competition on "worldfood
security", theme of the third World Food
Day. Over a thousand children took part in
the competition, which was organized by
the magazine Jeune Afrique with the col¬
laboration of FAO.

AFRICA
The hunger belt
IN the 1970s, sub-Saharan Africa had
the highest rate of population growth
of any area in the world; furthermore,
the rate of increase is still accelerating,
whereas in all other developing regions it is
tending to slow down. Food production, on
the other hand, is increasing more slowly
than in other tropical and sub-tropical
areas.
As a result, Africa is the only region that
is currently losing the race to keep food pro¬
duction ahead of population. The figures
clearly bring out the drop in per capita pro¬
duction, but they also show that the results
achieved during the 1970s were inadequate
only in relation to the growing numbers of
people to be fed. In terms of total produc¬
tion, the increase was greater than in the
developed countries.
The attention of the international com¬
munity is being increasingly directed
toward the "African food problem". In
fact, a series of separate problems, rather
than a single pattern of difficulties,
underlies the disappointing performance of
agriculture in tropical Africa. The situation
varies widely by crop, by country and by
agro-ecological zone.
In the production of staple food crops,
the record since 1969-71 contains more
failures than successes. Four of the largest
producers of millet south of the Sahara saw
their output drop in absolute terms, as did
five of the largest sorghum producers, four
of the largest rice producers and six of the
largest maize producers. In relatively few
cases did production growth exceed the in¬
crease in population. Only in cassava was
there no decline in production, although
only four of the large producers managed to
keep output ahead of population during the
1970s.
In some cases, declining production can
be attributed to war or political instability.
But many other factors have also been at
work: the inherent difficulties of farming
on fragile soils subjected to violent but ir¬
regular rainfall; lack of economic incen-

tives; the migration of rural people
(especially the young) to the cities.
Of forty-one sub-Saharan countries with
a significant agricultural sector, only five
(Cameroon, Central African Republic, the
Ivory Coast, Rwanda and the Sudan) have
kept food production consistently ahead of
population growth in recent years. At the
other end of the scale, countries in which
food production per person dropped by
more than 20 per cent between the start of
the 1970s and 1982 include Angola, Gam¬
bia, Ghana, Mauritania, Mozambique,
Senegal and Somalia.
The African food-deficit countries have
made up their shortfalls by imports, par¬
ticularly of cereals, and among cereals
mainly of wheat. Urban and to a lesser ex¬
tent rural populations have developed a
taste for bread made from wheat flour,
which offers considerable advantages over
traditional foods in terms of convenience,
and also has higher prestige. Yet wheat can¬
not be grown in the temperature regimes
prevailing in most of Africa outside the
eastern highlands. An escape from this
"wheat trap" is being sought through
technology for the processing of local
crops, including cassava and traditional
cereals. It is hoped that wheat flour can be
at least partially substituted by local pro¬
ducts in ways that will prove acceptable to
townspeople. Rice, on the other hand, is
well suited to tropical environments;
however, production has been rising more
slowly than demand, and imports have been
soaring.
Cereal imports into sub-Saharan Africa
are still below the average for developing
countries in per capita terms. But they have
been growing fast, doubling every seven
years approximately. And they are already
large in relation to the ability of low-income
countries to finance food imports. In 1981,
the region imported over 12 million tons of
cereals, at a cost of about $2.5 billion. This
absorbed over 27 per cent of the total
receipts of all sub-Saharan developing
countries from the export of agricultural,
forestry and fishery products the main
source of foreign exchange apart from oil
and mineral exports. Imports provided
more than a fifth of total cereal supplies.
If the food situation in sub-Saharan
Africa was difficult in 1982, it begins to
look really alarming when recent trends are
projected into the future. World Bank pro¬
jections show the population of the
developing countries south of- the Sahara as
quadrupling between 1980 and 2020. By the
latter year, the population of Nigeria could
be about 340 million, Zaire some 95 million
and Kenya approximately 80 million. On
the basis of food production trends in the
1970s, sub-Saharan Africa would be able to
feed from domestic sources little more than
half of its population. The food deficit in
the year 2020 would correspond to the en¬
tire present-day agricultural production of
India.
Even over the shorter term the picture
looks grim. Few countries can continue to
cover mounting food deficits with cor¬
responding increases in cereal imports. In¬
deed, the general economic situation is
forcing countries to cut back on food im¬
ports, rather than step them up. Food sup¬
plies per person will inevitably fall if deficits
cannot be made up by imports or by food
aid. Nutrition levels are, therefore, likely to
come under increasing pressure, and the
danger of worsening malnutrition on a wide
scale should by no means be under¬
estimated.
Nevertheless, there are certain plus-
factors which can justify a measure of op¬
timism. Foremost among these are the
underestimated versatility and skills of the
African farmer. His readiness to innovate is
clear from the fact that many of the food
and export crops most widely grown have
been introduced from outside Africa in
modern times. Furthermore, traditional
cropping systems are frequently elaborate
andwithin their limitsefficient. The
difficulty is that they were developed over
many generations to feed an approximately
stable population, and do not lend
themselves to sustained increases in produc¬
tivity. Indeed, no fully satisfactory ap¬
proach has yet been found for continuous
and intensive cropping under the agro-
ecological conditions that prevail in much
(though not all) of tropical Africa. There is
a technological gap, particularly with
regard to soil management and labour pro¬
ductivity, which must be filled before the
African farmer can cope with the food
needs of the continent.
Technology, however, is not all.
Agriculture can prosper only in a
favourable policy environment. At the time

population growth in recent years.
of their independence, many African coun¬
tries appear to have seriously under¬
estimated both the importance and the
difficulties of the agricultural sector. As a
result, domestic food production has
seldom been given the priority it needed.
In a broader context, a bias against
agriculture generally, and food production
in particular, has become built into the
socio-economic structure of many African
States, and affects such fundamental issues
as exchange-rate and taxation policies,
relative price levels, and priorities for the
development of infrastructure. It is
reflected also in the relatively low prestige
attached to work in the farm sector. If food
production is to find a new vitality, many
countries will have to alter profoundly the
attitude toward agriculture held not only by
planners and politicians but also by the
population as a whole.
The international community, for its
part, must find new ways of helping Africa
to help itself. Investment and technical
assistance are vitally needed, but a
multiplicity of small projects, each with its
own administrative requirements, can place
disproportionate demands upon govern¬
ment services which are desperately short of
trained people. Ways must be found of
helping governments to redress the balance
of economic power in favour of food pro¬
ducers, without precipitating a revolution
in the cities. And it must be recognized that,
if the African food crisis has been develop¬
ing for twenty years, it may well take just as
long to resolve.
The gravity of the situation has been fully
recognized within Africa, for instance in
the Lagos Plan of Action adopted in April
1 980 by the members of the Organization of
African Unity. A framework for action
within Africa and by the international com¬
munity is contained in FAO's Regional
Food Plan for Africa. Many studies have
been made by other organizations, notably
the World Bank, and there is no shortage of
analysis and prescription. However, there is
as yet no clear evidence that the tide has
started to turn. Africa south of the Sahara
remains the world's principal food-problem
area.

Seeds ofplenty
The promise of biotechnology
OVER the past twenty-five years,
total world agricultural production
has doubled. Nevertheless, the
problem of ensuring adequate nourishment
for the world's growing population is still
exceptionally acute. The Director-General
of the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO), Edouard
Saouma, recently declared that if present
rates of impoverishment in the developing
countries continue, the number of people
suffering from hunger in the world will
reach 750 million in the year 2000. But at
nearly 500 million, 30 per cent of whom are
children under ten years old, it is already
quite high enough and is fraught with
serious risks for the physical and mental
development of future generations.
In an uneasy world, the food problem is
aggravated by a series of social, economic
and political factors, from the unequal or,
to be more exact, inequitable distribution
of goods to the often primitive conditions
of production and processing of
agricultural output. It is impossible today
to achieve an increase in production yields
per hectare of land, per head of cattle, or
per ton of raw material unless advantage is
taken of the latest scientific discoveries.
Nowadays production, including
agricultural production, is becoming a
science in its own right, with its own
theoretical applied, practical and inventive
aspects. The very development of agricul¬
ture, for instance, has led to many scientific
discoveries such as fertilizers, insecticides,
new means of plant protection, hew species
and varieties of farm animals and crops. All
man's inventiveness was required to solve
the problems of supplying water to farms
and meeting their energy needs. Science
the biological scienceshas
enabled agriculture to obtain record harvest
yields, to produce strains of livestock of
previously undreamed-of productivity, and
to bring about "green revolutions".
In recent years work has intensified in

biology, physiology, the biology of growth,
ecology and, above all, in those branches of
physics and chemistry concerned with the
study of the vital processes of organisms at
the level of their molecular structures. The
improvement in agricultural productivity is
in large part due to genetics, to which we are
indebted for many valuable varieties of
plants, strains of livestock and productive
families of micro-organisms.
Between 1976 and 1980, for example, in
the USSR alone, 723 new agricultural plant
varieties were perfected and introduced to
certain regions of the country noted for
their unfavourable climate and which
statistics show to be characterized by far
from propitious weather conditions during
the planting and harvesting periods. A fur¬
ther 3,000 varieties were sent for quality
testing at State experimental stations.
At the present time, Soviet scientists are
busy working out theoretical bases for the
selection of methods of creating new
varieties, such as mutagenesis induced
chemically or by irradiation, polyploidiza-
tion and hybridization, and the preserva¬
tion of genotypes.
Thanks to the chemical mutagenesis
method, more than a hundred varieties of
Merino sheep are prized for the quality of
their wool. These specimens raised on a

wheat, rice, oats, maize, sunflower and
Qther crops have been obtained.
The advantage of this method is that it
makes possible the production of complete¬
ly new forms, previously unknown in plant-
breeding, which are resistant to various
diseases. From the hybridization of two
mutants of sunflower, for example, one
which synthesizes oleic acid in place of
linoleic acid thus making its oil similar to
olive oil, and another having a short stalk
which enables a marked increase in sowing
density to be achieved, a new strain with a
yield capacity of up to 4,000 kilograms per
hectare has been obtained. Furthermore, by
using irradiation techniques, scientists in
the USSR have produced a more productive
variety of spring wheat and more than fif¬
teen resistant varieties of cotton plant.
Research development in the field of
genetics, selection and pedigree breeding is
of the utmost importance for improving
productivity in cattle. Among achievements
in this field mention should be made of the
acclimatization and propagation of the
Touvinian yak. Yaks are now being in¬
troduced to central Yakutia and it is pro¬
posed to breed them later in the Urals and
the Far East. Highly productive breeds of
sheep have also been created which are
adapted to Siberian conditions and to con¬
ditions prevailing in the high mountainous
regions of Kazakhstan. Work is also pro¬
ceeding on the cross-breeding of the Rus¬
sian black breed of meat cattle with the
Azerbaijanian zebu.

precedented prospects. Scientists in coun¬
tries that lead in this field have reached the
stage at which it is possible, by following a
preconceived plan, to obtain new organisms
with valuable characteristics; they have, in
fact, become manufacturers of new living
systems. Ten, or even five, years ago, such
achievements were possible only in the do¬
main of the simpler micro-organisms, and
many laboratories throughout the world are
making brilliant use of these methods. To¬
day, however, plants and animals are also
the subject of experiments which are giving
spectacular results.
The cultivation not only of plant cells and
tissues but also of isolated protoplasms has
become a reality. This makes it possible to
overcome physiological incompatibility in
the cross-breeding of widely differing plant
species. This method involves fertilization
in test tubes and the cultivation on artificial
nutrient media of isolated embryos and
seed-buds of hybrid combinations where
there is incompatibility of the parent stock.
Cloning of new varieties has made it possi¬
ble to achieve a threefold or fourfold ac¬
celeration of the reproduction span for
perennial plants. In this way they become
immune from disease and under certain
reproduction conditions from viruses.
Modifications of this kind in the selection
process' to which reference has been made
earlier, are. possible for those agricultural
crops (rice, potatoes, tomatoes, lucerne,
clover, rape, etc.) whose passage from cell
to plant is familiar to biologists.

worms give 20 per cent more silk than males

tion of sex regulation methods to
agricultural pests could open up new
possibilities in the fight against agricultural
production losses.
As well as the question of pests one of
the great scourges of agriculture which not
infrequently causes enormous losses
mention should be made of the counter-
measures against plant and animal diseases,
in particular the highly purified vaccines
which the USSR provides for many
countries.
Special mention should be made of two
new methods which have a great future.
The first, which has been successfully
employed in the diagnosis of virus diseases
in particular, is hybridomic engineering
now just as popular as genetic engineering.
Scientists have learned how to create
hybriaomes (cells obtained from lym¬
phocytes and special cancerous cells) which
grow at great speed and produce only one
previously ordered antibody (in contrast to
the multiplicity of different antibodies pro¬
duced by lymphocytes when a pathogenic
agent attacks an animal organism). The
second method, recently discovered, offers
even greater future prospects. It consists of
the use of synthetic preparations (antigens)
which are already being referred to as the
vaccines of the twenty-first century.
Among the biological methods of com¬
bating pests and vectors of infection, the
use of pheromones (sexual attractants of in¬
sects and other animal species) seems to be
very promising. According to WHO statis¬
tics, a single grey rat devours up to 30
kilograms and spoils about 150 kilograms
of foodstuffs per year, and there are seven
thousand five hundred million of them in
the world. Pheromones of rodents make
catching operations in storehouses several
times more efficient.
Another important trend which promises
substantial results concerns biochemical
methods, especially the ' study of the
polymorphism of albumens. The variability
of such important characteristics of plants
as productivity, grain quality, resistance to
frost, resistance to diseases, is closely
related to variations in albumens. A close
analysis of the composition and nature of
these albumens makes it possible to predict
results accurately and to select the best
varieties.
In resolving such an important
agricultural problem as the production of
fodder, albumen insufficiency can be
reduced by industrial production of
valuable fodder additives obtained by
micro-biological synthesis. The scientific
basis for such production and a powerful
microbiological industry have been created
in the USSR. At the present time, experts
are engaged in converting the production of
fodder protein from oil hydrocarbons of
the paraffin type to other raw materials
methanol, methane, natural gas and waste
from the timber, food and other industrial
sectors. The utilization of wood sawdust
and straw, for instance, yields biomass with
an albumen content of up to 20 per cent. A
means of obtaining consistently high
percentages of amino acids by genetic
engineering methods has been patented in
the USA.
The preservation of stocks of genes
(meristems, cells, pollen) of different kinds
at a temperature of - 196° in liquid
nitrogen may become an important new
method. The genetic apparatus of plants
will itself gradually become subject to
genetic engineering. In many laboratories in
a number of countries, including the USSR,
work is being conducted on the introduc¬
tion into plants of nitrogen-fixing genes
found in tuberous micro-organisms living
in symbiosis with leguminous plants, and
also of groups of genes responsible for
resistance to viral diseases.
While it is obviously impossible to cover
the entire field of activity in the biological
sciences in such a cursory survey, the
problem of soil science cannot be overlook¬
ed. Soil is the essential basis of agriculture
and without good soil the highest-yield or
most productive varieties or strains are of
no avail.
Although 14 per cent of the world's
agricultural land is in the USSR, more than
half of this is situated in climatically un¬
favourable areas and there is not all that
much fertile land. Considerable areas are
exposed to wind and water erosion and to
salinity. These factors determine the direc¬
tion of scientific research. Agricultural soil
protection systems have been devised and
introduced on more than forty million hec¬
tares of land. This has made it possible to
obtain millions of additional tons of grain
annually, to reduce the negative effects of
drought and to protect the soil from
erosion.
Aerial surveys to determine soil humidi¬
ty, water-table levels, biomasses of a series
of agricultural crops for a given quantity of
electro-magnetic radiation of the soil sur¬
face in an ultra high frequency wave range,
have proved their value. These investiga¬
tions have demonstrated the great efficacy
of télédétection methods for verifying the
condition of soil resources, appraising the
growth and ripening of crops, selecting ob¬
jectives for land improvement, detecting
disease in agricultural crops, determining
the condition of large tracts of forest, and
many other operations.

INTERDEPENDENCE
'Nationalism provides too narrow a
focus for overcoming poverty and hunger'
by Paul Steidl-Meier
PAUL STEIDL-MEIER, of the USA, is a
member of the Society of Jesus and is on the
staff of the Pontifical Gregorian University,
Rome. He is a specialist in social ethics and in
international development, with particular in¬
terest in the problems of poverty, hunger and
rural development. He is the author of a
number of articles and studies on develop¬
ment problems, including several on rural
development in China.
FOR years the international commu¬
nity has been pushing uphill in the
battle against poverty and hunger
only to find that the problem seems recur¬
rently to get worse. In a manner reminiscent
of the tse-tse fly, which has survived all
manner of attacks upon it by developing
genetic mutations, world hunger has
resisted the assaults of various development
decades. Accordingly in recent years there
has been increasing debate over the theory
of development as well as the orientation of
international politics.
On the international level the discussion
has focused upon forging a "new interna¬
tional economic order" and "managing in¬
terdependence." Talk of interdependence
implies that it is no longer feasible or
desirable for nations to pursue policies of
narrow self-interest. And even though
development is usually discussed in terms of

the Nation-State, what is implied is that na¬
tionalism, after all, provides too narrow a
focus for overcoming poverty and hunger.
The new character of interdependence is
'manifested in three major ways: tech¬
nological, geopolitical and cultural. Almost
more than anything else this new in¬
terdependence is a function of new means
of transport and communication. The abili¬
ty to scan the globe for resources, produc¬
tion sites and market opportunities as well
as to process, cross-reference and com¬
municate this information have made the
activities of businesses now more truly
transnational than ever.
The geopolitics of interdependence
reveals a radical transformation of the
traditional economic notion of comparative
advantage. Dominant States pursue their
own narrow interests globally in a spirit of
group egoism. The economies of develop¬
ing countries are locked into, dependent
upon and exploited by the developed coun¬
tries. Furthermore, the developing coun¬
tries are frequently viewed as political
pawns in the struggle taking place between
the powerful to maintain and even expand
their so-called spheres of influence.
Finally there is a culture of in¬
terdependence. The material aspect is seen
in the dominant forms of technology and
their diffusion. The spiritual aspect is seen
in the continuing battle over ideologies.
This latter struggle has been so intense that
voices suggesting alternatives to present
forms of capitalism and socialism are bare¬
ly given a serious hearing, with the result
that a new culture of international solidari¬
ty is stifled.
Interdependence is a fact; and it looks
like being an ever increasing aspect at all
levels of contemporary life: political,
economic and cultural. What is at issue is
the quality of interdependence which would
assure the dignity of all persons and of all
peoples. To the point, it is clear that hunger
is not primarily caused by population
pressures, scarce resources or the lack of
adequate technologies. Rather, it primarily
derives from a failure of political will,
which failure has roots both in individual
and social abuses of power as well as an im¬
poverished level of international culture
which is bereft of a truly effective (rather
than merely affective) solidarity and, thus,
provides no guiding vision of development.
The present quality of interdependence is
troubling indeed.

There are many .crises in the world of in¬
ternational economics and development to¬
day. And, whether one- considers them
dysfunctions or fundamental flaws in the
system, they cry out for an answer. Yet any
effective answer is clearly impeded by
political economic realities.
The first crisis of interdependence is the
legitimacy of present political economic in¬
stitutions and structures. In the Third
World absolute poverty is growing, even
amid economic growth. "Development"
does not reach the poor, who are concen¬
trated among the rural landless, urban
unemployed, women and children. Nor will
it do so without radically changed domestic
priorities. At the same time the well-off
countries are only just now emerging from
one of the worst recessions in fifty years.
Poverty itself is even growing in the in
dustrialized world. Increasingly the
developed countries are in deficit and can¬
not fund their own welfare programmes.
Domestic concerns rather than the more
glaring international needs garner the atten¬
tion of politicians. These and related issues
have combined to provoke a legitimacy
crisis for the present international economic
order. Increasingly the guiding vision of
"progress" and "economic development"
is being questioned and faith in social in¬
stitutions is being undermined.
The second crisis afflicting contemporary
interdependence is a resource crisis. This
touches human resources and has to do with
population numbers, rights to migration
and the development of human capacities,
issues which directly relate to programmes
to meet basic needs and to foster human
rights. It also includes non-human
resources which comprise both renewable
and non-renewable categories. Discussion
today focuses upon energy, improvement
of natural resources, and, above all, access
to capital, management and technology
which are very scarce in developing
countries.
Finally contemporary interdependence is
involved in a crisis in management and
organization, at both domestic and interna¬
tional levels. This includes planning and ad¬
ministrative skills, but much more it has to
do with organizational politics of
bureaucracies, corruption, and with in¬
tergovernmental pacts touching terms of
trade, transfers of credit, and so forth. The
question is whether the large complex
organizations and institutions that
dominate public life today are capable of
^27

assessing and reacting effectively to the
problem of poverty and hunger and im¬
proving the quality of interdependence.
Normally in discussion of development
the emphasis falls upon the Nation-State.
This is as it should be for through its
legislative, judicial and administrative
functions the Nation-State plays the most
pivotal role in development. Yet many
States today present a sorry picture. On the
national level one frequently finds a na¬
tional security State ideology which sup¬
presses the participation of the country's
own people, wasteful spending on ar¬
maments, corruption, privileged élites who
are beyond accountability, and tremendous
bureaucratic inefficiencies in economic
planning and administration. The interna¬
tional scene is not much more heartening.
Developed countries doggedly pursue their
narrow self-interest by destabilizing local
governments, withholding contributions to
international funds, tying technology to
geopolitical concessions and so forth. There
is no effective and fair international law.
In the face of the lack of meaningful in¬
ternational political controls and the
domestic lack of a stable, efficient and
honest set of legal institutions, market
forces such as the transnationals can have a
field day in the developing countries.
Theoretically, however, the activities of a
transnational can be harmonized with na¬
tional development plans. The key depends
on good, honest and effective government
in the developing countries. Yet it must be
recognized that both local élites as well as
international interests frequently sabotage
such good governments. However, even if
things could be set in order, it must be
realized that there can be no market solu¬
tion to poverty and hunger that is not based
upon profits. And not just any profits, but
a level of profit commensurate with oppor-
28
tunities elsewhere. Market forces can con¬
tribute to overcoming hunger. But for a
market solution to be fair and reach the
poor, adequate price, incomes and financial
policies must be put in place. Again the role
of the government is pivotal.
Finally, there are groups whose power in
society turns upon persuasion. Although
they lack a government's instruments of
social control as well as a corporation's
market clout, these groups are nonetheless
very important in galvanizing political will.
They are seen in interest groups such as
ecology and peace movements, in univer¬
sities and research institutes and also in
religious groups. The focus frequently
enough falls upon social prophecy, which
attempts to challenge and refashion the
cultural value system, the dominant social
paradigms and ideologies and the prevalent
social interpretations of reality. It does this
by stimulating awareness through publiciz¬
ing information, symbolic actions (such as
fasting), and through mobilization towards
consciousness-raising events and pro¬
grammes.
Each protagonist represents a certain
potential as well as certain deficiencies
when we think of their role regarding
hunger in the world today. The dynamics of
organizational politics frequently becomes
quite complex and various forms of sanc¬
tions come into play. It is precisely in such
a complex milieu of organizational politics
that new policies of solidarity and in¬
terdependence which would be effective in
overcoming hunger must be forged.
Some short-term measures are necessary
over the next six to ten years while long term
measures are being implemented. First the
earnings of poor countries. Both the
relative size of earnings as well as stability
are important if development planning is to

policy to overcome hunger is lack of
political will. There is a long way to go
before effective solidarity is forged".

ple (United Republic of Cameroon).
have a solid basis. Various formulae are
possible but agreements such as the Euro¬
pean Economic Community's "Stabex"
should be expanded and improved to
counteract the vagaries of present markets
and secure those ends.
Second, borrowing. Private lending is
always on market terms. At present, of the
money going to developing countries, some
75 per cent goes to but fifteen countries.
The market finds the really poor countries
uninteresting. Public credit funds need to
be vastly increased by donations from the
well-off countries (the famed 0.7 per cent of
GNP goal) and concessional terms are call¬
ed for.
Thirdly, aid without political strings
must be increased. Aid may take the form
of commodities, outright financial grants as
well as the renegotiating of the terms of
loans and the outright cancellation of
debts. In addition crisis facilities need to be
established and strengthened in order to
deal with special periodic problems related
to exchange rates, food, energy and so
forth.
Lastly, accords should be drafted to co¬
ordinate the activities of transnational cor¬
porations with local development plans in
terms of licences, joint ventures and wholly
owned subsidiaries. What is needed is a fair
system of social accountability for private
business decisions which, after all, have
profound public effects.
All of the above measures are important
but the more telling issues are found in
long-term policy measures. There are many
possibilities but I restrict myself to three
general considerations. '
First, local and international priorities in
development must be refashioned. Some of
the more important issues are educating
people for development so that they

become active participants, cutting back the
waste of military expenditures, and grant¬
ing a priority in budgets and capital in¬
vestments to meeting needs over wants in
expenditures.
Secondly, restructuring of the economy.
I think that three issues must be addressed.
First, resource control. Unless resource
control (access to land, credit, etc.) is faced
up to no amount of "development" will
reach the poor. Rather the élites of the
periphery will continue to pursue their own
interests vis-à-vis the centre. Secondly, the
institutional framework must be transform¬
ed. This means that education should be
reworked in order to produce adequate
technology (which would also limit the
brain drain). In addition efforts must be
made to adapt to rather than suppress tradi¬
tional forms of organization and manage¬
ment (such as are found in customary pro¬
cedures in decision-making, informal
credit, marketing and so forth). Finally,
present patterns of input-output must be
overhauled. Production should be in view
of a market. The greatest market potential
is domestic and regional rather than in the
first world where markets, (for example,
for textiles), are often glutted. The develop¬
ment of a domestic market means har¬
monizing agriculture and industry and set¬
ting in place an incomes policy that lets the
poor make money. This means that strat¬
egies to produce growth must also produce
jobs; that is appropriate (intermediate,
labour intensive) technology must be used.
What is produced must be decided in terms
of markets (including incomes policy) as
well as comparative advantages in
production.
Thirdly, diversification is necessary to
reduce risks. It is important to diversify
what is produced so as not to be dependent
upon one or two commodities or industrial
products. Also trading partners must be
diversified so that markets do not collapse
when a recession hits one country, or con¬
sumption patterns change, or the country
turns to either domestic production or to
synthetics. Finally, it is important to diver¬
sify through regional (South-South) co¬
operation. In many places the single
Nation-State is not necessarily economical¬
ly viable nor can it realistically be assumed
that the industrialized countries will meet
all the demands of the poor in the Third
World.
The main obstacle to a truly effective
policy to overcome hunger is lack of
political will. There is a long way to go
before effective solidarity is forged. Yet the
picture is not altogether bleak for increas¬
ing numbers of people (albeit with quite dif¬
ferent motivational principles) are coming
to see the necessity of such actions as those
outlined above.

and nutrition education

'M
ALNUTRITION occurs when,
over an extended period of
time, the food consumed by
an individual does not provide energy
and/or nutrients in the amounts needed by
the body. Under conditions prevailing in
most developing countries, malnutrition
may be more accurately described as under¬
nutrition, since it reflects an insufficient in¬
take of food, often combined with infec¬
tions and parasitic diseases that lower the
capacity of the body to utilize the energy
and nutrients of whatever little food is con¬
sumed... There are also situations in which
the food intake may be sufficient, even if
marginally, to meet the individual's energy
requirements, but is lacking in one key
nutrient. This results in specific nutritional
diseases, the most common of which are
iron-deficiency anaemia, vitamin A-
deficiency xerophthalmia and iodine-
deficiency goitre."

a recent document issued by the Food and

does nothing to lessen the horror of the fact
that malnutrition has become perhaps the
major public health problem facing the
developing world.
Poor and inadequate nutrition and
related illnesses interfere substantially with
learning ability, educational performance
and the capacity to work. Malnutrition is
thus both a symptom of underdevelopment
and a major obstacle to the successful pur¬

principal cause of malnutrition, ignorance,

education, if properly designed and effec¬
tively carried out, can help people, young
and old, to learn about their nutritional
needs and what they themselves can do the
better to meet these needs. It is in this field
that Unesco is making a major contribution
to the fight against hunger.
All too often in the past nutrition educa¬
tion has been confined to the teaching in the
classroom of food values and nutrient con¬
tent. A much broader, far more effective
approach to nutrition education is being
developed which views nutrition as the
study of all aspects of food and eating
behaviour and includes all levels of formal
and non-formal education and the mass
media.
There are many channels for nutrition
education and its effectiveness depends on
using as many of these channels as possible.
Nutrition education is, for example, being
successfully incorporated into a range of
non-formal education programmes in¬
cluding literacy, post-literacy, adult educa¬
tion, rural extension and community
development work.
Some successful attempts are being made
at incorporating nutrition teaching into
literacy programmes for women. These
programmes are an excellent opportunity to
reach mothers with young children and can
provide them with knowledge and skills
that are practical, affordable and necessary
to improve their own nutrition and that of
their young children. Well-designed and ef¬
fectively carried out, nutrition education in
female literacy could bring about signifi¬
cant changes in the nutritional situation of
millions of mothers and children in the
developing world.
Over the past several years an impressive
and growing base of experience has been ac¬
cumulating around the world concerning
the use of the media in nutrition and health
promotion and the important role it can
play in supporting other channels of nutri¬
tion education.
The efficacy of mass communication is
indisputable in terms of its cost-
effectiveness in delivering nutrition infor¬
mation to large numbers of people and
stimulating and sustaining interest in nutri¬
tion. It is therefore important that in and
out-of-school nutrition education benefit
from a close partnership with the media.
Communication and education personnel
must work together in developing in¬
tegrated media and education strategies for
the promotion and maintenance of better
nutrition and health.
Unesco is involved in a number of ac¬
tivities aimed at addressing problems of
nutrition through education both in and out
of school. These include:
the preparation of a package of nutrition
education materials consisting of a
sourcebook for education planners and

War, Hunger, Poverty
by Luis Echeverría
WE now know, in every detail, the
links in the chain which set the
nuclear race in motion. We
know the exact moment when the first chain
reaction was triggered off in Chicago, in the
apparatus designed by the Italian physicist
Fermi. His theoretical venture, which some
members of the scientific élite of his time
believed to be unfeasible, was celebrated by
a small group of people, including the
physicist Eugene Wigner, who was
noteworthy for having brought with him a
bottle of Chianti to toast the great event. A
coded cable containing secret proof of the
experiment's success was sent from the
laboratory in Chicago to the President of
Harvard University.
Four years later, Fermi's experiment had
led to the first two atom bombsthose
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Some weeks before, President Truman had
received another historic and awesome
cable. It had announced that the first
nuclear detonation had been a success, and
read: "Babies satisfactorily born". The
bombs dropped in August 1945, the
radioactive fallout from which has since

become fixed in the human memory, were
proof that science had betrayed its noble
calling as mediator between mankind and
development and progress, and had also
become part of the "chain economy" of
destruction.
We now know, in every detail, every link
in the theory of nuclear extermination,
which bears no comparison to anything
man has ever before devised to dominate
other men and entire peoples, to the extent
that the ever-increasing atomic power
which the world's leading arms-producing
nations have built up over the years has
come to furnish incontrovertible proof of
the irrationality of the present-day world.
We now know all too well that a nuclear
war cannot be won and that such a war can¬
not be planned or conducted in terms of a
conventional struggle between opposing
military forces for, regardless of ideological
considerations, the adversaries would be
united in the same nuclear catastrophe,
with radioactive fallout forming their com¬
mon heritage.
Paradoxically, the world's most power¬
ful leaders, to whom it would fall to press
the button setting off atomic war or nuclear
retaliation, have no hesitation in proclaim¬
ing that fact from the most important plat¬
forms in their own countries and in the
United Nations. Yet rearmament con¬
tinues, and the build-up of nuclear
warheads is assuming proportions that bear
scarcely any relation to the weapons
In 1983 alone, 15 million young children
died in the developing world, in large part
as a consequence of hunger and malnutri¬
tion. It is as if the combined under-five
populations of the United Kingdom,
France, Italy, Spain and the Federal
Republic ofGermany had been wiped out in
a year. Right, this drawing by a young
French schoolgirl symbolizes the need for
international solidarity ifsuch tragedies are
to be prevented.

more than 1.3 million dollars are spent for
military purposes. During that same
minute, 30 children die in the poor coun¬

responsible for the tragic destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Those two bombs now belong to the
prehistory of nuclear extermination. The
Nagasaki bomb, with its power equivalent
to 20,000 tons of TNT, was a mere radio¬
active spark compared with present-day 10
or 15 or 50-megaton warheads. Every
megaton corresponds to one million tons of
conventional explosiveas measured by
the traditional TNT yardstickand the
major powers have apparently stockpiled
more than 50,000 such warheads. No
greater or more impressive proof can be
given of human blindness.
We now know, in every detail, the risks
entailed, whether in tactical combat or in a
more wide-ranging strategic conflict, in
resorting to a pattern of terror which, once
set in motion, would leave no place of
refuge unspared.
All the peoples and nations of the Earth
would suffer from the consequences of
nuclear war in one way or another, either
directly or indirectly. In view of its nature,
a war of this type could not be confined to
the geographical theatres projected by
military planners. Unlike the bomb drop¬
ped on Hiroshima, which was the final
pressure exerted on an already defeated na¬
tion, nuclear war in this day and age would
represent an unbroken leap from a local
conflict to a worldwide struggle by dint of
the very dialectic of the arms build-up and
of the widespread dissemination of strategic
weapons on the high seas, on land and in
the air. Nobody can predict or foresee how
recourse to nuclear terror will move from
the tactical phase to the strategic phase, or
can prevent this from happening.
We now know, in every detail, all the
scientific evidence that has been adduced in
predicting the consequences of a war of this
33

The outcome would be devastating
and, at the same time, there is every
likelihood of changes occurring in climate,
and biological structure and of an ensuing
breakdown in the ecological system which,
as a result of the destructive inroads being
made by technology, is already becoming
an urgent problem for all mankind. In
short, not only would it be a war without
victors or vanquished; it would be a war of
progressive self-destruction that would give
rise to all kinds of Kafkaesque mutations
and metamorphoses. This list of conse¬
quences does not reflect any desire to exag¬
gerate. Researchers at the Sloan-Kettering
Institute for Cancer Research, New York
City, put the matter in a nutshell when they
acknowledge that nuclear war would be
suicidal not only for an enemy attacked by
nuclear weapons but for the very nation
which used such weapons, even if there
were no retaliation. Such is the level of
precision that has been reached in demysti¬
fying nuclear war as an ideological instru¬
ment of power politics.
The world spends more than $650,000
million a year on rearmament. This sum is
admittedly huge, but the figures do not tell
the whole story. What is more serious is that
a high and constantly increasing percentage
of the sums devoted to research and
development are being earmarked for the
construction of new rockets. The search for
the ultimate weapon has already given rise,
in theory at least, and this is by no means in¬
conceivable or impossible, to talk of star
wars, of wars in space. The ideology of
power has never before illustrated the
degree of aberration and irrationality ex¬
isting at its very core.
All this highlights one major factor,
namely that disarmament cannot be en¬
visaged me/ely in terms of the redistribu¬
tion of the amounts spent on rearmament
and of their automatic allocation to the
construction of housing or infant schools.
This "Father Christmas" view of things has
had a very negative effect on the debate,
primarily because it is well known that rear¬
mament is instrumental in supporting a
large part of industry and that science and
technology are therefore very much involv¬
ed in the development and expansion of the
economic model of arms production. Disar¬
mament should be regarded in its own right
as a revolutionary force aimed at liberating
science itself.
Disarmament and the liberation of
science have the same underlying
significance, above all because it is essen¬
tial, at the present time, for the arms build¬
up the juridico-political expression of
power politicsto be superseded by a
development model that would make it im¬
possible, as if it were historically inevitable,
for hunger and the wastage of the material
and scientific resources so necessary to life
to exist side by side.
The liberation of science from rearma¬
ment plans would mean a radical,
epistemological break with the outmoded
definition of domination. If it were to come
about, mankind would not only be provid¬
ed with the material resources it needs but
also with an objective system for laying
down a new order of priorities and for gain¬
ing an insight into the main principles in¬
volved in establishing the most concrete
forms of human solidarity. Hunger is an
everyday fact of life for hundreds of
millions of people who will never be able to
perform their social function or historical
role to the full.
The praxis of disarmament accordingly
emerges as the creative political develop¬
ment of the human species towards a new
economic order. By contrast» the im¬
perialistic expansion of the major economic
powers has hitherto relied on the logic of
the arms race because it was through this, in
the manner of all justificatory ideologies,
that it brought science and industry under
its hegemonistic control. This is why the
highly "developed" economies have tended
to combine the optimization of gain and the
will to dominate with the logic of
rearmament.
Hence, peace does not consist in
redistributing the sums devoted to warlike
ends but in dismantling a system which,
over the centuries, has founded its
historical reproduction on force and
supremacy. Peace, therefore, is the deter¬
mination to link the praxis of disarmament
with the praxis of a new form of develop¬
ment and not merely a swing in government
budgets from one extreme to the other. In
short, peace has to be visualized as a vast
process of human emancipation primarily
affecting science and technology. In other
words, disarmament must be seen as the
liberation of the accumulated stock of
knowledge for the service of the liberation
of mankind by mankind and, consequently,
of its liberation from its greatest common
enemy: hunger and poverty.

'Songs of Ihe Pirogue'
We should like to point out to our readers that,
for space and layout reasons, the artistic aspects
of the pirogues (dugout canoes) of the Duala peo¬
ple were stressed in the article "Songs of the
Pirogue" (December 1983 issue). The author,
Francis M'Boulé, has asked us to make it clear
that the study from which the article was inspired
focuses largely on the role of the pirogue in "the
exchange of goods".

/ he coffee stored in this imposing
warehouse at San Pedro forms a majoi
part of the export wealth of the ivory
C oast, the third largest coffee producer
in the world after Brazil and Colombia.
A major problem facing many developing
countries whose economies are dependent
upon the export of one or two primary
products is that they are largely at the
mercy of fluctuations in the world
against them, income from their exports
may be insufficient to enable them to
import foodstuffs to compensate for any
short-fall In domestic food production.
