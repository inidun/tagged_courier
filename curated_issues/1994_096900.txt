The United Nations has proclaimed 1994 the International Year of the Family, with the
theme: "Family: resources and responsibilities in a changing world". Meetings, media
campaigns and other activities will be staged throughout the Year, to which Unesco
will contribute by sponsoring a number of events including an exhibition entitled The
Family Seen Through Children's Eyes, organized by the International Museum of
Children's Art in Oslo (see our October 1991 issue on Children in Danger). In the
exhibition, which will be displayed at the Grande Arche de la Défense in Paris from 6-28
January and will then travel to Costa Ftica, New York and Vienna, children from all over
the world will present their views on marriage, divorce, war, the environment, religion,
illness and death, and on what it means to have no family. Above, My Family, a

"The Governments of the States parties to this Constitution on behalf of their peoples declare,
"that since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed . . .
"that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could secure the
unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the world, and that the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the
intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.
"For these reasons, the States parties ... are agreed and determined to develop and to increase the means of communication between their peoples
and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understanding and a truer and more perfect knowledge of each other's lives. . . ."

THÉODORE MONOD talks to
Michel Bâtisse
Théodore Monod ¡s a naturalist who himself belongs to a disappearing
species: that of the explorer-scientists who travel to remote regions to
satisfy their passion for knowledge. In his Paris workplace,
the Ichthyology Laboratory of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle,
he welcomed me amid shelves packed with books, phials, preserving
jars, fishes' jaws, samples of rocks and stone tools.
He has travelled far and wide through his beloved Sahara andat the
age of ninety-oneis currently preparing for his "last long-distance
expedition by camel". As well as a scientist, Théodore Monod is also a
man of peace and convictions, who has fought tirelessly for the
respect of human rights and the defence of Nature.
You arefamousforyour travels through
the desert by camel, butyou began your sci¬
entific career as a student ofmarine species.
What was your real vocation?
The important decisions in life are usu¬
ally made by chance. I joined the Muséum
as an assistant in a department concerned
with "Fish and colonial productions of
animal origin". The staff were required to
travel in the then French colonies, and in
1922 I was sent to Mauritania to study,
not the desert, but the coast and fishing.
Instead of returning to Bordeaux by ship at
the end of my stay, which lasted almost a
year, I took a camel and crossed the whole
of western Mauritania as far as Senegal.
The conditions were somewhat arduous,
since I was poorly equipped and quite
inexperienced. But that did not turn me
against the desert, and in 1934 I went on
another big expedition into the western
Sahara. Then in 1938 1 was appointed head
of the French Institute for Black Africa
(IFAN) in Dakar, where the desert was
right on my doorstep.
I started out studying fish and I still
work as a zoologist. Right now I am trying
to finish a study I began forty years ago on
the skull of the parrot-fish, whose bucco¬
pharyngeal anatomy is highly distinctive.
I have also spent part of my life studying
the marvellous world of crustaceans. In
1924 I discovered a group so unique that
no-one had even suspected their existence,
the Thermosbaenacea, the first example of
which had been identified in a Roman bath
in Tunisia. I managed to organize my activ¬
ities so as to specialize in these two areas,
while continuing to pursue my interests in
desert regions.
Was it a taste for adventure that took
you on your expeditions to Mauritania
and elsewhere? Was there a scientific or
spiritual link between yourpassion for the
sea andyourpassion for the desert?
My curiosity is insatiable. If I go to the
Sahara, or if I dissect the skulls of fish, it is

to try to understand, to add a little more to
human knowledge. That is the mission of
the researcher. No, it's not a matter of
adventure but of research, of making pre¬
cise observations intended to add a little to
the volume of existing knowledge. Rejec¬
tion of ignorance, the desire to know and
to explain are, I think, the honour and
glory of the human mind.
Sometimes and it's no bad thing
there is also an attraction for a certain kind
of life. The life of the sailor and that of the
camel-driver have several points in
common in the sense that they both
experience intense freedom and solitude
in the midst of extreme heat or cold. . . .
Life in the desert demands a strategy for
survival, for plants, animals and man. The
true Saharan nomads are an ecological suc
cess just as the Inuit of Baffin Island are.
They are people who live on the outer
edge of the Earth's habitable region and
they are admirably adapted to life in their
territory which they think is the finest
land in the world. They know all there is to
know about its resources. For the camel-
drivers of the Sahara, each plant has a use,
as a medicine or a source of food.
In the modern world is there a future
for the knowledge, traditions and ways of
life ofdesert people?
The nomads are today threatened by a
number of new factors. Several of the eco¬
nomic pillars of nomadism have collapsed.
The razzia, for example, as it was prac¬
tised in the past, as raiding for booty, not
for the pleasure of going off to kill or be
killed (on the contrary there was as little
killing as possible). You went to a Sudanese
village, stole camels and children to be
your slaves, then returned home and shared
the proceeds if there were any, for some
of these expeditions ended very badly. You
could also invest in a big raid, become a
kind of shareholder in it, just as the ladies
of Versailles did in eighteenth-century cor¬
sair expeditions. It was all perfectly legal
and highly structured.
Razzias came to an end with the nine¬
teenth century. There were also the tolls
that had to be paid in the days of trans-
Saharan trade. Caravans of thousands of
camels plied through the desert from
Morocco to Timbuktu, In-Salah, Ghadamès
and Tripoli, carrying salt, gold dust, a few
animal skins, a little gum arabic. They

would have to cross land claimed by such
and such a tribe, and to get through they
would have to leave something behind en
route. Not money, for they had no money,
but a share of what they were carrying.
Today only trucks make these journeys.
Then states came into the picture.
Today the nomads live on the territory of
modern states, and generally speaking cen¬
tralized government is not very keen on
them. For the bureaucrats a free man ought
not to exist. What's to be done with him?
Get him to settle down in one place, either
of his own accord or by force, or else
destroy him. Many nomads have become
rebels after violent clashes. But negotia¬
tions are taking place, moves towards solu¬
tions are afoot. The ideal would be to grant
the nomads a considerable degree of
regional autonomy, give them a say in mat¬
ters that concern them, make sure that
they are governed by people from their
own society who know all about their
problems. It should be up to the nomads to
decide their own future. If, as they cer¬
tainly have the right to do, they want to
conserve their historical, cultural or lin¬
guistic autonomy since the Tuareg have
a language and even a script of their own
they will have to find financial resources.
Because even in the Sahara people have to
pay taxes, whether they like it or not. And
while it is possible to live in the Sahara, it
is impossible to live simplyfrom what the
Sahara provides. The nomad needs to go to
a shop from time to time just as the sailor
needs to reach port. To buy cloth, for
example. It is a long time since nomads
wore animal skins, although I have seen
slaves' dresses made of goatskin.
Do slaves still exist?
In large numbers. There are tens of thou¬
sands of them. Of course no-one uses
the word "slave" any more, you find
euphemisms such as "servants". Many are
needed, to draw water from the wells, for
example, above all in summer. Since the
razzia has ceased to exist no new slaves
are taken, but slaves marry and their chil¬
dren belong to their masters. Some have
sought and obtained their emancipation, as
they have the legal right to do. But it's not
as simple as that. It's all very well to free a
slave, but then you've got to provide him
with a livelihood. His status as a slave gives
him the right to certain things: his master
is under the obligation to feed him, to pro¬
vide him with clothing from time to time,
a pair of sandals. ... A kind of profit-
sharing system should be invented,
whereby the former slave would have a
share in the increase of the herd. It's bound
to happen. These are old ways that take a
long time to die out.
You were director of the French Insti¬
tutefor Black Africafor twenty-fiveyears
andyou made certain choices regarding the
direction of scientific research. Did you
favour basic or applied research?
When I arrived in West Africa, applied
research was already well organized. Agro¬
nomic, geological, medical, veterinary and
other forms of research were all going on,
and there was no question of IFAN taking
the place of existing research centres. My
ambition was to model IFAN to some
extent on the Muséum in Paris, in other
words to choose a certain number of dis¬
ciplines and establish departments for
them. But with something more. IFAN
had two wings, the human sciences and
the natural sciences. Between the two there
was a geography section which in my
opinion acted as a very useful bridge
because the work of the human sciences
and why not? that of the natural sci¬
ences, often took the form of maps that
geographers could prepare and process.
It was particularly important to start
doing basic research because there were
no universities in those days. I was involved
in the creation of West African universities
and for two years I was dean of the faculty
of sciences at Dakar. Now there are many
universities and a wide range of research is
carried out in them, often in basic science.
There's plenty of work waiting to be done
in Africa. The distances are colossal and
fieldwork is not always easy, but the main
thing is to get things going and to see that
6

they continue. IFAN still exists; it has
financial problems of course; its publica¬
tions come out a little late, but they do
still come out.
So you're not one of those who thinks
that basic research is a luxury for devel¬
oping countries, and that these countries
should concentrate on more "profitable"
research?
No, I'm not. Basic research is part of the
activity of the human mind, and is needed
in a modern country. When the former
colonies became states, they had to acquire
the attributes of a modern state. Museums,
for example. In the past there were no
museums in Africa. Now all the big coun¬
tries have them, and perhaps I played some
small part in the process. Museums are
important. Some sciences, such as archae¬
ology, seem remote from current preoccu
pations. Yet archaeology is one of the foun¬
dations of any nation's history. People need
to connect with something in their past,
even the very distant past.
For example, here's a hand axe I found
in the Libyan desert, in a valley between
sand dunes. As you can see, the upper side
is shiny; it has been polished by the wind
and the sand. But the other side is dull.
That means the axe can't have been moved,
because if it had been turned over it would
be polished on both sides. This hand axe
was fashioned by someone in palaeolithic
times who used it to cut up an antelope,
maybe, and then threw it away because it
was of no further use to him. Three years
ago someone else picked it up, and that
person was me. How many years passed
between those two actions? A hundred
thousand at least! That's just a flash, a
nanosecond, in the history of the Earth, but
we are impressed by it, because we are
ephemeral insects and it is very hard for us
to imagine the passing of any length of
time. Lamarck said that "Everything
becomes possible with time". Even unpre¬
dictable, incredible things come about
given time. The microfossils that I am cur¬
rently collecting in Mauritania are found in
rocks estimated to be 800 million years
old. That's quite a while ago, but it's still
not the time when life began on Earth,
which was even earlier. But it is an impor¬
tant stage in the evolution of living cells.
Yourpassion for knowledge is bound¬
less, like that of the eighteenth-century
Encyclopaedists. But we live in an age of
specialization.
I'm a naturalist, in the old-fashioned
sense of the term. I think it's a terrible pity
that basic sciences such as zoology and
botany should disappear from the univer¬
sities and from academic life. I don't think
that it serves the cause of knowledge. If you
want to be a molecular biologist, it's a good
idea to know what you're talking about, to
know what species or organism you are
studying. What's more, the inventory of the
world's flora and fauna is far from com¬
plete. We know all the big animals now. We
are not going to find a new okapi or giraffe,
although we do come across a hitherto
unknown cetacean from time to time. But
thousands of small species insects, for

example are discovered every year, and
there's still a long way to go. We're making
extraordinary discoveries by studying envi¬
ronments that were inaccessible fifty years
ago: creatures living in the soil, cave-
dwelling fauna, interstitial fauna living
between grains of sand on the seabed	
H Perhaps we hear so much about mole¬
cular biology and biotechnology because
we expect them to have economic conse¬
quences.
I have nothing against molecular biology
as such. I just wish people would stop
dividing the sciences into those that deserve
to receive funding and those that can be
abandoned. We need molecular biology; it
has extraordinary possibilities. But we also
need to know about animal and plant
species, their anatomy, their morphology,
their way of life. Who knows which plants
in the forests we're busy destroying may
produce effective remedies for some sick¬
ness or endemic disease? Let's not give up
natural history, in the strict sense of the
term.
Maybe the first thing that should be
done is toprotect the natural environment
while there is still time especially in arid
regions which seem to be particularly
fragile.
I couldn't agree more. We have to make
a distinction here between the Sahara, the
real desert where there are few people and
where nomads simply move on when an
area has been overgrazed, leaving the veg¬
etation time to grow again, and savannah
areas like the Sahel where there are too
many people and above all too much live¬
stock. Veterinarians understand the situa¬
tion very well; they can calculate how
many kilos of beef, mutton or goat can be
raised on a given piece of land without the
risk of overgrazing that is harmful both
for plant life and for the animals, which no
longer have enough food to live on and
eventually die from lack of nourishment.
What can be done about the Sahel, then,
where there's no hay, where no grazing
land is set aside and people go on living as
they always have? It's very hard to get
people who are used to following old tra¬
ditions to accept new forms of organization
and land use.
The fact is, however, that it's impossible
to draw a boundary between arid, semi-
arid, predesert and extreme desert zones.
Nature is a continuum. We are the people
who put up barriers, dividing it up
according to the degree of aridity or cli¬
matic differences so that we can talk about
it more clearly. The universe is one and
indivisible, so let's take a global view of it.
I believe in the idea of cosmic unity, and
consequently of solidarity between living
things.
Youfightfor human rights as wellas the
protection of the environment.
Absolutely. It's the same struggle. People
are part of Nature just like other living
creatures. But they do things that other
animals wouldn't dare to do. I never use the
word "bestial", in the sense in which news¬
papers employ it when they describe a
"bestial" crime. It's totally inaccurate; ani¬
mals don't behave like that! We should say
"a human crime", but it seems that the
word "human" isn't pejorative. And yet
human beings are the only animals that
have schools to teach their young to kill

Deserts stir our emotions because they represent

scene. They also show us what it may be like after
we have disappeared.
one another. It's monstrous! Lions aren't
crazy, they don't teach their cubs to kill
other lions, they teach them to kill gazelles
or zebras. Personally I'd prefer lions to be
vegetarian, but I wasn't consulted a great
pity, since I could have given some excel¬
lent advice! The future of humanity will be
jeopardized as long as we love violence,
cruelty and war. This homo we call sapiens
may not last very long. Deserts stir our
emotions because they represent Nature as
it was before human beings came on the
scene. They also show us what it may be
like after we have disappeared. Nature will
survive. Fortunately, it has a future, but
we won't have much of one if we go on
behaving rashly.
Do you find a spiritual dimension in
the desert?
No more than anywhere else. Spiritu¬
ality is found in cities just as much as in
deserts. It's true that the desert encour¬
ages meditation, because you have to pass
the time. The desert can be terribly boring.
A day spent on camelback is deadly dull.
You can't read, you do four kilometres an
hour and you have to ride for ten hours a
day. That's a long time. You're very happy
to stop in the evening. On the other hand
there's the silence, the simplicity, the fru¬
gality. There are some things one can learn
from the desert, but they don't directly
relate to what people mean by spirituality
in the religious sense.
The desert offers protection against
certain dangers. In the early days of Chris¬
tianity it was where monastic life began, in
its eremitical form. People went there to get
away from the moral dangers of the cities,
to take refuge in a place where they could
devote themselves to meditation, prayer
and an ascetic life. But I'm not sure that it
creates religious feeling.
Even so, it's beautiful and it's clean!
The desert doesn't lie; everything is there
for you to see. There's even something
shameless about it: the earth is naked. The
sand covers it in places, but apart from
that its skeleton can be seen wherever you
look. It's a paradise for geologists. Rocks
can be seen from far away; you know
where you're going; you can decide exactly
where you're going to take your samples
tomorrow. The scale is grandiose. The
dunes are immense some of them are 200
metres high and their colours and shapes
are extraordinary. They are waves created
by the wind, like sea-waves except that
they last much longer; some of them date
back to the New Stone Age or earlier. The
superstructures move, but we don't always
see it happen. To appreciate the movement
of dunes you need to come back in a thou¬
sand years' time, which we can't do and
the people who will be there a thousand
years from now won't have seen them as
they are today. We need to think in terms
of long periods of time, and that is some¬
thing we find very difficult.

The dry lands
These limestone formations in
Nambung National Park, north of
Perth (Australia), formed around
the roots of plants that grew there
in sand some 30,000 years ago.
When the plant cover died, the
dunes shifted, leaving these curious
pillars exposed.

IN most people's minds the term desert conjures up an
image of undulating sand dunes beneath the hot sun.
There are, however, many other kinds of desert.
Antarctica, Greenland and the polar ice packs are cold
deserts where where the water is locked up in ice. As for
the Earth's arid regions, they exist both in areas such as
| Arabia where the climate is permanently hot, and in others
such as the steppes of central Asia where the winters are
cold. The common denominator between them is that on
average more water evaporates than falls as rain, and life
has to adapt to the deficit.
Where there is practically no rain, as in the Sahara and
the Gobi, there is virtually no life. The only exceptions to
this rule are places where irrigation water can be drawn
from rivers (as in Egypt, Iraq and the Indus region, all of
which saw the birth of great "hydraulic civilizations"), or
from underground "fossil" reserves that can be exploited
for a limited time, as is currently happening in Libya.
Regions in which enough water falls to allow grazing and
perhaps some dry farming are described as semi-arid. There
are many of these in Africa, India, Argentina and Australia.
Arid and semi-arid regions make up more than a third of
the world's land surface, whereas cultivated land accounts
only for one-tenth. They are concentrated in two zones
straddling the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, on each
side of the Equator. The main cause of aridity is to be found
in the circulation of the atmosphere above our revolving
globe. The almost permanent ridges of high pressure that
predominate around the 30°-latitude mark stop rain from
forming. Great distance from the oceans or the presence of
mountain barriers are other factors that contribute to the
aridity of regions like central Asia or the American Midwest.
So deserts have not been created by humankind, as is
sometimes claimed, though people do contribute to
desertification. In our time increased population pressure
and over-intensive agriculture and grazing are accelerating
soil degradation and worsening the effects of drought in
semi-arid regions such as the African Sahel and north¬
eastern Brazil.
There is another way in which human activity may affect
i the evolution of arid regions. It is thought that the
I accumulation in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide from
automobile engines, heating or industry and other gases of
industrial and agricultural origin can lead to global warming
through the "greenhouse effect". It is not yet possible to
predict the consequences of such global warming for
different regions, but it may well be that in a few decades
some arid regions will be drier still while others will be less
so. In that case, people will have brought about a significant
climatic change, comparable to those that have taken place
in the course of geological history.

Ascetics have always been drawn to life in the desert, far from the
world and the pleasures of the flesh. Some of them became a prey to
strange forces and malign spirits...
THE CALL OF THE
WILDERNESS
if Jean-Claude Carrière
ii
JEAN-CLAUDE CARRIERE,
French author, dramatist and
scriptwriter, is director of
FEMIS, a cinema and
audiovisual school in Paris. He
has adapted the great Indian
epic The Mahabharata, for the
stage and, for the screen,
Edmond Rostand's play Cyrano
de Bergerac. He has recently
published a novel, Simon le
Mage (Plön publishers, Paris,
1993).
THREE calls come from the desert. The first
is the call of God, who manifests himself
in the wilderness, as he did to Moses. It is
in the desert or so the early Christians
believed that we can really make contact with
the other, supernatural, transcendent world. It
is there that the essential word can be heard.
The second call is one of disgust and con¬
tempt for the world and for a corrupt, con¬
demned society in which God's presence is
obliterated by commerce, by the family and by
a thousand and one mundane, pernicious desires.
In contrast, the solitude and aridity of the desert
seem pure, unsullied. Ironically, despite the lack
of vegetation, the desert is where the last traces
of paradise can be found.
The third call is sounded by the trumpets of
the apocalypse. During the early centuries of the
Church, the founding fathers of Christianity
were certain that the end of the world was nigh.
At any moment the heavens might split asunder
and exterminating angels with flashing swords
surge forth. When that terrible vision came to
pass, woe betide those caught in a state of sin or
even of forgetfulness; they,would be hurled for¬
ever into Gehenna. When the end of the world
comes, we should be in a state of retreat and
prayer, as near to God as possible. That is why
the desert is there.
A hotbed of temptation
Early in the Christian era, many people were
drawn by these three calls to arid lands, in Syria
but above all in the Thebaid, the desert around
Thebes in Egypt. They soon became legendary
figures. The most famous of them was St.
Anthony, who lived in Egypt to the age of a
hundred and five. His experiences showed that
if the desert is a sacred place it is also a hotbed
of temptation where the devil and evil forces can
rise up in the form of strange, whirling shapes
ready to drag into the abyss anyone bold enough
to turn his back on worldly comforts and the
reassuring relationships of social life.
This ardent, perilous life in a remote place and
in absolute poverty a practice that Luther and
the Protestants would later denounce as stulti¬
fying gave rise to extreme forms of behaviour
that appear extraordinary to us today. The desert
teems with images that came to obsess these holy
men, driving them to the brink of madness and
even beyond: it is a land of wonders and hallu¬
cinations because of the burning sun; its aridity
is an allegory of the soul's separation from God;
it is a powerful symbol of unity; sand and wind
are symbolic elements inseparable from the

eternal theme of the vanity of all things, while
rock symbolizes permanence; baptism is per¬
formed with the water of life, all the more pre¬
cious in the desert because of its scarcity; it is the
haunt of tireless, aggressive, wandering demons,
seemingly stirred by the hermits' asceticism and
self-denial. The Church kept these men at arm's



length, sometimes pointing out that they were not
following the example set by Christ, who had
chosen to live and die among people. Neverthe¬
less, a multitude of Lives of the Desert Fathers
related their exploits in great detail.
It is no exaggeration to talk of physical
exploits or even of competitions or champi¬
onships, for the desert fathers strove to outdo
each other in fasting and praying. Some hid their
faces, others flagellated and mortified themselves.
St. Macarius the Egyptian remained standing
"for sixty years", from time to time running

Peninsula (Egypt), one of
the cradles of Christian
monasticism in the Orient.
through the desert carrying a heavy basket of
sand. When asked what he was doing, he replied,
"I am tormenting him who torments me".
St. Paul the Hermit, who recited 300 prayers
a day (he counted them with pebbles), was
"humiliated" when he learned that a virgin in a
neighbouring village recited 700. St. Elpid, who
lived near Jericho in the fourth century, never
faced the west and never looked at the sky after
six in the evening for reasons "known to him
alone. Others lived covered with chains, sur¬
rounded by sharpened branches or wearing
strange helmets from which stones that kept
them from falling asleep were suspended
(because God may come "like a thief in the
night"). They never washed, out of scorn for the
flesh. Live maggots crawled from the mouth of
a Greek ascetic named Matthew. The hermit
Meletius was covered with running sores, and 13


whenever a maggot fell out of one he carefully


put it back so that it would not suffer.
Perhaps the most extraordinary of all were
the stylites, who lived on top of pillars in order
to be closer to heaven. According to legend, St.
Simeon Stylites, the best known among them,
stayed on a column for over forty years. He
inspired a poem by Tennyson and Luis BuñuePs
film Simon ofthe Desert (1965).
Simeon ate nothing but a few blades of grass
hauled up to him in a basket attached to a rope;
his excrement was black pellets. He had
numerous visitors, and several rulers even sought
his advice, bearing gifts, which he refused. On
one occasion, he thought he saw an angel of
light swoop down in a chariot of fire to take him
to heaven, but just as he raised his foot to climb
in, the vision faded. As a punishment he con¬
demned himself to stand on one foot for the
rest of his life. (He died a year later.)
The flesh is weak
In this desert that was both a challenge to them
and an arena for their feats of endurance, the her¬
mits seem to have been possessed by a terror of
women. They took drastic steps, even going so
far as self-mutilation, to combat this fear. One
desert father saw a woman's footprint in the
sand and immediately caused it to disappear.
Another, on a journey with his aged mother,
wrapped his hands in several layers of cloth
before carrying her across a stream, thus
avoiding contact with dangerous flesh.
There are many stories about hermits who
tamed and domesticated wild animals (some
spoke the language of crocodiles, another trained
a bear to take sheep to pasture at certain fixed
times), but women, even holy women, evoked
feelings of horror and panic. St. Martinian, from
Caesarea in Palestine, inflicted serious burns
on his feet to resist the blandishments of a young
woman who had tried to seduce him. As soon as
his wounds were healed, he retired to a rock in
the middle of the sea a desert of another kind.
One day a ship ran aground on the rock and was
smashed to pieces. The sole survivor was a
young woman who cried out for help as she
clung to apiece of wreckage. St. Martinian took
her onto his rock but then jumped into the sea
to get away from her. With the help of God and
the currents, he safely reached the shore.
Women who went into desert seclusion were
faced with similar pitfalls. Apollinaria, daughter
of the Emperor Anthemius, had herself disfigured
by mosquitos in a swamp before withdrawing to
the Thebaid; she did not want the other hermits
there to find her attractive.
Some did give way to desire. After a long
stay in the desert, a certain Herion went home to
Alexandria, where he devoted himself to night life
and horse-racing and took up with a dancer.
God, however, had not abandoned him, and the
chronicles recount how the Lord saved Herion
from debauchery by "making a tumour grow
on his glans".
A multitude of hermits
The silence of heaven can be as relentless in the
desert as anywhere else, and some hermits gave
up. Others followed their vow unswervingly,
experiencing hallucinations or madness. Fanatics
sometimes formed gangs armed with thorny
sticks, killed all those they believed to be impious
and even invaded the cities. In 415 a blameless
Alexandrian Neoplatonist philosopher, Hypatia,
was murdered and her body torn apart by a
horde of Christians.
In the desert some ascetics encountered the

crowds they were trying to escape. Near the
Thebaid town of Oxyrhynchos, there was said
to be a "prodigious multitude of hermits"
apparently more than 10,000, plus 20,000 virgins.
It was impossible for such large communities
to live without laws, or at least without rules. The
earliest organization of hermits into groups, the
earliest attempts at communal life and the earliest
monastic codes grew out of the need to cope with
spiritual and physical dangers and to create a new
order. The Essene sect is generally considered to be
the first of these movements in the West.
The first monasteries and convents were
founded in the Thebaid and in Syria in the fifth
century. The word "monk" comes from the
Greek word for "alone", but no member of an
order lives in seclusion. Indeed, communal living
is part of the definition of monastic life.
Monasteries left the wilderness and settled
near to and in cities fairly early on, for the desert
of stone and sand had proved incapable of
healing the desert of the soul. Other weapons
and an inner cure are needed. The Church came
back to the world, which in the meantime had
not been consumed by heavenly flames. The
desert experience did, however, leave traces in
mystical fervour (the self alone with God) and
in the need to get on with others. These traces
were born of the calls that were heard, of the
silence of heaven, of the impossibility of solitude,
of a hard, dry life, of a world not really lost, of
the troublesome devil that one always finds
within oneself, and, most of all, of the human
fabric tough and tender, ruthless and
yielding that neither wind nor sand can tame.

A PLACE OF TRIALS
by Mahin Tajadod
16
THE Persian mystic tradition compares the
spiritual quest to the crossing of desert
valleys. Sufism enumerates seven of these
valleys: quest, love, knowledge, detachment,
unity, amazement and annihilation. The path is
perilous. Asceticism to purify the soul; the dis¬
avowal of carnal passions; the renunciation of
earthly desires all these thorns wait on the
mystic's path.
Gold, the possession of goods that flatter
the eye and the heart and stir envy and desire
all the world's vanities appear as mirages in the
path of the thirsty voyager.
Every caravan needs a guide to cross the
desert; no-one would be so foolish as to ven¬
ture across the sandy wastes without someone to
lead them. Similarly, the Iranian mystic tradi¬
tion requires seekers after truth to seek the help
of pirs, masters who can show them the way.
No disciple would risk setting out on the path of
devotion without the help of an initiator to
instruct him and pass on the necessary knowl-

mythical beings and travellers who have lost their way

edge. Like a caravan-leader who holds a camel by
the reins to steer the beast and its rider through
dangerous passages, the spiritual master takes
in hand the chain of the proselyte's instruction.
Attâr, the great twelfth-century Persian poet,
describes in The Conference ofthe Birds a journey
these creatures make when they decide one day
to set off in search of their king. Guided by the
hoopoe, a bird rich in mythological associations
that was Solomon's companion and that knows
how to avoid mirages and espy waterholes from
afar, they set off for the mountain called Qâf,
home of the Simurgh, ruler of the birds. Many of
the travellers cannot stand the heat, the hunger
and thirst and, fearing the unknown, prefer to
return to pleasanter lands. Others have the
courage to endure the journey and its perils. For
want of food, water and shade many die en route.
Only thirty birds in Persian, si-murgh reach
their goal, flying over Qâf and meeting the object
of their quest in a mystic communion.
"And so those thirty birds contemplated the
face of Simurgh in the reflection of their own
faces	 They saw that it was truly the Simurgh,
and if they turned their regard on themselves,
they saw that they were the Simurgh too. Finally,
looking one way then the other, they realized
that they and the Simurgh were in reality one."
Ogres and fairies
In Persian legends and poetic epics, the desert is
also the land of ogres, génies and fairies. In his
Incantation of the Simurgh, the twelfth-cen¬
tury Iranian philosopher Suhravardi explains
how to avoid the ogres known as douâl-pa that
leaped onto travellers' shoulders and would not
come down until they had strangled them with
their legs. "As the traveller passes, the douâl-pa
suddenly throws out its legs and grips him
around the throat, so hindering his progress
that he can no longer find the Water of Life.
But I have heard it said that a man can be deliv¬
ered if he goes aboard Noah's Ark and takes in
his hand the staff of Moses."
The génies known as djinn also inhabit the
desert: they can be recognized by the clogs they
wear, and they are less dangerous than ogres or
demons. Peris, fairylike creatures who are the
personification of beauty and grace, only appear
after nightfall. The story goes that Nasir ad-
Din Shah, who ruled Persia from 1 848 to 1896,
used to dress carefully every evening, then set off
on his favourite horse to the desert to meet the
most beautiful of these fairies.
Whether the flesh is forgotten or the mind
becomes doubly sensitive to its prickings,
whether the spirit grows drowsy or gains in
lucidity, the desert is first and foremost a mirror
in which one can see the world and maybe also
glimpse the face of God. The only certainty is
that sooner or later you will see yourself. H

A PAINTER'S PARADISE
by Mona Zaalouk
The desert's abrupt changes of colour, light and mood cast a powerful spell on artists
THE desert is a mysterious and disturbing
presence. Beneath its endless surface a world
of profusion is waiting to reveal itself to
those who take time to observe, wonder and
understand.
The traveller eager for sensations feels dwarfed
by the surrounding immensity until the grandeur
of the landscapes starts to filter through.
Enveloped in the sensual softness of sand-dunes
like intertwined bodies that the changing light of
the day and of the seasons paints grey and white,
ochre and beige, one is tempted to recline and rest
for a moment before moving on to other colours,
other shapes. Keen as blades cutting through
space, the harshness of their rocky features soft¬
ened by pink or violet, lunar reliefs whose sil¬
houettes recall those of people or animals line the
horizon with visions in which the real and the
imaginary are one.
Men pass like ghosts. Where do they come
from? Where are they going?
They are the blue men, the lords of the Sahara,
wreathed in mystery, dignified, simple people
stripped of everything superfluous by their
nomadic wanderings from oasis to oasis. These
18
austere Tuareg in their flowing indigo robes,
their heads covered with a black or white chech,
are the personification of grace and majesty. The
women go unveiled, decked out with jewels and
shimmering fabrics. Other customs, other con¬
trasts are found among the bedouin of Egypt: the
men wear bright colours, while the women sport
vivid embroideries on their long black robes.
The Peul of the Sahel, a handsome people, are also
wonderful colourists: their costumes, jewels and
made-up faces create a dazzling tableau.
Leaving behind village, oasis or encampment
for a landscape of overwhelming immensity, one
is transported by the play of light and shadow to
another world, one in which dreams are as acces¬
sible as mirages. This idyllic vision is suddenly
disrupted by a furious sandstorm, describing its
crazy, whirling dance against a background of the
subtlest shades of ochre. This terrifying picture
is followed by a sunset that celebrates the end of
the day by setting the horizon alight with sheets
of red and orange. Evening falls, and one goes on
one's way beneath the stars that light thousands
of sparks in the dark night. The full moon lights
up the desert's silent vibration.

Desert Rituals ( 1 993)
by Mona Zaalouk.
In its contrasts and its changes, its airiness
and its torpor, its rhythms and its silence, its
overwhelming grandeur and its sensual delight,
the desert sums up life's essentials. But how can
anyone capture on canvas its atmosphere, its
starkness? Poets describe the impressions and
emotions of a desert journey better than the lines
and colours of the artist. Delacroix managed to
evoke them in a figurative manner; but during his
stay in North Africa his works became more
modern in style, prefiguring abstract art. Later
Paul Klee, in his Tunisian period, learned how to
catch the desert's spiritual dimension in a brush¬
stroke and a flash of colour.
The opacity of the rocky outcrops, the sense
of lightness and movement, the evanescent sense
of freedom make the desert a magnet for the
painter. After a first glance, everything in it
becomes a unity, traversed by a line around
which sky, earth and people melt into an indi¬
visible whole. The desert embodies the artist's
ultimate dream of striving to synthesize the vis¬
ible and the invisible, the figurative and the
abstract, matter and light. 19

With the unfinished railroad slashing through it,
the desert shapes the destiny of the hero in
search of his father's killer.
A similar shot features in James Cruze's The
Covered Wagon (1923). A wagon train wending
its way through a dry, stony wasteland hemmed
in by mountains looks pathetically vulnerable in
the vast threatening wilderness. In both films the
use of the desert as a strategic element lends an
epic quality to what otherwise would have been
mere adventure stories. In the history of the
Western, the desert and landscape in general
evolved from being simply a counterpoint to the
theme into a narrative device, and finally, in
two later John Ford classics, The Searchers
(1956) and Cheyenne Autumn (1964), a character
in its own right. In these films, however, the
desert is usually portrayed in a conventional
way. Its rocky wastes are associated with lone¬
liness, danger, challenge, conquest and
endurance the qualities and imagery that give
the Western its epic dimension.
A world of silence
The "Oriental" desert has different connota¬
tions in film. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco
(1930) was one of a line of films such as The
ThiefofBagdad and L'Atlantide that brought to
the cinema the glamour, but also the stereo¬
types, of a triumphant orientalism. Morocco,
dominated by the sublime Marlene Dietrich,
tells the story of an on-and-off love affair during
the colonial period, a time when fascination
with the desert inspired films ranging from
clichés to masterpieces. The cinema critic
Mostefa Lâcherai has described his impressions
of Le Diamant Vert, a now-lost film dating
from that period. "Almost fifty years ago," he
wrote, "to the best of my recollection, this fresco
11
[with its cavalcades, caravans, bedouin splendour
and crowds of extras] had the same impact on us,
both as a revelation and as a coherent aesthetic
experience, as the spectacle the French painter
and writer Eugène Fromentin (1 820-1 876) wit¬
nessed with astonishment in 1853 at El Kan-
tara, at the foot of the southern Aurès moun¬
tains, and which he described in his book Un Eté
dans le Sahara." The desert shots in Diamant
Vert were more akin to ethnographic description
than to the exotic scenes that were common in
the movies of the time.
Years later Fort Saganne (1984) featured an
unusual treatment of the desert. The film is a
faithful adaptation of a novel by Louis Gardel
which describes the gradual development of the
relationship between the characters and the sand,
which shapes their destinies and determines their
actions. In its depiction of the Sahara, Fort
Saganne shows a rarely seen aspect of desert
life a lyricism that the "people of rocks and
sand" experience with great intensity. The film is
about conquest, army life and colonization, but
in the course of the action the soldiers gradually
go to pieces until they have nothing left but the
lust for freedom that can sometimes kill more
surely than an enemy bullet. The originality of the
film lies in its treatment of the characters' difficult
physical and, above all, psychological adapta¬
tion to the total freedom of the desert, where
people used to city life must come to terms with
a scale of values that has been turned upside
down. They discover the futility of trying to
master time and space in a constantly changing
environment. The sand erodes everything except
the memory of passions. Even speech becomes
meaningless when the characters realize that the
desert is a world where life is measured out in
silence. In this respect the film is faithful to the
novel, in which Gardel wrote: "What's the point
of struggling to make an impression! What's the
point of this mindless activity except to forget the
obvious: that no act is justified by any cause;
that time swallows everything; that the void
always wins. In the Sahara, it has already won."
Arab visions
The experience of coming to terms with strange
surroundings plays a less important role in the



vision of the desert offered by Arab film-makers
in works ranging from sugary melodrama to
classics. Fleurs Sauvages ("Wild Flowers") by
Youssef Francis is more like a photo-romance
than a film, which gives it a certain representa¬
tive quality. The setting is Egypt in the 1960s. It
begins with a long sequence showing Hussein
Fahmy and Nadia Lotfi driving through the
desert in a car; there is neither dialogue nor

music. They stop twice, first at the El Alamein
military cemetery, then at an oil well. There is no
apparent reason for this trek, except, perhaps,
fascination with the barren landscape, which
takes a terrible toll in technical terms, since all the
desert shots are overexposed.
Movie buffs enjoy Fleurs Sauvages for its
over-the-top qualities. In other Arab films, such
as Tewfik Salah's Al Makhdu'un ("The
Deceived", 1971), the desert is a symbol. In this
highly personal work based on a novel by the
Palestinian writer Ghassan Kanafani, a group of
young people who have paid a smuggler to take
them across a border suffocate to death in the
back of the tanker in which they are being trans¬


ported. The desert also plays a prominent role in
Chadi Abdessalam's La momie ("The Mummy",
1969) in which the plundering of a pharaoh's
tomb serves as a metaphor for the fate of Egypt
and Egyptian culture. Abdessalam's training as an 23

architect is reflected in the way in which he lines
up his shots. (He helped design the sets forJoseph
Mankiewicz's Cleopatra andJerzy Kawalerowicz's
Faraón, both of which evoke the desert magnifi¬
cently.) There are also metaphorical elements in the
work of the Egyptian director Youssef Chahine,
who often uses the desert to score a point. In a
striking scene irom Adieu Bonaparte (1985), for
example, a tiny Napoleon is framed against the vast
expanse he is turning his back on.
Arab films sometimes take an alternative
view of the desert. L'Ombre de la terre ("The
Shadow of the Earth", 1982), by the Tunisian
director Tayeb Louhichi, challenges the idealized
image of the desert found in tourist brochures.
The desert in Louhichi's film, whose theme is
poverty and the growing marginalization of
nomad peoples, is not identified; it could be in
any Arab country where the only connection
between rulers and ruled is the identity card
and military service.
Some films attempt to discover the desert
which lies beneath appearances and conven¬
tions. One of them is Les baliseurs du désert
(1984), in which director Nacer Khemir seeks to
show the essential purity of the Thousand and
One Nights behind the orientalist imagery that
now surrounds it. But the desert can also be
shown plainly for what it is: a waterless place.
Les assoiffées (1973), by the Iraqi director
Mohammed Choukri Jamil, describes the slow
death of a village and the situation of its wom¬
enfolk.



Biblical epics
The desert has also been a backdrop for epics.
From Cecil B. de Mille's Cleopatra in 1934 to
Joseph Mankiewicz's version of the same story
in 1963, the desert has risen to the occasion.
Just as the American cinema's fascination with
history conceals audacity beneath the spectac¬
ular, in epics the desert is sometimes used as a
form of camouflage to divert attention from
controversial material. From Hollywood to
Cairo (Chahine's Saladin) and Algiers (Merzak
Allouache's Les aventures d'un héros), the desert
has sometimes succeeded in throwing sand in the
censor's eyes.
Like the desert epics, films on Biblical themes
such as William Wyler's Ben Hur (1959) and
John Huston's The Ten Commandments (1956)
and The Bible (1966), contain a historical mes¬
sage, although on a first viewing the religious
aspect seems predominant. In these films, as in
the Egyptian director Salah Abu Seif's L'Aube de
l'Islam ("The Dawn of Islam", 1970), the desert
is clearly a metaphor, a place where anything can
happen, especially divine revelation. Besides
providing part of humanity with its cultural
heritage, the desert here becomes a character
by virtue of the voices that are heard there, and
the elements that are unleashed in it form part of
the action. This is particularly noteworthy in
Abu Seif's film: since Islam forbids any repre¬
sentation of the Prophet, sand takes the place of
what cannot be shown.
In Italian cinema, Michelangelo Antonioni
presents in The Red Desert (1964) and Zabriskie
Point (1970) a unique vision of the desert as an
expression of the anguish of incommunicability.
Pasolini's desert is allegorical and forms part of
his highly personal interpretation of Judaeo-
Christian orthodoxy, leading up to the great
modern myths that are the focus of Teorema
(1969) and The Thousand and One Nights
(1974). Brazil's Cinema Novo is inspired by the
mythology of the sertâo, the semi-arid zone of
the country's northeastern region, a major lit¬
erary theme that has inspired realist works such
as Nelson Pereira Dos Santos's Vidas secas ("Dry
Lives", 1963) as well as baroque films like
Glauber Rocha's Black God, White Devil (1964)
and Antonio das Mortes (1969). For Cinema
Novo, the desert is primarily, to use Glauber
Rocha's words, "a culture of hunger".
It can also be a place to discover the
unknown, as in science fiction movies; a place
where love dies, as in Bernardo Bertolucci's The
Sheltering Sky; where heroes of the third kind
can be encountered, as in Indiana Jones; or
where power and loneliness go hand in hand, as
in Kawalerowicz's Faraón. It can serve simply as
a visual element or play a major part in the nar¬
rative structure. It can be found in all kinds of
films. Roland Barthes once spoke of the "world's
countless tales"; many of them take us to the
desert.

The River Okavango flows for

wonder whose luxuriant, emerald-

16,000 square kilometres.

kingfisher and the African fish eagle.
The region corresponds precisely
to the following definition of wet¬
lands, which features in the Con¬
vention on Wetlands of Interna¬
tional Importance especially as
Waterfowl Habitat, which was
adopted at Ramsar in Iran in 1971:
"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or
water, whether natural or artificial,
permanent or temporary, with
water that is static or flowing, fresh,
brackish or salt, including areas of
marine water the depth ofwhich at
low tides does not exceed six
metres."
A report published by the World
Conservation Union (IUCN)
describes the situation as follows:
"All deltas are notoriously unstable,
and that of the Okavango, which is
located between major fault-lines, is
a particularly fragile ecosystem; its
waters can disappear and some¬
times reappear within a genera¬
tion." Botswana is faced with severe
water shortages, made even worse
by a long drought, the worst in
southern Africa this century. Apart
from the River Chobe in the north,
the Okavango is the country's only
water source.
Aware that sustainable develop¬
ment involves wise management of
water resources, the government of
Botswana drew up a project to
increase food production and pro¬
vide water for Maun, a base for safari
companies in the south of the delta,
and for diamond mines located 280
kilometres to the south-east.
The project involved dredging 42
kilometres of waterways in the
southern part of the delta and cre¬
ating two reservoirs, each more than
100 kilometres long, which would
have submerged good agricultural
land. Local people were fiercely hos¬
tile to the idea, and Botswana's
WaterAffairs Department asked the
World Conservation Union to pro¬
duce a study on the impact of the
project. The conclusion of the study
was that there should be no
dredging and that the two reser¬
voirs should not be built, so that
the waters of the Okavango could
continue to flow and deposit their
average annual silt load of over
700,000 tons. Instead, it suggested
pumping ground water, sufficient
quantitites ofwhich are available.
STILL WATERS
While running water conjures up
an image of cleanliness and purity,
still water has a bad reputation.
Marshes, swamps and bogs are gen¬
erally thought of as gloomy, dismal,
frightening places that exhale
methane gas and are inhabited by
cold-blooded, monstrous creatures.
Malaria used to be known as marsh
fever, and the draining of swamps
has long been regarded as a public
health measure. Yet wetlands have
their uses: they play a part in replen¬
ishing ground water reserves, mod¬
erate the effects of flooding, stabilize
coastlines and protect them during
storms, retain sediments without
becoming blocked as dams do, pro¬
vide fodder for cattle, and furnish a

The Ramsar Convention sug¬
gested that contracting parties
should designate at least one wet¬
land on their territory as being of
international importance and
should take steps to preserve its
ecology. It also called on govern¬
ments to promote "wise use" ofwet¬
lands, whether or not they appear
on the Ramsar List ofWetland Sites
of International Importance. In
practice there are, of course, no
means ofenforcing the convention's
proposals.
Take the example of Canada. The

of the world's wetlands. Although
designation in itself provides no
enforcable protection for wetlands,
most of these are protected by
existing federal or provincial legisla¬
tion." Protection is badly needed for,
as the Canadian government itself
admits, agricultural draining has
destroyed 85 per cent of the wet¬
lands ofBritish Columbia, the prairie
states, southern Ontario and the
Atlantic coastal marshes.
The situation is similar in the
United States. The World Wide Fund
for Nature (WWF) estimates that
870,000 square kilometres of wet¬
lands have disappeared and that 80
per cent of one-time wetland has
been put to agricultural use. In New
Zealand, more than 90 per cent of
wetlands have vanished since the
first European settlers arrived, and
draining is still going on. Two-thirds
of the mangrove swamps in the
Philippines disappeared between
1920 and 1980 to make way for the
farming of shrimps and the fish
known as chanos. In the Caribbean
and on the Pacific coast of central
America, mangroves are burned for
charcoal. In Costa Rica their bark
provides tannin for use in leather-
working, and a national utility com¬
pany is hoping to use them as sub¬
stitutes for imported telephone
poles.

essary, as has been suggested, to
build embankments and other
structures that risk cutting off land
from the fertile silt that helps feed
the country's 110 million people?
A dozen or so dams have been
constructed on the Mekong River
and its tributaries, and have served
to produce electricity and to
increase agricultural production via
irrigation. But there have also been
negative effects. Beneficial flooding
has been reduced, and the diminu¬
tion in freshwater inflow to the
coastal zones, including the man¬
grove forests, has led to increased
salinity and a lowering of the water
level.
People seeking to protect natural
ecosystems are locked in perpetual
combat with the major construc¬

which are always on the lookout for
big public works projects. If the
environmentalists are to have any

up with detailed counter-proposals,
and persuade governments that
these ideas are feasible and also
cheaper to implement as they
have done in Botswana.

intensive or inappropriate fish
farming; and by the reduction of
surface water discharge, leading to
changes in silt deposits.
But the threat to wetlands may
also come from far away. WWF cites
dam construction on the Ebro in
Spain as an example. In the past,
more than 20 million tons of silt
were carried down to the delta each
year; now only 3 million reach it. As
a result, the complex of dunes,
lagoons and saltmarshes vital for
wildlife is being affected by
increased sea and wind erosion.
Catalan rice-growing has been
affected, because more salt is being
deposited on the rice-fields; mussel-
beds have also suffered. "We have
clearly not learned from our mis¬
takes," writes Chris Tydeman of the
British section of WWF, "for even

BRAZIL'S TURTLES
Until recently Brazil's five species

for their shells, eggs, oil and meat.
They had become an endangered
species by 1980, when the country's
Federal Agency for the Environment
launched Operation Tamar (from
"tartarugas marinhas", Portuguese
for sea-turtles). Now the very people
who once hunted turtles are paid
to protect the beaches where they
come to lay their eggs. The ex-
poachers collect the eggs, put them
in insulated boxes and take them
for reburial in open-air hatcheries in
one of 17 stations set up along the
coast under the programme. When
they have hatched, the baby turtles
are returned to the wild. A total of
265,000 young turtles were released

in this way between September
1991 and March 1992. To enable the
local population to profit from the
animals' presence without killing
them, a craft industry has been
established to sell T-shirts with
turtle motifs and sculptures in
papier-mâché and wood.
'OPERATION
LADYBIRD'
Since 1981, the parks authorities in
the city of Caen in western France
have been waging biological war¬
fare. Their weapons are ladybirds,
which eat up aphids that attack
rosebushes and other shrubs. Pre¬
viously gardeners had used chemi¬
cals against the pests, but after
training at France's National Insti¬
tute forAgronomic Research (INRA)
they took up ladybird-breeding
instead a task that in Caen only
requires two man-hours' work a day.
The operation was backed up by a
public information campaign and
educational projects carried out by
schoolchildren. Each year from
mid-March on, 40,000 hungry
larvae are released; a further 7,000
are distributed to the population at
large. These techniques may only
be effective over relatively small
areas or in greenhouses, but an
operation of this kind also can also
help to inform the public about the
risks involved in the uncontrolled
use of pesticides.
TAMING THE WILD
PEANUT
There are 80 known species of the
wild, or "forage", peanut (Arachis
pintoi), and 63 of them are native to
Brazil. While the cultivated plant is
an annual crop, the wild varieties
are perennial they grow indefi¬
nitely without replanting. They are
highly productive, and like all legu¬
minous plants they maintain soil
fertility by "fixing" atmospheric
nitrogen in nodules on their roots.
They also combat erosion and con¬
trol the weeds that attack coffee,
African oil palm, coconut and
rubber plantations. The plants are
natural pioneers, spreading into
open spaces, overcoming compe¬
tition from other plants and pro¬
ducing plentiful seed. Scientists are
now engaged in gathering as many
species as possible in the hope of

isolating genes resistant to para¬
sites and to diseases of the culti¬
vated varieties of peanut.
CLEAN SAILING?
Several international accords con¬
cerning maritime transport require
governments "to guarantee the right
of free passage for ships in interna¬
tional waters and to allow innocent
passage in their territorial waters".
However, in the name of free pas¬
sage, the measures countries take to
protect the environment outside
their territorial waters but within
their 200-mile economic zones are
not mandatory. Furthermore, agree¬
ment has not yet been reached in
international fora on requirements
concerning the qualifications of
naval officers or requirements con¬
cerning ships (such as double-hull oil
tankers to limit the risk of spills).
Since a captain's certificate can be
bought for a few hundred dollars in
some countries and ships are some¬
times dilapidated, it is hardly sur¬
prising that ecological catastrophes
happen.
THE CFC SUCCESS STORY
"It's a beautiful case study of envi¬
ronmental action. Industry has
moved more quickly than scientists
or government thought." So claims
lames Elkins of the Climate Moni¬
toring and Diagnostics Laboratory
in Boulder, Colorado (U.S.A.) with
regard to the decline in the growth of
emissions of the two chlorofluoro-
carbons (CFCs) principally blamed
for damaging the Earth's ozone layer.
Elkins, who recently published a
report on the subject in the British
journal Nature, has been measuring
CFC concentrations since 1977 at
various locations in polar, temperate
and tropical regions around the
world. The improvement in the sit¬
uation follows on a 1987 interna¬
tional protocol banning the chemi¬
cals and encouraging industrialists to
find suitable substitutes. However,
Elkins also points out that the
problem has not disappeared. "All
we've done is slowed down the
destruction (of the ozone layer). We
are still going to have Antarctic ozone
holes until the next century."

international organization
devoted to the conservation
ofnature was known as the
World Wildlife Fund. In 1986 it
changed its name to World Wide

United States and Canada the old
title is still used.
The change reflects the broad¬
ening scope of the organization's
field ofaction. OriginallyWWF was
a small organization that concen¬
trated on problems such as endan¬

technical aid.
Among its initiatives is a wildlife

the holy city of Vrindavan, where
Hindus believe Krishna was born, to
replant the once shady path that
attracts millions of pilgrims each
year. The sacred site, which lies not
far from Delhi, features an 1 1 -kilo¬
metre path that had become
denuded and strewn with litter. In
1992 the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness, with the
aid ofWWF, established a nursery of

HIDDEN WATERS 3y Daniel Balland
For centuries arid land in many parts of the world has been
made fertile by tapping underground mountain water through
tunnels often several kilometres long that are masterpieces of
hydraulic engineering
30
THE world's biggest and oldest oases are, to
adapt Herodotus's celebrated phrase about
Egypt, the "gifts" of great rivers such as the
Nile, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Helmand, the
Indus, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, the
Tarim and others. However, it is in the extraction
of "hidden" water from underground aquifers
that oasis-dwellers have shown their genius for
hydraulic engineering. An extraordinary range
of techniques have been used for this purpose.
Most of them share a common characteristic: the
use of an external energy-source to raise the
water from the aquifer to the fields that need irri¬
gating.
There is, however, a remarkable exception to
this rule. The drainage tunnels known as qanats
in Arabic and kârêz in Persian are driven into
hillsides virtually horizontally, with just enough
slope to allow water tapped from an under¬
ground source to flow off into the open air by
the force of gravity alone. A regular 0.1 or 0.2%
gradient (which is to say an incline of a metre or
two per kilometre) is about right: less than that,
and the slope encourages alluviation, so the tun¬
nels need to be cleaned out more often; more,
and the flow of water causes excessive erosion.
Each tunnel divides into a tapping section
penetrating into the aquifer and a downstream
section that carries the water out to the fields.
The amount of water extracted, and therefore the
surface area irrigated, depends on the length of
the former. The tunnel must be big enough for
a man to move about and work in. Typically, it
may be 1.3 metres high by 80 centimetres wide.
Lengths vary greatly, from a few hundred metres
to several dozen kilometres; the average seems
to be about three kilometres.
On the surface the only sign that there is a
tunnel is a line of air-vents sunk every 20 metres
or so. These vertical shafts, which provided
access when the tunnel was being dug, are used

Mountains (Iran), the

subsequently for maintenance work. The further
up the hillside they are, the deeper they are.
Shafts several dozen metres deep are common;
some may be far deeper than that. Each one is
surrounded by a ring of rubble, like some giant
molehill pierced in the middle by the vent itself.
At the point where the tunnel emerges into
the open air, there is always something magical
about the sight of fresh water flowing naturally
all the year round into a pool or irrigation
channel. Women and children come to fetch
unpolluted water, and the menfolk like to gather
here after the day's work. This is a focal point of
social life in the oasis.
Some small oases are irrigated by a single
tunnel, but more commonly several some¬
times even several dozen form an organized
network. In some cases the system is added on
to a network of channels diverted from a river.
When building an underground infrastructure of
this type, whether simple or complex, specialists
have to decide on three essential matters: the
location and depth of the aquifer that is to
be tapped; the area to be irrigated; and the direc¬
tion and slope of the tunnel needed to connect
the two. Building the tunnel is a long and dan¬
gerous job. It is only really feasible when labour
is cheap and plentiful, typically under some
form of agrarian capitalism based on slave-
owning or a feudal system. Most of the tunnels

currently in use are, therefore, survivals from
the past, living fossils that are kept in working
order with varying degrees of success. Clearing
them out is a relatively straightforward job,
but rebuilding them when they collapse or
lengthening them to compensate for a lowering
of the water table are difficult and expensive
operations.
It is estimated that some 30,000 tunnels are
today in use in different parts of the world.
Placed end to end, they would stretch for more
than 100,000 kilometres, or over two and a half
times round the Earth.
Orientai satrapies
and New World colonies
Although some scholars have tried hard to prove
that this irrigation system originated in their own
part of the world, it seems to have spread as a
result of a fairly straightforward process of dif¬
fusion. The most comprehensive treatise on the
art of digging a kârêz, the Kitâb inbât al-miyâh
al-Khafiyya, or "Book of the Extraction of
Hidden Waters", was written in Arabic in about
1019 A.D. by Mohammed al-Karadji. As his
name suggests, the author came from Karadj, a
town that once stood on the slopes of the Zagros
Mountains, 100 kilometres southeast of
Hamadan. Now Hamadan, as it happens, is the
ancient Ecbatana, imperial capital of the Medes
and summer residence of the first Achaemenids
in other words, the centre of the very region that
was the cradle and principal diffusion point of this
irrigation technique.
The construction of kârêz in fact originated in
the kingdom of Urartu, in the district surrounding
Lake Urmia, early in the last millennium of the
pre-Christian era. It probably developed as a
simple dewatering technique designed to run off
seepage threatening to inundate mines that pen¬
etrated a subterranean aquifer. The genius of the
people of Urartu lay in transforming it into a
technique to tap water for irrigation.

A by-product of the mining economy, kârêz
irrigation is known to have existed by the late
eighth century B.C. In the course of the next
four centuries it spread, with state encourage¬
ment, throughout the lands of the Persian
Achaemenid Empire, from the oriental satrapies
of Arachosia and Gandhara (in present-day
Afghanistan and Baluchistan) to the western
satrapies of Egypt, Arabia and Syria. From there
the Phoenicians, who founded Carthage and
played an important part in the transmission
of oriental techniques to the Mediterranean
West, introduced it to North Africa.
In the following centuries kârêz were intro¬
duced to various peripheral regions, but there
was little technical innovation, even in the
Islamic era, which in other respects was so fer¬
tile in agricultural innovation. There was a half¬
hearted attempt to introduce the system to the
Deccan, but only as far as we know at a few iso¬
lated sites such as Ahmadnagar and Burhanpur.
It was used on a far larger scale in Spain, where
tunnels were dug as far north as the Ebro basin
and in Catalonia. The only surviving evidence
for it today is that of place-names, starting with
the name Madrid, which derives from the Arabic
madjrît, meaning "place where there are
madjrâ", one of the words that were used to
denote the tunnels in the Iberian peninsula.
Spain's importance in the history of the kârêz
stems principally from its role as a secondary
centre of diffusion from which the technique
spread to areas where it is still used today. These
areas include Lanzarote in the Canary Islands,
the former Spanish colonies in America and
also the western Maghreb, where the system
may have been used in Almoravid times in the
ninth century A.D. The area in which the tech¬
nique came into use most recently is generally
considered to be the Xinjiang region of China,
where its introduction is normally dated to the
eighteenth century. It may, however, have arrived
there much earlier via that great cultural
highway, the Silk Road.
Standing
the test of time
Meanwhile, by far the greatest concentration
of tunnels in the world is undoubtedly on the
dry uplands of the Irano-Afghan plateau, at the
heart of the ancient Achaemenid Empire. Of
the 30,000 kârêz known in the world today,
Afghanistan has one fifth and Iran three fifths.
The borders of the central Iranian desert are
probably the place where the "hidden water
civilization" has reached its highest degree of
technical perfection. The moqanni (workers
who specialize in digging kârêz) of Yazd have

always rightly been held in high regard. It is in
their area that the longest and deepest tunnels, the
product of extraordinary technical prowess, are
found. Here too ingenious systems of tunnels
on different levels were designed and constructed,
with lower tunnels collecting infiltration from
those above. In tunnels where the flow was par¬
ticularly abundant extraordinary underground
water-mills were built, accessible to pack ani¬
mals via no less amazing sloping tunnels.
What are the prospects for this form of irri¬
gation? It is reportedly in decline everywhere,
not so much because many of the tunnels are dis¬
appearing as because they are not being replaced
when they fall into disuse. When a tunnel ran
dry in the past, a new one was constructed some
distance away, for unlike river oases which are
forever physically tied to the stream that replen¬
ishes them, kârêz oases were to some extent
moveable. This is no longer the case now that a
massive exodus from the countryside has com¬
bined with galloping wage inflation to virtu
ally do away with all new construction, partic¬
ularly in the oil-producing countries. Now
when a tunnel dries up, wells equipped with
motor-pumps are dug, contributing to the low¬
ering of the water table and speeding up the
decline of the kârêz network.
Here and there, however, a reaction is setting
in, and oasis-dwellers are coming up with orig¬
inal solutions to the problems confronting them.
Farmers in the Gourara region of Algeria are
attempting to revive tunnels that are running dry
by installing motor-pumps in them. Similar
steps have been taken in Xinjiang, where wells
sunk near to kârêz have been connected to them
in order to increase their discharge. This com¬
bination of modern and traditional techniques
permits tunnels that otherwise would have been
abandoned to remain in use, at least for a time.
Once threatened with extinction, the "civi¬
lization of hidden waters" that has profoundly
shaped the development of many oases still
seems to have a bright future. 33

A LONG LOOK AT THE WORLD'S ARID
3y Michel Bâtisse

LANDS Unesco's pioneering work in arid zone research,
begun over 40 years ago, was the starting
point for a continuing effort to mobilize science
in the cause of the global environment
UNE!; c o in ACTION

H
UMANKIND has always encountered
aridity, and over the ages has learned how
to come to terms with it by using water
wisely. Until very recently, however, the indus¬
trialized world viewed arid regions as little more
than the impoverished habitat of a few nomads, or
as a place of adventure or meditation for those
wishing to follow in the footsteps of people like
Lawrence of Arabia and the French explorer and
missionary Father Charles de Foucauld. Scientific
knowledge of the desert was limited to geo¬
graphical descriptions. Only a handful of dreamers
wondered how these desolate areas could be used.
There was plenty of room elsewhere.
The situation changed after the Second
World War with the emergence of newly inde¬
pendent nations facing serious demographic
and food supply problems. In 1948, UNESCO's
General Conference in Beirut adopted a pro¬
posal put forward by India and considered
surprising by many at the time to the effect
that UNESCO should examine the possibility of
establishing an international institute for the
arid zone. The following year a group of experts
was invited to Paris to study the question. The
panel wisely ruled out the idea of a centralized
institute located far from most of the areas con¬
cerned, which are widely scattered across the
globe, and recommended instead that an inter¬
national advisory committee be established. The
new body's first session was held in Algiers in
April 1951. This was the origin of UNESCO's
Arid Zone Research Programme.
Few people today remember the achieve¬
ments of this programme. Leading scientists from
different countries and disciplines served on the
advisory committee, under whose guidance a
series of innovative activities was carried out for
a modest outlay during more than a decade.
The first task was to draw up a complex and
detailed map showing the world's arid zones

on an innovative projection of the globe that



resembles the four quarters of an orange. It
became the programme's emblem, and appears
on some thirty documents in the "Arid Zone

1953 and 1969. Today these books with their

legacy of UNESCO's activities in this period.
They examine subjects such as hydrology, cli¬
matology, plant ecology, solar and wind energy,
nomads, and human psychology and physi¬
ology. One of them is devoted to the first world
symposium on climate change a topic very
much in the news today which was held in
Rome in 1961. Another contains a "History of
Land Use in Arid Regions", which describes
the long struggle for survival in these hostile

environments in Egypt, Mesopotamia, central
Asia, Peru, Mexico and on the Indus.



The first steps
UNESCO did more than publish reviews of
research and promote the exchange of infor¬
mation. It also encouraged scientific research
in the field and trained hundreds of specialists.
Above all, in 1957 it upgraded what had hitherto
been one programme among many to the rank
of a "Major Project" with additional funding.
This new status helped to raise the profile of
activities that were already under way as well as
spurring interdisciplinary research and the cre¬
ation of national centres to promote the devel¬
opment of arid regions. The Indian Arid Zone
Research Institute in Jodhpur and Israel's Negev
Desert Institute in Beersheba were established
under the auspices of UNESCO, which also lent
support to other bodies, such as the Egyptian
Desert Institute in Cairo.
The Major Project on arid lands paved the
way for technical co-operation between the
industrialized countries of the North and the
impoverished nations of the South today a
firmly established practice and laid the ground¬
work for a horizontal exchange of skills and
experience between the latter. At the same time
it demonstrated what could be gained from
establishing a more direct dialogue between sci¬
entists and resource managers. This is still
important today for determining to what extent
research findings are applicable and are actu¬
ally applied in the field.
It is one thing to make theoretical studies
based on a wide range of disciplines; imple¬
mentation of their findings is another since it is
confronted with social, economic and political
factors at the local and national levels and
even at the international level through the inter¬
play of world market forces and strategic inter¬
ests. The Major Project showed that the conve¬
nient expression "arid zone" covers a very wide
range of different situations. It taught us that
what might be valid for one place is not neces¬
sarily so for another.
UNESCO's analysis of the factors that con¬
tribute to aridity led to the preparation of a new
world map that was published on the occasion
of the United Nations Conference on Deserti¬
fication held in Nairobi in 1977. It revealed the
whole range of climatic conditions involved,
from the extreme aridity of sandy or rocky
deserts to the many so-called semi-arid or sub-
humid regions, in which farming and grazing
activities are practicable, while entailing more or

less severe risks of degradation. Furthermore, the
fact that the same physical and biological con¬
ditions obtain in a number of areas does not
necessarily mean that these areas share the same
economic, social and cultural environment; nor
are the same solutions necessarily applicable to
all areas with a given degree of aridity.
One example among thousands may serve to
illustrate this problem. One of the goals of the
arid zone programme was to find out the max¬
imum level of salinity in water that could be
used for irrigation. A study project was devel¬
oped for Tunisia and presented for financing to
the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP). The first reaction, based on expert
advice, was totally negative. The reason given
was that the water in question contained more
than one gram of salt per litre and that research
by a laboratory in California generally accepted
as an authority in this field had shown that
water with such a high degree of salinity could
not reasonably be used for irrigation. The
problem was that this was the only water avail¬
able in Tunisia, and that farmers there had been
using it to grow crops for some 2,000 years!
The project was eventually approved. It turned
out successfully and has served as a model for
several Arab countries.
Asset or burden?
Most arid zones are areas where economic
activity is negligible. Their sunny skies and open
spaces are advantages in countries with other
assets, such as the United States and Australia.
They are ideal for geological research because of
their lack of vegetation. They may also contain
large deposits of minerals and other natural
resources, as in the case of the oil-rich countries



of the Middle East, which are wealthy enough to
subsidize irrigation, deplete their fossil aquifers
and run energy-intensive sea-water desaliniza-
tion plants. For countries like India, Kenya and
38
Brazil, however, arid zones are an additional
burden to their considerable economic and
demographic problems. Other countries, such as
Mauritania and Somalia, have nothing but arid
land to live on.
It is not surprising, therefore, that research
findings are not always applied or that countries
affected by desertification such as those of the
African Sahel, whose plight shocked the world,
are not inclined to attach priority to their
drought-stricken areas. Most of these countries
would rather channel their investments to more
productive land, unless there are sound political
or strategic reasons to do otherwise.
And yet remedies for desertification caused by
population pressure and overgrazing are far from
unknown. They consist of sustainable manage¬
ment of marginal ecosystems, appropriate eco¬
nomic and social development, and more efficient
use of human resources. The lessons of UNESCO's
work, underscored by the United Nations Con¬
ference on Desertification, show that the tech¬
nology exists to maintain agricultural output and
raise living standards, and consequently keep
populations from migrating. The necessary water
and soils can be found, even in the vast Sahel.
However, this presupposes a rapid transition
from a low level of education and technical skill
to the ability to practise modern forms of irriga¬
tion and grazing. It takes time to turn traditional
nomads into efficient farmers, and such a transi¬
tion calls for massive institutional, technical and
financial backing. In a sense, the development
of arid zones raises a problem that is found in all
countries, even the richest: how to use the least
productive areas and how to develop an inte¬
grated land use strategy.
Science to serve the environment
Given these conditions, it is not surprising that
UNESCO's work on arid zones, begun over four
decades ago, is still far from over. The Major
Project was only the start of a long, far-reaching
United Nations effort to use science in the ser¬
vice of the environment and development. The
problem of aridity poses the problem of water
resources, which led UNESCO to launch a new
research programme, in this case based on inter¬
governmental co-operation, into the cycles,
amount and quality of the world's fresh water.
This was the International Hydrological Decade,
in which more than a hundred countries took
part between 1965 and 1974. It was followed in
its turn by the International Hydrological Pro¬
gramme, which still goes on today.
One important step forward made by the
Major Project was to reveal the complexity of
the interactions between natural phenomena

and human activities and to show the need for an
interdisciplinary strategy to understand and
control these interactions. In 1968 an intergov¬
ernmental conference on the "scientific basis
for rational use and conservation of the resources



of the biosphere" was held in Paris. This meeting
was an extension of the arid zone programme
and took account of its experience and the net¬
work of contacts it had created. It focused on all
the world's ecosystems, not just arid zones.
After all, the problems that are emerging every¬
where today are caused by the same conflict
between the functioning of nature and the pres¬
sure of human activity.
It was the biosphere conference, held twenty-
five years ago, that launched the idea that the
use and the conservation of nature should be
reconciled, in other words the notion of "sus¬
tainable development" which was solemnly
adopted by the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED) held
in Rio de Janeiro last year. It also called for the
launching of a new worldwide research pro¬
gramme on "Man and the Biosphere" the MAB
programme which is still the main instrument
at the disposal of UNESCO and its member states
for proposing scientifically acceptable solutions
to the problems posed by the use of land and its
resources by the human race, whose numbers
and appetites continue to increase.

UNESCO IN ACTION

THERE are more arid lands in Africa than in
any other continent. In addition to these
natural deserts where there is very little
rainfall, there is also an area twice as large, strad¬
dling the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, that
receives insufficient rainfall and is affected to
varying degrees by processes that lead to deser¬
tification.
The problem, whose main cause is human
activity, is not new but rapidly expanding human
and animal populations are making it worse
and more widespread by increasing the pressure
on fragile ecosystems.
The severe drought that struck the Sudano-
Sahelian region of Africa between 1968 and
1973 drew attention to this disruption in the
ecological balance and to the deterioration of
living conditions in the region. It also brought
widespread sympathy and support for the
people of the Sahel, and sparked a new interest
in arid regions that found expression notably in
the United Nations Conference on Desertifi¬
cation held in Nairobi in 1977. The Conference
was followed by numerous regional initiatives,
including the creation of an interstate com¬
mittee on drought control in the Sahel. Within
the framework of its Man and the Biosphere
(MAB) programme, UNESCO launched a
number of projects which provided an oppor-

tunity for specialists in the field to share expe¬
riences and information.
From 1976 to 1987 the integrated project
on arid lands in northern Kenya, implemented
in co-operation with the United Nations Envi¬
ronment Programme (UNEP) and with assis¬
tance from Germany, focused on traditional
livestock farming systems in the dry lands of
northern Kenya. The main aim was to develop
these systems in such a way as to improve local
living conditions while also protecting the envi¬
ronment.
The region's climate, soils, flora, fauna and
water resources were analysed as part of the
project, which led to the establishment of a
management plan for about half the 22,500-
square-kilometre area studied, which extended
between Lake Turkana and Mount Marsabit.
The integrated project on arid zones in
southern Tunisia, implemented between 1980
and 1984 with support from UNEP, took a very
different approach. This part of Tunisia had
already been extensively studied, and the project
sought to update research findings and put them
to better use, and to extend training programmes
designed to develop local skills. As a follow-up,
a pilot project on desertification control in
southern Tunisia was carried out, in which
remote sensing was used for continuous moni¬
toring of desertification. The pilot project also
focused on the ecology of plants that hold down
the sand and on improving plant cover, notably
by extending the planting of species that could
serve as fodder.
The project's results provided the technical
basis of the anti-desertification strategy adopted
by the Tunisian government in 1986.
The project on training for integrated pas¬
toral management in the Sahel concentrated
largely on the development of human resources
and on the adoption of a new approach to rural
development specially adapted to local condi¬
tions. Between 1980 and 1989 112 senior man¬
agerial staff and 151 technicians from twelve
countries in the Sudano-Sahel region were
trained, and ten regional seminars on agricul¬
tural, pastoral and sylvicultural development
were held.
The training programmes encouraged a com¬
prehensive, interdisciplinary approach to the
problems of the Sahel that took account of the
different aspects of development biophysical,
socio-economic and technical and of the rela¬
tions between them.

THE LAST FREE COUNTRY...
It was as if there were no names here, as if there were no words. The desert washed everything away in the wind, obliterated everything. The men had the
freedom of the wide open spaces in their eyes; their skin was like metal. The sunlight exploded everywhere. Ochre, yellow, grey and white, the light sand
shifted, revealing the wind. It covered every footprint, every bone. It repelled light, drove water, life, far from a centre that nobody could recognize. The men
knew that the desert didn't want them; so they walked without stopping, on paths other feet had already trodden, to find something else. As for water, it
was in the aiun, eyes the colour of the sky, or in the damp beds of ancient mudstreams. But it was not water for pleasure or for rest. It was just a trace of '
sweot on the surface of the desert, the parsimonious gift of a dry god, the last spasm of life. Heavy water torn from the sand, dead water of the fissures,
alkaline water that caused stomach pains and made people vomit. Keep on going, then, bent a little forward, in the direction the stars had given.
But it was perhaps the lost and only free country, the country where men's laws had no importance. A country for the stones and for the wind, but also
for scorpions and jerboas, creatures that know how to take refuge when the sun burns down and the night is frosty.

current concern



THE PRICE
OF
PEACE
THE world has changed. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989
and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the
end of Cold War confrontation between the two major
power blocs, which is undoubtedly the most important polit¬
ical transformation of the last few years.
What has this meant for world peace? The geopolitical
interpretation, perhaps the commonest, maintains that bipolarity
based on the existence of two nuclear powers of equal strength
was the guarantee of peace over the last forty years. Now that
this balance of terror has disappeared, all kinds of wars are once
again possible.
I do not share this view of "negative peace". In the first place,
it is inaccurate since, while applicable in some degree to Europe,
it does not take account of the hundreds of wars that have
devastated other parts of the planet since 1945. Secondly and
most importantly, it overlooks the perverse effects of the'
unquestioned paradox that "war is unthinkable but disarma¬
ment is impossible", which made superpower confrontation the
inescapable fate of several generations and justified the arms race
as the only rational solution.
The end of the Cold War has nullified the logic of this rea¬
soning. The widespread propagation of violence, which is a
characteristic of the second half of the twentieth century, today
appears to us as a self-evident fact and forces us to recognize that
the nature of war and its protagonists have changed. War, today
assumes the form of civil war and its belligerents are not states
but the distinctive communities ethnic and social which
seek political fulfilment to compensate for their personal, cul¬
tural and social frustrations.
This exaggerated desire for political compensation explains
why the achievement of freedom in the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe has mainly taken the form of a radical affir¬
mation of the integrity of their collective identities and has
been reflected in intransigent and violent claims for the restora¬
tion of ideal frontiers. The Geophysical Institute of the Moscow
Academy of Sciences reported in 1 99 1 that of the twenty-three
frontiers that separated the different republics only three were
fully accepted, which put at seventy- five the number of poten-

tial trouble spots, seventeen of which were already the scene of seeds of coexistence in places where today we are reaping the

Rabindranath Tagore
A greater awareness oftruth
The letterpublished below, in
abridgedform, appeared in
Correspondance, ajournaipublished
(in French) by the International
Institute ofIntellectual Co-operation.
It was sent in 1934 by Rabindranath
Tagore to the British classical scholar
GilbertMurray. In response to
Murray's "friendly appeal"fora
"closer comprehension ofthe
problemsfaced by our common
humanity", the greatBengali writer,
who had won the Nobel Prizefor
Literature in 1913, set out to "deal
with some details ofourpresent
problems ofIndia andput them in
relation to the larger aspect of
international relationship as I view
it". For Tagore, then aged seventy-
three, it was an opportunity to express
yetagain his unshakable confidence
in humanity.
"Uttarayan",
Santiniketan, Bengal.
September 16th, 1934.
My Dear Professor Murray,
.... I must confess at once that I do
not see any solution of the intricate evils of
disharmonious relationship between
nations, nor can I point out any path which
may lead us immediately to the levels of
sanity. Like yourself, I find much that is
deeply distressing in modern conditions,
and I am in complete agreement with you
again in believing that at no other period
of history has mankind as a whole been
more alive to the need ofhuman co-oper
ation, more conscious of the inevitable
and inescapable moral links which hold
together the fabric ofhuman civilization.
I cannot afford to lose my faith in this
inner spirit ofman, nor in the sureness of
human progress which following the
upward path ofstruggle and travail is con¬
stantly achieving, through cyclic darkness
and doubt, its ever-widening ranges of
fulfilment	
Now that mutual intercourse has
become easy, and the different peoples
and nations of the world have come to
know one another in various relations,
one might have thought that the time had
arrived to merge their differences in a
common unity. But the significant thing is,
that the more the doors are opening and
the walls are breaking down outwardly,
the greater is the force which the con¬
sciousness of individual distinction is
gaining within	
Individuality is precious, because only
through it can we realize the universal.
Unfortunately there are people who take
enormous pride in magnifying their spe¬
ciality and proclaiming to the world that
Rabindranath Tagore (1 86 1- 194 1).
they are fixed for ever on their pedestal of
uniqueness. They forget that only discords
are unique and therefore can claim their
own separate place outside the universal
world of music.
It should be the function of religion to
provide us with this universal ideal of truth
and maintain it in its purity. But men have
often made perverse use of their religion,
building with it permanent walls to ensure
their own separateness. Christianity, when
it minimizes its spiritual truth, which is
universal, and emphasizes its dogmatic
side, which is a mere accretion of time,
has the same effect of creating a mental
obstruction which leads to the misunder¬
standing of people who are outside its
pale	
We have seen Europe cruelly unscrupu¬
lous in its politics and commerce, widely
spreading slavery over the face of the Earth
in various names and forms. And yet, in
this very same Europe, protest is always
alive against its own iniquities. Martyrs
are never absent whose lives ofsacrifice are
the penance for the wrongs done by their
own kindred. The individuality which is
Western is not to be designated by any
sect-name of a particular religion, but is
distinguished by its eager attitude towards
truth, in two of its aspects, scientific and
humanistic. This openness of mind to
truth has also its moral value and so in
the West it has often been noticed that,
while those who are professedly pious
have sided with tyrannical power, encour¬
aging repression of freedom, the men of
intellect, the sceptics, have bravely stood
for justice and the rights of man	
In India we have ourselves become
material-minded. We are wanting in faith
and courage. Since in our country the gods
are sleeping, therefore, when the Titans
come, they devour all our sacrificial offer-

ings there is never a hint of strife. The
germs ofdisease are everywhere; but man
can resist disease only when his vital force
is active and powerful.
So, too, even when the worship of the
blood-thirsty and false gods ofself-seeking
are rampant on all sides, man can lift up
his head to the skies if his spirit is awake.
Both matter and spirit are active. They
alone become entirely materialistic who
are only half men, who cripple the native
majesty of the spirit before the blind rep¬
etition of unintelligent activities; who are
niggardly in knowledge and palsied in
action; who are ever insulting themselves
by setting up a meaningless ritual in the
place of true worship	
Beggars at thegate
In India, what is needed more than any¬
thing else is the broad mind which, only
because it is conscious of its own vigorous
individuality, is not afraid of accepting
truth from all sources	 I have come to
feel that the mind which has been matured
in the atmosphere of a profound knowl¬
edge of its own country, and of the perfect
thoughts that have been produced in that
land, is ready to accept and assimilate the
cultures that come from foreign countries.
He who has no wealth ofhis own can only
beg, and those who are compelled to
follow the profession of beggary at the
gate of the intellectually rich may gain
occasional scraps ofmental food, but they
are sure to lose the strength of their intel¬
lectual character and their minds are
doomed to become timid in thought and
in creative endeavour.
A certain number of us do not admit
that our culture has any special features of
value. These good people I leave out of
account. But the number of those others is
not few, who while admitting this value
in theory, ignore it more or less in practice.
Very often, the flourishing of the banner of
this culture is not for the sake of the love of
truth but for that of national vain-glori-
ousness like brandishing a musical
instrument in athletic display before one's
own admiring family, instead ofusing it to
make music	
The evolving Hindu social ideal has
never been present to us as a whole, so
that we have only a vague conception of
what the Hindu has achieved in the past,
or can attempt in the future. The partial
view before us at any moment appears at
the time to be the most important, so we
can hardly bring ourselves to the true ideal,
but tend to destroy it. And there we stand
fasting and telling beads, emaciated with
doing penance, shrinking into a corner
away from the rest of the world.
We forget that Hindu civilization was
once very much alive, crossing the seas,
planting colonies, giving to and taking
from all the world. It had its arts, its com¬
merce, its vast and strenuous field ofwork.
In its history, new ideas had their oppor¬
tunity. Its women also had their learning,
their bravery, their place in the civic life. In
every page of the Mahabharata we shall
find proofs that it was no rigid, cast-iron
type ofcivilization. The men of those days
did not, like marionettes, play the same set
piece over and over again. They progressed
through mistakes, made discoveries
through experiment, and gained truth
through striving	
Man shows his mental feebleness when
he loses his faith in life because it is diffi¬
cult to govern, and is only willing to take
the responsibility of the dead because they
are content to lie still under an elaborately
decorated tombstone of his own make.
We must know that life carries its own
weight, while the burden of the dead is
heavy to bear an intolerable burden
which has been pressing upon our country
for ages.
The fact stands out clearly today that
the Divinity dwelling within the heart of
man cannot be kept immured any longer
in the darkness of particular temples. The
day of the Ratha-yatra, the Car Festival, has
arrived when He shall come out on the
high way of the world, into the thick of
the joys and sorrows, the mutual com¬
merce, of the throng of men. Each of us
must set to work to build such a car as we
can, to take its place in the grand proces¬
sion. The material ofsome maybe ofvalue,
of others cheap. Some may break down
on the way, others last till the end. But the
day has come at last when all the cars must
set out.
The great awakening
Your letter has been a confirmation to
me ofthe deep faith in the ultimate truths
of humanity which we both try to serve

and which sustains our being. I have tried
to express howreligion today as it exists in
its prevalent institutionalized forms both
in the West and the East has failed in its
function to control and guide the forces of
humanity; how the growth ofnationalism
and wide commerce of ideas through
speeded-up communication have often
augmented external differences instead
of bringing humanity together. Develop¬
ment of organizing power, mastery over
Nature's resources have subserved secret
passions or the openly flaunted greed of
unashamed national glorification. And yet
I do not feel despondent about the future,
for the great fact remains that man has
never stopped in his urge for self-expres¬
sion, in his brave quest for knowledge; not
only so, there is today all over the world in
spite of selfishness and unreason a greater
awareness of truth	
In India, too, there is a great awakening
everywhere, mainly under the inspiration
of Mahatma Gandhi's singular purity of
will and conduct, which is creating a new
generation ofclear-minded servers ofour
peoples	
I feel proud that I have been born in
this great Age. I know that it must take
time before we can adjust our minds to a
condition which is not only new, but
almost exactly the opposite of the old. Let
us announce to the world that the light of
the morning has come, not for entrenching
ourselves behind barriers, but for meeting
in mutual understanding and trust on the
common field of co-operation; never for
nourishing a spirit of rejection, but for
that glad acceptance which constantly
carries in itself the giving out of the best
that we have.
Yours sincerely,

The StoneAge temples ofMalta
byAnn Monsarrat
46
During the first half of the present
centuryEuropean archaeologists,
puzzling over the similarities
between ancient cultures, came up with
the diffusion theory: a steady spread west¬
wards of ideas, skills and inventions from
the early civilizations of the Near East. In
this way the mud-brickziggurats ofancient
Sumeria (the first temples known to man)
had influenced the Egyptian pyramids (the
oldest stone monuments in the world) and
Malta's megalithic buildings were a mere
reflection of the glories of ancient Greece.
There was only one problem. They had
no way of confirming exactly when any¬
thing had happened. Then came radio¬
carbon dating, an offshoot of the research
that produced the atomic bomb. The first
radiocarbon dates did little to disturb the
basic fabric of the theory, but when the
technique was refined in the mid-1960s it
blewholes through the entire edifice. Small
communities, previously considered to be
talented imitators, were shown to have
been ingenious innovators astonishingly
advanced for their time.
The Egyptians could no longer be said to
have created the oldest free-standing stone
monuments in the world because the Stone
Age temple builders of Malta had beaten
them to it.
The new dating showed that in the tiny
cluster of Maltese islands, way out in the
middle of the Mediterranean, a people
without awritten language or knowledge of
any kind of metal had raised vast, highly
sophisticated structures several hundred
years before the Egyptians began work on
their own triumphs in stone. They had
begun building around 3600 B.C. and con¬
tinued for over a thousand years.
They built their temples singly and in
groups, added to them, embellished and
enlarged them. Their richly decorated inte¬
riors were previously thought to have been
inspired by the great Greek civilizations
of Crete and Mycenae, but it is now clear
that Malta's temple culture had flourished
and died before the Greek civilizations
were born.
The imposing temple complex at Hagar
Qim in Malta.
Today four of the largest temple com¬
plexes figure on the tourist trail. At least
forty more survive in various stages ofdis¬
array. Others have disappeared completely,
spirited away into boundary walls and
house foundations. They were built on a
small archipelago with a total land area
of little more than 300 square kilometres:
a massive stone construction for every
seven square kilometres. As British archae¬
ologist David Trump has written: "there
is probably no other area of this size in
the world with such a number and variety
of antiquities."
The oldest and best preserved of the
temples is on Gozo, the second largest and
most northerly of the islands. As with all
their other temples the builders selected a
choice site. Its great, grey mass stands on
one of the island's distinctive flat-topped
hills above a fertile valley. Its vast mega¬
liths, never completely covered by the
silting up of time, led to folk stories of a
female giant who, by day, strode the land
carrying the great slabs on her head, and
built by night. It is still called Ggantija, the
Maltese word for giantess.
The builders found on the islands an
abundance of two kinds of limestone: a
durable grey upper layer and beneath it
one that cuts and looks like butter. They
put both to good use in nearly all of their
temples but nowhere else did they build a
surrounding wall quite as astonishing as
the one at Ggantija. Massive blocks ofhard
grey stone, one of them the size ofa small
cottage, are laid alternately upright and
sideways to form a first course eight metres
high. Above them smaller blocks teeter
upwards for a further two metres.
Two temples, with great lobed cham¬
bers, built of smaller stones, share this
colossal overcoat. The two entrances stand
side by side on the concave façade, flanked
by pillars of soft, golden limestone once

doubtless capped by lintels of equally
impressive dimensions. The oldest temple
has a threshold made of one enormous
slab ofgolden stone and beside it lie round
rocks, the size of cannon balls, that rolled
it into place. The interior walls were orig¬
inally plastered and painted with red
ochre, the remains ofwhich could still be
seen clinging to the stones until only a
few years ago.
Unhappily, Ggantija was the first of the

THE IMPACT OF TOURISM
The influx of tourists over the past twenty
years or so has been both good and bad for
Malta's neolithic remains. Temples built to
receive only a select few are now daily bom¬
barded by coachloads of sightseers. How¬
ever, the enthusiasm of foreign visitors does
seem to have contributed to a growing local
awareness of the inestimable value of these
national, indeed world, treasures. The listing
in 1993 as World Heritage Sites of all the
buildings of Malta's Temple Period (which
are now regarded as a single unique phe¬
nomenon) has given this awareness an
additional boost.
The islands' prosperity, to which tourism
has been a large contributor, means that more
funds are available to help preserve the mon¬
uments. Rescue archaeology is well organized,
and Malta's university is providing more
archaeologists to deal with it.
PRESERVATION
The preservation of so many sites is an
undoubted burden for a small nation with a
population of only 350,000, but in the last
few years great strides have been made and
the help ofworld experts enlisted.
Unesco has funded the plans for a com¬
prehensive scheme for the preservation ofthe
Hypogeum ofHal Saflieni and is contributing
to the costs ofputting them into effect. Within
a year this unique subterranean complex
should have its own microclimate and a care¬
fully controlled number ofvisitors.
For years the main temples have been
caged in unsightly iron railings but these are
now coming down and the buildings are
gradually being protected instead by archae¬
ological parks. The aim is again to set them in
an appropriate landscape and to tactfully
discourage all but the seriously interested
visitor from exploring the actual remains.
Last year the entrance fees were raised from
a sum hardly worth collecting to one com¬
parable with museum prices in other Euro¬
pean countries. The number of visitors has
gone down while income has increased con¬
siderably. With free entry on Sundays this
still leaves the sites accessible to all, but cuts
down on wear and tear.
A.M.«
two finely modelled stone heads give some
indication of what else might have been
there. A charming piece of pottery, part
of a bowl incised all round with two lines
of birds in flight, is difficult to associate
with the term Stone Age.
Two more temple complexes, Hagar
Qim and Mnajdra, which stand within
sight of each other above the southern
cliffs of the main island ofMalta, received
only slightly better treatment. But it was
here, at Hagar Qim, that were found the
statues which have become a symbol of
the temple culture. They are known as "fat
ladies", though whether they really are
ladies is still in dispute. They have massive
hips, thighs and upper arms, and neat
little hands and feet, and they sit in lady¬
like positions, but very few of them have
female breasts.
Fortunately, Tarxien, the last great
temple to be built, and the Hypogeum of
Hal Saflieni, an underground cemetery in
use during almost the entire temple
period, remained undisturbed until Malta
had produced an archaeologist worthy of
them. Both of them were discovered at
the start of this century by builders digging
foundations. Both of them now stand in
the middle ofhousing developments, but
at least most of their treasures were pre¬
served.
If there had ever been any doubt about
the importance of the fat ladies in temple
culture this was dispelled by the discovery
of their giant sister at Tarxien. Local
farmers, tired of catching her in their
ploughs, had done their best to break her
up, but her elegant feet, massive calves
and outsized pleated skirt survived the
onslaught. When complete she would have
stood nearly three metres high. Placed on
a richly carved plinth, and given the prime
position, she was, breasts or no breasts,
undoubtedly the deity the Earth Mother,
Life, the Goddess of Fertility, or whatever
it was they called her.
It had long been thought that animal
sacrifice had played a part in temple rituals
and Tarxien appears to have confirmed
this too. When the excavators removed a
small flap, cut by the temple carvers into a
richly decorated altar front, they found in
the cavity behind it a long flint knife and a
bundle of animal bones.
Tarxien displays the apex of the temple-
carvers' art. As well as elaborately
branched and running spirals and the stip¬
pling of incised dots on the stone, there are
fine reliefs of bulls and horned sheep or
goats and a sow followed by her piglets. A
pair of particularly dense spirals stares
sternly from a step leading up into what
was probably the most sacred of the inner
sanctums, like a pair of eyes keeping a
watch for trespassers. The temple builders
carved all this, as they did everything else
from megaliths to underground caverns,
with nothing to aid them but stone tools.
Legs and skirt are all that remain of this
statue of an Earth Mother in the ruins of
the temple of Tarxien (c. 2800 B.C.) on the
island of Gozo.
The Hypogeum, a man-made series of
caves that reaches through several levels
deep into the earth, is considered to be
even more remarkable than the temples on
the surface. An estimated 7,000 bodies
were buried here, along with their grave
goods of pottery, shells and polished
stones, but the most astounding thing
about it is the large circular chamber, cut
from the living rock to imitate the inte¬
rior of the temples above ground. Many of
the temples contained small models of
themselves, but here, sheltered from the
elements, is a full-size replica unwithered
by time.
Peacefulfarmers
What kind ofpeople could they have been
who created all these riches? Where did
they come from and what happened to
them? Some of the answers are now
emerging from another subterranean
burial site, the Brochtorff Circle, near
Ggantija on Gozo. An Anglo-Maltese team
of archaeologists, meticulously probing
and recording, has been working there for
the past six years and from long buried
grain and pollen, bones and artifacts, they
are beginning to piece the story together.
It seems that around 5000 B.C. the
islands' first inhabitants made their way
across the sea from Malta's nearest neigh¬
bour, Sicily, ninety kilometres to the north.
They were farmers, growing barley and
wheat and bringing with them cattle,
goats, sheep and pigs. They appear to have
been a remarkably peaceful people, fearing 4J

48
no threat from each other or from the out¬
side world. They lived in caves and mud-
brick houses without a trace ofany kind of
fortification. The only things found from
this period even resembling a weapon are
two tiny arrowheads.
They also appear to have been unusu¬
ally healthy with strong bones and teeth.
Rather touchingly a few of them had
bunions and one small child was buried
with a puppy. It could be that only the
privileged few were buried here, but sev¬
eral skeletons seem to indicate otherwise.
These were men with particularly thick,
strong limbs and distinctively craggy faces.
The same team (Doctors Anthony Bon-
nanno and Tancred Gouda of Malta, and
Caroline Malone, Simon Stoddart and
David Trump from England) has recently
tentatively put forward a theory which
might explain the whole temple phenom¬
enon.
For a thousand years or more the new
settlers seem to have maintained links
with the outside world. They had tools of
flint and obsidian, which could never have
been obtained on Malta itself, and the tiny
greenstone axes that were common
exchange goods of the time. Their pottery
remained similar to that on Sicily and the
mainland of southern Italy. Then a dis¬
tinctive local culture began to emerge. The
pottery changed completely, unique bone
pendants were made, of a shape found
nowhere else, and local chert began to be
used instead of the superior imported flint
and obsidian. It was at this stage that the
first temples were built. As the temple cul¬
ture flourished, the temples themselves
appear to have become the guardians of
what remained of these now rare,
imported goods.
The thinking is that, as the islands
became increasingly isolated, the rivalry
and prestige involved in foreign trade was
transferred to the building of great mon¬
uments. As the population grew, every set¬
tlement not only had to have one of its
own, but one bigger and better than all
the rest.
Until recently it was assumed that the
temple builders, after their last fine flourish
at Tarxien, had been replaced by a very
different race, who brought with them
tools and weapons of copper and bronze.
But there is now some evidence to show
that the two cultures may have overlapped
and that not all the temple builders were
driven off the islands. It would be pleasant
to think that Malta's modem building skills
were a talent inherited from such remark¬
able ancestors.

BOOKS OF THE WORLD
by Calum Wise
Quizás tu nombre
salve/Et si ten nom
sauvait*
A bilingual anthology of
Salvadorian poetry. Poems
selected and translated by
Maria Poumier. 452 pp.
Editorial Universitaria de El
Salvador/UNESCO. (Bilingual,
Spanish/French).
This anthology of Salvadorian
poetry is mainly devoted to the
twentieth century and more than
half of the contributors are still
alive. Although the country's verse
is relatively little-known, it "has
contributed to Central American
literature through outstanding per¬
sonalities", as the essayist and poet
Roberto Armijo, himself a contrib¬
utor, points out in a foreword.
These personalities include Don
Francisco Gavidia, a major figure of
the Modernist era, luan Cotto, a
forerunner of the avant-garde, and
two lyric poets of great intensity,
Claudia Lars and Roque Dalton
all of whom are featured in the
anthology. The major themes here
are the exploration of the Salvado¬
rian soul; the search for a personal
voice; identification with the
"absent homeland"; myth and
reality; and reaction against major
trends in Western poetry such as
symbolism and surrealism. The
anthology culminates in the work
of the so-called Generación Com¬
prometida, the "Committed Gen¬
eration". There is a dynamic
ambivalence in these poets' use of
words, which combines an aware¬
ness of their beauty with a mistrust
of aestheticism, as there is in the
contrast between the lyricism of
their language and the primitive
harshness of their imagery. The
principal preoccupations are polit¬
ical commitment and the com¬
promises life imposes. The title
means "Perhaps your name may
save", the name in question being
that of El Salvador itself, which has
the power of a magical incantation
and evokes a universal land, at one
and the same time global and local,
that ultimately exists only in the
human heart.
L'Epopée de Samba
Gueladiégui
Recounted by Panel
Mamadou Baila and
translated into French by
Amadou Ly. 200 pp. Editions
Nouvelles du Sud, IFAN and
Unesco (in French).
This daarol (epic) in the Peul lan¬
guage is one of west Africa's most
famous oral narratives, and four
versions of it have already been
published. Historical rather than
mythological in form, in the
manner of the chanson de geste, it
tells the story of the rift between
its Tukulor hero and his uncle
Konko, who refuses to give him his
share of an inheritance. From the
tale emerges a portrait of the life
and customs of the Denianke Peul
before the eighteenth-century rev¬
olution duringwhich the Muslims
imposed their rule and their faith.
Daarol, or haala (historical epics),
are eclectic works in which ver¬
sions ofan original tale told by past
storytellers traces of whose
wording are retained are incor¬
porated into the interpretation (a
more accurate word would be per¬
formance) given to it by a contem¬
porary gawlo, or griot, in this case
Pahel Mamadou Baila. In this epic
the gawlo Sewi is at Samba's side
throughout his quest. His presence

is important as an illustration of
the griot's role in African social his¬
tory and is particularly striking in
view of Pahel's claims to descent
from Sewi further proof, if any
were needed, of the profound sym¬
biosis between story and story¬
teller. The Epopée de Samba
Guéladiégui is a seminal work in
its genre.
Old Czech Legends.
Alois Jirásek.
Translated with an
Introduction and Glossary
by Marie K. Holecek.
199 pp.
Forest Books/UNESCO.
(In English).
This collection ofold Czech leg¬
ends was originally intended for
children, but parents may enjoy it
even more, now that so many
people are concerned about
preservation of the cultural her¬
itage in all its forms. Alois lirásek, a
student and teacher of history,
wrote popular historical novels
similar in spirit to those of Sir
Walter Scott, who inspired the
Romantic movement in Western
literature at the start of the nine¬
teenth century. Readers familiar
with European folklore, especially
that of central and eastern Europe,
will find in these stories motifs and
themes that also appear in Russian
tales. The legends are here retold by
Jirásek in the rather formal style,
imbued with romantic and nation¬
alist ardour, typical of the "national
awakening" that fired central and
eastern European cultures and
peoples in the nineteenth century.
The book is divided into five parts:
"Old Czech Legends"; "Legends of
Christian Times"; "Tales of Old
Praha"; "Some Myths of the Middle
Ages"; and "Ancient Prophecies".
Each represents a different facet of
Bohemian society or history. The
tales are a seamless blend of
romanticized historical facts and
romantic or baroque fantasy,
whose period charm encourages
rather than hinders the reader from
interpreting them on several levels.
For example, two symbolic figures
of the post-nuclear world, Faust
and the Golem, feature in them.
Ghosts, witches, mythical animals
and magical objects intervene in
the struggles of men against their
fate. With the apparently naive
symbolism of folk wisdom, the sto¬
ries echo what many modern
thinkers say in tortuous and com¬
plex ways: that the world of
tomorrow will be multicultural.
Note: These three books form part
of the UNESCO Collection of
Representative Works.

RECENT RECORDINGS

JAZZ
Eastern Rebellion.
Simple Pleasure
Cedar Walton (piano), Ralph
Moore (saxophones), David
Williams (bass), Billy Higgins
(drums)
CD Limelight 518 014-2
These four musicians, all
thoroughly in tune with one
another, offer pleasures that are
rather less simple than the title of
the disc suggests. Walton, Moore,
Williams and Higgins play with
disconcerting ease, giving the
impression that they still enjoy
each other's musical company
even after many years together;
but they are nonetheless brilliant
craftsmen and past masters of
their art. The four men were born
to swing. The fresh and inventive
treatment they give to standards
such as "All the Things You Are"
and "My Ideal" demonstrates
their compositional talents as well
as the new numbers do. As for
Higgins, there is no drummer who
more obviously enjoys himself
when he's playing or who enters
more fully into the music with his
whole body. He has complete
mastery over his drums, and his
solos are constructed with great
rigour.
Sixun. Nomad's Land
Michel Alibo (bass guitar),
Jean-Pierre Como (keyboards),
Alain Debiossat (saxophones),
Arnaud Frank (percussion),
Paco Sery (drums, percussion),
Louis Winsberg (guitar)
CD Emarcy 514 474-2
This disc represents a
successful fusion of funk, jazz and
African music. Sixun, which
brings together African and
French musicians, is presently
one of France's most popular
groups, and it produces a lively,
happy music that makes no great
claims for itself but effortlessly
suggests the warmth of the
tropical countries from which it
takes its inspiration.
TRADITIONAL MUSIC
Japan. O-Suwa-Daiko Drums
Musics and Musicians of the
World
CD Unesco D8030
These drums evoke the old
Japan of Shinto divinities and
warrior heroes. The ensemble is
directed by Oguchi Daihachi, a
musician born in Okatani in the
prefecture of Nagano to a family
that for generations had devoted
itself to the preservation of the O-
Suwa-Daiko. Some of the pieces
performed here were passed
down by priests; others like the
Suwa-Ikazuchi served to invoke
the gods to bring rain or victory in
battle. This thunderous music,
preserved from the distant past,
evokes the atmosphere of some of
the great samurai films.
The Complete Blind Willie
Johnson
Roots 'n' Blues collection
2 CD set. Columbia 472 1 90 2
The first blues singers to win
an international reputation
through their recordings were
women like Bessie or Mamie
Smith; but the pioneers of the
style were men, singing to
themselves on the road or in the
fields to lighten their cares, or else
with a few friends for
amusement's sake. Blind Willie
Johnson, who roamed the
southern states, is one of the
major figures of the early blues
and of spirituals too, for the
frontier between the two musics
was not clearly defined at the
time; though the themes might
differ, the interpretation and the
vocal leaps, inherited from field
hollers and work songs, were for
the most part similar. This
authoritative set is, to the best of
my knowledge, the first collection
of recordings by a singer whose
serious tone and controlled
passion can still move listeners
today.
CLASSICAL MUSIC
SAINT-SAENS. Symphony No.
3. MESSIAEN. L'Ascension
Orchestre de l'Opéra Bastille,
conducted by Myung-Whun
Chung
CD Deutsche Grammophon
435 854-2
Two superb symphonic works
in which the organ plays a major
part are conducted with
intelligence and finesse on this
CD by Myung-Whun Chung.
Saint-Saëns was a talented
organist who played in several
Paris churches and had a
particular affection for the
instrument. His Third Symphony,
dedicated to Liszt who strongly
influenced him, unfurls its
movements with lush sensuality.
Messiaen, also an organist, strove
to communicate his religious faith
through his music. The
instrument gives a mystic
coloration to his orchestration
that distinguishes it from the
customary tonal palette. Although
he was only 25 when he wrote
L'Ascension, the work already
prefigures his later
experimentation with
microtonality.

These beautiful

been orchestrated with brio by
Stelio Vlavianos, a young
composer who has studied in
Athens and Paris and whose
music contains dazzling
highlights and undercurrents of
surprising intensity. The pure,
vibrant tones of the soprano Vivi
Kitsou blend perfectly with the
orchestra to evoke a certain
Mediterranean pastthat of the
sirens seeking to enchant Ulysses.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR NESCO
OUR1ER
A FLYING BICYCLE
I enjoyed reading Edmond Petit's article "The
Sky Horizon" in your July-August 1992 issue
and would like to draw to your readers' atten¬
tion the unjustly forgotten feat of Gabriel
Poulain (1884-1953), who in 1921 made the
first successful muscle-powered flight at the
Longchamp race track in Paris, France.
Poulain, a champion indoor racing cyclist,
managed to lift a bicycle equipped with two
aerofoils off the ground and fly a distance of
over ten metres.

ETHNIC GROUPS AND RESERVES
In the editorial of your June 1993 issue on
minorities, I was struck by Federico Mayor's
question, "Is it conceivable that the map of
the world could ever be redrawn to conform
with ethnic criteria?"
Western statesmen arrogantly ignored
ethnic criteria when they drew the maps of
blackAfrica and, indirectly, ofcentral Europe.
We see how successful that has been. The
same thing happened in the Middle East	
It is also a pity that your issue only
touched on the problem of indigenous
minorities. Perhaps this was deliberate. How
strange that the Western democracies, so
enthusiastic about human rights, should
accept the North American idea of "Indian
reserves".

THE BEAST THAT WILL NOT DIE
In view of the rising tide of racism, xeno¬
phobia and movements with fascist lean¬
ings, I think that you should produce, as a
matter ofurgency and a task in keeping with
your objectives, an in-depth analysis of this
problem (examining its historical, economic
and psychological background as well as the
political interests that ensure that this beast
does not die) . Such an issue should attempt
to explain why and how such ideologies
influence people who have nothing prac¬
tical to gain from them.

PRISONERS' AID
I have been a Courier subscriber for several
years. I find the magazine interesting and
instructive and use it for the courses I teach
in prison schools. Why not devote an issue to
the world's prisons and to ways of rehabili¬
tating former prisoners?

EDUCATION FOR ALL
I am an Argentine teacher working in the
city ofFormosa, capital of the province of the
same name, 1,250 kilometres from Buenos
Aires. The working conditions for educators
in this area are very hard, and the social sit¬
uation is marked by uncertainty, fear and
economic instability. We lack the most basic
materials chalk, blackboards, classrooms,
etc.but that does not prevent us from car¬
rying on the fight against illiteracy.
After reading an issue of the Courier, I
realized that there are people in other coun¬
tries and on other continents who, despite
cultural, social and linguistic differences,
share the same educational interests and
objectives. I thought that by pooling our
scattered efforts we might succeed in turning
"education for all" one of Unesco's priori¬
ties into reality.
I am trying to make the children in my
little school realize that the unique, fragile
home we call Earth must be preserved and
protected.
Thankyou for publishing so many inter¬
esting articles. I have found an invaluable
friend in the Unesco Courier.
