THE UNITED KINGDOM REJOINS UNESCO
The Union Jack was hoisted outside UNESCO's Paris Headquarters on July 1 after
a 12-year absence, at a ceremony held to mark the United Kingdom's return to the
Organization it had helped to create half a century ago.
Britain's application to rejoin UNESCO had been formally unveiled in the Queen's
traditional speech at the May 14 opening of Parliament.
"It's good to be back," said Ms Clare Short, Britain's Secretary of State for Inter¬
national Development (at left of photo), after raising the flag with Mr. Federico
Mayor, UNESCO's Director-General (right). She pointed out that the speed with
which the new British Government had moved to rejoin UNESCO underlined the
strength of its commitment to the Organization and to the United Nations system.
"Today marks a new beginning in our relations with UNESCO," she went on.
"The United Kingdom has experience in education, science, culture and commu¬
nication which should be shared with UNESCO. But I must emphasize that my pri¬
ority in working with the organization will be focused on the eradication of poverty
and the education of the excluded. "
Saluting the United Kingdom's return as a "homecoming", Mr. Mayor described
the UK as "a nation summoned by its culture and traditions to contribute to UNESCO's
constitutional purpose of advancing the objectives of peace and of the common
welfare of humanity."

month by month a text bAndré Malraux
While we were preparing this issue we often found ourselves
thinking of the words uttered by André Malraux on 8 March
I960, at a ceremony held at Unesco Headquarters in Paris to
mark the launching of the first International Campaign for
the Preservation of the Monuments of Nubia.
Malraux's address on that occasion said admirably all
that needed to be said about the emergence of humanity's
new sense of responsibility for the invisible masterpieces of
its heritage. It would have been impossible not to refer to
this text in our introduction to the present issue. On
rereading it we decided it would be best to let Malraux speak
for himself.

"... 'Beauty' has become one of our age's most potent mys¬
teries, the inexplicable quality which brings the Egyptian
masterpieces into communion with the statues of our own
cathedrals, or the Aztec temples, or the Indian or Chinese
grottoes; with the paintings of Cézanne and Van Gogh, with
the greatest dead and the greatest living artists; with, in short,
the whole treasury of the first world civilization.
"This is an immense regeneration, of which our own
Renaissance will soon seem a diffident prefiguring. For the first ,
time, men have discovered a universal language of art. We
feel its influence acutely, even if we only partly understand its
nature. This tremendous storehouse of art, of which we are
now becoming conscious, draws its force no doubt from its

being the most signal victory of human effort over death. To
the impregnable 'nevermo re' that governs the history of civ¬
ilizations, this art opposes its own mysterious grandeur.
"Of the force that brought Egypt into being out of pre¬
historic night, nothing now remains; but the impulse which
engendered these giants which are threatened today still
speaks to us as clearly as the genius of the master-craftsmen
of Chartres, or the genius of Rembrandt. The emotion we
share with the creators of these granite statues is not even one
of love, nor a common feeling for death nor even, per¬
haps, a similar way of looking at their work; yet before their
work, the accents of anonymous sculptors forgotten during
two thousand years seem to us as much untouched by the
succession of empires as the accents of mother love.
"This is what brings throngs of Europeans to exhibitions
of Mexican art; of Japanese to exhibitions of French art; and
millions of Americans to see Van Gogh. This is why the com¬
memorative ceremonies of Rembrandt's death were inau¬
gurated by the last kings of Europe, and the exhibition of our

own stained glass by the brother of the last Asian emperor. This
is why, Mr. Director-General"", so many sovereign names are
associated with the appeal you are launching today.
"One could not too highly praise your having conceived
a plan so magnificent and so precise in its boldness one
might say, a kind of Tennessee Valley Authority of archae¬
ology. It is the antithesis of the kind of gigantic exhibitionism
by which great modern states try to outbid each other. Nor
should the well-defined object of your scheme conceal its
profound significance. If UNESCO is trying to rescue the
monuments of Nubia, it is because these are in imminent
danger; it goes without saying that it would try to save other
great ruins Angkor or Nara, for instance if they were
similarly threatened.
"On behalf of man's artistic heritage, you are appealing to
the world's conscience as others have been doing, this week,
for the victims of the Agadir earthquake. 'May we never
have to choose,' you said just now, 'between porphyry stat¬
ues and living men!' Yours is the first attempt to deploy, in
a rescue operation, on behalf of statues, the immense
resources usually harnessed for the service of men. And
this is perhaps because for us the survival of statues has
become an expression of life.
"At the moment when our civilization divines a mysteri¬
ous transcendence in art and one of the still obscure sources of
its unity, at the moment when we are bringing into a single,
family relationship the masterpieces of so many civilizations
which knew nothing of or even hated each other, you are
proposing an action which brings all men together to defy the
forces of dissolution. Your appeal is historic, not because it
proposes to save the temples of Nubia, but because through
it the first world civilization publicly proclaims the world's art
as its indivisible heritage. In days when the West believed its cul¬
tural heritage had its source in Athens, it could nonetheless
look on with equanimity while the Acropolis crumbled away.
"The slow flood of the Nile has reflected the melancholy
caravans of the Bible, the armies of Cambyses and Alexan¬
der, the knights of Byzantium and Islam, the soldiers of
Napoleon. No doubt when the sandstorm blows across it,
its ancient memory no longer distinguishes the brilliant notes
of Rameses' triumph from the pathetic dust that settles again
in the wake of defeated armies. And when the sand is scat¬
tered again, the Nile is once more alone with its sculpted
mountains, its colossal effigies whose motionless reflection
has for so long been part of its echo of eternity.
"But see, old river, whose floods allowed astrologers to
fix the most ancient date in history, men are coming now,
from all parts of the world, who will carry these giants far
away from your life-giving, destructive waters. Let the night
fall, and you will reflect again the stars under which Isis
accomplished her funeral rites, the star of Rameses. But the
humblest worker come to rescue the statues of Isis and
Rameses will tell you something you have always known
but never heard from men before: that there is only one
action over which indifferent stars and unchanging, mur¬
murous rivers have no sway: it is the action of a man who
snatches something from death."

THE UNESCO lOURIERB SEPTEMBER 1997

> what is the world
An international
treaty
I The United Nations
I Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
seeks to encourage the
identification, protection and
preservation of cultural and
natural heritage around the world
considered to be of outstanding
value to humanity.
The idea of creating an
international movement for
protecting sites in other countries
emerged after World War I, but
the landmark event in arousing
international concern was the
decision to build the Aswan High
Dam in Egypt, which would have
flooded the valley containing the
Abu Simbel temples, a treasure of
ancient Egyptian civilization. In
1959, after an appeal from the
governments of Egypt and Sudan,
UNESCO decided to launch an
international campaign, and the
Abu Simbel and Philae temples
were dismantled, moved to dry
ground and reassembled.
The campaign cost about $80
million, half of which was
donated by some fifty countries,
showing the importance of
nations' shared responsibility in
conserving outstanding cultural
sites. Its success led to other
safeguarding campaigns, e.g. for
Venice in Italy, Moenjodaro in
Pakistan and Borobudur in
Indonesia.
Consequently, UNESCO
initiated, with the help of the
International Council on
Monuments and Sites
(ICOMOS), the preparation of a
draft convention on the
protection of cultural heritage.
The idea of combining the
conservation of cultural and
natural sites comes from the
United States. A White House
Conference in Washington, D.C.,
in 1965 called for a "World
Heritage Trust" that would
stimulate international co¬
operation to protect "the world's
superb natural and scenic areas and
historic sites for the present and
the future of the entire world
citizenry". In 1968 the
International Union for
conservation of Nature (IUCN)
developed similar proposals for
its members. These proposals were
presented to the United Nations
Conference on Human
Environment held in Stockholm
(Sweden) in 1972.
Eventually, a single text was
agreed upon by all parties
concerned. The Convention
concerning the Protection of the
World Cultural and Natural
Heritage was adopted by the
General Conference of UNESCO
on 16 November 1972.
Objectives
I The term cultural heritage
I refers to monuments,
groups of buildings and sites with
historical, aesthetic,
archaeological, scientific,
ethnological or anthropological
value. Natural heritage refers to
outstanding physical, biological
and geological formations,
habitats of threatened species of
animals and plants and areas with
scientific, conservation or
aesthetic value.
UNESCO's World Heritage
mission is to:
> encourage countries to sign the
1972 Convention and to ensure
the protection of their natural and
cultural heritage;
> encourage States Parties to the
Convention to nominate sites
within their national territory for
inclusion on the World Heritage
List;
> encourage States Parties to set
up reporting systems on the state
of conservation of World Heritage
sites;
> help States Parties safeguard
World Heritage sites by providing
technical assistance and
professional training;
> provide emergency assistance
for World Heritage sites in
immediate danger;
> promote the presentation of
cultural and natural heritage;
> encourage international co¬
operation in conservation of
cultural and natural heritage.
A gift from the past to
the future
By signing the World
Heritage Convention,
countries recognize that the sites
located on their national territory
which have been inscribed on the
World Heritage List, without
prejudice to national sovereignty
or ownership, constitute a world
heritage "for whose protection it
is the duty of the international
community as a whole to co¬
operate".
Without the support of other
countries, some sites with
recognized cultural or natural
value would deteriorate or, worse,
disappear, often through lack of
funding to preserve them. The
Convention is thus an agreement,
signed to date by 149 countries,
to contribute the necessary
financial and intellectual resources
to protect World Heritage sites.
Sites selected for World
Heritage listing are approved on

heritage*.i
the basis of their merits as the best
possible examples of the cultural
and natural heritage. The World
Heritage List draws attention to
the wealth and diversity of the
earth's cultural and natural heritage.
The Convention
The most significant
' feature of the World
Heritage Convention is to link
together in a single document the
concepts of nature conservation
and the preservation of cultural
sites. It defines the kind of natural
or cultural sites which can be
considered for inscription on the
World Heritage List, and sets out
the duties of States Parties in
identifying potential sites and
their role in protecting and
preserving them.
A World Heritage site differs
from a site of national heritage by
virtue of its "outstanding universal
value". By signing the Convention,
each country pledges to conserve
not only the World Heritage sites
situated on its territory, but also to
protect its national heritage
whether or not it is placed on the
World Heritage List.
The Convention describes the
function of the World Heritage
Committee, how its members are
elected and their terms of office;
specifies the professional advisory
bodies to which it can turn for
advice in selecting the sites to be
listed; and explains how the
World Heritage Fund is to be used
and managed and under what
conditions international financial
assistance may be provided.
I HOW THE CONVENTION
WORKS
The application for a site to be
inscribed on the World Heritage
List must come from the country
itself. Unesco makes no
recommendations for listing. The
application has to include a plan
detailing how the site is managed
and protected.
The World Heritage
Committee examines
nominations on the basis of
technical evaluations, provided by
two advisory bodies, the
International Council on
Monuments and Sites
(ICOMOS) and the World
Conservation Union (IUCN). A
third advisory body, the
International Centre for the
Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property
(ICCROM), provides expert
advice on restoring monuments
and organizes training courses.
I SELECTION CRITERIA
To be included on the World
Heritage List, sites must satisfy
the selection criteria which are
explained in a booklet entitled
Operational Guidelines which,
besides the text of the
Convention, is the main working
document on World Heritage. The
criteria have been revised regularly
by the Committee to match the



evolution of the World Heritage
concept itself.
Cultural properties should:
(i) represent a masterpiece of
human creative genius, or
(ii) exhibit an important
interchange of human values over
a span of time or within a cultural
area of the world, or
developments in architecture or
technology, monumental arts,
town planning or landscape
design, or
(iii) bear a unique or at least
exceptional testimony to a
cultural tradition or to a
civilization which is living or has
disappeared, or
(iv) be an outstanding example of
a type of building or architectural
or technological ensemble, or
landscape which illustrates a
significant stage or significant
stages in human history, or
(v) be an outstanding example of a
traditional human settlement or
land-use which is representative of
a culture or cultures, especially
when it has become vulnerable
under the impact of irreversible
change, or
(vi) be directly or tangibly
associated with events or living
traditions, with ideas or with
beliefs, or with artistic and
literary works of outstanding
universal significance (a criterion
used only in exceptional
circumstances, and together with
other criteria).
Equally important is the
authenticity of the site and the
way it is protected and managed.
Natural propertiesshould:
(i) be outstanding examples
representing major stages of the
earth's history, including the
record of life, significant ongoing
geological processes in the
development of landforms, or
significant geomorphic or
physiographic features, or
(ii) be outstanding examples
representing significant ongoing
ecological and biological processes
in the evolution and development
of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal
and marine ecosystems and
communities of plants and
animals, or
(iii) contain superlative natural
phenomena or areas of exceptional
natural beauty and aesthetic
importance, or
(iv) contain the most important
and significant natural habitats for
in situ conservation of biological
diversity, including those
containing threatened species of
outstanding universal value from
the point of view of science or
conservation.
The protection, management
and integrity of the site are also
important considerations.
Mixed sites have both
outstanding natural and cultural
values. Since 1 992 significant
interactions between people and
the natural environment have been
recognized as cultural landscapes.

I PROTECTION AND
MONITORING
World Heritage conservation is an
ongoing process. Listing a site
does little good if it subsequently
falls into a state of disrepair or if a
development project risks
destroying the qualities that made
the site suitable for World
Heritage status in the first place.
The credibility of World Heritage
stems from countries' regular
reporting on the condition of
sites, on measures taken to
preserve them, and on their
efforts to raise public awareness of
Cultural and natural heritage. If a
country is not fulfilling its
obligations under the
Convention, it risks having its
sites deleted from the World
Heritage List.
The World Heritage
Committee will be alerted by
individuals, non-governmental
organizations, or other groups
to possible dangers to a site. If the
alert is justified, and the problem
serious enough, the site will be
placed on the List of World
Heritage in Danger. This list is
designed to call the world's
attention to natural or human-
made conditions which threaten
the characteristics for which the
site was originally inscribed on
the World Heritage List.
Endangered sites on this list are
entitled to particular attention
and emergency action.
In urgent cases, such as
outbreak of war, the Committee
will make the listing itself without
having received a formal request.
Funding and support
F The World Heritage
Fund, created in 1972 by
the Convention, receives its
income essentially from
compulsory contributions from
States Parties amounting to 1 per
cent of their UNESCO duesand
voluntary contributions. Other
sources of income include funds-
in-trust donated by countries for
specific purposes and profits
derived from sales of World
Heritage products.
The total amount received each
year is just under $3 million, a
modest sum considering the
magnitude of the task. The onus is



very much on the World Heritage
Committee to allocate funding
according to the urgency of the
request, which is why priority is
necessarily given to the most
threatened sites, including those
listed as World Heritage in Danger.
The World Heritage Fund
assists the States Parties in
identifying and preserving World
Heritage sites. The work of
preparation, conservation and
preservation is expensive and not
all requests for international
assistance can be met from the
World Heritage Fund. The World
Heritage Committee applies
stringent conditions, and requests
have to fall into clearly defined
categories: preparatory assistance,
technical co-operation, emergency
assistance, and training.

organs of the Convention, the advisory bodies and the WHC Secretariat, and the
basic texts of the Committee (rules of procedure, financial regulations) as well as
models of ratification and nomination forms.

A portion of the World
Heritage Fund is allocated to
States Parties on their request to
help them prepare periodic
reports on the condition of listed
sites. These reports, prepared on a
voluntary basis, are a crucial part
of World Heritage conservation.
They enable the Committee to
assess the conditions of the sites
and facilitate its decision-making.
The reports also make possible the
development of specific training
and other programmes aimed at
resolving recurrent problems in
site conservation.
Another essential task is
building awareness about the
World Heritage Convention and
its aims. This takes two forms:
promoting the World Heritage
concept, with information for the
general public or specific interest
groups, and developing teaching
programmes and educational
materials for use in schools and
universities. The two are
complementary, since materials
produced for promotion can also
be used for education.
Who does what?
The General Assembly
includes all States Parties to the
Convention. It meets once every
two years during the ordinary
session of UNESCO's General
Conference to elect the World
Heritage Committee, to examine
the statement of accounts of the
World Heritage Fund and decide
on major policy issues.
The World Heritage Committee
is responsible for the
implementation of the World
Heritage Convention and has the
final say on whether a site is
accepted for inscription on the
World Heritage List. It also
examines reports on the state of
conservation of listed sites, and
asks States Parties to take action
when sites are not being properly
managed. The Committee is also
responsible for allocating finance



from the World Heritage Fund
for sites in need of repair or
restoration, for emergency action
if sites are in immediate danger,
for providing technical assistance
and training, and for promotional
and educational activities. The
Committee, which meets in
December each year, consists of
representatives from 21 of the
States Parties to the Convention.
Members are elected during the
UNESCO General Conference for
six-year terms of office. Seven
members of the Committee make
up the World Heritage Bureau, a
smaller executive body that
prepares the work of the
Committee.
The Unesco World Heritage Centre
was set up in 1992 to assure the
day-to-day management of the
Convention. It organizes the
annual sessions of the Bureau and
Committee, provides advice to
States Parties in the preparation of
site nominations, organizes
technical assistance upon request,
and co-ordinates both reporting
on the condition of sites and the
emergency action undertaken
when a site is threatened. It is also
responsible for the
administration of the World
Heritage Fund. Other tasks of the
Centre include arranging technical
seminars and workshops,
updating the World Heritage List
and database, developing teaching
materials to raise awareness of the
World Heritage concept, and
keeping the public informed of
World Heritage issues. It co¬
operates with other groups
working on issues related to
conservation both within
UNESCOnotably the Cultural
Heritage Division in the Sector
for Culture, and the Division of
Ecological Sciences in the Science
Sector and on the outside,
notably the three Advisory
Bodies (ICOMOS,IUCN,
ICCROM), and other
international organizations such
as the Organization of World
Heritage Cities (OWHC) and the
International Council of
Museums (ICOM).


The World Heritage
Convention,
25 years on
by Bernd von Droste
On 16 November 1997 we celebrate the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the adoption by UNESCO's General Con¬
ference of the Convention concerning the Protection of the
World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Today the Conven¬
tion has been ratified by 149 States Parties, which makes it
the most universal international legal instrument in the field
of heritage conservation. The anniversary is an opportu¬
nity to reflect on, and critically review, its implementation.
The Convention is uniquely founded on the premise that
certain natural and cultural sites are of "outstanding uni¬
versal value" and form part of the common heritage of
humankind. The conservation of this common heritage is
of concern not just for individual nations, but for all human¬
ity. Another unique feature of the Convention is the fact that
it seeks to protect both cultural and natural heritage. In view
of the many linkages between people and their environment,
this holistic approach is both logical and revolutionary.
The Convention is also remarkable in that it has helped
to establish systematic international co-operation in the realm
of conservation. Every year the 21-member intergovern¬
mental World Heritage Committee approves funding for
emergency conservation assistance to World Heritage sites
under threat, to support co-operative conservation activities
at World Heritage sites around the world, for conservation
training, and for preparatory work on nominations of cultural
and natural sites for inclusion on the World Heritage List.
So far, 506 sites of outstanding universal value have been
included on the List. Of these sites, 380 are cultural, 107 are
natural, and 19 are mixed cultural and natural sites. They are
located in 107 States Parties. Despite efforts to ensure a more
balanced and representative World Heritage List, it is still
heavily weighted towards the monumental and religious
architecture of Western Europe. In future years more sites
from the Arab States, from the Pacific and from Africa
should be added to the List.
Part of this heritage is now threatened and consider¬
able ingenuity and resourcefulness are required to ensure its
continued survival. The challenges are ever increasing. The
World Heritage Committee has included on the List of
World Heritage in Danger 22 sites under extreme threat
and in need of special conservation actions. There is also
growing concern about the state of conservation of four
sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the
archaeological site of Butrinti in Albania.
Military and civil conflicts, the growth of mass tourism
and uncontrolled and ill-advised development are among
the factors that make it difficult to protect the extraordi¬
nary natural and cultural sites that constitute our World
Heritage. In this the twenty-fifth year of the World Heritage
Convention let us recall the splendour of this common her¬
itage and participate, individually and collectively, in pro¬
tecting it for the centuries to come.

The creative diversity
ofpeople and cultures
is at the heart of the world
heritage idea
Wooden ceremonial mask

Coola Indians of British
Columbia.
Modern societies' strange knack of eras¬
ing their own traces makes the preser¬
vation of the world heritage a duty
owed to memory. At a time when
remembrance of things past is becoming an
industry, an instrument of power, the profu¬
sion of images and information flowing in from
all over the world makes our selection of them
ever more arbitrary. This, paradoxically, helps to
confuse our standards of judgment and weaken
appreciation of our cultural diversity.
And yet it would seem that societies have
never felt greater curiosity about each others'
ways of life and, especially in the wealthy
countries, about great monuments, places rich
in historical associations, the arts, and those
crafts, traditions and customs of distant peo¬
ples that are a heaven-sent boon for the tourist
industry.
In Western societies, it is true, the serious
exploration of other cultures, at first the pre¬
serve of certain categories such as ethnologists,
historians, archaeologists and a well-heeled
elite of travellers, has long been a fact of life.

THE UNESCO ^^pURIER SEPTEMBER 1097
More recently, we have witnessed the emer¬
gence of cultural tourism which relies for
its existence on one part of the world parad¬
ing its individuality for the delectation of the
other part.
I The birth ofa notion
This is nothing new for Europe. China, India
and Persia never quite disappeared from the
mental landscape of a cultured few, but it was
not until the beginning of the nineteenth cen¬
tury that Ancient Egypt burst upon the
European cultural consciousness, while the
Arab world only gained admittance thanks to
the British obsession with the passage to India
and to that concept invented by Romantic
writers and painters, "the Orient" (which,
incidentally, began at Greece). As for the
Amerindian heritage, it only gained recogni¬
tion in this century, when indigenous peo¬
ples began to lay claim to a political existence.
African and Oceanian cultures constitute a
paradox in the sense that the West has failed to *

put the art and culture of those regions in a
historical perspective, although they have had
for a century a strong hold on the Western
imagination.
It was not until the United Nations was set
up and many new countries achieved inde¬
pendence that UNESCO's work led to the emer¬
gence of the notion of a world cultural heritage
as a manifestation of the equal dignity of all
cultures and to acceptance of the idea that the
international community as a whole had a
duty to preserve that heritage.
The first thing that had to be done was to

erty developers that is eating away at the
world's major tourist sites.
I The non-material heritage
As deeper thought has been given to the
world's different cultures, it has come to be
realized that not all of them found material
expression in major works, and that a whole
area of humanity's cultural heritage is invisible
because it resides in the human mind. For this
reason, some cultures such as those of the
nomadic peoples of North America or the
steppes of Eurasia who for the most part pro¬
duced only small artifacts, long went
unrecorded. It should also be said that, pace
Malraux, the production of everyday articles,
clothing, domestic utensils and so on is not a
matter of reproduction, not involving the
kind of creativity that goes into the art pro¬
duced for the court or for religious celebra¬
tions, but embodies a universe of signs that do
not need to be ostentatious in order to carry
meaning.
Nor can the cultural heritage of any given
society be reduced to its material forms. This
question first arose in relation to societies
whose lore and skills, as well as the memory of
their ancestors, were concentrated in the oral
tradition. It thus came to be understood that
the patrimony of any culture is not only an
inheritance from the past but also preserves,
through changing circumstances, some of its
most lasting models and points of reference.
The concept of a non-material heritage thus
merges into that of culture as "the whole com¬
plex of spiritual, material, intellectual and emo¬
tional features that characterize a society or
social group" and which "includes not only
the arts and letters but also ways of life, the

THE UNESCO lOURIER SEPTEMBER 1997

fundamental rights of the human being, value
systems, traditions and beliefs".
The force ofchange
To this definition, which came out of the Mex¬
ico City World Conference on Cultural Poli¬
cies (1982), should be added that which, in
each culture, explains its dynamism, the force
of change within it, and the importance of
the influences it undergoes and the intercul¬
tural exchanges in which it participates, not
forgetting the changes that all cultures are expe¬
riencing today as a result of the worldwide
spread of a global model of development!.
Whereas daily life in "modern" societies is
supposed to be governed solely by the tastes
and wishes of individuals (it being considered
inappropriate for the authorities or the wider
community to interfere in such matters), pri¬
vate life in traditional societies is strongly
influenced by the community's rules. It may
be true that few purely traditional societies
still exist, but of those that do, many are still
far removed from the models of social and
cultural behaviour that the elites of the coun-

tries of the North regard as self-evident. Any
high-handed attempt to change these societies'
values could not only fail in its avowed aims
but, more seriously, could sap their energy
and take away their freedom to choose their
own paths to fulfilment.
It has to be acknowledged that human beings
are the most important monuments of the cul¬
tures to which they belong, and the relevant
conclusion should be drawn. The real common
heritage of humanity is its creative diversity.

n idea whose time has come
BY PIERRE NORA
How France
became aware
ofits heritage
Tn the last twenty years or so, the concept
_ of "heritage" has expanded or rather
A exploded to the point where it has
-become transformed'. Thus, while older
dictionaries define it primarily as that which is
passed on, e.g. from parents to children, a more
recent definition refers also to "the evidence of
the past . . . considered collectively as the inher¬
itance of present-day society"2.
In France, this idea grew up around that of
the " historic monument", itself a notion inher¬
ited from the French Revolution3. It acquired
official status in the early 1830s and was then
given a legal definition by a system of listing and
preservation that was voted into law in 1913.
Historic monuments, the Roman aqueduct
known as the Pont du Gard, for instance, or
Chartres cathedral, were seen as irrefutable evi¬
dence of an ever-present past, acknowledged as
such by the nation and therefore designated as
representative of the national identity.
This state-run, centralized system of "list¬
ing" monuments, which in fact amounted to
a takeover by the public authorities, survived
with various ups and downs until the mid-
1970s 4. Then the deluge began, with the emer¬
gence of an ethnological and rural heritage. A
significant event in this connection was the
opening, in 1967, of the Museum of Popular
Arts and Traditions in Paris. Since then, the
ground covered by the concept of the heritage
has constantly expanded in three major direc¬
tions: to include the contemporary, in response
to the interest in industrial archaeology and
the nineteenth century in general, an aware¬
ness of which was stimulated by the demoli¬
tion of Les Halles, the covered food markets
built by Victor Baltard in Paris in the middle

years of that century; to take in the daily life
of bygone times, the evidence of a world of
dances, songs, cookery and crafts that was
swept away forever by the winds of change in
the years between the late 1940s and the mid-
1970s (corresponding to what French econo¬
mist Jean Fourastié has called the "Thirty Glo¬
rious Years of Growth"); and to embrace the
non-artistic and non-historic the natural her¬
itage, the heritage of science and technology
and that of traditions and folklore.
M A silent transition
This snowballing of the concept has entailed
enormous psychological and financial invest¬
ment in the economy and in tourism. It has
been accompanied by a silent but decisive tran¬
sition from "national history" to "national
memory", i.e. from a historical to a social aware¬
ness of the nation. In concrete terms, this shift
reflects a kind of emancipation, or perhaps it
would be better to say an "internal decolo¬
nization", of such sub-groups within society
as manual workers, provincials (Corsicans or
Bretons, for example), women or Jews who,
because they are becoming more and more
fully integrated into the nation as a whole,
have a heightened awareness of their past and
regard every item of evidence of that past as an
indispensable pointer to their identity5.
This change is well illustrated by the recent
emergence and proliferation of what in France
are known as "museums of society" a pipe
museum and a clog museum, for instance
which aim to preserve the memory of a par¬
ticular industry or local product6. The her¬
itage is no longer simply the representation



of an idea held by society as a whole. It increas¬
ingly tends to be linked to the identity of a
given sector within society, asocial group that
demands to be recognized and registered as
"national" and that has ceased to perceive itself
in cultural terms alone.
This exponential growth in the area covered
by the concept of the heritage clearly reflects a
thoroughgoing democratization process and a
constant proliferation of the forms in which it
finds expression. Crucial as it is, this change lends
itself to a linear explanation as the logical cul¬
mination of one of those long-term movements
that art historians have taught us to decipher7.
This movement could be seen as a stage-
by-stage process, with first the establishment
of a religious heritage (the Church's relics and
treasures), followed by an aristocratic one
(stately homes, weapons, textiles) and next
the heritage of monarchs and scholars, itself
scholarly in character, with its libraries, its
manuscripts and its histories of religious
orders. Then came the decisive stage, from the
confiscation of Church property at the time of
the Revolution to the establishment, under
the July Monarchy^, of major institutions
concerned with the heritage. It was at this stage
that the concept of heritage really came into
being, i.e. that of property not in use for its
original purpose but acquiring a totally dif¬
ferent kind of use by virtue of its antiquity,
and it was also at this stage that the nation
would provide the frame of reference for the
"togetherness" of the community. This stage
was continued into, or rather brought to ful¬
filment in, its successor, when the idea of the
"national" still prevailed but was regulated
and given a civic, republican character. This in
turn led to, and achieved fruition in, interna¬
tional organizations such as the League of
Nations and UNESCO, which have done so

much to disseminate the global concept of
heritage. Thus we have come to the democra¬
tic, community-based, psychologically sig¬
nificant heritage as we know it today.
\An aura ofsanctity
May we then conclude that awareness of the
heritage has progressed uninterruptedly? In
point of fact, as we well know, quite different
factors are involved in the present runaway
expansion of the heritage. It is taking us over
a threshold and into a new set of circumstances.
We have moved on from a heritage simply
handed down to us to a symbolic heritage
linked with the notion of identity, from a
visible and material heritage to an invisible and
non-material heritage, and from a state-
controlled heritage to a social, ethnic and com¬
munity-based heritage. To borrow the lan¬
guage of relativity theory, we have moved fro m
a "special" heritage system to a "general" one,
in other words from the age of heritage as his¬
tory to that of heritage as memory9.
In this process, the nature and status of
the heritage have changed. The heritage now
belongs to the same constellation of ideas as
memory, identity and culture, and in demo¬
cratic societies has become the secular equiva¬
lent of sanctity.
All countries, whether democratic or not,
are feeling this increasingly powerful concern
for their cultural property, the only differ¬
ences being in rates of progress, in degrees of

urgency and in the vocabulary employed. The
example of France is valid because it makes the
evolution of the concept particularly easy to
follow for two major reasons.
The first of these reasons derives from the
close relationship established by the Enlight¬
enment between the ideas of the nation and of
civilization, the nation's existence being justi¬
fied by the fact that it is the vehicle of progress
and the instrument of civilization. At the water¬
shed of the French Revolution, the preservation
of the monuments of the ancien régime and of
the achievements of civilization were thus pro¬
moted with equal vigour. The French politi¬
cian and historian François Guizot may rightly
be seen as a key figure in this respect: in his His¬
tory ofCivilization in Europe, he saw the intel¬
lectual merit of the Restauration^ as residing in
"the reawakening of appreciation of France's '
ancient monuments".
The second of these reasons derives from
the long history of state power in France and
its centralizing, Jacobin tradition, which, via
a forceful national conservation policy, has
made the recent transition to cultural and com¬
munity-based conservation all the more strik¬
ing. A kind of "French model" may thus be
discerned within the overall evolution of the
heritage concept11. This is not so surprising,
since in the French language the very word for
"heritage" patrimoine contains within
itself, for better or worse, the word patrie
"homeland".

ultural landscapes
BY DAVID LOWENTHAL D
A new category of World Heritage sites shaped by
a blend ofhuman and naturalforces
Rice terraces in the highlands
of the Philippines are the
product of 2,000 years of
harmony between people and
their environment. This
cultural landscape was
included on the World Heritage
List in 1995.
Landscapes are all around us, and it is a
daunting task to set workable yard¬
sticks for gauging and protecting them.
The task is all the more difficult
because each culture views landscapes through
different lenses. A coherent idea of cultural
landscapes has nonetheless emerged under
UNESCO's guidance. Global evaluative criteria,
consistent yet flexibly workable, specify three
distinct cultural landscape types:
> clearly defined and intentionally created
sites (e.g., gardens like those of Aranjuez in
*¿M- ^ v
X x
Spain, Versailles in France, and Olmsted and
Vaux's Central Park in New York);
> organically evolved locales (e.g., the enditched
Somerset Levels and the stone-walled York¬
shire Dales in England, the river-fronting arable
strips of the Côte-de-Beaupré in the St.
Lawrence Valley of Quebec, Canada, and agri¬
cultural palimpsests like the rice terraces of
Luzon in the northern Philippines);
> associative sites (e.g., sacred and commem¬
orative places like Uluru in Australia, Ton-
gariro in New Zealand, and Ghana's sacred
groves).
Many sites embody more than one such
type, depending on the perceiver. To most vis¬
itors the Grand Canyon of Arizona is a won¬
der of nature, whereas many Native Ameri¬
cans view it as a sacred site.
As well as possessing a complex and con-
18 E UNESCO ^)URIER1 SEPTEMBER 1997

tinuing mix of nature and culture, landscapes
differ from other World Heritage sites in sev¬
eral ways. They are by their very nature exten¬
sive, occupying more terrain than sites devoted
purely to the built heritage. While some cul¬
tural landscapes are selected for their spectac¬
ular uniqueness, many are even more treasured
as representative, embodying qualities that
typify human impress over sizeable regions,
even over subcontinental areas. Whereas built
heritage sites are generally chosen as master¬
pieces and repositories of high art, landscapes
tend to have a broader, more universal appeal.
MA vast mosaic
These traits make it hard to decide which land¬
scape sites to select for inscription. Landscape
boundaries are difficult to circumscribe, land¬
scape features multiform and fluid, ever evolv-

ing, and subject to periodic change. Every land¬
scape is unique. But it is their representativeness,
rather than their uniqueness, that makes most
landscapes globally important. Yet to select for
global recognition even a sample of the world's
representative landscapes, let alone to demar¬
cate, describe, and protect them, would be
impracticable if not impossible. Landscapes
already listed or in process of being so are, in
truth, tokens of a much larger assemblage of
sites that deserve attention and care.
difficult choice
Today cultural landscapes are widely cherished.
But their widespread appeal raises another
problem of selection. Can we envisage how
the inscription of a relatively small number
of landscapes "of universal value" will affect all
the rest? Unhappily, the listing of a few,
whether chosen as uniquely spectacular or as
ideally representative, now sometimes signals
to governments and entrepreneurs that they
are at liberty to do as they wish with any land¬
scape not on the list, and hence deemed to be
of lesser aesthetic, historical, and social import.
Yet the most modest locales embody pro¬
found meaning for folk indigenous to or
otherwise familiar with them. And routes
I linking particular places the pilgrim tracks
ö
I of medieval Christians; the desert pathways,
| invisible to others, of Australian Aborigines;
| the trails of such explorers as Lewis and Clark
in the American West likewise enshrine essen¬
tial memories.
In short, in cherishing some landscapes we
must endeavour to treat them not as the only
locales worth conserving, but as tokens rep¬
resentative of much of the rich diversity of
the entire globe. A sense of connection with all
these peopled and storied places enriches and
humanizes life the world over.
Universal appeal
Heritage today is increasingly seen not merely
as the property of individual states but as the
rightful legacy of all humankind. Of no aspects
of heritage is this more true than of its land¬
scapes. Not only are landscapes no respecters of
political boundaries; their inherent worth
applies alike to natives and to those who love
them and often visit them from afar.
Indeed, the world's most famed landscapes
have achieved their fame largely through the
r
THE UNESCO lOURIER SEPTEMBER 1997

devoted study, delineation, and stewardship of
foreign artists and savants.
Indeed, experience suggests that the uni¬
versal appeal of landscapes particularly com¬
mends them to global care. Insofar as they are
in large measure the creations of nature, how¬
ever much altered and improved by human
occupation, they are less vulnerable to nation¬
alist exclusivity than are purely cultural sites
and relics. It is often the case that landscapes
perceived as of universal value have been pro¬
tected by concerns voiced internationally. For
example, designation by UNESCO enabled the
Australian government to rescue the south¬
western Tasmanian temperate rainforest, along
with its archaeological traces, from destruc¬
tive development.
Just as all the peoples of the world depend
for their physical survival on the shared man¬
agement of the global environment, so does
their spiritual well-being require responsible
stewardship of global landscapes. Such land¬
scapes enrich those who admire them from afar,
those who may indeed never visit but only
envisage them, no less than those for whom
they are local or national homelands.

ast and present: a creative dialogue
BY JACQUES RIGAUD I
A relationship
which has its
ups and downs
as well as some
surprising
moments of
harmony
The problem of reconciling the safe¬
guarding of cultural sites of historic
interest with the creation of a new, vital
architecture is one that is peculiar to our
own times. For centuries, indeed for thousands
of years, buildings of various kinds were erected
in a medley of styles without any thought
being given to respect for the past. While the
attraction of some sites lies in their homo¬
geneity and harmony, the Place des Vosges in
Paris, for instance, the Piazza del Campidoglio
in Rome or the Campo in Siena, the charm of
many cities such as Prague, Venice, Naples or
Rome resides precisely in the way that a wide
variety of buildings stand there side by side.
The fact that such contrasts fail to shock
us may perhaps he due to our awareness that,
behind the appearance of dissimilarity, there is
an underlying unity to the architectural her¬
itage. We arc conscious that, between the Doric
column and the buildings of Andrea Palladio or
Christopher Wren, between the Roman basil¬
ica, Istanbul's Hagia Sophia and Romanesque
art, and between the Pantheon, St Peter's in
Rome and St Paul's Cathedral in London, there
are just as many ties of kinship and continuity
as there are breaks in tradition. However much
they may differ or even clash, the successive
styles somehow fit in with one another and
get along together. It is worth remembering

that until the nineteenth century respect for
the heritage was unknown in Europe. Our fore¬
bears had no hesitation on religious, political or
aesthetic grounds in building a cathedral in the
middle of the mosque of Córdoba or knock¬
ing down the Louvre of Charles V to create
the Cour carrée, which they did with a kind of
"innocence" quite devoid of scruples about the
heritage.
The interior of the Byzantine
church of Hagia Sophia in
Istanbul (Turkey). This
immense domed church dating
from the 6th century was
transformed into a mosque in
the 15th century. The historic
areas of Istanbul were
included on the World Heritage
List as a cultural site in 1985.
Attitudes have changed. We have gradually
come to appreciate the irreplaceable value of
what we have inherited from the past, a real¬
ization that has become global in scale with
the "world heritage" concept that UNESCO
has succeeded in putting across. There is, how¬
ever, another reason for this shift in outlook.
Since the end of the last century, art in all its
forms has undergone a number of radical

THE UNESCO lOURIER SEPTEMBER 1997

changes which aesthetic factors alone cannot
fully explain. Industrial, urban civilization
has profoundly altered the design and struc¬
ture of towns as well as construction tech¬
niques and materials.
¡Changing attitudes
Aerial view of the Great Mosque of Córdoba in Spain (8th-10th centuries), an outstanding
monument of Western Islam. In the 13th century, when Córdoba was recaptured from the Muslims
by Ferdinand III of Castile ("the Saint"), the mosque was converted into a cathedral. The historic
centre of Córdoba was included as a cultural site on the World Heritage List in 1984 and 1994.
The results have been twofold: on the one
hand, the wholesale destruction of monu¬
ments and sites at the very time when a con¬
sciousness of the heritage at first concerned
only with preserving major buildings of sym¬
bolic significance was emerging; and on the
other, the untimely onslaught of materials
and forms that clashed with those of the
past steel, concrete and glass giving birth to
a radically different kind of architecture, con¬
trasting utterly with the buildings that have
come down to us from former times.
It is for this reason that several opposing
attitudes are represented in the modern
approach to this issue. One consists in regard¬
ing certain sites, monuments or groups of
buildings as sacrosanct and not tolerating any
visible assertion of modernity. This is the case
with the château of Versailles and with some
cities that were destroyed by war, such as War¬
saw, Nuremberg or Rouen, and have been
rebuilt as faithful copies of their old selves.
Another attitude is to advocate a type of con¬
struction that is in keeping with, or even a

pastiche of, that which already exists. A third,
conversely, is openly in favour of a dialogue
between past and present buildings. There is,
unfortunately, a fourth attitude, which I have
no hesitation in calling indifferent or igno¬
rant and which is the one that has done the
greatest harm to certain grand urban vistas, as
in the case of Brussels, London and Paris.
I Contrasting styles
The deliberate confrontation of ancient and
modern can come in various forms. The new
building can be discreetly fitted in: the audi¬
ence chamber created for Paul VI in the Vati¬
can by Pier Luigi Nervi is uncompromisingly
modern in form but crouches in the shadow
of St Peter's without having the slightest detri¬
mental effect on that august site. By contrast,
while the Pompidou Centre makes an assertive
statement in the heart of old Paris, its pro¬
portions are in keeping with those of the
buildings massed around it, and the piazza in
front of it provides a smooth transition
between it and its surroundings at the same
time as being a successful urban space. Another,
less controversial, example in France is Norman
Foster's Carré d'art in Nîmes. It faces the
Roman temple known as the Maison carrée,
but far fom overwhelming it, seems to con¬
verse with it across two thousand years. In
Germany, the Ludwig-Wallraf museums at
the foot of Cologne cathedral do not flaunt
themselves in any such face-to-face encounter,
but give the impression that they were
designed with this juxtaposition in mind.
The case of the Pei pyramid in the fore¬
court of the Louvre is a more subtle one. Clas¬
sical in form, it might appear, though func¬
tional, to be incongruous in such a setting,
but in fact its metal and glass construction,
all reflections and transparencies, lends a bold
and at the same time unassuming new touch to
the classical façades of the palace. The same
architect was successful in harmoniously inte¬
grating a new wing into the National Gallery
in Washington. On another level, certain sen¬
sitively-sited major civil engineering projects
such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fran¬
cisco or the Pont de Normandie in the Seine
estuary manage to blend in admirably, thanks
to the elegance and refinement of their forms.
In the past, the juxtaposition of styles may
have been a happy coincidence. In our own
times a construction in a contrasting style
runs the serious risk of affronting the eye and
striking a discordant note unless, that is, the
juxtaposition is carefully thought out and
modern architects, for all their boldness, show
themselves willing to accept with a kind of
humility the constraints imposed by the pres¬
ence of such prestigious and awe-inspiring
neighbours. If they do this, there is every
chance that posterity will be grateful to them
for enriching the heritage of the centuries.

The heritage of the period since the

It is hard for the recent heritage to compete on

difficult to make a well-considered choice
from such a vast field.
In addition, the use of experimental build¬

various kinds of cladding gives rise to new
conservation problems that have yet to be

They may be in bad condition or have been
radically altered; in some cases they are associ¬
ated with the destruction of monuments and
sites of previous ages.
On the eve of the new millennium, it is
high time to regard twentieth century archi¬
tecture as part of our heritage and to protect
it. Fortunately, interest in this new category is
growing, as shown by a number of recent
nominations for the World Heritage List.
A thematic approach
As of today the List contains properties in 108
states. To achieve a well balanced selection it
would be a good idea to introduce a certain
thematic approach, especially within the vast
field of twentieth-century heritage. Three inter¬
national specialist organizations are currently

working towards this goal. An International
Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)
working group is studying Art Nouveau build¬
ings dating from around 1900, which often
incorporate decorative ironwork, curved lines
and floral patterns (e.g. the Casa Milà and the
"Guëll Palace" designed by Antoni Gaudi in
Barcelona, Spain). The International Commit¬
tee for the Conservation of the Industrial Her¬
itage (TICCIH) is studying the industrial her¬
itage (e.g. Ironbridge, in the United Kingdom).
And DOCOMOMO is working on the func¬
tionalist heritage of the Modern movement."'
^Functionalist architecture
,.As well as the Bauhaus sites in Weimar and
Dessau (Germany), which were included in
1996, two other modernist sites already feature
on the World Heritage List: the serene Wood¬
lands cemetery in Stockholm (Sweden)
designed by Erik Gunnar Asplund (1918-
1 940), and the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, which
was inaugurated in 1960. More nominations,
however, can be expected, including that of
the Schröderhuis in Utrecht (Netherlands), a
fine example of De Stijl architecture built in
1924 by Gerrit Rietveld.
The Modern Movement is still influential
today by virtue of its fundamentally innov¬
ative and international character and its con¬
centration on the essential functions of a
building instead of merely its outer appearance.
Functionalism, which originated in Europe
at the beginning of the twentieth century, had
its heyday during the 1920s and 1930s and
soon spread across the Americas and elsewhere.
Its rapid expansion was made possible by col¬
lective action and organizations such as CIAM,
whose international congresses were attended
by architects and town planners, and by mag¬
azines, exhibitions, world-wide commissions
and emigration.
The international figures associated with
the Bauhaus also played an important role in the
spread of modernist ideas on all aspects of
design. With its dynamic composition of clear,
flat roofed blocks, its spectacular and artistic
use of a curtain-glass-wall and its wealth of
carefully designed interior and exterior details
(including furnishings and colouring), the
white plastered building built by Walter
Gropius in Dessau (1925-1926) might be
regarded as a modern work of total art
(Gesammtkunstwerk) and a characteristic exam¬
ple of functionalist, almost abstract architecture

and rationalism and tried wholeheartedly to

working on entirely new towns. They intro¬
duced new types of housing, including high-

These models of modernity now have his¬

them are worth conservation as examples of

IN YOUTHFUL HANDS
by Ingunn Kvister0y
Are you good-natured, respectful and respected, humble, tolerant, courageous, unselfish, con¬
fident, educated, dynamic, reasonable, diplomatic, intelligent and young in mind and body?
If you are all of these things, then why not become a "Patrimonito"a young heritage
guardianand take part in Unesco's Young People's Participation in World Heritage Preser¬
vation and Promotion project?
Patrimonitothe name is the diminutive of the Spanish word for "heritage"is a smil¬
ing cartoon character designed on the basis of the World Heritage logo to symbolize young
people's involvement in heritage preservation. He was invented by Spanish-speaking par¬
ticipants in a media workshop organized during the first global World Heritage Youth Forum,
held in June 1995 in Bergen (Norway). And because Patrimonito is a catchy-sounding word,
itand hewas enthusiastically adopted by other language groups at the Forum. By the time
a regional World Heritage Youth Forum was held a year later at Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe),
Patrimonito had really caught on.
The idea behind his creation originated in 1994. After working closely with leading
architects, archaeologists, jurists and historians from many countries, Unesco felt that the
time had come to get young people involved in protecting the World Heritage. Twenty-five coun¬
tries worldwide were invited to take part. Unesco proposed a challenging task. The countries
were invited to run projects, teach history, geography, science, religion, language and lit¬
erature from a World Heritage point of view, organize visits to sites and museums and use
the students' creative potential in the arts.
After that first year teacher and student representatives of the twenty-five countries
were invited to attend the Bergen Youth Forum and swap their experiences.
Both students and teachers handed out plenty of advice to Unesco on the development
of its World Heritage Education (WHE) project, and Unesco adjusted its programme accord¬
ingly. In the next two years efforts were made to involve more countries in the scheme,
regional gatherings for participating students and teachers were held and produced regional
action plans, and WHE teaching materials were developed to cover such issues as identity,
peace, environmental questions and tourism.
In 1996 two regional forums were held, one in Dubrovnik (Croatia), the other at Victo¬
ria Falls (Zimbabwe). Encouraging students and teacher trainers to become involved, pro¬
viding WHE teaching materials, organizing youth forums and strengthening national capac¬
ities are part of an overall strategy that links Unesco's standard-setting and instrumental roles.
It is helping to provide young people with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and commitment
to preserve World Heritage for future generations.

ords and eeds
BY GEORGES ZOUAIN The criteria written into the World Heritage
Convention contain some ambiguities
The implementation of the World Her¬
itage Convention is based on the def¬
inition of the cultural and natural her¬
itage enshrined in Article 1 of the
Convention. This definition is amplified by
the criteria set forth in a booklet entitled
"Operational Guidelines for the Implemen¬
tation of the World Heritage Convention".
To some extent the indivisibility of nature
makes it easy to choose "natural" sites. "Cul¬
tural" sites are another matter. The Convention
is open to all the world's cultures and civi¬
lizations, and this allows for considerable lat¬
itude in the interpretation of the definition
and the criteria.
According to the Convention, "the follow¬
ing shall be considered as 'cultural heritage':
<*" monuments: architectural works, works
of monumental sculpture and painting, ele¬
ments or structures of an archaeological nature,
inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations
of features, which are of outstanding univer¬
sal value from the point of view of history, art
or science;
«" groups of buildings: groups of separate or
connected buildings which, because of their
architecture, their homogeneity or their place
in the landscape, are of outstanding universal
value from the point of view of history, art or
science;
*" sites: works of man or the combined
works of nature and of man, and areas includ¬
ing archaeological sites which are of out¬
standing universal value from the historical,
aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological
points of view."
The Convention thus takes into consider¬
ation a wide range of possible cases, monu¬
mental and otherwise, but when it comes
down to it, "monumentalism" and "aesthet¬
ics " often take precedence over the significance
of a given site. As one ethnologist has written,
28

THE UNESCO lOURIER SEPTEMBER 1997

"What justification is there for allowing aes¬
thetic and museological criteria, which are
always extraneous, to take precedence over the
obvious fact, which can furthermore be veri¬
fied by looking at the way local societies func¬
tion on an everyday basis, that a 'nasty' pile of
mud coated with dried blood, sticky feathers
and broken eggshells often constitutes a
'fetish' more powerful and doubtless no less
rich in spiritual significance than a superb
statue which we regard as 'artistic'?" For
whom do we make listings and what criteria
do we use?

The ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani
(left) and Songo Mnara
(United Republic of Tanzania)
were added to the World
Heritage List as a cultural site
in 1981. The merchants of
Kilwa controlled much Indian
Ocean trade from the 13th to

Bonampak (600-950 A.D.) in
Mexico's Chiapas State, is
famed for its murals (detail,

life of a small Maya
community in the 8th century.
An answer to these questions emerges from
a statistical reading of requests for inscription
on the World Heritage List, and subsequent
acceptances and rejections. Rather than
strengthening the universality and unity of
the world, the current trend tends to mag¬
nify a certain division between countries. There
are those which can claim to contribute to
universality and the number of their sites
included on the List proves it (see Table 1).

The old walled city of Shibam
(Yemen), largely built in the
16th century, was added to the
World Heritage List in 1982. Its
tower-like buildings have
earned it the nickname of "the
Manhattan of the desert".
Others have only a single site on the List, or
none at all. There are also countries which are
not Parties to the Convention.
Is this breakdown accidental or does it arise
from subtle forms of discrimination? Since
1978, the first year when listings were made,
there has been a striking preponderance of sites
from countries of the so-called "North". This

preponderance, which diminished in relative
terms between 1984 and 1989, has again been
increasing since 1990. Since 1992, the increase in
listed European sites has continued, and has'
actually become more noticeable because of a
slowdown in listing for the other regions.
Between 1992 and 1996, 54 per cent of all
sites nominated and not added to the List
were European, as were 59 per cent of the sites
listed during the same period. European coun¬
tries thus submit more nominations than all
the other regions put together and also garner
more listings than they do. Table 2 clearly
illustrates this trend.
There are several reasons for this growing
imbalance. Firstly, the criteria for inclusion on
the list are interpreted in a special wayfmonu-
mentality or visible representativity are regarded
as self-evident criteria. These qualities are less
easily perceived in a cultural site in the Pacific
region than in a Greek or Roman site.
But other reasons are to be found
upstream. Thirty-seven UNESCO Member
States have still not adhered to the Conven¬
tion including fifteen from Africa south of
the Sahara, nine from Asia and the Pacific (eight
Pacific islands), six from Latin America and
the Caribbean, four from the Arab States and
three only from the European region.
Before a site can be nominated for inscrip¬
tion on the World Heritage List, it must
already feature on its country's national inven¬
tory of heritage properties, which is itself
deposited with the Convention Secretariat
according to a set formula. Nomination
dossiers, which have been improved since the
early years of the Convention, are becoming
increasingly complex and call for information
which is increasingly difficult to provide. Their
preparation calls for technical skills and admin¬
istrative capacities that are not everywhere avail¬
able. This penalizes the developing countries.
For several years, efforts have been made
by the Committee and the Secretariat to help

H m m a . i«aaVaL-3-*- r * _
these countries to make their national inven¬
tories, but the impact of these efforts is lim¬
ited, on the one hand by the conditions nec¬
essary for protection and conservation, on the
other by the difficulty of applying criteria of
authenticity, representativity and universal¬
ity to physical representations produced by
minority civilizations and cultures.
The big gap between the amounts allocated
by the Committee and the amounts of
approved requests (see Table 3) is bewilder¬
ing. At the beginning ofJune almost $220,000
(over 70 per cent of the available amount) were
left for preparatory assistance, and the rate of
use of the total approved by the Committee
is 37.1 per cent. While the Convention should
be rigorously implemented, it should not
become an instrument of exclusion or divi¬
sion. New, increased resources should be
deployed to obviate this risk.
Between the mid-10th and the early 14th centuries a
magnificent series of temples were built at Khajuraho
(Madhya Pradesh state, central India), a capital of the
Chandella Rajput dynasty. Around 20 have survived. This
group of monuments, a cultural site added to the World
Heritage List in 1986, constitutes an outstanding synthesis
of the architecture and ornamental carving of its period.

The South and the North face different
problems and defend different interests
when protecting and presenting sites
included on the World Heritage List.
In the North, a variety of organizations
hope that the state will protect listed sites
against the encroachments of tourism. The
countries of the South, on the other hand,
hope that inscription on the List will make
their sites better known, attract more visitors
and generate more tourist revenue.
Other problems arise in East European
countries where economies dominated for
decades by the state are in the throes of transi¬
tion to the market economy. These countries are
creating models of privatization without his¬
torical precedent. In this context, some orga¬
nizations of civil society are doing all they can
to obtain stronger state guarantees for the pro¬
tection of cultural and natural treasures, while
others are calling on the state to relax its influ¬
ence and control. Lack of funds is complicating
matters further. In this situation, sale to foreign



buyers sometimes seems to be unavoidable.
The practice of selling off certain national
properties seems to be gaining ground every¬
where, raising the question that in the long
term it may weaken the fabric of national life.
These properties must be given legal protec¬
tion. But here too, the answers given differ
under different systems of governance. In the
North attempts are made to draw up legal reg¬
ulations that are both detailed and global in

scope, whereas in the South the trend is to
guarantee certain basic rights. These two atti¬
tudes are difficult to reconcile. Let us take the
example of two national parks.
Yellowstone Park (United States) attracts
so many tourists that in 1 995 the World Her¬
itage Committee put the Park on the list of
World Heritage in Danger. But is radically
reducing the number of visitors the best solu¬
tion? It would mean that only a minority of
privileged people would have access to this
natural treasure. What about the rest? Would
they have to make do with photos, films, the
Internet, virtual reality?
How can we accept discrimination between
a minority with the opportunity to enjoy
direct experience of sites of universal value and
the overwhelming majority which would be
excluded from this experience?

When a site is placed on the World
Heritage List, that is not the end
of the story. If it is to stay on the
List, the characteristics and qualities
that justified its inscription must be preserved.
This means monitoring not only changes
that directly affect listed monuments and sites
but also changes in their management and
upkeep. Knowledge derived from monitor¬
ing is the necessary basis for a dialogue between
national heritage authorities and UNESCO. The
chief beneficiaries of such a process arc the
managers and other professionals who shoul¬
der the day-to-day responsibilities for world
heritage sites. It is they who are, or should be,
the most closely involved in discussions about
monitoring.
Managing a world heritage property is an
ever-changing task that calls not only for spe¬
cial knowledge of the site but for awareness of
what is going on around it and in society at
large. Site managers must always be ready to
cope with new situations such as the intro¬
duction of facilities for tourists, changes in
land-use or threats from pollution from indus¬
trial plants or cars. Positive developments also
need to be monitored. Co-operation with local
people can, for instance, open new possibili¬
ties for site protection and for participation in
tourism based on cultural values. Increased
interest from researchers can help to explain
cultural values and counteract threats to them.
It is often hard to detect changes on a day-
to-day basis, and those in charge of listed sites
need help. They need tools that will enable
them to check whether site management and
maintenance comply with commitments made
when the site was accepted for inclusion on
the World Heritage List.
A regular follow up and monitoring sys¬
tem can be such a tool, providing a fine-tun¬
ing mechanism for the overhaul of existing
management plans and the preparation of
action programmes for the future. Such a sys¬
tem could also lead to a constructive national
and international exchange of experience about
conservation methods and standards that
would increase awareness of the values of our
common heritage.
The Nordic countries have a tradition of
co-operation on matters of mutual interest.
This general rule, which applies to the selection
of sites for the World Heritage List, has been
extended to include monitoring since the
foundation of the Nordic World Heritage
Office in Oslo (Norway), and a plan for a sys¬
tematic survey of the Nordic items on the
List is now being drawn up. Once imple¬
mented, it should stimulate greater public
interest in the cultural heritage and encourage
a feeling of responsibility for it.

Sacred mountains are the
World Heritage sites that
enshrine the highest physical and
spiritual values. For many the sight
of a distant peak looming over
lowlands, floating above the clouds,
reaching towards the stars, awakens

divine mystery and splendour. As
the highest features of the land¬
scape, mountains have naturally
become associated with the highest
values and aspirations of cultures
and religious traditions around the
world.
Sacred mountains on the World

Sacred mountains have also

them feel deeply motivated to make
sure they are protected. Some of
these sites have become important
centres for preserving traditional

in southern France
by François Bordry
In October 1666 King Louis
XIV of France authorized
Pierre Paul de Riquet (1604-1 680) to I
start work on what was to become I
one of the seventeenth century's I
most ambitious civil engineering I
projects, the Canal du Midi.
Built only a few decades after I
the Briare Canal (1642), on which I
the technology of locks and the use I
of reaches of water at high altitude I
had been perfected, the Canal du I
Midi was intended to join the I
Atlantic Ocean with the Méditer- I
ranean, to "improve the prosperity I
of trade by avoiding the Straits of I
Gibraltar, pirates and the Spanish I
king's fleet", and to give "more con- I
siderable advantages to the provinces I
of Languedoc and Guyenne". The I
canal is sometimes called the I
Languedoc Canal or the Canal of I
the Two Seas.
The canal, which stretches 240 I
kilometres between Toulouse and I
the Etang de Thau, took 12,000 I
labourers, including 600 women, I
fifteen years to build and incorpo- I
rates feats of engineering that were I
technologically ahead of their time. I
Among the most remarkable of I
them are:
The Saint-Ferréol Dam in the I
Montagne Noire (Black Mountain) I
massif. This dam, the biggest of its I
time (780 metres long at the top and I
140 at the base), provides all the I
canal's water.
The number of locks, 63 in all. At I
Fonserannes an eight-lock staircase I
takes a stretch of the canal less than

280 metres long over a difference in
level of 21.5 metres. Riquet dedi¬
cated this extraordinary staircase of
water to his birthplace, the city of
Béziers.
The Repudre Aqueduct was the



first canal bridge built in France and
is now the world's oldest. It was
greatly admired by Vauban, Louis
XIV's great engineer, who used it as
the basis for other aqueducts on the
canal, most of which are still stand¬
ing today.

T
world's first navigable underground
stretch of canal. The 173-metre-long
tunnel was built on a site at the foot
of the hill where the Roman
oppidum of Ensérune once stood.
Riquet's genius lay in finding
water resources for the canal. Work¬
ing with a team of hydraulic spe¬
cialists, he explored the Montagne
Noire massif, a region he knew well,
and dug a 70-kilometre network of
channels to drain the waters of small
tributaries and bring the waters of
the Montagne Noire from the
Narouze Pass, the canal's highest
point (altitude 194 metres), to the
watershed between the Atlantic and
the Mediterranean.
Pierre Paul de Riquet died on
1 October 1680, before the work
was completed. His son Mathias
ordered the first navigation trials
on 15 May 1681. For more than
two centuries the canal fulfilled
expectations and brought prosper¬
ity to the regions through which
it passed. Both goods and passen¬
gers were transported along it.
Horse-drawn barges, small boats
and lighters carrying wine plied
between banks that bustled with
the non-stop activity of lock-
keepers, drivers, grooms, bargees,
travelling salesmen and merchants.
Today the Canal du Midi no
longer carries goods, but it has
taken a new lease on life with the
development of waterway tourism.
It is used by thousands of amateur
sailors who discover a marvel of
technological ingenuity and archi¬
tectural elegance which blends har¬
moniously with the countryside as
they drift down its winding, shady
course. It was added to the World
Heritage List on 7 December 1996.

Three highland villages
in Japan
by Hidetoshi Saito and Nobuko Inaba
Three farming villages in a
remote valley in the high
central mountains of Japan's main
island, Honshu, were added to the
World Heritage List in 1995. The
villages, Ogimachi, Ainokura and
Suganuma, are located in a region
historically known as Shirakawa-
go and Gokayama, where the
mountains rise to 1,500 metres. The
region is crossed by the Sho River,
which flows from south to north
towards the Sea of Japan, and
because of the steepness of the
mountain slopes, most of its vil¬
lages grew up on a narrow strip of
land along the river valley.
This is also a region of partic¬
ularly heavy snowfall. In winter
cold winds blow in from China,
picking up moisture while cross-

ing the Sea of Japan. Until quite
recently, before long tunnels were
constructed and bridges were built
across the deep valleys, contacts
with the outside world were very
limited. Because of the difficulty
of access, the area was once known
as "Japan's last unexplored region".
These geological and climatic
conditions gave rise to a unique
form of architecture. Larger than the
national average, the local farmhouses
are entirely constructed of wood,
each one being covered with a three-
sided, gabled thatched roof. This
building style is called "Gassho"
("joined hands" in Japanese) because

the steep slope of the roof recalls the

used by farmers to raise silkworms.

changed the lifestyle in the moun¬
tains. Many of the traditional
houses disappeared, and many
unique village landscapes were
destroyed. In the last century 92
per cent of all Gassho-style houses
have been lost, mostly within a
quarter of a century.
Community spirit
In the 1970s, the villagers of Ogi¬
machi, Ainokura and Suganuma,
where Gassho-style houses had
survived in relatively good condi¬
tion, started a preservation move¬
ment in co-operation with the local
authorities. They felt that if they
failed to take action, their village
environment would be destroyed.
Wanting to preserve the entire vil¬
lage landscape and the surrounding
natural environment fields, canals,
roads and forests, as well as build¬
ings, the villagers established con¬
servation societies, and national
legal protection systems were intro¬
duced in each village. Subsequently
the three villages have been well
maintained under the legal and tra¬
ditional protection systems.

organization called the kumi, com¬

organizes seasonal and daily tasks,
performed in co-operation or
shared in rotation, such as cutting
grass along the mountain road¬
ways, cleaning the canals, fire-
watching, and performing roles in
religious functions. Another tradi¬
tional mutual help system, the cus¬
tom oiyui or koryaku, comes into
play for marriage and funeral cere¬
monies and for projects such as
house-building and roof thatching.
This social system based on
mutual co-operation was essential
for survival in a high mountain
area with a production capacity
severely limited by natural condi¬
tions, but its evolution was also
doubtless influenced by the strong
spiritual links between the people.
Thanks to the legal and tradi¬
tional systems by which they arc
now protected, the villages of Ogi¬
machi, Ainokura and Suganuma
have succeeded in fully retaining
their time-honoured spirit.

commentary Federico Mayor
the leritage,
memory of the future
The fundamental dilemma facing all the world's coun¬
tries, to varying degrees, is that of the need to safeguard
the past while continuing to build the future, the need
to balance the demands of development and culture.
The international scope of the problems the details of
which have been brought to our attention in recent
decades through the rapid growth of communications
technology gives added impetus to the prevention
and education efforts tirelessly deployed by UNESCO,
in co-operation with all its Member States. UNESCO's
Constitution defines one of the Organization's principal
tasks as being to "maintain, increase and diffuse knowl¬
edge by assuring the conservation and protection of the
world's inheritance of books, works of art and monu¬
ments of history and science".
In the words of the Spanish scholar and writer Miguel
de Unamuno, "Memory is the basis of the individual
personality as tradition is the basis of the collective per¬
sonality of a people. We live in memory and through
memory, and our spiritual life is, in the last resort, noth¬
ing more than the effort of remembrance to persevere,
to become hope, the effort of our past to become future".
Today our world needs to adopt a broader definition
of the word heritage. As well as the physical heritage,

Available food resources are
increasing at a slower pace
than world population, especially
in developing countries. To reverse
this critical trend, farmers in these
regions require simple and effec¬
tive farming methods.
The United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme (UNDP) and the
United Nations University (UNU)
have devised an integrated farming
model adapted to tropical regions.
Participants at the Indo-Paciiic
Workshop held from 5 to 9 May
1997 in Suva, the Fijian capital, as
part of the UNU's Zero Emission
Research Initiative (ZERI), had an
opportunity to see an experimen¬
tal farm in action at the Montfort
Roys' Town Training Centre.
Food strategies in industrialized
countries are based on raising live¬
stock, the largest consumer of
cereal grains and soya bean meal.
According to Lylian Rodriguez, a
Colombian agronomist specializing
in tropical agriculture, 50% of the
world grain supply goes to feeding
livestock. If this produce were
reserved for human consumption,
studies estimate there would he
enough to feed 10 billion people, a
figure around which world popula¬
tion is expected to stabilize.
Rodriguez advocates an inte¬
grated farming system based on
recycling. Farmers from developing
countries would grow plants for
feeding livestock and recycle the
wastes produced. This circuit has
many economic and ecological ben¬
efits: livestock produces meat, milk
and eggs; animal excrements supply
biogas for cooking, heating and
light; manure and other residues
produce a compost that is used as an
organic fertilizer. Earthworms trans¬
form waste materials into humus
and can be used as animal feed.
EXPLOITING BIOGAS
In the rural areas of developing
countries, biogas is one of the
cheapest sources of renewable
energy. It forms naturally in humid
environments with no air or oxygen
and can be obtained artificially by
fermenting animal or plant waste in
a basin known as a hiodigester,
linked by a tube to a large polyeth¬
ylene bag. Rich in methane and car¬
bon dioxyde, this unpurified gas
supplies between 5,000 and 60,000
kilocalorics per cubic metre.
Biogas has many uses. It pro¬
vides cooking fuel, which cuts fire¬
wood consumption, and converts
manure into an improved fertilizer.
It reduces manure smells, elimi¬
nates cooking smoke and controls
pathogens, thereby improving the
farm environment.
Biodigesters do more than pro¬
duce gas. Their effluent can he
used to fertilize both soil-based
crops and floating aquatic plants
like cassava and duckweed, two
important protein sources for feed¬
ing pigs, ducks and chickens in
tropical regions.
For many years, Rodriguez has
worked with farmers in Viet Nam
to spread this model. The cassava
serves as a fence which protects
the hiodigester and ponds occu¬
pying a 61m2 area. Every 45 days,
the cassava leaves are harvested,
producing a yield of 35 kilos per
year, in addition to the 43 kilos of
protein produced annually by the
duckweed ponds. These are sig-

nificant quantities. This type of General view of the
. .1 i -i Montfort fish
microj>roject can improve the daily
lot of the most deprived rural fam¬
ilies, all too often left untouched
by development strategics.
PRIZED EARTHWORMS
Earthworms also play a key role in
the system. During the workshop
in Suva, Rodriguez passed around
a plate containing earthworms and
talked about them with affection:
"When under stress, earthworms
become agitated. These ones are
obviously happy." She mainly
works with Californian Red worms
(Eisenia foetida), the richest in
protein. Sexually mature at three
months, these hermaphrodites
mate every seven days. An earth¬
worm can have up to 1,500 off¬
spring every year. A veritable pro¬
cessing factory, these earthworms
feed on all sorts of waste. They eat

transformed into humus. Although
hybrid broiler chickens take ten
to twenty days to become accus¬
tomed to the red worms, the local
chickens and fish seem to savour
them.
FARM OFTHE FUTURE
The ideal is to group these various
practices into an integrated farming
system. The experimental farm in
Montfort is one promising example.
It belongs to a vocational training
centre set up some thirty years ago
following a contract between the
Government of Fiji and the Saint
Gabriel de Montfort religious order.
Every year, the Centre takes on
about 100 boys between fifteen and

seventeen, all from very poor back¬
grounds. Over a three-year period,
they learn manual skills and grad¬
uate to a job.
George Chan, a Mauritian of Chi¬
nese origin, directed the installation
of a vast integrated farming system
at the Centre. A hiodigester recy¬
cles sheep and chicken wastes. The
enriched water, purified of patho¬
genic elements dangerous to human
health, runs into 3,000 m2 of ponds
filled with several types of carp and
tilapia. Since the fish do not breed
on the spot, young specimens have to
be brought in from the outside. Rut
they grow quickly, providing a food
supply for the school kitchen and
local markets.
It cost about $30,000 to build
the farm, an investment Chan says
will be paid off in three or four years
by profits from livestock and poly-
culture. Annual production offish (6
tons) brings in $10,000, with an
additional $3,000 to $4,000 from
butcher animals. Vegetables and
flowers will be cultivated on the
pond banks, and strawberries and
orchids on rafts.
MUSHROOM GROWING
Shuting Chang, a specialist in mush¬
room genetics (see UNESCO Courier,
June 1994, "Biotechnology: the
resourceful gene"), advocates cul¬
tivating edible mushrooms on the
composted plant waste.
Temperatures in the tropics are
too high for growing certain species
known in Europe, like the Agari-
46 r
THE UNESCO lOURIER B SEPTEMBER I 997
cus mushroom (Agaricus bisporus).
Chang selects species adapted to
hot climates that only require sim¬
ple substrates (wood or sawdust,
rice or sugar cane straw, waste from
cotton or water hyacinths), pro¬
vided they have been correctly pre¬
pared and composted. In the case
of pleurotus (Vleurotus ostreatus),
the straw and sawdust mix has to be
prepared by autoclaving to elimi¬
nate toxic substances harmful to
the spawn's growth. When this pre¬
caution is taken, four to five har¬
vests are obtained every year. Black
mushrooms, widely used in Chinese
cooking (Auricula judae), grow
directly on the wood. Another
prized species, shiitake or per¬
fumed mushroom (Lentinus edo-
des), is rich in protein. One square
metre yields five kilos of perfumed
mushrooms, which only take one
month to reach maturity.
The nerve centre of
the integrated
farm is the
hiodigester
(below), where
plant waste and
animal excrement
ferment to produce
biogas and
residues for use as
fertilizer.
Mushrooms are a valuable
resource. These chlorophyll-free
plants can convert agricultural
waste materials into human food.
Furthermore, they have interesting
nutritional and medicinal proper¬
ties, not to mention their gastro¬
nomic attractions. For over 2,000
years, Chinese, Korean and Japan¬
ese traditional medicine has used
mushrooms for reinforcing the
immune system, enhancing mem¬
ory, delaying the aging process and
fighting tumours, according to
Shuting Chang.
Developing an integrated farm¬
ing system like the one in Montfort
requires an overall understanding
of low-cost production techniques
that protect the environment.
Horst Doelle, director of the
UNESCO Microbial Resource Cen¬
tre (MIRCEN) in Brisbane, Aus¬
tralia, drew workshop partici¬
pants' attention to advances in
microbiology. He pointed out that
at Montfort microbial techniques
are put into practice through use
of the hiodigester for example.
MIRCENs grant scholarships and
teach technicians from developing
countries about the importance of
microbiology for sustainable, eco¬
logical rural development. Not only
does the Montfort farm keep its
boarders well fed, it also provides
them with a valuable farming
model for the future. M

interview Youssef Chahine
Youssef Chahine is a major Egyptian film
director with an international reputation.
Earlier this year he was awarded a special
prize by the Cannes Film Festival on the
occasion of its 50th anniversary, asan
accolade for his lifetime's work in the
cinema. Drama, emotional intensity and
humanism are the leitmotiv of his films. As a
man Chahine has championed the cause of
democratic and progressive intellectuals
against the currents of fundamentalism and
conservatism.
Interview by Michel Fargeon
Youssef Chahine at the Cannes Film Festival (May, 1997).
After the presentation of your latest film.
Destiny, the 1997 Cannes Film Festival jury awarded
you its 50th anniversary prize for your life's work. You
thus join film-makers like Orson Welles and Luchino
Visconti who were honoured with 20th and 35th
Cannes Festival anniversary prizes respectively.
Youssef Chahine: For me, the greatest reward of all
was the love and warmth expressed by the film pro¬
fessionals from all over the world who gave me a
standing ovation in Cannes's huge Louis Lumière
theatre. When I walked up to the microphone to
thank them, I almost broke down. All those people,
who are supposed to be so tough, were opening
their hearts to me and love is nev er a one-way feel¬
ing. I couldn't find words to describe the feelings
they had aroused in me.
As for recognition of my life's work, I have to say
that none of the 33 films I have directed to date has
been easy to do. At first I had a hard time winning
recognition and acceptance, and I owe a lot to for¬
eign critics like Jean-Louis Bory, who organized
screenings of my films at UNESCO Headquarters in
Paris. It was a way of paying tribute to the work
being done in a country like Egypt, whose cinema
was usually regarded with condescension rather
than admiration. Many people in Europe thought
that all we could do was make light comedies
with belly dancing scenes, obviously though some
of us were working hard and making more worth¬
while films, often on shoestring budgets. That is
why I feel I am sharing my prize with all the film¬
makers from poor countries who are still having
great difficulty in making films in their own coun¬
tries. In view of my age I was born in 1926 I feel
that I am in a sense their elder statesman, and it
gave me tremendous pleasure to have been to some
extent their representative in Cannes.
Have the film festivals that have made you
known outside Egypt also enabled you to present
your own culture to others?
Y. C: For a long time people like me were largely
used as cultural alibis. We were second-string guests
at festivals, an extra Hag for them to fly and a token
of their internationalism. We got what we could out
of them. We were working flat out simply to exist as
Third World film-makers, and those festivals were,
despite it all, wonderful ways for us to make our cul¬
ture and our hardships known, to break down the
walls of ignorance. Knowledge knows no boundaries.
It travels from one country to another via sharing.
That is, incidentally, one of the themes of my most
recent film, Destiny. Without memory, we are
doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, which
have sometimes led humanity to its worst excesses.
All golden ages have emerged from periods of toler¬
ance, sharing and love for one's neighbour.
Yourfilm The Emigrantwas banned in Egypt
shortly after its release. . . .
Y. C: A fundamentalist group sued me and man¬
aged to convince the court that the film was blas¬
phemous. I had spent two years working on it and
was very upset by the court's decision, which I con¬
sidered unacceptable and repellent. The greatest
humiliation for an artist is to feel gagged. I don't
make films to hide them away. Apart from my own
disappointment, a lot was at stake in that trial: the
descent into intolerance always has terrible results.
It has to be countered at all costs, especially since
THE UNESCO (llURI ERB SEPTEMBER 1907
47

the fundamentalist approach is found everywhere,
in all religions. Only minorities are involved, hut the
press often unwittingly sen es their interests by giv¬
ing them a lot of publicity. That's the kind of thing
I had in mind when I thought oí Destiny. There was
also another, more private reason. I had a friend a
charming fellow, open-minded, tolerant, to some
extent my alter ego who acted in several of my
films but who suddenly went over to the fundamen¬
talists. I couldn't help but wonder about the deep-
rooted causes of such a change of direction.
In Destiny an intellectual is confronted by
fundamentalists. What resources does he have to
combat them?
Y. C: It is often said that violence begets violence.
Television assails us with scenes of violence, gratu¬
itous, ugly violence, whose only purpose is to fill the
pockets of certain producers. As if stories about
psychopaths and criminals were the only ones worth
filming! But the worst kind of violence is perhaps
to say to someone: "Everything you write will he
burned." To fight that violence I use. joie de vivre,
music, dance and, of course, reason. InDestiny the
main character, who is at first conditioned by sec¬
tarian thinking, recovers all his yoie de vivre when
he hears the film's theme song. He also dances, and
as he does so, his intolerance and pettiness melt
away. Dance is as generous as love.
As far as you're concerned, does the rise of
fundamentalism begin when freedom of thought is
forbidden?
Y. C: No doubt about it. But no one today seems to
be really thinking about the. reasons for the rise of
fundamentalism in different parts of the world. Why
do so many young people, in many cases college grad¬
uates, support these ideas from another age? Eco¬
nomic globalization devours people. Young people
today are excluded from the social process and are
replaced by machines. Yet a person's dignity is pri¬
marily defined by work. I am revolted when I see
countries sometimes rich countries let a whole
section of their population languish in ignorance on
the sidelines of society. But some day or other, some¬
how or other, people eventually start to think and
express themselves, overcoming their hesitations and
defying censorship. And then things change. . . .
Music and dance play a prominent part in
Destiny. Does this represent a return to yourfirst
love, the days when you made musicals?
Y. C: Music and dance are ways of handling tragedy
with a light touch. Dance is an invaluable form of
expression for comniunicatingj'oie de vivre. And I
love flamenco. It is music that links East and West.
The first films I saw when I was young were French
music-hall comedies. Music is the opposite of arro¬
gance. It is a form of sharing. Everyone loves to sing
and dance. It is always possible to say important
things without boring one's audience, and even to
give them pleasure in the process.
M Of allyourfilms, which is yourfavourite?
Y. C: Alexandria . . . IF/13? First of all because I
was born in that city. Secondly because it depicts
two aspects of my Alexandria the Alexandria I
knew thyt are dearest to me: friendship and tol¬
erance. All religions, all cultures, all kinds of ideas
lived side by side in that Alexandria. There were no
barriers between people: Arabs, Greeks, Armeni¬
ans, Italians, Jews, Russians and French, were all
friends. No one despised anyone else. We spoke
almost all these languages, not very well perhaps,
but we made ourselves understood with a few words
and phrases. Everyone, accepted everyone else.
Friendship was the rule. This melting pot of peo¬
ple and cultures has vanished today, and this is
something I bitterly regret. In Alexandria . . .
Why ? the city is a character in its own right and has
its own identity and vitality. This explains the title.
Yet you left Alexandria for Hollywood where you
went to learn your profession.

THE UNESCO ^>URI [RB SEPTEMBER 1907

narios that are very well constructed but which,
unfortunately, often tell trashy stories. They're
always well packaged, well edited and well acted,
hut the stories themselves are mediocre. You see
films that are remarkably well directed, but devoid
of content: a bit of sex, some stunts, explosions,
violence and brawling, but when I come out of the
cinema, I feel I've seen nothing at all. I don't go to
the cinema to waste my time.
And yet we have a kind of complex about the
United States. We think that if our films are not dis¬
tributed there, they don't exist. Hut the Ameri¬
can market will never be open to us; protectionism
in disguise prevails there. Basically, the Americans
aren't interested in films from abroad. Of course
this doesn't stop them flooding our screens with
their own productions. We sometimes even man¬
age to invent revolutionary techniques, hut they
don't want to know. I actually directed the first
chase scene in cinema history filmed using a hand¬
held camera, an enormously heavy old "Derbie". I
followed the actors down the narrow corridors of an
ancient temple. And yet my films, like those of
many other film-makers from countries of the
South, have been sidelined from major interna¬
tional distribution circuits.
You started out making light entertainment
productions before going on to more demanding
films.
Y. C: I prefer to talk in terms of cinema that is
' aware". There was a time when my friends
w ere leav ing Alexandria , and I asked myself why. In
The Land (1969) I tackled the theme of the fel-
lahin, who possess nothing but whose work pro¬
vides food for us all. But most of all it was after the
defeat of the Egyptian army in the Six-Day Warin
1967 that I really became aware of the situation in
my country. The final scene in The Sparrow (1973),
where the women take to the streets to express
their refusal of defeat, was a major turning point in
my life. Later, when I was faced with death, I said
to myself: "What have you done so far?". I have
expressed opinions and portrayed feelings which,
in the last analysis, encapsulated an experience
and reflected a truth. It is very hard to step back
and look at yourself, to see yourself as you really
are. As long as you don't give way to self-absorption,
when you talk about yourself in a social and human
context, you talk about other people too.
What about your experience in theatre?
Y. C: What a wonderful memory! It was one of the
greatest joys of my life! It was an incredible gamble
on the part of Jacques Lassalle, the then Director
of the Comedie Française in Paris, to ask me
someone from another planet who hadn't produced
anything in the theatre for forty years to put on
| a play of my choice. I chose Albert Camus's
| Caligula. You can imagine what an honour it was for
© me to work with the highly professional actors of
the Comédie Française. I threw myself body and
soul into this production, I gave it all I'd got. It
was a tremendous success: seventeen curtain calls
on the first night. An unforgettable experience.
Is it hard for Youssef Chahine to make films in
Egypt?
Y. C: It's getting more and more difficult for every¬
one. Once upon a time we made 120 films a year in
Egypt. Then eighty. Now we're down to sixteen.
Without French support even I could no longer
make films there. French TV channels buy the
advance rights to my films, which is a wonderful
show of support. Egyptian television on the other
hand stifles talent by only promoting mediocre
series. They even dare to use excerpts from my
films without my permission! I say to my Egyptian
students: "Freedom must be fought for nonstop; it
isn't handed out on a plate." Technique is not
important; you can learn that from books. What
needs to be taught is freedom. 1 also tell them that
in order to make films you must have a vision of
the world. To the actors, technicians and camera¬
men who start out in my films I say it takes courage
to lau ncli yourself and create y our own experience.
As for inspiration, that can be found by observing
people with a sympathetic eye. If you love other
people, every story is interesting. Everybody has a
magnificent story somewhere inside them. The
important thing is to know how to listen to the story
and then to tell it.

11th BORDEAUX BOOK FAIR
(9-12 October 1997)
The Unesco Courier will be taking part in the 11th Bordeaux Book Fair
(Salon du Livre de Bordeaux) from 9 to 12 October 1997.
As well as seeking to promote books, reading and professions associated with the book
world, the Fair is also a cultural festival in its own right. Two exhibitions feature on this
year's programme, one devoted to the Italian writer Dino Buzzati's work as a novelist,
journalist and playwright, and the other to French man of the theatre Jean Vilar. The
exhibitions will be accompanied by readings, debates and literary panels.
This year's foreign literature prize, which honours the work of a writer from outside the
French-speaking world and the quality of its translation into French, has been awarded to
the German writer Christa Wolf and her translator.
