### 64308: A Message from the Director-General of UNESCO

A Message from the Director-General of Unesco 
mE OR countless centuries the Nile has given life to the lands through which it 
~ [b flows. Today, the inhabitants of these lands, who are increasing rapidly in 
i . number, must ask their mighty river to give more than in the past. The 
© High Dam which is soon to rise at Aswan will usher in a new era of eco- 
nomic progress destined to provide more food for millions of people. 
These are the people to whom we owe one of the greatest civilizations in history. 
On the banks of their river they raised edifices the beauty and grandeur of which have 
never been surpassed. But with the new dam a vast lake will be created in Nubia, a 
lake which threatens to engulf some of the most glorious of these monuments for ever. 
An agonizing dilemma therefore faces the authorities charged with developing the 
Nile Valley: how are they to choose between the needs and welfare of their people 
and the treasures which belong not only to their country but to humanity as a whole? 
The authorities are fully aware that they are the depositaries, before all the world, 
of the monuments of the Nubian Valley, and they are eager to ensure their safeguard. 
It is these motives which led the United Arab Republic and the Government of the 
Sudan to appeal to Unesco for the purpose of obtaining the international aid which 
is indispensable. 
   
As soon as I received these appeals, I recognized that Unesco could not possibly 
fail to respond. The action it is being asked to undertake is in full conformity with 
the essential objectives of the Organization. We cannot allow temples like Abu 
Simbel and Philae, which are veritable gems of ancient art, to disappear; nor can we 
abandon forever the treasures which lie buried in the sand on sites not yet systema- 
tically excavated. 
Here is an exemplary occasion for demonstrating the international solidarity which 
Unesco has been striving to make a reality in all domains. No one, indeed, can 
deny the urgency of this cause and the effort required, or the need for sharing the 
burden among as large a number of countries as possible. 
Moreover, in return for the international assistance given, the Government of 
the United Arab Republic is offering not less than fifty per cent of the finds excavated 
in Nubia, authorization to carry out further excavations in other parts of Egypt, and 
the cession of precious objects and monuments, including certain Nubian temples, 
for transfer abroad. The Government of the Sudan, for its part, is offering fifty per 
cent of the finds from excavations to be made in its territory. 
An International Consultative Committee will be responsible for advising the com- 
petent government authorities on the plans for prospective excavations, on the use 
made of financial contributions, and on the distribution of counterparts offered by 
the United Arab Republic. 
There can be no doubt that the preservation and excavation operations which 
can, and must, begin within the next few months, will provide a new impetus to 
archaeology. The history of civilizations, religions and art, and our knowledge of 
prehistoric times will be immeasurably enriched as a result. 
At my proposal, the Executive Board of Unesco has decided that I should issue an 
appeal for international co-operation. This appeal, which I intend to launch in the 
very near future, will be addressed not only to governments and to the public and 
private institutions concerned, but also to public opinion in all countries of the world. 
A group of Patrons and an International Action Committee will support Unesco in 
this world campaign. I feel certain that all those who clearly understand what is at 
stake will wish to participate, for they will recognize that an unprecedented task 
calls for an unprecedented effort.

### 64309: The Drama of Nubia

THE DRAMA OF NUBIA 
by Georges Fradier 
OMEONE once said that it is best to announce a 
great calamity like a fire, a massacre or a 
tidal wave, in measured tones and in simple 
words. I shall therefore say quite simply: The 
monuments of ancient Egypt, among them 
Philae, Amada, Kalabsha and Abu Simbel, are in danger. 
But I wonder if the full significance of this sentence will 
not escape some persons. ‘What it really means is that we 
ourselves are in danger, The construction of the High 
Dam at Aswan threatens to engulf these monuments, or 
to disintegrate them. In other words it will obliterate 
them completely and amputate a portion—one of the 
most extraordinary portions—of our memories. 
I say “memories” advisedly. By definition as well as 
etymologically, a monument is something that reminds 
us; it is a memorial, a remembrance (the Latin verb 
monere from ‘which it comes means “to remind”). 
To the artist and the historian, a monument even 
creates memory, and is sometimes the foundation of a 
whole branch of learning, 
  
Painted caves and rock carvings are monuments: they 
do more than recall the world of hunting and magic in 
which men lived ten thousand years ago. They alone have 
revealed this world. Before they were discovered, this 
world was completely unknown and did not exist, 
In its place were all sorts of preposterous suppositions. 
But when we discovered it, we added thousands of years 
of knowledge, of conscious and unconscious adventures, 
to our past. In fact, the revelation is still so new that we 
have not had time to glean all it can teach us about our 
distant ancestors, that is, about ourselves. 
The Upper Nile has hundreds of prehistoric sites, 
mostly unexplored. Three or four rivers of the world, 
and the tenacity and genius of those who first lived along 
them, are the sources of what we call our arts and our 
sciences. But it was hardly fifty years ago that we began 
systematically excavating prehistoric strata in the valleys 
of the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus and the Nile. Such 
excavations are expensive and yield no gold or ivory trea- 
sures. But there was plenty of time to dig or so ‘we thought.

### 64309: The Drama of Nubia

THE DRAMA 
OF NUBIA 
(Continued) cannot be     
Suddenly the Aswan dam project has raised a cry of 
alarm; ‘within five years, within four years, the unexplored 
sites of Egyptian Nubia will be forever beyond our reach. 
According to further plans which have already been 
announced, the artificial lake will rise southward as far as 
the Dal (third) Cataract, and most of Sudanese Nubia 
will also be swallowed up In its turn. . 
In the Sudanese part of Nubia, more than 400 Xilo- 
metres of alluvium, sand and sandstone hold the secrets 
of the first colonists of the Nile. They built their villages 
at the edge of a Sahara which was probably still savanna; 
no doubt it was they who were the preceptors of Egypt. 
Will we now abandon hope of piercing the mysteries of 
that remote culture buried at the junction point where 
the Mediterranean world and the African world meet, and 
the study of which can throw so much light on the origins 
of both and on the links which perhaps unite them ? 
To resign oneself to such a loss would mean blithely 
accepting a kind of partial amnesia, like that of a man 
who has no memory of his early childhood or of his 
parents. It is quite possible that he may be happy 
without it. But we should pity him for having been 
emptied of his history and for not knowing where he 
came from. On the excavation sites which must be open- 
ed up immediately in Nubia, archaeologists and pre- 
historians may find the memories we lack (and this lack 
is cruelly felt, as soon as we are aware of it), memories 
which give dimension and proportion to mankind. 
4 To save the temples 
§ international 
aid is necessary 
  
THER monuments were destined for more solemn pur- 
O poses. The kings who created Philae, those who had 
colossal statues and halls carved deep in the rock of 
Abu Simbel, those before them who built the pyramids, 
believed they knew and sought to proclaim until the end of 
time *““‘whence we come, who we are, whither we are going.” 
We do not share their conviction, but we do not smile at 
it either. We know it to be the most precious depository 
of our collective memory: what we have come to call 
culture, or as we used to say, the humanities. 
No progress or decline of civilizations has prevailed 
against this beauty, which remains irresistible today even 
to the most ignorant men. These temples and statues are 
still, after twenty or thirty centuries, the models of the 
beauty they served to define. One does not need to grasp 
their whole historic significance in order to realize that 
they are among the highest works of man—among the 
really great achievements which justify our speaking of 
humanity and make us feel, in 1960, beholden to the 
architects, the painters, the sculptors, the priests and even 
the workmen of the divine pharaohs. 
There are other bonds, too. Anyone may if he so desires 
have brotherly feelings in his heart for the thousands of 
millions of men who preceded us on earth; or be moved 
by the thought of the long, slow development of technical 
mastery. Yet a nobler kinship is revealed to us by the 
most ancient masterpieces of art; they are manifestations 
of a need to go beyond what was done before, of a fervour 
and a pride about which history, without them, would 
tell us practically nothing. 
These irreplaceable monuments (and irreplaceable they 
are, for no museum can ever be substituted for a tem- 
ple, the sacred ground about it and the sky that bathes it) 
are more valuable than all the gold mines of the world. 
And there are not so many such monuments. The true 
6 
These great testaments in stone 
allowed to perish 
masterpieces of art, and especially of architecture, are 
rightly said to be universal: they are part of the heritage 
of all peoples, and that means that all of us need them. 
Only a few cities, however, only a few periods in history 
have reared them. A few countries hold what remains of 
the marvels which it was the privilege of certain centuries 
to amass along the shores of the Mediterranean, in China 
and in Egypt. Time, conquerors and merchants have 
destroyed so much already that there is dangerously little 
left. 
‘We need only a bit of violence, a bit of neglect, a bit of 
avarice, and Greece, China and Egypt herself will have no 
more to show us than formless ruins—like those in a 
little town of Burgundy ‘where, 160 years ago, there still 
stood the greatest of Romanesque churches, the master- 
piece of the European Middle Ages, Cluny. 
Today, an international institution exists which would 
have opposed the demolition of Cluny, even if the 
destroyer had invoked public necessity as his excuse. 'This 
institution is Unesco ; one of its tasks is to safeguard the 
cultural and scientific heritage of mankind. It has heard 
the appeals of the United Arab Republic and the Republic 
of Sudan. For indeed no one desires to destroy the glories 
of Nubia. The authorities who have decided to build the 
high dam are the very ones who are trying to do every- 
thing to preserve the monuments in the valley that will 
be submerged. But to do everything means to have the 
financial and technical resources which the authorities 
regrettably do not possess. International aid is therefore 
indispensable. 
No one should imagine that this campaign was conceived 
on the spur of the moment, that it is just panic at the 
eleventh hour. The Government of the United Arab 
Republic, thinking of the fate of Nubia, turned to Unesco 
nearly five years ago. A Documentation and Study Centre 
on the history of the art and civilization of ancient Egypt 
was then founded; it has been working under steadily 
greater stress to carry out a full scientific survey of the 
monuments in jeopardy. (See page 40.) 
However, saving the temples themselves, with their sites 
and, in some cases, the cliff they form part of, requires 
resources on a much vaster scale. Furthermore, even 
before the rescue operation can begin, thorough geogra- 
phical and geological studies of the ground must be made. 
Excavation expeditions 
in Egypt & Sudan 
to receive 50 9/0 of finds 
  
ities of the United Arab Republic and shortly after- 
wards, in agreement with them, asked the Institut 
Géographique National in Paris to make a photogramme- 
tric survey of the area, both from the air and from the 
ground. In October, UNEsco convened in Cairo an inter- 
national committee of Egyptologists, archaeologists and 
engineers. The experts journeyed up the Nile from the 
Aswan district as far as the Sudanese frontier and explor- 
ed most of the monuments along the valley which is to be 
submerged a few years hence. 
At the first meeting of the committee, the Egyptian 
Minister of Culture and National Guidance, HE. Seroit 
Okasha, made an extremely important declaration on 
behalf of his Government. In exchange for the interna- 
tional assistance requested, the United Arab Republic has 
offered (1) to surrender at least half of all future excava- 
tion finds made in the threatened area except for certain 
I July 1959, UNEsco sent a special mission to the author-

specimens which may be considered unique or essential 
to Egyptian museum collections; (2) to authorize excava- 
tions on other Egyptian sites; (3) to cede certain temples 
of Upper Nubia and permit them to be shipped abroad; 
(4) to give up an important collection of ancient objects 
which are State property. 
The Government of the Sudan, in exchange for inter- 
national assistance, has offered, with the same reserva- 
tions, 50 % of the finds made in the area. 
Today, the Director-General of Unesco, after a unani- 
mous decision by the Executive Board, is launching a 
solemn appeal to governments, appropriate public and 
private institutions and to the citizens of all countries to 
take part in this great international rescue operation. 
The Director-General now is in possession of the 
experts’ outline of the first emergency steps envisaged in 
the plan to rescue the monuments of Nubia. This plan 
includes a detailed list of all the threatened monuments, 
and what must be done to save each of them from des- 
truction. Frescoes must be taken down; bas-reliefs must 
be cut out; small temples must be taken apart stone by 
stone and rebuilt in a safer place, some in oases which 
the dam waters will create, others abroad. 
One would not 
dismantle 
Westminster Abbey 
  
OWEVER, as regards the famed ensembles of Philae 
H and Abu Simbel, the verdict of the experts is cate- 
gorical: the only solution is to preserve them where 
they stand. One would not dismantle Westminster Abbey 
and set it up again elsewhere. One cannot “save” the 
Parthenon by reconstituting the Acropolis in an open air 
museum. 
The Island of Philae, tragically flooded nine months 
out of the year since the first Aswan dam ‘was built in 
1902, can, on the contrary, become an island again. The 
rock of Abu Simbel can and must escape the muddy 
waters which need only to lick the feet of its colossal 
statues to cause them to disintegrate within a few years. 
The most imposing and most urgent task is the one to 
be undertaken here. A group of engineer-advisers at this 
very moment are on the spot making the necessary 
surveys and studies. 
To build dikes between the high dam and the artificial 
lake, downstream, so that Philae may find its purity and 
native sun again, to raise a rampart off Abu Simbel, so 
as to preserve not only the most majestic temple of the 
Upper Nile but also the light and shadow which make 
its statues live—this undoubtedly will cost money. Much 
more money than we are in the habit of giving to archeo- 
logists, art historians and museum curators. The sum 
may reach $30,000,000. But when we think that it is being 
asked of 81 States, among which are the richest and most 
powerful countries in the world, it seems hard to feel 
frightened by such a figure. One is even irresistibly 
tempted to compare it with that of the most modest 
armaments’ budget... However, comparisons of this kind 
are, it would appear, in bad taste and frowned upon as 
unrealistic... ’ 
So let us look at the photographs in this issue of the 
dwellings built for the gods thousands of years ago and 
which have suddenly become so fragile. Men and women 
of all ages, of every rank and language, will be looking 
at them with us. But not one of us is without responsi- 
bility: not one of us is powerless in our country, our com- 
munity, our city. While we turn these pages, we cannot 
be indifferent to the fate of these great testaments of 
stone, these proud, tragic affirmations of an eternal, 
invincible will to ennoble mankind.

of the second colossal statue of his father on the 
tagade of the Great Temple at Abu Simbel. At some 
unknown date, the head and torso of this colossus 
broke off from the mountain side in which the figure 
had been carved. The story goes that a hole was 
bored into the chest at neck level and wood hammered 
and pounded in. Water was then poured inside 
causing the wood to expand until the top of the

IKE 2 landscape before a terrible storm, 
‘when the horizon lights up in a translucent 
glow and an unearthly hush envelops all 
nature, Nubia has never been more beau- 
iful. 
The danger hanging over Nubia, it is 
true, has never been so great for it is now 
doomed to total obliteration. Despite the 
countless tragedies it has known up until the present, 
it has managed, for several weeks of the hot summer 
months each year, to preserve the general aspect that 
thousands of years of succeeding civilizations have given 
it. During these summer weeks, all the temples strung 
out along the banks of the Nile are visible and emerge 
from the waters ‘which, since the beginning of the century, 
submerge many of them most of the year. 
It may be difficult for those who have never set eyes 
on the extraordinary shores of the Nubian Nile to imagine 
the majesty of the sites, the fascination of the sanctua- 
ries, and the charm of the villages—difficult, in fact, to 
grasp the immensity of the tragedy. Many persons are 
undoubtedly familiar with Pierre Loti’s poetic description 
of the “Death of Philae”, and have heard about the 
building of the Aswan Dam and the raising of its level on 
two occasions. 
8   
At the beginning of the century it ‘was found necessary 
to raise the Aswan Dam in order to provide a more 
systematic irrigation system for Egypt and to prevent the 
river from draining away into the sea. The iron sluice- 
gates in the huge dam wall (made out of the same pink 
granite and taken from the same quarries nearby which 
the ancient Egyptians used for their giant obelisks) are 
closed almost all year long. They are opened only at the 
end of July when the river has turned red from the thick 
alluvion collected upstream, and the fields are then 
flooded and only the causeways and a few villages perched 
on arid hillocks emerge from the waters. 
In Nubia meanwhile, the level of the water now drops 
and the narrow strip of land along the river turns green 
again. The inhabitants attend to their farming, and the 
fields are soon thick with millet and water-melons. When, 
during this brief three-month respite, the river keeps to 
its bed, the harvest can be gathered. In mid-October, 
when the dam is closed, the waters again invade the 
stubble-flelds, now parched and cracked by the drought 
and the extreme heat. The palm-trees are engulfed up 
to their tousled heads, and from the far-off banks seem to 
be floating on the surface. Beneath these waters the great 
sanctuaries lie buried. 
It is not easy to visualize this extraordinary open-air

THE TEMPLE OF THOT, Egyptian god of wisdom and writing, at Dakka (left). Photo was taken 
just before the start of the temple's annual inundation in October. By the end of November all that 
can be seen above the water are the cornices of the temple pylon. To save the temple of Dakka it is 
proposed to dismantle it stone by stone and rebuild it in the safety of a nearby oasis. Above, in 
the Temple of Nefertari at Abu Simbel, a bas-relief depicts the Queen receiving the protection of 
the two goddesses Isis and Hathor. The work has conserved the full tones of its original colouring. 
museum nearly 300 miles long, containing monuments 
often surpassing Gothic cathedrals in size, submerged 
most of the year round. Under the waters lie not only 
temples but tombs by the hundred, quarries and nume- 
rous fortresses. The fortresses were built as trading posts 
and strongholds to defend vitally strategic points along 
the caravan routes, such as the centres fed by the gold- 
mines, the relay stations to distant deposits, the settle- 
ments specializing in artifacts, and the administrative 
centres of the country. 
But in this land of eternity, even the inundation of the 
monuments is not permanent, for like the cycle of rebirth 
in Nature itself, they reappear regularly every summer, 
if only fleetingly. 
At the time of the first Aswan dam at the beginning of 
the century, excavations and “soundings” were made to 
test the vulnerability of the menaced fortresses and 
necropolis centres built out of unbaked clay. For the 
temples, hurried missions were sent to make copies and 
descriptions of them before they were engulfed. The con- 
solidation work, feverishly yet carefully executed under 
Gaston Maspero and continued subsequently, proved to 
be truly effective. 
Not only did the temples remain intact when submerged, 
but the water even helped to remove their corroding salts 
and incrustations. Only the ancient paintings were 
washed away, sometimes actually enhancing the beauty 
of the carvings underneath. The monuments built of 
unbaked clay, however, could not resist the waters and 
were washed away by the floods for the most part. 
The temples erected in this region had been bullt of 
blocks of sandstone hewn from the finest quarries of 
Nubia, and this stone is most resistant. The situation is 
quite different for the sanctuaries located further to the 
south outside of the present flood zone. The temples here 
were built into the sides of the cliffs of the Libyan and 
Arabian mountain chains bordering the Nile. They were 
cut out of stone so friable that they cannot possibly hope 
to resist the action of water. 
It is these temples that the waters of the Sadd el Aali 
high dam will engulf—if nothing is done to save them. 
Since the new water level, once reached, is not expected 
to drop again appreciably, everything that is submerged

Thus all of Nubia will become a vast lake and an 
entire country will shortly vanish definitely and irrevo-

western Nubia. But the ribbon of land 300 miles long,

THE LEGACY 
OF NUBIA 
(Continued) 
THE EPIC OF KADESH. 
Carved on the northern wall 
inside the Great Temple of 
Abu Simbel are scenes from 
an epic of Egyptian history 
—the battle of Kadesh (1285 
B.C.) where the courage of 
Rameses Il saved Egypt's army 
from defeat at the hands of the 
Hittites. Central panel shows 
Rameses on his throne before 
battle is joined holding a 
council of war with his vizier 
and officers. Lower panel 
shows the Egyptian camp with 
the soldiers’ shields arranged 
around itin a kind of stockade; 
in centre two spies are forced 
to yield their secret. In upper 
section we witness the charge 
of the Hittite cavalry; curved 
line represents Orontes River 
in Syria which flowed round the 
citadel of Kadesh. On far right 
are mounted archers of Rame- 
ses. (See also pages 31-33.)

Ancient Egypt, Charles Nims 
with its remains of the creative genius of ancient Egypt 
which have withstood the elements for thousands of 
years, ‘will be lost. 
Egypt is the cradle of Mediterranean civilization and 
the archaeologist’s living book of history. Its scattered 
pages, discovered one by one, were pieced together and 
read with patience and devotion and now constitute the 
most prodigious and profound chapter on remote anti- 
quity. But despite the wealth of material found, many 
pages are still missing. Some of the most valuable are 
now lost, like the famous library at Alexandria, destroyed 
by fire, or, ‘what is less known, the ancient papyrus scrolls 
which until the last century peasants were wont to burn 
when scouring the ancient ruins for fertilizer. 
No effort should therefore be spared to find and preserve 
all the vestiges which may throw light on the history of 
our forbears, for ‘was this not the crucible in which the 
basic elements of Western civilization were forged? 
Not all the treasures of Nubia have yet been discovered. 
Those that do remain are of such vital significance that 
it is our duty, regardless of nationality, to help in preserv- 
ing them. For they are the links in a great chain which 
is significant and meaningful only by their cohesion.

than four thousand years on a narrow, semi-desert land

bordering the Nile, left by men who gradually absorbed 
a coherent civilization through their growing contacts 
with the Egyptians of the north. Nor is this all. It also 
brought a foreign contribution to Egypt proper, enriching 
the land of the Pharaohs by acting as the intermediary 
for trade with the more southerly regions. It was a 
reservoir of skilful craftsmen, of brave soldiers and 
officers, of diligent and honest civil servants; even brilliant 
statesmen who came to be so influential that with the 
rise of the New Empire in the 14th century B.C. their 
power steadily rose until they could help new dynasties 
to mount the throne of the Pharaohs. 
If we sail up the Nile in summer, when the flood-waters 
have receded, we can see all the remaining monuments and 
in the end have a vivid, impressive image of the past. Our 
journey will not be in strict geographical order, but does 
this really matter? Perhaps it will be all the more 
attractive since our pilgrimage into the realm of antiquity 
will be made not with some futuristic “time machine” but 
through the magic of hieroglyphics, that ingenious 
mechanism which Champollion revealed to us. 
No sooner have we passed the First Cataract than Philae 
looms up out of the water, iridescent amidst the blue- 
pink reflections of the Nile. It looks almost like a bird 
which is perched on an island pointing straight south.

Here is a group of sanctuaries we must always see 
preserved In its religious and geographical context, 
inseparable from the sacred site on which it was built to 
proclaim its message to the world. 
Sailing around the island, the great colonnade moves 
past us with its individualized capitals which announce 
the Hellenistic period of Egypt’s Pharaohs. We pause a 
moment to admire the romantic Kiosk of Trajan and 
then spy the first gigantic pylon of the temple itself, 
pierced on the west by the “mammis” gate where the 
Great Isis gave birth to the young god Horus. What an 
amazing itinerary the goddess Isis has followed down the 
centuries. She was the presiding deity of Philae, the 
supreme Mother-Goddess, and-her cult extended all the 
way to the shores of the Western world, penetrating into 
the sanctuaries of the boatmen of Lutetla (the arms of 
modern Paris still bear an image of the boat which can 
be traced back indirectly to her). 
It is in this region that Lower Nubia is at its most arid, 
a phantom river flowing between rock banks, bare of all 
but the scantiest vegetation, like a landscape in hell 
Now we drive deeper into Africa and soon come upon the 
little kiosk of Kertassi near the famous quarries which 
yielded the stones for the temples of Philae. The removal 
of this kiosk should present no very serious difflculties. 
The rear wall is covered with old Greek inscriptions, and 
The Unesco Courier, — February 1960 
busts in niches are cut directly out of the rock. The 
earliest ones date from the time of the quarrying of the 
stone for Philae. 
Here now is the Graeco-Roman temple of Debod. It is 
completely under water in winter as are the small chapels 
built in the region where the Nile narrows sharply before 
reaching a point where the rocks, purple-hued on the 
eastern side and sand-yellow on the western, form a gorge 
‘which the Egyptians call the Gate of Handcuffs (Bab 
Kalabsha). Beyond this gorge, Nubia becomes more 
fertile: a thin ribbon of cultivable soil on the edge of the 
desert. Here, Augustus had the temple of XKalabsha 
rebuilt in the style of those of the Pharaohs. ‘The largest 
of the Roman temples in Nubia—after Philae—Iit is almost 
intact, as are the chapels surrounding it. Its inner walls 
are covered with religious representations dominated by 
figures of the young god Mandulis, the Nubian form of 
Horus, and numerous versions of the bountiful Isis 
(Wadjet) in all her radiance. 
It is often a tiny detail In this wealth of monuments 
that discloses invaluable information. Thus, for instance, 
a pilgrim’s votive offering (a simple image clumsily 
engraved at the foot of a column) showed us the popular 
form in which the local deity was worshipped, and 
enabled us recently to identify a figure found on an object 
amidst the treasure of a tribal chief (the Blemmyes of 
Kustul) who had terrorized the Nubians when the region 
'was under Christian influence. This picture, in its turn, 
showed that the Blemmyes continued to venerate certain 
debased forms of the ancient Egyptian gods long after 
the religion of the Pharaohs had officially disappeared. 
Kalabsha is a temple that must not be permitted to 
perish. It could be dismantled and transported elsewhere 
stone by stone. The little nearby sanctuary of Beit el 
‘Wali, founded by Rameses II, must also be rescued at all 
costs. But it presents an entirely different problem, for 
it stands at the top of a cliff and is almost entirely hewn 
in the rock. The stone will have to be cut into, and blocks 
of the clifi-face removed-—an operation the experts assure 
us is perfectly feasible. 
Elephants’ tusks, ostrich 
feathers & sacks of gold 
HE monument is well worth the trouble. If the colours 
T on the two side walls of the entrance hall have 
disappeared, the reliefs themselves are admirably 
preserved. They depict Rameses’ army in action in the 
northern regions as well as scenes extraordinarily rich in 
detail on life in ancient Nubia. One panel shows a village 
with Pharaoh's chariots approaching to restore law and 
order. Another shows tribute paid by Nubia to the lord of 
the whole Nile down almost to the Fourth Cataract. 
Alongside sacks of gold, ostrich feathers, elephants’ 
tusks, leopard skins, tame animals led on a leash, and 
ebony woods, are depicted various articles produced by 
Nubian craftsmen. Famed for their skill, they worked 
for Pharaoh's court fashioning pieces of furniture and 
other objects in pure Egyptian style. They produced 
inlaid gold ornaments of bold design which depicted 
whole scenes from the everyday life of Nubia as well as 
the fauna and flora of “The Land of Gold.” The walls 
Inside the temple of Beit el Wali are adorned with 
religious paintings, their colouring as fresh today as when 
the artist applied them several thousand years ago. 
Continuing southwards we cross the Tropic of Cancer 
and stop at the little temple of Dendur, leaving behind a 
number of important monuments. Standing high above 
the Nile it is entered by a monumental stone doorway 
preceded by a broad terrace. The temple is dedicated to 
two heroes who drowned and were later deifled. Augustus 
himself worshipped them. 
Like nearly all the monuments of Nubia, Dendur was 
“Christianized” by the Copts. One inscription tells us 
that a certain Presbyter Abraham erected a cross here at 
the command of the Nubian king. Dendur is one of the 
temples the United Arab Republic proposes to offer as a 
grant, in return for foreign aid. 
‘We are approaching an important religious centre 
‘where Rameses II had no less than six temples hewn out 
of the Nubian mountainside. At the top of a cliff, 
between two 'wadis a sanctuary with terrifying colossi juts 
out over the river at Gerf Husein which ,must have 
commanded the trembling respect of the local inhabitants. 
The Nile valley now broadens and the cliffs give way

### 64311: The Legacy of Nubia; journey to a land condemned

THE LEGACY 
OF NUBIA 
(Continued)     
to a spacious plain covered with desert sand. A hundred 
yards from the water stands an elegant temple with its 
main axis parallel to the Nile (the only one in Nubia 
with Philae, oriented north-south). This is Dakka, 
dedicated to Thot, god of writing (hieroglyphics) and 
wisdom. It belongs to the late Egyptian period and was 
the last edifice reconstructed by the Nubian king Erga- 
menes in the reign of Ptolemy IV on the ruins of a much 
earlier sanctuary. It contains charming reliefs which 
have added many new details to our knowledge of 
Egypt's past. Dakka stands at the border of the empire 
established by the Greeks in Lower Nubia. It could be 
dismantled and removed. 
This will probably not be possible for the temple of 
Wadi es Sebua, partly hewn in the rock by Rameses II. 
Lying on a bend of the Nile and silhouetted against a 
background of bluish hills reminiscent of an Alpine lake 
scene, it is the only sanctuary in Nubia which still 
possesses its “dromos” (sacred avenue flanked by 
sphinxes). It was later transformed into a church the 
remains of which are of major importance. There are 
several Christian paintings done in Byzantium-inspired 
style which could be removed along with the sphinxes. 
In the Holy of Holies recess of the temple, Rameses can 
be seen offering large bouquets of flowers to the gods of 
the sanctuary, but in the bottom central part the god 
Amon is now covered over by a painting of Saint Peter 
holding an enormous key in his hand. 
A few miles to the north, excavations have laid bare 
one of the many towns of mediaeval Nubia—the fortress 
of Ikhmindi—preserved on the top of a cliff. It is 
surrounded by a thick stone wall, except on the river face 
where the steepness of the cliff was considered protection 
enough. The inner streets have vaulted roofs and a 
church stands in the heart of the town. 
In a small Christian chapel just south of Ikhmindi’s 
walls, a foundation stone was discovered last year 
inscribed with the name of the governor of the fortress- 
town and explaining that it had been built to protect the 
people and their cattle from the attacks by the Blemmyes. 
We should have to stop every mile if we were to indicate 
  
A NEW THREAT TO PHILAE. The danger to which the 
island of Philae is exposed is quite unlike that of any of the 
other temples of Nubia which threaten to be engulfed by the 
Aswan High Dam. At present the island is tragically under 
water all year long except for a brief three-month period. 
12 
Will the palace of Heka Nefer 
be found before Nubia is engulfed? 
all the ancient necropolises in this region, all the remains 
of settlements and chapels, all the rock inscriptions 
telling of local gods, of the passage of Egyptian armies 
since the Old Kingdom four thousand years ago, of the 
Greek mercenaries who crossed Nubia since the 7th 
century B.C. Here, at Kuban, is a stela indicating the 
waterpoints and wells dug for Pharaoh’s soldiers; there 
the ruins of a large brick fortress of the Middle Kingdom 
(2000 B.C.); further on the remains of a temple; and 
then the entrance to the Allaki valley leading to ancient 
gold mines, their rocky ‘walls covered with inscriptions. 
In a fertile plain bounded by a semi-circle of mountains, 
we spy Korosko, starting-point of the great caravan route 
to Abu Hamed in the Sudan. Here the Nile describes a 
great curve to the northwest and we come upon the little 
temple of Amada, dating back over 3,000 years to the 
beginning of the New Empire under Tuthmosis IIT and 
Amenophis II. Amada has exquisite reliefs and two 
monumental stelae of major historical significance. They 
relate the feats of the Athlete King Amenophis (the 
Egyptian version of Hercules) in Syria and Nubia. Amada 
is sure to be given high priority by the architects charged 
with “removing” the sanctuaries of Nubia. 
* 
The great temple of Derr stands a short distance away, 
almost entirely cut out of the rock on the east bank of 
the river. Built by Rameses II and dedicated to the sun- 
god Re, the third god of the Empire, it is one of the 
temples which the United Arab Republic has agreed to 
offer, wall by wall, to foreigh museums as a grant for 
helping to save the monuments of Nubia. 
Beyond Derr the Nile valley again trends to the 
southwest and we emerge onto a broad expanse of plain 
at Aniba (ancient Miam), the present and former capital 
of Lower Nubia. But nothing now recalls the splendours 
of the palaces of the Nubian viceroys which must once 
have been built here. Perhaps they are buried in the 
sand waiting to be discovered. 
    
 
— 
Unesco-Raccah 
When the new dam is built, Philae will find itself in a “sandwich” 
position between the two dams and a major portion of its 
monuments will be permanently out of water all year long. 
But the danger to Philae will be even greater than before since 
the base of the temples up to a height of 15 feet will be attacked

### 64311: The Legacy of Nubia; journey to a land condemned

  
‘We know though that these viceroys were important 
noblemen who were virtually independent, and that their 
principal tombs are found at Thebes, the great capital of 
the Egyptian Empire. One of these, the Tomb of Huy, 
Viceroy of Nubia in the reign of Tutankhamon, contains 
a series of remarkable paintings in multiple register. 
They show this high official receiving his appointment as 
“overseer of the southern lands,” accepting the royal 
signet-ring of gold investing him with full powers, and a 
procession of Nubian princesses arrayed in the habit of 
court ladies. One of them is represented riding in a 
chariot drawn by oxen and with a parasol of ostrich 
feathers growing out of her diadem. 
Finally the viceroy Huy is seen receiving the homage 
of the princes of Aniba, foremost among whom is a 
certain Heka Nefer, “the prince of Miam,” richly clad in 
the dress of a Nubian chief: a leopard skin on his back 
and girded around his waist like an apron, ostrich 
feathers in his hair, and large rings in his ears. He is 
shown prostrating himself before the viceroy. 
From inscriptions in Nubia and Egypt and other 
sources, 'we have now been able to piece together part 
of Heka Nefer’s life story and thus get a better idea 
of his station and origins. The son of a rebel chief of 
Nubia, he had been brought north to the royal palace at 
the time of a revolt suppressed by Pharaoh's officers. His 
standing as a Nubian prince and as the son of a local 
chief was recognized, and he was sent to the college of 
royal princes at Thebes where he became an intimate 
friend of the king's children, sharing their up-bringing, 
their games and sports and their military training. 
Thereafter, thoroughly steeped in the sophisticated 
culture of the capital and an enthusiast of Pharaonic 
civilization, he returned to his warmer native land to 
fulfil his role of prince. Nevertheless, he donned native 
dress again and garbed thus he greeted the viceroy. 
Perhaps one day before Nubia disappears, excavations 
in the region may uncover the remains of his palace as 
well as his tomb hidden in some valley of the Libyan 
range. ‘Who knows, it may be in an even more isolated 
and distant spot than the tomb of Pennut, another 
high official who served under Rameses VI thirty-two 
centuries ago, and whose burial chapel, located on the 
slope of a solitary hill two miles from Aniba, is covered 
with well-preserved paintings (it is hoped to remove it to 
a neighbouring oasis). 
Looming up almost across the river from Aniba, stands 
the rock of Ibrim dominating the whole vast plain that 
stretches south from the capital of Nubia. Since remote 
times it has been the site of the largest fortress in the

monuments will eventually disintegrate and crumble to the

region. At the foot, facing the Nile are rock chapels 
whose paintings should be removed to a safe place. 
Let us leave the chapels that dot the banks, the 
prehistoric cave paintings rivalling in beauty those in the 
“rock shelter” at Wadi es Sebua, with their galloping herds 
of oryxes, ibexes, giraffes, elephants and ostriches, and 
let us push deeper south to where the Nile grows wider 
as it winds towards its source. 
About 200 miles upstream from the First Cataract, a 
long way from Thebes, the official city of the god Amon 
and even more distant from Tanis, the capital chosen by 
Rameses on the Eastern Delta, stands the grandiose site 
of Abu Simbel. It is virtually on the same latitude as the 
diorite quarries in the western desert to which Egyptian 
working parties of the Old Kingdom swarmed in search 
of the ornately-grained green stone favoured by King 
Khephren's sculptors for his statues in the Valley Temple 
of the Second Pyramid. 
* 
Here, at the scene of one of man’s supreme achieve- 
ments, we have reached the climax of our journey in 
Lower Nubia. The monumental majesty of Abu Simbel 
completely dwarfs other sanctuaries nearby, although 
these are by no means lacking in treasures. Two of them 
—the rock chapels of Abu Oda and Jebel Shams—were 
hewn out of the living rock at the command of the last 
kings of the 18th dynasty (about 1340 B.C.) one of which, 
later transformed into a church, still enshrines the oldest 
Nubian inscriptions of Christian Egypt. 
The two rock temples of Abu Simbel (the Great Temple 
of Rameses and the Small Temple of Nefertari), rise on 
either side of a river of golden sand running down from 
a natural amphitheatre of pink sandstone. The most 
important sanctuaries built by Rameses in Lower Nubia, 
they are also the most remote, the most harmonious and 
the most colossal. Rameses built temples all over Nubia, 
each dedicated to one of the gods of the Empire. At Abu 
Simbel he brought the three great gods together and 
added his own image, raised to divine rank. 
Here, therefore, he reigns, a god among gods, 
surrounded by his entire family. Rameses imposed the 
cult of the Sun-King, born of the sun, the spouse of a 
goddess transformed into a ‘woman, the ravishing Ne- 
fertari. The queen is depicted in the flower of her beauty 
in the temple dedicated to her by Rameses to the north 
of his own sanctuary, identifying her with Hathor, the 
presiding goddess.

THE LEGACY OF NUBIA (continued) 
Born aloft like a Venus 
emerging from the waves 
The four colossi, adorning the facade of the Great 
Temple and standing over 65 feet high are an un- 
forgettable sight. The extraordinary harmony and 
delicacy of the heads completely counterbalances the 
deliberate heaviness of the bodies and the huge mass of 
this fantastic pylon cut from the very face of the rock. 
From the wall of her small temple, Nefertari seems to 
become alive and to step forward, radiant in her feminine 
beauty, towards her eternal destiny. It is impossible, in 
a few words, to attempt to describe the magnificence of 
this temple of temples, the purity of the carvings in the 
queen’s sanctuary, the images of Nefertari as a young. 
girl, surrounded by ‘wondrously slender, graceful 
goddesses, who seem to bear her aloft like a nascent Venus 
emerging from the waves. 
On the walls of the Great Temple, historic scenes of 
the utmost importance, royal inscriptions, and murals 
heralding a new trend in art, precede eloquent religious 
scenes which lead to the sanctuary where four statues 
again show the king in the company of his fellow gods. 
Politics and diplomacy often take precedence over prayer 
in this temple of Rameses with its dual message. 
The scenes, the inscriptions, the Osirian pillars in the 
first hall all recall the innovations of the great king. They 
mark a major turning point in the history of Egypt and 
find a small echo to this day in other parts of the globe. 
Thus the chronicle which Rameses caused to be carved on 
the south side of the terrace—the Marriage stela with its 
surface now scarred and pitted with the wind-blown sand 
of centuries—commemorates the conclusion of an age- 
long struggle between two peoples. 
The Stela recounts the marriage of a Hittite princess 
whose epic story (see article page 31) unforgotten up 
to recent times, inspired one of Leconte de Lisle’s Poémes 
Barbares. The frail princess Nefru Re is depicted on the 
arched top of the Stela which then tells how Rameses 
ventured forth in mid-winter, crossing his northern 
frontiers to meet her in his fortified castle. With the 
appearance of the Sun-King a miracle occurred; the mists. 
enveloping the earth were dispelled and the sun shone 
forth from a clear sky, spreading warmth over all things. 
A St. Martin’s summer had been brought about by the son 
of Re, and the princess immediately received the name 
occasioned by this phenomenon. Henceforth she was 
Maat Hor Nefru Re “She who sees Horus, the life force of 
the Sun God.” 
Protected where they stand in their hallowed bay, 
preserved in the rock so frail that no water can touch 
them without disintegrating their stones, the two temples 
of Abu Simbel cannot be allowed to perish. They must 
remain facing the rising sun whose brilliant rays each 
day awaken the colossal statues of the Great Rameses.

cutting across brown desert 
wastes. The line of demarcation 
between life and nonlife is start- 
lingly clear: one may stand at the 
edge of the cultivation with one 
foot on the irrigated black soil and 
one foot on the desert sands. The 
country is essentially rainless; only 
the waters of the Nile make life 
possible where otherwise there 
would be endless wastes of sand 
and rock. 
But what a life the Nile makes 
possible! The little agricultural 
villages contract themselves within 
the smallest compass, so as not to 
encroach upon the fertile fields of 
rice, cotton, wheat, or sugar cane. 
When properly cared for, the land 
can yield two crops a year... 
The richness is confined to the 
green Nile Valley, Only 3.5 per 
cent of the modern state of Egypt 
is cultivable and habitable. The 
remaining 96.5 per cent is barren 
and uninhabitable desert. Today 
perhaps 99.5 per cent of the popu- 
lation lives on the 3.5 per cent of 
the land which will support popu- 
lation. That means an even 
greater contrast between the 
desert and the sown, and it means 
that on the cultivable land there 
is a concentration of people close 
to the saturation point.

Rameses ll was one of the greatest 
builders among all the rulers of Egypt. 
The great rock-hewn ensemble of Abu 
Simbel is his most monumental and 
glorious architectural achievement. 
The Great Temple (right) measures 
108 feet in height, 124 feet in width. 
On the fagade, the four colossi, 67 
feet high, representing the Pharaoh, 
look down from the cliff on to a maj- 
estic sweep of the Nile. Above right, 
a detail of one of the giant statues’ 
feet. The scale of its proportions 
can be judged from that of the human 
figure. One of Rameses' children is 
visible between the colossal legs.

..THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
For over 3,000 years, six mighty figures (opposite page) have 
flanked the portal to the Nefertari Temple at Abu Simbel. 
Two figures of Nefertari stand between those of Rameses Il. 
On the interior walls of the Temple are carved figures of the 
queen (right) and Rameses Il (far right) making offerings of 
papyrus fiowers. Head carved on the sistrum, the ritual ins- 
trument held in the queen's right hand is that of Hathor, also 
seen on detail of pillar (above). [n place of the second ritual 
sistrum, the queen holds a sheaf of papyrus whose leaves, 
when shaken, give off a sound similar to that of the sistrum. 
The huge heads (top of page) from the nearby Great Temple 
facade are 13 feet from earto ear. Mouths are 42 inches wide.

THE SAGA OF A TEMPLE

“Try to imagine the Cathedral of Notre Dame carved out of a convey an idea of the labour that must have gone into this 
single block of stone... nothing in our part of the world can gigantic achievement.” Thus wrote the French author, Maxime 
  
  
FIRST PHOTOGRAPH: 1850. This is the first photograph ever made of the Great Temple of Abu Simbel. 
A daguerrotype, it was taken by Maxime du Camp in 1850. The facade lies half hidden under the sand which 
obstructed the Temple so completely in 1817 that it lay hidden even though the Nefertari Temple was known. 
When discovered, the 67-foot statues were so deeply buried that no one could tell if they were sitting or standing.

du Camp, after visiting Abu Simbel 100 years ago. Above 
left, first panoramic photograph of Abu Simbel taken in 1905, 
; SR N September 1812, a 28-year-old Swiss 
2 traveller named Johann Ludwig Burck- {| 
z | ~  hardt arrived in Cairo. His object was to 
Goll > join a caravan going to Fezzan and from 
=F, there to explore the sources of the Niger. 
While waiting for this opportunity to occur 
he decided to travel up the Nile to see the 
monuments of ancient Egypt which were then for the first 
time being revealed to Westerners. 
At this early period of the 19th century it was impossible 
for Europeans to journey up the Nile by boat beyond the 
town of Derr, some 150 miles south of Aswan. And no one, 
until then, had yet undertaken the arduous journey by 
land except one Englishman named Legh ‘who in February 
1813 had obtained permission to travel by camel to the 
fortress of Ibrim, 15 miles or so south of Derr. 
But Burckhardt was no ordinary European. He had 
studied Arabic in London and Cambridge. He had spent 
several years in Syria as well as the Lebanon and Pal- 
estine in the guise of a Mohammedan trader from India, 
and had gained such an intimate knowledge of Arabic, of 
Islamic religion and of the manners and customs of the 
people that he had come to be considered as learned as 
the Ulema themselves, if not more so. He was later to 
become the first European to perform the rites of 
pilgrimage at Mecca and adopted the name Ibrahim ibn 
Abdallah (he is the famous “Sheikh Ibrahim”). 
And so early in 1813 Burckhardt decided to explore the 
Nile valley south of Derr by land, and struck across the 
desert ‘with his camels, venturing into the Sudan as far as 
Dongola well beyond the Third Cataract of Dal. On his 
“way southward he followed the right (East) bank of the 
Nile, halting at Ibrim and then at the tiny hamlet of 
Ferrayg where he inquired about the Pharaonic ruins 
which might be visited in the region. He was told that 
at a place called Ebsambal (Abu Simbel) just north of 
Ferrayg, but on the other side of the river, there existed 
a small temple. The inhabitants, it should be noted, spoke 
of only one temple, and eyen a year later the people of

showing the river of sand flowing down between the temples. 
Above, Great Temple (on left) and Temple of Nefertari today. 
Derr and Ibrim told a traveller that only one existed. 
On his return trip northward from the Sudan, 
Burckhardt now followed the left (West) bank of the Nile 
in order to explore the sites on that side of the river and 
particularly Abu Simbel which no one had yet described. 
On March 22, 1813 he made a halt on the plateau, left 
his camels with his Nubian guide and went down into the 
sand-choked ravine. He inspected the small temple (of 
Nefertari) at his leisure and then, as time was passing, 
prepared to rejoin his companion. 
“Having, as I supposed, seen all the antiquities of 
Ebsambal”, he wrote in his travel diary, “I was about to 
ascend the sandy side of the mountain by the same way 
I had descended; when having luckily turned more to the 
southward, I fell in with what is yet visible of four 
immense colossal statues cut out of the rock, at a distance 
of about two hundred yards from the temple...” 
Almost totally buried in the sand for more than a 
thousand years, the facade of the Great Temple of Abu 
Simbel and—as Burckhardt quite logically surmised—an 
edifice hollowed out of the rocky cliff were thus restored 
to their rightful place as one of the most stupendous 
monuments of ancient Egyptian architecture. 
We do not know if he made a written report of his 
discovery before returning to Cairo in June 1815. We do 
know though that the British consul-general in Alex- 
andria at the time, Colonel Ernest Missett, whom 
Burckhardt met, did speak of the find to others and 
spurred interest in it. No longer was Nubia an unknown, 
inaccessible region, and the path now was open for the 
intrepid traveller to reveal its archaeological treasures. 
Explorers were soon at the site but they were either 
disheartened by the huge mountain of sand blocking the 
facade or failed to get the local help to clear it. The 
colossal facade ‘was to wait until 1817 before its entrance 
was first freed from the sand by Giovanni Battista Belzoni 
—himself a colossus of a man, six feet seven inches tall 
and of amazing strength. Belzoni arrived at Abu Simbel

CARVED INTO THE MOUNTAIN: A drawing made in 1855 of the inner entrance hall of the Great Temple with 
its eight colossal statues of Rameses Il, each 30 feet high. Statues stand knee deep in the sand. Each is hold- 
ing the crook and the scourge—the two symbols of kingly power. To penetrate the temple the artist had to let 
himself slide down the steep mounds of sand which blocked the doorway. Everything about the Great Temple is 
colossal. Carved out of solid rock it is 108 feet high, 124 feet wide and goes over 200 feet into the mountain. 
+ in September 1816 at the head of an expedition supported 
and financed by the new British consul-general, Henry 
. Salt. 
Like his predecessors he was dogged with difficulties and 
the refusal of the local people to help. Finally on August 
1, 1817 the Great Temple of Abu Simbel was officially 
opened in the presence of Belzoni, Salt's secretary H.W. 
Beechey and two Royal Navy captains. 
Twenty-two days were needed to remove enough sand 
to reach the entrance. For the first five days 100 local 
workers did the clearing, and when they refused to go 
on, Belzoni, Beechey, the two Navy captains, a Turkish 
soldier and a Greek servant took over alone, working 10 
hours a day with the heat averaging 112° F. in the shade 
(44° C.). They worked from dawn to eight in the morning 
and from two p.m. (the mountain then shaded them) 
until dusk. The sand removed rose up 50 feet. 
As they were consolidating the menacing mass of sand 
a toad emerged from the opening they had made in the 
upper left-hand corner of the temple door. When the 
creature had disappeared the whole team slid through 
the small aperture, crawled over the sand barrier filling 
the entrance corridor and followed the gentle slope down 
to the interior hall with its Osirian pillars. By the light 
of their torches and despite the smoke and stifling heat, 
they gazed in awe at the colossal figures before them and 
at all the reliefs they saw in the succeeding chambers. 
One question was still unanswered: were the colossal 
statues of the facade standing or sitting? This was 
answered in the winter of 1818-1819 when a large expedi- 
tion entirely cleared the southern (extreme left) colossus. 
22 
As a safety measure the legs of the statue next to it were 
also cleared thus revealing the now famous Greek 
inscriptions dating back to the Nubian campaign of 
Psammetichus IL (see page 39). 
From then on, the great names in Egyptology visited 
Abu Simbel and drew on its riches: Bonomi, Lane, Burton, 
Wilkinson, Champollion, Rosellini, Hay, Lepsius, Mariette, 
and many others. 
Despite repeated clearing operations, the sands kept 
blowing back into the Abu Simbel ravine from the 
Western desert. In 1892 sand-diversion walls were erected 
on the summit of the desert plateau. In 1902, when 
the level of the Aswan dam was first raised, Gaston Mas- 
pero, then director of the Egyptian Antiquities Service 
instructed the architect Barsanti to reinforce these di- 
version walls. Thus, it was only in 1909-1910, when all 
danger from the blowing desert had passed, that all the 
sand was at last cleared by Barsanti from the four 
colossi, from the terrace, the forecourt and the temple 
approaches. 
It is thus barely fifty years since the monumental 
ensemble of Abu Simbel has really been revealed to us, 
thanks to the successive efforts of these men. Had it not 
been unknown and buried in the sand for so many cen- 
turies it might well have ranked among the Seven Wonders 
of the world. From Burckhardt to Barsanti, travellers, 
explorers and scientists of all nationalities followed each 
other during the 19th century in order to free one of the 
finest masterpieces of Pharaonic art from its tomb of 
sand. Their example justifies the hope that a second 
wave of international solidarity will save the great temple 
of Abu Simbel from the watery grave that now awaits it.

Eaten away by the elements, lashed by sandstorms, the “Marriage stela” cut into the sandstone rock on the terrace of the Great Temple at Abu Simbel recalls some aged and yellowing document whose words can hardly be made out, yet whose story, once deciphered, is allthe more moving. The Stela tells of the marriage of Rameses [I with the daughter ofthe King o the Hittites in the 13th 
century B.C. On the fragment shown here, the princess is seen arriving followed by her father (right) wearing the ancestor of the Phrygian cap. Rameses is on exireme left under the marriage dais. The marriage took place on a dull winter's day, but when the pharaoh appeared the sun pierced the clouds. So the princess was named “She who sees Horus, the life force of the Sun God.”

THE SUN WAS A WITNESS 
AT PHARAOH’S MARRIAGE

Professor of Egyptology, Oxford University 
N immortal text graven in stone is one of the 
precious records of the past threatened in 
Nubia. It is the so-called “Marriage stela” of 
King Rameses II of the XIXth Dynasty, who 
reigned from 1290 to 1223 B.C. 1t is cut in the 
vertical sandstone rock on the southern side of the 
terrace of the larger rock temple at Abu Simbel and is 
one of the copies of a document composed at Rameses II's 
court and sent to various Egyptian temples to be 
immortalized on their walls. 
  
The copy at Abu Simbel is the only one to have come 
down to us in its entirety; three others are known from 
the temples of Aswan and Karnak in Egypt and from the 
temple at Amara in the Sudan. None of these versions, 
however, can vie with the one at Abu Simbel from the 
point of view of preservation, though even at Abu Simbel 
the inseription has not escaped some damage. To start 
with, the sculptor who had been instructed to carve the 
document in the rock did not find the available surface 
sufficient. He succeeded in cutting only forty-one lines 
of the inscription, and though he made his signs smaller 
and smaller as he proceeded, he was forced to stop when 
he had reached the bottom of the rock wall and so left 
out the end of the story. Moreover, the inscription was 
subsequently exposed to the weather for a long time— 
for centuries probably—until it was finally completely 
sanded up. By then sand driven against the inscription 
had considerably obliterated the surface of the stone. 
No ‘wonder, therefore, that the German scholar Carl 
Richard Lepsius, who was the first to study the stela in 
December 1843, and again in August of the following year, 
copied only eighteen lines, and these with many gaps, 
the bottom of the stela being probably still beneath the 
sand. It was only towards the end of the last century 
that the French Egyptologist, E. Bouriant, recorded, 
however imperfectly, the whole inscription. Much of the 
original is badly mutilated by corrosion and often whole 
words, even ‘whole lines, are so indistinet, especially in 
daylight, that a scholar can only hope to obtain a 
satisfactory result by having enough time and strong 
electric lighting by night at his disposal. 
Such conditions were afforded to the scholars sent by

THE GLORY 
OF RAMESES 11 
Cut into the rock walls of the first hall of 
the Great Temple at Abu Simbel are the 
stories of the exploits of a king who was 
also a god for his subjects. The principal 
story is told in the poem of Kadesh, scene 
of the battle where Rameses Il by his 
personal courage saved his army from utter 
defeat by the Hittites. These works are 
considered to be among the most out- 
standing examples of narrative poetry of the 
period and the figurative representations 
are of a beauty worthy to accompany the 
poems. Right, from the southern wall, 
in another of his campaigns, Rameses in 
his war chariot pursues the enemy. To 
leave his hands free he has tied the reins 
round his waist, guiding his team of horses 
by movements of his body. Beneath the 
enemy citadel (bottom left of the bas-relief) 
a shepherd flees before the Pharaoh (detail 
below). Opposite page, below, a warrior

yielded all its contents. The story which the inscription 
has to tell is remarkable enough to deserve the attention 
of anyone interested in ancient history. 
The “Marriage stela” records the marriage of Rameses II 
with a princess sent to Egypt by her father, the king 
of the Hittites, to strengthen the peace between their two 
countries, whose relations had been far from peaceful in 
the past. Ever since the reign of Rameses II's father, 
king Seti I, the Hittites, whose kingdom was situated in 
Asia Minor, had been pushing south into Syria, a country 
which the Egyptians always considered as lying within 
the sphere of their interest. 
A military expedition led by Rameses II in the 5th 
year of his reign (1285 B.C.), had resulted in the battle 
of Kadesh, a town of great strategical importance on the 
river Orontes in Syria. The Egyptian army still on the 
march and not in closed ranks had been taken by surprise 
by the Hittites and their allies, and only Rameses II's 
personal bravery had saved the Egyptians from a 
disastrous defeat. Despite the Egyptian claim, the battle 
must have been undecisive, and fighting probably went on 
for some time until a peace treaty was concluded between 
Rameses II and the Hittite king, Muwattali, in the 21st 
year of Rameses’ reign, that is in 1269 B.C. The text 
of the treaty was drawn up in two versions, one’ in 
Egyptian and in hieroglyphs, the other in the Babylonian 
language and in cuneiform writing. Both versions are 
still preserved. 
One would expect that the conclusion of the treaty was 
the right moment for the diplomatic marriage. The 
“Marriage stela” is not, however, dated in Year 21, the year 
of the peace treaty, but in Year 34 when Rameses II was 
already a man of about sixty. 
It is best to leave it to the stela itself to recount the 
event as well as all that had led up to it. After a long

introduction filling the first twenty-five lines and 
containing the customary adulation and praise of the 
Egyptian king, the text continues: 
“Then he (that is, Rameses II) equipped his infantry 
and chariotry so that they might strike against the land 
of the Hittites. He seized it alone by himself before the 
eyes of his whole army. He made a name for himself in 
it for ever. They will remember the victory of his arm. 
Who escaped his hand, those he abuses; his might is 
among them like a burning torch. And after they had 
spent many years, while their country ‘was perishing and 
devastated by disasters from year to year through the 
might of the great living god Rameses, the great king 
of the Hittites wrote appeasing his 
majesty, magnifying his might, 
extolling his victory and saying: 
‘Desist from thy discontent, re- 
move thy punishment, let us 
breathe the breath of life. Thou 
art the son of (the god) Sutekh in 
truth! He ordained to thee the 
land of the Hittites and we bring 
tributes consisting of whatever 
thou desirest. We carry them to 
thy noble palace. Behold, we are 
under thy feet, O victorious king, 
it is done to us according to all 
that thou hast ordained.’ 
“And the great king of the Hitti- 
tes wrote appeasing His Majesty 
year after year, but he never 
listened to them. And when they 
saw their country in this bad con- 
dition under the great wrath of 
the king of Egypt, the great king 
of the Hittites spoke to his soldiers 
and his notables saying: ‘It is a 
long time that our land has been 
in decay and our lord, (the god) 
Sutekh angry with us. Heaven

does not send rain upon us, all countries are enemies 
fighting us all. Let us despoil ourselves of all our 
property, my eldest daughter at the head of them, and let 
us carry gifts of propitiation to the goodly god (Rameses), 
so that he may give us peace and we may live’ Then he 
caused his eldest daughter to be carried and splendid 
tribute before her, consisting of gold, silver, common 
metal, slaves and horses without number, oxen goats and 
sheep in tens of thousands... 
“One went fo give the message to His Majesty saying: 
‘Behold, the great king of the Hittites has caused his 
eldest daughter to be brought with many tributes 
consisting of all (kinds of) things. They cover her who 
is at the head of them, the princess of the Hittites, and 
the great notables of the land of the Hittites who carry 
them. They have behind them many mountains and 
difficult passes and have reached the frontiers of His 
Majesty. Let the army and notables go to receive them.’ 
And His Majesty was delighted and the palace was in joy 
‘when he heard this marvellous event which had never 
before been experienced in Egypt... 
“When the daughter of the great king of the Hittites 
proceeded towards Egypt, the infantry, chariotry and 
notables of His Majesty were in her following, mixed with 
the infantry and chariotry of the Hittites, foreign 
warriors and Egyptian troops alike... And the great kings 
of all countries which they passed were puzzled, and 
turned back discomfited when they saw people of the 
land of the Hittites joined with soldiers of the king of 
Egyp r 
Here the text of Abu Simbel abruptly comes to an end, 
but some idea of the sequel is conveyed by the 
fragmentary versions of Karnak and Amara. From 
these it can be gathered that when the princess and her 
convoy reached the residence, Rameses found the Hittite 
princess very beautiful: he installed her in his palace and 
was seen every day in her company... From then on, the 
great enemy of old, the people of the Hittites, were like 
subjects of Egypt, whose people could live in peace and 
without fear because of the victories of Rameses II.

### 64319: Philae, the sacred isle

PHILAE 
The sacred isle 
by Etienne Drioton 
Professor at the Collége de France 
The riches of the island of Philae with its exquisite temples 
and colonnades and the graceful ‘* kiosk '' of Trajan have 
consecrated its renown. The temples are not the work of a 
single pharaoh. Each new king embellished and extended 
what his predecessor had done. But practically all the build- 
ings which still stand are due to pharaohs of the Hellenistic 
period or to the Roman Emperors who governed after them.

The Unesco Courier. — February 1960 
or the generation before mine, the temple of Phi- 
lae was still the pearl of Egypt. 
My teacher, Georges Bénédite, who copied its 
inscriptions in 1887 and 1888, ten years before the 
building of the first Aswan dam was begun, often 
spoke of Philae as one of the most remarkable experiences 
of his life. He would describe his feeling of enchantment 
each time he crossed the grim granite-rock desert of 
Aswan and came within sight of the sacred island of Isis. 
There stood the temple of the goddess reflecting her 
pylons, porticoes and kiosks in the blue waters of the Nile, 
surrounded by palm-trees and acacia mimosas. It was, 
Bénédite said, the vision of Paradise for one emerging 
from hell. 
But it was not for its beauty alone—today somewhat 
diminished, since the flooding of the island throughout 
most of the year has destroyed the vegetation—that Phi- 
lag was famous in ancient times. In the last period of 
its history, it had, with the adjacent islands, become one 
of the great religious centres of ancient Egypt, replacing 
Abydos in the cult of Osiris. 
Philae is the smallest of three islands, which are the 
remains of a granitic shelf, running from south-west to 
north-east, from which the rapids of the First Cataract 
begin, and which the Nile has demolished in carving out 
its course. Philae is also the most easterly of these 
islands. To the west, separated from it by a narrow 
channel, is the isiand of Bigeh, twelve times its size; 
then comes El-Héseh, three times larger than Bigeh, 
beside the west bank of the river. 
On his journey about 450 B.C., Herodotus did not get as 
far as this region. He stopped at Elephantine, four and a 
half miles below Philae, and merely questioned the in- 
habitants about points of interest that lay beyond. 
From what they said he gathered that the country above

Elephantine was mountainous and that one could see the 
chasms from which the Nile issued, between the crags 
named Krophi and Mophi. However, he noted nothing of 
interest before the island of Takhompso, twenty miles 
farther south. There was, then, presumably nothing 
remarkable about the region at that time. 
This agrees with negative archaeological data. The 
oldest building remaining on the island of Philae is the 
small temple of Nectanebo II (359-341 B.C.). This monu- 
ment is dedicated to Isis, identified with Hathor and asso- 
ciated with the gods of Bigeh. 
The remains of the temple of Bigeh are the facade of 
a vestibule built under Ptolemy XIII (father of the cele- 
brated Cleopatra) and the central part of a pylon 
decorated under the reign of the Emperor Augustus. The 
building replaced another one, dating perhaps as far 
back as Sesostris IIT (1887-1850 B.C.), and in any case as 
far as Thutmosis III (1504-1450 B.C.) and Amenophis II 
(1450-1425 B.C.). These last two kings had adorned it with 
statues. The gods worshipped there were those of Ele- 
phantine, the ram Khnum and his companion goddesses, 
assimilated to Hathor. Nothing in the composition of its 
pantheon revealed any particular pre-eminence given 
either to Osiris or to Isis. 
However, their supremacy was established in the area 
by the first century A.D. The historian Diodorus Siculus 
wrote: 
“Others maintain that the bodies of these two divinities 
(Isis and Osiris) are not at Memphis, but near the fron- 
tier between Ethiopia and Egypf, in an island of the Nile, 
near Philae, called for this reason ‘the sacred plain’. 
The monuments of the island are shown in support of this 
opinion: the tomb of Osiris, venerated by the priests 
throughout Egypt, and the 360 vessels for libations 
surrounding it. The priests of the locality fill these vessels 
with milk every day, and with lamentations invoke the 
divinities by name. Apart from the priests, no one is 
allowed on the island.” 
Hieroglyphic inscriptions carved in the temple of Philae 
confirm and add to the information given by Diodorus 
  
  Harpist 
36 
Siculus concerning the group of sacred islands at Philae. 
In particular, a divine edict on the subject is inscribed in 
two versions on the portal of the Emperor Hadrian. The 
better-preserved of them may be translated as follows: 
“The Holy Mound is the sacred golden domain of Osiris 
and his sister Isis. It was predestined therefore from the 
beginning (of the world)... Milk shall not be lacking to 
this Mount of the Sacred Wood, nor to the temple where 
Osiris is buried. Let there be provided for him, round this 
place, 365 tables of offerings, upon which there shall be 
palm leaves, in order that libations may not cease, thal 
water may never be lacking about him. Let there every 
day be divine service by the appointed high priest; let 
there be a libation to Isis, Lady of Philae, when the liba- 
tion of each day is poured. Let there be no beating of 
drums or playing of harps or flutes. No man shall ever 
enter here; no one, great or small, shall tread upon this 
spot. Nor shall any bird be hunted, nor any fish taken, 
within 40 cubits to the south, to the north, to the west, 
to the east. No one here shall raise his voice during the 
sacred time of the days when Isis, Lady of Philae, who is 
enthroned, shall be here to pour the libation each tenth 
day. Isis, Lady of Philae, will embark for the Sacred 
Mound on the holy days, in the sacred bark of which the 
name is... (effaced). 
“Re has signed this writ; Shu son of Re has signed 
this writ; Kéb son of Shu has signed this writ, which 
Thot himself has composed.”

Such was the religious character of Bigeh during the 
second century A.D. All or part of it was sacred to Osiris 
and had become, according to the Greek term, an Abaton, 
that is, an area within which it was forbidden to pene- 
trate. The sleep of the dead god beneath his sacred wood 
must not be disturbed. The same rule of silence ‘was 
imposed, during that period, in all the sanctuaries of 
Osiris, notably those of Memphis and Abydos, which also 
had their Abaton. But none of them achieved the fame 
of Bigeh. 
Close by this island dedicated to the dead god, Isis 
in her temple of Philae belonged to the world of the 
living. For this very reason, so as to provide a link with 
the world of the departed, she devoted herself to 
maintaining the cult of her brother-husband. On all holy 
occasions, the idol of Isis was taken from ifs tabernacle, 
embarked on the river and disembarked at Bigeh, where 
it presided over the solemn libations at the tomb of Osiris. 
The religious geography of the Philae site would be 
incomplete if mention were omitted of the function of 
the island of El-Héséh. The excavations carried out by 
the American archaeologist G.A. Reisner have led to the 
discovery of some funeral stelae which prove that the 
westernmost and largest island in the group contained a 
necropolis in which the faithful could be buried as near 
to him as possible, though the Abaton discipline kept 
them away from the tomb of Osiris. The custom was 
inherited from the oldest traditions of Abydos. 
As we see, the history of Philae mirrors the religious 
trends which inspired Egypt in the days of the Ptolemies 
and the Roman emperors. During the Assyrian, Babylo- 
nian and Persian invasions, the people gradually turned

away from the gods of the State religion, the sun gods 
who had been unable to protect Egypt. 
The faith of the people was transferred to Osiris, whose 
legend explained all ills and authorized all hopes. The 
cult of Osiris spread rapidly in those calamitous times, 
and it is not surprising that it should then have reached 
the threshold of the Cataract, where only the gods of 
Elephantine had been honoured before. 
The same trend was observable throughout Egypt. A 
legend was created to explain why there were so many 
temples of Osiris, for which the ritual required that each 
of them should have a tomb of the god. Seth had cut 
Osiris’ body into sixteen parts and dispersed them 
throughout Egypt in order to prevent Isis from reassem- 
bling them. She, however, went in search of these 
fragments and, wherever she found one, she made a tomb 
for it and consecrated a temple. Bigeh, for instance, was 
supposed to possess Osiris’ left leg. 
But this arrangement did not lead to harmony amongst 
the temple clergy; each temple claimed to be the sole 
possessor of the authentic relics. So finally a legend 
prevailed according to which Isis, in order to baffle Seth, 
had deposited many coffins of Osiris in different parts 
of Egypt, but only one of them, which could not be 
distinguished from the others, contained the god’s body. 
Thereafter, each temple had no trouble in claiming that 
its coffin was the right one—Bigeh just like the others, 
    
The Unesco Courier. — February 1960 
Another feature of religion at this time, unknown in the 
Pharaonic period, was the tendency to give more impor- 
tance to Isis than to Osiris. This tendency is apparent 
in the religious establishments of the Philae group. The 
mortuary character of Osiris being accentuated, Isis 
remained the living element, helpful to men, of the divine 
couple. The temple of Philae was dedicated to her. We 
should also bear in mind that, assimilated to the Great 
Goddesses from Asia, it was she who, in the Roman 
Empire, patronized the mysteries whose epithet was not 
“Osirian” but “Isiac”. 
While speaking of all the mirabilia which antiquity 
attributed to the Philae island group, we cannot fail to 
mention that the old legend of the Krophi and Mophi 
crags, sources of the Nile, as related by Herodotus, finally 
took up its abode there. A bas-relief in the temple of 
Philae shows, hidden under the earth in the midst of the 
rocks of Bigeh, crouched in a cavern from which he dis- 
patches his flow of waters, the god Nile. The ancient 
Egyptians, whose armies had many a time taken the road 
to the Sudan, knew as well as we do that the Nile came 
from much further south. But they also believed that its 
peculiarities—its regular floods and the fertilizing power 
of its waters—were due to a good genius hidden some- 
where in the bed of the river, perhaps in the Cataract, the 
swirling of which proclaimed his presence and his activity. 
This was not physical geography, but mythical geography.

### 64321: In the steps of Greece and Rome

IN THE STEPS OF GREECE & ROME 
by André Bernand and 
French National Council for Scientific Research 
tragic paradox today presides over the destiny of Egyptian 
Nubia. This region rich in relics of the Graeco-Roman period 
~ with over 1,200 Greek inscriptions, 16 free-standing temples, 
and seven hewn out of the living rock, and with that 
© orchitectural gem of the Mew Empire, the temple of 
Rameses Il at Abu Simbel, where one of the oldest Greek texts in the 
world is to be found, is doomed to disappear for ever beneath the 
waters of the High Dam, 
The hand of man, which built these temples, carved these statues and 
reliefs, and engraved these inscriptions, will, within a few years, undo 
the work of ten centuries, to speak only of the Graeco-Roman period. 
In point of fact, the geography wand history of Nubia are stamped 
throughout by paradox. Paradox of the Nile which unlike any other 
river, widens as one approaches its source, and instead of flowing 
straight, as is erroneously imagined, winds interminably round the Jebels 
of Africa. Paradox of the valley, sometimes narrow, as at Bab-el-Kalob- 
sha, where the cliffs form a kind of rocky gateway, under which the 
waters of the Nile rush tumbling with a loud roar; sometimes, as in the 
plain of Daokka, spread aut to the width of a lake, where violent storms 
sometimes blow up. Paradox of the desert land so barren that it is 
difficult to imagine its supporting human life, yet bearing countless 
traces of Graeco-Roman military and religious establishments. 
Even the history of the region is paradoxical. Here, on the confines 
of the Greek world, in these distant “marches” of the Roman world, the 
mercenaries of King Psammetichus, of the Ptolemies and of the Reman 
Emperors have left their imprint. What were they seeking in this far-off 
land reaching almost to the countries at the source of the Nile? 
Inscriptions in verse" 
e can glean little about the history of Graeco-Roman Nubia from 
the writers of antiquity. Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Agathar- 
chides, Pliny and Ptolemy seldom give us any historical facts, 
confining themselves mainly to ethnographic details, and much of what 
they tell us is vague or fanciful. 
Fortunately, the Greeks left behind over 1,200 inscriptions in Nubia, 
but they have never been recorded in a Corpus ond many of them are 
little known, as few photographs have been taken of the sides and texts. 
For the whole of Nubia, only about a dozen Latin inscriptions have been 
traced; much still remains to be done, since the Roman occupation of 
Nubig lasted from the time of Augustus to the end of the Roman Empire. 
This epigraphic material, which is our chief source of information 
about the history of Graeco-Roman Nubia, cannot be fully utilized until 
all the texts have been deciphered from the stone itself, but they have 
already been severely damaged by their annual immersion, particularly 
those at Kalabsha, most of which were painted. 
Thanks to Unesco’s assistance and the work of the Documentation 
Centre on Ancient Egypt, copies, rubbings and photographs were taken 
of the inscriptions at Abu Simbel in April 1956 and of those at Jebel 
Abu Duruah in September 1959. But all the other inscriptions will have 
to be inspected again before the dam is completed. 
It is particularly important to assemble these texts because Greek 
inscriptions in Nubia are not usually,long. Seldom do we find inscrip- 
tions of more than a few words. Among these are the decree of Aurelius 
Besario, the civil governor of the nome (ancient Egyptian province) of 
Ombos and Elephantine, ot Kalabsha, dating from the second third of the 
Third century AD. and giving the people of Talmis (the present day 
Kalabsha), at the request of the high priest Myro, fifteen days to clear 
the village of the swine that were polluting the temple; and the famous 
inscription of King Silko, also at Kalabsha, dating from the Christian 
period and commemorating the victories of the “king of the Nobatae 
and of all the Ethiopians” at Talmis and Taphis over the Blemmyes who 
had invaded his territory. At Abu Simbel, the longest text runs to no 
more than five lines and records the expedition led by the mercenaries 
“of Psammetichus || in Upper Nubia, 
However, the most striking and interesting inscriptions are a series 
of epigrams or inscriptions in verse—ten at Philae, five at Talmis and 
Abdullatif Ahmed Aly 
Professor, Faculty of Letters, Calro University 
two at Pselhis. Elusive though their meaning often is, some of these 
epigrams have great charm and reflect the high cultural level of the 
pilgrims who used to visit the shrines of Isis, 
One of them reads: “Our journey has brought us to the beautiful and 
sacred island belonging to Isis, in furthermost Egypt, on the borders of 
Ethiopia (i. e. Nubia); on the Nile we can see swift vessels bringing 
(stones for) temples from Ethiopia to our country, a fertile granary, well 
repaying a visit and revered by oll mortals” The epigrams of Nubia 
packed with delicate imagery in this vein, are difficult to decipher, and 
it is to be hoped that a specialist on such inscriptions will be able 
to come and read them on the spot before they disappear for ever. 
Prayers -in stone 
he other Nubian inscriptions are either dedications of temples or 
shrines, the names of priests or military leaders, or else pros- 
cynemata, that is prayers by pilgrims to a god to recommend a 
beloved one to his care. Many of these texts are dated, and most of the 
others con be dated by analysis of the writing or archaeological study 
of the building. Brief though they are, these relics provide some basis 
for a history of Graeco-Roman Nubia, which has never yet been written, 
for want of a Corpus of inscriptions. (1) 
Yet what a stirring history it would be! At Abu Simbel, os we stand - 
dwarfed by the towering figure of Rameses Il, our thoughts are carried 
to Psammetichus’ expedition to Nubia, the story of which is related on 
the leg of one of the colossal statues, a precious record giving us insight 
into the complex organization of the Egyptian army: 
“The King Psammetichus came to Elephantine and those who accom- 
panied Psammetichus, son of Theokles, and made their way upstream 
from Kerkis as far as the river was navigable had this inscription engra- 
ved. The foreign legion was under the command of Potasimto, while 
the Egyptians were led by Amasis. This inscription was engraved by 
Arkhén, son of Ameibickhos, and Pelekos, son of Eudamos.” 
At Philae, with its countless inscriptions covering not only the faces 
of the pylon but many other parts of the temple, we can picture the 
throng of pilgrims at the splendid festivals in honour of Isis, who conti- 
nued to be worshipped long after the issue of Theodosius’ decree (end of 
fourth century A.D.). From the top of the citadel of Ibrim (the ancient 
Primis), the Eastern gate of which is Roman, and where, to the north 
of the plateau, rises a building dating from the time of Emperor Septi- 
mius Severus (193-211 A.D.), our eyes can follow, from the dizzy slope 
of the hill, the course of Queen Candace’s desperate flight from the 
armies of the Roman prefect, Gaius Petronius, in 22 B.C. 
Desert garrison towns 
rom 29 A.D, onwards, the Romans established their protectorate of 
Lower Nubia, but here again, they seem merely to have followed 
the example set by the Ptolemies, It was under the rulers of the 
Egyptian dynasty preceding the Ptolemies that Greeks came to settle in 
the region extending from Philae southwards to Tachompso. 
This part of the country never seems to have formed a separate nome 
but was a territory attached to Philae. Judging by the inscriptions and 
remnants of military structures, it was only in exceptional circumstances, 
as during the war against Candace, that the Romans seem to have 
driven further into Nubia. 
The texts from Kalabsha (known os Talmis in Graeco-Roman times) 
bear witness to the soldiers’ cult of the Nubians’ god Mandulis, who alse 
had his shrine ot Philae, in the second century A.D. From those at 
Pselkis (modern Dakka) we learn that the worship of Thot (Hermes) 
was much practised. Both towns were obviously garrison centres guarding 
the road to Africa and protecting Egypt against the southern “barba- 
rigns. 
Kertassi was both a military station and a quarrying centre supplying

### IGNORE

   
  
Maat, goddess of precision and equi- 
librium, is the emblem of the Documen- 
tation Centre on Ancient Egypt, Cairo. 
~ N the desert shores of the Nile in Lower 
Nubia, a small army is waging a battle unique 
in history. Its task is twofold: to safeguard a 
heritage thousands of years old, and to record 
the lesson its treasures have to teach before 
they are obliterated within a few years. 
This army with its headquarters in Cairo, its flotilla on 
the Nile, its liaison officers, its reconnaissance patrols and 
its working parties operating in the field, represents a new 
force in the service of humanistic studies and the protection 
of beauty. For almost the past five years, under the sign 
of Mait, Egyptian goddess of precision and equilibrium, it 
has been running an inexorable race against time. It calls 
itself in all simplicity Documentation Centre on Ancient 
Egypt, a modest title indeed for a unique archaeological 
operation about to assume truly Pharaonic proportions. 
Under the torrid Nubian skies, the Egyptologists of the 
Centre and their teams of technical experts have been on 
the job year after year, advancing as fast as the exacting 
nature of their operations allows. The time these 
missions can spend in the field is limited by the intolerable 
summer heat, the floods of the Nile and the inundations 
caused by the sudden, unpredictable torrential rains which 
sweep the upper reaches of the river. Every single day 
is precious to them and following the Egyptian decision 
to go ahead with the gigantic project of the Aswan High 
Dam (the Sadd el-Aali) the time factor has assumed even 
more dramatic proportions. 
The Aswan project meant that the whole of Nubia with 
its irreplaceable monuments would be submerged by an 
artificial lake some 300 miles long. In the face of this 
major undertaking, sparked by the imperative economic 
needs of today, it would have been a waste of time to 
deplore its effects on the civilizations of yesterday. There 
was work to be done, and done quickly. 
At the beginning of September 1955, the first teams of 
Egyptologists arrived on the Abu Simbel site, the most 
important in the whole of Nubia. Here, twenty-five miles 
north of the Sudanese border, and downstream from the 
second cataract, the awe-inspiring tawny facades of the 
two sanctuaries of Rameses II still stand today in the 
dazzling desert light.

At the feet of Rameses and his queen, Nefertari, 
scaffolding went up. Archaeologists, philologists, photog- 
raphers, draughtsmen, architects and moulders arrived on 
the site. Work began at dawn and often went on far into 
the night since the heat and blinding light prevented pho- 
tographers from working in the afternoon. Invaded by 
cameras, searchlights and generating plants, the age-old 
sanctuary began to look like a film studio. 
Every square inch of the great Abu Simbel group was 
minutely examined. Since then, black and white and colour 
photographs, photogrammetric negatives, architects’ notes, 
casts and copies of hieroglyphic texts, rock graffiti and 
Greek, Coptic and Semitic inscriptions, have gradually 
been amassed in the Cairo Documentation Centre. Already 
this material constitutes the fullest and most accurate in- 
ventory of facts about these monuments that has ever been 
collected. Systematic surveys of the temples of Debod, 
Kalabsha and ‘Wadi-es-Sebua and the chapels of Abu Oda 
and Jebel Chains are now also nearing completion. 
‘Noah’s Ark’ on the Nile 
tion Centre has also had to set up and equip its 
own headquarters. From the very start of the 
Nubian expeditions it had to keep teams supplied and to 
protect photographic material. It would be difficult to 
exaggerate the difficulties this involved in the grilling heat 
of Nubia. The work, however, has become wnuch easier 
since the Centre acquired a five cabin boat, the ¥* Horus ”, 
which is used to’ carry out rapid missions and tours of ins- 
pection and to relieve working teamns. Now the Centre 
is to receive another boat, a kind of “ Noah’s Ark , built 
specially to its specifications by the Egyptian Government. 
This floating laboratory can be towed along the Nile and 
moored close to the sites where work is in progress. It will 
carry workshops, offices, stores and a library and will pro- 
vide the teams with living quarters.

down to the smallest detail for the recording and use of 
Egyptological material. Its lecture halls, library, card in- 
dexes and its air-conditioned photographic laboratories and 
archives have already made it an ideal centre for these 
studies. 
The Documentation Centre was set up in May 1955 by 
the Antiquities Service of Egypt with the direct co-opera- 
tion of UNEsco. It is an Egyptian body, financed by the 
Government of the United Arab Republic. UNEsco has a 
representative on the Board of Directors of the Centre 
and provides technical aid in the form of international 
specialists. 
Race against time 
in Lower Nubia 
ROM the days of Champollion—the founder of scien- 
tific Egyptology—the work of preserving monuments, 
organizing excavation work, research and documen- 
tation studies has been carried out by a great many foun- 
dations, museums and universities in Egypt, Europe and 
America. It has often been done most successfully, but 
almost inevitably in a piecemeal fashion. Never until now 
has so systematically organized a body as the Cairo Centre 
been at work in this field. Its operations have called for 
powerful resources and the services of large teams of full- 
time specialists working in a synchronized operation. 
Originally, the Centre had chosen as its first task to 
make systematic surveys of the Necropolis of Thebes where 
the tombs, once well-preserved, had shown signs of dete- 
rioration, The announcement of the High Dam project 
changed the order of priorities and began the race against 
time in Lower Nubia. In the next five years something 
like one hundred missions are planned with a clear-cut 
programme of work relating to the monuments threatened 
by the Aswan High Dam. 
The archaeologists and philologists attached to the 
Centre co-ordinate all operations taking into account exist- 
ing documentation and data. They direct work in the 
field and then record the results of every mission on card 
indexes. 
Painting and sculpture 
recreated by the camera 
AcTs needed to complement copies and descriptions 
are assembled by the technical section. Architects 
prepare plans, sections and elevation, complete to 
the most minute detail—every brick, every flagstone and 
even the smallest hole in a wall is marked in. Experts in 
architectural drawing trained at the Centre use photo- 
graphs to prepare exact plans of groups of monuments. 
The old method of making tracings from actual monuments 
is no longer used except for small details, or in cases where 
monuments are too closely hemmed in or in too bad a state 
of preservation for satisfactory photographs to be taken. 
Copies of those reliefs which are renowned for their beauty 
or historical interest and of any hieroglyphic inscriptions

on Ancient Egypt 
likely to provoke controversy, are made by moulders, who 
also prepare architectural models. 
Photographers find themselves working closely with most 
of the other specialists. Following details of the master 
plan, they develop their test film each day on the spot 
before sending the negatives to the developing laboratory 
in Cairo. At the same time they take identical photographs 
on colour film. Yet even all this work is not enough. 
The photographic reproduction of works of art, and of 
sculpture in particular, is—as André Malraux has termed 
it—a phenomenon of recreation. Freed from the recesses 
where they were hidden away, sculptures seem to spring 
into life again when viewed in this new light, becoming 
familiar and acquiring fresh significance. 
Photography, like drawing and even architectural plans, 
contains a certain element of subjectivity which can pro- 
duce various degrees of distortion. To obtain the absolute 
accuracy demanded by scientific recording, use has been 
made of photogrammetry, a process that has been em- 
ployed for the past forty years in the preparation of geogra- 
phical maps. 
This method was first used to survey a monument in 
1850 and today provides invaluable documentary mat- 
erial for archaeologists. The stereoscopic photographs, 
taken with the aid of a phototheodolite, give precise in- 
formation down to the smallest detail of a relief and thus 
make possible the creation of an absolutely faithful copy 
in reproductions, models and casts. 
New horizons opened 
by photogrammetry 
HOTOGRAMMETRY opens up new horizons in the know- 
ledge of forms and techniques. It may even make 
possible the discovery of architectural laws as yet 
undisclosed by Egyptologists, and may add to our know- 
ledge of sculptural techniques. For instance, the contour 
lines taken on the face of the North-West Osirian colossus 
(23 feet) in the inner court of the Great Temple of Abu 
Simbel, and those taken on the face of the South colossus 
(65 feet) on the facade, show some striking resemblances 
between the two even down to the modelling of the carti- 
lage of the nose. 
When all the survey programmes are completed, the 
Documentation Centre in Cairo will be a rich, permanent 
source of information both for Egyptological studies and 
for works destined for the man in the street. As a safety 
measure, all the archives are to be microfilmed and one 
copy of every document will be given special security treat- 
ment to guard against any possible destruction or 
deterioration. 
Thanks to the international action undertaken by UNESCO 
there is now reason to hope that these majestic monuments 
will be saved from the encroaching waters and that pre- 
sent and future generations will still be able to visit the 
giant statues of Rameses II and the island temples of 
Philae. Furthermore, the extensive work undertaken by 
the Documentation Centre on Ancient Egypt will give the 
world’s Egyptologists the possibility of adding to our know- 
ledge of one of the areas of the Ancient World which has by 
no means finished yielding up its secrets.

Aali) is completed. Water from the dam will be used to operate 16 turbine units buried more than 300 feet underground which to- 
gether with the existing power station at Aswan will give Egypt a total annual electricity production of 15,000 million kilowatt-hours, 
reducing its cost to consumers by two-thirds. Photo was taken during the construction of the present Aswan power station. Map on

GYPT is a gift of the Nile.” Thus wrote 
Herodotus, the Greek historian and tra- 
veller of the fifth century B.C. Indeed, 
all of this land of nearly 400,000 square 
miles would be nothing but a vast desert 
from the Libyan frontier to the Red Sea 
and from the Mediterranean to the 
Sudanese frontier if the Nile did not 
oh ~~ cross it from south to north before 
fanning out in a vast delta 100 miles from the coast. 
This is a rain-starved country. On an average there 
are six rainy days in Cairo per year and only one at 
Aswan. It is easy to understand why the ancient Egyp- 
tians considered the Nile of divine essence: it was the 
very source of all life in Egypt. 
One also understands why all agricultural development 
is at the mercy of the amount of water taken from the 
Nile. During the flood season, an immense volume of 
water is lost to the sea. The present Aswan dam was 
built to harness a part of it for irrigation in spring and 
summer. 
Called in Arabic “El Khazzan” 
(the reservoir), it was built at As- 
The Unesco Courier. — Februory 1960 
The dam wall, to be erected on a site four miles 
upstream from the present Aswan dam, will rise 225 feet 
and have a crest three miles in length. It will create an 
artificial lake 300 miles long with a capacity of nearly 
130,000 million cubic metres and a surface area of 1,150 
square miles, Several localities, including the city of 
Wadi Halfa will be submerged. Since the rapids of the 
Second Cataract will disappear under 30 feet of water, 
regular navigation between Egypt and the Sudan will 
become possible for the first time. 
Two and a half million acres 
of desert land will bloom 
N a climate as hot as that of Nubia, it is to be expected 
that such a vast expanse of water will give rise to 
evaporation. It is estimated that the atmosphere will 
annually absorb 10,000 million cubic metres of the 130,000 
million stored. The resulting rise in the humidity ratio 
of the Egyptian and Sudanese regions neighbouring on 
the artificial lake is certain to have 
an important effect on vegetation 
wan between 1899 and 1902 on the 
granite rock of the river bed in the 
middle of the First Cataract. The 
dam, 100 feet high, was to make it 
growth. 
Some of the water reserve Is also 
sure to be lost through fissures under 
the lake~bed. The Nile already pays   possible to store 980 million cubic 
metres of water in an artificial lake 
extending upstream for 140 miles, 
thus inundating the island of Philae 
and its sanctuaries, as well as part 
of the cultivated land. 
Between 1907 and 1912, the height 
of the dam was raised another 16 
feet, giving a total capacity of 2,400 
million cubic metres to the artificial 
reservoir which then backed the 
waters of the Nile upstream to a total 
of 185 miles. 
Finally, between 1929 and 1934, the 
dam was further raised by 30 feet 
bringing the reservoir’s total capacity   \ 
to five thousand million cubic metres. 8

a heavy tribute to the desert as it 
crosses Nubia and Upper Egypt. In 
these regions, it fiows over a veritable 
sieve. During the flood season in 
August and September, 5,000 million 
cubic metres are estimated to be lost 
between Aswan and Asiut, and 100 
Bigeh cubic metres a second between Asiut 
and Cairo. The volume seems in- 
significant compared with the Nile's

half million cubic metres of masonry 
(the Great Pyramid of Cheops had

The dam wall is over a mile long and has 180 sluice 
gates operating on two levels. The iron control gates are 
all opened in July, during the high water season, so that 
the Nile’s muddy waters may flood and fertilize the 
country. Early in October the sluices are closed and the 
river is kept back. In early spring when Egypt begins to 
lack water, the Aswan dam acts as the reservoir which 
irrigates the country. 
A vast inland sea 
covering [,150 sq. miles 
UT the Aswan reservoir is inadequate for Egypt's pre- 
sent-day needs. For the past half-century, agri- 
culture and industry have been unable to keep pace 
with the problem of food for its rapidly rising population. 
Egypt urgently needs more land for cultivation, better and 
higher crop yields, hydro-electric energy for its expanding 
industry. 
This “living space” can be won thanks to the Nile, the 
real wealth of Egypt, and by the construction of a new 
dam, the Sadd El Aali. The purpose of the High Dam, 
the preliminary engineering work on which has already 
been done, is the total utilization of the Nile’s waters. 
Not a drop of the river will be lost in the sea.

Sadd El Aali will create, Egypt will 
be able to increase its arable land 
surface by nearly half. In reality it 
is expected that as much as two and 
a half million acres of desert land will be brought under 
cultivation and that 750,000 acres now flooded will be 
reclaimed. 
Although the greatest advantage of the Sadd El Aali 
lies in the possibility of opening up new areas for farming 
and ensuring their regular water supply, the energy out- 
put foreseen for the dam would in itself be enough to 
justify its construction. Four tunnels for water evacuat- 
ion during flood periods and four chute tunnels will service 
16 turbine units buried more than ‘300 feet under the 
granite rock. They will operate all year round with a 
“head” (height from which the water drops) ave- 
raging 200 feet. The turbines will have an estimated 
total capacity of 2 million H.P. and an annual production 
of 10-12,000 million kilowatt-hours a year, nearly ten 
times present total consumption in Egypt. The Boulder 
Dam in the United States produces only half as much 
power. The combination of the hydro-electric potentials of 
both the Sadd El Aali and Aswan dam will raise Egypt's 
capacity to more than 15,000 million kilowatt-hours a year. 
When the High Dam of Aswan is completed, four years 
will be needed to fill its basin capacity. In that period, 
the population of Egypt will probably continue to increase 
at the same rate as in previous years and this increase 
(8,000,000 persons within the next ten years) makes the 
building of the Sadd EI Aali a vital necessity.

### 64519: Sudanese Nubia, 'terra incognita' of archaeologists

SUDANESE NUBIA 
‘TERRA INCOGNITA' OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS 
by J. Vercoutter 
Director of the Antiquities Service, Republic of the Sudan 
RCHAEOLOGICALLY speaking the Sudanese part of 
threatened Nubia is practically a “terra 
incognita”. It has never been systematically 
surveyed. But it is known to contain a vast 
number of unexplored sites which lie buried 
under the sands. These sites could provide 
valuable data about the early history of mankind, and 
their disappearance forever under the waters of the Nile, 
if not thoroughly investigated beforehand, will be an 
irreparable loss. 
Sudanese Nubia was a meeting ground of civilizations. 
It was the borderland between Egypt, with its Medi- 
terranean and Asian affinities, and Africa proper, and it 
was the gateway through which objects and ideas passed 
between the ancient world and Africa, and vice versa. 
MASTER-WORK 
OF 
ARCHITECTURE 
Much of Sudanese Nubia which is to be flooded 
is unknown territory, archaeologically. In the 
past few years alone over 100 sites have been 
recorded in this area. Photos right and oppo- 
site page show one of them: a master-work of 
Egyptian military architecture, the great castle 
of Buhen near Wadi Halfa. The fortress has 
just been discovered by Professor Walter 
B. Emery of the University of London who led 
two expeditions to Buhen last year and in 1958 
for the Egypt Exploration Society. The disco- 
very has already revolutionized previous con- 
ceptions of pharaonic military architecture. 
The fortress was built in the early Middle 
Kingdom as one of a series of trading posts 
and strongholds erected 3,900 years ago to 
defend the strategic area of the Second Cata- 
ract dividing Upper and Lower Nubia. Sacked 
about 1675 B.C. its vast fortifications were 
rebuilt and enlarged in the New Kingdom 
(1570 B.C.). Excavations are still under way 
and have already unearthed the skeleton of 
the earliest horse known in Egypt and a quan- 
tity of torn-up papyrus which may be the re- 
mains of military dispatches. On opposite page 
is a reconstruction of the Middle Kingdom 
castle, made by British artist Alan Sorrell, with 
the help of Prof. Emery and based on his plans. 
46 
  
As the link between two continents, the importance of 
Sudanese Nubia cannot be overstated. 
The reservoir of the high dam of Aswan will ultimately 
flood about 115 miles of the present banks of the Nile in 
the Sudan. By 1964, when the first stage of construction 
is scheduled to be completed, over 40 miles of Sudanese 
territory will be permanently under water. And these 
40 miles are the area with the country’s richest store of 
archaeological remains, containing 47 known sites and 
others likely to be unearthed in the course of prospection. 
But in the entire 115 miles region of the Sudanese Nile 
in jeopardy, only ten sites have thus far been partially 
excavated. However, a rapid ground survey together with 
an air survey recently carried out by the Sudanese Survey 
Jean Vercoutler.

### 64519: Sudanese Nubia, 'terra incognita' of archaeologists

4 CIT XG 
Department has revealed the existence of more than 
100 sites! The discovery of a remarkable Egyptian fortress 
of the Middle and New Kingdom recently made by Pro- 
fessor Walter B. Emery at Buhen (in the’ immediately 
menaced area) shows how much Sudanese archaeology 
has to give (see photos left and above). Can ‘we allow 
all these sites to be destroyed without their having been 
at least partly explored, excavated and recorded? 
The situation is no less urgent as regards the known 
monuments of the Sudan. Among the ruins still standing 
or clearly apparent and which will be engulfed by the 
waters, are seven ancient towns, four Pharaonic temples, 
at least 20 Christian churches (including some with 
frescoes), rock graves of the 18th Egyptian dynasty, rock 
chapels of early Christian date, numerous cemeteries, and 
sites with rock drawings or rock inscriptions. Special 
mention must be made of prehistoric sites, both Neolithic 
and Palaeolithic, one of which has recently been dated 
6300 B.C. by the radio carbon process. 
Among the sites which will disappear forever are the 
two temples of the XVIIIth Dynasty inside the twin for- 
tresses of Semna and Kumma; the small temple of 
Rameses II at Aksha, still buried in the desert sand; the 
lovely temple of Buhen with its magnificent carvings and 
paintings; the sites, mostly Egyptian citadels of the 
Middle Kingdom (2065-1500 B.C.) of Mirgissa, Dabenarti, 
Shelfak and Uronarti—to mention but the most important 
monuments known today. 
Each year, survey and inspection tours carried out by 
the Antiquities Service of the Republic of the Sudan 
reveal new sites; trial excavations lay bare unexpected 
finds such as the paintings of the Djehuty-hetep tomb at 
Debeira or the Faras alabaster vase which was found in 
a site thought to have been excavated. 
In the Sudan, therefore, everything, or nearly every- 
thing, still remains to be done. But in the short time avail- 
able and with its very limited staff, the Sudan Antiquities

Service is unable, on its own, to carry out the urgent work 
of surveying and excavating, of removing and safeguard- 
ing the monuments, and recording for posterity all these 
operations. 
The important, the urgent thing is to start, as quickly 
as possible, a complete archaeological survey, mile by mile, 
of the whole area to be flooded. A survey of this kind has 
never been carried out before. 
In 1955, when the Sudan first learned of the proposed 
building of the new dam at Aswan, its Antiquities Service 
prepared an emergency plan of action. In order to get a 
clear picture of what would have to be done it started a 
ground survey. But as this proved too slow a job with the 
limited staff available, an air survey was made. The 
entire threatened zone was photographed from the air in 
1956-57 by the government's Survey Department, and this 
air survey has now become the basis for the Sudan’s 
rescue plan. Thanks to Unesco, a specialist is now work- 
ing on the archaeological interpretation of these photo- 
graphs and the first precise archaeological map of the 
region will soon be available. 
What is urgently needed now is a photogrammetric 
contour map of the area for which aerial stereoscopic 
photographs have just been taken. Once the photogram- 
metric contour map is available it will be possible for the 
ground survey to get under way. It is envisaged that 
these surveys will be carried out on each bank of the Nile 
with prospecting teams for a general survey preceding 
excavation teams. 
Most of the monuments in the threatened area are built 
of mud brick and cannot be dismantled; but some have 
frescoes painted on brick and these will need to be remov- 
ed. Four stone temples (Aksha, Buhen, Semna West and 
Kumma) could and should be dismantled and taken to a 
safe place. The temples at Semna and Kumma stand on 
a rocky barrier, possibly the site of an ancient Egyptian 
dam, and offer an imposing landscape. The ideal thing 
would be to preserve them where they are.

### 64521: Question marks in the desert

QUESTION MARKS IN 
by Dr. Anwar Shoukry 
Director of Pharaonic Antiquities, Antiquities Service of Egypt 
fail to be struck by the two sharp- 
ly contrasting landscapes. In 
winter, during January for instan- 
ce, the country has become a sort of nar- 
row lake which extends to the cliffs on the 
Libyan and Arabian sides of the Nile valley, 
on which stand villages with large houses, 
painted and adorned with earthenware tiles. 
But in summer—particularly in August and 
. September—when the sluice gates of the 
Aswan dam have been opened to let through 
the flood waters—the Nile retreats almost to 
its old bed. Wide stretches of black earth 
appear, providing a few green crops which 
often do not even ripen. And in places, 
great temples, most of them almost invi- 
sible under the winter waters, now tower 
up in the shape of imposing ruins: Ka- 
labsha, Dendur, Dakka. 
When the building of the first dam was 
decided on, the Antiquities Service of Egypt, 
then under the direction of Gaston Mas- 
pero, not only consolidated the temples, 
but also carried out excavations in the area 
before the dam was raised and then each 
time it was heightened until the flood- 
water level reached the 121 metre mark. 
It might at first be thought, therefore, that 
only the land above spot level 121 would 
remain to be excavated before the erection 
of the High Dam. 
In archaeology, however, things are 
never as simple as they may first appear. 
How can one be sure that a valley has 
been properly excavated when, despite the 
fact that it is not very wide, it is hundreds 
of miles long? Is there any chance of find- 
ing something in the areas flooded in 
winter? What may be found above spot 
level 121? Have excavations in Nubia left 
no mysteries still to be penetrated? 
o one who visits present-day Nubia 
N at different times of the year can 
First of all there are certain sites where 
the excavations carried out have been 
inadequate. They should be continued as 
long as we are lucky to have the low 
waters during the summer, particularly in 
the case of the great Nubian temples. The 
scientists who were sent to monuments 
like Kalabsha or Wadi es-Sebua cleared the 
inside of the temples but did not explore 
the surroundings. 
an 
In 1956, a study was made of the struc- 
ture of the various walls that surround the 
temple of Kalabsha. It did not take long 
to realize that one of these walls could be 
explained only by the presence of a sacred 
Jake. Only one such lake—that of Den- 
dara—has come down to us intact. 
Excavations at Kalabsha are thus clearly 
imperative. Clearing work carried out to 
the west of the supposed lake by the Anti- 
quities Service in September 1959, has 
already brought to light the roofs of two 
chapels which are apparently intact. Un- 
fortunately, the Nile rose abnormally high 
during this period so that excavation work 
had to be interrupted. This is not the 
place to enter into a discussion on the 
theological reasons justifying these excava- 
tions but it will be readily understood that 
a detailed knowledge of the way a temple is 
arranged is important if one is to get really 
to the heart of Egyptian religion. 
In the present case, what is at stake is 
not merely an architectural survey but the 
interpretation of an essential element in 
ancient temples. And this may be all the 
more important because in Nubia, where 
the population has never been very dense, 
the monuments have suffered less then else- 
where. 
The situation is much the same as re- 
gards the temple of Wadi es-Sebua. Exca- 
vations in the past cleared only the avenue 
lined with sphinxes (the dromes). We 
know nothing of the entire front part of 
the sanctuary buried under the high 
waters of the Nile and which could provide 
information of the greatest importance. 
Some sections of the exterior wall are still 
visible, but no one has ever thought of 
surveying or exploring them. Thus with- 
out citing any other example, excavations 
will certainly yield major results as far as 
the study of religion is concerned. 
But even during the high-water season, 
archaeological work could very well yield 
excellent results. The research carried out 
on the two occasions when the height of 
the old dam was raised, laid bare a stran- 
gely refined yet primitive civilization, that

century A.D.: well-provided royal tombs,

ivory, pottery of all kinds, games, even 
completely accoutred horses. 
The Meroitic culture—the name comes 
from Meroe, the capital city of its kings, 
near Shendi—has brought to light many 
facts of which we had no inkling, in parti- 
cular the penetration of Greek influences 
in these somewhat remote regions of Afri- 
ca. Recently, in a Meroitic cemetery bor- 
dering the high waters, an Italian mission 
unearthed a copper bowl engraved with the 
image of a cow, of very fine workmanship. 
The same mission, last year, resumed exca- 
vations at Ikhmindi and had the luck to 
discover an inscription describing how the 
city was founded, in the Byzantine era. 
The German excavations at Amada have 
likewise been very encouraging. 
But there are still points in doubt. It 
is to these that attention should be drawn. 
Research that starts from reflexion may 
well lead to more interesting discoveries. 
Upper Nubia has many traces of the 
Middle Empire and the XVIIIth Dynasty 
whereas in Lower Nubia the remains date 
mostly from the XIXth Dynasty and the 
Graeco-Roman era. But we are convinced 
that, if the temples of Lower Nubia had 
been more carefully excavated, they would 
have yielded a larger number of ancient 
documents, 
There is an even more tantalizing ques- 
tion. The viceroys of Kush, who governed 
the country from the XVIIIth to the XXth 
Dynasty, seem to have resided at Aniba. 
But only one tomb of any importance has 
been found—that of Pennut. No necro- 
polis of viceroys. No residence. Yet 
these mighty chiefs of Egypt's African em- 
pire, would not have been satisfied with a 
mere house, however large. They must 
have had a palace. Funeral statuettes, 
called Oushebtis, of other viceroys, show 
that they had tombs, at least secondary 
ones, even if their bodies were brought 
back to Egypt. Where may we find these 
vestiges of the Egyptian occupation of the 
country in remote antiquity? 
These are the kind of questions excava- 
tion expeditions will have to find answers 
to. We hope they succeed before the great 
sheet of water submerges Nubia forever.

stone for the Philae temples. The guild of agents, known os the 
“gomos,” which was responsible for the transport of the stones, had its 
priests and dignitaries who made a point of engraving their names on 
the tablets cut into the facade of the speos. At Abu Duruah, about 
three miles to the east of Dakka, we find proscynemata dating from the 
time of Antoninus Pius (middle of second century A.D.), proving that this 
rock shrine with its Pharaonic decoration, far from having fallen into 
disuse, was a centre of worship for the god Min and Hermes Peithnuphis. 
All these texts shed a great deal of light on the life of the Roman 
garrisons, their composition and dates and the cults they practised. 
The material already available proves that Nubia, for all its aridity, 
played a not inconsiderable role in antiquity. To begin with, from the 
military point of view, the region was both a bastion of defence and 
an operational base. Then, from the economic standpoint, hunting must 
50 
have flourished, as indicated by the many names of elephant and bird 
hunters to be seen at Abu Simbel, and by the engravings at Jebel Abu 
Duruah, representing giraffes, oryxes, ostriches and buffalo. 
Down the Nile sailed convoys loaded with the treasures or the gold mines 
at Wadi Allaki, facing Dakka, or white stones quarried at Kertassi. 
Viticulture and the use of sakieh or water wheel, of which there is 
evidence in Nubia, bear witness to the flourishing state of agriculture. 
Lastly, from the religious point of view, the Nubian gods went to swell 
the Graeco-Roman pantheon. It was in the first and second centuries 
A.D. that Philae reached the pinnacle of its glory with the construction 
of the gateways of Augustus and Tiberius and the Trajan kiosk. 
And so Nubia, from the days of antiquity, has stood os an exomple 
and a token of what man can achieve when his toil and ingenuity are’ 
pitted against the elements and an unfriendly climate. The Greeks ond 
Romans sought, in ancient Nubia, to convert a barren, thankless region, 
doomed, it might have seemed, to everlasting poverty, into a source of 
spiritual and material wealth, strength and pride—a goal that is still 
being pursued by the architects of modern Nubia.
