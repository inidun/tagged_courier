from natural catastrophes or the horrors of war in search 
of food, shelter and peace. The human sediments left by the great

refugees from terror, impoverished victims of hard times or sys-

gain as simply to find a job of any kind, naturally look towards 
the industrialized countries (where they are assigned tasks which 
workers in these countries are loath to perform). Legal or illegal

country. They live between two cultures, subject to controls which 
may be legal or arbitrary, sometimes victims of discrimination,

The following article reviews some of 
the main trends in international 
migration and in policies relating to 
them in the decade following 1974 when 
a World Population Plan of Action was 
adopted at the World Population 
Conference organized by the United 
Nations and held in Bucharest 
(Romania). It focuses attention on 
migrations of labour, illegal or 
undocumented migration, refugee 
movements and migration for permanent 
resettlement. The article has been 
extracted from a United Nations study 
prepared in connexion with the 
International Conference on Population, 
1984. 
recruitment of foreign workers by the 
industrialized market-economy coun- 
tries, which was only incipient in 1974, has 
continued, leading to a net reduction in 
the size of the foreign labour force still 
present in the main labour-importing coun- 
tries, from some 6.5 million foreign work- 
ers in 1974 to 6.2 million around 1980. 
Since in many of the receiving countries 
of Europe children born of foreign parents 
are considered non-nationals, even in the 
absence of net immigration an increase in 
the foreign population would be expected 
because of natural increase. Yet the net 
gain recorded falls short of natural 
increase, implying that net emigration has 
occurred, probably in the form of return 
migration to the countries of origin. 
At present, most of the receiving coun- 
tries still claim not to be countries of immi- 
gration for permanent resettlement. Their 
policies are aimed, inter alia, at stabilizing 
the size of the foreign population in their 
territories and at ensuring a certain degree 
of integration between the foreign minor- 
ities and the national majority, while at 
the same time allowing the former to keep 
their cultural identity, 
Stabilization is to be achieved by pro- 
moting the voluntary return to the sending 
countries of foreign workers and their 
dependents and by the naturalization of 
those who are well adapted to their new 
environment. Integration is to be pro- 
moted, inter alia, by ensuring parity 
between foreigners and nationals in such 
fields as terms of employment, social and 
health services, and housing, by providing 
special training (notably in the local lan- 
guage) for workers and their dependents, 
by combatting discrimination and pre- 
judice against foreigners and by creating 
an environment conducive to the normal 
development of family life. 
Hence, measures related to family re- 
union and to the education, training and 
employment opportunities of dependents 
of foreign workers are key elements in the 
promotion of integration. Yet, although 
immigration for the purpose of family re- 
unification is allowed by all the former 
labour-importing countries, it is still sub- 
ject to a number of restrictions and, in 
general, work permits for spouses and 
older children are not easily available.

Migrant workers: a 
In contrast with the evolution of immi- 
gration in Europe since 1974, the oil- 
exporting countries of Western Asia and 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya continued to 
admit sizeable numbers of foreign workers 
at least up to 1980. It has been estimated 
that between 1975 and 1980 the total num- 
ber of foreign workers in the main labour- 
importing countries of the region increased 
from 1.8 to 2.8 million. The total foreign 
population in those countries was esti- 
mated to be 3.5 million in 1975 and is likely 
to have increased less rapidly than the 
number of foreign workers since then. 
Given the relatively small size of the 
national populations of the Western Asian 
labour-importing countries, although the 
total number of foreign workers present 
in their territories is smaller than that in 
Europe, it often constitutes a very large *- 
proportion of the local labour force. Partly 
for thisreason, in recent years the receiving 
countries have tended to adopt measures 
that regulate immigration and labour 
recruitment more strictly, that discourage 
the immigration of family dependents and 
that enforce, as much as possible, the rota- 
tion of labour. These measures include the 
promotion of such novel labour-importing 
mechanisms as the so-called “turn-key 
project” by which a foreign company, con- 
tracted to carry out a certain project, pro- 
vides every input, including the manpower. 
Lastly, although data for more recent 
periods are not yet available, it is likely 
that the oil glut experienced by the world 
economy since 1982 and the ensuing 
decline in oil prices may have had a neg- 
ative effect on immigration levels to West- 
ern Asia. :

### 65864: Migrant workers: a world phenomenon

  
world phenomenon 
In Africa, available evidence suggests 
that seasonal migration is relatively more 
common in Western Africa than in other 
sub-regions and that the Ivory Coast, the 
Gambia and Senegal continue to attract 
migrants from neighbouring countries, 
among which Chad, Ghana, Mali, Togo 
and Burkina Faso appear to be the main 
sources of emigrants. 
Labour migration is also characteristic 
of the southern region, where short-term 
movements (of six to eighteen months 
duration) of young males to the mines and 
industrial complexes of South Africa (and 
until the mid-1970s to Zambia and Zim- 
babwe) predominate. Yet the level of 
labour migration to South Africa has 
declined substantially during the last dec- 
ade, falling from an annual intake of some 
300,000 foreign workers in 1970 to less than 
200,000 in 1981. Foreign workers in South 
Africa are recruited under agreements 
between the employing organization and the 
Governments of supplying countries, their 
repatriation is assured upon completion of 
the contract period, and while in the Repub- 
lic they are forbidden to change place of 
-residence or employment. 
In terms of policies, few African coun- 
tries have recognized explicitly a need for 
foreign labour and even less have adopted 
measures to promote actively the immi- 
gration of foreign workers. In fact, many 
countries have expressed the desire to 
become self-sufficient in terms of labour 
needs, especially in regard to skilled per- 
sonnel. Yet, as long as needed skills remain 
scarce, most countries are willing to allow 
the temporary presence of foreigners hav- 
ing those skills.

Although Canada and the United States 
are better known as countries admitting 
permanent immigrants than as importers 
of foreign labour, they nevertheless admit 
considerable numbers of persons for tem- 
porary employment. Thus, during 1976- 
1979, the United States admitted an annual 
average of some 91,000 temporary work- 
ers, trainees and exchange visitors (a figure 
that excludes all immigrants admitted as 
permanent residents) and in 1981 Canada 
reported that it had granted about 113,000 
“work permits, 84,000 valid for less than 
a year. 
In other parts of the continent, legally 
sanctioned labour migration is the excep- 
tion rather than the rule. Very few coun- 
tries have policies that actively promote 
the immigration of labour. During the 
1970s, Venezuela admitted a significant 
number of migrants for employment, while 
the Dominican Republic served as host to 
many temporary workers from neigh- 
bouring Haiti. Yet, most of these legally 
sanctioned flows were accompanied by par- 
allel flows of clandestine migration. 
No region of the world is exempt from 
illegal or undocumented immigration. Eco- 
nomic disparities between countries, cou- 
pled with the general tendency of receiving 
States to restrict the possibilities for legal 
migration have often given rise to migra- 
tion flows that are not legally sanctioned 
by the receiving countries. In the context 
of the existing world order, where only 
relatively few countries still encourage or 
allow immigration, illegal movements are 
likely to continue. 
In the Americas, labour migration flows 
of considerable magnitude occur, largely 
without the explicit approval of the receiv- 
ing States. Illegal or undocumented migra- 
tion is typical of this region. Although 
there is little solid evidence on the mag- 
nitude of these flows, it seems likely that 
they have increased during the past dec- 
ade. Countries such as Argentina, Canada, 
Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Pan- 
ama, Venezuela and the United States 
have all been known to be the destination 
of sizeable numbers of undocumented 
migrants who originate in an ever more 
varied set of countries. 
The policies adopted by countries in this 
region to cope with illegal immigration 
cover the full range from laissez-faire to »

### 65864: Migrant workers: a world phenomenon

» the adoption of regularization drives that 
aim at legalizing the status of the migrants 
concerned. Deportation or the “voluntary 
return” of illegal migrants is the typical 
mechanism used to control migration, 
although some countries have also adopted 
stricter border controls or stiffer employ- 
ers’ sanctions to deter the further illegal 
influx of migrants for employment. 
Undocumented immigrants are also 
common in Europe, where the restrictive 
admission policies adopted since 1973 have 
led many job seekers either to enter a coun- 
try illegally or to enter it legally and accept 
employment illegally. In order to control 
illegal immigration and prevent its con- 
tinued increase, the former labour-import- 
ing countries have resorted to a wide vari- 
ety of measures, including more careful 
border controls, stricter admission require- 
ments, steeper penalties for traffickers and 
employers of illegal immigrants, and regu- 
larization schemes. 
It is now impossible to assess reliably 
either the success of these measures or the 
current size of the illegal population. It 
must be noted, however, that immigrants 
whose status is not legal are not only pres- 
ent in the former labour-importing coun- 
tries, but also in the traditional countries 
of emigration. Thus, Greece, Italy and 
Spain have reported that they are hosting 
substantial illegal populations, a situation 
that aggravates the problems these nations 
face in reintegrating their own returning 
citizens. 
Undocumented aliens are also known 
to exist in many of the labour-importing 
countries of Western Asia, where migrants 
have been attracted by better economic 
opportunities. In other parts of Asia, eco- 
nomically prosperous States or areas, such 
as Hong Kong and Singapore, have also 
acted as magnets for illegal flows, while 
in certain regions of India economic and 
political motivations have led to the exist- 
ence of large populations of migrants 
whose legal status is now clear. 
In Africa, the relatively recent estab- 
lishment of sovereign States whose bound- 
aries do not always coincide with tradi- 
tional ethnic divisions has often led to 
undocumented flows of persons arising 
from what used to be traditionally 
unimpeded population movements. In gen- 
eral, policy responses to these movements 
have been liberal and migrants have been 
able to stay and work in the receiving coun- 
try. However, in recent years some States 
have resorted to deportation measures that 
often contravene basic human rights. 
The importance of refugee movements 
has increased considerably during the past 
decade, partly because of the growing 
number of both countries and persons 
involved and partly owing to the political 
ramifications of these movements. While 
in 1974 the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) reported that there were 
slightly more than 1.8 million refugees in 
the world (excluding Palestinians), by the 
end of 1981 this number had risen to nearly 
6.8 million (again not counting the nearly 
1.9 million Palestinians overseen by the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East 
(UNRWA)). 
Given the nature of refugee movements, 
the figures quoted are only approximate, 
but they nevertheless indicate orders of 
magnitude. In fact, the 1981 figure 
excludes nearly two million refugees who 
have been permanently resettled in third 
asylum countries and the many others who 
have been successfully repatriated to their 
home countries. Despite the considerable 
effort made by developed countries in 
resettling refugees, the vast majority are 
still being hosted by developing countries 
which are commonly the countries of first 
asylum. In Africa alone, the number of 
refugees increased from one to nearly three 
million between 1974 and 1981, while in 
Southeastern Asia by the end of 1981 there 
still remained about 3 million refugees 
awaiting resettlement in third countries. 
In general, the policies adopted by Gov- 
ernments to deal with refugees have been 
strongly shaped by humanitarian consid- 
erations. In response to the growing num- 
ber of refugees world-wide, many devel- 
oped countries have made special efforts 
to increase their refugee intake. However, 
since most of these countries have rarely 
received direct refugee arrivals, their posi- 
tion as third countries of asylum has - 
allowed them to select refugees for admis- 
sion, with the result that the criteria on 
family reunification and skills used in the 
selection have been detrimental to the 
resettlement chances of the vast majority 
of refugees who lack family ties in the 
developed world and are mostly unskilled. 
Countries receiving large numbers of 
refugees directly have resorted mainly to 
two types of strategy: (a) the creation of 
“temporary” refugee camps whose basic 
necessities are satisfied with the help of 
the international community and (b) the

resettlement of refugees in rural areas 
where they are provided with land and are 
encouraged to become self-sufficient. 
International aid has also been sought in 
the latter case so as to integrate the refugee 
in the overall development process. Reset- 
tlement strategies have been common in 
Africa, while temporary refugee camps are 
typical of Southeastern Asia, a region that 
has been the main source of refugees for 
resettlement in third countries. 
The role played by the United Nations 
system in providing aid, safeguarding the 
physical safety and basic rights of refugees, 
and working towards permanent solutions 
to their plight cannot be overstressed. 
UNHCR has been successful not only in 
eliciting support for resettlement pro- 
grammes, but also in aiding the many thou- 
sands of refugees for whom voluntary repa- 
triation has been possible. The support of 
the international community for the activ- 
ities of the United Nations system in regard 
to refugees testifies to the importance of 
these activities and highlights their con- 
tinued necessity. 
Finally, regarding migration for per- 
manent resettlement, mention must be 
made of the recent trends in migration to 
and from the traditional countries of immi- 
 
gration: Australia, Canada, New Zealand 
and the United States. During the decade 
1971-1981, only in the United States did 
immigration levels grow steadily (largely 
because of the admission towards the end 
of the decade of sizeable numbers of ref- 
ugees, an immigration category that is not 
yet subject to quotas). 
The recent adoption by Australia, Can- 
ada and New Zealand of new immigration 
laws that allow a better adaptation of immi- 
gration levels to national needs led to a 
reduction in the number of admissions, in 
spite of the larger intake of refugees that 
they all approved. In fact, the data on 
emigration from New Zealand reveal that 
the country experienced a negative migra- 
tion rate during 1976-1980. These devel- 
opments suggest that, in terms of the tra- 
ditional countries of migration, the number 
of places available for future migrants are 
not likely to increase. |

### 65865: A Challenge for the schools

A challenge for the schools 
HE place where, essentially and his- 
torically, necessary change occurs 
is the school. That is where migrant 
children are subjected to their crucial first 
experience of adjustment to a different 
culture and, conversely, where the children 
of the host country come into contact with 
their otherness and their differences, which 
prompts them to reconsider and to under- 
stand their own culture. 
Many conflicts can arise in the migrant 
child as a result of minority practices that 
can identify him and make him visible as 
a member of another community (clothing, 
diet, personal background, etc.). Unfor- 
tunately, certain underlying cultural 
assumptions will then act as kinds of ‘‘basic 
concepts’, axiomatizing images of the 
world, codes and conventions that are leg- 
itimated by family consensuses and per- 
ceived by the child as being at variance 
with the very rules, implicit or explicit, of 
the school, itself the expression of a major- 
ity consensus. 
But the school is not only the “reflec- 
tion” of a national consensus; it also aims 
actively to integrate and cast all children 
  
     
by Georges Vignaux 
in the same mould. Thus, inevitably, there 
is often not so much ignorance as rejection 
of their differences. 
Yet each of us, each child, needs these 
personal and collective differences, if only 
to locate and perhaps dedramatize his posi- 
tion on a continuum of images, stereotypes 
and prejudices ranging from the nearest 
to the most remote. Thus those relegated 
to the fringes of society draw upon people’s 
attitudes to social relegation—their own 
and those of others. All these attitudes can 
only serve to widen the gap between how 
the child perceives his social status and how 
he experiences his cultural identity. Thus 
school can serve as much to materialize 
these exclusions, by giving them form and 
typology, as to relativize them. This can 
happen on two general levels: those of 
expression and guidance. 
Young Swedes and the children of Turk- 
ish migrant workers learn carpentry in a 
school at Géteborg, Sweden. 
The acquisition of expression involves 
first of all the forced learning of a dominant 
rhetoric, that of the host country and its 
language, which is the language of know- 
ledge since all subjects will be taught in 
it. Very early on, therefore, the migrant 
child comes to compare two languages: 
that of the school and that of the family, 
the latter being necessarily diminished in 
value relative to the former. In a great 
many cases this linguistic handicap will be 
further aggravated by the absence of family 
support. If the migrant child succeeds in 
overcoming it, he will have to pay the price 
in terms of a rift between himself and the 
family cultural environment, which he will 
now regard as being antagonistic towards 
the surrounding model. 
With regard to guidance, as a result of 
the standards applied in the school (age- 
limits, “backwardness”, so-called special- 
ist courses etc.), even the best intentions 
in the world can turn out to be terribly 
selective here. Teachers and counsellors 
often arrive at a certain, perception of the 
family and social environment which will 
lead them to treat the children as special

### 65865: A Challenge for the schools

In a class comprising 30 per cent of immi- 
grant children in a co-educational State 
school at La Seyne-sur-Mer In the south 
of France, an experiment was carried out 
in 1983 to foster greater mutual under- 
standing among the children and to 
encourage the young North Africans to 
take greater pride in the achievements of 
Arabic culture and language. Combining 
imaginary and real-life incidents, the 
pupils wrote a story about their town 
in French and Arabic and illustrated it 
with their own drawings and photos. 
cases. As they are moved from one course 
to another and from one institution to 
another they will very soon be victims of 
relegation, this time to the educational and 
administrative fringe. 
Thus for the migrant child school proves 
to be essentially a place where differences 
are recognized, distinctions are drawn and 
exclusion occurs. The selection systems it 
involves rely on explanations and, con- 
versely, these explanatory systems, which 
are gradually internalized by the children 
concerned, will further the development 
in them of paradoxical processes of self 
selection and self-elimination (“I am not 
good at school because I am different...and 
the same applies socially...”).

can thus be sealed as a result of the subtle 
processes whereby they are transferred to 
specialist courses, vocational or not, and 
their concentration in certain establish- 
ments. Their place of education is as much 
a reflection as a result of their physical 
location within society (overcrowded 
schools in some urban areas). Thus it might 
even be claimed that the environment is 
fully responsible for under-achievement, 
thereby ignoring the ill-preparedness of 
teachers for the intercultural problems con- 
fronting them. 
Every educational institution is based on 
a profound élitism which can only lead to 
the exclusion of a substantial percentage 
of pupils. This fate is, of course, also that 
of children from the under-privileged sec- 
tions of the host society, but the con- 
sequences are necessarily more serious 
among migrant children in terms of the 
ways in which they perceive their own iden- 
tity. They will resent this selection more 
than others as a kind of social rejection, 
a return to the same jobs as their parents 
or, quite simply, as a sign that they are 
being consigned to the ranks of the unem- 
ployed. 
School, which they experience as a place 
of obligations and constraints, will soon 
seem alien and even hostile to them 
because they see it as leading them into 
a dead end symbolizing a society in which 
they cannot see their place. Academic fail- 
ure thus reflects a more general social fail- 
ure generating strategies of despair. 
Cultural dysfunctions gradually engen- 
der social maladjustment. ‘Illegitimate 
offspring” of a society in which they believe 
they have no place, from countries which 
are no longer theirs, these migrant children 
will then demand the visibility they once 
feared. Their social dis-identification leads 
them necessarily to adopt more conspic- 
uous fringe behaviour patterns (formation 
of minority groups) or to re-identify with 
a mythical native culture which will never

be that of the family. Symbolic crises 
develop as ethnic aspirations grow. These 
crises express a search for strategies of self- 
improvement and self-justification as much 
as they reflect the failure of integration in 
a school environment which is not -pre- 
pared to receive these children with the 
respect that they and their families want. 
The answer lies in educational diver- 
sification. Various kinds of culture-based 
or technology-based courses designed to 
be equivalent must be grafted onto a com- 
mon core of basic education. The present 
mistake of selective streaming, inevitably 
leading to failure at school and in society, 
must not be repeated. Hence the impor- 
tance of a cultural re-moulding of ele- 
mentary and pre-elementary education. 
Teacher training, analysis and thinking 
about methods must concentrate on these 
points. All children, not only immigrants, 
must be offered common educational facil- 
ities that will provide them with freedom 
of choice later on. Recognition of cultural 
diversity also implies recognition of dif- 
ferences in rates of progress and adjust- 
ment and hence a re-evaluation of present 
modes of enforced ‘hierarchization” 
between types of teaching and curricula. 
  
  
It is thus important that all children 
should enjoy a free interplay of linguistic 
expression which is crucial to cognitive, 
intellectual and, particularly, technical 
development. In this sense, the establish- 
ment of conditions to ensure respect and 
understanding not only between cultures 
but also between modes of expression in 
language, literature and technology, must 
go hand in hand with efforts to define and 
develop intercultural education. 
No culture can be identified with a closed 
system of values and behaviour, even if 
it is necessary, at certain stages of history, 
for it to act as if this were the case. On 
the contrary, all cultures can only be nour- 
ished by contact with others that are close 
and by contrast with those that are distant. 
Schools can help to promote understanding 
of this “natural” living process. This is, 
perhaps, one of their fundamental roles.

### 65866: City lights: the impact of rural-urban migration

  
City lights 
The impact of rural-urban migration 
HE phenomenon of migration is a 
major factor in social change. It 
affects not only those places that 
receive migrants, but also those that send 
them. In one type of migration, a member 
of the family migrates temporarily to a 
different place, moves between the place 
of origin and the place of migration, and 
treats the former as the reference point 
to which he ultimately plans to return. 
Migration from a rural to an urban area, 
which is usually motivated by the need to 
find work, makes heavy demands on the 
members of the family back home. It 
means that women have to undertake cer- 
tain tasks they did not previously perform 
and thus involves a rearrangement of the 
family time-table. It influences the social- 
ization pattern of children and may result 
in a series of psychological problems. It 
affects social life within the family as well 
as relations outside. 
The effect of these changes varies from 
family to family and from culture to cul- 
ture. Response to male migration is dif- 
ferent in families in which the son has 
En route for the city. For rural populations 
the great urban centres hold a natural 
attraction which is magnified by the 
hope—sometimes justified—that in the 
city their menfolk will find work enabling 
them to improve the living standards of 
the families they leave behind. 
= 
migrated from those in which the father 
has migrated. In families in which the 
migrant has the dual status of son and hus- 
band the impact of his migration is felt 
differently. 
A cross-cultural study of migration has 
indicated that migration increases family 
income, raises the standard of living some- 
what and adds in varying proportions to 
the responsibilities of female family mem- 
bers. Some urban elements enter into the 
inventory of the material culture of the 
home. 
Contrary to common belief, migration 
and exposure to modernity may serve to 
cement the bonds of kinship and to rein- 
force tradition. It is through the network 
of kinship that people move into the city 
and, once there, they continue to move 
in the kinship and village circle. Back 
home, the degree of dependence on kins- 
men increases with the departure of the 
male to the town. The authority structure 
changes very little; the patriarchal ethos 
is pervasive. Family reunions generally 
coincide with religious festivals and cer- 
emonial occasions and it is still the husband 
who takes major decisions or gives the seal 
of his approval, and in his absence the 
other senior male members of the family 
act as guardians. 
Such a situation is understandable since 
migration is a temporary phenomenon that 
requires only ad hoc arrangements. These 
are all withdrawn with the return to “‘nor- 
mality”’. However, such migration exposes 
women to a wider world of work and expe- 
rience in the management of household 
affairs that are in normal circumstances 
looked after by men. Longer periods of 
absence of husbands create a situation in 
which women begin to assume greater 
responsibilities and take decisions on mat- 
ters that cannot wait. 
This said, the fact remains that men do 
not migrate to improve the status of 
women. They do it for the overall improve- 
ment of the family’s standard of living and 
to enhance its status within the traditional 
structure. Seen in terms of long-term con- 
sequences, the suffering due to separation 
caused by migration is actually an invest- 
ment made by the parents to provide a 
better future for their children. The status 
of the parents may not change much, but 
their sons may have an education, and thus 
get a better job, and their daughters may 
marry well.

### 65866: City lights: the impact of rural-urban migration

by Yogesh Atal 
Migration to metropolitan centres causes 
problems both in the cities and in the fam- 
ilies that remain in the village. It does not 
immediately affect the status of migrants. 
Realizing this and also accepting the inev- 
itability of the pulls and pushes that lead 
ineluctably to migration, we need to devise 
a suitable strategy to channel the move- 
ment of men. Studies carried out so far 
suggest that we should think more about 
the desirability of providing incentives 
which would keep people in the rural areas, 
such as the development of large villages 
or small towns to which people could 
move, but without moving very far. The 
process would become decentralized with 
suitable infrastructures being established 
in the various regions of a country to ensure 
the balanced economic growth necessary 
for the elimination of rural poverty. WH

### 65871: A UNESCO approach to international migration

A Unesco approach 
to international migration " 
by Ronald G. Parris: 
whether permanent, temporary or sea- 
sonal, legal or illegal, organized or 
spontaneous, is inherently characterized by 
varying levels of confrontation between 
different social systems and cultural tra- 
ditions and has occurred within differing 
historical and structural contexts (reli- 
gious, political, economic, the result of war 
and natural disasters). 
These phenomena have long received 
the attention of Unesco, beginning as early 
as 1949 with studies ranging from the ques- 
tion of cultural assimilation and the edu- 
cation and training of migrant workers and 
their families to the problems associated 
with their return and re-adaptation to their 
countries of origin. 
Resolution 1.142, adopted at the Seven- 
teenth Session of the General Conference 
in 1972, called upon Unesco to launch a 
specific programme of action on behalf of 
migrant workers and their children. Activ- 
ities undertaken to implement this reso- 
lution have included studies of the various 
dimensions of migration, wide dissemi- 
nation of their results and the sponsoring 
of Meetings of Experts to evaluate these 
research findings and to offer recommen- 
| [iy migration, dations for the attention of Member States. 
The major orientation of these actions 
has been that migration should be con- 
sidered not simply as a labour problem but 
as a social, cultural and political process 
of intricate dimensions. One practical 
objective remains that of encouraging 
States to choose and implement appro- 
priate policies in the economic as well as 
political and cultural domains that could 
lead to the definition of a genuine charter 
for immigrants. Such a charter could be 
based on the principle of equality of treat- 
ment of immigrants with the local pop- 
ulation, while recognizing the relevance of 
making particular distinctions, where spe- 
cific needs exist (for example, language and 
skills training) and the importance of the 
formation and protection of the cultural

More recent Unesco programme activ- 
ities have focused on the education and 
training of immigrants and the impact of 
migration on the social structures of 
selected countries, particularly on racial- 
ethnic relations. Research has also been 
undertaken on the patterns and conse- 
quences of rural-urban migration in Africa, 
Asia and Latin America and the mech- 
anisms of adaptation of migrant workers 
to urban life, 
In his everyday life, the experience of 
the migrant worker is generally one of cul- 
tural alienation, isolation, ambivalence 
and rejection, which forces him into social 
universes that are generally disconnected 
and conflictual. The migrant worker is in 
a ‘“nomansland, which is neither that of 
his country of origin nor that of his country 
of employment,” resulting often in the des- 
tructuring of the very family group and 
immigrant community that he needs to 
sustain him. Everyday life is typically orga- 
nized around two poles: his family and 
fellow countrymen, in a cultural environ- 
ment resembling or at least drawing on 
elements of the culture of the country of p

guage tools: the mother tongue, which pri- 
marily serves him for private use with fam- 
ily and friends (“language of affect”) and 
a specialized administrative language of the 
country of employment, devoid of affective 
connotation and representing “the lan- 
guage of power or domination.” Inter- 
related with this linguistic dichotomy is the 
division of his daily life into two discon- 
nected universes: the universe of work and 
that of the cultural ghetto. 
The isolation and alienation identifiable 
in the general migrant population assume 
even more significance when female 
migrants are considered. Sex differences, 
rather than obscuring the alienation the 
migrant experiences qua migrant, tend to 
exacerbate the problems of cultural adap- 
tation female migrants have to overcome.

the productive functions of female 
migrants constitute the core elements of 
their experiences in the countries of 
employment and represent the context for 
assessing the effects of migration on their 
identity, status and cultural behaviour both 
inside the family and in the world of work. 
The socio-cultural conditions encoun- 
tered by migrant workers and their families 
and the patterns of migratory flows them- 
selves take as a point of departure the 
international economic, political and 
demographic structures that generate 
them. These factors include, in particular, 
the demand in the more industrialized 
countries for cheap manpower and the 
need of the labour-surplus countries to sell 
their labour power. Deteriorating demo- 
graphic patterns in some of the more indus- 
trialized countries also play a role. 
It is also important to consider the par- 
ticular terms and conditions of recruitment 
and employment of migrant workers (for 
example, organized bilateral agreements, 
spontaneous undocumented movements), 
 
Two young Mexican women illegally cross 
the Rio Grande del Norte (or Rio Bravo), 
which forms the frontier with the United 
States, between Ciudad Judrez in Mexico 
and El Paso, Texas. 
for these too play a role in the socio- 
cultural experiences of migrant workers 
and their families, including their access 
to the institutions and services of the 
receiving countries. 
For these reasons, the approach to the 
problem of migration must be holistic. The 
situation of the migrant worker must be 
considered in its various dimensions, for 
his culture, education and training are all 
interrelated with the economic and polit- 
ical factors affecting his labour or employ- 
ment, and these, in turn, should be ref- 
erenced to the racial-ethnic and class 
systems of the receiving countries. It is 
necessary to keep in mind the effects of 
his presence on these systems and the prac- 
tices and policies employed which, by 
design or chance, keep him in a state of 
economic domination and cultural limbo. 
And when considering the problem at the 
level of the economy, it could be asserted 
that migration, whether spontaneous or 
organized, fails to correct the underlying 
weaknesses of the socio-economic struc- 
tures of either the receiving countries or 
the countries of origin, while remaining 
a structural component of the world 
economy. 
Institutional discrimination, racial and 
ethnic prejudice are common features of 
the societies to which the migrants go. 
Racial and ethnic prejudice is often mani- 
fest in the terms and conditions of entry 
and in official immigration policies, in the 
daily practices on the job and in the class- 
room and in indigenous attitudes and daily 
contacts between migrant workers and the 
local population. In some cases, racial 
strains lead to racial violence. The migrant 
worker, at first an economic object, soon 
becomes a racial-ethnic object. 
Leaders in the receiving countries, who 
declare themselves in favour of immigra- 
tion, so long as it is limited to certain coun- 
tries of origin, or in favour of extending 
civic rights and privileges only to those 
immigrants whose ‘‘cultural traditions” 
more resemble or are more likely to be 
compatible with their own, hence making 
these immigrants more assimilable, are, 
like the more direct opponents of coloured 
immigration, declaring a case for racism. 
Under present conditions of economic 
crisis and unemployment, many receiving 
countries re-define the presence of immi-

grants and migrant workers as threatening 
the livelihood and survival of the indig- 
enous population or even as an explanation 
for the economic ills themselves. Greater 
social controls are usually demanded, 
including calls for their expulsion and 
repatriation. 
Examples abound everywhere. Recent 
official policy in Nigeria, after the falling 
off of oil revenues, has been that of forcible 
expulsion of immigrants, particularly illicit 
workers. In France, a political party has 
been consolidating its political position by 
associating immigration with unemploy- 
ment, provoking a vigorous response in 
the form of an anti-racist movement mobi- 
lized under the fraternal slogan “Touche 
pas a mon pote” (“Don’t touch my pal”) 
which has been relatively successful in cap- 
turing the attention of public opinion and 
articulating the opposition of diverse 
groups opposed to racism and the scape- 
goating of immigrants. The response of 
Asian and Caribbean immigrants in Britain 
to racial violence and discrimination has 
been increased collective organization and 
participation at the community level as well 
as a marked involvement in trade union 
activities. 
Finally, what then is the legal status of 
immigrants and migrant workers in the 
countries of employment? This is a prob- 
lem with which Unesco has also been con- 
cerned. Experience has shown that like 
their socio-economic status, their legal sta- 
tus is generally precarious, often depend- 
ing on the discretionary powers of the 
administrative authorities. Their legal sta- 
tus could be subjected to reassessment dur- 
ing periods of economic downturn. 
This has been the case, for example, with 
Asian and Carribean immigrants in Brit- 
ain, where a series of Immigration Acts 
beginning with the Commonwealth Immi- 
gration Act, 1962, have strictly circum- 
scribed the conditions of entry and also 
the right of admission of family depend- 
ents, including spouses. This is true also 
for some of the labour-importing countries 
in West Asia, which have instituted their 
own measures of control. The extension 
of civic rights to immigrants is closely 
guarded. The right, for example, to vote 
remains a controversial point of issue in 
several of the receiving countries. [|

The first and most important is in West 
Africa, where in nine countries about 2.8 mil- 
lion people were living outside their country 
of birth in 1975. Long-distance migration in 
West Africa has a lengthy history, beginning 
with the movement of entire villages or clans 
to avoid war or famine. Later, colonists 
brought labourers, often by force, to Ghana 
and the Ivory Coast. Now unequal job oppor- 
tunities within the region, drought, and the 
open-border policies of most countries sus- 
tain voluntary migration. Moreover, with birth- 
rates now above 45 per 1,000 in all West 
Africa, the number of migrants is likely to 
grow. Return migration and circulation 
among countries is common.

Most of the migrants come from rural areas 
and the lower-income, land-locked countries 
such as Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) 
and Mali. In 1975 as much as 17 per cent 
of the population of Burkina Faso was living 
elsewhere. The destinations of the migrants 
have changed over the last three decades, 
depending on the relative prosperity of the 
coastal regions and on their immigration pol- 
icies. Ghana, the most popular destination 
in the late 1950s and early 1960s, gave way

The other, much smaller migration flow in 
sub-Saharan Africa is into South Africa. For 
nearly a century mines in South Africa have 
recruited workers on short-term contracts 
from neighbouring countries. The flow of 
international migrants amounts to about 
250,000 a year, and recently the number has 
remained fairly constant. The origin of the 
migrants has changed, however, with fewer 
coming from Malawi and Mozambique and 
more from Botswana, Lesotho and Swazi- 
land. [|

### 65920: The Dilemma of the North African worker: France

  
BETWEEN TWO CULTURES 
France 
The dilemma of the North 
African worker 
MMIGRATION from North Africa to 
France is nothing new; it started with 
the men who came to fight with the 
French forces in the First World War. But 
the biggest influx took place more recently 
and dates back some thirty or forty years. 
Most of the immigrants came after the 
Second World War, to help rebuild the 
French economy. They provided man- 
power that was plentiful, adaptable and 
cheap; the problem of social and cultural 
adaptation did not arise. 
Neither they nor their French hosts 
envisaged long-term coexistence. The 
French economy was interested in these 
men and women solely as a source of 
labour, and the immigrants intended to go 
back home as soon as they had saved 
enough to give their families, which most 
of them had left behind, a better life. 
- Today this may still be the case for some 
600,000 immigrants whose families have 
remained in their country of origin. But 
for the majority, the situation is no longer 
entirely the same, even though most of 
them have not abandoned the idea of going 
back one day. 
In fact a number of recent developments 
are causing immigrants from North Africa 
to reconsider the question of going home. 
As a result of the economic crisis they are 
victims of unemployment. The current dif- 
ficulties on the labour market are hitting 
them harder than the indigenous popu- 
lation or even other immigrant groups. 
by Abdallah Buhamidi 
Except when the work to be done is 
arduous, dangerous or dirty, immigrant 
workers are the last to be hired. However, 
when firms run into difficulties, reorganize, 
and decide to reduce their workforce, they 
are also the first to be fired, unless they 
are offered the chance of taking early 
retirement, possibly accompanied by a 
financial inducement to return to their 
country of origin. 
For the present crisis is not merely short- 
term or cyclic. It affects the country’s eco- 
nomic structures, which are having to be 
adapted to meet the demands of foreign 
competition. The necessary modernization 
calls for technological competence of the 
highest order. The days of unskilled 
labour, however cheap, are over. 
Furthermore, many of the first arrivals 
have now reached the age of retirement 
(early or otherwise), and for them the 
problem of going back home is com- 
pounded by the question of their children 
and their children’s future. For the fact 
is that, although many have never aban- 
doned the idea of returning home, they 
have always postponed it until their chil- 
dren—who were either born in France or 
came as soon as their father was in a posi- 
tion to give them a home—finished their 
education. 
As they grew up in France, these chil- 
dren acquired attitudes, modes of thought 
and a way of life that have made most of 
them foreigners in their country of origin, 
to which they would find it extremely dif- 
ficult to adapt. The parents too, while they 
are foreigners in France, have also grad- 
ually become foreigners in their own coun- 
try. 
In such conditions, is it possible to go 
back? 
The experiences of people who have 
made the attempt are very instructive, 
although they are so recent that it is dif- 
ficult to draw any general conclusions from 
them. 
Readaptation to the country of origin 
is not a simple matter, either for those who 
have made a success of their return or for 
those who have encountered difficulties, 
especially since the “returnees” are often 
ill prepared for the situation. 
The most successful cases seem to be 
those who adapted best to life in France, 
where they acquired knowledge and voca- 
tional skills which made it easier for them 
to fit back into the social and working life 
of their country of origin. 
It has also been observed that the immi- 
grants’ children who have achieved the best 
results in French schools are those who 
have maintained the closest ties with their 
original culture and with the chief vehicles 
of that culture, their parents. The problem 
of the social and cultural adaptation in 
France of North African immigrants and 
their children is thus closely linked in a 
complex interaction with the problem of 
identity. 
The children of the Mekong 
quiet street in the Paris suburb of 
Asnieres. A sign above a door bears 
the unexpected words “Les Enfants 
du Mekong” (“The Children of the Mekong”). 
The house is a hostel inhabited by some 15 
young Asians aged between 16 and 20. Dur- 
ing working hours the hostel is empty; every- 
one is at a literacy class or at school. But 
in the evening or at mealtimes it is like being 
16 
in a big family, with Monsieur Péchard the 
director, whom everyone calls “uncle”, Oli- 
vier the group leader, who might be an older 
brother, and the Vietnamese mothers who 
do the cooking. 
“We organize a lot of sponsorship,” says 
Monsieur Péchard. “We give the sponsor the 
name of a child in a camp in Thailand and 
he agrees to send that child a small sum 
of money through us each month. It is also 
possible to sponsor a young person in 
France, like the young people in this hostel, 
either by paying for all or part of his keep 
or, preferably, welcoming him into the family 
at weekends or on holidays. All degrees of 
participation are possible.” 
In this way whole families are welcomed 
by specially formed groups, often in a parish, 
a movement of some kind, or a school. Some 
try to find housing for these families, others 
help them with scholastic formalities or teach 
French to those who have just arrived. A 
whole network of solidarity is being created 
in which each person does what he or she 
can. n

### 65920: The Dilemma of the North African worker: France

Painter Rachid Khimoune’s interest in 
Arabic calligraphy and geometric man- 
hoie cover designs has Inspired an un- 
usual artistic experiment. He makes casts 
of the covers and reproduces them on 
large canvases into which he incorpo- 
rates pages of writing. “The street is the 
immigrant’s iot,” he says. “I find the same 
arabesques there as i do In Musiim art.” 
Integration difficulties were a logical 
result of living in a community which was 
regarded solely as a source of labour and 
which was relegated to the fringes of the 
host society and its culture. Integration was 
not encouraged. Apart from these diffi- 
culties, the problem of the adaptation of 
North African workers was distorted by 
an enormous misunderstanding which tran- 
scended the simple question of adopting 
the laws and customs of the host country 
and which made any possible integration 
dependent on repudiation of one’s self. 
The values so dear to North African 
immigrants and their culture, perceived in 
France in terms of clichés divorced from 
the historical context common to the two 
shores of this part of the Mediterranean, 
had no chance of asserting themselves 
against those of the host country. 
The rejection of certain forms of expres- 
sion of this immigrant community has been 
attributed to the fact that Arab Muslim 
culture is very different from European 
culture. This explanation is not fully sat- 
isfactory, since in other circumstances the 
two cultures have several times proved to 
be fully complementary and perfectly com- 
patible. 
At a very early stage, the values of which 
the parents were the bearers were rejected 
not only by the host society but also by 
their own children, who attributed their 
difficulties to their cultural identity and 
therefore to their parents. 
Through the school and the acquisition 
of a working knowledge of the language,

“He is the son of immigrants, adrift 
between two cultures, two histories, and 
two languages... inventing his own roots, 
forming his own attachments,” wrote 
Algerian writer Mehdi Charef in his novei 
Le Thé au Harem d’Archi Ahmed, which 
he successfully adapted for the screen 
in 1984. Cuitural ambivalence can be a 
bitter experience for second-generation 
immigrants, banishing them to the fringe 
of two worlds, but it can also be a source 
of creativity. Novelist Leila Sebbar, above, 
is the daughter of an Algerian father and 
a French mother. She draws inspiration 
for her work in the confluence of two rich 
civilizations. 
even the less gifted children soon gained 
access to a code for understanding the host 
society which was a closed book for their 
parents, who thus lost their status as socio- 
cultural initiators—the basis of their 
authority and its “legitimacy”. 
Because of their ambiguous attitude to 
their own identity, the parents contributed 
involuntarily to the deterioration of their 
relations with their children. Anxious to 
resemble the dominant model through the 
educational and social success of their chil- 
dren, they overvalued that model to the 
detriment of their own cultural values, to 
which their children should have referred. 
Caught up in this contradiction, the chil- 
dren harboured a negative image of them- 
selves and linked this disparaged identity 
with their failure, which they saw as pre- 
ordained. This situation created conflict 
within the family and jeopardized its co- 
hesion as a group. The father was the first 
victim and then—by way of reaction— the 
children, who in such circumstances were 
bound to do badly at school. In these con- 
ditions many young people have rejected 
their culture of origin, while failing to 
acquire access to the host culture or to 
achieve the qualifications necessary to 
achieve a satisfying social and professional 
life, still less the integration dreamed of 
by their parents.

“In the past we thought of going back to 
Algeria one day. Now we know we’ll stay 
here,” says sculptor Mohand Amara. 
Going back was once the dream of many 
immigrants, but is it possible for. their 
chiidren? Many immigrants are only par- 
tially Integrated in the host society, but 
no ionger feel they beiong in their society 
of origin, which also regards them as out- 
sliders. 
The contribution made to.the French 
economy and culture by immigrants from 
North Africa has been far from negligible. 
Thanks to their constant comings and 
goings between the two shores of the Med- 
iterranean, North African immigrants have 
become an organic link between France 
and the Maghreb, participating in the com- 
merce between the two cultures. 
Through its contact with immigrant chil- 
dren, the French educational system is re- 
examining its methods in such a way that 
many French children, hitherto excluded 
because of their non-conformism from the 
traditional channels of knowledge and 
instruction, will certainly benefit. 
Mention should also be made of the 
growing number of writers and artists 
(especially musicians, painters and film- 
makers) whose specific modes of expres- 
sion are making a mark on French cultural 
‘trends. 
One of the greatest benefits which 
I France is reaping from the presence of 
North African immigrant workers is 
‘undoubtedly an awareness, still in its 
‘infancy, of her pluralistic identity, the 
source of all her riches, symbolized by the 
slogan chanted during a recent anti-racist 
‘demonstration: “First, second, third, 
fourth generation, we are all the children 
of immigrants.” [|

### 65921: Integration or repatriation? The Federal Republic of Germany

  
BETWEEN TWO CULTURES 
The Federal Republic of Germany 
Integration or repatriation? 
by Gisela Apitzsch and Norbert Dittmar 
HERE are about 4.5 million for- 
eigners living in the Federal Repub- 
lic of Germany and West Berlin of 
whom Turkish nationals form by far the . 
largest group, accounting for 35 per cent 
of the total. 
As a result of the current economic 
situation the legal requirements affecting 
foreigners are being applied in a more 
restrictive manner and this has made their 
situation more precarious and has also 
made it more difficult for them to plan for 
the future. Only a fraction of these 
. + migrants enjoy legal security. Although 2.9 
-. million foreigners have been living in the 
Federal Republic for more than eight years 
and thus fulfil the most important condition 
for obtaining a residence permit which 
18 
would protect them against expulsion in 
the case of long-term unemployment or 
dependence on social security, only 3.2 per 
cent are in possession of this precious doc- 
ument. 
In order to clarify the present situation 
of foreign communities from countries out- 
side the European Economic Community 
(EEC) in general, and of the Turkish com- 
munity in particular, it is necessary to 
retrace the policies concerning foreigners 
adopted over the past few years. 
Uncertainty about the future seems 
etched into the features of these foreign 
workers in the port of Hamburg. Facing 
them was the prospect of massive redun- 
dancies in the city’s shipyards. 
The ban on recruitment of foreign work- 
ers decreed in 1973 and a regulation of 
the Bundesanstalt fiir Arbeit (Federal Insti- 
tute of Labour), which came into force a 
year later, concerning the granting of work 
permits for foreigners stipulated that an 
interruption of residence in the Federal 
Republic could result in loss of employ- 
ment. To avoid this problem many migrant 
workers tried to arrange for their families 
to join them in the Federal Republic. 
As a result, during the years of economic 
crisis, the age and employment compo- 
sition’ of the foreign population underwent 
a fundamental change. Whereas the num- 
ber of foreign workers living in the Federal 
Republicin 1978 tallied almost exactly with 
that mm 1973, the number of foreigners in 
employment had actually gone down by

28 per cent. The number of children under 
the age of sixteen increased by about 25 
per cent, passing the million mark in 1976. 
In the following years the authorities 
pursued a dual strategy: on the one hand 
encouraging return to the country of ori- 
gin, and on the other promoting the inte- 
gration of migrants. As late as 1978 a prac- 
tice was introduced whereby foreigners 
who fulfilled certain conditions, such as 
having satisfactory living quarters and a 
basic knowledge of the German language, 
could be granted an unlimited residence 
permit after five years of uninterrupted 
stay and the right of residence after eight 
years. In 1979 the general ban on employ- 
ment for spouses who had joined their 
partners at a later date was lifted in favour 
of a four-year waiting period. Since then 
adolescents joining their parents later have 
usually been granted full access to the 
labour market after a maximum two-year 
waiting period— with the proviso that pref- 
erence should be given to nationals 
of the Federal Republic and the EEC 
countries. 
These improvements in the situation of 
the children of immigrant workers were 
supported on the grounds that their dis- 
advantaged position at school and at work 
might prove a threat to social stability and 
that the members of this “second gen- 
eration” could be considered as a potential 
source of skilled labour to meet shortages 
expected in the late 1980s. 
1979 was a key year for integration strat- 
egies, and a number of in-school and out- 
Turkish women photographed at the Fed- 
‘eral Republic of Germany’s recruitment 
office in Istanbul, before the 1973 ban on 
. the recruitment of foreign workers. Those 
who spoke German, had a relative work- 
ing in the Federal Republic or had already 
worked abroad stood a better chance of 
getting a job. 
of-school training programmes were ini- 
tiated. Perhaps the most important of these 
was a programme of Measures for Job- 
preparation and Social Integration of 
Young Foreigners (MBSE). The MBSE is 
a full-time, ten-month programme whose 
primary aim is to provide adolescents with 
an integrated course combining practical 
job preparation, language teaching and 
general education. The vast majority of 
participants (95 per cent) are Turkish 
youths. The initial intention was that the 
programme should be offered nationwide 
and be extended to offer 20,000 places. 
However, a continual reduction has taken 
place since the programme was established 
in 1980, and in the year 1983/84 only 6,500 
adolescents were able to benefit from it. 
By the early 1980s, the tendency to 
regard integration policy as a means of 
limiting the number of foreigners grew 
stronger. Opportunities for families to be 
reunited have been drastically curtailed. 
Since December 1981 only children below

the age of 16 (as compared with 18 pre- 
viously) have been allowed to join their 
parents, and a stricter interpretation of the 
regulations concerning living quarters fre- 
quently makes it impossible for married 
couples or for parents and their under-age 
children to live together. 
One of the basic aims of policies con- 
cerning foreigners under the Government’s 
Urgent Measures Programme was the facil- 
itation of repatriation. Foreigners from 
non-EEC countries who left the Federal 
Republic or West Berlin between October 
1983 and September 1984 could ask for 
50 per cent of their pension contributions 
to be paid back to them and the usual two- 
year waiting period was waived. According 
to information from the Regional Insur- 
ance Offices one-fifth of all Turkish nation- 
als living in the Federal Republic took 
advantage of this offer even though they 
lost the employers’ contributions and had 
to forgo all claims on a pension as well 
as the possibility of returning to the Federal 
Republic in the future. 
Although the Federal Government has 
an interest in reducing the number of for- 
eigners living in the Republic, the economy 
is still dependent to a certain extent on 
foreign workers. They account for 28 per 
cent of the work force in foundries, 25 per 
cent in the mining industry, 20 per cent 
in the textile industry, 16 per cent in the 
car industry and 14 per cent in the building 
sector. In these areas, as well as in the 
artificial fibre industry, in cellulose pro- 
duction and in heating and refrigeration p

Pp works, it would be well nigh impossible 
to replace foreign workers by unemployed 
nationals of the Federal Republic of Ger- 
many, since their qualification patterns are 
unsuitable. 
About half the unemployed nationals of 
the Federal Republic are qualified in areas 
in which hardly any foreign workers are 
employed. Moreover, for health or age 
reasons, two-thirds of them could not take 
over jobs with a high level of stress, and 
one-fifth of them are looking only for part- 
time employment. Thus, even though 
many nationals of the Federal Republic 
consider foreigners to be a contributory 
factor to the unemployment situation, 
ousting them from the labour market 
would in fact do little to improve it. 
More than 95 per cent of foreign workers 
are employed in production (one in six 
production workers is a foreigner). In West 
Berlin, where the proportion of foreigners 
(12 per cent) is higher than anywhere else, 
one in every four workers comes from one 
of the former countries of recruitment, half 
of them being from Turkey. Foreigners 
also form a high proportion of the work 
force in towns in the industrial area of the 
Ruhr and in Frankfurt-am-Main, Offen- 
bach, Stuttgart, Mannheim and Munich. 
Foreign workers have been much more 
badly hit by unemployment than nationals 
of the Federal Republic. Whereas at the 
end of 1983 there was a total of 9.5 per 
cent of registered unemployed, the rate 
amongst foreign workers was nearer 14.9 
per cent. Turkish workers were the most 
severely affected with an official unem- 
ployment rate of 18 per cent. 
Foreign families are worried not only 
about uncertain employment prospects, 
  
and consequently about the right of res- 
idence, but also about the uncertain future 
facing their children. 
Foreign children form a significant part 
(845,000) of the school population—one 
in every twelve pupils is of foreign origin. 
In towns with a high foreign population 
some 25 to 30 per cent of the pupils in 
primary and secondary schools are of for- 
eign origin, with Turkish pupils forming 
the largest single group (53 per cent). 
The opportunities for social progress for 
these children are minimal—20 to 25 per 
cent play truant, some 50 per cent of for- 
eign school-leavers fail to obtain a certif- 
icate of education, and only very few of 
them continue their education beyond sec- 
ondary level. 
Since responsibility for education lies 
with the regions and not with the Federal 
Government, there is no homogeneous 
educational policy in the Federal Republic 
of Germany. Each local authority puts its 
own interpretation on the guidelines estab- 
lished by the Conference of Education 
Ministers. Yet despite certain local dif- 
ferences to which this leads, a number of 
common factors can be observed: the 
native language and culture of foreign chil- 
dren is hardly taken into account in regular 
courses and native language teaching rarely 
figures on the time-table where classes are 
mixed; there is a shortage of teachers who 
are adequately prepared for teaching 
involving foreign children; there is a grow- 
ing tendency to segregate foreign pupils.

Even though the educational aspirations 
of foreign pupils have been shown to be 
. no lower than those of nationals of the 
Federal Republic, 75 per cent of foreign 
adolescents receive no education beyond 
secondary level and no specialized job 
training. Inadequate knowledge of the 
German language goes a long way to 
explaining this situation. 
However, in order to enable at least the 
following generations to acquire an eman- 
cipated status in their host country and to 
ensure the peaceful co-existence of mem: 
bers of differing ethnic and cultural back- 
gounds, more must be done than simply 
to lament migrants’ lack of readiness to 
go through a process of acculturation. 
What is needed—and this also in the inter- 
est of the majority of the population—is 
a turning away from the employment of 
foreign workers on the basis of short-term 
economic interests and a re-thinking of 
employment policies by those to whom 
political responsibility is entrusted. [|

### 65934: The Struggle against discrimination: United Kingdom

  
The struggle against 
‘discrimination 
HERE has been an Asian and Car- 
ibbean presence in Britain for sev- 
eral centuries, reflecting British 
colonial history. Many British towns and 
cities, particularly seaports, contain Asian 
and Caribbean communities which have 
been established for three generations or 
more. Their origin often lies with travelling 
salesmen from the Indian sub-continent or 
with seamen recruited in the colonies. 
These communities formed the base for 
the migration that developed in the 1950s 
in response to the demand for labour in 
certain sectors of the British economy. As 
happened elsewhere in Western Europe 
by Robert Miles 
after 1945, the expansion of the capitalist 
economy exhausted the supply of labour 
within the national boundary and employ- 
ers were forced to recruit workers from 
elsewhere. 
The majority of those recruited after 
1945 were from colonies and ex-colonies, 
and they arrived in Britain with British 
citizenship. Comparable circumstances 
existed in the case of certain migrant 
groups to France and the Netherlands. 
These colonial migrants arrived with the 
right to settle and work, and with full polit- 
ical and civil rights. However, this position 
of legal equality has not led to their attain- 
ing a position of economic and social equal- 
ity with the indigenous population. 
Most New Commonwealth migrants who 
came to Britain before 1965 did so in order 
to fill positions in the labour market 
vacated by indigenous workers. These 
were mainly manual jobs, and particularly 
semi- and unskilled manual jobs. They 
were also often low-paid and involved poor 
working conditions and/or shiftwork. 
Migrants were concentrated in textiles, 
food production, automobile construction, 
metal manufacture, transport and the 
National Health Service.

» Although the majority of migrants in this 
early period were men, the migration from 
the Caribbean did include a large pro- 
portion of women who came in order to 
work in their own right. Since the mid- 
1960s, almost all the New Commonwealth 
migrants have been the wives and children 
of those who came in the earlier period, 
and many of them have entered the labour 
market as is their right. 
Thus, in 1981, 89.9 per cent of Caribbean 
men of working age and 69.9 per cent of 
Caribbean women were employed, com- 
pared with 90.6 per cent of indigenous men 
and 63.5 per cent of indigenous women. 
The respective figures for Asian men and 
women were 85.6 per cent and 41.4 per 
cent. The much smaller proportion of 
Asian women employed is partly explained 
by cultural factors. 
The position of these migrants in the 
labour market in the 1980s has not changed 
noticeably from the situation that existed 
during the early period of the migration. 
A national survey published in 1984 
showed that, amongst the indigenous male 
population, 42 per cent were employed in 
professional and non-manual occupations, 
and 58 per cent were employed in manual 
work. The respective figures for Asian men 
were 26 per cent and 73 per cent, and for 
Caribbean men, 15 per cent and 83 per 
cent. 
Concerning manual work, men of Car- 
ibbean and Asian origin remained over- 
represented in semi- and unskilled jobs, 
compared with 16 per cent of indigenous 
men, 
Workers of Caribbean and Asian origin 
in Britain are, therefore, predominantly 
manual workers and are significantly over- 
represented in semi- and unskilled manual 
work. The migrant of the 1950s was 
recruited to these positions. But an expla- 
nation is required for the fact that migrants 
and their British-born children remain 
largely confined to these same sectors. 
Language problems have not been irrel- 
evant, and some of the migrants lacked 
formal qualifications, but these factors less 
easily explain the position and experience 
of the migrants’ children. 
In the case of the latter, the question 
of achievement within the British edu- 
cation system arises, especially for West 
Indian boys. Yet even where people of 
Asian and Caribbean origin speak good 
English and have equivalent qualifications, 
they are commonly employed in inferior 
positions. A number of studies conducted 
since the mid 1960s have shown that dis- 
crimination plays a crucial role in deter- 
mining their position in the labour market, 
despite the fact that such discrimination 
is illegal. 
West Indian and Asian migrants and 
their children (particularly young men of 
Caribbean origin) have been particularly 
vulnerable to unemployment. In the early 
1960s, unemployment amongst New Com- 
monwealth migrants was higher than 
amongst the indigenous population, but it

fell during the 1960s, with the exception 
of the recession of 1967/68, and by the end 
of the decade was at about the same level. 
However, over the past fifteen years, 
unemployment amongst both migrants and 
their children has increased faster than 
amongst the indigenous population. 
Within the Asian and Caribbean popu- 
lations, unemployment rates have been 
even higher for young West Indian men 
and for Pakistani and Bangladeshi women. 
The aforementioned 1984 study showed 
that 25 per cent of Caribbean men and 16 
per cent of Caribbean women, and 20 per 
cent of Asian men and women were unem- 
ployed, compared with 13 per cent of indig- 
enous men and 10 per cent of indigenous 
women. In the 16-24 years age range, 44 
per cent of Caribbean men and 38 per cent 
of Caribbean women, and 30.5 per cent 
of Asian men and 38.5 per cent of Asian 
women were unemployed, compared with 
26 per cent of indigenous men and 20 per 
"cent of indigenous women. 
This higher level of unemployment is 
due in part to the fact that Asian and Car- 
ibbean workers are over-represented 
amongst those engaged in semi- and 
unskilled manual work for low wages. Peo- 
ple doing these jobs are more likely to 
become unemployed, partly because it is 
these sorts of manual jobs that are increas- 
ingly being replaced by machinery. But this 
is far from being the only factor. 
Asian and Caribbean people are more 
likely to be unemployed whatever their job 
level, and they are also more likely to be 
unemployed due to dismissal from work. 
These facts suggest that discrimination is 
an important part of the explanation. 
Discrimination confines migrants to par- 
ticular positions in the hierarchy of wage 
labour, but in a way which is not always 
evident to the victims; studies show that 
people of Asian and Caribbean origin 
underestimate the extent of discrimination 
against them. Moreover, immigrants are 
also subjected to incidents of violence. A 
Home Office report published in 1981 con- 
cluded that there was a minimum of 7,000 
attacks-a year and that people of Asian 
origin were fifty times more likely to be 
the victim of an attack than people of Euro- 
pean origin. People of Caribbean origin 
were thirty-six times more likely to be vic- 
tims of such attacks. The research team 
concluded that “It was clear to us that the 
Asian community widely believes that it 
is the object of a campaign of unremitting 
racial harassment which it fears will grow 
worse in the future”. These attacks take 
place in certain urban areas, especially in 
the big cities. 
The vast majority of colonial migrants 
to Britain and their British-born children 
are part of the working class. In many 
respects they share all the disadvantages 
-and problems of the working class, and 
they are involved in traditional forms of 
working class political organization and 
behaviour. Overall, workers of Asian and 
Caribbean origin are more likely to belong 
to a trade union and to vote for the Labour 
Party than are indigenous workers. They 
have also played a prominent part in trade’ 
union struggles, although the trade unions 
themselves are often characterized by dis- 
criminatory practices against immigrants. 
The political consciousness of these work-- 
ers overlaps to a significant extent with the

The activities of self-help groups, com-

with their children’s experience in the edu-

### 65940: Men for all seasons: North America

    
North America 
Men for all seasons 
HE history of the exploitation of 
migrant workers in general and in 
North America in particular is too 
well known to warrant repetition. It has 
provided the plot of more than one major 
novel and the workers’ plight has been 
portrayed in all its pathos in more than 
one film. That plight tends to be a com- 
bination of substandard wages and living 
conditions and a high degree of job in- 
security. More often than not these con- 
ditions have been associated with the agri- 
cultural sector in labour-intensive agro- 
industries. 
Because such substandard programmes 
continue to exist it might be good to look 
at some cases where the use of migrant 
labour in agriculture has worked well for 
by Anthony P. Maingot 
the migrant, his family and community as 
well as for the employer. It might be pos- 
sible to derive some lessons from a review 
of such cases. It is fortunate, therefore, 
that we now have good data on two agri- 
cultural programmes utilizing migratory 
labour, one in the State of Florida and the 
other in Canada. 
The 8,000 migrant workers in the Florida 
sugar industry are in a way all that is left 
of the original bracero (strong arm) pre- 
gramme that started in 1942 and at its 
height brought more than 420,000 workers, 
mostly Mexican, to work in US agriculture. 
Only one part of that large migrant worker 
scheme of the 1940s remained intact: the 
so-called H-2 programme (from the cat- 
egory of visa granted to temporary work- 
ers) bringing British West Indians to work 
in the Florida sugar cane industry. Estab- 
lished in 1943, it continues up to today. 
The story of the success of this H-2 pro- 
gramme is the story of a felicitous match 
between nature and economic circum- 
stances in Florida and the cultural ori- 
entations of British West Indians. 
Florida cane is grown under conditions 
which do not allow full mechanization. 
Such a cane culture is not suited to the 
use of cane cutting machines; it needs 
~ skilled and dependable manual labour. 
Here nature shapes economics, for if a 
machete-wielding man in Florida is to com- 
pete with a harvesting machine in Hawaii, 
he has to be skilled. But cutting cane man- 
ually is nasty, back-breaking work that no 
EST Indians who migrate to Can- 
ada today are generally better edu- 
cated than their predecessors and 
more at home in modern metropolitan com- 
munities. However, in spite of the fact that 
most of them come from the countryside and 
small towns and have no experience of big 
city life, they do not go to the rural areas 
of Canada. They are attracted to the large 
urban centres of Toronto, Montreal, and Van- 
couver. 
Having left their native land for economic 
reasons, and with the expectation of eco- 
nomic advancement in their adopted home, 
they are ill-prepared to face the reality of 
Canadian attitudes towards immigrants. But 
West Indians, as well as facing the same 
problems as immigrants of whatever race or 
origin, are also victims of greater hostility 
because of their colour, especially when they 
try to obtain housing and employment. Hav- 
ing experienced a marginal existence in the 
West Indies, and finding that his basic cultural 
and human values are not recognized in Can- 
ada, the West Indian immigrant often expe- 
riences serious identity problems. 
Attempts by West Indians to be accepted 
through adapting themselves to the dominant 
culture have, with few exceptions, not suc- 
ceeded. Many West Indians are actively par- 
24 
West Indian Immigrants in Canada 
ticipating in movements which are seeking 
to change the present situation in which they 
face varying degrees of prejudice and dis- 
crimination. These individuals and groups - 
are joining forces with Canadian-born blacks, 
South Asians and other disadvantaged group 
in an effort to eliminate discriminatory prac- 
tices which restrict their full participation in 
Canadian society. 
The Haitian community in Quebec con- 
stitutes a special case in this respect. First 
of all it has to face the problem of illegal or 
clandestine immigrants who wish to leave 
Haiti at all costs and cannot receive aid from 
the Government when they arrive in Canada. 
In the early 1960s, the Haitian diaspora 
consisted of highly educated individuals, 
mostly professional people, until the political 
situation in Haiti gave rise to an entirely dif- 
ferent kind of exodus, especially from the 
rural areas of the country. In addition, 
because of their physical characteristics and 
the African sonority of their mother tongue, 
the Haitians quickly form a group which the 
officials of the Immigration Ministry describe 
as “visible”. So far, however, Haitians have 
not sought to confine themselves to a ghetto 
or to form groups centred on immigrant asso-, 
ciations. 
The evidence suggests that the Haitians 
have not encountered major obstacles to 
heir adaptation to the society and culture 
of Quebec either from the two national major- 
ities or from the other groups, in spite of the 
universal feeling that the “Creoles” are going 
through a difficult period in Quebec. A “third 
culture” is beginning to emerge in the Haitian 
community, a kind of intermingling born of 
the social differences between young Hai- 
tians and their contemporaries in Quebec. 
This third culture is formed largely of dis- 
parate, anarchic elements, taken at random 
from American and English-speaking West 
Indian “negritude”. It can easily be imagined 
that such influences, added to the pro- 
nounced oral character of Haitian culture may 
separate the young generation from the main 
trends and currents of life in Quebec and 
create an impression of lack of commitment - 
and marginalization. [|

one in the world engages in unless the . 
rewards are real, as indeed they have been. 
To be sure, the major element of this 
reward is monetary—the difference 
between what the workers make abroad 
and what they would 'have made staying 
home. But there is another incentive which 
explains the popularity of the H-2 pro- 
gramme: the worker is not locked into the 
“cane culture’,.i.e. the complex and 
demeaning life style associated with the 
sugar plantation which affected not just 
the worker but his whole family. Certainly 
the companies’ stance toward labour 
reflects self-interest, not altruism nor a 
particular fondness for West Indians. 
Here again the reason for the situation 
is economic, since the traditional source 
of abundant and thus cheaply available 
labour does not exist. It has not been dif- 
ficult, therefore, for the U.S. Department 
of Labor to provide certification for this 
programme: every effort to recruit local 
labour has so far failed. This is where both 
economics and culture come in, because 
the necessary labour is available in the 
West Indies where migration and work 
abroad have long been integral parts of 
the area’s cultural orientations. 
An interesting cultural aspect of this 
migration is that even before the dawning 
of the trade union movement West Indians 
tended to organize for improvement. 
Today these workers who come for the 
five-month season are represented through 
their union, the British West Indian Cen- 
tral Labour Organization. Additionally, 
being citizens of small but proudly dem- 
ocratic States such as Jamaica, Barbados, 
and St. Vincent, they possess the advan- 
tage of having the support and vigilance 
of their Governments which, no doubt, are 
keenly aware of the contributions the earn- 
ings of these workers make to the balance 
of payments and hard currency situation. 
The joint effort in favour of workers’ 
rights has paid off. Apart from subsidized 
room and board, they get a 50 per cent 
subsidy for travel to the job, and upon 
completion of contract, free travel back. 
Workers receive a medical exam before 
travelling, and are covered by their own 
group hospitalization insurance as well as 
State-mandated workers’ compensation 
for job-related injuries. The goal in nego- 
tiating these subsidies is of course to fulfil 
the whole purpose of migratory work: 
sending much of the earnings back home. 
In a fundamental way, work in the Flor- 
ida sugar industry helps to reinforce their 
status back home rather than replicating 
the terrible wastage of human lives so typ- 
ical of the history of the sugar plantation. 
An interesting comparison can be made 
with West Indian farm workers in Canada, 
where the programme was established 
much later than in the USA. First came 
the Jamaicans in 1966, followed in 1976 
by workers from the eastern Caribbean and 
Mexico. By 1982 there were some 6,000 
working on fruit, vegetable and tobacco 
farms. Over half of these were Jamaicans. 
In Canada as in the United States the eco- 
nomic rationale is the same: the inability 
to recruit sufficient native workers. 
As distinct from Florida, however, 
where only eight large growers are 
involved, in Canada the farm workers deal 
with small farmers; in 1982, 782 employers 
participated. The hourly wage in 1983 
ranged from $3.50 to $4.80 per hour. As 
in the case of those going to Florida, nearly 
all had jobs back home when recruited. 
However, those going to Canada tend to 
come from a different labour pool: over 
half were skilled or semi-skilled workers. 
As is to be expected, West Indians indi- 
cate that they travel for the increased pay, 
yet fully 22 per cent of those in Canada 
indicated that they had travelled for the 
experience of being overseas. 
Although clearly a very small part of the 
overall flow of migrant farm workers, espe- 
cially into the United States, the cases 
described illustrate the fact that this type 
of work does not have to be exploitative 
and degrading to the workers to be bene- 
ficial to the employer. Work in agriculture 
does not have to be associated with the 
wasting “plantation syndrome.” u

### 65942: A Delicate balance: the Gulf States

The Gulf States 
A delicate balance 
by Elisabeth Longuenesse 
26 
HE demographic situation in the 
Gulf States (the six members of the 
Gulf Co-operation Council— Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United 
Arab Emirates, Oman) is unique: in 1980, 
of a total population of some thirteen mil- 
lion, it was estimated that over four million 
were foreigners, while of a total working 
population of some four million three 
hundred thousand, about two million five 
hundred thousand were foreign workers. 
Whereas in Saudi Arabia, which is the 
largest of the Gulf States and whose pop- 
ulation constitutes two thirds of the total, 
non-Saudi workers accounted for less than 
50 per cent of the total working population 
in 1980, the proportion of foreigners in the 
small Gulf Emirates has reached such lev- 
els that social and cultural imbalances are 
getting out of hand. In Qatar 85 per cent 
and in the United Arab Emirates 90 per 
cent of workers are foreign and three-quar-

in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. 
ters of the total population are non-citi- 
zens. In Kuwait over 75 per cent of the 
workers and nearly 60 per cent of the pop- 
ulation are non-Kuwaiti. 
The situation in Oman and Bahrain 
seems to be better balanced. This is 
because Oman still has a large rural pop- 
ulation, whilst there has been a relative 
decline in immigration to Bahrain, al- 
though this trend is now being reversed. 
Since the policy of importing labour 
from abroad is of relatively recent origin, 
most of these workers are unaccompanied 
men and this strong male predominance 
has given rise to a very serious population 
imbalance. Only in Kuwait and Bahrain, 
where immigration has a longer history, 
has a better balance been achieved thanks 
to the gradual arrival of families and the 
subsequent creation of families on the spot. 
The immigrants can be divided into three 
main cultural groups: the Europeans, who 
form a privileged minority and whom we 
mention only for the record, the Arabs, 
still by far the most numerous, and the 
Asians, who have been constantly growing 
in number since the mid-1970s. 
Unlike immigrant workers in Western 
Europe, those in the Gulf States are to 
be found in all branches of activity and 
at all levels of skill. This is true for all 
nationalities, although the pattern of qual- 
ifications is not the same for all of them. 
The employment of indigenous workers is 
marginal in virtually all sectors except the 
administration. 
The conditions under which immigration 
takes place vary considerably. Strictly 
speaking, the prospective immigrant must 
have an employment contract before an 
entry visa can be granted, unless he man- 
ages to get a job while visiting relations. 
There is, however, a lot of illegal immi- 
gration and the status of illegal immigrants 
is very precarious. They are at the mercy 
of the expulsion measures which the 
authorities apply from time to time, but 
since they provide a margin of flexibility 
for the labour market they are usually tol- 
erated in practice. Owing to the absence 
of local manpower, to the obligation for 
a foreigner to have a work permit before 
entry, to the fact that foreigners cannot 
easily change jobs, and to the prohibition 
on foreigners remaining in the country if 
they become unemployed, the labour mar- 
ket is extremely rigid. 
Apart from illegal immigration there is 
another practice which helps to ensure a 
supply of marginal, day-to-day manpower. 
This consists of the importation of workers, 
quite legally, by someone who is himself 
the owner of one or more small businesses. 
If he succeeds in obtaining entry visas for 
workers in excess of his own needs, he 
either throws them on the labour market 
to fend for themselves or hires them out 
to other employers on a daily basis, retain- 
ing a percentage of their wages for himself. 
Foreign workers have no means of 
organizing to defend their rights. Trade 
unions are forbidden except in Kuwait and 
Bahrain where foreigners have the right 
to join a union after five years with the 
same employer but are not allowed to take 
part in elections. So the worker has no 
recourse against any possible exploitation, 
particularly since in many instances he will 
have incurred heavy debts to gain entry 
into the country in the first place. Even 
if he obtains regular employment it may 
be several months before he can save any 
money to send to his family. 
The vast majority of immigrants remain 
on the fringe of society, housed, at worst, 
under canvas on the outskirts of towns and, 
at best, in collective apartments. More 
often they live crowded into dilapidated

houses in old quarters that have been aban- 
doned by the indigenous inhabitants. 
Nearly a third of foreigners resident in 
Kuwait were born there, but only 16 per 
cent have been living there for more than 
ten years, since the majority of the second 
generation consists of youngsters less than 
ten years old. Already in 1975, 126,500 
of the 234,000 children attending school 
in Kuwait were foreign. Nevertheless, the 
existence of a core, albeit still small, of 
older, well-established immigrants has had 
an integrating influence on the newer 
arrivals. 
Life is certainly easier for the worker 
who is accompanied by his family, but he 
is liable to be more severely affected by 
any discrimination to which he may be 
subjected. Certainly, he enjoys some of 
the advantages of an oil-rich society such 
as free medical care and free schooling for 
his children (provided that they were born 
in Kuwait or their parents have been living 
there since 1970 and, above all, that they 
don’t fall behind in their studies). How- 
ever, scarcity of services and the priority 
given to Kuwaiti citizens often oblige the 
foreign worker to have recourse to the 
private sector. In many cases he is saddled 
with an exorbitant rent while access to 
subsidized housing or house ownership on 
easy terms and grants and allowances of 
various kinds are reserved to citizens who 
also receive higher wages for similar work. 
These frustrations contribute to the 
building up of a climate of tension which 
may develop into mutual hostility. Asian 
immigrants seem to provoke most of the 
negative reactions, at least in the press 
which blames them for the growth in the 
crime rate (not supported by the facts) or 
which expresses fear of loss of cultural 
identity should they become numerically 
predominant. It is true that if immigration 
from Asia continues, even at a lower rate, 
the question of integration will eventually 
be posed in terms of recognizing national 
“minorities” that will have become major- 
ities. |

### 65945: How to be a good host: Scandinavia

BETWEEN TWO CULTURES 
  
Scandinavia 
How to be a good host 
OW are migrants adapting to life 
in the Scandinavian countries? To 
understand the problems of adap- 
tation that migrants face it might be better 
to turn the question round and ask: How 
are Scandinavians adapting to the presenc 
of migrants? 
Scandinavians tend to think of migrant 
workers as being people from Third World 
countries, whereas in fact migrant workers 
coming from other Scandinavian countries, 
Europe and North America are far more 
numerous. 
During the economic upswing in Europe 
during the 1960s Third World migrant 
workers were encouraged to come to the 
Scandinavian countries by open-door gov- 
ernmental policies aided by active labour 
recruitment by private employers. Many 
workers came from India, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh, with Pakistanis now forming 
the largest group (about 7,500). 
Just as labour was recruited when it was 
needed, so its entry was halted when it 
was not. Norway was the last Scandinavian 
country to call a halt to immigration (in 
1975), but it did so with certain dispen- 
sations which permitted free movement of 
labour within the Scandinavian countries 
and provided certain special preferential 
arrangements for North Americans. 
Thus, until some five years ago the Third 
World migrant was perceived as an eco- 
nomic element, but now he has become 
an ethnic element. Coming from the Third 
World and still attached to it in the eyes 
of both officials and the public, he is a 
“Third World problem” and, in a certain 
sense, he is supposed to remain one. An 
Indian immigrant, now a school psychol- 
ogist, was asked to provide some migrants 
for a radio programme (the broadcasting 
station was government owned and con- 
trolled). When he suggested himself as one 
of them he was told: “Not you! You are 
a successful migrant!”

The ban on Third World immigration 
and the arrival of wives and children 
changed the situation. The unaccompanied 
male worker who, it was assumed, would 
eventually return home when no longer 
needed, had become a family man appar- 
ently there to stay. This not only affected 
the structural situation in the Scandinavian 
countries, but also attitudes towards immi- 
grants. 
Structurally the Scandinavian States 
define the migrant community as an ethnic 
minority, their culture as a minority culture

and their language as a minority language. 
- They have created various institutions 
exclusively concerned with migrants, such 
as housing institutions, separate employ- 
ment offices and separate youth clubs, and 
subsidized migrants’ own organizations as 
well as mother-tongue and two-culture 
classes in schools and so on. Under this 
policy of cultural pluralism, as it has come 
to be called, ethnic differentiation has not 
only been endorsed, but also encouraged. 
What has been the outcome of this dif- 
ferentiation? 
Once the migrant becomes eligible for 
it, family housing is normally available 
either in the older sections in the centres 
of Scandinavian cities or, more recently, 
in new suburban housing areas in the out- 
skirts. These areas are not limited exclu- 
sively to migrants, but in practice a high 
percentage of migrant families live in them 
since they are directed there by the housing 
institutions to which they have to turn for 
help in finding accommodation. It is not 
uncommon to find that as much as 85 per 
cent of the population of these areas con- 
sists of immigrants with the remaining 15 
per cent being made up of Scandinavians, 
including a number of Scandinavian girls 
who have married migrants. 
The phrase “once the migrant becomes 
eligible for it” calls for some explanation. 
In Norway, for example, there is a curious 
ruling that an immigrant cannot bring his 
wife until he has family housing, and he 
is not eligible for family housing unless his 
wife is there! 
Separate employment offices for 
migrants result in the sifting and control 
of re-employment opportunities, job pref- 
erences and training programmes. 
Migrants working on North Sea oil rigs are 
a special case. Since the rigs are classified 
as “ships” they are not subject to the 
labour legislation that prevails on land. 
Spaniards working on them are often

recruited in Rotterdam, taken out directly 
by boat and never set foot on Norwegian 
soil. As a result these workers do not figure 
in Norwegian labour statistics. 
State subsidization of migrants’ own 
organizations led to the destruction of the 
original single-organization system which 
for a time offered a united front in defence 
of migrants’ interests. In Norway, for 
example, the plurality of subsidies has 
resulted in twenty-six separate and distinct 
Indian organizations receiving State funds 
for a total Indian population of a little over 
two thousand. Ethnic youth clubs are also 
given financial support. 
The policy of cultural pluralism may give 
the impression that all cultures are free 
to flourish on an equal basis in the Scan- 
dinavian countries. But is this the case in 
the schools? 
The debate on the pros and cons of 
mother-tongue teaching in schools is far 
from being resolved. Without exception 
the migrants’ own organizations demand 
mother-tongue teaching. Migrant parents 
demand proficiency in the language of the 
host country. 
The State and local authorities make 
proposals that chop and change from year 
to year. A two-teacher, two-language, two- 
culture class system is established for 
grades 1to 9. Two years later it is restricted 
to grades 1 to 3. A series of changes and 
new proposals that were later withdrawn 
provoked one migrant father, himself a

two-culture class teacher, to voice the opin- 
ion of many migrant parents when he 
declared: “We want an end to experi- 
mentation in the teaching of migrant chil- 
dren.” 
Throughout all this the goal presumably 
remains the same—to educate migrant chil- 
dren in such a way as to place them on 
an equal footing and to make them com- 
petitive with indigenous children when 
they leave school. However, to be com- 
petitive with Scandinavian children the 
migrant child has to know three languages. 
Even a Swede, a Dane or a Norwegian 
has to learn English in addition to his 
mother tongue if he is to obtain anything 
other than a menial job. Learning the lan- 
guage of the country in which he lives and 
works, when that language is itself a minor- 
ity language, does not take the migrant 
child very far. It could even be argued that, 
apart from acquiring a minimum of nec- 
essary phrases in the language of the host 
country, the migrant would do better to 
become proficient in English. 
No matter how well intentioned the 
thinking behind it may be, cultural plu- 
ralism has differentiation as its starting 
point and defines the migrant on an ethnic- 
minority basis. And it is the host country 
that defines what a minority culture is. 
Today’s man is a migrant. If he is treated 
as a member of a minority when he arrives 
in a white industrialized country, it is 
because he has been ethnically labelled. 
That he is part of a minority group in a 
particular host country is one thing. For 
him to be treated as a member of a minority 
is another. 
The Third World migrant, often a for- 
mer colonial subject, no longer sees him- 
self as he was taught to, that is to say, with 
reference to the white industrial world, to 
the white model. His models are changing. 
The trouble lies in the fact that the former 
model seems to be unaware of this change. 
A migrant, as opposed to a man who 
has never moved, is a highly adapted and

adaptable person. He has to be. In order . 
to survive he has had to learn the ins and 
outs of other nations’ cultures, languages, 
income tax and social security systems. The 
problem of adapting does not rest, and 
never has rested with the migrant. [|

plans as Maria, who is going on forty? Over 
and above the raw data of the figures illus- 
trating the trends and scale of the migration 
problem, what we are interested in finding 
out is how human beings cope with their 
transplantation and what upsets it causes. 
In the first place it should be remem- 
bered that migrants’ attitudes, experiences 
and plans vary from one period to another. 
For example, they will not have the same 
outlook if they are only just preparing to 
leave their own country as they will if they 
have already spent five or ten years as 
“foreigners” in another country. Hence, 
in psychological terms, a distinction can 
be made between several key stages in the 
actual experience of migration. 
This is the standpoint from which the 
analysis attempted here has been carried 
out. It is exclusively concerned with men

and women emigrating to Europe. A host 
of studies have shown that people emi- 
grating to the Americas leave their country 
of origin for good, whereas those who go - 
to work in the leading industrial countries 
of Europe visualize their stay as tempo- 
rary. The migrant’s psychological situation 
differs significantly in these two cases. 
It is more harrowing for people to leave 
their own country when their self-confi- 
dence has been undermined by the expe- 
riences they have gone through. Migrants 
leave because they earn a poor living or 
because they are unemployed. They are 
accordingly placed in a position where they 
are dominated, with all the demeaning con- 
sequences that implies. Leaving entails a 
twofold effort. The first is psychological; 
it entails an effort to overcome loss of self- 
esteem and to look forward to the prospect

of vocational training or a:job abroad. The 
second is material and entails finding ways 
and means of making the journey. 
Strongly influenced by the images con- 
veyed by the media and by the stories told 
by people who have returned home, which 
always tend to exaggerate the “wonders” 
of foreign countries, migrants have an 
idealized picture of the country to which 
they are so keen to go. The “credibility 
gap” between the country they dream of 
and the real-life situation they will find 
there causes their first traumatic experi- 
ence, This is compounded not only by their 
living and working conditions but by their 
meagre knowledge of the language of the 
host country, behaviour patterns in large 
industrial cities, administrative formalities 
which they do not understand, and even 
mechanical appliances which they look 
upon as traps. Above all, however, a trau- 
matic situation is created by the discrim- 
inatory, if not overtly racist, attitudes to 
which they are exposed. As they feel ill 
at ease and anonymous in an unfamiliar 
situation which they are unable to control, 
the view they have of themselves is utterly 
confused. 
Admitting to the resulting disappoint- 
ment and sense of disarray would be tan- 
tamount to acknowledging failure, but that 
is something the migrants cannot afford, 
since their only strength lies in their desire

to make a success of the plans they have 
made. In many instances, therefore, they 
develop defence mechanisms in order to 
cope more easily with the difficulties con- 
fronting them. 
© Consequently, they withdraw into them- 
selves and into their community, since they 
only feel at ease among their own people 
and tend to idealize their country of origin. 
This is reflected in the importance they 
attach to certain features that seem to have 
no bearing on the success or failure of their 
emigration plans, such as loyalty to their 
own folk or appreciation of traditional fam- 
ily cooking, or in their readiness to forget 
the unemployment and poverty in their 
country of origin. 
Migrants also tend to become more frag- 
ile and to display somatization patterns; 
when they are il], they suffer from a range 
of symptoms which are difficult to identify 
and which may even give rise to certain 
forms of mental pathology. 
After a period of time which varies from 
case to case, the migrants manage to over- 
come these initial stumbling blocks and 
embark on a process of transculturation. 
  
From the psychological standpoint, the 
main feature of this stage lies in the con- 
flicts they experience whenever they have 
to compare their habitual practices, norms 
and values, in other words their original 
culture, with those of the host country. 
In their country of origin, the extended 
family and the community deal with many 
aspects of everyday life which are handled 
by institutions in the industrial countries. 
For example, the social security, family 
allowance and day nursery systems require 
information that has to be provided on 
special sheets or forms within prescribed 
deadlines. This is something foreigners find 
hard to grasp. 
Moreover, urban time and space are also 
regulated. Even in the places where they 
live, migrants are subject to constraints 
which they regard as infringements of their 
personal freedom. They cannot perform 
certain religious or family ceremonies such 
as the “sacrifice of the sheep”, because 
. the smell and the noise will inconvenience 
their neighbours; nor are they allowed to 
make a noise after certain hours. 
The organization of time in industrial 
cities is particularly demanding: everyday 
life is compartmentalized, with set times 
for meals and leisure pursuits, and people 
have to hurry from place to place. The 
comments made by migrants point to the 
difficulties they face in adapting to the new

Pp rhythm, as when they claim “The people 
here rush around all the time, it’s exhaust- 
ing”, or “At the factory your every move 
is watched and you’re even timed when 
you go to the toilet”, or else “I am under 
pressure because you always have to be 
in a hurry. By the evening, I'm so ex- 
hausted that I feel as if I've had all the 
stuffing knocked out of me”. 
Social relationships, especially between 
men and women, are baffling and cause 
tensions. Gestures that are meant to be 
polite are taken for impudence, and signs 
of friendship are misinterpreted. After 
some bewilderment which prompts them 
to withdraw into their shells, migrants 
reach the point where they try to com- 
prehend these behaviour patterns and to 
compare them with their own. Then they 
slowly embark on a process of change 
which eventually comes to affect significant 
aspects of their personality and cultural 
identity. 
After a while, when they meet newly 
arrived compatriots, they realize how they 
have changed when, for example, they feel 
embarrassed by the newcomers’ ‘noisy 
behaviour in the street” or by “the way 
they look at women”. But even though 
the rnigrants adopt some of the norms of 
the host country; they are still “out on a 
limb” as it were, torn between their deep- 
rooted and unconscious attachment to their

native culture, which they do not wish to 
betray, and their newly acquired outlook, 
which they feel to be more suited to the 
continued fulfilment of their plans. 
“I should like to open a grocery store 
in the village, but I haven’t managed to 
save enough money yet. I've been in Paris 
for fifteen years.... What worries me most 
is that my son wants to stay here, my 
daughter would like to go on with her stud- 
ies... and even my wife is not all that keen 
on going back.” These comments by a 
migrant worker reflect a situation that has 
become fairly widespread and arises when, 
after a period of time, the members of the 
family start to question the dream of going 
back home. 
The teenagers speak and write badly the 
language of the country of origin, and have 
few real ties with the mythical land which 
is meant to be “home”, especially since 
their friends are “over here”. Women— 
sometimes without even realizing it— find 
that they enjoy greater social independ- 
ence. They often dread going back to a 
situation in which they would again be 
compelled to live under the thumb of the 
family. 
Such uncertainty can be distressing, for 
emigrants feel that they have endured all 
kinds of ordeals because they were going 
to succeed and return home. Hence, giving 
up the idea of returning is tantamount to 
making a far-reaching appraisal of the very 
meaning of their lives. 
They have to ask themselves whether 
they are going to stay and become inte- 
grated. However, in some European coun- 
tries the adoption of such a course is to 
some extent a gamble, given the extent 
of discriminatory and even aggressive reac- 
tions towards immigrant workers and their 
children. 
What choice lies open to them? The 
uncertainties and the issues we have 
described form the backdrop to the lives 
of migrants and place them and their chil- 
dren in a kind of nomansland which often 
prevents them from making and carrying 
out long-term plans. [|

### 65946: Return ticket: the problems of going back

Return ticket 
The problems of going back 
by Eric-Jean Thomas and Catherine Wihtol de Wenden 
TT: flows of migration to the West- 
ern countries which took place after 
the Second World War, and espe- 
cially from the 1960s onwards, differed 
from earlier migratory movements in that 
they were primarily intended to be tem- 
porary. ’ 
In the wake of those immigrants who 
took their families and left their homeland 
to conquer a new world, the immigrants 
of the 1960s scarcely entertained the idea 
of settling in the host country on a per- 
manent basis. Their intention was to find 
better paid jobs, to put some money aside, 
and then to go back and turn their savings 
to good account. 
The clampdown on immigration decided 
by the industrialized countries after the 
1973 oil crisis had the unexpected effect 
of increasing the immigrant population res- 
ident in those countries and prolonging 
their stay. At the same time, there was 
a significant decline in the number of sea- 
sonal returns coinciding with vacation 
periods. 
This paradoxical situation stemmed from 
the fact that restrictions on immigration 
initially applied only to the workers them- 
selves who, since they expected more strin- 
gent regulations to be introduced, did their 
utmost to bring their families over to join 
them. As a result, many migrant workers 
postponed their return home indefinitely, 
and, afraid that they might not gain re- 
admittance to the host country, refrained 
from returning to their country of origin 
even for a temporary visit. 
For example, between 1974 and 1982, 
an estimated 100,000 Portuguese returned 
home, whereas some 200,000 emigrated 
during the same period. The same phe- 
nomenon also occurred in other sending 
countries with different economic struc- 
tures, such as Finland, where the number 
of returns home fell by 7 per cent in 1982. 
A study on Turkey carried out in 1980 
showed that the return phenomenon had 
been reduced to a mere trickle. 
For this reason, some European receiv- 
ing countries, including France and the 
Federal Republic of Germany, have 
attempted in the last decade to introduce 
policies aimed at encouraging immigrants 
to return home. These policies raise ques- 
tions of principle which were irrelevant in 
Egyptian migrant workers returning home 
after two years in Iraq 
the liberal climate of international migra- 
tions which still prevailed at the beginning 
of the twentieth century. 
The idea that States had the right to 
encourage immigrant workers to return to 
their countries of origin in a situation 
where labour was surplus to requirements 
slowly emerged between the two World 
Wars. Today, no European State can take 
peremptory measures for the collective 
expulsion of migrants. It is widely accepted 
that the loss of residence entitlement, 
which entails the loss of acquired social 
benefits, should give rise to compensation. 
As a result, there has been a gradual 
- recognition of a right associated with the 
return process, which is no longer rejected 
either by immigrants or by the trade 
unions, which are now more concerned 
with negotiating the amount of compen- 
sation to be paid. In a context of economic 
crisis, workers who are nationals of the 
host country sometimes protest against the 
discriminatory nature of such a right which 
does not apply to them and which gives 
them the impression that immigrants are 
favoured when it comes to leaving their 
jobs. 
This thinking about the return process 
gradually began to spread in the receiving 
countries when they closed their frontiers 
to foreign workers. In a sense it was 
 
because immigrants were no longer leaving 
that the host countries “invented” the idea 
of giving them money to encourage them 
"to return to their own countries. 
The fact is that policies to incite immi- 
grants to return raise questions of legality 
both for the countries which carry them 
out and, increasingly, for the countries of 
origin. In the host countries, providing 
assistance for return to the countries of 
origin is theoretically supposed to reassure 
public opinion which is anxious about the 
immigrant problem, but in practice it is 
. a costly, not very effective, and sometimes 
even damaging exercise. It may well be 
+ asked what purpose it serves, apart from 
having symbolic implications and serving 
as a bargaining counter between the States 
concerned. 
To what extent does the return of the 
migrants benefit the countries from which 
they emigrated? In fact, although their 
return may appear, at first sight, to be an 
advantage for the country of origin, a num- 
ber of recent studies have shown that this 
is by no means always the case. 
In terms of vocational training, the mar- 
ginal status of foreign workers in the host 
country is little incentive for them to 
improve their qualifications. The govern- 
ments of the host countries have clearly 
recognized this, since those which attempt p

» to promote the return of immigrants have 
introduced a variety of measures to 
improve the job qualifications of would-be 
returnees in line with the requirements of 
the countries of origin. 
However, these intentions are not 
always easy to fulfil, especially since the 
immigrant workers are reluctant to take .- 
time off work for vocational training, 
thereby foregoing immediate financial 
gain. The problem is further compounded 
by the fact that most of the prospective 
returnees are unskilled workers. 
Lastly, it must be stressed that on-the- 
job training in factories and other work- 
places is primarily geared to the needs of 
the industrial society of the host country 
and will be of little value to the country 
of origin. 
In terms of financial input to their coun- 
try of origin, regardless of whether the 
immigrants return as “failures” or “suc- 
cesses”, they will try to acquire a social 
and economic status higher than that they 
enjoyed when they left. The vast majority 
of the ‘“‘returnees’ aspire to be self- 
employed and put their savings into those 
sectors of the economy in which they are 
most likely to achieve this status. 
In agriculture, unless they have a well- 
thought-out plan, they often use their sav- 
ings to purchase more or less unproductive. 
land and equipment that cannot be easily 
serviced. 
* The purchase or construction of a house 
is one of the main purposes for which they 
use their savings. However, such an invest- 
ment can hardly be said to be productive 
and may entail a high social cost in urban 
areas. 
The tertiary sector of the economy, espe- 
cially small independent businesses, is the 
big magnet for their savings. Such small 
businesses, of which one-man taxi services 
are typical, are notoriously unproductive 
and are liable to have parasitic effects on 
the economy of the country of return. 
Lastly, savings are often channelled into 
the purchase of consumer goods. As a rule 
this has an adverse effect on the economy 
This work by the Belgian artist René 
Magritte (La Maison de Verre, 1939) could 
be seen as the depiction of aman eternally 
looking back to his past or dreaming of 
a return to his homeland. 
in that it stimulates domestic demand for 
imported goods. 
Studies carried out so far do not suggest 
that any change in social and political atti- 
tudes is intrinsic to the migration process. 
For if emigration gives rise to specific polit- 
ical or family behaviour patterns different 
from those of the country of origin, con- 
siderable caution must be exercised before 
concluding that such patterns will survive 
after the migrants have returned home. 
Finally, it must be emphasized, firstly, 
that the percentage of immigrants return- 
mg home is extremely small and that until 
recently the countries of origin displayed 
little interest in the problem. Secondly, 
although the structural effects of the return 
of immigrants are by no means clearly 
grasped, they are limited and, in general, 
have a disturbing impact on the economy 
of the home country. Thirdly, it is becom- 
ing clear that policies to encourage 
migrants to return can only be put into 
effect by the host countries as a result of 
far-reaching concerted action with the 
countries of origin. 
The return of immigrants can only 
become a reality and be a source of profit 
to the emigration countries if negotiations, 
which will have to be bilateral, at least in 
the early stages, lead in the long run to 
concerted action between these countries 
and the immigration countries. |

Two Unesco books on migrant workers 
: Racin.   
Living in two cultures presents a collection of 
studies on the social and cultural situation of 
immigrants in Europe and the United States. 
The first part is concerned with the conditions, 
nature and effects of official language training 
programmes for migrant workers and their 
families. The second part addresses the partic- 
ular problems faced by female migrants and how 
the characteristics of the old culture affect their 
adaptation to the requirements of the new. 
1982 © 325 pages 140 French francs 
ISBN 92-3-1018669-8 
Co-published with Gower Publishing Co. Ltd, 
who have exclusive sales rights in the United 
Kingdom. 
Immigrant workers in Europe: their legal status 
shows how the status of immigrant workers is 
determined with reference to the economic, 
political and social conditions peculiar to each 
host country and, particularly, how the legal 
machinery controlling immigration affects the 
future of migrants. Chapters discuss the specific 
situation in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, 
the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and 
Turkey.
