### IGNORE

The Acropolis of Athens, site of one of the world’s 
most famous groups of ancient monuments, rises 
up in the midst of modern buildings in the Greek 
capital. Also known as the Holy Rock, the 
Acropolis takes its name from the Greek words 
akros (upper) and polis (city). It was already a 
centuries-old sanctuary in the 5th century B.C., 
when the great Athenian statesman Pericles 
launched the grandiose building programme whose 
remains are still admired today. Easily identifiable 
in this rare aerial view (see also page 18} are the 
Parthenon (large rectangular building in centre); the 
Erechtheum (left of Parthenon); and the Propylaea 
and the Temple of Athena Nike (group of buildings 
at left of photo). Clearly visible at foot of hill are 
two ancient theatres: the Odeon (left) and the 
Theatre of Dionysus (right). 
During a ceremony held in the Parthenon, Athens, on 10 
January 1977, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow, Director-General 
of Unesco, launched an international campaign to save the 
historic monuments of the Acropolis. 
Many of Unesco’s Member States have already set an 
example of international solidarity in responding to this 
appeal. Equally numerous are those which intend to offer the 
Greek government—which has decided to assume the costs of 
the operation —scientific and technical cooperation, especially 
in combatting the stone disease that afflicts the marble 
monuments and in ensuring the stability of the rock on 
which they stand.

### 46720: How the Acropolis can be saved

- between the eve of World War Il 
and the present day constitute a 
very short period of time in comparison 
with the age of Athens, but one which has 
been of great significance for the develop- 
ment and appearance of the city. 
As far as the Acropolis itself is concern- 
ed, these four decades have passed 
without any major changes (the large- 
scale works of restoration undertaken by 
Nicolas Balanos were completed by 1933), 
but they have quietly and relentlessly creat- 
T: 40 years which have elapsed ed a series of new problems that confront 
us today. 
These problems, moreover, are so seri- 
ous that there are those who are now 
talking of the destruction of the Acropolis, 
or at least of serious and irreparable deter- 
joration of its masterpieces of classical 
architecture and sculpture. 
The problems are in fact directly related 
to the rapid and uncontrolled change in 
the environment surrounding the monu- 
ments. The last 40 years have seen enor- 
mous economic, demographic and social 
changes in Athens, converting it from a 
small peaceful city, full of reminders of its 
historical past and well-proportioned neo- 
classical buildings, into a great capital. 
In addition to 2 million inhabitants, it has 
acquired important industries, tall apart- 
ment blocks, international ports and air- 
ports, together with an increasing amount 
of environmental disturbance and pollu- 
tion. Each day increases the alienation of 
the urban landscape from the natural ter- 
rain, the landmarks of classical topogra- 
phy, and the remnants of the buildings of

) 
  
antiquity. The famous crystal-clear atmos- 
phere of Attica is covered with a pall of 
fumes; while a flood of tourists inundates 
the city, and the Acropolis in particular, 
The Greek Archeological Service has 
always worked, on a limited scale, to pre- 
serve the temples of the Acropolis, but it 
was only about 10 years ago that specialists 
became fully aware of the new conditions 
and problems. 
In June 1968, an article in the Unesco 
Courier by Georges Dontas, the Director 
responsible for the Acropolis, brought the 
disquiet felt by Greek archeologists to the 
attention of a wider public. Unesco sent 
two scientific missions to Athens: a group 
of three specialists in 1969, and a photo- 
grammetry team from the French National 
Geographic Institute in the spring of 1971. 
The real work of studying and solving 
the problems of the Acropolis, however, 
only began in February 1975, with the for- 
mation of a committee and a working 
group of specialists, archeologists and 
technical experts, and with a generous 
allocation of funds for the whole operation. 
From the outset there has been lively 
public interest in the fate of the monu- 
ments on the Acropolis. The Greeks today 
look on these buildings as the most pre- 
cious part of their architectural heritage, 
while people the world over consider them 
6 
as the finest expression of the classical 
spirit of the ancient world. 
Both the Greek Government and the 
authorities responsible for the Acropolis, 
aware of this general interest and of the 
responsibility of the scientific community 
towards the monuments, began to take 
action in earnest two years ago. At the 
international level, they appealed for funds 
to finance the rescue work, while at the 
national level they organized a thorough- 
going study of the dangers threatening 
the monuments, in order to eradicate their 
causes. Here, too, international help was 
sought, and Unesco sent another team of 
experts in October 1975. 
The problems involved in preserving the 
Acropolis and its monuments must be 
exhaustively studied before even the small- 
est stone is moved from its place. Further- 
more, any action must respect three basic 
principles: the external appearance of the 
monuments should be changed as little as 
possible; the internationally recognized 
provisions of the Charter of Venice should 
be fully observed (1); and whatever steps 
are taken should not be irreversible. 
The Acropolis rock as a whole was inves- 
tigated first by geologists and engineers, 
After exhaustive research, they were able 
to allay earlier fears that it was unstable or 
was being eroded by underground water. 
  
AR 5 VAL 
They also showed that both the natural 
bedrock and the foundations of the monu- 
ments, with the exception of the Pinako- 
thek (the north wing of the Propylaea) and 
the base of the statue of Agrippa, are in a 
good state of preservation.

Investigation of the stability of the super- 
structure of the monuments is now in pro- 
gress. All these buildings were constructed 
of blocks of white Pentelic marble, so per- 
fectly hewn and fitted together that no 
mortar was needed to bind them. Each 
building is therefore first examined as a 
whole, to detect fatigue as a result of earth- 
quakes and wind pressure, and secondly in 
detail, to establish the extent to which its 
various components (columns, capitals and 
beams) are capable of supporting a wide 
range of stresses. 
The overall examination of the monu- 
ments includes an experimental study of 
the phenomena affecting the Parthenon, 
using the modern technique of photoelasti- 
city: a 1:100 scale mode! made of epoxy. 
resin is subjected to stresses proportionate 
to those affecting the monument itself.

around the Parthenon (left). The

wind and rain for 24 centuries and 
in recent years this process has 
been greatly accelerated by air 
pollution. Sulphur dioxide 
spewed out by factories and 
central heating systems produces 
sooty crusts on the statues {below

subsequently crack the marble. 
The Greek government has 
clamped down on pollution in the 
area surrounding the Acropolis.

) Detailed investigation includes exami- 
nation of the cracks and internal hollows 
in the marble caused by earlier fires and 
iexplosions, by means of such modern tech- 
niques as ultrasonic measurements and 
gammagraphy. 
Both these techniques make it possible 
to measure the strength of the structure 
without taking samples of the building 
material itself, The first involves measuring 
the speed at which ultrasonic waves travel 
through the marble, and has already been 
used on the elements supporting the cof- 
fered ceiling of the west part of the Par- 
thenon.. 
Gammagraphy, which is being applied to 
marble for the first time, involves taking 
. photographs with gamma rays from a 
cobalt source. These rays are capable of 
penetrating the marble architectural struc- 
ture and producing a film similar to an 
X-ray. . These photographs reveal any 
cracks and internal fissures in the marble, 
and thus allow a diagnosis of the causes of 
its weakness to be made. 
The most serious cause for concern 
about the monuments on the Acropolis is 
not, however, connected with their general 
stability, but with the cracks which have 
been and which are still being caused by 
the oxidation of the iron inside the marble 
structures. 
The ancient Greeks used small iron bolts 
and clamps in their architecture, but made 
them almost rustproof by coating them 
with lead. Nicolas Balanos failed to take 
similar precautions with the steel elements 
used in his extensive restoration between 
1896 and 1933, possibly because he over- 
estimated the properties of steel. Thus, 
almost all the buildings on the Acropolis 
- had bolts inserted into them to join broken

pieces, while steel girders were used, as in 
the porch of the Caryatids on the Erech- 
theum, to reinforce architraves and ancient 
beams. 
 
All these metal parts rust because of the 
humidity of Athens and its proximity to the 
sea. Rusting not only lowers their resis- 
tance, but also causes the metal to swell 
and crack the marble into which it is em- 
bedded. A large number of fissures exist 
already, and in some places there is an 
immediate danger of collapse. 
Thorough investigation has demonstrat- 
ed that the only solution to this exception- 
ally serious problem is to remove all the 
steel elements and replace them with bolts 
of titanium, a metal that will not rust under 
any natural conditions. 
Where the plans left by Balanos provide 
inadequate information concerning the 
position of the steel elements embedded 
in the marble, they can be located by 
means of gammagraphy. 
The steel bolts and beams cannot be 
replaced without dismantling and reassem- 
bling all those parts of the monuments on 
the Acropolis which have been restored 
in the 19th and 20th centuries. A pro- 
gramme as extensive as this, which must 
Decline 
and fall

mythical 
King 
conform with the principles noted above, 
requires many years’ work, exceptional 
organization, and most important of all, 
exhaustive preliminary study. 
In addition to the compilation of all 
available information from bibliographies, 
archives and earlier reports on the build- 
ings of the Acropolis, minute documen- 
tation of these buildings began two years 
ago, including the preparation of photo- 
graphs and detailed drawings of their pre- 
sent form. In the case of the Erechtheum, 
this task is approaching completion and 
detailed proposals of the measures needed 
for the building have almost been finalized. 
In producing measured architectural 
drawings of the temples on the Acropolis, 
the technique of photogrammetry has been 
used on a limited scale. More traditional 
methods have been preferred which permit 
a diagnosis of the state of decay of each 
piece of marble, at the same time as the 
measurements are taken. 
Another cause for alarm is the deterio- 
ration of the marble surfaces and espe- 
  
Two legendary figures from Athenian 
history, Cecrops and his daughter . 
Pandrosos, are depicted in this piece of 
sculpture from the western pediment of 
the Parthenon. According to ancient 
myths Cecrops was the first king of 
Athens, around the 16th century B.C. 
Over the centuries this major work of 
Classical Greek art has suffered extensive 
erosion and by 1976 its condition was so 
serious that it was lowered from the 
pediment (left) and removed to the 
Acropolis Museum.

Testing time 
for the 
Parthenon 
cially the sculpture of almost all the monu- 
ments of the Acropolis. The surface of the 
Pentelic marble, a building material of 
splendid appearance and great strength, is 
becoming corroded and is disintegrating. 
The main cause of the trouble is the 
sulphur dioxide contained in industrial 
fumes and in smoke from central heating 
systems. The smallest degree of humidity 
is enough to let this sulphur dioxide attack 
the marble surfaces, turning them into 
gypsum. This plaster-like substance either 
dissolves in the rain and is washed away or 
else retains the soot and dust of the city to 
form an ugly crust that subsequently 
cracks. 
If one adds to this the continuous natural 
decay of the marble over a period of 24 
centuries as a result of rain, hail, wind and 
above all frost, it may easily be appreciat- 
ed why the Athenian masterpieces have for 
the past few years been facing an unprece- 
dented danger. 
The problem is obviously particularly 
acute in the case of the sculptures: the 
Caryatids of the Erechtheum, and the 
frieze and pedimental statues that are still 
on the Parthenon. 
To remedy these ills, some temporary 
measures have been proposed in addition 
to a longterm clampdown on pollution. The 
Parthenon frieze and the Caryatids are 
already protected from rain and frost by 
- relatively unobtrusive temporary wooden 
shelters, and the two statues from the west" 
pediment have been replaced by copies 
and temporarily housed in the Acropolis 
Museum. 
One proposal under consideration is that 
the Caryatids be completely enclosed in a 
transparent air-conditioned box, until the 
unavoidable task begins of dismantling 
the south portico of the Erechtheum in 
order to replace the steel reinforcements in 
its beams. 
It has also been proposed (though the 
final decision has not been taken} to trans- 
fer the Caryatids to air-conditioned rooms 
in the Museum, so that they may be res-

tored to their proper position as soon as 
environmental conditions permit. The 
copies which would take their place are 
already being cast (see back cover}. Finally 
the possibility of protecting the marble by 
treating it locally remains under consider- 
ation; in this connexion the Second Inter- 
national Symposium on the deterioration of 
building stones was held in Athens in 
September 1976. 
However, the requirement that any 
operation performed on the ancient struc- 
tures should not be irreversible has 
ruled out the use of almost all the materials 
currently employed .in building for the 
purposes of on-the-spot protection. 
The Greek Government is actively seek- 
ing a radical solution to the problem of 
the polluted atmosphere of Athens. A 
zone has been defined around the Acropo- 
lis within which it is forbidden to burn oil, 
which is rich in sulphur, in the central 
heating systems of apartment blocks. 
Meanwhile, a study has been made of 
the technical and economic problems in- 
volved in replacing oil on a wider scale by 
some other source of energy, such as 
diesel, gas or electricity. The high cost of 
‘the feet of the visitors themselves. 
this operation, which involves ‘5 million 
cubic metres of dwelling space, and the 
length of time required to implement the 
change, are now being examined by the 
city authorities. 
The feeling of space on the Acropolis has 
changed considerably since antiquity. This 
is due in great measure to the archeological 
excavations of the 19th century (mainly 
after 1885}, which exposed the bedrock at 
almost every point. These excavations 
uncovered the foundations of the buildings 
which had not been visible during the 
classical period, and made it difficult to 
walk on the surface of the rock. 
The general disorder is increased by the 
hundreds of large and small pieces of 
stonework from buildings of different 
periods, which occupy a large area of 
space and obstruct the visitor's passage. 
Finally, irreparable damage is caused by 
The

buildings, and the layout of the ancient 
pathways—all features of great interest 
—are in danger of disappearing. 
The attempt to solve this problem began 
with a careful analysis of the present situa- 
+ tion. Detailed topographical plans were 
prepared on a scale of 1:100, and photo- 
graphs were taken of the surface of the 
rock from a small balloon. An inventory 
of the scattered pieces of masonry is plan- 
ned, as well as a methodical system of 
indexing them before they are moved, so 
that they may easily be recognized and 
classified before they are put in their final 
place. 
A study has also been made of the 
possibility of covering a large area of the 
rock with soil, so as to create easy access 
to the monuments, as well as an esplanade 
to the east of the Erechtheum. 
Also being considered is the feasibility 
of moving the pieces of masonry and 
arranging them in such a way as to make 
the archeology of the Acropolis more 
readily comprehensible and to facilitate 
future research. A new ramp leading to 
the Propylaea, similar to that of ancient 
times, has also been proposed. 
Finally, a decision has been taken to 
build a large new Acropolis Museum near- 
by, with modern facilities, to exhibit all 
the finds from the Acropolis, some of 
which are at present hidden away in store- 
rooms. An architectural competition has 
been announced for the plans of this new 
museum. 
As far as the urban landscape of Athens 
and its relation to the Acropolis are concer- 
ned, some improvements can be made. 
A number of town-planning provisions 
have been put into effect: tall buildings 
can no longer be put up close to the Acro- 
polis and the neighbouring archeological 
sites. Measures have also been proposed 
for the preservation of Plaka, the old quar- 
_ ter that clusters around the lower northern 
slopes of the rock. Finally, expropriations 
of property have made it possible to re- 
open the Peripatos, a pathway for pedes- 
trians that encircled the Acropolis in 
antiquity. 
The Acropolis and its monuments have 
passed through difficult times before, 
during the course of their long history, 
and have survived to the present day with 
their ageless beauty, as a unique testimony 
to a great age in the history of Western 
civilization. In the attempt to hand on this 
cultural heritage intact to future genera- 
tions, no effort can be considered too great.

### 46720: How the Acropolis can be saved

The Porch of the Caryatids (right) was one of 
three entrances to the Erechtheum, a temple 
built to house a number of ancient 
sanctuaries. The serious problems posed by 
its conservation are now being examined by a 
team of leading Greek specialists {see also 
front and back covers). Of the six 
Caryatids —the maidens that support the 
roof —one (second from right on the facade) 
- got a face-lift in 1968-1969 (below right, before 
and after restoration). Another {photo left) is 
in fact a copy of a Caryatid which has been in 
the British Museum, London, since 1816. 
. This is the second time that a major 
conservation project has been undertaken on 
the Acropolis in the 20th century: in unusual 
photo taken in 1902 {below left), the roof of 
the Porch has been dismantled to allow steel 
girders to be inserted. Not knowing that the 
steel would eventually rust and swell, causing 
structural damage, the architect in charge 
used the same technique elsewhere on the 
Acropolis, thereby creating one of the most 
arduous problems that specialists face today. 
: Luckily, more sophisticated techniques 
are now available. One of them, 
photogrammetry, enables technicians to plot 
the precise contours of sculptures or 
monuments down to the last millimetre and 
later to reconstitute their every feature.

### 46721: Putting the clock back 24 centuries: an archeologist evokes the Acropolis as it was in antiquity

PUTTING 
THE CLOCK BACK 
24 CENTURIES 
An archeologist evokes the Acropolis 
as it was in Antiquity 
of caves in its flanks offered a safe refuge 
to its earliest inhabitants, who settled there 
during the Neolithic period, about 3500 
B.C. 
In order to form a clear picture of the 
topography of the Acropolis in the 5th 
century B.C., one must first be familiar 
with the monuments and other remains 
discovered during excavations. These 
make it possible to reconstruct the history 
of the Holy Rock from Neolithic times until 
the period when the artists of the classical 
age created a vast new overall design. 
The Parthenon, the Erechtheum, the 
Propylaea and the temple of Athena Nike 
(giver of victory) form an architectural 
ensemble that gives expression to the 
classical spirit and the perfection achieved 
by the creative artists of the 5th century 
B.C. However, they are usually examined 
by archeologists and architects as separate 
monuments. 
Until now there has been no systematic 
attempt to establish the topography of the 
Acropolis, or to map out and restore the 
ancient pathways and open spaces, so that 
the modern visitor may stroll about and 
admire the monuments, like the worshipper 
in ancient times. 
The destruction of these monuments, 
which drastically altered the appearance of 
the Acropolis, began in the 17th century 
and continued until the Greek War of Inde- 
pendence, which broke out in 1821. The 
Propylaesa was seriously damaged as the 
result of a gunpowder explosion in the 
middle of the 17th century, while the 
temple of Athena Nike was dismantled by 
the Turks shortly before a Venetian attack 
in 1687, and its masonry used to construct 
a great bastion in front of the Propylaea. 
The Parthenon was blown up by the 
Venetian Francesco Morosini in 1687, and 
the Erechtheum reduced to ruins. The 
work of destruction was completed later by 
the systematic pillaging of the sculptures 
that decorated the temples. 
With the aid of descriptions by 18th and 
19th century travellers, and old pictures 
and drawings, it is possible to imagine 
what the Acropolis looked like during the 
early years of Greek independence. 
The Holy Rock was enclosed on all sides 
by towering defensive walls of great thick- 
ness, which were particularly strong on the 
west side, in front of the Propylaea, so as 
to protect the entrance. A series of three 
bastions mounted with cannons formed a

redoubtable fortification at this point. To 
reach the Acropolis from the outer wall, it 
was necessary to pass through these 
bastions and through six well-protected 
gates. 
Inside the fortifications, the lower parts 
of the monuments were covered by mas- 
sive marble blocks from the damaged 
temples. About 300 small houses, in which 
the soldiers of the Turkish garrison lived 
with their families, were built on this layer 
of debris. 
The task of uncovering the ancient 
monuments of the Acropolis began in April 
1833, immediately after the liberation of 
Athens and the departure of the Turkish 
garrison. In August 1834, the Acropolis 
ceased, by royal decree, to serve as a 
fortress. The work was then placed on a 
systematic basis, and the first excavations 
took place. Demolition of the medieval 
buildings (dating from the Byzantine, 
Frankish and Turkish periods), many of 
which had been built over the ancient ! 
monuments, began in 1835. 
The same period saw the demolition of 
the great bastion in front of the Propylaea 
and the initial restoration of the temple of 
Athena Nike, using elements of the original 
  
structure discovered in the walls of the 
bastion. During major excavations on the 
Acropolis between 1885 and 1890, all the 
ancient monuments were uncovered and 
the site assumed the form we know today. 
The Acropolis Museum was enriched by 
the addition of many ancient sculptures, 
the famous statues of maidens called the 
Korai, the pedimental sculptures and a 
large number of architectural fragments, 
all discovered in the rubble. When the 
excavations were completed, work began 
on the restoration of the Parthenon, the 
Erechtheum and the Propylaea, while the 
second restoration of the temple of Athena 
Nike was finished just before the Second 
World War. 
The site of the Acropolis was thus inha- 
bited in Neolithic times. However, the ear- 
liest temples were erected during the so- 
called geometric period, which lasted from 
¢. 900 until c. 700 B.C. and takes its name 
from the geometric motifs which decorated 
Greek pottery produced at that time. 
By the 6th century B.C., there were two 
large temples ‘dedicated to Athena: the 
Hecatompedon, which was 100 Attic feet 
long and stood on the site subsequently 
occupied by the Parthenon, and an ancient

temple whose foundations are preserved 
to the south of the Erechtheum. The 
Acropolis was covered with other, smaller 
buildings, altars and votive monuments, 
and it was still encircled by the so-called 
Cyclopean wall which had once protected 
the palace of the Mycenean king, although 
by now it had ceased to serve as a for- 
tification. 
In.556 B.C., the highest part of the 
Mycenean tower that guarded the entrance 
to the citadel was demolished, and the 
first altar in honour of Athena Nike was 
built on this conspicuous site. The occa- 
sion for this was the consecration of the 
Panathenaea, the festival of Athens (1). 
  
{1) The Panathenaea was an annual summer festival 
celebrated by the Athenians on the birthday of Athena. 
It was eventually held every four years with special 
splendour. The celebrations at the quadrennial Great 
Panathenaea cansisted of athletic, musical and orato- 
rical contests, and culminated in the Panathenaic 
Procession along the Sacred Way up to the Parthenan 
to present the goddess with a new robe or peplos.

### 46721: Putting the clock back 24 centuries: an archeologist evokes the Acropolis as it was in antiquity

) The earlier, winding road which began 
in front of the tower of Nike and led to the 
Acropolis could no longer cater for the 
crowds that followed the Panathenaic 
Procession, and a straight ramp, 10 metres 
wide and 80 metres long, was now cons- 
tructed. The fine retaining wall {mid-6th 
century B.C.) which has survived along the 
axis of the Propylaea formed part of this 
ramp. 
After the Athenian victory at Marathon 
in 490 B.C., the Hecatompedon was demo- 
lished, and work began on the construction 
of the first marble Parthenon. At the same 
time, a monumental propylon (entrance) 
with several doors was built on the site of 
the ancient Mycenean fortified gateway. 
It was later replaced by the Propylaea that 
can be seen today. 
Such was the appearance of tne Acro- 
polis until 480 B.C., when it was captured 
and razed by the Persians, who caused 
terrible damage to the temples, shrines and 
votive monuments. Their fate was shared 
by public buildings, houses and sanctuaries 
throughout the city, whose walls were 
systematically destroyed by the invader. 
In 479 B.C., after their brilliant victories 
at Salamis and Plataea, the Athenians 
made it their first concern to build a new 
wall to protect their city and to reconstruct 
the monuments that had been destroyed. 
This building programme was brought to 
completion in the second half of the 5th 
century, under the guidance of Pericles, 
who succeeded, with the aid of inspired 
architects, sculptors and painters in pro- 
ducing the matchless masterpieces that 
still arouse our admiration today. 
Majestic temples and altars arose on the 
Acropolis to replace those destroyed by the 
Persians. The new defensive walls also ser- 
ved as retaining walls to contain the mass 
of rubble deposited on the Rock to increase 
its area and to level its surface. 
The architects who set out to rebuild the 
monuments on the Acropolis were able to 
approach the various problems confront- 
ing them with much greater freedom than 
in the lower city, where their activities 
were limited to the Agora, "the Place of 
Gathering.” 
The work which began on the Acropolis 
was based on a new architectural design: 
the Propylaea were aligned differently, a 
number of ancient shrines and altars were 
buried when the rock was levelled, and 
new pathways and open spaces were 
created. 
The Parthenon, the new temple in 
honour of Athena Parthenos {Athena the 
Virgin}, was built between 447 and 432 B.C. 
Its plans were drawn up by Ic¢tinos and 
Callicrates, and its decorative sculptures 
14 
were produced by Phidias, working in 
collaboration with other talented artists. 
The Erechtheum, an elegant lonic temple 
smaller than the Parthenon, was erected to 
replace the Old Temple of Athena at a later 
date, though still in accordance with the 
initial plans. The expressiveness and 
delicacy of its lonic style contrast sharply 
with the austere Doric style of the Par- 
thenon. 
New Propylaea (437-432 B.C.) were built 
by the architect Mnesicles on the western 
side of the Acropolis on the site of the 
earlier propylon but facing in a different 
direction. This change was made so that 
the worshipper arriving at the Acropolis 
- would be awed by the sight of the colossal 
statue of Athena Promachos (Athena the 
Warrior) standing precisely on the axis of 
the Propylaea, framed by the Parthenon to 
the right and the Erechtheum to the left. 
The Propylaea, in the austere Doric style, 
form a monumental entrance and facade to 
the sanctuary of the Acropolis. The vast 
central part, which constitutes the 
entrance, is framed by two smaller wings. 
The south wing was taken up by a sanc- 
tuary, the elegant lonic temple of Athena 
Nike. The decision to build it was taken in 
448 B.C., but construction began only in 
427 B.C., based on plans by Callicrates, 
and the temple was completed a few years 
later. The fine marble parapet decorated 
with figures of Nike {the Giver of Victory) 
was set in place around the top of the 
tower in 410 B.C. 
Inside the Acropolis, just beyond the 
Propylaea, is a large esplanade 50 metres 
long and 43 metres wide and bounded on 
each side by shrines. ‘To the south stood 
the shrine of Artemis Brauronia {the bear 
goddess) and the Chalcothek, a long rec- 
tangular building where bronze weapons 
were housed. To the north there was a 
small building, the rampart, and the house 
of the Arrephoroi, the maidens who were 
cloistered on the Acropolis for almost a 
year in order to weave the peplos of Athe- 
na. On the eastern side, the square ends at 
the retaining wall of the terrace of the Old - 
Temple of Athena, where stood the colos- 
sal statue of Athena Promachos. 
This point marked the beginning of two 
passageways, one leading to the Par- 
thenon and the other to the Erechtheum. 
The passage that led to the Parthenon, 
known as the Sacred Way, is today cover- 
ed along its entire length by ancient blocks 
of marble and other pieces of masonry. 
Both the site and the width (6 to 7 metres) 
can be determined with great accuracy, 
however, from the cuttings in the rock for 
the foundations of the two retaining walls 
on either side. One of these walls supports 
the terrace of the Parthenon and the other 
the Old Temple of Athena. 
"with precision. 
The American architect G.P. Stevens 
has advanced the theory that the retaining 
wall of the Parthenon terrace reached 
almost to the east end of the temple and 
that the Sacred Way must thus have been 
86 metres long. My own latest investiga- 
tions have shown, however, that the 
cuttings which have been preserved were 
not designed for the construction of a 
continuous retaining wall but for a series 
of dedications, which in my view formed 
the southern edge of a large sacred area. 
It is thus possible to demonstrate that 
the Sacred Way was only 54 metres long, 
and ended at the point where the inscrip- 
tion of Ge Kourotrophos {"’"Mother Earth of 
Youths’) was incised. It is at this point 
that another large square begins, the 
precise limits of which can be determined 
It was bounded on the 
south by the Parthenon and the row of 
votive monuments, on the north by the 
Erechtheum, on the east by the shrine of 
Zeus Polieus, and on the west, at least 
until the middle of the 4th century B.C., by 
the Opisthodomus (rear part) of the Qld 
Temple of Athena. 
In the centre of this vast esplanade, 
which measured 60 metres by 60 metres, 
stood the great altar of Athena. | believe 
that this was the sacred courtyard needed 
to hold the immense crowds participating 
in the Panathenaic Procession, which, as 
we know, ended at the great altar of 
Athena. 
Such in all essentials was the appearance 
of the Acropolis until the end of Antiquity. 
Later additions were few, the most impor- 
tant being the circular temple of Rome and 
Augustus which stands in front of the 
east side of the Parthenon. In the middle 
of the Ist century A.D., the ramp which led 
to the entrance to the Propylaea was also 
replaced by a monumental marble staircase. 
Thus the information recorded by the 
Greek geographer and historian Pausanias, 
who visited Athens sometime in the middle 
of the 2nd century A.D., constitutes the 
most complete and reliable source concer- 
ning the appearance of the Acropolis in 
the 5th century B.C. In his Guide to Greece 
he provides a detailed description of the 
monuments, statues and shrines which in 
his time still existed on the Holy Rock.

" against that attitude; with the discovery of- 
archaic, pre-classical art, the pendulum has 
swung the other way. 
Well-worn platitudes concerning the 
harmony, beauty and serenity of classical 
art are no longer enough, for we now know 
that the art of any society is an expression 
of the relationship between deep-seated 
contradictions. It is consequently in 
Athenian history itself that we must seek 
an interpretation of the architectural elation 
reflected in the buildings of the Acropolis. 
An initial point to be emphasized is that 
these buildings —whose celebrity is so well- 
deserved—were only a part of the great 
programme of public works initiated during 
the period of Periclean democracy. 
MANOLIS ANDRONICOS, professor of classical 
archeology at the University of Thessalonika, is the 
author of many studies on Greek archeology and his- 
tory. Among his works translated into English are: 
The Acropolis, Delphi and Olympia, all published by 
Caratzas Bros., New Rochelle, U.S.A., 1975. He also 
contributed to Greek Museums, Barrie and Jenkins, 
London, 1976.

How, indeed, can one fail to be amazed 
when one considers not only the number 
of edifices raised between 450 B.C. and 
400 B.C., but also their variety, in form 
and function alike? In Athens itself, this 
period saw the construction of such build- 
ings as the Strategion (military head- 
quarters), the new Bouleuterion (where the 
Council met), the Mint, the odeon of 
Pericles, the Pompeion, the south porch of 
the Agora, the Chalcothek (a storehouse of 
bronze implements and arms), and the 
porch of Artemis Brauronia (the bear 
goddess) on the Acropolis. 
During the same period, the first theatre 
of Dionysos was fitted out, while an abun- 
dance of religious buildings made their 
appearance, including the Parthenon, the 
Propylaea and the Temple of Athena Nike, 
the Erechtheum, the Temple of Hephaistos 
(the Theseum) and the Temple of Apollo 
Delphinios. 
This feverish activity was an outward 
expression of the inner wealth and ambi- 
tion of Athenian democracy under the 
guidance of Pericles. The combination of 
strength and equilibrium found in the forms 
of classical art constitutes an intellectual 
counterpoint to the social and political 
stability of Athens at a rare moment in 
history when deep contradictions were in a 
state of balance. 
Classical art is thus an attempt to recon- 
cile opposing tendencies which, instead 
of cancelling each other out or yielding one 
to the other, resolve their differences 
through a process of thoughtful—one 
might say “democratic” — dialogue. 
But behind this facade of harmony and 
coexistence, bold and radical forces were 
at work. Together with his friends Anaxa- 
goras the scientist, Protagoras the philo- 
sopher, Phidias the architect and sculptor, 
and Damon the musician, Pericles dreamed 
of transforming Athens into the political, 
economic and intellectual capital of Greece. 
Inspired by an enlightened patriotism, 
the Periclean circle believed that the whole 
world should rally round Athens and 
accept a supremacy that threatened neither 
friend nor enemy but was merely a fact of 
history. 
 
This outlook conditioned Pericles’ pro- 
gramme, which set as a priority the recon- 
struction of the monuments on the Holy 
Rock, symbol of the city’s age-old history 
and site of its ancestral cults. Barbarians (1) 
had burned down the ancient sanctuaries; 
here was a unique opportunity to recon- 
struct the Acropolis in its entirety. Its three 
outstanding monuments, the Parthenon, 
the Propylaea and the Erechtheum, linked 
by a relationship of function, would reflect 
through their audacious architecture the 
inventiveness of Periclean democracy. 
Indeed, the buildings of the Acropolis 
reflect more than a state of peaceful coexis- 
tence between the traditional Doric and 
lonic styles; they are a synthesis of these 
styles, brought together in an architecture 
that has no precedents. What is more, the 
Doric and lonic elements themselves trans- 
‘cend the limits of their respective traditions 
and assume a new, specifically Attic form. 
Let us look first at the gateway to the 
Acropolis, the Propylaea. Here, the archi- 
tect, Mnesicles, took the simple form of the 
propylon (a gateway sheltered on each side 
by an overhanging roof supported on two 
pillars) and composed, with a host of archi- 
tectural innovations, a matchless prelude 
to the buildings which lie beyond. The 
underlying form and its components are 
readily discernible; what is amazing is the

“imaginative and creative manner in which * 
the parts are combined in the whole without 
losing their individual value and without 
obscuring the essential purpose of the 
building. 
Equally simple and ingenious is the inner 
lonic colonnade. Vast crowds of Athenians 
were expected to visit the sanctuary; as 
much space as possible had to be reserved 
for their passage through the entrance. 
Instead, therefore, of placing the thicker 
Doric columns both outside and inside the 
portal, the architect supported the roof of 
the central passageway on the more slen- 
der lonic pillars, which could be built to the 
required height, but which took up less 
room at ground level. 
Passing through this monumental 
entrance, we find ourselves on the Holy 
Rock, face to face with its two most famous 
buildings: the Parthenon, to the south, and 
. the Erechtheum, to the north. Both are 
dedicated to the same goddess— Athena, 
the city’s patron. "Live in happiness, 
people of this city, seated beside the Virgin 
of Zeus, and return her love,” wrote Aes- 
chylus in the Eumenides. 
Pericles wished a special temple to be de- 
dicated to Athena, who was to be repre- 
sented in an incomparable manner by a 
gold and ivory statue commissioned from 
his friend Phidias. 
Athena is thus the apotheosis of the 
Athenian city-state, or rather, the expres- 
sion of its divinity. The outward appear- 
ance of the goddess matches the outward 
  
appearance of the city over whose destiny 
she presides. Her temple—as conceived 
by Pericles and his counsellors—is an 
outstanding symbol of Athens in the hey- 
day of its glory. 
The Parthenon, which is the product of 
collaboration between the architects Ictinus 
and Callicrates, under the decisive gui- 
dance of Phidias, is a building of vision, 
designed and realized with matchless 
skill. 
That the enormous amount of money 
required for its construction was collected 
in so short a time is a tribute both to the 
determination of Pericles and to the state 
of the city's finances. 
Construction began in 447 B.C. and was 
completed by 438 B.C.; a further six years 
were required for the sculptures on its 
gable ends, or pediments. 
Measuring 31x 70 metres along the top 
step of its foundations, the Parthenon is 
the largest of the Greek temples, the only 
one to be built entirely of marble and the 
only temple in the Doric style whose 
metopes (square spaces above the outside 
colonnade) of which there are 92, are all 
decorated with sculptures. 
It is not these measurements, however, 
which attract attention, but rather the 
outstanding quality of execution and the 
spirituality which emanates from the 
material elements. For the first time in 
Greek architecture, as a result of Phidias’ 
insistence that his gold and ivory statue 
must be comfortably housed, the internal

A masterpiece of the Greek Doric order 
{style} of architecture, the Parthenon also 
incorporates elements of the more 
decorative lonic style. Through these 
badly eroded Doric columns on the west 
side of the temple can be seen part of the 
superb lonic frieze, the work of the great 
sculpor Phidias, encircling the cella 
{the temple’s inner sanctum). 
volume of a temple determines its external 
form. 
The proportions of the building are based 
on the ratio known as the ‘‘golden 
section’. In the case of the Parthenon, 
the ratio is 4 : 9, reflected in the relation- 
ship between the breadth and length of the 
stylobate (the stepped foundation on 
which the columns stand); in the relation- 
ship between the diameter of the columns 
and the space between them; in that bet- 
ween the height and the width of the tem- 
ple; and in that between the numbers of 
columns on its shorter and longer sides 
(8:17). 
The columns of the Parthenon are 
unusually slender; they are set more closely 
together than is generally the case, and 
support a lighter entablature, or super- 
structure. The space between the columns 
and the walls of the temple is abnormally 
narrow (less than one-and-a-half times the 
distance between the columns themselves) 
while a second row of columns at each end 
of the building give the impression that it 
has a double peristyle. 
This dense construction on the outside 
of the temple contrasts with the space and 
calm of the interior, whose amplitude is 
underscored—in the cella, or principal 
chamber— by a transversal row of columns, 
The feeling of life inspired by the Parthe- 
non, the sense that it is indeed a living 
organism, are due to two series of refine- 
ments: the subtle adjustments made to its 
horizontal lines, which curve, and to its 
vertical lines, which are inclined. 
In fact, the horizontal lines of stylobate, 
epistyle (architrave), cornice and pedi- 
ments alike are all slightly curved, The 
stylobate, for example, which one would 
expect to be a level foundation for the 
columns, is not really level at all, but rises 
in a gentle bulge (0.11 m.} in the centre of 
each side and 0.06 m. in the middle of 
each end. 
The walls and columns, instead of being 
strictly vertical, are inclined slightly inwards. 
- The columns at the sides and the ends 
lean inwards to a distance of 7 cm., while

ed diagonally—Ilean inwards to a distance 
of 10 cm. The inner face of the walls inside 
. the colonnade is vertical, but the outer face 
is similarly inclined. Thus, the volume of 
the temple, instead of being contained by 
parallelograms, is shaped like a truncated 
pyramid. 
When we realize that each building block 
was trapezoidal and not rectangular in 
shape, and that almost every one of them 
had its own specific dimensions, since the 
curving of the horizontal lines and the 
inclination of the verticals create different 
angles and surfaces throughout the build- 
ing, the skill required to transform these 
subtleties of design into reality is well-nigh 
unbelievable. If the architects of the 
Parthenon were men of genius, the crafts- 
men responsible for the execution of the 
project had to work with the highest degree 
of precision, calculating each element in 
the minutest detail. 
The sculptures which decorate this 
matchless piece of architecture are proba- 
bly the work of Phidias himself, helped by 
his two closest collaborators, Alcamen and 
Agoracritos. The decorations are both 
grandiose and original; those on the east- 
ern pediment represent the birth of Athena 
in a composition which combines strength 
with nobility. Those at the western end 
relate the Attic legend of the contest 
between Athena and Poseidon (the sea- 
god) for possession of the city. 
The 92 square metopes above the colon- 
nade illustrate four cycles of myths, in- 
volving the combats of Gods and Giants, 
of the Centaurs and the Lapiths, of 
Greeks and Amazons, and the capture of 
Troy. Pediments and metopes alike thus 
provided Phidias with the opportunity 
of re-telling, in a manner that was unique, 
the ancient myths of Athena and the land 
of Attica. 
Inspired by the vision of Athenian demo- 
cracy at the height of its glory, Phidias 
22 
conceived the ingenious idea of immorta- 
lizing in marble the people of Athens them- 
selves. He would portray for posterity the 
joyous occasion when the whole city—old 
men and boys, women and maidens alike — 
mingled with the gods for the great Pana- 
thenaic Procession, Athens’ biggest festi- 
val, and climbed the Holy Rock with offer- 
ings and with the new saffron robe, the 
peplos, woven to drape the xoanon, an 
ancient statue of Athena carved from the 
wood of the olive-tree. 
A friend of Pericles and of the philoso- 
pher Anaxagoras, Phidias believed that his 
representation of the old Attic legends 
should be accompanied by the new 
achievements of democracy. 
But Phidias was a sculptor, not an ora- 
tor, and it is difficult to transform pane- 
gyrics into images. The task required all 
"his genius, experience and audacity as one 
of the leading artists of his time. 
The vision demanded a greater spread 
of space than pediments and metopes 
could provide; what was wanted for his 
composition was a continuous frieze. 
Boldly, Phidias decided to add to his Doric 
temple this element of the lonic style, in 
the form of a band, 160 metres in length 
and 1.60 metres high, running round the 
temple walls. 
This frieze should not be considered as 
a. realistic portrayal of the Panathenaic 
procession. The composition is above all 
a poetic one, the translation of a sacred 
occasion into plastic terms. ‘Real’ space 
and ‘real’’ time have been abolished here: 
the participants in the Panathenaea advan- 
. ce with a rhythm imposed by the sculptor 
in an environment of “poesy’”. The pro- 
_ cession becomes a symphony, in the mu- 
sical sense of the term. Reality, religion 
and art are interwoven. 
As if following the procession in space 
and time, Phidias sets its beginning at the 
southwest corner of the temple, and takes

it round the building to the east door. But 
this is really a pretext for the movements 
of his symphony, which opens pianissimo, 
with simple harmonies and the introduction - 
of the major themes such as the rearing 
horse on the eighth carved slab of the 
western end and the escort of horsemen 
on the north and south sides of the temple. 
On these carved slabs, the art of sculp- 
ture in relief achieves perfection: six or 
seven horsemen are represented with re- 
markable clarity on different planes. The 
rhythmic procession continues towards the : 
centre of the east end, where the Gods 
have already arrived.

### 46725: Athenian democracy's grand design

The temple of victory 
The elegant temple of Athena Nike {Athena Bringer of Victory} 
stands on a precipitous platform at the western edge of the 
Acropolis {far left). In Antiquity the temple was protected by a 
parapet of marble slabs executed in high-relief. The surviving 
slabs, which show scenes of winged victories at various tasks, 
include this graceful figure of Victory adjusting her sandal {left) 
Right, youth bearing an amphora, detail from the great 
Parthenon frieze in which Phidias depicted the Athenians in 
procession at the festival honouring the birthday of Athena. 
Although carved on a relatively small 
scale—they measure only one metre in 
height—the gods are impressive figures. 
‘Seated at ease, with ample space around 
them, they convey an atmosphere of 
freedom and well-being, as if in the sur- 
roundings of their distant home on Mount 
Olympus. ” 
In the influence which he exerted on his 
own and succeeding ages, Phidias was to 
classical art what Pericles was to Athenian 
democracy. Under the imprint of his 
genius, the art of modelling transcended 
its limitations to become a vehicle for 
spiritual, religious and political messages 
of the highest order. It became the visible

and eternal embodiment of divinity at its 
most imperceptible and transcendent, of 
man himself in full assumption of his res- 
ponsibility and freedom and—finally— of 
the city at peace with itself, immune from 
both anarchy and despotism. 
Opposite the Parthenon, on the north 
_ side of the Acropolis, stands the second 
of its most famous temples, the Erech- 
theum. Though dedicated to Athena Po- 
lias, the goddess of the city, the building 
was imbued with a religious significance 
that outstripped the limits of the traditional 
cult, It went deeper than the roots of the 
traditional faith into the soil of Attica, 
the medium which brought into communi- 
cation with each other all the divinities and 
demons which presided over the destiny of 
the citizens of Athens. 
From time immemorial, a temple had 
sheltered the xoanon, the wooden image of 
Athena which had supposedly fallen from 
heaven. The primitive cults of Attica were 
also worshipped there. The Persians had 
destroyed this ancient temple. Although 
Pericles had died before the work of re- 
construction began in 421 B.C.,, it is certain 
that the plans for a new building worthy of 
the cults it was to house had been prepar- 
ed, and the site chosen, before his death. 
The new temple was constructed a little 
to the north of its predecessor, at a respect- 
ful distance from the Parthenon. Besides 
housing the most venerable cults of Athens 
—those of Athena and Poseidon—the tem- 
ple included among its furnishings the 
tomb of Erechtheus (son of Gaea, goddess 
of the earth, represented as half-man, half- 
serpent} and the sacred serpent; and the 
tombs of Cecrops, founder and first king 
of Athens, and of the Athenians’ earliest 
ancestors. 
It also contained the mark where Posei- 
don’s trident struck the rock so that a salt 
water spring known as the ‘‘Erechtheis 
sea” leapt from the cleft. Room had to 
be found not only for the altars of Zeus, 
 
Poseidon, Hephaistos, and the ancient 
xoanon of Hermes, but also for the city's 
sacred olive tree and the sanctuary of 
Pandrosos (daughter of Cecrops and pries- 
tess of Athena) containing the altar of 
Zeus Herkeios. 
Despite all these difficulties, the resultant 
building, which resembles no other temple 
in Greece, was of a skilful simplicity that 
met all the above requirements. 
Without departing from tradition, its 
architect was able to introduce a number 
of strikingly apt innovations, such as the 
elegant loggia which projects from the 
southern part of the temple, where the 
Caryatids courageously support the weight 
of the entablature without sacrificing any 
of their feminine grace and charming 
nobility. 
The lonic grace of the Erechtheum con- 
stitutes a discreet yet captivating pendant 
to the Doric power and splendour of the 
Parthenon. Centuries later, contemplating 
these eternally fresh examples of Attic 
art at its most glorious, Plutarch, one of the 
last of the ancient Greeks to appreciate his 
country’s classic past, was to sum up the 
feelings they inspired as follows (from 
“Lives of the Noble Grecians and 
'Romans"”, translated by Sir Thomas North, 
1579. See also page 26}: 
"For every one of those works which 
were finished up at that time seemed then 
to be very ancient and yet it looketh at his 
daye as if it were but newly done and finish- 
ed, there is suche a certaine kvnde of flor- 
ishing freshness in it, which letteth that the 
injurie of time cannot impaire the sight 
thereof: As if every one of those foresaid 
workes had some living spirite in it, to 
make it seeme young and fresh: and a 
soule that lived ever, which kept them in 
their good continuing state...”

### 46728: A Citadel in praise of peace

A citadel 
In praise 
of peace 
HE Athenians began to build the 
i monuments that can be seen on the 
Acropolis today shortly after they 
made peace with Persia in 449 B.C. 
Thirty years before, the Persian King, 
Xerxes, had set out to conquer Greece. 
Twice during the Persian campaign, the 
Acropolis was captured and destroyed by 
fire: in 480 by Xerxes himself, and in 497 by 
his general Mardonius. 
A year after the peace treaty was signed, 
Pericles, the leader of the democratic party 
and the most important figure in Athenian 
politics after Themistocles, called on all the 
Greeks to hold a conference at which they 
could decide jointly on the reconstruction 
of the shrines destroyed by the enemy. 
This conference never took place, and 
the Athenians began the work of recon- 
struction on their own in 447 B.C. In 445 
a Thirty-Year Truce was declared between 
Athens and Sparta and this favoured the 
rapid progress of the enterprise. 
The first task was to rebuild the temple 
of Athena, the Parthenon. Work then 
began on the Propylaea, but it was inter- 
rupted by the outbreak of the Peloponne- 
sian War between Athens and Sparta in 
431 B.C. Lastly, the Athenians tackled the 
construction of the temple of Athena Nike 
and the Erechtheum, which they built on a 
site believed to have been occupied by the 
palace of the mythical King Erechtheus. 
As both an official centre of worship and 
a citadel, as well as a place which evoked a 
large number of precious traditions, the 
Acropolis was of supreme importance to 
the Athenians. It was the ancient city, the 
immemorial seat of kings, demi-gods and 
strange legendary creatures like the dual 
figure of Erechtheus-Erichthonius, who 
was both man and snake. 
In the 6th century B.C., it had been the 
seat of the tyrant” Pisistratus and his 
successors. The chorus of old men in 
Aristophanes’ comedy Lysistrata tells how 
the people of Athens ousted the tyrants 
with the help of the Spartan king Cleo-

menes |, and then expelled Cleomenes 
himself, who had set up a puppet govern- 
ment in their place. 
In the Lysistrata, the people reminisce on 
these events with great pride, for at the 
time when the play appeared, in 411 B.C., 
democracy was in danger: the Athenians 
had just suffered a disastrous defeat in 
Sicily. 
 
About a hundred years earlier, in 506 
B.C., the young Athenian democracy had 
erected its first trophy in a prominent place 
beside the entrance to the Acropolis. The 
trophy took the form of a bronze four-horse 
chariot made from spoils abandoned on the 
battlefield by Athens’ northern neighbours, 
the Beeotians, and by the Chalcidians, who 
shared the aristocratic ideology of Sparta

### 46728: A Citadel in praise of peace

  
THE GODDESS ATHENA was worshipped throughout the Greek world. Usually depicted 
with helmet, spear and shield, she was also the personification of wisdom and patroness 
of all arts and crafts. Head of Athena, above, is a detail from the Battle of the Giants, a 
group of figures that once adorned the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis {c. 525 B.C.). 
Only the foundations of the temple remain. Left, magnificent bronze statue of the goddess 
with outstretched hand was found in 1959 at the Piraeus, the port of Athens. 
and had invaded Athens in a vain attempt 
to overthrow the new democracy. 
It is significant that the inscription on 
the base of the chariot does not give credit 
for the victory to any specific military or 
political leader, but simply to the “sons of 
Athens”. This is a rare example of a monu- 
ment to victory that mentions no names, 
but only the anonymous soldiers who made 
the triumph possible. It expresses the pride 
which the people of Athens took in their 
newborn democracy, and its site reflects 
their profound love for the Acropolis, for 
their “city” as it was called in all simplicity 
by the chorus in the Lysistrata, 
The Athenians had already revealed 
their devotion to the sacred place in 480 
B.C., as they prepared to meet the Persian 
threat. As they waited for the enemy, they 
disagreed about the correct interpretation 
of the Delphic oracle, which had proph- 
esied that they would be saved by “"wood- 
en walls”. Herodotus tells how the old 
guard —elderly men who were still fit 
enough for battle to make things difficult 
for Xerxes —dug themselves in behind the 
waqoden palisades of the Acropolis. 
The other warriors followed Themisto- 
cles, agreeing with the view of the majority 
that the “wooden walls’’ referred to by the 
oracle meant the strong navy which the 
Athenians had mustered on Themistocles’ 
advice during the previous ten years, 
But before embarking on the triremes 
(galleys with three banks of oars) in which - 
they were to serve as hoplites or ordinary 
foot-soldiers, the Athenian cavalrymen 
rode to the Acropolis and hung up their 
reins as an offering to the goddess Athena. 
When the war was over, Themistocles, 
the architect of victory, made it his first 
priority to fortify the Acropolis. Even 
today, massive blocks of stone from the 
temples and shrines burned down by the 
Persians can be seen in the upper part of 
its northern wall, They served as a constant 
reminder of the conquerors’ desecrations. 
There were many reasons why military 
architecture should have been given top 
priority. In 477 B.C., a powerful alliance 
known as the Delian League was formed 
under the leadership of Athens. Initially the 
League was a purely defensive alliance, but 
it soon embarked on a policy of aggression 
and expansion which caused dissensions 
and led to armed confrontation between 
the allies. 
There followed a six-year Egyptian 
campaign, during which the Athenians

the Persians and gain control over that 
wealthy and fertile country. At about the 
same time, they came to grips with Sparta

and her allies in a bid for hegemony over 
the whole of mainland Greece. 
As a result of these military activities, the 
Athenians put all their efforts into fortifying 
the city. The most important of their pro- 
jects was the construction of the Long 
Walls, which transformed the area stretch- 
ing from the Acropolis in the west to the 
port of Piraeus in the south and to Phaleron 
in the north into one vast fortified triangle. 
The fact that the Acropolis itself was 
neglected for over three decades after the 
great Greek victories and the Persian 
retreat is an indication of Themistocles’ 
realism and efficiency in organizing and co- 
ordinating the economic, foreign and 
military policy of Athens. He saw that the 
best way to extend Athenian sovereignty 
was to consolidate Athenian sea-power, 
This neglect of the Acropolis also reveals 
the extent of the ambitions harboured by 
the young men in Pericles’ radical party 
who came to power in 462 B.C., after 
Kimon, the leader of the aristocratic party, 
had turned the Aegean into an Athenian 
sea after his victory at the River Eurymedon 
on the coast of Asia Minor in 468. These 
ambitions went far beyond the expansion- 
ist dreams and plans of their political 
predecessors, and they kept the city in a 
state of war against both Persia and Sparta 
for more than 10 years. 
Athens finally made peace with Persia in 
449 B.C., and with Sparta four years later. 
At last the Athenians could devote them- 
selves to the reconstruction of the Acro- 
polis. } ’ 
Like Pericles’ famous funeral oration in 
honour of the men who perished during 
the first year of the Peloponnesian War, 
but to an even greater degree, the Par- 
thenon was the result of a passionate 
search for an act of faith. A similar search, 
informed by the same passion, took place 
during the same period in the Athenian 
theatre, 
The monuments on the Acropolis and 
the great plays performed in the theatre 
of Dionysus at the foot of the Rock have 
often been presented as the artistic expres- 
sion of a people at the height of its glory, 
demonstrating its pride in victory. 
Yet it should be remembered that victory 
preceded the sculptural and architectural 
masterpieces on the Acropolis by more 
than 30 years—a whole generation. The 
history of this hard-working, tenacious 
generation and of their grim struggles 
between the Persian Wars and the "Thirty- 
Year Truce” with Sparta, reveals in much 
clearer perspective the meaning of the 
monuments built on the Acropolis during 
the Golden Age. For these monuments 
were, In fact, dedicated to the defeated as 
well as to the victors, 
‘They undoubtedly reflect the victory 
over the Persians, which gave the Athen- 
ians the independence and power to res- 
tore on their city’s sacred site monuments 
which expressed more perfectly than be- 
fore their political freedom, their convic- 
tions and their aims. 
But these monuments also reflect the 
Athenians’ sense of defeat in their first 
headlong confrontation with history—a 
defeat that came after 50 years of military 
preparations and struggles, first for the 
survival of Athens and Greece as a whole, 
and then for the extension and consoli- 
dation of their civilization. 
These long and arduous struggles seem 
to have filled the Athenians with amaze- 
ment at the infinite prospects opening up

before them in their new role as masters of 
the Aegean Sea. But they had also expe- 
rienced doubt and disappointment. So 
many projects had ended tragically, their 
outcome being left to the mercy of Chance, 
the new goddess of adventurers, rather 
than to knowledge and experience. 
One cannot help wondering what the 
Athenian craftsmen, seeking as they did 
nothing less than perfection, must have 
‘thought of the disastrous blunders commit- 
ted by the sorcerers’ apprentices of the 
expansionist policy. 
For all those magnificent artists and for 
the multitude of clear-sighted Athenian 
men and women, the Parthenon represent- 
ed a kind of home-coming, a return to 
Ithaca after a nightmarish Odyssey outside 
the tranquil confines of traditional life, It 
was a return to a reality they could manage 
and control, using clean, hard materials 
they could trust, unlike the bloodstained, 
treacherous stuff of History. 
For History had taught the Athenians 
some cruel lessons. There had been bloo- 
dy, inglorious defeats, such as the disaster 
at Drabescus in 465 B.C., when 10,000 
men, women and children (an enormous 
number, considering the population of 
Athens at the time) were sent to Thrace to 
found a colony and were virtually annihilat- 
ed by the indigenous population. 
There had been disasters in Egypt, 
where the Athenians fought for six conse- 
cutive years (460-454 B.C.). Disaster at 
Tanagra in Boeotia, where the Athenians 
were routed by the Spartans and Boeotians 
in 458 B.C. and suffered the humiliation 
of seeing their victors set up an arrogant 
memorial, in the form of a gold shield made 
from the Athenian spoils, on the newly- 
built temple of Olympia. 
Disaster struck again in 447 B.C. At 
Koroneia in Beeotia, many Athenian volun- 
teers —most of them scions of noble fami- 
lies—perished along with their general, 
Tomides, and Cleinias, the father of Alci- 
biades, in an ambitious attempt to extend 
Athenian sovereignty to the fertile regions 
on the mainland north of Athens. 
Another spectacular failure had been the 
deterioration of relations between the 
Athenians and their allies in the islands and 
coastal regions of the Aegean. Many of 
these allies renounced their treaties with 
Athens and fought to regain their indepen- 
dence. The toll in human lives was high 
and opened a deep rift of hatred between 
the allied cities. 
When their great victories over the 
Persian empire had opened the way to 
mastery of the Aegean, the Athenians had 
been faced with a difficult choice. Now 
they were seized with doubts as to the 
rightness of the historical course they had 
chosen. 
Sculpture in marble is an austere art that 
admits no mistakes. As in politics, a false 
move cannot be erased. But the Parthenon 
was built by craftsmen who had complete 
mastery of their material and who could 
match the finished work to the design they 
had in mind with absolute precision, After 
the harsh lessons of History, these men 
must have felt a profound need for consis- 
tency and coherence. 
26 
The Parthenon was built in a spirit of 
ruthless perfectionism according to a plan 
that anticipated and forestalled any alte- 
rations that might prove necessary when it 
emerged on the actual site, and was con- 
fronted with the surrounding landscape, 
the horizon, the encircling mountains and 
the bright sunlight. 
The Parthenon reveals the sense of 
poetry of the Athenian people, who found 
artistic and intellectual inspiration in the 
Attic countryside bathed in its unique 
limpid light. 
But it also shows how the ordeal result- 
ing from their society's radical change of 
direction and from the disasters caused by 
its expansionist dreams finally found 
expression in a passion for artistic per- 
fection. 
The monuments on the Acropolis express 
for all time that yearning for an end to the 
kind of historical opportunism and expan- 
sionist aberrations which Euripides casti- 
gates in the Hippolytus, when Aphrodite 
and Theseus wrathfully claim obedience 
from obstinate and foolish men. 
The harmonious relationship between 
the Parthenon and its environment holds a 
lesson that impresses itself on the mind 
without rhetoric or exaggeration. It is 
noteworthy that the symbol to which the 
advocates of power politics attached most 
importance, the gold and ivory statue of 
the goddess Athena in full war attire, was 
hidden away in the inner part of the temple. 
In seeking and achieving this harmonious 
relationship with the surrounding land- 
scape, the inspired artists of Sth-century 
Athens were actually finding their way 
back to their origins, back to the reality 
which their own land offered them. The 
Parthenon and the other monuments on 
the Acropolis guided the Athenian back to 
his familiar horizon, enclosed by the islands 
of Aegina and Salamis, making him feel 
that what he saw before him was good and 
beautiful. 
The Parthenon high on its rock and the 
tragic and comic poets in the theatre of 
Dionysus below each in their own way 
celebrated peace. - 
In 431 B.C., the year in which the Pelo- 
ponnesian War broke out, Euripides prais- 
ed in his Medea the rare gifts and incompa- 
rable destiny of the Athenians and their 
divine fortune in possessing such a land 
beneath such a sky. There is no mention of 
courage nor military valour, nor of great 
conquests. 
Euripides simply celebrates the blessed 
land of Harmony and the nine Muses. This 
is no facile phrase-making but a confession 
of faith, the affirmation of a conscious 
choice, a vote for peace: 
The people of Athens, sons of 
Erechtheus, 
have enjoyed their prosperity 
Since ancient times. Children of blessed 
gods, 
They grew from holy soil unscorched by 
invasion. 
Among the glories of knowledge their 
souls are pastured; 
They walk always with grace under the 
sparkling sky. 
There long ago, they say, was born 
golden-haired Harmony, 
Created by the nine virgin Muses of 
Pieria. 
They say that Aphrodite dips her cup 
In the clear stream of the lovely Cephisus; 
. It is she who breathes over the land the 
breath 
Of gentle honey-laden winds; her flowing 
locks 
She crowns with a diadem of sweet- 
scented roses, 
And sends the Loves to be enthroned 
beside Knowledge, 
And with her to create excellence in 
every art. 
Then how will such a city, 
Watered by sacred rivers, 
How will Athens welcome 
You, the child-killer 
Whose presence is pollution? 
Contemplate the blow struck at a child, 
Weigh the blood you take upon you, 
Medea, by your knees, 
By every pledge or appeal we beseech 
you, 
Do not slaughter your children!

This choice is also apparent in the monu-

their every detail. It emphasizes the impor-

### 46728: A Citadel in praise of peace

### 47919: Pericles as seen by Plutarch

Skilful horsemanship 
was held in high esteem 
by the Athenians, At 
the city’s Panathenaic 
Games, held in honour 
of Athena, jockeys 
showed their prowess 
in fiercely competitive 
horseback and chariot 
races. All the nobility 
of horses is expressed in 
this spirited head from a 
marble statue in the 
Acropolis Museum. It 
was carved by a Greek 
artist c. 490-480 B.C. 
  
Parthenon is its most eloquent illustration. 
Starting from the western side, the 
procession moves along the north and 
south sides to the eastern front of the 
temple where the gods sit peacefully, 
welcoming the Athenian citizens. No such 
democratic representation can be found 
elsewhere, at Olympia, for example. 
Inside the temple stood Phidias’ gold and 
ivory statue of Athena, the formidable ally 
of her people—colossal in proportion to 
the high ceiling, and therefore superhuman 
in the eyes of men. Outside, the gods, 
shown as rivals on the western pediment, 
are transformed on the eastern pediment 
and the frieze into peaceful subjects of the 
primeval Mother Earth, restraining man 
from the temptations of overweening pride 
and violence.

Athens has been equipped with all she needs to carry on the 
war, she should apply the surplus to public works, which, 
once completed, will bring her glory for all time, and while they are 
being built will convert that surplus to immediate use. In this way 
all kinds of enterprises and demands will be created which will 
provide inspiration for every art, find employment for every hand, 
and transform the whole people into wage-earners, so that the 
city will decorate and maintain herself at the same time from her 
own resources.” 
Certainly it was true that those who were of military age and 
physically in their prime could always earn their pay from the public 
funds by serving on Pericles’ various campaigns. But he was also 
anxious that the unskilled masses, who had no military training, 
should not be debarred from benefiting from the national income, 
and yet should not be paid for sitting about and doing nothing. 
So he boldly laid before the people proposals for immense 
_ public works and plans for buildings, which would involve many 
different arts and industries and require long periods to complete, 
his object being that those who stayed at home, no less than those 
serving in the fleet or the army or on garrison duty, should be 
enabled to enjoy a share of the national wealth. 
The materials to be used were stone, bronze, ivory, gold, 
ebony, and cypress-wood, while the arts or trades which wrought 
or fashioned them were those of carpenter, modeller, coppersmith, 
stone-mason, dyer, worker in gold and ivory, painter, embroiderer, 
and engraver, and besides these the carriers and suppliers of the 
materials, such as merchants, sailors, and pilots for the sea-borne 
traffic, and waggon-makers, trainers of draught animals, and 
drivers for everything that came by land. 
So the buildings arose, as imposing in their sheer size as they 
were inimitable in the grace of their outlines, since the artists 
strove to excel themselves in the beauty of their workmanship. 
And yet the most wonderful thing about them was the speed with 
which they were completed. Each of them, men supposed, would 
take many generations to build, but in fact the entire project was 
carried through in the high summer of one man’s administration. 
On the other hand we are told that when Zeuxis the painter 
1 T is no more than fair”, Pericles told the Athenians, "that after once heard Agatharchus boasting about how swiftly he painted 
his figures, his retort was, “Mine take, and last, a long time’’. 
Certainly mere dexterity and speed of execution seldom give a 
lasting value to a work of art or bestow a delicate beauty upon it. 
It is the time laid out in laborious creation which repays us later 
through the enduring strength it confers. 
It is this, above all, which makes Pericles’ works an object of 
wonder to us—the fact that they were created in so short a span, 
and yet for all time. Each one possessed a beauty which seemed 
venerable the moment it was born, and at the same time a youthful 
vigour which makes it appear to this day as if it were newly built. 
A bloom of eternal freshness hovers over these works of his and 
preserves them from the touch of time, as if some unfading spirit 
of youth, some ageless vitality had been breathed into them. 
The Propylaea, or portals of the Acropolis, of which Mnesicles 
was the architect, were finished in the space of five years. While 
they were being built, a miraculous incident took place, which 
suggested that the goddess Athena herself, so far from standing 
aloof, was taking a hand and helping to complete the work. 
One of the workmen, the most active and energetic among 
them, slipped and fell from a great height. He lay for some time 
severely injured, and the doctors could hold out no hope that he: 
would recover. 
Pericles was greatly distressed at this, but the goddess 
appeared to him in a dream and ordered a course of treatment, 
which he applied, with the result that the man was easily and 
quickly healed. It was to commemorate this that Pericles set up 
the bronze statue of Athena the Healer near the altar dedicated to 
that goddess, which they say was there before. 
But it was Phidias who directed the making of the great 
golden statue of Athena, and his name is duly inscribed upon the 
marble tablet on the Acropolis as its creator. Almost the whole 
enterprise was in his hands, and because of his friendship with 
Pericles all the artists and craftsmen came under his orders.

Ancient Greek architecture suddenly came 
back into vogue around 1815-1820. From 
then on up to recent times, the style known 
as ‘neo-Greek’ was used in many public 
buildings, particularly in Europe and the 
United States. On this page we present 
examples of these monuments, some faith- 
ful copies, some pastiches of Athenian 
models. 
Unlike the ""neo-Classical” style in favour 
in the 18th century, the neo-Greek style 
relied on precise archeological data. The 
Parthenon in Nashville (photo 1), inaugurat- 
ed in 1931, is an exact-size replica of the 
original building. 
Pierre-Yves Balut, a French art historian 
teaching at the Sorbonne University in Paris, 
is making a compilation of these buildings. 
Some of them, he notes, display ‘a return 
to ancient techniques and aesthetic canons.

both of which have been studied in detail 
and perfectly reproduced.” 
The Munich Propylaea (photo 2), built 
between 1832 and 1862, even include a 
reproduction of the pathway that the ancient 
Greeks had been obliged to dig through the 
steeply sloping side of the Acropolis so that 
the chariots in the Panathenaic Procession 
could pass. For the Walhalla at Ratisbon 
(photo 3), erected between 1830 and 1842, 
the builders even imitated the ancient Greek 
technique of stone-fitting without mortar. 
The Caryatids of St. Pancras Church in 
London (photo 4), those of the Faculty of 
Medicine in Paris (photo 5) and those of the 
Parliament in Vienna (photo 6) are a far cry 
from the perfection attained in Antiquity. 
Yet perfect or not, these neo-Greek build- 
ings testify to what Mr. Balut calls “the 
eternal fascination in the West for the long- 
lost days of its infancy”’

A cluster of roofs surrounds the 
blasted shell of the Parthenon in 
this early 19th-century depiction 
of the Acropolis by the English

temples of antiquity, half-buried 
in rubble, are lost in a maze of 
village lanes. In 1833, a local

ries, from the twilight of Antiquity till 
the dawn of the Romantic Age, the 
Acropolis was quite absent from the mind

During the long period before its discov- 
ery, or rather, rediscovery, the Acropolis 
did not, of course, really cease to exist. On 
the contrary, old engravings and the tales 
of the earliest travellers show it to be a 
busy, crowded place, cluttered with 
houses, with churches and—at a later 
date—with mosques. 
There on the Rock, in a hubbub of his- 
tories, customs and facades, so different 
from today’s bright emptiness, a bustling 
population of Greeks, then Turks, Arme- 
nians and Albanians lived out their lives and 
loves. For hundreds of years, these "“Acro- 
politans” {a name we may give them for the 
sake of simplicity} were its only occupants,

A number of engravings, which deserve 
to be better known, reveal to us this long- 
lost age, and tell its strange, forgotten 
story. Let us look, for example, at those 
made from drawings by "’Athenian’’ Stuart, 
from Edinburgh, and the Englishman 
Revett, who travelled together in Greece 
between 1751 and 1753, and who saw the 
Acropolis in the state we have described. 
A patchwork of houses, stitched with 
narrow, winding lanes, and gardens graced 
with olive and mimosa covers the whole 
site, from the Propylaea at its entrance to 
the far end of the Parthenon, which is 
itself hemmed in by walls and screened 
with branches. Inside the temple gleam the 
cupolas of a Turkish mosque; it will remain

there for many years to come, and only 
disappear in 1842. 
Another engraving shows the Erech- 
theum, and beyond it a large house, from 
whose walled courtyard prods a single 
cypress. The ancient temple seems to 
have become a place of meditation: under 
its porch—lower than it is today because 
not yet excavated—an Acropolitan sits 
cross-legged and gazes dreamily at the sky. 
Close at hand, in the streets and square of 
what might be a village, stroll men in tur- 
bans; children play, dogs sniff, and a 
horseman crosses in the background. 
Fifty years later, in 1805 or thereabouts, 
when Edward Dodwell, another English 
.traveller whose remarkable series of Views 
in Greece from Drawings will be published 
in London in 1821, paints the Acropolis, 
the scene has hardly changed. The houses 
on the Rock are still set in walled court- 
yards shaded by olive trees and slender 
cypresses. A large building (a barracks or a 
warehouse?) flanks the north side of the 
Parthenon. Turkish noblemen and shep- 
herds idle the hours away under the dazzl- 
ing Attic sunlight, its brilliance stippled 
with the red of tiled roofs. 
Now there can be no mistake: this is 
indeed a village and not a temple or a 
shrine—a real village, captured by the 
painter in its hours of bustle and of sun- 
drenched silence, with its braying, bleating 
animals, its market, its bazaar. Here, now, 
the ancient gods are dead beyond recall; 
the only remaining trace of their presence is 
in these half-buried columns, these toppled 
marble heads and busts which the Acrop- 
olitans sometimes use as seats. 
Many other pilgrims saw and described 
the Acropolis thus transmogrified: the 
Oriental village, the improvised fortress, 
the bazaar littered with marble blocks and 
' statues. Their accounts and their engrav- 
ings all tell the same reassuring and yet 
melancholy story. 
They tell us that the Acropolis was not 
lost to history throughout all these obscure 
centuries, but that it humbly survived, as 
village, citadel and market-place; that the 
Parthenon was saved from abandon and 
ruin to become a church dedicated to the 
Mother of God, and then a Turkish 
mosque. 
They tell us that a daily life that was first 
Greek and then Turkish in content, first 
Christian and then Muslim in belief, per- 
sisted on the Holy Rock of the Ancient 
Greeks, in the stronghold of the Byzan- 
tines and in the fortress of the War of 
Independence. 
| like to think that in this way, throughout 
a long history that has been sacred as well 
as profane (since gods, or a single God, 
have always been worshipped there), the 
Acropolis has remained true to its ancient 
vocation, nurturing in its own way the 
same sacred and profane spirit that moved | 
with the crowds through its statue-lined 
streets, among its altars and its trophies, 
during the Golden Age of Pericles. 
Today's Acropolitans are the tourists. 
Archeology is the new faith and arche- 
ologists are the priests of the new cult. 
After so many centuries of obscurity, | 
30 
cannot but reflect on the strange destiny 
of a site which —resurfacing barely a cen- 
tury ago in Western consciousness, re- 
emerging as the birthplace of Reason 
after 25 centuries of neglect—is once again 
threatened. 
Although it served as market-town, 
fortress and refuge for religions, and 
although its ruins remained eloquent, the 
Acropolis was for so long a backwater, 
leading a withdrawn, meditative and pro- 
vincial life. 
Today, as a place of pilgrimage for those 
in quest of culture, it retransmits the newly 
transparent message of the ages, the time- 
worn brilliance of its marbles, the purity of 
this flat-topped hill, to which excavations 
and the clearance of rubble have restored 
the naked virginity of its primeval rock 
(yellowed in autumn by tufts of camo- 
miles—for there are flowers on the Acro- 
polis for those who know where to look). 
But there is also the thoughtless immo- 
deration of its crowds of visitors.... 
Although the long silence has suddenly 
been broken by tumult, the Acropolis 
remains an enigma, questioning us as the 
Sphinx questioned Oedipus. Whether we 
look at it at dawn, at midday or in the 
evening twilight, whether we contemplate 
the interplay of light and shadow at the 
beginning or the end of things, we seem to 
hear the same voice quietly asking: “Who 
built me as the sun rose on the Western 
world? Who perfumed me with incense as 
it passed through the zenith of Reason? 
Who protected me during the twilight of

Man’, is the answer. And not only 
Attic man, but man come out of the East, 
and out of the West, to live together, 
* throughout all the forgotten centuries, on 
this incomparable rock. 
The monument of the Acropolis which 
has always been my favourite is the little 
temple of Athena Nike (the Giver of Vic- 
tory), which stands at its westward end, 
facing the sea and the setting sun. 
Once, it sheltered a statue of the god- 
dess, carved from an olive trunk, standing 
upright, holding out in her right hand a 
fruit, a pomegranate. This statue no longer 
exists; it had already disappeared when the 
rock was occupied by the Acropolitans of 
our story. 
And yet it is in this long-lost statue that 
| see the clearest and most lasting symbol 
of the essential agelessness of the site and 
of the rock: this Victory carved from an 
olive-tree, offering to all eternity the most 
ephemeral of fruits. 
This symbol, t00, the olive-tree grafted 
by human hands, this gesture of offering, 
of certainty and light, is part of the heritage 
of all mankind.

### 47925: Aristotle: an architect of modern thought 2,300 years ago

Aristotle 
An architect 
of modern thought 
2,300 years ago 
by Constantine Despotopoulos 
ORE than any other thinker, Aris- 
M totle has influenced philoso- 
phical and scientific thought in 
Europe, in the non-European countries of 
the Mediterranean basin, and in all those 
whose cultures are fashioned on European 
lines. 
This influence, whether direct or indirect, 
has been felt by thinkers as diverse as Karl 
‘Marx, who admired Aristotle's work, and 
the French philosopher Henri Bergson, 
who described his great predecessor's 
metaphysical theory as that which most 
closely reflects the nature of the human 
mind. For centuries, philologists, philo- 
sophers and historians have studied Aris- 
totle’s writings from every possible angle. 
The bibliography of Aristotelian studies, 
already enormous, still continues to grow. 
This is mainly due to the extraordinary 
diversity of Aristotle's work, which repre- 
sents an essential phase in the development 
of ancient Greek thought, to which it 
brought a new scientific dimension. To a 
great extent, this work has shaped or 
crystallized philosophical problems, con- 
cepts and terms for all succeeding gene- 
rations, and has made a decisive contri- 
bution to the development and indeed the 
creation of a number of scientific disci- 
plines. Finally, it constitutes the first 
methodical attempt to organize morals 
and law into a philosophical system and to 
lay the foundations for a scientific exami- 
nation of politics. 
Seen at a distance of so many centuries, 
Aristotle's writings may. appear to us as 
something to be taken for granted, an 
intellectual treasure of which we happen 
to be the fortunate beneficiaries. 
Yet this great body of work was brought 
forth arduously and gradually, following a 
pattern that remained consistent despite 
frequent fluctuations and digressions. It 
was produced by a man of genius who was 
also a tireless worker, in the course of a

life that was marked by ordinary human 
‘vicissitudes such as family losses, personal 
disappointment and bitterness, but which 
was also enhanced by the support of loyal 
friends, by constant contact with Plato, 
the supreme philosopher of ancient Greece, 
and by the stimulating collaboration of 
chosen disciples. 
Aristotle was born in 384 B.C. in the 
small Greek colony of Stagira on the Chal- 
cidic peninsula of Macedonia in northern 
Greece. He spent his childhood in Pella, 
where his flather, Nicomachus, was court

Bust of Aristotle in the 
Capito! Museum, Rome 
physician to Amyntas Il of Macedon. He 
lost his father at an early age, and at 17 left 
for Athens, the centre of Greek civilization. 
In Athens he acquired the rich experience 
of living in a multi-faceted society, acquain- 
ting himself with all its political, economic 
and cultural currents. Above all, he fami- 
liarized himself with the Attic use of lan- 
guage, which the orators and teachers of 
rhetoric then cultivated almost to excess, 
but which was a magnificent vehicle for 
contemporary judgements and observa- 
tions concerning human values. 
- This was the period when the Academy, 
the school of philosophy founded by Plato, 
flourished in Athens. At the time of Aris- 
totle’s arrival, Plato was absent in Sicily 
and the Academy was provisionally headed 
by the astronomer and philosopher Eudoxus 
of Cnidus. Aristotle became an active 
member of the Academy, where he was 
to spend 20 years of his life, from 367 to 
347 B.C. 
During this long and fruitful period, 
Aristotle lived in close contact with Plato 
and .other eminent thinkers and received 
continuous intellectual stimulation from his 
association with them. He soon distin- . 
guished himself for his acute intelligence 
and passionate thirst for knowledge, for his 
vigorous mind and dialectical prowess. 
Most important of all, he finally emerged 
as a totally original and independent thinker. 
After Plato's death, Speusippus became 
head of the Academy. Aristotle decided 
that it was time to leave Athens. He 
departed, somewhat embittered at not 
" being appointed Plato's successor, and 
settled in Assus, a little town in the Troad, 
in northwest Asia Minor. There, in colla- 
boration with several other Platonists, he 
founded his first school, as a kind of annex 
to the Academy. 
"He taught in Assus for three years (347- 
344 B.C.) and then moved to Mytilene on 
the nearby island of Lesbos. There he 
worked for two years on biological research 
with Theophrastus, a native of the island, 
and also pursued his other studies, particu-. 
larly in the field of logic. 
At the invitation of King Philip Il of 
Macedon, son of Amyntas |l, Aristotle left 
Mytilene in 342 B.C. to return to the court 
at Pella, where he was entrusted with the 
education of Philip's heir, the future Alex- 
ander the Great, then a 13-year-old boy. 
For three years Aristotle concentrated on 
this task and then, from 340 to 335 B.C., 
devoted himself more fully to his own 
research and writing. 
The year 335 B.C. marks the beginning 
of the most important period in Aristotle’s 
life. Once again he settled in Athens, and

) founded his second school, the Lyceum, 
where for the next 12 years he proved to 
be an admirable teacher, a great philoso- 
phical innovator, a creative scientist and an 
incomparable organizer of methodical 
enquiry by teams of scientists and scholars. 
During this time he completed his many- 
sided contribution to human thought and 
gave final form to his writings, which were 
to serve through the ages as a landmark for 
those seeking to establish the fundamental 
principles of intellectual activity. 
in 323 B.C., there was a violent outburst 
of anti-Macedonian feeling in Athens. 
Aristotle suffered a certain amount of 
persecution and escaped to Chalcis, his 
mother's birthplace, leaving both the 
school and his manuscripts in the care of 
Theophrastus. He died in Chalcis a few 
months later, a sad and lonely man (1). 
Content apart, the sheer quantity of 
Aristotle's writings constitutes an amazing 
achievement. The most important of his 
surviving works, which represent barely 
one-quarter of his entire output, deal with 
many branches of human knowledge, 
including logic, physics, biology, meta- 
physics, morals, politics and psychology. 
The idea that population 
growth should be 
controlled in the interests 
of balanced economic 
development is often 
thought to be a modern 
one. However, it was 
foreshadowed, 2,300 years 
ago by Aristotle, who 
declared in his Politics 
that overpopulation 
caused poverty, crime and 
other social evils.

Universal education is another “modern” idea discussed by Aristotle in 
his Politics in the 4th century B.C. He stresses that education must 
prepare the citizen to use leisure, for a state that cannot use its leisure 
properly will collapse. Above, athletes on a Greek vase. 
It is generally accepted that his greatest 
achievement was the decisive contribution 
which he made to logic. Not only did he 
re-examine, supplement and classify his 
predecessors’ discoveries in this field, he 
also enriched them with his own discove- 
ries and finally organized the existing body 
of knowledge on the subject into a complete 
philosophical science. 
Aristotle's works on logic deal with 
human thought not only at the scientific 
level but also in relation to everyday life. 
They are divided into two parts, the analy- 
tical (which is the more important} and the -

commemorate the 23rd centenary of Aristotle's 
death by organizing a world congress on

dialectic. The Analytics, which deals prin- 
cipally with reasoning and logical demons- 
trations, has made an invaluable contribu- 
tion to the methodology of the exact 
sciences. The balanced construction of 
Euclidean geometry owes much tg Aristo- 
tle's Analytics. 
However, the "Father of Logic” was 
fully aware that reasoning cannot cover the 
entire field of the cognitive process, (that 
is, the action and faculty of knowing} and 
that the knowledge of first principles, on 
which we base our judgements and there- 
fore our reasoning, is obtained by a direct 
process which is based less on reasoning 
than on a kind of intuitive vision. 
For Aristotle, reasoning is not the sole 
method of enquiry into philosophical and 
scientific problems. He also uses obser- 
vation, analogy and the historical-evolu- 
tionist method. 
 
When investigating a philosophical 
problem, he prefers to begin by analysing 
the meaning of words and then proceeds 
to an analysis of the subject, including an 
exposition of views contrary to his own. 
Aristotle’s work in the field of physics is 
held in lesser esteem today, despite its 
undoubted importance. Here he is concer- 
ned with “natural” beings, in other words 
those which are endowed with the capacity 
for motion, whether in the spatial sense, or 
through increase or decrease, or through 
mutation. Such beings include animals, 
plants and the four “simple bodies’ —earth, 
fire, air and water. 
These four elements serve as a starting- 
point for Aristotle’s explanation of a num- 
ber of changes affecting corruptible natural 
beings, without however presupposing any 
strict teleology—the doctrine that final 
goals and purposes rather than mechanical 
causes order reality. According to Aristotle, 
nature is not to be considered equal to 
matter. It is both ‘"daemonic and divine." 
In his desire to place physics on a sturdy 
theoretical foundation, Aristotle studied 
with almost mathematical rigour the infi- 
nite, the void, the continuum, space, 
time, motion and energy. He formulated 
bold theories, especially concerning the 
- problem of time, which were to exert a 
fruitful influence on later thinkers such as 
Newton, Husserl and Bergson. 
He also considered the possibility that 
the earth might be spherical in shape. A 
passage in one of his works is believed to 
have encouraged Christopher Columbus 
to follow a westerly course in his attempt 
to reach the Indies. 
Eminent modern biologists have expres- 
sed their admiration for Aristotle's contri- 
bution to the development of this science. 
Darwin described Linnaeus as a mere 
apprentice in comparison with Aristotle, 
whose biological treatises list 500 different 
varieties of animals and include a wealth of 
information on comparative anatomy and

embryology, as well as the principles of 
physiology. 
The notion of “organism” appears for 
the first time in Aristotle, and the gene- 
ration of life is given a teleological inter- 
pretation, based on the concept of ente- 
lechy, the realization or complete expres- 
sion of potentiality. 
The soul is considered as a life-giving 
principle, the basic condition for existence 
in living beings. It both shapes and sustains 
the organism, and generates and directs: 
motion and sensation, volition and mental 
energy. 
Aristotle makes a distinction between a 
merely nutritive” soul, such as exists in 
plants, a sensitive soul which coexists with 
the nutritive sou! in animals, and a rational 
soul coexisting with the former two in 
human beings. 
As for psychology, Aristotle was the 
forerunner of theoretical trends which were 
to emerge in later times in the work of such 
thinkers as Kant and Fichte and the foun- 
ders of configurative and associative 
psychology. 
Among the principal concepts introduced 
for the first time in his theory of psychology 
are the passions, the faculties or dispo- 
sitions, sensation, appetite, the intellect, 
desire and volition. 
Aristotle's study of morals is the product 
‘of a critical elaboration of the moral beliefs 
held by the Greek people and scholars of 
his time, and the integration of these 
beliefs into his own psychological and 
metaphysical concepts, combined with a 
philosophical enquiry into man’s practical 
functions. 
The basic concepts of this open-ended 
system are: the good, happiness, virtue, 
and moral choice—a notion which presup- 
poses: freedom in a very practical sense. 
Happiness is defined as “the activity of the 
soul in a state of virtue”, in other words as 
a condition closely related to freedom, 
though dependent on the individual condi- 
tion determined by the circumstances of a 
person’s life. 
Aristotle's theory of law exerted a pro- 
found influence on Roman, late medieval 
and modern jurists, particularly his notions 
of distributive law, corrective law, contract, 
retaliation and leniency. Moralists and 
jurists were also much influenced by Aris- 
totle’s theory concerning the family. 
In his Politics, Aristotle put forward the 
notion that man is by nature a political 
animal, thus implying that society, in the 
political sense, is not an artificial product 
but the outcome of something inherent in 
human nature. His use of the citizens’ 
common interest as the supreme criterion 
in distinguishing “‘good” from 
societies emphasized the interdependence 
of society and justice. 
Aristotle's Politics became widely 
known in Western Europe in the late 
Middle Ages and made a decisive impact 
on modern political science. Political 
theories and concepts such as the state, 
law, forms of government, the citizen, 
politics as the art of the possible, the sepa- 
ration of powers, the antagonism between 
rich and poor, can all be found in Aristotle. 
The Poetics, only parts of which have 
survived, deals mainly with the subject of 
artistic creation considered as an imitation 
Li bad” . 
of nature by means of form, colour, sound, 
motion and words. 
Since the Renaissance, it has proved a 
major influence on literature and literary 
criticism. His definition of tragedy, in 
particular, which features the celebrated 
notion of catharsis (purification), has 
provided a stimulating source of debate 
and comment among many poets and 
critics. Bh 
However, Aristotle's greatest work is his 
Metaphysics, the main subject of which is 
the nature of being, which he presents as 
an inexhaustible source of conjecture for 
the human mind. 
This fundamental philosophical work, 
which nurtured the philosophy of medieval 
Europe, as well as Arabic philosophy (with 
certain variations), still provides the 
groundwork for the philosophical doctrine 
of the Catholic Church. In it, Aristotle 
advanced such important dual concepts as 
form-and-matter and potentiality-and- 
actuality, the first designating the structure 
of each being and the second the move- 
ment of each being towards realization. 
He also posited and envisaged such 
eschatological problems as the generation 
and corruption of beings as opposed to 
the eternity of the world; the first cause 
and the principles which activate the world; 
and finally the fundamental concept of 
human conscience which Descartes was 
to formulate many centuries later when he 
wrote: “Cogito, ergo sum” {I think, there- 
fore | am).

The issue celebrating the 400th anniver- 
sary of Rubens’ Birth (June 1877} would 
have been a boon for philatelists, if only 
you had devoted more space to the stamps 
issued in the great painter's honour {page

Perhaps readers would be interested to 
know that the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Posts 
and Telecommunications has issued a series 
of stamps in honour of Rubens consisting 
of a sheet and 5 separate stamps. The 
5 stamps show works by Rubens in the 
Hermitage Museum, Leningrad: “Alliance 
of Earth ‘and Water”, "The Carters”, ‘Lion 
Hunt”, “The Rainbow” and “Portrait of a

SOLAR ENERGY 
FOR THE THIRD WORLD 
Sir, 
Erik P. Eckholm’s article on the poor 
man’s energy crisis caught my attention in: 
your excellent issue entitled "A Halt to 
Desert Advance’ (July 1977). 
There is a shortage of firewood in many 
regions of the world, but there seems to be 
no shortage of strong sunlight. This 
suggests a possible remedy, 
Why not introduce domestic solar cookers 
in these regions? Given current advances 
in technology, this should be possible. If 
the project was successful, it would relieve 
the poor of the Third World of the heart- 
breaking search for firewood and give the 
forests a chance to grow again. 
Finally, | believe that any notion of profit 
from such an invention for the poor of the 
Third World should be ruled out. The 
reward may lie in this quotation from the 
Prophet Isaiah: "Then shall the light rise 
up in darkness and thy darkness shall be as 
the noonday.” 
Sean 0. Cadhla

Sir, 
I am 86 years old, but | still think about 
the future and so | was particularly interested 
by Erik Eckholm’s article drawing attention 
to the alarming rate at which wood is being 
used up in some parts of the world. 
It is hard to know how to brake the massi- 
ve consumption of wood as a heating fuel 
in the poor regions of Asia, Africa and 
South America. However, in some of these 
regions which have a sunny climate, sun- 
light could replace wood as an energy- 
source. , Parabolic reflectors could be mass- 
produced for this purpose, possibly in dural- 
min. In spite of the costs involved, this 
would be a vast improvement on the whole- 
sale destruction of trees.
