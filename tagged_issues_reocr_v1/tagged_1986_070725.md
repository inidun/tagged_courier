### 70705: UNESCO: 40 years of action

Unesco: 40 years of action 
 
by Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow 
ORTY years ago, just a few weeks after the end of the 
Second World War, the Conference of the Allied 
Ministers of Education, which was to adopt the Con- 
stitution of Unesco, met in London. 
To the terrible toll of six years of desolation and death that 
the world had just experienced was now added the threat 
foreshadowed by the explosion of the two atomic bombs at 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over the ruins of the annihilated 
cities, in the grief present everywhere, and confronted by the 
prospect of new forms of mass destruction, the international 
community became aware of the collective responsibilities 
which it would have to shoulder in order to preserve the 
future of the species. 
Within the framework of the United Nations system that 
had just been set up, Unesco was given the task of advancing 
international peace and the common welfare of mankind 
through “the educational and scientific and cultural relations 
of the peoples of the world”—in other words, international 
intellectual co-operation. 
In order to help to bring about “a condition in which the 
incentives to war are neutralized by social, spiritual and 
economic advances...”, Unesco engaged in vigorous action 
in many different fields—the development of great standard- 
setting concepts; the circulation of knowledge, ideas and 
information; and operational activities to help the poorest 
countries. This activity aimed among other things to foster 
mutual knowledge and understanding among nations; to 
facilitate by means of appropriate methods of co-operation 
the access of all peoples to what each of them had already 
produced and to what each was producing in all fields of 
thought, artistic creativity and scientific and technical dis- 
covery and experiment; to bring about conditions under 
which everyone should have equal opportunities of access to 
education; and to allow the free exchange of ideas and 
information. 
Over the years, Unesco has constantly broadened the 
basis of its representativity. Its action in this area has been 
constantly gaining in scope and complexity—especially with 
the admission of nearly 100 countries which, during the late 
1950s and the 1960s, acceded to national sovereignty. 
These countries brought their historical and cultural ex- 
perience into the Organization; they expressed their particu- 
lar sensitivities; they evoked their own concerns. The de- 
veloping countries, in particular, raised questions related to 
the difficult, sometimes even alarming, circumstances that 
they were facing, to the manifold challenges confronting 
them and to the various paths that they were exploring in 
order to ensure a development that was authentic. 
Unesco thus began to think about the reality of an in- 
creasingly interdependent world in which societies are in 
contact with each other to a greater or lesser degree and are 
part of a world system of reciprocal exchanges and relations. 
On account of this development, Unesco, which had at 
first focused its activities on certain parts of the world, was 
gradually led to extend them worldwide. 
During the past forty years, Unesco has thus made possi- 
ble the development of a host of communication, exchange, 
co-operation and action networks, reaching into the most 
diverse fields, leading to immense progress in knowledge 
and know-how, and leading the peoples and the cultures of 
the whole world to draw closer together. 
Throughout these decades, Unesco has striven to draw on 
three sources of energy—the political reality of the govern- 
ments of Member States; the creative urge of spiritual, 
intellectual and artistic communities; and the competence 
and devotion of an international Secretariat that is called on 
to encourage and co-ordinate the ideas, initiatives and pro- 
jects of all. 
This is why Unesco is duty-bound to increase still further 
the integration of the intellectual communities of the world 
in the living tissue of its activities, so that constantly renewed 
blood can flow through this tissue and so that the factors of 
amalgamation and catalytic forces that give full strength to 
the alchemy of intellectual co-operation can be brought into 
every one of its great debates. 
I cannot conclude without adding that the world is today 
encountering a number of grave difficulties that are reflected 
in the functioning of the United Nations system and, conse- 
quently, in Unesco. 
These difficulties no doubt provide a fresh opportunity for 
re-examining some of the workings of the system with a view 
to their democratization; they have, however, made some 
people question the aims and purposes of the system and 
even the very reason for its existence. 
This is not the first time that the United Nations has faced 
such challenges. It is therefore important that the heads of 
the agencies of the system should shoulder their responsibili- 
tics in full measure. 
It is no longer for them a case of merely expediting current 
matters as best they can. Guided by their conscience, in 
observance of the principles of the United Nations Charter 
and of the Constitutions of their respective organizations, it 
is also—and perhaps especially—for them to rise above the 
contingent and the incidental in order to keep all chances for 
the future intact. 
In this year which marks the fortieth anniversary of Un- 
esco, it is with this conviction that once more I call on 
intellectuals throughout the world to strengthen, through 
our Organization, the ties of solidarity based on the forces of 
freedom, creativity and progress—themselves the very 
forces of the spirit that Unesco exists to bring together. W 
This text is a slightly shortened version of an address given by the Director-General of 
Unesco at the Organization's Paris Headquarters during a ceremony held en 12 
December 1985 to commemorate Unesco's forticth anniversary.

The 1970s marked a turning point in this march towards 
liberty. It was a decade which saw the appearance on the 
world scene of nations which, “small” though they may be in 
terms of area and population, nevertheless possess the same 
sovereign rights as the largest nations. But how can they fully 
exercise such rights and, by adding their voices to the concert 
of nations, win a real hearing for themselves? This is not 
always an easy task, and Unesco, like other international 
organizations, has realized the need to help the small nations 
which constitute a growing number of its members to be-

a ship on a voyage of discovery. He 
sweeps the horizon with his spyglass— 
but he is holding it the wrong way round. He 
does not see small islands at all, and even 
larger ones seem puny. Now suppose that 
an inhabitant of one of those islands comes 
aboard the vessel and takes a turn at look- 
ing through the spyglass, but from the end 
which is turned towards him. The repre- 
sentative of the outside world and all his 
trappings will look very imposing. The 
islander realizes that it will certainly be 
I: for a moment, the captain of 
worth his while to come to an understand- 
ing with this impressive personage. 
And this, indeed, is how small States and 
large States perceive each other. Seen from 
the vantage-point of a large State, a “micro- 
State” seems even smaller than it really is, 
and too often it is written off as negligible. 
After all, did not the League of Nations 
decide, round about 1920, that States which 
it dubbed “Lilliputian” could not join it as 
full members? From the opposite point of 
view, small States see large ones as 
looming, not to say threatening, presences, 
but laden with wealth from which they must 
find a way of benefiting. 
Nowadays, the international community 
sees small States more and more clearly. In 
the 1960s, a State was regarded as small 
when it had fewer than five million, or even 
ten or fifteen million, inhabitants. 
However, towards the end of the decade, 
the less populated States were poised on the 
threshold of independence. The United Na- 
tions turned its attention to the status that 
they should be given. Specialists busied 
themselves with finding ways in which these 
new States might be associated with the 
international agencies without disrupting 
their modes of operation. The United Na- 
tions Institute for Training and Research 
(UNITAR) worked to devise criteria for 
defining small States, and its prime choice 
was the criterion of population. With the 
disclaimer that this was arbitrary and not a 
hard and fast rule, it set the limit at one 
million inhabitants. 
During the 1970s, several States whose 
population was well below the one million 
mark joined either the United Nations— 
founded on the principle of the sovereign 
equality of all its members—or its Special- 
ized Agencies. Unfortunately, it is not 
enough to be a member: it is also necessary 
to be present and to make one’s views 
known, particularly at major international 
conferences; and this calls for human and 
financial resources. 
Other international organizations have 
since grasped the importance of facilitating 
small States’ participation in the concert of 
nations. In 1983, the Heads of State and 
Government of the Commonwealth raised 
the question of the vulnerability of small

States, which were numerous among them, 
and asked for a study to be made of their 
specific needs. This task was entrusted to an 
advisory group which submitted itsreportin 
1985. The criterion selected by this group 
was the same as that of UNITAR, namely, a 
population of fewer than one million in- 
habitants. 
Also in 1983, a group of experts from the 
non-aligned countries chose as the criterion 
for small developing island countries a 
population in most cases lower than 400,000 
inhabitants and seldom higher than one mil- 
lion, combined with a territory of less than 
700 km? and not usually more than 4,000 
km*. 
The United Nations Demographic Year- 
book (1980 and 1981 editions) lists forty- 
nine territories of varying political status 
whose population is lower than 200,000 in- 
habitants, and sixty-four territories whose 
area is less than 5,000 km?. In this last

category, all except nine are island States. 
No mainland developing country meets 
both the criteria of the non-aligned; on the 
one hand, five developed mainland coun- 
tries do satisfy this requirement: Andorra, 
the Holy See, Liechtenstein, Monaco and 
San Marino (the Holy See, with an area of 
forty-four hectares and 1,000 inhabitants, is 
the smallest State in the world). The smal- 
lest developing countries with inland fron- 
tiers are, in population, Belize (158, 000 
inhabitants, 22,965 km?) and, in size, 
Brunei (5, 765 km? and 220,000 inhabi- 
tants). Ultimately, if the twofold criterion 
of population and area is used, the smallest 
developing countries are all islands. 
Small States are fully aware of the fact 
that the interest taken in them by large 
States is only spasmodic. The latter could, if 
they wished, ignore them altogether. But is 
this really what they want? The workings of 
island societies are the outcome of perma- p

### 70706: Small countries and the international community

Pp nent tension between the assertion of their 
own individuality and the need to fit into a 
network of foreign relations. This is equally 
apparent in the cultural, political and eco- 
nomic spheres. 
Islands may be remote, but they show a 
surprising receptiveness to the rest of the 
world. The economic production of small 
island States is usually highly specialized 
and essentially geared to exporting. Where- 
as local products are exported, local con- 
sumption is mainly supplied by imports. 
The exports themselves incorporate im- 
ports at every stage of production: plant, 
intermediate products and bank credit. In 
many cases, machinery must even be sent 
abroad for repair. 
It is no exaggeration that, for many small 
States, the external sector represents the 
entire economy. There is, indeed, an inter- 
nal sector, but it is confined to a quarter- 
master’s role: it provides the consumer 
goods and services necessary to the popula- 
tion or useful to export activities. It could 
not continue to exist if it were not supported 
by the income from exports or the revenue 
of workers in the external sector. Such ex- 
ports may be agricultural produce (the 
coconut palms which look so pretty on tour- 
ist brochures also yield oil and copra), 
manufactured products (Mauritius, a sugar- 
producing island, has become one of the 
major world centres of the knitwear indus- 
try) or services (banks in the Bahamas or 
insurance in Bermuda). Some countries 
even export postage stamps: in Tuvalu, 
their sale is sufficient to offset public expen- 
diture. 
Several island countries also export 
labour. It is quite usual to hear people say, 
on small islands, that more of the islanders 
are abroad than at home. For example, at 
the time of the 1981 census in Niue, it 
emerged that 5,091 islanders were living in 
New Zealand, as compared with 3,278 in 
Niue itself. Goods sent home by emigrants 
can also play an important role in the eco- 
nomy. These invisible imports, in Cape 
Verde, for example, represent more than 
ten times the value of exports. 
Small island countries are particularly 
vulnerable to fluctuations in the world eco- 
nomy—fluctuations over which they have 
no control but to which they are compelled 
to adjust. For instance, a very small change 
in agricultural policy, or a protectionist 
drive in a particular sector of a developed 
country, or an international agreement 
negotiated between large States, can bring 
the economy of a small island State to its 
knees. Such a State will then have no choice 
but to seek favour with the large States, and 
above all to become “visible”. 
For example, in 1980, the Republic of 
Maldives, a small country with 176,000 in- 
habitants, classed in the category of the 
least-developed countries, succeeded, not 
without difficulty, in acquiring a small fac- 
tory for knitting woollen garments. In 1982,

Postage stamps from Tuvalu mark the In- 
ternational Year of the Child (1979). Next to 
copra, the sale of postage stamps for col- 
lectors is the country’s main source of 
revenue.

### 70706: Small countries and the international community

p> it exported 40,000 dozen knitted garments 
to a large country. The following year, the 
latter imposed a quota of 25,000 dozen, 
although the factory had already received 
orders for three or four times that number. 
The Republic of Maldives accordingly 
turned to GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade), which it had recently 
joined to suit the circumstances. The costs 
of participating in negotiations in Geneva 
and in Washington were likely to exceed the 
expected profits, but by what other means 
could this tiny country make itself heard by 
the international cominunity? 
The UN and its Specialized Agencies are 
of vital importance to the small States. It is 
only right to emphasize this at a time when 
they are the butt of criticism. Such forums, 
where the small can engage in dialogue on 
an equal footing with the great, afford 
advantages to both sides. The founding role 
of Malta and the active part taken by Fiji in 
the United Nations Conference on the Law 
of the Sea are a good illustration of the 
contribution that small countries can make 
to the international community. 
One should be wary of the over-optimis- 
tic belief that international organizations 
can provide small countries with absolute 
safeguards. The only stretch of land to have 
been literally pulverized by a nuclear 
weapon is an islet of the Bikini atoll, which 
belongs to a Pacific Trust Territory of the 
United Nations. It was blasted out of exist- 
ence in 1950 by a nuclear test carried out by 
the trustee authority. Moreover, the 
maintenance since 1964 of a United Nations 
force in Cyprus did not prevent the partition 
of the island in 1975. 
In fact, the problem of the effective parti- 
. cipation of small States in international in- 
stitutions still remains to be solved. The 
financial cost involved is high. Goodwill can 
help to lighten the burden: since 1983 Aus- 
tralia has subventioned an office which is 
shared between the missions to the UN of 
the Maldives, the Solomon Islands, 
Vanuatu and Western Samoa. The perma- 
nent missions of Dominica and Saint Lucia 
also share their offices. However, human 
constraints are equally important. A coun- 
try with a small population, which by defini- 
tion has a very small number of officials, 
finds it difficult to send them to represent it 
abroad when they are required to give 
priority to managing affairs of state at 
home. For a time, the small island countries 
were represented, when necessary, by the 
diplomats of countries which were friendly 
towards them. But nowadays they seem less 
inclined to have recourse to this solution. 
The States joining Unesco are also be- 
coming smaller and smaller. The average 
population of the first 16 Member States in 
1946 was in those days 59 million inhabi- 
tants (11.5 million if one discounts China 
and India). The average population of the 
16 most recent Member States and Associ- 
ate Members—which are the subject of this 
issue—is 769,000 inhabitants. This is a wel- 
come trend. Joint action and multilateral 
negotiations are particularly rewarding for 
small States in their efforts to gain a foot- 
hold in the international order. Similarly, 
international organizations are a useful 
means whereby large States can hear what 
the small and vulnerable have to say, so that 
they may all work together to build a more 
reliable, stable and just international order.

### 70707: The Quest for identity

The quest for identity 
by Raymond Chasle 
Third World on the international 
scene has enabled islands to assert 
themselves as economically, socially and 
geo-climatically distinct. The legitimacy of 
their claims is now acknowledged, but they 
have by no means won full practical recog- 
nition. Furthermore, the specific cultural 
characteristics of islands have not yet been 
given sufficient consideration. 
Most islands have been affected by 
changing fortunes and the upheavals of 
history. They have been the targets of his- 
torical rivalry and of maritime greed on the 
part of nations which have sought to exploit 
their strategic value or have attempted to 
impose trade monopolies. 
As regards the people who live on 
islands, we are talking in some cases about 
human settlements so ancient that they can 
be traced back to pre-history or to the ear- 
liest historical times. Alternatively, we can 
say that settlements are relatively recent in 
the case of islands which had no indige- 
nous population. Between these two ex- 
tremes, there has been an unending flow of 
emigrants through the ages. The broad 
miscegenation of island peoples, both 
biological and cultural, may be traced to 
chance encounters at ports of call or to the 
deliberate settlement of groups brought in 
as slaves. 
As stopping-places for expeditions which 
were often hostile and bent on plunder, and 
as ports of destination for ships whose 
holds and steerage had been converted 
into “Negro pens”, islands took in the 
slaves who had survived disease and ill- 
Tr emergence of the countries of the 
treatment, and with them their skills, know- 
ledge, beliefs and dreams. 
After the abolition of the maritime slave 
trade and the consequent emancipation of 
slaves, the need to find substitute labour in 
the form of hired workers soon brought 
about a return to slavery. Thereafter, con- 
flicts began to break out, sparked by re- 
ligious, ethnic, linguistic and legal conten- 
tions in the vanous societies. 
The replacement of traditional systems 
by new systems of values introduced by 
missionaries in the name of Christian 
morality caused cultural confrontations and 
turmoil. So-called “racist colonial” forms of 
prejudice laid the foundations of laws, de- 
crees and new institutions which showed 
scant respect for local beliefs and value 
systems. Initially, all this brought about a 
cultural breakdown. Then, by degrees, 
islands achieved a vigorous and original 
synthesis of their own cultural resources 
and those imported from outside. 
Traces of original cultures have survived 
not only in the sphere of tangible assets 
which are, moreover, threatened by 
changes, not to say in danger of vanishing 
altogether (architecture is a typical exam- 
ple), but also in the domain of intangible 
values, which neither imported new reli- 
gions nor imported models of rational 
thought have ever been able to obliterate. 
The institutions transplanted by the col- 
onizers have been remodelled and restruc- 
tured. The languages of ruling powers have 
become imbued with Creole imagery. After 
whole decades of attempts to write imitative 
poetry with crude emotional appeal, the 
island poets, whose work has brought the 
dream of the islands to fruition, have risen 
to the top of their calling and now rank with 
the greatest: Aimé Césaire, Nicolas Guil- 
Ién, Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, Malcolm de 
Chazal, Saint-John Perse (Nobel Prize for 
Literature, 1960), Edward Kamau Braith- 
waite, Derek Walcott. Many island poets 
have also done much to generate and nur- 
ture the growth of social awareness in the 
context of the struggle for liberation. 
Modern communications and newly-ac- 
quired independence have enabled the 
Creole-speakers of the islands of the Indian 
Ocean and the Caribbean to discover and 
recognize linguistic and cultural affinities, to 
restore the dignity of the Creole language, 
long neglected and dismissed as inferior, 
and to emphasize the similarities in the 
Creole spoken by populations far distant 
from one another and the discrepancies 
between the Creole spoken on neighbour- 
ing islands. 
Encouraging signs indicate that the 
populations of islands are becoming more 
and more strongly attached to the basic 
features on which they pride themselves 
and which distinguish them from others; 
they have already paid too heavy a tribute 
to history to put their identity at risk; they are 
not merely preservers but truly creative 
crucibles of culture; and they must over- 
come the opposition between those willing 
to be totally engulfed by the new and those 
who cling rigidly to the old—for a third way 
is possible. it is possible to cultivate a criti- 
cal and lucid receptiveness to external in- 
fluences. They are coming to realize that 
the dynamic forces of society must stem 
from their own cultures and develop out of 
their own intrinsic values, so that they can 
guide their destiny towards a future that is 
not shaped by external pressures. Plur- 
alism, ultimately, is the best antidote and 
the most effective weapon against the soul- 
destroying forces of standardization. MH 
RAYMOND CHASLE, Mauritian writer and dip- 
lomat, represents his country in the European 
Economic Community and at United Nations 
institutions in Vienna and Geneva. In 1984 he 
was the principal negotiator for cultural and so- 
cial co-operation at the third Lomé Convention.

### 187013: Worlds apart

Worlds apart 
by Francois Doumenge 
Tropical islands, in spite of their beautiful 
scenery and idyllic climate, are a prey to 
serious economic and biological con- 
straints and natural disasters. Above, a 
small island near Suva, Fiji. 
tinctive are their physical and biologic- 
al characteristics, as well as their eco- 
nomic and demographic situation. Sur- 
rounded by the sea, they are by definition 
relatively isolated, a condition which has 
effects on their plant and animal popula- 
tions as well as on their social and economic 
equilibrium. 
Degrees of insularity are difficult to 
measure. Islands with more than a certain 
surface area are continental islands. Small 
island countries usually have a surface area 
of less than 20,000 km” and a population of 
less than a million persons. 
Excluding islands in Arctic and extreme 
southern latitudes and in the Med- 
iterranean, most small island countries are 
found in the intertropical zone. In terms of

climate they enjoy definite assets, and con- 
sequently they conjure up images of lush 
vegetation, agreeable weather conditions 
and varied landscapes that are idyllic to 
many a mainlander. Oceanic influences en- 
sure that there is a high degree of continuity 
in the life cycle of plants, a high level of 
insolation encourages natural productivity, 
and the trade winds exert a beneficial influ- 
ence on the environment. Nevertheless, 
there are constraints: a central belt of heavy 
rainfall corresponding to the intertropical 
front is bordered by two dry belts, with the 
result that within a single archipelago 
groups of very humid islands are sometimes 
found next to quite arid ones. Moreover, 
the alternation of wet and dry seasons is 
marked by violent disturbances such as cy- 
clones, typhoons and serious droughts. p»

Finally, as a result of their geological forma- 
tion and geographical situation, these is- 
lands are subject to earthquakes and vol- 
10 
canic eruptions. 
More serious than the susceptibility of 
islands to natural disasters are the biological 
constraints of endemism.!) These are parti- 
cularly onerous since fewer plant and anim- 
al species are found on islands, because of 
their physical isolation, than on continents. 
These natural populations are fragile, since 
their regenerative capacity and their power 
of resistance are weak when faced with 
overexploitation or harsh competition from 
outside species introduced accidentally or 
for economic reasons. The proliferation of 
such species and their retinue of parasites 
and pathogenic organisms may cause real 
ecological catastrophes. On the other hand, 
by virtue of their isolation, islands may 
constitute veritable biological sanctuaries 
for the preservation of species which might 
have been eliminated in evolutionary com- 
petition among continental communities. 
1. Defined by the Dictionnaire encyclopédique Quillet as 
“the quality of being endemic or having a limited and 
clearly demarcated distribution”, the French term “en- 
demisme” possesses not only biological or ecological but 
also cultural connotations. 
Among the native fauna of the Galdpagos 
archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, 1,300 km 
from the coast of Ecuador, are the giant 
tortoises which take their name from the 
archipelago, iguanas, sea-lions (left), 
birds and many small animals which owe 
their survival to their isolation. The Gala- 
pagos islands feature on Unesco’s World 
Heritage List, and belong to the interna- 
tional biosphere reserve network which 
has been created as part of Unesco’s ma- 
jor programme on Man and the Biosphere 
(MAB). The network, which today extends 
to 226 sites in 62 countries, consists of 
protected, representative areas for con- 
serving biological diversity within each 
major ecological zone of the world. In 1985 
MAB launched a project aimed at inciud- 
ing in the biosphere network a number of 
sites in the Lesser Antilles Region. 
The application of plant health measures 
and the judicious introduction of species 
which could occupy an ecological niche left 
empty because of an island’s isolation may 
yield excellent results, as is shown by the 
successful transplantation of citrus trees 
from Mediterranean countries to certain 
South Pacific and Caribbean islands, or the 
transplantation of the bread-fruit tree (Ar- 
tocarpus altilis) from the South Pacific to 
the Mascarene Islands and the Antilles. 
Demographically speaking, there is no 
minimum viability threshold as such for 
island communities. In practice, most 
islands were originally occupied by small 
groups of individuals. As a general rule, 
when there are less than 20 inhabitants per 
km?, land development is difficult, and 
densities of more than 300 inhabitants per 
km? result in overpopulation. 
Small island societies are particularly 
vulnerable to outside interference, which 
may reach spectacular proportions. In hu- 
man biological terms, islands act as a sound 
box, amplifying effects which quickly die 
out on continents. Island populations are 
vulnerable because of their isolation, and 
may be decimated by contagious diseases 
introduced by immigrants or visitors. In the 
nineteenth and the early twentieth centur-

The kea (Nestor notabilis), a large parrot 
and one of the most robust of its species, 
is found only in the south of New Zealand. 
The bread-fruit tree (Artocarpus altilis), a 
species orginating in the South Pacific and 
introduced successfully into the Carib- 
bean, produces large fruit (left) which 
when cooked tastes like bread. Its seeds, 
the size of chestnuts, are also edible. 
ies this happened on a number of Pacific 
islands ravaged by epidemics of influenza, 
measles, smallpox or cholera, which took a 
heavy death-toll. 
At present, regardless of natural or eco- 
nomic conditions, the demographic balance 
of islands is still positive. Demographic 
growth leads to emigration, which acts as a 
safety valve when population pressure be- 
comes incompatible with the maintenance 
of the living standards made possible by the 
local economic situation. On some islands 
in Polynesia and the Caribbean, the number 
of emigrants now exceeds the number of 
resident islanders. Beyond what level of 
emigration, it may be asked, will it be im- 
possible to maintain demographic equilib- 
rium? 
In education, population levels impose a 
limit on the range of fields of training. 
While a satisfactory level of general educa- 
tion may be achieved with a population 
generating only a few thousand pupils, tech- 
nical education calls for larger numbers of 
pupils in order to make adequate use of 
costly facilities. To warrant the provision of 
higher education, it seems that recruitment 
must be made from a population “pool” of 
not less than 600,000, provided that the 
existing secondary education structure

reaches at least one quarter of the school- 
age population. 
Below these thresholds, it is difficult for 
small islands to offer independently the full 
range of educational possibilities and to 
provide the necessary supervisory capacity, 
particularly in very specialized fields. Stu- 
dents must therefore turn to overseas uni- 
versities. This vital contact with the outside 
world can be made through membership of 
a wider cultural sphere of influence, or by 
the creation of regional higher education 
institutions such as the University of the 
West Indies in Jamaica and in Trinidad and 
Tobago, which serves the whole of the 
Caribbean, and the University of the South 
Pacific at Suva (Fiji), which is financed by 
the islands of the South Pacific. 
The economies of small islands cannot 
make an impact on international markets. 
Their output is too limited to influence 
prices. Their greatest weakness is that they 
are subject to market fluctuations, except 
where a former protective power or a neigh- 
bouring economic centre will guarantee 
prices and a preferential market for their 
products. This explains why small island 
plantations declined in importance after the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Their 
agricultural commodities—sugar, copra, 
bananas or, to a lesser extent, coffee and 
cocoa—can scarcely compete international- 
ly. Without a superabundant supply of 
natural resources, which is extremely rare, 
it is hard for them to go beyond the stage of 
precarious subsistence. Nor do their limited 
internal markets, their lack of specialized 
manpower and capital, favour the develop- 
ment of processing industries, which are 
very few in number. 
Ultimately, itis the range of possible uses 
of the sites and situations afforded by is- 
lands for the establishment of service activi- 
Islands, especially those of the Caribbean, 
are reqularly ravaged by cyclones, atmos- 
pheric disturbances characterized by vio- 
lent wind and torrential rain, accompanied 
by tidal waves and even minor earth tre- 
mors. Although they only last for a few 
hours, they can destroy an entire harvest 
and ruin a country’s economy. Photo be- 
low shows the damage caused in 1979 in 
Santo Domingo, the capital of the Domini- 
can Republic, by Hurricane David, one of 
the most violent this century. The hurri- 
cane, which had previously devastated 
Dominica, left hundreds of dead and 
homeless in its wake.

-ties which makes it possible to offset the 
weakness of production and processing in- 
dustries. 
Islands may, for example, be used for 
technical bases within international trans- 
port and communication networks. 
Although the bunkering stations of the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the 
fuelling bases of the inter-war years are 
outmoded, submarine cables and telecom- 
munications stations now face competition 
from satellites, and today’s long-haul airlin- 
ers do not need intermediate landing fields, 
new needs have emerged. Port dispersal 
facilities have been developed with the ex- 
pansion of containerization and the need to 
divide up the cargoes of large carriers. 
Other possibilities may arise such as the use 
of certain islands as strategic bases, or as 
observation stations for satellite launching 
and tracking. The main advantage of the 
integration of small islands into a vast 
worldwide network is in making available 
to them infrastructures which would 
never have been justified for local use. 
But for small islands tourism is the main 
key to entry into worldwide economic cir- 
cuits. Since the Second World War, particu- 
larly with the expansion of air travel, tour- 
ism has come to play a dominant role in the 
economy of these countries. The number of 
visitors to even very remote islands has 
sometimes equalled, or even exceeded, that 
of the indigenous population. This has 
brought an injection of economic resources 
through investments, jobs and business. 
Yet the excessive concentration of activities 
into a single sector is dangerous since, as 
well as any pernicious social effects it may 
have, it creates a danger of destabilization, 
the effects of which cannot be controlled in 
the event of a political or economic crisis in 
the system of national or international 
relations. 
Financial services are another field in 
which the special nature of islands may

prove useful. Under the colonial powers, 
islands enjoyed tax and tariff advantages 
which offset some of the disadvantages of 
isolation. With the expansion of interna- 
tional trade and banking links, islands be- 
came desirable locations because their 
isolation guaranteed security and because 
their tax laws were extremely liberal. 
However, this branch of economic activity 
is also dangerously dependent on the inter- 
national economic situation. 
The economic vulnerability of small is- 
land countries is not always an obstacle to 
their development. Their viability depends 
on their ability to predict the evolution of 
the world economy and to adapt to it by 
moving from one specialization to another, 
rather than by seeking a diversification 
which would be risky for their small-scale 
economies. This means that they need a 
novel economic structure and management 
system, not necessarily that which suits con- 
tinental States. [|

### 70709: The New frontiers of the sea

The new frontiers 
of the sea 
Convention in 1982, small island States 
have been in charge of marine space 
which is rich in potential resources and repre- 
sents several thousand times their land area. 
The Convention, in addition to endorsing the 
sovereignty of “archipelagic States” over 
archipelagic waters, an endorsement which can 
only strengthen the cohesion of these States, 
establishes the jurisdiction of island States over 
a vast Exclusive Economic Zone. Thus, the 33 
coral islands of Kiribati, with a total land area of 
approximately 728 km? scattered over some 5 
million km? in the central Pacific, have an Exclu- 
sive Economic Zone of tens of millions of km? 
over which to exercise their rights. 
For small States lacking financial and technic- 
al resources, exploiting these new riches and 
ensuring that their rights are respected over such 
expanses is no easy matter. In addition, it now 
seems unlikely that the much-discussed ex- 
ploitation of the mineral resources of the oceans, 
such as manganese nodules, will be profitable 
before the next century. As far as fishing re- 
sources are concerned, it is difficult for small 
States to prevent the incursions of foreign fishing 
fleets far better equipped than their own; nor can 
they compete commercially with big fishing con- 
cerns which are already firmly entrenched in 
international markets. 
They can, of course, grant fishing and pros- 
pecting concessions to foreign companies, and 
this may bring in substantial revenues. Never- 
theless, there is a risk that they will negotiate 
from a position of weakness, notably through a 
lack of technical and scientific resources, and 
that they will not always have the means to 
guarantee the exclusivity of the concessions 
they will be offering. 
But one of the great merits of the Convention is 
that it creates favourable conditions for the ex- 
ploitation of marine resources, which may help to 
reduce the dependence of small countries in the 
fields of energy and food. Mariculture, for in- 
stance, opens up interesting possibilities for cul- 
tivating profitable species such as pearl oysters 
and abalone, edible fish, and algae for the manu- 
facture of fertilizer, fuel and food for human and 
animal consumption. 
But it is above all through regional co-opera- 
tion (as in the creation of joint fishing concerns) 
and through international co-operation, which 
may help them to partially overcome their scien- 
tific and technological handicaps, that small is- 
land States will have the best opportunities to 
profit from their Exclusive Economic Zonesinthe 
near future, 
Unesco’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission is among the leading international 
organizations with responsibilities in this field. Its 
programme on marine sciences and on non- 
living marine resources seeks, notably, to lay the 
scientific foundations for the rational prospection 
and management of mineral resources in coastal 
zones. The Commission is also making efforts to 
strengthen the capacities of its Member States in 
the fields of marine science and technology. Bl

the Maldive Islands) is an archipela- 
go in the Indian Ocean. The islands 
are grouped into twenty-six natural clusters 
or atolls (the English word atoll is derived 
from the Maldivian atolhu), but are divided 
for administrative purposes into nineteen 
atolls with the capital, Male’, forming a 
twentieth division. Stretching 750 km from 
north to south, the islands are the coral 
crowns of a vast submerged mountain 
range. Out of some 1,200 islands, only 200 
are inhabited. The northernmost atoll is 
some 550 km from the Indian sub-con- 
tinent. 
The ring-shaped atolls of coral reef are 
pierced by openings which are in some cases 
deep enough for shipping. All the islands 
are low-lying, usually not more than 1-2 
metres above sea level. They have white 
sandy beaches and crystal clear lagoons 
with tall coconut palms. 
Most of the population inhabit tiny vil- 
lages on remote islands, and live from 
fishing, which forms the basis of the eco- 
nomy, and from collecting coconuts. Male’ 
is the collection centre for the entire export 
trade and the distribution centre for the 
entire import economy. 
Arable land is minimal and, while small 
amounts of coconuts, millet, sorghum, 
maize and yams are grown, virtually all the 
main food staples have to be imported. 
Apart from fishing, the other most impor- 
tant sources of income are tourism and 
shipping. Maldivians speak a common lan- 
guage, Dhivehi (referring to themselves as 
Dhivehin—"islanders” and to their coun- 
try as Dhivehi Raaje—“the island realm”) 
and practise a common religion, Islam. In 
Male’ itself there are no less than thirty-one 
mosques. 
The early history of the Maldives is 
shrouded in mystery, although according to 
one authority the islands may have been 
originally colonized, probably by people 
from Sri Lanka or India, several centuries 
before the Christian era. Until the twelfth 
century AD, Buddhism seems to have been 
the prevalent religion, and a number of 
ruins of Buddhist temples and other sacred 
places have been excavated in modern 
times. Then, through gradual contact with 
Arab traders, for whom the Maldives lay on 
the direct route to Malacca and China, the 
country was gradually prepared to receive 
Islam, which was officially accepted by Sul-

tan Mohammed ibn Abdullah, who in 1153 
proclaimed this religion throughout his 
realm. 
Two important features stand out in the 
history of the Maldives. First, the orderly 
fashion in which this small but scattered 
kingdom was ruled; second, the valour with 
which the Maldivians have defended their 
country’s independence against all odds and 
superior powers. 
Orderly rule sprang from the administra- 
tive machinery. The Sultan was acknow- 
ledged as the source of all power and law so 
long as he ruled for the benefit of the peo- 
ple, which could, by custom and usage, 
dethrone him or correct him if he went 
astray. 
As for the second feature, the Maldives 
can be said to have remained independent 
virtually throughout their history. The only 
periods marred by foreign domination were 
the fifteen years of Portuguese rule in the 
mid-sixteenth century and two months of 
rule by the Moplas of south India in the 
mid-eighteenth. 
The Portuguese, based at Goa in India, 
began their period of colonial rule in 1558.

They were beset by problems in controlling 
the widely scattered islands with their hos- 
tile population, and were driven out in 1573 
after a guerilla war led by Mohammed Tha- 
kurufaanu the Great. After liberation this 
Sultan, whose exploits are still remembered 
in folklore and epic, introduced reforms in 
every field; he is credited with having intro- 
duced a new monetary system, a new script, 
reform of the administrative machinery, 
and the setting up of a standing militia to 
maintain internal peace and defend the 
country against foreign invaders. 
In 1752, Moplas from the Malabar coast 
of India took Male’, destroyed the Sultan’s 
palace, and took the Sultan into captivity. 
Their occupation lasted only two months; 
Ghazee Hassan Izzuddeen led the Maldi- 
vians in a rebellion which expelled the 
Moplas. This national hero was the founder 
of a dynasty of sultans which reigned until 
the twentieth century. 
Population, surface area, GNP and tourism fi- 
gures for this and other country profiles in this 
issue have been taken from United Nations, 
Unesco and UNCTAD sources.

The period of British “protection” which 
began with the forcible signing of an “ag- 
reement” on 16 December 1887 by Sultan 
Mohammed Mueenudhdeen XI was not a 
particularly significant episode. Britain did 
not interfere with the internal affairs of the 
Maldives to any marked degree. There was 
no British governor or representative sta- 
tioned in the Maldives to advance their 
country’s interests. This was, in fact, an 
agreement whereby the Maldivian Sultan 
managed to keep a super-power which was 
all-powerful in the Indian Ocean outside his 
domain. For the Maldivians, foreign affairs 
and defence were not so important so long 
as they had unobstructed relations with Sri 
Lanka, where they sold the dried smoked 
fish for which they were renowned, and 
obtained all the provisions they required. 
The ingenuity of the Maldivians had again 
managed to find a way to keep their own 
world to themselves. The Protectorate 
came to an end in 1965, and later that year 
the Maldives joined the United Nations. In 
March 1968, following a referendum, the 
country became a republic. | 
HASSAN AHMED MANIK, a leading historian 
and archaeologist of the Republic of Maldives, is 
the author of several pamphlets published by the 
Department of Information and Broadcasting, 
Male’, of which he was Director until 1983, not- 
ably History of the Maldives (1982), from which 
the present article has been adapted. He is 
currently working on a History of Dhivehi Civiliza- 
tion in the Maldives.

southern India. The inscription has not yet

Late 18th-century engraving of a Tongan 
double-hulled vessel made of two dugout 
canoes, surmounted by a central platform. 
In such robust craft, capable of carrying a 
considerable number of passengers and 
provisions and of covering very great dis- 
tances, the early inhabitants of Oceania 
set out to conquer the Pacific, atre- 
mendous adventure which began around 
3,000 years ago. These vessels were still in 
use in Polynesia when Europeans under- 
took their own exploration of the Pacific 
Ocean in the 16th and 17th centuries. 
  
 
HE indigenous cultures of Fiji, 
] Samoa and Tonga were 
homogeneous and shared a common 
origin. The Fijians are usually classified, 
using racial, linguistic and cultural criteria, 
as Melanesians, a term which literally 
means “the black islands”. There is, 
however, a considerable Polynesian influ- 
ence on the physical characteristics of Fi- 
jians and on their language and culture; this 
came about through historical and geo- 
graphical associations. Archaeological evi- 
dence from carbon dating of Lapita pottery 
and linguistic reconstruction of the proto- 
Polynesian language point to Fiji as the 
original home of the Polynesians where 
they arrived 3,000 years ago. Shortly after 
this period they settled Tonga and then, at 
the beginning of our era, Samoa. 
The triangle thus formed by Fiji, Samoa 
and Tonga is the cradle from which the 
Polynesian language and culture sprang. 
The contacts between the three groups were 
maintained throughout the pre-European 
period and thus although they differ in the 
finer details, their cultures are essentially 
Polynesian. Fiji, however, received later 
waves of migrations from Melanesia, which 
did have some influence on Tonga and to a 
by ‘Ana Maui Taufe’ulungaki 
All these societies demonstrated to 
varying degrees an elegant and advanced 
political and social organization based on a 
pyramidal kinship system, which defined 
rank, political and social roles in terms of 
blood ties. Genealogical ranking is its dis- 
tinctive feature. The head of the secular 
system also claimed divine origin and a 
complementary religious system acted as a 
validating and support system to the politi- 
cal structure. The “kava” ceremony, prac- 
tised in all three groups, with its elaborate 
rituals expressive of rank, and the chiefly 
language of Tonga and Samoa, illustrate the 
Polynesians’ preoccupation with rank and 
chieftainship. a 
They were essentially a seafaring people. 
Their great ocean-going canoes, skilfully 
fashioned using only crude stone axes, 
shells and bones, were capable of carrying 
up to 250 men and testified to their skills as 
craftsmen and navigators. But they also 
practised agriculture, and cultivated the 
same crops of yams, taro, bread-fruit, bana- 
nas and coconuts with similar techniques, as 
well as keeping pigs and chickens. They 
cooked their food in earth ovens and in- 
dulged in gargantuan feasts. Their women 
wove fine mats and baskets and made tapa- 
lesser extent on Samoa. cloths decorated with intricate designs. pp»

p Their houses, thatched and walled with 
woven coconut or sugar-cane leaves, were 
characterized by rounded ends and parallel 
rafters and were supported by king posts. 
They were fond of group singing and danc- 
ing in which hundreds could participate. 
Their musical instruments included nose 
flutes, wooden slit gongs and pan-pipes, 
and their exhibition games included fighting 
with clubs, wrestling and boxing. They dres- 
sed in mats, leaves and tapa-cloths. 
These were the societies that the Euro- 
peans found. The group of Europeans re- 
sponsible for bringing the greatest changes 
to the cultures of these peoples were the 
missionaries. Their aim was not only to 
bring Christianity but Western civilization. 
The religious practices of these societies 
were not the only cultural features con- 
sidered heathenish by the missionaries: 
everything that did not conform with their 
notion of Western civilized habits was con- 
demned—from political and social systems 
to arts and dances, from games and recrea- 
tions to eating habits, ways of dressing, 
sexual mores and languages. Conversion to 
Christianity required the new recruit to re- 
nounce not only his gods but much of his

Radio for the islands 
between the far-flung islands and atolls that sequin the Pacific 
Ocean. Because resources are limited the job is demanding and 
versatility is at a premium: in some island States a large broadcasting 
service may have 10 or 15 producers, while in others two or three people 
may handle all radio broadcasts and a small newsletter. In response to the 
continuing need to train broadcasters in the region, Unesco in co-operation 
with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) of the Federal Republic of Germany, 
the South Pacific Commission and the broadcasters of the Pacific, has 
organized a project called Pacific Broadcasting Training and Development 
(PACBROAD). The project was officially launched in 1985. It is currently 
serving broadcasters on 11 island States stretching some 15,000 km from 
Papua New Guinea to the tiny islands and atolls of Tonga. Some 50 
courses were scheduled for the first year and a half, some in-country, some 
at regional training facilities in Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa and 
Fiji. PACBROAD is now working even more closely with island broadcas- 
ters and seeking to develop additional projects to foster broadcasting 
facilities in Tuvalu (former Ellis Islands), Niue, Tonga and the Cook Islands.

despite the missionaries and advanced tech- 
nology most aspects of their Polynesian 
heritages have survived and are flourishing. 
But greatly improved transport and com- 
munication links with metropolitan centres 
are bringing unprecedented numbers of 
tourists to these countries and not even the 
remotest areas have escaped penetration. 
The improved education systems and in- 
creasingly complex economic systems have 
created their own demands and expecta- 
tions which in turn are affecting the very 
fabric of the social structures at the most 
basic levels. The repercussions on rural life 
have led to mass exodus to the urban areas 
and to metropolitan countries in search of 
educational and economic opportunities. 
The question that arises today is how long 
the vernacular languages and social struc- 
tures can survive the tremendous social and 
economic changes taking place within these 
societies. The Fijian situation is perhaps the 
most difficult. With its now multiracial, 
multilingual and multicultural heritages, it 
has to decide on whether or not to pursue an 
integrated cultural policy aiming ultimately 
at creating an amalgamation of the dispar- 
ate cultural elements within its society or to 
continue to pursue an informal policy of 
segregated cultural development with all its 
implications. 
The problem for Tonga and Samoa re- 
lates more to the development and main- 
tenance of their vernacular languages as the 
vehicles of cultural preservation. Both 
countries are very much aware of the dan- 
ger and are now implementing through 
their education systems language and cul- 
tural programmes at all levels aimed at both 
development and maintenance. 
Tourism, although it is often severely 
censured for introducing undesirable cul- 
tural traits, has in fact helped to revive 
interest in many cultural features, particu- 
larly in the creative and expressive arts, that 
were in danger of being lost. Similarly, 
overseas migration has made the islanders 
more conscious of their national identities 
and their communities have become strong- 
ly nationalistic and highly aware of their 
cultural heritages. 
In recent years, efforts at cultural main- 
tenance have become formalized and in- 
corporated into national development 
plans, which is perhaps an indication of the 
importance these countries attach to the 
role of their cultural heritage in creating 
positive national identities for all their 
members. Such moves augur well for the 
continuing survival of these cultures. MH

the English-speaking Caribbean 
started in the 1960s after the collapse 
of the ill-fated Federation of the British 
West Indies in 1962. After a vain attempt to 
revive the federalist idea of political unity, 
leaders turned increasingly to the concept 
of economic integration as a means of pre- 
serving ties between the islands and the 
mainland territories of British Honduras 
(Belize) and British Guiana (Guyana). The 
federalist venture, which was singularly en- 
couraged by the colonial power, foundered 
on the rock of personality clashes, conflict- 
ing notions of weak federalism versus 
strong central federalism, freedom of 
movement between territories and insular 
notions of nationalism. 
According to Dr. Eric Williams, noted 
historian and late Prime Minister of Trini- 
dad and Tobago, writing in 1970, “the 
Federal experience as well as the post-inde- 
pendence situation in the Commonwealth 
Caribbean showed that the quest for identi- 
ty and solidarity among the ex-British pos- 
sessions in the Caribbean had to be pursued 
by other means—namely, the method of 
regional economic collaboration and the 
working out of complementary rather than 
competitive strategies of economic 
+ 9 development. 
T HE quest for economic integration in 
1. Eric Williams, From Columbus to Castro, the History 
of the Caribbean, 1492-1969, London, André Deutsch, 
1970. 
It was self-evident in the early 1960s that 
Caribbean countries were linked economi- 
cally more closely to the metropolitan coun- 
tries (in particular the former colonial 
power) than to each other. This factor in 
itself produced and perpetuated vertical, 
bi-lateral trading relations between each 
country on the one hand and countries out- 
side the region on the other hand. As a 
result, intra-regional, horizontal economic 
relations, the development of multilateral 
commerce and the rationalization of fiscal 
and excise policies were non-existent, 
thereby contributing to the continued eco- 
nomic isolation of individual countries. 
In 1965, then, the leaders of Antigua, 
Barbados and British Guiana concluded an 
agreement to establish a Free Trade Area. 
By 1967, other territories had accepted the 
principle of such an association and at the 
Heads of Government Conference in Bar- 
bados in October 1967 adopted a number of 
resolutions aimed at establishing a Carib- 
bean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA); 
creating a Caribbean regional development 
bank; and furthering the integration pro- 
cess. The CARIFTA Agreement, ratified 
by the three founding members at St. 
John’s, Antigua, entered into force on 1 
May 1968. At the same time, other territor- 
ies signed a Protocol of Interest and pledged 
to become members. 
It may be useful at this point to place this 
initial integration effort in perspective. One 
cannot underestimate the economic legacy 
of three centuries of colonialism which

assigned to the Caribbean territories the 
role of producers of primary commodities 
and suppliers of cheap labour for metropo- 
litan consumption. The pattern of single- 
crop industries led to the neglect of diversi- 
fication and accentuated dependence on 
favoured treatment by the colonial power. 
Agricultural production for the domestic 
market and the gradual expansion of the 
industrial base received scant attention, re- 
sulting in the increased vulnerability of 
national economies of the Caribbean. 
Nor can one underestimate the consider- 
able prestige and influence of Sir Arthur 
Lewis on West Indian economic thinking in 
the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s the future 
Nobel Prize-winner in Economics, a citizen 
of Saint Lucia, produced two seminal works 
which left their impact on economic policy 
in the region for some time. In an article 
published in 1950, Sir Arthur argued that: 
“A poor people spends a very high propor- 
tion of its income on food and shelter, and 
only a small proportion on manufactures. 
At their present low standard of living, the 
number of persons for whom West Indians 
can provide employment in manufacturing 
by their own purchases is extremely 
small.”®

was later to be echoed in a classic article in 
which Lewis shows that in a dualistic eco- 
nomy the sector offering higher wages will 
attract labour without necessarily depress- 
ing those of the rival sector when the labour 
supply is precisely “unlimited”.®) Lewis’ 
theory therefore seemed to lay the justifica- 
tion for attracting foreign capital and tech- 
nology which would avail themselves of in- 
expensive labour on the local market. 
The relatively cheap and abundant 
labour supply in Caribbean countries 
prompted political leaders to open their 
economies to the North American multi- 
nationals which installed light manufactur- 
ing plants and benefited from highly attrac- 
tive fiscal incentives. However, their pre- 
sence resulted in investment in capital in- 
tensive activities which hardly addressed 
the root cause of high unemployment: the 
absence of a wide spectrum of agricultural 
and industrial activity supplying both the 
domestic and export markets. Secondly, a

not be re-invested locally so as to contribute 
to the growth of national investment. Third- 
ly, the increasingly high cost of the required 
technology proved frequently beyond the 
means of such small countries. It must also 
be noted that the severely limited tax base 
did not generate the funds necessary for 
major public capital investment in infra- 
structure. 
The foregoing elements demonstrate that 
as these territories moved towards inde- 
pendence in the 1960s and 1970s, they were 
characterized by very small, mono-crop, 
technically and financially weak economies 
producing for limited markets. The prob- 
lem, then, was how best to unite more than 
a dozen territories into a credible economic 
zone in the face of ever rising international 
competition and inflationary pressures, 
compounded by falling prices of non-pet- 
roleum primary commodities. The absence 
of economies of scale and a critical level of 
economic activity underscored the need for 
an institution affording stronger integration 
links than those offered by a Free Trade 
Association. Thus in July 1973 was signed 
the Treaty of Chaguaramas, instituting the 
Caribbean Community and Common Mar- 
ket (CARICOM) providing for increased 
co-operation under three headings: Com- 
mon Market, Functional Co-operation and 
the Co-ordination of Foreign Policy. 
The Treaty of Chaguaramas provides 
for two classifications of Member States. 
Firstly, the More Developed Countries 
(MDCs), comprising Barbados, Guyana, 
Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. 
Secondly, there are the Less Developed 
Countries (LDCs), including Antigua and 
Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, 
Montserrat, Saint Christopher and Nevis, 
Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grena- 
dines. The latter were able, during negotia- 
tions leading up to the Treaty, to persuade 
the MDCs that given their more fragile 
economies they were entitled to special con- 
sideration. The integration movement had 
to take into account the reality of the highly 
uneven economic development of Member 
States and devise mechanisms tending to 
protect the economies of the LDCs. One 
may note, for example, that with a popula- 
tion of 260,000, Barbados has a Gross 
Domestic Product double that of all the 
LDCs combined, which have a population 
of approximately 600,000. 
However intense and sincere might have 
been the underlying intentions and efforts, 
the integration movement clearly could not 
exist in a Caribbean vacuum. Caribbean 
solidarity inevitably had to cope with reali- 
ties external to the region and adapt to the 
shifting tempo of the international econo- 
mic and financial context which dramatical- 
ly changed in 1973; the year of the Cha- 
guaramas Treaty, with the first oil shock. 
Whereas Trinidad and Tobago, with its oil 
resources, was able to profit from the price 
spiral, the other countries, in particular the 
LDCs, were hard pressed by a constantly 
rising energy bill which compromised in- 
vestment capabilities. 
The subsequent conservative political 
reaction, with its inevitable monetarist eco- 
nomic policies and austerity measures, pp

Pp further undermined the thrust towards eco- 
28 
nomic integration. The world recessions of 
1974-1975 and 1981-1983 were to leave their 
mark on struggling Caribbean economies. 
Jamaica and Guyana, both heavily depen- 
dent on their bauxite industry, were the 
hardest hit in the 1970s by the downturn of 
the world economy. In turn, intra-regional 
trade suffered from the slowdown of these 
two important markets, along with that of 
Barbados, which witnessed the tapering off 
of the tourist trade. In 1984 alone, intra- 
regional trade fell by approximately 13 per 
cent. The drop in trade was largely re- 
sponsible for the difficulties of the CARI- 
COM Multilateral Clearing Facility 
(CMCF), which was established in 1977 to 
create an efficient payments system and 
provide short-term credits while ameliorat- 
ing the foreign exchange situation. The 
CMCEF encountered difficulties and lapsed 
into virtual neglect as early as 1982, when 
Guyana defaulted on its payment. 
Any decline in intra-regional trade neces- 
sarily has adverse consequences for all re- 
gional economies and in particular those of 
the LDCs with a weaker base. Certain pro- 
tectionist measures adopted by the MDCs 
could almost be interpreted as punitive ac- 
tions against the free flow of exports from 
the LDCs, for there is little doubt that the 
wider CARICOM market has assumed 
major significance for LDC countries. Be- 
tween 1973 and 1981, exports from LDCs to 
CARICOM increased by over 600 per cent, 
more especially in the area of light manufac- 
tures. However, the problem of market size 
arises whenever a MDC decides to apply 
import restrictions, as decided by Trinidad 
and Tobago, where imports from CARI- 
COM fell by 30 per cent in 1985. 
A further development tending to re- 
inforce the capability of the smaller Eastern 
Caribbean States was the establishment in 
July 1981 of the Organization of Eastern 
Caribbean States (OECS) regrouping Anti- 
gua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, 
Montserrat, Saint Christopher and Nevis, 
Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Gre- 
nadines. In addition to co-operation at the 
political, judicial and cultural levels, the 
OECS Treaty provides for the promotion of 
economic integration. The creation of an 
Economic Affairs Committee and the East 
Caribbean Common Market attests to the 
importance attached by Member States to 
the problem of economic development. 
Yet it must be recognized that the econo- 
mic situation of the early 1980s has acted as 
asevere constraint on these efforts. Despite 
the overall rise in protectionist attitudes, 
the general thrust towards economic in- 
tegration seems to be firmly established in 
the political consciousness of the region. 
New perspectives will need to be explored 
and fully exploited. Among these one may 
cite the possibilities offered under the Lomé 
IIT Agreement. In the final analysis, it is 
perhaps useful to reflect on whether in- 
tegration does not constitute a function of 
economic growth and therefore suffers 
when growth decreases. If the corollary 
holds true, i.e., that integration promotes 
growth, then Caribbean countries have 
established the necessary institutional fab- 
ric to propel such growth inspired by integ- 
ration. But only time will determine which 
of these two possibilities bears the greater 
historical validity. |

of Sao Tomé, with its smaller neigh- 
bour Principe, independence, in 
1975, signalled a fortunate end to a sad and 
violent history. Sparsely settled by Portu- 
guese in the second half of the fifteenth 
century, these tropical islands some 300 
kilometres west of Gabon and Equatorial 
Guinea became, almost at once, a centre of 
the Atlantic slave trade and the scene of a 
slave economy based on crops for export, of 
which cocoa was to be the most valuable. 
Populated initially as a fief of the Portu- 
guese Crown, and later by traders and plan- 
ters from Portugal, the islands gave birth to 
a people of mixed origins—filhos da terra, 
“sons of the country”—whose formal loyal- 
ty was to Portugal but whose inner identity 
remained local to the islands. 
As in the larger Cape Verde archipelago 
to the north, where history took much the 
same course, the “sons of the country” were 
rapidly outnumbered by African captives 
brought in as slave labour from the neigh- 
bouring mainland, but chiefly from the 
lands which became Angola. When slavery 
fell gradually away in the nineteenth cen- 
tury, the same continuous import of main- 
land Africans and Cape Verdeans was en- 
sured to the cocoa plantations by new if 
concealed forms of enslavement or, as it 
was called, “contract labour”. This import 
went on for decades. 
One consequence of this strange history 
was that the people of Sio Tomé and Prin- 
cipe became, and have since remained, an 
authentically African people, even though 
the mythologies of Portuguese imperialism 
have preferred to present them as actually 
or potentially “Portuguese”. Another con- 
sequence was that they shared in the aspira- 
tions and the struggle for independence, 
F's the handsome equatorial island 
Cocoa galore. The principal cash crop of 
Sdo Tomé and Principe, cocoa provides 
80%-90% of the country’s export earnings. 
The cocoa and coffee plantations intro- 
duced in the late 19th century by the Portu- 
guese colonists are today being rehabili- 
tated by the government. Agricultural co- 
operatives are also being created and 
. crops diversified in an attempt to reduce 
dependence on the fluctuating world 
cocoa market and on imported foodstuffs.

Pp from Portugal and its empire, of all the 
African peoples subjected by the soldiers 
and administrators of Lisbon. In 1975 the 
Portuguese administration withdrew with- 
out warfare, and most of the white popula- 
tion left the islands, leaving fewer than 100 
whites in that notable year of anti-colonial 
change. The newly-formed Republic at 
once joined the loosely-organized grouping

Gabon. Some 10,000 Angolan “contract 
workers” went home to their own country 
and its new freedoms, while most of the 
Cape Verdean workers made the same 
choice. Left without any form of modern 
development, the economy of the islands 
has thus required urgent reconstruction, 
while, at the same time, the nationalists 
have had to cope with the problems of 
nation-building in circumstances of often 
acute difficulty. After a number of troubles 
and disputes, the early 1980s brought stabil-

plateau from plains and highlands to the 
east, explored its potential for raising cattle, 
and began to settle here. They were not the 
first people to live in this wide Kalahari 
region, for Stone Age hunters of Khoi ori- 
gins (“Bushmen” in white parlance) had 
long preceded them. But they were the first 
people, supported by their iron-making and 
food-producing skills, to form long-term 
settlements and villages. 
Their achievement was to discover and 
develop a mode of life which could meet the 
challenge of an always low rainfall, limited 
pasture, and natural obstacles to survival 
that were inherent in the conditions they 
encountered. Given such obstacles, the 
BaTswana have repeatedly succeeded by 
means of great persistence, ingenuity and 
courage. In modern times their total num- 
bers, consisting chiefly of eight large ethnic 
groups (all of the Bantu-language family) 
and of several smaller ones, have steadily 
grown in size. Although varying among

themselves, their underlying cultures are 
closely related to each other, and their 
sense of identity is powerfully expressed in 
their Botswana nationhood. While their 
economy has remained largely pastoral, 
they also depend to a small extent on crop 
cultivation. Important mineral discoveries 
have lately begun to provide new sources of 
national wealth. 
One of the world’s richest diamond 
“pipes”—more or less “vertical” rock seams 
“sewn” with industrial diamonds and gem 
stones—was found at Orapa in 1967 and 
began to yield four years later. Another 
such “pipe” was then discovered nearby at 
Letlhakane, and a third, possibly richer 
still, not long after at Jwaneng, where pro- 
duction opened in 1982. By late in the 
1980s, it was thought, these three diamond 
mines would yield as much as 20 per cent of 
world-wide production. Diamonds bring a 
valuable and unexpected source of revenue 
to an otherwise poorly-endowed economy. 
Other mineral sources of revenue, no- 
tably copper and nickel, have yet to meet 
initial expectations of profit, but Bots- 
wana’s large deposits of coal are thought to 
total some 400 million tonnes. While coal- 
Botswana village women dressed in a 
style imported in the 19th century by the 
Rhenish Missionary Society. 
mining remains at a relatively early stage, 
most of what is now produced is already an 
indispensable source of thermally-pro- 
duced electric power. Recent mineral sur- 
veys have indicated the probable or certain 
presence of manganese and other useful 
ores, including uranium. Generally, 
however, this “mineral revolution” has yet 
to get into its stride, while its “spread” of 
resultant benefits so far reaches only a part 
of the population. The government’s prog- 
rammes of development intend to alter this 
situation. The years immediately ahead 
should see progress in this direction. 
Independence brought gains but also 
problems after colonial Bechuanaland be- 
came independent Botswana in 1966. But in 
facing this challenge the country’s political 
parties and their constituent institutions 
have borne witness to a quiet confidence in 
this people’s ability to translate problems 
into solutions. Whatever new difficulties 
have come or may now come from their 
neighbour to the south, the South African 
apartheid State in its endemic instability, 
the BaTswana have had the advantage of a 
very instructive history during the imperial- 
ist period. The birth of their State has not 
rn
 
been easy, and they have had to learn the 
lessons of a stern realism. Their present 
leaders, moreover, can look back to several 
notable predecessors, notably the Chief 
Khama—Khama the Great, as he is not 
unreasonably called—during the late 
nineteenth century, and, more recently, his 
descendant Chief Tskedi Khama. 
These men proved able to meet and 
somewhat mitigate the brusque onset of the 
“modern world” in the abrasive form of 
British and South African imperialism. For 
much of the early colonial period the coun- 
try then known as Bechuanaland was seen 
by leading British imperialists, above all 
Cecil John Rhodes, as little more than a 
“Suez Canal towards the North”. Khama 
and his successors were able to use this 
perception as a means of avoiding complete 
colonial enclosure, and to keep most of 
their country as a “protectorate” which 
allowed a wide margin for their own politic- 
al control. Modern Botswana leaders have 
shown the same political skill in affirming 
and in buttressing their country’s national 
independence. Here is an African country 
and people that have repeatedly shown how 
to develop weakness into strength.

AMED after its famous stone ruins, 
N medievalin date and wholly African 
in conception and construction, the 
splendid country of Zimbabwe may be said 
to stand at the heart of southern African 
history. Every important stage in that his- 
tory, over many centuries, has leftits strong 
and often dramatic mark upon this people 
and their land; and this remains as likely to 
be true in the future as it has been in the 
past. Zimbabwe, in a large historical sense, 
epitomizes all the challenges and ventures 
of the African south, whether for worse or 
for better, in despair or in vivid hope. 
Compared with Botswana, Zimbabwe 
has been blessed by nature, being a land of 
wide pastures, pleasant hills and flowing 
rivers, adequate though seldom abundant 
rainfall except in times of cyclical drought, 
and fruitful human settlement. Since inde- 
pendence came in 1980, democratic policies 
have begun to overcome the gross inequali- 
ties of ownership of land and wealth, as 
between a small minority of white settlers 
and a large majority of indigenous Africans, 
that were imposed, often manu militari, 
during colonial occupation. 
The ancient history of Zimbabwe was 
largely the epic struggle of its Shona people 
to tame this land for human settlement and 
to shape and evolve effective means of self- 
government. Iron Age settlement began 
here some eighteen centuries ago. But it 
was in the tenth century, or soon after, that 
the origins of Shona society began to pro- 
duce the cultures and traditions which have 
governed the Shona down to modern times. 
Shortly after AD 1000, the earliest stone- 
built centres of self-government were raised 
on sites which, later on, became famous for 
the grandeur of their conception and the 
strength with which they were built. By 
1300 or somewhat earlier, using the plenti- 
ful granite of the southeastern plateau, 
powerful rulers had their courts and centres 
of government at various places. The best 
known of these, and certainly the most im- 
pressive, was at Great Zimbabwe, as later 
generations have understandably named it. 
This cluster of Zimbabwe kingdoms, so 
named after a Shona term for a stone build- 
ing, stretched across the central plateau 
down towards the coastland of Mozam- 
bique, and, like other large structures of 
African authority in medieval times, de- 
rived from the dynamics of an internal de- 
velopment as well as from the stimulus of 
long-distance trade. Very competent metal- 
workers and miners, these people were able 
to locate and extract gold from many sur- 
face or near-surface seams across their 
plateau and its eastern hills. At least from 
the tenth century AD, they were trading 
this gold to the city-States of the East Afri- 
can coast, notably those of the Swahili who, 
in turn, exchanged the gold for Indian cot- 
tons and other useful imports from the 
countries of the East. These old kingdoms 
were thus an integral and even an essential 
part of the whole network of Eastern trade 
before the onset of European discovery in 
1498. 
Although a few Europeans, chiefly Por- 
tuguese, were able to penetrate these inland 
kingdoms during the sixteenth century, and 
later to make small settlements along the 
Right, Zimbabweans waiting in the polling

middle and lower Zambezi river, no lasting 
impact from the outside world struck the 
body of the plateau until the 1830s. 
Announcing a time of upheaval, warrior 
groups of the Ndebele (Matabele) people 
then came north over the Limpopo river 
from their troubled homeland in the Zulu 
empire. Searching for a new homeland of 
their own, the Ndebele invaded the wester- 
.ly Shona kingdoms and settled in the Mato- 
po hills, with their capital at Bulawayo. To 
begin with they proved dangerous neigh- 
bours, but settlement gradually rubbed off 
the edges of their aggressiveness. 
But new arrivals in the 1880s again 
announced a time of trouble; and now the 
time would be long and the trouble would 
be great. As part of Britain’s imperial 
“drive to the north”, white soldiers and 
settlers from South Africa were able to take 
possession of all the country of the Shona 
and the Ndebele. They were stubbornly 
resisted, but the automatic firearms of the 
invaders ensured an eventual success. The 
country was enclosed in the British empire 
under the name of Southern Rhodesia, 
although ruled until the 1920s by the British 
South Africa Company which Cecil Rhodes 
had formed for the purpose. 
Lasting until 1980, this colonial period 
produced a white dictatorship, severely 
racist, on lines that were essentially the 
same as those already formed in South Afri- 
ca. Only a daring and often painful counter- 
violence could overthrow that dictatorship: 
begun in the 1960s, this was the war of 
liberation which was crowned by independ- 
ence six years ago. Since then this united 
people has begun to make its own history 
once more, fortified by its long traditions of 
independent development before the com- 
ing of the Europeans, and determined to 
regenerate and modernize the old ancestral 
cultures which rose in the remote past. H

spite of their different geographical situations, 
possess one common feature—their relative 
isolation. 
The world's land-locked countries are: in 
Europe, the principality of Andorra, Austria, the 
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Hungary, Liech- 
tenstein, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia; in 
Africa, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Botswana, 
Lesotho, Mali, Malawi, Niger, Uganda, the Cen- 
tral African Republic, Rwanda, Swaziland, Chad, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe; in Asia, Afghanistan, 
Bhutan, Nepal, the Lao People’s Democratic 
Republic and the Mongolian People’s Republic; 
in South America, Bolivia and Paraguay. 
Some of these States owe their existence to 
the preservation of a strong ethnic and cultural 
originality and of forms of social and economic 
organization which have enabled them to survive 
in spite of outside pressures. A number of them 
are set within a barrier of mountains: the Hima- 
layas in the case of Nepal and Bhutan, the 
Drakensbergs in the case of Lesotho, and the 
Alps in the case of Switzerland. Others were 
deprived of access to the sea as a result of the 
dislocation of the Austro-Hungarian, Spanish, 
French, Belgian and British empires. 
These countries form an extremely disparate 
group. They differ in terms of history, their en- 
dowment of natural resources and their political 
systems. Nevertheless they do share, especially 
if they are developing countries, a number of 
broad general features. 
Land-locked States are, for example, general- 
ly speaking less wealthy, less populous and 
| sc States and land-locked States, in 
smaller than coastal States. In addition, the prop-.

Land-locked islands 
ortion of the working population engaged in agri- 
culture is much higher than that engaged in 
industry and the services sector correspondingly 
lower. Finally, perhaps because of the absence 
of ports as centres of natural growth, the percen- 
tage of the population living in urban areas is far 
lower than in coastal States. 
The land-locked problem affects all aspects of 
development, but its consequences are most 
severe in the field of external trade. Most land- 
locked countries are remote from world markets; 
imports and exports must be shipped through 
another State, in some cases several States. 
This gives rise to additional costs which reduce 
the competitivity of their products on overseas 
markets and have a negative effect on their 
balance of payments as a result of higher import 
bills and currency outflows. 
Lack of access to the sea also causes legal, 
administrative and political problems. Land-lock- 
ed countries have to negotiate to meet their 
transit requirements, and the facilities provided 
may not in every case be satisfactory because 
the transit countries have their own development 
priorities and problems, which are often acute. 
They may, for example, impose cumbersome 
documentary procedures and formalities in order 
to safeguard their interests which could be 
jeopardized by the diversion of transit cargoes to 
their domestic markets. Transit countries may 
also wish to limit the use of certain routes within 
the context of an overall economic policy. Land- 
locked countries, furthermore, have to incur 
additional storage expenses in order to maintain 
inventories in ports or to anticipate possible inter- 
ruptions in transit-transport services. The fact 
  
that they are at the mercy of technical incidents, 
natural disasters, industrial disputes, political 
troubles and even international conflicts, pro- 
vides some indication of their dependence and 
the precariousness of their situation. 
Fifteen of the land-locked developing coun- 
tries belong to the category of least developed 
countries. Their remoteness from world markets 
has compounded their problem of extreme 
underdevelopment and made their economies 
particularly vulnerable. They have been hard hit 
by the overall deterioration of the world economy 
in recent years, and by the natural disasters 
which have stricken the greater part of Africa, 
where most of them are located. 
The international community has come to rec- 
ognize that land-locked developing countries 
cannot overcome on their own the formidable 
obstacles that face them. Several regional and 
international organizations, including the United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD), have over the last decade been 
actively seeking solutions to the special prob- 
lems faced by these countries. |

### 70716: The Land of the dragon

  
- The land 
of the dragon 
by Rigzin Dorji 
gon”, known to the outside world as 
Bhutan, is a land-locked Himalayan 
kingdom. The southern frontier with India 
follows the line of the tropical foothills 
overlooking the Indian plains, and is almost 
at sea level. The northern frontier with the 
Tibet region of China is formed by great 
snowclad ranges in which numerous peaks 
soar to above 6,000 metres. 
Agricultural Bhutanese are valley- 
dwellers and live beside the rapidly flowing 
rivers that rise in the snowy heights. These 
perennial rivers, once looked upon only as a 
source of irrigation, are now being harnes- 
sed for hydro-electric power. They are fed 
by hundreds of tributaries that keep the 
fields green and productive. 
Although closely linked to Tibet and In- 
dia culturally, Bhutan maintained its inde- 
pendence and individuality over the centu- 
ries by deliberately following a systematic 
policy of isolationism which earned for the 
country the reputation of being the world’s 
last “Forbidden Kingdom”. This policy was 
pursued until 1952, when the third heredi- 
tary monarch, the late King Jigme Dorji 
Wangchuck, ascended the throne. He re- 
alized that the old policy of isolation was 
causing Bhutan to remain socially, econo- 
mically and politically backward. Gradua- 
lly, so as not to upset old traditions, but 
firmly in accordance with modern needs, he 
introduced administrative reforms, and in 
1961 launched the first of a series of Five 
Year Plans. 
In a country where there had been no 
wheel other than the continuously-turning 
prayer wheel, no electricity, no post offices, 
no modern schools or hospitals, and little 
other sign of the twentieth century, traditio- 
nal barriers suddenly began to collapse. 
Roads began to be built, and up them came 
the carefully sifted benefits of the modern 
outside world. Today, under the leadership 
of the young king Jigme Singye Wang- 
chuck, crowned in 1974, the country is all 
set to achieve a happy co-existence of tra- 
dition and progress in the best interests of 
| ) re “The Land of the Dra- There are three distinct ethnic elements 
in the population. The first comprises the 
descendants of the original inhabitants, 
who live in the eastern part of the country. 
The second ethnic element consists of the 
descendants of immigrants from Tibet, who 
occupy the western region. The third com- 
prises the Nepalese settlers who began to 
immigrate to Bhutan at the turn of the 
twentieth century. They are found exclu- 
sively in the hot and humid southern dis- 
tricts of the country adjoining India. 
The State religion is Buddhism, which 
was introduced into Bhutan towards the 
second half of the eighth century AD. The 
first monastic body was established in the 
seventeenth century with thirty monks 
only. There are now about 6,000 State-sup- 
ported monks. No account of the religious 
life of the country would be complete with- 
out mentioning the mask dances. At various 
festivals, both monks and laity expert in the 
art of dramatic dance and music, don rich 
robes of China silk and brocade and fantas- 
tic masks representing deities, legendary 
personages and demons. As the day of the 
festival draws near, large crowds of people 
flock in from the countryside to see the 
sacred mask dance which represents the 
Buddha in various manifestations. It is be- 
lieved that the very act of watching the 
dance helps people to acquire spiritual 
merit and to achieve liberation from world- 
ly suffering. 
Bhutan is a friendly and hospitable coun- 
try. Meetings are generally acknowledged 
with an exchange of silk or cotton scarves. 
Butter, tea and saffron-coloured rice are 
served as a gesture of hospitality. When 
Bhutanese pass each other at a distance on 
their travels they call and yodel to each 
other. Dzongkha is the country’s national 
language. In official correspondence both 
English and Dzongkha are used. 
The Bhutanese build imposingly large

or three storeys high, with shingled roofs.

vals, so called because the 12 great epi- 
sodes by which he is remembered all took 
place on the tenth day (tshechu) of the 
month at different periods of his life. One 
of Bhutan’s most renowned Tshechu fes- 
tivals is that of Paro, a valley in the western 
part of the country. During the festival 
religious and folk dances are performed 
for five consecutive days. The dancers, 
above, wear sumptuous costumes and 
fantastic masks representing deities,

and odds and ends. The houses are cons- 
tructed in a distinctive architectural style; 
the windows, doors and roof beams are 
painted in glowing earth colours. All 
government buildings, both official and re- 
sidential, are required to adhere to traditio- 
nal Bhutanese style on the exterior, though 
every modern convenience may be em- 
ployed within. 
The Bhutanese are experts in arts and 
crafts. Artists excel in mural and scroll 
painting, and craftsmen create mastet- 
pieces in silver, gold, copper and brass. 
Bronze-casting, used largely in image-ma- 
king, is an ancient art form, as is wood- 
carving, to be seen at its best in the gilded 
chapels of monasteries and castles. Bhuta- 
nese craftsmen also make temple-bells, 
swords and daggers. 
Handloom weaving of woollen, silk and 
cotton textiles is practised in almost every 
home. Women wear small fortunes in hand- 
woven cloths and take pride in outfitting 
their men. Basket- and bamboo-weaving is 
commonplace and is used for making food 
baskets, water containers, hats, quivers and 
other attractive items of everyday use. 
Archery is the national sport of Bhutan 
and a favourite pastime of young and old. 
Competitions between villages are impor- 
tant events during which the local divini- 
ties confront one another through the 
medium of opposing teams. Each team is 
advised by an astrologer, and backed by 
supporters and dancers who try hard to 
encourage their own side and dishearten 
their opponents.

Archery is the national sport in a country 
whose people are extremely sports-minded. 
Other major sports-are soccer, basketball, 
volleyball, badminton, tennis and table 
tennis. 
The great bulk of Bhutan’s trade is with 
India and with other neighbouring coun- 
tries. The main exports are timber, min- 
erals and agricultural products. Other ex- 
port commodities include liquor and can- 
ned fruit products. Cardamom and Bhuta- 
nese handicrafts are also exported to the 
Middle East and Western Europe. 
The population is increasing rapidly 
every year as a result of effective health 
measures taken by the government. Most of 
the diseases which used to take a heavy toll 
of human lives have been controlled. As a 
result of this demographic growth more and 
more fallow land is being brought under 
cultivation and forests are being cleared for 
new settlements. There is no unemploy- 
ment, and in fact, there is an acute shortage 
of both skilled and unskilled labour. Due to 
the heavy demand for such labour, wages 
are increasing every year. To meet the la- 
bour shortage, manpower is being imported 
from neighbouring countries.

One of the symbols of Buddhism, the chor- 
ten is a small religious construction 
erected in memory of a great lama, or to 
ward off evil spirits. The chorten of Chen- 
denji, right, is exceptional because of its 
size. Nearby, local basket weavers make 
fencing and a variety of household ob- 
jects.

captivated by a grandiose, rocky land- 
scape with many tumbling waterfalls. He cannot 
fail to see, carved in huge letters on a bare 
rockface, this maxim of the late King Jigme Dorji 
Wangchuck: “Work with Nature”. This exhorta- 
tion by the father of the present sovereign, King 
Jigme Singye Wangchuck, also holds good for 
the engineers and planners of today, and reflects 
the major concern of a man who, like his sub- 
jects, himself lived in harmony with nature, which 
is here beautiful, generous and treated with re- 
spect. 
The landscape, shaped by man, reveals a 
sequence of surfaces which are often depicted in 
Bhutanese religious painting and hold deep sig- 
nificance. At the lowest level flows the river, with 
its corbelled bridges, and its water mills; on its 
cultivated banks are fields dotted with farm- 
houses and their outbuildings; higher up stands 
the temple or monastery, to which lead tracks 
punctuated by chérten (religious constructions at 
which offerings are made); higher still, the dzong 
or fortress dominates these scattered set- 
tlements; finally, the mountain ridge with its 
dense and sombre covering of larch and pine 
stands out against the sky. 
The dwelling house is unquestionably the 
T- traveller coming from the south who 


### 70718: In harmony with nature

In harmony with nature 
most remarkable element in this whole picture: a 
massive construction in rammed earth on two or 
three levels, it is so proportioned and decorated 
that it fits harmoniously into the landscape; the 
facade is adorned with wooden panels, often 
carved and painted; the roof widely overhangs 
the walls on each side, as if simply set down on 
top of the building. 
The feeling of harmony inspired by the sight of 
these structures deepens as one comes to 
understand their symbolism, in which a part is 
played by the choice of site (which must not 
offend the divinity which owns the ground) and by 
the final consecration ceremony, which takes 
place when the roof is putin place. The house in 
its entirety is conceived as a microcosm of a 
world which also has three storeys. 
In terms of size, the dzong is the most impor- 
tant building in Bhutan. It combines defensive, 
administrative and religious functions, and is 
occupied by monks and regional administration 
officials. Its plan may vary depending on the 
nature of the site, but the same features are 
always found: high surrounding walls gradually 
tapering inwards, pierced by several loopholes; 
large paved courtyards; a central tower; temples 
and meeting halls for the monks. 
Increasingly aware of the value of its 
architectural heritage, the royal government of 
by Corneille Jest 
Bhutan has laid down standards for new build- 
ings which attach particular importance to the 
facades, which must be in the traditional style. 
Restoration work is carried out along the same 
lines, using local materials. New buildings such 
as the hospital devoted to traditional medicine, 
and the national library, are built in the purest 
Bhutanes# style. 
Closed to foreigners until a short time ago, 
Bhutan is classed among the least developed 
countries according to the criteria of a world in 
which scientific and industrial development is 
considered the most effective, if not the only, 
motive force; but this is a world to which Bhutan 
does not belong. 
Bhutan's own values provide grounds for re- 
flection and much can be learned from them. The 
wealth of its traditions cannot be measured, still 
less “exploited”; it is to be hoped that material 
progress, desirable though it be, will leave these 
traditions intact. [|

### 70719: 1986: Year of Peace, 10

1986: Year of Peace/10 
  
Among the events marking the Internation- 
al Year of Peace, a Congress of Intellectuals 
for the Peaceful Future of the World was held 
in Warsaw (Poland) in January 1986. The 250 
participants included scientists, writers and 
artists from 54 countries representing all the 
world regions. The discussions, devoted to 
the main dangers threatening international 
peace and security, ended with the proclama- 
tion of a Message, salient passages of which 
are published below. 
E, intellectuals, have assembled in 
the heroic city of Warsaw, city of 
peace, to defend the peaceful future 
of the world. Anxiety about the destiny of the 
world has brought us here. Anxiety about our 
homes and cities, anxiety about our science 
and culture. The threat of total annihilation 
hangs over us. Differences of outlook notwith- 
standing, we express in our diverse lan- 
guages our common conviction that our prime 
task is to defend the universal values of cul- 
ture. At this decisive moment in history we 
declare ourselves in favour of life. We declare 
ourselves in favour of peace and co-oper- 
ation, against war and the arms race which 
leads to war. 
Weapons will not preserve our future. We 
are convinced that the production and accu- 
mulation of weapons of mass extermination 
cannot be justified by the needs of national or 
international security. Weapons are an unim- 
aginable waste of the world's material and 
  
intellectual resources. They lead to greater 
inequalities in the level and quality of life. We 
declare our support for disarmament in all its 
aspects. The threat of the extension of 
weapons into space fills us with anxiety and 
terror. 
A durable peace depends on the renuncia- 
tion of force in international relations and on 
the peaceful settlement of all conflicts, the 
establishment of confidence and détente, and 
disarmament, With this in view we must stop 
the race leading to the destruction of our 
civilization, to the annihilation of the spiritual 
and material heritage of humanity. 
In the nuclear era, an armed conflict would 
solve no problem. There would be neither 
victors nor vanquished. Peace is our fun- 
damental common value. The right to life, to 
live in peace, is the right which underlies all 
human rights, the first condition for the 
realization of political, social, economic and 
cultural rights. 
Peace is also threatened by the aggrava- 
tion of injustices in economic relationships. In 
spite of enormous advances made within our 
civilization, the numbers of the hungry, the 
homeless, the unemployed, and the sick are 
growing. 
The survival of humanity thus depends on 
finding urgent solutions to crises with 
worldwide ramifications: the food and energy 
crises, crises of ecology and massive debt. 
Common global problems will only be solved 
through global co-operation. 
Wars are born in the hearts and minds of 
men. The construction of peace begins with 
education in the spirit of peace, with the pre- 
paration of peoples to live in peace. 
Science and technology create a better 
world as long as they contribute to the creative 
development of man and not to his destruc- 
tion. We declare ourselves in favour of free- 
dom of scientific research and of the general 
availability of the achievements of world 
science. 
We express the hope that literature, the arts 
and education will play a greater role in the 
formation of human attitudes. 
We consider that nothing divides us in our 
aspiration to provide present and future gen- 
erations with the opportunity to live in peaceful 
conditions, to live a life worthy of man. 
We hope that the International Year of 
Peace will bring, in conformity with the spirit of 
Geneva, a decisive improvement in the rela- 
tions between East and West and an end to 
wars on all the continents. 
We support the efforts of the United Nations 
in favour of international security and peaceful 
co-operation between States. These efforts 
spring from the ideals of the Charter of the 
United Nations and conform to the expecta- 
tions of peoples. 
Gathered at the Congress of Intellectuals in 
Warsaw, we appeal: 
e for renunciation of force in international 
relations, for an end to the arms race, for 
renunciation of space weapons programmes, 
for the liquidation of atomic weapons during 
this century; 
e for the International Year of Peace to mark 
the start of an era of Peace on our Earth. I
