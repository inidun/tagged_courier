This is a rare photograph of that elu- 
sive monster the “Dragon of Komodo”, 
a giant lizard, 10 to 20 feet long, still 
found in parts of Indonesia. One of 
the world's last surviving prehistoric 
animals, its massive body and giant tail 
and claws are reminiscent of the dino- 
saurs that once roamed the Earth. This 
living fossil could well symbolize war— 
that other anachronistic fossil of today.

WAR 
OR 
PEACE? 
Arab refugees 
in the Middle East. 
Ts issue of the “Unesco Courier” goes to press 
at a time when peace in our world is poised over a precipice. 
Wars and conflicts, though “limited” in nature, have spread 
a broad swathe of death and destruction across many lands. 
And no sooner has one area of conflict ceased firing than 
the flames seem to attack another. At the same time the 
spectre of the nuclear and “conventional” arms race 
continues with mounting ominousness, 
Just under three years ago, the “Unesco Courier” 
reported, in an issue devoted to the problems of 
disarmament (Nov. 1964) that the world’s expenditure 
on arms had reached the astronomical figure of 
$ 120,000,000,000 a year. Today we are spending incredibly 
higher sums, and the arms race mania is engulfing many 
more countries. 
Despite this—or rather because of all this—the voices 
that are being raised to put an end to the headlong race 
towards Armageddon are growing louder and louder. 
Resort to violence, as a means of settling differences, is 
being denounced more vehemently than ever before. And 
for millions upon millions of people everywhere in the 
world, war today is seen for what it really is—man's 
greatest folly, a monstrous anachronism in an age where 
the survival of humanity itself is at stake, 
Last November, the Plenary Session of the General 
Conference of Unesco adopted a resolution which called 
on all its Member States to reject war once and for all as an 
instrument of national policy and to condemn all forms of 
direct and indirect aggression and interference in the 
domestic affairs of States; to renounce recourse to vio-

lence in settling their differences; respect the right of 
all nations to self-determination and independence; and to 
take all action to contribute to an agreement on general 
and complete disarmament under international control. 
The resolution also called on Unesco, as a world 
organization, “to disseminate the truth that war is no longer 
a possible solution to man’s problems,” and adopted as 
Unesco’s mandate the U.N. Secretary-General’s request 
that “Unesco bring home, at all times, to all peoples and 
governments in all parts of the world, what war means 
today.” It recalled U Thant’s message to Unesco in which 
he declared that “in the past 20 years, the very progress 
of science and technology has brought new, terrible and 
ever-present dangers to mankind as a whole, the dangers 
inherent in the new weapons of mass destruction.” 
It is to this purpose that the present issue of the “Unesco 
Courier” is devoted: on the one hand, to review the 
situation created by the present arms race with its 
escalation of nuclear weapons; on the other, to underline 
the urgency of reaching agreement on practical methods 
for the de-escalation of arms and weapons, that is, 
disarmament, and the no less urgent task of assuring the 
peaceful growth and progress of all countries, developed 
and developing alike. 
Which is it going to be? The way of the dinosaur and 
the end of our species; or a united world building a 
common future? It is up to the peoples and governments 
of all nations to face the reality that all men have a 
common destiny today, and that that destiny must be to 
build a world community in peace by a combined effort.

### 15004: Inquiry into a disarmed world

  
First results of IN o]V]1°3% INTO 
DISA 
an international poll 
 
undertaken with 
 
the aid of Unesco 
How do people today visualize the 
future of the world? A vast international 
inquiry based on public opinion polls has been 
in progress for the past three years in an 
effort to obtain an answer. The poll is being 
carried out by the European Co-ordination 
Centre for Social Research and Documenta- 
tion, in Vienna Austria, an independent unit 
of the International Social Science Council, 
with the financial aid of Unesco. 
The inquiry is divided into two stages. The 
first, on the theme Image of a Disarmed World 
was carried out in three countries, France, 
Norway and Poland, under the direction of 
Professor Jean Stoetzel, of the University of 
Paris, and is now completed. The second 
stage is at present getting under way and 
will comprise an even more far-reaching pro- 
gramme of inquiry on the theme The World 
in Year 2,000. 
The public opinions polls for the second 
 
stage will cover at least 13 countries (Czech- 
oslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Federal Rep- 
ublic of Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, 
Poland, U.K,, U.S.S.R., Sweden and Yugosla- 
via), under the over-all direction of Professor 
Johan Galtung of the International Institute of 
Peace Research in Oslo, Norway. The inquiry 
will make it a special point to poll the opinions 
of young people, particularly with regard to 
their views about a world in the process of 
partial or total disarmament. The full inquiry, 
along with an analysis of the findings, is not 
expected to be completed before several 
years. 
On the following pages, the “Unesco 
Courier” is pleased to present some of the 
first results of the inquiry on the Image of a 
Disarmed World. Some 5,000 persons, com- 
prising a representative sampling of the popu- 
lations of France, Norway and Poland, were 
interviewed at their homes during the winter

### 15004: Inquiry into a disarmed world

INQUIRY INTO A DISARMED WORLD (Continued) 
of 1964-1965. The French poll was carried 
out by the French Institute of Public Opinion 
under the supervision of Madame Héléne 
Riffault; the Norwegian survey, by the Inter- 
national Institute of Peace Research in Oslo, 
under Johan Galtung; and the Polish inquiry 
by the Polish Institute of Public Opinion, 
under Professor A. Sicinski. 
Persons polled were all 18 years or older, 
of both sexes, and were asked to reply to a 
series of some 30 questions on aspects of 
disarmament and world affairs. The initial 
inquiry sought to determine, first, how well 
informed people are on international affairs 
generally, and to what extent they are inte- 
rested in such problems. Another series of 
questions sought their views on the prospects 
of disarmament, and how they thought resour- 
ces thus released could best be used. 
A detailed analysis of the replies should 
help to throw light on the attitudes and values 
that influence public opinion on such ques- 
tions as disarmament, and may be extremely 
helpful in revealing factors most likely to 
contribute to the attainment of world peace. 
Already, however, one point is quite clear. 
The polls carried out thus far in countries 
‘with widely differing social and economic 
systems, foreign policies and cultural and his- 
torical backgrounds, might have been expect- 
ed to reveal widely differing points of view. 
The contrary has been found to be true with 
a striking identity of views on most of the 
questions asked. Although this first stage of 
the inquiry was limited to three countries, its 
results suggest that it may well be a preview 
of general opinion regarding attitudes towards 
the world of tomorrow in which armaments 
are drastically reduced or completely 
discarded.

PHILIP NOEL-BAKER, one of the world's 
leading authorities on questions of disar- 
mament, was awarded the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 1959. He has devoted many years 
to research on problems of peace and 
disarmament and has written numerous 
works on these subjects, including "Disar- 
mament" (1926); “The Private Manufacture 
of Armaments” (1936); “The Arms race: 
A Programme for World Disarmament” 
(1958) and many other studies. In 1932 he 
attended the League of Nations Conference 
in Geneva, the first of the major world 
conferences on disarmament, in which 64 
countries took part. Philip Noel-Baker has 
been a member of two British Govern- 
ments (1942-1945 and 1945-1951) and is 
a member of the present British Parlia- 
ment. In November 1966 on the occasion 
of Unesco’s 20th anniversary celebrations, 
he took part in the round table meeting 
which appraised Unesco’'s contribution to 
peace (see page 64). Philip Noel-Baker 
has always been closely associated with 
sport. He was a member of the British 
Olympic track team in 1912, 1920 and 
1924 ; team captain in 1920 and 1924 and 
silver medalist in 1820. He is now presi- 
dent of the International .Council of Sport 
and Physical Education. 
“The time Is not far distant when man will 
get hold of Atomic Energy—a source of 
power which will enable him to bulld hls 
life as he likes . . . Will man be able to make 
use of this power and direct it for good, 
and not for self-destruction? Is he old 
enough to know how to utillze the power 
which Science must Inevitably give him?" 
Academician V. I. Vernadsky of the 
U.S.S.R., February 1922 
“Sclence has been glamorized for so long 
that many people firmly believe It can do no 
wrong." 
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, 1963 
W.. the beginning of the 
modern arms race about a hundred 
years ago, science and engineering 
became the major factors in prepara- 
tion for war. Until then, manpower— 
numbers, training and discipline—had 
been of decisive importance in deter- 
mining a nation's military strength. 
During and after the Franco-Prussian 
war, the importance of armament— 
weapons, equipment, armour, trans- 
port, signals—rapidly increased. 
Expenditure on ordnance and warships 
grew greater every year. 
Before the First World War began, 
the General Staffs had grasped the 
fact that superior armament might be 
decisive. During the First World War, 
new weapons were introduced, to the 
production of which scientists had 
made their contribution—aircraft, poi- 
son gas, flame-throwers, tanks, and 
many more. Before the Second World 
War far-seeing members of the Brit- 
ish and German General Staffs had 
invited eminent scientists to join their 
Defence Departments as permanent 
advisers. 
But it was only after the Second 
World War had actually begun that the 
military leaders of the belligerents 
fully grasped the proposition which 
Professor Isidor Rabi long afterwards 
expressed as follows: “The combin- 
ing of military techniques and science 
makes it easy to apply scientific prin- 
ciples to kill people—who are not 
strong structures.” (1). 
From 1939 onwards, scientists came 
in mounting numbers into every war 
department; military research was 
rapidly expanded; scientific methods 
were applied by leading scientists to 
the actual conduct of operations by 
land, sea and air. After the war was 
over, this process did not stop. On 
the contrary, it has continued with 
accelerating momentum until today. 
This has revolutionized the arma- 
ments that governments maintain, and 
the training of their national forces. In 
consequence, it has changed the prob- 
lems of disarmament and has made 
it essential that the scientists should 
play a leading part in disarmament 
negotiations. 
.In the League of Nations Conference 
of 1932, the major problems to be 
solved were the techniques by which 
manpower could be equitably reduced 
and limited; the abolition of military 
aircraft; naval disarmament, by the 
abolition of “capital” ships and sub- 
marines, and the limitation of other 
vessels; budgetary reduction and 
control.

fessor Rabi was chalrman of President 
Eisenhower's Scientific Advisory Committee 
and has been consultant of the Military 
Research and Development Board since 1946;

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
paratory Commission and in the con- 
ference Itself were more thorough, 
more serious, and technically much 
more successful than any that have 
taken place since 1945. They were 
conducted by leading statesmen who 
had military and civil service advisers 
to help them, Every technical problem 
of a general disarmament treaty was 
satisfactorily solved; only the political. 
decision to sign the treaty was requir 
ed.” Much of the work done (for 
example, on the four problems men- 
tioned above) still remains valid today. 
Yet it is doubtful if a single scientist 
was present in the League commission 
and conference from first to last. 
Things are different now. Scien- 
tists have made the modern weapons; 
they must play a major part in solving 
the . new technical problems which 
these weapons involve, and in draft- 
ing the ‘detailed clauses of the disar- . 
.mament treaty; they must help'to form 
the public opinion by which a treaty * 
can be carried through. 
The following table of expenditure 
"by two important countries shows how 
“the combining of military techniques 
and science” has expanded since 
1939 (1).

(1) In considering the meaning of these 
figures, allowance must be made for the 
factor of inflation. At 1953 prices, the United 
Kingdom figure would be £210 million, i.e., 
in real terms it had more than doubled in 
ten years. (E = 28 dollars at the current 
exchange rate.) 
There are no figures publicly avail- 
able which show United States and 
United Kingdom expenditure during 
the war years. But Dr. Vannevar 
Bush has described the creation of 
the Military Research Organisation of 
which he was the head in the United 
States; he had 35,000 scientists under 
his direction. In addition there was 
the very large international team, under 
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, working on 
the Manhattan District Project for the 
production of the first atomic bomb. 
These are large figures; but the num- 
bers, both in the United States and 
the United Kingdom, have greatly 
increased since then. In his Econom- 
ic Message to Congress in January 
1963, President Kennedy said: “The 
defence, space and atomic energy 
activities of the country absorb about 
two-thirds of the trained people avail- 
able for exploring our scientific and 
technical frontiers.”

research. But 
«words were true of both countries 
“We have paid a price * 
by sharply limiting the scarce scien-’ 
“when he said: 
A small part of “atomic energy acti- 
vities of the country” is devoted to 
civil ends; thus it is perhaps true to 
say that 60 per cent of the United Sta- 
tes scientific and technical experts are 
engaged in military work. The propor- 
tion in the United Kingdom is less; 
"20 per cent of the experts, and 40 per 
cent of the national expenditure on 
President Kennedy's 
tific and engineering’ resources avail- 
able to the civilian sectors of the eco- 
nomy.” 
The scale of the enterprises made 
possible by a budget of $ 13,400 mil- 
lion is immense. In the platform 
adopted by the Democratic Party for 
the presidential election in August 
1964, President ‘Johnson pledged him- 
self to “maintain the world’s {argest 
military = research and; development 
effort, which has initiated more than 
200 new programmes since 1961, to 
ensure American leadership in wea- 
pons systems and equipment”.

since 1945 
  
There is no information about the 
Soviet Government's expenditure on 
military research: but its startling 
achievements in multi-megaton nuclear 
weapons, ICBMs (intercontinental bal- 
listic missiles), sputniks and space 
flight show that it must be very high. 
It is known that the Soviet General 
Staff have devoted much attention to 
tactical nuclear weapons and to other 
types of new weapons. 
There is no doubt that other govern- 
ments are doing the same. It was 
recently revealed that French expendi- 
ture on military research had been 
greatly increased. It is unlikely that 
German and {talian expenditure is much 
less. Mainland China, India, Israel, 
Pakistan, the U.A.R. and many other 
countries certainly have military re- 
search establishments, though prob- 
ably as yet on a much smaller scale. 
If increased power of offensive 
attack is the purpose ‘of military 
research, then the governments have 
certainly got their money's worth. All 
the weapons of offence used against 
Hitler—aircraft, tanks, artillery, sub- 
marines—have been enormously “im- 
proved”. New weapons of every des- 
cription have been added. Three cate- 
gories of weapons of mass destruction 
—nuclear, chemical and biological— 
have been developed. 
Although it seemed in 1955 that the 
“ultimate” weapons had been devised, 
everything produced in that year is long 
since out of date; there is now a total 
revolution in military equipment every 
five years. Professor Rabi has warn- 
ed us that the “progress” made in 
the next -twenty years will be no less 
rapid or dramatic than that of the last 
twenty. 
Conventional weapons 
 
It is already difficult to remember 
that in May 1945, when Hitler's Ger- 
many surrendered, there were no nu- 
clear weapons; no ballistic missiles 
except Hitler's rudimentary V2; no air- 
craft that could travel faster than 
400 m.p.h.; no bomber with a range of 
more than 1,000 miles. There were no 
nuclear-powered submarines or sur- 
face vessels; the conventional torpedo 
was still the deadliest naval weapon. 
Potent new poison gases had been 
prepared by German chemists, but 
Hitler's subordinates, - already con-- 
scious of defeat, had successfully pre- 
vented them from being used. Both 
sides had arsenals of “biologicals”, 
but dared not risk the general oppro- 
brium and the strategic hazards which 
their employment would have meant. 
Broadly, up to the day when Hitler fell, 
the war had been fought with improved 
versions of the conventional weapons 
produced by the First World War. 
Twenty years later, those conven- 
tional weapons have been further and 
enormously improved. 
Two of the latest types of United 
States’ military aircraft are the B-58 
and the B-70. The B-68 can carry a 
50-megaton load of bombs, i.e. the 
equivalént of 50 million tons of TNT. 
It has travelled from New England to 
Paris in just over three hours. The 
B-70 is designed to travel at three 
times the speed of sound; if it Is cons- 
tructed in numbers for the United Sta- 
tes Air Force, it will cost $§ 100 million 
per aircraft. The British TSR-2, if it 
were built, would “hedge-hop” at twice 
the speed of sound; it could be guid- 
ed by instruments to its target and 
back: the pilot need only interfere if 
something went wrong. All these air- 
craft, refueled in the air, would have 
a range of many thousands of miles. 
The modern submarine is propelled 
by nuclear power. It can cruise for 
thousands of miles, and for periods 
of weeks, without coming to the sur- 
face. It can navigate under the Arctic 
ice-cap, and can break the ice and fire 
its missiles. Or it can fire its missiles 
from many feet below the surface of 
the open sea. 
The United States Government is 
now installing what President Johnson 
called “the new over-the-horizon 
radars giving us almost instantaneous 
knowledge of ballistic missiles launch- 
ed for attack”. Aerial reconnais- 
sance photography has been so much 
improved that a handful of aircraft 
could photograph the whole of Russia

in a few hours; from a height of 
60,000 feet, they could reveal the smal- 
lest objects (a golf ball) on the ground. 
Similar improvements have been 
made in tanks, artillery, naval surface 
vessels, especially aircraft carriers and 
amphibious landing vessels, and even 
in rifles, machine guns, and all the 
other conventional weapons of the 
Second World War, 
But most attention, and most expen- 
diture, has been concentrated on the 
weapons of mass destruction. 
Nuclear weapons 
 
The basic facts about nuclear wea- 
pons are well known: the Hiroshima 
bomb was more than 1,000 times as 
powerful as the conventional “block- 
busters” used by the RAF against Ber- 
lin; the 20-megaton (1) weapons now 
carried by United States bombers— 
and no doubt by Soviet bombers too 
—are more than one thousand times 
as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb. 
Thus the “yield” of the unit of air 
attack deliverable by a single bomber 
has been multiplied a million times. 
One 20-megaton weapon is equivalent 
to nearly fourteen times the explosive 
power of all the bombs dropped by 
all the Allies on Germany in six years 
of war. We forget that almost all the 
cities of Germany lay in ruins in 1945, 
One 20-megaton bomb 
more devastating 
than 1,000 
Hiroshima bombs 
  
The 20-megaton bombs exist in large 
numbers. They can be delivered by 
United States B-52 bombers, by the 
obsolescent B-47, the B-58, by the 
Soviet Bear and Bison, and the British 
V bombers, and by some types of 
Soviet intercontinental ballistic mis- 
siles. 
But many authorities believe that a 
20-megaton bomb is larger than any 
military or civilian target would require. 
The British Home Office Manuals of 
Civil Defence calculate the results of 
a 10-megaton bomb on London; if it 
were “dropped centrally”, there would 
be “irreparable damage over most of 
the London County Council area” (i.e. 
a. circle of total destruction roughly 
eight miles across) “with minor 
damage over the whole of the metro- 
politan area” (a circle perhaps 
thirty-two miles across). In most 
other British cities, however, a good 
deal of potential damage would 
consist of open country.” 
in other words, there is only one 
target in the United Kingdom large 
enough to need a 10-megaton bomb 
for its total destruction. In fact a 
1-megaton bomb would probably 
put all but the largest cities out of 
action. The new United States 
submarine missile, Poseidon, which 
is replacing the Polaris A3, has a 
yield of 1.5 megatons (i.e. 75 times 
Hiroshima.) Its greater yield is due 
to the newly discovered, and more 
potent, nuclear explosive, pluto- 
nium-241. In 1961, the U.S.S.R. 
exploded a 57-megaton bomb, and 
boasted not without reason that it 
could have been 100 megatons. 
It has been calculated that the 
United States has a stockpile of 
nuclear weapons with a total yield 
of 50,000 to 60,000 megatons; the 
Soviet Union a stockpile of 
20,000 megatons or more; the 
British and French much less. The 
United States stockpile includes “tens 
of thousands of ‘tactical’ weapons”. 
The United States Secretary of State 
for Defence, Mr. McNamara, has warn- 
ed us that new processes may soon 
make the production of nuclear wea- 
pons cheaper and easier than it is 
now. He has said that, in spite of 
“fail safe” and the “permissive link" 
(sometimes called the “electronic 
key”) and other devices to guard 
against technical and human failure, 
there remains a grave danger of “acci- 
dental” or “unintended” nuclear war. 
Biological weapons 
 
In the view of some qualified au- 
thorities, the menace of biological 
weapons is now hardly less grave 
than that of the nuclear stockpiles. 
Brigadier-General J. H. Rothschild 
was head of the United States Chem- 
ical Corps until 1957. (The Chem- 
ical Corps is in charge of both chem- 
ical and biological weapons.) In a 
recent book, “Tomorrow's weapons”, 
Brigadier Rothschild says that the 
small quantities required make “bio- 
logicals™ the Quartermaster's dream; 
they can be used, says Rothschild, to 
attack “hundreds of thousands of 
square miles.” A cloud of the chosen 
agent can be released on to a favour- 
able wind; “a deep cloud several hun- 
dred miles across will be able to travel 
long distances and still be effective”. 
All the diseases which attack man 
are potential agents. The most suit- 
able are those with highest “infec- 
tivity" and “virulence”. Rothschild 
adds: “The microbes can be made 
more resistant to antibiotics, thereby

Health Organization.

rendering treatment of the diseases 
more difficult.” 
Another authority, Major-General 
Brock Chisholm of Canada (2), com- 
mented in 1957 on this development of 
biological weapons, which was then 
beginning: “Research Is at present 
going forward with a view to making 
the bacteria of more general diseases, 
e.g., cholera, typhus, etc., much more 
virulent, so that the vaccination, etc., 
now carried out might not serve as a 
protection to anyone who was infect- 
ed. This line of investigation is very 
dangerous to the future of mankind.”

There can no longer be any doubt 
that biologicals are potential weapons 
of mass destruction. The American 
Chemical Society estimates that a 
single large bomber, distributing only 
450 pounds of the selected agent, could 
spreadthe disease over 34,000 square 
miles; between 25 and 75 per cent of 
the population would become casual- 
ties, although not all would die. 
Expenditure on biological warfare 
research has greatly increased in 
recent years. 
There is another serious objection 
to the present rapid development of 
biological weapons. Once research 
has solved the technical problems of 
producing and stocking these wea- 
pons, and of delivering them against 
an enemy, their large-scale production 
is very cheap—the amount of an agent 
needed to attack a very large area is 
very small. Thus an enormous power 
of destruction might become available 
to many nations at an almost negli- 
gible cost. This danger will certainly 
confront the world within a measura- 
ble future, if the arms race goes on. 
Chemical weapons 
 
An American reporter, Mr. James 
Polk, has vividly described a nerve gas 
plant at Newport, Indiana. 
“The killer chemical which emerges 
from the plant's ovens and chilling 
chamber is nerve gas. A stealthy 
assassin, it is odourless, tasteless and 
virtually invisible. A drop, breathed 
or soaked into the skin, can be fatal. 
“At the end of this unique assembly 
line, laced with 40 miles of pipes, the 
nerve gas is poured into rockets, land 
mines and artillery shells—destination 
secret... The plant has now been 
in operation twenty-four hours a day 
for three years” (3).

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
The nerve gas “paralyses and kills 
by attacking the body's cholinesterase, 
a key substance in transmitting nerve 
signals for muscles to expand. When 
this fluid is crippled, muscles continue 
to constrict, and the body strangles its 
own vital organs”. 
A United States Army handbook says 
that this gas can cause “death within 
four minutes”, and that it is so potent 
that, delivered only on a small scale, 
its effect can approach that of nuclear 
weapons. “The gas is very cheap; 
the Newport plant costs only $3.5 mil- 
lion per year to run.” 
Brigadier Rothschild, in the book 
referred to above, confirms all 
Mr. Polk's assertions. The gases first 
discovered by Hitler's chemists, which 
they called Tabun and Sarin, Roths- 
child labels “GB”. He says that GB 
is thirty times as lethal as phosgene 
the most deadly of all the gases of the 
First World War. It can therefore be 
used in expensive rockets. In high 
concentrations, readily attainable in 
the field, it cannot be detected until 
the lethal dosage has been inhaled. 
Brigadier Rothschild also describes 
a class of less volatile anti-chol- 
inesterase agents which he labels 
“V-agents". He says: “These are very 
effective through the skin, because 
practically none evaporates. A tiny 
droplet, if not removed immediately, 
will be absorbed and cause death. 
Such a droplet on the skin might well 
go unnoticed, since the process of 
absorption is painless.” 
V-agents used in aerosols cause 
long-term hazards—drops which re- 
main on the ground, on trees, on build- 
ings, do not evaporate. 
The American Chemical Society on 
Civil Defence has calculated that one 
big bomber carrying a load of nerve 
gas could distribute the gas over “an 
immediate effective area” of 100 
square miles; the gas would cause 
casualties to 30 per cent of the popu- 
lation in the area; not all the casualties 
would necessarily be fatal. A group 
of five bombers could cover a large 
city. The United States, it says, has 
no effective present defence... ... 
The brief assortment of facts recited 
above may give a general impression 
of what the scientists have achieved 
in weapon development in the last 
twenty years. It gives no idea of what 
a war fought with these weapons would 
be like. 
No governments, and few scientists, 
have even attempted this task. Yet 
is it not essential that the peoples 
should understand what would happen, 
if the armaments for which they pay 
were ever used? It is certainly essen- 
tial that the reader of this article should 
have some picture in his mind, if he 
is to grasp its point. 
Two brief quotations may, therefore, 
be reproduced—quotations which des- 
cribe the probable effects of nuclear 
bombs. The first is a description, 
based on material in the British Home 
Office Manuals of Civil Defence, of   
what would happen if a 10-megaton 
bomb were burst over a central point 
in London. It was given to a con- 
ference of the World Federation of 
Mental Health in Paris in 1961: 
“One 10-megaton bomb, burst 
6,000 feet above Trafalgar Square, 
would wipe out London: its centre 
blasted to dust and rubble; a pillar of 
flame a mile high, twenty miles across; 
winds of hurricane force; gas mains, 
tanks, petrol stations all exploding; 
the air sucked from every shelter, re- 
placed by carbon monoxide; every 
escape route blocked with crashed 
vehicles and fallen buildings; every 
person in the open within forty miles 
blinded, their retinas burnt to nothing 
by the thermo-nuclear flash, 1,000 times 
brighter than the sun; the drivers of 
trains and cars and lorries, the pilots 
of aircraft, sightless, helpless, hurtling 
to their doom.” 
The second is an account by two 
eminent American scientists, Dr. Harri- 
son Brown and Dr. James Real, of 
what a similar bomb would do, if it 
were exploded above Los Angeles (in 
Community of Fear, 1960). They asked 
their compatriots to imagine that “the 
bomb hits during the working hours of 
a week-day”. 
“The blast effects would extermi- 
nate virtually all but the most deeply 
sheltered living things within a radius 
of five miles. Blast casualties would 
be severe up to ten miles. But the 
phenomenon that would complete the 
devastation of life in the entire area 
would be fire. The area would be one 
great sea of fire which would burn 
until there was nothing more to con- 
sume.

shrapnel onto and into everything in

ground gasoline and oil tanks would 
rupture and explode within the blast 
area, and a large proportion of the 
remainder within the firestorm radius 
would follow, each in its own particu- 
lar manner—pumps and pipes sheared, 
and finally higher and higher ambient 
temperatures, which would soon ex- 
pand, rupture and explode the remain- 
der.” 
The authors then describe how the 
remaining area of Los Angeles, “row 
upon row of cheap, flammable, com- 
mercial structures” would be burnt, 
and what would happen to the “bush- 
covered hills and scrub forest” on the 
city's borders. They say that “anyone 
unacquainted with the remarkable 
explosive nature of the oil-carrying 
grease-wood, sumac and scrub pine is 
surprised and frightened by the vola- 
tility of the material, even when it is 
wet. The novel aspect of a thermo- 
nuclear conflagration, however, is that 
most of these highly flammable mate- 
rials would break into intense flame 
simultaneously—a phenomenon never 
before achieved either by man or by 
natural causes”. 
Dr. Harrison Brown and Dr. James 
Real then say that, in their belief, in 
Los Angeles “at least a twenty-five 
mile radius (i.e., a circle fifty miles 
across)... would be, within minutes, 
engulfed in a suffocating firestorm that 
would persist for a long time”. No one, 
they think, would survive unless inside 
very deep shelters, with built-in oxy- 
gen supply and cooling system. Even 
so, the chance of reaching safety 
would be “slim”, after the firestorm. 
“A major problem would be trying 
to get through ankle-high to knee- 
high ash containing numerous hidden 
pitfalls; clambering for dozens of miles 
over huge smoking piles of radioactive 
rubble, burned out timber, wire and 
steel. If the survivor made it to the 
edge of the devastated area, he in all 
probability would have accumulated by 
that time a fatal dose of radiation which 
would shortly claim what was left of 
his life.” 
Radioactive fall-out 
The two quotations above deal with 
the effects of a single bomb delivered 
on a single city. But in a general war, 
in which the whole, or a large propor- 
tion of the nuclear stocks were used, 
radioactive fall-out would be by far 
the most potent cause of casualties. 
Dr. Ralph E. Lapp, who has the unique 
distinction of having been Nuclear 
Research Adviser to all three of the 
United States Defence Services, has 
calculated that if a 20-megaton bomb 
were burst in the air, so vast a quan- 
tity of radioactive bomb debris would 
fall back to earth that it would give a 
lethal dose of radiation to everyone in 
the open over an area perhaps as 
great as 5,000 square miles (1). 
If the United States and Soviet Go- 
vernments decided “to destroy each 
other's society” (this is the phrase in 
current use to explain “deterrence”) 
each of them, as said above, could 
launch an attack amounting to 20,000 
megatons or even more. A lethal 
mantle of fallout covering 5 million 
square miles would be genocide on a 
comprehensive scale; the wind would 
take an ample part to other nations 
perhaps neutral in the war.

the scientists engaged in military res- 
earch may appropriately be ended by

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
a quotation from one of the most emi- 
nent of them. Writing in October 
1964, Dr. Jerome Wiesner used the 
following words : “Both sides of the 
arms race are thus confronted by the 
dilemma of steadily increasing military 
power, and steadily decreasing mili- 
tary security . . . The clearly predict- 
able course of the arms race is a 
steady open spiral downwards into 
oblivion,” (1). 
There are some sclentists—and 
others—who still believe that disarma- 
ment Is a mirage. Dr. Edward Teller, 
frankly leaving science for politics, 
argued this at length in an article in 
1957 (2). He foresaw the arms race 
going on indefinitely for decades, with 
Western experts saving freedom by 
keeping ahead in armament technique. 
This is a conception of international 
relations which armament experts have 
always held—Dr. Teller was only giving 
it a modern look. 
To bolster up this view that national 
security depends on constantly in- 
creasing armaments, attempts have 
been made to show that the arms race 
has brought indirect, but great, advan- 
tages in the promotion of scientific 
knowledge, in the stimulation of indus- 
trial advance, and, in consequence, in 
general social well-being. These 
claims may be briefly reviewed, to 
see whether, in fact they constitute a 
valid off-set against the heavy cost 
and the grave dangers which the arms 
race involves. 
Advancing scientific 
knowledge ? 
The discovery of atomic energy is 
usually quoted as, in itself, conclusive 
proof that military research has paid 
a handsome dividend in greater scien- 
tific knowledge. 
No one would dispute that the re- 
lease of atomic energy—"a source of 
power which will enable man to build 
his life as he likes"—was accelerated, 
perhaps by many years, because 
Einstein and others perceived in 1939 
that it might produce the decisive 
weapon of the Second World War. 
But it might be argued that it would 
have been better for mankind if this 
great discovery had been delayed until 
the United Nations had built up a solid 
system for settling international dis- 
putes and until the governments had 
carried out a general agreement to 
disarm. No doubt the making of the 
first atomic bomb, with the vast resour- 
ces it involved, ushered in a cumulative 
advance of modern physics; but it is 
not yet certain that it has permanently 
advanced the cause of human pro- 
gress; that depends on decisions still 
to come. 
In any case, it has been suggested 
by Mr. Gerard Piel, an author who 
commands respect, that, since military 
research has now produced the “ulti- 
mate” weapons, its contribution to true 
science is at an end. 
Mr. Piel makes a distinction 
between science and technology. 
 
“Science”, he says, is concerned with 
the discovery of the unknown... The 
work of Science is to increase our 
understanding of the universe around 
us, and of the world that is within 
each of us.” Technology is “the 
exploitation of the already known”. lt 
must be clearly distinguished from 
“the discovery of the unknown”, which 
is science. 
Mr. Piel goes on: “Contemporary 
weaponeering is essentially a process 
of miniaturization, of packing more 
devastation into a smaller and more 
portable warhead . . . This is not 
Science. It is Technology of a high 
order, and it is exploiting whole reg- 
ions of knowledge only recently won 
from the unknown . . . But the fact 
remains that the immense research 
and development activity sponsored 
by the Pentagon will contribue nothing 
to human understanding, and can yield 
little else but an increase in the 
efficiency, flexibility and enormity of 
our destructive power.” 
HRCA CEEELEL 
a spur to 
industrial progress? 
  
Mr. Piel concludes that a fully mili- 
tarized world, while constantly advan- 
cing in technology, would be “a world 
without much science” (3). 
Some experts would, perhaps, dis- 
pute this view. But few would deny 
that, if the manpower and resources 
given to military research had been 
given to civil research instead, the 
resulting contribution to our “under- 
standing of the world around us and 
of the world within us” would have 
been much greater than it is (4). 
It is often said that military research 
has been the dynamo of progress in 
civil industry, and has thus contributed 
greatly to the material prosperity of 
mankind. Indeed, this assertion has 
been used as a major argument to 
justify the vast expenditure on military 
research. 
Again, no one would dispute that 
the sophisticated technological ad- 
vance of the armament industry has 
given results that are of benefit to 
civil industry as well. 
But the point is often over-stated. 
it was claimed not long ago that among 
the “better known" discoveries by 
which military research has helped 
civil industry were the following: “nu- 
clear power; the modern aircraft; high 
temperature alloys; and the modern 
automobile transmission”. A subsi- 
diary list of “less known" contributions 
included fire retardant paints, helicop- 
ters, anti-icing equipment, new plas- 
tics, and automatic electronic compu- 
ters. 
It is ridiculous to assert that all 
these inventions would not have been 
made if there had been no military 
research. The Wright brothers had 
constructed an aeroplane, the first 
heavier-than-air machine, Bleriot had 
flown the Channel, there had been a 
decade of important progress, before 
any War Department showed the 
slightest interest in aviation. 
This progress would have unques- 
tionably gone on if there had been no 
world wars and no military research. 
Indeed, it can be reasonably argued 
that, without war and preparation for 
war, more and earlier attention might 
have been given to the development 
of civil aircraft, and to the creation of 
a world system of passenger and 
postal transport. 
And if credit for progress in avia- 
tion is to be given to military research, 
there is something to be set on the 
other side of the balance sheet. Hun- 
dreds of thousands of airmen killed in 
battle, millions of civilians blasted or 
burnt to death by air bombardment, 
the destruction of great cities and of 
irreplaceable artistic and architectural 
treasures—these were the price paid 
for the more rapid progress in aviation, 
together with the vast economic cost 
of maintaining the national air forces 
in time of peace. 
In any case, the benefits which in- 
dustry has derived from military re- 
search constitute only a tiny proportion 
of the latter's output and they are an 
accidental, not an intentional, result. 
Its overwhelmingly preponderant effect 
is to increase the complexity, the cost, 
and the destructive power of arma- 
ments; to increase the capacity for 
surprise attack; and thus to multiply 
the dangers of the arms race and the 
risk that unprovoked aggression might 
succeed. 
Indeed, to say that military research 
is socially desirable because of the 
benefits it brings to civil industry is 
not only an economic absurdity; it is 
the exact contrary of the truth. Pro- 
fessor Seymour Melman and his col- 
leagues have shown that the vast con- 
centration of eminent scientists and 
technologists on armament work in the 
United States has starved American 
industry of the experts it needs, and 
has caused it to fall behind the stan- 
dards of modern equipment and indus- 
try of other countries (5).

### 15422: Science and disarmament

The Prime Minister of Britain made 
the same point in December 1964: 
“Defence is taking too big a share of 
our real resources in terms of foreign 
exchange, scarce types of manpower 
and load on the most advanced in- 
dustries... Defence uses one-fifth of 
all qualified scientists and technolo- 
gists who are engaged on research 
and development, and defence now 
accounts for about 40 9, of all re- 
search and development expenditure.” 
Social benefits ? 
Other contributions to human advan- 
ce which have been attributed to mili- 
tary research include “the following: 
yellow-fever eradication; chlorination 
of water; blood-plasm substitutes; 
advanced weather prediction tech- 
niques 
It is enough to ask two questions. 
If the resources in money and expert 
knowledge devoted to biological wea- 
pons had been given instead to inter- 
national research for the eradication 
of disease, might not far greater medi- 
cal results have been obtained? 
If the resources in money, equip- 
ment and scientific genius given to 
nuclear weapons had been used ins- 
tead for research into what causes the 
weather, and for computers to turn the 
increased knowledge into reliable fore- 
casts, might not a much advanced 
meteorology have made a large addi- 
tion to mankind's annual! income of 
food and other usable wealth? 
The conclusion of this section of the 
argument is plain. There are some 
scientific, industrial, and social bene- 
fits from military research but they 
constitute a minimal off-set against the 
waste and dangers of the arms race. 
if the scientists and technicians engag- 
ed on this work could be diverted from 
“improving” armaments to peaceful 
industrial, agricultural and medical re- 
search, and if they were given the 
same equipment and resources that 
they have today, their achievements 
might quite quickly revolutionize man's 
individual and social life. 
 
Science 
and 
Conscience 
The scientists have made the mod- 
ern weapons; for a hundred years, 
scientists have contributed to every 
development in armament technique. 
With what motives have they done 
so? Do they carry any special res- 
ponsibility not shared by their fellow 
citizens? 
Some of the men who have made 
important new contributions to arma- 
  
ment technique did so, no doubt, in 
the hope of making money. Some 
who made money—Alfred Nobel, for 
example—believed that their inventions 
would help to abolish war. Nobel 
wrote to his friend, the Baroness von 
Suttner: “My factories may well put 
an end to war sooner than your con- 
gresses. The day when two army 
corps can annihilate one another in 
one second, all civilized nations, it is 
to be hoped, will recoil from war and 
discharge their troops » (1). 
Haber suggested the use of poison 
gas to the German General Staff in 
1915. He was the winner of a Nobel 
Prize for Chemistry, he knew that poi- 
son gas would violate the accepted 
law of war; but he had spent the win- 
ter of 1914-15 as a private in the 
trenches and he foresaw the long 
years of strategic stalemate and of 
senseless slaughter which would 
come, unless some new weapon could 
break the stalemate and bring hos- 
tilities to an end. 
Einstein, Szilard, Peierls and Rotblat 
all detested war; they knew the im- 
mense perils which nuclear weapons 
would involve; but they thought the 
greatest danger was that Hitler should 
get nuclear weapons first. That was 
what made them persuade President 
Roosevelt to authorize the Manhattan 
District Project; that was what inspired 
their colleagues in the Project team to 
the stupendous efforts which they 
made. This could, no doubt, be 
regarded as only a special case of the 
general compulsion of the arms race; 
but it was a case in which men pre- 
eminently endowed with social cons- 
cience acted from the highest motives, 
in the interest of humanity as a whole. 
The same could certainly be said of 
Sir Robert Watson-Watt, who brought 
the priceless gift of radar to the Royal 
Air Force to help it meet the threat 
of Goering’'s bombers. And it could 
certainly also be said of many lesser 
scientists, who have volunteered their 
contribution to the military defence of 
causes in which they ardently believed. 
But, no doubt, for the great majority 
of the men who have worked in mili- 
tary research in various countries, no 
such special motive was required. 
Their governments invited them to enter 
this branch of its service, precisely as 
it invited (or compelled) other men to 
join the fighting forces. They accept- 
ed the invitation, or obeyed the order, 
with the same sense of patriotic duty 
which all good citizens should feel. 
Do the scientists engaged in 
military research carry a special 
responsibility for the present dan- 
gerous arms race—a responsibility 
which their fellow-citizens do not 
share? 
The following propositions will 
probably command fairly general 
assent: 
  
(1) Quoted In August Schou, The Nobel 
Peace Prize. 
  
1. No citizen of a democratic coun- 
try can escape a share of respon- 
sibility for what his government 
does in matters of national defence. 
If he pays his taxes, he is financing 
the work on weapons which the 
scientists complete. 
2. It is open to a scientist to refuse 
to work in military research—one 
example being that of Professor 
Otto Hahn, who first split the uran- 
"ium atom in 1939, when he led 
eighteen foremost German physi- 
cists in 1957 in declaring that they 
would “never take part in any way 
in the production, testing, or use 
of atomic weapons”. This is equi- 
valent to the stand of the conscien- 
tious objector, who declares that 
he will play no part in war. It is 
worthy of all respect. But to most 
scientists it will not seem an 
acceptable way out of the dilemma 
with which the arms race now 
confronts them. 
The responsibility 
of the 
scientists 
3. If a scientist accepts employment 
in his government's military re- 
search, and if he feels, as he 
normally will, that his nation’s 
security depends on his work in 
keeping the national forces ade- 
quately equipped with modern 
weapons, then it is his duty to 
make the utmost efforts to improve 
those weapons, and to keep his 
national forces up to the highest 
standards of fighting power achiev- 
ed by other nations. 
4. In carrying out his share in mili- 
tary research, the scientist is nor- 
mally under orders from generals 
and ministers. If there is quilt in 
making the modern means of war, 
it lies primarily on the shoulders of 
the ministers who make the politi- 
cal decisions that these means of 
war shall be produced, and on the 
parliaments who pay. If the scien- 
tists were simply under orders, like 
other civil servants, this would be 
the main answer to the questions 
now being discussed. 
5. But in reality the scientists 
engaged in military research are 
not simply under orders; they are 
not simply civil servants with no 
direct responsibility for what is

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
done. On the contrary, they know 
so much more about modern wea- 
pons, and about the possibility of 
further “improving” them, than the 
generals or the politicians can 
possibly know, that they inevitably 
play a large part in the process 
of decision-making. 
Of all the new departures in 
United States nuclear weapons 
policy since 1945, all but one were 
initially conceived and put forward 
by scientists: the Oppenheimer- 
Baruch plan for nuclear disarma- 
ment; the “fusion” or hydrogen 
bomb; the development of so-cali- 
ed “tactical” or “battlefield” nuc- 
lear weapons; the ballistic missile 
for the delivery of nuclear war- 
heads; and the ban on nuclear 
tests. The only exception was the 
doctrine of massive retaliation, 
which was the brain-child of John 
Foster Dulles. 
In so far as scientists are effec- 
tive participants in decision-making 
about weapons, they share the kind 
of responsibility borne by generals 
and ministers; and in view of their 
greater knowledge, their true share 
of responsibility for what is done 
may be greater than the share of 
their military or political chiefs. 
6. This special knowledge and 
influence of the scientists lays on 
them a special duty which they 
cannot escape. This is the duty 
to explain to their General Staffs, 
to their ministers, and to all their 
fellow citizens the real destructive 
power of the new weapons which 
they have devised, introduced and 
perfected. This means, in plain 
language, that they should do what- 
ever is needed to warn their own 
nations and the world of the grave 
dangers of the present arms race. 
7. But this special duty does not 
end with explaining the nature of 
the modern armaments, and the 
danger of their accidental or un- 
intended use. it must also include 
an obligation to help devise the 
technical clauses of a disarmament 
treaty by which the arms race can 
be ended and to join in the educa- 
tional effort needed to create the 
public opinion by which the policy 
of disarmament can be made to 
triumph. This is a duty which lies 
inescapably on those scientists 
who are engaged, or who have 
been engaged, in military research. 
8. As pointed out in paragraph 
4 above, the scientists share re- 
sponsibility for the making of the 
modern weapons with the generals 
and the ministers under whose 
orders they serve. It follows that 
the duty described in paragraphs 
6 and 7 lies also on the generals 
and ministers, and that the pro- 
gramme of action described in later 
sections of this article should be 
undertaken by them all. 
In principle, it is impossible to 
dispute this proposition. But today 
it is necessary to recognize 
the facts of international life. 
Twenty years after the second 
“war to end war”, the generals as 
a class have shown small belief 
that war and armaments can be 
abolished; they regard it, rather, as 
their duty to explain the difficulties 
and dangers of disarmament; so 
far, very few of them have made 
constructive proposals for ending 
the arms race. 
The ministers have been willing, 
year after year, to accept resolu- 
tions in the General Assembly of 
the United Nations declaring that 
disarmament is the most important 
objective of their foreign policy. 
But they have failed to give their 
delegates the instructions which 
would enable them to negotiate a 
disarmament treaty. 
FAV F-TIoE3 « 
the complicity 
of silence 
  
There is no point in arguing 
which nations have been most to 
blame. The fact is that the minis- 
ters will only feel able to take 
grave decisions which disarmament 
requires when there is an over- 
whelming body of public opinion 
throughout the world on which 
they can rely to give them support. 
9. Only the scientists can create 
this body of opinion. They can 
speak with an authority which the 
ordinary citizen, the non-scientist, 
cannot challenge, and to which he 
is compelled to listen. Since they 
cannot hope for much help from 
the generals or the ministers, they 
must act by themselves, in a 
supreme endeavour to avert the 
mortal dangers which confront 
mankind. 
How far do the propositions set 
forth in the previous section apply 
to scientists who are not engaged, and 
who have never been engaged, in 
military research? 
At first sight, it might seem that the 
responsibility and duty of these 
scientists is less than that of scientists 
who are so engaged. Their respon- 
sibility for the arms race is less; their 
knowledge of the weapons and their 
influence on government decisions are 
less. 
But three further propositions will 
not be disputed. 
BM Many scientists outside govern- 
ment service have contributed to 
the general body of knowledge on 
which military research has drawn 
in its work on weapons. A vast 
army of physicists built up the 
knowledge of nuclear energy from 
which the making of fission and 
fusion weapons resulted. Many of 
them made contributions of new 
knowledge without which the wea- 
pons could not have been made, 
even when they had no idea that 
they were helping to create a new 
and more dangerous kind of arms 
race. 
HM In so far as they understand the 
weapons, and the dangers to which 
the weapons give rise, better than 
non-scientists, they have a duty 
to help in the task described above. 
BM By reason of their greater 
knowledge, they will have more 
influence on public opinion than 
non-scientists. For example, phy- 
sicists, whether engaged in military 
research or not, can explain the 
dangers of the nuclear arms race 
better than non-scientists; and 
they will carry greater weight with 
the average citizen. The same is 
true of medical practitioners and 
biological weapons; and of chem- 
ists and poison gases and incen- 
diary weapons. 
In short, no one with a specialized 
scientific training can escape a moral 
obligation to share in this essential 
work of education. And those who are 
not in government employ have full 
freedom to speak their minds; govern- 
ment scientists may be bound to 
silence by the terms on which they 
are engaged. . 
The scientists have a large share of 
responsibility for another development 
of sinister significance: the use—or 
misuse—of language to obscure the 
realities of the present arms race and 
of nuclear war. 
Sir Solly Zuckerman, for long the 
Chief Scientific Adviser to the British 
Ministry of Defence, and, since 19686, 
Chief Scientific Adviser to the British 
Government, has given a strong warn- 
ing about the danger which this 
involves. Writing in 1962 in the United 
States journal Foreign Affairs, he 
spoke of “the way the military have 
altered the concrete nature of certain 
military problems by turning them into 
abstractions. One dangerous example 
of this tendency is the term “in- 
terdiction targets”. Another is the idea 
that nuclear weapons are just a new 
and more powerful form of artillery,

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
and that one exchanges nuclear-fire 
like counter-battery fire. A third is 
that one is able “to restore a situa- 
tion” with nuclear fire". 
Sir Solly went on to explain that the 
destruction by nuclear weapons of 
“interdiction targets™—bridges rail 
way Junctions, mobilization depots 
and so on—would Inevitably mean 
the destruction of towns and a large- 
scale attack on civilian targets; that 
the “exchange of nuclear-fire” would 
not simply mean the obliteration of 
the enemy's guns or launching sites, 
but the devastation of a large area 
of territory; that an adverse battlefield 
situation could not be “restored” by 
nuclear weapons as it might be by 
artillery bombardment—the nuclear 
weapons would only add to the military 
chaos, and would, by fall-out, be a 
grave danger to troops using them (1). 
Kilotons and Megatons 
 
These were Illustrations of the 
general propositions which Sir Solly 
stated thus: “We must avoid the 
conceptual framework derived from the 
military’ terminology of pre-nuclear 
warfare. One may fairly ask what 
meaning there is to the idea of using 
nuclear weapons ‘to defend our 
territories and peoples’. One can 
deter with nuclear weapons. Can one 
defend?” (2). 
Sir Solly was discussing the misuse 
in the nuclear age of previously 
accepted, and valid, strategic terms. 
But there Is also a large body of 
newly-invented jargon; a whole 
vocabulary of phrases, unintelligible 
to anyone but the expert, for describ- 
ing the nuclear weapons, the various 
kinds of attack for which they might 
be used, and the “responses” {coun- 
ter-attacks) which might most advan- 
tageously be made. 
One part of this jargon is mathe- 
matical and, no doubt, necessary, both 
for the scientists and the General 
Staffs. To express the explosive 
power of a nuclear weapon, it is 
described as either in the “kiloton” 
or the “megaton” class. 
A kiloton is the equivalent of 1,000 
tons of TNT; a megaton is the equi- 
valent of 1 million tons of TNT. The 
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was 
approximately 20 kilotons; the first H 
bomb exploded at Bikini in March 
1954 was 15 megatons; in September 
1961, the U.S5.S5.R. exploded a bomb 
of about 60 megatons. If this bomb 
had had an outer sheath of uranium- 
238 instead of lead its power might 
have exceeded 100 megatons. 
These terms “kiloton” and “mega- 
ton” obscure from the ordinary citizen 
the great destructive potential of the 
weapons. A half-kiloton weapon 
sounds like something very small; in 
fact it has the explosive power of 600 
to 700 twelve-inch shells with a charge 
  
of TNT. One twelve-inch shell was 
considered a very formidable weapon 
in the First World War. 
The effect of a megaton weapon can 
best be understood by remembering 
that all the Allies succeeded in drop- 
ping only 1.2 million tons of bombs 
with chemical explosives on German 
territory during six years of the Second 
World War. In doing so, they ruined 
most of the German cities, and they 
destroyed a great part of German 
industry, oil stocks and oil production, 
and almost all the German railway 
system. The smallest megaton weapon 
has the same explosive power. 
There is another insidious danger 
in these mathematical terms, especially 
when they are used in “the conceptual 
framework derived from the military 
terminology of pre-war nuclear war- 
fare”. A United States scientist, 
Dr. Donald Brennan, has expressed it 
thus: "Even among professionals, | 
have observed an occasional tendency 
to think of kilotons as tons.” (3) 
The new military 
JET Lela 
a dangerous 
eTde Me F-11001 
“Professionals” —Il.e., soldiers sail- 
ors and airmen trained with conven- 
tional weapons and experienced in 
conventional military operations—come 
to think of the new weapons as similar 
to those which they employed in the 
two World Wars. This is a singularly 
perilous aberration, which disguises 
the real nature of operations from 
those who plan them. 
But, in spite of these dangers, the 
use of these mathematical terms is 
not only useful, but also necessary, as 
noted above, both for scientists and 
General Staffs. They cannot write out 
“the equivalent of thousands (millions) 
of tons of TNT" thousands of times, 
to explain their meaning. 
The problem is to ensure that all 
who use the terms, including military 
“professionals”, journalists, commen- 
tators and the general public, really 
grasp the significance of the terms; 
that they really come to understand 
that kiloton weapons are at least a 
thousand times as powerful as the 
shells and bombs used in the Second 
World War, and may be up to 50,000 
times as powerful; while even the 
smallest of megaton weapons is at 
[east a million times as powerful as

the twelve-inch shell, and the largest 
so far made, 60 million times. 
There are other parts of this new 
“strategic” jargon for which there is 
less intellectual excuse. The weapon 
which destroyed Hiroshima was called 
the “nominal” bomb. Perhaps the 
word “nominal” was convenient. At 
least it evoked no unpleasant 
memories; perhaps this was not its 
greatest merit to those who used it 
first. For when “experts” and poli- 
ticians want to make the uninitiated 
appreciate the power of a nuclear 
device, they abandon the word “nomi- 
nal”, and speak of “Hiroshima”. 
Seeking to persuade the House of 
Commons of the great strength of the 
proposed British “independent” 
nuclear deterrent, Sir Alec Douglas- 
Home said that the eighty Polaris 
missiles in the five United Kingdom 
nuclear-powered submarines “will 
have a strikeload of 2,500 or 3,000 
Hiroshima bombs". 
“Hiroshima” evokes, “nominal” 
disguises, the reality of what the 
bombs would mean. The same is true 
when a 2-megaton warhead, which, as 
already mentioned, is nearly double 
the explosive power of all the bombs 
dropped on Germany in six years of 
war, is called a “low-yield thermo- 
nuclear device”. 
Some of the new jargon passed 
into journalistic, and indeed, into 
general, use. The commonest and the 
most misleading of the euphemistic 
phrases which are employed is the 
word “tactical” applied to the smaller 
types of nuclear weapons. 
Euphemistic phrases 
 
No one thought that the Hiroshima 
bomb was tactical in 1945. It had 
caused casualties many times as great 
as the total strength of the British 
Army of the Rhine. It was a substitute 
for, and had averted, an Allied cam- 
paign against Japan, to which several 
million troops had been assigned, 
and which was expected to last for 
18 months. It caused the enemy's 
immediate and unconditional surrender. 
The United States Lilienthal Com- 
mittee, which drew up the first draft 
of the Baruch-Oppenheimer Plan, 
writing in their report in March 1946 
while the impact of the first bombs 
was still quite fresh, spoke of: “The 
really revolutionary character of these 
(atomic) weapons, particularly as 
weapons of strategic bombardment 
aimed at the destruction of cities and 
the eradication of their populations.” 
This view of A-bombs was univers- 
ally accepted until the first H-bomb 
.was exploded in 1954. Only then did 
General Staffs begin to say that A- 
bombs were “tactical”. They called 
them “tactical” because something 
bigger and more devastating had been 
devised. Having these bigger weapons,

## [Page 21](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/014255engo.pdf#page=21) 0

### 15422: Science and disarmament

the Staffs, by an almost subconscious 
process of thought, began to make 
plans for war in which A-bombs were 
regarded as artillery. Marshal of the 
Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor, in 
Strategy for the West, spoke for many 
of the experts when he said: “We may 
use nuclear power in a bomb or shell 
tactically for conventional purposes. 
That is merely to employ one projectile 
to do what we had to use thousands 
to do in Korea”. 
This was written with the most 
honest intent. But in fact, no nuclear 
weapon, not even the half-kiloton 
bazooka-launched infantry bomb, the 
Davy Crockett, bears any relation to 
what artillery used to do. It is entirely 
different in kind. And, of course, only 
a very small proportion of the so-called 
“tactical” or “battlefield” weapons 
have as low a yield of explosive power 
as the Davy Crockett. The vast major- 
ity have a yield as large as the 
Hiroshima bomb; and very many are 
more powerful still. 
In the summer of 1964, Mr. McNa- 
mara, the United States Secretary of 
Defence, said the average yield of the 
different weapons classed as “tactical” 
was 100 kilotons, i.e, five times as 
powerful as the Hiroshima bomb. It 
is evident that, by all hitherto accepted 
canons of military literature, such 
weapons are what the Lilienthal 
Committee called them—"“weapons of 
strategic bombardment”, and that they 
are capable of the “destruction of 
enemy cities and the eradication of 
their populations”. 
‘Megadeath’ 
‘megacorpse’ 
and other 
abhorrent phrases 
  
The use of the word “tactical” to 
describe them has done more than all 
the rest of the jargon put together to 
distort the thinking of the “experts” 
about the use of nuclear arms, and to 
lead the general public to accept what 
in 1945-46 almost everyone agreed 
was utterly unacceptable. 
But there are other dangerous 
words. When missiles with hydrogen 
warheads became operational, the 
General Staffs based their plans on 
the assumption that these more power- 
ful weapons would be used for the 
“destruction of enemy cities and the 
eradication of their populations”, 
But the eradication of civilian popul- 
ations was an unpleasant thought. It 
was less distasteful to plan for the 
elimination of “military” targets. The 
phrase “counter-force strategy” was 
invented to describe the policy of 
making the first major, strategic 
nuclear onslaught against these milit- 
ary  targets—Staff headquarters ; 
manpower depots; airfields; missile 
sites; naval, especially submarine, 
bases and dockyards; munitions 
factories; “interdiction targets”, such 
as major bridges, railway junctions 
and marshalling yard, road transport 
centres and the rest. 
Of course, many of these military 
targets are situated in, or near, towns 
and cities; they could not be attacked 
with megaton weapons (and a strate- 
gic onslaught would mean that) or 
even with multikiloton weapons, with- 
out killing a great number of civilians 
as well. But it sounds more civilized, 
more in accordance with Grotian Inter- 
national Law, to speak of attacking 
military targets first; “counter-force 
strategy” has soothing overtones. 
The alternative to “counter-force 
strategy” is “counter-value strategy”. 
“Counter-value” means directing the 
first strategic nuclear attack not on 
the military targets but on centres of 
population and industry. The delibe-~ 
rate purpose of this attack would be to 
wipe out the enemy's towns and cities, 
exterminate his civilian population, and 
destroy his industrial production. 
Blanketing the facts 
  
 
There are human beings who advo- 
cate the adoption of a “counter-value 
strategy”; they believe that to announ- 
ce the adoption of a “counter-force” 
policy must weaken the strength of the 
deterrent. Fortunately their numbers 
are few; but the invention of the phrase 
(‘counter-value’) to describe the mur- 
der of a nation will rank with historians 
of the future as a classic example .- 
of the militarist thinking of 1965. 
So will the parallel phrase, “bonus 
kills". In strategic planning, it appe- 
ars, it is convenient to calculate only 
the casualties that will be immediately 
caused by the flash, blast and fire 
effects of a given kilotonnage or meg- 
atonnage of nuclear bombs. It is on 
this basis that the plans for an ope- 
ration are drawn up, the weapons 
allocated, and so on. If, in addition 
to these primary casualties, other 
people die as a result of fall-out, they 
are referred to as “bonus kills" (1). 
There are other jargon phrases, just 
as abhorrent on moral and intellectual 
grounds: “megadeath™, to mean the 
death of a million people; “mega- 
corpse”, to mean a million dead 
bodies; “overkill”, to express the 
power to destroy the entire population 
of an enemy country more than once. 
Whatever its technical advantages, 
there are dangers of various kinds 
inherent in the use of this euphemistic 
jargon. Others besides Dr. Brennan's 
“professionals” think they are speak- 
ing of tons when they speak of kilo- 
tons; the error is common among 
journalists, amateur strategists, and 
the general public. In 1964, it led 
a candidate in the United States pre- 
sidential election to speak of tactical 
nuclear weapons as “the successors 
of yesterday's conventional arms” (2); 
he urged that officers in the field 
be given authority to order their use. 
Let no one think that this is a small 
matter, or that the sinister importance 
of euphemism has been over-stated. 
The constant repetition of disingenu- 
ous phrases like those cited above 
has led to a kind of self-induced 
hypnosis among those who ought to 
understand the dangers of the mod- 
ern arms race and particularly among 
the politicians; while for the general 
public it has simply blanketed the 
facts. The scientists engaged in mili- 
tary research must carry their full share 
of the blame for this result. 
The first efforts 
VARY 01 413 
to warn 
the world 
The scientists who asked President 
Roosevelt to authorize the effort to 
make a nuclear bomb did so with 
heavy hearts. Those who served in 
the international team of the Manhattan 
District Project shared their doubts 
and fears. Dr. Arthur Compton has 
described how they “prayed that they 
might not succeed”. 
When in 1944 it became evident that 
their prayers would be in vain, and 
that the age of nuclear fission was 
dawning, the most eminent among 
them, Niels Bohr of Denmark, wrote a 
memorandum for President Roosevelt, 
warning him of the immense dangers 
to mankind that nuclear weapons 
would mean. 
“Unless some agreement about the 
control of the use of the new active 
materials can be obtained in due time, 
any temporary advantage, however 
great, may be outweighed by a per- 
petual menace to human society... No 
kind of customary measures will suf- 
fice for this purpose (the control of 
atomic energy). The terrifying pros- 
pect of a future competition between 
nations about a weapon of such for- 
midable character can only be avoided 
through a universal agreement in true 
confidence.” 
Already Niels Bohr foresaw the 
perils that were being unleashed; he 
foresaw that the necessary internation- 
al agreement must be universal and 
that it must breed true confidence. 
His anxiety was shared by many of 
his colleagues. In the same year, 
1944, in the so-called Frank Report,

THE CHALLENGE 
  
Ey in June 1967, as

of journalists held in Strasbourg, we 
tried to forget the outside world and 
spent an agreeable week discussing 
the recent progress of technology and 
its growing impact on ‘the press. 
In our small way, we tried to make 
a contribution to that increasingly 
popular exercise which has been

times skims fairly close to Science

Any family could select any of the

“talking newspapers” which added a

went so far as to work out how long 
it would take for such innovations to 
be introduced, whether in the next 
twenty, fifty or a hundred years. 
By tacit agreement we omitted any

based on what seemed a natural 
assumption that the world would 
develop peacefully in the foreseeable 
future. 
Clearly no one—except a compara- 
tively small group of professional 
military men—can think of drawing up 
vast plans for the future with the 
perspective of a world war in front of 
him. The architect breaking ground

peace is as natural to man as his need

In the course of the Second World 
War, 60 per cent of the national rev-

THE CHALLENGE OF PEACE (Continued) 
The rocky road 
to international agreements 
it would hardly seem necessary 
today to describe once again the 
horrible consequences of a new world 
war, a war fought with nuclear wea- 
pons. The destruction involved 
would go far beyond what any of us 
could possibly imagine. The world’s 
press has on various occasions quoted 
a figure which is in no sense an 
exaggeration : the death of 700 to 800 
million people as a result of the first 
nuclear attack. 
H— therefore, neither 
common sense nor the spirit of huma- 
nity give mankind any other choice 
today than the establishment of a last- 
ing peace. Yet it is a secret to no one 
that we live in a world of unstable, 
uneasy peace. Time and again we have 
seen the flames of war erupt in Korea, 
Algeria, Suez, Vietnam and the Middle 
East... As dangerous for peace today 
is the present tendency of the majority 
of nations to stockpile armaments, 
Professor George Schwartzenberger, 
of London University, was certainly 
right when he said that present-day 
relations between nations are permeat- 
ed with mutual distrust and constant 
fear of other nations’ intentions. 
It would therefore appear quite 
logical that nations seek to perfect the 
means for their own defence. But 
there does not seem to be any formula 
for doing away with the “world in arms” 
and the suspicions which derive from 
it, other than the elimination of the 
material basis of this fear and distrust, 
that is, the armaments themselves. 
It is only since the end of the 19th 
Century and in the brief interludes 
between wars in our own time that 
world political thought has been led to 
consider seriously the theory of gene- 
ral disarmament. In the past, disar- 
mament was applied to a country after 
it met defeat; it had to surrender its 
arms, its fortifications were destroyed 
and other measures of a similar nature 
were taken. Bitter experience has 
taught us that far from preventing new 
wars and conquests this increased the 
danger of war. 
That is why, during the Second 
World War with its untold destruction 
and millions of victims, people every- 
where were made acutely aware of the 
urgency of establishing a lasting peace 
based on the one means of definitely 
guaranteeing it, namely, disarmament. 
Even before the war had actually 
ended, Moscow, London, Washington 
and Paris were already seeking ways 
to build the peace of the future. 
In October 1943 a meeting of the 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 
Four Allied Powers was held in 
Moscow. In the declaration they 
jointly signed it was emphasized that 
the problem of disarmament should be 
resolved in the same spirit of unity 
which had been displayed by the 
Great Powers of the Anti-Nazi coali- 
tion. 
The approach to the problem of 
disarmament at that time was perhaps 
somewhat naive : the soldiers would 
return home after victory and would 
abandon their rifles and uniforms 
forever ; at the same time production 
of guns, tanks and bombers would be 
stopped. 
The appearance of a new type of 
weapon and its production by one of 
the Powers changed the situation. 
Disarmament became even more vital 
than before, but the solution to the 
problem became even more difficult. 
At the first session of the United 
Nations General Assembly in 1946, 
the U.S.S.R. proposed a “draft inter- 
national convention to prohibit the 
production and employment of wea- 
pons based on the use of atomic 
energy for the purpose of mass 
destruction.” This plan called for the 
destruction within three months of all 
atomic weapons and, what is often 
forgotten nowadays, the setting up of 
an international contro! body with very 
wide powers. This body would have 
had access to atomic installations in 
all countries and made sure that no 
state infringed the convention. 
H. this project been 
adopted, the atomic bombs in the pos- 
session of the United States would 
have been destroyed, and neither the 
U.S.S.R. nor Great Britain, nor France 
nor any other nation would have been 
able to produce their own Atomic and 
Hydrogen weapons. The problem of 
disarmament would have resumed its 
“pre-nuclear” aspect and might have 
been easier to resolve. 
At the time, however, it was argued 
that the Soviet Union was seeking to 
destroy weapons it did not possess 
and thus obtain a military and strategic 
advantage. In view of the ideas 
prevailing at that time, this attitude 
could well be justified. But had it 
been possible in 1946 to foresee the 
situation twenty years later, this 
argument might well have lost its full 
force and appeared politically short- 
sighted. 
Scientific and technical progress is 
governed by its own laws which are 
often independent of politics. Even 
in the days when Leonardo da Vinci 
was designing his flying machines, 
men vaguely foresaw the possibility of 
rockets and supersonic planes. Had 
the great atomic physicists and mathe- 
maticians whose names are now fami- . 
liar to everyone (with a timelag of 10 to 
20 years) never been born, there can 
be no doubt that other scientists would 
soon have discovered atomic energy 
along with its immense potentialities 
for destruction as well as for peace. 
The spread of nuclear energy and 
weapons to other countries was thus, 
obviously, only a question of time. 
T. question of the control 
of nuclear weapons has certainly been 
the big stumbling block of all discus- 
sions on disarmament. There was 
once a time when heated debates 
occurred over the question “which 
came first the chicken or the egg?” 
In our present age we have seen 
endless discussions on whether con- 
trol should precede disarmament or 
disarmament precede control. It must 
be obvious, however, that the only 
rational formula must be : “No disar- 
mament without control, and no control 
without disarmament.” In theory every- 
one is in agreement on this, both in 
the United States and the Soviet 
Union ; but in practice..... 
In practice the means of war and 
destruction continue to be stockpiled 
and perfected. For this reason it is 
more important than ever to do 
everything possible to facilitate a 
detente in international relations, and 
to prepare the ground for eventual 
total disarmament by an effort to limit 
the present arms race. 
The first successful attempts in this 
direction was made in 1963 when the 
Powers signatory to the Moscow 
Treaty agreed to ban nuclear weapon 
tests in the atmosphere, in outer space 
and under water. Agreement came 
following a whole series of discus- 
sions, all of which centered on the 
major issue of control. 
Today, more than four years after

The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed in Moscow on August 5, 1963 prohibited 
nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. 
France and Mainland China, who were not signatories, have since carried out 
nuclear tests in the atmosphere. Top, scientist examines a radiogram which 
reveals extent of radioactive pollution in the atmosphere. Tests have shown 
that contamination by fall-out particles decreased considerably after the signing 
of the Moscow Treaty. Above left, dots and spots on a radiogram made 
in the autumn of 1962 indicate density of radioactive particles in the air. 
Above right, a 1965 radiogram has only four spots (circled), 
the agreement was concluded, the 
sceptics and Doubting Thomases have 
been proved wrong. National detec- 
tion devices have shown their complete 
effectiveness in assuring reciprocal 
control. 
On December 19, 1966 the General 
Assembly of the United Nations 
unanimously adopted a historic treaty 
on principles governing the activities 
of States in the exploration and use of 
outer space including the Moon and 
other celestial bodies. The treaty 
specifically bans the orbiting in space 
of “any objects carrying nuclear 
weapons or any other kinds of wea- 
pons of mass destruction.” This 
“demilitarization of outer space” treaty 
was simultaneously signed in London, 
Moscow and Washington on January 
27, 1967. | was privileged to be 
present at the signing of this impor- 
tant document in Moscow which took 
place in the same building where the 
Moscow Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was 
signed in 1963. 
We should not forget however that 
as early as 1959 the Antarctic Treaty 
(signed by 12 countries operating in 
the southern continent) guaranteed 
that Antarctica “shall continue forever 
to be used exclusively for peaceful 
purposes and shall not become the 
scene or object of international 
discord.” The treaty prohibits the 
establishment of military bases, military 
manceuvres and the testing of any type 
of weapons, and bans nuclear explo- 
sions or the disposal of atomic waste 
in the Antarctic. The demilitarization 
of Antarctica has assured the constant 
friendly co-operation of scientific bases 
and expeditions at work there. 
| feel that these steps, limited 
though they may appear to some, give 
us cause for optimism and are an 
incentive for further steps in the same 
direction. Thus, the time may well 
be ripe now to convene a world confer- 
ence in which every nation possessing 
nuclear weapons would pledge itself 
not to be the first to make use of such 
weapons. Then too, apart from 
Antarctica there are many parts of the 
world where denuclearized zones 
could be established. Plans have 
already been put forward for the 
denuclearization of Scandinavia, the 
Balkans, Africa, Central Europe as 
well as other areas. 
There are also various proposals 
(including one from the U.S.S.R.) for 
the reduction of all military budgets by 
10 to 15 per cent, or by any other 
agreed amount, although events in 
South-East Asia and the Middle East 
have made it extremely difficult to 
carry such projects out. 
The prohibition of underground 
nuclear explosions, however, now 
appears closer to a solution. Two 
years ago, at the 18-nation Geneva 
disarmament talks, several non-com- 
mitted countries put forward a compro- 
mise plan calling for a ban on high- 
powered underground explosions and 
a moratorium on all other underground 
explosions, pending the conclusion of 
a general agreement on the question. 
This proposal does not correspond 
fully to the Soviet position but it has 
been accepted by the U.S.SRR. as a 
palliative to give the discussion a new 
start.

THE CHALLENGE OF PEACE (Continued) 


### 16045: The Challenge of peace

The arms race, 
the gravest issue of our time 
prospect of averting great war by 
mutual deterrence is a reasonably 
good prospect.” i 
Unfortunately, military conflicts have 
their own laws, or rather, they do not 
obey the laws of common sense. The 
events of last June in the Middle East 
are proof that recourse to arms 
between states or groups of states is 
neither impossible nor infrequent. 
Can we really therefore be sure that 
if armed conflicts occurred between 
“small” nations possessing nuclear 
weapons that the deterrent factor 
would hold true and that these nations 
would not make use of every weapon 
in their arsenal ? 
| am more inclined to agree with 
another American Journalist, John 
Gunther, when he says that in the 
event that all countries gained posses- 
sion of atomic weapons even the 
smallest country could spark off a 
world conflagration, 
Foe a tiny country with a 
per capita revenue from 22 to 25 times 
smaller than that of the United States 
may soon be in a position, | believe, 
to produce atomic weapons. Today 
some 10 to 15 countries possess 
nuclear reactors destined for peaceful 
purposes. But technical advances 
and the dissemination of scientific data 
are such that, with the reduction in the 
cost of producing nuclear arms, soon 
there will be not just 10 to 15 countries 
but 50 or more potentially capable of 
undertaking the manufacture of wea- 
pons of mass destruction. 
For these reasons the conclusion of 
an agreement on the non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons seems to me 
particularly urgent. Most people are 
familiar with the arguments for and 
against this question. They have 
been voiced repeatedly at the Geneva 
disarmament meetings, in diplomatic 
circles and in the world press. The 
most telling argument against a non- 
proliferation treaty stresses that such 
a treaty would perpetuate the mono- 
poly in atomic weapons of the present 
nuclear nations. This overlooks the 
point that an agreement on the non- 
proliferation of nuclear weapons is not 
an end in itself but only a first indis- 
pensable step towards the total 
banning of these weapons and their 
destruction in arsenals everywhere in 
the world. Furthermore, should such 
a non-proliferation treaty become a 
reality, it is proposed that the non- 
nuclear powers would be completely 
guaranteed against any possible 
nuclear attack by a nuclear power. 
Another argument against non-pro- 
liferation holds that the banning of 
production of nuclear weapons (as 
well as the control necessary to 
enforce the ban) would hamper tech- 
nical development in the contracting 
countries by preventing them from 
using atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes. lt should not be difficult, 
however, to devise forms of control 
that would not prejudice a nation's 
industrial development. Furthermore, 
the pooling of knowledge and research 
in the peaceful use of atomic energy 
would increase as the possibility of its 
being employed in the manufacture of 
arms was eliminated. 
It is easy to understand—though not 
always easy to approve—the reasons 
that prompt nations to keep arms in 
their arsenals. But the sums spent 
are staggering. In 1964 the world 
poured down the drain the astronomi- 
cal sum of 120,000 million dollars for 
armaments. The figure is consider- 
ably higher today. If some imaginary 
inhabitant of another solar system 
was to visit our planet he would no 
doubt find it hard to understand why 
we Earthlings squander our resources 
and energies so uselessly. 
The examples of Vietnam and the 
Middle East make it abundantly clear 
that in this day and age no problem 
can be resolved by resort to war. 
And even less so by resorting to 
nuclear weapons. The problem of 
armaments today and their destructive 
nature is thus the most poignant issue 
of our time. 
N 1967, the U.S.S.R. will 
spend 14,500 million roubles (13.2 per 
cent of its budget) on defence. (1) 
There are undoubtedly many ways in 
which this money could be usefully 
employed in the Soviet Union. The 
United States spends even huger sums 
on arms, including the war in Vietnam. 
  
(1) Editor's note: The U.S.S.R. does not 
include research and development costs in 
its defence budget. Total actual defence 
expenditure for 1966 has been estimated 
at over 35000 million dollars. (The 
exchange rate of the rouble is one rouble 
= 90 U.S. cents.) 
And it too still has many social prob- 
lems to solve, bottlenecks in educa- 
tion, public health and science, where 
these resources now spent on arms, 
could be usefully employed. . 
On the assumption that arms expen- 
diture remained at the present level 
(which no one really wants), the Soviet 
Union will spend 230,000 million rou- 
bles in the course of the next 20 years. 
If general and complete disarmament 
were to become a reality, and suppos- 
ing even that 20 per cent of the money 
saved by disarmament were diverted 
for the developing countries, the 
U.S.S.R. would still have 230,000 
million roubles left over for useful 
purposes. The money could be spent 
for an infinite variety of purposes, to 
raise the standard of living of the 
Soviet people, to launch large-scale 
development projects in Siberia, irri- 
gate desert lands, etc... 
A look at a map of world 
development shows us that entire 
continents are in need of resources 
and assistance to carry through their 
full development. To cite only one 
example, the harnessing of the world's 
water resources could transform vast 
regions of our planet. In Asia, the 
Indus and the Mekong, the Tigris and 
Euphrates ; in Africa, the Nile and its 
tributaries, and the Congo; in Latin 
America, the Parana and the Amazon. 
Mankind is only now becoming 
aware of the great riches and possi- 
bilities at its disposal. Were these to 
be effectively exploited, they could 
eliminate hunger, sickness and many 
other problems due to low living 
standards, such as illiteracy which still 
affects many hundreds of millions of 
the inhabitants of developing countries. 
By the rational use of its energy and 
intelligence, mankind could fulfil its 
destiny at a much more rapid pace, 
and even on a universal scale now 
that man is moving beyond the limits 
of the earth's gravity. 
In ancient times, people used to 
dream about the “Golden Age”. But in 
the times of Plato or Thomas More, 
this was in fact a Utopia, a mere 
dream of happiness. Today, with the 
help of electronic machines we can 
calculate the extent to which progress 
in various spheres of human existence 
would be speeded up should an epoch 
of general peace and complete dis- 
armament be ushered in.

### 16538: Development, new name for peace; Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI

DEVELOPMENT- 
NEW NAME FOR PEACE 
Encyclical Letter 
of His Holiness Pope Paul Vi  
On March 26, 1967, His Holiness Pope Paul VI issued a far-reaching 
Encyclical Letter on the Development of Peoples, calling on all men of 
goodwill to join in freeing the world of its present poverty and inequities. 
“The peoples in hunger are making a dramatic appeal to the peoples blessed 
with abundance”, His Holiness said. Pope Paul stressed the urgency of 
the action that should be taken in a spirit of universal solidarity to assure 
the development of all mankind. “Development”, he affirmed, “is the new 
name for Peace.” 
The Pope made an unprecedented gesture by addressing the first copies 
of the Encyclical, bearing his signature, to U Thant, Secretary-General of 
the United Nations, to Mr. René Maheu, Director-General of Unesco and 
to Dr. Binay Ranjan Sen, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture 
Organization. 
We publish below salient passages from the Encyclical, and on page 35 the 
response of Mr. René Maheu, inspired by the message of this historic 
28 
document. 
F.... from misery, the greater 
assurance of finding subsistence, health and fixed employ- 
ment: an increased share of responsibility without oppres- 
sion of any kind and in security from situations that do 
violence to their dignity as men; better education—in brief, 
to seek to do more, know more and have more in order 
to be more: that is what men aspire to now when a 
greater number of them are condemned to live in con- 
ditions that make this lawful desire illusory. 
Besides, peoples who have recently gained national inde- 
pendence experience the need to add to this political 
freedom a fitting autonomous growth, social as well as 
economic, In order to assure their citizens of a full human 
enhancement and to take their rightful place with other 
nations, (6) 
Colonization and colonialism. Though insufficient for the 
immensity and urgency of the task, the means inherited 
from the past are not lacking. It must certainly be rec- 
ognized that colonizing powers have often furthered their 
own interests, power or glory, and that their departure 
has sometimes left a precarious economy, bound up for 
instance with the production of one kind of crop whose 
market prices are subject to sudden and considerable 
variation. 
Yet while recognizing the damage done by a certain 
type of colonialism and its consequences, one must at the 
same time acknowledge the qualities and achievement of 
colonizers who brought their science and technical know- 
ledge and left beneficial results of their presence in so 
many underprivileged regions. 
The structures established by them persist, however in- 
complete they may be; they diminished ignorance and 
sickness, brought the benefits of communications and im- 
proved living conditions. (7) 
| ncreasing imbalance. Yet once this is admitted, it remains 
only too true that the resultant situation is manifestly in- 
dequate for facing the hard reality of modern economics. 
left to itself it works rather to widen the differences in 
the world’s level of life, not to diminish them; rich peoples 
enjoy rapid growth whereas the poor develop slowly. The 
imbalance is on the increase: some produce a surplus of 
foodstuffs, others cruelly lack them and see their exports 
made uncertain. (8). 
U ndeserved hardship. At the same time social conflicts 
have taken on world dimensions. The acute disquiet which 
has taken hold of the poor classes in countries that are 
becoming industrialized, is now embracing those whose eco- 
nomy is almost exclusively agrarian: farming people, too, 
are becoming aware of their “undeserved hardship.” 
There is also the scandal of glaring inequalities not merely 
in the enjoyment of possessions but even more in the 
exercise of power, While a small restricted group enjoys 
a refined civilization in certain regions, the remainder of 
the population, poor and scattered, is “deprived of nearly 
all possibility of personal initiative and of responsibility, and 
oftentimes even its living and working conditions are un- 
worthy of the human person”. (9) 
C onflict of civilizations. Furthermore, the conflict between 
traditional civilizations and the new elements of industrial 
civilization, break down structures which do not adapt 
themselves to new conditions. Their framework, some- 
times rigid, was the indispensable prop to personal and 
family life; older people remain attached to it, the young 
escape from it, as from a useless barrier, to turn eagerly 
to new forms of life in society. 
The conflict of the generations is made more serious 
by a tragic dilemma: whether to retain ancestral institu- 
tions and convictions and renounce progress, or to admit

techniques and civilizations from outside and reject along 
with the traditions of the past all their human richness. 
In effect, the moral, spiritual and religious supports of 
the past too often give way without securing in return 
any guarantee of a place in the new world. (10) 
D angerous confusion. In this confusion the temptation be- 
comes stronger to risk being swept away towards types 
of messianism which give promises but create illusions. 
The resulting dangers are patent: violent popular reactions, 
agitation towards insurrection, and a drifting towards tota- 
litarian ideologies. Such are the data of the problem. 
Its seriousness is evident to all. (11) 
E conomic growth not enough. Development cannot be 
limited to mere economic growth. In order to be authentic, 
it must be complete: integral, that is, it has to promote the 
good of every man and of the whole man. . . (14). 
A world responsibility. But each man is a member of 
society. He is part of the whole of mankind. It is not 
just certain individuals, but all men who are called to this 
fullness of development. Civilizations are born, develop 
and die. But humanity is advancing along the path of 
history like the waves of a rising tide encroaching gradually 
on the shore. We have inherited from past generations, 
and we have benefitted from the work of our contempora- 
ries: for this reason we have obligations towards all, 
and we cannot refuse to interest ourselves in those who 
will come after us to enlarge the human family. . . (17) 
The ambivalence of growth. . . All growth is ambivalent. 
It is essential if man is to develop as a man, but in 
a way it imprisons man if he considers it the supreme 
good, and it restricts his vision. Then we see hearts 
harden and minds close, and men no longer gather 
together in friendship but out of self-interest, which soon 
leads to oppositions and disunity. The exclusive pursuit 
of possessions thus become an obstacle to individual ful- 
filment and to man's true greatness. Both for nations and 
for individual men, avarice is the most evident form of 
moral underdevelopment. (19) 
T owards a more human condition. If further development 
calls for the work of more and more technicians, even more 
necessary is the deep thought and reflection of wise men 
: in search of a new humanism which will enable modern 
) man to find himself anew by embracing the higher values 
of love and friendship, of prayer and contemplation. This is 
what will permit the fullness of authentic development, a 
development which is for each and all the transition from 
less human conditions to those which are more human, (20)

of material necessities for those who are without the 
minimum essential for life, the moral deficiencies of those 
who are mutilated by selfishness. Less human conditions:

oppressive social structures, whether due to the abuses 
of ownership or to abuses of power, to the exploitation 
of workers or to unjust transactions, Conditions that are 
more human: the passage from misery towards the pos- 
session of necessities, victory over social scourges, the 
growth of knowledge, the acquisition of culture. Addi- 
tional conditions that are more human; increased esteem 
for the dignity of others, the turning toward the spirit of 
poverty, co-operation for the common good, the will and 
desire for peace. . . (21) 
| ndustriatization. The introduction of industry is a ne- 
cessity for economic growth and human progress; it is also 
a sign of development and contributes to it. By persis- 
tent work and use of his intelligence man gradually wrests 
nature's secrets from her and finds a better application for 
her riches. As his self-mastery increases, he develops a 
taste for research and discovery, an ability to take a cal- 
culated risk, boldness in enterprises, generosity in what 
he does and a sense of responsibility. (25) 
Liberal capitalism. But it is unfortunate that on these new 
conditions of society a system has been constructed which 
considers profit as the key motive for economic progress, 
competition as the supreme law of economics, and private 
ownership of the means of production as an absolute 
right that has no limits and carries no corresponding social 
obligation. 
This unchecked liberalism leads to dictatorship rightly 
denounced by Pius Xl as producing “the international im- 
perialism of money.” One cannot condemn such abuses too 
strongly by solemnly recalling once again that the economy 
is at the service of man. 
But if it is true that a type of capitalism has been the 
source of excessive suffering, injustices and fratricidal con- 
flicts whose effects still persist, it would also be wrong to 
attribute to industrialization itself evils that belong to the 
woeful system which accompanied it. On the contrary 
one must recognize in all justice the irreplaceable contri- 
bution made by the organization of labour and of industry 
to what development has accomplished. (26) 
U rgency of the task. We must make haste: too many are 
suffering, and the distance is growing that separates the 
progress of some and the stagnation, not to say the 
regression, of others. . . (29) 
T emptation to violence. There are certainly situations 
whose injustice cries to heaven. When whole populations 
destitute of necessities live in a state of dependence barring 
them from all initiative and responsibility, and all opportunity 
to advance culturally and share in social and political 
life, recourse to violence, as a means to right these 
wrongs to human dignity, is a grave temptation. (30) 
R evolution. We know, however, that a revolutionary 
uprising—save where there is manifest, long-standing tyran- 
ny which would do great damage to fundamental personal 
rights and dangerous harm to the common good of the 
country—produces new injustices, throws more elements 
out of balance and brings on new disasters. A real evil 
should not be fought against at the cost of greater 
misery. (31) 
R eform. We want to be clearly understood: the present 
situation must be faced with courage and the injustices 
linked with it must be fought against and overcome. 
Development demands bold transformations, innovations 
that go deep. Urgent reforms should be undertaken 
without delay. It is for each one to take his share in 
them with generosity, particularly those whose education, 
position and opportunities afford them wide scope for 
action. . . (32) 
At man’s service, . . It is not sufficient to promote 
technology to render the world a more human place in 
which to live. The mistakes of their predecessors should 
warn those on the road to development of the dangers 
to be avoided in this field. To-morrow's technocracy can 
beget evils no less redoubtable than those due to the 
liberalism of yesterday. 
Economics and technology have no meaning except from 
man whom they should serve. And man is only truly man 
in as far as, master of his own acts and judge of their 
worth, he is author of his own advancement, in keeping 
with the nature which was given to him by his Creator 
and whose possibilities and exigencies he himself freely 
assumes. (34) 
E torts to achieve literacy. It can even be affirmed that 
economic growth depends in the very first place upon 
social progress: thus basic education is the primary object 
of any plan of development. Indeed hunger for education 
is no less debasing than hunger for food: an illiterate is 
a person with an undernourished mind. To be able to 
read and write, to acquire a professional formation, means 
to recover confidence in oneself and to discover that 
one can progress along with the others, 
As We said in Our message to the Unesco Congress 
held in 1965 at Teheran, for man literacy is “a fundamental 
factor of social integration, as well as of personal enrich- 
ment, and for society it is a privileged instrument of 
economic progress and of development”. 
We also rejoice at the good work accomplished in 
this field by private initiative, by the public authorities 
and by international organizations: these are the primary 
agents of development, because they render man capable 
of acting for himself, . . (35) 
D emography. It is true that too frequently an accelerated 
demographic increase adds its own difficulties to the 
problems of development: the size of the population 
increases more rapidly than available resources, and things 
are found to have reached apparently an impasse. From 
that moment the temptation is great to check the demo- 
graphic increase by means of radical measures. 
It is certain that public authorities can intervene, within 
the limit of their competence, by favouring the availability 
of appropriate information and by adopting suitable 
measures, provided that these be in conformity with the 
moral law and that they respect the rightful freedom of 
married couples. Where the inalienable right to marriage 
and procreation is lacking, human dignity has ceased to 
exist. 
Finally, it is for the parents to decide, with full knowledge 
of the matter, on the number of their children, taking into 
account their responsibilities towards God, themselves, 
the children they have already brought into the world, 
and the community to which they belong. In all this 
they must follow the demands of their own conscience 
enlightened by God's law authentically interpreted, and 
sustained by confidence in Him. (37) 
P romotion of culture, In addition to professional organiza- 
tions, there are also institutions which are at work. Their 
role is no less important for the success of development. 
“The future of the world stands in peril”, the Vatican 
Council gravely affirms, “unless wiser men are forthcoming”. 
And it adds: “many nations, poorer in economic goods,

are quite rich in wisdom and able to offer noteworthy 
advantages to others”. 
Rich or poor, each country possesses a civilization hand- 
ed down by their ancestors: institutions called for by life 
in this world, and higher manifestations of the life of the 
spirit, manifestations of an artistic, intellectual and religious 
character. When the latter possess true human values, 
it would be a grave error to sacrifice them to the former. 
A people that would act in this way would thereby lose 
the best of its patrimony; in order to live, it would be 
sacrificing its reasons for living. . . (40) 
S pirit of solidarity. There can be no progress towards 
the complete development of man without the simultaneous 
development of all humanity in the spirit of solidarity. As 
We said at Bombay: “Man must meet man, nation meet 
nation, as brothers and sisters, as children of God. In 
this mutual! understanding and friendship, in this sacred 
communion, we must also begin to work together to build 
the common future of the human race.” We also suggested 
a search for concrete and practical ways of organization 
and co-operation, so that all available resources be pooled 
and thus a true communion among all nations be 
achieved. (43) 
B rotherhood of peoples. This duty is the concern 
especially of better-off nations, Their obligations stem 
from a brotherhood that is at once human and super- 
natural, and take on a threefold aspect: the duty 
of human solidarity—the aid that the rich nations 
must give to developing countries; the duty of social 
justice—the rectification of inequitable trade relations 
between powerful nations and weak nations; the duty of 
universal charity—the effort to bring about a world that 
is more human towards all men, where all will be able 
to give and receive , without one group making progress 
at the expense of the other. The question is urgent, for 
on it depends the future of the civilization of the world. 
(44) 
WwW ar against hunger. . . Today no one can be ignorant 
any longer of the fact that in whole continents countless 
men and women are ravished by hunger, countless numbers 
of children are undernourished, so that many of them 
die in infancy, while the physical growth and mental 
development of many others are retarded and as a result 
whole regions are condemned to the most depressing 
despondency... The campaign against hunger being 
carried on by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAQ) 
and encouraged by the Holy See, has been generously 
supported. . . (45) 
Let each examine his conscience. But... it is not just 
a matter of eliminating hunger, nor even of reducing 
poverty. The struggle against destitution, though urgent 
and necessary, is not enough. It is a question, rather, 
of building a world where every man, no matter what 
his race, religion or nationality, can live a fully human 
life, free from servitude imposed on him by other men 
or by natural forces over which he has not sufficient control; 
a world where freedom is not an empty word and where 
the poor man Lazarus can sit down at the same table 
with the rich man. This demands great generosity, much 
sacrifice and unceasing effort on the part of the rich 
man. 
Let each one examine his conscience, a conscience that 
conveys a new message for our times. Is he prepared 
to support out of his own pocket works and undertakings 
organized in favour of the most destitute? Is he ready 
to pay higher taxes so that the public authorities can 
intensify their efforts in favour of development? Is he 
ready to pay a higher price for imported goods so that 
the producer may be more justly rewarded? Or to leave 
his country, if necessary and if he is young, in order 
to assist in this development of the young nations? (47) 
D uty of human solidarity. The same duty of solidarity 
that rests on individuals exists also for nations: “Advanced 
nations have a very heavy obligation to help the develop- 
ing peoples”. . . Every nation must produce more and 
better quality goods to give to all its inhabitants a truly 
human standard of living, and also to contribute to the 
common development of the human race. 
Given the increasing needs of the under-developed 
countries, it should be considered quite normal for an 
advanced country to devote a part of its production to 
meet their needs, and to train teachers, engineers, 
technicians and scholars prepared to put their knowledge 
and their skill at the disposal of less fortunate peoples. (48) 
S uperfluous wealth. We must repeat once more that the 
superfluous wealth of rich countries should be placed at 
the service of poor nations. The rule which up to now 
held good for the benefit of those nearest to us, must today 
be applied to all the needy of this world. 
Besides, the rich will be the first to benefit as a result. 
Otherwise their continued greed will certainly call down 
upon them the judgement of God and the wrath of the 
poor, with consequences no one can foretell. If today's 
flourishing civilizations remain selfishly wrapped up in 
themselves, they could easily place their highest values 
in jeopardy, sacrificing their will to be great to the desire 
to possess more. . . (49) 
A World Fund. . . At Bombay, We called for the estab- 
lishment of a great World Fund, to be made up of part 
of the money spent on arms, to relieve the most destitute 
of this world. What is true of the immediate struggle 
against want, holds good also when there is a question of 
development. Only world-wide collaboration, of which a 
common fund would be both means and symbol, will 
succeed in overcoming vain rivalries and in establishing a 
fruitful and peaceful exchange between peoples. (51) 
A id without strings. There is certainly no need to do 
away with bilateral and multilateral agreements: they 
allow ties of dependence and feeling of bitterness, left 
over from the era of colonialism, to yield place to the 
happier relationship of friendship, based on a footing of 
constitutional and political equality. 
However, if they were to be fitted into the framework of 
world-wide collaboration, they would be beyond all suspi- 
cion, and as a result there would be less distrust on the part 
of the receiving nations. These would have less cause 
for fearing that, under the cloak of financial aid or technical 
assistance, there lurk certain manifestations of what has 
come to be called neo-colonialism, in the form of political 
pressures and economic suzerainty aimed at maintaining 
or acquiring complete dominance. (52) 
A rms race an intolerable scandal. Besides who does 
not see that such a fund would make it easier to take 
measures to prevent certain wasteful expenditures, the 
result of fear or pride? 
When so many people are hungry, when so many fami- 
lies suffer from destitution, when so many remain steeped 
in ignorance, when so many schools, hospitals and homes 
worthy of the name remain to be built, all public or private 
squandering of wealth, all expenditure prompted by motives 
of national or personal ostentation, every exhausting arma- 
ments race, becomes an intolerable scandal.

### 16538: Development, new name for peace; Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI

We are conscious of Our duty to denounce it. Would 
that those in authority listened to Our words before it is 
too latel (53) 
D ialogue among all peoples. This means that it is 
absolutely necessary to create among all peoples that 
dialogue for whose establishment We expressed Our hope 
in Our first Encyclical Ecclesiam Suam. This dialogue 
between those who contribute wealth and those who 
benefit from it, will provide the possibilty of making an 
assessment of the contribution necessary, not only drawn 
up in terms of the generosity and the available wealth of 
the donor nations, but also conditioned by the real needs 
of the receiving countries and the use to which the financial 
assistance can be put. 
Developing countries will thus no longer risk being 
overwhelmed by debts whose repayment swallows up the 
greater part of their gains. Rates of interest and time for 
repayment of the loan could be so arranged as not to be 
too great a burden on either party, taking into account 
free gifts, interest-free or low-interest loans, and the time 
needed for liquidating the debts. Guarantees could be 
given to those who provide the capital that it will be put 
to use according to an agreed plan and with a reasonable 
measure of efficiency, since there is no question of 
encouraging parasites or the indolent. 
And the receiving countries could demand that there 
be no interference in their political life or subversion of 
their social structures. As sovereign states they have 
the right to conduct their own affairs, to decide on their 
policies and to move freely towards the kind of society 
they choose. 
What must be brought about, therefore, is a system of 
co-operation freely undertaken, an effective and mutual 
sharing, carried out with equal dignity on either side, for 
the construction of a more human world. (54) 
W ond peace at stake. . . This common task will not 
succeed without concerted, constant and courageous 
efforts. But let everyone be convinced of this: the very 
life of poor nations, civil peace in developing countries, 
and world peace itself are at stake. (55). 
E quity in trade relations. The efforts which are being 
made to assist developing nations on a financial and tech- 
nical basis, though considerable, would be illusory if their 
benefits were to be partially nullified as a consequence 
of the trade relations existing between rich and poor 
countries. The confidence of these latter would be 
severely shaken if they had the impression that what was 
being given them with one hand was being taken away 
with the other. (56) 
| ncreasing disproportion. Of course, highly industrialized 
nations export for the most part manufactured goods, while 
countries with less developed economies have only food, 
fibres and other raw materials to sell. As a result of 
technical progress the value of manufactured goods is 
rapidly increasing and they can always find an adequate 
market. 
On the other hand, raw materials produced by under- 
developed countries are subject to wide and sudden fiuc- 
tuations in price, a state of affairs far removed from the 
progressively increasing value of industrial products. As 
a result, nations whose industrialization is limited are 
faced with serious difficulties when they have to rely on 
their exports to balance their economy and to carry out 
their plans for development. The poor nations remain 
ever poor while the rich ones become still richer. (57) 
Liberalism in question. In other words, the rule of free 
trade, taken by itself, is no longer able to govern interna- 
tional relations. Its advantages are certainly evident when 
the parties involved are not affected by any excessive 
inequalities of economic power: it is an incentive to pro- 
gress and a reward for effort. 
That is why industrially developed countries see in it a 
law of justice. But the situation is no longer the same 
when economic conditions differ too widely from country 
to country: prices which are “freely” set in the market 
can produce unfair results. One must recognize that it Is 
the fundamental principle of liberalism, as the rule for 
commercial exchange, which is questioned here. (58) 
Obstacles to overcome: Nationalism. Among still other 
obstacles which are opposed to the formation of a world 
which is more just and which is better organized toward 
a universal solidarity, We wish to speak of nationalism 
and racism. 
It is only natural that communities which have recently 
reached their political independence should be jealous of 
a national unity which is still fragile, and that they should 
strive to protect it. Likewise, it is to be expected that 
nations endowed with an ancient culture should be 
proud of the patrimony which their history has bequeathed 
to them. But these legitimate feelings should be ennobled 
by that universal charity which embraces the entire human 
family. 
Nationalism isolates people from their true good. It 
would be especially harmful where the weakness of national 
economies demands rather the pooling of efforts, of 
knowledge and of funds, in order to implement programmes 
of development and to increase commercial and cultural 
exchange. (62) 
R acism. Racism is not the exclusive lot of young 
nations, where sometimes it hides beneath the rivalries of 
clans and political parties, with heavy losses for justice 
and at the risk of civil war. During the colonial period it 
often flared up between the colonists and the indigenous 
population, and stood in the way of mutually profitable 
understanding, often giving rise to bitterness in the wake 
of genuine injustices, 
It is still an obstacle to collaboration among disadvantaged 
nations and a cause of division and hatred within countries 
whenever individuals and families see the inviolable 
rights of the human person held in scorn, as they them- 
selves are unjustly subjected to a regime of discrimination 
because of their race or their colour. (63) 
For a unified world, We are deeply distressed by such 
a situation which is laden with threats for the future. We 
are, nonetheless, hopeful: a more deeply felt need for 
collaboration, a heightened sense of unity will finally 
triumph over misunderstandings and selfishness. 
We hope that the countries whose development is less 
advanced will be able to take advantage of their proximity 
in order to organize among themselves, on a broadened 
territorial basis, areas for concerted development: to draw 
up programmes in common, to co-ordinate investments, to 
distribute the means of production, and to organize trade. 
We hope also that multilateral and international bodies, 
by means of the reorganization which is required, will 
discover the ways that will allow peoples which are still 
under-developed to break through the barriers which seem 
to enclose them and to discover for themselves, in full 
fidelity to their own proper genius, the means for their 
social and human progress. (64)

### 16923: To build a new order in the world

36 
NEW NAME FOR PEACE (Continued) 
A rtisans of their own destiny. Such is the goal we must 
attain. World unity, ever more effective, should allow 
all peoples to become the artisans of their destiny. The 
past has too often been characterized by relationships of 
violence between nations; may the day dawn when inter- 
national relations will be marked with the stamp of mutual 
respect and friendship, of interdependence in collaboration, 
the betterment of all seen as the responsibility of each 
individual. 
The younger or weaker nations ask to assume their 
active part in the construction of a better world, one which 
shows deeper respect for the rights and the vocation of the 
individual. This is a legitimate appeal; everyone should 
hear it and respond to it. (65) 
D evelopment, the new name for peace. Excessive eco- 
nomic, social and cultural inequalities among peoples 
arouse tensions and conflicts, and are a danger to peace... | 
Peace cannot be limited to a mere absence of war, the 
result of an ever precarious balance of forces. No, peace 
is something that is built up day after day, in the pursuit 
of an order intended by God, which implies a more perfect 
form of justice among men. (76) 
An end to isolation. The peoples themselves have the 
prime responsibility to work for their own development. 
But they will not bring this about in isolation. Regional 
agreements among weak nations for mutual support, under- 
standings of wider scope entered into for their help, more 
far-reaching agreements to establish programmes for closer 
co-operation among groups of nations—these are the 
milestones on the road to development that leads to 
peace. (77) 
N eed for a world authority. This international collabora- 
tion on a world-wide scale requires institutions that will pre- 
pare, co-ordinate and direct it, until finally there is estab- 
lished an order of justice which is universally recognized. 
With all Our heart, We encourage these organizations 
which have undertaken this collaboration for the develop- 
ment of the peoples of the world, and Our wish is that 
they grow in prestige and authority. 
“Your vocation,” as We said to the representatives of 
the United Nations in New York, “is to bring not some 
people but all peoples to treat each other as brothers. . . 
Who does not see the necessity of thus establishing pro- 
gressively a world authority, capable of acting effectively 
in the juridical and political sectors?” (78) 
Progress of the human family. Some would consider 
such hopes Utopian. It may be that these persons are 
not realistic enough, and that they have not perceived 
the dynamism of a world which desires to live more fra- 
ternally—a world which, in spite of its ignorance, 
its mistakes and even its sins, its relapses into barbarism 
and its wanderings far from the road of salvation, is, even 
unawares, taking slow but sure steps towards its Creator. 
This road towards a greater humanity requires effort and 
sacrifice; but suffering itself, accepted for the love of 
our brethren, favours the progress of the entire human 
family. . . (79) 
U niversal solidarity. We have desired to remind all men 
how crucial is the present moment, how urgent the work 
to be done. The hour for action has now sounded. At 
stake are the survival of so many innocent children and, 
for so many families overcome by misery, the access to 
conditions fit for human beings; at stake are the peace 
of the world and the future of civilization, It is time for all 
men and all peoples to face up to their responsibilities. (80)

the Holy Father who, in this vital

### 16923: To build a new order in the world

A NEW ORDER IN THE WORLD 
touches us most in the Encyclical, 
beyond the support and assistance 
extended to our work, is the profound 
agreement which clearly emerges in 
the spirit, and sometimes almost in 
the letter, between the views of the 
Holy Father concerning the problems, 
aims and methods of development 
and those which Unesco has cons- 
tantly promoted since the beginning 
of this decade. | should like to draw 
attention to the essential points on 
which we find this harmony of views. 
First of all, concerning the nature 
of the problem. Like His Holiness 
Paul VI, we believe that development 
is, in the strictest sense of the terms, 
a work of “justice and peace”. 
For the Twentieth-century world, 
underdevelopment is what the social 
question was for the countries which 
were carrying out their industrial revo- 
lution in the Nineteenth century. As 
the Encyclical makes clear, it is in 
fact the same problem that is involved, 
but extended to the scale of the world 
as a whole: the old problem of in- 
equity in the organization of society. 
“Too many are suffering, and the 
distance is growing that separates the 
Ph

Cl

Ba
bl
in
 
progress of some and the stagnation, 
not to say the regression, of others.” 
There is no true remedy for this 
inequitable situation other than mea- 
sures—increasingly urgent measures— 
to secure justice. This should not be 
interpreted as meaning arrangements 
to make bitter poverty bearable and 
inequity less shocking; what is needed 
is the establishment of an order which 
will gradually reduce and ultimately 
eliminate the causes of this inequity 
and poverty. Above all, we must see 
that we do not have "one group 
making progress at the expense of 
the other”, since this betokens a radi- 
cal injustice affecting the basic struc- 
tures and conditions of social 
dynamics. 
But if development is a work of 
justice, it is also a work of peace, and 
here the most elementary and the most 
general interest combines with the 
loftiest duty. 
The weakness of the poor presents 
a dangerous temptation to the greed 
and the lust for domination of the 
powerful. And exploitation and domi- 
nation in turn engender revolt. It 
would be wrong to delude ourselves 
concerning the apparent tranquility 
that has followed the accession to 
political independence of so many 
countries which but yesterday were 
still subject to colonial rule. Deep 
currents are stirring in the developing 
countries as they make the bitter 
discovery that the independence so 
ardently desired is still relative. 
This deprived section of mankind 
has lost nothing of its extraordinary 
capacity to endure poverty; on the 
other hand, it is less and less ready 
to accept inequity precisely because 
of its newly-acquired political aware- 
ness. History records many terrible 
outbursts of righteous anger from the 
oppressed; the world has been 
shaken by similar upheavals even in 
the present century. 
Among the distinguished thinkers 
to whom the Pope appeals to study 
our troubled world, | know of some 
who are asking themselves anguishing 
questions about what the next decade 
will bring, when overpopulation, hun- 
ger, poverty and racial antagonisms 
reach their peak at the same time 
and combine to form one great tragic 
problem. They are increasingly aware 
that development is the only way of 
avoiding upheavals on a planetary 
scale. 
Development is also—indirectly 
but nevertheless essentially inter- 
connected with it—the best way of con- 
verting force to peaceful purposes . . . 
| am quite aware that the world 
conflicts of modern times have set 
the most highly developed countries 
in opposition and that, in many res- 
pects, these conflicts have derived 
from the contradictions inherent in 
development itself. But this was a 
development of power, seeking con- 
stantly to possess more, and not a 
development of humanity, seeking to 
" be more". 
Development, as we now under- 
stand it—the development which 
calls for assistance to the weak within 
the context of a just and rational 
organization of mankind as a whole— 
cannot be achieved or even conceived 
unless objectivity rules the mind and 
brotherhood the heart, these being 
the very principles of the will to 
peace. And if it is true that economic 
necessity will one day compel us to 
choose between universal develop- 
ment and the headlong arms race, it 
is even more evident that the pro- 
found, whole-hearted commitment of 
the rich and powerful nations with all 
their resources to the work of devel- 
opment would represent, and result

Proto Unesco - D. Seymour 
The human mind on the march 
in, a general conversion of mankind 
to peace. 
The second point of agreement 
that | should like to note is the concep- 
tion of development. We in Unesco 
also believe that "in order to be 
authentic, (development) must be 
complete: integral, that is, it has to 
promote the good of every man and 
of the whole man” . .. 
To proclaim the overriding need 
for the integral development of what 
is human is, in concrete terms, to 
affirm the primacy of the individual in 
the process of development, as the 
subject, agent and end of that devel- 
opment. 
It implies the condemnation of 
technocracy, which is the cult of effi- 
ciency measured by standards that 
leave the individual altogether out of 
account and which, as the Encyclical 
puts it so well, "can beget evils no 
less redoubtable than those due to 
the liberalism of yesterday". In more 
general terms, it implies subjecting 
economics to ethical considerations, 
or rather infusing humanism into 
economics so that, abandoning the 
abstract for the concrete, it may lake 
on new life. " Economics and tech- 
nology have no meaning except from 
man whom they should serve”. 
Finally and above all, it means recog- 
nizing—that is to say, demonstrat- 
ing—that there can be no real 
development except that brought about 
within himself by a man's indepen- 
dent efforts. ' Man is only truly man 
in as far as, master of his own acts 
and judge of their worth, he Is author 
of his own advancement”, which 
amounts to saying that the only true 
progress is endogenous. 
The requirements of practical action, 
no less than the essentially humanis- 
tic mission it has to fulfil, have made 
Unesco increasingly aware of these 
essential truths, which clearly reveal 
the significance of Unesco's particular 
contribution to development. Once it 
is realized that the only development 
is that of man, through man and for 
man, then it becomes evident that 
education, science and culture are the 
foundation and the culmination, the 
driving force and the justifying end of 
development in its essence. It has 
been said that development Is pri- 
marily a state of mind; we might go 
further and say that development is 
the human mind on the march in 
history. 
Education, which is preparation, 
science, which is discovery and 
explanation, culture, which is exami- 
nation and assimilation, represent the 
decisive phases and aspects of this 
progress of the mind. It is for this 
reason that we find them, at the most 
essential level, in the gradual unfold- 
ing of development. Everything 
begins with education, since no appro- 
priation, utilization or development of 
nature and society is possible without 
education: hence the universal priority 
accorded to it. 
The implantation of science is the 
key operation in development; it differs 
very greatly from the mere import of 
techniques which, even if it leads to 
local progress—generally superficial 
and seldom lasting—perpetuates the 
economic and intellectual dependence 
of the developing peoples. Finally, it is 
abundantly clear that there can be no 
development from within except where 
scientific civilization has taken root, in 
other words, where science * has 
ceased to be an alien magic and has 
become culture. 
This, then, is the humanistic concep- 
tion of integral development which we 
share. Yet perhaps the most 
remarkable statement of views in the 
Encyclical is the declaration, knit- 
ting. together the whole, that there 
can be no progress towards the com- 
plete development of the individual 
man without the simultaneous deve- 
lopment of all men in the spirit of 
solidarity. And of that, too, we in 
Unesco are profoundly convinced. 
Indeed, that belief is the very reason 
for our existence. 
It is therefore an immense source 
of satisfaction and encouragement for 
us that the Holy Father should lay 
such stress, as he did before the 
General Assembly of the United 
Nations, on the necessity for a world 
authority and on the urgent need, in 
the meantime, to increase the resour-

### 16923: To build a new order in the world

ces, activities and prestige of the 
international organizations concerned 
with development. 
It is very true that the efforts of 
these institutions can do more than 
any other form of aid to bring about, 
as desired in the Encyclical, ”" a system 
of co-operation freely undertaken, an 
effective and mutual sharing, carried 
out with equal dignity on either side, 
for the construction of a more human 
world”. Not because greater resour- 
ces are available for those efforts— 
as we know, that is very far from 
being the case—but, first and fore- 
most, because they alone are comple- 
tely disinterested. And also because 
they are better suited to the nature of 
the task, which is the organization of 
a new order in the world . . . 
If | have drawn attention, even at 
the risk of repeating the obvious, to 
the main points of a fundamental har- 
mony of views on development 
between the Encyclical and the ideas 
on which Unesco’s action and its very 
existence are based, it is in no way 
merely to record for history the fact— 
significant as it isl—that a Church 
now resolutely open to the world and 
an intergovernmental institution which 
is becoming increasingly aware of the 
spiritual dimension of its intellectual 
and practical undertaking have come 
together in the service of man. 
It is, firstly, in order to be able 
to give the Sovereign Pontiff a clear 
assurance that his ideas will meet 
with particular understanding within 
Unesco. lt is also, and perhaps above 
all, to convey to him my conviction 
 
that Unesco, at its own level, and 
without departing from its own princi- 
ples and methods, will spontaneously 
answer his appeal with action . . . 
For myself, though | cannot pre- 
judge what that action will be, | will 
say that | share the anguish of the 
appeal and endorse its fervour. 
Yes, | believe that “the hour for 
action has now sounded” and that “at 
stake are the peace of the world and 
the future of civilization”. It is my 
ardent desire that the peoples should 
feel this, and governments understand 
it, while there is still time. 
So far as governments are con- 
cerned, would it be too much to 
express the hope—which | can do only 
in my personal capacity—that in the 
near future a conference of the world’s 
responsible leaders may be held at 
the highest level to consider the 
problems of development, not separ- 
ately, sector by sector, as is usually 
done, but as a whole, with a view to 
finding radical overall solutions 7 
| mean a conference which would 
reorganize the relations between the 
wealthy nations and the poor nations, 
like the conferences held after great 
world conflicts to reorganize the rela- 
tions between the powers, but one 
more deserving than were those set- 
tlements and partitions, of the fair 
name of Peace Conference, since the 
object would be to forestall violence 
by justice, not to repair its effects by 
force after the catastrophe. 
Such a conference would have to 
deal, among other things, with the 
   
Photo Unesco - Jack Ling 
question of trade relations between 
industrialized countries and under- 
developed countries, the present ine- 
quity of which the Holy Father has so 
rightly emphasized. It could also take 
steps—and no doubt would quite 
naturally be led to do so—to strengthen 
very considerably, if necessary by 
rationalizing it, the system of inter- 
national organizations which can play 
a decisive part in the building of a more 
just and more fraternal world order. 
Of course, any intergovernmental 
action of this kind is possible only 
if every citizen, every person feels 
personally concerned by development 
and takes it upon himself as a uni- 
versal task. In the developed 
countries particularly, it would be a 
good thing for all those holding posi- 
tions of responsibility to have had 
personal experience of the nature and 
methods of development, and indeed 
of service in its cause. The conver- 
sion of every individual to that work 
of universal salvation, development, is 
the great spiritual mutation which is 
essential for mankind today. 
Development, as | have said, is a 
state of mind. It is above all a matter 
of conscience. It was very necessary 
to remind the world of this.

“Kuboyama—and the Saga of the ‘Lucky Dragon’ (1) recounts the story of

over 2,500 miles to the east of Japan. 
They had pored over the carefully 
kept records of Japanese fishing boats 
and had been favorably impressed 
by the good catches of albacore, or 
“American tuna” as they called them 
in that area. They were reluctant to 
tell the crew, however, since they 
knew there would be strong objections 
to fishing in those notoriously stormy 
waters. 
According to custom, Captain Tsut- 
sui, Chief Engineer Yamamoto and 
Radioman Kuboyama should all have 
been consulted in selecting the fishing 
grounds. Kuboyama voiced angry 
doubts as to whether the Lucky Dra- 
gon was sturdy enough to withstand 
the battering that she might run into 
in storms around Midway. Yama-

moto expressed fears that his engine 
might break down, which in rough seas 
could be disastrous. Tsutsui objected 
too, but he could not overrule his fish- 
ing master. The real boss aboard a 
lapanese tuna boat is the fishing mas- 
ter. The Lucky Dragon continued on 
its course toward Midway. 
Long before dawn on February 7, 
some two hundred miles south-west 
of Midway, Misaki climbed to the 
bridge, rang the ship's bell, and order- 
ed the waiting deck hands: “Begin 
to throw out the linesl” 
The Lucky Dragon moved ahead at 
her top speed of seven knots. Work- 
ing under electric lights, the crewmen 
laboured to pay out the line fast 
enough. Other crewmen rapidly bait- 
ed big steel hooks with eight-inch-long 
frozen mackerel that had been stored 
in the hold since they sailed from 
Yaizu. A lighted buoy attached to 
one end of the long line went out first 
and then, after every three hundred 
yards of line, a green glass buoy with 
a bamboo pole and flag on it followed. 
After nineteen of the green buoys 
had been dropped, a second lighted 
buoy went down. Then more green 
buoys, another lighted buoy and so 
on. Almost four hours later the one 
long line was out, extending away from 
the Lucky Dragon about thirty miles. 
It hung in a series of festoons about 
two hundred feet below the surface, 
suspended by float lines from three 
On Friday, January 22, 1954, a 
Japanese fishing vessel, the 
“Lucky Dragon” set out from the 
small port of Yaizu to fish for 
tuna in the Pacific, over 2,500 
miles to the east of Japan. None 
of the fishermen suspected 
that a terrifying experience 
awaited them in the Pacific.

Kuboyama, radio 
operator on the “Lucky 
Dragon”, was the 
most popular and 
shrewdest member of 
the crew, 
hundred buoys. More than fifteen 
hundred baited hooks waited for pass- 
ing tuna with appetites. 
The crewmen ate their breakfast of 
rice, soup, and tea with savour, spe- 
culating on how the first throwing of 
the lines would come out. Four hours 
after the last buoy had been dumped 
over, they began to retrace their pre- 
vious course to haul in their catch. 
The fishermen watched the buoys 
with intense interest as they recovered 
their lines. The men worked thirteen 
hours, until after midnight, before the 
lines were all in. The catch totaled 
fifteen fish weighing altogether only 
a few hundred pounds. They had put 
out more than that in bait. The crew 
grumbled, blaming Misaki for bring- 
ing them to Midway rather than to the 
Solomons. 
Te following day winds 
caused a rough sea, so that lines could 
not be thrown. The day after that, long 
before daylight, the lines went out for 
the second time. Two hours before 
sundown it was discovered that the 
main line had parted. Had the lines 
become caught on coral that sometimes 
juts sharply toward the surface in these 
seas? Or had currents sucked the 
lines into entanglements on the ocean 
bottom itself? Whatever the explana- 
tion, the breaking of the main line was 
a disaster. The fishermen cursed 
their luck and, especially, they cursed 
Misaki for bringing them here. But 
their bitterness did not detract from 
the diligence of their search for the 
buoys that might mean recovery of 
the lines. 
The Lucky Dragon searched that 
night and the following two days, find- 
ing only a few buoys with short lengths 
of line attached. The day after that, 
Misaki gave up the search. With 
almost half his line lost, he called 
together the captain, chief engineer, 
radioman, boatswain, and chief deck- 
man to determine their course of 
action. They would of course continue 
fishing, for they still had enough line 
and fuel to make a respectable catch. 
"| believe we should go north,” 
Misaki said. “There are high-priced 
fish there.” 
“This old ship could not stand the 
rough seas of the north,” Kuboyama 
objected. 
“The main bearing of the engine has 
already burned out once,” Yamamoto 
said. “It would be very dangerous if 
this should happen again in a storm 
such as is common in the north.” 
The others sided with Kuboyama and 
Yamamoto, who proposed instead that 
they go south to the calmer seas of 
the Marshall Islands. There should 
be big-eyed tuna there, they argued. 
At length Misaki agreed. 
With its fortune running true, the 
Lucky Dragon turned south to avoid 
storms and quickly ran into a bad 
one. Engine trouble followed. But 
when clear skies finally did appear, 
the spirits of the crew rose and fishing 
was resumed. 
On March 1 a few minutes after 
three o'clock in the morning Misaki 
gave the order to start fishing. It 
was still dark when the throwing of 
the lines was completed two and a 
half hours later. Misaki ordered the 
engine cut, and the Lucky Dragon drift- 
ed silently in the sea. 
Some of the crew were sleeping; 
others were below deck preparing for 
breakfast. The few who were topside 
were suddenly amazed when a huge 
incandescence arose on the western 
horizon. Yellowish white light flash-

gunnery practice. 
KUBOYAMA (Continued) 
After running Into difficulties 
while fishing near the Midway 
Islands, the “Lucky Dragon” 
turns south to try its Tuck 
near the Marshall Islands. 
‘The sun rises in the West!’ 
the fishermen exclaim 
ed over the sea and against the clouds 
that partially covered the sky. The 
brilliance became a glaring yellow, and 
then a blazing orange. The fisher- 
man watched in awe. One of them 
rushed below and excitedly told his 
shipmates, “The sun rises in the 
west!” 
“What could this be?” the men 
asked each other frantically. Almost 
immediately it was suggested that 
they might have witnessed a pika-don 
—a compound word meaning “thunder- 
flash" that entered the Japanese lan- 
guage after the bombing of Hiroshima. 
“But if it's a pika-don." Kuboyama 
wondered, “where is the mushroom in 
the sky?” True, there was no mush- 
room, and soon the great light began 
to fade. Some of those who had been 
sleeping, like Captain Tsutsui, found 
that by the time they reached the deck 
pre-dawn darkness had returned. 
Just as the men were beginning to 
calm down, about seven minutes after 
the beginning of the flash, the Lucky 
Dragon was seized with a violent shak- 
ing. A few seconds later two reports 
that sounded like distant rifle shots 
were heard. The sailors threw them- 
selves to the deck and covered their 
heads. 
We quiet returned, the 
debate was resumed over the strange 
occurences. Some suggested that 
the U.S. Navy might be holding 
Others guessed 
again that they must have seen a 
pika-don. Shrewd Kuboyama made 
a simple calculation based on the 
difference in time between the sight- 
ing of the flash and the arrival of 
the sound wave that shook the Lucky 
Dragon. “We must be about 87 miles 
away from where the flash took place,” 
he said. Misaki consulted his charts. 
About 85 miles away, in the direction 
from which the light had come, lay 
Bikini Atoll. Whatever the flash was, 
it had come from Bikini. 
Since the long line was still out, a 
decision had to be made. Should it 
be cut so the Lucky Dragon could 
leave the area immediately? Many 
thought so. They were afraid that if 
there had been a bomb test an Ameri- 
can reconnaissance aircraft might spot 
them, and the crew watched the sky 
anxiously. They recalled that when a 
small Japanese fishing boat had disap- 
peared without trace in fair weather 
in 1952, it had been rumored that Ame- 
rican guns had sunk it. They felt sure 
that the Americans would not hesitate 
to provide a similar fate for the Lucky 
Dragon. 
Misaki consulted the officers; then 
he ordered the lines hauled in. The 
crew made haste to get the job done. 
After they had been working about 
two hours, a strange fog formed in 
the sky. Then a drizzle of very small 
whitish flakes began to fall on the 
Lucky Dragon. The fishermen brush- 
ed them out of their eyes, noses, 
mouths, hair. “It is a sandstorm at 
seal” exclaimed one. 
Kuboyama took off his straw hat to 
observe the ashlike particles. Could 
they be salt? He tasted a flake. It 
had no taste, nor did it have an odour. 
The radioman noted that the ash had 
become so thick on the deck that he 
left footprints as he walked. 
Leaning over his charts, Misaki con- 
sidered a sample of the ash. It had 
substance. It might be volcanic; it 
might be coral... He recalled the 
eruption of Krakatoa, which had spread 
cinders for thousands of miles around, 
But his charts showed no active volca- 
noes in the area. Captain Tsutsui, who 
was steering, suggested that if the 
morning's flash had been a pika-don, 
    in I 
f/ 
then it might be coral dust that was 
falling on them. Misaki's charts could 
not confirm this either. The Lucky 
Dragon was outside the restricted area 
that fishing boats were not supposed to 
enter. Eniwetok, which the Maritime 
Safety Board had warned them about, 
was three hundred miles to the west. 
Could the Americans have had a bomb 
test at Bikini instead? 
Some of the deckhands complained 
that the white dust hurt their eyes. 
Nevertheless, the work went ahead, 
and after six hours the line was all 
in. Only nine fish were caught, seven 
of them big-eyed tuna. These were 
cleaned on deck, with the white ash 
coming down on them steadily. 
Finally the flakes stopped falling. The 
Lucky Dragon headed north on its 
homeward journey. 
AW spray and breezes 
carried away most of the thin blanket 
of white ash that covered the main 
deck and other exposed surfaces. 
But the flakes clung in corners, in cre- 
vices of the deck and hull, in the wet 
lines, and in the rims of portholes. 
Most of the men took baths. Kuboya- 
ma, who remained uneasy about the 
mysterious dust, went below with the 
others to wash himself thoroughly. 
The men talked more of their poor 
catch than of the white dust. They 
would arrive in Yaizu when prices for 
fish were high, but they would have 
little to sell. This would mean hard 
times for their families, and this wor- 
ried them. 
Chief Engineer Yamamoto, who had 
been on deck during most of the driz- 
zle of ashes, had felt nausea at lunch 
time and had not eaten. In the en- 
gine room he had difficulty reading 
the dials. He ‘tbok a nap to restore

himself, but when he awoke he felt 
worse. His eyes were clogged with 
a sticky discharge, and the engine 
room dials were harder than ever to 
read. 
Other members of the crew had 
similar symptoms. At dinner time 
many of them complained of not being" 
hungry. To bolster their drooping mor- 
ale Kuboyama produced a bottle of 
sake that he had hoarded for a special 
treat. The men drank it, but it did not 
help. 
In succeeding days, the crew con- 
tinued to wonder about the “sand- 
storm”. they had Been at sea. One 
sailor gathered a sample of the dust 
in a plece of paper and gave it to 
Kuboyama. As he accepted it, the 
radioman admired its whiteness—"like 
the coral of an atoll"—and suggested 
that they must have it examined after 
their return to Yaizu. Kuboyama put 
  
    
  
    
the packet under his pillow, where he 
slept on it every night until they 
reached port. 
A variety of ailments befell the crew. 
At first they complained of itching 
skin, especially around the hands and 
neck. Their faces turned a leaden 
colour, darker than the robust hue of 
a tropical sun tan. There were com- 
plaints of fever, nausea, loss of appe- 
tite, general weakness, diarrhcea, scalp 
sores, and runny eyes. Yet none of 
the crew was confined to bed for the 
entire homeward voyage. 
The feeling grew that they had indeed 
seen a pika-don. Kuboyama read in 
one of his books about the bombing 
of Hiroshima to see if he could unco- 
ver a clue as to why there was so 
much illness among the crew. But at 
Hiroshima all the people injured had 
been within a few miles of the explo- 
sion. The Lucky Dragon was 85 miles

from Bikini on March 1, so how could 
there be a connexion? 
His last doubts vanished during a 
talk with Boatswain Kawashima. When 
Kawashima happened to scratch the 
side of his head, his hand came away 
with a tuft of black hair on it. “My hair 
is falling outl” he exclaimed. The 
sailors were amused. Kuboyama 
playfully snatched at Kawashima's 
head, and he too pulled off a wad of 
hair. Before long the clutches of his 
companions had shorn Kawashima of 
most of the hair on the left side of 
his head. 
Kuboyama soon found out that 
others of the crew also had falling 
hair. . Then he recalled that loss of 
hair was one of the symptoms of 
“atomic bomb disease” after the 
attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
He wondered if somehow the strange . 
ash had caused the men to be hurt 
by radioactivity. He sought out Mi- 
saki to discuss his thoughts. They 
agreed that the men should go to the 
hospital immediately after landing. 
0 N Sunday, March 14, after 
fifty-one days at sea, the Lucky Dragon 
drew into her home port of Yaizu. The 
owner, Nishikawa, and a few others 
were on the pier to meet her. Nishi- 
kawa was much more disturbed by the 
sickness of the crew than by the small 
catch and the loss of line. He was 
shocked by the muddy colour of their 
faces. 
Kuboyama did not follow his own 
advice. Instead of going to the hos- 
pital he first dropped off some wireless 
equipment at a friend's house and then 
he continued home. He held a towel 
around his face so that people would 
not stare at him because of his strange 
pigmentation. For the same reason he 
entered his own home by the back 
door. 
“Daddy's homel” called out one of 
his three daughters. As he embraced 
his wife and children, Miyako, his 
oldest daughter, said with surprise in 
her voice, “How black Daddy is. He 
looks like a Negro.” 
After a while the children went out-

### 17421: Kuboyama and the saga of the 'Lucky Dragon'

KUBOYAMA (Continued) 
At 3 a.m. on March 1, 
1964, the crew of the 
“Lucky Dragon” saw 
an immense fiery light 
on the western horizon. 
One man suggested it 
might be a “pika don” 
(thunderflash), as the 
Japanese call an atomic 
explosion. The ship 
was only 85 miles 
from Bikini Atoll. 
The port 
of 
‘crying fish’ 
side to play, and then Kuboyama told 
his wife about the atomic explosion 
they had seen and the white ash that 
had fallen on them. “Don’t worry,” 
he said, “I will be all right.” In a while 
he left, saying he was going to the 
doctor. But instead he returned to 
the Lucky Dragon, where he made 
some repairs to his wireless. 
Some of the crew did go to the hos- 
pital. The doctor, who did not have 
a Geiger counter, told the fishermen 
they had no serious trouble. But 
Misaki urged that two of the men be 
sent to Tokyo to see an expert on 
atomic sickness. The doctor in charge 
reluctantly agreed to write a letter of 
introduction to such an expert for 
them. 
The pair caught an early train the 
following day to Tokyo. In the hospi- 
tal the doctors were startled when they 
held a Geiger counter to one of the 
fishermen's heads; it clicked loudly, 
showing he was radioactive. They 
decided to go to Yaizu to see the rest 
of the fishermen. 
 
Since the small port of Yaizu did 
not have its own daily newspaper, it 
was two days before the Yomiuri 
Shimbun in Tokyo learned of the Lucky 
Dragon story and broke it in front-page 
banner headlines. It quickly spread 
around the world. Reporters and pho- 
tographers flocked to Yaizu. When 
scientists arrived they held their Gei- 
ger counters over the deck of the 
Lucky Dragon and were astounded at 
the fierce rattling sound. Fear struck 
the crew members when Geiger coun- 
ters held near their heads chattered 
ominously. Within a few days all 
twenty-three fishermen had been mov- 
ed to two hospitals in Tokyo. 
One scientist as soon as he read 
the story, took his Geiger counter to 
the marketplace at Osaka. He tested 
various tuna and found only normal 
radioactivity—about twenty counts per 
minute. But then he checked one from 
Yaizu that caused his Geiger counter 
to emit two thousand clicks per minute. 
It made such a noise that bystanders 
gasped. “The fish are crying!” From 
then on, the contaminated fish were 
known as “crying fish.” 
Since fish is a staple of the lapa- 
nese diet, the “crying fish” caused a 
panic in the markets of the country. 
Prices slumped as housewives refus- 
ed to buy fish. The Misaki market 
shut its doors on March 19; the Yoko- 
hama market was next; then the Tokyo 
Central Wholesale Market closed for 
the first time since the cholera epi- 
demic of 1935. Shopkeepers posted 
signs stating: OUR FISH ARE NOT 
RADIOACTIVE. Customers were not 
convinced. 
The attention of the nation focused 
on the twenty-three hospitalized 
fishermen. Their white cell counts fell 
alarmingly. The normal count is from 
five thousand to nine thousand cells 
per cubic millimeter. After several 
weeks the counts of the Lucky Dragon 
crew fell below four thousand; in two 
cases it went as low as eight hundred 
and a thousand. By May the men 
were also sterile.

### 17421: Kuboyama and the saga of the 'Lucky Dragon'

Toward the end of June more than 
two-thirds of the crew including Kubo- 
yama came down with jaundice. Ku- 
boyama’'s recovery was slower than 
the rest but by August 5 he felt well 
enough to be the crew's spokesman 
at a press conference. Then the 
radioman’s condition took a turn for 
the worse. On September 1 he told 
his wife, “It's no use any more. My 
sufferings are too great.” 
Kuboyama slipped into unconscious- 
ness, and was put on the critical list. 
He rallied several days later to the 
point where he could eat and recognize 
his friends. But on September 20 he 
was again in critical condition, although 
fully conscious. He said, “My body 
feels like it is being burned with elec- 
tricity. Under my body there must be 
a high tension wire.” 
The family again gathered at his bed- 
side. “I will get well,” he told his 
mother. “Promise me so,” she said, 
and he replied, “Yes, | will hold out.” 
: It was late in the afternoon of Septem- 
ber 23 when Kuboyama began his last 
fight for life. His family, his fellow 
fishermen and his doctor were with 
him as he fought. 
Shortly before seven o'clock that 
evening, the doctor examined Kuboya- 
ma with his stethoscope. He turned 
to the family and said quietly, “It is 
his last moment.” The doctor buried 
his face in his hands and sobbed. 
“Aikichi, you break your promise!” 
his mother cried. Kuboyama was silent. 
His eyes opened and his face stared 
  
vacantly. Kuboyama’'s wife touched a 
tiny cup of water-—the symbol of a last 
earthly drink—to his lips. Kuboya- 
ma was dead. 
Everyone present including the 
fishermen who had so loved him wept 
without restraint. The crowd that had 
gathered outside the hospital to pray 
for the fisherman was told of his death. 
Moments later the news was flashed 
by radio and television.” Throughout 
the night messages of sympathy 
including many from ships thousands 
of miles at sea, arrived at the hospital. 
The following day the American am- 
bassador sent a letter of condolence 
with a check for a million yen to 
Mrs. Kuboyama. 
Kuboyama’s body was cremated and 
his ashes placed in an urn. His widow, 
dressed in the traditional black 
kimono with the family crest, carried 
the urn in the funeral procession in 
Yaizu. His eldest daughter clutched 
a wooden mortuary tablet on which 
were inscribed the words, “The soul 
of the deceased Aikichi Kuboyama” 
while his second girl carried a photo- 
graph of her father. At the end of 
the ceremony two hundred university 
students sang “A-Bomb Never For- 
given” and a score of white pigeons 
were released in the air. Then the 
urn was placed in a marble vault in 
the mountainside above Kuboyama's 
native Yaizu where it remains today. 
Why did Kuboyama die? 
Fatalists will say that Kuboyama was 
on a collision course with death and 
All over Japan people waited 
anxiously for news of the 
23 crew members of the 
“Lucky Dragon” who had 
been hospitalized suffering 
from radiation poisoning.

On September 1, Kuboyama told his

sufferings are too great.” 
that there was nothing he could do 
about it. Is the world likewise on a 
collision course with death? Are we 
sailing our ships of state into waters 
upon which death will rain from the 
sky? There have always been wars 
and we have changed nothing so as to 
make war impossible; therefore it is 
logical that there should be a war. A 
war in which most or all of us will 
perish. 
Or can we reject fatalism and deter- 
mine our own destiny? Can we un- 
derstand the historical forces that 
threaten us and bend them to our will? 
Can we smash down these weapons 
that have grown too terrible for man 
to endure? Can we build a world 
order in which the hostilities among 
men and nations will be dealt with 
through law not force? Can men of 
all colours, religions, economic sys- 
tems and ideologies live together on 
this planet without engaging in mass 
murder? 
These are the questions that face 
us as a society and that face each of 
us as individuals. Are we as helpless 
before them as was Kuboyama? If the 
answer is Yes, then the radioman will 
have been the first of many millions of 
victims of the thermonuclear age. But 
if the answer is No, then we may be 
able to count him as the last victim.

THE MAN WITH THE ROSE. India's 
distinguished statesman, Jawaharlal Nehru 
(1889-1964) played a leading rolé in the 
work of the United Nations and in meetings 
between nations. The rose that he usually 
wore in his buttonhole remains a symbol 
of his faith in a universal humanism which 
inspired all his efforts for peace and 
for the accession of his country to modern 
life. “Man does ot live by politics alone,” 
he said at Unesco's General Conference at 
New Delhi, in 1956. Visiting Unesco in 
1962, two years befc: his death, Jjawa- 
harlal Nehru declared nat ‘ade * ih2 spirit 
of tolerance is nrore in ~ngsEiv Chan ever 
before. “Science and technology are ne- 
cessary,” he said, "but a spiritual back- 
ground no less so.” In September 1966, 
Unesco and the Government of India jointly 
organized a round table on the role of 
Jawaharlal Nehru in the modern world. 
Earlier this year a Nehru Memorial Exhibi- 
tion was held in Unesco House, Paris. On 
these pages we publish major passages 
from an address that Jawaharlal Nehru 
delivered at the inauguration of the Indian 
Council for Cultural Relations in New 
Delhl on April 9, 1950. 
Nirons individuals and

thing that people should try to 
understand one another and to learn 
from one another. Yet, when | look

another up the wrong way, though 
they know one another very thoroughly. 
Thus knowledge, by itself, does not 
lead to greater co-operation or friend- 
ship. 
This is not a new thing. Even the 
long pages of history show that. Has 
there been something wrong in indi- 
vidual nations or in the approach to 
this question? Or is it something else 
that has not worked as it should have 
done? When we talk of cultural rela- 
tions, the question that immediately 
arises in my mind is—what exactly is 
the “culture” that people talk so much 
about? 
When | was younger in years, | 
remember reading about German “kul- 
tur” and of the attempts of the German 
people to spread it by conquest and 
other means. There was a big war to 
spread this “kultur” and to resist it. 
Every country and every individual 
seems to have its peculiar idea of 
cultiire. 
When there is talk about cultural 
relations—although it is very good in 
theory—what actually happens is that 
those peculiar ideas come into conflict 
and instead of leading to friendship 
they lead to more estrangement. It is 
a basic question—what is culture? 
And | am certainly not competent to 
give you a definition of it because 
| have not found one. 
One can see each nation and each 
separate civilization developing its own 
culture that had its roots in generations 
hundreds and thousands of years ago. 
One sees these nations being intima- 
tely moulded by the impulse that

BY POLITICS ALONE 
  
initially starts a civilization going on 
its long path. That conception is 
affected by other conceptions and one 
sees action and interaction between 
these varying conceptions. 
There is, | suppose, no culture in the 
world which is absolutely pristine, 
pure and unaffected by any other 
culture. It simply cannot be, just as 
nobody can say that he belongs one 
hundred per cent to a particular racial 
type, because in the course of hun- 
dreds and thousands of years un- 
mistakable changes and mixtures have 
occurred. 
So culture is bound to get a liille 
mixed up, even though the basic 
element of a particular national culture 
remains dominant. If that kind of thing 
goes on peacefully, there is no harm 
in it. But it often leads to conflicts. 
It sometimes leads a group to fear 
that their culture is being overwhelmed 
by what they consider to be an outside 
or alien influence. Then they draw 
themselves into a shell which isolates 
them and prevents their thoughts and 
ideas going out. That is an unhealthy 
situation, because in any matter, and 
much more so in what might be called 
a cultural matter, stagnation is the 
worst possible thing. 
Culture, if it has any value, must 
have a certain depth. It must also 
have a certain dynamic character. 
After all, culture depends on a vast 
number of factors. If we leave out 
what might be called the basic mould 
that was given to it in the early stages 
of a nation's or a people's growth, it 
is affected by geography, by climate 
and by all kinds of other factors. The 
culture of Arabia is intimately governed 
by the geography and the deserts of 
Arabia because it grew up there, The 
culture of India is influenced obviously, 
as we see in our own literature, by 
the Himalayas, the forests and the 
great rivers of India among other 
things. It was a natural growth from 
the soil. 
Of the various domains of culture 
like architecture, music and literature 
any two may mix together, as they

often did, and produce a happy 
combination. But where there is an 
attempt to improve something or the 
other which does not naturally grow 
and mould itself without uprooting 
itself, conflict inevitably arises, Then 
also comes something which to my 
mind is basically opposed to all ideas 
of culture. And that is the isolation of 
the mind and the deliberate shutting 
up of the mind to other influences. 
My own view of India’s history is 
that we can almost measure the growth 
and the advance of India and the 
decline of India by relating them to 
periods when India had her mind open 
to the outside world and when she 
wanted to close it up. The more she 
closed it up, the more static she 
became. Life, whether of the in- 
dividual, group, nation or society, is 
essentially a dynamic, changing, 
growing thing. Whatever stops that 
dynamic growth also injures it and 
undermines it. 
We have had great religions and 
they have had an enormous effect on 
humanity. Yet, if | may say so with 
all respect and without meaning any 
ill to any person, those very religions, 
in the measure that they made the 
mind of man static, dogmatic and 
bigoted, have had, to my mind, an evil 
effect. The things they said may be 
good but when it is claimed that the 
last word has been said, society 
becomes static. 
The individual human being or race 
or nation must necessarily have a 
certain depth and certain roots some- 
where. They do not count for much 
unless they have roots in the past, 
which past is, after all, the accumu- 
lation of generations of experience and 
some type of wisdom. It is essential 
that you have that. Otherwise you 
become just pale copies of something 
which has no real meaning to you as 
an individual or as a group. 
On the other hand, one cannot live 
in roots alone. Even roots wither 
unless they come out in the sun and 
the free air. Only then can the roots 
give you sustenance. Only then can 
there be a branching out and a 
flowering. How, then, are you to 
balance these two essential factors? 
It is very difficult, because some 
people think a great deal about the 
flowers and the leaves on the 
branches, forgetting that they only 
flourish because there is a stout root 
to sustain them. Others think so 
much of the roots that no flowers or 
leaves or branches are left: there is 
only a thick stem somewhere. So, the 
question is how one is to achieve a 
balance. 
Does culture mean some inner 
growth in the man? Of course, it must. 
Does it mean the way he behaves to 
others? Certainly it must. Does it 
mean the capacity to understand the 
other person? | suppose so. Does it 
mean the capacity to make yourself 
understood by the other person? | 
suppose so. It means all that.

### IGNORE

  
project to build an international 
A city of peace and harmony for men 
and women of all countries, 
irrespective of creed, ideology or 
nationality is now being planned in India. 
Named Auroville, after the Indian spiri- 
tual leader and philosopher, Sri Auro- 
bindo, who died in 1950, it would be 
built near Pondicherry on the Bay of 
Bengal. Designed to house a community 
of 50,000 people, it would seek to 
foster the ideals and teachings by 
which Sri Aurobindo sought to con- 
tribute to international understanding 
and the promotion of peace. As shown 
in these photos of a model of the pro- 
~ ject, Auroville would be concentric in 
shape and its main streets, converging 
towards the heart of the city (above 
and left), would meet at a Park of 
Unity, in which a Sanctuary of Truth 
would dominate the city from a crown 
of gardens (right, rear of photo). Four 
zones—residential, international, cultural 
and industrial—would be built over the 
next 15 to 20 years. In the International 
Zone pavilions of all nations and of the 
Indian states would serve as embassies 
of the culture, arts and handicrafts of 
each country. In the zone designed 
to illustrate the cultural wealth of each 
civilization, Academies of Arts and 
Science would welcome artists and 
scientists from all parts of the world. 
The proposal to build Auroville was 
made in connexion with the commemo- 
ration of Unesco's 20th anniversary in 
1966 when the idea was applauded 
by Unesco's General Conference.

What is a scientific approach to life's problems? 
It is one of seeking truth 
by trial and error and experiment 
A person who cannot understand 
another's viewpoint is to that extent 
limited in mind and culture, because 
nobody, perhaps barring some very 
extraordinary human beings, can pre- 
sume to have the fullest knowledge 
and wisdom. The other party or the 
other group may also have some 
inkling of knowledge or wisdom or 
truth, and, if we shut our minds to 
that, then we not only deprive 
ourselves of it but we cultivate an 
attitude of mind which, | would say, is 
opposed to that of a cultured man. 
The cultured mind should have the 
capacity to understand another view- 
point fully even though it cannot always 
agree with it. The question of agree- 
ment or disagreement only arises when 
you understand a thing. Otherwise it 
is blind negation which is not a cul- 
tured approach to any question. 
| should like to use another word— 
science. What is a scientific approach 
to life's problems? | suppose it is 
one of examining everything, of 
seeking truth by trial and error and 
by experiment, of never saying that 
this must be so, but trying to 
understand why it is so and, if one 
is convinced of it, of accepting it, 
of having the capacity to change one's 
notions the moment some other proof 
is forthcoming, of having an open 
mind which tries to imbibe the truth 
wherever it is found, If that is culture, 
how far is it represented in the modern 
world and in the nations of today? 
Obviously, if it was represented more 
than it is, many of our problems, 
national and international, would be 
far easier to solve.

Almost every country in the world 
believes that it has some special 
dispensation from Providence, that it 
is of the chosen people or race and 
that others, whether they are good or 
bad, are somewhat inferior creatures. 
It is extraordinary how this kind of 
feeling persists in all nations of the 
East as well as of the West without 
exception. The nations of the East 
are strongly entrenched in their own 
ideas and convictions and sometimes 
in their own sense of superiority about 
certain matters. 
African village child. 
Anyhow, in the course of the last 
two or three hundred years, they have 
received many knocks on the head 
and they have been humiliated, they 
have been debased and they have 
been exploited. And so, in spite of 
their feeling that they were superior 
in many ways, they were forced to 
admit that they could be knocked about 
and exploited. To some extent, this 
brought a sense of realism to them. 
There was also an attempt to escape 
from reality by saying that it was said 
that we were not so advanced in 
material and technical things but that 
these were after all superficial things, 
but nevertheless, we were superior in 
essential things, in spiritual things, in 
moral values. | have no doubt that 
spiritual things and moral values are 
ultimately more important than other 
things, but the way one finds escape 
in the thought that one is spiritually 
superior, simply because one is inferior 
in a material and physical sense, is 
surprising. It does not follow by any 
means. It is an escape from facing 
up to the causes of one's degradation. 
Nationalism, of course, is a curious 
phenomenon which at a certain stage 
in a country's history gives life, growth, 
strength, and unity, but at the same 
time, it has a tendency to limit one, 
because one thinks of one’s country 
as something different from the rest 
of the world. The perspective changes 
and one is continuously thinking of 
one's own struggles and virtues and 
failings to the exclusion of other 
thoughts. 
The result is that the same nation- 
alism, which is the symbol of growth 
for a people, becomes a symbol! of the 
cessation of that growth in the mind. 
Nationalism, when it becomes success- 
ful, sometimes goes on spreading in 
an aggressive way and becomes a 
danger internationally. 
Whatever line of thought you follow, 
you arrive at the conclusion that some 
kind of balance must be found. Other- 
wise something that was good can turn 
into evil. Culture, which is essentially 
good, becomes not only static but 
aggressive and something that breeds 
conflict and hatred when looked at 
from a wrong point of view. How you 
are to find a balance | do not know. 
Apart from the political and economic 
problems of the age, perhaps, that 
is the greatest problem today, because 
behind it there is a tremendous conflict 
in the spirit of man and a tremendous 
search for something it cannot find. 
We turn to economic theories 
because they have an undoubted 
importance. It is folly to talk of culture 
or even of God when human beings 
starve and die. Before one can talk 
about anything else one must provide 
the normal essentials of life to human 
beings. That is where economics 
comes in. Human beings today are 
not in the mood to tolerate this 
suffering and starvation and inequality 
when they see that the burden is not 
equally shared, Others profit while 
they themselves only bear the burden. 
We have inevitably to deal with these 
problems in economic and other ways 
but | do think that behind it all there 
is a tremendous psychological problem 
in the minds of the people. It may 
be that some people think about it 
consciously and deliberately and 
others rather unconsciously and dimly, 
but that this conflict exists in the 
spirit of man today is certain. How 
it will be resolved | do not know. 
One thing that troubles me is this: 
people who understand one another 
more and more begin often enough to 
quarrel more and more. Nevertheless, 
it does not follow from this that we 
should not try to understand and that 
is something which really cannot be 
done in the context of the modern 
world. Therefore, it becomes essential 
that we try to understand one another 
in the right way, The right way is 
important. The right approach, the 
friendly approach, is important, be- 
cause a friendly approach brings a 
friendly response. 
| have not the shadow of a doubt 
that it is a fundamental rule of human 
life that, if the approach is good, the 
response is good. If the approach is 
bad, the response is likely to be bad, 
too. So, if we approach our fellow 
human beings or countries in a friendly 
way with our minds and hearts open 
and prepared to accept whatever good 
comes to them—and that does not 
mean surrendering something that we 
consider of essential value to truth or 
to our genius—then we shall be led 
not only towards understanding but 
the right type of understanding. 
So | shall leave you to determine 
what culture and wisdom really are. 
We grow in learning, in knowledge and 
in experience, till we have such an 
enormous accumulation of them that it 
becomes impossible to know exactly 
where we stand. We are over- 
whelmed by all this and, at the same 
time, somehow or other we have a 
feeling that all these put together do 
not necessarily represent a growth in 
the wisdom of the human race. 
| have a feeling that perhaps some 
people who did not have all the 
advantages of modern life and modern 
science were essentially wiser than 
most of us are. Whether or not we 
shall be able in later times to combine 
all this knowledge, scientific growth 
and betterment of the human species 
with true wisdom, | do not know. It 
is a race between various forces. 
| am reminded of the saying of a 
very wise man who was a famous 
Greek poet : 
What else is Wisdom ? What of man's 
[endeavour or 
God's high grace, so lovely and so 
[great ? 
To stand from fear set free, to breathe 
[and wait, 
To hold a hand uplifted over Hate, 
And shall not Loveliness be loved for 
[ever ? 
(from Euripides’ “Bacchae”).

TISTOU 
of the green fingers 
by Maurice Druon 
of the Académie Francaise Drawings by Jacqueline Duhéme 
In “Tistou of the Green Fingers”, the French author, Maurice Druon, 
has written a story for children and grown-ups alike of enchanting origin- 
ality. Tistou discovers that he has green fingers. Seeds blown by the 
wind, lying fallow in crannies and crevices blossom at his touch. Tistou 
uses his green thumbs in mysterious and astonishing ways—to abolish 
slums, make the animals in the zoo happy and cure the sick. In the 
passages we present below from this charming yet profound tale, Tistou 
uses his remarkable gift to put an end to war. 
|, sometimes happens that, 
when grown-ups raise their voices, 
little boys do not listen. 
"Do you hear what I'm saying, 
Tistou 7" 
And Tistou would nod his head, 
saying, " Yes, yes" in order to seem 
obedient, though he had not heard a 
single word. 
But as soon as grown-ups lower 
their voices and start talking secrets, 
little boys at once listen as hard as 
they can and try to understand what 
was not meant for their ears. All little 
boys are alike in this, and Tistou was 
no exception. 
For some days past, there had been 
a good deal of whispering in Bright- 
bourne. There were secrets in the air, 
the very carpets of the Shining House 
were redolent of them. 
Mr. Father and Mrs. Mother sighed 
deeply as they read the newspapers. 
Carolus, the manservant, and 
Mrs. Amelia, the cook, gossiped in 
undertones at the washing-machine. 
Even Mr. Turnbull seemed to have lost 
his trumpeting voice, 
  
MAURICE DRUON, the French novelist, 
was born in Paris in 1918. His numerous 
works include plays, essays and novels. 
His books have been translated into many 
languages. Among the best known are: 
“Les Grandes Familles™ ("The Curtain 
Falls", Hart-Davis, London, and Scribner, 
New York, 1959); “Les Rois Maudits” 
(“The Accursed Kings", a historical group 
of several volumes; Hart-Davis, London and 
Scribner, New York, 1956); “Les Mémoires 
de Zeus” (“The Memoirs of Zeus”, Hart- 
Davis, London and Scribner, New York, 
1964). “Tistou of the Green Fingers” has 
been translated into 11 languages. Mau- 
rice Drouon was elected to the Académie 
Francaise in 1966. 
  
“As they read the newspapers, 
Tistou caught words of ill omen: 
‘tension’... ‘crisis’... The next day 
another word was on everyone's 
lips: ‘war'.” 
Tistou caught words of ill-omen on 
the wing. 
" Tension...” said Mr. 
voice grave. 
“Crisis...” replied Mrs. Mother. 
" Worsening..." added Mr. Turnbull. 
Tistou thought they were talking of 
illness; he was very concerned and 
went off, his fingers at the ready, to 
find out which member of the house- 
hold could be ill. 
A turn in the garden proved to him 
that he was wrong: Whiskers was in 
perfect health, the thorough-bred 
roans were gambolling in the field, 
Gymnast showed every sign of being 
in perfect condition. 
But the next day another word was 
on everyone's lips. 
Father, his 
"War... it was inevitable,” said 
Mr. Father. 
"War... poor people!” said 
Mrs. Mother, sorrowfully shaking her 
head. 
"War... and there we arel Just 
another one," said Mr. Turnbull. "It 
only remains to be seen who'll win." 
"War... how terrible] Shall we 
never have done with them? "" groaned 
Mrs. Amelia, on the point of tears.

“War... war... always wars”, repeat- 
ed Carolus, the manservant. 
Tistou thought of war as something 
improper since people spoke about it 
with lowered voices, as something 
ugly, a grown-up disease worse than 
drunkenness, crueller than poverty, 
more dangerous than crime. Mr. 
Turnbull had already mentioned war 
to him and shown him the Bright- 
bourne War Memorial. But since 
Mr. Turnbull had spoken rather loudly, 
Tistou had not properly understood 
him. 
Tistou was not afraid. There was 
nothing of the coward about the boy; 
in certain respects he might indeed 
have been thought rash. You have 
already seen how he used to slide 
down the banisters. When he went 
to the river to bathe, he had to be 
stopped diving off the champions’ high 
dive ten times in succession. He would 
take a run and launch himself into 
the air, his arms widespread, in a 
swallowdive. 
But his idea of war had nothing 
to do with courage or fear. He 
merely found the idea intolerable, that 
was all. 
He wanted information. Was war 
really as horrible as he imagined it 
to be? Obviously, the first person 
to consult was Whiskers. 
"1 hope I'm not interrupting you, 
Mr. Whiskers,” he said to the gard- 
ener, who was clipping a box hedge. 
Whiskers put down his shears. 
"Not at all, not at all, my boy." 
"Mr. Whiskers, tell me, what do 
you think about war?" 
The gardener looked surprised. 
." I'm against it," he replied, tugging 
at his whiskers,

“Have you actually seen gardens annihilated by war?”, 
asked Tistou, 
"Why are you against it?" 
" Because... because even a little, 
unimportant war can annihilate a very 
big garden.” 
" Annihilate, what does that mean?" 
"It means destroy, abolish, reduce 
to dust.” 
"Really? And have you actually 
seen gardens... annihilated by war, 
Mr. Whiskers 7" asked Tistou. 
it seemed barely credible. But the 
gardener was not joking. He stood 
with bent head, his thick white eye- 
brows contracted in a frown, twisting 
his whiskers in his fingers. 
"Yes, yes, I've seen it happen,” 
he replied. "I've seen a garden full 
of flowers die in two minutes. | saw 
the greenhouses smashed into a 
thousand pieces. So many bombs 
fell in that garden that it was no use 
ever thinking of cultivating it again. 
Even the earth was dead.” 
Tistou felt his throat contract. 
" And whose garden was it?" he 
asked. 
“It was mine,” said Whiskers, 
turning away to hide his grief, and 
picking up his shears. 
Tistou was silent for a moment. He 
was thinking. He was trying to imagine 
the garden about him destroyed as 
Whiskers's garden had been, the 
greenhouses broken and the earth

eyes. 
"Well, | shall go and tell everyone

must know. | shall tell Amelia and | 
shall tell Carolus..." 
" Oh, Carolus is worse off than | 
am. He lost his country." 
"His country ? He lost his country 
in a war? How is that possible 7?" 
"Well, it's what happened. His 
country has completely disappeared. 
He could never find it again. That's 
why he's here.” 
"1 was quite right in thinking that 
war is a horrible thing, if you can lose 
your country in it like you lose a hand- 
kerchief, " Tistou thought. 
"There's even worse than that,” 
Whiskers added. "You mentioned 
Amelia, the cook. Well, Amelia lost 
her son. Others have lost arms or 
legs, or their heads even.

It occurred to Tistou that war was 
the greatest and most horrible disor- 
der that could happen in the world, 
since everyone lost in it what they 
loved best. 
Everyone 
" What can be done to prevent its 
happening?..” he wondered. 
Mr. Turnbull must be against war, 
since he hates disorder so much. | 
shall talk to him about it to-morrow. ™ 
Mr. Turnbull was sitting behind his 
desk. He had recovered his trumpet- 
like voice and was shouting Into three 
telephones at the same time. It was 
clear that Mr. Turnbull was a very 
busy man. 
"It's always the same when a war 
breaks out somewhere in the world, " 
he said to Tistou. "Our work at 
Brightbourne is doubled at once.” 
And, indeed, Tistou had noticed that 
morning that the factory siren had 
blown for twice the usual length 
of time and that twice the usual 
number of workers had appeared. The 
nine chimneys were making so much 
smoke that the whole sky was 
darkened. 
"I'll come back when you're not so 
busy," said Tistou. 
" What did you want to ask me?” 
"| wanted to know where this war 
has broken out." 
Mr. Turnbull rose to his feet and 
led Tistou to an enormous globe of the 
world. He turned it round and placed 
his finger on the centre of it. 
"Do you see this desert?” he 
asked. "Well, it's there." 
Under Mr. Turnbull's finger Tistou 
saw a pink, lozenge-shaped expanse. 
" Why has the war happened there, 
Mr. Turnbull?" 
“It's not very difficult to under- 
stand.” 
When Mr Turnbull said something 
was not very difficult to understand,

TISTOU (Continued) 
  
Tistou's heart sank; it was generally 
very complicated indeed. But this 
time Tistou was determined to listen 
attentively. 
"Not at all difficult,” repeated 
Mr. Turnbull. “This desert belongs 
to nobody..." 
"To nobody," Tistou repeated to 
himself. 
" ...But on the right is the country 
of the Go-its, and on the left the 
country of the Get-outs.” 
" Go-its... Get-outs...” Tistou repeat- 
ed to himself once more; he was 
really being very attentive. 
*... Well, some time ago the Go-its 
announced that they wanted this 
desert ; the Get-outs replied that they 
wanted it too. The Go-its sent a 
telegram to the Get-outs telling them 
to go away. The Get-outs replied by 
radio that they forbade the Go-its to 
remain in occupation; so now their 
armies are on the march and when 
they meet there'll be a battle.” 
" What is there in that pink lozen- 
ge... | mean in that desert?” 
" Nothing at all. Stones..." 
" So they're just going to fight for 
stones 7" 
" They want to own what's under- 
neath.” 
"What's under the desert?” 
"Oil" 
"What do they want oil for?" 
"They want it so that the others 
can't have it. They want oil, because 
oil's an essential material for making 
tr 
war, 
Tistou had known that Mr. Turnbull's 
explanations would become very 
difficult to understand. 
He shut his eyes in order to think 
better. 
"If I've understood properly, the 
Go-its and the Get-outs are going to 
fight a war for oil because oil is an 
essential material for fighting wars.” 
He reopened his eyes. 
Tistou has a lesson in geography, 
followed by a lesson in business; 
the conflict between the Go-its and the 
Geft-outs spreads in an unforseen manner 
" Well, it's stupid,” he said. 
Mr. Turnbull's ears turned scarlet. 
"Do you want to get O for your 
lesson, Tistou?™ 
" No," replied Tistou, "but what | 
do want is that the Go-its and the 
Get-outs should not fight.” 
This proof of goodheartedness for 
the moment ameliorated Mr. Turnbull's 
anger. 
"Of course, of course,” he said, 
shrugging his shoulders. "No one 
wants war, ever. But it has always 
existed...” 
"What can | do?" wondered Tis- 
tou. "Put my fingers on the pink 
lozenge 7
"ls the desert far away?" he 
asked. 
" Half-way between here and the 
other side of the world.” 
" So the war can't spread as far as 
Brightbourne 7" 
“It's not impossible. Once a war's 
begun, one can never tell where it 
will end. The Go-its may call a Great 
“The armaments 
were being 
packed up with 
as much care as if 
they had been

Power to their assistance, the Get-outs 
ask help of another. And the two 
Great Powers will fight. It's what's 
called an extension of the conflict.” 
Tistou's head was positively buzzing. 
"Yes", he said to himself. "War's 
really like some appalling sort of 
couch-grass growing on the face of 
the globe. What plants can | use to 
fight it with?” 
"We'll now go to the factory,” 
said Mr. Turnbull. "You'll see it 
working to capacity ; it'll be an instruc- 
tive lesson for you.” 
He shouted some orders into his 
three telephones and then accompa- 
nied Tistou downstairs. 
Tistou was at first deafened by the 
noise. The steam-hammers were 
banging away with all their might, the 
machines were humming like a million 
spinning-tops, chains were clanging ; 
one had to shout to make oneself 
heard, even with a voice like Mr. Turn- 
bull's. 
Tistou was blinded by the fountains 
of sparks rising on all sides; molten

steel gushing down to the floor like 
huge burning brooks; the heat was 
appalling, the workmen seemed small 
and black against the huge back- 
ground of the factory. 
After the foundry, Tistou visited the 
burnishing, turning and fitting depart- 
ments, the departments where rifles, 
machine-guns, tanks and trucks were 
made, for Mr. Father's factory made 
everything required for making war in 
the way of arms and munitions. 
The following day was the day for 
despatching and the armaments were 
being packed up with as much care 
as if they been china. 
Finally, Mr. Turnbull showed Tistou 
two huge guns, as long as cathedral 
spires. They were as bright and 
gleaming as if they had been covered 
with butter. 
Suspended on chains, the guns 
moved slowly through the air; then 
they were lowered gently, gently, on to 
truck-trailers which were so long you 
couldn't see the end of them. 
"Those are the guns which have 
brought wealth to Brightbourne, Tis- 
tou," said Mr. Turnbull proudly. " With 
every shell they fire they can destroy 
four homes as big as yours”

impress Tistou with a similar pride. 
" 80," he thought, " each time one 
of these guns fires, there'll be four 
Tistous without a home, four Caroluses 
without a staircase, and four Amelias 
without a kitchen... Those must be 
the things by which people lose their 
gardens, their countries, their legs or 
members of their families... Well, 
really 1” 
And the hammers were pounding 
and the furnaces glowing white hot. 
" Whose side are you on, Mr. Turn- 
bull 7" Tistou asked, shouting at the 
top of his voice because of the 
appalling din. 
"What's that?" 
"| said: whose side are you on in 
this war?” 
"Oh, the Go-its,” Mr. 
shouted back. 
" And my father?” 
" He is, too.” 
"Why?" 
" Because they've been our loyal 
friends for a long while." 
"Of course,” thought Tistou, "if 
one's friends are attacked it's quite 
right to help them defend themselves." 
" So those guns are going to the 
Go-its 7" he went on. 
" Only the one on the right,” shout-

"How do you mean, for the Get- 
outs 7" cried Tistou indignantly. 
" Because they're good customers, 
too. ” 
So one Brightbourne gun would be 
firing against another Brightbourne 
gun, and a garden would be destroyed 
on each side

added. 
"Well, | think your business is

"What's that?” asked Mr. Turn- 
bull, lowering his head because the 
noise of the steam-hammers drowned 
Tistou's voice. 
"1 said that your business is hor- 
rible, because..." 
A terrific box on the ear stopped 
him short. The conflict between the 
Go-its and the Get-outs had been 
suddenly extended to Tistou's ear. 
"That's what war's likel You ask 
for an explanation, you give your opi-

a box on the earl! Supposing | made

with his eyes full of tears. That's 
it, holly in his trousers, or perhaps 
thistles... 1” 
He clasped his fingers together... 
And it was then that the idea, the 
great idea, came to him. 
The business lesson, as you can 
well imagine, same to an end there.

### 18848: Tistou of the green fingers

TISTOU (Continued) 
Surprising pieces of news 
follow hard upon each other 
reported him at once to Mr. Father. 
The latter was extremely disappointed. 
His Tistou, who was one day to suc- 
ceed him and become the master of 
Brightbourne, was really showing very 
little propensity for controlling so 
splendid a business. 
"| shall really have to talk to him 
very seriously,” said Mr. Father. 
" Where is he?” 
" He's gone to take refuge with the 
gardener, as usual, ” replied Mr. Turn- 
bull. 
"Very well, we'll see about that 
later. At the moment we must finish 
the packing.” 
Because of the urgent orders, the 
factory was working without stopping. 
All night long, the nine chimneys wore 
great, red, glowing crowns. 
But, that night, Mr. Father, who had 
not even taken time off to dine and 
was watching the work of the depart- 
ments from a little glass tower, was 
  
  
pleasantly surprised. Tistou had 
returned to the factory and was walk: 
ing slowly along the line of packing- 
cases containing rifles, then he 
climbed into the trucks, leaned over 
the engines and slipped in among the 
big guns. 
"Well done, Tistou,” Mr. Father 
said to himself. " The boy's trying to 
make up for his double O. Splendid! 
There's still some hope for him1"” 
And, indeed, .Tistou had never 
appeared so serious and so busy: 
His hair was standing straight 
up on end. He was continually put- 
ting his hand in his pocket and 
pulling out little pieces of paper. 
"It even looks as if he were taking 
notes," thought Mr. Father. "| hope 
he doesn't pinch his fingers among 
those machine-guns. He's a good boy 
when all's said and done, and quick 
to see when he's at fault.” 
There were surprises in store for 
Mr. Father. 
before | 
“Ivy, briony, bindweed, ampelopsis, knot-grass and dodder 
formed an inextricable skein about the guns.” 
Everyone knows that newspapers 
always talk of war in capital letters. 
These letters are kept in a special 
tray. And it was precisely before this 
capital-letter-tray that the editor of 
the Brightbourne Star, a well-known 
daily newspaper, was standing in 
some hesitation. 
The editor kept turning about, 
sighing and wiping his forehead, which 
is always a sign of emotion and per- 
plexity. The man was most disturbed. 
Sometimes he took out a big capi- 
tal letter, the kind that is kept for 
important victories; but immediately 
put it back again. Sometimes he took 
out a medium-sized capital letter, the 
kind that is kept for wars which are 
not going very well, for campaigns 
which show no signs of coming to an 
end, or for unexpected retreats. But 
this size of capital letter would not 
do either; he put it back in the 
cupboard. 
At one moment he seemed to have 
made up his mind to use very small 
capital letters, the kind that are used 
for announcements which put everyone 
in a bad temper, like sugar shortage 
or new tax on jam. But these would 
not do either. And the editor of the 
Brightbourne Star sighed all the more. 
He was really very disturbed indeed. 
He had to tell the inhabitants of 
Brightbourne, his faithful readers, a 
piece of news that was so unexpected, 
and so serious in its consequences, 
that he did not know how to set about 
it. The war between the Go-its and 
the Get-outs had miscarried. And how 
was one to admit to the public that 
a war could just stop like that, without 
a winning or a losing side, without an 
international conference, without 
anything at all? 
The poor editor would have loved 
to have been able to print right along 
the top of his first page some sensa- 
tional headline such as LIGHTNING 
GO-IT ADVANCE or HEAVY GET- 
OUT OFFENSIVE. 
But this was out of the question. 
The reports from the pink patch on 
the map were definite: the war had 
not taken place and the reason for its 
failure to do so cast doubts upon the 
quality of the arms delivered by 
the Brightbourne factory, upon Mr. 
Father's technical competence and 
that of this workshops and workers. 
In fact, a disaster had occured. 
Let us try, with the editor of the

### IGNORE

“A rain of foxgloves, bluebells and cornflowers had fallen on the Go-its positions 
and they had replied, inundating the Get-outs with buttercups, daisies, and cowslips. 
Peace between the Go-its and the Get-outs was concluded on the spot.” 
Brightbourne Star, to reconstruct these 
tragic events. 
Climbing, romping, clinging plants 
had taken root in the cases of arms| 
How had they got there ? Why? No 
one could explain. 
lvy, briony, bindweed, ampelopsis, 
knot-grass and dodder had formed 
an inextricable skein, matted with the 
glue of the black henbane about the 
machine-guns, sub-machine-guns and 
revolvers. 
Neither the Go-its nor the Get-outs 
had been able to unpack their cases. 
The correspondents, in their des- 
patches, emphasized the particularly 
harmful qualities of burdock, which 
had fastened itself by means of the 
little hooks upon its burs to the 
bayonets. What could be done with 
rifles that flowered, with bayonets that 
you couldn't poke and whose effi- 
ciency was completely destroyed by 
pretty bunches of flowers? They had 
to be thrown away. 
Equally useless were the magnificent 
trucks, which had been so conscien- 
tiously camouflaged with grey and 
yellow lines! Brambles, goose-grass 
and several varieties of nettles, the 
stinging variety in particular, were 
growing in abundance upon their seats. 
The drivers all got nettle rash, and 
were thus the only casualties in the 
war. White-coated nurses made these 
soldiers, whom cruel itchings preven- 
ted from sitting down, lie still while 
they applied warm compresses. 
And here must be recorded a really 
pitiful incident caused by balsam. That 
a modest wild flower should be able 
to create a panic among soldiers is 
perfectly comprehensible if you know 
that balsam has pods which explode 
at the slightest touch. 
The engines were all full of it. Bal- 
sam swarmed in the carburettors of 
the armoured cars, in the tanks of the 
motor-bicycles. At the first contact of 
the selfstarter, at the first kick at the 
starting-pedal, there was a growing, 
spreading sound of dull explosions 
which, if they did no harm, neverthe- 
less had a shattering effect on the 
morale of the troops. 
What of the tanks? Their turrets 
were blocked up. Eglantine mingled 
with gorse and herbbennet enclosed 
their mechanism in a mass of roots, 
clusters, stalks and thorny branches.

A rain of foxgloves, bluebells and

### 15422: Science and disarmament

a8 
SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued from page 21) 
Dr. Leo Szilard, Dr. Eugene Rabino- 
witch and others dealt with both the 
long-term and short-term problems 
which the new weapon would create. 
They urged, with Niels Bohr, that 
in the long term the prevention of an 
international race in nuclear arms 
should be the prime objective of post- 
war foreign policy, both for the United 
States and for all other powers. 
They urged that this objective would 
be easier to attain if, in the short 
term, the first bombs were used, not 
against targets such as Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, but in some unpopulated 
place where the Japanese generals 
could observe the stupendous power 
of the new weapons, but where no 
human casualties would be caused. 
Szilard and Rabinowitch and others 
fought for this short-term objective 
with passion. But not all their col- 
leagues were agreed. In the event, 
those who objected to the use of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the targets 
were over-ruled by the President and 
the Secretary of State, in whose hands 
the final decision lay. 
But when the bombs were used in 
August 1945, the holocausts In the two 
doomed cities convinced almost every- 
one throughout the world that Niels 
Bohr was right—all nuclear weapons 
must be abolished under international 
control. On the initiative of the British 
Prime Minister, Mr. (now Earl) Attlee, 
the General Assembly of the United 
Nations set up a United Nations Ato- 
mic Energy Commission (UNAEC), and 
charged this commission with the task 
of drafting the necessary treaty. 
At its first meeting, the United 
States Government proposed the basic 
principles on which a treaty might be 
made. This proposal was put forward 
by the United States delegate, Mr. 
Bernard Baruch, and has always since 
been known as the “Baruch Plan”. 
In fact, it was the work of Dr. Robert 
J. Oppenheimer, who had been the lea- 
der of the team that made the first 
atomic bomb. 
It may be doubted whether the plan 
in its original form would have been 
adopted or proved workable; it propos- 
ed an International Atomic Energy 
Authority, which would own and ope- 
rate all the world's nuclear plants. 
At the time, however, most scientists 
believed that something on these lines 
was needed. The UNAEC adopted the 
Oppenheimer plan as the basis of its 
work, and for nearly three years many 
of the most eminent scientists (1) in the 
world debated every aspect of the pro- 
posal in the utmost detail. They showed 
a persevering devotion which proved 
their ardent desire to obtain a satisfac- 
tory result. Their final failure does 
not alter the fact that eminent scien- 
tists in government employ had made 
a bold effort to solve the problem 
their war-time work had created. 
Meanwhile, other scientists of the 
Manhattan District team, who had left 
government employ, were likewise 
working on the problem. Some of 
them, with Szilard and Rabinowitch in 
the lead, formed the United States 
Federation of Atomic Scientists. The 
constitution of the federation said: 
“The Federation of Atomic Scientists 
is founded to meet the increasingly 
apparent responsibility of scientists in 
promoting the welfare of mankind and 
the achievement of a stable world 
peace.” 
Other scientific bodies did parallel 
work on problems of the arms race. 
The Pugwash 
\Y; FeX¥Z=120 :11} ¢ 
TI oYe]g1) 
Also in 1945 the Bulletin of the Atom- 
ic Scientists was founded by Hyman 
Goldsmith and Eugene Rabinowitch. 
For twenty years it has done solid 
and brilliant work on armament prob- 
lems: it has mobilized the interest of 
scientists in disarmament, and has 
given them a platform for the serious 
discussion of the issues involved. 
But after the failure of the Oppen- 
heimer plan, many of the scientists in 
government employ came to accept the 
nuclear arms race as an inevitable fact 
of life. They concentrated their efforts 
on developing the fission-fusion, or 
hydrogen, bomb and on bringing out 
a large range of “tactical” nuclear 
weapons of all kinds. Some of them 
—Professor Isidor Rabi, Dr. Hans 
Bethe, Dr. Jerome Wiesner, Sir John 
Cockceroft—still preached the doctrine 
of controlled disarmament; others 
wrote and spoke against disarmament, 
and against a test ban. 
The latter category argued, first, that 
deterrence by nuclear weapons was 
the surest safeguard against aggres- 
sive war; and second, that nuclear 
war was feasible, and would not obli- 
terate mankind, nor even the comba- 
tant nations involved (2). 
It was in protest against this accep- 
tance of a nuclear arms race and 
against the conception that nuclear

took part In the work of the commission: 
Dr. R. Oppenheimer, Dr. Charles Thomas, 
Dr. J. B. Conant, Sir James Chadwick, Sir 
Charles Darwin, Sir George Thomson, Sir 
William Penney, Professor F. Joliot-Curie, 
Professor F. Perrin.

view In a recent book The Legacy of

war was feasible, that Dr. Albert Ein- 
stein and Bertrand (Earl) Russel made 
their famous declaration in 1955: 
“In the tragic situation which con- 
fronts humanity, we feel that scientists 
should assemble in conference to 
appraise the perils that have arisen as 
a result of the development of wea- 
pons of mass destruction, and to dis- 
cuss a resolution in the spirit of the 
appended draft... . 
" The general public, and even many 
in positions of authority, have not rea- 
lized what would be involved in a war 
with nuclear bombs. The general pub- 
lic still thinks in terms of the oblitera- 
tion of cities. It is understood that the 
new bombs are more powerful than 
the old, and that while one A-bomb 
could obliterate Hiroshima, one 
H-bomb could obliterate cities such as 
London, New York and Moscow. 
“No doubt in an H-bomb war great 
cities would be obliterated. But this 
is one of the minor disasters that would 
have to be faced... 
“No one knows how widely such 
lethal radioactive particles might be 
diffused, but the best authorities are 
unanimous in saying that a war with 
H-bombs might quite possibly put an 
end to the human race... Many 
warnings have been uttered by eminent 
men of science and by authorities in 
military strategy. None of them will 
say that the worst results are certain. 
What they do say is that these results 
are possible, and no one can be sure 
that they will not be realized... Here, 
then, is the problem which we present 
to you stark and dreadful and inesca- 
pable: Shall we put an end to the hu- 
man race; or shall mankind renounce 
war?” 
Impact on world opinion 
 
This Einstein-Russell appeal ended 
with a resolution urging the govern- 
ments of the world to find peaceful 
means of settling all the then-existing, 
and all future international disputes. 
It was signed by other famous scien- 
tists: Max Born, Percy Bridgman, Leo- 
pold Infeld, Joseph Miller, Linus Pau- 
ling, Joliot-Curie, Joseph Rotblat, Cecil 
Powell and Hideki Yukawa. It had an 
enormous impact on world opinion. 
Among other results, the manifesto 
led to the creation of the Pugwash 
Movement. The Pugwash Movement 
has been, and remains, the most 
important collective effort of scientists 
to arouse governments and people to 
the menace of nuclear war, and to the 
necessity for general controlled disar- 
mament as the only real long-term 
safeguard for mankind. (See article, 
Unesco Courier, Nov. 1964 - Editor.) 
The novel and vitally significant fea- 
ture of the Pugwash Movement is 
that it brings together the leading 
scientists from both Eastern and West- 
ern Europe. The first meeting was

### 15422: Science and disarmament

held in Pugwash, the birthplace and 
one of the homes of Mr. Cyrus Eaton, 
the Canadian-American millionaire, 
who paid for the journeys of the parti- 
cipants and who entertained them dur- 
ing their stay. Those who took part 
included leading men from the United 
States, the United Kingdom, France 
and other Western countries, together 
with prominent members of the Acade- 
my of Sciences of the Soviet Union, of 
Poland, and of other member states 
of the Warsaw Pact. 
The first conference was so success- 
ful that it has been followed by sixteen 
others, held in different countries. 
Each conference has made some new 
and significant contribution to general 
thinking about the armament problem. 
Pugwash studies of the need for, and 
the difficulties to be surmounted in, 
a test ban helped to advance govern- 
ment action. Mr. Gromyko’s proposal 
for a “minimum nuclear deterrent” 
(now usually referred to as nuclear 
“umbrella™) was based on a discussion 
at a Pugwash meeting. 
But the movement's greatest contri- 
bution was contained in the general 
declarations made at the major con- 
ferences held in Kitzbiihel and Vienna 
in 1958, and in London in 1962. 
‘The risk of local 
conflicts growing 
into major wars 
F-3 de To Je [(-T:] SH 
  
The Vienna Declaration is still 
regarded as the Pugwash “credo”. It 
said, in part: 
“We meet in Kitzbiihel and in Vien- 
na at a time when it has become evi- 
dent that the development of nuclear 
weapons makes it possible for man to 
destroy civilization and, indeed, him- 
self; the means of destruction are 
being made ever more efficient. 
“It is sometimes suggested that loca- 
lized wars, with limited objective, might 
still be fought without catastrophic 
consequences. History shows, how- 
ever that the risk of local conflicts 
growing into major wars is too great 
to be acceptable in the age of wea- 
pons of mass destruction. Mankind 
must therefore set itself the task of 
eliminating all wars, including local 
wars. 
“...if, in a future war, a substantial 
proportion of the nuclear weapons 
already manufactured were delivered 
against urban targets, most centres of 
civilization in the belligerent countries 
would be totally destroyed, and most 
of their populations killed. This would 
be true whether the bombs used deriv- 
ed most of their power from fusion 
reactions (so-called ‘clean’ bombs) or 
principally from fission reactions (so- 
called ‘dirty’ bombs). In addition to 
destroying major centres of population 
and industry, such bombs would also 
wreck the economy of the country 
attacked, through the destruction of 
vital- means of distribution and com- 
munication. 
“We believe that,-as scientists, we 
have an important contribution to make 
toward establishing trust and co-op- 
eration among nations. Science is, 
by long tradition, an international un- 
dertaking. 
“The ability of scientists all over the 
world to understand one another, and 
to work together, is an excellent ins- 
trument for bridging the gap between 
nations... 
“... education should stress impro- 
vement of all forms of human relations 
and should eliminate any glorification 
of war and violence.” 
At the London Conference in 1962, 
250 leading scientists from thirty-six 
countries took part. They unanimous- 
ly adopted a declaration which said, 
in part: 
“Our chief concern is to prevent 
war, and to relieve humanity of the 
fearful anxieties and the grave econo- 
mic burdens caused by the arms race. 
A general war with nuclear weapons 
would be a disaster of unimaginable 
magnitude. It would destroy a large 
fraction of the people now alive, and 
jeopardize the conditions of life of the 
survivors. 
“Throughout the world competition 
in armaments absorbs an. immense 
amount of talent and resources. This 
is wasted, because, so far from giving 
security, it increases the risk of 
war... 
“Disarmament and a stable peace 
are essential conditions for making a 
new society in which poverty could be 
abolished. The prospect of such a 
world is no longer Utopian. The tech- 
nical and scientific triumphs of our 
times have already far outstripped the 
boldest dreams of recent generations 
and knowledge increases ever more 
rapidly. 
“In our Conference we have there- 
fore concentrated attention on the 
complex problems of disarmament... 
The experience of our Conference 
leads us to believe that scientists have 
a special contribution to make to the 
solution of these problems... Scien- 
tists of all nations have a command- 
ing duty to help their fellow citizens 
to understand that war is obsolete, and 
what steps can ensure peace. They 
should, we believe, recognize their 
responsibilities to promote disarma- 
ment, and should invite Governments, 
learned societies and other institutions 
to support them in this task.” 
The London Conference ended its 
declaration with these notable words: 
“We are now at a stage in which gene- 
ral statements of principles are not 
enough; action is needed... 
“We re-assert our conviction that 
the goal of full disarmament and per- 
manent peace is realistic and urgent. 
This work is truly to be seen as part 
of a long struggle for the progress of 
mankind, and it is one in which scien- 
tists have a responsible part to play. 
We call upon scientists everywhere 
in the world to join with us In this 
task.” 
That the Pugwash Movement has 
been managed with wisdom and skill 
is proved by the fact that its influence 
with governments has steadily increas- 
ed, while its standing with the general 
public has improved. Many eminent 
men have contributed to its success: 
outstanding have been the services 
rendered by its Secretary-General, 
Professor Joseph Rotblat, of St. 
Bartholomew's Hospital, London.

CERI SL oT Ta IR d(T: 14, 
  
It would not be right to end this sec- 
tion without recalling the special con- 
tributions made by two individual 
scientists—contributions which are 
particularly relevant to the theme of 
this article. 
In 1958, Dr. Linus Pauling of the 
California Institute of Technology orga- 
nized a petition to the United Nations 
on the subject of nuclear tests. The 
petition urged that the “added amount 
of radiation” resulting from tests cons- 
tituted a danger to human health, and 
was liable to cause “an increase in 
the number of seriously defective chil- 
dren that will be born in future gen- 
erations.” 
It further argued that a test ban 
“could serve as a first step towards a 
more general disarmament” and the 
“ultimate effective abolition of nuclear 
weapons.” This petition was drafted 
by Dr. Pauling, together with a circular 
letter inviting scientists throughout the 
world to sign it. All the secretarial 
work was done by Dr. Pauling and 
his wife and all the postage and sta- 
tionery were paid for from his pri- 
vate purse. 
When the petition was presented a 
few weeks later to the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations, it bore 
the signatures of more than 11,000 
leading scientists from more than forty 
countries. They included thirty-six 
Nobel Prize winners, and thirty-five 
Fellows of the Royal Society. There 
is no doubt that the petition helped 
powerfully to persuade President 
Eisenhower to approve the Geneva 
negotiation which began in 1958, and

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
which ultimately resulted in the Mos- 
cow Test Ban of 1963 (1). 
The second individual contribution of 
which mention must be made is an 
article published in the United States 
journal Foreign Affairs, in January 
1962. 
The article is entitled “Judgement 
and Control In Modern Warfare”, and 
it was written by Sir Solly Zucker- 
man, who, ag already mentioned, was 
then, Chief Scientific,’ Adviser ‘In the 
British Midistry of Defence. Sir Solly 
ratsed the fundamental question whe- 
ther any. nuclear weapon, “tactical” or 
“strategic”, could be used in a- popu- 
lated area without disaster to all .con- 
cerned, including the troops that used 
it first. Discussing a British Army 
Exercise known as “Spearpoint”, 
which took place in October 1961, in 
Northern Germany, Sir Solly wrote: 
“In a war game involving just three 
NATO Corps, nuclear weapons were 
used against military targets only, in 
an area of 10,000 square miles which 
contained no large towns or cities. 
In this ‘battle’, lasting only a few days, 
it was assumed that the two sides 
together used a total of between 20 
and 25 megatons in not fewer than 
500 and not more than 1,000 strikes. 
It turned out that 3.5 million people 
would have had their homes destroyed 
if the weapons were air-burst, and 
1.5 million if ground-burst. In the 
former case, at least half the people 
concerned would have been fatally or 
seriously injured (i.e., 1.75 million). In 
the case of ground-burst weapons, all 
1.5 million would have been exposed 
to a lethal radiological hazard, and a 
further 5 million to serious danger from 
radiation” (2). 
The strange apathy 
of mankind 
to the threat of 
thermo-nuclear war 
  
Sir Solly goes on to point out that 
in a real land battle there would also 
be nuclear “interdiction” attacks out- 
side the area of local engagement, and 
that nuclear attacks would be made by 
both sides on distant airfields or mis- 
sile sites. All this, he argues, would 
create such chaos on the battlefield 
that it would be Iimpossible—as, 
indeed, it proved in “Spearpoint”—for 
the General Staff to keep control of 
what was happening or to pursue any 
intelligible military plan. 
But Sir Solly foresees a still graver 
peril. Stressing the danger, in the 
context of a NATO land battle, of “trip- 
wires which unwittingly set into opera- 
tion the whole panoply of strategic 
deterrence”, he continues: 
“Let us be quite clear about this. 
There are those in the West who 
already believe that the use of 
any nuclear weapons in a war involv- 
ing NATO would mean the opening of 
a third World War. There are indica- 
tions that the Soviet leaders believe 
the same thing. If this view is right, 
all freedom of choice may be-lost, and 
all possibility of exercising judgement 
and control in a future war between 
the great powers.” Cet 
Sir ‘Solly’s* argument leads him to 
the conclusion which has been quoted 
above, but which, in view of .its' cructal 
. importance; will bear repetition: 
“The very existence of nuclear’ 
weapons is thus the most urgent chal- 
lenge that has ever been presented to 
military judgement and control. As 
weapons to deter aggression, they 
serve a very precise purpose; the con- 
~ text of field warfare in: which they 
might be used is an entirely diffe- 
rent matter... One may fairly ask 
what meaning there is to the idea of 
using nuclear weapons ‘to defend our 
territories and peoples’. Qne can 
deter with nuclear weapons. Can one 
defend?” 
Sir Solly is here saying in polite lan- 
guage what Professor Rabi said more 
crudely in 1958 : “There is a dan- 
gerous misconception which is glossed 
over by the use of the word ‘tactical’ 
in reference to bombs of the explosive 
power of thousands of tons of TNT. 
Such bombs used in profusion would 
destroy the country which is the scene 
of a battle as completely as Hiroshima 
was destroyed... Although such 
bombs can be used tactically in war 
in a desert or at sea, or over very 
sparsely populated territory, the situa- 
tion is quite different in Western 
Europe or in some of the heavily 
populated countries on the borders of 
the Communist complex” (3). 
The evidence given in the last sec- 
tion shows that many scientists, both 
in government service and outside it, 
have made genuine and sustained 
efforts to bring home the dangers of 
the present arms race to their minis- 
terial and military chiefs, and to the 
public at large. Yet it is obvious that, 
so far, they have failed. 
On the last day of 1957, Professor 
Isidor Rabi said: “The facts about 
modern warfare have just not pene- 
trated; and that goes for the heads of 
governments, for otherwise they would 
ponder these facts every day as the 
daily number one problem” (4). ..... 
The average citizen has been even 
less concerned; his apathy and igno- 
rance are one of the strangest myste- 
ries in the history of democratic 
society. Writing five years after Rabi, 
Professor Warren E. Olsen said: “Des- 
pite statements by such diverse figu- 
res as Norman Cousins, Herman 
Kahn, Harrison Brown, and former 
President Eisenhower concerning the 
imminence of a third World War, the 
unspeakable toll of lives such a war 
would entail, and the probability of 
killing untold millions who have no 
part in the East-West quarrel, recent 
surveys indicate that few Americans 
are deeply troubled by the threat of 
a thermonuclear holocaust” (5). The 
same is probably true of almost every 
nation, except the Japanese.

movement of opinion 
  
Nor have the scientists made much 
progress in their efforts to persuade 
the governments to carry out disarma- 
ment, and to abolish war, 
These depressing facts do not mean 
that the Pugwash Movement should 
give up its work, or that other scien- 
tists are justified in regarding that 
work as useless or Utopian. On the 
contrary, the challenge of the London 
Pugwash Declaration quoted above is 
even more topical than it was in 1962: 
“Scientists of all nations have a 
commanding duty to help their fellow 
citizens to understand that war is obso- 
lete, and what steps can ensure 
peace. They should, we believe, rec- 
ognize their responsibilities to pro- 
mote disarmament, and should invite 
governments, learned societies and 
other institutions to support them in 
this task.” 
And again: “We re-assert our con- 
viction that the goal of full disarma- 
ment and permanent peace is realis- 
tic and urgent. This work is truly to 
be seen as part of a long struggle for 
the progress of mankind, and it is one 
in which scientists have a responsible 
part to play. We call upon scientists 
everywhere in the world to join with 
us in this task.” 
Today with wars and crises in vari- 
ous continents, the task is even more 
urgent than it was when the London

Declaration was written. But if there 
is to be any hope of practical success, 
the task must be undertaken on a far 
vaster scale, with far greater resour- 
ces, and with far more ambitious 
hopes, than have inspired the move- 
ments started since 1945. 
What is the task? 
It is to make the average citizen in 
every country understand the urgent 
danger in which he stands today; to 
persuade him that the armaments which 
create the danger must be abolished; 
and to evoke, to lead, and to organize 
his demand for swift and radical 
action. 
It is to rid the world of a threat to 
civilization even greater than that of 
Hitler's Nazism in 1939, and to do so 
by creating a tidal wave of informed 
opinion. It might be called: “Opera- 
tion Vox Populi: The Challenge of 
the Peoples to Militarism and Death.” 
The operation should be thought of as 
having no less urgency and impor- 
tance than the Manhattan District Pro- 
ject had in 1939. 
same claim on the services of scien- 
tists of the highest rank. 
It should have the 
The international committee. An 
international committee should be 
formed of men of world repute, some, 
if not all, of whom have themselves 
played a prominent part in military 
research, and in the application of 
scientific methods to the conduct of 
military operations in time of war. In 
other words, they should be men who 
will command the respect of their 
fellow scientists, of governments, of 
General Staffs, and of the public. 
The committee should be widely 
representative of nations from both 
Eastern and Western Europe. It 
should include, among others, repre- 
sentatives from the United States, the 
U.S.S.R., France, the United Kingdom, 
Italy, India, Japan, and if possible, 
China. 
The members of the committee 
would, of course, have to give their

whole time and energy to their su- 
premely important task. They should 
be given leave of absence from their 
normal employment, whether it be in 
government service, in the universities, 
in scientific institutes, or in industry. 
This leave of absence should be for 
one, two, or more years, as the suc- 
cessful conduct of the operation might 
require. Their posts should, of course, 
be kept open for them, whenever they 
desired to return. 
The committee should have the same 
freedom from financial restrictions as 
the scientists who worked in the Man- 
hattan District Project; it should have 
whatever sums of money it might judge 
to be required. It should have at its 
disposal whatever was needed in 
qualified scientific personnel, in ad- 
ministrative and secretarial manpower, 
and in other expert help. 
Before these practical aspects of 
the operation and its organization are 
discussed, it may be useful to set out

SCIENCE AND DISARMAMENT (Continued) 
of the message for which the opera- 
tion Is to mobilize support. 
The substance of the case. The fol- 
lowing are the main Issues on which 
world opinion requires a clear and 
decisive lead from scientists: 
1. The real nature of the present 
weapons of mass destruction— 
nuclear, chemical and biological— 
and the scale of the casualties and 
destruction which their use would 
involve. 
2. The question, raised by 
Professor Rabi and Sir Solly 
Zuckerman, whether any nuclear 
weapons, even of the smallest 
“tactical” category with which the 
armies are equipped, can be used 
without disaster—disaster both to 
the civil population of the area 
where the weapons are used, and 
to the armed forces which use 
them first. 
3. The probable future develop- 
ment of weapons of offence if the 
arms race goes on and military 
research continues to receive the 
vast resources now placed at its 
disposal. 
4. The possibility of active 
defence against the weapons of 
mass destruction, whether by anti- 
missile missiles, or in other ways. 
This should include a study of the 
cost of any possible system 
of active defence, its probable 
efficacy or inefficacy, and the risk 
of increased fall-out which it might 
involve, 
5. The possibility of passive, or 
“civil” defence against nuclear 
attack, by shelters, evacuation, etc. 
This should include a study of the 
cost of such passive defence, of 
its efficacy and its effect on the 
social standards and industrial 
efficiency of any country that made 
a serious attempt to carry it out. 
6. The danger of accidental or 
unintended nuclear war, whether as 
the result of mechanical failure in 
the systems of weapon control and 
command, or of human failure 
(mental breakdown) in the officers 
or ministers in charge of them. 
Warnings of the possibility of 
accidental war are often given in 
general terms; but glib statements 
of a reassuring nature are 
also often made, based on the 
infallibility of the “fail-safe” system, 
of the “permissive link", etc. The 
great complexity and cost of these 
safeguarding devices proves in 
itself how real is the danger of 
accident; and no one who under- 
stands the matter denies that it is 
possible that they may fail. This 
is a subject on which the peoples 
have been kept in almost total 
ignorance. But they have a right 
to know the risks they face; a 
detailed and authoritative state- 
ment is urgently required. 
7. The character of the new 
strategic jargon in current use in 
discussions of nuclear war. This 
should include a study of the 
psychological and political assump- 
tions (or fallacies) of most of the 
so-called “analyses” of nuclear 
strategy carried out by individual 
“experts” or by “institutes” or 
“corporations” of various Kinds, 
The study should examine the 
assertion made by expert govern- 
ment “consultants” that the NATO 
Command have approved a war- 
plan which accepts 200 “mega- 
deaths” (200 million dead), apart 
from the more numerous victims 
of fall-out. 
11 DECISIVE 
QUESTIONS 
  
8. A study of the so-called 
“technical” difficulties of con- 
ventional, nuclear, chemical and 
biological disarmament, with de- 
tailed technical proposals as to 
how these difficulties can be 
overcome in a general international 
treaty. This should include a 
study of the technical, political and 
psychological problems of inter- 
national inspection and control, 
and should suggest the detailed 
methods, of whatever kind, by 
which faithful observance of the 
obligations of the disarmament 
treaty can be reasonably ensured. 
lll-informed and tendentious debate 
has obscured the whole subject of 
inspection in a miasma of suspicion 
and doubt. 
9. A study of the short-term 
effects of general disarmament on 
the employment prospects of the 
50 million men and women now 
engaged throughout the world in 
national armed forces or in the 
manufacture of armaments. 
10. A forecast of the gain to 
human welfare if the brain power 
and resources now given to arma- 
ments and preparations for war 
were diverted instead to work for 
the betterment of health, for the 
promotion of intellectual and 
artistic achievement, and for the 
increase of usable wealth, 
11. An estimate of the gain to 
science, and therefore to humanity, 
if all present restrictions on inter- 
national scientific collaboration 
were removed by the disarmament 
treaty, and if all scientific research 
of every kind were open to the 
world. 
The four stages. There should be 
a memorandum (or book) on each of 
the eleven subjects specified above, 
and on any additional aspects of the 
armament problem which the interna- 
tional committee might judge to be 
required. 
The authors of each memorandum 
should be specialist scientists, whose 
authority on the subject with which 
they dealt would be unchallengeable. 
On each subject there should be co- 
authors from both Eastern and Western 
Europe. The authors would be cho- 
sen by the international committee and 
would work under the committee's 
general direction. 
Taken together, the memoranda 
would make a detailed and unanswer- 
able case for the conviction expressed 
by the participants in the Pugwash 
Conference of 1962: “The goal of 
full disarmament and permanent peace 
is realistic and urgent.” They would 
constitute a body of doctrine on which 
the whole operation would be based. 
The manifesto. When the prepara- 
tion of the memoranda was complete, 
the international committee would 
publish them and secure the widest 
possible distribution for them. 
The committee should then draw up 
a relatively brief manifesto, setting 
forth the main conclusions to be drawn 
from the memoranda. The manifesto 
would state succinctly the real dan- 
gers of the arms race; the urgent nec- 
essity of a world-wide disarmament 
treaty under international control; the 
conviction of the authors that a safe 
and practicable treaty could be speed- 
ily drawn up; and the benefits to 
all nations which such a treaty would 
bring. 
The committee should secure the 
signatures of eminent scientists for 
the manifesto—perhaps 100 leading 
men from each of the major countries, 
and a corresponding number from 
smaller countries. 
The manifesto would then be pub- 
lished with the great collective author- 
ity of these famous personalities be- 
hind it. 
The mass endorsement of scientists. 
The international committee would next 
endeavour to secure massive support 
for the manifesto from the scientists of 
all nations. Every man or woman with 
adequate scientific training (e.g., with 
a university degree in one or more 
scientific disciplines) should be invited 
to give his, or her, support. The pur- 
pose should be to attract the adhesion 
of as large a proportion as possible 
of the scientists of the world. A mil- 
lion signatures would not be too high 
a target.

### 15422: Science and disarmament

The world petition. The interna- 
tional committee would then proceed 
to organize the world expression of 
popular opinion, which it is the pur- 
pose of the operation to evoke. 
It cannot be doubted that, if the first 
three stages outlined above were sub- 
stantially successful, the greater part 
of the intellectual leaders of every 
country—writers, politicians, univer- 
sity professors, the teaching profes- 
sion, lawyers, doctors, etc.—would be 
aroused by the scientists’ warning 
about the dangers of the arms race, 
and would be ready to accept the 
drastic, world-wide, internationally ins- 
pected disarmament proposed. 
With the adhesion of these intellec- 
tual leaders, it should be possible to 
organize a world petition far greater 
and more comprehensive than any ever 
drawn up before. There would be no 
disposition among the ordinary citizens 
of any nation to challenge the authority 
of the scientists, or to reject their 
appeal. The signatories of the world 
petition, hundreds of millions of them, 
would pledge themselves to support 
their respective governments in any 
action which these governments might 
take to draw up and execute a treaty 
of general disarmament without delay. 
Towards a world 
petition with 
hundreds of millions 
of signatures 
  
Scientists’ aversion to manifestos. 
It has been suggested that the scien- 
tists of the world would be unwilling 
to adopt the plan proposed above be- 
cause they have a natural and a 
deeply ingrained aversion to mani- 
festos, and to other simplified exposi- 
tions of facts and arguments on which 
they may feel doubts or reservations. 
It is, of course, true that scientists, 
more than other men, desire exact 
precision, and that, faced with grave 
political or social issues, they may 
think it probable that there are refine- 
ments of argument that are not sus- 
ceptible of popular exposition. 
But the scientists who drew up the 
Vienna and London Pugwash Declara- 
tions felt no such doubts about the 
armament problem. They saw it as a 
naked choice between an intensifying 
arms race in nuclear, biological and 
chemical weapons, with constantly 
recurring crises, on the one hand; and 
peaceful co-existence based on disar- 
mament and world law, on the other. 
Without hesitation, they chose 
peaceful co-existence, disarmament 
and world law. What scientist need 
quibble about the niceties of the argu- 
ment, when it was Einstein who launch- 
ed the Pugwash Movement, and, with 
his dying breath, called on mankind to 
revolt against the use of nuclear 
weapons, and to abolish all armaments 
and war? 
Long-term education. Some people 
believe that general disarmament 
under international control would make 
such a revolutionary change in world 
affairs, and in the relations of nations, 
that all danger of war would disappear. 
Others consider that the risk of inter- 
national conflicts would remain, and 
that the ideas of militarist thinking 
might revive. 
Those who take the second view 
hold that education in all countries 
should be adapted to the changed 
conditions of a disarmed world. The 
Vienna Pugwash Declaration had most 
important things to say in support of 
this proposition. 
Dr. Peter Hodgson has graphically 
described what he thinks would be 
required: “What is needed is some 
continuing action that will steadily grow 
in importance. Education is the key. 
Is it not possible to arrange for all 
this to be taught in schools? Could 
not ‘Survival in the Nuclear Age’ re- 
place “The Wars of the Roses’ in Bri- 
tain's General Certificate of Education 
history syllabus? It could well be 
made a compulsory subject. Could 
not more international schools be 
founded to help the education of a 
new generation who will work and 
think in international terms? Could 
not Studentships and Fellowships 
and Colleges be founded to further 
continuing studies and work on the 
problem? This would ensure that the 
impetus and interest generated by 
‘Operation Vox Populi’ is not lost, but 
forms the basis of a continuing effort 
for lasting peace.” 
It may well be hoped that, if “Op- 
eration Vox Populi” succeeded, such 
a reform of education could be 
obtained... 
The whole of this article has been 
founded on the Vienna and London 
Pugwash Declarations which have 
been quoted above. Those declara- 
tions set forth the conviction of many 
most eminent scientists from many 
countries that the whole philosophy of 
power politics is out of date; that the 
arms race is a grotesque and very 
perilous anachronism; that in the nu- 
clear age, and with modern means of 
transport and communication, the vital 
interests of nations are not in conflict, 
but are common interests which they 
share and which they can only promote 
by common action. 
This article is an attempt to show 
how the new philosophy of the Pug- 
wash scientists might be made part of 
the accepted thinking of civilized 
mankind. It would require a supreme 
 
(1) Professor Max Born, Bulletin of the 
Atomic Scientists, April 1964, “Max Born 
is one of the founders of modern physics, 
and was awarded the Nobel Prize In 1554~, 
the Bulletin says. Professor Born worked on 
military research for Germany during the 
First World War,   
effort from scientists themselves; a 
massive acceptance of the Pugwash 
assertion that they have a “command- 
ing duty to help their fellow scientists 
to understand that war is obsolete”, 
and that, if they could be persuaded 
to “recognize their responsibilities to 
promote disarmament”, they might 
exercise a decisive influence on the 
course of history. 
But is there 
still enough 
time? 
Everything depends on whether the 
scientists are ready to undertake the 
task. They, and they alone, can rouse 
the nations from the “dogmatic sleep” 
which allows the arms race to go on. 
But they must recognize the revolu- 
tionary character of what they have to 
do. One of the most eminent of them, 
Professor Max Born, writing for fellow 
scientists, said not long ago: 
“Our hope is based on the union of 
two spiritual powers; the moral 
awareness of the unacceptability of a 
war degenerated to mass murder of 
the defenceless, and the rational know- 
ledge of the Incompatibility of techno- 
logical warfare with the survival of the 
human race. 
“The only question is whether we 
have enough time to let these realiza- 
tions become effective. For the pre- 
sent situation is highly unstable, and 
becomes, through its own mechanisms, 
increasingly dangerous day by day. 
The failure of an individual, or an appa- 
ratus, the blind passion of a leader, 
the ideological or national delusions 
of the masses can at any moment lead 
to a catastrophe... 
“All of us must fight against official 
lies and encroachments; against the 
assertions that there is protection from 
nuclear weapons through shelters 
and emergency regulations; against 
the suppression of those who enligh- 
ten the public about it; against narrow- 
minded nationalism, “gloire”, passion 
for great power; and we must espe- 
cially fight against those ideologies 
which pronounce the infaillibility of 
their doctrines and thus separate the 
world into irreconciliable camps. 
“There is still hope, but it will only 
come true if we stake everything on the 
battle against the diseases of our 
time.” (1). 
“If we stake everything!” 
“The only question is whether we have 
enough time.”

### 18950: UNESCO and the search for peace

b4 
UNESCO 
search for peace and the 
J rescors general con- 
cern with peace and disarmament is 
based on its Constitution, whose 
preamble affirms in its opening words: 
“That since wars begin in the minds 
of men, it is in the minds of men 
that the defences of peace must be 
constructed.” 
The preamble to the Constitution 
emphasizes the importance of promot- 
ing equality in the access to educa- 
tional, scientific and cultural facilities 
—a task implying close links between 
Unesco’s efforts and those of the 
United Nations in the cause of social 
and economic development. 
The Unesco Constitution, however, 
defines the relationship between so- 
cial and economic development and 
the promotion of peace by stating that 
peace cannot be based exclusively 
on political and economic arrange- 
ments between governments, but 
must be founded upon the intellectual 
and moral solidarity of mankind. This 
means that Unesco’s action for peace 
has to reach individual men and 
women. 
Unesco does not itself undertake 
professional research. Unesco’s scien- 
tific departments and services seek to 
promote and encourage research at 
the national, regional and international 
levels, and to facilitate scientific com- 
munication across political and cultu- 
ral borders. 
In its very earliest programmes 
Unesco devoted considerable atten- 
tion to a series of problems presented 
under the heading of “Study of 
International Tensions”, which soon 
expanded into research projects on 
international and intra-national social 
tensions. A large number of psycho- 
logical, sociological and economic 
studies were carried out within this 
framework from 1947 to 1956, of which 
the following are a few examples: 
— How Nations see each other, by 
William Buchanan and Hadley Can- 
tril: Urbana, University of Illinois 
Press, 1953." 
— In the minds of men, by Gardner 
Murphy; New York, Basic Book 
Service, 1953.* 
— Democracy in a world of tensions, 
by Richard McKeon; Stein Rokkan, 
ed.: Chicago, University of Chi- 
cago Press, 1951." 
— Tensions affecting international 
understanding, by O. Klineberg; 
New York, Social Science Research 
Council, 1950. * 
— Tensions that cause wars, by 
G. W. Allport, G. Freyre, G. Gur- 
vitch et al.; Hadley Cantril, ed; 
Urbana, University of lllinois Press, 
1950. * 
The older studies carried out under 
Unesco's programme are only partly 
relevant to present-day peace res- 
earch. More recent ones which come 
very close to peace research proper 
and therefore lead up to present 
preoccupations are: 
— International social science journal: 
of studies which began with a survey 
of the institutional framework within 
which scientific research on peace 
and disarmament at the international 
level is currently pursued in Unesco’s 
member states. 
It was this basic concern with 
institutional organization and the 
exchange of information on current 
research among the various national 
institutions that led to the compilation 
of an International Repertory of Insti- 
tutions specializing in research on 
peace and disarmament and to the 
Peace research, Vol. XVII, no. 3, 
1965. Compromise and the settle- 
ment of conflicts, Vol. XV, no. 2, 
1963. The social Sciences and 
peaceful co-operation, Vol. XII, 
no. 2, 1960. * (see page 67.) 
— International social science bulletin: 
Techniques of mediation and con- 
ciliation, Vol. X, no. 4, 1958. * 
launched a 
establishment of a new non-govern- 
mental organization, the “International 
Peace Research Association” (IPRA), 
whose “Newsletter” on current peace 
research is published with Unesco’s 
assistance. 
This Association has also recently

INSTITUTIONS FOR RESEARCH 
ON PEACE AND DISARMAMENT 
Seven international organizations are working exclusively on peace 
research: : 
B International Peace Research Association, Groningen, Netherlands. 
BW Peace Research Society, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. 
BW European Co-ordination Centre for Research and Documentation in the 
Social Sciences, Vienna, Austria. 
International Centre for Inter-Group Relations, Paris, France. 
International Institute for Peace, Vienna, Austria. 
Pugwash Conference for Science and World Affairs, London, U.K. 
World Federation for Mental Health, Geneva, Switzerland. 
A 
In December 1966, national institutions specializing in peace research or 
partly engaged in peace research numbered 73. They were distributed as 
follows: 
— 32 in North America (U.S.A. and Canada). 
— 39 in Europe (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Fed- 
eral Republic of Germany, Eastern Germany, Greece, Netherlands, 
Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, U.S.S.R., UK. Yugoslavia). 
— 1 in Asia (India). 
— 1 in Latin America (Mexico). 
The number of peace research institutions will undoubtedly increase as 
new peace research centres and sections, founded by universities or other 
institutions, expand and co-ordinate their resources and activities.

been commissioned to make an 
exhaustive study and an analysis of 
existing hypotheses on peace and 
disarmament. From the latter phase 
of this study it may be possible to 
establish a typology of such hypo- 
theses. The results of this study will 
be published. 
Interest in the institutional frame- 
work of peace research has also 
brought about further and closer co- 
operation between Unesco and the 
Pugwash Conference on Science and 
World Affairs. Two scientific studies 
are being carried out in close colla- 
boration with the Continuing Com- 
mittee of the Pugwash Conference, 
the first bearing on the legal and 
political aspects of intervention, and 
the second dealing with the problem 
of guarantees. 
Another study is a limited survey, 
based on public opinion data, of the 
image of a world in the process of 
disarmament (see page 5). 
Unesco activities relating to peace 
research will be further expanded in 
1967-1968. Among other studies, a 
critical appraisal will be made of the 
extent to which university courses in 
international law and international 
relations take into account the concept 
of living peacefully together. This 
study will be made by some ten 
countries with different social and 
political systems. 
A major event during Unesco's 
20th anniversary celebrations in Nov- 
ember 1966 was the round-table 
meeting at which a score of distin- 
guished international figures, including 
three Nobel Peace Prize winners 
(Lord Boyd Orr, Linus Pauling and 
Philip J.  Noel-Baker) appraised 
Unesco's contribution to peace. 
Appreciating “the valuable contribu- 
tion Unesco has made to peace in 
its first 20 years”, and considering 
present world problems (among 
others, the arms race, inequality of 
living standards, the population explo- 
sion...), the participants appealed to 
all peoples and all governments “to 
reject war once and for all as an 
instrument of their international poli- 
cy”. 
Unesco is to produce in 1967-1968 
a world anthology of writings desi- 
gned to strengthen peaceful relations 
between peoples. The first anthology 
will be devoted to the theme, “The 
Horrors of War” and will comprise 
passages from works by great writers, 
from letters and from accounts of eye- 
witnesses of war. Unesco National 
Commissions in member states have 
been asked to submit texts for inclu- 
sion in the anthology. 
The educational and scientific acti- 
vities of Unesco which, though not 
dealing specifically with peace and 
disarmament, nevertheless have a 
relatively direct and constant bearing 
on peace, are those connected with 
the implementation of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
This applies particularly to Article 2 
The cover of our 
November 1964 
issue devoted 
to the problems 
of disarmament. 
which 
proclaims that everyone is entitled to 
of the Universal Declaration, 
all the fundamental human rights 
“without distinction of any kind such 
as race, colour, sex, language, reli- 
gion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status”. 
Almost since its inception, Unesco 
has undertaken a wide range of edu- 
cational activities and scientific stud- 
ies whose aim has been to promote 
the extension of human rights. Scien- 
tific studies, for example, have been 
the basis for a number of basic decla- 
rations relating to problems of racial 
discrimination: 
— The race concept. Results of an 
inquiry; 2nd edition, Unesco, 1958. * 
This book gives a report of the dis- 
cussions which led to the adoption, 
by an international meeting of experts 
in 1951, of a declaration on the 
concept of race and racial differences. 
The General Conference of Unesco in 
1960 called for a revision of this 
declaration in the light of the most 
recent scientific knowledge. Two 
international meetings were convened 
in Moscow in 1964 and in Oxford in 
1965 to re-examine respectively the 
biological aspects of race and the 
social and cultural aspects of human 
rights. The conclusions of the first 
meeting were published under the 
heading Biological aspects of Race. 
in the International social science jour- 
nal (Vol. XVII, no. 1, 1965). 
Other studies dealing with different 
aspects of the race question include:

Among studies dealing with educa-

one of the most important was that 
UNITED NATIONS 
carried out, under the auspices of 
Unesco, by Cyril Bibby, entitled: 
— Race, prejudice and education; 
London, Heinemann, 1959. (9/6.) 
Unesco has actively promoted inter- 
national understanding through edu- 
cation. 
It has organized international semi- 
nars to study the most effective 
methods of developing such education 
in schools; it has been concerned with 
the production of specially designed 
teaching materials and aids; and it 
has collaborated with governments 
and professional associations for the 
improvement of school textbooks from 
the point of view -of international 
understanding. 
Among other examples are the 
recent experimental project for the 
international exchange of geography 
textbooks for revision and comment 
by experts, and a similar project for 
history textbooks now being planned. 
In addition experts are made available 
to governments (on request) and to 
Unesco-aided teacher training institu- 
tions. 
A notable instance of direct action 
by Unesco for the improvement of 
curricula and methods in this field of 
education is the programme known as 
the Associated Schools Project, which 
has now been in operation for more 
than ten years. 
It consists of a network of co-ordi-

nated pilot projects in schools in differ- 
ent countries (about 400 primary and 
secondary schools and teacher-training 
institutions in 50 countries). 
Its purpose is to test ideas on edu- 
cation for international understanding 
under differing circumstances and to 
exert a direct influence on education 
generally by developing knowledge of 
world affairs, of international co-op- 
eration in problems of world signifi- 
cance, of other cultures and ways of 
life, and of the principles of human 
rights, 
The project has influenced educa- 
tional practice outside its own area of 
application and has demonstrated that 
teaching for international understand- 
ing need not add to the load of school 
programmes but in fact may enrich the 
content and increase the impact of 
ordinary curricula. 
It has contributed to the develop- 
ment of methods and research and 
techniques of evaluation for such 
teaching and, by arousing the interest 
of educational authorities in the prob- 
lem, has paved the way for broad 
national programmes in this field. 
Unesco’'s continuing activities with 
adult education and youth organiza- 
tions and movements include conside- 
rable emphasis on the promotion of 
international understanding. The fol- 
lowing are a few examples: 
— Evaluation of the Major Project: 
The Major Project and school edu- 
cation; reprint of articles from 
Orient-Occident bulletins, Vol. VIII, 
Nos. 2 and 3, April and June 1965.

— Telling the UN story: new approa- 
ches to teaching about the United 
Nations and its related Agencies, 
by Leonard Kenworthy; Unesco, 
1963. ($2.00; 6/-.) 
Some of the studies on socio-eco- 
nomic development and technological 
change touch only incidentally upon 
problems of international tensions, 
conflict or danger of war, whereas 
others specifically refer to these prob- 
lems. Examples of the more direct 
approach are: 
— Social implications of the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, by Otto 
Klineberg, ed.; Unesco, 1964.
