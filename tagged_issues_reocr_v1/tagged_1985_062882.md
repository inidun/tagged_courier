The magic harp 
The legends of different countries and 
peoples have recently been recreated for a 
world television audience in a series of 26 
half-hour films made by the Canadian film 
company Via le Monde inc. The series, en- 
titled “‘Légendes du Monde’, is the fruit of 
an ambitious coproduction venture, the 
participants in which include the second 
channel of French TV, the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, and Unesco’s 
International Fund for the Promotion of 
Culture. Each film dramatizes a legend 
using actors from the country in which it 
is set. Photo is a still from “The Magic 
Harp’, a Venezuelan story which tells how 
young Felipe’s musicianship saves his 
father from financial ruin.

i The Courier 
A window open on the world 
Editorial February 1985 
. 38th year 
VER the past twenty years a quiet but profound revo- 
O lution has taken place in the world of libraries and 
archives. The first eddies of the wind of change were 
felt among the bookshelves with the irruption of the computer 
on the world scene. Its seemingly unlimited powers encouraged 
a flurry of wild speculation. Its arrival, it was said, heralded the 
era of the ‘paperless office’’, and there were those who did not 
hesitate to announce the imminent demise of the book. 
Today the computer has come of age. The menacing mystery 
has turned out to be a friendly servant whose ministrations af- 
fect every aspect of our daily lives. Far from killing off the 
book, it offers the possibility of easy access for all to the world’s 
libraries and archives and has itself become the subject matter 
of thousands of new books and periodicals. 
Other audio-visual technologies are playing their part too. In 
- particular, the simple cassette recorder is at this moment filling 
a key role in saving for posterity that other source of distilled 
wisdom, the oral tradition of many cultures of the Third World. 
In our enthusiasm for these new technologies and the im- 
mense possibilities they open up, we should not forget that 
behind the sleek machines lies the dedicated intellectual and 
planning effort both of brilliant individual men and women and 
of many non-governmental, national and international 
organizations. 
Among the latter Unesco can claim to play an irreplaceable 
role. Under its Major Programme VII, Information Systems 
and Access to Knowledge, it has been steadfastly pursuing four 
objectives which merit being quoted here extensively: 
(I) to develop standards, rules, methods, guiding principles and 
other normative tools for the processing and transfer of 
specialized information and the creation of compatible infor- 
mation systems; 
(II) to enable developing countries, individually or on a regional 
basis, to set up their own data bases and to have access to those 
now in existence throughout the world; 
(III) to promote the development of specialized regional infor- 
mation networks in co-operation with the appropriate interna- 
tional regional organizations; 
(IV) to contribute to the harmonious development of compati- 
ble international information services and systems among the 
organizations of the United Nations system. 
This issue of the Unesco Courier presents a far from ex- 
haustive account of some of the problems facing archives and 
libraries today. These problems are summed up in the words of 
American educator Ernest L. Boyer: ‘““Television extends 
human sight, computers extend memory and ability for calcula- 
tion. Books extend wisdom. It is now our task to fit together 
these tools, the new ones with the old.”” This is a task to which 
Unesco is firmly committed.

chival documents of their kind in the whole of central Europe.

### 62736: Libraries and archives for tomorrow

Libraries and archives 
for tomorrow 
  
across great distances but also by 
means of written and graphic 
records, is a distinctively human 
characteristic; and the creation, dissemina- 
tion, preservation and use of such records 
are uniquely human activities which have 
played a vital role in the development of 
T= ability to communicate, not only 
. human civilization. 
From earliest times organized collections 
of records have been made for different 
purposes. Libraries, as a rule, have brought 
together records from many different 
sources, for use particularly in research and 
study. Archives, on the other hand, have 
usually comprised collections of records 
associated with a particular institution—a 
commercial firm, a government depart- 
ment, an academic institution or an entire 
community—brought together as a record 
of its activities for administrative, legal or 
historical reasons. 
Broadly speaking, in many archives the 
emphasis has been on preservation, 
  
by J. Stephen Parker 
whereas, in libraries, greater emphasis has 
usually been placed on use. Although it is 
usually clear enough whether a particular 
institution is a library or an archive (in fact, 
many libraries contain collections of ar- 
chives and many archives maintain their 
own libraries), the theoretical distinction 
between them is by no means precise and 
both may equally well be defined as ““collec- 
tions of documentary or other records 
organized for use’. 
The present century has seen an increas- 
ing emphasis on the final word of this 
definition (‘‘use’’) and the development of 
ever more sophisticated and effective ways 
of organizing such collections, of providing 
guidance as to what they contain and of 
providing a variety of services to their users 
to help ensure that they are used to their 
maximum advantage. 
Documentation services, designed to pro- 
vide access to the contents of documents 
through indexes, abstracts and the like, and 
information services, intended to extract 
from documentary and other sources 
precisely those items of information re- 
quired by the user, have become increasing- 
ly important in recent years as the volume 
of documents being produced throughout 
the world has itself increased at an exponen- 
tial rate, as the needs of users have become 
ever -more sophisticated and as 
developments in information technology 
have made it possible to manipulate the vast 
amounts of information now being 
generated. 
To meet potential users’ vast range of 
needs, a wide variety of institutions and ser- 
vices have been developed. In recent years 
national, university, public, school and 
special libraries, mobile libraries and 
library services to the housebound and the 
hospital patient, specialized documentation 
and information services and archives in all 
fields have been established with increasing 
frequency. 
The traditional demand for the complete 
document is still being met, in many cases, 
by allowing it:to-be studied in a reference 
library ‘or reading room, or by making it

There have been suggestions that such

» tapes, laser discs, etc.—are themselves 
documentary records and thus are suscep- 
“tible to the techniques of organization and 
‘management which have been developed 
and employed in libraries and archives for 
many years. 
The new media also bring new problems 
for librarians and archivists. A record 
which is created and permanently stored in 
a computer may never have a hard copy 
capable of being preserved in a conven- 
tional archive. Indeed, some documents are 
specifically intended to be modified at will 
by certain groups of users and thus may 
never have, even in electronic format, an 
identifiable ‘‘master’’ or archival text 
which can be recognized as such for record

purposes. Even those which do have such a 
master text, particularly if they are in 
magnetic format, may create serious prob- 
lems of preservation and storage for 
archivists. 
Reference was made earlier to 
bibliographic databases which may contain 
references to documents published in 
almost any part of the world. One difficult 
and sensitive problem associated with the 
new information technology is the great 
and growing disparity between rich and 
poor countries, not only in terms of gaining 
access to such systems, but also in the extent 
to which information which they 
themselves have generated is made available 
through such systems. 
  
  
  
Not only are the vast majority of the 
computerized databases and databanks 
located in the richer countries of the in- 
dustrialized world, chiefly in Europe and 
North America, but an overwhelming pro- 
portion of the information they contain is 
generated in and relates to the interests of 
these same countries. 
Access to such databases from almost 
any part of the world where suitable 
telecommunications facilities exist is cer- . 
tainly possible, but it is often prohibitively 
expensive, not only in terms of the charges 
imposed by the information providers for 
the use of the databases, but also in 
telecommunications costs. Furthermore, 
the information obtained at such expense is 
often of only marginal relevance to the 
needs and problems of the developing 
world. 
This is not a new problem. Librarians in 
the developing countries have for many 
years been faced with a lack of adequate 
supplies of books and periodicals in local 
languages that are relevant to local needs. 
This raises the further problem of obtaining 
foreign exchange to buy the only available 
alternatives: expensive foreign books of 
little relevance to their users’ needs. 
The need for programmes of book 
development to help redress this imbalance 
has long been recognized and, in some 
countries significant progress has been 
made. The growing dominance of the new 
information technologies, exhibiting a 
similar bias towards the interests of the in- - 
dustrialized countries, suggests that the 
time has come to devise and implement 
similar programmes of information 
development which will help the developing 
countries to become more self-sufficient in 
this respect. 
Unesco has been concerned with these 
problems ever since its inception. Its ac- 
tivities in the fields of library and book 
development, often undertaken in col- 
laboration with other inter-governmental 
and non-governmental bodies, have played 
a major part, not only in drawing attention 
to these problems, but also, in some cases at 
least, in helping to solve them. 
Unesco supports, for example, the ef- 
forts of the International Federation of 
Library Associations and Institutions 
(IFLA) to develop worldwide programmes 
for Universal Bibliographic Control (UBC) 
and Universal Availability of Publications 
(UAP), whilst its own Records and Ar- 
chives Management Programme (RAMP), - 
which operates within the framework of the 
Unesco General Information Programme, 
is implemented in close collaboration with 
the International Council on Archives 
(ICA). 
Within the framework of its UNISIST 
programme (also part of the General Infor- 
mation Programme), Unesco has, since 
1971, been collaborating with the Interna- 
tional Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) 
and with other international bodies in at- 
tempting to lay the foundations for a world

scientific information system which would, 
among other things, help to ensure a more 
equitable distribution of scientific and 
technological information throughout the 
world. 
These efforts are now also being applied 
in support of the establishment of a global 
information network under the auspices of 
the United Nations itself, in accordance 
with the recommendations 'of the United 
Nations Conference on Science and 
Technology for Development (UNCSTD), 
held in Vienna in 1979. 
Despite the changes being brought about 
by the introduction of new information 
technology, there seems little doubt that 
libraries and archives will continue to be 
needed throughout the world in the 
foreseeable future. A well organized library 
is much more than just a source of informa- 
tion, and a well organized archive is not 
merely a repository of facts. The impor- 
tance of both types of institution lies in the 
fact that, in their different ways, they bring 
documents into physical juxtaposition, in 
an environment conducive to their study; 
this provides an opportunity not merely for 
the retrieval of known facts but also for 
seeking knowledge, inspiration and wisdom, 
as well as recreation and enlightenment. ll

Universal 
bibliographic 
control 
With the increasing growth of interna- 
tional exchange of information, it has 
become indispensable to harmonize na- 
tional bibliographic systems and to 
make them compatible. This is the 
main purpose of the Universal 
Bibliographic Control (UBC) pro- 
gramme, launched by the International 
Federation of Library Associations and 
Institutions (IFLA) and with which 
Unesco became associated in 1974. In 
the words of Giinther Pflug, Director- 
General of the Deutsche Bibliothek, 
Frankfurt (Fed. Rep. of Germany), the 
UBC “‘is intended to guarantee univer- 
sal information about literary produc- 
tion on a counftry-by-country basis. 
One of the most important tasks of this 
programme is undoubtedly to promote 
the creation of national bibliographies 
in those countries where they have not 
yet been introduced’’. The aim 
therefore is to strengthen national 
bibliographic control and to develop 
and bring into use international stan- 
dards and other normative tools. The 
programme’s essential practical aim is 
to prevent duplication of efforts in 
cataloguing and bibliographic 
recording. 
  
Founded in Munich in 1948 by Jeiia Lep- 
man, the international Youth Library is 
the only centrai iibrary in the world 
specializing In literature for children and 
young people. Since 1953 it has been an 
Associated Project of Unesco, and in 
1969 Unesco donated to it 28,000 books 
from the International Bureau of Educa- 
tion in Geneva. In 1982 its hoidings totall- 
ed some 380,000 volumes in over 120 
languages, and new acquisitions 
amounted to 15,000 each year. The 
Library has a historic coliection of 50,000 
books for chiidren and young people 
published before 1945. Left, an illustra- 
tion from the Library’s edition of The Life 
and Surprising Adventures of Robinson 
Crusoe, published in Amsterdam in 1721.

### 62737: Contested records: the legal status of national archives

Contested records 
The legal status of national archives 
 
RCHIVES are tools of government, 
A ndiensa for the management 
of a country’s affairs. In Europe 
this circumstance led as early as the seven- 
teenth century to the widespread adoption 
of a juridico-diplomatic practice whereby 
agreements made when there was a change 
of sovereignty over a given piece of territory 
(and such changes were frequent after wars 
or settlements between ruling houses) 
regularly made provision for the exchange 
or remittance of archives. Research in 1977 
produced a list, not claimed to be ex- 
haustive, of 157 agreements of this kind 
concluded since 1601. But this practice, 
however deeply entrenched it may have 
been, did not lead to the establishment of 
international standards for the cession and 
sharing of archives, and as a result the pro- 
vistons of different agreements vary to a 
startling extent. The only generally observ- 
ed practice was that the originals or copies 
of documents necessary for the conduct of 
routine affairs were handed over to the suc- 
cessor State. 
The absence of established doctrine had 
very serious consequences when the col- 
onial system was wound up. With few ex- 
ceptions, the achievement of independence 
by the former colonies did not give rise to 
agreements regarding the devolution of ar- 
chives. The measures taken by the colonial 
powers did not obey any single logic and 
ranged from the return of all documents to 
return on a selective, albeit massive, basis. 
Apart from certain countries such as 
Algeria or India which made known their 
claims immediately after independence, this 
de facto situation seemed to be implicitly 
accepted everywhere. Clearly this was an il- 
lusion, and it was inevitable that the ques- 
tion would be raised sooner or later at the 
international level since an essential part of 
the historical evidence relating to over a 
hundred countries was (and still is) outside 
their national frontiers. 
The matter was put before Unesco’s 
General Conference in 1974, and since at- 
titudes were firmly entrenched a prolonged 
controversy might have been feared. This 
was avoided thanks to Unesco’s insistence 
on drawing up, as rapidly as the complexity 
of the problem allowed, a document accep- 
table to all its Member States. Work carried 
out over a four-year period in collaboration 
with the International Council on Archives 
The first page of the law of 7 messldor 
year Il (25 June 1794) promulgated by the 
National Convention, the revolutionary 
assembly which founded the first French 
Republic In 1792. The law broke new 
ground In placing all the archives of a 
country under the control of a *‘central 
depository'’ and established free access 
to public archives for all citizens. 
by Charles Kecskemeti 
led to the development of an entirely new 
intellectual approach. 
A general typology was proposed, for ap- 
plication to the vast range of situations in 
which disputes involving archives could 
arise : 
— A change in sovereignty over a ter- 
ritory without the creation of a new State 
(territorial claims, although increasingly 
rare, still exist); 
  
— The transfer of archives during wars 
or as a consequence of military occupation; 
— The creation of new States as a result 
of the disintegration of existing political en- 
tities (Bangladesh is a recent example); 
— Situations created by decolonization, 
each calling for a specific approach: the 
return of archives to the metropolitan coun- 
try; the existence of archives of regional col- 
onial administrative services relating to

### 62737: Contested records: the legal status of national archives

During the Second World War, Warsaw, 
the capital of Poland, was 90 per cent 
destroyed by the Nazi occupation forces. 
When the city was rebuilt, archive 
documents provided essential Informa- 
tion, especially for the reconstruction of 
the old quarter. Right, 16th-century 
engraving of the city is taken from The 
Capitals of Europe, a guide to the sources 
for the history of their architecture and 
construction (7980), an international 
publication (bilingual: French and 
English) produced on the initiative of the 
International Council on Archives with 
the financial assistance of Unesco. 
p several independent States; the existence of 
archives created and preserved in the 
metropolitan countries, etc. 
With the same purpose of obtaining a 
consensus, certain concepts were for- 
mulated to enable the parties concerned in 
bilateral negotiations to ‘‘speak the same 
language’. Principles which were invalid 
because of their imprecision also had to be 
brushed aside. One of these was the notion 
of “‘territorial relevance’ which lent itself 
. to widely divergent interpretations and in 
the past gave rise to veritable ‘“massacres’’ 
of archives. The classic case of this was the 
dismemberment of documents, with dif- 
ferent pages going to different places 
depending on the information in them, car- 
ried out in accordance with the Treaty of 
Turin concluded in 1816 between Savoy and 
Geneva. 
It was also necessary to define a special 
status for holdings of archives which are of 
equal interest to countries with a shared 
history and which if dismembered would 
lose all value as sources of information. The 
formula adopted here was that of common 
heritage, with the physical conservation of 
archives being entrusted to one of the part- 
ners and the same rights of access and copy- 
ing being recognized for the others. 
Finally, Unesco rallied the international 
community in support of a key idea, of 
the need to undertake a task of historic im- 
portance: the reconstitution of archive 
heritages through the transfer of 
microfilms, 
This is a formidable challenge. Counting 
only the most fully stocked archives in eight 
former metropolitan countries (Belgium, 
The National Archives buiiding of 
Malaysla, Kuala Lumpur. it was built In 
1982 with Unesco ald, in accordance with 
the iatest standards. In order to provide 
the best possible conditions for the 
preservation of documents, a system of 
air conditioning maintains a constant 
temperature and humidity level, and the 
emission of ultra-violet rays by the 
fighting system has been reduced to a 
minimum.

Spain, the United States, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and the United 
Kingdom), the total number of photos to be 
taken probably amounts to somewhere in 
the region of 250 million, representing 
almost a century of uninterrupted work for 
twenty-five technicians. This does not of 
course include preliminary filing and inven- 
tory work which it would be pointless to try 
to calculate in terms of time and money. 
Without special resources, the systematic 
microfilming of archives for countries 
wishing to reconstitute their heritage is out 
of the question. At the rate at which routine 
operations are currently taking place, and 
the production capacities of archive 
laboratories rule out any acceleration, this 
task would take a thousand or two thou- 
sand years, perhaps more. This is not to be 
wondered at, for after all these documents 
are the result of work done by thousands of 
officials, officers, magistrates, lawyers and 
sailors during one, two or three centuries. 
Nevertheless, these figures and specula- 
tions about cost should neither cause alarm 
nor obscure the practical aspects of the 
problem. A vast microfilming programme

for the developing countries can be under- 
taken on three conditions: 
— that financial resources should be 
available over a long period to enable the 
archives involved to increase the productive 
capacity of their studios and workshops; 
— that action should be planned at the 
international level in order to use such pro- 
ductive capacity to the full; 
— that conditions for the reception of 
the microfilms should be the responsibility 
of the public record offices of the countries 
wishing to reconstitute their heritage by this 
means. 
The third millennium is at hand. It would 
be neither reasonable nor fitting to 
postpone to the twenty-first century a task 
which is perfectly feasible today. [|

### 62740: African archives and the oral tradition

African archives 
and the oral tradition 
OW important are archives for 
Africa? Do we not have more 
serious problems of malnutri- 
tion, ignorance, disease, political instabili- 
ty, and general underdevelopment? 
Let me answer the question indirectly. In 
one of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir 
Arthur Conan Doyle there is a reference to 
the dog that did not bark. The importance 
of the evidence was negative. If the dog on 
guard had not barked, the intruder must 
have been someone familiar to the dog. The 
dog’s silence was the devastating piece of 
evidence, the telling clue. 
My concern in this essay is with the 
historical importance of something equally 
negative—the comparative weakness of the 
archival tradition in Africa and its 
devastating consequences for the history of 
our people. Africa was silent about its 
history; the African archival dog did not 
bark at crucial moments. This had serious 
consequences for Africa’s place in interna- 
tional stratification. 
The archival] tradition may be defined, 
quite simply, as a cultural preoccupation 
with keeping records, a tradition of captur- 
ing the past through preserved documenta- 
tion. This means much more than 
establishing national archives; it means a 
particular propensity for recording the 
dates of births and marriages, collecting 
maps, preserving love letters, and keeping 
household accounts, as well as documen- 
ting treaties, contracts and the like. Because 
the archival tradition was weak in Africa, 
the scientific tradition became weak, our 
languages atrophied and so did philosoph- 
ical tradition—with ghastly consequences 
for our peoples across the centuries. 
Why was the archival tradition weak in 
Africa? Firstly because most indigenous 
African cultures refuse to regard the past as 
a bygone or the present as transient. The 
ancestors are still with us and we ourselves 
in Africa the cultural heritage Is largely 
sustalned by the oral tradition, which 
Unesco has systematically studied and 
encouraged In many ways. In Mall, in 
1983, the Organization jaunched a pilot 
rural ‘‘audiotheque’ experiment with 
several original features. The com- 
munities concerned are given coples of 
the recordings they make as well as 
equipment enabling them to listen in and 
make other recordings whenever they 
wish. Left, villagers of Mana listen to a 
recording. 
by Ali A. Magrui 
will be ancestors. If the present is not tran- 
sient why bother to record it? 
A related reason for the weakness of the 
archival tradition in African cultures is the 
weakness of the calendar tradition (in- 
cluding the tradition of the clock). Many of 
my fellow students in Mombasa, Kenya, in 
the 1940s did not know when they were 
born. The first president of my country, 
President Jomo Kenyatta, did not know 
when he was born. 
There is a Gregorian calendar, an Islamic 
calendar, an Indian calendar, a Chinese 
calendar—but no African calendar apart 
from the revised Orthodox Christian calen- 
dar of Ethiopia. 
The third reason for the weakness of the 
archival tradition in Africa is the weakness 
of the written word. Many African societies 
have only come to know the written word 
during the last century. 
This is not to say that Africa is uniform. 
Quite apart from other differences the con- 
tinent as a whole operates within a triple 
heritage of culture. This triple heritage con- 
sists of indigenous, Islamic and Western 
traditions. 
Modern archives are mainly Western in 
conception, and they are also Islamic to 
some extent. But can they be indigenized? 
Or are they inevitably part of the imported 
sections of Africa’s triple heritage? 
To the extent that archives until recently 
have been viewed almost entirely as collec- 
tions of written records, the indigenous 
aspects of the triple heritage have not been 
viewed as archival material. Muslim Africa 
has been better endowed with written 
records than non-Muslim indigenous 
Africa. These records in Islamic societies 
have sometimes been in the Arabic 
language, but they have also sometimes 
been in African languages using the Arabic 
script. 
But what is a document? Here we are 
mainly concerned with the written word. 
But there are five categories of documenta- 
tion in all: 
— Material documentation such as ar- 
chaeological evidence, from pottery to 
Great Zimbabwe, from skeletons to coins. 
— Written documentation: a mystical 
reverence for the symbols of literacy has 
conditioned our view of what constitutes ar- 
chival relevance itself. 
— Pictorial documentation, 
painting or carving on rocks. 
including 
— Sound documentation, which is in some 
ways the newest form of archival record. 
But the oldest form of documentation is 
the raw memory of man, a capacity to 
“recollect in tranquillity’’. 
Two concepts are useful in approaching 
the question of archives in Africa, the con- 
cept of documentary deficit and the concept 
of primordial surplus. Documentary deficit 
concerns an apparent excess of silence in 
African historiography, a shortage of 
recognized documentation in the written 
and material fields. 
Primordial surplus can take a variety of 
forms. Here I am particularly concerned 
with a surplus of allegiance to primordial 
identities, a commitment to ethnicity or 
religious sectarianism. 
The problem of documentation has af- 
fected Africa in two very complex ways. 
One is the crisis of documentary deficit in 
the material and written remains; the other 
is the crisis of primordial surplus in the area 
of raw human memory. The past is strongly 
with us, Materially, Africa has had relative- 
ly few stone monuments, few hard 
documents of the past. Great Zimbabwe is 
striking partly because of its very 
uniqueness. 
But the crisis of the documentary deficit 
also extends to the area of written remains. 
Among the great cultures of the world, 
African civilizations have had less written 
records than average. For a long time this 
literary deficit resulted in the assumption 
that Africa was a continent without history. 
Did this negative cultural image condemn 
Africans to centuries of marginality and 
servitude? Was the slave trade partly a case 
of cross-cultural images? Was colonialism 
partly a product of cultural perceptions of 
racial hierarchy? Did Africa’s documentary 
deficit sentence the continent to the lowest 
stratum in the ranking order of global 
privilege? 
Why did Europeans pick on Africans to 
enslave? Why did they not enslave Arabs or 
south Asians? Partly because the cultural 
distance between Europeans and Africans 
was deemed to be particularly wide. It was 
partly the absence of castles, cathedrals and 
written contracts in Africa which made the 
- civilizational gap appear so wide. 
Africa’s crisis of documentary deficit had 
a good deal to do with the origins of racism. 
Civilizations were often evaluated in terms 
of either concrete remains or writtenp

» records. Most of Black Africa seemed to 
have neither. 
The crisis of documentary deficit had 
related implications for science and 
philosophy. The: absence of the written 
word deprived much of Africa of the boun- 
ty of cumulative heresy. Africa’s oral tradi- 
tion was a tradition which tended to 
transmit consensus rather than dissent, 
what was agreed upon rather than what was 
rejected by the establishment. 
Where were Africa’s Platos and Lockes, 
Rousseaus and Lenins? Most of them lie in 
the graveyard of consensus, in the cemetery 
of the oral tradition. Brilliant Africans fail- 
ed to surface above village life, genius was 
too steeped in the oral non-literate legacy of 
rural Africa. 
Who would ever have heard of Karl Marx 
in the twentieth century if he had operated 
in a completely oral tradition in nineteenth- 
century Europe? The written word was 
needed to preserve Karl Marx’s heresies in 
his own formulation. 
But while the oral tradition is an illustra- 
tion of documentary deficit in material and 
written remains, it may also illustrate the 
dynamism of raw human memory in 
Africa. 
The question which arises in the twentieth 
century is whether that raw human memory 
is a case of surplus primordial documenta- 
tion! Is there too much raw documenta- 
tion? Are ordinary Africans remembering 
too much of their origins and their past? Is 
the past too present among us? Is the pre- 
sent refusing to be transient and 
temporary? 
In the second half of the twentieth cen- 
tury the most obstinate aspect of primordial 
surplus is the resilience of ethnic identity. 
The great majority of Africans refuse to 
forget their primordial origins, be they 
Baganda or Acholi, Luo or Kikuyu, Shona 
or Ndebele, Hausa, Yoruba or Ibo. The 
resilience of ethnic identity is a resilience of 
documentation at the level of raw human 
memory, for better or for worse. Ethnicity 
is an archive, stacked with documents of the 
annals of the ‘“‘tribe’’, the records of com- 
munity, the memory of collective identity. 
This situation has had repercussions in 
the post-colonial period. Surplus ethnic 
identity has outweighed deficit class con- 
sciousness in Africa. A Hausa peasant is a 
Hausa first and a peasant second when the 
political chips are down. 
Deficit class consciousness in Africa was 
compounded by deficit literary documenta- 
tion. Why is it that it is a socio-linguistic im- 
possibility for an African to be a 
sophisticated Marxist without being at the 
same time highly Westernized? One cannot 
be a sophisticated Marxist without exposure 
to the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and 
other ideological founding fathers. But 
these works are not available in African in- 
digenous languages (‘‘vernaculars’’). Ac- 
cess to sophisticated Marxism must 
therefore be through a sophisticated com- 
mand of a European language. A non- 
Westernized African Marxist is for the time 
being a contradiction in terms. 
In the origins of European socialism, 
history was used as evidence against the 
past. That is what Marx and Engels meant 
by viewing all events as an agony of class 
struggle. In contrast, some African 
socialists have tended to view history as 
evidence in favour of the past. Tradition 
has been seen as primordial collectivism, 
concern for the disadvantaged and univer- 
sal hospitality. 
European use of written archives resulted 
in a view of socialism as an interruption, 
sometimes as a drastic revolution, designed 
as a fundamental departure from the past. 
On the other hand, African socialism in 
some countries has emerged as a doctrine of 
continuity, a link with ancient life-styles. 
While European socialism has proclaim- 
ed a negation of the European past, African 
socialism has often proclaimed a reaffirma- 
tion of African ancestors. While Karl Marx 
"at the British Museum was using archives as 
allies in social revolution, African socialists 
later looked for archives to vindicate 
cultural revivalism. 
 
Zimbabwe: history on tape 
tradition is strong, when meetings are held to settle 
succession disputes and the affairs of the community, the 
successful claimants are often those who support their case with 
the fullest genealogical and historical details. In recent years 
such gatherings have attracted, in addition to those directly con- 
cerned with their outcome, observer-historians from the National 
Archives of Zimbabwe, which since 1977 has been carrying out 
a wide-ranging project for recording and preserving the coun- 
try’s oral history and traditions. The meetings not only often pro- 
vide a gold mine of information in themselves; they also put the 
historians who attend them on the track of prospective infor- 
mants who can be interviewed later on. 
The reasoning behind the Oral History Programme is that the 
oral traditions of pre-literate people serve the same purposes as 
| N rural Zimbabwe as in other African countries where the oral archives and museums in literate societies. The task of preserv- 
ing this material is all the more urgent since accelerating moder- 
nization is sweeping away traditional history and lore and many 
valuable reminiscences will be lost forever if they are not record- 
ed by the present generation. The Zimbabwe programme is be- 
ing carried out in the country’s three major languages, Shona, 
Ndebele and English. Historians tape free-ranging interviews in 
these languages with informants located in a variety of ways, in- 
cluding publicity given to the programme by the radio and the 
local press. The interviews are then transcribed, translated and 
edited by the historians before being catalogued and indexed by 
the librarian who makes the information available to the public. 
In this way a data bank of material has been assembled, ranging 
from genealogies, narratives, parables, stories, myths and 
legends, to songs, poems and ritual dialogue. [|

### 62740: African archives and the oral tradition

But it is not just ideology and philosophy 
which pose questions about continuity and 
change. Science also needs a built-in prin- 
ciple of instability—a readiness to be 
challenged by heresy. 
African science and technology were too 
stable, Major paradigm shifts were too 
rare. When it is too stable, science becomes 
stagnant. But was not African science 
unstable in another sense? Since it was 
taught through the oral tradition, was it not 
subject to variation from mouth to mouth? 
The answer is yes. Science passed through 
word of mouth is vulnerable; but this is the 
instability of imprecision rather than the in- 
stability of careful revision. 
Those African languages which were not 
written were also unstable. They changed 
too fast. It is harder to understand a 
nineteenth-century African poem even in 
Kiswahili than to understand a nineteenth- 
century English poem. Many Africans are 
more eager to learn the imperial European 
languages than to protect indigenous 
languages. Linguistic patriotism is weak 
partly because of the weakness of the ar- 
chival tradition, 
What then is the new archival order for 
Africa? In his Ode on Intimations of 
Immortality the English poet William 
Wordsworth talked about the child being 
father to the man. In the West the national 
archive was the child of the archival tradi- 
tion. The national archive was a conse- 
quence of a pre-existent cultural preoccupa- 
tion with record-keeping. In Africa the na- 
tional archive may have to father the ar- 
chival tradition or at least help that tradi- 
tion become strong. 
More than dusty documents are at stake. 
We must stop believing that the present is 
not temporary, that the past is still with us 
even if we do nothing to preserve its 
records. We must learn to keep accounts, 
record births, marriages and deaths, keep 
picture albums, and protect contracts. 
Perhaps above all, we need not only to 
respect intellectual heresies, but also to 
create a climate where they do not perish in- 
to unrecorded oblivion. A new archival 
order in Africa could help change the conti- 
nent fundamentally. And a world with a 
fundamentally different Africa cannot but 
be a fundamentally different world. [|

Far left, an anonymous caricature of the 
Guatemalan novelist and poet Miguel 
Angel Asturias, who was awarded the 
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967. Left, a 
manuscript page of El Arbol de la Cruz 
(‘‘The Tree of the Cross’’), an unfinished 
and unpublished text by Asturias who 
donated it with his other manuscripts to 
the Bibliothéque Nationale in Paris, to be 
used In establishing an International 
critical edition of his complete works. So 
far five titles have been published in the 
Asturias collection which is supported by 
Unesco's International Fund for the Pro- 
motion of Culture, 
 
malan writer Miguel Angel Asturias 
(1899 to 1974) donated his manu- 
scripts and archives to the French Biblio- 
théque Nationale with the twofold purpose 
of ensuring the physical preservation of his 
writings and making possible the establish- 
ment of an international critical edition of 
his complete works. Under the aegis of the 
Association of the Friends of Miguel Angel 
Asturias, whose secretary-general is the 
Italian literary specialist Amos Segala and 
whose international scientific council is 
headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor, several 
volumes of this critical edition have already 
appeared. 
With this experience behind them, the 
Association and its French and interna- 
tional partners have enlarged the scope of 
this initiative by establishing a new project, 
the Archives de la Littérature Latino- 
Américaine, des Caraibes et Africaine du 
XX Siécle. 
The objective of this international pro- 
ject is to ensure the preservation and 
dissemination of manuscripts of contem- 
S OME twelve years ago, the Guate- 
porary authors of Latin America, the 
Caribbean and Africa. A number of scien- 
tific institutions are collaborating in the 
project, including the French Centre Na- 
tional de la Recherche Scientifique, the 
Italian Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerce, 
the Spanish Consejo Superior de Investiga- 
ciones Scientificas, the Portuguese Instituto 
Nacional de Investigacio Cientifica and the 
National Libraries of Latin America and 
the Caribbean. 
Just as with the manuscripts donated by 
Asturias to the French Bibliothéque Na- 
tionale, the manuscripts of Latin 
American, Caribbean and African authors 
will be systematically catalogued before be- 
ing preserved and microfilmed, Students 
and researchers will have access to these 
document collections which will be as ex- 
haustive as possible. In addition, a team of 
specialists drawn from both the regional 
and international scientific communities 
will be entrusted with the task of 
establishing a new international collection - 
of critical editions of major works from all 
the countries of each of the regions concern- 
ed. The collection will thus contribute to an 
adjustment of the balance of critical assess- 
"ment of the literary history of these regions 
during the twentieth century and to a wider 
and more accurate inderstanding of their 
literature. 
From the start, this unprecedented, 
multilateral co-operative undertaking, en- 
compassing three continents, received sup- 
port from Unesco and, in particular, from 
the International Fund for the Promotion 
of Culture. It forms part of the wider move- 
ment for the safeguarding of the cultural 
heritage of mankind, laying emphasis on 
that vital but none the less vulnerable part 
of it, the manuscripts of modern authors, as 
defined at the World Conference on 
Cultural Policies (MONDIACULT) which 
was held in Mexico in 1982 and which is one 
of the major preoccupations of Unesco. 
Furthermore, the Archives de la Littérature 
Latino-Américaine, des Caraibes et Afri- 
caine, together with the Association of the 
Friends of Miguel Angel Asturias, con- 
stitute a Non-Governmental Organization 
with official consultative status vis-a-vis 
Unesco. 
The signing in Buenos Aires, in 
September 1984, of the Archives Agree- 
ment by four Latin American countries and 
Jour Latin countries of Europe marked the 
birth of the collection Archives de la Lit- 
térature Latino-Américaine du XXe¢ Siécle. 
We publish below extracts from a speech 
made on the occasion of the signing by 
Léopold Sédar Senghor, one of the most ac- 
tive promoters of this new *‘‘dialogue bet- 
ween cultures’.

### 62741: The 'Archives agreement': a modern approach to literary conservation and research

The ‘Archives Agreement’ 
A modern approach 
to literary conservation and research 
 
by Léopold Sédar Senghor 
countries—Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, 
France, Italy, Portugal and Spain—in a long-term 
programme such as the Archives Agreement is a very con- 
siderable achievement. 
Yet this alliance in a common cause was no chance occur- 
rence. At the Mondiacult Conference of 1982, judging by the 
welcome received by the proposals I made there on this sub- 
ject, a movement was born, a unanimous will to save from 
perdition, from the flames of a second Alexandria, the word 
that tells us and future generations the meaning and purpose 
of our existence. 
All at once, in this world of sound and fury, the word of 
the poet seemed alone and defenceless against the ravages of 
time and human malevolence. 
I must be confessed that to bring together eight 
The purpose of the Archives programme is, first, to 
safeguard a hitherto neglected part of our cultural 
heritage—the manuscripts of contemporary authors—and 
then to research them and to publish critical editions. It in- 
augurates new forms of scientific co-operation and cultural 
solidarity which, I am sure, will create a precedent that other - 
regions of the world will take as an example and adapt to 
meet their own specific requirements. The Archives Agree- 
ment comes at a critical moment, at a time when it is the 
general opinion that the revival of letters in our region is be- 
ing spearheaded by the poetry and narrative prose of Latin 
America and the Caribbean, which has its roots deep in the 
collective imagination of our peoples. 
Today is born a great literary collection, since it consists 
of over a hundred titles, from twenty-two countries of the 
region and in the four main languages spoken there. The key 
aspect, however, is that these texts will be treated with the 
consideration until now reserved for the great Latin and 
Greek classics. You will allow me, as a man of letters myself, 
to say how much I rejoice in this new respect accorded to our 
own writings, a respect which will be ensured by both the 
geographic and the disciplinary diversity of the groups of 
researchers (over five hundred specialists will be involved) 
associated with this initiative. 
Unaccustomed as they have always been to working 
together, and consequently to knowing and appreciating one 
another, despite a language, a history and a Weltanschauung 
which ought to bring them closer together rather than 
separate them, the Latin American countries are now em- 
barking, for a significant span of time, upon a series of ex-- 
changes, a sharing of literary experiences and of cultural 
messages which will be so many factors of integration, of real 
rapprochement, less spectacular perhaps than the declara- 
tions of politicians, but far more significant and effective.   
Another aspect of the Archives Agreement which seems to 
me to be of capital importance is the participation of the four 
Latin countries of Europe which, for reasons of con- 
sanguinity or history, are deeply and irreversibly bound to 
Latin America. Just as the Latin American countries involv- 
ed have, as it were, rejected their traditional nationalism in 
favour of a global, unifying vision of history and culture, so 
the Latin countries of Europe are collaborating in an act of 
solidarity towards a region with regard to which each of them 
had formulated individual policies and jealously maintained 
agreements, both covert and overt, often obtained at the ex- 
pense of their neighbours, 
+ Under the Agreement, the Latin countries of Europe are 
pledged to help each country of the region, by its own ef- 
forts, to rise above that level of communication, both inter- 
nal and external, below which it would be severely handicap- 
ped and prevented from taking its rightful place as a full 
member of the cultural community to which it belongs. 
The Archives Agreement means profound and practical 
innovation both in Latin America and in the Latin countries 
of Europe as well as in the interrelationships between them. 
As proof of this may I cite Portugal’s proposal to adopt the 
methodology and structures of the Archives collection in 
launching a collection of authors from the four Latin coun- 
tries of Europe concerned. This proposal brings a new 
equilibrium and a new and important dimension to the scope 
of the cultural dialogue envisaged. Since the proposal in- 
volves Fernando Pessoa, the greatest Portuguese poet of the 
twentieth century, it confirms the will and the opportunity of 
making the Archives Agreement the favoured instrument of 
a real cultural exchange across the Atlantic. 
Going further still, the delegates of the eight countries par- 
ty to the Archives Agreement, at my suggestion, are appeal- 
ing for a suitable technical and juridical instrument to be 
placed before the twenty-third General Conference of 
Unesco in which all aspects of the safeguard of and access to 
authors’ manuscripts as well as of their reproduction on 
microfilm and the publication of critical editions would be 
covered at national, regional and international levels. The 
fact that a document similar to that which we propose, but 
which was concerned with moving images, was adopted at 
the General Conference of Unesco held in Belgrade, in 1981, 
gives grounds for hope that a satisfactory solution will be 
found for the written word, as yet unprotected or assured of 
free communication by any convention. 
It is high time, before the bulk of these riches is lost to us, 
for an international debate to be engaged which would lay 
down the broad outlines of an objective policy of preserva- 
tion and exchange. HN

### 62742: UNESCO's library and archives

Unesco’s library 
and archives 
RGANIZATIONS like Unesco 
need a library “to give access 
to knowledge’ and to furnish the 
printed information necessary for the per- 
sonnel in their work. In fact, the Unesco 
central Library is the focal point of a 
house-wide network of sectoral documen- 
tation centres which together serve the 
programme specialists, and the 
secretariat units. : 
With 100,000 volumes kept up to date 
and 2,200 serials, including periodicals, 
the Library is in a position to answer any 
questions that may arise in the course of 
the work of Unesco. Under certain condi- 
tions the Library is also open to outside 
researchers. 
The Library, however, is not merely a 
collection of books; it is also a cataloguing 
and indexing unit for Unesco’s own 
documents and publications. The best 
and most detailed source of information 
on what Unesco issues is to be found in 
the Unesco List of Documents and 
Publications, a printed and computerized 
reference tool available in main libraries 
and documentation centres throughout 
the world and accessible on-line at 
Unesco headquarters. The data base now 
contains about 60,000 document 
references available for consultation in 
paper form and also on microfiches pro- 
duced by the Unesco Microfiche Service. 
A Systems Development Section main- 
tains and develops the computer software 
necessary for indexing. This programme, 
called Isis, is also available to Member 
States free of charge. 
The Library is an organized collection of 
books, while the Archives incorporate all 
the records created or received by the 
Organization in the course of its activities. 
Unesco’s archival documents are the 
natural and unavoidable result of its work. 
They comprise files, letters, memos, 
speeches, working and meeting 
documents, budgets, plans, programmes, 
agreements, photographs, tapes, etc., all 
reflecting faithfully the action taken in the 
execution of the Organization's pro- 
gramme. Unesco’s archival documents 
are open, according to the established 
rules, to researchers and students and all 
other interested persons can consult 
Unesco’s published documents in the Ar- 
chives reading room. n 
The services described above are the respon- 
sibility of the Unesco Library, Archives and 
Documentation Services, Programme Support 
Sector.

### 62743: The Riches of the Vatican library

The riches of the Vatican library 
IV on 15 June 1475 by the Bull Ad decorem militantis Ec- 
clesiae. By that date however the papal library already had 
a long history. It contained collections of ancient manuscripts 
assembled by earlier Popes following a tradition which began with 
Damasus in the fourth century and was continued by Boniface VIII 
(during whose pontificate the first catalogue was produced) and by 
its first real promoter, the humanist Pope Nicolas V who opened the 
Library to the public and left at his death over 1,500 manuscripts. 
In 1481 the Library possessed 3,500 manuscripts acquired by 
papal envoys throughout Europe. The contents of other works were 
recorded for posterity by a throng of copyists. The humanist preoc- 
cupations of this period, which were welcomed and encouraged by 
the Popes, not only included the holy scriptures, patrological and 
theological works, but also extended to secular texts: philosophy, 
literature (Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, Copt and Arabic), law, 
history, art, architecture and music. The Vatican Library still 
perpetuates this humanist tradition today. 
The heritage constituted by successive Popes has been enriched 
by the donation, acquisition or deposit of entire libraries. Some of 
the most important libraries in Europe thus came into the hands of 
the Vatican Library. Notable among them are the Palatine Library 
of Heidelberg (1622), the libraries of the dukes of Urbino (1657),

as holdings from churches and other Vatican institutions such as the . 
basilica of St. Peter and the Sistine Chapel. The Library also houses 
a store of archives whose riches are still unexplored. 
The holdings of the Vatican Library today total some 70,000 
manuscripts, 8,000 early printed books (incunabula), and a million 
printed works, They also include major collections of prints (over 
100,000), maps, handwritten documents (some 200,000), tens of 
thousands of archive documents, coins and medals, and even art 
objects of all kinds housed in the oldest part of the Vatican 
museums, which is under the supervision of the Library. 
The Vatican Library has. a restoration laboratory and a 
photographic laboratory. It publishes works and distributes them 
through its own bookshop. The Library is managed by a prefect 
(the scientific and administrative director) under the supervision of 
the Cardinal librarian. 
The Library is dedicated exclusively to research and access to it 
is limited to scholars and specialists. Each day it is used by an 
average of 120 readers, sometimes as many as 180. [|

### 62744: A Letter of credit drawn on the past

A letter of credit drawn 
on the past 
 
OLITICAL and cultural institu- 
P tions, as well as industrial enter- 
prises and banks often feel the need 
to look back to their origins, perhaps in 
order to find in their past history the 
dynamism they need to overcome the dif- 
ficulties of the present. This may account 
for the current widespread interest in 
business archives, which contain documen- 
tary evidence of the activities of a business 
enterprise since its foundation, Such ar- 
chives can help a business to become aware 
of roots which although ancient are still im- 
portant to it. 
The Monte dei Paschi bank of Siena is an 
example of this phenomenon. One of Italy’s 
leading credit establishments and the head 
of a major financial group of five banks, 
the Monte dei Paschi has had an eventful 
history that stretches back for five cen- 
turies, and is scrupulously recorded in its ar- 
chives which cover the period from 1568 to 
1872, 
Today preserved in the Palazzo della 
Roca Salimbeni in Siena, right next door to 
the headquarters of the bank, this major 
deposit occupies over 330 metres of shelf 
space. Also exhibited in the great salon of 
the Palazzo are precious objects connected 
with the life of the bank, ranging from seals 
(the oldest dating back to the 16th century),

letters of credit some of which were drawn 
up in the 17th century, and old letters of ex- 
change. Most of the post-1872 documents 
are preserved in other premises of the bank. 
Strangely enough, any account of the 
Monte dei Paschi archives must begin with 
documents which are preserved elsewhere, 
not because they have been scattered or 
destroyed, but because of the special cir- 
cumstances attending the bank’s creation. 
Founded in 1472 on the initiative of the Free 
Republic of Siena, it was considered initial- 
ly as an institution of the State, and its ac- 
tivities were strictly regulated. Consequent- 
ly bank documents dating from the period 
of Siena’s political autonomy until 1555 
were treated on a par with official 
municipal documents and later deposited 
with them in the local public record office. 
The public nature of the bank when it was 
founded and during the early years of its ac- 
tivity was confirmed when Siena lost its in- 
dependence, and the Medicis of Florence 
recognized the bank’s special status. Since 
then the bank has been closely involved in 
the country’s social and economic life. 
The activities of the period following the 
reform in status of 1568, whereby the bank 
obtained administrative autonomy, are ful- 
ly recorded in the documents preserved in 
its archives which run without a break from

1568 to the present and were enriched with 
the addition to the bank of a savings bank, 
founded in 1833, and a building finance 
house. 
- With the unification of Italy, one result 
of which was to extend the bank’s field of 
activity, a process of internal and external 
reorganization began. After the deposit of 
its statutes in 1872, its structure was 
modified and it was divided into several 
autonomous enterprises. 
Today the historic archives of the Monte 
dei Paschi have become an important in- 
stitution devoted to organizing a mass of 
documentary material which is of in- 
estimable value as a source of information 
for scholarly research into Italian economic 
history and whose quantity and diversity 
are constantly growing. |

### 62749: Grassroots of the pampas

 
Grassroots of the pampas 
 
come to the village, and I was his 
first patient. There were no fa- 
cilities for anaesthetics in the village then. I 
was ten years old and they put me in a chair 
opposite a hanging skeleton. The skull 
seemed to be smiling, and I smiled back at 
it. Then the lady who was helping the den- 
tist said to me, ‘So that you won’t be 
frightened, I’ll play the guitar for you while 
the doctor is working.*’” Seventy-five years 
later the heroine of this adventure was 
reminiscing into a tape-recorder and 
describing what may have been the first ap- 
pearance of dentistry and music therapy in 
Castelli, a village in the wet pampa of 
Argentina, where a regional museum and 
archive have recently been created. 
This region, which bordered on Indian 
territory until 1820, was inhabited by 
native-born Argentinians and immigrants, 
mostly Italians and Basques, who have 
always had a strong sense of their past and 
have withstood the impact of the modern 
world with greater firmness than other 
peoples in the region, As a consequence, the 
area was chosen by the Latin-American Ar- 
chives Association for a pilot project on the 
collection of data relating to its social 
history. The idea was to collect 
systematically all existing documentation in 
private hands, such as letters, account- 
books, school exercise books, photos, and 
films, as well as the kind of eyewitness ac- 
count quoted above. 
The National University of La Plata has 
also launched an archaeological research 
project in the same district and taken steps 
to create a museum there, based on the cer- 
tainty that many traces of more or less 
sedentary indigenous populations must sur- 
vive in this region rich in lagoons. In addi-

Photographs, post-cards, letters, oral 
testimony, all these are grist to the mill of 
the Museum and Regional Archive of 
Castelli, Argentina, In its effort to create a 
documentary record of the life of the 
region. in these two photos, now in the ar- 
chives, can be seen (above left) a local 
family, photographed In 1905, and (above 
right) a view of the village of Castelli at the 
beginning of the century. 
tion to archaeological specimens, the 
museum will collect and display objects 
relating to the farming and stock-breeding 
civilization which developed in the area 
following its occupation by populations of 
European origin, as well as examples of 
and plant life in the local 
environment. 
The execution of these projects, which 
were launched simultaneously in the middle 
of 1983, was immediately co-ordinated, 
although each retains its distinctive nature. 
This co-ordination led to the creation on 8 
August 1984 of the Castelli Regional 
Museum and Archive. It is not yet open to 
the public, but an inaugural exhibition has 
already been held there with marked 
Success. 
The written documents that have been 
assembled provide interesting evidence 
about the organization of social life at the 
beginning of the century, and about such 
matters as the cost of living and the way in 
which contracts were drawn up. A mass of 
photos vividly illustrate changing customs 
and ways of living, notably the change from 
traditional to modern dress, the evolution 
of housing from humble cottages to opulent 
estancias inspired by the manors and villas 
of Europe, the floods which periodically hit 
the region, and rural activities as they were 
before the mechanization of agriculture. 
Even more interesting are the eyewitness 
oral histories. Old villagers have been inter- 
viewed and have told racy anecdotes about 
the paternalistic relationship between the 
land-owners and their ‘““peons”’, and about 
the political rivalry between radicals and 
conservatives: ‘‘A long time ago, in the 
1920s,”’ said one, ‘‘the different parties 
were always accusing each other of electoral 
fraud. And so one day it was decided that 
elections would be strictly supervised and 
from then on the irregularities stopped. But 
the ballot-boxes had to be taken by train to 
the town of Dolores for the votes to be 
counted and once, when the train was 
winding its way along the banks of the 
lagoon of Sevigné those who thought they 
had lost the election threw the boxes into 
the water.” 
Both projects have been organized to en- 
courage the active participation of the 
villagers. Volunteers are given instruction 
by professional archivists, museologists and 
archaeologists and when they have been 
trained they are sent out to do fieldwork. In 
Castelli today young people can be seen go- 
ing from house to house in search of 
documents and museum objects, while 
other volunteers excavate on the banks of 
the Rio Salado. [|

### 62750: The Computer revolution in research libraries

The computer revolution 
in research libraries 
 
T= research library in the United 
States today is more than simply a 
vast reservoir of traditional books, 
journals and microforms; its role has ex- 
panded and been enhanced to support 
faculty and students in obtaining and utiliz- 
ing information resources. Furthermore, in 
order to cope with the physical growth of 
collections due to the vast increase in the 
number of publications, libraries on many 
college campuses have been dispersed and a 
network of library outlets created. Staff of 
the premier research libraries often number 
several hundred and the functions they per- 
form are vastly different from those carried 
out by their predecessors. 
The impact of computer technology on 
United States research libraries over the 
past decade has been little short of spec- 
tacular. In the past ten to fifteen years there 
has been a gradual evolution of the con- 
figuration, power and functions of these 
systems. Ushered in by the appearance of 
the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) 
computer network, the new technical 
capabilities enabled libraries to share a 
common data base in support of catalogu- 
ing operations. Without question the 
OCLC system revolutionized the work of 
technical services divisions of large 
libraries. OCLC grew rapidly throughout 
the 1970s until it now serves over 2,000 
public, academic and special libraries and 
the computer support system supports in 
excess of 6,000 terminals, 
A similar system developed by the 
Research Libraries Group, called the 
Research Libraries Information Network 
(RLIN), was designed specifically to sup- 
port the programmes of research libraries. 
Although the technology underlying OCLC 
and RLIN are fundamentally different, 
both systems are nationwide in scope and 
are configured in a manner network experts 
frequently refer to as ‘star networks’’, that

he was working with the Yale Library on 
the preparation of a new Bach 
compendium.

is, with a centralized computer ‘system 
which is linked to distant libraries via 
telecommunications. 
In addition to such networks as OCLC 
and RLIN, individual libraries such as those 
of Northwestern University, Stanford 
University and the University of Chicago, 
have developed local on-line technical sup- 
port systems (for example, systems to han- 
dle book purchasing, accounting, serials 
check-in, on-line cataloguing, etc). In the 
late 1970s, commercial vendors also began 
to make available ‘turn-key’ systems 
designed to support single operations such 
as circulation and acquisitions. 
Currently the provision of on-line 
catalogues to replace the venerable card 
catalogue is receiving the highest priority in 
most university libraries. Studies that have 
already been conducted by the Council on 
Library Resources, Inc. reflect how much 
more powerful the new catalogues are and 
every indication is that they will be en- 
thusiastically accepted by the next genera- 
tion of library users. 
In the next few years it will become com- 
mon for libraries to operate integrated 
library systems which will tie together all the 
traditional library support activities into a 
single computer system. An integrated 
library system will support the basic func- 
tions of circulation, acquisitions, accoun- 
ting, cataloguing of all materials, all aspects 
of serials work, binding and inter-library 
lending. 
Perhaps more importantly these library 
systems will be tied into campus networks 
   
so that users will be able to access the 
catalogues of neighbouring libraries. 
At present there is a nationally-funded ef- 
fort to link together the computers of the 
Library of Congress, the Research Libraries 
Group, OCLC and the Washington Library 
Network (a regional network which serves 
the libraries of the north Pacific in the same 
manner as the systems of OCLC and the 
Research Libraries: Group support their 
members). When this Linked Systems Pro- 
ject is completed, it will become possible for 
the major bibliographic utilities on the 
North American continent to share records 
among themselves and with the Library of 
- Congress. 
Another major preoccupation of United 
States librarians today is the physical 
preservation of their collections. As P.N. 
Banks, a noted expert on paper preserva- 
tion, warned in 1978, ‘it is safe to say that - 
the library environment is essentially hostile 
to all forms of recorded materials’’. But the 
severity of the problem did not gain general 
recognition among research librarians until 
the late 1970s. Even though preservation ex- 
perts had been issuing warnings for many 
years, most library administrators were 
under such extreme pressure to find ways to 
increase inter-library lending and to 
automate library operations that they had 
little time to attend to the longer-term 
danger of collection deterioration. 
During the early 1980s the situation 
changed rapidly and library staffs began to 
look carefully at the condition of their col- 
lections. A survey conducted at the Univer-

### 62750: The Computer revolution in research libraries

sity of Michigan determined that, based on 
1978 costs, expenditure in excess of forty 
million dollars would be required to 
preserve and to conserve all the volumes 
that would require attention between 1978 
and the end of the century. The results 
reported by the University of Michigan 
were typical of reports issued by other large 
research libraries. 
The financial dimensions of the preserva- 
tion problem are so staggering that most 
universities will not be able to raise the 
funds necessary to solve local problems. 
Co-operative programmes, such as the 
Research Library Group’s microfilming 
project, offer one of the few viable solu- 
tions, allowing libraries to work together 
and to avoid unnecessary duplication of 
microfilming activity. In the final analysis, 
if the content of American libraries is to 
survive for the use of future generations, it 
will probably require the assistance of 
private foundations and the intervention of 
Federal programmes to augment the 
resources made available by individual 
universities. 
The rapid growth in size and programmes 
of research libraries has also brought about 
great changes in the duties and respon- 
sibilities of professional librarians. Faculty 
staff have played a less active role in the 
development of library collections and this 
work has been turned over to library 
bibliographers and collection development 
experts. 
While the appearance of new technology 
has created new opportunities for libraries, 
the rapid changes caused by technology 
have also caused a great deal of organiza- 
tional stress. Librarians are caught between 
the opportunities afforded by technology 
and the considerable strain of acquiring 
new skills and developing new programmes. 
Technology has enabled librarians to 
play a more central role in providing faculty 
and students with publications, informa- 
tion and data derived from bibliographic 
and non-bibliographic data bases. In large 
part librarians have been successful because 
in recent years the profession has placed a 
strong emphasis on preparing them to work 
in an increasingly technological environ- 
ment. The major question facing academic 
librarianship is what roles the librarian will 
play in the years ahead. 
American research libraries will embrace 
new technology as it becomes available. For 
example, libraries are already considering 
how best to use the new video and optical 
disc technologies. These new storage 
systems linked to microcomputers will pro- 
vide opportunities to store vast amounts of 
printed matter in the form of analog images 
or as digitized data. The work at the Library 
of Congress utilizing optical disc 
technology suggests that this storage media 
might very well solve the current preserva- 
tion crisis. 
Librarians have been eminently suc- 
cessful in assisting students and researchers 
in the use of data bases to obtain informa-

Above, the first of the four parchment 
pages of the Constitution of the United 
States, signed on September 17, 1787. it 
came into force as part of the ‘‘supreme 
law of the land” on June 21, 1788 when 
New Hampshire became the ninth State to 
ratify it. The first three words were highly 
significant, since under the Constitution 
the source of power became ‘‘We the 
People”, itis the oidest written document 
of its kind in the world. 
tion about the location of books and jour- 
nals. But our ability to deliver documents 
has not kept pace with the improvements in 
providing bibliographic access. Thus future 
emphasis on improvements in document 
delivery systems seems quite important. 
One of the most important developments 
will be the growing interdependence bet- 
ween libraries and campus computer cen- 
tres. These two campus support systems 
have operated as independent organiza- 
tions, but as libraries become increasingly 
dependent upon technology and computer 
centres become more involved with the 
delivery of information the need for these 
two organizations to work more closely 
together becomes more evident. Althoughit 
is too early to say what changes are likely to 
take place, it is possible that this growing 
relationship will require changes in the way 
libraries and computer centres are organiz- 
ed within the university governance system. 
Writers such as Patricia Battin have 
described a possible integration of these two 
campus organizations. She foresees that 
such an integration of library and com- 
puting agency, ‘‘each with its specific 
strengths and expertise, will provide one- 
stop shopping for the university community 
as well as stabilizing planning mechanisms 
for effective and flexible response to rapidly 
changing technologies’. Other writers 
foresee a greater involvement in public 
policy as the scope of problems such as 
budgets, the need to capitalize expensive in- 
formation services and the problem of 
preservation require institutional response 
in the context of public policy. 
In the longer term, those who formulate 
public policy may come to realize that the 
research libraries of universities comprise a 
cohesive national resource rather than a 
series of individual collections. The 
technology necessary to link together the 
- libraries of the nation is rapidly becoming 
available and affordable so that the chang- 
ing attitudes of legislators and government 
officials toward the role of research 
libraries’ could become a major develop- 
ment during the next generation. mn

### 62751: History off the record: the archives of a teaching age

History off the record 
The archives of a teaching age 
the English county of Northumber- 
land. Twelve-year-olds are studying 
history—not the broad sweep of history as 
found in the traditional textbook, but 
history as it happened where they actually 
live. 
In a farmhouse on the Middleton Hall 
estate they find the date 1811 carved over 
the door. By consulting old land maps they 
learn what the countryside looked like when 
the house was built and that it took its name 
from another house, now in ruins, that 
stood farther up the hill. 
The name of the first occupant of the 
house is recorded in the county archives. 
Here also is to be found the contract of 
employment of shepherd Robert Burn, 
which lists his duties and specifies that he is 
to be paid in oats, barley and wheat and the 
yield of a row of potatoes and grass for two 
cows and sixty sheep. 
The children’s teacher discovered other 
things too—the building plans for the

manor house, showing the dining and living 
rooms, bedrooms and a study, the farm ac- 
counts in which the life style and farming 
methods of the past come to life far more 
vividly than in the readymade textbook 
presentation which makes the eighteenth 
century seem as remote and impersonal as 
the sagas of classical antiquity. } 
In the Federal Republic of Germany, at 
the suggestion of former President Gustav 
Heinemann, an annual competition has 
been held for the past ten years for 
schoolchildren who, in their own 
neighbourhood, in the local library, the 
local archives, among their friends and ac- 
quaintances, search for traces of the history

Three seventeen-year-olds in Darmstadt 
have researched a national democratic 
festival held in the summer of 1848 and 
have made a comparative study of leaflets 
and posters, newspaper reports and police 
records. A detective-like reconstruction of 
past events from frequently contradictory 
sources also provoked critical reflections on 
contemporary journalism. Pupils in 
Kelsterbach-am-Main are investigating the 
employment of prisoners of war and forced 
labour in local factories. They are discover- 
ing tombstones, old photographs, 
newspaper reports, lists of names and court 
records. These speak more eloquently than 
all the figures of anonymous millions in 
history textbooks. 
Schoolboy or schoolgirl in the archive, 
archivist in the school—this does not quite 
tally with the conventional image of the ar- 
chive as the silent, cloister-like haunt of »

» scholars in which elderly researchers, 
waited upon by dusty, attentive archivists, 
turn over the pages of ancient folio 
volumes, only occasionally disturbed by 
some cheeky student preparing a doctorate 
in history. The changed professional image 
of today’s archivist, who not only takes 
good care of the documentary heritage en- 
trusted to him but tries to use it actively for 
the political and historical education of a 
wider public and of the younger generation, 
coincides with a new trend in historical 
research and the teaching of history. 
Like other school subjects, history must 
no longer be taught in classroom lectures 
dealing in broad contexts and supported by 
recitals of large' quantities of facts and 
figures. It must be learned by independent 
personal effort. The sources thus consulted 
gain in clarity and vividness if they originate 
in familiar surroundings and relate to the 
student’s own region or even his or her 
place of residence. This is facilitated by the 
increased - attention now being paid to 
economic and social history. 
Exhibitions of documents from archives 
and school visits to archives were, of 
course, organized in the past. But the tradi- 
tional school visit, with a short introduction 
to the life, duties and working methods of 
the archivist, a tour of the archives and a 
presentation of selected documents, was 
merely a last optional item, coming after 
visits to the local newspaper office or sugar 
factory. 
Nowadays, classes or study groups of 
schoolchildren come to the archives to 
work, under the direction of teachers and 
_ archivists, with documents relating to the 
historical theme they are studying in class, 
so that through their personal frequenta- 
tion of the archives they can acquire a con- 
crete perception of the past and its 
documentary sediments, a glimpse into the 
  
world of historical research and an 
awareness of the need for a critical ap- 
proach to historical sources. 
A display of a limited number of 
documents centred on a particular subject 
of study in class, in whose selection atten- 
tion is paid to their informative value, meets 
educational purposes much better than a 
magnificent exhibition of the precious, 
original and visually attractive documents 
from an archive, or a large-scale represen- 
tative display which impresses and over- 
whelms by its richness and variety. 
Experience in recent years has shown that 
not only senior secondary school students 
but also younger children, especially those 
in the twelve-to-fifteen-year group, acquire 
an added interest in history while working 
on source documents. In England even 
eight- to ten-year-old children in domestic 
science classes in primary schools have been 
known to work with archive documents. 
Not all schoolchildren can visit an ar- 
chive. Not every town possesses an archive 
that is under expert supervision and many 
of the smaller ones lack adequate space to 
work in. But archives now go out to the 
public. For more than ten years the Hesse 
State Archives have been holding travelling 
exhibitions devoted to various aspects of 
the region’s history. Exhibitions on, for ex- 
ample, ‘‘Industrialization in Hesse’’ and 
‘““Emigration from Hesse’ have made two- 
year tours visiting between twenty and thir- 
ty towns in the State and exhibiting not only 
in public records offices and museums but 
also in town halls, savings banks and 
schools. Many teachers are already enquir- 
ing about the exhibition planned for next 
year so that they can structure their courses 
around it. 
Transcending the topical value of an ex- 
hibition, so-called ‘‘archival teaching 
units’’, comprising a limited number

### 62751: History off the record: the archives of a teaching age

(generally six to twelve) of facsimile 
documents have been produced with the co- 
operation of public records offices. They 
are accompanied where necessary by 
transcriptions, translations and ex- 
planatory notes. Sets of transparencies with 
accompanying explanatory texts serve a 
similar purpose but they need to be sup- 
plemented by facsimile documents with 
which the pupils themselves can work. 
Archival teaching aids of this kind are 
available in many States of the Federal 
Republic. They cover a large number of 
themes, especially economic and social 
history, crafts and craftsmen of the past, 
manufacturing and factories, road and 
railway construction. More general 
historical themes, such as the Reformation, 
the Thirty Years War, the impact of the 
French Revolution and the political strug- 
gles of the labour movement, also lend 
themselves to illustration with documents 
from the neighbourhood. 
The archivist cannot cope unaided with 
this new, additional task in the educational 
field. Not all archivists have received 
pedagogical training or have previous 
teaching experience. If this work is to suc- 
ceed, there must be co-operation between 
public records offices, school authorities, 
teachers and archivists. 
In France an organized Service éducatif 
in the State and Departmental public ar- 
chives and the attachment of qualified 
teachers to public archives, where they co- 
operate with archivists in organizing visits 
and preparing exhibitions and archival 
teaching units, goes back to the 1950s. In 
the United Kingdom too, the functions of 
the ‘‘Archive Education Officer” are 
becoming more and more widely recogniz- 
ed. An essential condition for the develop- 
ment of this type of co-operation is that the 
assistance of the public archives be made 
use of in the training of teachers and the 
running of guidance seminars for history 
teachers and future teachers. Arrangements 
of this kind are reported from many 
countries. 
“Archive and School’ is a new and un- 
familiar concept for many archivists and 
for most teachers. Several decades of prac- 
tice in France, and more recent experiments 
and expert discussions in the United 
Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Socialist 
countries, show that this is an important 
task and that the archivist can help the 
teacher to instil new life into the historical 
legacy of the past. It is also a task to which 
particular weight should be attached in 
Third World countries concerned for their 
historical identity. A study planned for 
1985 by Unesco’s Records and Archives 
Management Programme, on the theme 
“Archives and Education’’, will develop 
guidelines - for future action from a com- 
parison of recent experiences in this 
domain. ||

### 62752: Sense and censorship: behind the censor's blue pencil

Sense and censorship 
Behind the censor’s blue pencil 
the censorship services of the old 
Austro-Hungarian monarchy are 
today preserved in the Kriegsarchiv in Vien- 
na and in the military history archives in 
Budapest. Between 1916 and 1918 a thou- 
sand censors, grouped according to 
language, examined from eight to ten 
million letters a month, devoting particular 
attention to correspondence with foreign 
countries, soldiers and prisoners-of-war. 
Letters considered to be harmless were sent 
on untouched to their recipients; passages 
in others were obliterated and some letters 
were even confiscated. The obliterated 
passages were scrupulously copied out by 
the censors, and, with the confiscated let- 
ters, provided the basis for reports written 
by the Censorship Office on the morale of 
the troops and the civilian population. Half 
a century later these documents have 
become historical sources. 
These letters and fragments of letters pro- 
vide the scholar with little reliable informa- 
tion ahout troop movements, casualties, the 
output of factories or harvest yields. On the 
other hand they do contain precious infor- 
mation about everyday life and about the 
prevailing spirit in the army and the coun- 
try. Of course, the opinions expressed are 
far too moderate and loyal to be totally 
sincere, for their authors were quite aware 
that their letters would pass through the 
hands of the censor. But this in no way 
detracts from the informativeness of the 
material, for reading between the lines it is 
possible to discern grievances and news 
which the writers ingeniously but vainly 
sought to conceal from the censors. 
Towards the end of the war, self- 
censorship became notably more relaxed. 
From Spring 1917 on, the letters reflect to a 
fair extent what the population was think- 
ing and feeling. Some reports and extracts, 
like those concerning the desertion of the 
Serbs (1,300 extracts) or the repercussions 
of the October Revolution in Russia are of 
considerable interest to scholars. The 
overall impression of revolutionary ferment 
and of the radicalization of public opinion 
which emerges from these letters written by 
simple people is far more accurate than the 
contents of a biassed press subject to 
pressure from the authorities. 
This material was highly suitable for 
quantitative studies through the statistical 
treatment of representative samples. But 
the first step was to establish a grid of the 
basic themes of popular thinking. To 
analyse the state of mind of the population 
between November 1917 and March 1918, 
the author of this article took a sample of 
1,500 letters, two-thirds of which had been 
written by workers and peasants, and one- 
third by intellectuals and middle class peo- 
ple. In view of the ethnic structure of the 
monarchy, 46 per cent of the letters chosen 
were written by Austrians and Hungarians, 
and 54 per cent by members of other 
nationalities. 
I ARGE quantities of documents from 
by Peter Hanak 
The most common theme is that of social 
discontent (inequalities hetween rich and 
poor, boss and workman), which was ex- 
acerbated during the war and is evoked in 
37 per cent of the letters, in which the lives 
of the privileged, profiteers, and people in 
easy jobs are contrasted with the sacrifices 
of soldiers at the front and the poverty of 
the workers, Then comes the question of. 
work which is raised in 36 per cent of the let- 
ters, most of the complaints expressed at the 
beginning of the war being motivated by the 
disruption of normal activities. Thirdly, 
patriotism, referred to in 27 per cent of the 
letters, covers the conflict between loyalty 
to the State (represented by the emperor) 
and the nationalism of the different peoples 
of the monarchy. 
Social discontent, expressed in com- 
plaints against dire poverty, oppression and 
flagrant inequalities, and in sympathy for 
socialist movements and the Russian 
Revolution, intensifies in all the national 
groups as the months go by. The same, 
tendencies emerge from letters in which the 
second theme appears, with nostalgia for 
peace being transformed into positive 
demands. The majority (60 per cent) of the 
letters in the third group reveal the discon- 
tent caused by the oppression of the na- 
tionalities and a more or less explicit desire 
for autonomy, although loyalty towards the 
State remains firmly rooted. 
Quantitative analysis of the letters con- 
firms the existence of a close correlation 
between social discontent and a desire for 
peace, and an inverse correlation between a 
desire for social justice and peace on the one 
hand, and aspirations for national 
autonomy on the other. It seems that after 
the Russian socialist revolution, the masses 
were ready to accept the maintenance of the 
system in exchange for an immediate peace, 
a point of view not shared by the intellec- 
tuals of the oppressed nationalities. ‘‘Vic- 
tory is unnecessary, Russia is bringing 
peace’’, the Austrian censor remarked. 
“The people will soon put an end to all 
that’’, noted the Czech censor. “We need 
peace even at the price of a revolution,’’ is 
the message of the letters read by the 
Hungarian censor. Strike movements at 
that time illustrate the same state of mind. 
As well as making a direct contribution to 
our knowledge of the history of the First 
World War, the systematic analysis of the 
censorship archives in Vienna and Budapest 
can help us, in a broader context, to under- 
.stand the mechanisms which formed public 
opinion and moulded public attitudes. H

Enemies 
of the written word 
All materials of vegetable or animal origin that are 
used as a surface on which to write are extremely 
fragile. A host of enemies lie in wait ready to attack. 
Depending on whether they are chemical, at- 
mospheric or biological foes, they will assail either 
the outer surface or the very structure of the material. 
Inks fade and disappear, parchment and leather curl 
and craze. Insects and rodents devour organic 
materials; humidity, acid and light attack vegetable 
fibre; and fire can destroy anything combustible. 
Throughout the world, research institutes are study- 
ing ways and means of protecting books and 
documents. As part of its action for the safeguard of 
the world’s cultural heritage, Unesco is publishing a 
series of technical notes on the preservation and 
restoration of cultural property. The sixth of this 
series of publications, from which our photos are 
taken, is entitled Livres et Documents: Sauvegarde et 
Conservation (Books and Documents: safeguard and 
preservation), by Francoise Flieder and Michel 
Duchein (1983, in French only). Photos show ex- 
amples of deterioration due to three different agents. 
Right, a Syriac document transformed into “‘lace’’ by 
the action of ink. Some inks, when subject to humidi- 
ty have the effect of releasing sulphuric acid which 
eats away paper and parchment to give this lacework 
effect. Water too can cause considerable damage. 
Above, a book deteriorated by humidity. A wide 
variety of insects can cause havoc in libraries and ar- 
chives. Top photo shows a book ravaged by the atten- 
tions of an insect of the Anobidae family (which in- 
cludes the drugstore and death-watch beetles).

### 62765: The Lenin Library

The Lenin Library 
in the Soviet Union. It is the keystone of the coun- 
try’s unified library system, in which it acts as a 
depository for all publications, a co-ordination centre for 
library science and bibliographical work, a scientific and 
methodological centre, and a centre for inter-library loans. 
The library was founded in 1862: Its nucleus was the 
library of Count N.P. Rumantsev, an early nineteenth- 
century Russian politician and scholar for whom it was 
named. In 1918, when the Soviet Government was transfer- 
red from Petrograd to Moscow, the Rumantsev public 
library became the National Library. In 1921 it was function- 
ing as a State depository for all books published in the coun- 
try, and in the same year began to extend its holdings 
through the acquisition of works of foreign literature, a pro- 
cess which has continued regularly ever since. An interna- 
tional exchange service was inaugurated. On 6 February 
1925, by a decree of the Soviet Government, it was named 
the Lenin State Library. 
On 1 January 1984 the holdings of the Lenin Library 
amounted to 331,243,000 titles. Each year a million new 
works are acquired, 600,000 non-periodical publications and 
400,000 periodicals. The Library has almost 300,000 readers. 
Each year 2,215,000 entries are recorded, including 
1,202,000 to the scientific reading rooms. 
The Library publishes 500 titles each year. Its lending 
facilities serve 3,500 libraries in 110 countries. As part of 
inter-library exchange facilities, it receives approximately 
125,000 books and supplies 210,000. 
In 1987 the Lenin Library will be celebrating its 125th 
anniversary. [| 
T: Lenin State Library is the most important library 
“The Apostle’, the first dated Russian book, was printed at 
Moscow in 1564 by the first Russian printer, Ivan Fedorov. it 
forms part of the rich collection of rare books and manuscripts 
in the Lenin State Library of the USSR.

### 62766: The New science of bibliology

The new science of bibliology 
science, dating from around the end 
of the eighteenth or the beginning of 
the nineteenth century. The word first ap- 
peared in France in 1812 in Traité de 
Bibliologie a ‘‘Treatise on Bibliology’’ by 
G. Peignot which he described as ‘‘a univer- 
sal repertory containing critical and 
descriptive notes (...) on a large number of 
works (...) and covering every aspect of 
bibliography’, 
Bibliology as a science is arousing con- 
siderable interest today as two recent sym- 
posia bear witness. In 1981, a joint 
French/Bulgarian symposium on 
Bibliology, Documentation and Informa- 
tion Sciences, organized by the Central 
Library of the Bulgarian Academy of 
Sciences in collaboration with the French 
B scree ii is a comparatively new 
by Anne-Marie Bianchi 
Centre National de 1a Recherche Scientifi-- 
que, was held in Sofia; and, in February 
1984, a congress on Research and the 
Teaching of Bibliology and Trades Relating 
to the Book was held at the Georges Pom- 
pidou Centre, Paris. : 
The Paris symposium drew up a balance 
sheet of the state of the art and proposed the 
broad outlines of a policy for research on 
the book, for the teaching of bibliology and 
for the development of the teaching of pro- 
fessions connected with the written word, 
excluding newspapers and periodicals, for 
the period 1980 to 1990. } 
Bibliology can be said to be an extension 
of bibliography. Whereas bibliography is 
concerned primarily with the classification 
“of books and articles, bibliology aims to ex- 
amine and explain the various manifesta- 
tions of the book and the written word in 
general with regard to its production and 
distribution as well as to its reading. 
Bibliology is the study of the written 
‘word as a tool of communication within 
society, with all its sociological, cultural 
. and economic implications. It therefore 
encompasses all the disciplines that are 
. concerned with the world of books— 
bibliography, library management, book 
collecting, and the psychology and psycho- 
sociology of reading. [|

### 62767: A 'What's what' of libraries and archives

A ‘What’s What’ of libraries 
“and archives 
5,000 years of archives 
3000-2800 BC. In the temple of Eanna, in 
the Mesopotamian city of Uruk (now 
Varka), not far from what was then the 
mouth of the Euphrates, accounts and in- 
ventories were written - in Akkadian 
cuneiform script on clay tablets. It is from 
these, the oldest surviving. written 
documents, that the first economic archives 
developed. At about the same period the 
hieroglyphic system of writing was being 
developed in Egypt. It was used initially for 
inscriptions on monuments. 
1400-1200 BC. Diplomatic correspondence 
on clay tablets was documented in well 
organized chancery archives, remnants of 
which have survived in various capitals of 
the Eastern Mediterranean region such as 
Tell-el-Amarna in Egypt, Ugarit in Syria 
and the Hittite capital, Boghazkéy, in 
present-day Turkey. Documents in clay 
tablet form dating from the same period 
have been found in the so-called Palace of 
Nestor, north of Pilos, in the 
Peloponnesus. 
78-79 BC. The Tabularium of the central 
State archive of the Roman Empire was 
constructed at the foot of the Capitol, 
above the Roman Forum. Its ruins can still 
be seen. At first the Romans wrote on 
whitened wooden tablets (album). Later 
they adopted papyrus rolls from the Egyp- 
tians and Greeks. Fundamental laws were 
publicly displayed on bronze tablets. 
98 AD. A document written in the Chinese 
province of Gansu testified to the invention 
of paper, which legend attributes to the 
minister Ts’ai Lun. From China paper ar- 
rived in Japan and Korea. It reached the 
Arabs about 750 via the trading centre of 
Samarkand and afterwards spread to the 
whole of the Arab cultural area. 
538 AD. The Emperor Justinian decreed 
that the treaties and acts entered in the city 
registers or gesta municipalia, and per- 
manently preserved in a special public 
building called the archeion or archivum, 
should be regarded as authentic. He thus in- 
tegrated the archives into the corpus juris 
on which the development of European law 
is based. 
753-755 AD. Deeds or charters on parch- 
ment with wax seals stamped on or hanging 
from them became the most important 
form of document during the European 
Middle Ages. The earliest ones which have 
34 
come down to us, now in the National Ar- 
chives in Paris, are the original charters 
issued by King Pippin to the Abbey of St 
Denis. The first archives of deeds and 
charters originated in monasteries. It, was 
only later that city and State archives came 
into existence. 
1198. The present register of the Vatican ar- 
chives was begun when the Papal Chancery 
was transferred to the Vatican. The older 
register, in which the ancient tradition of 
the Roman public records or commentarii 
survived, was destroyed in the Lateran fire. 
Soon after 1200 a register of cor- 
respondence, which was important for the 
organization of archives, began to be kept 
in the royal chanceries of Paris, Barcelona 
and London. In the last-named capital they 
were kept in the form of rolls. 
C. 1450. In addition to the older charter or 
treasury archives, there now appeared ar- 
chives of administrative records, for which 
paper imported into Western Europe via 
Spain was already being used in rapidly in- 
creasing quantities from the 14th century 
onwards. 
1794. The French National Convention 
adopted the Archives Law of 7th Messidor 
of the year Il, under which the nation’s ar- 
chives, previously largely kept secret, were 
opened to the public. The system of 
organizing archives on national and 
regional or departmental lines, which was 
introduced under the revolutionary regime 
in France, became the model for modern ar- 
chives organization in Western Europe. 
1821. The Ecole des Chartes, the first 
school to specialize in training archivists 
and librarians, whose formation is concen- 
trated on the study of historical sources, 
was established in Paris. 
1841. A decree made work in French ar- 
chives subject to respect des fonds. The 
principle of provenance, already partly 
observed elsewhere, under which archives 
are classified according to the authorities 
and institutions where they originated, 
became the fundamental modern system of 
archive organization, 
1910. The first international congress of ar- 
chivists and librarians was held in Brussels. 
The subjects discussed ranged from the 
repair of archive volumes and restoration 
problems to the economic archives then be- 
ing set up and the handling of film archives. 
1918. The revolutionary government in 
Russia led by Lenin issued the decree of 
1.6.1918 on the ‘“‘reorganization and cen- 
tralization of archives’. Its concept of a 
centralized State archive became the model 
for archives in the Socialist countries. 
1948. Influenced by the damage caused to 
archives during the Second World War, a 
group of archive experts invited to Paris by 
Unesco decided upon the creation of the In- 
ternational Council on Archives (ICA). Ar- 
chivists from 33 countries participated in 
the founding congress two years later. 
1950. The passing of the Federal Records 
Act in the USA provided a legal basis for 
the system of rational records administra- 
tion already in operation and for the 
establishment of record centres. The British 
Public Records Act of 1958 created another 
model for records administration. 
1968. The creation of a regional archives 
association for Southeast Asia (SARBICA) 
confirmed the spread of modern archive 
concepts in the Third World. In the same 
year it was decided at a congress in Niamey 
to set up a regional training centre in Dakar. 
The result—EDAD-—is a model for closer 
co-operation between archive, library and 
documentation centre. Meanwhile the In- 
ternational Council on Archives embraces 
nine regions in every part of the world. At 
the International Archives Congress in 
Washington in 1976 there was talk of a 
“‘geoarchival revolution”. 
1984. About 1300 archivists from over 100 
countries took part in the 10th Interna- 
tional Archives Congress in Bonn (FRG). 
Under the general theme of ‘‘the challenge 
to archives”, the participants discussed the 
effects of computerization and the new 
media, and new tasks in the public sphere.

the eastern part of Beljing, Is the oldest 
and best preserved imperial archive In 
China. Right, the main hail of the Archive,

Archives 
by the kilometre 
HE importance of the world’s ar- 
" chival institutions, from large 
National Archives to local record 
offices, may be gauged from the number 
of people who use them or by the volume 
of their holdings, usually measured in 
metres of shelving—although such quan- 
titative yardsticks provide only a limited in- 
dication of the value of their contents for 
research. : 
One of the world’s oldest archival in- 
stitutions is the General Archives in 
Simancas (Spain), with 9,500 metres of 
records some dating as far back as 834. 
The largest archival institution outside 
Europe is the National Archives in 
Washington, D.C., which today has 470 
kilometres of shelving. The Public Ar- 
chives of Canada preserve 38 km of con- 
ventional archives, and 350 km of semi- 
current records administered in federal 
records centres throughout the country. 
Europe’s biggest archives are the Ar- 
chives Nationales in France (350 km not 
including 36 km at the Archives d’Outre- 
Mer, 27 km at the Foreign Affairs archives 
and 65 km at the Armed Forces archives) 
and the Public Record Office in London, 
which holds 379 km (the India Office 
records . occupy 11 km of shelving 
whereas the National Archives of India 
preserve 25 km). 
The State Archives of Venice hold 68 
km, surpassing archives which are 
historically as important such as the Na- 
tional Archives of Belgium (55 km) and 
Hungary (33 km). 
The Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv in 
Vienna preserves 25 km of data, but there 
are five other central archives in Austria, 
which together preserve 100 km. 
In Czechoslovakia, federal, regional 
and local archives together preserve 563 
km. In the Netherlands, a small, densely 
populated country with a long history in 
which cities played an important role, 
there are 383 km of historical archives, 63 
km of which are in the National Archives at 
The Hague. : 
Major archives exist not only in Europe 
and North America. The National Ar- 
chives of Zimbabwe preserve 49 km, not 
counting 33 km of semi-current records in 
other centres. In Nigeria the National Ar- 
chives store 28 km. 
All these institutions, as well as hun- 
dreds of smaller archives, are listed in the 
international Directory of Archives 
published by the International Council on 
Archives (a new edition is currently being 
prepared for publication this year. [|

Unesco Prize 
for Peace Education 
Nominations are being invited for the 
Unesco Prize for Peace Education, which 
will be awarded for the fifth time this 
year. The purpose of the Prize is ‘'to pro- 
mote all forms of action designed to ‘con- 
struct the defences of peace in the minds 
of men’ by rewarding a particularly 
outstanding example of activity designed 
to alert public opinion and mobilize the 
conscience of mankind in the cause of 
peace.”” The Prize, which is worth 
$US 60,000, is awarded annually. Ac- 
cording to the rules governing the award 
of the Prize candidates may be ‘“‘an in- 
dividual, a group of individuals, or an 
organization’’ and may be nominated by 
Member States of Unesco, intergovern- 
mental organizations, non-governmental 
organizations granted consultative 
status with Unesco and persons whom 
the Director-General deems qualified in 
the field of peace.” Laureates are 
designated by the Director-General on 
the basis of proposals submitted by an in- 
ternational jury, the International Com- 
mission for Peace in the Minds of Men. 
Nominations should reach the Unesco 
Secretariat not later than 31 March 
19865. 
 
Kalinga Prize Awards 
The 1984 Kalinga Prize for the 
Popularization of Science has been 
awarded to professor Yves Coppens of 
France and Academician Igor Petryanov- 
Sokolov of the Soviet Union. Prof. Cop- 
pens, who is the director of the Musée de 
I'Homme in Paris, is a distinguished 
palaeontologist who has written and lec- 
tured widely, given many radio and TV 
broadcasts, and organized numerous ex- 
hibitions including one on the origins of 
man which drew 300,000 visitors to the 
Musée de I'Homme in 17 months. 
Academician Petryanov-Sokolov, who is 
a professor at the Moscow Institute of 
Chemistry and Technology, has col- 
laborated with a number of popular 
science magazines and took part in the 
production of the scientific section of the 
12-volume Soviet Children’s Encyclo- 
paedia. 
 
Finnish edition 
of the Unesco Courier 
We are happy to announce the launching 
of a Finnish edition of the Unesco 
Courier, published by the Finnish Na- 
tional Commission for Unesco, Ministry 
of Education, Rauhankatu 4, SF - 00170 
Helsinki 17. The publication of the first 
issue of the Finnish edition, in October 
1984, brought the total number of dif- 
ferent language editions of the Unesco 
Courier to 29, in addition to the quarterly 
Braille selection. 
International 
Simon Bolivar Prize 
The International Simon Bolivar Prize will 
be awarded for the second time in 1985. 
The biennial Prize, established by the 
Government of Venezuela and awarded 
under the auspices of Unesco, rewards 
activity of outstanding merit which has 
contributed to the freedom, in- 
dependence and dignity of peoples and 
to the strengthening of solidarity among 
nations, or facilitated the quest for a new 
international economic, social and 
cultural order. The first recipients of the 
* Prize, in 1983, were King Juan Carlos of 
Spain and Nelson Mandela, the African 
National Congress leader imprisoned in 
South Africa. The final date for the sub- 
mission of nominations is 15 March 
1985. B

General introduction 
to the techniques 
of information and 
documentation work. 
Claire Guinchat 
and Michel Menou 
  
Unesco 
  
In developing countries, the organization of efficient 
library and documentation structures is being held 
back largely by the absence or shortage of trained 
staff. General Introduction to the Techniques of In- 
formation and Documentation Work is a comprehen- 
sive, simply written, and easy-to-consult manual for 
all those who, in developing countries, begin their 
careers in information units without any basic train- 
ing in information science. It aims to enable them to 
grasp the essential purpose of the activities they are 
asked to perform and to understand how these ac- 
tivities are related to the full range of means used to 
ensure the flow of information. It also provides a 
description, sufficiently detailed to serve as a guide, of 
the various operations, instruments and concepts 
related to information systems. Designed primarily as 
an instrument of self-training, to be used by the in- 
dividual on his own, it could also be employed in in- 
formation units or in colleges of information science 
as a reference work for training courses, as a guide for 
the preparation of courses or as a means of checking 
background knowledge prior to a course of specializ- 
ed training.
