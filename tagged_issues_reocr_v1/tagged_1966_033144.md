SAINT ANNE FREED FROM THE SANDS 
Painted 1,200 years ago, this fresco portrait of Saint Anne was buried for eight 
centuries beneath the sands of Sudanese Nubia. It is one of 169 paintings discovered 
in the cathedral of Faras between 1962 and 1963 by a Polish archaeological mission 
(see the Unesco Courier, December 1964). The rescue of these frescoes, just 
before Faras disappeared beneath the waters of the Nile, was an outstanding 
victory in Unesco’s International Campaign to Safeguard the Monuments of 
Nubia. The Saint Anne fresco is now in the Khartoum Museum (Sudan).

On November 4, 1966, Unesco 
celebrates its 20th anniversary. 
Born at the end of the Second 
World War, it has devoted its 
efforts during the past 20 years 
to building the foundations for 
peace based on international 
solidarity. In these two dec- 
ades the world has undergone 
far-reaching transformations, 
and Unesco has evolved with 
these changes and adapted 
its work to meet the new needs 
of its member states. In this 
special issue we have sought 
to present the major changes 
in education, science and cul- 
ture in the world during the past 
20 years and what Unesco has 
done in these fields. Photo

UNESCO'S 
20 
YEARS 
  
HIS year, as Unesco prepares to 
mark its twentieth anniversary next 
November fourth, plans are already under way 
for a frank and uninhibited reappraisal of the 
work that has been accomplished in the short 
span of this Organization’s existence. 
Let me indicate first in what light Unesco 
appears to me as an instrument of international 
co-operation. While for many years Unesco’s 
concept of co-operation was that of intellectual 
co-operation, today it is both operational as 
well as intellectual. 
By intellectual co-operation | mean the encour- 
agement and organization on a world scale of 
the pursuit, examination and interpretation of 
knowledge as well as the exchange of ideas 
and mutual experiences. This is being done 
diligently and without fanfare by the specialist, 
unnoticed usually by the public at large, and 
aims principally at promoting the advance of all 
branches of intellectual endeavour. 
To the scientists, artists and scholars of this 
world, then, must go our thanks for the changes 
man has brought about through his creative 
spirit and his reasoning, and Unesco is proud 
of the efforts it has been able to make to help 
these scientists and scholars and to bring 
them closer together. Thanks to them the story 
of our species is slowly ceasing to be that of 
man submitting passively to his fate and is 
becoming one of a rapid march of triumph 
toward freedom and liberation and responsi- 
bility. The practice of intellectual co-operation 
is becoming more widespread every day as its 
import and scope are being nurtured and enrich- 
ed, and this is fashioning the understructure 
of what we may well call the first true world 
civilization. 
Quite another matter are Unesco’s opera- 
tional activities in aid of development. This is 
a dual type -action—on the one hand it is inter- 
national in purpose, and the means and methods 
used; on the other it is national as regards 
execution and at least in the immediate objec- 
tives pursued. In this sense it is a unique 
formula, and the most typical, and | daresay, 
the most effective contribution that the special- 
ized, technical agencies of the U.N. such as 
Unesco are now making to development. 
It must be admitted that the founders of 
Unesco could not then foresee an undertaking 
of such scope, and that when Unesco did ulti- 
mately adopt operational assistance as a 
normal and indeed main method of work this 
was due much more to the fact that it was a 
member of the United Nations family than to its 
own exclusive initiative. 
If since 1950 operational assistance has 
become a systematic part of the Unesco pro- 
gramme, the credit belongs to the U.N. Expan- 
ded Programme of Technical Assistance as 
well as to the U.N. Special Fund which since 
1960 has placed at Unesco’s disposal vast addi- 
tional funds, so that the total of these resources 
now accounts for a predominant part of Unes- 
co’s overall budget. | should like to pay my 
tribute to those responsible for conceiving and 
directing these two great inter-organizational 
enterprises which this year have been com- 
bined into one body, called the United Nations 
Development Programme. To them Unesco 
owes a new dimension in its work. 
The expansion of Unesco’s operational activ- 
ities, occurring as it did simultaneously with 
the entry into Unesco of many newly indepen- 
dent states, mainly from Africa, has resulted in 
such a profound change in the programme and 
structure of Unesco since 1960 that the term 
“mutation” has been used to describe it.

Perhaps the expression “conversion to devel- 
opment” would be more descriptive. 
At present operational assistance for devel- 
opment represents about two-thirds of Unesco’s 
total resources, which shows the high priority 
that Unesco accords to aid for the developing 
nations and the degree of its concrete action in 
this respect. 
| have no doubt that the day will come when 
in speaking of economic development we will 
think of it more in terms of its cultural aspects. 
It has been said time and again that the instru- 
ment and final purport of development was 
man, but perhaps the deep implications of this 
statement have not always been fully recog- 
nized. It signifies that the cultural values a 
people or a nation hold most dear and consider 
their raison d’étre ultimately will determine 
what they consider possible to achieve and 
what they consider they ought to achieve for 
their own development. 
The technocrats—it makes no difference 
whether they are local technocrats or foreign 
technocrats—who are often the masters in 
these matters, and who delight in the cold 
technology and the impersonal machines they 
import from abroad, have learned this to their 
great chagrin—and of course to the chagrin of 
those they believed they were helping without 
knowing or understanding them. Here the 
social sciences have a paramount role to play 
particularly in the earlier planning stages of 
development, the importance of which we are 
often inclined to underestimate. 
HAT precisely do we mean when we 
say that a community is underdevel- 
oped? 1 would not hesitate to say that it was 
one which had not acceded in its thinking and 
habits to the civilization of science and techno- 
logy which is the pattern and driving force of 
human progress today. In other words, that a 
country is developed to the degree that its 
science and technology have ceased to be a 
magic potion imported from abroad and have 
become a living, integrated part of its culture. 
Unesco considers the establishment of 
science within the nation itself of the utmost 
importance because it is convinced that this, 
more than the mere transfer of knowledge, is 
the only real way to create the basic prerequi- 
sites for a nation’s development. But it should 
be clear that what we are actually dealing with 
here is not just a question of proper organiza- 
tion but of social change, or what the social 
scientist calls “acculturation”. Development 
is science become part of the cultural fibre. 
These are the chief characteristics, in my 
view, of the technical action Unesco is carrying 
out in the two closely integrated fields of 
intellectual co-operation and operational co- 
operation or assistance. 
And yet they are not the main features of 
Unesco’s work. Unesco’s ultimate objective is 
not simply technical; it is essentially and funda- 
mentally ethical or moral in nature. Unesco is 
not interested merely in the advancement of 
education, science and culture per se, no matter 
how great their intrinsic worth may be, for in the 
light of Unesco’s Constitution they are no more 
than a means and a way. The aim of Unesco is 
the aim of the whole family of the United 
Nations, namely, peace. But a peace construed 
and pursued in a unique fashion, which govern- 
ments had never before had the courage—one 
is tempted to say the candour—to proclaim 
openly as the rule for their concerted action. 
U NESCO was founded on the belief 
that it is man in his own freedom 
who ultimately decides the course of history 
and chooses between peace and war (“wars 
begin in the minds of men” says the Preamble 
to the Unesco Constitution) and consequently 
there can be no true peace unless there is a 
consensus of the mind for an order which the 
mind esteems. 
What is that order? It is human dignity, which 
is expressed and particularized in the various 
human rights and whose reign is called social 
justice and love, or at the very least tolerance 
in the hearts of men. That is why the founders 
of Unesco proclaimed that “it is in the minds 
of men that the defences of peace must be 
constructed.” 
Education, science and culture are the do- 
mains that form and inspire the mind. Unesco’s 
mission, and the ultimate reason for its 
existence, lies in using these domains—I 
employ the word “use” advisedly—to establish 
in the very depths of the consciousness of indiv- 
iduals and peoples those conditions of justice 
and tolerance which in the final analysis govern 
freedom or slavery, life or death... 
For Unesco, therefore, both the technical 
and the ethical aspects of its work are inescap- 
ably bound together, and Unesco’s existence 
is predicated on the continuance of this bond. 
That is why all those who have had the honour 
to serve Unesco are patently aware, since they 
have experienced it in their own lives, that 
Unesco is not only an institution at the service 
of its member states but an attitude of mind 
and a voice directed at the conscience of every 
man.

Director-General of Unesco

‘Since wars begin in the minds of men, 
it is in the minds of men 
that the defences of peace must be constructed’ 
—— Constitution of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization 
 
  
a
The Governments of the States Par- 
ties to this Constitution on behalf 
of their peoples declare: 
Tia since wars begin in the minds of 
men, it is in the minds of men that 
the defences of peace must be cons- 
tructed; 
That ignorance of each other’s ways and 
lives has been a common cause, 
throughout the history of mankind, 
of that suspicion and mistrust between 
the peoples of the world through 
which their differences have all too 
often broken into war; 
That the great and terrible war which 
has now ended was a war made 
possible by the denial of the democra- 
tic principles of the dignity, equality 
and mutual respect of men, and by 
the propagation, in their place, 
through ignorance and prejudice, of 
the doctrine of the inequality of men 
and races; 
That the wide diffusion of culture, and 
the education of humanity for justice 
and liberty and peace are indispens- 
able to the dignity of man and consti- 
tute a sacred duty which all the 
nations must fulfil in a spirit of 
mutual assistance and concern;   
That a peace based exclusively upon the 
political and economic arrangements 
of governments would not be a peace 
which could secure the unanimous, 
lasting and sincere support of the 
peoples of the world, and that the 
peace must therefore be founded, if 
it is not to fail, upon the intellectual 
and moral solidarity of mankind. 
Fo: these reasons, the States Parties to 
this Constitution, believing in full 
and equal opportunities for education 
for all, in the unrestricted pursuit of 
objective truth, and in the free 
exchange of ideas and knowledge, are 
agreed and determined to develop 
and to increase the means of commu- 
nication between their peoples and to 
employ these means for the purposes 
of mutual understanding and a truer 
and more perfect knowledge of each 
other's lives; 
I. consequence whereof they do here- 
by create the United Nations Educa- 
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organi- 
zation for the purpose of advancing, 
through the educational and scientific 
and cultural relations of the peoples 
of the world, the objectives of inter- 
national peace and of the common 
welfare of mankind for which the 
United Nations Organization was 
established and which its Charter 
proclaims.

The purpose of the Organization is to contribute to peace 
and security by promoting collaboration among the nations 
through education, science and culture in order to further 
universal respect for justice, for the rule of law and for the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed 
for the peoples of the world, without distinction of race, 
sex, language or religion by the Charter of the United Nations. 
To realize this purpose the Organization will: 
a. Collaborate in the work of advancing the mutual know- 
ledge and understanding of peoples, through all means 
of mass communication and to that end recommend such 
international agreements as may be necessary to promote 
the free flow of ideas by word and image; 
b. Give fresh impulse to popular education and to the spread 
of culture: 
by collaborating with Members, at their request, in the 
development of educational activities; 
by instituting collaboration among the nations to advance Photo ©@ Keystone 
the ideal of equality of educational opportunity without 
regard to race, sex or any distinctions, economic or social; 
by suggesting educational methods best suited to prepare 
the children of the world for the responsibilities of free- Photo Unesco-Holmquist RE 
dom; 
¢. Maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge : 
by assuring the conservation and protection of the world’s 
inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of 
history and science, and recommending to the nations 
concerned the necessary international conventions; 
by encouraging co-operation among the nations in all 
branches of intellectual activity, including the international 
exchange of persons active in the fields of education, 
science and culture and the exchange of publications, objects 
of artistic and scientific interest and other materials of 
information: by initiating methods of international co- 
operation calculated to give the people of all* countries 
access to the printed and published materials produced by 
any of them. 
with a view to preserving the independence, integrity and 
fruitful diversity of the cultures and educational systems of 
the States members of this Organization, the Organization is 
prohibited from intervening in matters which are essentially 
within their domestic jurisdiction.

SCIENCE 
  
by Lord Ritchie-Calder 
| HE generation which has 
grown up in the past 
twenty years is unique. Nothing like 
it has ever existed in the history of 
mankind. Every teenager and every 
twenty-year old everywhere has, in his 
or her bones, radio-strontium, a man- 
made element which did not exist 
before 1945. Its presence, the result 
of fall-out from atmospheric bomb 
tests (now suspended), may be medi- 
cally unimportant but it is the brand- 
mark of The Atomic Age. For many, 
their birth certificates were registered 
by computers. For some, their zodia- 
cal sign was Sputnik. But their future 
was not predicted by astrologers; it 
was predicated by scientists. 
This is a generation which was born 
into The Atomic Age, programmed into 
The Cybernetic Age, rocketed into The 
Space Age and stands poised on the 
threshold of The DNA Age. They 
take for granted scientific and techno- 
logical advances about which the 
Founder Fathers of the United Nations, 
legislating for the future, knew nothing. 
When they signed the Charter at San 
Francisco in June 1945 only three 
people—Truman, Attlee and Eden— 
knew (and each imperfectly) about the 
impending release of nuclear energy. 
Which shows how wise were we 
who put the “S" into Unesco. It 
nearly was not there. The Committee 
LORD RITCHIE-CALDER has been pro- 
fessor of international relations at the 
University of Edinburgh since 1961. He 
has travelled over most of the world on 
missions for the UN. and its specialized 
of Allied Ministers of Education who, 
in wartime London, recognized the 
necessity for such a specialized 
agency, conceived it as UNECO-the 
United Nations Educational and Cultur- 
al Organization. One recalls the argu- 
ments: the pedagogues regarded 
science as something which, read in 
textbooks or taught in class, belonged 
to education and the aesthetes re- 
garded science as something which, 
with the grace and patina of time, 
might qualify as culture. There were 
others who argued that science was 
the pace-maker for both education and 
culture. 
In view of the later agonizing about 
“The Two Cultures” it is worthwhile 
remembering that the person who ac- 
tively and successfully promoted the 
“S" was the distinguished poet, Archi- 
bald MacLeish, and that the first Direc- 
tor-General, Julian Huxley, was a 
scientist. 
One must not blame those who 
doubted. What we now recognize as 
the Scientific and Technological Revo- 
lution was not as self-evident, even in 
terms of destructiveness of war, as it 
is today. But we had confirmation, 
with full justification of the “S”", by the 
time of the first General Conference in 
1946. 
The Atomic Age had been born with 
count-down precision at 5:30 a.m. on 
Monday, July 16, 1945, in the desert 
of New Mexico and the realization, for 
the world's people, came with appal- 
ling force with the destruction of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear 
energy, Man's greatest discovery 
cally pre-historicl They are not the 
least surprised when an astronaut 
steps out of a space capsule travelling 
at 17,500 miles an hour and ambles 
across the continent of America in 
20 minutes or round the globe in 
90 minutes. They accept, without 
perplexity, that a man-made piece of 
hardware can circumnavigate Planet 
Number 3, the Earth, sixteen times a 
day; that probes can reach out to 
Mars or Venus or “soft-land” on the 
moon and they judge them less by 
what they report back than by what 
they fail to do. Communications 
satellites, mirroring events on the far 
side of the world, impress them less 
than the first automatic telephone ex- 
change did my generation. And why 
not? They assume that you ask the 
scientist and hire the technologist and 
they will produce anything you want. 
The youth of today recognizes, what 
is not yet plain to his elders, that the 
scientist has miniaturized his planet. 
No place on earth is more than a few 
hours distant by jet-propulsion; no 
place on earth is more than a few 
minutes away by rocket-propulsion; 
and no place on earth is more than 
split seconds away by radio. In a 
single generation, man has unlocked 
the secret of matter and released it as

  In launching the International Hydrological Decade in 1965, Unesco has called for global action to meet 
one of the great threats confronting the multiplying world population—Ilack of water, and also its abuse. 
This vast programme of hydrological studies will include a world-wide stocktaking of water 
resources. Under its Major Project for Arid Zone Research (1957-1962), Unesco has already 
organized systematic studies of areas covering one-third of the earth's land surface, in over 
a score of scientific fields, including hydrology, new energy resources such as solar and wind 
energy, ecology and climatology. It has also helped to set up desert research institutes (in Israel, 
Turkey, India, U.A.R. and Pakistan, for instance) whose aim is the reconquest of arid lands. Here, 
a technician uses laboratory models to study water flow problems.

he is reaching out to the limits of the 
universe and recording the broadcast 
signals of cosmic events of thousands 
of millions of years ago. 
Pierre Auger, Director of the Natu- 
ral Sciences Department of Unesco 
during the scientifically eruptive years 
of the 1950s, coined a phrase (Current 
Trends in Scientific Research, Unesco 
1961) which has become overworked 
but which is limpid truth: “Of all the 
scientists and research workers who 
have existed since the beginning of 
Homo sapiens, ninety per cent are 
alive today.” 
The other ten per cent have their 
niches in the Gallery of Time which 
stretches back to the mastery of fire, 
perhaps 100,000 years ago. This is 
another way of saying that the bulk of 
measurable achievements of science 
belongs to the past fifty and, prepon- 
derantly, to the past twenty years. 
Or as it was put by an enthusiastic 
young physicist, “Today, we are privi- 
leged to sit side by side with the 
giants on whose shoulders we stand.” 
This acrobatic feat and this juggling 
with Time is like saying that Harvey 
had discoursed with Aristotle; that 
Einstein had exchanged reprints with 
Newton; that Watt had met Archimedes 
at a seminar; or that Pasteur, before 
taking his broth up into the bacteria- 
free Alps, had had a word with Rhases, 
the Lute Player, who, in A.D. 900 hung 
pieces of fresh meat around Baghdad 
and where the meat putrefied least 
built the Caliph's hospital. 
P UT it another way: Think 
of H.G. Wells, the centen- 
ary of whose birth we are celebrating 
this year. Writers of modern science 
fiction will tell you that they have to 
escape into remote fantasy because 
otherwise they will find their imaginative 
projections overtaken on the news 
pages of the Late Night Special. Wells, 
a trained scientist, would take a piece. 
of abstruse research and confidently 
prophesy its fulfilment. This is what he 
did with a scientific paper by Frederick 
Soddy which no more than hinted at 
the release of nuclear energy from the 
splitting of the atom and, in The World 
Set Free, Wells fictionalized it, pre- 
dicting with uncanny accuracy the arti- 
ficial splitting of the atom twenty years 
ahead. 
That was comparatively short-range 
forecasting but even Wells would not 
have been rash enough, even in fiction, 
to foretell what followed the discovery 
of uranium fission by Hahn and Strass- 
man in 1938. Immediately the signif- 
icance of chain-reaction was under- 
stood. By the spring of 1940 Peierls 
and Frisch had sent to the British 
MAUD Committee the specification for 
an atom bomb and by 1945, at the 
expense of $2,000,000,000, the Man- 
hattan Project, by mobilizing the scien- 
tists of many nationalities and the vast 
technological potential of the United 
States, had produced it. Science had 
become a “crash programme” and the 
Big Machines had replaced the “string 
and sealing wax" laboratories. 
The atom bomb has had as pro- 
found an effect on science as it has 
had on history. Whereas, in the past, 
the scientists had been entitled to say 
that they had made discoveries and 
that others had perverted them into 
weapons of destruction, in this case the 
scientists themselves had conceived a 
fundamental advance as a bomb, a 
thousand times (and later, with the 
H-bomb, a million times) more power- 
ful than existing explosives. 
It was the scientists, including Ein- 
stein, the pacifist, who, with some diffi- 
culty, persuaded the politicians and 
generals that the bomb should be 
made. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
this produced a conscience-crisis 
among the scientists. Their ivory 
towers had been shattered by the blast 
and they felt a great weight of social 
responsibility. They could no longer 
detach themselves from politics in the 
widest sense. 
in 1946 Einstein became chairman of 
the Emergency Committee of Atomic 
Scientists at Princeton, New Jersey, 
and issued a personal statement: 
“Science has brought forth this dan- 
ger, but the real problem is in the 
minds and hearts of men. We will not 
change the hearts of other men by 
mechanism, but by changing our hearts 
and speaking bravely. 
“We must be generous in giving to 
the world the knowledge that we have 
of the forces of nature, after establish- 
ing safeguards against abuse. 
“We must be not merely willing but 
actively eager to submit ourselves to 
binding authority necessary for world 
security. 
“We must realize that we cannot 
simultaneously plan for war and peace. 
“When we are clear in heart and 
mind—only then shall we find courage 
to surmount the fear which haunts the 
world.” 
Physicists who had been involved 
in the evolution of the bomb formed 
themselves into Atomic Scientists 
Associations in Britain and in America 
TWO DECADES OF SCIENCE (Continued) 
Their ivory tower toppled with Hiroshima 
and went into the market place to 
inform the public about the military 
and political consequences, about 
radiation hazards and about the 
peaceful uses. This ultimately found 
its expression in a new kind of 
“learned society,” the Pugwash 
Conference. The first conference in 
1957 brought together in the village of 
Pugwash, Nova Scotia, the eminent 
scientists of East and West. And the 
movement has continued—a coming- 
together, not of decision-makers but of 
scientists who can influence those 
who make decisions. 
| N 1955, and again in 1958, 
we had the United Nations 
Conferences on the Peaceful Uses of 
Atomic Energy at Geneva. The first 
was one of the most exhilarating occa- 
sions in the history of science because 
it brought together scientists who, for 
fifteen years, had been cut off from 
their colleagues by the barbed-wire 
fences of military security. Immediately, 
to the dismay of those who had to try 
to maintain secrecy, the Uranium Cur- 
tain, as well as the Iron Curtain, col- 
lapsed. 
There was a disclosure, and a shar- 
ing, of fundamental knowledge and, as 
the late Homi J. Bhabha, the Indian 
President of the Conference, said, 
“Knowledge once given can never be 
taken away.” What was revealed was 
not the know-how of making the bomb 
but the know-why of nuclear physics. 
It was summed up by the remark of 
Dr. E.T. Hughes who had been pre- 
siding over a session on the cross- 
section of the nucleus (supposed to be 
the most jealously guarded secret) at 
which scientists of seven different 
groups, not only within the nuclear 
powers but in countries like Portugal, 
had disclosed their findings. These 
had been plotted on a graph and 
the plots were indistinguishable. 
Dr. Hughes came jubilantly into a 
plenary meeting, unrolled the graph 
like a scroll and said, “This should be 
the emblem of this Conference. It 
shows, thank heavens, that the nucleus 
is the same on both sides of the Iron 
Curtain.” 
The high promises of foot-loose, 
peaceful energy, which was to solve 
the industrial problems of the under- 
developed countries (we call them “de- 
veloping” now) have not yet been ful- 
filled. Those cheap nuclear reactors 
for industrial purposes which seemed 
almost at the “wrap it up and take it 
away” stage in 1955 have not been 
forthcoming. Electric power from the 
atom—yes, for those who can afford 
huge generating stations and have a 
grid system, but not the packaged 
reactors for poor countries. Nor are 
we yet in sight of Bhabha's vision of

TWO DECADES OF SCIENCE (Continued) 
Discoveries that changed the face of the 
thermo-nuclear energy—putting the 
H-bomb into civilian dungarees with, in 
his phrase, “as much energy as there 
is deuterium in the Seven Seas.” In 
other words, limitless. 
Out of such conferences came the 
“open house” nuclear research cen- 
tres—Brookhaven in the U.S.A, Dubna 
in the U.S.S.R. and C.ER.N., the Cen- 
tre for European Nuclear Research, a 
co-operative of European govern- 
ments which Unesco helped to initiate, 
in Switzerland. The study of funda- 
mental particles—the structure of the 
nucleus—means massive machines, 
enormously expensive, like the one 
which is about to be built in America 
at a cost of $340,000,000. Small—and 
even big—countries cannot afford to 
have them of their own but they can 
contribute to the cost and have use 
of the facilities. 
The encouragement of such interna- 
tional enterprises has been one of the 
principal functions of. Unesco since 
1946 when, instead of the billion dollar 
budget it should have had, we, the 
delegates, gave it the wishful words 
“stimulate” and “facilitate.” And that, 
particularly in science, is what the 
organization has done eminently well. 
Science, of course, is traditionally a 
commonwealth. International co-oper- 
ation between individuals, national 
learned societies and the congresses 
of the various disciplines existed but 
had been interrupted by the war. The 
guiding body is ICSU—the Internation- 
al Council of Scientific Unions. lt 
had been more or less “moth-balled” 
during the war when the free-trade in 
ideas was suspended. It needed “facil- 
itating.” Unesco could not afford fuel 
oil but it could provide lubricating oil. 
It enabled ICSU to get moving again 
and Unesco’s “stimulation” consisted 
of encouraging the formation of further 
unions and congresses for any mis- 
sing discipline, and the effect was 
immediate. 
FTER the first World War 
intransigence and discrim- 
ination had prevented scientific 
congresses from getting together for 
over six years. After the Second 
World War, with Unesco’s help, they 
were resumed within six months and 
the man-to-man exchanges and the 
cross-fertilization of ideas was one of 
the factors in the acceleration of scien- 
tific progress. 
The outstanding achievement of the 
Unesco-ICSU combination was the 
International Geophysical Year, 1957- 
58. This was the period of maximum 
sunspot activity, which provided the 
occasion for a systematic study of 
Planet Earth, its atmospheric envelope 
and of the cosmic influences upon it. 
Over 70 nations participated and the 
I.G.Y. Committee was responsible for 
the operation of more than 2,500 major 
scientific stations as well as thousands 
more temporary stations and observa- 
tion posts involving over 10,000 scien- 
tists and technicians as well as ama- 
teurs and volunteers. It embraced all 
the sciences, and organizations con- 
cerned with man’s physical world and 
its physical environment. The aggre- 
gation of data was so enormous that it 
will take a generation of scientists 
—even with computers—to work it all 
out. It is estimated that |.G.Y. cost 
$500,000,000 but what Unesco could 
afford served as the catalyst. 
Incidentally, the fantastic program- 
mes of space research now running 
at probably $8,000,000,000 a year be- 
gan modestly in |.G.Y. Rockets had 
been used for direct exploration of the 
atmosphere up to 250 miles and sev- 
eral hundred rockets were fired during 
.G.Y. by Australia, Canada, France, 
Great Britain, Japan, the United States 
and the Soviet Union. 
Data about pressures, temperatures 
and density of the atmosphere, par- 
ticles, radiations and fields were tele- 
metered back to earth during the 
rocket life-span of a few minutes. To 
overcome these limitations the 1.G.Y. 
included satellite vehicles in the pro- 
gramme and the U.S.A. and the 
U.S.S.R. agreed to produce them. In 
orbit, they were to make continuing 
observation, inwards and outwards. 
it was almost taken for granted that 
the U.S.A. with its enormous techno- 
logical potential would mount the first 
one, but the whole world was taken 
by surprise when Sputnik |, the Soviet 
satellite, was launched on October 4, 
1957, into an orbit from 64.3 deg. N. to 
64.3 deg. S. It weighed 184 Ibs. as 
against the 30 lbs. of the U.S. satellite 
which was not launched until three and 
a half months later. 
Alas, for the innocent intentions of 
LG.Y.! The weight and the orbit 
showed that the U.S.S.R. had power- 
ful rockets, and to spare. This led 
to loud cries about the “missile gap.” 
To close this alleged gap and to try to 
recover the lost prestige the U.S. 
embarked on a massive space pro- 
gramme. 
The Soviet Union followed suit and 
we have had intense space competi- 
tion ever since. 
Unesco was born into The Cyber- 
netic Age as well. Nuclear physics 
had exploded. Solid state physics 
erupted. The whole character of 
communications and the electronics of 
industrial processes were changed by 
semi-conductors and transistors which 
led to miniaturization of what would 
otherwise have been massive batteries 
of vacuum valves. The computer in

machine became a misnomer. Apart 
from doing impossible sums at incred- 
ible speeds, the computer began, 
with greater than human efficiency, to 
reproduce. the logical faculties of the 
brain and, through the ingenious sys- 
tems of cybernetic feedback, (automa- 
tic self adjustment) to control ma- 
chine processes. 
With all the combinations—an infal- 
lible memory, an unswerving logic, 
photo-electric cells more observant 
and more tireless than the human eye, 
microphones more sensitive than 
the human ear and electric nerve-end- 
ings more sensitive than the most 
skilled human touch—automation is 
replacing acquired experience. As the 
U.S. Secretary of Labour, Willard 
Wirtz, has pointed out, “The machine 
now has the equivalent abilities and 
skills of a student with a high school 
diploma.” 
Coveurens can design 
computers and control the 
machines that make computers and 
embody in successive generations of 
computers the experience of ancestral 
computers. 
At the Unesco Conference of Inform- 
ation Processing in 1959 at which 
nearly 2,000 electronic experts were 
gathered, | said to one of the greatest 
of them, “But you still cannot pro- 
duce the electronic equivalent of the 
human brain with its 15,000,000,000 
brain cells and their neuronic circuits”. 
His reply (verbatim) was “Don't be 
silly. | could put your brain with its 
cells and circuits on a plate five inches 
by six”. And he went on to explain 
that if you stacked such plates like a 
pack of cards and linked them up 
one could store, in a space no bigger 
than a cigar box, all the information in 
all the libraries in all the world. 
The only consolation he could offer 
was that they knew how to put in 
the information but did not yet know 
how to get it out! This input process 
depends on cryogenics or ultra-deep 
freeze. At temperatures near abso- 
ute zero certain metals lose all elec- 
trical resistance so filaments of them 
can be so fine that by comparison a 
spider's web would look like the gir- 
ders of Sydney Harbour Bridge, and 
“valves” could be no bigger than a 
brain cell. By reducing a printed 
circuit of the 15,000,000,000 cells to 
the dimensions of an electron-micro- 
scopic photograph it is possible to do 
what he claimed. 
Now, concurrent with The Atomic 
Age, The Cybernetic Age and The 
Space Age, we have The DNA Age. 
The “life sciences” are now claiming 
attention and appropriations on a scale

once reserved to the physical scien- 
ces. Molecular biology is now all 
the vogue. With the discovery of the 
structures of deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), the 
basic chemicals of the living cell, we 
have the clue to the secret of life. 
In the arrangement of the atoms 
in the molecules of DNA and RNA is 
the “information code” which “pro- 
grammes” not only the nature and 
behaviour of the cells in the body 
but determines the hereditary traits 
passed on from one generation to 
the next. It is predictable that we 
shall be able to change, by man’s 
prescriptions, the nature of living pro- 
cesses and of posterity.

countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are expanding and improving 
teaching facilities in the basic sciences, a prerequisite of economic and 
social development. Unesco has helped its member states to set up 
science institutes, research laboratories and centres for the design and 
construction of scientific equipment. Today Unesco aids nearly 
50 projects for setting up and operating technological and 
professional training institutes in some 30 countries.

Hundreds of brilliant scientists are 
now ingeniously employed in molecu- 
lar biology but what is needed are 
people to sit down and think what we 
are going to do with the secret of 
life when we get it. What we first 
did with the secret of matter—nuclear 
energy—is not encouraging. 
All this is spectacular and awe- 
inspiring proof of Man's unlimited 
ingenuity. But how, in Unesco’s terms 
of reference which include, not only 
the acquisition of knowledge, but the 
use of that knowledge, can we apply 
science to the betterment of the condi- 
tions of mankind? 
The humanitarian sciences have also 
had spectacular results. Just as we 
can date the atomic explosion as July 
1945 so we might date the population 
explosion as February 1935. Then 
a desperate father, Dr. Domagk, inject- 
ed a red dye, the drug Prontosil, into 
the veins of his daughter, Hildegarde. 
She had generalized septicaemia and 
her case seemed hopeless. She 
recovered. 
That was the first of the sulpha 
drugs which not only had an intrinsic 
value but reminded the medical pro- 
fession and medical science of what 
Ehrlich had demonstrated in 1911, 
when he showed that it was possible, 
with salvasan, to kill specific germs 
within the human body. Until then any 
antiseptic which could destroy germs 
in open wounds was fatal if ingested. 
With this reminder from the sulpha 
drugs, Fleming's penicillin (1928) was 
rediscovered and perfected, as the 
drug we now know, by Chain and 
Florey, who recognized that it could 
inhibit germs within the human body. 
More lives have since been saved by 
penicillin and its kindred antibiotics 
than have been lost in all the wars 
of all human history. 
Then, with D.D.T. we gained the 
means of controlling the insect-carriers 
of diseases such as malaria. 
By the combination, and refinement, 
of such means it has been possible to 
reduce the mortality from mass infec- 
tions, to save mothers in childbirth to 
have more chidren; to save infants 
and toddlers to grow up, to marry and 
to multiply; and to extend the span 
of life. Today, as a result of science 
there are 170,000 more mouths to be 
fed every day. 
It has taken mankind, (if we date 
from the hominids) a million years 
to reach the present figure of 
3,250,000,000; it will, on present trends, 
take thirty years to double that. Some- 
how death control has to be offset 
by the control of reproduction. But 
at the same time we have to feed a 
population of which already two-thirds 
are underfed and we have to provide 
for those who are still to come. 
If science could be as imaginative 
and resourceful in providing for the 
needs of human beings as in its great 
physical achievements the imminent 
future would not seem so forbidding.

TWO DECADES OF SCIENCE (Continued) 
At the United Nations Conference 
on Science and Technology in Geneva 
in 1963 it was abundantly clear that 
even if we only applied what we al- 
ready knew the needs of mankind 
could be met. It is not a question of 
knowledge; it is a question of intention. 
Unesco, concerned with knowledge 
and research has addressed itself to 
these long term problems. Its major ail 
project of a few years ago, The Arid ps 
Zone Project, brought together some 
27 disciplines to study the nature of 
deserts and their potential for devel- 
opment. By inter-relating specialist 
knowledge, it enthused the scientists 
who took part into a new breed of 
“desert experts”. Botanists became 
professional about hydrology. Geo- 
physicists became fascinated by the 
peculiarities of desert plants. And so 
on. The results were novel and im- 
pressive and, if applied, hopeful—like 
the desert agriculture promoted by | 
the discovery of great aquifers beneath > 
the Sahara and the Egyptian deserts. pw. A 
The Hydrological Decade initiated by proc pi wd - 
Unesco deals with one of the great N 
threats confronting the multiplying © 
population, the lack of water in many 
places and the abuse of water in 
others. Nothing so reveals the ignor- 
ance, the recklessness and selfish- 
ness even of nations abounding in

vital resource.

some $15 million in an average year. Its outstanding achievements include: the

1 HE extraordinary advance 
of science and technology 
in the past 20 years astounds us all. 
Spectacular discoveries come crowd- 
ing one after the other, and almost 
as swiftly are put to practical use. 
Many people who can still remember 
the time when a motor car was a 
rare spectacle already regard the 
launching of satellites and spacecraft 
as an everyday affair. And no doubt 
they will live to see astronauts mak- 
ing round trips to the moon and, who 
knows, to more distant planets as well. 
International contacts, important in 
the development of any branch of 
learning, and particularly science, have 
increased enormously in the past few 
decades. These years have seen the

creation of a great number of inter- 
national scientific associations, unions 
and committees, whose activities in 
many cases are co-ordinated by 
Unesco. 
Progress in science and progress 
in technology are interdependent. 
That one cannot advance without the 
other is demonstrated in some newly- 
independent countries which have 
lagged behind in these fields. These 
nations, which are now members of 
the U.N. and Unesco, are determin- 
ed to overcome their handicaps and 
are eager to set about transforming 
their industry and agriculture and 
their science and technology as rap- 
idly as possible. But to do so, they 
need schools, technical institutes and 
research laboratories, as well as the 
benefit of the technological experience 
acquired by the economically develop- 
ed nations. 
Many of these young nations re- 
cently freed from colonial domination 
have joined Unesco, and their arrival 
has made an impact on the whole of

Unesco’s programme, particularly its 
promotion of international scientific co- 
operation. 
International co-operation is in- 
dispensable to all branches of science, 
but the need for it is perhaps greatest 
of all in the earth sciences. Studies 
in this field are concerned with natural 
phenomena in the atmosphere, in the 
seas and on the land areas of our 
planet and therefore affect all peoples 
and demand a co-operative effort by 
scientists of all nationalities. 
World science has long recognized 
the importance of an international 
partnership to carry out research in 
geophysics, meteorology, oceanogra- 
phy and related fields. This co-opera- 
tion began with the organization of the 
First Polar Year of 1882-83, during 
which 11 countries made joint mete- 
orological, geomagnetic and auroral 
observations at 14 stations in the

NEW OUTPOSTS OF SCIENCE (Continued) 
Micro-man against a macro-world 
countries participated. And Internation- 
al co-operation in science reached an 
historic peak in the International 
Geophysical Year of 1957-58 when 
scientists of more than 60 nations 
collaborated closely in a vast global 
research programme. Today, under 
the sponsorship and encouragement 
of Unesco, many countries are making 
joint studies of the oceans, seismic 
phenomena, the earth's crust and other 
aspects of our planet. 
The expansion of international co- 
operation in the earth sciences is proof 
that humanity has now reached a new 
and vitally important stage in its 
relations with nature, The interaction 
between society and nature, which 
began when man became conscious of 
his own “self”, is an indispensable 
condition of human progress. In the 
beginning, the human race, weak and 
helpless, was exposed to the elemental 
forces of nature. Hard work and col- 
lective action enabled man to protect 
himself against the elements—and 
then to master them. 
What stage in this development have 
we reached today? 
The primitive conceptions of the 
world came from limited observations. 
Within these limits each tribe visualiz- 
ed the earth, rivers, forests and 
mountains. Since then the boundaries 
of the known world have expanded 
until they now extend to the farthest 
galaxy whose distance can be measur- 
ed—some 1022 km (10,000,000,000,000, 
000,000,000 kilometres). 
Te human mind has also 
probed inwards to pene- 
trate another sphere. Man has spe- 
culated for thousands of years about 
the nature of matter, the smallest 
elements of which substances are 
formed. But it was not until compar- 
atively recently—less than a hundred 
years ago—that he acquired a more 
or less correct understanding of mole- 
cules and then of atoms. And not 
until the past decade has he discover- 
ed the secrets of atomic nucleii and 
of the even tinier fundamental part- 
icles. 
What is the smallest measurement 
known to man? It is apparently the 
distance at which the weak interaction 
of the particles of an atomic nucleus 
occurs; estimated at 10—22 (.000,000, 
000,000,000,000,000,01 of a centimetre). 
How curious that we should have 
reached out approximately as far in 
the directions of the macrocosm and 
the microcosm alike. 
Man's mind has also measured 
processes occurring with infinite slow- 
ness and phenomena lasting fractions 
of a second. The longest period of 
time that can be measured by modern 
science is approximately 101° years 
(10,000,000,000 years}—the maximum 
age of certain stars and galaxies. At 
the other extreme, the shortest phe- 
nomenon is the length of life of certain 
fundamental particles which are timed 
at 10-19 sec. (.000,000,000,01 of a 
second). 
Such, in highly simplified form, are 
the present scales of space and time 
with which we work. 
Our knowledge of the universe now 
reveals the earth to be a mere speck of 
dust in the immensity of space. Yet our 
knowledge of our own planet is far 
from complete. We have explored 
its surface; we are familiar with pro- 
cesses that affect the atmosphere and 
the oceans. But our knowledge of its 
internal structure, of the processes 
going on within it and of its actual 
origin is still largely hypothetical. 
What then is the measure of our 
control over nature? Obviously, the 
extent of our exploitation of natural 
resources and the amount of power 
we can harness to our needs can serve 
as criteria. 
Thousands of years ago man lived 
without even being aware of deposits 
of iron ore or oil. And only quite 
recently have we realized the value of 
uranium reserves, Today there is scar- 
cely a single element which is not 
utilized for one purpose or another. 
Many sources of natural wealth are 
being exploited so rapidly that there 
are fears they may be exhausted. Even 
fresh water is in short supply in cer- 
tain regions. 
Our own individual muscular efforts 
enable us to generate the power of 
a few score watts; this for thousands 
of years was all the power man had 
at his disposal. A few dozen persons 
could thus produce perhaps 10 kilo- 
watts. 
Our regular sources of power— 
electric generating plants, engines, 
etc.—can now produce approximately 
1,000 million kilowatts. The power 
that man could obtain sporadically by 
firing all his rockets or systematically 
setting off atomic explosions, is 
greater by two or three orders of 
magnitude. How does this compare 
with the energy produced by nature? 
Practically all the elemental proces- 
ses occurring on the earth's surface, 
in the atmosphere and in the oceans 
derive from solar energy. Over the 
whole of the hemisphere reached by 
the sun, this energy totals approxim- 
ately 1013 kw (10,000,000,000,000 kilo- 
watts). 
This means that the sun provides 
us with energy representing a sizeable. 
fraction of—or sometimes almost as 
much as—the energy generated by 
the processes occurring in the earth's 
atmosphere and hydrosphere. If pro- 
gress continues at the same rate (and 
it is likely to accelerate still further), 
200. years from now we shall possess 
continuous power sources of some 
1013 kilowatts. 
Thus, we have now reached a stage 
at which man is able to exploit a 
large proportion of the earth's natural 
riches, and has at his disposal energy 
comparable in amount to that possess- 
ed by the elements throughout the 
whole of the planet. 
Such a situation poses a number 
of important and intriguing problems. 
Will Nature's resources suffice for 
mankind? Natural resources are not 
inexhaustible after all, and the earth's 
population is growing rapidly. 
Le us suppose that a 
calculation had been made 
in 1850 of the amount of energy 
that could have been produced per 
head of population using all the means 
then available; the resuit would have 
been about 10,000 kilowatt-hours. A 
hundred years later, in 1950, the figure 
would have been 200,000 kWh. par 
person, despite the increase in the 
earth's population in the interval. The 
explanation lies in the discovery of 
many new sources of energy and in 
improved methods of transforming 
them. 
Per capita resources of foods and 
materials have increased in much the 
same way. Despite the dwindling re- 
serves of natural resources, the pos- 
sibilities for satisfying ail of man’s 
basic needs have actually increased 
with every century—with every year, 
in fact—thanks to the discovery of 
more and more resources and the 
steady progress made in the means 
of exploiting them. This state of 
affairs is likely to continue—at least 
in the foreseeable future. 
The future will also see the harnes-

We know very little about the inner structure of our planet and the processes going 
on within it. To promote the training of seismologists and earthquake engineers and the 
observation of earth tremors, Unesco established the International Institute of Seismology and 
Earthquake Engineering in Tokyo, and is now setting up a seismological centre for Latin 
America in Lima (Peru). Unesco also founded the Institute for Volcanology at Catania (Sicily). 11 
It has supported international programmes in geophysics and astronomy, and it met one-third 
of the cost of launching the recent International Years of the Quiet Sun research 
project. Above, a vast outcrop of rock laid bare by wind erosion.

sing of thermonuclear energy, solar 
energy, tidal energies and the power 
created by ocean currents, and even 
the utilization of geothermal energy. 
As for food, cattle raising requires 
twenty times less space than hunting, 
agriculture twenty times less again. 
Agriculture is becoming increasingly 
productive and its possibilities are far 
from exhausted. Furthermore, the 
food potential of the sea is far 
greater than what we take from it 
today. And modern chemistry has 
begun to produce synthetic foodstuffs. 
Thus, limitations of the earth's natural 
resources are not an insurmountable 
obstacle to human development. 
Since man first mastered agriculture, 
he has always chosen a small part 
of his natural environment (a field, a 
garden, a herd of cattle) and has 
cultivated it intensively. His attitude to 
the rest of nature—which he regarded 
as being wild, encroaching and in- 
exhaustible—was quite different, and 
he plundered it with no thought for 
the conservation of its rich resources. 
Marx, in one of his letters, noted 
that “cultivation, when it develops 
unmethodically, leaves nothing but 
desert.” Massive deforestation has 
laid waste entire regions and disturbed 
the normal balance of the water cycle. 
The misuse of soil has led to dust 
storms and the erosion of fertile layers 
of earth. And certain species of ani- 
mals and fish used for food have 
been decimated. 
T HIS abuse of nature must 
clearly stop. Concern for 
the husbanding of natural resources 
is gradually becoming the rule—at 
least within the bounds of each coun- 
try; but it has not yet been extended 
to the “common land” —the atmosphere 
and the seas as a whole. Today, the 
vast demands on the common natural 
resources of the world combined with 
improved techniques for exploiting 
them, have made it imperative to aban- 
don this “predatory” attitude towards 
nature. We must learn to treat all 
the natural riches of the world with 
the same respect we have for our 
own gardens, fields or herds. 
Modern technology allows us not 
only to make wide use of natural re- 
sources but also, in many cases, to 
change and improve them. Whereas 
for centuries fish were bred in ponds, 
during the past decade they have 
been “cultivated” in lakes and parts 
of the sea. Surely the time has come 
to consider a rational plan for the fish- 
ing industry, covering all the oceans. 
In my opinion the rational utilization 
of basic natural resources in the in- 
terest of mankind as a whole should 
be one of Unesco’s most important

“We are not asking for dolls and toy trains for our children. 
What they need is a pencil to write with, a slate for doing sums, 
a book to read.” The significance of this appeal by a delegate 
from Rwanda to a Unesco General Conference becomes abundantly 
clear in the light of world statistics on education. Fifty-two 
percent of children of school age are still deprived of education 
because of the lack of schools or teachers. Yet much has been 
accomplished in the first five years (1960-65) of the U.N. 
Development Decade. By 1965, 180 million children in the develop- 
ing countries were enrolled in primary and secondary schools— 
71 million more than in 1960. For the first time, the rate of 
increase of school enrolments in the world has outstripped the 
rate of population increase.

Nature in ‘mobile equilibrium’ 
more and more land is being subjected 
to these improvements. 
How do we know what changes 
will occur in nature as a result of the 
further development of industry, agri- 
culture and land improvement? We 
know what their general nature will 
be, but we cannot yet predict their 
magnitude. The chief difficulty is that 
the natural environment is not a static 
structure but a complex of processes 
in a state of “mobile equilibrium.” 
Of particular interest are those 
occurring in the atmosphere and hydro- 
sphere, the pattern of which has long 
been known: the sun heats the earth's 
surface, which in turn heats the 
atmosphere—principally in the tropical 
zone; the warm air rises and, in the 
upper strata of the atmosphere, moves 
toward the polar regions; there it cools, 
sinks, and moves back towards the 
equatorial belt. 
This simple pattern is made more 
complicated by the rotation of the 
earth, by the distribution of the con- 
tinents and oceans, and by the pres- 
ence of mountain ranges. All these 
combine to create the system of move- 
ments known as “general circulation”, 
which is also linked with the circulation 
of ocean waters. The atmosphere and 
the hydrosphere are so closely associ- 
ated that every movement in one is 
communicated to the other. The two 
are linked by the water cycle which 
constantly modifies the earth's surface 
by washing out and transporting matter 
from one place to another. 
Weer changes are caus- 
ed by fluctuations in the 
lower atmosphere. The relative stabil- 
ity of the climate shows that despite 
these fluctuations the hydrometeoro- 
logical processes are in a state of 
equilibrium, but we know that the 
world's climate has not remained the 
same throughout its history, Its evolu- 
tion suggests that more than one 
“mobile equilibrium” is possible, and 
that there have probably been several 
at various periods in the earth’s history. 
We have heard of sudden “explo- 
sions” occurring in the population of 
certain species of animals and insects 
from time to time. Studies show that 
they are most often due to abnormally 
sharp fluctuations in atmospheric or 
oceanic conditions. 
These shifts may result in the dis- 
appearance of certain organisms and 
an increase in the numbers of other 
species which possibly served as food 
for the ones destroyed. Once started, 
these fluctuations may pass from one 
process to another and fade out gra- 
dually, or else they may increase 
through a kind of chain reaction. 
We know that certain processes on 
earth can influence one another, but 
we still do not know to what extent. 
Man himself is exerting a growing in- 
fluence on his environment and before 
very long this could give cause for 
alarm. If we interfere with the compli- 
cated system of natural phenomena, 
we may start processes which could 
develop, through a chain reaction, and 
produce disastrous consequences. 
SIDE from these dangers, 
however, the periodic ins- 
tability of natural processes does open 
up interesting possibilities for re- 
search. Could we modify the existing 
equilibrium in nature for our benefit? 
Scientists have already tried out var- 
jous experiments on the weather, in- 
cluding the sowing of dry ice on clouds 
to produce rain. 
In my view, artificial transformations 
of the climate can hardly be consider- 
ed as one of man's practical objectives 
in the immediate future. But the effect 
of man's activities on the climate and 
other facets of our environment, today 
and in the near future, poses a crucial 
problem. There is no doubt that it 
is an international one, too, because 
of the nature of the research involved 
and the implications of its results. 
We are approaching the point where 
mankind will be compelled to make 
practical use of all the resources the 
earth has to offer and where man will 
be in a position to control fundamental 
processes on a worldwide scale. In 
short, man will soon become the 
master of the earth. (It is perhaps no 
mere chance that at this stage man 
is reaching out into space.) 
Need one point out that at such 
a moment in its development society 
ought to act as a single community? 
It is one of the major tasks of Unesco 
to co-ordinate the efforts of mankind 
in the conquest of nature and the 
rational utilization of natural wealth 
for the benefit of all nations. In 
this task, Unesco can well draw in- 
spiration from its own ideals: the 
maintenance of peace, and the pro- 
motion of the freedom, independence 
and progress of all peoples.

### 2579: Two decades in the world of education

24 
TH historian of humanity 
in the last twenty years 
will note two things of especial signi- 
ficance. The first no doubt will be 
that this was the beginning of the age 
of nuclear power, in which mankind 
narrowly escaped destruction through 
its own invention. But, assuming that 
mankind continues to escape such self- 
destruction, the most significant fea- 
ture that the historian will note is that 
this was first period in human history 
in which the claim had been made, 
and conceded, that every single human 
being had a right to education. That 
there has been an education “explo- 
sion” in the last twenty years is not 
a metaphor; it is a fact. 
In saying this | am speaking not of 
provision, but of demand. In every 
country in the world now the demand 
for education—for schools and col- 
leges, equipment and teachers—far 
outstrips what it has been actually 
possible to provide. Even the affluent 
countries have been unable to provide 
as much as their peoples have de- 
manded. 
The less affluent countries, in spite 
of heavily increased spending on edu- 
cation and on foreign aid, have found 
it intensely difficult to cope with the 
increased demand at every level, prim- 
ary, secondary, higher and adult edu- 
cation. And both kinds of countries 
 
LIONEL ELVIN, director of the Institute of 
Education, University of London, is consid- 
ered as one of the world's authorities on 
comparative education. He was formerly 
director of the Unesco Department of 
Education. 
   EDUCATION 
by Lionel Elvin 
have found the greatest difficulty in 
deciding on right priorities within the 
educational budget, how much to 
spend on trying to get primary educa- 
tion for every child, how much to 
spend on secondary education, how 
much on the colleges and the univer-- 
sities, how much on trying to wipe out 
adult illiteracy and on other forms 
of adult education. 
What is the explanation of this 
demand for education? Essentially the’ 
demand comes from two things: first 
that education is everyone's right, and 
second that an expanded education is 
indispensable for the kind of economic 
and social modernization that every- 
one desires. 
The right was enshrined in the Uni- 
versal Declaration of Rights, which 
came at the beginning of this period

For these school children 
(climbing a special metallic scaffolding 
designed for play and 
exercises) the right to education 
is a reality. But for millions of other 
children it is still merely a hope. 
By 1970 places will need to be 
found in the primary schools of Africa, 
Asia and Latin America for a further 
52 million children. This means 
that 850,000 more teachers 
will be required. Unesco 
and the International Institute 
of Educational Planning, which it 
set up in Paris, are redoubling 
their efforts to help governments 
to train teachers and build schools, 
to improve educational planning and 
administration and to allocate more 
funds to education. Despite 
achievements in recent years, a wide 
educational gap still exists between 
developed and developing nations.

### 2579: Two decades in the world of education

26 
TWO DECADES OF EDUCATION (Continued) 
The new philosophy of investment 
in our history. Article 26 said that 
everyone had the right to free primary 
education and to education beyond 
this stage in accordance with ability 
and not family wealth or status. Now 
it should be noted that the Declaration 
said not that this was an absolute 
right—it could not be absolute but 
must be contingent on the capacity of 
countries to afford it and in the higher 
ranges on the capacity of students to 
profit reasonably from it—but that it 
was universal: that is to say that it 
was a right of every human being as 
a human being. 
R IGHTS have been defined 
as claims that must be 
accepted because without their 
acceptance a person or group of 
persons cannot function properly. It 
has been recognized internationally 
that without education a human being 
cannot realize his potentiality, cannot 
be in a reasonable sense a full human 
being and live a full life. There are 
of course still people, individuals and 
groups, subdued by the unequal past, 
who do not yet realize this. But the 
peoples, the ordinary people of the 
world’s countries, do in a broad but 
most pressing sense. The result has 
been a tremendous demand for schools 
and higher and adult education. 
Secondly, the politically and socially 
conscious people 
understand that a prosperous economy 
based on modern technology depends 
on a widespread general education 
and well-developed professional and 
technical education a d training. Fur- 
thermore, countries that have gained 
their political independence during this 
period (and they constitute a large 
proportion of the members of the 
United Nations and of Unesco and the 
other specialized agencies) have real- 
ized how important education is for 
good government and administration 
and for the participation of their citi- 
zens in public and professional life. 
The idea that expenditure on educa- 
tion does not only satisfy those who 
benefit from it as individual “consum- 
ers” but is also personal and national 
“investment” has gained ground and 
during these two decades has become 
accepted philosophy. 
These two pressures, then, have 
been behind the educational demand 
of the last twenty years the world over. 
But how far have we been able to 
satisfy the demand in practice?  
in every country . 
One of the functions of Unesco is 
to collect and analyse statistics of 
education for the world as a whole. 
This is a very difficult business. So 
incomplete are the statistics that one 
must at times estimate rather than 
announce firm figures. The compila- 
tion of world totals is notoriously 
difficult because the basis for them 
(for instance in the structure of educa- 
tional systems and the meanings of 
terms that are used) varies so much 
from one country to another. And the 
publication of analysed figures must 
inevitably always lag behind the 
passage of the calendar years. Yet 
something informative does emerge. 
The World Survey of Education, 1957- 
1961, gives some of the figures for 
these years and enables us to see 
significant trends. 
For world purposes Unesco recog- 
nizes three levels of formal educa- 
tion: the first level (primary or elemen- 
tary school); the second level, based 
on at least four years’ education at the 
first level (high school, secondary 
school, vocational school, etc); and 
the third level, after successful comple- 
tion of the second level (university, 
teachers college, higher professional 
school). Now in these four years 
only the increase in enrolments was 
23 per cent at the first level, 23 per 
cent at the second level and 35 per 
cent at the third level (let me repeat: 
this was in only four years out of the 
twenty we are considering). 
But there is a catch in these figures. 
The world population has also in- 
creased, and sensationally, during 
these twenty years. What is the 
increase of enrolments in relation to 
the increase in population? Here the

The percentage of the total population

The field of education is in worldwide ferment. Drastic changes are made 
in school programmes and in teaching methods. This in turn calls 
for changes in the training of teachers including their introduction to such 
new educational aids as closed-circuit television and learning machines. 
Methods of teaching foreign languages, and of the mother tongue, are under- 
going radical change. Here youngsters in a Tokyo primary school learn Japan-

Education at all levels is now seen as an indivisible whole. A lack of secondary schools leads to a shortage 
of primary level teachers, for example, and insufficient higher education means that not enough 
secondary level teachers will be trained. To help its member states to plan for the rational and 
efficient development of education at all levels, Unesco has set up regional centres in Beirut and New Delhi 
and educational planning sections at Santiago de Chile, Dakar and Bangkok. At the request of 
many countries it has sent out consultative missions on educational planning. With the International 
Association of Universities it has surveyed problems of higher education. At this level a big development 
is foreseen for the next four years: 40,000 more students in Africa, 250,000 in Latin America and 
1,000,000 in Asia. Photo shows part of the campus at the strikingly modern University of Dakar (Senegal).

THE FUTURE 
FOR 200,000 ARAB 
REFUGEE CHILDREN 
Over 200,000 Palestine refugee children are now 
attending hundreds of primary and secondary 
schools run by some 5,000 teachers under 
the technical supervision of Unesco. Launched 
in 1950 by Unesco and UNRWA (United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) 
the programme is using education and voca- 
tional training to build a future for the children 
of Palestine refugees. It is the largest opera- 
tional activity in which Unesco is at present 
engaged. In many parts of the world Unesco 
is carrying on activities of an operational nature 
in collaboration with other institutions (Unicef, 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, the World Food Programme) as 
part of its educational programme. Above, a

the average child only a slightly better 
chance than before. If the world popu- 
lation continues to increase at its pre- 
sent rate we cannot hope to get every 
child into school or wipe out adult illit- 
eracy within the present century. That 
is a sobering thought. 
Because resources are desperately 
scarce in relation to what the countries 
and their peoples now both need and 
desire there has to be planning. This 
is the next distinctive feature of edu- 
cational development in this period that 
we must note. Education must be 
planned in relation to national plan- 
ning, if only to decide how much of a 
country’s resources go into education 
as distinct from other things like roads 
and railways and air transport, indus- 
trial development of all kinds, and 
other social services such as medicine 
and public health. 
And there must be planning in edu- 
cation to see that it is of the scale 
and kind that fit into the stage of a 
country’s economic and social devel- 
opment. It is wasteful to spend large 
sums on the education of persons for 
whom there is no subsequent appro- 
priate employment, who cannot be 
absorbed into the economy and the 
professions. There must be priorities 
established within education. 
M OST people at the beginn- 
ing of the period probably 
thought that the first thing should no 
doubt be to make primary education 
universal and free. But there has been 
a significant shift of opinion during the 
period. To begin with, you cannot 
have adequate teachers for primary 
schools unless you have given them 
secondary education. And a measure 
of secondary education is indispens- 
able for getting the “middle grades” 
who will help to run the economy, as 
well as to prepare students for higher 
education. Clearly there must also be 
some higher education. 
So the concept of phasing the devel- 
opment of all three levels together 
has been worked out, often at the 
regional conferences that Unesco has 
called to consider the planning of edu- 
cational development in the different 
parts of the world. With a certain 
level of resources it should be pos- 
sible to have a given high percentage 
of children in the primary schools, a 
given smaller percentage in the secon- 
dary schools and a given still smaller 
TWO DECADES OF EDUCATION (Continued) 
Educational re-thinking in ferment 
percentage in higher education. The 
setting of these targets in relation both 
to national needs and to each other is 
a difficult and delicate task. 
It is in this work, as much perhaps 
as in the furnishing of direct aid, that 
Unesco has helped its member states 
most in recent years. These years 
have marked something of a swing in 
the objectives of Unesco from inter- 
national intellectual co-operation at the 
scholarly level (though that continues} 
towards helping the less affluent coun- 
tries to develop their education, with- 
out which they hardly can co-oper- 
ate at that high level. And within the 
aid activity more and more attention 
has been paid to the various aspects 
of educational planning, Unesco acting 
both through its departments and 
through the International Institute for 
Educational Planning which is its “stud- 
ies” arm. 
Now all that has been said in this 
article so far is “quantitative”. But 
what about the education itself, and its 
quality? A no less significant feature 
of these last twenty years (and espe- 
cially of the second decade) has been 
the attention given to what is taught 
and to how it is taught at the different 
levels of education. Here we realize 
(though it is indeed evident from the 
quantitative pressures we have dis- 
cussed) that we are in the presence 
of a social and economic transforma- 
tion which sets up inevitable educa- 
tional demands. 
General education at the first level 
in what are now the “advanced” coun- 
tries came in with the development of 
industry. This may have had within 
it the seeds of social transformation 
but it did not seem very revolutionary 
at first. Secondary and higher educa- 
tion remained reserved for those who 
would play a more privileged or more 
responsible role in society. The curric- 
ulum of the elementary schools aimed 
at giving the barely necessary general 
skills to the workers in an increasingly 
industrialized society. 
But, even economically, this has 
proved in the present century to be not 
enough. Socially it has proved too 
limited to be acceptable. A great 
range of new occupations has opened 
up, needing both better general edu- 
cation and more varied education. 
With the generalization of at least the 
first half of secondary education, this 
has resulted in a much more varied 
and rather differently based curriculum 
in the secondary schools, and the 
curriculum of the primary schools has 
been seen as leading on to this in 
terms of genuine education, not just 
instruction in rudimentary general 
skills. Now the secondary school 
curriculum is being radically trans- 
formed, in terms simply of subjects 
taught. 
But the content of the subjects is 
also under review as well as the 
balance of studies. This is connected 
with new methods of teaching. We 
talk now of the “new mathematics,” of 
a re-thought out secondary school 
physics, chemistry, and biology. Meth- 
ods of teaching foreign languages, 
and of the mother tongue, are under- 
going radical change. This in turn 
calls for changes in the training of 
teachers, and not least in their intro- 
duction to the use of educational aids 
(from television to learning machines) 
that were not thought of seriously for 
educational purposes at the beginning 
of our period. 
F OR newly independent 
countries, and other count- 
ries that are less affluent than the 
“advanced” countries, this has set 
very difficult problems indeed. Some 
of them have had to free themselves 
not only from methods that are outmod- 
ed (for instance, from a centuries-old 
tradition of learning by rote under an 
authoritarian teacher) but from a curri- 
culum that was almost entirely appro- 
priate, not to their own people and 
their needs, but to a foreign adminis- 
tering power and its citizens at home. 
Not least this has led to questions 
about the relationship between what is 
taught and the immediate environment 
and the work in it. Should not agri- 
cultural education, for instance, have 
a quite new impetus in countries 
whose prosperity will depend for some 
time to come much more on modern- 
izing agriculture than on the develop- 
ment, say, of heavy industry? 
With all these factors at work—the 
demand for education as a universal 
right and as a national need, the prob- 
lems of coherent planning with scarce 
resources, the need to change the 
curriculum at all levels and greatly to 
improve methods of teaching—no one 
can say that the last twenty years in 
the educational history of mankind 
have been dull. There have been 
immense problems, and immense prob- 
lems remain, But with all that, the 
old phrase is significantly and immen- 
sely true: educationally, humanity is 
now on the march.

T is not so long since “cul- 
ture”, in the singular, was 
fundamentally a creation of the West. 
From Europe, ideas, philosophy, art 
and civilization radiated to other parts 
of the world, and the echoes awaken- 
ed by their messages were regarded 
as the world's responses to “culture”. 
In the last twenty years we have 
passed from the notion of culture in 
the singular to that of cultures in the 
plural. We have come to realize that 
cultures exist which are not European 
and this wider view of the world has 
opened the way to an unprecedented 
process of democratization. 
The messages no longer come from 
Europe alone; they come and go in 
all directions, intersecting, contradict-

Every year folk art groups from India, 
the Soviet Union, Mexico, Bali, Ru-

Unesco has promoted knowledge and appreciation of cultural values throughout

of knowledge: travelling art exhibitions, albums of colour reproductions and art 
paperbacks, translations of representative works. In 1957, Unesco launched its Major 
Project for mutual appreciation of Eastern and Western cultural values which 
brought a new reality to the idea of international understanding. The project has 
fostered studies by research institutes, universities and scholars and has helped 
to establish institutes of Oriental studies in Tokyo, New Delhi, Beirut, Cairo 
and Damascus. It has also encouraged the improvement of curricula and textbooks 
and has stimulated the translation of a large number of classical and contemporary 
works from the Orient. Photo shows a calligraphy contest taking place in Japan,

place exists in the systems worked 
out by European thinkers of the last 
century for the ways and experiences 
of the remote countries. 
Since Columbus crossed the Atlan- 
tic and Vespucci announced the ap- 
pearance of an unknown continent, 
people have talked of the “discovery” 
of a New World. At the end of the 
eighteenth century it was acknowledg- 
ed that what had been “discovered” 
three hundred years before, in fact 
had still to be discovered. So men 
of science of that day began to explore 
the mysteries of the national history 
of America...at a time when the Swe- 
dish botanist, Carl Linnaeus was “dis- 
covering” the plants of Scandinavia 
and of Europe in general. 
We thus see that the process of 
discovery repeats itself and that from 
time to time men are amazed to find 
how little they really know. Then, 
they begin to re-explore the world 
around them, and to discover it anew, 
as though entering some virgin forest. 
The past twenty years have been

### 4362: History of mankind

HISTORY 
OF MANKIND 
One of the great tasks Unesco set itself in the past twenty years has been the 
preparation of a six-tome History of Mankind on science and culture. 
In 1951 Unesco established an International Commission for an International History 
of the Scientific and Cultural Development of Mankind to supervise the work of 
the historians and scholars from many countries who were to prepare the History. 
Volume | of the History of Mankind, dealing with prehistory and the beginnings 
of civilization, was the work of two renowned archaeologists, Jacquetta Hawkes 
and Sir Leonard Woolley. It was published in 1963 in London (George Allen and 
Unwin, Ltd.) and in New York (Harper and Row, Inc.). In 1966, Unesco’s 20th anni- 
versary year, it is being made widely available in other languages. A Serbo-Croat 
edition has been published in Zagreb and a Greek language edition (50,000 copies) 
is being published in Athens in weekly instalments with colour plates. A Spanish 
language version (Editorial Sudamericana, S.A., Buenos Aires) has just been 
published, and a French edition (Robert Laffont, Paris) will appear later this year. 
Translations into Hebrew, Italian, Japanese and Slovinian are also planned. 
Volume | has also appeared in paperback form, in two parts, in the United States 
(a first printing of 150,000 copies by The New American Library, Inc.—Mentor 
Books). A collection of paperbacks under thé general title of Readings in the 
History of Mankind Series (edited by Guy S. Métraux and Frangois Crouzet) is 
also being published (100,000 copies) in the Mentor Books series. These paper- 
backs are based on articles which have appeared in the Journal of World History 
(the review published by the International Commission for a History of Mankind). 
The first four titles, published between 1963 and 1965, are The Evolution of Science, 
The Nineteenth Century World, The New Asia, and Religions and the Promise of the 
Twentieth Century. Another publication based on the same sources, Studies in 
the Cultural History of India, has appeared in Agra, India, and a Hindi translation 
is in preparation. 
The Ancient World, Volume II of the History of Mankind (a set three books), by 
Luigi Pareti, Paolo Brezzi and Luciano Petech, was published in English last year, 
and a third volume, The Twentieth Century (actually Volume VI in the series), by 
Caroline F. Ware, K.M. Panikkar and J.M. Romein, is to be published in London 
tater this year (see the Unesco Courier, June 1963, May 1965).

TWO DECADES OF CULTURE (Continued) 
A post-war phenomenon — international tourism 
Negro art has been influencing other 
arts since the beginning of the cen- 
tury, particularly sculpture, ballet and 
certain types of music, but culturally 
Africa is still an undiscovered conti- 
nent. 
This was emphasized recently at the 
Festival of Negro Art, in Dakar, by 
the Negro poet, Leopold Sedar Sen- 
ghor, President of Senegal, and by 
the writer, André Malraux, France's 
Minister of Culture. Now, on the 
initiative of Unesco, a General History 
of Africa is to be written, as though 
for the first time, and the work will 
take ten years to complete. In almost 
all the nations of the African continent, 
technical and scientific institutes are 
springing up, while more and more 
flags of these newly-independent states 
are being hoisted at United Nations 
headquarters. For Africa the era of 
rediscovery is beginning. And for 
other continents too—even for Europe 
itself. 
What has happened in space has 
also happened in time. The expanding 
frontiers of history have overrun terri- 
tory that until now belonged to prehis- 
tory, and the modern passion for 
archaeology has merged with the 
attractions of tourist travel. Ordinary 
people, who in other circumstances 
would have always been denied such 
stimulating experiences, now file in 
wonder past the ruins of temples, 
cities and civilizations—grandiose 
spectacles which open up new hori- 
zons for eye and mind alike. The 
response to Unesco's campaign to 
safeguard the monuments of Nubia 
shows beyond doubt that a universal 
interest has been awakened in art and 
archaeology. 
The present use of archaeologic- 
al sites as settings for music, danc- 
ing, opera and drama and the Son 
et Lumiére performances against the 
background of great historical build- 
ings have given us a new form of uni- 
versal education. Nowadays the per- 
son most averse to reading about his- 
tory will travel to Baalbek to watch 
a spectacle performed in the most 
imposing ruins left by Rome, and thus 
sees for himself how the influence 
and vigour of a civilization carried 
the splendour of its arts so far afield. 
And on the excavation sites in Israel 
tourists from all parts of the world 
discover how Greece and Rome 
stretched out the golden branches of 
their civilizations as they penetrated 
into Asia Minor. 
It is easy to make ironic remarks 
about the superficial mentality of the 
tourist who goes from ruin to ruin Ph

and theatre to theatre and carries 
away only a confused image of other 
times and other worlds. But apart 
from the fact that the spectacle has 
broadened his mind, it is likely that 
among any crowd of sightseers there 
is at least one person who Will harvest 
something of value from the exper- 
ience, and will make use of it crea- 
tively in some form of art. 
Tourism, having become the most 
productive industry in many countries, 
now provides ample means to pay 
for the preservation and restoration 
of monuments that would otherwise be 
left to perish. The work of André 
Malraux in cleaning up the face of 
Paris, or of Piero Bergellini in doing the 
same for Florence, or of the Mexicans 
who have uncovered Teotohuacan, is 
creating cultural wealth for all to enjoy. 
And this capital increases with the help 
  
of the anonymous tourist. The discov- 
ery of the Dead Sea scrolls, a major 
victory for those trying to shed new 
light on the times of Jesus, is another 
positive result of our century's pas- 
sion for archaeology. 
Another remarkable phenomenon is 
the way the fever of curiosity spreads 
from foreign visitors to the people of 
the “tourist” countries. “Domestic” 
tourism has the advantage of penetrat- 
ing more deeply. People who had 
never before explored their own coun- 
try are now discovering their rich cul- 
tural heritage. This is the case in 
France, for example, where visitors 
from the provinces are going from the 
Louvre to Chantilly and from Versailles 
to the Museum of Man in Paris, and 
are filling in the sketchy outline of 
knowledge acquired in school or from 
the newspapers. 
An immense network 
of cultural exchanges 
is now spreading around 
the world. Today, 
sculpture and painting 
travel even more 
swiftly than did books 
and music yesterday.

### 3728: Two decades in the world of culture

The last twenty years have also 
witnessed a revolution in museums. 
They have ceased to be what they 
were at the start of the century—store- 
houses crammed with canvases, sta- 
tues and jewels which were of more 
value as an accumulation of 
treasures than for the help they might 
have offered the layman. In recent 
years museums have been completely 
transformed and are now an in- 
dispensable extension to the school. 
When the Museum of Man opened 
in Paris some thirty years ago, its 
strikingly new visual representation of 
the history of man and his cultures 
was a revelation to the world. Today 
it is the turn of the new National 
Anthropological Museum of Mexico to 
become a world precursor in museo- 
logy, and it is from the avant garde 
techniques of Mexico that the Paris 
museum may now draw inspiration. 
Reproductions are also playing a 
major role in the efforts of museums 
to attract visitors in increasing numbers

from all walks of life. Outstanding 
examples of museums which use this 
technique are the Museum of French 
Monuments in Paris and the remarkable 
Civilta Romana Museum in Rome. 
But these are only some of the pos- 
sibilities that new means of communi- 
cation and diffusion are opening up for 
the spread of culture. You may show 
the reproduction of a painting from 
the Prado Museum in Madrid to a 
schoolboy in any Latin American city, 
and he will tell you without hesitation 
whether it is an El Greco or a Velas- 
quez, since knowledge of that kind has 
reached every level of society. And 
when a museum in the United States 
pays two million dollars for a Rem- 
brandt everyone approves, since the 
museum is acquiring a painting that 
will give millions of people a clearer 
idea of what art means in a world 
that has entered an era of prodigious 
achievements. 
We have seen in recent years all 
kinds of audacious experiments being 
carried out in every sphere of artistic 
creation. We have witnessed, for 
example, the life of Picasso and 
the impact it has made as he proceed- 
ed to disintegrate, integrate and rein- 
tegrate a whole vast field of art. In 
the theatre we have seen the experi- 
ments of Brecht and lonesco. In liter- 
ature we have been offered the anti- 
novel. The number and scope of the

not destructive. 
Passion for the Greek theatre re- 
mains universal. We have a perpetual 
Shakespeare festival. There has been 
a reappraisal of the nineteenth cen-

about a renaissance of Michelangelo

spectators throughout the world in 
front of the paintings in the Sistine 
Chapel or the sculpture on the tombs 
of the Medicis, and these millions have 
seen the works to better advantage

A storishies technical im- 
provements in the mass 
media of information in the past 
20 years hold bright promise for 
eventual realization of the premise of 
the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, that all men have the right “to 
seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas through any media and 
regardless of frontiers.” 
Today, it is not only political and 
ideological boundaries that are being 
leapfrogged in the pursuit of this goal. 
What only 20 years ago were consider- 
ed impossible distant reaches in terms 
of technical improvement of the physi- 
cal channels of communication are 
now within sight. Indeed, in some 
areas we are at the point of crossing 
what may be the last and most for- 
midable “frontier” of them all—that 
of a truly global, free-flowing network 
of communications of all kinds, avail- 
‘able to all people in all countries. 
Even so, this frontier is a wide and 
uncharted one, and its passage will 
take time as well as foresight and 
enterprise on the part of educators,

journalists, administrators and others 
directly concerned with the venture. 
The inescapable fact is that progress 
in improving the world's mass commu- 
nication facilities is at best simply 
keeping pace with the still-serious 
inability of many millions of persons 
to make use of what few channels of 
communication may be available to 
them. As the most recent edition of 
the UN Statistical Yearbook reminds 
us all too significantly, some 40 per 
cent of all adults in the world cannot 
read, while less than half of the world’s 
children of school age in fact attend 
school. 
So, while it is heartening to know 
that in two decades huge numbers of 
people have gained easier access to 
more books, periodicals and newspap- 
ers and to more cinemas and more 
radio and television services, we must 
at the same time appreciate that exis- 
tence of information facilities by no 
means necessarily equates with ability 
to make meaningful use of the facili- 
ties. In short, we must acknowledge 
and accept the enormity of the chal- 
lenge still facing us—the challenge of 
making wise use for universal benefit 
of the marvelous tools of communica- 
tion that scientists and engineers are 
laying before us. 
Having done this, we can take a 
backward glance as the trail travelled 
so far and derive therefrom a generous 
measure of satisfaction for a good 
many substantial accomplishments. In 
1950, in its first edition of the glo- 
bal survey, World Communications, 
Unesco reported the disturbing fact 
that “little or no modern means of 
communication” existed for many 
millions of people in vast areas of 
the world. 
  
MEDIA 
by Robert Lindsay 
and Raymond B. Nixon 
To say the least, the situation has 
changed, as the fourth (1964) edition 
of World Communications illustrates 
so clearly. The Unesco-postulated 
goal of ten copies of daily newspapers, 
five radio receivers and two cinema 
seats per 100 people, per country, as 
an acceptable minimum has not yet 
been attained by any means; never- 
theless, there has been immense prog- 
ress since the immediate post-World 
War Il years. 
In the case of the daily press, news- 
paper circulation in the world gen- 
erally has increased, especially in a 
great many developing countries (in 
some of which, indeed, no newspapers 
at all existed 20 years ago). This 
increase is in particular evidence in 
the developing regions and countries 
of Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
Only in North America in fact, 
do we see that daily newspa- 
per circulation, although still rising, 
has fallen behind population increases 
—a fact generally attributed to the 
phenomenal growth of television, 
Concomitant with the overall surge 
in newspaper circulation has been an 
increase in the number of news agen- 
cies serving the several media of mass 
communication; there are now 155 such 
agencies in a total of 80 countries, as 
compared with 96 in only 54 countries 
when Unesco first surveyed the field. 
The periodical press, too, figures 
largely in the global picture of mass 
communication. There are no reliable 
world-wide data on magazines and 
similar publications, but there indubi- 
tably has been since 1945 a vast num- 
ber of new periodicals launched, cater- 
ing for an equally vast number of 
audience needs and tastes.

TWO DECADES OF MASS MEDIA (Continued) 
From transistor 
to communication satellite 
The periodical press may well play 
an increasingly important role in edu- 
cation as a bridge to wider avenues of 
learning for the world’s 700 million 
illiterates. This is especially true in 
developing countries where the spe- 
cialized publication, relatively accessi- 
ble and uniquely suited for extended 
reading, can play a vital part in both 
literacy teaching and general educa- 
tional programmes. 
The cinema, despite the rise and 
challenge of television, still continues 
its reign as monarch of the media of 
entertainment in most areas of the 
world. No doubt the most interesting 
development in this regard has been 
the shift over the past 20 years in 
the locus of film production. Espe- 
cially in the last ten years, feature 
films have been put out in increasing 
numbers by Japan, India and Hong 
Kong, in Asia; by the United Arab 
Republic in Africa; by Argentina and 
Brazil, in particular, in South America; 
and by the Soviet Union. 
The United States, once the leader 
in this field, now ranks fourth in the 
world in terms of annual production of 
feature films. Europe, too, has seen 
a decline in film production (and a 
lesser decline in cinema attendance), 
thus reflecting, like North America, 
television's competition for audiences 
in search of entertainment. In the 
Soviet Union, on the other hand, both 
the production and attraction of 
feature films has skyrocketed in the 
past ten or more years—despite the 
introduction of television. : 
The use of the film for educational 
and informational purpose continues to 
grow everywhere in the world. Added 
to this medium’s traditional attributes 
of transportability and audio-visual 
acceptability are new techniques in 
the uses of colour, wide-screen pho- 
tography, and projection facilities. 
Television, the only new medium of 
mass communication introduced since 
the end of World War Il, has at the 
same time proliferated more rapidly 
than any other medium—first in North 
America, then almost simultaneously 
in the United Kingdom and Western 
Europe and only a little later in Eastern 
Europe, the Soviet Union, Asia, Latin 
America and Africa. TV, yesterday's 
novelty, has become a commonplace 
seemingly overnight. 
There had been telecasting, largely 
experimental, in England and the Uni- 
ted States before 1939, but World War 
Il shut off growth of the new medium. 
Only 20 years ago, there were but six 
TV stations transmitting in the United 
States to a few thousand receivers; 
five years later, there were not even 
any receivers for TV in Africa, Asia and 
Oceania. Today, there are some 
140 million television receivers in the 
world, and in the neighbourhood of 
2,500 transmitters. 
Pervasive though television has 
become, however, there remain large 
sectors of the world where the me- 
dium, even though it may exist in the 
form of transmitting facilities, is far 
from being accessible to many millions 
of people unable to afford receiving 
sets. Despite these large patches of 
TV's non-penetration on the world 
map, it is incontestable that the past 
two decades have witnessed the most 
promising—and often spectacular— 
pilot projects for the achievement of 
the goal defined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
In particular, there is the exciting 
promise in the continuing co-operation 
among member-countries of Eurovision 
and Intervision in the exchange of 
programmes and on occasion, facilities, 
for the education, enlightenment and 
entertainment of many millions of view- 
ers in the U.S.S.R. Eastern and 
Western Europe, and North America. 
It is sometimes suggested that the 
post-World War 1l years could be 
termed The Age of the Transistor. 
Certainly it is true that the advent of 
exquisitely miniaturized electronic cir- 
cuitry is among the most significant 
technical developments affecting the 
mass media of information in the past 
20 or so years. The impact of the 
transistor alone on radio broadcasting 
throughout the world is almost incal- 
culable. 
Moreover, equally important techno- 
logical innovations are promised by 
scientists; these developments, coupl- 
ed with factors related to economics, 
geography, and political and social 
development, strongly suggest that 
radio likely will remain for some time 
the single medium best suited for meet- 
ing the requirements of mass educa- 
tion and literacy programmes in many 
developing countries. 
Everywhere in the world since 1946 
radio has become firmly seated as the - 
most widely spreading of all the mass 
media. In Africa, there were 140 
radio transmitters as recently as 1950; 
today, that figure has nearly tripled. 
In less than 20 years, the number 
of radio transmitters has nearly qua- 
drupled in the U.S.S.R., tripled in 
Asia, doubled in South America. Once 
again, however, such figures can be 
deceptive, for despite the startling 
percentage increases, in the number 
of transmitters in Africa, Asia and 
some areas of Latin America, radio 
broadcasting remains below what 
Unesco considers the minimum, name- 
ly five radio receiving sets per 100 
people. 
‘ication by the mass media. 
 
literally soaring over all 
other instruments of mass information 
conveyance, there is the communica- 
tion satellite—far and away the most 
Finally, 
significant technical accomplishment 
and historical milestone of the past 
20 years. As pioneered by the United 
States and the Soviet Union, the com- 
munication satellite has demonstrated 
that there are no physical limitations 
to the spatial dimensions of mass com- 
munication. 
Already millions of television view- 
ers and radio listeners in Asia, North 
and South America, Europe and the 
U.S.S.R. have sat in their homes to 
see and hear programmes originating 
“live” from points many thousands of 
miles distant, thanks to the miracle of 
relay transmitters orbiting thousands 
of miles above the planet. 
Last December, Unesco called a 
meeting of experts at its Paris head- 
quarters to take up in a preliminary 
way the complex problems posed by 
the presumed uses of space commun. 
e 
United Nations General Assembly has 
declared that “communication by 
means of satellite should be available 
to the nations of the world as soon as 
practicable on a global and non-dis- 
criminatory basis.” The recent Unesco 
conference addressed itself to a 
consideration of how this might be 
done. 
In the meantime, the communication

satellite—of which only a few proto- 
types have been placed in orbit—is 
less than five years off the drawing 
board, and what it may portend for 
the future of world communications re- 
mains to be systematically contemplat- 
ed and structured. The United States 
has placed principal authority for 
development of its communication 
satellite system in the hands of a pri- 
vate corporation, which is just now 
commencing to explore the specifics of 
its mission. A complicating factor is 
that the private American concern ne- 
gotiates with the several European 
members of a recently established 
communication satellite consortium, 
which for the most part represents 
national governments. The role, if 
any, of Unesco or of the United Na- 
tions in any eventual system or sys- 
tems, cannot at this time be foreseen 
with certainty. 
In sum, the development of mass 
communication in the world in the last 
20 years, quantitatively, has been 
steady, encouraging and in some res- 
pects spectacular. Especially since the 
1950s, more people have been able to 
read more printed publications, to 
enjoy more cinemas and more radio 
and television offerings. To the extent 
that sheer numbers of communication 
channels and the means for tapping 
them constitute progress, the cause of 
improving education and politico-socio- 
economic development everywhere in 
  
  
the world has been exceedingly well 
served in the eventful years since 
Unesco was founded. 
There, remains the agenda-—already 
full, it would seem, yet constantly 
being crowded with ever more entries 
—of pressing considerations related 
to the utilization and implementation of 
all these efficient machines for dissem- 
inating ideas and information. In the 
next 20 years, or in the next ten or 
five years, the world community must 
attempt to reduce the number of unre- 
solved items on this agenda. 
To cite but one example: Twenty 
years hence or even much sooner, 
there will be in existence one or 
more communication satellite systems. 
Whether or not any of these may in 
some way be available to (or perhaps 
even administered by) United Nations 
agencies and the countries and regions 
they serve, it will be imperative for the 
fundamental cause of world amity that 
the United Nations in some realistic 
manner should be privy to policy and 
operational deliberations concerning 
them. We can be grateful that Unesco 
has already begun to examine how 
space communication can be put 
to use in its continuing programme 
for the use of the mass media for edu- 
cation and for literacy campaigns. 
For the developing countries, espe- 
cially, establishing economic and edu- 
cational bases upon which to found 
    
  
viable mass communications systems— 
complex though this task is in itself— 
may well be less crucial than ensur- 
ing an adequate supply of profession- 
ally trained and educated commu- 
nicators—journalists and educators. 
Unesco’s efforts in this field are 
reflected in the fact that more than 
70 countries today have schools of 
journalism or training programmes for 
workers in the mass media, whereas 
only 25 countries had such facilities 
when the first meeting of journalism 
educators and media experts was held 
in 1947. 
No mass medium—print or broad- 
cast, traditional or innovative—can be 
any more useful to the culture and 
society it operates in than the people 
who decide what it will say to its 
audiences. There is always the dan- 
ger, as some of the technologically 
advanced countries have discovered, 
that the medium can in effect “run 
away with" the human beings who 
created it in the first place. 
More books, more cinemas, more 
transmitters, more periodicals and 
newspapers, more  receivers—we 
should see to it that these remain what 
they must always be: tools in the ser- 
vice of and at the command of man. In 
themselves, they are nothing; only 
human beings, speaking through these 
media to other human beings, make 
them worthy of our attention.

by Alva Myrdal 
] HE very placing of Social 
Science as one of the 
major headings on the Unesco pro- 
gramme has undoubtedly contributed 
to the status of a venture of intellec- 
tual conquest that is still in its pioneer 
era: the study of the world man has 
built for himself—the world of social 
order and disorder. 
Under the guidance and prompting of 
Unesco, a whole series of new inter- 
national organizations has been creat- 
ed: The International Political Science 
Association, The International Socio- 
logical Association, the International 
Economic Association and The Inter- 
national Association of Legal Sciences, 
to name but a few. These organiza- 
tions have strengthened the social 
scientists all over the world in their 
demands for a more prominent platform 
 
ALVA MYRDAL, the distinguished Swedish 
sociologist, was director of Unesco's De- 
partment of Social Sciences from 1951 to 
1955. After serving as Swedish ambassa- 
dor to India and Ceylon, and later to Nepal, 
she led the Swedish Delegation to the 
U.N. Disarmament Conference in Geneva, 
in 1962. She was chairman of the U.N. 
Security Council group of experts who 
reported on problems of apartheid in the 
Republic of South Africa (see the Unesco 
Courier, April 1965). She has written many 
books on sociological questions, including 
“Crisis in the Population Problem”, "City 
Children”, “Are We Too Many” and 
“Women's Two Roles” (with Viola Kline). 
from which to be heard, for academic 
recognition as a profession and for 
meeting places to share their ideas. 
In the past twenty years the social 
sciences have received considerable 
recognition as separate academic dis- 
ciplines, and their findings have been 
ever more widely sought. Today, for 
example, the architect who is planning 
a new school sits down with both the 
educator and the psychologist to learn 
what they have found out about the 
nature of learning. What are the best 
uses of space, colour and design to 
create the optimum conditions for the 
varied and various learning pro- 
cesses? 
When an advertising firm plans a 
new campaign for a product, the 
sociologist is consulted. What kind of 
approach, based on certain identifiable 
patterns of behaviour, will have the 
greatest effect?

pleting his election strategy, meets

a highly-skilled professional who plays 
an increasingly large role in the 
development of his country and fre- 
quently, due to the nature of our ever- 
shrinking world and growing inter- 
nationalism, other countries as well. 
Kenneth E. Boulding, the inter- 
nationally known economist writes 
“...I venture to predict that the role 
of the social sciences... has a 
potential which exceeds by whole 
orders of magnitude its present utili- 
zation, and that this potential may 
well be realized in the next generation. 
The potential arises because of the 
ability of the social sciences to develop 
quantitative, statistical, well-sampled 
and rigorously processed images of 
the world.” (1) 
In the area of economics, for exam- 
ple, Boulding states that systems of 
collecting and analyzing economic 
statistics have become so sophisticat- 
ed that the economist has literally been 
forced to take on greater responsibil- 
ity in the formation of economic poli- 
cies. 
Some of the substantial achieve- 
ments of the social sciences have

SCIENCE (Continued) 
If you're a racist 
you're definitely 
not with it! 
come about as a result of social 
scientists’ teaming up with their col- 
teagues in allied fields. In the area 
of race prejudice, for example, the 
social scientists have sought out the 
extensive research of the biological 
scientists in the fields of biology and 
genetics in order to deal with the 
numerous theories of genetic racial 
superiority. Assisted by extensive 
means of disseminating information, 
the social scientists have helped bring 
the results of their scientific studies 
to the attention of the public and, 
indeed, have encouraged the general 
acceptance of the concept of a 
scientific approach to the study of 
social groups. 
The uses to which social scientists 
have been able to put the continuously 
expanding knowledge of the biological 
and physical scientists have no doubt 
contributed to the increasingly educat- 
ed view of the public towards such 
questions. It is now considered 
“backward” and “uneducated” in most 
countries and societies to hold beliefs 
of racial superiority and inferiority. 
Where racism is on the wane, it is 
because insight into the fundamental 
equality of all human beings is being 
taught and accepted. 
In this particular endeavour, whose 
goal is the eradication of race preju- 
dice, Unesco has played an immensely 
useful role. In 1949 and 1950, Unesco 
acted as host to various conferences 
of social, physical and biological 
scientists. As a direct result, the 
authoritative statement, “The Race 
Concept”, was published, followed by 
a series of specialized studies pub- 
licized in unusual numbers. During the 
past three years, additional meetings 
have been held to complement that 
study in light of the newest scholarship 
available and to discuss the sig- 
nificance of recent research on the 
nature of racial prejudice. 
The development and expanding 
applications of the social science 
approach to contemporary problems 
are themselves valuable in that this 
approach helps to combat mystical and 
demagogic conceptions of society. 
Though the extent to which the social 
sciences have become acceptable to 
decision-makers varies, there is increas- 
ing acceptance of the premise that 
societies function according to cer- 
tain discernible laws. 
If a social system is amenable to 
improvement, the discovery of these 
laws can provide the basis for 
appropriate action to remedy shortcom- 
ings. Thus the often destructive 
element of passion and false beliefs 
is greatly diminished, and through a 
more scientific understanding, policy 
can be more efficiently directed 
towards constructive ends. 
The area of the social sciences 
which has had the widest acceptance 
by decision-makers thus far, has been 
that of socio-economic planning. At 
one time, in most countries, the word 
“planning” was abhorred. Deficit 
financing was taboo, although econom- 
ic crises and large scale unemploy- 
ment were rampant. In recent years, 
planning has gained recognition as one 
of the major instruments against these 
social maladies. Even the most de- 
termined individualists can no longer 
deny the impressive results which have 
been obtained, through planning, in 
all industrialized nations—with no 
severe crises and with full or even 
over-employment since the war. 
  
  
  
   
  
  
       
Some countries, have, of course, 
been committed to economic planning 
for several decades. Yet, whether 
they have capitalist or socialist econ- 
omies, countries have been making 
increased use of planning techniques. 
Demographers, for example, are being 
consulted for projections of future 
needs for food resources, schools, 
hospitals and leisure-time facilities. 
The techniques of market study, 
being developed and taught by busi- 
ness schools, are acknowledged and 
utilized by companies so that they can 
forecast the needs of production. 
Attempts are even being made to 
introduce scientific instrumentalities 
(operation analysis, simulation, models, 
statistics and mathematics) to the 
disciplines of history and political 
science. 
Hitherto less developed countries, 
often starting out on new courses of 
economic and social development, 
offer another sign of the remarkable 
impact of scientific thinking on socio- 
economic policies. Virtually all of 
these countries have, in their early 
stages of development, been examin- 
ing their short-term and long-term

plans in order to determine systematic 
programmes for growth. The function 
of these planners is to enable their 
governments to steer progress in an 
organized and systematic fashion 
through the maze of interdependent 
channels through which economic life 
flows. 
That not all plans can be implement- 
ed with any assurance of success, 
however, is sadly apparent. In the 
underdeveloped societies, the tasks in 
relation to available resources are 
sometimes superhumanly difficult to 
reconcile. Although a great deal of 
information has been accumulated 
over the past twenty years, progress 
has often been disappointing. The 
real achievement in these societies, 
however, is the knowledge that pro- 
gress cannot be attained through 
separate attacks on economic, social 
and cultural problems; success can 
only come through planning frontal 
attacks on these areas as a whole. 
New demands, therefore, must now 
be made on the social scientists. New 
theories and new institutional studies, 
devoted to the poverty-ridden areas 
of the world, must now be sought and 
examined. Yet, of course, the final 
responsibility for attaining the goals 
which have been outlined for the U.N. 
Development Decade does not rest 
with the social scientists. It rests, 
instead, with those wielding political 
power, men who are, despite good 
advice from scientists, too often acting 
as politicians rather than as statesmen, 
too often considering only short-term 
advantages instead of the needs of 
the future. 
Mankind is still seized from time 
to time, with self-destructive con- 
vulsions. The most elementary analy- 
ses show, however, that using violence 
is irrational; a counter-productive way 
of solving problems or harmonizing 
competing interests. Causes of vio- 
lence are, moreover, primitive panick- 
ing, where those concerned become 
unmindful of the tremendous costs in 
both human and economic resources. 
in other words, men too often arrive at 
their most fateful decisions in a manner 
which can best be described as pre- 
scientific. 
To the problems of conflict of war 
and peace, social science has devoted, 
comparatively speaking, little attention 
and energy. This lack can be explain- 
ed in terms of supply and demand; in 
these fields policy-makers are least 
willing to take any advice from the 
scientists. In his analysis of the 
problem, Professor Boulding attributes 
this in part to “the fact that the 
decision-makers... are for the most 
part insulated from the social sciences 
by their own training and tradition... 
On the whole, foreign offices and 
state departments are manned by 
people trained in literature and history, 
or even the classical languages, and 
for the most part unacquainted with 
mathematics or the sciences, least of 
all the social sciences.” 
The results provide a striking con- 
trast to the two areas discussed 
earlier. In socio-economic planning, 
for example, the decision-makers have 
a confidence nearing supernatural 
proportions in the social scientists. In 
regard to racial and other differences 
which have been the objects of pre- 
judice, the decision-makers have been 
pressed to accept the results of 
scientific investigations. But in relation 
to war and peace, those who govern 
states seem to prefer blindness and

ignorance to recognition and accept- 
ance of the scientific approach. 
While this judgement, that social 
science has played a remarkably weak 
role in policy-making, is becoming less 
and less true, within Unesco itself 
there is evidence that the pro- 
nouncements of the social scientists 
are not being taken as seriously as 
they would wish. The project “Ten- 
sions Affecting International Under- 
standing”, for example, must be credit- 
ed as a true pioneering effort, though it 
was not particularly well received or 
supported, and, in fact, Unesco’s mem- 
ber states scarcely gave it the chance 
to prove its validity. Some insight 
may be gained into the failures of 
the study through its critics, who 
felt the project was too narrow in its 
approach, since it centred on the 
psychological issues, and the dictum 
that “wars begin in the minds of 
men”. 
Where social scientists are begin- 
ning to make key contributions, how- 
ever, are in the new institutes of 
peace and strategy, and in the conflict 
studies that are being developed in 
countries throughout the world. 
New centres of research for studies 
of conflicts and conflict resolutions, of 
peace-keeping techniques, of inter- 
cultural integration, and many others 
are developing and their findings must, 
of necessity, be listened to by the 
decision-makers. 
Our imagination can scarcely 
conceive of how different the world 
could look if the constructive energies 
of hundreds of thousands of scientists 
and technicians were turned from 
refining the instruments of death to 
producing wealth and improving our 
social structures all over the world. 
There is no doubt that if scientific 
thinking, on a sufficiently large scale, 
were to be devoted to the problems 
in which this world has become 
entangled, an era might begin more 
remarkable than any we have yet seen, 
for technological growth and for keep- 
ing the peace; for forging mutuality 
of interests as revolutionary as any of 
our engineering wonders; for under- 
standing the pathology of conflict; for 
curing social ills as important and 
destructive as physical ones, against 
which medicine has made such dra- 
matic advances. 
Let us remember that social science 
has not yet had a chance to begin 
to work on all the social problems, 
and that these problems are posing 
a more deadly threat to our world 
every day. This work cannot begin 
too soon.

Above the Babel of minds 
T HE anguish of man is engulfing every 
shore. In this world, crushed by the 
afflictions brought on by the War and by the weight of 
rival economic, political and ideological interests, shail not 
those dedicated to the tasks of the mind, and who feel 
a responsibility for such a mission, give voice to the basic 
instinct for preservation, to the immense longing for peace 
and freedom, to the refusal to suffer and die, which, despite 
a strange kind of apparent inertia more akin to despair 
than to strength of soul, stir the hidden depths of men’s 
conscience? 
Modern thought has been likened, not without reason, to 
the Tower of Babel. Never, indeed, were minds so harshly 
divided. As human thinking splits into more and more 
specialized areas, it becomes more difficult to apprehend 
the implicit philosophies to which every one of us is 
necessarily committed. Doctrines and mystiques, mental 
traditions and schools of thought thus clash together and 
no one school can even understand the signs used by the 
others to express themselves; the voice of each is a 
mere sound to its companions on the road. Dig as deeply 
as we will, there are no common foundations left to specula- 
tive thought; there is no longer any common tongue. 
In such circumstances, can we conceive of a meeting of 
minds between men gathered together precisely in order 
to accomplish a common intellectual task, men who come 
from the four corners of the earth and who not only belong 
to different cultures and civilizations, but to antagonistic 
spiritual backgrounds and schools of thought? Is an 
institution like Unesco to give in and abandon all hope 
of affirming common ideas and common principles, to 
content itself with compiling documents and surveys, factual 
data and statistics? Or should it, on the contrary, attempt 
to formulate an artificial conformity of minds and to establish 
a common doctrinal denominator—likely, in the course of 
discussion, to shrink and finally disappear altogether? 
The solution, | think, ‘must be sought in another direction. 
Because the end-purpose of Unesco is a practical one, 
agreement between minds can be reached spontaneously, 
not on the basis of a common abstract concept, but upon 
the basis of a common practical concept; not on the 
affirmation of one and the same vision of the world, 
of man and of knowledge, but upon the affirmation of a 
single corpus of beliefs to govern action. This is little 
enough, no doubt, but it is the last remaining fortress 
where minds can meet. Hence it justifies the undertaking 
of a great task, and we will have achieved much if we 
can attain awareness of our common practical convictions.   
That is why stress must be laid on the crucial importance 
—although restricted to the practical field—of the collective 
thinking to which Unesco has appealed ever since its 
foundation and, in particular, of the statement of principle in 
which it declared, in the Preamble drafted at the London 
Conference, “that the great and terrible war which has now 
ended was a war made possible by the denial of the 
democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual 
respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, 
through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the 
inequality of men and races”; and “that the wide diffusion

of culture, and the education of humanity for justice and 
liberty and peace, are indispensable to the dignity of man 
and constitute a sacred duty which all the nations must 
fulfil in a spirit of mutual assistance and concern.” This is 
why | consider that one of the major tasks undertaken by 
the United Nations is the new declaration of human rights, 
to the drafting of which Unesco is contributing.

of advice from the best specialists and in a dispassionate 
spirit of science; or are you treating them as they arise 
on an essentially political basis, and in the light only of 
emotional or material interests? Are you profiting by the 
experience of other countries in the field of administration, 
by studying their methods and sending your young men 
to be trained abroad?

of expression, research and teaching, which is laid down

looked at your problems from a Unesco angle—that is to 
say not merely as national problems but as part of a 
single world problem, where several nations must learn 
to make adjustments in the interests of the whole body 
of nations? | think of such problems as over-population, 
facilities for study abroad, the utilization and conservation 
of natural resources, the making available to the world 
of the treasures of national art and history, or the removal 
of those sources of social discontent which are too often 
the seeds of war.

Nations don’t always

AN we really create world commun- 
C ity by asking sovereign States to 
think beyond themselves, to relate themselves to other 
peoples, to remove from their texbooks all matters pre- 
judicial to and inviting contempt of other peoples, to throw 
down barriers and every kind of restraint which prevent 
people from speaking to one another? Is it really possible 
to create community in this way, considering that the world 
community is a hopelessly pluralistic community, and that 
every community we have known in history had some core 
of homogeneity, which is what the world community lacks? 
To create world community is indeed a difficult prob- 
lem, but it is not an impossible one. Those of us who 
deal with the problems of Unesco have had some exper- 
ience of this, and, we might add, that even if on occasions 
we should regard the problem as hopeless we may bear 
in mind that every modern community, though it has a 
core of homogeneity that the world community lacks, is, 
at the same time, a much more pluralistic community than 
anything that was known a hundred or two hundred years 
ago.

Tuning in on youth 
OT merely children, but young people 
N as a whole are undoubtedly full of 
energy and resources, to which we have paid insufficient 
attention. We, who have always concentrated on the 
problem of teaching and transmitting our knowledge to 
young people, never seem to have thought that, conversely, 
we have so much to learn from them, so much of the 
hidden resources of human nature itself. We should be ever 
on the look-out for what young people, through their lives 
and activities, have to teach us in this way. 
| think, therefore, that if Unesco one day decided to 
regard children as a factor in the reconstruction of the 
world and the establishment of peace, and tried to enlist 
their aid, organize them, discuss matters with them and 
make use of everything they have to teach us, this would 
be of great assistance in breathing fresh life into this society, 
which must be built up not by one section of men, but 
by all men, from the beginning of their lives onward. It is 
the young people, the children, upon whom we may base 
our hopes of building a better world, since they can give 
us more than we in fact have today, and more than we 
at one time had but have since lost.

remind us that we are lacking in human charity. So long 
as the greater part of the human race continues to live 
face to face with hunger and injustice and to die in squalor 
and ignorance, the Declaration adopted in Paris will 
represent nothing more than a remote ideal. 
To make the Declaration known everywhere is to wage 
a world-wide campaign for a life worthy of man, to whom 
the governments have dedicated this Declaration, not in 
mere lip service, but in solemn recognition of their duties 
to civilization and to humanity. 
To help states carry out these duties in the field of educ- 
ation, science and culture is the proud mission of Unesco.

Ever-increasing collaboration

U NESCO is young, but it is maturing 
rapidly; we must all strive for it to 
become fully mature; Unesco is weak, but it is growing 
stronger; we must strive to speed up its accession of 
strength; Unesco is searching for the best modalities of 
action to achieve peace and progress through education, 
science and culture, and in this it has made surprising 
progress in seven years; we must concentrate on the 
objective of determining consciously what types of activities 
and what methods and procedures are fruitful and give 
them priority over others. Unesco has not yet fully develop- 
ed its most appropriate and most fruitful relationship to 
the associations and groups of creative intellectual workers 
of the world, although much of great value has been done; 
we must understand more fully, and help these workers - 
themselves more fully to understand that their work of 
mind and spirit is essential for the forward progress of 
civilization, and we must secure their ever-increasing 
collaboration in the common task...

proof that we are indeed at grips with the realities of life, 
not merely sailing in the clouds. 
A first antithesis derives from the inter-governmental char- 
acter of Unesco. Unesco inevitably expresses a political 
resolve, however democratic the procedures by which that 
resolve is taken; and though operating at an international 
level, it remains governmental in composition. But Unesco’s 
work is done in the spheres of education, science, culture 
and mass communication which are in principle the freest, 
in one sense the most personal and, being the most creative 
of man's activities, should also be the most independent. 
This gives rise to a second antithesis—that between the 
demands of intellectual life and the administrative and 
financial resources on which it must depend. The first 
are limitless; the second strictly rationed. Yet the two 
have to be reconciled in practical decisions, invariably 
involving sacrifices. 
For educationists, scholars and artists it is a bitter 
experience to learn that the noblest arguments must needs 
yield all too often to those of a material order. To learn to 
take into account all these factors which, as they are 
assembled, gradually bring about a balance permitting 
action and progress, is hard, but salutary. 
There is yet another paradox—perhaps the most profound 
of all—which Unesco has to overcome. It strives to maintain 
a strict and dispassionate neutrality towards philosophies, 
systems, political beliefs and religions. Yet it cannot remain 
alien, deaf and blind to the noblest expressions of human 
thought, to the anxieties of our modern world, to the 
yearning and quest for a code of social ethics to match 
the century of nuclear discoveries and interplanetary 
conquest. No! impartiality is not indifference.

one for our continent. The accession to independence of 
all these brother nations, who come to enrich the cultural 
patrimony of mankind, is a happy omen for the future of

our civilization and our culture. We all have need of 
Unesco and of all the countries which are ahead of us on 
the path of progress. But it is also true that in a human 
sense the world will be enriched by the discovery of this 
great continent, knowledge of which was supposedly 
acquired from exotic works and colourful descriptions. 
Today, it is Africa’s own sons who come to express them- 
selves freely and to make known to the world the wealth of 
poetry and art which this continent conceals.

For a synthesis of science 
and culture 
E ducation by itself does not necessar- 
ily lead to a conversion of minds 
towards peaceful purposes. Something more is necessary, 
new standards, new values, and perhaps a kind of spiritual 
background and a feeling of commonness of mankind. 
That commonness of humanity is already being brought 
about by technological progress, but the minds of men 
have not grasped it or kept pace with technological pro- 
gress. So, we see that science and technology which have 
brought so many benefits to the world and gradually tend 
to go towards the formation of one world, are also used 
to the manufacture of terrible weapons of mass destruction. 
At the base of it, all is fear and hatred. 
How then can we get rid of this fear and hatred and 
use modern scientific progress in the cause of peace and 
tolerance? 
We in India, as in many other countries of Asia and 
Africa, are trying to develop ourselves so as to put an end 
to our poverty and raise the standards of hundreds of 
millions of our people. 
help of science and modern techniques. The problem 
before us is whether in adopting the methods and tech- 
niques of science we might not create a society full of 
internal conflict and the urge for power which brings it 
into conflict with other groups. Can we succeed in 
bringing about a synthesis of modern science with 
something of the spiritual background which has en- 
nobled life throughout the ages. 
Unesco has set the right ideal before it to try to turn 
the minds of men, and the way it is trying to do so is 
not the direct method of facing our many problems and 
conflicts, but the indirect way of creating appreciation and 
understanding of art and culture. Presumably this is a 
surer method of dealing with these problems than the 
direct political method, though of course both methods 
have to be tried.

saying that an illiterate man is incapable of seeing even 
This cannot be done without the - 
  
from a mountain top. Education is of the greatest economic 
and social importance especially nowadays when the 
harmonious development of man's mental and physical 
faculties must satisfy the needs of all sections of society, 
serving as an essential basis for continued progress. 
One example we may quote is the work of S.G. Strumilin, 
a member of the Soviet Academy, who has attempted to 
assess the economic consequences of the development of 
education. Prof. Strumilin has reached the following 
conclusion: the value of the work done by a person who 
has had four year's primary education is 43 9, greater 
than that of an illiterate person, 108 9%, greater if he has 
had a secondary school education and 300 %, times greater 
if he had a higher education. 
The close links between science and education and the 
growing role of science in our modern society have led 
Unesco to accord a priority to science in its programme 
similar to that already given to education. It is impossible 
to speak of the effectiveness of education if its results are 
not incorporated in technical and scientific projects and 
do not lead to the solution of technical and scientific 
problems. In turn, the effectiveness of education is 
determined by scientific and technical achievement. 
Certain fears have been voiced in the past—and unfor-

our planet's sources of energy are being rapidly exhausted

that all grounds for pessimism are unfounded.

The first Unesco stamp (below left) was issued by France in 1946 
when the newly-created organization held its first General Confer-

been issued by member states. Some have commemorated mile-

aims.and its world-wide programme in education, science and culture.

UNESCO 
IN S50 QUESTIONS 
  
Has Unesco’s membership 
increased in the past 20 years? 
It has increased sixfold. Unesco (the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) legally 
came into being on November 4, 1946, when twenty states 
ratified the Constitution which had been drawn up at the 
London Conference a year earlier. Today Unesco has 
120 member states. Many of these are young nations 
that cast off colonial rule and set out to determine their 
own destinies. The past two decades have seen the birth 
of some sixty new nations, principally in Africa, the Middle 
East and Asia. These nations want not only political 
freedom for their people but a higher standard of living 
for themselves and their children. This “revolution of rising 
expectations”, as it has been called, has had a profound 
effect on the evolution of the work of Unesco and the 
whole United Nations family in recent years. 
  
Unesco, on the other hand, and the other specialized 
agencies of the U.N., are concerned with building peace, 
laying the foundations for lasting peace through action in 
the areas of their special competence. 
How does Unesco fit into the 
United Nations family? 
Unesco is a specialized agency of the United Nations 
but both constitutionally and financially it is independent of 
the United Nations though its work is co-ordinated with 
the U.N. and the other specialized agencies through the 
U.N. Economic and Social Council. 
This independence has a very practical importance 
because experience has shown that states which may differ 
politically and ideologically in the United Nations itself are 
able and indeed eager to work closely together in such 
areas as education, science and culture (Unesco), health 
and sanitation (WHO), or food and agriculture (FAO). 
Furthermore, this working together can itself help to break 
down the barriers of suspicion and distrust which divide 
mankind. 
How does Linesco contribute to 
world peace? 
Unesco contributes to world peace in three principal 
ways: First, by encouraging international intellectual 
collaboration in the fields of education, science, culture 
and mass communication. Nations which are working 
together for the common good of mankind are less likely 
to be interested in fighting one another, 
Secondly, by furnishing operational assistance to its 
member states to aid in their social and economic develop- 
ment, in order to reduce the glaring inequalities in standards 
of living that are a major cause of international tensions 
and war. 
Thirdly, through ethical action in favour of human rights 
and international understanding. As Unesco’s Constitution 
notes: “a peace based exclusively upon political and econo- 
mic arrangements of governments would not be a peace 
which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere 
support of the peoples of the world, and peace must 
therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual 
and moral solidarity of mankind.” 
  What are Unesco’s main aims 
and purposes? 
To help build a solid foundation for peace. Peace is 
the central purpose of the entire United Nations family but 
it is approached in different ways by different members of 
the family. The U.N. itself concentrates largely on the 
political aspects of peace and collective security. Its main 
concern is the keeping of peace—the prevention of armed 
conflict, although it has an abiding interest in social 
questions through the Economic and Social Council.     
What is Unesco’s budget and 
who pays for it? 
Unesco’'s programme and budget are determined and 
voted by the General Conference which meets every two 
years. The delegates to the General Conference are official 
representatives of all the governments belonging to Unesco, 
and each state contributes to Unesco’s budget according 
to a scale based on gross national product. 
Unesco’s first budget for 1947 totalled $7,000,000. Hs 
proposed budget for the two year period 1967-68 is 
$62,000,000. 
Unesco also has at its disposal extra-budgetary funds 
which have increased sharply in recent years until they 
are now as great as Unesco’s regular budget. A total of 
“over $80 million "has been allocated to Unesco under 
the United Nations Technical Assistance Programme since 
it was launched in 1950 to aid economic and social develop- 
ment. And Unesco has already received more than $91 
million under the United Nations Special Fund which was 
created in 1960 to encourage the flow ot investment capital

needed for economic expansion. It is largely thanks to 
these two major sources of economic and social aid 
(brought together and integrated as the United Nations 
Development Programme on January 1, 1966) that Unesco aa . 4 
is able to finance its operational action. a = 
Unesco has been able to extend its programme still ay 
further, especially in the field of education, by carrying 
out projects in co-operation with other institutions which 
have financed these activities. Three examples: The United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ! 
(over $76 million in 15 years); The United Nations Children’s 
Fund ($21 million in four years); The International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (over $50 million in loans 
to member states).   
| - International 
intellectual 
co-operation 
  
  
How does Unesco promote 
international intellectual 
co-operation? 
Three main tasks are assigned to Unesco by its Consti- 
tution: “To increase and diffuse knowledge; give fresh 
impulse to popular education and to the spread of 
knowledge; collaborate in the work of advancing the mutual 
knowledge and understanding of peoples.” 
International intellectual co-operation was thus the 
function that was uppermost in the minds of the men who 
founded Unesco, and it includes the sorts of activities which 
most people generally associate with Unesco—meetings 
of experts and international conferences on major problems; 
co-ordination of international research programmes; sta- 
tistical and documentation services; specialized publications 
including source books and reference works; and the 
elaboration of international agreements in the fields of 
education, science, culture and mass communications. In 
the words of its present Director-General, René Maheu, 
Unesco set out to develop and co-ordinate “the intellectual 
infrastructure of modern civilization in its broad univer- . : 
sality.” » I : FT, A

### 12008: The New architecture of UNESCO

THE NEW 
ARCHITECTURE 
OF UNESCO 
On its 19th anniversary, November 4, 1965, 
Unesco inaugurated a fourth building on its 
Paris headquarters site. When the first 
three headquarters buildings were inaugu- 
rated in November 1958, Unesco had 87 
member states. Today it has 120 and its 
activities have grown in proportion. 
A project to build a 10-storey structure was 
abandoned because of city planning re- 
strictions. So instead of building up, 
Unesco built down, following a plan de- 
signed by the French architect, Bernard 
Zehrfuss. The existing piazza area in front 
of the existing buildings was excavated to 
a depth of 33 feet and from this 2-1/2 acre 
site, 156,000 cubic yards of earth were 
removed. In this huge excavation 350 of- 
fices and two conference rooms were built 
around six patios (above right), each mea- 
suring 82 by 49 feet. Below these, a 
garage for 350 cars was built. The two 
floors of office buildings look out on the 
patios (photo right) and thus have natural 
light and ventilation and are insulated from 
noise. Each patio has pools and fountains, 
pebbles and marble flags, and beds of 
plants, shrubs and grasses following a 
layout designed by the Brazilian landscape 
architect, Burle Marx.

Unesco’s strikingly modern headquarters, 
now a familiar Paris landmark, has also 
become one of the city’s most visited sites 
since it was inaugurated in November 
1958. In eight years, half a million people 
have looked over its Secretariat building 
(left), the Conference building and the De- 
legations building. The headquarters was 
designed by an international panel of 
architects: Marcel Breuer (U.S.A), Pier 
Luigi Nervi (italy) and Bernard Zehrfuss 
(France). The whole is embellished with 
paintings, sculpture and mosaics by 
internationally-known artists: lean Arp, 
Jean Bazaine (France), Karel Appel 
(Netherlands), Afro (italy), Alexander 
Calder (U.S.A.), Roberto Matta (Chile), 
Pablo Picasso, Joan Miré, José Liorens- 
Artigas (Spain), Henry Moore (U.K.) and 
Rufino Tamayo (Mexico). In addition, a 
number of Unesco’'s member states con- 
tributed to the decoration and furnishing 
of the headquarters. Below, a corner of

UNESCO IN 50 QUESTIONS 
  
1 What do the Unesco National 
Commissions do? 
Unesco differs from most of the UN. specialized 
agencies in that it is closely linked to the governments 
and the peoples of its member states through National 
Commissions for Unesco set up in virtually every country 
(112 out of 120 Unesco member states). These Commis- 
sions have come to play an indispensable role not only as 
consultative and liaison bodies with national groups 
interested in education, science, culture and mass commu- 
nications, but in the actual execution of Unesco’s pro- 
gramme on the national and regional level. 
National Commissions are closely linked with the govern- 
ment services of their own country, with public and private 
institutions as well as with the National Commissions of 
other Unesco member states particularly on a regional 
basis. They bring together the most eminent people in 
education, science and the arts, and are increasingly 
becoming a key means at Unesco's disposal for the 
organizing of seminars and training courses, regional or 
international meetings, the appointment of experts, spe- 
cialists and delegates, the carrying out of national surveys 
and inquiries, the preparation of special projects as well 
as regional technical aid programmes and a host of other 
activities which make Unesco a living reality and enable it 
to fulfil its mission by reaching down to all levels of 
the population in its member states. (The Russian, Arabic, 
Italian and Japanese editions of the Unesco Courier, for 
instance, are produced under the direct auspices of the 
National Commissions of the U.S.8.R., the U.AR,, Italy and 
Japan. The German edition is the co-operative effort of 
the National Commissions of Switzerland, Austria and the 
Federal Republic of Germany.) 
(Continued from page 53) 
 
ration of United Nations Associations which have given 
Unesco continued support. 
At present 250 educational, scientific and cultural non- 
governmental organizations representing the different cultu- 
ral regions of the world co-operate closely with Unesco in 
the execution of its programme. During 1965 alone subven- 
tions totalling $1,393,600 were granted to 32 NGOs, and 
in 1965 contracts with 72 non-governmental organizations 
amounted to a total of $478,000. In addition Unesco granted 
financial assistance to five new projects carried out by 
NGOs under the scheme of associated youth activities. 
Unesco has long urged the expansion of NGOs in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America, and the progress which has 
been “made in recent years, notably in the number of 
national bodies affiliated with the non-governmental 
organizations and in meetings held by them in Asia, Africa 
and Latin America are extremely heartening. Here Unesco 
member states and National Commissions have had an 
increasingly important role to play in encouraging the 
formation in their own countries of groups of educators, 
scholars, intellectuals and specialists who can join existing 
non-governmental organizations and thus help to make 
these bodies effectively more international. 
  
How does Unesco work with 
non-governmental organizations? 
Experience acquired during the 20 years of Unesco’s 
existence has demonstrated clearly that co-operation 
between Unesco and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) is one of Unesco’s most effective means of action. 
This co-operation has placed at the disposal of Unesco 
documentation assembled by NGOs in all fields of Unesco’s 
activities. It has secured the services of a vast network 
of specialists throughout the world who are able to provide 
effective collaboration and whose aims, ideals and activities 
are closely linked with those of Unesco. It has relieved 
Unesco of important tasks which could only have been 
undertaken at considerable expense and with a much 
larger staff. And it has enabled Unesco to reach a wide 
and varied public whose friendly interest affords valuable 
support. 
The international NGOs include specialized bodies such 
as the World Confederation of Organizations of the 
Teaching Profession, the International Council of Scientific 
Unions, the International Social Science Council and NGOs 
dealing with universities, philosophy, theatre, music, 
museums, libraries, monuments, etc. . . as well as numerous 
non-specialized organizations, such as the World Fede- 
Why does Unesco attach such 
importance to international 
congresses and seminars? 
Unesco attaches the utmost importance to international 
conferences and seminars as one of the most effective 
means of bringing together scientists, scholars and other 
specialists from all over the world. These meetings 
encourage the free flow and exchange of ideas and infor- 
mation, and promote mutual discussion. They have been 
instrumental in helping to launch large-scale programmes 
of international co-operation. 
In recent years major conferences have been convened 
on information processing (1959), adult education (1960), 
oceanography (1960), hydrology (1964), problems of youth 
(1964), the eradication of illiteracy (1965). Major regional 
conferences for Asia, the Arab States, Africa and Latin 
America have dealt with educational planning and its rela- 
tionship to economic and social development, the conser- 
vation and exploitation of natural resources, the application 
. of science and technology to development, and the develop- 
ment of the mass media.     Research is -a major factor in 
scientific development. What 
has Unesco done in this field? 
‘When Unesco was first established in 1946, the interna- 
tional scientific community had been shattered by the 
“events of World War Il. One of Unesco’s first tasks was 
to restore its unity. This was done first of all by reinforcing 
the structure and helping to intensify the research and 
other work of the International Council of Scientific Unions 
(ICSU) and by creating such organizations as the Council

for International Organizations of Medical Sciences and 
the Union of International Engineering Organizations. 
Unesco helped initiate a series of international research 
projects which were not only extremely fruitful in their 
scientific results but also helped create a spirit of mutual 
co-operation and understanding. 
In 1952, Unesco helped set up the European Centre for 
Nuclear Research (CERN) which has done pioneer work in 
the exploration of the atom for peaceful purposes. The 
International Geophysical Year, initiated by ICSU and 
sponsored by Unesco, was a world-wide scientific venture 
involving more than 80 nations in a common effort. The 
International Hydrological Decade, initiated by Unesco, is 
co-ordinating research and the collection of data on water 
resources around the world. And the Inter-governmental 
Oceanographic Commission has brought about interna- 
tional collaboration in the investigation of the oceans.

co-operation in these fields? 
A new type of co-operation appeared in 1960 with the 
creation of the Inter-governmental Oceanographic Commis- 
sion, followed in 1964 by that of the Co-ordinating Council 
for the International Hydrological Decade. Through these 
bodies, which are integrated into Unesco, countries can 
tailor their own work to fit into mutually agreed research 
and study programmes. They can thus place greater 
resources and facilities at the disposal of the international 
community without giving up the autonomy of their own 
undertakings. 
Oceanography provides an illustration of how Unesco, 
with a comparatively small budget, can accomplish impres- 
sive results through its work of direction and co-ordination. 
Unesco has an oceanography budget of only $250,000 a 
year, yet it co-ordinates international projects totalling more 
than $15,000,000 annually. 
One of the most spectacular successes of the Unesco 
oceanography effort was the International Indian Ocean 
Expedition, 1959-1965. This ocean covers roughly 14 per 
cent of the world's surface, and in the countries 
surrounding it live more than 700 million people, almost 
a quarter of the earth’s population. Yet in 1959, scientists 
literally knew more about the near side of the moon than 
they knew about this vast sea. 
The six-year research programme which ended last 
year explored every facet of the Indian Ocean—topography 
of the ocean floor, currents, winds, water temperatures and 
salinity, plant life and animal life. Taking part in the effort 
were 40 oceanographic vessels from 15 nations, and 
scientists and marine biological stations from 25 countries. 
The data from this great expedition are now being pro- 
cessed and analysed, but it is already clear that the Indian 
Ocean is a practically inexhaustible source of food for 
the peoples of the world, and the impact of this one 
research effort will be felt for generations to come. 
For the Hydrological Decade launched in 1965, a promis- 
ing start has been made with the creation of hydrological 
committees in 90 countries in the international effort to 
obtain better knowledge of the earth's water cycle to meet 
the world's growing water shortage. 
12 When did Unesco launch its 
arid zone research programme? 
The programme was proposed as early as 1948 and 
was launched in the 1950s. From 1957 to 1962 it was 
one of Unesco's three Major Projects (the other two: pro- 
motion of better understanding of the cultural values of 
the Orient and the Occident, and the promotion of primary 
education in Latin America). 
Unesco's arid land programme for the desert and semi- 
desert regions that cover one-third of the land surface of 
the earth is a striking example of how Unesco has aided in- 
ternational scientific research. Hundreds of scientists from 
some 40 countries took part in this world-wide enterprise, 
participated in some 20 international symposiums dealing 
with problems of salinity, climatology, wind and solar 
energy, plant, human and animal ecology, etc. The biblio- 
graphy of the studies and research carried out on arid 
zone problems totals an impressive 28 volumes. Over a 
dozen institutions received grants-in-aid. 
What other types of research 
has Unesco carried out? 
In 1959 and 1960, with the help of about a hundred 
international organizations, national research centres in 
42 countries and more than 250 specialists from all over 
the world, Unesco undertook a major survey of the main 
trends in scientific research in the world. This survey has 
been hailed in scientific circles everywhere and has come 
to be considered an indispensable tool for science planning 
services in the developing countries. Unesco began a 
similar survey in 1965 on research trends in the social and 
human sciences. 
Joint surveys have been carried out by Unesco and the 
International Association of Universities on access to 
higher education in the world; on the role of universities 
in South-East Asia, and on inter-university co-operation 
in Africa. 
Unesco has sponsored many 
international agreements. What 
are some of the important ones? 
The Universal Copyright Convention (ratified by 53 states); 
Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the 
Event of Armed Conflict (53 ratifications); Convention 
against Discrimination in Education (30 ratifications); Agree- 
ment on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cul- 
tural Materials (49 ratifications). 
Unesco and the International Labour Organization are 
now preparing a Recommendation on the professional, 
social and economic status of teachers, and Unesco, at 
the request of the U.N. Economic and Social Council, is 
preparing a draft declaration on the principles of inter- 
national cultural co-operation.     How many book titles has 
Unesco published, and what are 
some of its best sellers? 
Over 4,000 titles have been published by Unesco directly 
or indirectly since 1946. Unesco itself publishes no less 
than 50 titles each year (in addition to a dozen periodicals)

In 1950 the ratio between professional staff members at Unesco UEEL GET CLOT) 
Paris and those located in field positions around the world was 10 to I. In 1966, for 
every 3 professional posts in Paris there were 5 in the field (in actual figures 368 to 
36 in 1950 and 635 to 1,067 in April 1966). Between 1960 and the end of 1965, the 
number of field posts (essentially operational ones) more than doubled. Our map 
shows where Unesco specialists (810), sent out at the request of member states, 
had taken up their posts in 90 countries on April 1, 1966. Among them are educators, 
teachers, economists, scientists, archaeologists and librarians.

50 QUESTIONS (Continued) 
more specialized books: Dictionary of the Social Sciences 
(18,000 copies); Study Abroad (13,000 copies); All Men 
Are Brothers—Life and Thought of Mahatma Gandhi (30,000 
copies); The Teaching of Reading and Writing (22,000 
copies); Education and Mental Health (23,000 copies). 
    
What are some of the other 
noteworthy books published by 
Unesco or under its auspices? 
It is difficult to choose from the more than 4,000 titles. 
Many are highly technical and scientific works that have 
made important contributions to education, science and 
culture. Here, selected at random, are a few titles. 
® World Survey of Education, a monumental study in four 
volumes;. ® Index Translationum, an annual compendium 
of the world’s translations; ® Vacations Abroad; ® World 
Communication, an up-to-date survey of the world’s press, 
radio, television and cinema facilities; ® Unesco World 
Art Series, 23 volumes published of little known treasures 
of world art in high quality colour; ® Unesco Series of 
Representative Works, 200 volumes published to date of 
masterpieces of world literature in translation—one of the 
great Unesco publishing ventures undertaken in collabo- 
ration with the world's leading commercial publishers. A 
particularly noteworthy effort has been made in this series 
to make better known the literature of Asia, Africa and 
Latin American as well as the literatures of the less known 
European languages.   
Il - Operational assistance 
for development 
  
 
  
What is the place of operational 
assistance in Unesco’s present 
programme? 
It is generally known that half the world's people go 
to bed more or less hungry every night, that a child in 
some countries can expect to live only half as long as 
a child in other countries, that average annual income in 
the richest nations can be as high as twenty times the 
average of some of the poorer ones. 
But it is perhaps less well known that 52 per cent of the 
world’s children of school age do not attend school be- 
cause of lack of facilities or shortage of teachers; that 
two out of every five adults in the world can neither read 
nor write; that 97 countries have an adult illiteracy rate 
of over 50 per cent, and 20 countries an adult illiteracy 
rate of over 95 per cent; that 70 per cent of the world's 
population (about 1,900 million people) have entirely in- 
adequate information about their own countries and still 
less information about other countries. 
For a long time lack of resources limited Unesco’s oper- 
ational activities for the benefit of the developing countries, 
but now the major portion of Unesco’s work is geared to 
development activities. 
What accounts 
for this change in emphasis? 
Two reasons lie behind this stepped up effort. 
First, the composition of Unesco has changed. Of its 
120 member states two-thirds are developing countries. 
Secondly, there has been the growing acceptance of the 
fact that development is a world-wide phenomenon. It is 
now abundantly clear that development depends largely— 
indeed chiefly—on the rational use of human resources. 
At the same time it is now recognized that education 
and science are basic investments which condition all 
development. 
    
Do governments now spend 
more money on education than 
they formerly did? 
As a general rule, yes. Many countries now allocate 
from 15 to 25 per cent of their national budgets to edu- 
cation, and some African states are devoting as much 
as 30 per cent of their budgets to education. At impor- 
tant regional conferences organized by Unesco since 1960

importance they attach to education and have set them- 
selves specific targets. Indeed, for the first time, the rate 
of increase of school enrolments in the world has out- 
stripped the rate of population increase. 
20 Does the increase in school 
enrolment apply to 
all levels of education? 
No. It mainly affects primary education. The over-all 
picture is not very satisfactory. Take the case of Africa. 
The chief goals the African states set themselves at Addis 
Ababa were: universal primary education on the African 
continent by 1980; 20 per cent of all children leaving pri- 
mary schools to be enrolled in secondary schools; and 
university enrolment to reach a total of about 300,000, as 
compared with 31,000, in 1961. 
If the prospects seem good as regards primary education, 
secondary education lags badly behind. Despite a high 
drop-out in primary schools, more than half of the 30 mil- 
lion children of school age in middle Africa are now expect- 
ed to complete their primary education, but scarcely three 
out of every hundred attend secondary school, and less 
than two in a thousand have any chance of some form 
of higher education. 
in Latin America, the situation appears satisfactory at 
first sight because school enrolment targets are being met 
at various levels. Yet only 20 per cent of primary school 
pupils finish school. Then too, in many parts of the 
world the curriculum is not adapted to modern needs or 
to the actual levels of development of different countries. 
This means that many students, when they do graduate, 
cannot find jobs that correspond to their education.

273 What is the biggest obstacle 
to the expansion of 
secondary school education? 
Shortage of adequately trained teachers. Unesco is 
giving this aspect of secondary education priority consid- .- 
eration. By the end of 1965, Unesco was administering 
in Africa alone twenty secondary and advanced teacher- 
training colleges set up in 17 countries with financial aid 
from the U.N. Special Fund (now integrated into the United 
Nations Development Programme). In 1965-66, 7,400 stu- 
dents were enrolled in these colleges, from whi¢h 1,500 fully 
qualified teachers graduated in 1965. 
7 What is the effect of this critical 
situation on the developing 
countries? 
Extremely serious. Children who have had only one or 
two years of schooling are prone to slip back quickly into 
illiteracy. Although the world percentage of illiterates is 
dropping (it now stands at about 40 per cent) Unesco has 
found that the number of illiterates is actually increasing 
because of rising populations. Nor are secondary schools 
expanding fast enough to absorb even the relative increase 
in the number of primary school graduates. This is a perm- 
anent source of frustration for those youngsters unable to 
continue their education and often accounts for the crises 
of modern youth one hears so much about.   29 Where is the main bottleneck 
in school enrolment? 
Unesco feels that efforts should be first concentrated 
on expanding secondary education where the main bottle- 
neck in school enrolment lies. This would provide more 
primary school teachers and candidates for higher edu- 
cation as well as much-needed middle-level technicians.     
What about the shortage 
of primary school teachers 
in the developing countries? 
Unesco considers this one of the major problems of 
the developing countries. The training of primary school 
teachers is the main target of the Major Project for the 
extension of primary education in Latin America, begun in 
1957, and the emergency aid programme for Africa launch- 
ed in 1960. Since 1962, the United Nations Children’s Fund 
has contributed about $21 million for joint Unicef/Unesco 
projects mostly for primary education and science teaching. 
Since the Latin American Major Project was begun, the 
number of children in school has increased by more 
than 11 million, an average of 1.7 million per year, and 
the number of children not in school fell both relatively 
and absolutely in the years between 1957 and 1965. 
Venezuela, for example, in less than five years doubled 
its school population at all levels and built more schools 
than were constructed in the whole of the preceding cen- 
tury and a half. 
In Latin America as a whole 380,000 new teaching posts 
have been created, and thousands of teachers have attend- 
ed Unesco and OAS (Organization of American States) 
education courses. The continent now has over one million 
primary school teachers. 
Latin America has one of the world's highest rates of 
population growth (2.7%). Yet its rate of increase in pri- 
mary school enrolment between 1957 and 1962 was over 
59%, or more than double the rate of population growth.

2 Much has been published on the 
need for new techniques in 
education. What is Unesco doing in 
this field? 
It is now quite obvious that the major problem of 
meeting the demands for more education cannot be solv- 
ed without the introduction of new techniques and methods, 
such as programmed instruction (the so-called teaching 
machines) and the audiovisuals (films, radio and televi- 
sion). But these revolutionary techniques cannot be adopt- 
ed without a rethinking of the entire concept of education 
today. Unesco has sponsored a series of systematic, 
carefully controlled experiments to study the effects and 
requirements of these new methods in science and lan- 
- guage teaching.

2 What has Unesco done to en- | 
courage school construction? 
Unesco has created a network of school building 
centres throughout the world, in Khartoum for Africa 
(1961), in Bandung and temporarily Bangkok for Asia (1962 
and 1965), and Mexico City for Latin America (1363). These 
centres promote research on different types of materials, 
designs and construction methods best adapted to regional 
conditions and resources. They also train technicians in 
school construction. 
Why was it found necessary 
to set up an institute for 
educational planning? 
Teachers, curricula, methods and schools are all basic 
to any national educational policy. But experience has 
taught Unesco that assistance to projects unrelated to an 
over-all plan for education can yield only limited results. 
It therefore sought first. to integrate the aid it renders 
member states for specific projects into the general devel- 
opment of education and then to establish educational 
planning as part of over-all planning for economic and 
social development. In 1963, an International Institute for 
Educational Planning was created in Paris by Unesco with 
initial aid from the World Bank. On a regional level, U.N. 
economic commissions have supported the operation of 
two centres in Beirut and New Delhi, an educational plan- 
ning and administrative group in Dakar, and educational 
planning sections of institutes for economic development 
in Santiago and Bangkok. 
   What is Unesco’s strategy in 
the struggle against illiteracy? 
Following the Teheran Congress in 1965, where the 
problem of illiteracy was carefully re-examined by 88 
national delegations including 56 ministers and under- 
secretaries, Unesco decided to incorporate literacy in its 
programmes for educational planning. For a long time, 
Unesco's action in this field was limited to making studies, 
providing technical assistance and initiating pilot projects 
for research and training such as the fundamental educa-

tion centres for community development which have been 
operating for over ten years in Mexico for Latin America 
and in the United Arab Republic for the Arab States. 
About 700 million persons—nearly half the world's adult 
population—are illiterate at present and the number of 
illiterate youths and adults rose by 20 million over the 
past five years. In 1964, Unesco launched an experimental 
programme to pave the way for a world campaign. This 
plan is scheduled to begin in a limited number of countries 
with assistance from the U.N. Development Programme 
and will concentrate on organized sectors of the economy 
where motivation is likely to be strong: public undertak- 
ings, private firms, co-operatives, trade unions, village 
councils or community development projects. The aim, 
according to Unesco's Director-General, is to start “an 
irreversible movement to wipe from the surface of the 
earth, in a single generation, the scandal and shame of 
illiteracy.” 
Three projects, in Algeria, Iran and Mali, were approved 
at the beginning of this year. Their total cost is $12,800,000 
of which $9 million will be provided by the governments 
concerned, and $3,800,000 by the United Nations Devel- 
opment Programme. Two additional projects, in Tanzania 
and Ecuador, were added later this year. 
 
Which aspect of science teach- 
ing is considered most vital to 
developing countries? 
Technological education—including the training of 
engineers—is the branch of science teaching most vital 
to the growth of developing countries and probably the 
one where they face the biggest demand for improvement 
and expansion. A striking example of Unesco’s work is 
the aid it has rendered since 1955 to the establishment 
of the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay. From 
its start, the U.N. Speciai Fund has enabled Unesco to 
expand its activities in this field considerably. At the end 
of 1965 Unesco was executing 50 Special Fund projects 
involving the establishment and initial operation of 30 post- 
secondary and 20 higher education institutes. 
2 What was the historic step 
taken by the Shah of Iran to 
combat illiteracy? 
In April 1966, the Shahinshah of Iran informed Unesco’s 
Director-General of Iran’s decision to use one day's expen- 
diture under its military budget to help in the world struggle 
against illiteracy. The Shah announced that this sum 
($700,000) would be placed at Unesco’s disposal. 
Iran had previously set up an “Army of Knowledge” 
in 1962 which uses young men in the armed forces as 
literacy teachers in villages. 
What is Unesco doing 
for technological research? 
Unesco is responsible for executing a dozen projects, 
mainly in Asia, and covering a variety of fields from power 
station technology and mechanical engineering research to 
the manufacture of precision instruments and the construc- 
tion of a mathematical model for the development of the . 
Mekong River basin. 
  
What is the new science 
policy of Unesco? 
The United Nations Conference on the Application of 
Science and Technology for the Benefit of Less Developed 
Regions, held in Geneva in 1963, gave Unesco an oppor- 
tunity to define in detail the goals of an international 
science policy related to problems raised by economic 
growth and social progress. This policy is also based 
on the survey of current trends in scientific research 
carried out in 1959, and the establishment in 1960 of priori- 
ties to meet present-day needs. 
Many people regard aid for the technological develop- 
ment of the less advanced countries as a mere transfer of 
“know-how” accompanied by the appropriate shipment of 
equipment. 
But no matter how essential transfer of knowledge is 
to economic growth it alone cannot solve the problem of 
aid to technological progress. Two activities dominate all 
others: the training of scientific and technological person- 
nel; the organization and planning of scientific and techno- 
logical activities. In other words, every country must create 
a scientific and technological potential of its own. That 
is why Unesco continues to emphasize the organic unity 
of science and encourages the development of scientific 
and technological training and research on a national level 
in newly independent countries. 
Why does Unesco consider the 
exploitation and conservation 
of natural resources to be of such 
vital importance? 
As world population and needs rise, knowledge and ways 
of studying our natural environment and its potential 
resources must be developed everywhere, not only through 
international action but also by the establishment or 
expansion of training and research institutes. Unesco is 
encouraging this trend in geology, seismology, soil 
sciences, hydrology, ecology, etc.—particularly for the 
lesser-known regions in the arid and humid tropical zones. 
Under its arid zone research programme, it helped create 
or develop a dozen institutes, of which one in Jodhpur, 
India, is an example. It is encouraging research and 
training in irrigation with brackish water in Tunisia, and 
aiding the operation of an International Institute of Seis- 
mology and Earthquake Engineering in Japan. 
    How is Unesco helping the 
developing nations to establish 
a coherent science policy? 
By helping them gradually to build a scientific infra- 
structure. This means organizing scientific and technolog- 
ical documentation, creating institutes for technological 
research, preferably with a multidisciplinary approach, and 
setting up centres to standardize, produce and maintain 
scientific instruments. For the past fifteen years, under 
its regular programme and U.N. technical assistance, 
Unesco has aided such efforts in most of the countries 
concerned. One example is the creation of 12 documen- 
tation centres—in Bangkok, Belgrade, Cairo, Djakarta, 
Havana, Karachi, Manila, Mexico City, Montevideo, New 
Delhi, Rio de Janeiro and Seoul—with the help of more 
than forty experts from 21 countries.

E Since 1960, education and 
science have been the two chief 
interests of Unesco’s operational 
activities. Have other fields, then, 
been neglected? 
Not at all. In the fields of culture and mass communi- 
cation, Unesco has done much. In library development, for 
instance, in 1964 alone, Unesco financed the operation of 
two regional centres in Senegal and Uganda for the train- 
ing of librarians, helped set up a school library service 
in Nigeria and a model public library in the Ivory Coast, 
and organized a regional seminar in Manila on the devel- 
opment of national libraries in Asia. In addition, 18 coun- 
tries received expert missions, fellowships and equipment.

How is Unesco helping the 
expansion of publishing in the 
developing countries? 
By encouraging reading in the greatest possible number 
of languages, particularly by children, youths and new 
literates. Through a centre established in Karachi in 1958 
Unesco is producing pilot editions and setting up new 
distribution channels to help ten Asian countries expand 
their publishing industries. And an international congress 
in Tokyo this year on the production and distribution 
of books in Asia aroused considerable interest in pro- 
fessional book circles. Then too, Unesco has brought 
_about closer co-operation between experts in applied 
linguistics and educational authorities to transcribe six 
groups of African languages and unify their alphabets. 
Basic vocabularies, grammars, dictionaries and simple 
reading materials are to be prepared and published in 
collaboration with a regional centre in Accra. Unesco's 
activities in encouraging book publishing by developing 
countries are to be grouped shortly into one co-ordinated 
programme. 
What is the place of the mass 
media in Unesco’s 
development programmes? 
It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of the present 
and future role of the mass media in continuing education. 
Unesco has always stressed this role and United Nations 
bodies have now recognized the influence of the press, 
radio, cinema and television on development, along with 
the need to help countries to expand and improve their 
facilities in this field. 
Between 1960 and 1962, three regional conferences were 
organized—in Bangkok for Asia, Santiago for Latin Amer- 
ica, and Paris for Africa. Unesco is encouraging the 
setting up of centres to train professional staff and pro- 
duce equipment. It is also responsible for seminars, expert 
missions, fellowships and supplying equipment. In the 
budget for 1965-66, more than $800,000—including 
$660,000 for technical assistance—has been allocated to 
such projects in some twenty countries, and to four 
specialized regional centres in Strasbourg, Quito, Manila 
and Dakar. Unesco has initiated a study of problems 
involved in the use of artificial satellites to facilitate the 
free flow of information, the extension of education and 
the intensification of cultural exchanges.

Unesco has been working for these youngsters in Bolivia and 
for millions of other children in Latin America since 1957 when 
it launched its Major Project to extend and improve primary 
education on that continent, particularly through teacher training. 
Between 1957 and 1965, school enrolment in Latin America 
as a whole rose by 11 million and teaching posts by 380,000. 
Many new teacher training colleges have been opened and 
seminars and intensive in-service courses have been organized 
by Unesco specialists for teachers, school directors and 
inspectors. Unesco co-operates with Unicef and the World 
Food Programme in projects aimed at improving school 
attendance, and with the International Labour Organization 
and Argentina, Bolivia and Chile on educational 
aspects of the Andean Indian development programme.

An outstanding contribution to pedagogical research in Asia was 
made by Unesco and Thailand in 1955 when they set up 
the Bangkok Institute for Child Study (above). By developing 
new educational methods and techniques, this research 
laboratory and training institute is helping to improve programmes 
and teaching for the children of Asia's village schools.

50 QUESTIONS (Continued) 
- Ill - Ethical action & human rights 
  
What does Unesco mean 
by ‘ethical action’? 
Everything that Unesco does, including its efforts to 
promote international intellectual co-operation and opera- 
tional assistance for development is subordinated to one 
fundamental purpose: to foster the dignity of man, promote 
human rights and international understanding. 
Unesco's Director-General has repeatedly pointed out 
that Unesco’s mission is essentially ethical in nature. 
“Unesco seeks to instil in men's minds the spirit of 
tolerance and co-operation, respect for human rights and 
peace,” he has said. “For Unesco, progress in education, 
science and culture is no end in itself, nor are the 
practical applications of such progress an achievement. 
They are only the means or the modes of a moral effort and 
a spiritual undertaking which constitute Unesco's real 
reason for existence.” : 
Unesco's activities in this field can be said to fall 
into three main groups: education for international under- 
standing, promotion of human rights and peace research. 
 
which have been sponsored by Unesco in various parts of 
the world over the past ten years in collaboration with 
national authorities and international youth movements. In 
1965 and 1966, Unesco assisted some thirty projects to 
promote educational travel, international understanding, 
civic and social education and other goals. 
By supporting the international voluntary work camps 
where millions of young people have worked together in 
a hundred’ countries, Unesco has encouraged youth to 
play its part in community development. Another example 
is long-term international service, in which volunteers re- 
cruited through some 250 organizations are now participat- 
ing—many of them as teachers in Africa and Asia. 
In 1964, Unesco convened the first world conference 
ever held on youth problems. Its recommendations are 
helping to blueprint a long-term programme for youth, 
including the setting up of a Unesco-sponsored network 
of national and regional institutions for out-of-school educa- 
tion for young people. Last year, Japan and Unesco held 
an all-Asia congress in Tokyo to plan activities for the 
youth of Asia (see also question 50). 
How does Unesco seek to 
foster education for 
international understanding? 
Unesco’s Constitution states that “the education of 
humanity for justice and liberty and peace is indispensable 
to the dignity of man and constitutes a sacred duty which 
all the nations must fulfil in a spirit of mutual assistance 
and concern.” Thus, since its founding, Unesco has 
assumed a leading role in work to promote teaching for 
international understanding, teaching about the aims and 
activities of the United Nations and its related agencies. 
In 1953, Unesco launched the Associated Schools Project 
in Education for International Understanding to develop 
knowledge of world affairs, of international co-operation 
in dealing with world problems, of different cultures and 
ways of life, and of the principles of human rights—in sum, 
to aid in developing the kind of education that can help 
to construct the defences of peace in the minds of men, 
to paraphrase the words of Unesco’'s Constitution. 
Today, nearly 500 primary schools, secondary schools 
and teacher training institutions in 54 countries are taking 
part in Unesco's Associated Schools Projects, and they 
represent not only different cultural traditions and dif- 
ferent stages of development but also different economic 
and political systems. 
What is the new concept 
4 of ‘continuing education’? 
Life is changing .so quickly these days that people every- 
where have come to recognize that education does not 
stop when a person leaves school, but is a continuing 
process during all of adult life. This concept was made 
abundantly clear at a historic world conference on adult 
education held in Canada as early as 1961 under Unesco 
auspices. 
This is what Unesco keeps in mind when it contributes 
to studies on leisure or on new relations to be established 
between university curricula and the continuing education 
of adults; when it encourages high-quality popularization 
of science; when it helps to organize scientific lectures and 
exhibitions; or when it promotes the broadest possible 
circulation of artistic, literary and musical works. 
The same concern has led Unesco to award over 12,000 
travel grants to adult education teachers and European 
workers since 1952, and to organize similar travel program- 
mes for workers in Asia, Latin America and Africa. 
  What else has Unesco done to 
associate young people with 
its work? 
In addition to the Associated Schools Project there are 
250 Associated Youth Projects of an experimental nature     What has Unesco done to 
combat racial prejudice and 
other forms of discrimination? 
Unesco has championed the cause of racial equality 
for the past twenty years. 
Racists have often claimed that their beliefs can be 
justified on biological, sociological or historical grounds. 
Unesco has constantly affirmed, through the voices of 
leading world specialists and in the light of scientific 
progress, that no branch of learning can provide racism 
with the slightest argument on which to base its beliefs.

### 9008: UNESCO in 50 questions

A declaration on the nature of race and differences of 
race was drawn up in 1951 by 12 anthropologists. This 
was reviewed in 1964 by 22 leading world specialists to 
take into account the most recent developments in bio- 
logy and genetics. This year the social and ethical aspects 
of the race question are being examined. 
Unesco has assembled salient facts on racial prob- 
lems in three series of studies (translated into more than 
15 languages). The Race Question in Modern Science 
sets forth contributions of anthropologists, ethnographers, 
biologists and sociologists which throw new light on the 
race question. The Race Question and Modern Thought 
defines the position of the major currents of philosophical 
and religious thought towards the race problems, and Race 
and Society presents studies of multi-racial societies. 
Unesco has also acted against other kinds of discrim- 
ination. Its special concern with the right to education 
led to the adoption of an International Convention against 
Discrimination in Education, in 1960. This is closely linked 
with Unesco's efforts to promote the access of women 
to education. 
  
How does Unesco promote 
international understanding 
through art? 
To bring the visual arts to the broadest possible audience, 
Unesco has adopted the solution of the “imaginary 
museum” which today's high quality reproduction of original 
masterpieces makes possible. Eight Unesco travelling ex- 
hibitions of art reproductions have visited 100 countries ; in 
its World Art Series, Unesco has published 23 albums of 
little known masterpieces, and has reproduced the works 
as colour slides and also in a series of paperbacks; to 
help the public choose good quality reproductions of paint- 
ings Unesco publishes two catalogues which have been 
revised and enlarged regularly since 1949.

On an improvised open-air stage in a village in Ecuador 
  
a young actor tells an attentive rural audience about 
the play that they are going to see. The performance 
is one result of a Unesco mission sent to Ecuador to help 
set up a national theatre company. After its first successes 
in Quito, the capital, the company toured the country’s towns 
and villages. Public debates followed each performance 
Next year, Unesco plans to launch a ten-year programme 
for raising the status of women through education, science 
and culture. 
and with the help of a team of specialists travelling 
with the actors—a doctor, an engineer, a social worker 
among others—yvillagers were encouraged to undertake 
all kinds of community development work and to join 
in adult education and literacy campaigns. Has Unesco done any work 
on international tensions and 
peace research? 
Early in its history Unesco launched a series of investi- 
gations of individual and group attitudes on national stereo- 
types and factors favouring aggressive nationalism. The 
results were published in The Nature of Conflicts. Other 
‘studies dealt with international tensions and ways of pro- 
moting peaceful co-operation among states with differing 
social and economic systems. 
Similarly, Unesco encourages research on peace and 
current trends in international relations, like the studies 
carried out in 1963 and 1964 on the economic and social 
consequences of disarmament with the assistance of the 
European centre for social science research in Vienna, and 
in co-operation with the United Nations, on the utilization 
in the field of education of the added resources that dis- 
armament could make available. 
On what is Unesco’s’ 
policy for the diffusion 
of culture based? 
All—or almost all—nations are now taking part on an 
equal footing in international political life, and this goes 
hand in hand with recognition of the fact that all cultures 
are worthy of respect. Unesco has sought to promote 
the idea that a dialogue between these cultures is a 
necessity for mutual appreciation. But even this is not 
enough today—the growth of the international commun- 
ity and the changes brought about by technological and 
industrial progress call for a new, broader humanism. It 
is not enough just for the elites to understand and appre- 
ciate one another's cultural values; this understanding and 
appreciation must now extend to everyone. By working 
for universal access to education Unesco seeks to promote 
new ways for people to know one another and to draw 
closer in terms of their respective cultural values.   Ph

12 
50 QUESTIONS (Continued) 
 
How has Unesco promoted the 
diffusion of literature and 
music? 
An outstanding example is the Unesco Collection of 
Representative Works which now includes about 200 vol- 
umes with more than 100 others now being translated or 
scheduled for publication. The collection is enriched every 
year by new translations from Persian, Arabic, Chinese, 
Indian, Japanese, Latin American and African literatures as 
well as European literary works (Italian, Rumanian, Finnish, 
Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Czech, Ukranian, Norwegian, 
among others). Unesco’'s annual bibliography of transla- 
tions, the Index Translationum—now in its seventeenth 
year—has become the standard handbook of the world’s 
translations. 
Unesco fosters co-operation in music through the Inter- 
national Music Council (set up by Unesco in 1949) 
which has helped to collect and diffuse recordings of 
contemporary music, folk music and Oriental music and to 
promote the exchange of students, musicians and radio 
programmes. 
For the past 12 years Unesco has sponsored the Inter- 
national Rostrum of Composers whose aim is to encourage 
the exchange of contemporary works of music by radio. 
Every year the Rostrum awards a prize to the composer of 
the most outstanding work submitted to it. This year the 
prize was won for the third time by a young Polish com- 
poser, Tadeusz Baird. 
  
When was Unesco’s East-West 
Major Project launched, what 
was its purpose and how has it 
been carried out? 
Since 1957, through a ten-year major project, Unesco has 
made a special effort to promote the mutual appreciation 
of Eastern and Western cultural values. This effort to 
achieve international understanding in depth has been 
carried out at three different levels. For the specialists, 
for example, it has helped in the establishment of insti- 
tutes of Oriental studies at Tokyo, New Delhi, Beirut, Damas- 
cus, Cairo and Teheran. On the secondary-school level, 
it has encouraged the improvement of curricula and text- 
books so that more attention could be given to previously 
neglected cultural values. Finally, in out-of-school educa- 
tion, various ways of spreading knowledge and ideas have 
been used—lectures, translations, exhibitions, visits, travel 
grants, films, museums, reproductions, etc. The very great 
success of this programme is reflected in the impressive 
number of measures taken by member states themselves, 
and by non-governmental organizations, to participate in 
carrying it out. 
Within recent years this dialogue of East and West has 
been further enriched. Certain countries, in Latin America 
for example, are showing increasing interest in Oriental 
cultures. And the independence of many African states, 
plus their growing awareness of the originality and value 
of their own cultural heritage has lent new meaning to 
the dialogue. 
Unesco is now helping to set up and run a network of 
institutes of African studies—ten in all—in Africa itself. It 
is also preparing a General History of Africa which is 
expected to be finished in 1975. Even more significant is 
the six-volume History of the Scientific and Cultural Devel- 
opment of Mankind (see page 32). 
What is Unesco’s role in the 
preservation of the world’s 
cultural treasures? 
In the protection and preservation of the world’s great 
monuments and other cultural treasures, Unesco has forged 
an important name for itself. The International Council of 
Museums, which Unesco helped to found in 1946, has 
become the recognized organization for museum author- 
ities and technicians all over the world. The International 
Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration 
of Cultural Property set up by Unesco in Rome in 1958 
is now an international laboratory for the study of diseases 
of stone, wood and other materials as well as many other 
aspects of conservation and restoration of monuments. 
The international campaigns which Unesco has launched 
for the improvement of museums and for greater public 
attendance in museums have been striking successes. 
During recent years a great deal of work has been 
undertaken in the form of direct aid by Unesco. Among 
the results of almost 140 Unesco missions have been the 
establishment of conservation laboratories in Indonesia, 
Thailand, Mexico and Peru; the creation of a fine arts 
museum in Lima, Peru; the modernization of national 
museums in Baghdad, Khartoum, Karachi, Kabul, Livingstone 
and other cities; and the establishment or reorganization 
of national monument services in Afghanistan, Malta, Easter 
Island (Chile) and Mohenjo Daro (Pakistan). 
Nearly four million pages of invaluable documents stored 
in the national archives and libraries of some 15 countries 
have already been microfilmed by two travelling Unesco 
teams in the past ten years. 
“As in many other aspects of its work, Unesco pays 
special attention to the training of museum and conserva- 
tion technicians. It has set up training centres for these 
purposes in Jos (Nigeria) and Mexico City, and has made 
special arrangements with the Honolulu Academy of Arts 
and the Bishop Museum of Natural History in Hawaii for 
the training of museum curators and technicians of Asia 
and the Pacific. 
    
What are the results of the 
campaign launched by Unesco 
to save the monuments of 
Nubia? 
One of Unesco's most spectacular—and important— 
projects has been the international campaign launched in 
1960, at the request of the governments of the United 
Arab Republic and the Sudan, to save the monuments of 
Nubia, in danger of being submerged by the waters of 
the Nile upon completion of the Aswan High Dam. 
In one of the greatest salvage operations in world his- 
tory, every free-standing temple in Nubia was dismantled 
and removed for reconstruction elsewhere. Certain 
temples hewn out of the solid rock were also dismantled 
and taken away; in others the most precious elements 
were preserved. The two incomparable temples of Abu 
Simbel (the Great Temple of Rameses Il and the smaller 
temple of Queen Nefertari) presented the most complex 
problem of all. These have now been saved. They were 
cut free from their rock cliff and dismantled, and are now 
being rebuilt exactly as before on a site out of reach 
of the Nile. To this operation, costing an estimated 
$30 million, some 50 countries have contributed. 
Within five years all the monuments, inscriptions and

Nigeria. Set up by Unesco and Nigeria in 1959, the library immediately drew crowds of people 
all eager to make use of its 80,000 books. To satisfy this hunger for knowledge, the government added 
a second building and also opened sub-libraries at Port Harcourt and lkot Expene. Thanks to 
Unesco's public library pilot projects, other libraries have been opened in Delhi (India), Medellin 
(Colombia), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), and Lagos (Nigeria). Unesco has organized training courses 
for librarians and has provided fellowships, books and equipment. 
Young readers choose books from the lending section of the Regional Central Library at Enugu, Eastern 
rock carvings in the region—archaeologically one of the 
world's richest—were catalogued and photographed; fres- 
coes were removed from temples and ancient Christian 
churches (as at Faras, for example); and all the main 
archaeological sites were reconnoitered. Forty expeditions 
from 15 countries explored Egyptian Nubia and a dozen 
more were at work in Sudanese Nubia. 
The spirit behind this co-operative effort is perhaps as 
significant as the prodigious achievement itself. Never 
before has an international cultural operation been carried 
out on such a scale. Its success shows that the nations 
recognize culture not only as an essential element of the 
intellectual and ethical solidarity of mankind, but also as 
a major factor in international co-operation in the service 
of peace. 
  
How can the individual help 
Unesco? 
The reader will have noted in these 50 questions many 
instances in which youth groups and non-governmental 
organizations are participating in the work of Unesco. 
Individuals can often join such groups on a national level. 
Many young people have grouped together in various     
countries to form Unesco Clubs which are extremely active 
in promoting the ideas of Unesco for international under- 
standing and co-operation. France and Japan alone have 
300 clubs each and eight countries have federations of 
Unesco clubs (Fed. Rep. of Germany, India, Italy, Morocco, 
etc.). Twenty-one countries have non-federated clubs. 
In Spain Unesco Courier Clubs exist in several major 
cities and arrange discussion groups, lectures, plays, 
concerts and exhibitions. 
A movement which has grown over the years is the 
Unesco Gift Coupon Programme which someone once called 
“technical assistance by the man in the street”. Schools, 
clubs and individuals provide educational or scientific 
equipment, books and supplies to Gift Coupon projects 
in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Dohor 
groups choose the projects from a Unesco list, collect 
funds, buy Gift Coupons and mail them directly to the 
project. In this way more than $1.5 million has gone 
to help literacy and adult education projects, schools, agri- 
cultural co-operatives, libraries and museums all over the 
world. 
But the real way in which people can help Unesco is by 
thinking and acting in the Unesco spirit of understanding 
one's neighbours, which is the first step towards strengthen- 
ing mutual respect and understanding and international 
co-operation.   13

Two decades in the world of culture (Continued from page 35) 
never dreamed of a museum as beau- 
tiful as the one they now have in 
Paris, nor of awakening such a wave 
of fervour in the United States, where 
thousands of their works have been 
on view. 
in the case of books, which some 
people imagine to have been ousted 
by other means of diffusion, the revo- 
lution brought about by the paper- 
back merits a special study on its 
own. In the United States, for exam- 
ple, it has brought about a fundamen- 
tal change that has done much to 
create a new image of that country. 
The first experiment with paper- 
backs was made twenty-five years 
ago. Today some are published in as 
many as fifteen million copies. A 
bookshop selling paperbacks, which 
you will find in every city, looks rather 
like.a supermarket. Many of the early 
paperbacks were detective stories, sex 
novels and mystery tales. Today there 
are paperback editions of all the 
classics, and in the universities stu- 
dents are advised which books to 
choose from paperback collections. 
In the self-service bookshop, young 
people no longer crowd around the 
shelves piled with thrillers or “shock- 
ers”. Instead they look for works 
on philosophy, political science, art 
and literature. The same thing is 
happening throughout the world—not 
only in the United States and Europe, 
but on every continent. Sophocles and 
Euripedes have now travelled around 
the globe, and those who have 
read their works or seen them per- 
formed by far outnumber the Athenians 
of Pericles’ day. 
The growth of mass readership 
thanks to the introduction and spread 
of paperback editions (who nowadays 
catches a train, goes off to the coun- 
try or relaxes in the evening, without 
a book in his pocket?), has led to an 
astounding increase in translations. 
In 1965, 35,000 books were translated 
in 69 countries alone. The symbol of 
the Tower of Babel has been revers- 
ed, and a network of universal under- 
standing covers countries that had 
never before known advantages of this 
kind. 
Nowadays an illiterate person is not 
necessarily an uninformed one. New 
media of communication—television, 
the cinema and radio—have trans- 
formed and vastly expanded the 
area covered by books and schools. 
This does not mean that the new 
media have replaced the old; they fill 
gaps, broaden knowledge and bring it 
up to date, and free from ignorance 
the person who was deprived of a 
school education. 
Admittedly there are times when all 
these media pander to the lowest 
tastes. But think of the marvels revealed 
by the cinema and the admirable mes- 
sages flashed around the world by 
radio in a matter of minutes. And 
what about the change that has come 
in the atmosphere of the home since 
one can listen there to the finest music 
of all time played by the world’s 
greatest orchestras? 
Then there is the radical transforma- 
tion of the university. Everywhere 
scientists and thinkers are on the move, 
reminding us of times when scholars 
travelled from Salamanca to Cam-

five times.   
SOLUTION TO THE CHINESE NECKLACE PROBLEM 
(published in June 1966 issue) 
By making only five cuts in his necklace, the merchant will be able to pay the 
innkeeper for his lodging each evening for 63 days. 
The first evening, the merchant cuts off one pearl and gives it to the innkeeper; 
the second evening he takes off two, gives them to the innkeeper who returns the 
first pearl to him; the third evening, he gives the innkeeper back the first pearl; 
the fourth evening, he cuts off four pearls, takes back from the innkeeper the 
first three pearls, and pays the innkeeper with these until the eighth evening 
when he cuts off eight pearls; the 16th evening, he cuts off 16 pearls; the 32nd 
evening, he gives the inkkeeper the remainder of the necklace—32 pearls—without 
The merchant has simply used the binary system (number system based on two). 
According to this system, 63 is expressed by 111111, that is, 1.2° + 1.2' + 1.2 
+ 1.27% + 1.2" + 1.2°, which gives us 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 4+ 2 + 1, or the value 
of each of six parts of the necklace. Therefore he only needed to cut the necklace   
bridge, from Bologna to Paris, on pil- 
grimages that gave to ideas an extraor- 
dinary mobility whose effects still 
astonish us. Nowadays this journeying 
to discuss problems and confront ideas 
is an everyday affair. From Australia 
to Alaska, from Stockholm to Santiago 
de Chile, the world resembles a typical 
Unesco conference, which investigates 
problems, makes known its findings 
and brings people from all parts of 
the world into contact. 
We are dazzled, and with good rea- 
son, by the success of man’s endeav- 
ours to conquer space during this 
same period. This achievement, which 
is like the discovery of a new dimen- 
sion, has allowed us to recapture, on 
hitherto undreamed of orbits, the 
experiences of great navigators from 
Ulysses to Columbus and Magellan, 
as they steered their vessels through 
mysterious, uncharted seas. 
AS this world-wide cultural 
evolution brought with it a 
deeper, more universal concern for the 
dignity of man? Perhaps the most 
convincing answer we can give is to 
cite the example of Mrs. Eleanor Roo- 
sevelt who, when she was campaigning 
resolutely for a new charter of human 
rights, was actually fighting against 
prejudices that are far more than cen- 
turies old. 
Nowadays the world is indignant 
whenever it hears of acts of violence 
committed against anyone for racial 
reasons, because in the past twenty 
years people have come to realize 
that this is a crime not against the 
dignity of one man, but of all men. 
Today man’s eyes probe within the 
infinitely tiny world of the atom, search 
the bottom of the ocean, and travel 
around among the stars in satellites 
that are like an image of his own pupil 
projected into the infinite. In less 
than twenty years conquests such as 
these have changed his outlook and 
have made him conscious of being 
a citizen of space. This is the sign 
of a new humanism that is bringing 
men together. 
This does not mean that in the 
past twenty years there have not been 
warning threats of a world-wide catas- 
trophe, nor that all men of the sword 
‘have disappeared. But in the domain 
of culture there has been positive 
progress which we should not over-
