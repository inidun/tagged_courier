### IGNORE

Te United Nations General Assembly has 
called disarmament “the most important 
question facing the world today.” Two aspects of 
this vital question are dealt with in this issue of 
The Unesco Courier. 
The first of these is the significance of the Nuclear 
Test Ban Treaty signed in Moscow just over one 
year ago, which was a first step towards disarma- 
ment and which has already halted the rising threat 
of radiation hazards for all mankind. The second 
aspect is the significance of disarmament in terms 
of housing, hospitals, schools, laboratories, farm 
equipment, in short, in terms of everything that 
could contribute to a better life for everyone. 
In 1962 the United Nations completed its major 
study on “Economic and Social Consequences of 
Disarmament”, and in the same year the General 
Conference of Unesco voted a resolution which 
emphasized the importance of “the diversion of 
even a small proportion of the resources which 
would be released by general and complete disar- 
mament to the long-term programmes of Unesco 
for the planning and development of education, 
scientific research and the development of mass 
communication media.” Unesco has therefore 
undertaken studies on the impact which general 
disarmament would have on education, science 
and culture, and has urged its member states to 
make similar studies. : 
Disarmament would open up vast prospects for all 
mankind. But it will be achieved only through the 
efforts of all men. This challenge will be faced 
more readily if both its problems and its promise 
are clearly understood. The editors of The Unesco 
Courier hope that the present issue will contribute 
in some small measure to that understanding. 


### 62396: Arms cost the world USD120 thousand million per year

  
    
World expenditure on arms 
120,000 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
“A LL the problems of transition connected with disarmament could be met by appro- 
p 
 
riate national and international measures. There should be no doubt that the diversion 
to peaceful purposes of the resources now in military use could be accomplished to the benefit of all 
countries and lead to the improvement of world economic and social conditions. The achievement 
of general and complete disarmament would be an unqualified blessing for mankind.” 
This view, expressed unanimously by an international pane! of economists, is the final conclusion of 
a major study entitled "Economic and Social Consequences of Disarmament’ published by the United 
Nations. “It is particularly encouraging to discover”, writes U Thant, Secretarv-General of the United 
Nations, in its preface, “that it has proved possible for a group of experts drawn from countries with 
different economic systems and at different stages of economic development to reach unanimous 
agreement on a subject that until recently has been so beset by ideological differences.” 
The study reviews the resources devoted to military purposes; it shows the peaceful uses to which 
these resources might be put when released; it examines the conversion problems that might arise, 
and the impact of disarmament on international economic relations and on aid for economic develop- 
4 ment; and it calls attention to some social consequences of disarmament. 
This historic U.N. report deserves to be better known. Some of its major findings are summarized in 
this issue (see opposite, and pages 14 to 17 and 22 to 26).

| HE present level of military expenditure not only 
represents a grave political danger but also 
imposes a heavy economic and social burden on most 
countries. It absorbs a large volume of human and ma- 
terial resources of all kinds which could be used to increase 
economic and social welfare throughout the world—both 
in the highly industrialized countries, which at the present 
time incur the bulk of the world's military expenditures, 
and in the less developed areas. 
On the basis of available data, the world appears to 
be expending roughly $120,000 million annually on mili- 
tary expenditure (1). This is equivalent to about 8 to 9 per 
cent of the world’s annual output of goods and services 
or to at least two-thirds of the entire national income 
of all the developing countries, and is close to the value 
of the world's annual exports of all commodities. 
Nearly 20 million persons now serve in the world's 
armed forces. When other persons occupied directly or 
indirectly in servicing the needs of these armies are_ added, 
the total may well amount to over 50 million. The total 
volume of manpower and of other resources devoted to 
military use at the present times is thus very large indeed. 
In many countries the estimates of military expenditure 
range between 1 and 5 per cent of gross domestic product, 
while in others, particularly in some of the larger countries, 
(1) A 1962 estimate. Today's armaments’ bill is believed to have 
risen to between $130,000 million and $140,000 million. 
  
the corresponding ratio ranges between 5 and 10 per cent. 
The great bulk of the world's military expenditure Is highly 
concentrated in a handful of countries and industrial sectors. 
About 85 per cent of the world's military outlays is accoun- 
ted for by seven countries—Canada, Federal Republic of 
Germany, France, mainland China, U.S.S.R., United King- 
dom and United States. 
Among the major military powers military production Is 
highly concentrated in a few industrial sectors, notably 
munitions, electrical machinery, instruments and related 
products, and transportation equipment, including airplanes 
and missiles. In most other industries military outlays 
account for a relatively small proportion of total demand. 
Industries dependent on military expenditure also have a 
high degree of concentration in certain regions and cities. 
Total military expenditure in all the developing countries 
amounts to about one-tenth of that of the industrial private 
enterprise economies. This means that although many 
developing countries devote significant proportions of their 
resources to military purposes, the great bulk of the 
resources released by disarmament would be concentrated 
in a very few countries. 
The situation is rather different in those countries that 
rely upon imports for their supplies of military goods or 
in which the major part of military expenditure is for the 
pay and subsistence of the armed forces, rather than 
for their equipment. In such cases, the resources devoted 
to military purposes consist essentially of manpower and 
foreign exchange. This is especially true of the developing 
countries.

### 62396: Arms cost the world USD120 thousand million per year

N August 5, 1963 the world learned with relief 
that a Nuclear Test Ban treaty had been signed in 
Moscow (see page 2). This treaty will go down in history 
as the first important step on the road to complete disarmament. 
Concluded between the United Kingdom, the United States 
and the U.S.S.R., it has since been countersigned by over 
100 countries. The banning of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, 
in outer space and under water, brought not only a feeling of 
relief, but also an immense hope. In May 1964, the Executive 
Board of Unesco welcomed the Test Ban treaty as “a noteworthy 
contribution towards the easing of international tensions, as 
tangible proof of the possibility of a peaceful settlement of 
international problems and as a step towards paving the way 
for agreement on general and complete disarmament” and it 
expressed the hope “that this treaty will gain universal support”. 
The first effects of the treaty have become apparent: there has 
already been a significant reduction in the level of radioactive 
contamination whose threat for all mankind would have become 
steadily greater if nuclear weapons tests had continued, This 
was announced recently by the U.N. Scientific Committee on 
the Effects of Atomic Radiation. On page 11 one of the mem- 
bers of this committee, Prof. Alexander M. Kuzin, a prominent 
Soviet bio-chemist, reveals how the health hazards from 
radioactive fall-out are being reduced. Below, Professor Linus 
Pauling evokes some vital world problems of the nuclear age. 
* 
On June 19 of this year the noted U.S. scientist, Linus 
Pauling, spoke at Unesco House in Paris on Science Education 
and its Responsibilities. Professor Pauling has the rare dis- 
tinction of being a double Nobel Prize Winner. For his efforts 
over the past two decades on behalf of world peace and to 
outlaw war he received the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize (awarded 
in 1963); his discoveries in molecular chemistry won him the 
Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954. Professor Pauling was invi- 
ted to speak under the Unesco programme to promote a series 
of university lectures by distinguished visiting scientists. The 
Unesco programme has been organized to show how impor- 
tant is the role of science in the world we live in today. Below 
we present a few salient passages from Prof. Pauling’s address 
dealing with the Test Ban Treaty, modern nuclear weapons 
and the need for disarmament.

| T is the duty of society as a whole to make the 
important decisions regarding social, political 
and economic matters but it is the special duty of the 
scientist to contribute with his special knowledge and 
understanding to a greater extent than other people and to 
help his fellow citizens to reach the right decisions. 
When the Bomb Test Treaty was being discussed last 
year there was one point that was very difficult to com- 
prehend and yet which it was vital that everyone be made 
to understand. That was the nature and amount of the 
damage done to the people of the world and to the pool 
of human germ plasm (that is, to our unborn children) by 
the radioactive materials liberated in the testing of nuclear 
weapons. Never before had it been dangerous to people 
the world over for military establishments to carry out tests 
of their future weapons; but now damage has already been 
done to members of the human race by the nuclear wea- 
pons tests, 
One of the great discoveries of the last few years has 
been the unravelling of the mechanism of heredity. Scien- 
tists have found that the genes are molecules of deoxyri- 
bonucleic acid (DNA) which constitute the units of heredity. 
These genes, as they are passed on from parents to chil- 
dren, determine the nature of the new organisms—our 
offspring. 
There are about 100,000 genes in the fertilized ovum, 
50,000 coming from the father, 50,000 from the mother. If 
the embryo has a poor collection of genes it will die before 
reaching term. Whether a child is healthy or not after 
birth is largely determined by the genes. Seven per cent 
of the children born have gross congenital physical or 
mental defects, and it is estimated that about half of these 
defects are due to mutated genes. For example, about 
one child in twelve hundred is born with a newly mutated 
gene for achondroplasia, which affects the cartilage so 
that the long bones of the body do not grow. Most of 
these children die in infancy but some survive. They are 
achondroplastic dwarfs with large hands, large heads but 
with short “long bones”. This is just one of the thousands 
of ways in which gene mutation can increase human 
suffering.

### 62316: Nuclear weapons and world sanity

NUCLEAR WEAPONS (Cont'd) 
The threat to unborn millions 
High energy radiation, it Is known, causes gene mutation, 
and It is possible to estimate the amount of gene mutation 
resulting from radiation from caesium 137, carbon 14 and 
other radioactive nuclei produced in the testing of nuclear 
weapons and liberated into the atmosphere. These radio- 
active substances, and particularly carbon 14, will continue 
to produce defective children for thousands of years. 
If the human race survives and world population conti- 
nues at a reasonable level, then | have calculated (and the 
UN. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radia- 
tion reached essentially the same conclusion, as did also 
the Federal Radiation Council set up three years ago by 
the U.S. government to study the damage done by high 
energy radiation) that the bomb tests carried out thus far, 
and amounting to 600 megatons, will in the course of time 
affect sixteen million children so severely that they will 
suffer gross physical or mental defects or embryonic, neo- 
natal, or childhood deaths. 
A BOUT one per cent of this total, ar 160,000 in- 
fants, will be stricken in the first generation, but 
the damage will continue with only slight decrease genera- 
tion after generation, year after year, for thousands of years. 
The figure of 160,000 may seem like a small number when 
compared to the four million or so children who are born 
each year with gross physical or mental defects caused by 
natural radioactivity and cosmic radiation which cannot be 
prevented and other causes of gene defects hard to control. 
Nevertheless we should not say that a few thousand 
additional defective children born each year are not a 
matter of any concern to us. As President John F. Kennedy 
said In a broadcast to the American people on the Test 
Ban Treaty in 1963, “the loss of even one human life or 
the malformation of even one baby, who may be born long 
after we are gone, should be of concern to us all. Our 
children and grandchildren are not merely statistics towards 
which we can be indifferent.” 
| should point out that estimates on this subject are very 
difficult to make. The figures | have just given are uncer- 
tain, and everyone should learn to understand the meaning 
of probability and uncertainty, that is, probable error. The 
figure of 16 million that | have indicated is usually described 
as being uncertain by a factor of five either way. So 
perhaps the sacrifice we are making is only three million 
persons—one-fifth of 16 million, or perhaps it is 80 million 
—five times the 16 million, and of course the uncertainties 
may be really greater than this. 
Now, one 20-megaton bomb detonated in the atmosphere 
or at the surface of the earth liberates radioactive materials 
into the atmosphere which will, according to the best 
estimates that we can make, cause gross damage or death 
to 550,000 unborn children. This is the probable sacrifice 
of the testing of a single H-bomb by any one nation. 
Everyone must understand this. 
We know that large amounts of high energy radiation 
produce cancer. If we accept the principle that high 
energy radiation even in small amounts is also cancerogenic 
—as | believe it is—then it is possible to calculate the 
sacrifice of human beings now living to the bomb tests. 
The estimated figure is that two million human beings now 
living will die five, ten, fifteen or twenty years earlier than 
otherwise because of cancer or other diseases produced 
by the high energy radiation liberated in the bomb tests 
carried out so far. This is about one person in fifteen 
hundred in the world, and it gives us some idea of the 
nature of atomic weapons in so far as the tests go. 
Of course there would be a tremendously greater amount 
of contamination with radioactive materials all over the 
earth if there were to be a nuclear war. In addition to the 
destructive and lethal effects of blast, fire, and immediate 
high energy radiation, there would be the effects of local 
fall-out, so that survivors within hundreds of miles of where 
the bombs exploded would generally be exposed to about 
half of the lethal dose that causes acute radiation sickness 
and death within a few days, and these survivors would 
have their portion of the pool of human germ-plasm 
seriously affected. Their lives would be shortened consi- 
derably—on the average by some ten or fifteen years by 
exposure to this high energy radiation. 
Let us now turn to another question—the stock-piling of 
nuclear weapons. The amount of explosives existing in 
the world is enormous, but there has been very little 
discussion of how great the world's nuclear stock piles are. 
The standard nuclear bomb today is the 20-megaton 
bomb. (One megaton equals a million tons.) The Soviet 
Union has detonated a 60-megaton bomb, which was appa- 
rently only the first two stages of a 100-megaton bomb. A 
100-megaton bomb involves only about three and a half 
tons of explosive material and probably can be carried in 
a single large rocket from one continent to another. But 
100-megaton bombs don't make very much sense because 
a 20-megaton bomb is big enough to destroy any city on 
earth. ~ 
A 20-megaton bomb exploded over any city on earth 
would destroy it completely and kill most of the people in 
it. It would produce a crater of twenty kilometres in 
diameter; it would set off fires 50 to 100 kilometres away, 
producing a tremendous fire storm and would damage 
people by the immediate high energy radiation and by the 
radioactive fallout. Even people 300 kilometres away would 
be killed. 
During the second World War there were some great 
bombing raids on German cities. In one such raid, on one 
night, one thousand aeroplanes each carrying four tremen- 
dous one-ton blockbusters destroyed much of the city of 
Hamburg and killed an estimated 75,000 people. If there 
were to be such a raid on, say, Paris today and another 
such 1,000 plane raid tomorrow, and then another the next 
day and so on day after day for fourteen years, the explo- 
sives delivered would have the power of one 20-megaton 
omb. 
| Y estimate is that the stock piles of the world 
comprise about 16,000 of these 20-megaton 
bombs or the equivalent of them. Now, there aren't 16,000 
large cities in the world and one might well ask why this 
irrationally great amount of explosive material has been 
produced. | shall answer this by saying that it is because 
the system of science education has been faulty in the past 
so that the people who were making the decisions could 
not have had a clear understanding of what they were doing 
— if indeed anyone did make the decisions, for there has 
been some doubt as to whether the development of these 
tremendously great stock piles was the result of decision- 
making rather than some sort of accident and shifting of 
responsibility primarily in the United States and the Soviet 
Union and perhaps too in Great Britain to some extent. 
And yet in the Franck Report written by scientists work- 
ing on the atomic bomb project in the U.S. in 1945, a 
prediction was made of the future nuclear situation in 
the world which has turned out to be correct up to the pre- 
sent time.

### 62316: Nuclear weapons and world sanity

NUCLEAR WEAPONS (Cont'd) 
‘The goal of disarmament no longer a dream’ 
320,000 megatons Is my estimate of the size of the 
world's present nuclear stockpiles. If ten per cent of 
the stockplle (32,000 megatons) were to be used in a 
nuclear war with the bombs exploded on the average 
within a hundred and fifty kilometres of the targets (you 
don't have to hit the target in order to get the result) then 
60 days after the day on which the war was fought—and 
we assume that It would cover Europe as a whole, all the 
Soviet Union and the United States—of the 800 million 
people living In these regions, 720 million would be dead, 
60 million severely injured, and there would be 20 million sur- 
vivors with only minor injuries, but having to cope with the 
problems of complete destruction of all cities, metropolitan 
districts, and means of communication and transportation, 
complete disruption of society, death of all livestock, and 
gross radioactive contamination of all growing foods. This 
would be the end of this part of the world, and how great 
the damage would be to the rest of the world no one has 
been able to estimate in a reliable way. 
One can understand why it has been said over and over 
again that no dispute between nations can justify nuclear 
war. U Thant, Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
recently said: “Anybody who proposes the use of atomic 
weapons for destructive purposes Is, in my view, out of 
his mind. We are forced now, in the way that Alfred 
Nobel! foresaw, to abolish war from the world. But it is 
a difficult and complex problem. And yet | feel that 
everyone must accept this conclusion. lt is the duty of 
everyone to work In whatever way he can to achieve the 
world from which war has been abolished. This the only 
rational course for the world to follow. 
The partial test ban treaty signed at Moscow last year 
was a great step forward. | regret very much that this 
treaty was not made three years earlier, during the long 
period when no bomb tests were carried out by any nation 
except France, which only made very small bomb tests. 
Of the total of 600 megatons tested, 450 megatons or 
three-quarters of the total were tested in the last three 
years. Millions of unborn children were sacrificed because 
of the Inability to see that the test ban solution could have 
been accepted three years earlier. | hope that further 
mistakes of this sort are not made. | am grateful for the 
bomb test treaty, but of course we must move forward. 
The test ban treaty is just the beginning. 
The further steps that need to be taken were clearly 
outlined, | think, in the great speech that President Kennedy 
gave in the United Nations in September 1961, when he 
said: “The goal of disarmament is no longer a dream. It 
is a practical matter of life or death. The risks inherent in 
disarmament pale in comparison to the risks inherent in a 
continuing, unlimited arms race.” 
0 F the proposals he made, one, the banning of 
nuclear weapons in outer space, has been ac- 
complished by resolution in the United Nations. (For text, 
see page 13) As for stopping the production of fis- 
sionable material, some steps are being taken in this 
direction by agreement between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. 
The steps toward general and complete disarmament 
will, | think, be taken only with great difficulty. | should 
like to see some action taken in the meantime that would 
decrease the chance of outbreak of a devastating nuclear 
war, perhaps through some psychological or technological 
accident or through some combination of circumstances 
such that even the wisest of national leaders could not 
prevent the descent to catastrophe. 
In my Nobel lecture in Oslo last December [delivered on 
the occasion of the award to Prof. Pauling of the Nobel 
Prize for Peace] | proposed that the American stock pile 
of nuclear weapons and the Soviet stock pile of nuclear 
weapons should, separately, be put under joint national and 
international control, so that the Soviet nuclear weapons 
could not be used except with the permission both of the 
Soviet Premier and of the Secretary-General of the United

be used except by permission both of the President of the 
United States and of the Secretary-General of the U.N. 
| also proposed that there should be in authority in the 
control stations in both countries, United Nations personnel 
as well as Soviet personnel in the U.S.S.R. on the one hand 
and U.N. personnel as well as American personnel in the 
U.S.A. on the other. | believe that even a first step in this 
direction, the step of having United Nations observers in 
these control stations, would be of much value in increasing 
our security and decreasing the chance that these weapons 
would be used. 
| LOOK forward to the time when there is in 
existence in the world a satisfactory system of 
international law taking the place of war. In working to 
abolish war from the world we are working also for human 
freedom, for the rights of individual human beings. It is 
war, militarism, and extreme nationalism that are the great 
enemies of the individual human being in every country. | 
believe that as we achieve the goal of peace in the world 
and disarmament, we shall see great improvement in the 
social, political and economic systems of all nations and 
in the rights of individual human beings all over the world. 
The idea of replacing war by world law is an old one and 
it has continued to be advanced up to the present time. 
Only now has the time come when it will be accepted. As 
Nobel said, “When it becomes possible for two army corps 
to annihilate one another in a second then war will be 
abandoned.” It is now possible not only for two army 
corps but for two great nations to destroy one another 
essentially and completely in a period of time little longer 
than a second—in a few hours. 
Seventy-five years ago the Norwegian legislature, the 
Storting, took the lead in proposing that there be a requir- 
ed system of arbitration for disputes between nations. 
The Storting at that time said: “The Storting is convinced 
that this idea has the support of an overwhelming propor- 
tion of our people. Just as law and justice have long ago 
replaced the role of the fist in settling disputes between 
man and man, so the idea of settling disputes among 
peoples and nations by arbitration is making its way with 
irresistible strength. More and more, war appears to the 
general consciousness as a vestige of prehistoric barbarism 
and a curse to the human race.” 
We have now come to the time in the history of the world 
when we shall eliminate this vestige of prehistoric harbar- 
ism, this curse to the human race. And | believe that 
we are fortunate to be able to contribute to the achieve- 
ment of this great goal, when not only shall we have 
abolished war with its suffering from the world but also 
have made it possible to utilize the resources of the world 
and the discoveries of scientists and the results of man’s 
labour for the benefit of human beings all over the world. 
| believe that we shall in the course of time build a world 
that is characterized by social, political and economic jus- 
tice for all human beings, and a culture worthy of man’s 
intelligence.

by Alexander M. Kuzin 
Member of the U.N. Scientific Committee 
on the Effects of Atomic Radiation 
R 1954, following a long series of atomic and 
hydrogen weapons' tests, scientists first drew 
public attention to the fact that the atmosphere, the oceans 
and the land surfaces of the globe were being contaminated 
by radioactive fall-out. 
They revealed that great quantities of radioactive 
substances ejected into the atmosphere by each explosion 
were being caught up by air currents, carried across the 
globe and slowly deposited on land and sea; these radio- 
active elements were then being rapidly absorbed by 
plants, and were entering the bodies of men and animals 
through vegetable foods. 
Many scientists of the world warned of the great dangers 
presented to humanity by the rise in the radioactivity of the 
environment, and called for an end to the testing of atomic 
and hydrogen weapons. 
In 1955, the United Nations set up a special committee, 
consisting of leading scientists from 15 countries, to make 
an objective assessment of the health hazards of radiation 
from nuclear explosions. In 1958 this committee reported 
to the U.N. General Assembly that if the tests went on at 
no greater rate than that of 1954, hundreds of thousands 
of people would succumb to hereditary disease, and to 
leukemia and cancer caused by the increased radiation 
background. 
Meanwhile, the logic of the arms race caused each new 
series of nuclear text explosions to be considerably more 
powerful than its predecessor. There was a consequent 
increase in the radioactive contamination of the atmosphere, 
of the earth's surface and of the human body. 
When an atomic, and especially a hydrogen bomb, is set 
off in the atmosphere, it produces huge quantities of neu- 
trons which transform the nitrogen of the atmosphere into 
radioactive carbon (C-14). Small quantities of C-14 are 
always present in the atmosphere where they are formed 
through the action of cosmic rays. But the nuclear tests 
produced a rapid increase in the level of C-14. The 1958 
tests alone raised the content of C-14 in 1959 to almost 30 
per cent above its natural level, and the 1961-1962 tests 
increased this concentration by nearly 90 per cent over 
and above the normal quantity. 
Atomic explosions also produce large amounts of two 
other radioactive substances—strontium-80 and caesium- 
137. The 1961-1962 explosions nearly doubled the content 
of strontium-90, as compared with the earlier tests and 11 
there was a similar increase in caesium-137. Both these

FALL-OUT HAZARDS (Cont'd) 
are long-lived isotopes, with a half-life (1) of about 30 
years, which easily penetrate the human system through 
food and then cause protracted irradiation of the internal 
body tissues. 
When nuclear explosions take place, the level of radio- 
activity is also increased by short-lived isotopes (like 
iodine-131) which easily find their way into milk and thus 
into the bodies of children, thereby increasing the possibi- 
lity of subsequent disease. The average levels of radio- 
active iodine content in milk rose sharply in the years of 
the most intensive nuclear tests. 
The danger of which the scientists had warned was 
mounting from year to year. Reporting to the U.N. General 
Assembly in 1962, the U.N. Scientific Committee unanim- 
ously emphasized that the immediate prohibition of nuclear 
blasts would be of the greatest benefit to mankind. 
Many organizations called for the cessation of nuclear 
tests and an end to the contamination of the environment 
with radioactive substances as a first step towards the 
relaxation of international tensions and to general disarm- 
ament. 
Thus the nations of the world hailed with satisfaction the 
signing on August 5, 1963, of the Moscow Treaty Banning 
Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, Under Water 
and in Outer Space. Thanks to the Treaty, no products of 
{1} The time needed for holf of the original atoms of a radioactive substance 
to disintegrate. 
radioactive explosions have been poisoning the world 
around us for the past year or more. 
Has there, in fact, been any change in the amount of 
radiation to which people have been exposed during that 
period? Information reaching the U.N. Scientific Commit- 
tee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation indicates that there 
has already been a reduction in the amount of radioactive 
substances being absorbed into the human body, especially 
in the case of children. There has been a sharp drop, for 
instance, in the amount of short-lived isotopes in the 
surrounding environment. in 1963-1964, their average 
absorption by the human body was down to less than ona 
per cent of the amount absorbed during 1961-1862, when 
the tests were on. As 1964 runs out, it will be virtually 
impossible to detect any pollution of the earth by short 
lived radioactive substances. 
But long-lived radioactive elements such as strontium-90 
and caesium-137 pose greater problems. Intensive 
research over the last ten years suggests that their rate 
of fallout n.ns its course in twelve to eighteen months 
from the lower strata of the atmosphere, but takes much 
longer to complete—up to three years or more—when 
coming from the upper atmosphere layers. 
The bulk of the radioactive debris from the 1961-1962 
explosions, actually produced fallout in 1963. Thanks to 
the halt of testing in the sea, on land and in the air, new 
fallout in 1964 can be expected to drop by 30 per cent, as 
compared with 1563.

### 62319: Fall-out hazards, now and yesterday

On the basis that radioactive debris remains in the 
atmosphere for an average of two years, it is safe to say 
that as from 1965 there will be a sharp cumulative drop 
in the fallout of strontium-90 and caesium-137. The overall 
amount of strontium-90 and caesium-137 in the soil is still 
rising and will contine to rise for another two or three years, 
when it too will decline due to radioactive decay. 
But in spite of the increase of strontium-90 and caesium- 
137 in the soil, far less of these substances will be absorb- 
ed by human beings in 1965 than was the case in 1962- 
1963. The reason is that these elements penetrate plants 
in two ways. Through its roots a plant takes in calcium 
from the soil and also radioactive strontium, which has 
similar chemical properties. Its roots also absorb caesium- 
137 along with potassium. This process will continue for 
some time to come. But fresh radioactive substances 
which are deposited directly on the leaves of growing 
plants are absorbed at a much greater rate. In the years 
of peak fallout, the bulk of the radioactive contamination 
of vegetable foods took place through new fallout. 
‘Thanks to the Test Ban Treaty new fallout began to 
decrease as early as 1964, and a considerable reduction is 
expected in 1965. This will lessen the radioactive pollution 
of foods and reduce the entry of radioactive substances 
into human beings and animals through the food they eat. 
Over the years the reduction will be even more marked. 
With the cessation of tests, our environment will be grad- 
ually cleared of artificial radioactive carbon (C-14). 
Although it has a long half-life (nearly 5,000 years), it will 
be disappearing as it dissolves in the waters of the oceans. 
This year the U.N. Committee on the Effects of Atomic 
Radiation estimated that if the Test Ban Treaty is observed, 
the artificial radioactive carbon content is bound to fall 
from 85 per cent over and above the natural level in 1964, 
to 60 per cent in 1969, and that it will be down to three per 
cent by the end of the century. 
Children are the most sensitive to the effects of radia- 
tion. That is why there has always been so much concern 
over the fact that during the tests large amounts of radio- 
active iodine, radioactive strontium and radioactive caesium 
were being absorbed by children via milk, and that the 
strontium-90 content in children's bones was increasing 
from year to year. However, their food is now being freed 
of these noxious elements. It is entirely free of radioactive

iodine, and the amount of other radioactive substances is 
dropping. 
Many thousands of children would inevitably have fallen 
victim to disease if the tests had been continued; many 
other potential victims will be spared over the next few 
years by the strict observance of the Moscow Treaty.

The Moscow Test-Ban Treaty marks a first stage In the 
easing of international tension; it also demonstrates the 
possibility that the threat of thermo-nuclear war can be 
averted, that the use of nuclear weapons can be banned 
and that agreement can be reached on general and com- 
plete disarmament—the present hope and goal of all whose 
concern is for the future of mankind.

ene are so many competing claims for 
usefully employing the resources released by 
disarmament that the real problem is to establish a scale 
of priorities. The most urgent of these claims would 
undoubtedly already have been largely satisfied were it 
not for the armaments race. 
The resources liberated by disarmament within any 
country could be employed in part to promote economic 
and social progress at home and in part to expand foreign 
ald. The main civilian purposes for which the freed re- 
sources whether domestic or foreign in origin, could be 
applied, may be classified as follows: 
® Raising standards of personal consumption of goods 
and services; 
® Expanding or modernizing productive capacity through 
investment in new plant and equipment; 
® Promoting housing construction, urban renewal, 
including slum ‘clearance, and rural development; 
® Improving and expanding facilities for education, 
health, welfare, social security, cultural development, scien- 
tific research, etc. 
The resources freed by disarmament could ultimately be 
used for any one or more of these purposes and in any 
combination. Labour can be retrained and, where ne- 
cessary, can move to other areas. As old equipment 
becomes obsolete it can be replaced by new equipment 
orlented to new patterns of demand. In the long run, 
there should be little difficulty in adapting resources to 
needs. 
Y contrast, in the very short run the range of 
choice may be somewhat more limited. It takes 
time to turn swords into ploughshares or to make an office 
clerk or factory worker out of a soldier. Studies in some 
industrial countries have shown that the productive 
capacities released from military use would be much more 
immediately adaptable to the increased output of consumer 
durables and industrial equipment than to the production 
of houses, food clothing or educational facilities. 
Thus, in the transition period, countries may wish to 
take into account not merely the unsatisfied needs for 
higher consumption, investment and foreign aid, but also 
the extent to which alternative patterns of new expenditure 
would take full advantage of the particular resources that 
disarmament would make available. Some major military 
powers now have fairly confortable margins of productive 
capacity. In these cases it is unikely that disarmament would 
generate many new demands that could not fairly readily 
be satisfied from available resources. : 
In the centrally planned economies, even though they 
have generally been operating approximately at capacity,

the transfer of industrial capacity and labour force to the 
production of goods for peaceful uses could be achieved 
in a relatively short time. This transfer could be readily 
achieved by measures formulated within the framework of 
the general economic plans which can ensure a desirable 
balance between demand and resources. 
In the developing countries the principal resource 
released, apart from the purely financial, would be man- 
power, both skilled and unskilled. In some cases a signi- 
ficant proportion of industrial and transport capacity would 
also become available for other uses. In many there would 
also be considerable savings in foreign exchange. The 
effective utilization of released resources would depend 
upon the soundness and vigour of development program- 
mes and the volume and character of aid received. 
Personal consumption and productive investment. Among 
the alternative uses of resources released by disarma- 
ment, increased personal consumption might well absorb 
a large share. It is fair to suppose that even in the 
developed countries there would be strong pressure 
on governments tv raise the level of living. Disarmament 
would, in particular, offer an important opportunity to 
raise incomes of low income sections of the population 
and to facilitate equalizing the rates of pay for men and 
women. 
Part of the gain from disarmament could also take the 
form of an increase in leisure as, for example, through a 
reduction in average working hours without a correspond- 
ing reduction in real income, or through an increase in paid 
vacations.

‘In most countries, however, not all the resources freed 
by disarmament would be allocated directly to consumption, 
no matter what the level of income might be. In the first 
place, a substantial portion of the released resources would 
be used for expansion of productive capacities because 
only such expansion can provide a firm basis for further 
increases in consumption. 
Social investment. Social investment is an impor- 
tant alternative both to private consumption and to indus- 
trial and agricultural investment. Its claims rest partly 
upon the clear urgency of the direct need for improved 
social amenities, and partly upon the fact that growth of 
industrial and agricultural productivity is dependent upon 
developments in education, housing, health, and other 
fields. Since social investment has had to compete with 
military claims for state funds, it (like aid to developing 
countries) has probably been particularly affected by the 
armaments race. 
I the United States the National Planning Asso- 
ciation estimated at the end of 1359 the cumu- 
lative expenditure requirements for selected governmant pro- 
grammes over the next five years. These estimates were not 
intended to be precise but simply represented a summary of 
the existing programmes of development and improvement in 
various fields over the next five years. The significance 
of these estimates, which imply annual average expenditures 
of $66 thousand million, may be judged from the fact that 
the present spending of the Federal, State and local gov-

each with 
ernments on all these programmes amounts to about $30 
thousand million per year. It is therefore apparent that 
these programmes could absorb much or most of any 
resources released by disarmament. 
In the Soviet Union the task has been set of achieving 
a sharp improvement in living standards within the next 
twenty years by raising the income of the population and 
also by expanding social benefits (education, health pro- 
tection, social insurance, housing construction, etc.). As 
stated in an official document, “general and complete dis- 
armament on the basis or an appropriate agreement be- 
tween States would make it considerably easier to overfulfil, 
the planned improvement in the living standards of the 
working people”. 
The problem of urban renewal is world-wide. In 1950 
about 80 per cent of the world's population was still living 
in rural areas. Between 50 and 60 million people are being 
added to the world's total population every year, mainly to 
its urban areas. In Asia as many as 500 million persons 
may be added between 1950 and 1975 to the population of 
cities with over 20,000 inhabitants. In Latin America, 
sixty-two cities with over 100,000 people accounted in 
1960 for some 40 per cent of the region's total. In Africa 
a considerably higher rate of growth is taking place in 
urban areas than in rural areas. Rapid urbanization is 
characteristic of Europe and North America. 
The rural and urban environments in many countries are 
both deteriorating, mainly under the impact of this rapid 
growth. The social and physical symptoms are bad hous-

THE SWORD AND THE PLOUGHSHARES (Cont'd) 
A new approach to world-wide 
prosperity through disarmament 
ing, poor community services and delinquency, the para- 
lysis of city traffic, and in many of the less developed 
countries an absence of sanitation and a high incidence 
of communicable disease. In many metropolitan cities of 
such less developed countries “squatters’ settlements” 
already contain a considerable part of the population. 
In India alone approximately $1 thousand million a year 
will be required to house the new inhabitants of cities with 
over 100,000 people. The provision of city-wide services, 
utilities and transportation would at least double the needed 
investment. 
In Latin America it was estimated by the Organization of 
American States in 1954 that an annual investment of $1.4 
thousand million was required over a period of thirty years 
to wipe out the housing backlog, to replace obsolescent 
dwellings and to provide new homes. According to rough

estimates by the United Nations Bureau of Social Affairs, 
as many as 150 million families in the less developed coun- 
tries are in need of adequate homes. These immense 
requirements are contributing in many developing countries 
to the maintenance of a level of spending on housing and 
urban development such that the pressing claims of directly 
productive sectors have to be curtailed. 
In the Soviet Union a housing shortage still exists despite 
the building of dwellings for nearly 50 million people in 
a five year period. In order to overcome the shortage and 
house every family in “a separate, comfortable apartment”, 
an increase in twenty years of about 200 per cent would 
be required in the existing housing facilities. To reach 
this goal the average annual housing construction needs 
to be raised from the target of 135 million square metres 
in 1961-65 to 400 million square metres in 1976-80. 
Another field in which the supply of social capital is 
deficient in many countries is road and air transportation. 
The rapid increase in the stock of automobiles and the lag 
in road facilities in these countries during the post-war 
years have been accompanied by extraordinary congestion 
and a rising accident rate. Airports and other air facilities 
are also deficient in many developing countries as well as 
in some more advanced economies, and investment in civil 
aviation will claim a share of the resources freed by dis- 
armament. 
The development and conservation of natural resources 
provides another important field for increased outlays in 
the event of disarmament. In the United States it has been 
estimated that Federal expenditure requirements up to 
1980 in the field of water resource development alone total 
almost $55 thousand million, while $173 thousand million 
will ‘be needed for non-Federal programmes. The Soviet 
Union could advance the preparation and implementation 
of a number of important nature-transforming projects in 
various parts of the country in order to improve living and 
working conditions for the people. There is, for example, 
a plan to divert part of the waters of the Pechora, Vychegda 
and Ob Rivers (now flowing into the Arctic Ocean) into 
"the basins of the Volga and the Caspian and Ara! Seas. 
This would bring about a considerable change in the climate 
and in living conditions in Central Asia and in the southern 
European part of the Soviet Union. In the developing 
countries there are also many important multipurpose 
schemes for the conservation and the utilization of water 
resources. (See “The Unesco Courier”, July/August 1964.) 
THe world's demand for water is growing much 
more rapidly than the supply. Increasing sup- 
plies are needed not merely in order to keep pace with 
the rapid rise in population, but also in order to meet the 
still faster growing needs for irrigation and industry. Further 
expansion necessitates increasingly heavy investment in 
obtaining access to other sources, including the purification 
of sea water. 
Other urgent requirements for natural resources develop- 
ment and conservation exist in the fields of forestry, soil 
and watershed conservation, rangeland conservation, park 
and recreational development and fish and wildlife con- 
servation. 
Investment in health, education and social services. 
There is an urgent need for improvement in health ser- 
vices throughout the world. In many countries 
the ratio of doctors, dentists and other medical personnel 
to the population is inadequate and even falling, and there 
are also great deficiencies in the supply of hospitals and 
hospital beds as well as of other basic health facilities. 
In some of the poorer countries of Europe, for example, 
the medical facilities available to each doctor have been 
estimated to be as little as one-fiftieth of those in the better 
equipped countries. Yet even in the richest countries 
there is great need to improve standards of medical ser- 
vices. In Canada and the United States, for instance, the 
deficit in hospital beds has been estimated at from a quarter 
to a half of the existing number. In the developing coun- 
tries the need for improved medical care is obviously 
greater. Infant mortality rates are in excess of 100 per 
1,000 in many of these countries as opposed to rates of 
20 to 30 per 1,000 in economically advanced countries.

of LE Ps 
“Complete disarmament cannot be effected in 
single step, although each step should be in 
~ that direction.” 
  
An indication of the magnitude of investment require- 
ments for medical care may be gained from projections for 
the United States. The present rate of construction, plus 
a limited programme of renovation, modernization and 
increase in rehabilitation facilities, would require at least 
$15 thousand million over the next decade instead of the 
$9 thousand million that would be needed if such changes 
were not carried out. In the Soviet Union it has been 
officially suggested that hospital accommodation might be 
increased by 40 per cent (that is, by several hundred 
thousand beds) at low cost by converting into hospitals 
part of the buildings now in military use. 
In most developed countries educational needs are rising 
and are bound to expand even more rapidly; with-the ever 
wider spread of technical progress there will be a rising

scientific and technological skills and on a broader range 
of knowledge. At the same time greater efforts will be 
directed towards reducing the drop-out rate of the less 
talented and towards ensuring that an increasing proportion 
research and development effort currently serves military 
purposes. With disarmament it would thus become 
possible to encourage programmes of basic scientific 
research in fields which have hitherto been neglected, and 
to mobilize great scientific potential for the solution of 
some of the world's greatest problems in medicine, urban 
development and reorganization and the technical prob- 
lems associated with the economic development of the 
developing countries. If human ingenuity, in the space 
of a very few years, has so vastly increased man's powers 
for destruction, .it should be able to make an equally 
massive contribution to peaceful and constructive achieve- 
ment. 
I some instances satisfaction of the needs al- 
ready described will require international co- 
operation. Serious gaps exist in the permanent world-wide 
network of meteorological observing stations and in the 
corresponding telecommunication facilities, and far more 
funds are needed for basic research on improving meteoro- 
logical services. There is also considerable scope for in- 
ternational co-operation in developing world air transport 
facilities.

by a recently adopted African programme (1). The total cost 
of this programme is expected to increase from $590 million 
in the first year to $1,150 million in 1965, $1,880 million 
in 1970 and $2,600 million in 1980. It is assumed that 
the share of national income devoted to education will 
rise from three to four per cent between 1961 and 1965, and 
thereafter will increase further, reaching 6 per cent of 
national income by 1980. This means that the difference, 
amounting in the same years to $140 million, $450 million, 
$1,010 million and $400 million, respectively, would need 
to be covered by foreign aid. 
There are also urgent requirements for expansion in 
social services. Even the most advanced countries have 
too few child welfare services, vocational rehabilitation 
agencies, community centres and other special services. 
The recent acceleration of population growth and of 
technical change make it certain that the need, and the 
demand, will grow. Social investment therefore is likely 
to claim increasing resources, to which disarmament 
would make a welcome contribution.

Disarmament would also open up possibilities for joint

including the utilization of atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes, space research, the exploration of the Arctic 
and Antarctic for the benefit of mankind and projects to 
change the climates of large areas of the world. Joint 
research into the earth's interior may lead to discoveries 
that would be of real value to the whole world. In 
addition, joint projects to assist the development of the 
developing countries as well as programmes of co-opera-

These international projects could have a major impact 
on world living standards and civilization. 
It is evident that the resources freed by disarmament 
would not be large enough for the many claims upon them. 
Though it would take active decisions by governments in 
the light of national and international needs to set in motion 
programmes for employing the released resources, it 
seems abundantly clear that no country need fear a lack {7

would become available to it through disarmament.

in the atomic age 
Mankind after Hiroshima. (437 x 292 cm.) 
  
  
We and peace have frequently inspired 
the painter and artist down the ages. 
But the theme of war and peace in the atomic age is 
now the subject of an arresting series of nine tapestries 
just completed by the world-renowned French artist, 
Jean Lurcat, whose modern works during the past 
40 years have been instrumental in reviving the 
ancient art of tapestry. Lurcat has named his latest 
efforts Le Chant du Monde (Song of the World). The 
nine works woven in glowing colours have a total 
length of 230 feet and cover a surface of 3,230 square 
feet. We present here some details of these tapestries 
which were recently exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. 
As a contrast to four images depicting the horrors of a 
nuclear holocaust in which all man’s works and 
mankind itself would be destroyed, Lurcat presents 
five others evoking the triumph of peace. Lurgat 
has commented on his works in these words: “Our 
generation has lived through two wars and now over 
our heads and over all those who are to follow us 
there hangs a terrible threat: the atomic horror. That 
is why | have called my first panel The Great Threat; 
it also explains why | have shown a sinister-eyed 
eagle hovering above the world and a buffalo spraying 
poison over all things living or as yet unconceived.” 
But Lurcat believes that human reason will prevail: 
his nightmare images of mankind annihilated and art 
and civilization reduced to dust give place to Man in 
the Glory of Peace. He is now working on a sequel 
to Song of the World, its themes will be love, 
friendship and everyday joys.

NEW NAMES IN THE TABLE OF ELEMENTS. When 
all the known chemical elements were classified 
according to their atomic weights in 1869 the last 
on the list, N° 92, was uranium—at that time the 
heaviest known element. Since the fission of uranium 
the production of new elements (by irradiation of 
existing substances) has raised the total in the Periodic 
Table of Elements to over 100. Among the new names 
are neptunium, einsteinium and mendelevium (named 
after Dimitri Mendeleyev, who arranged the first 
table of elements according to the periodic law). 
  
Shee they were inaugurated in 1957 the 
Pugwash international meetings have come to 
occupy an important place in the world forum of thought 
and discussion on the implications of modern science for 
the future of mankind. In September of this year the 
13th Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs 
brought together an international group of prominent 
scientists and scholars in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia. 
The meeting held far-ranging discussions on a host of 
questions with political implications such as measures for 
reducing tensions and dangers of war, the current status 
of proposals for arms limitation, progress in achieving 
comprehensive disarmament, problems of collective 
security, and two questions of particular interest to 
Unesco, the role and the responsibility of the scientist 
in the cause of peace and economic development of the 
emerging countries. 
On the role and responsibility of the scientist in advanc- 
ing the cause of peace the Pugwash Conference presented 
its conclusions in clear and unequivocal terms. “In our 
time,” it said, “two challenges have been placed before 
mankind: to abolish war and to create a world advancing 
toward greater and more universal wellbeing.” 
The Pugwash Conference * declared that the first 
challenge called for universal disarmament and peaceful 
co-operation among countries having different economic 
and political systems and that the second implied that this 
co-operation must be not merely passive but active and 
constructive. The Pugwash Conference pointed out that 
both challenges are the result of the scientific revolution 
and hence that scientists have a personal and professional 
responsibility in both areas. 
“The Increasing role and importance of science in a 
contemporary society,” the Pugwash statement declared, 
“inevitably results in an increasing influence and respon- 
sibility of scientists in the economic, cultural and political 
development of nations. They should use their influence 
to promote further reduction of international tensions, and 
increases in international contacts and co-operation. They 
should help their governments in the development of poli- 
cies contributing to permanent peace and in the well-being 
of all people.” 
Te Pugwash conferences owe their name to 
the little Canadian town of Pugwash in Nova 
Scotia where the first meeting was opened on July 6, 1957. 
The idea for Pugwash was born as a spontaneous 
movement among scientists seeking an international 
exchange of ideas on the impact of science on human 
affairs. The first meeting was sparked by a bold statement 
on the dangers of war signed by a roster of internationally 
famous scientists headed by Albert Einstein and Bertrand 
Russell. On the agenda of the first meeting were three 
challenging topios : (1) the problem of radiological dangers 
(2) problems of atomic disarmament (3) responsibilities 
of the scientists in the atomic age. 
Pugwash conferences have maintained their original 
informal character. Those participating attend as indivi- 
duals and not as representatives of their respective coun- 
tries. They are present as scientists, often of Nobel Prize 
winning stature, who have given much thought to the 
implications of science on modern society. An increasing 
interest is being shown by governments in the Pugwash 
conferences. At the September 1964 conference messages

### 62329: Pugwash; a world movement on the responsibility of the scientist in world affairs

A world movement on the responsibility 
~ of the scientist in world affairs 
  
were received from the heads of several governments as 
well as from the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
The Pugwash Conferences have come to be known as 
one of the great scientific meeting grounds of scientists 
from countries with different economic and political systems, 
national Pugwash committees have been set up on all 
continents and the Pugwash conferences are increasingly 
being referred to throughout the world as “The Pugwash 
Movement.” 
Te Unesco draft programme and budget for 
1965-66, in referring to the continued co- 
operation between the Unesco Secretariat and associations 
of scientists who are concerned with the problem of 
economic and social development as affected by 
disarmament, singles out for particular mention the 
Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. 
Important Pugwash conferences have been held in recent 
years in Great Britain, the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A. India, 
Austria and other countries with the focus of attention 
broadening to include the consideration of international 
scientific co-operation and the role of scientists in aid to 
developing nations. 
From the Pugwash deliberations in Vienna in September 
1958 came a seven-point declaration reflecting the unani- 
mity of opinion of 70 leading scientists from all parts of 
the world. This declaration stressed the necessity of 
ending war, of ending the arms race, what war would mean, 
the hazards of nuclear tests, the need for scientific 
co-operation, the development of technology in the service 
of peace and the responsibility of scientists. 
As the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists wrote: “Future 
historians may look on September 20, 1958 as a significant 
date, and on the Vienna Declaration as an important docu- 
ment in the history of man's transition 10 lving in the 
scientific age.” (1) 
The seventh and eighth Pugwash conferences held in 
Stowe, Vermont (U.S.A) three years later, in 1961, were 
perhaps even more significant and produced a wirtual 
“Charter for International Co-operation.” They demons- 
trated strikingly the belief of scientists everywhere in 
international co-operation in all areas of science. All 
participants agreed on the urgent need for large scale 
expansion of present international co-operation, not only 
in pure science, where such co-operation has been tradi- 
tional, but also in large technological undertakings such as 
space rocketry, drilling through the earth's crust, global 
weather prediction, and technical assistance to newly 
developing countries. 
As participants permitted their imaginations to roam 
freely over all areas of scientific endeavour in which inter- 
national co-operation and sponsorship could lead to vastly 
accelerated progress, the atmosphere became charged 
with enthusiasm and the dark clouds of political conflict 
seemed to recede. As one participant observed "it was 
an exhilarating experience.” 
Among the questions taken up at the September 1964 
Pugwash conference were some of the long term conse- 
quences of disarmament on the development of science 
and technology. Unesco, which has a special interest 
in this problem, sent two top-ranking officials (the director 
of its Department of Application of Science to Develop- 
ment, and the deputy-director of its Department of Social 
Sciences) as observers to the meeting. It is hoped to 
establish continuing working relations between the Unesco

UNESCO'S PROGRAMME ON PEACE AND DISARMAMENT 
HAT are the ideas of the man 
in the street on disarmament and 
its long term consequences? 
What image does the general public 
have of a world without arms ? What 
use should be made of the resources 
freed by disarmament? A public 
opinion survey on these questions is 
being made in France, Norway and 
Poland by the European Centre of Co- 
ordination of Research and Documen- 
tation, located in Vienna (Austria) 
with help from Unesco. Results of 
the survey will be available next year. 
This is one example of the peace 
research and studies on the effects of 
disarmament which Unesco is carrying 
out or sponsoring, following the publi- 
cation of the historic United Nations 
report on the Economic and Social 
Consequences of Disarmament in 1962, 
Further development of these activities 
is foreseen in Unesco’s proposed pro- 
gramme for 1965-1966. 
One of the long-term consequences 
of general disarmament is the opening 
up of vast possibilities for the 
development of science and the appli- 
cation of science and technology, 
especially in the developing nations. 
Unesco is setting up a scientific study 
group to consider how resources even- 
tually released by disarmament could 
be used for basic research and also 
applied to new, creative programmes 
of international co-operation in science 
and technology. 
In several countries in which disarm- 
ament would have far-reaching 
effects, Unesco is carrying out a study 
of how to increase the transfer from 
developed to developing countries of 
some of the potentially huge resources 
“ed in an 
for education which would become 
available through disarmament. Re- 
sults of this research will be published 
next year. 
Unesco will maintain close contacts 
with national. Institutes and centres 
concerned with peace research, Many 
of these organizations are now group- 
international peace and 
disarmament research association. 
Facts and figures about well over 
100 institutions working on problems 
of peace will be given in an Interna- 
tional Repertory being prepared for 
Unesco by the Peace Research Insti- 
tute in Oslo, (Norway). Unesco will 
pursue its collaboration with the 
Pugwash Conferences on Science and 
World Affairs whose aims are closely 
related to Unesco’s activities in this 
area.

### 62332: The Economic impact of disarmament

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT 
OF DISARMAMENT 
R EALIZATION that the disarmament issue is as 
important as the survival of humanity itself is 
now world-wide. In this age of rapid change we may 
indeed one day see the negotiation of a multilateral disar- 
mament agreement. Nations will then have to make 
economic adjustments of considerable size. Thousands of 
millions of dollars are involved. Giant industries and 
millions of job-holders have a stake in the outcome. 
Millions of men in arms will have major accommodations 
to make. 
In its report on the long-term consequences of disar- 
mament, the U.N. has concluded that “all the problems and 
difficulties of transition connected with disarmament could 
be met by appropriate national and international measures”. 
Disarmament would raise both general problems of 
maintaining the over-all level of economic activity and 
employment and specific problems in so far as manpower 
or productive capacity might require adaptation to non- 
military needs. 
In the economic life of all countries, shifts in the pattern 
of demand and in the allocation of productive resources are 
continually occurring. The reallocation of productive 
resources which would accompany disarmament is in many 
respects merely a special case of the phenomenon of 
economic growth. 
The post-war conversion was a much larger one and 
involved a more rapid transfer of resources than total 
disarmament would require at present. During the last 
years of the war, the world devoted about one half of its 
resources to destruction. The real military expenditure and 
the number of people in uniform were about four times as 
high as today. Nevertheless, huge armies were quickly 
demobilized without a significant rise in unemployment in 
most countries, and the pace of recovery, particularly of 
industrial output, was impressively rapid. 
P urine the post-war conversion, the major 
concern of economic policy was to restrain, 
rather than to ‘maintain, over-all demand. In adopting a 
programme of general and complete disarmament, however, 
it would be important to maintain a high general level of 
domestic demand for goods and services and thereby to 
support satisfactory levels of output and employment. 
Much attention has already been given in the industria- 
lized private enterprise economies to the methods by which 
total effective demand can be maintained. 
Monetary and fiscal policy could be used to offset the 
effect of a shortfall in total demand that might result from 
a decline in government expenditure. Bearing in mind, 
however, that a substantial part of military expenditure 
would probably be replaced by other government expen- 
diture in most countries, it may be concluded that the 
maintenance of effective demand in the face of disarma- 
ment should not prove difficult. 
For many developing countries, the effect of disarmament 
upon the industrial countries’ demands for primary pro- 
ducts, and thus on the export earnings of the primary 
producing countries, would be of great importance. So 
would the methods of dealing with the liquidation of stra- 
tegic stockpiles. 
In the centrally planned economies, the maintenance of 
effective demand while reducing military expenditure would 
be simply a matter of efficiency of planning techniques. 
Since decisions concerning the production of military out- 
put as well as of investment and consumer goods are co- 
ordinated through the national economic plan, the substitu- 
tion of one type of expenditure for another does not raise 
any basic problems, and in consequence, effective demand 
could be readily maintained. The principal problems of con- 
version would then concern the physical adaptation of 
plants producing armaments to the production of goods for 
civilian use. 
ET even with the successful maintenance of 
total effective demand during a period of 
disarmament, significant problems of adjustment would 
remain in specific sectors and areas of the economy. 
Part of the personnel released by the armed forces and the 
armaments industry would have to be trained or retrained 
so as to permit absorption into peacetime occupations. 
Some plant and equipment would have to be converted. 
Productive capacity might contract in some industries, and 
might have to be expanded in others. Where the manu- 
facture of armaments has been concentrated in particular 
regions, it would be necessary either to shift resources out 
of those regions to other areas of growing demand, or 
alternatively to undertake schemes of redevelopment, 
Steps would have to be taken to modify the direction of 
research and of technological development. 
The resources now supplying military requirements could 
be adapted to peacetime needs partly by shifts within 
industries and plants. For instance, there might be a shift 
from tanks to tractors, from military to civilian aircraft, 
from naval vessels to merchant ships, or from electronic 
equipment for military purposes to television sets. This 
might be a relatively easy procedure, in many cases 
involving little more than changes in designs, retooling, 
and minor adaptations of skills, particularly in plants and 
enterprises which already produce both military and civi- 
lian goods. 
Shifts between industries might call for a more complex 
form of conversion requiring the output of some industries 
to be completely stopped or sharply curtailed and that of 
others to be correspondingly expanded. In some countries,

DISARMAMENT (Cont'd) 
Refrigerators, cycles

in place of arms 
Developing countries generally have been meeting their 
requirements for military goods and services by imports, 
so that their disarmament would release foreign exchange 
rather than industrial workers. It would also free members 
of the forces with many useful skills and training. Some of 
these would be absorbed by the growing labour market; 
others could be usefully employed in the development of 
social capital by construction of minor irrigation works, 
feeder-roads and other community development projects, 
which would help to mitigate the already acute problem of 
underdevelopment. 
In some of the semi-industrialized countries, however, 
the newly started basic industries which manufacture 
chemical fertilizers, heavy machine tools, heavy vehicles, 
aircraft and electronic equipment, have been serving both 
military and civilian needs. In the event of disarmament 
these Industries could concentrate, without any transitional 
difficulty, on the manufacture of capital goods so urgently 
needed for both consumer goods industries and capital 
goods Industries. Transport capacity, particularly vehicles, 
released from military uses, would supplement the inade- 
quate transport facilities available in the present. stage of 
their development. 
| N the centrally planned economies, productive 
capacity is usually fully utilized. Thus it 
would be necessary to convert plants producing military 
equipment to production of durable consumer goods and 
of such Investment goods as can be produced in them 
with only minor retooling. Such conversion could be 
achieved rapidly. Many plants producing military equip- 
ment produce also certain goods for civilian purposes. 
In Poland, for instance, plants which manufacture military 
equipment also account for about 50 per cent of the 
national output of motor cycles and scooters, 80 per cent 
of the sewing machines, 70 per cent of the washing ma- 
chines and 30 per cent of the refrigerators produced in 
the country. 
Some special problems would arise with regard to re- 
employment and training of manpower and reorientation of 
scientific research. While most members of the armed 
forces have received training that would fit them easily for 
civilian life, a special effort would have to be made to find 
suitable employment for the rest. Some of them might be 
called on to serve in various capacities in the international 
organs to be set up for control of disarmament. 
The demobilization of the non-professional members of 
the armed forces would involve a much larger number of 
persons. But most of these men have been drawn from 
civilian life where they were previously engaged in non- 
military occupations. In many cases, however, they have 
acquired new technical skills while in military service. In 
most of the underdeveloped countries, the regular armed 
forces possess a much higher level of industrial and tech- 
nical skills than the civilian population; this would tend to

AND INDUSTRIES were demobilized with a 
minimum of friction and dis- 
give them a relatively greater chance of being absorbed 
into civilian employment, particularly in an expanding 
economy. 
In some countries, which are faced with shortages of 
manpower, the availability of a larger labour force could 
indeed contribute to an acceleration of the rate of economic 
growth. Moreover, the financial resources released by 
disarmament should make it possible to arrange for termi- 
nation pay and special allowances for various types of 
training. The Government of the United States carried 
out, after the Second World War, a large programme for 
education, training and job placement for demobilized army 
personnel. Nearly eight million veterans took advantage of 
the training programme. 
In industries depending heavily on military orders, many 
of the employees possess a level of skill that should find 
gainful employment in other branches of production, so 
long as over-all effective demand is rising. Moreover,

be needed for employment, it could be acquired through 
the facilities for apprenticeship and on-the-job training 
often provided by individual firms or plants for their new 
labour force. Even so, there might be some cases which 
would require special assistance to encourage the adapta- 
tion of skills to new jobs. 
Owing to the concentration of military output in a few 
industries, termination of military contracts would bear 
specially upon the activities of particular enterprises. To 
facilitate readjustment, attempts should be made to diver- 
sify the structure of employment by developing new 
industries where possible; adequate relocation allowances 
should be provided to facilitate the movement of those who 
are mobile to areas where the labour market is expanding; 
and adequate relief should be granted io those whose 
attachment to the locality is too deep or whose age is too 
advanced to contemplate moving to other areas. The costs 
of such measures would be very small in relation to the 
resources that disarmament would release. 
The magnitude of the task of shifting scientific and tech- 
nical personnel to non-military fields of research would 
differ from country to country, but no reduction in the 
actual employment of scientific and technical personnel 
need be feared, because the demand for civilian research 
would increase rapidly. Indeed, one of the main reasons 
why scientific research is still far from adequately applied 
in many civilian fields is the fact that highly qualified per- 
sonnel have been scarce, and have been pre-empted by 
military demands. 
A more adequate supply of specialists would make it 
possible to open up new fields of inquiry, hitherto virtually 
neglected, as well as to devote larger resources to existing 
lines of scientific investigation in both the developed and 
developing countries. The scope for peaceful research in 
the physical, chemical, biological and human sciences is 
unlimited, and the potential benefits to the whole of huma- 
nity incalculable.

COUNTRIES 
I) isanmanent would be bound to have favou- 
rable effects on the development of Interna- 
tional economic relations. The political detente that would 
accompany an International disarmament programme would 
in itself imply that nations were willing to reconsider their 
economic relations with one another. The consequent 
relaxation of international tensions would provide a sound 
basis for reduction of trade barriers and for modification 
of existing trade agreements and trading practices. 
In the long run this would encourage an expansion of 
international trade, a more rational international division 
of labour and a more effective use of the world's resources. 
In the short term it might help conversion by generating 
new demand for exports from existing sources of supply 
that could be satisfied fairly easily from existing capacities. 
The promotion of economic and social development in 
developing countries is one of the most important ways 
in which the resources released by disarmament could be 
put to use. 
The world's military expenditures appear to far exceed 
the combined gross investment expenditures of the less 
developed areas; they are probably at least five times as 
large and may be much greater. A much larger volume 
of resources could thus be allocated to investment for 
productive development in these countries even if only a 
fraction of the resources currently devoted to military 
purposes were used in this way. 
Assuming that the necessary national development pro- 
grammes and soclal and institutional reforms were effec- 
tively realized, developing countries would be able to 
absorb a considerably larger flow of productive investment. 
The total amount of foreign capital required by the 
developing countries, over and above their domestic 
resources devoted to investment, is estimated to range 
from $6 thousand million to $10 thousand million annually. 
Would disarmament release in sufficient quantity the parti- 
The latest atomic submarines cost some 
$160,000,000 each. With this money over 
50 cities could each be provided with a 
modern $ 3 million hospital. 
* 
The total cost of developing one of the 
latest supersonic fighter planes has been 
estimated at over $6,500 million. This 
would build 600,000 new $10,000 homes 
to house more than three million people. 


### 62333: Disarmament and the developing countries

DISARMAMENT AND 
THE DEVELOPING 
    
cular resources required for economic development? Is 
the present institutional framework of aid tc developing 
countries likely to be affected by disarmament? 
In the longer run, productive capacities can be adapted 
to any changed patterns of demand, and provided that the 
needs of the developing countries are known in sufficient 
detail, no serious problems should arise in matching 
resources to uses. Even in the short run, however, it 
seems probable that a significantly large proportion of the 
resources absorbed for military use would indeed prove 
to be of a type useful for investment in developing coun- 
tries. An important proportion of military expenditure . 
absorbs the output of heavy industry and of the engineering 
and construction industries. The output of these industrial 
sectors could undoubtedly make a valuable contribution 
to the industrialization of the less developed areas and 
to their accumulation of social capital. Transportation and 
communication equipment, an important component of 
military expenditure, is urgently required by developing 
countries. 
ISARMAMENT would also release scientific 
research workers and engineers, who could 
be utilized for other purposes. In the event of disarma- 
ment, it should prove possible for the industrialized 
countries to provide greater technical assistance and 
thereby help remove one of the serious limitations to 
development efforts in these countries. Furthermore, 
disarmament would free from military service in both the 
more advanced and the less developed countries large 
groups of young people. Past experience in utilizing 
their good will and enthusiasm in a number of countries 
indicates that when completely freed from military preoc- 
cupations, many of them could make an important contri- 
bution to economic and social development in developing 
areas. 
Discussions in the Economic and Social Council and 
the U.N. General Assembly have frequently emphasized 
the importance of the savings to be derived from general 
disarmament. The basic position of the General Assembly 
on this matter in 1953 was defined in an unanimous reso- 
lution which declared: 
“We, the Governments of the States Members of the 
United Nations, in order to promote higher standards 
of living and conditions of economic and social progress 
and development, stand ready to ask our peoples, when 
sufficient progress has been made in internationally 
supervised world-wide disarmament, to devote a portion 
of the savings achieved through such disarmament to an 
international fund, within the framework of the United 
Nations, to assist development and reconstruction in 
underdeveloped countries.”

THE LAST FLOWER 
by James Thurber 
In 1939 just before the world was plunged into World War Il the American 
humorist, James Thurber, published “The Last Flower", a parable in pictures on 
the theme of war and peace. With the advent of the Atom Bomb and in the light 
of man’s present capacity to devastate the world, Thurber's work today—three 
years after his death—takes on even greater depth and meaning and points as 
never before to the need for disarmament. The book first published by Harper 
& Brothers, New York, was dedicated to “Rosemary, in the wistful hope that her 
world will be better than mine.”

### 62396: Arms cost the world USD120 thousand million per year

### 62336: Peaceful uses for military energy

PEACEFUL USES 
  
FOR 
    
MILITARY ENERGY 
by Ritchie Calder 
Professor of International Relations, 
University of Edinburgh 
] HE nations of the world are spending over 
£43,000 million ($120,000 million) on armaments 
per year, 
As the United Nations survey on “The Economic and 
Social Consequences of Disarmament” pointed out this is 
equivalent to about 8%, to 99% of the world's annual output 
of all goods and services and according to some estimates 
is equal to the entire national incomes of all the devel- 
oping countries put together. 
More significant however, is the fact that about 859%, of 
the world's military expenditure is accounted for by seven 
countries: Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, 
France, mainland China, the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, 
and the United States. On the other hand, the remaining 
15%, represents a disproportionate burden on the econo- 
mies of poorer countries. 
The U.K. Defence Budget has now, with the recent sup- 
plementary expenditure, passed the £ 2,000 million ($ 5,600 
million} mark. That represents over 79% of the gross 
national product. In terms of direct employment in Britain 
—the armed forces, the supply departments, industrial 
contracts and research—this represents about 1,118,000 
persons or 4,59, of the total working population. That is 
the number of people whose livelihoods would be affected 
by disarmament, “affected”, because it can be shown 
that it does not mean unemployment but, rather, a labour 
force made available for constructive, not destructive 
purposes. 
Nevertheless the threat to their livelihoods, not unreas- 
onably, colours the attitude of workers towards disarma- 
ment. If you put it crudely “Do you want armaments and 
employment, or disarmament and unemployment?” even 
the least militaristic would at least hesitate. This is the 
more true in these days when contract-work on defence 
expenditure is not always obvious as visible weapons. 
The worker who builds a Polaris submarine or bores 
the barrel of a gun may be aware of the arms he is making, 
but the man who is making parts for a computer may never 
think of it as the instrument which will launch a nuclear 
ballistic missile. He is not a conscious trigger-man, but 
he is probably aware that his firm has defence contracts, 
the cancelling of which might lose him his job. You cannot 
reproach these people as “war-mongers” because in the 
complexity, and the sinister ingenuity, of modern weapons 
few of us can remain entirely innocent. 
If | write an article on some new development in nuclear 
physics, | may put an idea into somebody's head as 
to how it might be adapted to missiles. The scientists 
involved in that highly admirable enterprise, the International 
Geophysical Year, in which a hundred nations took part 
for purely scientific reasons, did not foresee that artificial 
satellites, which to them were merely observation instru- 
ments, might be exploited as nuclear space-mines. 
The making of armaments which are obsolete as soon 
as, or even before, they are in production is, in the econo- 
mics of wastage, the equivalent of digging a hole and 
filling it up—with this difference, that the hole we dig is 
either our own grave or a refuse dump in which we bury 
the elaborate artifacts which consume our scarce natural 
resources and squander our human resourcefulness, 
“The Economic Effects of Disarmament” produced by the 
Economist Intelligence Unit, sponsored by the United 
World Trust, (1) is a survey of the effects of disarmament 
in terms of one country, Britain, and it confirms the findings 
of the United Nations experts that there need be no econo- 
mic or labour-force convulsions if the disengagement from 
arms is planned with an awareness of the industrial and 
man-power adjustments which have to be made. 
I general disarmament, the re-deployment of 
men and industrial plants is no more complex, 
indeed less so, than the running down of the fighting 
services and the munition industries at the end of the 
Second World War, 
[In June, 1945, after the collapse of Germany, there were 
5,100,000 persons in the British armed forces and approxi- 
mately 3,900,000 persons producing equipment and supplies, 
giving a total of nine million persons directly engaged in 
military effort. In October 1945, a target was set for the 
demobilization of one and a half million men and women 
from the forces by December 31 plus a simultaneous 
reduction of 1,400,000 in munitions and related industries. 
In the event, despite transport difficulties, the reduction 
of the armed forces was successfully carried out and so, 
for all practical purposes, was the reduction in the indus- 
trial field. The run-down was almost complete by the ‘end 
of 1946. Both in terms of output and re-employment the 
disarmament programme was carried out with the minimum 
of friction and dislocation. 
Behind this remarkable piece of redeployment was the

### 62336: Peaceful uses for military energy

PEACEFUL USES (Contd) 
The case of one country—Britain 
meeting of the International Labour Office at Philadelphia 
in April/May 1944. The liberation of Europe and the end 
of Hitler's war was still a year off. The 1.L.O., when the 
League of Nations collapsed, had moved to Montreal. It 
was still at that time an organ of the League of Nations 
and this war-time Conference re-dedicated the 1.L.O. to 
the constructive purposes of peace. Delegates, on the 
regular pattern of government, employer and worker, came 
from the allied nations then fighting the war. 
The Office had prepared careful studies on demobiliza- 
tion and the re-employment and the re-deployment of 
industry. Delegates, beset by the urgencies of war and, 
most of them, anxiously concerned about the sufferings of 
their people under enemy occupation were asked to give 
thought to the transfer from war to peace. 
The mood might have been “Let's win the war first!” but 
it was not. All of them could remember the disarray of 
the labour force after the First World War and the hardships 
of the years which followed. 
The 1.L.0.'s staff-studies dealt with the demobilization of 
the armed forces and the machinery necessary for direction 
and re-training; with the needs of young people, evacuated 
from their homes, even exiled from their countries, their 
schooling interrupted and, often, drafted into factories; 
with the women “doing their bit" in industry but likely to 
be displaced by ex-service men; with the disabled, civilian 
as well as military, and their rehabilitation; with the 
technological changes, already taking place in industry, 
to which the returning workers would have to be adapted, 
and with the complications which would follow the switch 
of plants from war to peace. 
Te recommendations approved by the Phila- 
delphia Conference, provided the basis for 
subsequent, and salutary, actions by governments, em- 
pioyers and trade unions. The measures agreed eased 
the processes of re-adjustment and contributed to the 
remarkably swift recovery of war-ravaged countries. 
One of the factors in Britain of the easy transition was 
the back-log of demand built up during the war years due 
to both the devastation and the lack of supplies. In fact 
Britain even now has not fully caught up with that back-log. 
Her machine tool industry for example has still not reco- 
vered from the effects of the war which prevented re- 
equipping. Forty-five per cent of the hospitals taken over 
by the National Health Service in 1948 were in poor condi- 
tion, and no new hospital was started until 1954, and 
between 1954 and 1958 the proportion of the national 
income alloted to hospital building was still only half of 
what was spent before the war. 
In the United States, the transition was equally easy 
because there was an enormous unsatisfied demand for 
consumer goods, and for everything the American economy 
could produce from food and fuel to automobiles and refrig- 
erators as well as every kind of machine tool and machi- 
nery. So the wartime U.S. boom continued, and reached 
new heights during the Korean War. Then in the words of 
a U.S. journal “Peace Broke Out” and there was a definite 
recession because by then the American home markets 
were saturated in terms of affluent requirements. 
The American economist, James P. Warburg, has said 
in his book. “Disarmament: The Challenge of the 1960's” 
that no unsatisfied demand for consumer goods like that 
of the post-war transition period now exists. Instead, he 
adds, the extension of automation has meant five and a 
half million workers displaced by the machines so that the 
reconversion of the nine per cent of the gross national 
product which is represented by U.S. military expenditure 
is going to produce difficulties—unless, and he terms it 
a self-evident “unless”, the United States goes out for 
public works and social services to provide for the under- 
privileged ten per cent of its population. More than that, 
as J.P. Warburg adds, it must go out into the wider world 
where the unsatisfied demand exists but the purchasing 
power is lacking. “The provision of that purchasing 
power” he writes, “and the gearing of the American eco- 
nomy to the world’s needs can be readjusted to meet it.” 
BY the U.S. has a problem apart from the 
conversion of industry. The military installa- 
tions themselves account for a government military and 
civilian payroll of $11,000,000,000 a year. This is equal 
to one-and-a-half times the combined payrolls of the iron 
steel industry and all the other basic metal industries. It 
is more than double the payroll of the automobile industry. 
By comparison, the position in Britain is relatively sim- 
ple. Britain has a smaller military force and the number 
of workers engaged on defence work is 750,000 in 138 
companies. Of the defence contracts, 27.6% are in the 
London and South-Eastern region and 7.7% in Scotland. 
Northern region accounts for 5%, East and West Ridings 
5%, North Midland 4.5%, Eastern 6.8%; Southern 7.7% 
South Western 6.3%; Wales 3.2%, Midlands 15%, North 
Western 10% and Northern lreland 2.3%. 
The British Industries directly affected are the aircraft 
industry, the electronics industry, shipbuilding and marine 
engineering, the motor industry, the electrical industry and 
of course, ordnance and small arms. The aircraft industry 
is the most exposed; 45% of its 300,000 workers are 
directly employed on defence contracts and it gets 
£ 100,000,000 ($ 280,000,000) from the Services for research. 
Some 40,000 men in the electronics industry (about 20% 
of the total labour forces) are on defence work. The motor 
industry is barely affected—a mere 29 of its 420,000 
workers. Shipbuilding and marine engineering with a 
labour force of 244,000 has about 81,000 workers on Service 
contracts. Mechanical engineering with 1,265,000 has only 
3%, involved and the electrical industry with 500,000 workers 
has only 4%. Ordnance and small arms would have a 
redundancy of about 23,000—assuming that general disarm- 
ament abolished everything including rifles. 
But these figures are deceptive to the extent that in 
practically every instance—with a major exception of the

PEACEFUL USES (Cont'd) 
What we need is the courage 
aircraft industry, largely involved in military type aircraft 
and in missiles—the work is interchangeable, civil and 
military. A worker in the electronic industry is not like an 
armourer. He has not spent all his life perfecting his skills 
for one particular weapon; his products are components 
capable of unlimited diversity. What the electronics indus- 
try needs is not massive reconversion but a continuation 
of orders for civil electronics—machines to bring British 
industries up-to-date. 
And the same would apply throughout the “demobilized” 
sectors of industry. Instead of making weapons which if 
they are ever used are catastrophic and, if they are never 
used, are sheer waste, industries would be making things 
which would multiply the components of prosperity. 
The word to emphasize is “components” because we 
have become hidebound in our thinking about the finished 
article. The liner Queen Elizabeth is not just a ship; it is 
a city wrapped up in a hull but the components of that 
city do not have to be encased in steel and slid down a 
slipway. In a country badly needing homes and hospital 
wards and classrooms, there is no reason why shipyards 
dependent on armed forces contracts should not turn over to 
the pre-fabrication of “living units” for assembly ashore. 
Then the reduction of naval construction would not be a 
threat to workers’ livelihoods. 
Ar when the contracts are committed and 
when it would cause great hardship to cancel 
them, then we should think of more imaginative uses for 
military or naval or air force surpluses. For instance, 
Britain is committed by contract to a fleet of Polaris 
nuclear-powered submarines each costing £ 70,000,000 
($ 200,000,000). A lot of money already appropriated and 
a lot of work already started. But they could be converted 
into a fleet of submarine tankers, or freighters, which could 
go under the polar ice and open up the frozen north of 
Canada. 
This is not a fanciful idea. Consider Hudson Bay. Look 
at that great bight on the map bulging into the heart of 
Canada—the shortest sea-route to the grain lands of the 
middle provinces and to the still undeveloped wealth of 
Atom Age minerals in Keewatin, the sub-arctic region of 
Eastern Canada, and to the iron deposits of Labrador. 
But Hudson Bay is inaccessible to ocean-going ships for 
nine months of the year. It would not be very difficult to 
maintain an ice-free port (like a seal's breathing-hole 
through the ice) where submarine freighters, or submarine 
tugs could surface any time. The Canadian authorities 
seriously considered having such a port but abandoned it 
because of the cost of providing a nuclear submarine fleet. 
But if Britain had such a fleet going abegging, it could do 
for the north of Canada what the transcontinental railways 
did for the Middle West in the 19th Century. Go North, 
young man! 
In the wider world we need components unlimited. 
Unesco has stated that in the struggle to help the illiterates 
of the world, we need a minimum of 400 million radio- 
receivers, cheap, foolproof, battery transistor-sets are 
needed. The hundreds of millions already invested in 
electronics for guided missiles could pay-off by provid- 
ing the components. We need hundreds of millions 
of tractors, which if they were made simple and durable 
enough (and not the sophisticated mobile power-units 
which advanced farming uses) could transform the agri- 
culture of the underdeveloped world. We need hundreds 
of millions of small motors—the sort of things that operate 
the flaps of bombers—which, as components, could be 
used in a thousand different ways, from winnowing machi- 
nes to village industries. We need hovercraft, pipelines, 
telecommunications, machine-tools, teaching machines and 
packaged nuclear power reactors. 
If nuclear materials were not locked up in military stock 
piles and if brains and skills were released from the com- 
pounds of military establishments, we might keep some of 
those promises of footloose energy which were made at 
the first Atoms for Peace Conference. 
As important as the money and resources which could 
be released are the imagination and skills which have 
been diverted to military purposes and could be redirected 
to all those opportunities which were arrayed in February 
1963 at the U.N. Conference on Science and Techneclogy 
for the Benefit of the Less Developed Areas held in Geneva. 
What we need is the courage to accept general disar- 
mament.

### 62329: Pugwash; a world movement on the responsibility of the scientist in world affairs

Letters to the Editor 
HOW TO HELP THE U.N. 
Sir, 
The Unesco Courier deserves the 
highest praise for the illuminating and 
challenging article, “The Flags Are 
Not Enough,” (June 1964). | hope 
that this article and others like it 
will awaken all nations and peoples 
to the necessity of making the United 
Nations Development Decade a 
success, 
The magnitude of the task before 
us staggers the imagination. Ten 
thousand people die every day in the 
world from hunger or malnutrition. 
Yet the problem of hunger, poverty, 
disease, illiteracy, and other forms of 
human misery can be solved. We 
have the technical ability and the 
resources to build what Paul G. Hoff- 
man called a “World Without Want”. 
Let us, therefore, bend our shoulders 
to the effort. If there is nothing else 
we can do, we can at least contribute 
to the United Nations Children's 
Fund. However, there is much more 
that we can do—especially if we hold 
positions of leadership in the de- 
veloped nations. People must be 
awakened, inertia must be overcome, 
minds and bodies must be put to 
work. Your article was magnificent. 
Now let us have more articles telling 
what the U.N. is doing to solve the 
problem and what individual citizens 
in all nations may do to help.

has already raised well over 81 million 
for literacy, technical training and health 
projects in developing countries. By 
supporting Unesco Gift Coupon profects 
linked with the FAO “Freedom from 
Hunger Campaign” and the UNRWA 
schools for Palestine refugees, for 
example, readers would be effectively 
helping the work of the U.N, family. 
For further information on this pro- 
gramme write to Unesco’s Public Liaison 
Division, Place de Fontenoy, Paris. 
Another way to help is by buying the 
Greeting Cards sold each year by the 
United Nations Children’s Fund. The 
proceeds help to save millions of chil- 
dren from hunger and disease. 
A NEW ALPHABET 
 
Sir, 
A useful addition to your Issue 
dealing with the Art of Writing (March 
1964) would have been something 
about the future and In particular the 
new developments in adjusting scripts 
to the spoken word. The best example 
of this is the Initial Teaching Alphabet 
now being used in Britain by some ten 
thousand children learning to read. 
The principle on which it is based 
could be applied to any language and 
if widely adopted would make Unesco's 
literacy campaigns much easier. How 
much easier it is hard to say because 
for some reason Unesco has estab- 
lished no measure to show how hard 
it is to learn to read in one language 
as compared with another, This 
should be an essential preliminary 
inquiry before a world campaign 
begins. 
A second virtue in the new alphabet 
is that it makes easier the learning of 
foreign languages. English Is an exas- 
perating language to learn because 
often letters are pronounced in diffe- 
rent ways whereas in the new alpha- 
bet they are always pronounced in the 
same way, and yet the two alphabets 
are so alike that it is easy to change 
from one to the other. 
A number of countries have already 
realized the significance of the new 
invention and the new alphabet is 
being used in a number of countrles 
such as in the U.S.S.R. at Irkutsk, In 
Israel, In Canada and elsewhere. It 
seems a great pity that Unesco 
appears to ignore it even In the tra- 
veiling exhibition "The Art of Writing”.

DETERGENTS & 
  
WATER POLLUTION 
  
Sir, 
| read the issue, “Water and Life", 
(July-August 1964) with great interest 
and particularly the article, “Can We 
Stop the Cancer of River Pollution?”, 
by René Colas. 
The problem of water pollution has 
long been a concern of the Interna- 
tional Union for Conservation of Na- 
ture and Natural Resources. Its Com- 
mission on Legislation has studied the 
juridical aspects of water pollution and 
has followed the evolution of legisla- 
tion relating to this problem. You 
may be Interested to know that a law 
on the use of detergents—the first 
of Its kind in the world—comes into 
force In the Federal Republic of Ger- 
many on October 1. This forbids the 
sale of detergents unless 809, of 
their content dissolves on contact with 
water, and this percentage may be 
still further increased In the future. A 
similar plan Is now being studied In 
the United States. 
It is to be hoped that measures of 
this kind will become general. 
Unesco Is particularly well placed to 
bring this new law to the attention of 
its member states.

PUGWASH (Cont'd from page 21) 
secretariat and Pugwash in the study of this important 
question. 
One of the highlights of the Pugwash meeting was the 
official announcement that the Swedish government had 
decided to establish an international peace research 
institute to mark Sweden's 150 years of unbroken peace. 
Three research projects have thus far been mentioned for 
possible study (a) the establishment of a modsrn seismo- 
graph system (the so-called seismic cross) in Swedish 
territory as an aid in detecting underground explosions of 
nuclear weapons; (b) studies of economic and social 
problems of disarmament (c) development of needed 
resources for a growing population. Other projects will 
certainly follow. 
Over a hundred persons from 19 countries attended the 
1964 Pugwash meetings including two Under-Secretaries 
of the United Nations, 1950 Nobel Peace Prize Winner 
Ralph Bunche and Vladimir P. Suslov As 1965 has 
been named United Nations International Co-operation 
Year it is expected that a large part of the 
Pugwash Conference which opens in Venice next April 
will be devoted to international co-operation in science and 
international co-operation to help the developing countries. 
As the Vienna Pugwash conference declared: 
“The extremely low level of living in the industrially 
underdeveloped countries of the world is and will remain 
a source of international tension. We see an urgent need 
to forward studies and programmes for the effective 
industrialization of these countries. This would not only 
improve the level of living of the majority of the population 
of the world; it would also help reduce the sources of 
conflict between the highly-industrialized powers. Such 
studies would offer fruitful scope for co-operative efforts 
between scientists of all nations.”

From the Unesco News 
ALINGA FILM PRIZE. “Shopje 63," a 
film based on the earthquake that 
destroyed the capital of Macedonia last 
year, has won for the Yugoslav film direc- 
tor, Veljko Bulajic, the Kalinga Film Prize 
for 1964. The award Is made to the film 
judged to have done most to bring home a 
major achievement in the realm of interna- 
tional co-operation. It Is awarded by the 
Director-General of Unesco with the help 
of an International jury and is financed by 
an Indian Industrialist, Mr. Bijoyanand Pat- 
nalk, director of the Kalinga Foundation. 
Two other films were singled out for honour- 
able mention: "L'Art Négre” (France} and 
"A New Reality” (Denmark).

A padlock enclosing the mushroom

on the most recent U.N, commemo- 
rative stamp marking the first 
anniversary of the entry into force 
of the Nuclear Test Ban treaty on 
October 10, 1963, The U.N. Postal 
Administration Is distributing this 
stamp accompanied by the following 
text : “The use of nuclear and 
thermonuclear weapons is contrary to 
the spirit, letter and aims of the 
United Nations and would cause 
indiscriminate suffering and destruction 
to mankind and civilization. It Is a 
war directed not only against an 
enemy or enemies, but also against 
mankind in general. Any State using 
nuclear or thermo-nuclear weapons is 
to be considered as violating the 
Charter of the United Nations, as 
acting contrary to the laws of 
humanity, and as committing a crime 
against mankind and clvilization®. As 
agent in France of the U.N. Postal 
Administration, Unesco’'s Philatelic 
Service stocks all U.N. stamps and 
first day covers currently on sale. For 
prices and further details write to

for industrial use at a solar power station 
overlooking the port of Marseilles. This is 
done by a furnace composed of numerous 
“cells” made of refractory materials which 
transform light reflected from a 600 sq. ft. 
surface of mirrors into heat. 
TONE AGE QUEST: An archaeologist 
from the Lebanon, Dr Dimitri Haramki, 
has been sent to Libya by Unesco to help 
organize exploration of sites which may 
ultimately prove to be one of the world's 
richest and so far largely untapped sources 
of knowledge about the stone age and . 
prehistoric times. Dr. Haramki will advise 
the Department of Antiquity in Tripoli on 
planning survey and excavation programmes 
in the hinterland of Libya. 
OR THIRSTY DESERTS: The first section 
of one of Central Asia's largest irriga- 
tion systems, the Kafirnigan Project, is now 
In operation. When completed at the end 
of the year it will bring water from the 
Kafirnigan River to almost 250,000 acres of 
arid pastures in Southern Tajikistan. A 
pumping station will raise river waters over 
one third of a mile to reach the irrigation 
canals. The U.S.S.R. has now over 23 mil- 
lion acres of irrigated land. 
[HIGHWAY HOLIDAY: Twenty thousand 
young Yugoslavs have spent part of 
their holiday this year working alongside 
several hundred young people from abroad 
on the construction of the Adriatic highway. 
The road, started several years ago, will 
eventually link the two seaports of Rijeka 
and Bar. The highway is due to open to 
traffic on May 1, 1965. 
OING DOWN: Work has now started 
on the hole which the Soviet Union 
is hoping to drill to a depth of six miles 
through the earth's crust as part of the 
Upper Mantle Project (See The Unesco 
Courier, October 1963). The Soviet drilling 
site is in the Caspian Depression about 
180 miles from the oil town of Guriev. 
As a complementary project in the interna- 
tional plan to probe for new knowledge 
about the earth's crust and upper mantle, 
U.S. scientists plan to drill a hole into the 
ocean bed. Test drillings have already 
been made off the Californian coast. 
IGHT AGAINST ILLITERACY: The sec- 
ond Unesco regional conference on 
the planning and organization of literacy pro- 
grammes recently brought together heads 
of adult education and literacy services of 
all Arab member states, associate members 
and territories, in Alexandria, U.A.R. The 
conference discussed how to step up the 
fight against illiteracy throughout the Arab 
world, and in particular the integration of 
literacy programmes in national economic 
and social development plans. The first 
Unesco regional conference on literacy 
took place at Abidjan, Ivory Coast, in 
February, to consider problems of African 
countries. 
ROSPECTION FROM THE AIR: Scien- 
tist and specialists in aerial photo- 
graphy met recently in Toulouse, France, to 
  
discuss how their respective knowledge and 
techniques can best be combined in aerial 
surveys that would specially help develop- 
ing countries in locating and evaluating 
their natural resources. Among the bran- 
ches of science represented at the confe- 
rence, which was organized jointly by 
Unesco and the French National Centre 
for Scientific Research, were geology, geo- 
morphology, soil science, botany and hydro- 
logy. 
EST TEXTBOOK PRIZES: Annual prizes 
are to be awarded by Unesco to 
authors of outstanding textbooks, in accor- 
dance with the provisions of a bequest 
made to Unesco by the late Mr. Nessim 
Habif in 1960. The aim of the awards is 
“to encourage the production in developing 
countries of good textbooks which are 
objective, balanced, up-to-date and peda- 
gogically sound.” The first award will be 
made next year for textbooks published 
in Asian countries, and in successive years 
will cover Unesco member states in Africa, 
the Arab world and Latin America. 
R ocK PAINTING FIND: Rock paintings 
sand engravings described as the most 
spectacular single example of aboriginal 
art of this kind in Australia have been 
found in a cave on Cape York peninsula. 
They completely cover a vertical rock face 
twelve feet high and seventy-five feet long 
and depict vegetation, animals and human 
figures.

Bm A plan to increase nearly fifteenfold the 
number of scientists in Africa (from around 
5,000 to between 50,000 and 70,000) 
during the next 15 years has been approved 
by a conference of 29 African nations 
convened in Lagos, Nigeria, by Unesco and 
UN. Economic Commission for Africa. 
BW Weather bureau warnings of storms, 
floods and bushfires save Australia about 
£A250 million a year. The annual cost of 
running the bureau is less than £A4 1/4 mil- 
lion. 
HW Nine agreements recently signed between 
. the World Health Organization and its 
member states in the Eastern Mediterranean 
aim to eradicate malaria by expanding the 
mass campaign that has already given 
protection to over 45 miflion people in this 
region. 
BW During the past three years some small 
farmers in the north of Latin America have 
increased their incomes as much as 20 times 
through the use of fertilizers combined with 
other better farming practices, reports the 
Food and Agriculture Organization. 
HW Seventeen member states or associate 
members of Unesco in Africa have set up 
television services or plan to do so before 
the year's end, it was reported at a recent 
Unesco meeting on television development 
in Africa, held at Lagos, Nigeria. 
HW Diseases of the heart and blood vessels 
cause nearly one half of all deaths in 
22 countries, most of them highly industrializ- 
ed, covered by a World Health Organization 
survey. 
Bm Professor A.N. Matveyev, formerly pro- 
fessor or theoretical physics at Moscow
