In rural black Africa, the palaver is the time-honoured institution whereby communities or ethnic groups confer and 
exchange views. While palavers are conducted according to strict rules (age confers precedence, interrupting a speaker 
is forbidden) it is taken for granted that the participants will express themselves freely and frankly. Characteristic of 
a civilization in which the spoken word is all-powerful, this method of using the power of words to settle disputes or 
take the heat out of quarrels also gives force to the conscience of the community expressed in a fully democratic spirit.

Ctl triad 
N preparing this issue of the Unesco 
I Courier, entirely devoted to Chinese 
culture, the editors could not pre- 
tend to encompass within the limited 
number of pages at their disposal, still less 
to analyse, one of the world’s oldest 
civilizations and one of humanity's richest 
cultures. There was no question of tracing 
the path traversed by a society whose 
origins may perhaps be said to go back to 
Beijing Man half a million years ago, nor 
of following the development of the arts 
and sciences, which count among their 
earliest inventions the compass and the 
seismograph, paper manufacturing and 
printing, the solar quadrant and gun- 
powder, and among their discoveries that 
of the relationship between the cir- 
cumference and the diameter of a circle, as 
well as many other brilliant achievements. 
As far as the ancient history of China is 
concerned, we evoke in our pages only 
China’s cultural contacts and relations 
with the West which always began along 
the trade-routes, in this case the Silk Road 
and the current which bore westward the 
arts of Chinese ceramicists. On our central 
colour pages we also present some of the 
great landmarks of Chinese art from 
prehistoric times until the fifteenth cen-   
tury,’ as well as scenes from everyday life in 
China today. 
It was decided to focus the articles on 
contemporary China, born of the great 
transformations which came about in the 
middle of this century after several event- 
Sul decades of struggle. These economic, 
political and social changes have affected 
every aspect of Chinese society: the tradi- 
tional family structure; the interpretation 
of history and what was considered to be 
the country’s philosophy; the conception 
of artistic creation and scientific progress. 
If New China still counts a rural popula- 
tion which constitutes 80 per cent of the 
total, it is on this immense source of 
human vitality, and on the manual and in- 
tellectual workers of the towns and cities, 
that the country is basing its efforts to con- 
struct an original economy which will 
enable it to go forward successfully with 
bold scientific and technological pro- 
grammes for education and development, 
many of which constitute an example for 
other regions of the Third World. 
The historical conditions which deter- 
mined these fundamental and definitive 
changes in the organization of society and 
in the culture which derives from it, appear 
in our pages through the testimony of three 
of modern China’s most famous writers: 
Lu Xun, Ba Jin and Ding Ling, who were 
eyewitnesses of and to a degree pro- 
tagonists in, a period of history whose 
course they helped to change. 
This radical transformation of society 
was possible because the Chinese people, 
scorned and oppressed during centuries of 
Seudalism, were for the first time in history 
taken into consideration. Some of the 
oldest and most deeply rooted traditions 
of the Chinese people, such as the martial 
arts and acupuncture, have thus been 
respected and encouraged and are today 
not only practised in China but have won 
adherents in other Asian countries as well 
as in Europe and the Americas. Other 
time-honoured forms of expression 
discussed in this issue include ceramics and 
calligraphy, an art which holds a special 
place in China and for whose uniquely 
close relationship to poetry and painting it 
is difficult to find a parallel elsewhere. 
Finally we should like to point out to our 
readers that wherever possible we have 
Sollowed the Chinese Pinyin transcription 
of proper names.

Ba Jin at his Shanghai home in 1982, aged 77. 
and yet I don’t consider myself 
a man of letters. People come 
to literature by different ways. I was 
fond of reading novels when I was still 
aboy, and would sometimes even forget 
toeat or sleep. I did not read for the sake 
of study but out of enjoyment. I never 
dreamt that I would be a novelist 
myself. I beganto write novels simply in 
order to make sense of things. 
I was born into a large bureaucrat- 
landlord family in Chengdu, the capital 
of Sichuan province, and passed my 
childhood among twenty or thirty ‘‘up- 
per class’’ people and the same number 
of “‘lower-class’’ people. In this well- 
off family, I learned about the wretched 
lives of servants and sedan bearers. I 
heard the complaints of the young 
generation, tyrannized by the

BA JIN, born 1904, is a celebrated modern 
Chinese novelist. He is currently Vice-

and Art Circles, Chairman of the Chinese

PEN Centre. His major works include: Trilogy

hypocritical, selfish older members of 
the family. I felt that something was 
wrong with our society, but I could not 
work out what was wrong, nor did I 
know how the sickness could be cured. 
When I left home at the age of nine- 
teen, I felt as if I had escaped from a 
dreadful nightmare. At twenty-three I 
left Shanghai for a strange land—Paris, 
hoping to find a way to save humanity, 
to save the world and myself. 
In the spring of 1927 I took a small 
room reeking with the smell of gas and 
onions on the fourth floor of a small 
apartment building in the Rue 
Tournefort, in the Latin Quarter. I was 
lonely and miserable. In that small 
room, which was rarely visited by the 
sun, I missed my homeland, my 
relatives and friends. A struggle bet- 
ween revolution and counter-revolution 
was going on in my country, and the 
people were suffering. : 
In Paris there was a campaign to save 
two Italian workers, Sacco and Vanzet- 
t1, who had been charged with murder 
and held in prison in Boston, 
Massachusetts, for six years. Posters of 
protest and notices of meetings were 
everywhere in the streets. I read the

autobiography of Vanzetti and came 
upon such lines as, ‘‘I hopeevery family 
has its house, every mouth has bread, 
everybody gets an education and 
everyone is given the chance to develop 
his gifts.’ I was greatly moved. How 
well he had expressed it! Like a key, his 
-words opened the lock of my heart. 
I lived near the Pantheon and passed 
it every day. As dusk was falling one 
rainy afternoon I stopped in front of the 
bronze statue of Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau and confided my frustration 
and misery to this ‘citizen of Geneva’’ 
who had dreamed of putting an end to 
tyranny and inequality. Back in my 
cold, lonely room I sat down to write a 
letter in which I asked advice from the 
prisoner in the condemned cell. In the 
reply which eventually reached me 
Vanzetti wrote, ‘“Youth is the hope of 
the world.”’ Several months later he was 
executed in the electric chatr. Fifty years 
later Sacco and Vanzetti were 
pardoned. 
It was in such circumstances and in 
such a mood that I wrote the outlines of 
episodes for a novel, while the bells of 
Notre-Dame tolled out the passing 
hours. I would turn my misery, 
loneliness and enthusiasm into lines of 
characters on paper. My past loves and 
hates, my joys, sorrows, sympathy and 
suffering all rushed to my pen. I wrote 
quickly. The flame burning in my heart 
began to die down and I could close my 
eyes in peace. The problem preying on 
my mind was solved. I was saved. 
After that, whenever I had time I 
would pick up my pen and pour out my 
feelings on paper so that my young, 
lonely heart could find consolation. The 
following year I completed my first 
novel and posted it from the little 
French town of Chéiteau-Thierry to a 
friend of mine who worked at the Kai- 
ming publishing house in Shanghai. I 
wanted his opinion of my work which I 
wanted to have printed. When I return- 
ed to Shanghai at the end of that year, 
I'learned from my friend that my novel

would be serialized in the magazine Fic- 
tion Monthly. He also told me that Ye 
Shengtao, the magazine’s acting editor- 
in-chief, had read it and decided to 
publish it. } 
At that time Fiction Monthly had 
great prestige. It opened the door to me 
and let me, a young man ignorant of 
literature, enter the arena of literature 
in triumph. 
I learned to write fiction in France. I 
shan’t forget my teachers: Rousseau, 
Hugo, Zola and Romain Rolland. 1 
learned to integrate writing and life, the 
author and his characters. I believe that 
the highest achievement of a writer lies 
in this fusion through which he devotes 
himself to his readers. My novels are the 
result of my exploration of life. Each 
work is my harvest. It is for my readers 
to judge them. I myself adhere to one 
unchanging principle: "always tell the 
truth, 
Apart from French writers 1 also 
learned from Russian authors such as 
Herzen, Turgenev’s novels Fathers and 
Sons and Virgin Soil, and Gorky’s early 
short stories. I am currently translating 
Herzen’s memoirs. Among those who 
have taught me is Charles Dickens and 
the Japanese writers Natsume-Soseki 
and Arishima Takeo. Lu Xun is my 
Chinese master. My works have been in- 
fluenced to a greater or lesser degree by 
these writers. However, my principal 
teacher has been life, life in Chinese 
society. My feelings and experiences 
enabled me to be a writer. 
Readers may detect the influence of 
different writers in my work, but I did 
not deliberately set out to learn from 
any particular writer. ‘I must fight 
against the old society,” I once said, 
“and I need weapons. I would take up 
any weapon to fight against the old 
order.” } 
In 1928 I returned from France and 
settled down in Shanghai. I began by 
  
writing a short story and translated 
some short pieces which I sent to 
newspapers and magazines. Later the 
editors asked for more. I stayed in the 
same building as my friend who worked 
at the Kaiming publishing house; he 
lived upstairs while I lived downstairs. I 
was shy of meeting people and speaking 
in public, and I didn’t want to have 
anything to do with outsiders. So those 
who wanted my writings always dealt 
with my friend, and I could write in 
peace. Sometimes I would work 
through the night to write a short story, 
leaving the manuscript on the desk for 
my friend to pick up the next morning. 
This was how I wrote The Dog, a short 
story which was published in Fiction 
Monthly. The more works I published, 
the more people came to me for my 
writings. Gradually I got to know more 
and more people in the literary world. 
In 1933 I noted that “‘I live on friend- 
ship, that’s why I’m still alive.” 
In July 1982, the People’s Republic of 
China carried out the most massive 
census operation in history. The full 
results will not be known in detail until 
1984, but overall totals were issued in 
October 1982. They show that China's 
population at the time of the survey 
stood at 1,008,175,288. The urban 
population numbered 206,588,000, 
while over 800 million persons {about 
80 per cent of the total) live in rural far- 
ming areas. Left, his silhouette gleam-

» During the first few years of this new 
life IT usually devoted eight or nine 
months annually to writing and travel- 
led to see my friends during the rest of 
the year. I lived on my royalties alone. 
Because of my writing I did not marry 
until I was forty. Until then my friends’ 
homes were my home; I travelled widely 
to see my friends. I kept ‘‘travel notes’’. 
Sometimes I shut myself up in my study 
for a year at a time in order to write. I 
once described myself in these words: 
“Day and night an inner fire consumed 
me. My hands trembled as I con- 
templated the suffering of many people, 
including my own. I wrote constantly, 
always in the same humdrum surroun- 
dings: a bare room with the sunlight 
slanting in through the window; piles of 
books and newspapers and writing 
paper on the square table in front of me; 
a worn-out armchair and two small 
stools.”” The war reached Shanghai in 
1932 and I had to move. However, I 
didn’t change my way of life nor did I 
stop writing. 
In 1934 I visited Japan where I stayed 
for a few months in Yokohama and 
then spent several months in Tokyo. In 
August of the following year some of 
my friends in Shanghai founded the 
Cultural Life Publishing House and in- 
vited me to do some editing work. I ac- 
cepted their offer and edited several 
series of books. In the next twenty 
years, I spent part of my time editing 
literary works and translating, and 
naturally there was less time for writing. 
But the enthusiasm of my youth did not 
wane, and my pen did not allow me to 
rest. 
In 1937, when the war of resistance 
against Japan broke out, I left Shanghai 
for the south. I returned and then 
travelled to the southwest. My way of 
life was changing, but I did not stop 
writing. It was in these circumstances 
that I finished writing the trilogy 
entitled The Torrent. 1 had scarcely 
made a simple home for myself in a city 
before I was forced to leave, empty- 
handed except for some paper. In those 
wandering days I had to change my 
writing habits. In some places it was 
even difficult to buy a bottle of ink! 
When 1 was writing The Garden of 
Repose, 1 always had an ink-stick, a

When the Chinese people were 
liberated and the People’s Republic of 
China was founded, I wanted to use my 
pen, which had been used to writing 
about darkness and misery, to write 
about new people and new deeds, to 
celebrate the people’s victory and joy. 
But I had not had the time to familiarize p

» myself with these subjects. I also took 
part in non-literary activities and 
therefore at this period I wrote little. 
In 1952 I went to Korea to see the 
Chinese volunteers and stayed among 
them for some time. This was the first 
time that I had met ordinary soldiers 
and lived with them. I was somewhat 
anxious: a man who had shut himself up 
in his study for so long and who had 
landed up in a great family of revolu- 
tionary soldiers would surely be a target 
of criticism. Not a bit of it! The soldiers 
did not treat me as an outsider and 
welcomed me as if I were one of them. 
I had come from the homeland, and 
they were extremely kind to me. Feel- 
ings like love and hatred are more 
manifest in places where war is raging. 
I became attached to these people and 
their surroundings and became their 
friend. I no longer thought about my 
writing. 
I often travelled abroad. I published 
a number of articles and essays in praise 
of friendship between peoples. I made 
new friends and envisioned the shining 
future of cultural exchanges between 
different nations. I wrote widely in 
praise of our new society and our new 
life. These writings were used as 
evidence of my ‘‘crime’’ and were con- 
demned as ‘‘poisonous weeds’’ during 
the ten years of the ‘‘Great Cultural 
Revolution’. I myself was illegally de- 
tained and suffered from all kinds of 
mental torture and humiliation. During 
these ten years I was deprived of all my 
civic rights and denied the freedom to 
publish. I began translating Herzen’s 
memoirs, a project I had had in mind 
for some forty years. 
Each day I translated several hundred 
words. As I worked, I felt as if I were 
walking through the darkness with 
Herzen. As he cursed the dictatorship of 
Tsar Nicholas I, I cursed the fascist rule 
exercised by the ‘gang of four’’. I firm- 
ly believed that their days were 
numbered. I survived to witness their 
fall. I was liberated a second time, and 
once again I picked up my pen. 
Excited and elated, I felt that a vast 
new horizon stretched before me. I 
wanted to write. There was so much I 
wanted to say. But I don’t have many 
years left, I can’t afford to waste a 
second. I’ve set myself a five-year plan. 
I intend to write two novels, a book en- 
titled Reminiscences of Literary Crea- 
tion, five volumes of ‘Random 
Thoughts’’, and to complete my 
translation of Herzen’s memoirs. Of 
these thirteen books, four have already 
been published, including the first 
volume of Herzen’s memoirs. The 
second, entitled True Words, is being 
printed. I shall do all I can to complete 
the other eight works. I must steer clear 
of anything that may sidetrack me, and 
save every minute for my writing. Some 
8 
people regard me as a ‘“personality’’ 
and arrange all kinds of social activities 
for me. Others want to interview me and 
note down whatever I say, hoping to get 
some historic testimony before it is too 
late. But all I want to dois to write until 
[ die. I want to write novels, not 
necessarily true stories. But I must sum 
up what I experienced during the ten 
years of the ‘‘Cultural Revolution’. 
Those ten unforgettable years con- 
stitute an important episode in the 
history of humanity. Few writers in the 
world experienced such dreadful, 
ridiculous, strange, painful events. We 
were all involved, we all played a part, 
and today when we look back at what 
we did during those years we find our - 
behaviour ridiculous—but it didn’t 
seem like that at the time. I often say to 
myself that if I don’t sum up those ten 
hard years and analyse myself sincerely,

[ may one day again regard cruelty, 
savagery, and stupidity as part of the 
normal order of things. The mental debt 
can never be paid. I have decided to 
write these two novels first to pay off 
this debt and secondly to end my fifty 
years of literary life, 
I have never thought about writing 
technique or ways of expression when 
writing my stories. What I care about is 
how to help people lead a better life, a 
worthy life, and how to help my readers 
contribute to society and to the people. 
All my writings have this aim. 
In 1935, two years after the publica- 
tion of my novel The Family, I said: ‘1 
have never ceased to attack my enemies 
ever since I picked up my pen to write. 
But who are my enemies? All the old 
feudal codes, all the irrational systems 
that hamper social progress and human 
fulfilment, all the forces that destroy 
 
China's great rivers, supplemented hy a canal net- 
work begun as early as the 5th century BC, are 
vast arteries of communication and transport, pro- 
vide precious irrigation water and, harnessed to 
produce electric power, are an increasingly impor- 
tant renewable energy source. But in many parts 
of the country they also pose the threat of serious 
flooding. The dramatic photo at right shows a 
rescue team helping stricken villagers to safety 
through the foaming waters of the Changjiang 
(Yangtse} during a flood which in 1981, 
devastated parts of Sichuan province. The

love. I’ve never budged from this posi- 
tion and never compromised.’’ 
When I met a group of Sinologists in 
Paris in September 1981 someone asked 
how I had survived the ‘‘cultural revolu- 
tion’’. Their sincere desire to under- 
stand something which seemed quite 
ordinary to us set my mind working. 
Those ten dreadful years had taught me 
something. At last I came to realize 
what I have learned from those long 
years of disaster.

Gradually things became clearer in 
my mind. It must be love, fire, hope, 
something positive. Many people had 
survived because they had these 
qualities. But many had been destroyed 
and left to us their love, fire and hope to 
be transmitted to posterity. No, I shall 
never lay down my pen.

### 51775: Controversial Confucius; in China today, the ancient philosopher's works are a source of lively debate

Controversial 
Confucius 
In China today, the ancient 
philosopher’s works 
are a source of lively debate 
by Pang Pu 
Confucius (c. 551-c. 479 BC) is considered to be the 
father of Chinese philosophy. He liked to say that he was 
a direct descendant of the Song rulers of China, which in 
his time was enmeshed in social and political strife. The 
empire was divided into a large number of States govern- 
ed by nobles whose pastime was war and who oppressed 
and exploited their subjects. Like Plato in later times, Con- 
fucius believed that he could preach to tyrants a certain 
form of virtue, and travelled from court to court in an at- 
tempt toinstilinlocal rulers his precepts of political morali- 
ty. His efforts met with little success, but after his death 
his more lowly-born disciples, the most important of 
whom was Mencius (Meng zi), set down his doctrines in 
the Four Books and the Five Classics, and some of them 
obtained prominent government positions. Gradually, a 
body of high officials, the mandarinate, came into being, 
notably during the Han dynasty and the Tang period. 
These functionaries were recruited by competition in the 
schools where the teaching was based on Confucian 
texts, and found in the philosopher's work their perfect 
ideological expression: the concept of the State which 
they served allowed the political élite which they formed 
to perpetuate itself. Although the privileges of the man- 
darins were based on learning, not hereditary right, the 
Confucianism of the mandarinate bore the imprint of tradi- 
tionalism and conservatism. Its scholastic nature was an 
obstacle to any reinvigoration of Chinese life, especially 
during the nineteenth century. Consequently, Confucius 
and his teachings were at first totally rejected in socialist 
China. In recent years, however, deeper historical 
analysis has set Confucius more firmly in his time and in- 
troduced different shades of emphasis into judgments 
about him and his work. The article by Pang Pu on this 
page outlines the main points at issue.

The Master said, “When there is a preponderance of 
native substance over acquired refinement, the result 
will be churlishness. When there is a preponderance of 
acquired refinement over native substance, the result 
will be pedantry. Only a well-balanced admixture of 
these two will result in gentlemanliness.,”’ 
The Master said : ‘That a man lives is because he is 
straight. That a man who dupes others survives is 
because he has been fortunate enough to be spared.” 
00 
The Master said, ‘‘I never enlighten anyone who has not 
been driven to distraction by trying to understand a dif- 
ficulty or who has not got into a frenzy trying to put his 
ideas into words. When I have pointed out one corner 
of a square to anyone and he does not come back with 
the other three, I will not point it out to him a second 
time.”’ 
Book 7 
There is little to choose between overshooting the mark 
and falling short. 
Book 11 
The Master said, ‘‘To fail to speak to a man who is 
capable of benefiting is to let a man go to waste. To 
speak to a man who is incapable of benefiting is to let 
one’s words go to waste.”’

value of his teachings have been the centre of 
vigorous controversy in China for several decades. 
The philosopher lived towards the end of the so-called 
Spring and Autumn period (722-480 BC) which was marked 
by violent social upheavals. Some historians maintain that 
this was the time when Chinese society based on slave- 
ownership was transformed into a feudal society. If this was 
so, then Confucius may have represented the interests of the 
emerged landowner class in opposition to the entrenched 
slaveholding class. His political role would in this case have 
been positive and progressive. 
However, many historians consider that this radical change 
in Chinese society occurred somewhat later, during the Warr- 
ing States period (480-221 BC). In their opinion, Confucius 
represented the interests of the declining slaveholding class 
and consequently his political position was reactionary. As he 
travelled from State to State, his principal objective was to 
restore the old order based on slavery. 
According to yet another school of thought, these pro- 
found social changes had taken place during the Western 
Zhou dynasty, which ruled from the eleventh century to 
722 BC. For those who hold this view, Confucius champion- 
ed the interests of the lower and middle strata of the 
aristocracy and of the budding caste of high officials. What 
Confucius wished to restore was not an order based on slavery 
but the unity of an empire which, at the beginning of the Zhou 
dynasty had broken up into powerful vassal States. The 
unification advocated by Confucius would have speeded up 
social development, so the argument runs. 
Lastly, some Chinese historians believe that the feudal era 
began at a much later date, during the period of the Wei 
kingdom and the Jin dynasty (from 220 to 420 AD). Their 
thesis is that until the time when the Wei, one of the States of 
the Three Kingdoms, replaced the Han dynasty, productive

Scene from the life of Confucius and his disciples as depicted in an early 19th-century Chinese painting. 
work throughout China was largely carried out by slaves. The 
age of Confucius was simply a transitional period; the old 
slaveholding system still existed, but productive work was 
beginning to be done by people reduced to slavery by debt. 
Seen in this light, Confucius should not be accused of seeking 
to restore the institution of slavery for the simple reason that 
slavery still existed. In spite of the conservative caste of his 
thinking, Confucius was thus not an out-and-out reactionary. 
Confucius’ political thinking was built on the two concepts 
of ren and /i. Although opinions differ on the subject, ren 
(which literally means ‘‘benevolence’’ or ‘‘humanity’’) is 
generally taken to denote the principles by virtue of which 
people can live in society or love each other mutually. 
Some scholars argue that ren was meant to impose rules of 
conduct on slave-owners threatened by frequent revolts by 
their slaves. In this way Confucius was seeking to attenuate 
the contradictions between the dominators and the 
dominated, as well as those which arose within theruling class 
itself, therebyserving incidentally the interests of the oppress- 
ed. And since, according to the same scholars, no previous 
theory had taken account of humanity in its entirety, the 
teachings of Confucius should be considered as revolutionary 
and the man himself as the greatest thinker of his age. 
Other historians reject this thesis, maintaining that Con- 
fucius did not intend that slaves and other labourers should 
- be treated with ‘‘benevolence’ and that Confucius was in no 
way progressive. 
Most specialists seem to adopt a position somewhere bet- 
ween these two extremes. If they stress that Confucius’ theory 
was fallacious and that it strengthened the hand of the ex- 
ploiting class, they also admit that it took account, in an un- 
precedented way, of the common people. 
For Confucius, /i (which may be translated literally as 
“ritual’’, ‘‘ceremony’’ or ‘‘rules of propriety and 
politeness’’) was the keystone of the established order but 
also designated standards of individual conduct. Some 
believe that some of Confucius’ teachings on the subject of /i 
were useful not only for his own time but also for later genera- 
tions, and that /i was thus in a sense positive. Others consider, 
however, that since they were intended to shore up the mori- 
bund slaveholding system, the tenets of conduct laid down by 
Confucius were fundamentally bad. 
It is more generally believed, however, that although Con- 
fucius felt nostalgia for a bygone age, and especially for the 
heyday of the Western Zhou, he succeeded in tailoring his 
philosophy to the new relationships between human beings 
which had become established in the society of his time. 
Confucius preached ‘the mandate of heaven’’, was oppos- 
ed to reform of any kind, and respected spirits and divinities. 
His thought is sometimes seen as no more than a corpus of 
idealistic metaphysics. On the other hand, it is pointed out 
that in Confucianism ‘‘heaven’’ is identified with nature, that 
the philosopher himself was extremely sceptical about the ex- 
istence of spirits and the soul and that such thinking was ex- 
tremely audacious in comparison with that of his contem- 
poraries. He attached great importance to moral principles 
and to individual initiative; he formulated rational ideas 
which enriched the theory of knowledge; he was 
convinced that history is a continuous, ongoing process. To 
qualify his thinking as ‘“metaphysical’’ is to compress its 
meaning to an exaggerated degree. 
Most scholars recognize Confucius’ importance as an 
educator. While some historians claim that private schools 
for the lower orders existed before his time, the majority ac- 
cord him the distinction of being the first teacher to dispense 
learning outside the official schools attached to the court. In 
so doing, he took culture and education outside the 
aristotratic circle of which they had hitherto been the 
monopoly. 
Where pedagogical theory was concerned, Confucius was 
ahead of his time. He advocated an education accessible to 
all, irrespective of social origins. His approach took account 
of the different aptitudes of each pupil and foreshadowed the 
Socratic method of bringing out ideas latent in the mind. l

confined within the boundaries which usually separate 
these arts. Whatever the specific characteristics of 
each may be, all three are inspired and determined by the 
nature of ideographic expression; all three aspire to grasp 
with the same instrument, the brush, the profound nature of 
existence, the ‘‘breath of inspiration’’ that quickens every 
form and gives it its special rhythm; all three are the arts of 
the brush-stroke. In the words of Han Yu, a great writer 
who lived during the Tang dynasty. ‘It matters little 
whether a speech be short or long... if the ‘breath’ be 
powerful’. 
This notion of the ‘‘primordial breath’ (the gi) is central. 
The aim of Chinese aesthetics is to achieve the living essence 
of the quickening breath, of rhythm, of life: art and the art 
of living are one and the same. The brush-stroke, whether 
in a painting or a poem, whether it transcribes the branch

this common effort to evoke the essential which is 
characteristic of calligraphy, poetry and painting. 
But painting alone englobes the other modes of expres- 
sion. The unity between painting and poetry appears early 
in Chinese history. In a scroll painting attributed to Gu 
Kaizhi (late fourth century AD), Admonitions of the In- 
Structress to the Court Ladies, the elegantly calligraphed 
text of a moralist may already be read. 
During the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th century), the period 
which marks the real beginning of scroll painting, painters 
were inspired by the works of the great poets Du Fu and Li 
Bai (8th century), and poets were closely interested in pic- 
torial creation. In a judgment which underscores the con- 
cern of the Chinese poet and painter to render life in all its 
profundity, Du Fu explains why the renowned horse-painter 
Han Gan is inferior to his master Cao Ba: 
To paint his horses Han Gan has depicted the flesh but 
not the skeleton 
That is why his chargers have no stamina. 
Already we find those who were both painters and poets.

Mountains 
and water 
In Chinese, landscape painting is called 
‘Mountain and Water’’ painting. For 
the Chinese, mountains and water are 
the two poles of nature and also, by a 
typically Chinese assimilation, of 
human sensibility. In the words of Con- 
fucius: “The mountain enchants the 
man of heart; water rejoices the man of 
spirit.” Painting landscapes is thus a 
way of painting man, not his physical 
attributes, but his inner being, his 
torments, his dreams. Traditional 
Chinese painting employed water col- 
ours and inks, and the water-holder, 
above, which contained the water used 
to moisten the artist's ink-sticks, is 
itself in the form of a drop of water. The 
““painting’’, left, is in fact a highly 
polished piece of marble whose natural 
veining forms a mountain landscape, to 
which a calligraph has been added. The 
calligraph, below left, of the Chinese 
ideogram for the word shan, or moun- 
tain, is echoed in the bronze ritual ob- 
ject (4th century BC), bottom right. The 
theme of the mountain is still omnipre- 
sent in Chinese art, as witness the pain- 
ting, aboveright, by the artist Fu Baoshi 
{1904-1965} and the photo-landscape 
with added calligraph, above far right, 
by the world-famous Hong Kong 
photographer Cheng Fufi.

» technique of monochrome painting, an adept of chan (zen 
in Japanese) spirituality, and a musician as well. The great 
writer and calligrapher Su Shi would write of him: 
You would say his landscapes are poems 
And his poems landscapes. 
Another painter-poet was Du Fu’s friend Zheng Qian, 
who presented the emperor with one of his paintings on 
which he had calligraphed poems. In an extraordinary token 
of esteem, the emperor himself noted on the painting: 
“Zheng Qian, the genius with three talents.” 
This threefold mastery combined in a single person is that 
of the “‘literary-man-painter’’. Literary men’s painting, which 
developed under the Tang dynasty but blossomed above all 
under the Song and the Yuan, the Ming and the Qing, is what 
is usually meant when people discuss Chinese painting. It owes 
its great freedom, directly or indirectly, to Taoist and Buddhist 
influences. 
One of the most subtle masters of this marriage of poetry, 
calligraphy and painting was Su Shi (Su Dongpo, 
1035-1101), with whom the unity of the three arts was 
established, to become the mainstream of Chinese painting. 
One day, while intoxicated at the home of a friend, he 
painted a bamboo tree on the wall and added this 
comentary: 
The alcohol vapours have expanded in my empty belly, 
Rocks and bamboo grow there willy nilly, 
My body cannot cope with them, 
That’s why I project them on your white wall. 
And he went on, not without humour : 
But you, you do not scold me, you seem content. 
There are not many connoisseurs in the world like you,» 
my friend.

One of his contemporaries, Mi Fu, was a famous painter 
and also a gifted calligrapher. The following story is told 
about him, in accordance with a Chinese custom whereby the 
distinctive styles of great painters are described in the form 
of anecdotes: 
“‘One day when he was at Wu-Wei, Mi Fu saw a giant rock 
of extraordinary ugliness. Delighted, he donned his 
ceremonial costume and prostrated himself before the rock, 
which he addressed as ‘dear elder brother’. 
Under the Yuan dynasty (13th-14th century) this three- 
point relationship became even stronger and deeper. Ni Zan 
(or Yunlin, 1301-1374) was outstanding among the great 
masters of the period. He was a peerless landscape painter 
whose work was elegant, austere and imbued with poignant 
nostalgia. 
If painting in China is the complete art form in which poem 
and calligraphy are an integral part of the painting, restoring 
the harmony and mystery of the universe in all its dimensions, 
poetry is considered to be the quintessence of art. It 
transforms the written signs, enjoying an almost sacred

status, into song, and its supreme function is to link human 
genius with the primary vital forces of the universe. Imbued 
with Confucian and Taoist thought, Chinese poetry unites 
reason and detachment. It aspires to penetrate reality and to 
render, with the savour of life, ‘the impalpable rustling of 
sound”’’, helped by the innate musicality of the Chinese 
language with its several tones. 
In the painting, the poem is by no means an adjunct; it in- 
troduces a new dimension and opens the bounds of the picture 
to life in time. Shi Dao, a celebrated painter of the early Qing 
dynasty (18th-19th century), was also the author of a famous 
Treatise on Painting. His life was an unceasing investigation 
both into technical problems and into the nature of artistic 
creation and human destiny. In one of his landscapes he wrote 
these lines: 
This well-nigh deserted spot fills me with joy 
The view of this mountain which hides clouds makes me 
Joyful. 
Then he adds this piece of self-criticism, a reflection which 
is Taoist in inspiration:

branch tip hibiscus blossom 
Chinese poets have always made subtle use of the evocative 
power of calligraphy. In a quatrain the first line of which is 
reproduced above, the poet Wang Wei (701-761). describing an 
hibiscus about to blossom, succeeds in conveying the idea of 
what it would be like to live from within the tree the experience 
of coming into bud and flowering. This is how Frangois Cheng, 
in his book L ‘Ecriture Poétique Chinoise {Chinese poetic writing), 
comments on the first line of Wang Wei’s quatrain. 
“The line can be transfated as: ‘At the branch tips, hibiscus 
blossoms’. Even a reader who knows nothing of Chinese can ap- 
preciate the concordance between the visual appearance of the 
characters and the meaning of the words. Reading the characters 
from left to right one has the impression of watching the process 
of a tree coming into flower {First character: a bare tree; second 
character: something is visible at the end of the branches; third 
character: a bud appears; fourth character: the bud opens; fifth 
character: in full flower). But a reader who knows Chinese will 
see even more. Subtly hidden in the ideograms is the notion of 
man {X) entering into the tree in spirit and participating in its 
metamorphosis.     
  
Chinese poets have used a variety of methods to introduce the idea of 
the Void into their works. Poem above is a veritable labyrinth of signs in 
which, starting from any given point, the reader can choose to take 
many different routes, full of surprises. 
My words are strange, my drawing is clumsy, 
All is but illusion, even this work. 
To look from the poem to the landscape, with its pines, 
clouds and mountains, isto be filled with deeper emotion. Shi 
Dao has heightened our perception of the uplifting of the 
mountain and the Vacuity represented by the clouds. This no- 
tion of Vacuity, no less essential to Chinese philosophy than 
the famous Yin-Yang principle, plays a central role in music 
and poetry but is most fully and visibly expressed in painting. 
Vacuity in a painting does not only mark the ‘““unoccupied”’ 
area in contrast to an ‘‘occupied’’ area; far from being an in- 
ert presence, Vacuity is adynamic element. Linked to theidea 
of the ‘‘breath of life’, it is pre-eminently the location of 
those transformations which lie at the heart of the conception 
of man and the world in Chinese thought. 
The favourite texts of Chinese calligraphers are doubtless 
poetic texts (verses, poems, poetic prose). Calligraphy in 
China exalts the visual beauty of ideograms. In practising this 
major art, every Chinese rediscovers the profound rhythm of 
his being and enters into communion with the elements. Not 
confining himself to the simple act of the copyist, the

Naxi hieroglyphs 
In addition to the characters used by the Han Chinese, certain of China's 
minority nationalities have atone time or another created their own writ- 
ten language. The Naxi {230,000 persons who live mainly in the region 
of Lijiang, Yunan province) developed a hieroglyphic language con- 
sisting of basic pictorial symbols and ideograms. The language was used 
for the composition of canonical books of their religion (known as 
Dongbaism), for recording events of everyday life, keeping accounts, 
and the exchange of messages between mountain villages. It yields im- 
portant evidence on the origins of writing as well as throwing light on the 
Naxi culture. In China today research is being carried out into the links 
between Naxi hieroglyphs and the Chinese language. Table below 
shows, Naxi hieroglyphs (left-hand column), Han hieroglyphs {right 
hand column) and modern Chinese ideograms {central column). Above,

calligrapher reawakens the expressive movement and the im- 
aginary power of signs. Calligraphy must be the total projec- 
tion of the condition of a soul. 
The writer Han Yu praised the famous Tang calligrapher 
Zhang Xu in these words: ‘By the freedom of his script, in 
the cursive style which he invariably practised, he expresses 
his joy and his anger, his pain and his happiness, his jealousies 
and hatreds, his affections and admirations, his intoxication, 
his boredom, injustice, everything that thrills his heart.’’ The 
calligrapher should also exploit the pictorial possibilities, the 
evocative power of characters, as Han Yu adds in his com- 
ments on Zhang Xu: ‘“...he holds everything in his vision: 
landscapes, animals, plants, stars, storms, fires, wars, feasts, 
all the events of the universe, and expresses them through his 
art.” 
Thus in China poetry, calligraphy and painting constitute 
one complete art, a threefold pursuit in which all the spiritual 
dimensions of its devoted practitioners are brought into play: 
linear song and space, incantatory gestures and visualized 
words. BHuang Miaozhi

small without considering it paltry, 
recognizes large without considering it

### 51784: Pen of protest; the seminal work of Lu Xun

Pen 
of protest 
The seminal work 
of Lu Xun 
by Li Helin 
ORN in 1881, at Shaoxing in the Zhejiang province of 
China, Zhou Shu-ren, better known by his pen name, 
Lu Xun, was a major figure of twentieth-century Chinese 
literature. From his pen flowed a stream of short stories, prose- 
poems, essays, translations and historical studies. Twenty-five of 
his short stories on contemporary subjects were published in two 
widely translated collections, Call to Arms and Hesitation. Among 
them, the most famous is The True Story of Ah Q in which, with 
a telling combination of pathos and humour, he highlighted the 
shortcomings of the old social order. In another collection of short 
stories, Old Tales Retold, this time with an historical setting, he 
succeeded in satirizing contemporary life while scrupulously 
respecting historical fact. 
Lu Xun’s inventive spirit revealed itself in Wild Grass, an an- 
thology of twenty-four beautifully concise and subtly allusive 
prose-poems, the only anthology of this genre in modern Chinese 
literature. Morning Flowers Plucked at Dawn recalled his life as a 
youth, but at the same time was a critical exposure of the negative 
aspects of the society of the past. 
A master essayist, Lu Xun also penned some eight hundred 
essays, most of which were political in character. In them he 
assailed feudalism, the compradors, bureaucrats, the bourgeoisie, 
opportunists of left and right and traitors. 
Lu Xun’s historical studies included a Brief History of Han 
Literature and an Outline History of Chinese Fiction. Based 
originally on the lecture notes he used when teaching at Beijing 
University in 1920, his Outline History of Chinese Fiction took ten 
years to revise and complete in its definitive form. No one before 
him had systematically studied the origins of Chinese fiction and 
written, for a wide public, about how it evolved from ancient 
myths and from the legends recounted by the public storytellers of 
the Song (10th to 13th century) and Yuan {13th to 14th century) 
dynasties, reaching a peak with the vernacular novels under the 
. Ming and the Manchu dynasties {14th to 20th century). 
But Lu Xun was not only an accomplished writer, he was also 
a great thinker and revolutionary. In 1903, in A Brief Study of 
Chinese Geology, he voiced his indignation against the plunder of 
the rich mineral resources of China by the imperialist powers. In an 
article published in 1907, he criticized those theoreticians who 
wanted ‘to save China through industrialization’’ and ‘laid stress 
on material things at the expense of things spiritual.” For Lu Xun, 
only through the education of the people could their conscience be 
aroused. He took a dialectical view of the relationship between

Circles, and director of the Lu Xun Museum in Beijing. He is the author 
of a number of studies on Lu Xun and on various aspects of contem- 
porary Chinese literature.

material and spiritual things and called for a China in which man 
would take pride of place. 
In May 1918, six months after the October Revolution, Lu Xun 
published a short story entitled A Madman 's Diary in the magazine 
New Youth. It is interesting to compare the difference of approach 
to the problems of oppressed peoples as expressed in Lu Xun's A 
Madman’s Diary and in the nineteenth century Russian writer 
Gogol’s story of the same name. Gogol's hero is a poordevil who has 
the audacity to fall in love with a government minister's daughter 
and ends up in a lunatic asylum. Although Gogol's story brings out 
the darker aspects of Tsarist society, he stops short of demanding 
its overthrow. Lu Xun’s story, however, shows that throughout its 
centuries-long history Chinese society had been a “man-eating” 
society which, despite its claim to be based on ‘virtue and morali- 
ty’’, ruthlessly exploited the weak and had to be overthrown. Lu 
Xun's anti-feudal ideas were entirely different from those of the 
bourgeois revolutionaries. He aimed not only to sweep away all 
traces of feudal culture, but to destroy completely the ‘‘man- 
eating’’ society which fostered this culture. 
In 1923, Lu Xun gave a lecture at the Beijing Women’s College en- 
titled What happened after Nora left home? This was shortly after 
the period of the reformist protest May Fourth Movement, which 
emerged following the riots which broke out on 4 May 1919 and 
which called for equality between the sexes and for a free choice of 
marriage partners. This was also the time at which the Norwegian 
writer Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House was translated and published 
in Chinese, achieving a wide popular success. Loth to remain her 
husband's puppet, Nora, Ibsen’s heroine, leaves home, an action of 
which most Chinese readers approved. In his lecture, however, Lu 
Xun examined a deeper and more practical question: "What hap- 
pened after Nora left home?’’ He pointed out that in the society of 
the time only two possibilities were open to her—to sink to the 
depths or to return to her husband. So long as women were not 
economically independent and could not work for their living, they 
had either to beg or to remain dependent on men. In a cut-throat 
society there was no other means of survival. 
Lu Xun pointed out that: “The most important problem in today’s 
society seems to be the achievement of economic rights. First there 
must be a fair sharing out between men and women in the family; 
secondly, men and women must have equal rights in society. Unfor- 
tunately, | have no idea how we are to obtain these rights; all | know 
is that we have to fight for them, and we may even have to fight 
harder for them than for political rights. If you speak about the equal 
distribution of wealth you will probably find yourselves faced with 
enemies who will fight you bitterly. For in present-day society it is 
not just women who are the puppets of men; men contro! other men 
and women control women; and sometimes men are even the pup- 
pets of women. This problem will not be solved by the acquisition 
by a handful of women of their economic rights. But people withp

p empty stomachs cannot sit back and wait for the arrival of an ideal 
world; so we need this relatively attainable goal until we can devise 
other measures. Of course, if the economic system changes then all 
this is empty talk’’. 
Lu Xun returned to the theme expounded in What happened after 
Nora left home? in his story Regret for the Past, written two years 
later. In this story, in defiance of feudal ethical codes, the hero and 
heroine come together in a marriage of love. However, since Zijun, 
the heroine, is not economically independent, she becomes merely 
a housewife, busy cooking, feeding the chickens and looking after 
the dog. 
When Juansheng, the hero, loses his job, he realizes that, blinded 
by love, he has neglected all the other important things in life. ‘A 
man must make a living before there can be any place for love...”’ 
He begins to see his wife as a burden. ‘’She never opens a book any 
more and has forgotten that the most important thing in life is to 
make a living. To do this a couple must go forward hand in hand, or 
else struggle on alone.” Finally, he tells her ruthlessly that he no 
longer loves her. They partand Zijun returns to her parents, who had 
opposed the idea of her choosing freely her own marriage partner. 
In the cold and hostile atmosphere of her parents’ home she falls into 
a decline and finally departs a loveless world. 
Lu Xun’s activity as a writer and a social thinker cannot be divorc- 
ed from the practical role he played in the revolutionary struggle. In 
1904, when he was living in Japan, he joined the Liberation Society, 
arevolutionary group opposed to the Manchu dynasty thenin power 
in China. From 1911 to 1925, while he was teaching in his home 
town of Shaoxing, and at the Women’s College in Beijing he carried 
on the patriotic struggle drawing his own students into it. His 
political stance earned for him the hostility of a number of politicians 
and bourgeoisintellectuals. In 1926, threatened with arrest, he took 
refuge in a hospital. 
In 1928, he joined the Revolutionary Mutual Aid Society, to 
whose funds he was a regular contributor. In 1930, in Shanghai, he 
participated in the founding of the China League of Left-wing 
Writers, but a warrant for his arrest was issued and once again he 
was forced to go into hiding. In 1933, together with Song Qinling,. 
the widow of Sun Yat-sen, Cai Yuanpei and Yang Quan, he helped 
to organize the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights in pro- 
test against the illegal imprisonment and assassination of revolu- 
tionaries and to provide a basis for the fight for democracy and liber- 
ty. In May of that year, accompanied by Song Qinling and Cai Yuan- 
pei, he went to the German consulate in Shanghai to hand in a pro- 
test against the persecution of writers and the burning of books on 
the orders of Hitler. On June 18, Yang Quan, the deputy leader of 
the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights, was 
assassinated. On June 20, against the advice of his friends, and 
braving the risk of being himself assassinated, Lu Xun attended 
Yang Quan’s funeral, 
It would not be possible here to list all Lu Xun’s activities aimed 
at achieving the radical social transformation he so much wanted for 
his country. One thing is certain, his works have stood the test of 
time, and bothin his writings and in his actions he was always to be 
found on the side of the common people and the oppressed.

### 51793: Night thoughts, November 1926

Night 
thoughts, 
November 
1926 
by Lu Xun 
HIS evening (1), all around me, everythings perfectly 
calm. Behind my dwelling, at the foot of the moun- 
tain, a grass fire burns with little, flickering flames. 
ow and then, the sound of drums and gongs reaches me 
from the South Putuo Temple (2), where a marionette perfor- 
mance is taking place. When the distant noise ceases, the 
silence returns with even greater insistence. My lamp shines 
brightly, but a twinge of unhappiness creeps up on me from 
goodness knows where, and I have the impression that I am 
sorry to have had my essays printed. This sense of regret sur- 
prises me: it is out of keeping with my characters. But before 
I can pinit down, it evaporates. Of course, I must press ahead, 
and have the essays published; but if only to exorcize this 
melancholy, I feel that I must add one or two words more. 
As I have said before, these essays are no more than a few 
traces left by my life, if my past can be called a life. I have 
worked hard enough, but my thought is not a gushing spring, 
my literary talent is without great brilliance and, since I have 
no doctrine to advance, I have no intention of launching a 
movement of any kind. But experience has taught me that 
disappointment,-whether great or small, has a bitter taste. 
Thisis why, whenever inrecent years have beenasked to take 
up my pen, have never refused. Provided that their opinions 
were not diametrically opposed to my own, and that I have 
had the energy to do so, I have always tried to give a little 
satisfaction to others. 
Readers who claim me for their favourite writer often say 
that I express the truth. This is excessive praise induced, no 
doubt, by their very partiality. It is true that I do not seek to 
deceive, but neither do I try to recount all that is within me. 
What I express is merely a few odds and ends, just enough to 
hand in to the printer. Itis true that I often try to dissect other 
people, but I apply the scalpel even more frequently to myself, 
and with far less pity. When I lift only a corner of the veil, sen- 
sitive spirits quail. What if I were to reveal myself entirely, ex- 
actly as I am? 
It occurs to me from time to time to use this method to drive 
people away, so that those who even then did not abandon 
me, ‘‘snakes and odious monsters’’ (3) though they might be, 
would show themselves to be my friends, true friends after all, 
And if even they left me in the lurch, then too bad, I’d walk 
alone. But for the time being I refrain from putting this idea 
into practice, partly because I lack the courage to do so, and 
partly because I want to go on living in this society. But there 
1s another little reason, too, which I have mentioned several 
times: it gives me a certain satisfaction to create for as long 
as I can a feeling of unease among our ‘‘respectable and right- 
thinking’ fellow-citizens. This is why I shall continue to gird

myself with a few pieces of armour and stand before them, 
disturbing their orderly world with my presence, until I 
become tired of the whole business and take off this armour. 
To serve as a guide to others is all the more difficult for me, 
since I myself do not know which path to follow. There is cer- 
* tainly no lack of ‘‘masters’’ and ‘‘guides’’ in China, but I am 
not among them and they do not inspire my confidence. There 
1s only-one outcome of which I myself am certain, and that 
is the tomb. But this is something everybody knows, without 
having to consult a guide. The problem is that more than one 
way leads to that ultimate destination, and up to now I have 
been unable to determine which of them to take. I am still try- 
ing to find out, and I am very much afraid that my still-green 
fruit should poison those who appreciate me, while those who 
detest me—the ‘‘respectable and right-thinking’’, for 
example—all live to a ripe old age. It is thus inevitable for me 
to clothe my words in ambiguity, since it often occurs to me 
that the best gift I can offer to readers who are fond of me 
might well be ‘‘inconsistency.”’ 
The first edition of my translations and original works was 
printed in a thousand copies; five hundred more were printed 
later. My most recent works have appeared in editions of two 
thousand and four thousand copies. Of course each increase 
is welcome, if only because it means that I shall earn more 
money, but I cannot help feeling unhappy that my writings 
might be morally harmful to my readers. This is why I now 
write with a great deal more circumspection and hesitation. 
Some people imagine that I write spontaneously, that the 
words pour out in total freedom. Nothing could be further 
from the truth: I am inhibited by a host of scruples and uncer- 
tainties, I have known for along time that I am not of the stuff 
that warriors and pioneers are made of. Three or four years 
ago, I remember, a student arrived to buy one of my books. 
The money which he took out of his pocket and pressed into 
my hand was warm with the heat of his body. And that 
warmth penetrated me, so much so that ever since then, 
whenever I take up my pen, I am afraid of poisoning people 
like that student; I hesitate for a long time before putting a 
single word on paper. I fear that the time will never come 
again when I can speak without such reserve, and although I 
sometimes think that in order to respond to the expectations 
of the younger generation one should sweep every scruple 
aside, I have not, as yet, managed to bring myself to do so. 
That is all I intended to say today, and it may be taken as 
relatively sincere. But I do wish to add a few final remarks. 
I remember that when the idea first emerged of creating a 
literature based on our spoken language, it was violently at- 
tacked from every side. Later, when it had gained ground to 
the extent that a reversal of the tendency was impossible, 
many of its former critics turned their coats and claimed 
credit for the change, which they glorified as the ‘‘new 
culture’ (4) movement. Others proposed that the spoken 
language be used as the popular language; while still others 
recommended a return to the study of the classics as a means 
of acquiring perfect mastery of the spoken language. It was 
not long before the turncoats made yet another pirouette, and 
began to vilify the ‘new culture’. As for the other two 
groups, they have reluctantly accepted the new language, 
while conserving the hope that the old one will nevertheless be 
kept alive as long as possible; there are plenty of such people 
still about, and I have denounced them in my essays. 
A few days ago, I came across a journal from Shanghai (5), 
in which it is also maintained that a study of the classics is 
obligatory if one wishes to write well in the spoken language; 
the names of a number of writers are cited as examples in this 
connexion, including my own. This makes me shudder. I can- 
not speak for the others, but in my own case, it is true that I 
have read many classic works, and that I continue to do so for 
my own enlightenment. As a result, my eyes and ears are full 
of them, and this influences the vocabulary, construction and 
style of my bai hua (6), which sometimes contains archaisms. 
But it is also true that it is very painful and suffocating for me 
to carry these old monsters around on my back, and not be 
able to rid myself of them. : 
Asfar asthe poverty of the present popular language is con- 
cerned, the question of ways and means of enriching it con- 
stitutes another important problem. Perhaps this might be 
achieved by the injection of suitable material drawn from ane 
cient literature, but this is a matter which lies outside the scope 
of my present remarks, and I shall refrain from dealing with 
it here. 
I do believe, however, that with an effort, I might be able 
to correct my own texts by introducing words and expressions 
from the spoken language. If I have failed to do so up to now, 
this is simply because I am lazy, and have not had the time. 
Unfortunately, all this coincides with the publication of 
this collection of essays, which are written partly in classical 
and partly in spoken Chinese. They may, therefore, still be a 
poison to certain readers. But I am unable, for the moment, 
to bring myself to destroy them; I might even go further, and 
say that I shall make use of therm myself, for the glimpse that 
they give of myself as I was when they were written. All that 
I ask 1s that the readers who appreciate me consider this col- 
lection as no more than a simple memorial—a grave-mound 
covering a body from which life has fled. With the passage of 
time, the body will turn to dust, and not even the memorial 
will remain. And by then, I, too, will have laid down my arms. 
_ This morning, as I was indeed reading a classic wotk, a few 
lines from Lu Ji’s (7) Lamentation on the Death of Cao Cao 
came into my head. Let them serve as my own conclusion 
here. 
Refusing the ritual burden of the ancients, 
You wanted a funeral with less circumstance and pomp. 
Where are your fur coats, then, your finery, your seals? 
All that remains is the grumbling of the princes in the 
: procession. 
Alas! Even a wise man like you was unable to resist 
Excessive attachment to worldly goods. 
Reading the document that betrays your weakness, 
I dedicate these lines to you, with regrets. 
Lu Xun 
On the night of 11 November 1926 
  
1. The postface to The Tomb, from which this text is extracted, was written 
in November 1926, about a year after completion of the last of the essays of 
which the work consists. Lu Xun had recently left Beijing, where his freedom 
had been threatened and had taken a teaching post at the university of Xiamen 
(Amoy). 
2. The temple is situated near the university of Xiamen. 
3. In the original: **Xiao, snakes, and revenants’’, Xiao was an unpleasant 
mythical bird whose repellent attributes included devouring its own mother. 
4. The movement for literary reform in favour of ‘spoken’ language and 
literature which formed part of the “Fourth of May’ cultural demonstrations 
in 1919. Lu Xun’s irony is particularly directed against Hu Shi, who joined 
in the movement at the beginning, quickly changed sides to become one of 
its most bitter adversaries, but later claimed to have been its originator and 
main architect. The term ‘‘new culture’’ was used by Hu Shiin a number of 
articles on the history of the “Fourth of May’. 
5. Vol. I, No. 3 of the monthly magazine Yiban (Just So) published by Kai- 
ming and dated 11 November 1926 contains an article by Ming Shi (alias Zhu 
Guangshuan), entitled Yutiande shu (The rainy days book) in which it is stated 
that in order to write good bai hua, i.e, “spoken language’ it is necessary 
to read wenyani.e. the classics. The article goes on to say that this is the case 
of Hu Shi, Wu Zhihui, Zhou Zuoren and Lu Xun, “although they may not 
admit this themselves*’, 
6. Writing in the “spoken language.” 
7. Lu Ji (261-303) was a famous writer. Cao Cao (155-220) was a general 
renowned for his military prowess, and a politician. In his testament, which 
Lu Jiread just before writing this poem, Cao Cao called for a simplification 
of the funeral ceremonies governed by ancient tradition, but at the same time 
refused any sharing out of his “clothes of fur’ and of the “ribbons decorating 
the seals’; his last wishes also included instructions to the female singers at 
his funeral.

### IGNORE

China through the ages 
The origins of the Chinese people go back at least 
a million years to a hominid who appeared in 
China at the end of the second glacial period. 
With Beijing Man, who lived about 400,000 years 
ago appeared the first signs of a communal 
culture, and with the Xia kingdom the Chinese 
people emerged from the mists of prehistory to 
embark on the adventure of modern times. On 
the following eight colour pages we offer a brief 
glimpse of eternal China through the ages.

Ding Ling, whose career spans more than half a century, is one of China’s most popular authors. She is seen 
here during a visit to a farm co-operative in 1955. 
am a Chinese writer, and for the first sixty years of my 
1 life I lived, worked and wrote in the wake of the 
Chinese people, by whose difficulties I have been 
guided and inspired. In this way I came to know the world 
and its contradictions, but at the cost of many trials and 
tribulations. Today, at seventy-seven, one hope remains—to 
be able to serve my fellow countrymen until I die. 
I was born in 1904, at a time when the Manchu Empire 
was in its death throes, into a family of notables, a breeding- 
ground of mandarins such as described in those great classic 
Chinese novels Dream of the Red Chamber, by Cao Xueqin, 
and The Scholars, by Wu Jingzi. 
My family was a replica in miniature of feudal society in 
decline and its history was a chequered one. The branch of 
the family to which my father belonged was impoverished 
and going rapidly downhill, and when I was four years old 
my father died completely ruined. My lonely childhood gave 
me an insight into the miserable lot of the people in the 
Chinese society of the beginning of the twentieth century 
and opened my eyes to the selfish attitudes which governed 
relationships between one man and another. I found com- 
fort in, and learned much from, reading the great Chinese 
classic novels. European renaissance literature and foreign 
literature of the nineteenth century was also grist to my mill. 
And it was this reading that sowed in me the seed of my 
vocation as a writer. 
I had the good fortune to have an enlightened mother. 
After my father’s death she freed herself from the shackles 
of the family, becoming a teacher to maintain her in- 
dependence. She had adopted Western democratic ideas and 
nourished a vague hope of a socialist revolution. She often 
told me stories of great historical figures, Chinese and 
foreign, from both remote and recent times, who had 
distinguished themselves by their heroism, generosity of 
spirit and loyalty. These stories helped to dispel the melan- 
choly that had taken root in my young heart. 
I was fourteen years old at the time of the events of May 
1919 and my mother and I plunged into this current of 
patriotic, reformist protest which was later to be known as 
the May Fourth Movement. This experience was a revela- 
tion to me, shaking me out of the sheltered personal world 
in which I had enclosed myself. Previously I had looked on 
my studies as a means to earn a livelihood, to achieve per- 
sonal success and to restore my family to its former glories. 
Suddenly I discovered new and nobler aims: to take part in 
the struggle to lift the people out of their wretched state, to 
break the centuries old feudal system and to free China 
from its colonial status. 
Leaving my provincial school at Changsa, in Hunan, I 
went to Shanghai where I enrolled in the first school for girls 
established by the Communist Party. There I met several 
famous revolutionaries who taught me much and encourag-»

ped me in the path I was taking, The Chinese Communist 
Party had only recently been founded and was still feeling 
its way forward, seeking to elaborate a doctrine in which 
would merge the Chinese revolutionary tendency and the 
Marxism-Leninism the Party was propagating in China. I 
was too inexperienced to play a useful part in the Party’s 
work and action. With my petty bourgeois illusions I was 
eager to soar directly towards the extremes of liberty. But 
everywhere I came up against the harsh realities of the day 
and I soon sank back into a mood of deep depression. 
I felt isolated and demoralized, but I was still young and 
vital enough to feel the urge to cry out, to express myself. 
The only outlet available to me was to pour out on. paper my 
feelings of revolt against the society of which I was a 
prisoner. It seemed natural, then, for me to follow the ex- 
ample of Lu Xun, Mao Dun and my communist mentor Qu 
Qiubai, who was to die later in a Guomindang gaol. Like 
them I became a writer, not out of personal vanity or out 
of a love of art for art’s sake, but to defend my fellow coun- 
trymen and help them to achieve liberty, The same objec- 
tives motivated other writers, both my contemporaries and 
those of the following generation, to engage in a literature 
of combat, even though there were at the time, as there are 
also today in our vast country, authors who were only con- 
cerned with literature as an art form. 
After the failure of the 1927 revolution and the massacre of 
militants by the Guomindang, I felt obliged to reflect more 
32

deeply on political matters. I had already acquired a certain 
reputation in literary circles and could have mixed with the 
uppercrust, found a good job and then climbed gradually up 
the social ladder. Indeed, this was what some of my friends 
chose to do. But this option was not for me, I hated the vanity 
of this coterie and its obsession with celebrity and material ad- 
vantage, so I continued along what seemed to me to be the 
right path. 
During the 1930s, while the Guomindang reactionaries 
were stepping up their “white terror’, I became a member of 
the China League of Left-wing Writers, in Shanghai, which 
was headed by Lu Xun and directed by the Communist Party. 
Subsequently, I joined the Chinese Communist Party since I 
wanted to give myself up totally to the cause of the people, to 
share their destiny, their cares and their sufferings, to live and 
die with them. During the 1920s my female characters had 
been petty bourgeois intellectuals in revolt; from the 1930s 
onwards they were based on working women and peasants. 
This the Guomindang government could not tolerate and a’ 
single article of this nature published at that time could lead 
to imprisonment. 
Then, just half a century ago, five members of the League, 
including my husband Hu Yepin, and ten revolutionaries 
were assassinated by the Guomindang police in the sinister 
Longhua prison in Shanghai. Although the world has 
witnessed many other horrors since then, it is hard to imagine 
how young writers could have thus been so cruelly gunned

down. In fact, mere possession of a book with a red cover was 
considered ground for arrest. Many writers were summarily 
executed in prison or on pieces of waste ground, with no 
pretence at atrial. They are counted among the martyrs of the 
revolution, 
In 1933, I myself was arrested and imprisoned and only 
escaped death thanks to an appeal made by the China League 
for the Protection of Civil Rights, founded by Song Qinling, 
the widow of Sun Yat-sen, Cai Yuanbei, the former rector of 
the University of Beijing, the writer Lu Xun and others, and 
the protests of well-known foreign authors such as Henri Bar- 
busse, Romain Rolland, Maksim Gorki and Paul Vaillant- 
Couturier. Allmy books were banned and I became the object 
of scurrilous political and personal attacks in the press. 
About three years later, with the help of Lu Xun and the Par- 
ty, I was able to flee Nanjing, then the official capital, and set- 
tle in the communist base in northern Shanxi. 
During the Sino-Japanese War, 1 followed the communist 
eighth army to the front, working as a propagandist. 
Thereafter I continued my literary work in Yenan, the focal 
point of the struggle against the occupying forces. After the 
war against the Japanese imperialists was won, the struggle 
for liberation went on against the Guomindang forces. I also 
took part in the agrarian reform which abolished the feudal 
land system and redistributed the land. In the new China that 
had just been established I was given the task of helping inthe 
Domestic utensils 
reorganization of literary life. So absorbed was I in this task 
that I almost forgot that I too was a writer. It was only when 
this practical work was completed that I began once again to 
be haunted by the characters buried deep within my soul. I 
became eager to reveal their existence by writing them into my 
novels, stories and essays. 
When I write, I do not allow myself to become entangled 
in problems of style or form or to impose on myself the strait- 
jacket of any literary school whatever. Nor do I take into ac- 
count what the critics will say. Once my work is published, the 
only thing that matters to me is what my readers think. My 
pen follows the thread of my imagination and I stick to my

first impulses, not trying to refashion the characters I have ° 
known and loved in my life and who become the heroes and 
heroines of my books. 
Today I am more than ever convinced that we, the Chinese 
people, one thousand million individuals, united in a com- 
mon inspiration and led by the Communist Party, will suc- 
ceed in enriching our lives, liberating our thinking, living 
democratically and working and learning together, In this 
way, and only in this way, will our country be able to 
contribute largely to human progress and world peace. In this 
way too, Chinese literature, with its own special attributes, 
will play its part in enriching the universal artistic heritage of 
mankind.

The 
modernization 
of science 
and 
technology 
Old China is credited with the four 
great inventions of the compass, 
paper-making techniques, print- 
ing, and gunpowder. New China 
has embarked on a far-reaching 
programme for the modernization 
of science and technology as a key 
to development. Photos on these 
pages evoke a very small selection 
of scientific and technological ac- 
tivities and achievements in China 
today. 
A. Chinese archaeologists are 
systematically and scientifically ex- 
cavating, restoring and preserving the 
tomb of emperor Qin (d. 210 BC), 
guarded by the army of life-size clay 
soldiers whose discovery was one of 
the most exciting events in ar- 
chaeology in recent years. 
B. Chief engineer Zhi Bingyi (left) has 
invented a new method for adapting 
Chinese characters to the computer. 
C. Farm kitchen equipped with 
methane produced from fermented 
organic wastes. This system is widely 
used for cooking and lighting in the 
countryside. 
D. On 20 September 1981, for the 
first time, China launched three space 
research satellites from a single 
rocket. China has launched 11 
satellites since 1970. 
1. Plants are more sensitive to air 
pollution than people. Following ex- 
periments which attracted interna- 
tional interest, Chinese scientists 
have identified a number of species 
which can be used as pollution- 
detectors oras agen s f rpu ifying the 
atmosphere of toxic gases. Here, staff 
of the Botanical Institute of southern 
China use smoke to select pollution- 
sensitive plants. 
2. Normal tissue of the rose-laurel leaf 
3. Section of a rose-laurel leaf. Tissue 
cells show signs of being affected by 
toxic gases. 
4. Ficus elastica is one of some 20 
trees and bushes whose leaves are 
resistant to chlorine and sulphur di- 
oxide and are capable of purifying the 
atmosphere. 
5. Hibiscus rose-sinensis is a detector 
of chlorine.

### 51798: Immortal clay; from neolithic times to today, a panorama of Chinese ceramics

Immortal clay 
From neolithic times to today, 
a panorama of Chinese ceramics 
by Li Jixian 
ERHAPS nowhere in the 
world have pottery and por- 
celain assumed so much im- 
portance as in China. The influence of 
Chinese ceramics in other world 
regions has also been profound for in 
the development of pottery glazes 
and porcelain as in other fields China 
can claim a long priority over the rest 
of the world. Below, some of the key 
stages and great achievements in the 
history of Chinese ceramics, a tradi- 
tion which has surged back to life in 
modern China. 
Neolithic origins. The Yangshao 
culture, so named after a site 
discovered in 1920, developed in the 
Yellow River Valley during neolithic 
times. Craftsmen of this culture pro- 
duced pottery painted with exquisite 
geometric patterns and lively animal 
motifs which, together with the black 
pottery with etched designs of the 
Hemudu culture of Zhejiang Pro- 
vince, reveal the outstanding 
creativity of the ancient Chinese. 
The earliest earthenware was 
somewhat  loose-textured and 
porous, but by late neolithic times the 
Chinese had learned to use earth con- 
taining kaolin, or China clay, to make 
wares which they fired at 
temperatures as high as 1,000 
degrees centigrade. 
Next Chinese potters stumbled 
upon the secret of glaze. When firing 
pottery they may have noticed that 
scattered alkaline ashes left glossy 
 
LIJIXIAN isengagedonresearchin the Art In- 
stitute of the Academy of Chinese Arts. A 
specialist in ancient Chinese ceramics, he has 
written over a dozen studies on such themes as 
the earthenware of the gijia culture and 
porcelain in the reign of the emperor Kangxi.

specks on the wares, for they began 
to leave ashes on the surface of semi- 
finished pottery before firing it. Glaze 
smoothed the coarse surface of the 
pottery, made it easier to wash, and 
added greatly to its beauty. Thus 
came into being the earliest kaolinic 
porcelain, covered with a yellowish 
lead glaze produced by high- 
temperature firing. (Chemical 
analysis has shown that the primitive 
celadon wares of the Shang dynasty 
of 3,000 years ago are basically iden- 
tical in composition to later 
porcelain). 
From the Eastern Han dynasty 
(25-220 AD) to the Three Kingdoms 
and the Souther and Northern 
dynasties (221-581 AD). Potters 
working during the Eastern Han 
dynasty, especially those who pro- 
duced the celadon wares of the 
southeast, furtherimproved the firing 
process, producing smoother sur- 
faces. Celadon ware is decorated 
with glazes ranging from various 
shades of green to blue and grey. The 
colours are the result of a wash of li- 
quefied clay (slip) containing iron that 
was put over the body before glazing. 
Theironinteracted with the glaze dur- 
ing firing and coloured it. The Three 
Kingdoms Period and the Southern 
and Northern dynasties witnessed 
the rapid development of celadon 
wares. Potters began to apply a thick 
and evendark green wash to the body 
before glazing. 
The Tang dynasty (618-906) was a 
great period in the development of 
Chinese pottery. The two major pro- 
ducts were the white pottery of 
Xingzhou (Hebei Province) and the 
celadon wares of Yuezhou in Zhe- 
jlang Province. Famed for its refine-

Tang potters were unsurpassed at modelling 
horses in a variety of spirited poses and pro- 
ducing highly expressive glazed or unglazed 
figurines. Works shown here were unearthed 
at Xi'an (Chang-an) China's ancient capital and 
the starting point of the Silk Road.

ment and whiteness, Xingzhou pot- 
tery was described by a contem- 
porary scholar, Lu Chu, as being ‘as 
white as snow’ or ‘‘as white as 
silver’’. The transparent glaze of 
Yuezhou ware won the admiration of 
many poets, who praised its glossy 
smoothness as ‘‘the emerald green of 
a thousand peaks’’ and described its 
transparency as ‘‘autumn water’’, 
Finé clay and refined firing tech- 
niques gave the wares a mellifluous 
sound when tapped, and ceramics 
were in fact used as musical in- 
struments in ancient China, especial- 
ly during the Tang dynasty. The ex- 
cellent musician Guo Daoyuan pro- 
duced sweet sounds by tapping with 
chopsticks on twelve teacups (six 
from Xingzhou, six from Yuezhou) 
filled with different volumes of water; 
the sound was more pleasant than 
that of musical instruments made of 
bronze. 
It was also during the Tang dynasty 
that potters developed the world- 
famous ‘‘three-colour’” glazed pot- 
tery figurines. They created forms 
and motifs that vividly illustrate the 
life and culture of feudal society in 
China. 
The Song dynasty (960-1279) 
marks a high point in the history of 
Chinese pottery. Each of the five 
famous wares for which this period is

example of the exquisite guang ware

celebrated—Ding, Ru, Guang, Jun 
and Ge— was noted for its own 
unique style. The exquisitely 
beautiful Ding ware was noted for its 
smooth, cream-coloured glaze, with 
underglaze decorative designs made 
by transfer printing, painting or 
engraving in the paste. Ru ware was 
covered with a thick glaze mixed with 
powdered agate to produce a dark 
green colour. The sturdy crystal 
green Guang porcelain gave the im- 
pression of great age. The Jun pot- 
ters mixed a small quantity of copper 
oxide into their glazes which after fir- 
ing became red or purple. 
The origin of the unique crackled 
surface of Ge ware is recorded in a 
Chinese folk-tale which tells how 
once upon a time two brothers of 
Longquan county in Zhejiang pro- 
vince each opened a pottery 
workshop. The goods produced by 
the elder brother sold far and wide, to 
the dismay of the younger brother 
who could not sell his own wares. 
One day when the elder brother was 
about to open the door of his kiln, the 
younger brother, spurred by envy and 
hatred, splashed cold water on the 
wares inside. The surface of the pot- 
tery cracked at once, and to his great 
surprise the younger brother had 
created a successful new product for 
his elder whose kiln was from then on 
known as the Ge (elder brother} kiln. 
The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) 
and the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) 
were the golden age of painted white 
pottery. Jingdezhen, perhaps the 
Ming three-colour vase dating from the late

best-known factory in the history of 
Chinese ceramics, became the 
leading centre. Its basic product was 
underglaze blue and white porcelain, 
the emergence of which, together 
with that of red porcelain, marked the 
beginning of the painted pottery 
period. Production of blue-and-white 
underglaze porcelain became the 
mainstay of the Chinese porcelain in- 
dustry and was exported all over the 
world. 
The development of famille rose 
porcelain also opened up new 
avenues of creativity. Famille rose is 
the name given in nineteenth-century 
France to enamelled porcelain in 
which rose pink, made from gold 
chloride, predominates. These pro- 
ducts brought great prosperity to 
Jingdezhen. 
Modern China. During the past thir- 
ty years several of the ancient kilns 
have been restored and many new 
porcelain factories established. 
Jingdezhen now produces imita- 
tions of traditional colour-glazed 
porcelain, among which jihong (crim- 
son) pottery is one of the most 
precious. New glazes have also been 
developed on the basis of traditional 
wares. Kilns with a long tradition 
such as the Longquan kiln of Zhe- 
jiang, the Cizhou kiln and Ding kilns of 
Hebei, the Jun and Ru kilns of Henan 
and the Jianyang kiln of Fujian have 
succeeded in producing replicas of 
the old wares which match the best 
ancient porcelain. nu

N a vast green carpet, eighty-three-year-old Fu 
Maokun is demonstrating how to wield a long 
sword. A veteran practitioner of the Chinese 
martial arts (wushu) who won fame in his youth when he 
killed a buffalo with a blow from the side of his hand, he 
twirls the weapon, over a metre long, with great force. 
Fu Maokun’s performance is followed attentively by a 
young boy, Huang Mingjian, who in his turn manipulates 
a three-metre-long rod, making it whizz noisily as it hurtles. 
through the air. 
Their brilliant display, loudly applauded by 5,000 spec- 
tators, was part of a national demonstration of wushu 
recently held in the ancient city of Xian. No less than 232 
adepts took part, showing their skill with sword, spear 
and rod, as well as the various forms of Chinese boxing. 
In addition to these exhibitions of the traditional martial 
arts, some of the participants also displayed such rarely 
seen exercises as the ‘devil's foot’’ and the ‘Buddhist 
sword". 
Wushu (often called gongfu outside China) is one of the 
country’s most popular sports. A unique phenomenon, it 
has a long history for Chinese workers have always con- 
sidered wushu to be an excellent physical and moral exer- 
cise as well as a form of self-defence. There are four 
categories of wushu: boxing with bare fists, contests in- 
volving the use of weapons, and contests between either 
two or several adversaries. 
There are several forms of wushu boxing, each adapted 
to different conditions. Changquan boxing, which 
demands astonishing rapidity and great suppleness, is 
practised above all by children and adolescents. Taiji box- 
ing, with its gentle, relaxed movements, is particularly 
suitable for elderly persons, the sick and those with a 
weak constitution. Xingyi boxing calls for energy and 
great self-control, and is practised both by young people 
and adults. Nanquan (southern boxing) whichis popularin 
some of China's southern provinces, consists largely of 
arm movements, precise leg movements, and shouts 
through which the fighters express their force. Shaolin 
boxing is very popular in northern China. Its neat figures 
and brisk movements are extremely impressive. There are 
also the “imitative’’ forms of boxing, so-called because 
they imitate the movements of, for example, the praying 
mantis or the drunkard, and are based on meticulous 
observation of living creatures and human nature.

known as “shooting stars’. 
Combat may take place between two or several per- 
sons who, according to the appropriate figures, with or 
without weapons, execute the precise movements which 
are required. Wushu consists of rhythmical sets of evolu- 
tions composed of basic movements such as dodging, 
turning, leaping, sudden changes of position, and high 
and long jumping. Execution of these movements calls for 
harmony between manual gestures and movements of 
the eyes and legs; the action should take place at 
headlong speed, the fighter should be steadfast as arock, 
the movements as fluent as running water and as swift as 
an attacking snake. When watching a contestit is always 
astonishing to see the rapidity with which blow follows 
ow. 
Wushu is a sport which is suitable for young and old 
alike. It can be practised at any time of the year, and no 
complicated equipment is required. In China it has been 
popular for centuries. Morning and evening wushu adepts 
of all ages can be seen in the streets enjoying their 
favourite sport. In the big cities such as Beijing and 
Shanghai there are over 100,000 amateurs of wushu. 
Some towns have created martial arts schools and clubs 
for teenagers, as well as organizing training courses in 
tail. 
Wushu is a deeply rooted tradition in rural China. In cer- 
tain parts of Hebei, for example, the sport has long been 
popular. The city of Cangzhou (population 200,000) has 
a hundred-odd training establishments where over a hun- 
dred experienced boxers teach their art to more than 
40,000 youngsters and teenagers. Of the 500 villages in 
Yongfengdistrict, over 300 have a wushu organization. In 
the village of Diquan in Boye district, two-thirds of the 
families practise the sport, part of a tradition which goes 
back hundreds of years. They apply themselves to wushu 
before and after work and even during moments of relaxa- 
tion in the fields, where it is often possible to see two 
young people taking part in an impromptu contest to 
universal delight. 
The massive popularity of wushu has led to the 
emergence of many gifted young practitioners, and the 
great enthusiasm for the sport has encouraged constant

refinements in movements and style. 
From the time of the Western Zhou dynasty (11th 
century-722 BC) wushu was considered, like shooting 
and riding, as a military sport. The existence of xiangpu, 
a kind of wrestling which is popular in modem Japan, is 
already mentioned during the Han dynasty 
(202 BC-220 AD). Towards the end of the Ming dynasty 
(1368-1644) a boxer of the monastery of Shaolin named 
Chen Yuanfu popularized his art in Japan. 
Combined with Japanese jujitsu, it was eventually 
transformed into judo, today an Olympic sport. Many 
Japanese, Korean, Thai and Philippine schools of boxing 
have also been influenced, to a greater or lesser degree, 
by Chinese wushu. 
In recent years wushu has attracted a wide following 
outside China. In Japan, the first country to adopt the 
Chinese martial arts, the Union of Shaolin Boxing, found- 
ed by Do Shin So, has 2,600 branches and over a million 
members. In Malaysia the Jingwu Club is a national 
sporting organization with activities throughout the coun- 
try. In Singapore, wushu comes under the auspices of the 
National Federation of Martial Arts; in the Philippines itis 
represented by the Guanghan Martial Arts Commission. 
National competitions, tournaments and demonstrations 
are regularly organized in these countries of southeast 
Asia, and five regional competitions have been held since 
1969. 
Wushu has a growing number of followers in the United 
States and Canada. There are some forty wushu clubs in 
New York City alone, and other centres where wushu is 
popular include San Francisco, Boston and Los Angeles. 
Several demonstrations have beenorganized according to 
the Chinese method, i.e. the participants are grouped in 
three categories: boxing, weaponry and polyvalent. 
A wave of enthusiasm for wushu has also swept 
through Europe. In the United Kingdom, 200,000 people 
practise the Chinese martial arts, and in France a Chinese 
martial arts association groups forty clubs and 4,000 
members. In March 1982, for the first time, the European 
gongfu federation meeting in the United Kingdom brought 
together representatives from the UK, France, the 
Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain and 
Switzerland. Since then it appears that other countries 
have expressed a wish to join the Federation. It seems 
highly probable that wushu will soon be an Olympic sport.

### 51808: On Lao She, 1899-1966

On 
[Lao She 
1899-1966 
  
Chinese literature, Lao She (his real name 
was Shu She-Yu) was born in humble cir- 
cumstances in Beijing in 1899. 
When he was only two years old, his father, a soldier 
in the Manchu army, was killed during the defence of 
Beijing at the time of the Boxer uprising and from then 
on his early life was one of great poverty. Despite this 
handicap he worked his way upto become ateacher and 
at the age of seventeen he was principal of an elemen- 
tary school. 
In 1924, Lao She went to England where he earned 
a living by teaching Mandarin Chinese and col- 
laborating in the translation of Chinese classics. He is 
said to have been inspired to write his first novel by 
reading the works of Charles Dickens to improve his 
English, 
By the time he returned to China, in 1930, his early 
novels had established his reputation as a humorous 
writer. He portrayed the comic side of the life of the 
poor, a life he knew so well from personal experience; 
but it was a humour that was always close to tears. 
A prolific writer, he produced in rapid succession 
three volumes of short stories and two novels: The Life 
of Zhang Tian-Zi (1934) and Xian-zi the Camel (1936), 
better known under thetitle of its English translation as 
Rickshaw Boy. These highly successful novels marked 
a watershed in his writing; leaving his earlier in- 
dividualistic themes, he turned to a preoccupation with 
the overall social environment. 
During the Japanese war, Lao She turned to the 
theatre and, as head of the National Writer's Anti- 
Aggression Association, he wrote several patriotic pro- 
paganda plays of somewhat uneven quality. His best 
known plays were written after the establishment of the 
communist regime, including The Dragon Whisker 
Drain (1951), which was about the construction of Bei- 
jing’s new sewage system, and The Teahouse (1957) 
which has been widely performed in Europe. During 
the last twenty-seven years of his life Lao She wrote 
some forty plays, operettas and musicals as well as a 
number of historical and literary essays. 
Lao She’s death was as tragic as it was unexpected. In 
August 1966 he became one of the first victims of the long 
period of disorders that ravaged China for some ten 
years. He will be remembered asa man of the people who 
made the people laugh, and through their laughter 
understand the deeper meaning of the world around 
them. nH

### 51810: The Changing Chinese family

  
The changin 
Chinese fami 
by Fei Xiaotong 
T HE family is the basic unit of 
Chinese society. The changes 
which are ‘taking place in its 
structure are an integral part of the far- 
reaching social transformation that China 
has experienced in the last thirty years. 
When Western sociologists talk about 
the family, they are usually referring to 
what they call the nuclear family, con- 
sisting of husband, wife and children— 
the typical profile of the family in Western 
societies. In China the notion of the family 
is broader; it designates an extended 
group whichis based on the nuclear fami- 
ly and may include as a basic social unit 
three or four generations living together 
and even distant relations. 
The small nuclear family of husband, wife and children is an increasingly common pattern 
in China's cities.

Inthe pastit was generally thought that 
the great majority of Chinese families 
were ‘‘big families’”” or ‘‘associated 
families’’ grouping several generations. 
This impression may have been due to the 
influence of novels and plays, such as 
Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Flag, Ba 
Jin's Family and Cao Yu's The Storm, 
which are set in this type of family. 
It is true that in old China the rules of 
‘family piety and fraternal duty’’ acted as 
a check on the disintegration of the family 
and the independence of its members. 
Feudal morality required that sons and 
daughters should unconditionally obey 
parents and brothers, and a family in 
which five generations lived together 
constituted a social ideal. But in reality 
"big families’” were far from being the 
majority in China. 
In my book Peasant Life in China, 
published in 1938, | noted that the 
average Chinese family then consisted of 
from four to six members. The same fact 
emerged from a study of a village near 
Lake Tai, carried out at a forty-five-year 
interval, in 1936 and 1981. | also stress- 
ed in this study that the peasant 
economy, then usually practised on a 
small scale, was ill-adapted to the struc- 
ture of a big family. Although they were 
influenced by traditional morality, the 
peasants had to break up the family unit 
for economic reasons such as the division 
of the land into smallholdings, as well as 
for internal family reasons. Thus a father 
would often divide the family property 
and live with his elder son. When the elder 
son married and a new member joined the 
family, a clash between mother-in-law 
and daughter-in-law would often cause 
the family to split up permanently. 
Elderly peasants still remember the 
times when many families were broken 
up by poverty and discord. Before the 
Liberation, even in the Suzhou-Hangzhou 
region which was considered an “’earthly 
paradise’, peasant families included 
many widowers, widows, orphans, and 
men and women abandoned by their 
"wives and sons, who lived in extreme 
destitution. 
Although the data are incomplete, it 
seems clear that the number of 
“associated families’” was relatively 
higher among the richer city-dwellers and 
landed proprietors. This was because 
financial resources were concentrated in 
the hands of the head of the family, accor- 
ding to the customary practice of the 
feudal and paternalistic landed proprietor 
class. Among the working people of the 
towns and cities, as among the peasants, 
the proportion of nuclear families was 
growing. 
From a strictly sociological viewpoint, 
four categories of family may be 
distinguished: 
1) Incomplete nuclear families from 
which the husband or wife is absent, for 
one reason or another or in which unmar- 
ried orphans live together. This type of 
FEI XIAOTONG is president of the Chinese 
Sociology Association and director of the In- 
stitute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences.

### 51810: The Changing Chinese family

Although its structure is 
changing, the family is still 
the basic social unit in 
modern China. Help from 
elderly parents or parents-in- 
law enables the couple to 
work outside the home. 
Right, three generations of

family is unstable and is considered 
abnormal. 
2) Nuclear families, or small families, 
consisting of husband, wife and their un- 
married children. 
3) Extended families consisting of the 
nuclear family and its satellites, usually 
the widowed father or mother, but 
sometimes including distant kinsfolk and 
even persons unrelated to the family. 
4) ‘Associated families’ or big 
families consisting of two orthree nuclear 
families. In most cases the associated 
family consists of two overlapping 
generations, but a variant exists in the 
form of nuclear families created by 
brothers and sisters living under the same 
roof. 
On the basis of this kind of classifica- 
tion, the situation of the village we in- 
vestigated in 1936 and 1981 is as 
follows: 
1936 1981 
27.6% 18.1% 
23.7% 39 % 
38.4% 21.6% 
10.3% 21.3% 
Incomplete families 
Nuclear families 
Extended families 
Associated families 
During these forty-five years, the 
village underwent profound changes cor- 
responding to the transformation of a 
feudal or semi-feudal society into a 
socialist regime. The table above shows 
that in 1981 nuclear families 
predominated, accounting for nearly 40 
per cent of the total, whereas the number 
of extended families had dropped to little 
more than 20 per cent. The number of in- 
complete families had also dropped while 
the number of associated families had 
doubled. 
Several factors have modified the fami- 
ly structure. In a society in which the 
means of production have become the 
property of the community, the head of 
the family no longer has the power to con- 
trol the distribution of wealth by virtue of 
his exclusive possession of land and other 
means of production, as he did under the 
old patriarchal system. Work in common 
in the production brigades, the balancing 
out of incomes, affinities, and the hous- 
ing problem are enough to explain the in- 
crease in the percentage of ‘associated 
families’’, often to the detriment of the 
extended family. 
But one of the major reasons for this 
change is the big increase in the number 
of elderly people. In the village studied, 
there were ninety-four persons over the 
age of sixty in 1936. In 1981 there were 
195. Thus theimprovement in health care 
and living conditions has produced a 
situation in which the elderly are far more 
numerous than before but often just as 
dependent on their children, and have 
contributed to the enlargement of the 
nuclear family, even transformingitinto a 
big associated family. Today children are 
legally obliged to support their parents 
who can no longer work. 
The standard of living of the village has 
risen distinctly since before the war, part- 
ly due to the establishment of factories. It 
is thus not surprising that the number of 
nuclear families has risen. Nevertheless, 
housing problems have not yet been en- 
tirely solved, and they play a major role in 
the rise in the percentage of ‘‘big 
families’’, even if the latter are not the 
same as the patriarchal clans of former 
times. Thus, although the percentage of 
incomplete families decreased by a third 
between 1936 and 1981, 78 out of 850 
men in 1981 were single. Young men 
looking for a wife, widowers or divorcees, 
these single men found it very difficult to 
marry, notably because of the housing 
shortage. Some of them have joined ex- 
tended families and helped to transform 
them into associated families. 
In extended families or large associated 
families, there are tensions quite different 
from those caused by the aggressive 
authoritarianism of the head of the clan. 
These too are largely due to housing pro- 
blems. Almost half the families in the 
village studied have tried to cushion the 
impact of these difficulties by the practice 
of fen zao, cooking apart: mother-in-law 
and daughter-in-law live together but 
cook separately. 
Other tensions may arise from certain 
changes in the status of women, Women 
who work in the production brigades or in 
the factories which have been set up in 
the village are paid their wages directly. 
Although they usually hand over their ear- 
nings to the head of the family, these 
women now have a certain freedom as to 
how they spend their money. Many 
young village women deduct the cost of a 
permanent wave from their earnings 
before handing them over to the head of 
the family, evenif this practice is frowned 
on by their elders. These are the Chinese 
peasant woman's first steps towards 
economic independence. 
When this independence is more 
strongly asserted, it may exacerbate con- 
flicts between the generations and pro- 
voke clashes. It sometimes happens, for 
example, that the mother-in-law prefers 
to live alone, aided by her son who makes 
her a monthly allowance. 
On the other hand, especially in the 
towns, when the two members of the 
basic couple work, the presence of the 
parents-in-law, or at least that of the 
mother-in-law, in the home is often 
warmly welcomed for although many 
kindergartens and creches have been set 
up near the factories, society's needs in 
this sphere are still far from being fully 
met. By looking after the small children, 
the parents-inlaw allow the couple to 
work outside the home. In this respect the 
extended family, far from breaking up, 
tightens its links and becomes a solid 
nucleus. [|

Over the centuries, the interplay of cultures between China and the West expressed itself in many, often surprising ways. Above, the 
ruins of an extraordinary Sino-Rococo edifice in the Yuanmingyuan, a vast garden in the northwest suburbs of Beijing. It was designed 
by the Italian Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione {1698-1768} who was a painter and functionary at the Qing imperial court where he was known 
as Lang Shi-ning. The white marble building is carved with European motifs but the tiled roof and other features were typically Chinese. 


### 51812: Chinese civilization and the West

Chinese civilization 
and the West 
cultural contacts between Europe 
and Asia reached their zenith during 
the second century AD. At that time the 
Silk Road and its western connexions, the 
vital trade link between East and West, 
stretched some 12,000 kilometres 
across the known world from Xian to 
Gades (modern Cadiz) on the Atlantic 
Ocean. Along it, from East to West, 
travelled Chinese silk, Arabian incense, 
precious stones, muslin and spices from 
India. In the other direction went glass, 
copper, tin, lead, red coral, textiles, pot- 
tery and currency. 
I N the ancient world economic and 
Caravans had been making the long 
journey regularly from about 106 BC 
following the epic explorations of Zhang 
Qian, who had been sent by the Emperor 
ZHANG KAI js an assistant research fellow in 
the Office of Relations between China and 
Other Countries in the History Institute of the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He is the 
author of a number of studies, notably on 
themes connected with relations between 
China and Latin America, He has translated 
works of Latin American history into Chinese, 
and is currently writing a history of Chinese 
emigrants in America.

Wudi as ambassador to the ancient 
Yuezhi people in Bactria. It was from 
about this time that regular supplies of 
silk began to flow to the West, and China 
became known to Europeans as ‘’Serica’’ 
{the land of silk). Virgil, the great Roman 
epic poet, who was bornin 70 BC, wrote 
apoem in praise of silk which he imagined 
as being combed from the leaves of trees. 
While the camels were plodding heavy 
laden along the Silk Road, a new marine 
route was being developed. In about 
100 BC a Greek ship's captain named 
Hippalos discovered that use could be 
made of the monsoon winds to make 
rapid direct sea voyages from the Red Sea 
to the Indian ports of Barbaricum, 
Barygaza and Muziris, where Chinese 
goods could be obtained from Indian 
merchants. 
The sea route was safer and more 
economical and sea-borne trade between 
East and West grew rapidly reaching un- 
precedented heights during the Tang 
(618-906 AD), the Song (960-1279 AD) 
and the Yuan (1260-1368 AD) 
dynasties. The seven missions to the 
“Western Oceans’’ undertaken by the 
famous admiral Zheng He, between 
1405 and 1433 AD undoubtedly gave a 
further fillip to Chinese sea-borne trade. 
The period of the Tang dynasty also 
saw the spectacular rise of Islam, the 
great new power that was to affect 
East— West relations so profoundly. The 
first Arab embassy to China took place in 
651 BC and the conquest of Persia in 
652 BC brought Arab domination to the 
frontiers of Chinese influence. Arabs 
began to play an extremely important role 
as a medium of cultural and commercial 
exchange between East and West. It was 
through the Arabs that ancient Chinese 
inventions such as the compass, paper- 
making, printing and gunpowder were in- 
troduced to Europe. 
Chinese porcelain predominated in 
trade by the "Marine Silk Road.”’ From 
the Song dynasty onwards Chinese 
porcelain was introduced throughout 
south-east Asia, the Indian sub- 
continent, Arabia and the eastern coastal 
regions of Africa, and from the sixteenth 
century onwards it reached Europe and 
even America. 
Also during the sixteenth century 
Chinese lacquerware began to reach 
Europe in considerable quantity, its vivid

patterns and exquisite colourings arous- 
ing astonishment and admiration. By the 
end of the seventeenth century French 
craftsmen at the Gobelins factory in Paris 
were producing imitations which were 
known as ouvrage a la Chine which re- 
tained the characteristic elements of the 
Chinese style. 
Chinese painting, handicraft, sculpture 
and architecture may all be said to have 
made a decisive contribution to the 
development of the eighteenth century 
European style which came to be known 
as rococo. The influence of Chinese ar- 
chitectural styles can be seenin a number 
of €uropean imperial palaces and the 
traditional Chinese arch-shaped roofs and 
upturned eaves were often successfully 
transferred. 
Chinese-style garden layouts were also 
highly popular in the West. With their ap- 
parently random arrangements of lakes, 
mounds, artificial rocks, pavilions, 
towers, winding paths, pagodas, they 
broke away from the symmetrical, 
stereotyped gardens of Europe. The 
Chinese influence is still strongly evident 
at Kew Gardens, near London, one of the 
most famous gardens in England. 
Another Chinese export which was to 
have a profound influence on European, 
especially English, social life was tea. 
Originating in the China of antiquity, tea 
cultivation and the tea-drinking habit 
spread first to Japan and Korea and then 
throughout Asia. By the seventeenth cen- 
tury tea, then considered a great luxury, 
was being drunk in England and America. 
Today in England tea is an indispensable 
adjunct of daily life in all social classes and 
the English now consume about a fifth of 
the world’s total tea production. 
Material goods were not, however, the 
only Chinese exports to travel the trade 
routes. Unseen among the bales of silk, 
crates of tea and porcelain came a wealth 
of spiritual, philosophical, economic and 
on 
— Y = — eT =

educational ideas whose impact on the 
West was to be profound. 
In the first half of the fourteenth cen- 
tury descriptions of their travels to China 
by the merchant adventurer Marco Polo 
(1254-1324) and the franciscan friar 
Odoric of Pordenone (1286-1331) arous- 
ed European curiosity about the myste- 
rious ‘‘gigantic dragon of the East’’ of 
which they spoke. But it was not until the 
turn of the sixteenth century that a clear 
picture of Chinese thought began to 
emerge. 
From the middle of the sixteenth cen- 
tury, missionaries were sent in suc- 
cessive groups to China from the Western 
world. Some, like the Jesuit missionary 
Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) adopted 
Confucian-style clothes, learned the 
Chinese language, studied the Chinese 
classics and established close contact 
with senior officials and the élite of socie- - 
ty, even gaining admittance to the im- 
perial court. Their deepening understan- 
ding of China and their admiration for its 
highly developed civilization are reflected 
in the reports they sent back to the 
Vatican on politics, economy, culture and 
art and daily life and customs in China. 
In 1585 the Historia de las Cosas més 
Notables, Usos y Costumbres del gran 
Reyno de la China (History of the Great 
Empire of China), compiled by the 
Spanish missionary Juan Gonzalez de 
Mendoza (1540-1617), was published in 
Rome. It was immediately translated in 
several European languages and widely 
circulated, arousing enormous interest in 
things Chinese. During the eighteenth 
century works concerning China pro- 
liferated. They included Edifying and 
Curious Letters, published in thirty-four 
volumes, a General History of China, in 
thirteen volumes, and Memoirs on the 
History, Sciences, Arts, etc. of the 
Chinese, in sixteen volumes. 
These publications raised European in-

These ideograms (above, dong or east; below, 
mian or face) were inscribed ona Chinese stela 
(a slab or pillar of stone used for com- 
memorative purposes) to indicate the direction 
in which the monument faced. While travelling 
in China on an archaeological mission, the 
French poet and physician Victor Segalen 
(1878-1919) was struck by these ‘“‘monu- 
ments reduced to the form of a tall stone table 
bearing an inscription’’. In his book Stéles 
(1912), Segalen wrote: ‘‘This space riven by 
points, penetrated by the nine firmaments, 
who surrounds and contains it? Beyond the 
confines is the Extreme, and then the Great 
Void, and then what lies beyond?’’ 
mersed themselves in the study of 
Chinese philosophy, politics, economics, 
pedagogics, state systems, military 
ideology and strategy, literature, art, 
garden landscaping and social customs. 
In the field of philosophy, Confucianism 
in particular captured the attention of Euro- 
pean philosophers. Confucius’ teachings, 
as contained in the Sishu (Four Books) and 
the Wujing (Five Classics), had been 
translated into Latin by Matteo Ricci and 
the Jesuit missionary Niklaas Trigault. 
Later, other works on Confucianism and 
the Confucian school of idealist philosophy 
of the Song dynasty were introduced to 
Europe and Confucius came to be revered 
as alearned prophet and amaster of ethics 
and political philosophy. 
The principle of Li (propriety), con- 
sidered by the Confucian school of 
idealist philosophy of the Song dynasty 
as the supreme law, appealed greatly to 
many European philosophers, especially 
those with anti-religious tendencies. 
Gottfried Leibniz, the eminent German 
philosopher, was one of the first in Europe 
to recognize the significance of Chinese 
thought for Western culture. For some 
time he devoted himself to the study of 
Chinese philosophical ideology and he 
had a wide interest in all things Chinese. 
He maintained that if China could send 
people to Europe to give guidance in ‘‘the p

» aims and practice of natural theology'’, it 
would revitalize the decadent and corrupt 
ethics of Europe. He also gave much time 
to the establishment of a scientific socie- 
ty in Berlin to promote cultural exchanges 
between Europe and China. 
The French writer Voltaire, a leading 
figure of the Age of Enlightenment, also 
had a high respect for Chinese 
philosophy. He maintained that the 
Chinese people had all the virtues and 
were in advance in many branches of 
learning. 
The great Russian writer and thinker 
Leo Tolstoy found that he had many ideas 
in common with the philosophy of Laozi 
and at one time he even planned to 
translate the Daode jing (The Supreme 
Way of Life) into Russian. 
During the eighteenth century, Chinese 
influence was also felt in the field of 
economics. Francois Quesnay, the 
French economist who founded the 
physiocratic school of economic thought 
and who proclaimed that laissez-faire in 
economics followed natural law and ad- 
vocated an economy based on 
agriculture, drew heavily on Chinese ex- 
perience. In his book On China's 
Autocracy, he wrote that the ‘natural 
law’’ was the "‘legislative foundation of 
mankind’’ and the ‘‘supreme norm of 
human behaviour.” He pointed out sor- 
rowfully that this law was neglected 
everywhere except in China and declared 
that the Chinese system of government 
should become an example to be 
emulated by all European countries. His 
advocacy of Confucianism and Chinese 
thought earned for him the sobriquet of 
‘the Confucius of Europe.’’ 
A number of European scholars of the 
Age of Enlightenment considered the 
educational system of feudal China to be 
a model to be followed. The eighteenth 
century German professor of theology 
Christian Wolff greatly admired the grad- 
ed educational system in China in which 
there were separate schools for children 
and adults. He maintained that this 
system coincided with the natural law of 
the human spirit. 
Schools in China not only taught their 
students reading and writing skills, they 
also gave them lessons in ethics and in- 
structed them in methods of acquiring 
knowledge. 
In military affairs the Chinese classic 
Bing-fa (The Art of War), written by Sunzi 
in the fourth century BC and a book with 
which Napoleon Bonaparte was familiar, 
had a considerable effect on the forma- 
tion of military ideology in Europe and on 
the application of military strategy and 
tactics in war. 
In the literature and art of the West the 
influence of Chinese civilization can 
similarly be seen. Some experts maintain 
that the well-known Western fairy tale 
Cinderella is a variation of a legendary 
story in You Yang Za Zu, written by Duan 
Chengshi in the time of the Tang dynasty. 
A Chinese classic play An Orphan of 
Zhaos, was translated into English, Italian 
and French. It was re-written by Voltaire 
as a five-act play called The Chinese Or- 
phan, in which Confucian ethics were 
described. Some scholars maintain that 
the great Goethe's unfinished play 
Elpenor was inspired by An Orphan of 
Zhaos. 
It should not, however, be forgotten 
that the interplay between China and the 
West was a two-way affair. While the in- 
fluence of the rich heritage of ancient 
China was pervading the West, the ad- 
vanced science and technology of the 
West and its philosophical and artistic 
ideas were in turn being absorbed in 
China, thus cementing the bonds of 
friendship and understanding between 
two of the great civilizations of the world.

### IGNORE

The African encounter 
On his return to Chang-an, the capital of China under the 
Han dynasty, after a mission to the “Western Regions” 
(a term which designated the area west of Yumenguan, including 
what us now Xinjiang and parts of central Asia) Zhang Qian men- 
tioned in his report to Emperor Wudi that he had heard of a place 
in the West called Ligian. Contemporary scholars have confirmed 
that Liqian was none other than Alexandria, in Egypt. 
At that time Egypt was under the rule of the Roman Empire and 
Alexandria was the communications centre for Asia, Africa and 
Europe. The largest metropolis in the Western world, it enjoyed 
great commercial prosperity. Legend has it that Cleopatra, Queen 
of Egypt, wore robes made of Chinese silk brought to Egypt along 
the Silk Road. 
The reign of Emperor Wudi also saw the establishment of a 
flourishing sea-borne trade between China and India and a sea 
route was opened up between India and the Roman Empire. Ac- 
cording to Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Em- 
pire about 120 trading ships left Egypt every year bound for India 
and Sri Lanka. Chinese silk and other commodities were carried 
via India to Alexandria and thence across the Mediterranean to 
Rome. 
The Tang, Song and Yuan dynasties saw an uprecedented 
development of sea-borne trade between East and West. Under the 
Tang dynasty, China’s merchant ships, some reputed to have five- 
storey forecastles, sailed as far as the Gulf. Under the Song dynas- 
ty, Chinese shipbuilding techniques further improved. Zhou 
Qufei, a twelfth-century Chinese scholar, described the Chinese 
C HINESE contact with Africa dates back to ancient times. ocean-going merchant ships of his day as ‘‘capable of carrying 
several hundred people, with food supplies that could last a year 
and even with pigs kept and wine made on board”. 
Exceptionally well rigged and navigated by compass, these ships 
were particularly suitable for long, ocean-going voyages. In 1433, 
on the last of his seven famous missions to the West during the 
Ming dynasty, Admiral Zheng He led a huge fleet with as many as 
-27,000 men aboard, reaching as far as the mouth of the Red Sea 
and the coast of East Africa. 
The Admiral’s voyages raised China’s overseas trade to a new 
high. Chinese porcelain became popular in East Africa. In his 
book The Rediscovery of Ancient Africa Basil Davidson notes that 
some princes and merchants in East Africa had Chinese porcelain 
ornaments in their homes and drank tea from porcelain cups. 
.Chinese porcelain fragments have been found in Tanzania and an- 
cient Chinese coins have been unearthed in Mogadishu, Brava, 
Mafia Island and Kilwa Island. 
In North Africa, Chinese cargoes were shipped to Egypt through 
the Red Sea and then transported to Morocco for sale. Chinese 
paper-making techniques were introduced to Egypt in 900 and to 
Morocco in 1100. In the tenth century Chinese printing techniques 
became known in Egypt and were used in printing the Qur’an. 
Since Chinese gunpowder was introduced to Egypt in the latter 
half of the thirteenth century nitre has been known to the Egyp- 
tians as ‘“‘Chinese snow.”’ 
Thus Chinese products were introduced to Africa at about the 
same time as they reached Europe and the contacts between China 
and Africa were perhaps closer and more direct. [|

The why of the needle 
The story of acupuncture and moxa 
by Joseph Needham 
  
JOSEPH NEEDHAM, world-famous British 
historian of Chinese science, is director of the 
East Asian History of Science Library at Cam- 
bridge. For more than forty years he has been 
engaged on a monumental, multi-volume 
history of Science and Civilization in China of 
which he is the director and principal con- 
tributor. The present article has been taken 
from his latest work Science in Traditional 
China, published by the Chinese University 
Fress, Hong Kong, in 1981.

CUPUNCTURE and moxa, as 
everybody knows, are two 
of the most ancient and 
characteristic therapeutic tech- 
niques of Chinese medicine. 
Acupuncture can be defined broadly 
as the implantation of thin needles to 
different depths at a great variety of 
points on the surface of the human 
body — points gathered in connected 
arrays according to a highly 
systematized pattern with a com- 
plex and sophisticated, if still essen- 
- tially medieval, physiological theory 
behind it. The classical theory was 
-w 
\ 
based on conceptions, still of great 
interest today, of a continuous cir- 
culation of qi (the “primordial 
breath’’} and Xue {blood} around the 
body. 
Moxa consists of the burning of 
Artemisia tinder, ai, either in the 
form of incense-like cones, whether 
or not laid directly on the skin, or a 
cigar-shaped stick held just above it. 
The points chosen for application are 
in general identical with those of the 
acupuncture system. Depending 
upon the degree of heat there can be

either a mild thermal stimulus, like a 
fomentation, or alternatively a 
powerful counter-irritant cautery. 
Very broadly speaking, the acupunc- 
ture technique was from ancient 
times onward thought most valuable 
in acute diseases, while the moxa 
was considered more appropriate in 
chronic ones, and even for pro- 
phylactic purposes too. 
Now, acupuncture as a method of 
therapy, including sedation and 
analgesia, involving the implantation 
of needles, first developed during 
the Zhou period, in the 1st millen- 
nium. Today the needles are very 
thin, much thinner than the familiar 
hypodermic needles. Implantation 
into the body was made at different 
places at precisely specified points 
according to a charted scheme, 
based on ancient physiological 
ideas. The theory and the practice 
were, one finds, well established 
already, well systematized, in fact, 
in the 2nd century BC, though much 
development followed. The tech- 
  
  
nique remains in universal use in 
China and in all Chinese communities 
at the present day. 
The classical view of the circula- 
tion of the gi was that it passed 
through a network of channels round 
and round the body. This was the 
jingluo system, an arrangement of 
what we call acu-tracts and acujunc- 
tions, twelve main tracts, and eight 
auxiliary tracts, the famous qi jing ba 
mo. Each of these tracts contains 
anything from ten to fifty acu-points 
(as we call them), the shu xue, at 
which the needles are implanted or 
over which the moxa is burnt. But 
besides the jingluo system of acu- 
tracts there is also the jing mo 
system, which we translate as the 
‘‘tract-and-channel network sys- 
tem,” involving not only the circula- 
tion of gi in the tracts but also the 
circulation of blood in the blood 
vessels. It is extremely interesting to 
know that the idea of circulation ex- 
isted so clearly and so long before 
the demonstration of the blood cir- 
culation by Sir William Harvey in his 
De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in 
Animalibus of 1628. 
The cardinal importance of the 
system of acupuncture in the history 
of Chinese medicine is not denied by 
anyone, but its actual value in objec- 
“tive terms remained until recently, 
and to some extent still does remain, 
the subject of great differences of 
opinion. For example, you can find in 
various countries in East Asia 
modern-trained physicians, both 
Chinese and Occidental, who are 
sceptical about its value, but on the 
whole in China they are rather few, 
and the vast majority of medical men 
there, according to our experience, 
both modern-trained and traditional, 
do believe in its capacity to cure, or 
at least to alleviate, many 
pathological conditions. 
The whole subject took a rather 
dramatic turn during the past fifteen 
years on account of the successes 
achieved in China in the application of 
acupuncture for analgesia in major 
surgery. Here there is no long and tor- 
tuous medical history to be followed 
up, no periods of remission or acute 
relapse, no chronic conditions with 
uncertain responses, no psycho- 
somatic guesswork. Either the pa- 
tient feels intolerable pain from the 
surgical intervention, or he does not, 
and the effectiveness can be known 
within the hour, or even sooner. More 
than any other development, this 
acupuncture analgesia {or anaes- 
thesia, as it has often been called 
with undeniable but infelicitous logic) 
has had the effect of obliging physi- 
cians and neurophysiologists in other 
parts of the world to take Chinese 
medicine seriously. 
One view commonly expressed 
{mainly by Westerners) is that 
acupuncture has acted primarily by 
suggestion, like many other things in 
what they often call ‘‘fringe 
medicine,’’ and some do not hesitate 
to equate surgical acupuncture 
analgesia with hypno-anaesthesia. 
It is quite clear that in terms of 
neurophysiology the acupuncture 
needles stimulate various receptors 
at different depths, which send their 
afferent impulses up the spinal cord 
and into the brain. Perhaps they trig- 
ger events in the hypothalamus 
which activate the pituitary gland and 
lead to an increase of cortisone pro- 
duction by the suprarena! cortex, or 
perhaps they stimulate the automatic 
nervous system in such a way as to 
lead to an increased output of anti- 
bodies from the reticulo-endothelial 
system. Both these effects would be 
of great importance from the 
therapeutic point of view, and in fact 
they are among the leading theories 
used at the present day to explain the 
therapeutic effects of acupuncture. 
In a way, it is easier to explain the 
analgesic effect than the therapeutic 
effect, but of course if cortisone pro- 
duction and the things allied with it 
arereally stirred up by acupuncture or 
if antibody outputisincreased by it, it 
would be easy to see that acupunc- 
ture therapy could have been of enor- 
mous value, even in diseases such as 
typhoid and cholera where we know 
perfectly well the causative invading 
organism. On the other hand, in 
another situation, the needles may 
monopolize afferent input junctions 
in the thalamus, medulla, or spinal 
cord, in such a way as to prevent all 
pain impulses getting through to the 
cortex regions of the brain, thereby 
successfully inducing analgesia. >

### 51814: The Why of the needle: the story of acupuncture and moxa

p» Furthermore, there is no question 
that acupuncture analgesia is con- 
nected in some way, we do not yet 
know exactly how, with the opioid 
peptides of the brain. It was one of 
the most exciting and fascinating 
discoveries of the last five years, that 
our own brains manufacture 
substances known as enkephalins 
and endorphins. Enkephalins and en- 
dorphins are very powerful 
analgesics, and they are made in our 
own brains, so here is another way in 
which you can see how the acupunc- 
ture needles at the periphery could 
stimulate neurons to fire off and 
release these highly powerful 
enkephalins or endorphins. 
Something remains to be said 
about the theoretical setting of 
acupuncture and other Chinese tradi- 
tional methods, such as the medical 
gymnastics which are so important in 
China. Here | am talking about the 
relative value placed in Chinese and 
Western medicine respectively on aid 
to the healing and protective power 
of the body, on the one hand, as 
against direct attacks on invading in- 
fluences, on the other. In both 
Western medicine and Chinese 
medicine these two concepts are to 
be found. In the West, besides the 
seemingly dominant idea of direct at- 
tack on the pathogen, we also have 
the idea of the vis medicatrix naturae, 
the natural healing power of the body 
and the strengthening of resistance 
to disease which comes right down 
from the time of Hippocrates and 
Galen. 
Moxa, or moxibustion, is another tradi- 
tional Chinese pain-relieving practice 
that has since spread to other coun- 
tries. Small cones of dried leaves are 
burned on specific points of the body, 
as shown in the 18th-century docu- 
ment at right. The term moxa is derived 
from the name of the wormwood plant 
most frequently used, Artemisia moxa.

In China, where the holistic ap- 
proach might have been thought to 
dominate, there was also the idea of 
combating external disease agents, 
whether these were malign or sinister 
pneumata, the xie gi, from outside, of 
unknown nature, or distinct venoms 
or toxins left behind wheninsects had 
been crawling over food. That was a 
very old conception in China. So the 
attack on external agents was cer- 
tainly present in Chinese medical 
thought too. The other one, the vis 
medicatrix naturae was surely largely 
what the Taoists meant in China by 
yang sheng, the nourishment of life 
and the strengthening of it against 
disease. 
It is fairly clear that whatever the 
acupuncture procedure does, it must 
be along the lines of strengthening 
the patient's resistance and not 
directly fighting invading organisms — 
that is, not the characteristic ‘‘an- 
tiseptic’’ technique which has 
naturally dominated in the West since 
the origin of modern bacteriology. In 
this connexion, it is a significant fact 
that while Westerners are often 
prepared to grant value to acupunc- 
ture in things like sciatica or lumbago, 
for which modern Western medicine 
can do very little anyway, Chinese 
physicians have never been prepared 
to limit either acupuncture or moxa to 
such conditions; on the contrary they 
have recommended it and practised it 
in treating many diseases for which 
we all now believe we know the 
organisms (like typhoid and cholera), 
  
  
and they have claimed at least remis- 
sions if not radical cures. 
In addition, there was a third idea, 
which sprang from the idea of 
balance or krasis. The idea was as 
much Chinese as it was Greek. It 
viewed disease as essentially a 
malfunction or imbalance, one or the 
other component entity in the body 
having unnaturally gained the lead 
over the others. Since the develop- 
ment of modern endocrinology, this 
conception has taken a new lease on 
life, butit was present from the begin- 
ning in both civilizations. European 
bloodletting and purging was a direct 
if crude result of it, because it was 
thought that ‘‘peccant humours’ - 
had to be got rid of; but in China a 
defective balance between Yin and 
Yang, or deviant relationships bet- 
ween the Five Elements, were 
generally diagnosed and altered in a 
more subtle way. Acupuncture was 
the first court of appeal here again. 
We have little doubt that many in- 
terventions of that kind did return the 
living human body withits nerves and 
hormones to a more even keel, 
though exactly how the medieval 
physicians visualized the interplay of 
the two great forces always remains 
rather difficult for us to understand in 
our time. ’ 
The universal reproach directed 
against therapeutic acupuncture by 
modern scientific medicine is the lack 
of statistical evidence. The absence 
of adequate clinical 
periments, 
control ex- 
the existence of the

placebo effect, and the relative pauci- 
ty of quantitative remission and 
follow-up data in contemporary 
China are hindrances, of course, but 
let no one say that the Chinese were 
unaware of the possibilities of spon- 
taneous recoveries and remissions. 
There is a passage in the Zhou Li 
which talks about the official physi- 
cians of theimperial government. The 
Zhou Li is a treatise written in early 
Han times about the kind of govern- 
ment bureaucratic organization 
which ought to have existed in the 
Zhou period, even if it never did. It 
was a kind of system of the ideal 
government organization. Speaking 
of the Yi Shi, the chief medical officer 
of the imperial government, it said: 
“The Yi Shi is in charge of the whole 
medical administration of the coun- 
try, and he collects all efficacious 
drugs for the purpose of healing 
diseases. All those suffering from ex- 
ternal maladies, whether of the head 
or body, are treated separately by ap- 
propriate specialists. At the end of 
the year he uses the records of each 
physician to decide on his rank and 
salary. Those who have cured 100 % 
of their patients are graded in the first 
class, those who have had 90 % 
recoveries are in the second class, 
those who have been 80 % suc- 
cessful are placed third, those who

have cured 70 % are considered 
fourth class, and the lowest grade of 
all contains those who could not cure 
more than 60 %.”" Then the com- 
mentator in the 2nd century AD, 
Zheng Kang-Cheng, has a fascinating 
commentary in which he says that 
"the reason why those who failed 
with four out of ten patients were 
placed in the lowest grade was 
because half of the cases might well 
have recovered anyway, even 
without any treatment at all.”” This 
text implies clearly the keeping of 
clinical records, and the comment 
seems to us an admirable example of 
the scepticism and critical mentality 
of the scholars of ancient China. 
When one looks back, one sees 
how great was the medical literature 
concerning acupuncture and moxa 
which grew up in China through the 
centuries. Many matters of absorbing 
interest arise as one looks through it. 
For example, first of all there was the 
deep conviction of Chinese scholars 
and physicians about the circulation 
of gi and blood in the body, determin- 
ing a rate of flow only sixty times 
slower than that which modern 
physiologists since Harvey have 
recognized, and that with a priority of 
about two thousand years. Then 
there was the discovery of the 
viscero-cutaneous reflexes, the con- 
nexions of many parts of the body's 
surface with events occurring in the 
internal organs. Then, too, there was 
something have not spoken of at all, 
the appreciation of diurnal or circa- 
dian rhythms, and longer biological 
rhythms in man, and the develop- 
ment of an abstruse calculus on the 
basis of this to determine when 
acupuncture and moxa should best 
be performed. Finally there was the 
development of a very interesting 
module system for locating acu- 
points in human bodies of different 
sizes and proportions. 
There have been a number of 
misunderstandings inthe West about 
acupuncture and moxa. They have 
nothing whatsoever to do with para- 
psychology, occult influences, or 
psychic powers, and consequently 
do not deserve the praises of those 
who believe in such things. They do 
not depend entirely on suggestion, 
nor on hypnotic phenomena at all, 
and they are not contradictory of 
modern scientific medicine. Conse- 
quently they do not deserve the 
odium theologicum of the medical 
profession in the West. Acupuncture 
with moxa is simply a system of 
medical treatment which was already 
two thousand years old when modern 
science was born, and which has 
developed in a civilization quite dif- 
ferent from that of Europe. Today the 
explanations of its actions are being 
soughtinterms of modernphysiology 
and pathology. Great advances have 
been made already in this direction 
though the end is not yet in sight. It 
looks as if the physiology and 
biochemistry of the central and 
automic nervous systems will be the 
leading elements in our understand- 
ing, but many other systems, 
biochemical, neurochemical, en- 
docrinological, and immunological 
are sure to be involved. 
Another problem of great interests 
the exact nature of the acu-points in 
terms of histology and biophysics. 
Since modern science did not spon- 
taneously grow upin Chinese culture, 
acupuncture and moxa are tradi- 
tionally based upon a theoretical 
system essentially medieval in 
character, though very sophisticated 
and subtle, indeed full of valuable in- 
sights and salutary lessons for 
modern scientific medicine. Again, 
the exact reinterpretation and refor- 
mulation of these theories, if such a 
thing is possible, will be a difficult 
matter for the future. However, we 
think it likely that in the oecumenical 
medicine of the coming years there 
will be a definite place for acupunc- 
ture both in therapy and in analgesia. 
Exactly how far this willbe so, itis too 
early to say. BM Joseph Needham

The General History of Africa 
Coming after the History of Mankind: Cultural 
and Scientific Development, the General 
History of Africa is currently Unesco’s most 
important publishing project. Almost 240 
distinguished writers from many countries are 
collaborating in this exceptional work, whichis 
being produced under the intellectual and 
scientific responsibility of a 39-member inter- 
national scientific committee, two-thirds of 
whose members are African, and the remain- 
ing third specialists from other world cultural 
regions. The work will provide a panoramic ap- 
proach to the African continent. It should make 
it possible, through the vision it presents of the 
past, to understand Africa as it is today. 
The first two volumes are currently available in 
English and French, and the first volume has 
just been published in Spanish and Por- 
tuguese. Initially Unesco intended that the 
eight-volume work should have been publish- 
ed in its entirety before the end of 1983. 
However, as preparation of the History has 
proceeded it has become apparent that an ex- 
tension is necessary in order to permit the pro- 
duction of a finished work of authoritative 
scientific quality which would respond to the 
hopes of the international community. Conse- 
quently it has been necessary to modify the 
publication timetable of the different volumes 
in such a way that the entire work will be 
available to the public at the end of 1985. 
Unesco hopes that individuals and institu- 
tions interested inthe General History of Africa 
will understand its position and will excuse this 
delay. 
The UNESCO COURIER is published monthly (11
