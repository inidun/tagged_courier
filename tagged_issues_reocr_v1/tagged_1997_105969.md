### 105954: The Liberating power of words

Aimé Césaire, who was born in Martinique in 1913, is one of this century's major 
writers. In his poetry, plays and political activities he has waged a lifelong strug- 
gle to restore dignity to colonized peoples. Firstand foremost a poet, here he 
talks to Annick Thebia Melsan about his faith in the power of words. 
BM The usual way of trying to place you is by reference to 
various things such as time and place, writing, poetry 
and its different categories, political action and so on, 
but how would you place yourself? 
Aimé Césaire: That's a terribly difficult ques- 
tion to answer but, well, ’'m a man, a man {from 
Martinique, a coloured man, a black, someone 
from a particular country, from a particular geo- 
graphical background, someone with a history 
who has fought lor a specific cause. 10s not very 
original but, broadly speaking, my answer would 
be that history will say who Tam. 
BW You are from the north of Martinique.... 
A.C.: I've always had the feeling that 1 was on a 
((uest to reconuer something, my name, my coun- 
try or myself. 
That is why my approach has in essence always 
heen poetic. 
Because it seems to me that in a way that’s 
what poetry is. 
The reconquest of the sel( by the self. 
HB And what is your preferred instrument for that 
purpose? 
A. Co: Ithink words are the essential instrument! 
For a painter it would be painting! For a poet 
itis words! 
I think it was eidegger who said that words 
are the abode of being. There ave many such quo- 
tations. 1 believe tt was René Char, in his surreal- 
ist days, who said that words know much more 
about us than we know about them. 
| too believe that words have a revealing as 
well as a ercative function. 
BW Revealing, creative... exploratory, perhaps? 
A.C.: Exploratory is very well put! It's the plum- 
met dropped in the water, the homing device that 
brings the self back up to the surface. 
BW You have often said that the black person's first 
words, after the long years of silence, are bound to be 
revolutionary words. Does that mean that poetry is 
“revolutionary” as well? 
A.C. Yes, it is revolutionary because it is the 
world turned upside down, ploughed up, traus- 
muted. 
When the review Tropiques came out in Mar- 
tinique under the occupation in 1941, in the mid- 
dle of the world war, like a plunge into the con- 
tradictory wellsprings of the West Indian soul, a 
stark glimpse into the depths of colonial alien- 
ation, it was truly a cultural revolution. 
And when the Viehy censor banned Tropigues 
in 19141 with the comment that it was revolution- 
ary, he showed himself to be a very good critic. It’s 
true! It was a cultural revolution. 
We were carrying out a kind of Copernican 
revolution. There was good reason to be surpised! 
And the Martiniquais were themselves surprised 
as they stood revealed to themselves. Tt was a 
strange encounter! 
It modified quite a number of values. 
BH Which ones? 
A.C.: We are by definition complicated beings. 
That is the general rule for any society hut one 
that is particularly applicable tn the case of soci- 
eties where complex layers of sediment have 
been laid down as a result of the inequalities of 
colonial life. Not everything was negative, lar 
from it. The hybridization of which we are the 
outcome las achievements and positive values 
to its eredit wherein the West and Europe also 
had their share. There was, as I say, a positive 
side, the effects of which were only belatedly felt 
by the non-Luropeans but which are undeniable 
and in which we ave simultancously agents and 
partuners—and, I should add, sometimes the hen- 
eliciaries as well. The Abbé Grégoire! Victor 
Schoeleher? and all those who spoke out and

### 105954: The Liberating power of words

Aine Césaire 
in April 1994, 
  
Identity means having roots, but it is also 
a transition, a transition to the universal, 
still speak out, who campaigned for human rights 
without distinction of race and against diserim- 
ination, these weve my guides in life. They stand 
forever as representatives of the West's great 
outpouring of magnanimity and solidarity, an 
essential contribution to the advancement of the 
ideas of practical universality and human val- 
ues, ideas without which the world of today 
would not be able to see its way forward. Tam for- 
ever a brother to them, at one with them iu their 
combat and in their hopes. 
HW You made an important speech in Geneva in 1978, at 
the event called “Geneva and the Black World”, in 
which you said: “The effective power of poetry, with its 
two faces, one looking nostalgically backward, the 
other looking prophetically forward, with the 
redeeming feature of its ability to redeem the self, is 
the power of intensifying life”, Was your Cahier d'un 
retour au pays natal, published in 1939, just such a 
primary utterance? 
A.C.: Yes, that is how I see it: a new starting-point, 
areal start—there are many false starts in life. 
But I think that was, lor me, the real start. 
Disinterring memories, all that was buried, 
bringing it back, presenting it so that it bursts 
[orth (ully formed npon the world—I think this 
sends an important signal. To express, not sup- 
press, Lhe force of one’s reaction, to wield rein- 
vigorated words as a miraculous weapon against 
the silenced world, freeing it from gags that are 
often imposed [rom within.

BM How does one set about “ungagging” the world? 
A.C.: Isimply believe in the redeeming power of 
words. 
M Is that enough to deal with the human condition and 
the way it repeatedly slides out of control? 
A.C.: Probably not, not without love and human- 
isi, 
1 really do believe in human heings. 1 lind 
something of myself in all cultures, in that extra- 
ordinary effort that all people, everywhere, have 
made—and lor what purpose? 
Quite simply to make life livable! 
It is no easy matter to put up with life and 
face up to death. 
And this is what is so moving. 
Weare all taking part in the same great adven- 
ture. 
That is what is meant by cultures, cultures 
that come together at some meeting-point. 
BM You invented the term “negritude”, which has been 
the mortar holding together a historic movement. Does 
not the assertion of negritude carry with it the risk of 
separating you from others, from “non-blacks”? 
A.C.: We have never regarded our specificity as the 
opposite or antithesis of universality. It seemed to 
us—or at least to me—to be very important to go 
on searching for our identity but at the same time 
to reject narrow nationalism, to reject racism, even 
PEVOerse racism. 
Our concern has always been a humanist con- 
cern and we wanted it to have roots. ~ 
We wanted to have roots and at the same time 
to communicate. 
I think it was in a passage in Hegel emphasiz- 
ing the master-slave dialectic that we found this 
idea about specificity. le points out that the par- 
ticular and the universal are not to be seen as 
opposites, that the universal is not the negation of 
the particular butis reached hy a deeper explo- 
ration of the particular. 
The West told us that in order to he universal 
we had to start by denying that we were black. 1, 
onthe contrary, said to myself that the more we 
were black, the more universal we would be. 
It was a totally dillerent approach. It was not 
a choice between alternatives, hut an effort at ree- 
onciliation. 
Not a eold reconciliation, but reconciliation in 
the heat of the fire, an alchemical reconciliation if 
you like.

Aimé (Césaire 
The identity in question was an identity rec- 
onciled with the universal. For me there ean never 
be any imprisonment within an identity. 
Identity means having roots, but it is also a 
transition, a transition to the universal , 
HN Fire, one of the main life forces? 
A.C.: Yes, as you say, fire. 
There is un obvious fiery quality in my poetry, 
but why? I belong to this island. . . . Why this 
obsessioninmy poetry? It is not something that 1 
deliberately seek. I am aware—everyone is 
aware—that the volcano is out there. It is carth 
and itis fire. 
Fire is not destructive. The volcano is not 
destructive except in an indirect way. Itis a cos- 
mie anger, in other words, a creative anger, yes, 
ereative! 
We are far removed from that romantic idyll 
beneath the cahn sea. These are angry, exasper- 
ated lauds, lands that spit and spew, that vomit 
forth life, 
That is what we must live up to. We must 
draw upon the creativity of this plot of land! We 
must keep it going and not sink into a slumber of

aceeplance and resignation. It is a kind of sum- 
mons to us from history and from nature. 
WM How, then, do you explain the fact that your 
“primary utterance” was expressed in the language of 
the colonial power, of colonialism? 
A.C.:Thave no problem with that. 
It was not something I wanted, butit happens 
that the language I used was the language I had 
learned at school. That didn’t bother me in the 
slightest, it didn’t in any way come between me 
and my existential rebellion and the outpouring of 
my innermost being. I bent the French language 
tomy purposes. 
Nature and history have placed us at the cross- 
roads of two worlds, of two cultures if not more. 
There is the African culture, which I see as being 
below the surface; and precisely because it is 
below the surface, overlooked, treated with con- 
tempt, it needed to be expressed, to be brought 
out alive into the light. 
But the other culture was the obvious one, 
the one we were conscious of from books and fromm 
school, and which was also ours, an integral part 
of our individual and collective destiny. 
And so I have tried to reconcile these two 
worlds, because that was what had to be done. On 
the other hand, I feel just as relaxed about claim- 
ing kinship with the African griot and the African 
epic as about elaiming kinship with Rimbaud and 
Lautréamont—and through them with Sophocles 
and Aesehylus! 
WM But what does the African griot think when he sees 
the tragic events unfolding in Rwanda or Zaire and the 
pall of hopelessness hanging over Africa, the Africa of 
which you dreamed so often while you campaigned for 
decolonization? 
A.C.: I have never harboured any illusions about 
the risks of history, be itin Africa, in Martinique, 
in the Americas or anywhere else. History is always 
dangerous, the world of history is a risky world; but 
ilis up to us at any given moment Lo establish and 
readjust the hierarchy of dangers. 
I saw that very elearly as early as 1966, at a 
time when great hopes had been aroused by the 
aceession of many countries to independence. 
Indeed, I spoke out about this at the opening sem- 
inar of the World Festival of Black and African 
Arts in Dakar in April 1966, before an assembly of 
African dignitaries who were new to their jobs and, 
it must be admitted, unelear in their minds about 
the world and the power relationships init, about 
themselves and about their irreversible responst- 
bility. 
Ihave the words of my speech of 6 April 1966 
here in front of me. This is what I said: 
“Africa is under threat, threatened by the 
impact of industrial civilization, threatened by 
the internal dynamisin of Europe and America. 
Youn may ask why we should talk of threats when 
there is no European presence in Africa, when eolo- 
nialism has disappeared and Africa has become 
independent. 
“Unfortunately, Africa will not get off so 
lightly. The disappearance of colonialism does not 
mean that the danger of African cnhture disinte- 
grating has also disappeared. The danger exists 
and everything contributes to it, whether the Euro- 
peans are there or not: economic development, 
modernization, political development, higher 
school attendance rates, education, urbanization, 
the integration of Africa into the world network of 
relationships, and so on and so forth. In short, just 
at the moment when Africa is truly being borninto 
the world, itis in greater danger than ever of dying 
unlo itself. That does not mean it should not be 
born into the world. It does mean that in opening 
itself up to the world it should keep its eyes wide 
open to the dangers and that, in any event, the 
shield of a merely political independence, politi- 
cal independence unaccompanied and unsupple- 
mented by cultural independence, would in the 
long run prove to be the most anreliable of shields 
and the most untrustworthy of safeguards.” 
On top of that there has been political irre- 
sponsibility, and the whole gamut of cynicism has 
been run through! Fortunately, however, there 
have also heen shining examples of the greatness of 
Africa, such as Nelson Mandela. Afriea is experi- 
encing the human adventure, and 1 am prepared to 
wager that the vital force of elernal Africa will 
once more inspire the song of the griot. 
NW What about the Marxist Utopia to which you 
subscribed in 1946 and which you condemned before the 
Budapest crisis in your Letter to Maurice Thorez, in

## [Page 7](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/105969engo.pdf#page=7) 0

### 105954: The Liberating power of words

which you set out your reasons for breaking with the 
Communist Party? 
A.C.: It is true that, like so many of my contempo- 
raries, I believed in what turned out to be a false 
Utopia. I am not at all ashamed about this. In the 
postwar context it expressed a heartfelt enthusi- 
asm, a spiritual yearning. 
But it was very soon followed by disappointment, 
a feeling of being manipulated, a conviction that one 
was being lied to and, as I said at the time, an unbear- 
able awareness of “the collapse of an ideal and the 
poignant illustration of the failure of a whole gen- 
eration”. Ifelt an irresistible need not to keep silent 
and, regardless of the prevailing conformism, to 
break away at whatever risk to myself from the then 
all-powerfnl framework of the Marxist apparatus. It 
was part of my ontological ehoice as a lriman being 
aware of the non-negotiable responsibility that goes 
with a consciously accepted identity. 
BW In Discours sur le colonialisme (1950), you said that 
“nobody can colonize with impunity, there is no 
innocent colonization. There will be a heavy price to pay 
for reducing humanity to a monologue”. 
A.C.: Yes, I am deeply convinced that universal 
civilization has a great deal to lose by reducing 
whole civilizations to silence. 
I think it wonld greatly impoverish human eiv- 
lization if the voices of African, Indian and other 
Asian cultures were to fall silent. If the global- 
ization we are now being offered were to reduce 
the dialogue of cultures to a monologue, it would 
create a civilization doomed to langnish and 
decline. I believe in the importance of exchange, 
and exchange can only take place on the basis of 
mutual respect. 
HW Isitstill relevant, in 1997, to think in terms of 
combat? 
A.C.: We are always, all of us, warriors. The war 
takes different forms at different times, but there are 
always things to rebel against. One is always in rebel- 
lion against something, things that are unacceptable, 
things I will never accept. That is the inevitable way 
of the world, probably for everyone. There are things 
with which I cannot come to terms. [ cannot aceept 
that a people be stifled or that Africa be obliter- 
ated, } cannot resign myself to such things. 
I desire—passionately—that peoples should 
exist as peoples, that they should prosper and 
make their contribution to universal eivilization, 
beeause the world of eolonization and its modern 
manifestations is a world that erushes, a world of 
awful silence. 
HM At the age of eighty-four, Aimé Césaire, well over half 
a century after Retour au pays natal, are you still faithful 
to your belief in the urgent relevance of poetry? 
A.C.: Of eourse I am. Ino longer have the same ele- 
mental energy, or the same strengtly, hut I stand by 
it, T have not reneged on it. 
Bl Is poetry still effective today? Will it always be? 
A.C.: At any rate, it is for me the fundamental mode 
  
The voice of poetry is the only 
one that can still be life-giving 
and provide a basis on which 
to build and reconstruct. 
of expression, and the world’s salvation depends on 
its ability to heed that voice. It is obvious that the 
voice of poetry has heen less and less heeded during 
the century we have lived through, but it will come 
ta be realized more and more that it is the only voice 
that can still be life-giving and that can provide a 
basis on whieh to build and reconstruct. 
Hl Wouldn't you say that underlying the poetic 
dimension of your work there is always a purpose, an 
ethical aim? 
A.C.: Yes indeed, there is an etlideal aim nnderly- 
ing everything. From thie time of the Cahier dun 
retour au pays natal onwards, a concern for 
humankind emerges, a searching for the self hut 
also a searching for fellowship and universality, a 
searching for human dignity, which I believe to he 
the bases of ethics. 
BM And yet this century has not been one where ethics 
has triumphed, has it? 
A.C.: Certainly not, but one must speak out, whether 
one is heeded or not; we hold certain things to be 
fundamental, things that we cling to. Even if it means 
swimniing against the tide, they must he upheld. 
What we seek is reconciliation, to be in league 
with the cosmos, in league with history, to be in keep- 
mg with ourselves. 
In other words, poetry is for me a searching after 
truth and sincerity, sincerity outside of the world, 
outside of alien times. We seek it deep within onr- 
selves, often despite ourselves, despite what we seem 
to be, within our innermost selves. 
Poetry wells up from the depths, with explosive 
foree. 
The volcano again. 
No doubt Ihave reached the moment of erossing 
the great divide but I face it impertarbably in the 
knowledge of having put forward what I see as essen- 
tial, in the knowledge, if you like, of having called out 
ahead of me and proclaimed the future aloud. 
That is what I believe 1 have done; somewhat 
disoriented though I am to find the seasons going 
backwards, as it were, that is row it is and that is 
what I believe to be my vocation. 
No resentments, none at all, no ill feclings hut 
the inescapable solitude of the limman condition. 
That is the most important thing. |

The “crossroads cities” described in the UNESCO Courier 
earlier this year are places apart. They seem to stand 
aloof from theirimmediate surroundings and to concen- 
trate their gaze on distant horizons. The world is 
their oyster. 
In the present issue we see a totally different attitude 
to place, one in which towns and cities, buildings and 
works of art are dovetailed closelyinto their physical set- 
ting and bear witness to the two-way relationship between 
people and the places they live in. We see a tapestryin 
which the strands of geological time, historical time and 
eternity have been successfully woven. 
The two themes are nevertheless bound by a common 
thread: the fluctuating relationship between societies 
and their environment, a relationship that at different 
times and in different cultures has given rise to a vast 
spectrum of sometimes contradictory attitudes—from 
the humility of the nomadic herder in the immensity of the 
desert to the arrogance of the industrialist who regards 
the whole planet as simply a productive resource. 
Here, in a nutshell, is the whole range of human 
experience. |

W Seashells in the sand 
Looking down from the aircraft window as 
you cross the Atlantic coming from Europe, 
you sce tiny islands and great white filaments 
of cloud stretched above the distant surface 
of the ocean, an abstract spectacle dreamlike 
in its ever-changing beauty. You land on a 
Caribbean island. Immediately you are 
enveloped by the sultry heat. You drive to a 
small town, not far from the sca. It is already 
dark, and the chorus of insects and frogs isin 
full swing. Eventually you drop off to sleep 
in this completely alien world. When you 
wake up early the next morning, the sun is 
already beating down with all its force. You 
walk around the town. The trees are quivering 
in the sea wind. Leaving behind the fish mar- 
ketand a knot of huts buried in the vegetation, 
you come to a cemetery at the sea’s edge. You 
walk along rows of graves covered in white 
tiles. Suddenly the cemetery gives way to the 
near-black sand of volcanic islands. Ina plot a 
few yards square thercare a series of mounds, 
each the length of a human body, around 
which “lambis”—large conch-like seashells— 
have been driven into the sand, the pointed 
end downwards and the big, ochre-coloured 
re

end upwards and open to the air. Under these 
simple mounds some of the town’s poorest 
people, penniless old sailors, have unceremo- 
niously been laid to rest, naked, with only 
the sca and some of its creatures, and the black 
sand over them. 
These unadorned graves speak volumes. 
The seashells are the loudhailers of the dead 
and the car-trumpets with which they listen to 
the voices of the living and hear the sea wind. 
Until quite recently, the same kind of shells 
were used by fishermen as loudspeakers as they 
drew near to the shore at night, There is some- 
thing admirable about these graves: the dead are 
respected and their spirits arc addressed via 
onc of the most beautiful and natural objects 
the landscape has to offer. You arc on one of 
those groups of islands between English- 
speaking North America and Latin America, 
between the Old World which has left its colo- 
nial imprint, and the faint incmory of pre- 
Columbian populations exterminated by set- 
tlers from the Old World, between a 
remembered past in Africa whence, because of 
the slave trade, most of the population is 
descended, and a present of ethnic intermin- 
gling. You arc on a volcanic island subject to 
cruptions and cyclones. In this environment of 
chronic instability and general rootlessness, 
the landscape is a medium of human dialogue.

wildest of the world’s wild places, as an 
extreme example of the human quality of the

mountains as they really are, I have observed 
that a mountain is never virgin territory. 
Everywhere there are visible signs of human 
presence and human labour that were specifi- 
cally designed to be visible—tracks, embank- 
ments, terraces, dwellings, markers of all kinds. 
Eveninbarrendesert uplands you will see 
where animals have grazed. You will come 
across a tent whose occupants will greet you 
and invite you to share their food or drink 
and join in their conversation. In another place, 
when you thought you were completely 
alone, you suddenly come upon a few piles 
of stones or a heap of round pebbles inadry 
river bed put there as landmarks or bound- 
ary stones to show the limits of the grazing 
grounds. In desert regions and places where 
there is little agriculture, these practices still 
continue. In the mountainous regions of 
Europe they have a different function. The 
mounds of stones known as cairns now serve 
to show hill-walkers the way in the absence of 
a track. These “waymarks” are living things. 
If you remember, you add another stone to 
the pile for the benefit of the strangers who 
will come this way after you.

than secular associations. Mount Sinai is the

In this case we have a monologue rather than 
a dialogue: God issues commands. On some 
mountain tops thereare small shrines, stupas, 
crosses or votive tablets. The summits of the 
Italian Alps provide a particularly vivid illus- 
tration of this. On many of them there is a 
small statue of the Virgin, affording protec- 
tion from lightning and misfortune. The 
Christian traveller should thank her on reach- 
ing the summit. 
I know some mountain peaks, not only 
those in the Italian Alps, where a recess is hol- 
lowed out of the great cairn surmounted by a 
religious statue. In the recess is a metal box 
inside which is a school exercise book or sim-

recovered from deep within the landscape a 
record of the weariness and the joy of

After days of trekking through the moun- 
tain wilderness of the Jbel Sarho in Morocco, 
I climbed one evening to the highest summit 
in the range, where I found cairns of all shapes 
and sizes scattered about. Three days later, a 
nomad explained to me that this was a holy 
place to which pilgrimage should be nade once 
a year. The proliferation of cairns, as I under- 
stood it, represented individual prayers, or

on the contrary, the principle of dispersal, of

later I saw another of these, so to speak, decen-

Atlas range, was a mass of cairns, “kerkours” 
as the local Berbers call them, and fresh traces 
of the blood of animal sacrifices. 
Mountaineering is supposed to be a dis- 
interested activity and as far as commercial 
gain 1s concerned so it 1s, certain media-ori- 
ented antics apart. But it too does not regard 
landscape as a blank backcloth devoid of 
human signs. The mountaineer, far from 
climbing a featureless slope, is engaged in read- 
ing a history book written in various “regis- 
ters” of language. First comes the geological 
register: the climber has to usc one kind of 
technique and equipment on limestone and 
others on granite, snow or ice. Then comes 
the register of sport: climbers “rchearse” a 
route already “opened” by some predecessor or 
other, work out a timetable and train to get 
themselves in shape for specific moves and spe- 
cific feats of acrobatics. There is also an acs- 
thetic register to what I call the “composi- 
tion” of the ascent: climbers’ senses and 
thought processes arc attuned to savour a par- 
ticular shape of mountain, a certain light at a 
certain time of day; thorough gymnastic 
preparation enables them to perform a kind of 
cffortless-seceming dance in the middle of a 
rock face or even experience rapture up there in 
the sky. The boldest climbers of all, those who 
“open” new routes, arc able, before starting 
out, to sight-read the signs of the rock face 
and their aim is to make the route as elegant 
and rigorous as possible. Thus, even an uncon- 
quered peak is first regarded and then scaled as 
a form of technical and ethical language in 
which the climber enters into a dialogue with 
his or her fellow human beings. 
Onc of the finest acts of communion with 
landscape I ever saw took place in a small oasis

in the Atacama desert of northern Chile. I had 
been trudging over those waterless high 
plateaux, some of the barest scenery I know. In 
the distance volcanoes rose to over five thou- 
sand metres. One afternoon I came upon a few 
houses huddled around a spring in a hollow of 
the plateau. An annual pre-Columbian rite for 
the purification of the irrigation channels was 
in progress. Three days of ceremonies were 
culminating in a meal which had to start with 
a glass of fiery corn spirit. Custom required 
that the first drops should be poured on the 
ground to salute Mother Earth, to quench 
her thirst and to make her fertile. After the 
libation and invocation, the drinking could 
begin, the ceremony could be brought to a 
close, and people could return to their daily 
work. 
Thus, as we see, humans fulfil themselves 
by transforming the place where they live into 
landscape. They humanize it, first discovering 
and then creating signs of human life there. 
Landscape is a mirror in which people can see 
themselves, interacting with others of their 
kind through signs scattered about in town 
and country.

At the beginning of this century, Victor 
Segalen made a telling contribution to the 
establishment of this concept of landscape, 
especially in his essay with the tongue-in- 
cheek title of Equipée (Jaunting). He pretends 
to be making preparations for a voyage to 
China, which in fact he already knows well. He 
describes the country, travels down its rivers, 
visits its towns and presents a wonderful pic- 
ture of a vast, inorganic natural landscape, 
when suddenly the description takes strange 
poetic wings. Two eyes are watching the nar-

whom nothing clse is known. The traveller 
observing the landscape is in fact being 
observed by the landscape. Further on in his 
essay, Segalen defines what he calls the “Esthé- 
tique du Divers”, which entails recognizing 
the existence of a proliferation, a destabilizing 
turbulence, in the real world; landscape is 
indeed a proliferating human language.

o visitor to Japan can fail to be 
impressed by the many torii—sim- 
ple yet highly remarkable gate- 
ways—which adorn the landscape 
in town and country, in ficld and forest, on 
riverbanks and even in the sca. Although 
unmistakably gateways, they consist simply 
of two pillars set in the ground, surmounted 
by two horizontal beams, onc just above the 
  
other. A number of variations on this basic 
form may be encountered, but the principle 
of construction remains the same. Virtually 
devoid of decorative elements, the gateways 
arc characterized by austerity and purity of 
line. Constructed of wood, stone, porcelain, 
metal or even reinforced concrete, they may be 
left bare or be painted red and black. The 
height and width of the gateway may vary 
from one metre up to twenty or more. 
Composed of a few clegant strokes, the 
torit resembles an idcogram, a signature affixed 
to nature by human hand. A gateway without 
a gate, it cannot be closed nor does it form an

opening onto an otherwise closed space. How- 
ever, 1ts very presence carries meaning. Itis an 
emblem of faith. The torii stands as a clear 
pointer to the essential relationship between 
humanity and nature which has existed since 
ancient times. It forms a symbolic boundary 
between two realms which are fundamentally 
different in human experience: the sacred 
province of the gods (kami) and the profane 
sphere of everyday human activity. 
The torrii constitutes an almost intangible 
threshold across which nature and human- 
ity may communicate. A thirteenth-century 
painting depicts a sacred mountain at the foot 
of which one of these gateways may be seen. 
The mountain is the sanctuary, and the tori 
is the only visible sign of human presence. 
W Sacred pillars 
In addition to their aesthetic qualities, tori: 
also have an ethical significance which extends 
far beyond the doctrinal framework of 
Shinto, which is the foundation of religious 
belief in Japan. In Shinto belicf, the gods are 
neither omniscient nor omnipotent. These 
far-from-perfect entities are natural forces 
which bear a striking resemblance to human 
beings, although their behaviour sometimes 
defies human understanding. It is only by 
their works that the gods differ from mere 
mortals. As if to stress this proximity, Shinto 
conceives of the link between heaven and earth 
in a very concrete manner, as the “August 
Celestial Pillar” on the island of Onogoro. 
In a more general sense, the pillar plays an

important role in Japanese mythology. The 
architecture and rituals of Shinto consider 
some pillars to be sacred. Anyone may pass 
through a torii at will, it is always open to 
wind, light and sound, and to animals and 
huinans alike. 
WN The Suwa trail 
To escape from the oppressive summer heat of 
Tokyo, Ispent afew days in a mountainous 
region in the centre of Japan, staying in a 
small house situated in a forest of pine trees, 
silver birches and lacquer trees, the sap of 
which is an irritant to the skin. 
At the point where the path to the house 
departs from the main road stands a tori built 
of grey stone. The rectangular plaque hanging 
from the centre of the horizontal beams is 
inscribed with a nance of great resonance: Suwa 
Jinja. The Suwa sanctuary, situated near the 
Suwa lake on Honshu island, is particularly 
renowned for the four sacred pillars (tree 
trunks stripped of their bark) set at its four 
corners. 
But this roadside tori does not lead 
directly to the sanctuary. The three or four- 
metre-high stone gateway, in perfect keeping 
with its natural surroundings, simply marks 
the entrance of the path leading to one of the 
subsidiary arcas of Suwa Jinja. The fect of the 
pillars sprout from a clump of miniature 
bamboo, while maple leaves brush the tips 
of the beams. As I make my daily passage 
through the tori, the structure makes no par- 
ticular impression on me; I perceive it as I

perceive the surrounding vegetation. It is like 
a guardian spirit, discreetly preparing the vis- 
itor for the realms beyond. 
Leaving the house, I may choose to 
descend towards this first portal, or to climb 
a fairly steep path and move deeper into the 
forest. On summer days, a continuous flow 
of nightingale song accompanies my foot- 
steps like a meditative chant, occasionally 
punctuated by the repeated tapping of a 
woodpecker. Nature is bursting with life. A 
few hundred metres on, this winding path 
comes to a clearing where stands another tori, 
this time set apart from the vegetation. There 
is no central plaque, no decoration of any 
kind. The bark has been roughly stripped 
away to leave the bare pine, dappled with 
irregular knots. In spite of its state, it per- 
fectly commands the surrounding space, 
undoubtedly marking the entrance to a spe- 
cial domain. Built by human hand, it signifies 
a space that may be described as “sacred”. Its 
massive pillars can be seen as evoking the 
“August celestial pillar.” 
The surprisingly small scale of the central 
shrine, hardly bigger than a postbox, makes 
this “sanctuary” all the more intriguing. In

comparison to the size of this building, the 
space created by the tori appears immense. A 
sizeable bottle of rice wine sits, half-empty, 
along with a few small coins, before the 
miniature temple. The divine spirit obviously 
enjoys a drink and needs money. The modesty 
of this sacred dwelling reminds onc of the 
humorous touches in some of the more 
down-to-carth passages of the Kojiki! 
(Chronicle of Ancient Times) and the 
naivetyof the gods who created this world. 
"The ‘cloak’ on the pillar 
Japan boasts far more spectacular roris; at the 
entrance to the Itsukushima sanctuary in the 
bay of Hiroshima, for example. Here, the ris- 
ing tide laps at the feet of the red pillars, while 
the main buildings—also standing in the 
water—are fleetingly reflected in the undu- 
lating swell. This sanctuary is a perfect exam- 
ple of harmony between sky, sea and moun- 
tains, which form an ideal stage for the 
appearance of the deities. It seems as if all these 
clements were infused with a single breath of 
life. 
Also worthy of special note are a number 
of white wood torii at the Ise sanctuary, in the

south of Honshu island. The pure, unclut- 
tered forms, the exceptional quality of the 
wood and the sheer size of these toriz are such 
that they deserve an article all to themselves. 
However, I have chosen to evoke my per- 
sonal torii which, in their own modest way,

Dry stone walls streak fields with 
pumice and obsidian, vineyards, Etna’s 
black and fertile slopes, fields of Barbary 
fig trees, columns of olive and almond 
trees transfixed in eternal poses. Like life- 
lines across the palm of the hand they 
bear witness to life gone by and mark its 
stages. Sometimes, in their rectitude, they

church steps on feast-day evenings, the

begging or selling, with their unique form 
of speech, immense candles for the pro- 
cession. On the waxy or mossy steps 
people move like little children afraid of 
falling. They sway like fishermen scourg- 
ing the wine-dark sea by order of the rais, 
the chief, and harpooning the tuna 
imprisoned in the almazraba—the net— 
the scene of another tragedy in which 
the fish come to die. On church steps 
people take stock of the world, seek a 
reply when fate hounds their families, 
when neither clerical cloth nor talisman 
can cure the wounds of heart and soul.

Platforms, terraces and stairways arc the 
veins of Sicily through which flow tiny 
trickles of sand and water. Life and death.

© or the people of the Dominican Repub- 
lic creating colourful surroundings is 
almost second nature, 
The dominant colours they use arc the 
primary colours: blue, red and yellow, with 
a few others thrown in—green, sky blue, 
purple and pink. Black is excluded from their 
palette and white is used to separate other 
colours or to create a neutral arca. These 
colours are uscd to beautify dwellings and 
their surroundings. If the doors are blue, 
for example, the main structure will be red, 
green or yellow. The aim is to create a colour 
scheme for a whole neighbourhood or vil- 
lage, not for cach individual house. Varicty 
is the keynote. Doors and windows may be 
the same colour, separated by white from 
the dominant colour of the house. Few 
houses are painted in more than three 
colours—onc at least of the four main tones 
is always missing—but no house sports only 
one. The whole effect shows an intuitive 
knowledge of the art of using colour. 
= Asymbolic attachment 
The predominance of blue is a way of bring- 
ing the sea into everyday life. Thereis a para- 
dox here, for the Dominicans turn their 
backs on the sca, which they regard as the 
origin of all their misfortunes, of both nat- 
ural and human origin. They fear and shun 
it. The only thing they like about it is its 
colour. On other Caribbean islands gardens 
arc decorated with conches, sea-shells and 
starfish, but not here. Dominicans believe 
that conches bring bad luck. And blue is 
always accompanied by white, like foam on 
the crest of a wave. “In its desire to become 
sky, the sea makes clouds of foam,” Domini-

Many gardens contain an altar surmounted 
by a picture of the Virgin Mary of Altagra- 
cia (the country’s patron saint) at the end 
of a path of white stones. The niche housing

white, for white is the colour of faith. (In the 
mountainous north, tresses of garlic are hung 
on the door to keep the devil out.) Roads, 
parks and other public places are decorated in 
a similar manner. It is not uncommon to sce 
roadside shrines at places where accidents 
have occurred, and altars in public squares. 
These practices are illegal, but they are toler- 
ated by the authorities and are part and par- 
cel of the Dominican Republic’s magical- 
religious landscape. 
People have also modified the appearance 
of the urban landscape. Trees, especially palm 
trees, and electricity poles are often painted 
in a single colour to head height. For some-

1s simply an eye-catching sight, a way of 
enhancing the environment. In fact, cach 
colour represents an ideology. The colour 
of the party that won the presidential elec- 
tion recurs at regular intervals, and so does 
that of the party that won the local elec- 
tions. This way of marking out political turf 
goes back to the early days of independence, 
when colours were used to designate the 
main parties in order to overcome the obsta- 
cle of illiteracy: red for the conservatives, 
and blue—like the sca—for the liberals. 
Politics and sport 
Today the custom of painting pillars and 
posts has become widespread, but it still has 
political and sometimes sporting overtones. 
Some people even paint the front door of 
their house the colour of the party they sup- 
port. Colours can express sporting rivalry 
as well as ideological conflict, since cach of the

big Dominican baseball teams has its own 
colour: red, blue, green and yellow. Politics 
and sport arc ever-present in daily life. 
Poverty also plays a role in this unending 
dialogue with the environment. In the slums 
poverty has given rise to a specific architec- 
tural style. Lacking the funds to buy con- 
struction materials, slum-dwellers use tin 
cans, crates and all kinds of trash with great 
imagination to cover the walls of their homes 
in the shanty towns that sprawl around the 
edges of the big cities, along river banks and 
near the sea shore. To create an effect of uni- 
formity, some people use cans of a single 
brand as walls for their dwellings, or paint 
them with distinctive naive murals. The vari- 
ety of colours used to decorate large aban- 
doned public buildings reveals the number 
of families living there. Each family uses 
colour to mark off its living arca, 
Bars where people gather to drink and 
dance are one focal point of community

life. The back wall behind the dance floor is 
usually covered with an evocative painting 
of a sugar cane plantation or a seascape. The 
style 1s usually naive and the country’s 
dominant colours—blue, red, green and 
yellow—are used. Even the colours of the 
chairs are significant. Their varicty is enough 
to satisfy all tastes and tendencies, reflecting 
the colours of the country’s political and 
sporting teams. 
The visual landscape is backed up by a 
landscape of sound. Music blares from every 
corner. In bars, in houses, at every level of 
society, the traditional beat of the merengue 
explodes. On the breakwater, a long prom- 
cnade on the edge of the Caribbean, the noise 
soon becomes intolerable for anyone who 
has failed to understand that deafening music 
1s a component of Dominican life. It’s as if 
the people were trying to struggle against 
their environment, to drown out the hiss- 
ing of the waves, the moaning of the seca 
winds and the shouts and din of the street. 
Music is as aggressive as the colours that mark 
the landscape. The climate and the habit of 
living in the open air sharpens the senses, 
especially sight and hearing. The elements 
hercare part of human nature. The Domini- 
cans’ dialogue with their surroundings is 
also a dialogue with themselves. |

he first-time visitor to Cyprus is 
likely to be struck by the way in 
which the natural world—with all its 
contrasts, wisdom and perfection—is 
recreated inside the islanders” houses. The 
microcosm of the Cypriot house—tradi- 
tional or modern, in the mountains, low- 
lands or towns—is engaged in a constant dia- 
logue with the macrocosm of nature: with 
what the Greek poet Odysseus Elytis has 
called “the universe, the infinitely small, the 
unfathomable”. 
The language of this dialogue is a miscel- 
taneous and multicoloured assortment of 
pots of flowers, arranged in rows or placed at 
random around the entrance door, along walls 
and windows, on makeshift shelves or old 
tables, suspended from trees or outer walls,

as if to welcome the thirsty traveller. The pots 
of flowers strike a friendly note which might 
otherwise be excluded from homes and gar- 
dens by utilitarian and often thoughtless 
human intervention, to say nothing of the 
intensely arid climate of a land where summer 
lasts nearly six months. 
W A tradition of symbolism 
A geranium in a huge container stands har- 
moniously among daffodils, and all around 
flowers growing in a conglomeration of pots 
of all shapes and sizes create a vast coloured 
landscape. To enter a house ungraced by pots 
of flowers is to experience a foretaste of death. 
But let’s take a closer look at these clusters 
of pots. All kinds of receptacles, irrespective 
of colour, size or material, are pressed into

service and used for planting cuttings. Buck- 
ets, metal or plastic drums, tin cans or mar- 
garine containers, milk and yoghurt pots all 
form part of this astonishing miscellany. 
They are not arranged according to any sct 
order but moved around depending on the 
space available. There is no preordained aes- 
thetic pattern, as one might tend to think. 
This is a world of its own, loaded—over- 
loaded even—with affection, love and respect. 
It continually breaks the rules that govern 
the decorative approach and stylization of 
Western gardens. This is not mere decoration, 
but a world in a state of flux, in the throes of 
constant creation and recreation, ordained 
by standards of raw beauty based on an orig- 
inal law which obeys no human model and in 
my opinion achieves perfection. “Nature

itself”, Elytis tells us, “is neither good nor 
bad, beautiful nor ugly. It simply #5.” It exists 
in simplicity, humility and disorder, in a 
beauty that is both clusive and familiar. 
Symbolism, often dating back to Antiqu- 
ity, 1s associated with this strange world 
whose “inhabitants” are closely linked to tra- 
ditional life in Cyprus. Thelily is associated 
with purity. Certain cacti ward off the evil 
eye. A vine inside the house would climb, 
and sometimes still does, up the walls of the 
living room, twining round and clinging to 
beautiful traditional plates hung as orna- 
ments—but its two ends must never meet 
because that would bring bad luck. This is 
why in the past nobody was called Manolis 
(the plant’s common name). 
The therapeutic uses and virtues of some 
plants arc also important. The mushy juice of 
the aloe was once used as an ointment for 
treating wounds and burns. Basil and gera- 
niuins arc placed near doors or windows

where their powerful smell wards off mos- 
quitoes—and of course basil leaves whet the 
appetite of the Cypriots, who sprinkle them 
over salads. Sprigs of mint are systematically 
putin the folds, made for this very purpose, 
of the traditional halloumi cheese. Lavender 
leaves in a cupboard keep the moths at bay. 
The heady aroma of Spanish jasmine leaves 
and marjoram is inseparable from crystal- 
lized fruit, especially in the island’s rural areas. 
Walnuts are regarded as a gastronomic Jux- 
ury. They used to be served when the object 
of a visit was an engagement. 
WA woman’s perfume 
Love is associated, perhaps cven identified, 
with certain plants which have a distinctive 
odour and colour, such as jasmine flowers

sophisticated perfumes or hide discreetly in

> holidays). In traditional society, before the 
days of the sexual revolution, a woman who 
was desired was inaccessible. Only her per- 
fume—that wonderful blend of the flower’s 
smell with that of her body—could be fleet- 
ingly captured. Desire could be fulfilled only 
in song, dance and amorous daydreams, as is 
suggested by this couplet from a traditional 
Cypriot song: 
Jasmine at your door, oh my jasmine 
I came to prune it 
and your mother thought 
I had come to carry you away. 
The women tend the flower pots and are 
perfectly familiar with the qualities and needs 
of each plant. To keep jasmine perfectly fresh, 
they plant it in metal or terracotta pots or, 
better still, in wooden containers. 
Water 1s a serious problem in Cyprus. 
Planting flowers in pots rather than in a gar- 
den saves a great deal of water, especially in the 
arid plains, since just the right amount of 
water can be sprinkled over a flower pot. 
There is no water shortage in the mountains, 
but water is hard to transport, and access to 
houses is almost always difficult. What is 
more, plots of land suitable for cultivation 
are so small that, to save space, pots are

= Divine protection 
My wife was the first person I questioned 
about the origins of the custom of growing 
plants in pots. “Can’t you see,” she said, “that 
these are poor people’s plants? To begin with, 
they have no money to buy pots and they 
never buy plants. Friends and neighbours 
swap cuttings. ... The pots don’t count. It’s 
the plants that matter and the whole nexus of 
affection that grows around them. ...” 
I was struck by her words. I had been liv- 
ing with these pots for as long as I could 
remember without paying any attention to 
this practice whose ceremonial, functional 
and symbolic connotations can only be 
explained by wisdom born of long tradition. 
When women plant flowers (planting trees 
is a man’s job), arrange and rearrange flower 
pots to make sure that each plant is in its 
right place in the sun or shade, caress the 
plants, feel the joy of watching them blos-

som, and tenderly water them, they are act- 
ing within a long tradition of hospitality 
under divine protection. It would be a viola- 
tion of this tradition if strangers had to 
knock at the door of a house without pot 
plants—they are an umbilical cord between 
the domestic microcosm and the natural 
macrocosm. 
Pot plants perforin the same function in 
the monasteries that dot the hills and moun- 
tains of Cyprus, whose inner courtyards are 
oases of human warmth and fresh air. They 
restore to passing guests the peace and seren- 
ity they lost on their journey. The visitor’s 
first contact with the spiritual and artistic 
world of the Byzantine monastery is made 
through this miniature universe that seems to 
be in a state of rapture. Worship of God 
blends with the worship of nature, while the 
echo of the psalms intoned by the deep voices 
of the monks or in the sensuous tones of 
the nuns, accompanied by the song of the 
cicadas outside, infuses the senses and the 
spirit. 
These pots brimming with scent and 
colour are imbued with sanctity. They cecle- 
brate the inexhaustible totality of man and 
the world, the joys and beauty of the earth 
and the monastic austerity which leads to 
union with God. These intimate gardens 
where everything is within reach provide the 
mass of flowers which on Good Friday night 
accompany Christ to His tomb in a volup- 
tuous blend of classical sensuality and Byzan- 
tine spirituality. 
The geometrical order and perfection of 
Western gardens are a far cry from this sim- 
ple beauty whose every feature prolongs the 
stirrings of the soul. Here the law of analogies 
between people and their landscape seems to 
function to perfection. As Elytis says, “a line 
a painter draws is not limited to itself alone, 
but has an ‘analogy’ in the world of spiri- 
tual values. Secing the mountains shaped this 
way or that way must have an effect on the 
human spirit, must have its analogy.” NH

Chiloe Island (Chile). 
All Yahgans are named after the place where 
they were born, and my mother gave birth to 
me ncar Lakutia Bay. That’s how it is done 
among our people: we are given the name of 
the place that welcomes us to the world.” 
It 1s several centuries, however, in Chile 
and elsewhere in Latin America, since geo- 
graphical names told the simple tale of people 
living in symbiosis with their environment. 
Instead they speak of the clash of two peo- 
ples and two cultures fighting over the same 
territory. Indigenous names and European 
names of coastal features and mountains are 
associated with different memories. Today 
these names intermingle in a landscape into 
which the indigenous population wanted to 
melt while the Europeans simply wanted to 
take possession of it. 
Leaving their mark 
For the explorer who comes from afar, the 
land is like a new-born baby, as yet nameless. 
The names bestowed on places by the Euro- 
pean navigators and explorers who began 
arriving on the southern coast of Chile in 
the sixteenth century have political or reli- 
gious connotations, or else express a sensc of 
beauty or were even inspired by passionate 
love. Only seldom did the newcomers keep 
the indigenous name. 
The annexation of the Araucan lands, fol- 
lowed by their exploration by naturalists and 
their colonization, gave rise to a new series 
 
of terms and appellations. The vast territory 
inhabited by the Indians who provided 
Alonso de Ercilla, in the sixteenth century, 
with the inspiration for his epic of the con- 
quest, La Araucana, lay roughly between the 
Pacific, the Andes and two rivers, the Bio- 
Bio (or Malleco) to the north and the Toltén 
(or Calle-Calle) to the south. These lands 
were gradually integrated into the territory of 
Chile in the nineteenth century, the process 
being completed by 1883. Thereare still many 
Araucans today, but the indigenous popu- 
lations of the clusters of islands that stretch 
from the Isla de Chiloé to Cape Horn have 
become almost entirely extinct. 
Between Cape Horn and the main island 
of Tierra del Fuego, the place-names are some- 
times English (the Wollaston, Picton, 
Lennox, Button, Gordon King and Scott 
Islands), sometimes French (the Hermite and 
Bertrand Islands and the Pasteur Peninsula), 
or Spanish (Caleta Herndndez, Santa Rosa or 
Mejillones), with a few Yahgan Indian names 
thrown in, such as Bahia Tekenika, Canasaca 
or Wulaia. Thus, one name may be concealed 
behind another. Onashaga was the Yahgan 
name of the Beagle Channel and Yakashaka 
was that of the Murray Channel, at the 
mouth of the Strait of Magellan. 
As for Valparaiso, the leading port on the 
Pacific side of the continent before the con- 
struction of the Panama Canal, its Spanish 
name means “Vale of Paradise”. This was the

who had passed the Strait of Magellan or 
rounded the Horn making for the Pacific 
coast of South America dreamed of drop- 
ping anchor. 
WW Acts of possession 
History sometimes seems to have hesitated 
over thé choice of a name, even to the point of 
rejecting the one proposed by the discoverer. 
Magellan, for instance, having entered the strait 
that was to bear his name on the first day of 
November, decided to call it All Saints’ Strait, 
but it subsequently becaine known by other 
names—Straits of Patagonia, Victoria and the 
Moluccas, or again Dragon’s Tail Strait—but in 
common parlance it remaincd the “Strait of 
Magellan”. 
A similar process is associated with the 
naming of Cape Horn. Although the first per- 
son to have mentioned it seems to have been Sir 
Francis Drake, who entered the Strait of Mag- 
ellan on 20 August 1578, the first sailors to 
round the Cape, on 29 January 1616, thus con- 
necting the two greatoceans, were the Dutch- 
men Jacques Le Maire and Willem C. Schouten.

Every newcomer thus leaves the imprint of 
his language and the signs of his passage. 
Alonso de Ercilla, one of the discoverers of 
Chiloé, an island with an Indian name, 
expressed very well the keen powers of obser- 
vation and the underlying sense of pride of 
the discoverer who leaves his mark upon a 
place. In Part Three, Canto XX VI of La Arau- 
cana, he dwells atlength on the exploration of 
Chiloé and some of the neighbouring islands, 
inhabited by Indians. The Indians, he tells us, 
“were filled with amazement and wonder at 
the sight of these strangers [white-skinned, 
fair, hairy and bearded] with a different lan-

caught on, as if what had most appealed to

HB EFACT FLLE the world network 
Biosphere Reserves are geographical areas considered typical of the balanced relationship between people and nature. As of April 1997, 337 
Reserves, located in 85 different countries, have met the required criteria for this designation laid down within UNESCO's “Man and the 
Biosphere” (MAB) Programme. They combine three functions: 
WM species and genetic variation; 
Wm 2 development function — fostering economic development that is ecologically and culturally sustainable; 
WM a logistic function — providing support for research, monitoring, training and education related to local, regional, national and global 
conservation and sustainable development issues. 
The Reserves form a World Network within which exchanges of information, experience and personnel are encouraged. They contribute to 
meeting the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity and Agenda 21 that resulted from the 1992 United Nations Conference on the 
Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro. 
What are Biosphere 
Reserves fot? 
Human pressures on natural 
resources are drastically 
reducing the diversity of the 
earth's plant and animal 
species, ecosystems and 
landscapes. Biosphere 
Reserves safeguard samples 
of biodiversity, landscapes and 
ecosystems and contribute to 
the maintenance of the earth’s 
life-support systems which 
serve to prevent soil erosion, 
maintain soil fertility, regulate 
river flow, replenish aquifers, 
recycle nutrients and absorb air 
and water pollutants. 
Research may be 
conducted on the dynamics of 
the natural systems in the core 
areas of Biosphere Reserves, 
which have remained relatively 
unaffected by human activity. 
This research can be compared 
with the functioning of human- 
affected landscapes in the 
buffer and transition areas. 
Sharing knowledge of 
practices that improve human 
well-being without degrading 
the environment is a central 
purpose of Biosphere 
Reserves. They are places 
where issues can be debated 
by all the stakeholders 
concerned: scientists, local 
farmers, fishermen, politicians, 
private enterprises and nature 
conservation associations. 
THE UNESCO Gourits H MAY 199) 
How are Biosphere 
Reserves selected? 
To qualify for designation as a 
Biosphere Reserve an area 
should normally: 
— be representative of a major 
biogeographic region, including 
a gradation of existing human 
intervention; 
— contain landscapes, 
ecosystems or animal and 
plant species or varieties which 
need protecting; 
— provide an opportunity to 
explore and demonstrate 
approaches to sustainable 
development within the larger 
region where the Reserves are 
located; 
— have an appropriate zoning 
system, with a legally 
constituted core area or areas 
devoted to long-term 
protection, a clearly identified 
buffer zone or zones, and an 
outer transition area. 
BIOSPHERE 
RESERVE 
ZONATION 
  
How are Biosphere 
Reserves organized? 
The core area needs to be 
legally established and give 
long-term protection to the 
landscape, ecosystem and 
species it contains. 
A buffer zone must be 
clearly delineated. Human 
activities in this area should 
not hinder the conservation 
objectives of the core area but 
rather help to protect it. It may, 
for example, be an area for 
experimental research into 
ways of managing the 
ecosystem. 
The transition area, or area 
of co-operation, extends 
outwards from the Reserve. It 
is here that local communities 
and other stakeholders must 
agree to work together to 
manage and sustainably 
develop the area's resources.

"1 
Why a world 
network? 
Biosphere Reserves have a 
common interest in seeking 
concrete solutions to reconcile 
the conservation of 
biodiversity with the 
sustainable use of natura! 
resources for the benefit of 
local people. The World Network 
is supported by regional 
networks or thematic networks 
(e.g. for studying biodiversity). 
Co-operation can take the form 
of exchanges of information 
material, articles in the 
Biosphere Reserves Bulletin, 
co-operative projects, twinning 
arrangements, exchanges of 
personnel or organized visits. 
The World Network is 
governed by a Statutory 
Framework formally adopted by 
the General Conference of 
UNESCO at its 28th session. 
This framework defines the 
functioning of the Network and 
foresees a periodic review of 
Biosphere Reserves.

### 105963: Science and society, 3

The responsibility of 
scientists 
Knowledge is always good: it is its applieations that can 
be harmful or even evil. A hammer can be nsed improp- 
erly as an instrument of aggression; so at another level 
can atomic energy. But we must be careful not to allow 
only the negative aspects of science to be emphasized. 
These are usually described in exaggeratedly dark 
colours, while the good aspects are not news. 
The scientific and technological community has a 
duty to remind people ol the enormous benefits sci- 
ence has brought. Some years ago, the Green Revolu- 
tion, which has transformed the future prospects of 
millions of people in Asia, came under criticism from 
environmentalists because it had tended to favour 
richer farmers, who could afford the pesticides and 
fertilizers on which the new varieties of wheat and rice 
depended. The crities behaved as if this discredited 
the entire enterprise, whereas their criticisms were far 
outweighed by its highly positive aspects, 
There are plenty of other examples. Does anybody 
think about poliomyelitis any more? Or of the way we 
have been able to reduce pain and even eliminate it with 
the help of analgesics or modern anaesthetics? Or of the 
transport and telecommunications systems that enable 
us to be ¢itizens and witnesses of the whole world,

### IGNORE

even though they eompel us to assume the responsi- 
bilities this entails? 
We cannot shirk our moral responsibilities. We must 
admit that there have been a considerable number of 
silent scientists in the twentieth century. The possession 
of knowledge carries with it a moral obligation, What 
would we think of a meteorologist who did not warn us 
that a storm was coming? Or of elinical analysts who 
failed to alert us to the urgent nature of their findings? 
Scientists have to transcend the walls of their labora- 
tories, their departments, their faculties, and their 
industries. To say that the scientific life is simply a mat- 
ter of “publishing or perishing” is both disparaging and 
wrong. A scientist who chooses to remain silent, par- 
ticularly when irreversible eonsequences may follow, 
is behaving both unprofessionally and immorally. 
Genetics and ethics 
In no field of seience are the issues more complex than 
in genetics, nor is there any other area of science in 
which the discriminatory use of the information would 
be more scandalous. The whole subject of bioethies, far 
from being a luxury, should be the preserve of the 
entire hitman community, since the advances made by 
the few are a battle won for the whole human raee. 
Bioethics came into being, rightly, at the moment 


### 105963: Science and society, 3

when techniques of genetic manipnlation first emerged 
in the 1970s, and questions began to be asked about the 
influence of molecular biology on the future of human- 
ity. Far from simply being concerned with an investi- 
sation of the relations between science and society, it is 
concerned with the relation between man and nature 
inits biological diversity. The development of bioethics 
illustrates, [ believe, a proper and appropriate response 
by scientists and philosophers to the social questions 
raised by science. 
These are many. Genetic diagnosis and sereening 
make it possible to give reassurance to members of famn- 
ilies with a history of genetically transmitted illnesses. 
IMowever, should these tests be conducted only after the 
disease appears? Should genetic testing be restricted to 
hereditary, incurable, fatal or incapacitating diseases? 
How can the confidentiality of information be gnaran- 
teed over time, especially when they could be of enor- 
mous interest to employers and insurance companies? 
For the time being, the scientific community has 
agreed that there should be no use of gene therapy on 
the germ cells—those that wonld transmit the changes 
to the next generation—and that the cloning of human 
beings should be banned. But is this agreement based 
on ethical principles, or does it merely reflect current 
fears of the possible associated risks? 
Moral dilemmas 
Behind the first series of questions looms the speetre of 
eugenic selection, with its attendant host of violations of 
human rights and individual freedom, 
The temptation for couples to use the results of 
sercening in selecting their potential offspring is under- 
standable, but itis difficult to draw the line between the 
legitimate desire not to pass on serious genetic diseases 
and the illusory quest for the “perfect ehild”. At another 
level, it is not impossible to envisage entire societies 
being tempted to practise eugenic selection on entire 
populations that it might consider genetically vulnera- 
ble or as presenting “risks”. 
Each society must work out for itself a route through 
this moral maze, but there is also a role for the inter- 
national community. National rules may vary from coun- 
try to country, which could encourage a form of “genetic 
tourism”, in which people would be tempted to take 
advantage of laxer regulations abroad. The first stirrings 
of this have been seen in the use of techniques of in vitro 
fertilization which allow women past menopause to 
become pregnant. In Italy there are no rules or con- 
ventions prohibiting the use of this technique for women 
in their late fifties or even sixties, so that women from 
the United Kingdont have travelled there to take advan- 
tage of a treatment they would be denied at home 
because of their age. 
Without acting as judge and jury in sueh cases, it is 
nevertheless clear that some international standards 
are desirable. Similar arguments apply to the even 
more vexed question of the patenting of the human 
genome, where so far different countries have adopted 
different approaches. For these very reasons, UNESCO 
has created a World Committee ou Bioethies*; perhaps 
it would he wise to extend its scope to inelude every 
impact of science on human life. |

### 105964: The Islands of Mozambique

by Patrick Lages 
Arab, Indian and Portuguese architectural influences are blended in the port 
of Mozambique. Once a trading post on the sea route from Europe to the East 
Indies, this island harbour was placed on UNESCO's World Heritage List 
in 1991. 
The church of Our Lady of Mercy (17th century) is 
the only one still used for worship on the island.   
The little island of Mozam- 
bigue, which lies four kilo- 
metres off the coast of Africa just 
opposite Madagascar, was for hun- 
dreds of years a major centre of 
intercontinental maritime trade. It 
was occupied by Avab merchants 
from the teuth century until the 
end of the fifteenth, and in the six- 
teenth century became a port of 
call on the route from Europe to 
the Bast Indies opened by the Por- 
tuguese navigator Vasco da Gama. 
In 1507, the Portuguese built a 
fortress on the island where the 
Customs Honse stands today. A 
later fortification that has survived 
is the fort of St. Sebastian, which 
was built between 1558 aud 1620 
and is Inspired by Italian Renais- 
sance military architeeture, 
Mozambique harbour grew 
rapidly during the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centnries. Its business 
honses stood on the sea front, along 
a rocky helt where boats with a 
shallow draught could land at high 
tide. Over the years a town of twist- 
ing streets lined with flat-roofed 
houses took shape around a cen- 
tral s¢nare. 
The town asit appears today has 
a strong architectural homogeneity

quarries in the south of the island, 
and wood for heams and framework. 
The decorative style of the facades, 
with their cornices, high rectangu- 
lar framed windows and rows of 
pilasters, is equally homogeneous. 
The flat roofs, designed to collect 
rainwater and compensate for the 
istand’s Yack of freshwater springs, 
and a rectangular ground plan in 
which space is divided into six 
square rooms also uphold a general 
impression of unity which encom- 
passes the smallest houses roofed 
with palm leaves—the macuti that 
constitute aronnd a quarter of the 
city—as well as the most luxurious 
residences. The preponderant 
architectural inlluenee is that of 
southern Portugal, although there 
arc undeniable Arab and Indian ele- 
ments. 
THE COLONIALTOWN

long bridge that links the island to

a majestic neo-classical building 
eonstrircted in 1877 and recently 
repainted white, with a garden dee- 
orated with ponds and fountains. 
For many years it was the biggest 
hospital south of the Sahara. 
VANISHED SPLENDOUR 
Behind the half-open doors of pros- 
perons town houses ean be seen 
neglected but once well-tended gar- 
dens. In a Mediterranean-style café 
with eliequerboard floor tiles, 
snperannuated fans churn the air in 
avastroom where a handful of cus- 
tomers sit around tables with inlaid 
chesshoards. The menu, painted 
on the wall by a local artist, never 
varies: fish, mixed grill, salad. 
Opposite, the ehmreh of Our Lady 
of Merey offers its immaeulate 
facade to the sun. Built in 1635 on 
the ruins of an carlier church 
destroyed by a Dutch bombard- 
ment in 1607, it is one of the oldest 
buildings en the island. It houses 
a small museum of saered art, and 
during the services the singing of 
the faithful is punetvated by the 
insistent beating of tonr-toms.

in 1010, it was destroyed by fire 
sixty years later and rebuilt in 
1674. From 1763 nntil 1935 it was 
nsed as the residence of the island’s 
governors. It was converted into a 
museum in 1969 and today houses 
a fine collection of European and 
Indian furniture of different peri- 
ods so that it looks for all the world 
like a royal dwelling. It is connected 
to the sea front by a small square 
with Art Nouvean street-lamps 
where two-coloured paving stones 
evoke the undulations of the oecan 
swell. 
A MICROCOSM OF HUMANITY 
On the sea front, the colonial town 
slowly gives way to fishermen’s 
houses. On the shore the people 
from the poorer neighbourhoods 
zo about their business. Women 
and girls queue beside a fountain 
for a little fresh water. Children 
run around and always end their 
games by diving into the sea shout- 
ing with joy. Mozambique’s popu- 
lation has increased by over 50 per 
cent since 1968, largely beeause 
of the war and the refugees dis- 
placed by it. The town market is 
one of the islands liveliest spots. 
A rigorously symmetrical quadri- 
lateral, with small towers rising at 
each corner, it was built in 1887. 
Its waves are mainly fruit and small 
fish set out on trestle tables. Under 
the shady porehes of houses a een- 
tury old, street vendors sell indi- 
vidual eigarettes, biscuits, sweets 
and fizzy drinks to passers-by. 
At the other end of the island, 
between two heaches of white 
sand, the fort of St. Sebastian now 
only defies imaginary fleets. Tts high 
dark walls, built on the coral of the 
island, plunge sheer into the sea.

desolate spot, sweeping the white 
terraces, groaning in the gigantic

GREENWATCH 4 
In the early eighteenth cen- 
tury English landscape gar- 
deners began to rebel against the 
straitjacket of French classicism. 
They were weary of gardens divided 
into symmetrical blocks by rectilin- 
car paths punctnated with states 
and fountains, gardens where no 
plant had a right to grow outside its 
appointed place. When the fashion 
for informal landscaped gardens 
appeared in England, the hand of 
Chinese influence was widely felt. 
“Everyone knows that English gar- 
dens are nothing more than imita- 
tions of Chinese gardens,” wrote 
Georges Le Rouge in 1774 of the 
fashion for what were known as 
“Anglo-Chinese” gardens, which 
later spread to many parts of Enrope. 
In point of fact, Chinese influence 
went no further than a pagoda or 
pavilion placed at the edge of a 
stream in the middle of a park. 
The gardens of the Far East are 
small enclosed worlds that awaken 
the senses and calm the mind. Every- 
thing in them seems designed to

CHINA: ROOMS WITH A VIEW 
“In Chinese,” writes Antoine Gour- 
nay, assistant eurator of the Cer- 
nusehi Museum in Paris, “the word 
yuan (garden) means not so much an 
arca set apart (rom built architee- 
ture and mainly nsed for growing 
plants, as a specilie way of distrih- 
ating and arranging the spaee of a 
dwelling.” He goes on to say that 
“ITouse and garden in China are 
more often dovetailed together than 
juxtaposed; what’s more, the vege- 
tation that decorates this ensemble 
is considered as secondary to rocks 
and water.” The regularity of archi- 
by France Bequette 
tecture contrasts with the irregu- 
Farity of the garden with its twisted 
rocks and ponds in a variety of 
shapes. 
Rocks symbolize mountains, the 
place where sky and earth meet. 
They are chosen carefully. The more 
unusual their shape, the more they 
are worth. Their size depends on 
their ereator’s resonrees and ambi- 
tions. In the 11th century, the 
Northern Sung dynasty emperor Hui 
Tsung spent twelve years ereating 
the of Golden 
Longevity Mountain (5,000 m?®) and 
Lake Clarity, 
Gen Yu rockery (150 metres high) in 
the imperial city of Bian Liang. In 
his book Classic Chinese Gardens, 
Qiao Yun tells how the emperor “did 
not hesitate to knock down bridges 
or destroy reads aud eanals to trans- 
port these rocks.” In China, where 
mountains are worshipped (e.g. Kun- 
lun shan, the residence of Tai ji, the

“immensely great one”), there are 
no gardens without rocks. 
Water is as essential as rocks, to 
which it is a complement, since 
water and rocks are yin and yang. 
Sun-drenehied, angular and hard, 
rocks are yang. Cold and dark bm 
also free, pure and regenerative, 
water is yin. Lin Bang, Gaozu 
(fonnding emperor) of the lan 
dynasty in the third century B.C, 
created three avtificial islands in Tai 
Yi Lake, to symbolize paradise. 
From that time on all imperial gar- 
dens used this syinbol. 
The first private gardens are 
tecorded in the year 900, the finest 
examples being in the city of Suzhou 
in Jiangsu province. Many men of let- 
ters went to live in the city in isola- 
tion [rom the world, and there they 
practised gardening and painting on 
sill. The format of traditional paint- 
ing on hand serolls, which is read 
cither vertically or horizontally, is 
said to corvespond perfectly with 
the thought processes of the lover of 
gardens, 
inclosed by walls, which provide 
a neutral background, the Chinese 
garden contains buildings for varions 
leisure activities. The landscape is 
arranged according to the rooms [rom 
which itis viewed. No single point 
affords an overall view. Natural comn- 
positions are framed hy open-work, 
round, rectangular or fan-shaped win- 
dows, and doors shaped like full 
moons or vases, Non-strnctural walls 
are replaced hy moveable partitions. 
Covered walkways meander through 
the garden so that it can be enjoyed 
in all weathers. The fusion between 
the inside and outside aveas is 
complete, 
Galleries, pathways and bridges 
shun reetilinearity, for straight lines 
are nsed by evil spirits. Garden design 
isregulated by the science known as 
Jengshui, which Eterally means “wind 
and water” and is expressed via geo- 
mancy. For 2,000 yearsit was incon- 
ceivable to build a house withont 
first consulting a gromancer, “If you 
induce harmony of place,” says the 
Book of Rites (Li ji), “then sky and 
rarth will assume their rightful 
places and everything will prosper.” 
Antoine Gonrnay explains: “The site, 
orientation and shape of buildings 
are chosen so as to use to maximum 
effect the breaths of the life force 
(giyun) that appear in this place, cap- 
ture their beneficial effeets and take 
precantions against their haneful 
influences.” The ideal site faces 
south, turns its back to a mountain 
and is near a stream flowing from 
northwest to southeast. The garden 
should be entered from the south. 
The Ryoan-ji Zen 
garden in Kyoto 
(Japan) is 
considered to be 
the earliest 
example of pure

stone-work 
garden.

JAPAN: PUTTING THE WORLD IN 
ORDER 
Japanese garden design is also gov- 
erned by fengshui, and as early as 
the sixth century it was drawing 
inspiration from Buddhism and Chi- 
nese practices, But Chinese and 
Japanese thinking about gardens 
went different ways. “By means of 
the most ordinary things gardens 
enable us to grasp the seeret of 
nature and its real essence,” wrote 
Soami, a sixteenth-century monk and 
aesthete who wrote a book on gar- 
dens, 
“The shadow of the bamboo 
sweeps the steps 
but not a speck of dust moves. 
The moon plunges to the bottom 
of the fonntain 
but the water is unruffled,” 
reads an entry in the Zenrin Kushu, 
an anthology of quotations compiled 
in the fifteenth century. The garden 
is a place conducive to meditation. 
Rigour, purity and asymmetry pre- 
side over its composition. Nothing is 
left to chanee. Tts architecture is as 
codified as calligraphy, the tea eer- 
emony or the art of {lower arvange- 
ment. In fact gardening was done by 
monks, painters or masters of the 
tea ceremony until professional hor- 
ticulturists came on the seene. As a 
way of putting the world in order, it 
expresses a religion or a philosophy 
with as mueh precision as a cathe- 
dral or a treatise, Its size is of no 
importance. It can he miniaturized 
and even he contained in a small 
poreelain cup.

and philosophers. While vesting Le]

» from their labours, they composed 
haiku, 17-syllable poems celebrating 
nature. “The dead leaves flutter 
down one on the other. The rain falls 
on the rain.” Their studies lasted 
for np to ten years. Their favourite 
trees were pine, plum, cherry and 
maple. Irises, peonies, azaleas and 
chirysanthemums could be nsed to 
add notes of colour. Everything was 
arranged according to immutable 
principles. A tree, for example,   should never he planted in the ¢en- 
tre of the garden, for it wonld resem- 
ble the kumaru tdeogram which 
means “to have problems”. Stoncs

The water hyacinth: an aquatic pest 
The water hyacinth is a thick-leaved freshwater plant with a pale blue flower. Imported into Asia and 
Africa from South America because of its heauty, it proliferated unchecked in the silty, mineral-rich 
water of lakes and rivers. When it is well established, it consumes the oxygen fish need to survive, hin- 
ders fishing and navigation and slows water flow to a trickle so that hydroelectric power plants become 
useless. The economies of some Asian and African countries, especially the nations bordering Lake Vie- 
toria, Africa’s biggest fake (some 70,000 km?), have been so hard hit by this persistent parasite that they 
have declared war on it. The World Bank and the Global Environment Facility have committed several 
million dollars to the struggle. 
The opening moves in the battle, conducted using chemical herbicides, were not very successful, partly 
hecanse the range of usable prodnets was severely limited by a concern to preserve aquatic life and main- 
tain water quality. Eventually the idea of introducing a natural predator was adopted and is now being 
tried out experimentally by the Kenyan Institute of Agrienltural Rescarel, which imported nearly 
35,000 weevil larvae from Australia and put them into the lake. 
Since then, however, international experts meeting in Namibia for a symposium held under the 
United Nations University’s Zero Enission Research Initiative! (ZERI) have expressed scepticism about 
the weevil’s effectiveness and are afraid that the introduction of this new inscet into the lake's ccosys- 
tem may have unpredictable consequences. On the other hand, they showed interestin a proposal [rom 
a working group of experts, endorsed by Prof. §. T. Chang, a world famous Chinese expert on mushroom 
growing, which suggests that if the hyacinths are harvested, dried and mixed with other waste, they could 
make a nseful substrate for the cultivation of nmshrooms. Seven African and Asian nations have agreed 
to take part in this experiment. 
I the results are conclusive, the mushrooms could provide participating conutries with a foodstu(f 
that would be nutritionally appreciable since it would contain iodine if seaweed residue were to he 
added to the culture substrate. This is important since 30% of the population of southern Africa and 
20% of the people living in the highlands of Southeast Asia suffer from chronie iodine deficiency. There 
is also a possibility that the substrate could be recycled by earthworms, which would convert it into 
chicken feed and a rich compost for enhancing soil fertility. The first findings will be examined at the 
third international congress of the ZERI Programme to be held this June in Jakavta (Tndonesia), HW

ceivable in Cliina, appeared around 
the middle of the fourteenth cen- 
tury under the influence of Zen phi- 
losophy. To achieve inner illumina- 
tion, satori, the sage creates an inner 
void by silently contemplating a ree- 
tangle of raked white sand from 
which deeply buried and carefully 
placed stones protrude. Waterfalls, 
rivers and waves are suggested by 
furrows made by the rake. In the 
most famous of these gardens, the 
Ryoan-jiin Kyoto, which dates from 
the Muromachi period (fourteenth 
to sixteenth centuries), fifteen rocks 
emerge from a hed of white gravel. 
The crowds that visit the garden 
cvery day see in it islands, constel- 
lations, elouds or even a tigress with 
her cubs. 
Later, when the tea ceremony 
had been institutionalized, a garden 
was designed to provide it with a set- 
ting. This “tea garden” is divided in 
two: an inner garden and an outer 
garden. The tea honse must seem 
isolated from the rest of the world. 
The tall trees that surround it are 
untouched by shears. 
In places where hot springs shoot 
out of voleanie soil, the garden 
designer creates a pond for bathing 
and relaxation. In this setting all 
kinds of shapes and objects become 
symbols. In the garden of the Silver 
Pavilion (Ginkakn-ji, fifteenth ¢en- 
tury) in Kyoto, an ordinary pile of 
sand meant for the gardens upkecp 
caught the gardeners eye. Shaped 
like a truncated cone, its flat top 
reflected the moon so well that it 
immediately became an altar to the 
glory of the moon and a protected 
monuntent. |

BARK-LOVING BABOONS 
Since 1992, when drought 
forced them to change their 
diet of small mammals, birds, 
insects and plants, the 8,000 
baboons of Manicaland, a 
province in eastern Zimbabwe, 
have taken a shine to the bark 
of young pines. Now their 
healthy appetite is causing $5 
million damage a year in the 
plantations. Timber merchants, 
for whom this damage repre- 
sents considerable loss of 
income, want to get rid of the 
baboons, but traditional chiefs 
and environmentalists are kos- 
tile to the idea. |_| 
THE WORLD'S 
OLDEST TEATREE 
A 2,700-year-old tea tree has 
recently been discovered in 
China’s Yunnan province, not 
far from a plant only 200 years 
younger. The tree, whichis 1.2 
metres in diameter and 25.5 
metres tall, is growing in virgin 
forest at an altitude of 2,500 
metres. The discovery is sur- 
prising because normally wild 
tea shrubs do not grow more 
than 10 metres tall. It tends to 
support the theory that tea 
may have originated in Yunnan 
province. |_|

UNDERGROUND DAMS 
While damming rivers pro- 
vokes lively debate (see 
“Greenwatch”, Mareh 1997), 
damming underground streams 
where they come to the sur- 
face is much less controversial. 
The Chinese have created 
large underground reservoirs 
in karst (limestone) by using 
this “bottling up” technique. 
During floods, river water col- 
leets in underground cavities, 
where it is stored until needed 
in the dry season. Not all types 
of rock lend themselves to this 
kind of scheme, however. WR

THE SUNFLOWER 
WAY TO SOLAR POWER 
By observing the movement of 
sunflowers, Swiss inventor 
Emile Jansen lias fonnd a sim- 
ple way of maximizing the yield 
of panels of photovoltaic cells, 
which convert solar energy 
directly into electricity. He set 
out to design a system that 
would turn the panels to follow 
the sun without using either 
clectrieity or harmful gases 
(such as Freon or the CFCs), 
and at a cost that would be 
absorbed by the inercase in 
cnergy production, Le came up 
with the “Jawisol” system, 
which uses the principle of 
dilating {luids. Powered by the 
sun’s heat, a jack filled with 
fluid tnrns the photovoltaic 
panels mechanteally by a sys- 
tem of cables and pulleys. The 
system has been proved effee- 
  
   
tive after two years of tests by 
a Swiss engineering school. 
Unfortunately solar energy is 
not as popular as it might he. W

BOUNTIFUL 
BAMBOO 
Bamboo throve all round the 
equator, from Indonesia to Tan- 
zania and Costa Rica, until col- 
onizers arrived and cat it down 
to make room for farmland. Its 
(qualities have long been under- 
estimated. It has a higher ten- 
sile strength than steel, grows 
quickly (taking only 5 years to 
reach maturity) and ts an excel- 
lent building material. In the 
provinee of Caldas (Colombia) 
3-storey bamboo buildings 
more than a century old are still 
being used. Bamboo can also 
be used as drainage piping and 
as a basis for renewable fuels, 
and bamboo shoots are delica- 
cies tn Chinese and Japanese 
cooking. With some 1,500 vari- 
eties in Africa alone, hamboo 
is the renewable plant of the 
futnre. ||

### 105967: Ethiopia's Azmari minstrels

LLSTENING ETHIOPIA’ 
azmari minstrels BY ISABELLE LEYMARIE 
HM Are all three of you genuine azmaris? 
Ejigayehu Shibabaw: No, the only azmari 
is Weres Egeziaber. Ile only performs tra- 
ditional music, whereas Fantahun She- 
wakochew Mekonnen and I sing and play 
other kinds as well. A real azmari has to 
play the masenqo, an instrument Weres 
Egeziaber specializes in. 
rs 
HB It is said that the meaning of the word 
azmari has changed. Whereas it once meant 
“praise-singers “ it has supposedly come to 
mean “those who criticize”, or even “those 
who denigrate”. 
E. S.: Afew centuries ago the azmaris per- 
formed religious funetions at the courts of 
sovereigns. They celebrated liturgies and 
officiated at certain ceremonies. Their 
repertoire only gradually became more sec- 
ular. They began as praise-singers, then 
they sang love poetry and eventually hegan 
to invent humorous or satirical verse in 
which they poked fun at their own pro- 
teetors. 
HB In some regions, the griots, who are also 
praise-singers and heirs to a long tradition, 
are not allowed to criticize or abuse anyone 
directly, although sometimes they allow 
themselves to make a few veiled allusions. 
E. S.: In Ethiopia we are absolutely free to 
do this. The azmaris in partientar and tra- 
ditional singers in general exeelin the art of 
improvisation. They have a partienlar lik- 
ing for humonr, alliteration, puns aud 
satire. No one really takes exeeption to 
their mockery. Love songs ave still by far 
the most popular part of their repertoire, 
however. 
BM Ethnological studies of Ethiopia say that 
the azmaris are despised by the rest of society. 
E. S.: That is true of nusicians in general,

The azmaris are minstrels who belong to Ethiopia’s Christian majority, the Amhara. Their 
repertoire, whose origins are lost in the mists of time, consists largely of light poetry, much 
of it extemporized. They use traditionalinstruments such as the krar, a lyre with similarities 
to those used in ancient Egypt, the masengo (a single-string spike fiddle) and double- 
skinned drums. Women performers wear long white dresses with scarlet bands, and the men, 
white shirts and trousers and a kind of cloak with a wide golden-brown sash. Three exponents 
of this Amharic tradition, singer Ejigayehu Shibabaw (at centre of photo) and her 
accompanists, (on her right in photo) Fantahun Shewako chew Mekonnen (krar, percussion 
and vocals) and (on her left) Weres G. Egeziaber (masengo and vocals), recently gave a series 
of recitals in Paris. During their visit, they talked to Isabelle Leymarie. 
not just the esmaris. My father, for exam- 
ple, is a businessman, and is very hostile to 
the fact that I am a singer. I had to run 
away from home to follow my voeation. 
HM Yet you give concerts outside Ethiopia and 
you are just about to make your first 
recording. Isn't this success a point in your 
favour? 
E. S.: Not at all. He believes that it is 
shameful to perform in public. Even if ] 
became a big star, he wouldn't change his 
mind. 
Weres Egeziaber: I must he an exception 
because my family was overjoyed that 1 
became a musician. My parents are farmers, 
and when I was eighteen I learned to play 
the masengo in my village from small 
groups of itinerant musicians. 
HB Ejigayehu Shibabaw, you are not from a 
family of musicians, how did you learn the 
traditional repertoire? 
LE. S.: By car. But that is very casy, because 
in Ethiopia, even in Addis Ababa, every- 
one knows the old songs. Tradition is still 
very much alive. Ldidn’t need recordings or 
any speeial training. I speak two Ethiopian

languages: Amharic, my mother tongue, 
and Ago, whichis avery rhythmic language. 
And if I lave to sing songs in other lan- 
guages, Ilearn them phonetically, Fan- 
tahun Shewakochew Mekonnen studied 
music for four years ina school where they 
taught both classical Western music 
amd Ethiopian music. He often does 
arrangements. 
Bl How did you form your trie? 
E. S.: We met at a puppet show at the 
Addis Ababa National Theatre, a big 
employer of singers, dancers and musicians, 
Bl How do you improvise? 
E. S.: We usually improvise words to a given 
melody. Even during a concert I sometimes 
invent new couplets when I feel inspired. 
HM Do the musicians improvise too? 
F.S.K.: Yes, but according to certain rales. 
Ethiopian nmsie—Amharic music in par- 
ticular—is based on pentatonic scales, 
There are a lot of them and each one 
expresses a specific mood. We mainly use 
four, Improvisation is traditionally done 
inside this modal framework. Our instru- 
ments, especially the masenqgo, are 
adapted to this form of mnsie. I also play 
the trumpet and the piano. As well as the 
traditional repertoire, 1 play pop music, 
Ethiopian pop, using brass and keyboards 
but with words sung in Amharic. We also 
listen to foreign music, but our inspiration 
is mostly local, although we are not locked 
into the old modes, Sometimes we mix sev- 
eral modes or Alrvican modes and Western 
scales. 
BM Ejigayehu Shibabaw, do you sing more 
modern music? 
E.S.: Yes, I'm currently preparing to make 
my first record, also using brass and key- 
hoard instruments. It will include a blend 
of reggae and West African and Ethiopian 
beats. I'm calling it Tsahay, “sun” in 
Amharic. Our country is vich in rhythms— 
often unknown outside Ethiopia—so 1 
doubt I'll ever be short of inspivation. MW

Happy and glorious 
BY GEORGI DANAILOV 
  
Still going strong a century after his creator's death, 
a hero of Bulgarian literature who stepped out of the pages 
of fiction into real life. 
  
Itis a rare occurrence for aliero of literature to leap off the page, turn 
his back on the writer who created him, and go olf and live his own life. 
Lonly know of one such ease in Bulgarian literature. is progenitor 
was Aleko Konstantinov, who was horn in Svishitov in 1863 and met his 
end on the road between Peshitera and Pazardhzik in 1897. Konstan- 
tinov was a lawyer, publicist and journalist, who signed his works with 
the pen name “Happy”. Demoerat, musician, nature-loy er, mountaineer, 
traveler and bohemian, he was an intellectual aristocrat and perhaps 
Bulgaria’s most brilliant writer. 
After producing a travel hook about Ameriea, Do Chicugo i nazad 
(“To Chicago amd Back”, 1891) Konstantinov used a blend of love, 
hate and satire to create a cluaracter of a ty pe we come aeross every day 
of vor lives, a character we thoroughly detest and with whom at the 
same time we [eel a secret complieity. Ostensibly we expel him [vom our- 
selves but at the same time we leave the baek door wide open [or him, 
because when we are ina tight spot we need his inventiveness and hits 
extraordinary adaptability, We loathe his impudence and braggadocio, 
his erudeness and laek of sophistication, hut we know that we have the 
same intolerable quirks as lie does. 
Aleko Konstantinov ercated his character effortlessly, with aristo- 
cratic nonchalance. He gave him the name Ganyu, that of a merchant »

### 105968: Anniversary: Aleko Konstantinov (1863-1897)

AN Nod iil wi RS i wh 
» of attar of roses he had met in Chicago, to which lie added the name 
Balkanski, meaning “Balkan” —a hold yet justified generalization— 
and made him the central character of a series of short stories. 
The Bulgarian public has taken Ganyu Balkanski so mueh to heart 
that it has virtually forgotten his ovigin as a fictional eharaeter. This 
earthy, authentie figure is so suecessfnl, aetive and alive that he is at 
Liome in all kinds of settings and plots. Ile crops up in Prague and 
Vienna, in Switzerland and Russia, where he has pieked up the secrets 
of journalism, the principles of unprincipled politics, eleetion-winning 
tacties. 
Some eritics have seen Ganyu Balkanski as the archetype of the Bul- 
garian petty bourgeoisie which was to be almost squeezed out of exis- 
tence by half a century of socialism. To the amazement of the Marxists, 
however, Aleko’s hero did not go under with the bourgeoisie but con- 
tinued on his sprightly way, marching at the side of demonstrators 
brandishing the red flag. 
In the popular imagination, Ganyu has acquired a heroic dimension. 
ITe has become a man worth two, a sexual titan, a lively mind who can 
find original solutions to all kinds of problems. Like many undying 
heroes of world literature, Bai Ganyu has a strong sense of humour and 
the capacity to laugh at himself. 
Someone once asked Aleko Konstantinov what was the happiest 
day of his life. “The day when I had the idea of writing Bai Ganyu,” 
was his answer. Ganyun Balkanski’s ereator was murdered by hired 
assassins on 21 May 1897. There is a theory that he was killed by mis- 
take and that the bullets were intended {or Lis friend, the politieian 
Takev, with whem he was travelling in a coaeh. They had changed 
places a few minutes before the eoach reached the spot where it was 
ambushed. Many years later, the Bulgarian artist Ilya Beehkov drew a 
widely applauded cartoon of the scene. Alcko Konstantinov is shown 
lying on the ground riddled with bullets and saying to Ganyu Batkan- 
ski, whois leaning over him, “Did you do it, Bai Ganyu? You've shut my 
trap, ch?” 
In spite of that, I refuse to think of Ganyu Balkanski as a parricide. 
In spite of all his faults and odious characteristics, I regard hin as an 
extremely resoureeful man and do not see why he should always be pil- 
loried. Ile was a great survivor, and that’s all. Perhaps the Bulgarians 
would not have survived several centuries of domination without the 
vitality, powers of endurance and flexibility of Aleko Konstantinov’s hero. 
And so Mr. Balkanski is still going strong. As for his creator, all that 
survives of him in the house where hie was born is his heart—a hard piece 
of yeHowish muscle patched up by pathologists and preserved in aleo- 
hol—exhibited in a glass ease. As well as this relic visitors can see the 
clothes Konstantinov was wearing when he was killed. ITis shirt hears 
rust-coloured bloodstains. Imprints of his killers’ footsteps are moulded 
in plaster. 
A superb bust of Konstantinov by Jeko Spiridonov ean be scen in the 
municipal gardens at Svishtov. Aleko is holding a cigarette and a hint 
of a smile plays about his features as he gazes transfixed at some won- 
derful sight. “To Aleko!” says an aflectionate inscription engraved 
beneath the bust. What writer, politician or public man could boast of 
being so close to the people? 
In 1995, Chieago University also decided to ercet a bust to Aleko 
Konstantinov. A copy was made of Jeko Spiridonov’s work—but with- 
out the hands! It was said that moulding the hands would have made 
the reproduction too expensive. And perhaps that cigarette wonld 
have made a bad impression. So only Aleko’s simile made the journey to 
America. |
