Editorial 
AN is an historical animal and 
African man is no exception. 
Just as everywhere else in the 
world, he created his own history and his 
own idea of it. Yet myth and prejudice of 
every kind have left the world with a grossly 
distorted view of African history, if not 
with the impression that Africa has no 
- history at all. 
After a long period of painstaking 
research and meticulous preparation, the 
record is now being put straight with the 
publication of successive volumes of 
Unesco’s eight-volume General History of 
Africa. 
The General Conference of Unesco has 
placed the preparation and drafting of the 
History under the sole intellectual and 
scientific responsibility of the 39-member 
International Scientific Committee for the 
Drafting of a General History of Africa, 
two-thirds of whose members are Africans 
and whose Secretary is Mr. Maurice Glélé. 
Following the directives of the General 
Conference of Unesco, the Committee, at 
its first session, defined the principal 
characteristics of the work in terms which 
merit quotation at some length: 
» Although aiming at the highest possible 
scientific level, the history will not seek to 
be exhaustive and will be a work of syn- 
thesis avoiding dogmatism. In many 
respects, it will be a statement of problems 
showing the present state of knowledge and 
the main trends in research, and it will not 
hesitate to show divergencies of doctrine 
and opinion where these exist. In this way, 
it will prepare the ground for future work. 
m Africa will be considered as a totality. 
The aim will be to show the historical rela- 
tionships between the various parts of the 
continent, too frequently subdivided in   
works published to date. Africa’s historical 
connexions with the other continents 
should receive due attention, these connex- 
ions being analysed in terms of mutual ex- 
changes and multilateral influences, bring- 
ing out, in its appropriate light, Africa’s 
contribution to the development of 
mankind. 
» The General History of Africa will be, in 
particular, a history of ideas and civiliza- 
tions, societies and institutions. It will in- 
troduce the values of oral tradition as well 
as the multiple forms of African art. 
» The History will be viewed essentially 
Jrom the inside. Although a scholarly work, 
it will also be, in large measure, a faithful 
reflection of the way in which African 
authors view their own civilization. While 
prepared in an international framework 
and drawing to the full on the present stock 
of scientific knowledge, it will also be a 
vitally important element in the recognition 
of the African cultural heritage... 
Volume I, Methodology and African 
Prehistory, and Volume II, Ancient 
Civilizations of Africa, have already been 
published (see the Unesco Courier, August- 
September 1979). Volume IV, Africa from 
the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century, and 
Volume VII, Africa under Colonial 
Domination, are to be published this year. 
In this issue of the Unesco Courier we 
publish extracts from these two volumes. 
The extracts from Volume IV throw new 
light on the ancient civilizations of west and 
southern Africa. Those from Volume VII 
reveal the extent of the African resistance to 
the colonial invaders, until now concealed 
by what might almost be described as a con- 
spiracy of silence. Our readers will find 
faithfully reflected in them the true face of 
a great and hitherto largely misrepresented 
continent—Africa.

sixteenth century was a key period 
in the historical evolution of Africa. 
These four centuries saw the rise and 
development in Africa of brilliant civiliza- 
tions. In the north and on the eastern 
coasts of the continent, under the banner 
of Islam, merchant cities sprang up which 
made of Africa one of the major cross- 
roads of world trade. Huge caravans 
crossed the Sahara linking the north with 
the Sudan, the “Land of the Black 
Peoples’, and with the gold mines of 
Ghana and Mali. 
Commerce was at its most intense and 
trade in goods of all kinds linked the 
various regions of the continent. Ar- 
chaeology has today revealed that even 
the equatorial forests were not an im- 
penetrable barrier to the circulation of 
men, ideas, techniques, goods and food- 
stuffs. 
Historians and researchers have long 
attributed to Islam the birth and develop- 
ment of the continent's cities, kingdoms 
and empires. But far from the Islamic zone 
of influence, on the Atlantic coast and in 
southern Africa, kingdoms and cities 
arose that were just as advanced and well 
organized as those of the Sudanese 
region. Among them were the brilliant 
T: period from the twelfth to the 
civilizations of Ife and Benin which reach- 
ed their apogee from the twelfth to the 
fourteenth century and whose statuary art 
constituted a heritage of striking originali- 
ty. Thanks to archaeology, the civilization 
of Zimbabwe, the ancient empire of 
Monomotapa, is also gradually yielding 
up its secrets. Today we know that perma- 
nent contacts between west Africa and 
the Maghreb, Zimbabwe and the east 
coast were maintained by pilgrims, travell- 
ing traders and commercial interchange. 
Our knowledge of this important period in 
African history is based on written 
documents, oral tradition and, more and 
more, the findings of archaeological 
research. || 
On pages 5 to 11 we present extracts from 
two chapters of Volume IV, Africa from 
the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century, of" 
Unesco’s General History of Africa, as well 
as a glimpse of a third chapter which ex- 
amines the role of Africa in the intercon- 
tinental exchanges of the period. Professor 
D.T. Niane is the general editor of volume 
1V, the English edition of which is to be 
published later this year in a joint co-edition 
between Unesco and Heinemann, London, 
and University of California Press. (See in-

### 59234: Ife-Benin: two kingdoms, one culture

two kingdoms, one culture 
by Alan Ryder 
 
Still considered by the Yoruba people as a holy city, Ife, in the Oyo province of present-day 
Nigeria, was from the eleventh century the capital of a flourishing civilization. By the late 
twelfth or early thirteenth century, Ife artists were producing their famous terracotta heads 
and fine bronzes made by the cire perdue (lost wax) process. This technique was transmitted 
to the Kingdom of Benin which began to prosper in the thirteenth century and where bronze 
art of the highest order flourished for five centuries. 
ONSIDERING the central place it 
C occupies in the general history of 
the Yoruba, we know surprisingly 
little about the history of Ife. After the 
comparative wealth of detail attached to the 
legendary founder of the State, Oduduwa, 
and his immediate successors, we encounter 
a very spare and broken narrative in the oral 
traditions for subsequent ages. The archae- 
ological record has done something to fill 
the gaps, but this research is in its infancy. 
A first phase in the history of the State, 
opening around the eleventh century, is 
characterized by a scattered settlement pat- 
tern, the widespread use of floors made of 
potsherds set on edge, a glass-bead industry 
and a very fine terracotta art which specia- 
lized in the production of naturalistic 
figures, especially human heads. Because of 
this latter feature, a link has sometimes 
been posited between the cultures of Ife and 
Nok, despite the thousand years which 
stand between them. 
More significant is the very close resem- 
blance which the terracotta art of Ife bears 
to that discovered in other centres of 
Yoruba culture. Heads in a style related to 
that of Ife have been found at Ikinrun and 
Ire near Oshogbo, at Idanre near Ikare, and 
most recently and. interestingly at Owo, 
where a large number of terracotta sculp- 
tures have been excavated in a fifteenth- 
century context. 
This wide distribution of the style may 
indicate the extent of Ife influence, but it 
may also be that it marks the spread of a 
cultural trait among the Yoruba associated

of west Africa, he has published many works

with religious rites rather than with Ife 
kingship. 
The potsherd floors, which in Ife have 
often been discovered in association with 
terracotta figures, are likewise not a unique 
feature of that city; similar floors have been 
found at Owo, Ifaki, Ikerin, Ede, Itaji 
Ekiti, Ikare and much further afield at Ketu 
and Dassa Zoume in the Republic of Benin

and in the Kabrais district of Togo. 
The earliest potsherd floors so far dis- 
covered in Ife date to about 1100 AD and 
the latest bear maize-cob impressions, 
which means that they cannot be earlier 
than the sixteenth century. The subsequent 
disappearance of the floors, and apparently 
   
also of the terracotta art, probably reflects 
some catastrophe which overwhelmed Ife in 
the sixteenth century. 
The twenty-five Ife ‘‘bronze’’ heads (they 
are in fact made of brass and copper), 
which bear so striking a stylistic resem- 
blance to the terracottas, may have been 
made in the years immediately before the 
disaster, when imports of brass and copper 
by the Portuguese had made casting metal 
relatively plentiful. We can at present only 
surmise the nature of the events which des- 
troyed this culture; conquest by an alien 
dynasty seems the most likely explanation. 
If the above interpretation of Ife history 
is correct, the dynasty which now reigns 
there is that which established itself in the 
sixteenth century, built the palace on its 
present site and threw up the earliest of the 
walls around the central area of the town. 
Perhaps the new dynasty has preserved 
some of the political and social institutions 
of its predecessor, but we cannot assume 
that the earlier regime resembled the later in 
its political arrangements any more than it 
did in its art. Because the modern pattern of 
installation ceremonies and royal insignia p 
Nok art (900 BC-200 AD) is the most an- 
cient of known Nigerian art. It is named 
after the small village in the region of Zaria, 
central Nigeria, where the first sculpture of 
this type was discovered in 1943. Once 
thought to have been confined to the 
Bauchi plateaux, the Nok civilization is 
now believed to have covered a far wider 
area. A natural link stretching across a 
millennium joins these sculptures to the ter- 
racotta art of Ife, to the southwest, which 
[flourished between the I2th and the 15th 
century AD. Left, Nok terracotta head 
(height 19.5 cm) is now in the National

Whether executed in terracotta, stone or 
bronze, the sculptures of Ife mark a high 
point in the art of portraiture (12th-15th 
century). Both realistic and idealized, Ife 
heads are outstanding for their nobility of 
expression and the delicacy of their carving. 
The head, top right, was discovered by the 
German anthropologist Leo Frobenius, 
who revealed Ife sculpture to the world in 
1910. As so often in Ife art the face is scored 
with lengthwise scarifications. Produced by 
the lost wax method, Ife bronzes display a 
high degree of technical accomplishment,

the fertility of the people and their crops.

The magnificent bronzes discovered at 
Igbo-Ukwu, a village near Awka in south- 
east Nigeria, are unlike those of Ife and 
Benin in both design and the composition 
of the alloy with which they were made. The 
product of outstanding formal and tech- 
nical skills, these works of art dating from 
the 9th century AD indicate that a vast and 
powerful kingdom, of which Igbo-Ukwu 
may have been the religious capital, 
flourished in this region a thousand years 
ago. Right, bronze stand depicting a

### 59234: Ife-Benin: two kingdoms, one culture

pare so similar throughout most of Yoruba- 
land, including Ife, and because these in- 
signia bear little resemblance to those worn 
by supposedly royal figures in the earlier 
phase of Ife history, it is reasonable to con- 
clude that modern Yoruba kingship derives 
from the later phase, even though States 
may originally have been formed on the 
pattern of early Ife. 
It is not impossible that the rise and fall 
of States in the western Sudan in the fif- 
teenth and sixteenth centuries had a direct 
influence on State formation in the Guinea 
forest zone. Their appearance and expan- 
sion may well help to account for the 
upheavals which happened about that time 
in the adjacent southern States. We know 
that the Nupe drove the Yoruba from Old 
Oyo early in the sixteenth century, and that, 
before they returned to their capital three- 
quarters of a century later, the Oyo had 
reorganized their military forces so as to 
give greater prominence to the cavalry, the 
striking force of armies in the savannah 
States. From the Nupe the Oyo borrowed 
the Egungun cult of ancestors, and certain 
features of their revivified State may have 
come from the same source. 
Benin was the first State that the Por- 
tuguese visited on the coast; they soon 
established diplomatic as well as trade rela- 
tions. Situated south-west of Ife, Benin 
probably became a kingdom early on, 
perhaps in the twelfth century, 
In the fifteenth century a major upheaval 
transformed this limited monarchy into an 
autocracy and the small State into a large 
kingdom. Tradition attributes the changes 
to a ruler known as Ewuare, who acquired 
the throne by ousting and killing a younger 
brother; in the course of the struggle much 
of the capital is said to have been destroyed. 
Ewuare rebuilt his capital to a new plan 
and gave it the name of Edo, which it has 
borne to this day. In the centre of the city 
a huge ditch and rampart were thrown up, 
cutting across older structures as did the 
city wall of Ife. Within the rampart a broad 
avenue separated the palace from the 
‘““town’”’—the quarters which housed 
numerous guilds of craftsmen and ritual 
specialists who served the ruler. The palace 
itself was organized into three 
departments—the wardrobe, the ruler’s 
personal attendants and the harem—each 
with a staff graded into three ranks 
analogous to the age grades of the Edo 
villages. 
Archaeology has confirmed the tradi- 
tions which assign the construction of the 
great wall of Ewuare and a major 
rebuilding of the palace to the fifteenth cen- 
tury. It has also shed light on the 
developments of the renowned Benin art of 
cire perdue (lost-wax) casting in brass and 
bronze. All brass objects found in a pre- 
sixteenth-century context prove to have 
been made by a smithing not a casting pro- 
cess. Although the cire perdue technique 
may have been known at an earlier date, it 
would seem, both from the archaeological 
evidence and from a stylistic study of the 
very large body of Benin brasswork still in 
existence, that only in the sixteenth century, 
with the import of large quantities of Euro- 
pean brass, did this art become important. 
In general, wood sculpture dominates 
black African art. The Ife-Benin civiliza- 
tion is the brilliant exception, in that one

finds works of art in terracotta and in 
bronze which accounts for the particular 
importance of this region in the general 
evolution of black African art. 
We noted earlier that objects in brass 
were either forged or made by the cire per- 
due technique, which was known at Ife pro- 
bably earlier than the thirteenth century. In 
the light of the most recent research, a 
natural link unites the terracotta art il- 
lustrated by naturalistic * figurines, par- 
ticularly human heads, with the culture of 
Nok, which goes back to the Iron Age (the 
fifth century before the Christian era). This 
is most important and underlines the 
widespread diffusion of the Nok culture; 
moreover, we have evidence of exchanges 
and continuing contacts between the coun- 
tries of the savannah and those of the forest 
to the south. Thus the well-known bronzes 
and naturalistic brass of Ife and Benin are 
the culmination of an artistic evolution 
begun at least as early as the Iron Age in a 
vast cultural region. 
This seems to be confirmed by the 
discovery in 1939, in the east of Nigeria, of 
the site of Igbo-Ukwu, which was explored 
in 1959 by Professor Thurstan Shaw; some   
In the court art of 
Benin, many bronze 
- artefacts are dedicated 
to the greater glory of 
the oba (king). Benin 
figures, despite a 
certain naturalism, are 
usually highly stylized. 
This flautist or 
trumpet-player 
(c. 1600; height 
62.5 cm) belonged to 
the oba’s court. 
800 bronze pieces have been brought to 
light which are completely different from 
the Ife-Benin bronzes. Igbo-Ukwu is an ur- 
ban complex in the middle of which were 
the palace and temples. Different buildings 
have been uncovered: a great room where 
plates and objects of worship and treasures 
were stored; a burial chamber of a great 
priest, richly decorated; and an enormous 
hole in which were deposited pottery, bones 
and other objects. 
Certainly there are some differences bet- 
ween the bronzes discovered at Igbo-Ukwu 
and the works of art of Ife. Nevertheless, a 
number of shared traits show that the two 
centres were part of the same culture. In- 
deed, we are in the presence, as at Ife, of a 
ritual monarchy. 
It is believed that Igbo-Ukwu was the 
religious capital of a very vast kingdom, 
and that the treasures were stored there 
under the keeping of a priest-king, Ezi Nzi. 
Information is lacking on the culture of 
Igbo-Ukwu; inquiries among those who 
guard oral tradition are continuing, and ar- 
chaeologists see an extension of the area of 
bronze manufacture. Nevertheless, Igbo- 
Ukwu appears to contradict much of what 
has so far been postulated about State for- 
mation; on the evidence of radiocarbon 
dates, this highly sophisticated culture had 
evolved by the ninth century among Ibo 
peoples who otherwise maintained a 
‘‘stateless’’ form of society. In other words, 
the lgbo-Ukwu culture antedates those of 
Ife and Benin, and all others of comparable 
complexity so far discovered in the forest 
region, by at least two centuries.

### 59235: The Secrets of Zimbabwe

  RE os an AE BR Jy] 
The secrets of Zimbabwe 
  
Deep in the heart of southern Africa, 
away from the zones of influence of the 
Islamic and Christian powers, the 
basins of the Zambezi and Limpopo 
Rivers were for centuries the setting for 
a number of brilliant civilizations, the 
most famous of these being that of 
Great Zimbabwe. Thanks to painstak- 
ing research by archaeologists, linguists 
and anthropologists, the ancient city of 
Great Zimbabwe, with its cyclopean 
buildings, is gradually yielding up the 
secrets of its past. 
8 
HATEVER the fundamental 
W causes behind the rise of Great 
Zimbabwe, there is no doubt 
that it is a most impressive monument. The 
site is dominated by the Acropolis, a long, 
granite hill covered with enormous boul- 
ders. Successive generations of occupants 
linked the boulders together with stone 
walls, making small enclosures and narrow 
passages. The westernmost enclosure is the 
largest, enclosed by a thick, free-standing 
stone wall. It contains a long sequence of 
later Iron Age occupation that provides the 
basis for subdividing Great Zimbabwe's 
history into at least three stages. 
The most intensive occupation began in 
about the eleventh century; but no stone 
walls were built until the thirteenth century, 
when the small pole-and-mud huts of 
earlier times were replaced by more sub- 
stantial mud houses. The stone retaining 
wall for the western enclosure was also built 
at that time, as more imports appear in the 
deposits. It was during the thirteenth or 
fourteenth century, also, that the first 
buildings were constructed in the valley 
below the Acropolis. 
The Great Enclosure with its massive 
free-standing walls was built progressively 
during the following century. The enclosing 
wall of the Great Enclosure has an average 
height of 7.3 metres, is 5.5 metres thick at 
the base and between 1.3 metres and 3.6 
metres at the top. A length of 52 metres is 
"decorated with a chevron pattern. Inside is 
an unfinished enclosure wall which was evi- 
dently replaced by the present one and 
which helps to form a narrow defile bet- 
ween the two walls, leading to a skilfully 
constructed conical tower that dominated

the Great Enclosure. The Great Enclosure 
itself was divided into a series of smaller 
enclosures, in which the foundations of 
substantial pole-and-mud houses are to be 
seen. It was presumably the dwelling place 
of the rulers of Great Zimbabwe, an 
impressive and politically highly significant 
structure. 
Great Zimbabwe 1s a unique site only on 
account of its scale, for it is the largest of an 
estimated 150 ruins in the granite country 
that forms the Zambezi-Limpopo water- 
shed. There are other ruins with between 
one and five enclosures, at least partially 
surrounded with free-standing walls and 
with mud-and-pole huts inside them, built 
near Zimbabwe and in Mashonaland. The 
regularly coursed masonry is in the Great 
Zimbabwe style. Those that have been exca- 
vated contain occasional gold objects,   
copper-wire bracelets, glass beads, and the 
fire pots and spindle whorls characteristic 
of the Great Zimbabwe culture. At the 
Ruanga and Chipadze ruins, cattle were 
important. Five of the excavated ruins have 
produced dates that suggest they were all 
built and occupied between the beginning 
of the fourteenth and the end of the fif- 
teenth centuries. Some have been dated as 
late as the sixteenth century. 
All these ruins are small, having had but 
a minimal population. They were normally 
built near hills that were a plentiful sourcep»

South of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, 
rise the massive stone ruins of Great Zim- 
babwe. Settled by Iron Age peoples as early 
as the 10th or 11th century, by 1300 Great 
Zimbabwe had become the centre of a 
powerful and influential State. Chinese, 
Persian and Syrian china, glass and 
porcelain have been unearthed in the ruins 
and on other sites nearby, indicating that 
the Great Zimbabwe complex played an im- 
portant role in the East African coastal 
trade which by the I4th century reached far 
into the interior of the continent. Above

formed by the outer rampart and an un- 
finished inner wall which runs part way 
along it. Great Zimbabwe was built using 
abundant local granite. Its architecture is 
considered to be an extension of the 
enclosures and chief’s quarters which in 
other African States were constructed from 
grass, mud and poles.

p of stone. Too small to be viable economic 
units, they were probably built by external 
labour from surrounding villages that were 
- able to support themselves by shifting agri- 
culture on the savannah. 
At Nhunguza ruins there was a single, 
very large hut, divided into three rooms. 
One of the rooms was large enough to hold 
a large number of people, a second con- 
tained a single seat, a third was a ‘“‘com- 
pletely secluded room that must have con- 
tained objects of special value including... 
what must have been a monolith set in a 
grooved stone platform’. This unusual 
structure may well have been the location 
where a prominent religious authority held 
sway, an authority that was not only the 
reason for the building of the isolated 
enclosure, but also the human cement that 
held together the Great Zimbabwe State. 
One has a sense of an extremely strong 
and unquestioned political and religious 
authority whose hold over the scattered 
rural population was based on some form 
of unifying faith in the powers of the divine 
Mwari or some other religious catalyst that 
reached out to every family. 
The borders of the Great Zimbabwe State 
are still ill-defined, although its heartland 
was in central Mashonaland. Some Great

Zimbabwe-style ruins occur in what is now 
Matabeleland, where Great Zimbabwe peo- 
ple infiltrated Leopard’s Kopje territory. 
The influence of Great Zimbabwe and its 
tributary settlements were felt far outside 
the immediate, relatively limited boun- 
daries of the State itself. The prosperity of 
Kilwa on the East African coast was closely 
tied to the fluctuations in the gold trade 
with Sofala. Already in the tenth century 
the Arab geographer al-Mas’udi was 
writing of Kilwa and the gold trade. Four 
centuries later Ibn Battuta described Kilwa 
as one of the most beautiful cities in the 
world, a town whose prosperity depended 
on the southern gold trade. 
Without question the wealth of the rulers 
of Great Zimbabwe waxed and waned with 
the fortunes of the coastal trade. Kilwa 
itself went through commercial vicissitudes, 
reaching the height of its prosperity in the 
fifteenth century with the reconstruction of 
the famous Great Mosque and its elaborate 
domed and vaulted roof. But a century later 
Kilwa, the east African coast and Great 
Zimbabwe itself had all declined. By the 
time the Portuguese arrived at Sofala the 
coastal trade was but a shadow of its former 
self. For all its isolation, Great Zimbabwe's 
trading connexions and the gold within its 
borders contributed not only to prosperity

and economic growth on the east African 
coast, but also in much remoter lands as 
well. 
In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, 
however, there was considerable trading ac- 
tivity in northern Mashonaland and the 
Zambezi valley, which is reflected in some 
remarkable archaeological discoveries. 
This region was settled during the Early 
Iron Age, which survived until the end of 
the first millennium. Between the twelfth 
and fourteenth centuries northern 
Mashonaland was occupied by the makers 
of Musengezi ware, subsistence farmers 
with minimal trading contacts, thought to 
be Shona speakers. Their culture is a far cry 
from the wealth of their southern 
neighbours at Great Zimbabwe, although 
more trade goods occur in later Musengezi 
settlements. 
But the same is certainly not true of the 
extreme north-western corner of 
Mashonaland and the lower part of the 
middle Zambezi valley, where large set- 
tlements and the working and trading of 
copper assumed great importance. The 
Chedzurgwe site in the fertile Urungwe 
district covered over 24 hectares of fine 
grassland; abundant cattle and game bones 
testify to the importance of pastoralism and 
hunting. But copper and iron-working was 
of considerable significance, both ores be- 
ing abundant nearby. Copper was made in- 
to standardized ingots of two fixed weights; 
wire bracelets made from copper and tin 
alloy were commonplace. Textiles were also 
in use, and extremely fine pottery was 
made, with a finish and delicacy of decora- 
tion on shallow bowls and beakers that is 
almost unparalleled elsewhere.

it is known from Chi- 
nese sources that in 
628, under the T'ang 
dynasty, official envoys 
from Black Africa arriv- 
ed in China with per- 
fumes and ivory. They 
are depicted in frescoes 
in the decorated grot- 
toes (5th to 10th cen- 
tury) of Dunhuang, in 
Kansu province, one of 
the masterpieces of 
Buddhist art. Among 
the personages por- 
trayed in this mural, 
evoking the “‘Lamenta- 
tion for Buddha in Nir- 
vana'’, scholars of the 
Dunhuang Institute see 
in the dark-skinned 
figure with curly hair (to 
the right of the third row 
from the bottom) the im- 
aginary representation 
of an African. 
From the twelfth to the sixteenth century, Africa 
played a major role in intercontinental rela- 
tions, particularly in the Mediterranean region 
and, via the Indian Ocean, with Asia. 
The Mediterranean. Although there was some 
trade in such products as nuts, pepper and 
ivory, it was through the gold and slaves torn 
from its bosom that the African presence 
became most clearly visible in the Mediterra- 
nean economy. As early as the end of the tenth 
century, Spanish Christians had begun to ob- 
tain gold from the south and gold continued to 
flow towards north Africa until the end of the fif- 
teenth century. From the thirteenth century on- 
wards the profits accumulated. An active mer- 
chant class came into being in the great Chris- 
tian ports of the Mediterranean and in certain 
large cities such as Milan and Florence. The 
“thirst for gold” in an expanding Western 
economy was io acceierate the search for the 
gold routes to the interior of the African con- 
tinent and it is reasonable to assume that a by 
no means negligible proportion of African gold 
found its way into the European commercial 
circuit. 
Asia. According to ancient historians, intense 
commercial activity already existed in the 
twelfth century on the east African coast. This 
trading activity expanded considerably during 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Ivory, 
collected in the interior and much sought after 
for the Muslim, Chinese and Indian markets, 
hides, iron and gold constituted the most im- 
portant export products. Gold from the south, 
exported through Sofala but marketed at Kilwa, 
assumed a dominant place in this trade. 
Ships brought various products to this coast: 
cowrie shells, new plants, clothing and glass 
beads. This was mainly a coastal trade carried 
in ships which probably used Kilwa as their 
home port. Muslim ships sailed from Mombasa 
or Malindi to Asia every year and played an im- 
portant part in developing navigation tech- 
niques which improved considerably from the 
thirteenth to the fifteenth century. African 
sailors were employed on coasters and other 
ships plying between Asia and Africa, at least 
if certain paintings on manuscripts are to be 
believed. 
Over fifty towns, from Cape Gardafui to 
Sofala, demonstrated the vitality of urban 
development in the Swahili zone, even before 
the arrival of the Arabs. One of the most 
prosperous of these towns was Kilwa whose 
four- and five-storey houses are described by 
fifteenth-century Chinese sources. 
The Chinese visited this coast of Africa in 
force during the fifteenth century. There is 
evidence too of the arrival of Africans in China, 
possibly as early as the sixth or seventh cen- 
tury. Paintings of the T'ang era show Black 
Africans in Buddhist grottoes and a thirteenth- 
century compilation probably refers to Swahili. 
country. As early as 1402, a Korean map gave 
an approximately correct outline of southern 
Africa. In addition to the slave trade, Chinese 
sources mention four major articles exported 
from east Africa: gold, amber, yellow san- ° 
dalwood and ivory. [|

### IGNORE

HE results of archaeological excavations 
carried out in 1977 and 1981 on an an- 
cient site near the city of Jenné, in Mali, 
have contradicted previous assumptions about 
the history of west Africa by pushing back the 
date of the emergence of this city which 
became one of the region's most prosperous 
trading centres, by almost a thousand years. 
The archaeological site of Jenné-jeno (‘‘an- 
cient Jenné” in the local Songhay language) 
lies three kilometres south of the modern city of 
Jenné, on a floodplain of the inland Niger Delta 
rich in fish, cereals (especially rice and millet), 
and livestock. 
Food has for centuries been produced in 
abundance in the hinterland, supplying the 
population of Timbuktu further north, to which 
Jenné is linked by 500 kilometres of navigable 
riverway. The gold trade route originating in the 
forested region of West Africa passed through 
the two cities and then crossed the Sahara to 
north Africa. 
  
Until the excavations, directed by two 
American archaeologists, husband-and-wife 
Roderick J. Mcintosh and Susan Keech Mcin- 
tosh, it was generally accepted that Jenné had 
developed simultaneously with Timbuktu 
(founded around 1100) in the mid-thirteenth 
century as an artifact of the trans-Saharan 
trade which brought urbanism to west Africa. 
However, excavations carried out on the 
main site, a thirty-three-hectare artificial 
mound formed of ruins of buildings and the 
debris of human occupation, and an extensive 
reconnaissance of sites in a surrounding area 
of 1,100 square kilometres, have revealed that 
a settlement already existed at Jenné-jeno as 
early as the third century BC and was inhabited 
by a population which made iron and practised 
trade. By 800 AD Jenné-jeno had become a 
prosperous cosmopolitan centre with a popula- 
tion of some 10,000 people. 


### 59237: West Africa's oldest metropolis

West Africa’s 
In the course of the centuries the city’s trade 
expanded and diversified. Jenné-jeno iin- 
ported from far away stone, iron ore, copper 
from the Sahara and, around 600-800 AD, gold. 
In return for these goods, the rich city had 
various products and foodstuffs to barter, 
notably rice (African rice, Oryza glaberrima, 
was cultivated at Jenné-jeno as early as the 
first century AD), fish, and fish oil. 
The key to the city’s success was a combina- 
tion of food production and craftsmanship. By 
the year 50 AD the settlement extended over 
twelve hectares. In 300 AD it had expanded to 
some twenty-five hectares, and around 750 it 
covered thirty-three hectares and was girded 
by a wall some two kilometres long, 3.6 metres 
wide and four metres or more high. 
At the height of its development, between 
750 and 1150, it is thought that Jenné-jeno and 
its nearby satellite villages may have had 
almost 20,000 inhabitants, and that the density 
of settlement in its hinterland may have been 
ten times higher than today.

The city’s decline is thought to have begun 
around 1200. The fact that it was abandoned 
around 1400 for the site of present-day Jenné 
may perhaps be explained by the desire of a 
new Muslim trading élite to change their 
capital. 
The discoveries at Jenné-jeno, along with 
others such as the eighth-century ‘‘bronzes” 
from Igbo-Ukwu in Nigeria open up major new 
historical perspectives. It is now known that 
long-distance trade and urbanism existed in 
west Africa in the first millennium AD. It is also 
established that Jenné-jeno played a central 
role in the creation of the great trade-routes 
between the Sahara and the Niger Bend and 
was not, as was previously believed, a later off- 
shoot of the trans-Saharan salt and gold trade. 
The early urban settlements of the inland Niger 
Delta are thus seen to rank among the world’s 
great known civilizations. m

### 59238: The Colonial challenge

The colonial challenge 
EVER in the history of Africa have 
N so many changes occurred, with 
such speed, as during the period 
1880 to 1935. Indeed, the most fundament- 
al and most tragic of these changes took 
place between 1890 and 1910, the twenty- 
year period that saw the conquest and occu- 
pation of virtually the whole continent of 
Africa by the imperial powers and the 
establishment of the colonial system—the 
following twenty-five years being essen- 
tially a period of consolidation and exploi- 
tation of the system. 
The pace at which this drama unfolded 
was astonishing. As late as 1880, in the 
whole of west Africa, only the island and 
coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Free- 
town and its environs, the southern parts of 
the Gold Coast (Ghana), the coastal areas 
of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and Porto 
Novo in Dahomey (Benin) and the island of 
Lagos had come under the direct rule of 
Europeans. In northern Africa, only Al- 
geria had by then been colonized by the 
French, Not an inch of eastern Africa had 
come under European control, while in cen- 
tral Africa only the coastal stretches of 
Mozambique and Angola were subject to 
Portuguese rule. 
It was only in south Africa that foreign 
rule had not only been firmly implanted but 
also extended a considerable distance 
inland. In short, in 1880, some 80 per cent 
of the continent of Africa was still being 
ruled by her own kings, queens and clan and 
lineage chiefs, in empires, kingdoms, com- 
munities and political units of every size 
and kind. 
Within the next thirty years, however, 
this situation underwent a dramatic change. 
By 1914, the whole of Africa, with the 
exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, was sub- 
ject to the rule of European powers. 
What was the attitude of the Africans 
themselves to the establishment of colonia- 
lism? The answer is quite clear and unequi- 
vocal; the overwhelming majority of Afri- 
can leaders and authorities were vehemently 
opposed to this change and expressed their

enough, then come and fetch me.” 
Hendrik Wittboi, a king in south west 
Africa, told the Germans in 1894: 
‘“The Lord has established various king- 
doms in the world, therefore I know and 
believe that it is no sin or crime that I should 
wish to remain the independent chief of my 
land and people.” 
Makombe Hanga, of Mozambique, also 
told a white visitor in 1895: 
“I see how you white men advance more 
and more in Africa; on all sides of my 
country companies are at work. My country 
will also have to take up these reforms and 
I am quite prepared to open it up... I should 
like to have good roads and railways, but I 
will always remain the Makombe my 
fathers have been.” 
In 1895, Wobogo, the King of the Mossi, 
told the French Captain Destenave: 
“I know the Whites wish to kill me in 
order to take my country, and yet you claim 
they will help me organize my country. But

for me and what I want. I have my own 
merchants. Consider yourself fortunate 
that I do not order your head to be cut off. 
Go away now and, above all, never come 
back.” 
Most fascinating of all was the moving 
appeal addressed by Menelik II of Ethiopia 
to Queen Victoria in April 1891. In his ap- 
peal, Menelik first declared his intention of 
re-establishing the former boundaries of 
Ethiopia and then continued: 
‘1 have no intention at all of being an in- 
different spectator, if the distant Powers 
hold the idea of dividing up Africa, 
Ethiopia having been for the past fourteen 
centuries an island of Christians in a sea of 
pagans. Since the All-Powerful has pro- 
tected Ethiopia up until now, I am hopeful 
that He will keep and enlarge it also in the 
future, and I do not think for a moment 
that He will divide Ethiopia among the 
other Powers. Formerly the boundary of 
Ethiopia was the sea. Failing the use of 
force and failing the aid of the Christians, 
our boundary on the sea fell into the hands 
of the Muslims. Today we do not pretend to 
be able to recover our sea coast by force, 
ALBERT ADU BOAHEN, of Ghana, is a pro- 
fessor and head of the department of history 
at the University of Legon, Ghana. He is a 
specialist in west African colonial history, a 
subject on which he has written numerous 
studies and articles. ) 
  
but we hope that the Christian Powers, ad- 
vised by our Saviour, Jesus Christ, will 
restore our sea coast boundary to us, or that 
they will give us at least a few points along 
the coast.” 
When, in spite of this appeal, the Italians 
launched their campaign against Ethiopia 
with the connivance of Britain and France, 
Menelik again issued a mobilization pro- 
clamation in September 1895 in which he 
stated: 
‘‘Enemies have now come upon us to ruin

these rulers were confident of their 
preparedness to face the European in- 
vaders, and well they might have been. 
Many of them had been able to build up 
huge empires only a decade or two earlier 
and some were still in the process of ex-

» Menelik of Ethiopia, had even managed to 
modernize their armies. Furthermore, some 
thought they could hold off invaders by 
diplomacy. 
It is also clear from some of the quota: 
tions above that many African rulers 
welcomed the changes that had been steadi- 
ly introduced since the third decade of the 
nineteenth century for hitherto they had 
posed no threat to their sovereignty and in- 
dependence. In west Africa, for instance, 
thanks to the activities of the missionaries, 
Fourah Bay College had been founded as 
early as 1826, while elementary schools and 
a secondary school had been established by 
the 1870s in both the Gold Coast and 
Nigeria. As early as 1887 wealthy Africans 
had even begun sending their children to 
Europe for further education and profes- 
sional training. 
As far as the Africans were concerned, 
then, they did not see the need for any 
radical change in their centuries-old rela- 
tions with Europe, and they were confident 
that, if the Europeans wanted to force 
change upon them and push their way in- 
16 
  
  
   
  
   
  
land, they would be able to stop them as 
they had been able to do in the past. 
What the Africans did not realize, 
however, was that, by 1880, thanks to the 
industrial revolution in Europe and the 
subsequent technological progress 
represented by the steamship, the railway, 
the telegraph and, above all, the Maxim 
gun, the old era of free trade and informal 
political control had given way to what 
Basil Davidson has described as ‘‘the era of 
the new imperialism and rival capitalist 
monopolies’’. It was not only trade that the 
Europeans now wanted, but also direct 
political control. 
Secondly, the African leaders failed to 
realize that their muzzle-loading muskets 
were totally outmoded and no match for the 
Europeans’ breech-loading rifles. 
The consequences were tragic. All the 
chiefs quoted above except one were 
defeated. Only Menelik succeeded in 
defeating the Italian invaders and retaining 
his sovereignty and independence.

Born in 1844, at Ankober in central 
Ethiopia, Menelik II was one of the greatest 
of Ethiopia’s rulers and the most successful 
of the leaders of African resistance to the 
colonial invaders. In 1865 he became king 
of Shewa and in 1889 assumed the imperial 
crown. As king, and later as emperor, he in- 
corporated large areas of southern Ethiopia 
into his domains and undertook a vast pro- 
gramme of modernization. He had the 
foresight to equip his army with modern 
weapons and this enabled him to resist inva- 
sion by the Italians whom he defeated 
decisively in 1896 at the battle of Adowa, 
one of the great battles in the history of 
Africa. He died in December 1913, having 
succeeded in maintaining his country’s in- 
tegrity and independence in face of the 
onslaught of European colonialism.

### 59239: The Scramble for territory

The scramble for ferrifory 
LTHOUGH by the end of the third 
A quarter of the nineteenth century 
France, Britain, Portugal and Ger- 
many had acquired commercial interests 
and were exercising considerable influence 
in different parts of Africa, their direct 
political control in the continent was ex- 
tremely limited. 
Britain, in particular, and Germany were 
wielding all the influence they wanted, and 
no statesman in his senses would choose to 
incur the costs and court the unforeseen 
contingencies of formal annexation when 
the same advantages could be obtained 
from informal control. 
This attitude began to change, however, 
as a result of three main factors which emer- 
ged during the period 1876 to 1880. 
The first was the convening by King Leo- 
pold of Belgium of the so-called Brussels 
Geographical Conference which resulted in 
the setting up of the African International 
Association and the employment of Henry 
Morton Stanley to explore the Congo in the 
name of the Association. These moves cul- 
minated in the creation of the Congo Free 
State, whose recognition by the European 
nations Leopold managed to obtain before 
the Berlin West African Conference ended 
its deliberations. 
The second factor was a sudden flurry of 
Portuguese activity. Piqued by the fact that 
 
GODFREY N. UZOIGWE, of Nigeria, is pro- 
fessor of history at the University of Michigan, 
Ann Arbor, USA. A specialist in east African 
history, and in particular on the former 
Bunyoro kingdom jn Uganda, he has written 
several studies and articles on African history.   
by Godfrey N. Uzoigwe 
she had been invited to the Brussels Con- 
ference only as an afterthought, from 
1876 onwards Portugal despatched a 
series of expeditions which by 1880 had 
resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese 
Crown of the hitherto virtually independent 
estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers of 
Mozambique. 
The third and final factor was the expan- 
sionist mood which characterized French 
colonial policy between 1879 and 1880, as 
signified by her participation with Britain in 
the dual control of Egypt (1879), the des- 
patch of Savorgan de Brazza into the 
Congo and the ratification of his treaties 
with Chief Makoko of the Bateke, and the 
revival of colonial initiatives both in Tuni- 
sia and Madagascar. 
These moves on the part of France and 
Portugal between 1876 and 1880 clearly 
indicated that they were now committed to 
colonial expansion and establishment of 
formal control in Africa; it was this that 
finally compelled both Britain and Ger- 
many to abandon informal ‘control and 
influence in favour of formal control and 
led to their annexations in southern, eastern 
and western Africa from the end of 1883 
onwards. 
  ais A i ——— A ITI 
  
  
  
By the early 1880s, the scramble for terri- 
tory was well under way and it was out of 
fear of being pushed out of Africa alto- 
gether that Portugal proposed the calling 
of an international conference to sort out 
territorial disputes in the area of central 
Africa. 
The idea of an international conference 
to settle the territorial disputes arising from 
European activities in the Congo region, 
suggested by Portugal, was later taken up 
by Bismarck. The conference was held at 
Berlin between 15 November 1884 and 26 
November 1885. The news that such a con- 
ference was to be held increased the inten- 
sity of the scramble. The conference did not 
seriously discuss either the slave trade or the 
lofty humanitarian ideals that were sup- 
posed to have inspired it. Delegates conten- 
ted themselves with passing empty resolu- 
tions regarding the abolition of the slave 
trade and the welfare of Africans. 
It was not, ostensibly, the initial inten- 
tion of the conference to attempt a general 
partition of Africa. It nevertheless ended up 
disposing of territory, passing resolutions 
concerning the free navigation of the Niger, 
the Benue and their affluents, and laying 
down ‘‘the rules to be observed in future p 
Delegates from 15 
nations at the West 
African Conference, 
convened in Berlin in 
November 1884, 
which laid down ‘‘the 
rules to be observed in 
Juture with regard to 
the occupation of 
territory on the coasts 
of Africa’.

### 59239: The Scramble for territory

p with regard to the occupation of territory 
on the coasts of Africa’. 
According to Article 34 of the Berlin Act, 
any European nation which took possession 
of an African coast or declared a ‘‘protecto- 
rate’’ there, would have to notify such 
action to the signatories of the Act in order 
to have its claims ratified. This was the so- 
called ‘sphere of influence’ doctrine, to 
which was linked the absurd concept of the 
‘“‘hinterland’’ which came to be interpreted 
to mean that possession of a coast also 
implied ownership of its hinterland to an 
almost unlimited distance. 
Article 35 stipulated that an occupier of 
such coastal possessions must also 
demonstrate that it possessed sufficient 
authority there ‘‘to protect existing rights 
and, as the case may be, freedom of trade 
and of transit under the conditions agreed 
upon’’. This was the so-called doctrine of 
“‘effective occupation’ that was to make 
the conquest of Africa such a murderous 
business. 
Indeed, by recognizing the Congo Free 
State, by permitting territorial negotiations 
and by laying down rules and regulations 
for ‘‘legal’”’ appropriation of African ter- 
ritory, the Concert of Europe had ar- 
rogated to itself the right of sanctioning the 
principle of sharing-out and conquering 
another continent. 
There was no precedent in world history 
to' justify one continent boldly talking 
about the sharing-out and occupation of 
the territory of another continent. This was 
the major significance of the conference for 
African history. The argument that, con-

trary to popular opinion, the conference 
did not partition Africa is correct only in 
the most technical sense; in any case it is ir- 
relevant. The appropriation of territory did 
take place at the conference and the ques- 
tion of future appropriation is clearly im- 
plied in its decisions. By 1885, in fact, the 
broad outlines of the final partition of 
Africa had already been drawn. 
Prior to the Berlin Conference, spheres 
of influence had been acquired by settle- 
ment, exploration, the establishment of 
commercial posts, the occupation of 
strategic areas and treaties with African 
rulers. Following the Conference, influence 
by treaty became the most important 
method of effecting the paper partition of 
the continent. These treaties took two 
forms—those between Africans and Euro- 
peans, and bilateral agreements between the 
Europeans themselves. The African- 
European treaties were basically of two 
kinds. First, there were the slave trade and 
commercial treaties, and, secondly, there 
were the political treaties by which African 
rulers either purportedly surrendered 
sovereignty in return for protection or 
undertook not to enter into treaty obliga- 
tions with other European nations. 
African leaders entered into these ar- 
rangements for a variety of reasons. In 
some cases they hoped that the prestige of 
such a relationship would give them 
political advantages in dealing with their 
neighbours. An African sovereign might 
desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep 
recalcitrant subject States in line. 
Sometimes a weak African State would 
desire a treaty with a European power in the 
hope of using it to renounce allegiance to an 
African overlord or as a means of warding 
off a threat to its independence from 
another European power.

(1) Probably fashioned between the 12th 
and the 15th century, this terracotta man's 
head (height 17.5 cm) is an example of the 
out standing statuary art of Ife, in the south- 
west of present- day Nigeria. In marked con- 
trast to this naturalistic treatment of the 
human face is a highly stylized, cylindrical, 
terracotta figurine (2) on which only the hair 
(or head-dress), eyes and mouth are 
represented. Some 19 cm in height, it was 
once thought to be an example of an earlier 
phase in Ife art, but it probably also dates 
from between the 12th and the 15th century. 
The highly original bronze art of Igbo-Ukwu 
(south-east Nigeria) dates back to the 9th 
century. In spite of certain common features 
it is very different from the later bronzes of 
Ife-Benin, as is shown by this pendant (3) in 
the form of two eggs with chains, beads and 
bells (height 21.6 cm). The bronze plaque 
(4), 47 cm high, probably dates from the 
16th century, a period of great fertility for 
the art of Benin (15th-18th century). The 
figure depicted in this stylized composition 
of head, hands and legs is thought to repre- 
sent the ‘messenger of death’’. (For the art 
of Ife, Igbo-Ukwu, Benin, and Nok, see arti- 
cle page 5).

Africa is an epic of heroic resistance 
against tremendous odds. It was a 
struggle in which, in virtually every respect, 
the dice were heavily loaded in favour of the 
European invaders. 
In the first place, thanks to the activities 
of European explorers and missionaries, by 
1880 Europeans were far more knowledge- 
able about Africa, its topography and 
resources and the strengths and weaknesses 
of its States and societies, than Africans 
were about Europe. 
Secondly, owing to the revolutionary 
changes in medical technology, and in par- 
ticular the discovery of the prophylactic use 
of quinine against malaria, Europeans 
became far less fearful of Africa than they 
had been before the middle of the nine- 
teenth century. 
Thirdly, the material and financial 
resources of Europe were overwhelming in 
comparison with those of Africa. Thus, 
while Europe could afford to spend mil- 
lions of pounds on overseas campaigns, 
Africa could not sustain any protracted 
military confrontation with Europe. 
T- story of the military conquest of 
Fourthly, while the period following the 
Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878 was mar- 
  
  
ked, according to historian J. Holland 
Rose, by ‘‘a state of political equilibrium 
which made for peace and stagnation in 
Europe’’, in Africa it was marked by inter- 
State and intra-State conflict and rivalry— 
the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the 
Asante against the Fante, the Baganda 
against the Bunyoro, the Batooro against 
the Bunyoro, the Mashona against the 
Ndebele. 
Thus while Europe could focus its atten- 
tion on imperial activities without any 
major distractions at home, African States 
and countries had their attention divided. 
Moreover, divided though the European 
States were on imperial and colonial issues, 
throughout the era of partition and right up 
to 1914, they always resolved these ques- 
tions without resort to war, except in the 
single case of the conflict between the 
British and the Boers in south Africa. 
Despite competition and crisis, therefore, 
the European powers involved in the parti- 
tion of Africa displayed a remarkable spirit 
of solidarity which not only eliminated wars 
among them but also prevented the African 
rulers and communities from playing one 
European power off against another. 
Throughout this period, various European 
powers took on the African powers one at p

» a time and never was an African State as- 
sisted by another European country. 
The behaviour of the African States, 
however, was marked, by and large, by lack 
of solidarity, unity or co-operation. Some 
did not hesitate to ally themselves against 
their neighbours, only to be vanquished 
later in their own turn. The Baganda allied 
themselves with the British against the 
Bunyoro and the Barotse with the British 
against the Ndebele while the Bambara 
teamed up with the French against the 
Tukulor. 
The final and easily the most decisive fac- 
tor was, of course, the overwhelming logis- 
tic and military superiority that Europe 
enjoyed over Africa. While Europe had at 
its disposal well-drilled, professional 
armies, very few African States had estab-

lished standing armies and fewer still had 
professional armies. Furthermore, the 
Europeans could always rely on African 
mercenaries and levies to give them the 
numerical superiority they needed. 
Above all, under the Brussels Convention 
of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to 
sell arms to Africans. This meant that most 
African armies were armed with outmoded 
guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading 
muskets and had no heavy artillery or naval 
power whatsoever. 
The European armies, on the other hand, 
had the support of their navies and were 
armed with the most up-to-date heavy artil- 
lery, repeater rifles and, above all, Gatling 
and Maxim machine-guns. Towards the 
end, they were using motor vehicles and 
even aeroplanes. It is significant that

The period of the colonial conquest of 
Africa coincided with technical advances in 
arms manufacture which revolutionized 
warfare and gave the European powers an 
overwhelming firepower advantage over 
African resistance fighters. The introduc- 
tion during the second half of the 19th cen- 
tury of breech-loading rifles and metal- 
cartridge ammunition enormously increas- 
ed the range, accuracy and rate of fire of the 
individual rifleman and signalled the end of 
cavalry as an effective military force. Even 
more striking was the evolution of the 
machine-gun with the invention, in par- 
ticular, of the Gatling gun (see previous 
page), in 1862, and the Maxim gun (left), in 
1883. With their outdated muzzle-loaders, 
throwing axes and spears, even the largest 
and most dedicated African armies were no 
match for the small, well-disciplined, 
highly-trained European expeditionary 
forces equipped with these deadly new 
weapons. 
Samori and Menelik, the two African 
leaders who succeeded in inflicting some 
defeats on the Europeans, were the two who 
managed to obtain a certain quantity of up- 
to-date weapons. The overwhelming mili- 
tary superiority that Europe enjoyed over 
Africa was succinctly summed up in this 
couplet by the British poet Hilaire Belloc: 
Whatever happens, we have got 
The Maxim gun, and they have not. 
In view of all these economic, political 
and, above all, military and technological 
advantages enjoyed by Europe over Africa, 
the contest was a most uneven one and its 
outcome was inevitable. Indeed, for 
Europe, the timing of the conquest could 
not have been better; for Africa it could not 
have been worse.

### 59260: North Africa: the long struggle

North Africa: the long struggle 
by Abdallah Laroui 
  
CE 
  
HE nineteenth century colonialist 
drive in north Africa was unusual in 
being a sequel to earlier campaigns. 
For four centuries the Moroccan Govern- 
ment had been resisting the Spaniards who 
had established themselves at Ceuta and 
Melilla. Moroccans were forbidden to have 
anything to do with the Spaniards and it 
was to break this blockade that Spain 
launched the war of 1859-1860 that was to 
be so disastrous for Morocco. By the end of 
the century, with the Bay of Rio de Oro, 
whose occupation was notified on 26 
December 1884 to the signatories to the Act 
of Berlin on the division of Africa into 
zones of influence, Spain had three bridge- 
heads on the north African coast. 
In 1880 and 1881, when the Madrid Con- 
ference on the granting of *‘protection’’ to 
individuals in Morocco met in two sessions, 
the Makhzen (the government of Morocco, 
and in a more general sense the country’s 
religious and political élite) made a last 
attempt to get its independence and sov- 
ereignty over a clearly defined territory 
accepted at the international level. Despite 
British support, the attempt failed in face of 
a self-seeking alliance of France, Spain and 
Italy. 
Immediately after the conference, 
France, which for a time had thought that 
all was lost in Morocco, raised the problem 
of the Tuat oases. There was much talk in

Saharan railway line that would open up 
central Africa to French trade. But the plan 
ran up against a serious obstacle. The oases 
of the central Sahara were politically depen- 
dent on Morocco. France tried to win over 
the Sultan but, buttressed by British sup- 
port, he rejected the French demands while 
at the same time strengthening his adminis- 
trative and political presence at Tuat. 
In the east of the Maghreb, the Tunisians 
had for centuries been fighting the Italians, 
just as the Moroccans had been fighting the 
Spanish. A unified Italy had designs on the 
Regency of Tunis, where it. sent immi- 
grants, invested capital and propagated its 
culture. But the real danger threatening 
Tunisia came from the French who had 
already been established in Algeria for over 
half a century. ' 
Following the setbacks he had suffered in 
Algeria, the Sultan in Constantinople had 
decided to bring Tripolitania and Cyrenaica 
back under his direct administration and to 
regain his political influence in Tunisia. 
There was considerable pro-Ottoman feel- 
ing among the élite in the Regency, but the 
Bey, who saw in the Sultan’s moves a threat 
to his prerogatives, turned to Italy and 
France for support. This more or less deli- 
berate line of conduct proved fatal to him. 
When the French Government took advan- 
tage of a favourable political conjuncture 
to attack the country, the Bey found him- 
self isolated both at home and abroad and 
with no option but to sign a treaty, on 12 
May 1881, placing himself under a French 
protectorate. 
However, the inhabitants of the Sahel 
and of the religious capital of Kairouan at 
once revolted, hoping for a rapid Ottoman   
intervention. A second French expedition 
was then raised which was to meet strong 
resistance in the mountainous areas of the 
north-west, the centre and the south. Sfax 
and Gabes were bombarded by naval units, 
Kairouan withstood a long siege during the 
autumn of 1881, and the southern territo- 
ries, near Tripolitania, for long remained 
an insecure zone. 
Italy maintained her claims on the 
country, but the Tunisians obviously could 
not play that card. However, they remained 
faithful to Islamic sovereignty and this was 
to be one of the foundations of early Tuni- 
sian nationalism. 
Up until the general agreement of April 
1904 between France and Britain, the Euro- 
pean powers with an interest in the Magh- 
reb contented themselves with keeping their 
claims alive, occasionally grabbing bits of 
territory as security. At the end of the reign 
of Hassan I, the war of 1893 enabled Spain 
to consolidate her gains of 1860 in the 
neighbourhood of Melilla. 
Seven years later, at the end of the regen- 
cy of the vizier Ba Ahmad, France judged 
that the time was ripe finally to settle the 
Tuat problem to her advantage. On the 
pretext of scientific exploration, a strong 
expedition gradually approached the 
coveted oases and, in December 1899, ap- 
‘ peared before In Salah and demanded im- 
mediate surrender. The local chief, ap- 
pointed by the Sultan of Morocco, backed 
by the soldiers of the Makhzen and assisted 
by the sherifs of In Salah, put up a fierce 
resistance. After a series of bloody battles, 
such as that of In Ghar, on 27 December 
1899, where, given the disparity between 
the two sides the outcome was never in 
doubt, the whole oasis region was con-»

### 59260: North Africa: the long struggle

»quered, the final battle taking place at 
Talmin in March 1901. 
Alerted by the young Sultan Abd al-Aziz, 
Britain and Germany advised him to accept 
the fait accompli; this he did, signing under 
duress the draft treaty of 20 April 1902. In 
return for this major concession, he tried to 
have the line of demarcation in the south 
and east between Morocco and the French 
possessions clearly defined; but his efforts 
were unsuccessful since the French prefer- 
red a certain imprecision which offered her 
the prospect of further conquests. 
The loss of Tuat was one of the main 
reasons for the break-up of the Sultan’s 
authority which continued to crumble until 
1911. The Makhzen knew that France 
planned to encircle Morocco in order to 
isolate and subjugate it. It also knew that 
Britain no longer opposed the French 
designs and that it could no longer count on 
Germany for anything but diplomatic help; 
Germany did indeed uphold Moroccan in- 
dependence until November 1911, when it 
signed an agreement with France giving the 
latter a free hand in Morocco in exchange 
for compensations in equatorial Africa. 
Having always refused to define the fron- 
tier with Morocco beyond the Figuig oasis, 
France pursued a policy of nibbling away   
slowly at Moroccan territory. Working 
their way up the valley of the Sawra, French 
forces gradually occupied the territory bet- 
ween Wadi Gir and Wadi Zusfana on the 
pretext of ending lawlessness and insecurity 
and allowing frontier trade to expand. The 
French Government also proposed that the 
Makhzen should share with it customs 
receipts, and this was agreed in March 1910. 
I 
Further south France had imposed her 
protectorate on the Emirs of the Trarza and 
the Brakna. Then, in 1905, Xavier Cop- 
polani introduced the policy of *‘peaceful 
penetration’’, which took the form of mak- 
ing direct contact with the ethnic and 
brotherhood chiefs with a view to winning 
them over to French influence. He found 
himself up against a worthy opponent in 
Shaykh Ma’al-Aynayn who, for more than 
thirty years, had been the Sultan’s unof- 
ficial representative. The Sultan, Mulay 
Abd al-Aziz, was informed and sent his 
uncle Mulay Idris who galvanized the 
. resistance forces. Meanwhile, Coppolani’s 
camp at Tidiikdja was attacked in April 
1905 and the apostle of peaceful penetra- 
tion was killed, 
Taking advantage of the internal crisis 
racking Morocco, France demanded the 
recall of Mulay Idris, which it obtained in   
January 1907. Nevertheless, resistance con- 
tinued. A strong expedition led by Colonel 
Gouraud moved northwards. It suffered a 
severe reverse at Al-Muynam on 16 June 
1908, but succeeded in entering Atar on 9 
January of the following year. Shaikh 
Ma’al Aynayn withdrew with his followers 
into the Sakiyat al-Hamra, from where his 
forces continued to harass the French and 
the Spanish until 1933. 
During the same period Spain was ad- 
vancing in the wake of the French. When 
France occupied Shinkit, the Spanish struck 
out from their settlement on the Bay of Rio 
de Oro; in 1906, they organized a Saharan 
intervention force which penetrated thirty 
kilometres inland. In the north, the Spanish 
waited until the French entered Wadjda, in 
1907, before mounting a 45,000-strong ex- 
pedition which, in September 1909, set out 
to conquer the Rif, In response, galvanized 
by Shaykh Ameriyan’s call for a holy war, 
the Moroccan people mounted a fierce 
resistance which was to last until 1926.

The Italian Occupation of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania 
The Italian colonial drive was directed 
against the Ottoman-controlled regions of 
Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. On 28 
September 1911, Italy presented an 
ultimatum to Constantinople complaining 
of Ottoman negligence, and in October 
landed armies at Tripoli, Benghazi, Homs 
and Tobruk, The Turks were soon obliged 
to withdraw from the country, but the

Italians were unable to subdue the local 
population, organized under the banner of 
Ahmad al-Sharif (below right), the spiritual 
leader of the Islamic fraternity known as 
the Sanusiyyah. In 1913, the Italians laun- 
ched an attack on Ahmad al-Sharif’s forces 
south of Derna, but, on 16 May, they suf- 
Jered a stunning defeat at the battle of 
Yawm al-Djuma. Sanusiyyah resistance to   
the Italians continued for two decades, 
notably under the leadership of Umar al- 
Mukhtar (below left). Despite such drastic 
Italian measures as the mass imprisonment 
of the population in concentration camps, 
this resistance was only finally broken with 
the capture and execution of Umar al- 
Mukhtar in 1931.

### 59261: West Africa: the fight for survival

West Africa 
The fight for survival 
by M’Baye Gueye and Albert Adu Boahen 
high-water mark of European con- 
quest and occupation of west Africa. 
There were French campaigns in the west- 
ern Sudan, Ivory Coast and Dahomey bet- 
ween 1880 and 1898, and British campaigns 
in Asante, the Delta region and in northern 
Nigeria between 1895 and 1903. 
During this period, practically all Afri- 
cans had the same objective, that of defend- 
ing their sovereignty and traditional way of 
life, but the strategies and methods they 
adopted varied. Three options were open to 
the Africans, confrontation, alliance or 
acquiescence and submission. The strategy 
of confrontation involved open warfare, 
sieges, guerilla tactics, scorched-earth poli- 
cies, as well as diplomacy. 
From 1880, the French adopted a policy 
of extending their control over the whole 
region from the Senegal to the Niger and 
then Chad and linking these areas with their 
posts on the Guinea coast in Ivory Coast 
and Dahomey. 
In their occupation of west Africa, the 
French resorted almost exclusively to the 
method of military conquest, rather than 
the conclusion of treaties as the British did. 
In terms of African reaction, all the options 
open to them, namely submission, alliance 
and confrontation, were resorted to. How- 
ever, far more of the rulers opted for the 
strategy of militant confrontation than for 
submission and alliance, and opposition 
here was far more protracted than any- 
where else in west Africa for two main 
reasons. The first was that as already in- 
dicated, the French themselves used the 
military option almost exclusively and this 
evoked a militant reaction. The second rea- 
son was that the people were far more Isla- 
mized than those of other areas of west 
Africa and, as one scholar, M. Crowder has 
pointed out, since ‘for Muslim societies of 
west Africa the imposition of white rule 
meant submission to the infidel which was 
intolerable for any good Muslim’, they 
tended to resist the Europeans with added 
fervour and a tenacity often lacking among 
non-Muslims. 
These general observations are well illus- 
trated in the history and person of Samori 
Touré, the valorous leader of the Mandingo 
Empire.

history at the University of Dakar. He 
specializes in the history of west Africa in the 
19th and 20th centuries and is the author of 
several works on the slave trade and French 
colonization. 
ALBERT ADU BOAHEN (for biographical 
details see page 15).   
[One of the great resistance heroes of the 
colonial era, Samori Touré was born in 
about 1830, near Sarranko in present-day 
Guinea. A Dyoula and a Muslim, he 
succeeded in gaining the support of the 
Mandingo people and patiently began cons- 
tructing an empire which, at its height in the 
early 1880s, stretched from the Upper Volta 
region in the west to the Fouta Djallon in 
the east.) 
Samori Touré chose the strategy of con- 
frontation and not of alliance though he 
used the weapons of both diplomacy and 
warfare but with the emphasis on the latter. 
By 1881, Samori had already converted 
“‘the southern part of the Sudanese savan- 
nah all along the great west African forest”’ 
between the northern parts of modern 
Sierra Leone to the Sassandra River in the 
Ivory Coast, into a single empire under his 
unquestioned authority.   
Unlike the Tukulor Empire, the Man- 
dingo Empire was still on the ‘‘up-swing”’ 
by 1882 when the first encounter between 
Samori and the French occurred. The con- 
quest of the area had also enabled Samori to 
build a powerful army relatively well- 
equipped with European arms. This army 
was divided into two wings, the infantry 
wing (the Sofa) which by 1887 numbered 
between 30,000 and 35,000 men and the 
cavalry wing numbering not more than 
3,000 by 1887. 
The infantry was divided into permanent 
units of 10 to 20 men known as the sé (feet) 
or kulu (heaps) commanded by a kuntigi p 
Samori Touré at the time of his capture by 
Captain Gouraud (seen right) at Guelemou 
on 29 September 1898. (See also colour

» (chief), and ten se formed a bolo (arm) 
under the command of a bolokuntigi. The 
cavalry was divided into bands of 50 called 
séré. The bolo formed the main striking 
force while the séré rode alongside each 
bolo. Since these units were permanent, its 
members developed feelings of friendship 
first among themselves and of loyalty first 
to their local leader and then to Samori. 
Thus, the army soon assumed ‘‘a quasi- 
national character because it achieved a 
very remarkable homogeneity”’. 
What was unique about Samori’s army 
was the standard of its weapons and train- 
ing. Unlike most of the armies of west 
Africa, not only was this army virtually 
professional, but it was armed by Samori 
himself. Up to 1876, he armed them with 
old guns which the local blacksmiths could 
repair themselves. But from 1876 onwards, 
he also began to order more modern Euro- 
pean weapons mainly from Sierra Leone 
and carefully studied them to find those 
that were most suitable for his area. Thus 
from 18835, he replaced the Chassepot rifles 
whose big cartridges soon rotted in the 
humidity of the area with the more suitable 
  
  
Gras rifles with lighter cartridges and 
Kropatscheks which were Gras repeater 
rifles. 
He continued to rely on these two till the 
1880s since he was able to train a group of 
blacksmiths who could effectively copy 
those rifles. From 1888, he also added to his 
stock some of the new quick-firing rifles 
and by 1893 he had about 6,000 of them 
which he used till his defeat. However, he 
never acquired any artillery which was a 
great handicap in his campaigns against the 
French. 
Samori was virtually at the height of his 
power when he first came into contact with 
the French in 1882. In February of that 
year, he was called upon by Lieutenant 
Alakamessa who notified him of the order 
from the Upper Senegal-Niger high com- 
mand to withdraw from Kenyeran, an im- 
portant market-centre which controlled 
Samori’s route to the Mandingo areas. 
As might have been expected, Samori 
refused. This led to a surprise attack on his 
army by the French commander Borgnis- 
Desbordes who was forced to beat a hasty 
retreat. Samori’s brother, Kémé-Brema, at- 
Resistance in the Niger Delta 
In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas 
of Nigeria, the British had by 1884 signed 
treaties of protection with most of the Delta 
chiefs. While some chiefs allowed mis- 
sionaries to operate in their States others 
did not, but all of them insisted on their 
sovereign right to regulate trade and to levy 
duties on British traders. This the new 
British consuls such as Hewett and Johnson 
would not tolerate, Jaja of Opobo (left), 
one of the wealthiest and most powerful of 
the Delta chiefs, insisted on payment of 
duties by British traders and ordered a com- 
plete stoppage of trade on the river until one 
British firm agreed to pay duties. The con- 
sul, Johnson, ordered him to stop levying 
duties, but instead of complying Jaja 
despatched a mission to the Colonial Office 
to protest against the order. In 1887, when 
Jaja still refused to comply in spite of 
Johnson's threats to bombard his town, 
Johnson enticed him aboard a ship under a 
promise of safe conduct, but then arrested 
him and sent him to Accra where he was 
tried and deported to the West Indies. 
Stunned by this treatment the other chiefs 
surrendered and accepted governing coun- 
cils imposed on them by Johnson.

tacked the French at Wenyako near 
Bamako in April. Though he won the battle 
on 2 April, he was defeated on 12 April by 
a much smaller French army. Samori 
thereupon tried to avoid conflict with the 
French and directed his action towards 
Kenedugu. 
In 1885, when Combes occupied Bure, 
the gold of which was important to the 
economy of his empire, Samori realized 
how great was the threat that hung over his 
State. He resolved to expel the French from 
the area by force. Three armies, his own 
and those of Kémé and Masara-Mamadi, 
. were charged with this operation. By a vast 
pincer movement, Bure was easily recap- 
tured and the French were forced to decamp 
for fear of being encircled. 
Samori thereupon decided to cultivate his 
relations with the British in Sierra Leone. 
After having occupied Falaba in 1884, he 
dispatched emissaries to Freetown, to pro- 
pose to the governor that he place his entire 
country under the protection of the British 
Government. The offer was a mere 
manoeuvre on the part of Samori, whose in- 
tention was in no way to relinquish his 
sovereignty but to make the French respect 
it by allying himself with a powerful 
government, 
When that move failed, Samori turned to 
the French and signed a treaty with them on 
28 March 1886. He agreed to withdraw his 
troops to the right bank of the Niger, but 
maintained his rights over Bure and the 
Mandingo of Kangaba. In another treaty 
with the French on 25 March 1887 which 
amended that of the previous year, Samori 
ceded the left bank of the river to the 
French and even agreed to place his country 
under French protection. 
Samori had perhaps signed the other 
document in the hope that the French 
would help him against Tieba, the Faama of 
Sikasso whom he attacked in April 1887 
with a 12,000 strong army, while the French 
had signed it because they needed to prevent 
any alliance between Samori and the 
Soninké leader Mamadou Lamine whom 
they were then fighting. When he saw that 
instead of behaving as allies and assisting 
him, the French were rather encouraging 
dissidence and rebellion in the areas recent- 
ly subdued and were attempting to prevent 
him from obtaining supplies of weapons 
from Sierra Leone, he raised the siege of 
Sikasso in August 1888 and prepared to 
take up arms against the invader. 
He reorganized the army, concluded a 
treaty with the British in Sierra Leone in 
May 1890 which enabled him to buy 
modern weapons for the next three years in 
increasing quantities, and trained his troops 
in the European manner. Platoons and 
companies were activated. He adopted 
defence as his military tactic. Of course, 
there could be no question of using the tatas 
(earth-walled settlements) for shelter, as 
there was no chance that they could hold 
out against artillery. His strategy consisted 
of endowing his troops with great mobility, 
so that they could surprise the enemy, in- 
flict heavy losses upon him, and disappear. 
In March 1890, Archinard captured 
Segou and in his attempt to defeat Samori 
before ceding the Upper Senegal-Niger 
command to Humbert, attacked him in 
March 1891. Archinard thought that

### 59261: West Africa: the fight for survival

Samori’s empire would collapse at the first 
onslaught. Though that attack resulted in 
the capturing of Kankan on 7 April and the 
burning of Bisandougou, its effect was 
quite the opposite since it not only provided 
Samori with a salutary warning but it enabl- 
ed him also to continue the attacks on the 
French at Kankan and to defeat them at the 
battle of Dabadugu on 3 September 1891. 
The major confrontation between the 
French and Samori, however, took place in 
1892. Bent on defeating Samori, Humbert 
launched an attack on the central part of the 
Empire in January 1892 with 1,300 careful- 
ly picked riflemen and 3,000 porters. 
Samori took personal command of his 
carefully chosen army of 2,500 men to meet 
Humbert. Though these men, *‘fighting like 
demons, clung fiercely to every defensive 
point on the way’’, to quote historian Yves 
Person’s words, they were defeated and 
Humbert succeeded in capturing Bisan- 
dougou, Sanankoro and Kerwane. 
Humbert himself admitted, however, that 
the results were meagre in comparison to 
the heavy losses that he had sustained. Fur- 
thermore, Samori had ordered the civil 
population to withdraw at the approach of 
the French troops. 
However, Samori had no illusions. After 
the violent encounters with the Humbert 
column in which he lost over a thousand 
men of his élite units as compared with only 
about a hundred lost by the French, he 
became convinced of the futility of con- 
fronting the French. There were then two 
options open to him: either to surrender or 
to withdraw. He ruled out the former and 
decided to abandon his homeland and move 
to the east to create a new empire out of the 
reach of the Europeans. 
Still continuing his scorched earth policy, 
he began his move eastwards towards the 
Bandama and the Comoe rivers. Though in 
1894 he lost the last route supplying him 
with modern weapons, which was the one to 
Monrovia, he nevertheless fought on. At 
the beginning of 1895, he encountered and 
beat back a French column coming from 
the Baule country under the command of 
Monteil, and between July 1895 and 
January 1896 went on to conquer the Abron 
(Gyaman) kingdom and the western part of 
Gonja. By that time, he had succeeded in 
creating a new empire in the hinterland of 
the Ivory Coast and Asante. 
In March 1897, his son Sarankenyi-Mori 
met and defeated a British column under 
the command of Henderson near Wa while 
Samori himself attacked and destroyed 
Kong in May 1897 and pushed on to Bobo 
where he encountered a French column 
under the command of Caudrelier. 
Caught between the French and the 
British and having vainly attempted to sow 
discord between them by returning to the 
latter the territory of Bouna coveted by the 
former, Samori decided to return to his 
Toma allies in Liberia. On the way, he was 
captured in a surprise attack at Guelemou 
by Gouraud on 29 September 1898 and 
deported to Gabon where he died in 1900. 
His capture brought to an end what a recent 
scholar has described as ‘“the longest series 
of campaigns against a single enemy in the 
history of French Sudanese conquest”’. 
H M’Baye Gueye and Albert Adu Boahen   
The Hut Tax Rebellion 
The Hut Tax Rebellion of 1898 was the 
response of the Temne and Mende peoples 
of Sierra Leone to the consolidation of 
British rule by the appointment of District 
Commissioners, the expansion of the Fron- 
tier Police, the abolition of the slave trade 
and slavery, the Protectorate Ordinance of 
1896 and finally, the imposition of a tax of 
five shillings a year on all two-roomed 
houses and ten shillings on all larger houses 
in the Protectorate. All the Temne chiefs 
refused to pay the tax and rose up in 
rebellion under one of their number, chief 
Bai Bureh. They were joined by almost 
three-quarters of the Protectorate. The 
rebel forces attacked and looted trading sta- 
tions and killed British officials and troops 
and all those suspected of assisting the col- 
onial government. By May 1898, the rebel 
armies were within about 25 miles of 
Freetown and two companies of troops had 
to be hastily brought in from Lagos to de- 
fend the town. What was the true nature of 
this revolt? The British Governor of Sierra 
Leone attributed not only this rebellion but 
the general resistance to colonial rule that 
  
  
was raging at the time to ‘‘the growing 
political consciousness of the African and 
his increasing sense of his worth and 
autonomy’. As he put it, ‘‘the native is 
beginning to feel his strength from the value 
that is set on him for products of his coun- 
try and his labour by the white man and in 
Suture the latter will not be able to trade so 
much on his simplicity and ignorance of the 
world as in the past’’. Above, a sketch by a 
British army officer of the rebel leader, Bai 
Bureh, after his capture.

### 59264: East Africa: diplomacy and defiance

East Africa: diplomacy and defiance 
HE colonialist scramble for east 
] Africa was three-pronged, involv- 
ing, as it did, three competing 
powers: the Sultanate of Zanzibar, Ger- 
many and Britain. The first on the scene 
were the Arabs who operated from Zan- 
zibar. Their interests both on the coast and 
in the interior were largely commercial, 
revolving around the trade in slaves and 
ivory. Before the 1880s and 1890s, these 
Arabs and Swahili traders were content to 
operate from the coast. But during the clos- 
ing decades of the last century, Arab in- 
terests in the interior of east Africa began to 
be threatened by German and British in- 
terests that had been steadily penetrating 
the area. In the face of this, the Arabs at- 
tempted to take political control of some 
areas in order to protect their commercial 
concessions. 
The Europeans in the interior included 
traders and missionaries, all of whom 
wanted the occupation of east Africa by 
their home governments in order to provide 
them with security as well as a free hand to 
carry out their enterprises without 
hindrance. 
The methods of European advance 
varied from place to place. But, on the

whole, they were characterized by the use of 
force combined with, where it was possible, 
diplomatic alliances with one group against 
another. The African response to all this 
was both military and diplomatic; though 
at times there was withdrawal or non-co- 
operation or passivity.

the coast of Tanganyika, as of Kenya, was 
dominated by Swahili and Islamic culture. 
Here existed a mixed population of Arabs 
and Africans who intermarried freely and 
carried out local trade. 
In the nineteenth century, the coastal 
Arabs increased their activities in the in- 
terior in response to increased demand 
for ivory and slaves. The result of this 
flourishing trade was that many towns 
sprang up along the coast. The coming of 
the Germans threatened this trade which 
they sought to supplant with their own. The 
local populations, especially the Arabs, 
resented this and organized a resistance. 
Abushiri, the leader, was born in 1845 of 
an Arab father and a Galla mother. He was 
a descendant of one of the first Arab settlers   
on the coast who came to regard themselves 
as local people. Like many others, he op- 
posed the influence of the Sultanate of Zan- 
zibar on the coast and even advocated in- 
dependence. As a young man, he had org- 
anized expeditions into the interior to trade 
in ivory. From the profits made, he bought 
himself a farm and planted sugar cane. 
Under his leadership, the coastal people 
fired on a German warship at Tanga in 
September 1888 and then gave the Germans 
two days to leave the coast. They later at- 
tacked Kilwa and killed the two Germans 
there and then attacked Bagamoyo with 
8,000 men on 22 September. But the Ger- 
mans who termed this ‘‘the Arab revolt” 
sent out Hermann von Wissmann. He 
reached Zanzibar in April 1889, attacked 
Abushiri in his fortress near Bagamoyo and 
drove him out. Abushiri escaped nor- 
thwards to Uzigua where he was betrayed 
and handed over to the Germans who hang- 
ed him at Pangani on 15 December 1889. 
The coastal resistance finally collapsed 
Railways were an important instrument of 
the colonizing process; they facilitated 
military conquest, helped establish political 
control and enabled the colonies to be 
developed as sources of raw materials for 
export to Europe rather than as areas of in- 
dustrial development. The British-built 
Uganda Railway, which linked the interiors 
of Uganda and Kenya with the coast, reach- 
ed the Lake Victoria basin in 1901. In 
Tanganyika a German-built railway was 
started at Tanga during the early 1890s and 
reached the foothills of the Usambara 
mountains in 1905. Below, a plate-laying

### 59264: East Africa: diplomacy and defiance

when Kilwa was bombarded and taken by 
the Germans in May 1890. 
The Germans, like the British in Kenya, 
were practiced in the art of divide and rule 
by allying with one group against another. 
There were many such allies. The Marealle 
and the Kibanga near the Tanganyikan 
mountains of Kilimanjaro and Usambara 
were, to name but two examples, among 
those who saw in the Germans an oppor- 
tunity to make friends in order to defeat 
their enemies. These people, like others 
such as the Wanga in Kenya, believed that 
they were using the Germans even though in 
the process they were made use of much 
more by the Germans than perhaps they 
realized. The Arabs on the coast, however, 
were firmly in the employ of the Germans as 
they were in that of the British in Kenya and 
they provided the first local personnel in the 
service of imperialism, 
A similar pattern of response to British 
colonialism took place in Uganda. The 
period between 1891 and 1899 saw a clash 
between the forces of Kabarega, the King of 
Bunyoro and those of Lugard and other 
British agents. After some clashes in which 
his forces were defeated, Kabarega turned 
to diplomacy. Twice he attempted to come 
to terms with Lugard, but the latter would 
not countenance these gestures. Mwanga, 
the Kabaka of Buganda, at times tried to in- 
tercede on behalf of the Bunyoro King but 
to no avail. Eventually, Kabarega resorted 
to guerilla warfare, probably the first of its 
kind in East Africa. He withdrew from 
Bunyoro to the Lango country in the north 
from where he harassed British forces time 
and again. 
One of the British officials occupying 
Bunyoro at the time, Thurston, com- 
mented: ‘‘Kabarega was at his old tricks— 
giving every possible trouble but never 
standing up for a fair fight, preferring to 
pursue his favourite methods of assassina- 
tion. Kabarega caused poison to be given to 
a friendly chief and he died, but I have had 
the poisoner killed”’. 
What Thurston says here is a perfect ex- 
ample of guerilla tactics, of withdrawing to 
a neighbouring country in order to harass 
occupying forces in one’s own country. 
Kabarega was later joined in Lango by 
Mwanga, but their hide-out was stormed in 
1899 and both kings were captured and 
taken to Kisimayu where Mwanga died in 
1903. EH Henry Mwanazi

to the Seychelles and Mwanga to Kisimayu, 
where he died in 1903. Both rulers resisted 
British colonialism with a mixture of 
diplomacy, direct confrontation and 
guerilla warfare.

### 59269: The Colonial heritage

Y 1935, colonialism had been 
B fastened on Africa like a steel! grid, 
and it looked as if it was going to 
remain there for ever. However, colonia- 
lism proved just as ephemeral as any other 
institution created and maintained by force. 
Within a matter of only some forty-five 
years from 1935, the colonial system had 
been uprooted from over ninety per cent of 
Africa and confined to that part of the con- 
tinent south of the Limpopo River. 
What legacy did colonialism bequeath to 
Africa? Did it constitute an important revo- 
lutionary episode in the history of the conti- 
nent? Was it a major break with the past, or 
was it, after all, merely a passing event? 
  
To some historians its impact was on 
balance either a blessing in disguise or, at 
worst, not harmful for Africa: 
“It is easy to cavil today’ wrote 
P.C. Lloyd, ‘“at the slow rate of economic 
development during the half-century of 
colonial rule... Nevertheless, the difference 
between the condition of African society at 
the end of the nineteenth century and at the 
end of the Second World War is staggering. 
The colonial powers provided the infra- 
structure on which progress in the ‘inde- 
pendence’ period has depended: a fairly 
efficient administrative machine, reaching 
down to villages in the most remote areas, 
a network of roads and railways, and basic 
services in health and education.’’ 
Others have contended that the beneficial 
effect of colonialism in Africa was virtually 
nil. The Black Guyanese historian, Walter 
Rodney, has taken a particularly extreme 
position: 
“The argument suggests that, on the one 
hand, there was exploitation and oppress- 
ion, but, on the other hand, that colonial »   
ALBERT ADU BOAHEN (for biographical 
details see page 15). 
“The phenomenal growth of the popula- 
tion of the urban centres {during the col- 
onial period] was not the result of the 
natural increase of the urban population 
but rather of the continuous pull of young 
men and women to the urban centres by the 
need for education and employment and 
the push from the rural areas by famine, 
epidemics, poverty and taxation.” 
Since independence the rapid growth of ur- 
ban centres in Africa has continued. Op- 
posite page, the modern face of Dakar, 
capital city of Senegal. 
“A huge gap exists even today between ur- 
ban and rural areas in Africa and there isno 
doubt that it was the colonial system that 
originated and widened this gap.’

The impact of colonialism on African art 
was neither profound nor permanent. Even 
when commenting on the colonial condi- 
tion, African artists drew on the continent’s 
age-old artistic traditions, as witness this 
tongue-in-cheek portrayal (inset left) by a 
wood-carver from the Congo (Zaire) of a 
1920s Belgian colonial official in his 
chauffeur-driven car.

### 59269: The Colonial heritage

‘“‘Because of the concentration on the pro- 
duction of cash crops during the colonial 
era, Africans were compelled to ignore the 
production of food for their own consump- 
tion. It was this neglect of food production, 
coupled with forced labour, which caused 
so much malnutrition, severe famine and so 
many epidemics in some parts of Africa 
during the early colonial days. Thus, under 
the colonial system, Africans were in most 
cases made to produce what they did not 
consume and to consume what they did not 
produce.’’ Above, harvesting the cotton 
crop in the Sudan. 
» governments did much for the benefit of 
Africans and that they developed Africa. It 
is our contention that this is completely 
false. Colonialism had only one hand—it 
was a one-armed bandit.”’ 
From the available evidence, however, it 
would appear that a much more balanced 
assessment is necessary. The impact of 
colonialism was positive as well as negative. 
However, it should be emphasized that 
most of the positive effects were, by and 
large, rather accidental by-products of acti- 
vities or measures intended to promote the 
interests of the colonizers. 
The first positive political impact was the 
establishment of a greater degree of con- 
tinuous peace and stability in Africa than 
before. The nineteenth century was the cen- 
tury of the Mfecane and the activities of the 
Swabhili-Arab and Nyamwezi traders such 
as Tipu Tip and Msiri in central and sou- 
thern Africa, of the Fulani djihads and the 
rise of the Tukulor and Mandingo empires 
in western Sudan, and of the disintegration 
of the Oyo and Asante empires in west 
Africa; and all this caused a great deal of 
instability and insecurity. 
The first two or three decades of the colo- 
nial era, that is from 1880 to 1910, intensi- 
fied this state of instability, violence and 
disorder and caused wholesale and unpar- 
donable destruction and loss of population. 
But after the colonial occupation and the 
establishment of various administrative 
machineries, most parts of Africa, espe- 
cially from the end of the First World War 
onwards, enjoyed a great degree of con- 
tinuous peace and security. 
The second positive impact is reflected in 
the very geo-political appearance of the 
modern independent States of Africa. In 
34 
  
place of the hundreds of independent clan 
and lineage groups, city-States, kingdoms 
and empires, without any clearly defined 
boundaries, were now established fifty new 
States with, in most cases, fixed bounda- 
ries; and it is rather significant that the 
boundaries of the States as laid down 
during the colonial era have not undergone 
any changes since independence. 
Thirdly, the colonial system also intro- 
duced into most parts of Africa two new in- 
stitutions which have been maintained since 
independence, namely a new judicial system 
and a new bureaucracy or civil service. 
The final positive impact of colonialism 
was not only the birth of a new type of 
African nationalism, but also of pan- 
Africanism. Important as this legacy was, 
however, it is a typical example of the ac- 
cidental by-products rather than the 
deliberate creations of the colonial 
presence. No colonial ruler ever set out to 
create and nurture African nationalism. 
But if there were positive effects, the 
negative effects were even greater. In the 
first place, important as the development of 
nationalism was, it was generated by a sense 
of anger, frustration and humiliation 
caused by some of the oppressive, 
discriminatory and exploitative measures 
introduced by the colonial rulers. With the 
overthrow of colonialism that feeling was 
bound to lose some of its momentum and 
the problem that has faced the rulers of in- 
dependent African States has been how to 
replace it with a positive and enduring fecl- 
ing of nationalism. 
Secondly, while admitting that the geo- 
political set-up that emerged was an asset, 
even though an accidental one, it never- 
theless created far more problems than it 
solved. Though the boundaries of the States 
that emerged were not as arbitrary as is 
generally believed, there is no doubt that 
many of the States that emerged were ar- 
tificial creations made up of a medley of 
peoples with different cultures, traditions, 
origins and languages. The problems of 
nation-building posed by such a medley of 
peoples have not proved to be easily 
soluble. 
Another outcome was that the States that 
emerged were of widely differing sizes with 
unequal natural resources and economic 
potentialities. 
Another important but negative political   
impact of colonialism was the weakening of 
the indigenous systems of government. The 
colonial officials on the spot became, in ef- 
fect, dictators instead of advisers to the 
traditional rulers whom they used to en- 
force some of the measures deemed obnox- 
ious by their subjects, such as forced 
labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruit- 
ment of men for the colonial armies. 
Moreover, the spread of the Christian 
religion further undermined the spiritual 
basis of the authority of the kings. 
A product of colonialism which is often 
ignored by historians but which has turned 
out to be of crucial importance was the 
creation of full-time, standing armies. 
These armies were originally created, most 
of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the 
conquest and occupation of Africa, then 
for the maintenance of colonial control, 
and, finally, for the prosecution of global 
wars and the suppression of independence 
movements in Africa. After the overthrow 
of the colonial rulers, these armies were not 
disbanded but were taken over by the new 
independent African rulers and they have 
turned out to be the most problematic of the 
products of colonialism. 
The final and probably the most impor- 
- tant negative political impact of colonialism 
was the loss of African sovereignty and in- 
dependence and the right to deal directly 
with the outside world. 
This meant, above all, the loss of their 
right to control their own destiny, to plan 
their own development, manage their 
economy, determine their own strategies 
and priorities, borrow freely from the 
world at large the latest and most ap- 
propriate technology, and generally 
manage, or even mismanage, their own af- 
fairs and derive inspiration and a sense of 
fulfilment from their successes and lessons 
and experience from their failures. In short, 
colonialism deprived Africans of one of the 
most fundamental and inalienable rights of 
a people—the right of liberty. 
Moreover, the seventy-year period of col- 
onialism in Africa was the very period 
which witnessed tremendous and decisive 
developments and changes in both the 
capitalist and socialist countries. It was the 
period, for instance, that saw the entry of 
Europe into the age of the aeroplane and 
the motor vehicle and the nuclear age. Had 
Africa been in control of her own destiny, 
she could have benefited from or even been

### 59269: The Colonial heritage

“Closely associated with the spread of 
Christianity was that of Western education. 
Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, 
there were relatively few areas without at 
least elementary schools... The curricula 
provided by these institutions were deter- 
mined by the colonial rulers and were close- 
ly modelled on, if not carbon copies of, 
those of the metropolitan countries and 
therefore irrelevant to the needs of the con- 
tinent.”’ Right, the Church Missionary 
Society High School, Mengo, Uganda. 
part of these phenomenal changes. But col- 
onialism completely insulated and isolated 
her from these changes and kept her in a 
position of dependency. 
The impact in the economic field was 
equally important and equally mixed. The 
first and most obvious of the positive im- 
pacts was the provision of. a basic in- 
frastructure of roads, railways, telegraph, 
telephone and, in some cases, even airports. 
Completed by the 1930s, this infrastructure 
facilitated the movement not only of goods, 
the new cash crops and troops, but also of 
peoples, and this latter factor helped to 
minimize parochialism, regionalism and 
ethnocentricism, 
Equally important and significant was 
the impact of colonialism on the primary 
sector of the economy. It was during the 
colonial period that the full mineral poten- 
tial of Africa was realized; the mining in- 
dustry boomed while the cultivation of cash 
crops such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, 
groundnuts, sisal and rubber spread. In 
west Africa these cash crops were produced 
by the Africans themselves, clear evidence 
of their willingness and ability to adapt and 
respond to the right incentives. 
This economic revolution had some far- 
reaching consequences. Before the colonial 
era huge tracts of land in many parts of 
Africa were not only under-populated but 
also under-utilized. The introduction and 
spread of cash crops and the mining in- 
dustries put an end to all this. Secondly, the 
economic revolution led to an increase in 
the purchasing power of some Africans and 
with it an increase in their demand for con- 
sumer goods. Thirdly, the growing of cash 
crops by Africans enabled individuals of 
whatever social status, especially in the 
rural areas, to acquire wealth. 
Another significant revolutionary impact 
was the introduction of the money 
economy. This led to the emergence of a 
new class of wage earners and salaried 
groups. The introduction of the money 
economy also led to the commencement of 
banking activities in Africa, which became 
another significant feature of the economy 
of independent African States. 
By 1935, the economy of Africa had 
become inextricably tied to that of the 
world in general and of the capitalist 
economy of the colonial powers in par- 
ticular. The years after 1935 merely deepen-   
ed this link and not even independence has 
fundamentally altered this relationship. 
Was the colonial impact on Africa in the 
economic field then a desirable one? Far 
from it. 
"In the first place, the infrastructure that 
was provided by colonialism was not as ade- 
quate or as useful as it could have been. 
Most of the roads and railways were con- 
structed not to open up the country but 
merely to connect the areas having mineral 
deposits and the potential for the produc- 
tion of cash crops with the sea, and there 
were hardly any feeder or branch roads. 
Nor were they meant to facilitate inter- 
African travel and communication. 
In the second place, such economic 
growth as occurred in the colonies was 
based on the natural resources of the area 
and this .meant, therefore, that areas not 
naturally endowed were totally neglected. 
Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial 
economy was the total and deliberate 
neglect or discouragement of industrializa- 
tion and the processing of locally-produced 
raw materials and agricultural products in 
most of the colonies. Simple and basic items 
such as matches, candles, edible oil, even 
lime and orange juice, all of which could 
easily have been produced in Africa, were 
imported. All African States were therefore 
turned into markets for the consumption of 
manufactured goods from the metropolitan 
countries and producers of raw materials 
for export. This total neglect of in- 
dustrialization by the colonial powers 
should be chalked up as one of the most un- 
pardonable indictments of colonialism. 
Fourthly, not only was industrialization 
neglected but such industries and crafts as 
had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times 
were almost destroyed as a result of the 
importation into Africa of cheap, mass- 
“produced commodities. African techno- 
logical development was thereby halted and 
was not resumed until after independence. 
Fifthly, even though agricultural crops 
came to constitute the main source of in- 
come for most African States, no attempts 
were made to diversify the agricultural 
economies of the colonies. On the contrary, 
by 1935, the production of only single or, at 
best, two cash crops had become the rule— 
cocoa in the Gold Coast, groundnuts in 
Senegal and Gambia, cotton in Sudan, cof- 
fee and cotton in Uganda and coffee and

sisal in Tanganyika. Most African States, 
on the attainment of independence, found 
themselves saddled with monoculture 
economies and were therefore highly sen- 
sitive to the prevailing international trade 
winds. Colonialism did indeed complete the 
integration of African economies into the 
world international economic order, but in 
a very disadvantageous and exploitative 
manner. 
Because of the concentration on the pro- 
duction of cash crops during the colonial 
era, Africans were compelled to ignore the 
production of food for their own consump- 
tion. It was this neglect of food production, 
coupled with forced labour, which caused 
so much malnutrition, severe famine and so 
many epidemics in some parts of Africa 
during the early colonial days. Thus, under 
the colonial system, Africans were in most 
cases made to produce what they did not 
consume and to consume what they did not 
produce, clear evidence of the lopsided and 
exploitative "nature of the colonial 
economy, 
The colonial presence also led to the ap- 
pearance on the African scene of an increas- 
ing number of expatriate banking, shipping 
and trading firms, and from the 1910s on- 
wards their amalgamation and consolida- 
tion into fewer and fewer oligopolies. Since 
it was these trading companies that con- 
trolled the export as well as the import trade 
and fixed the prices not only of imported 
commodities but also of the exports pro- 
duced by Africans, the huge profits that ac- 
crued from these activities went to the com- 
panies and not to the Africans, 
Colonialism also virtually put a stop to 
inter-African trade as the flow of trade 
from each colony was reoriented towards 
the metropolitan countries. 
Finally, whatever economic growth there 
was during the colonial period was achieved 
at a phenomenal and unjustifiable cost to 
the African—forced labour, migrant 
labour, compulsory cultivation of certain 
crops, compulsory seizure of land, forced 
movements of populations with the con- 
sequent dislocation of family life, the pass 
system, high mortality rates in the mines 
and on the plantations and brutal repres- 
sion of the protest and resistance 
movements these measures generated. 
What is the record of colonialism in the 
social field? The first important beneficial

During the colonial period, ‘‘In the rural 
areas, and even to some extent in the urban 
centres, new beliefs, new gods, new uten- 
sils, new artifacts arid new objects were 
added to the old ones. Certainly, in these 
areas many Christians did and still do retain 
their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, 
in the field of religion, it was if anything the 
European religions that were Africanized, 
as is obvious from the rituals of some of the 
syncretic and millenarian churches, and not 
the other way round’.

“Another highly regrettable social impact 
of colonialism was the deterioration that it 
caused in the status of women in Africa... 
There does not appear to be any doubt that 
women were inhibited from joining in most 
of the activities introduced or intensified by 
colonialism. The colonial world was indeed 
a man’s world and women were not en- 
couraged to play any meaningful role init.” 
Below, Fang mask from Gabon. 
  
» social effect was the overall increase of the 
population of Africa during the colonial 
period of nearly forty per cent after an in- 
itial decline during the first two or three 
decades. This increase was due to the 
establishment of an economic base, the 
spread of roads and railways which ensured 
that food could be rushed to famine areas, 
and the campaigns launched against 
epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, 
bubonic plague and yellow fever. 
Closely connected with this was . the 
second social impact of colonialism— 
urbanization, The kingdoms and empires of 
Africa had such capitals or political centres 
as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, 
Gao and Zimbabwe, commercial centres 
such as Kano, Jenné, Sofala and Malindi, 
and such educational centres as Timbuktu, 
Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that, 
as a result of colonialism, the pace of ur- 
banization was greatly accelerated and 
completely new towns came into existence. 
Moreover, the population of both the 
already existing towns and the new towns 
grew by leaps and bounds during the col- 
onial era.. The population of Nairobi, 
founded in 1896 as a transit depot for the 
construction of the Uganda railway, in- 
creased from a mere handful to 13,145 in 
1927 and to over 25,000 in 1940, and that of 
Lagos from 74,000 in 1914 to 230,000 in 
1950, that of Dakar from 19,800 in 1916 to 
92,000 in 1936 and to 132,000 in 1945. 
There was also undoubtedly an improve- 
ment in the quality of life, particularly for 
those living in the urban centres. This was 
the result of the provision of hospitals, 
dispensaries, pipe-borne water, sanitary 
facilities, better housing and the abolition 
of such practices as domestic slavery by the 
colonial rulers as well as the increase in 
employment opportunities. 
The spread of Christianity, Islam and 
Western education was another important 
impact of colonialism. It was during the 
colonial period that Christianity gained a 
firm foothold in eastern and central Africa, 
at times following and at times being 
followed by the flag and trade. Islam also 
spread rapidly in western and eastern 
Africa as a result of the general improve- 
ment in communications during the col- 
onial period and the patronage of both the 
French and the British rulers. It should be 
emphasized that these gains were not made 
at the expense of traditional religion. What 
colonialism did, then, was to strengthen 
and perpetuate religious pluralism in 
Africa, thereby enriching its religious life. 
Closely associated with the spread of 
Christianity was that of Western education. 
Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, 
‘there were relatively few areas without at 
least elementary schools. The spread of 
Western education had far-reaching social 
effects, among which was an increase in the 
number of the westernized educated 
African élite, an élite which now constitutes 
the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of 
the civil service of African States. 
Another important colonial impact, a 
mixed blessing as we shall see, was the pro- 
vision of a lingua franca for each colony or 
set of colonies. In all the colonies, the 
mother tongue of the colonial power, either 
in its pure or pidgin form, became the of- 
ficial and business language and, in many   
cases, the main means of communication 
between the numerous linguistic groups 
that constituted the population of each col- 
ony. It is significant that, except in north 
Africa, The United Republic of Tanzania, 
Kenya and Madagascar, these languages 
have remained the official languages to this 
very day. 
The final beneficial social impact was the 
new social structure that colonialism in- 
troduced into some parts of Africa or 
whose development it accelerated in others. 
Although the traditional social structure 
allowed for social mobility, its class struc- 
ture appeared to give undue weight to birth. 
The new colonial order, on the other hand, 
emphasized individual merit and achieve- 
ment. All these changes radically altered the 
traditional social structure. 
Thus, by the 1930s, in place of the pre- 
colonial social classes of the traditional 
ruling aristocracy, the ordinary people, 
domestic slaves and a relatively small 
educated élite, a new society emerged that 
had become more sharply divided than 
before into urban and rural dwellers, each 
of which was differently stratified. Mobility 
within this new structure was based more on 
individual effort and attainment than on 
ascription. 
On the negative side, however, the 
phenomenal growth of the population of 
the urban centres was not the result of the 
natural increase of the urban population 
but rather of the continuous pull of young 
men and women to the urban centres by the 
need for education and employment and 
the push from the rural areas by famine, 
epidemics, poverty and taxation. 
Moreover, since the Europeans tended to 
live in the urban centres, all those facilities 
that improved the quality of life were 
established only in those areas. The rural 
areas were therefore virtually neglected and 
this in turn accentuated the drift from one 
to the other. A huge gap exists even today 
between urban and rural areas in Africa and 
there is no doubt that it was the colonial 
system that originated and widened this 
gap. 
Nor did the migrants find the urban cen- 
tres the safe and rich haven they had ex- 
pected. In no town were the Africans ac- 
cepted as equals and fully integrated. 
Moreover, nowhere did a majority of them 
find jobs or decent accomodation, Most of 
them found themselves crowded into the 
suburbs and the shanty towns in which 
unemployment, juvenile delinquency, 
drunkenness, prostitution, crime and cor- 
ruption became their lot. Colonialism did 
not only impoverish rural life, it also 
bastardized urban life. 
A second serious social legacy has been 
the European and Asian settler problem. 
What made their presence so inimical to 
Africans was that the Europeans came to 
occupy most of the fertile lands while the 
Asians monopolized the retail and 
wholesale trades. By 1935, this Asian and 
European problem had assumed very 
serious proportions for Africa and it has 
not been entirely resolved to this day. 
Furthermore, though colonialism did in- 
troduce some social services as we have 
seen, it must be emphasized that not only 
were these services grossly inadequate and 
unevenly distributed in each colony, they 
were all, by and large, meant primarily for

the benefit of the few white settlers and ad- 
ministrators, hence their concentration in 
the towns. In Nigeria in the 1930s, whereas 
there were 12 modern hospitals for 4,000 
Europeans in the country, there were only 
52 for Africans numbering over 40 million. 
In the field of education, what was pro- 
vided during the colonial days was grossly 
inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly 
orientated and therefore not so beneficial as 
it could have been for Africa. Five different 
types of educational institutions were 
established under colonial rule: primary, 
secondary, teacher-training, technical and 
university. But while many primary schools 
had been established by 1860 in British 
West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the 
first secondary schools were established in 
the Gold Coast and Nigeria. It was not until 
after the Second World War that technical 
schools and university colleges were 
established in most parts of Africa. 
The curricula provided by all these in- 
stitutions were determined by the colonial 
rulers and were closely modelled on, if not 
carbon copies of, those of the metropolitan 
countries and therefore irrelevant to the 
needs of the continent. They also struck at 
the very roots of African religious beliefs, 
sanctions and taboos and thereby shook the 
foundations of African societies, bringing 
in their trail a sense of uncertainty, frustra- 
tion and insecurity. 
The impact of this inadequate, lopsided 
and wrongly orientated education on 
African societies has been profound and 
almost permanent. First, it left Africa with 
a huge illiteracy problem, a problem whose 
solution will take a long time. Secondly, the 
educated élite that was produced was, by 
and large, an alienated élite that adored 
European culture and civilization and look- 
ed down on African culture. However, 
since the élite included the wealthiest people 
and since they occupied the highest posts 
available both during and after the colonial 
era, they came to wield power and influence 
out of all proportion to their numbers. 
Beneficial as the linguae francae pro- 
moted through the educational -systems 
were, they had the regrettable consequence   
of preventing the development of some of 
the indigenous languages into national 
languages. Twi, Hausa and Swahili could 
easily have been developed as the national 
languages of the Gold Coast, Nigeria and 
the three British East African colonies 
respectively. In fact, an attempt was made 
by the colonial administrators of British 
East Africa to develop Swahili as a lingua 
franca during the 1930s and 1940s, but this 
attempt was countermanded by the Col- 
onial Office. 
Another highly regrettable social impact 
of colonialism was the deterioration that it 
caused in the status of women in Africa. 
This is a new theme which needs further 
research, but there does not appear to be 
any doubt that women were inhibited from 
joining in most of the activities introduced 
or intensified by colonijalism. The colonial 
world was indeed a man’s world and 
women were not encouraged to play any 
meaningful role in it. 
Moreover, under colonialism Africans in . 
general were looked down upon, humiliated 
and discriminated against both overtly and 
covertly. In his recent Reith lectures, Ali 
Mazrui emphasized this legacy of humilia- 
tion imposed on the African by the triple 
sins of the slave trade, apartheid and col- 
onialism when he declared: 
“Africans are not necessarily the most 
brutalized peoples, but they are certainly 
the most humiliated in modern history.” 
Some historians have concluded that 
‘‘colonialism produced its own grave- 
diggers’’, while Maugham has maintained 
that ‘‘On the tombstone of the British Em- 
pire may be written ‘Lost by snobbery’’. 
Worse still was the impact of colonialism 
in the cultural field. Throughout the col- 
onial period, African art, music, dancing 
and even history were all not only ignored 
but positively discouraged or denied. As 
one speaker declared at the Second Con- 
gress of Negro Writers and Artists, in 
Rome, in 1959: ‘““Among the sins of col- 
onialism, one of the most pernicious, 
because it was for a long time accepted by 
the West, was the concept of people without 
culture.”   
‘“The educated élite that was produced [by 
colonial education] was, by and large, an 
alienated élite that adored European culture 
and civilization and looked down on 
African culture. However, since the élite in- 
cluded the wealthiest people and since they 
occupied the highest posts available both 
during and after the colonial era, they came 
to wield power and influence out of all pro- 
portion to their numbers.’’ Above, toppers 
and frock-coats, picture hats and croquet 
on the lawn at Government House, all these 
were the status symbols of the ‘‘new élite”’ 
of the colonial period.

» Nevertheless, in the cultural field, the im- 
pact of colonialism was relatively speaking 
neither profound nor permanent. Such 
changes as were introduced in the cultural 
field, such racial discrimination as was 
practised, and such condemnation of 
African culture as was preached, even in the 
heyday of colonialism, were all confined to 
the coastal areas and the urban centres and 
never penetrated into the rural areas where 
life ran gaily on very much as before. 
African dance, art, music and traditional 
religious systems held their own and any 
borrowings and adaptations were additions 
rather than substitutions. 
In the rural areas, and even to some ex- 
tent in the urban centres, new beliefs, new 
gods, new utensils, new artifacts and new 
objects were added to the old ones. Certain- 
ly, in these areas many Christians did and 
still do retain their belief in their traditional 
gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, it was 
if anything the European religions that were 
Africanized, as is obvious from the rituals 
of some of the syncretic and millenarian 
churches, and not the other way round. 
What is more important, the ground that   
 
was lost in the field of culture, even in the 
urban centres, has virtually been regained. 
Today, African art, music and dance are 
not only taught in educational institutions 
of all kinds but are now booming in Africa 
and gaining recognition in Europe. Thus, as 
far as the cultural field is concerned, col- 
onialism was certainly only a brief episode 
and its impact skin-deep and ephemeral. 
From all the above it should be clear that 
it is an over-reaction to write off col- 
onialism as an unmitigated disaster for 
Africa that caused nothing but under- 
development and backwardness. Equally 
guilty of over-statement are those colonial 
apologists who see colonialism as an un- 
qualified blessing for Africa. 
But whatever colonialism did for 
Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, 
its resources and the power and influence it 
wielded in Africa at the time, it could and 
should have done more. As P.C. Lloyd 
wrote: : 
“So much more might perhaps have been 
done had the development of backward ter- 
ritories been seen by the industrial nations 
as a first priority.”   
Ornamental detail on the facade of a tradi- 
tional house of Senegal’s Sarakolé people. 
Traditional architecture using earth as a 
building material has qualities of form and 
insulation that are no longer found in 
modern dwellings made of rubble and cor- 
rugated iron sheeting. 
It is precisely because colonial rulers did 
not see the development of Africans as their 
first priority or even as a priority at all that 
they stand condemned. It is for these two 
reasons that the colonial era will go down in 
history as a period of growth without 
development, of the ruthless exploitation of 
the resources of Africa, and, on balance, of 
the pauperization and humiliation of the 
peoples of Africa. 
In the long history of Africa, colonialism 
was merely an episode or interlude in the 
many-faceted and variegated experiences of 
its peoples. It was nonetheless an extremely 
important episode politically, economically 
and even socially. It marks a clear water- 
shed in the history of Africa whose deve-. 
lopment has been and will continue to be 
very much influenced by the colonial im- 
pact. The most expedient course of action 
for African leaders to embark upon today, 
then, is not to write off colonialism, but 
rather to be conversant with its impact and 
to try to redress its shortcomings and its 
failures.

Africa which is being prepared under the 
intellectual responsibility of a 39-member 
international Scientific Committee for the 
Drafting of a General History of Africa, two- 
thirds of whose members are African. Africa 
is considered as a totality in this panoramic 
history which shows the changing 
relationships between the various parts of 
the continent as well as connexions with 
other continents, thus bringing out the 
contribution Africa has made to the 
development of mankind.
