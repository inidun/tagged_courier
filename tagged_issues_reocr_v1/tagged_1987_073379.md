In Lesotho, a small land-locked country in southern Africa, the land is 
subject to extensive erosion caused by severe drought followed by 
intensive rainfall, by heavy over-grazing, and fuel-wood cutting. To 
combat erosion, increase agricultural production, improve the road 
network and encourage the development of village woodlots, the Gov- 
ernment of Lesotho, assisted by the United Nations World Food Prog- 
ramme, organized a food-for-work project with voluntary labourers. 
Women constituted 90 per cent of the work-force. Above, labourers

Editorial 
Man has always lived dangerously, ever since his most distant 
ancestor, a hominid who probably lived on the African continent, 
took the first steps along the path of human evolution and 
discovered that a stone held in the hand could be used as a tool ora 
weapon. 
From the dawn of history onwards, human beings continually 
courted danger as the struggle for survival schooled them in 
resourcefulness and impelled them to the limits of endurance. This 
determination to perform seemingly impossible feats is a thread 
which runs through the pattern of human destiny and helps to 
explain the extraordinary efforts made by human communities in 
various parts of the world to adapt to extremely rigorous 
environmental conditions. From the primitive hunters who 
confronted their prey armed only with a stone axe, to the space 
travellers of the late twentieth century who must reach peak 
physical and mental condition in order to spend long periods in a 
state of weightlessness, human beings have always shown 
capacities for adaptation both to the natural environment and to 
their self-imposed challenges. Manis by nature an inventive, 
forward-looking being whose relentless drive to master himself 
and the world around him is so strong that today some fear that it 
may even lead him along the road to destruction. 
This issue of the Unesco Courier looks at the processes of human 
adaptation and endurance as they are revealed in a number of 
extreme and potentially dangerous situations. A medical doctor 
describes his gruelling experiences during a solo expedition to the 
North Pole on skis, while another scientist presents some of the 
findings of his extraordinary experiments in long-term 
confinement underground, cut off from the rhythms of the solar 
day. Other articles examine the ways in which space voyagers deal 
with weightlessness; the mechanisms of adjustment to high 
altitudes; adaptation to conditions in deserts and tropical forests, 
to life on and under the sea, and to the wear and tear of everyday 
existence in the modern world. Finally we evoke the phenomenal 
exploits of a Norwegian long-distance runner who a century and a 
half ago ran across Europe and parts of Asia and Africa at arate of 
around 150 km a day.

### 73365: Survival: human adaptation to extreme conditions

SURVIVAL 
Human adaptation 
to extreme conditions 
DAPTATION, in human beings 
A and in animals, is a process 
whereby the organism gradually 
acquires resistance to certain factors in its 
environment and consequently the 
capacity to live in conditions previously 
incompatible with life, and to solve pre- 
viously unsolved problems. 
“To live in -conditions previously 
incompatible with life” can mean com- 
plete adaptation, allowing a wide range 
of physical and intellectual activity as well 
as the perpetuation of the species in con- 
ditions of polar cold, desert heat or short- 
age of oxygen at high altitudes, just as it 
can mean a far from complete adaptation 
which permits only survival for a more or 
less extended period. 
Likewise, “to solve previously 
unsolved problems” includes resolution 
of elementary problems, such as how to 
avoid attacks by predators by standing 
stock still—a passive defence reflex—or 
of more complex ones, such as travelling 
in space or controlling the life processes 
of the organism. 
All these adaptive mechanisms have 
one feature in common: although in the 
initial phase of adaptation to any new 
factor the organism is close to the limits of 
its capacities, the manner in which it 
solves the problem is far from perfect. 
However, if the person or animal con- 
cerned survives, and the causal agent of 
adaptation continues to be active, the 
possibilities open to the organism 
increase and the extreme or urgent stage 
is replaced by one of effective, stable 
adaptation. 
This transformation is the crucial 
moment in the whole process, and it often 
has’remarkable consequences, as in the 
case of the experiments carried out by a 
Peruvian scientist who “lifted” in a pres- 
surized chamber a group of people, some 
of whom were already adapted to high 
altitudes while others were not. When the 
pressure was equivalent to that at an alti- 
tude of 7,000 metres the novices lost con- 
sciousness, while the others continued 
playing chess. 
Similarly, a healthy but untrained per- 
son can run a few hundred metres at the 
most without stopping to rest, whereas a 
trained runner can cover more than 40 
kilometres. The cold weather which hit 
Western Europe in the winter of 1986-87 
had catastrophic effects in some countries 
and caused a number of deaths. During 
the same period in Verkhoyansk, a town 
in eastern Siberia and one of the coldest 
places on Earth, eight- to nine-year-old

children continued going to school in 
temperatures of -57 °C and herds of 
thoroughbred horses grazed as usual,

"In the field of intellectual activity, 
where adaptive reactions are qual- 
itatively more complex, the transition 
from the stage of extreme tension to that 
of stable adaptation is manifested in an

In 1984 a group of walkers crossed a part 
of the Kara-Kum desert in the Turkmen 
S.S.R. during a Soviet experiment on life in 
desert regions. The walkers were not 
allowed to drink water during this 
endurance test, which was closely 
monitored by doctors. Right, a doctor 
examines two walkers during a rest 
period. 
In 1979, a seven-man Soviet expedition 
reached the North Pole after a 1,500 km 
trek on skis across drifting ice. The expedi- 
tion, which took two and a half months, 
made a notable contribution to knowledge 
about life in Arctic regions (see the Unesco 
Courier, January 1980). A ceremony (be- 
low) was organized at the Pole to celebrate 
the achievement.

equally striking manner. This transfor- 
mation of an unadapted organism into an 
adapted one is well known, and has been 
described in detail. 
Two interrelated series of phenomena 
develop in the organism faced with a new 
situation. In the first series there is a rapid 
development in the function of the sys- 
tem most directly concerned in the adap- 
tation process, for example the organs of 
movement, blood circulation or respira- 
tion when a physical effort is involved, or 
specialized parts of the brain during train- 
ing and acquisition of new skills. The cells 
react by increasing the synthesis of 
nucleic acids and proteins, and a selective 
development of the structures limiting 
the function occurs. Thus, during adapta- 
tion to altitude or physical effort, the cor- 
onary arteries expand and there is a two 
to threefold increase in the number of 
“power stations” (mitochondria) in the 
skeletal muscles. As a result, a series of 
changes takes place in the cells of the 
dominant system, that on which adapta- 
tion depends, which increases the phys- 
iological capacity of the system and forms 
the material basis for the transition from 
an extreme stage to genuine adapta- 
tion. 
The second series of phenomena is the 
well-known stress reaction discovered by 
the Canadian biologist Hans Selye, which 
he called “general adaptation syn- 
drome”. It is now known that the stress 
reaction manifested by the secretion of 
adrenal hormones into the blood not only 
mobilizes the organism’s energy and 
structural resources, but also ensures 
their transfer from inactive systems to the 
dominant system. In other words, the 
reaction allows the vitally important 
problem created by the environment to

be solved. When adaptation has been 
achieved and the individual has become 
accustomed to the cold, or learned to 
solve mathematical problems or to play 
the piano, the stress reaction disappears. 
Adaptation to other physical or chemical 
factors in the environment takes place in 
the same way (e.g., gradual habituation 
to increasing doses of poison). 
Afterwards the organism can no longer 
be damaged by the external factor to 
which it has become adapted. It is 
remarkable that the multiple reactions 
set off by the process of adaptation to one 
environmental factor frequently contain oh; 
components which heighten resistance to 
other factors. Thus adaptation to an 
insufficiency of oxygen strengthens the 
organism’s resistance to physical effort, 
hallucinogens, epileptogens, factors pro- = 
ducing high blood pressure, stress 
damage to the heart, ischaemia (interrup- 
tion of the blood supply to an organ or 
tissue), and even to ionizing radiation. 
This opens up vast possibilities for the * 
utilization of adaptation in the preven- i 
tion and treatment of diseases. Nowa- 
days, when extensive use—and in some ~~ * 
cases abuse—of medicines creates a real 
possibility of dependence on them, it 
would be useful to have doctors pre- 
scribe, not only medicines, but adapta- 
tion to a complex of individually selected - 
factors. - 
It is now known that external stress can 
provoke or speed up the development of . 
gastric and duodenal ulcers, high blood 
pressure, arteriosclerosis, ischaemic 
heart ailments, diabetes, mental disor- 
ders, skin troubles and—as has been 
shown recently—tumours.

3 ? FORE ERE TIE YW ey However, the role of stress in certain 
pathological conditions is now so well 
known that it may obscure the important 
fact that most human beings and animals, 
placed in extreme conditions from which 
there is no escape, do not die but acquire 
some degree of resistance which allows 
them to survive until better times. Such 
situations—prolonged periods of hunger, 
cold, natural catastrophes, interspecific 
and intraspecific conflicts—still occur 
widely among animals in their natural 
habitat. 
More complex stress situations occur 
just as frequently in human society. Dur- 
ing a relatively short historical era man 
has survived periods of slavery, serfdom 
and world war in such a way as to prove 
the efficiency of his powers of adaptation. 
Of course, the price of this adaptation has 
been unjustifiably high, but these indis- 
putable facts inevitably lead to the con- 
clusion that the human organism must be

endowed with efficient specialized mech- 
anisms that limit the reaction to stress and 
prevent stress damage. 
Research carried out in the last decade 
has confirmed the existence of these 
stress-inhibiting mechanisms. It has been 
shown that under pressure from extreme 
tensions, the stress reaction is accom- 
panied by intensified activity of the cen- 
tral stress-inhibiting systems. One exam- 
ple is the increased production in the 
brain of morphine-like opiate peptides 
and other substances which limit the 
stress reaction. These substances 
accumulate in the brain and neutralize 
the stress-inducing excitation of the 
nerve-centres. 
The activity of the stress inhibitors also 
intensifies in the other organs, where sub- 
stances accumulate that limit the action 
of stress hormones on the cells and pre- 
vent stress damage. The dual activity of 
central and local stress inhibitors protects 
the organism from gastric ulcers, heart 
damage, impairment of immune systems, 
arrhythmia, and injury caused by chemi- 
cal factors. 
These facts generally correspond to 
what can be observed in everyday life. 
People who have experienced terrible 
ordeals acquire a certain resistance to the 
wear and tear of life. Moreover, the pos- 
sibility can now be envisaged of employ- 
ing substances produced by stress- 
inhibiting centres, equivalent substances 
produced by synthesis, and the chemical 
activators of such inhibiting systems, as 
substitutes for the natural mechanisms of 
adaptation, in order to protect the organ- 
ism from stress and other forms of 
damage. This theory, now largely con- 
firmed by experiment, opens up highly 
promising prospects for the prevention 
and treatment of non-infectious diseases.

HE overwhelming majority of the 
] world’s population live between 
sea level and an altitude of 3,000 
metres. Only some 15 million persons live 
in permanent settlements between that 
level and 4,800 metres, mainly on the 
high plateaux of the Andes in South 
America, and of Tibet in Central Asia. 
Altitude inevitably imposes constraints 
on people who live in these regions. In the 
first century AD, Pan Kou, a Chinese 
historian, described in these terms the 
Karakoram mountain range in Central 
Asia: “It is necessary to cross two moun- 
tains, one large and one small, which 
make the head ache. The earth lies naked 
there, on the scorching slopes, and the 
human body loses its colour because of 
the heat; the torrid sun causes headaches 
and nausea, and it has the same effect on 
animals ...” 
Father José de Acosta, a Jesuit mis- 
sionary to the New World, describes 
acute mountain sickness in his treatise 
Historia natural y moral de las Indias 
(1590; Natural and Moral History of the 
Indies, 1604), and relates it to the fact that 
at such altitudes “the air is so subtle and 
so refined that it is unsuited to human 
respiration, which needs air that is 
thicker and more temperate ...” 
What exactly is meant by the term alti- 
tude? Altitude in the sense of environ- 
ment consists of a number of physical fac- 
tors, principally the lowering of 
barometric pressure! and therefore of the 
partial pressures? of respiratory gases, the 
wide range of variation in day and night 
temperatures, increased solar radiation 
and a greater incidence of high-energy 
heavy particles in the atmosphere. 
The lowering of barometric pressure is 
by far the most important factor as far as 
man 1s concerned, and it is an unavoida- 
ble constraint to which technology has 
found no practical long-term solution. 
Consequently, the values of the partial

pressure of respiratory gases, especially 
that of oxygen in the arterial blood, are 
usually taken as the basis for determining 
the physiological limits of altitude. 
“Physiological” altitude therefore does 
not correspond to physical altitude. On 
the one hand, the fall in atmospheric 
pressure is not directly proportional to 
height above sea level; on the other, the 
oxygen content of the blood is not a sim- 
ple function of the partial pressure of oxy- 
gen in the air. Three levels can be dis- 
tinguished, according to the value of the 
partial pressure of oxygen in arterial 
blood: 
- above 70 millimetres of mercury, 
changes in the partial pressure of oxygen 
(i.e. in altitude) have little effect on the 
amount of oxygen contained in the blood. 
(The normal arterial blood pressure at 
sea level is 90 millimetres of mercury. ); 
- between 70 and 40 millimetres of merc- 
ury, the effect of the fall in the partial 
pressure of oxygen becomes more 
noticeable; 
- below 40 millimetres of mercury, the 
oxygen content of the blood falls consid- 
erably and more or less constantly with 
small changes in the partial pressure of 
oxygen. 
Altitudes of less than 3,300 metres cor- 
respond to the first level; there are no 
significant effects on the oxygen trans- 
porting function of the blood. 
The Qurou Indians live in floating settle- 
ments on Lake Titicaca, one of the world’s

tude 3,812 m), on the border of Peru and

It is impossible for man to live perma- 
nently at the third level—above 5,500 
metres. 
Altitude, in the physiological sense of 
the term, thus corresponds to a level of 
between 3,300 and 5,500 metres (a baro- 
metric pressure of between 500 and 370 
millimetres of mercury). 
The main problem for the human 
organism in such an environment con- 
sequently lies in transferring oxygen from 
the atmosphere to the cells. 
Like the higher animals, man has two 
active transfer mechanisms: the respira- 
tory system, and the circulatory system 
which distributes to the various tissues 
the oxygen bonded to the haemoglobin in 
the blood. At an altitude of over 3,500 
metres the partial pressure of oxygen in 
the air is insufficient to saturate the 
haemoglobin. Respiration and circula- 
tion rates are therefore the most 
affected. 
People living at high altitudes have 
more red corpuscles and more 
haemoglobin circulating in their blood, 
and this makes up for the fall in the partial 
pressure of oxygen. This increase in red 
corpuscles at high altitudes allows the 
cardiac output to return to, or sustain, its 
sea level value. These two responses, 
greater cardiac output and an increase‘in 
the number of red corpuscles, have the 
same purpose: to convey to the tissues the

only cereal grown in the valley. 
oxygen they need, despite its rarefaction 
in the atmosphere. The first is an immedi- 
ate functional response; the second is 
more adaptive and takes over from the 
first. 
Reduced barometric pressure is not the 
only constraint due to altitude; cold is 
usually an associated factor. Some phys- 
iological responses to cold, such as 
decreased circulation to the skin, are 
also among the responses to altitude 
hypoxia.? 
Man is thus not naturally suited to life 
at high altitudes; all the regulatory and 
control mechanisms of the human organ- 
ism work in accordance with sea level 
conditions. However, in temperate and 
tropical regions people live at heights 
where the barometric pressure is close to 
half that of sea level, and most of the 
body’s functions have adjusted accord- 
ingly. 
People have travelled through and 
lived in high altitude regions since ancient 
times. They have served as places of 
refuge or as extensions of land used for 
stock-rearing, for example. The inhabi- 
tants have adapted physiologically to 
these exceptional living conditions, but 
they depend for subsistence on the poor 
pasture land which feeds the animals they

raise, and they are always at the mercy of 
a severe winter which could decimate 
their beasts. They also rely on the water 
supply from glaciers to irrigate their 
fields. 
The people who live in the high 
plateaux of South America or Central 
Asia lead an active life as farmers and 
herdsmen. Their extensive empirical 
knowledge of the soil and climatic condi- 
tions has enabled them to create a highly 
efficient system of terraced irrigation and 
cultivation. They follow a sowing time- 
table which ensures that crops can be har- 
vested in the minimum of time, and they 
know how to cross-breed animals to 
increase their resistance and how to store 
food as a precaution against irregular har- 
vests. The growing of cereals and the rais- 
ing of animals are closely interdepen- 
dent, for intensive agriculture is only 
possible if manure is available. 
The Andean peoples grow potatoes, 
maize (corn), fava beans and quinoa (a 
plant of the Chenopodium family) and 
raise llamas and vicunas. They use the 
wool and meat of another camelid, the 
alpaca, as well as its skin and its fat, which 
is thought to have therapeutic powers. 
The breeding of these animals and of 
oxen and sheep, which were introduced 
in the sixteenth century, is their main live- 
lihood: a herd of 200 animals is needed to 
maintain a family of six.

Several centuries of exploitation of 
mineral resources have led some peoples 
to settle at altitudes of around 4,800 
metres—at the Chorolque mine in 
Bolivia, for example. In Central Asia, 
the farmers who live in the southernmost 
and easternmost valleys of Tibet grow 
barley, peas and, more recently, potatoes 
on irrigated land. They also raise oxen 
and sheep. 
Nomadic tent-dwelling herdsmen in 
these regions live entirely by stock-rear- 
ing. In the main they breed animals such 
as yaks, sheep, goats and horses, which 
are well suited to the conditions. The yak 
provides them with milk, from which they 
make butter and cheese, as well as meat, 
skins and hair; it is also used as a beast of 
burden. These nomads control the 
greater part of the transport and trade in 
salt, bartered for grain from the lower- 
lying valleys. 
In order to obtain food and survive at 
high altitudes, the inhabitants of the 
Andean and the Central Asian mountain 
ranges have developed production sys- 
tems designed to subjugate nature, 
reduce risk, and make the most of avail- 
able resources (in the case of the Andes, 
by making the maximum use of the ecolo- 
gical zones at different altitudes). Their 
aim is to take from the environment all 
that is necessary to meet their needs, at 
the same time eliminating or reducing cli- 
matic risks. This is a basic feature of the 
relationship between high mountain 
societies and their environment, and it is 
to be seen not only in agriculture and 
stock-rearing, but in all the other 
activities of their life—the procurement 
of food, shelter and a dwelling-place. 
The very wide range of individual reac- 
tions suggests that altitude may have had 
a selection pressure on peoples living per- 
manently in high-altitude regions, and 
that throughout the generations such 
selection may have favoured people who 
were better suited to develop favourable 
responses and, even more, to reduce 
those responses likely to prove 
unfavourable. n

### 73367: Travelling light: coping with weightlessness in space

TRAV,   
  
FELLING LIGHT 
Coping with weightlessness in space 
T is just over a quarter of a century 
1 since man first ventured into space. 
An assessment of the achievements 
of astronautics so far indicates that man 
now has a firm foothold in the realm of 
space travel and that the human factor 
will be decisive in the conquest of outer 
space. 
Today systematic study is being made 
of all aspects of the Universe, with pri- 
ority being given to the exploration of the 
Earth from space and to the use of space 
technology to solve many of the problems 
of our planet. 
Every space flight makes an important 
contribution to this enterprise, furthering 
the study of the Earth’s natural resources 
and of the world ocean, the application of 
new technologies and the development of 
new products (especially pharmaceutical 
compounds and biological substances 
which are difficult or impossible to ob- 
tain on Earth because of the effects of 
gravity) and the monitoring of the 
environment. 
Cosmonauts are remaining in space for. 
longer and longer periods and are 
required to perform increasingly numer- 
ous and complex tasks, including man- 
oeuvres outside their spacecraft, which 
    
by Oleg G. Gazenko 
call for continual progress in medical 
research to ensure that space travellers 
remain healthy and capable of working at 
full capacity. 
Already, the findings of such research 
have opened up new perspectives on the 
workings of the human organism, leading 
notably to a greater understanding of the 
general laws governing adaptation to the 
environment, and above all adaptation to 
such an unusual condition as weightless- 
ness, which man does not experience on 
Earth. 
Throughout its long evolution the 
human body has never had occasion to 
make use of mechanisms capable of com- 
pensating for absence of gravity. On the 
contrary, the whole evolutionary process 
has been to fight against the force of grav- 
ity, in order to survive in the continual 
heaviness imposed by the Earth’s gravita- 
tional pull. Gravity influenced the 
development of the structures and func- 
tions of the cardio-vascular system, the 
motor system and the central nervous 
system. 
The degree of adjustment that we have 
attained, which makes us human, isthus a 
logical development, and the individual 
in the course of his life is capable of refin- 
ing and improving that adaptation, just as 
he can lose it, at least in part, usually 
through ageing or illness. However it has 
been observed that this can also happen 
to young, healthy subjects when they 
travel in space and experience weight- 
lessness. 
Before the first manned space flight, 
some scientists claimed that man would 
be incapable of working in a state of 
weightlessness. They even went so far as 
to declare that a normal human being 
would be psychologically unable to cope 
with the state of weightlessness and the 
cosmic void. The space flight of Yury 
Gagarin resoundingly disproved these 
pessimistic predictions and, by showing 
Onboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia.

bag, while another, right, equipped with

that human beings can indeed journey 
through space, flung open the gateway to 
the stars. 
How does weightlessness influence the 
human organism? What changes does it 
produce, and what shocks can it cause 
against which preventive measures 
should be taken? 
Weightlessness first of all produces a 
sensation of disequilibrium and of float- 
ing, due to a disruption in the normal 
functioning of sense organs such as the 
vestibular apparatus of the inner ear, 
sight, touch and muscle awareness. The 
cosmonaut has the impression of flying 
upside down or falling. Sometimes this is 
accompanied by disagreeable and very 
uncomfortable sensations of giddiness, 
weakness or nausea. The form and dura- 
tion of these symptoms vary greatly from 
one individual to another. On more than 
200 space flights, two-thirds of the sub- 
jects experienced them to some extent, 
lasting for periods ranging from a few 
hours to several days. Subsequently the 
symptoms wear off, only toreappear, as a 
rule, for the first few hours or days after 
returning to the Earth’s gravitational 
field. 
The absence of gravity subjects the car-

dio-vascular system to a redistribution of 
the total amount of blood in the body: 
instead of accumulating in the lower part 
of the body, the blood tends to rise into 
the thoracic and cephalic regions. This 
modifies the regulation of the heart and 
the metabolism of the cardiac muscle, 
which gradually weakens, and also causes 
a loss of tone and elasticity in the veins of 
the legs. If this state ts prolonged, the 
absence of blood pressure causes a deteri- 
oration in the reactions of the cardio-vas- 
cular system to physical effort or to move- 
ment, and it starts to “run down”. 
As the influence of weightlessness con- 
tinues, other forms of reaction emerge, 
owing to the lack of demands made on the 
bones and muscles. Indeed, without grav- 
ity, no effort is required to move around 
inside the space station or to shift objects 
from one place to another. A gradual 
functional atrophy of the muscles occurs, 
starting with those which are used to com- 
bat gravity, hold certain positions and 
compensate for the Earth’s gravitational 
pull during movement. This leads to a 
partial wastage of the muscle mass, 
especially the muscles of the legs and 
back. 
Decalcification of bone tissue occurs 
through loss of calcium salts and phos- 
phorus, but this has never reached alarm- 
ing levels, even on the longest space 
flights. However, if effective measures 
are not taken, decalcification could 
become a serious obstacle to longer man- 
ned space flights. 
These phenomena and other phys- 
iological reactions to weightlessness are 
primarily functional and do not constitute 
a threat to cosmonauts’ health. 
Furthermore, it is abundantly clear 
that human adaptation to the state of 
weightlessness signifies, to some extent, a 
loss of adaptation to the conditions of life 
on Earth. A rather singular situation then 
arises: the more complete the adaptation 
to weightlessness, the more difficult is the 
process of readaptation after re-entry. 
All cosmonauts who have spent time in 
orbit are familiar with this experience. 
How far this process can be a threat to 
their health is difficult to determine. 
Adequate scientific evidence is lacking to 
enable a valid judgement to be made, 
since for all space flights lasting more 
than three weeks various methods have 
been used to protect the cosmonauts 
from the negative influence of weight- 
lessness. 
In view of the increasing duration of 
space flights, doctors have been obliged 
to devise ways and means of counteract- 
ing too great an adaptation to weightless- 
ness, in order to ensure that the mecha- 
nisms indispensable to life governed by 
the Earth’s gravitational field continue to 
function effectively. It has been neces- 
sary to prevent the body's systems from 
“forgetting” their terrestrial vocation and 
to “remind” them of their role on 
Earth. 
These measures include, first and fore- 
most, physical training on bicycles and 
moving running-tracks to tone up the 
muscles. During long space flights, cos- 
monauts walk approximately 5 kilo- 
metres a day, and cycle for some 10 kilo- 
metres. The amount of exercise depends 
on the day in the training cycle, the dura- 
tion of the flight and the individual 
characteristics of the body. Additional 
exercises using extensors and other 
apparatus can also be carried out if 
necessary. 
To prevent circulatory disorders, the 
cosmonauts have to exercise while nega- 
tive pressure is applied to the lower part 
of the body. They put on a special gar- 
 
ment like a pair of baggy trousers made of 
stretch fabric, in which a vacuum pump 
establishes a permanent degree of nega- 
tive pressure. As a result the blood flows 
into the lower parts of the body, where 
the blood pressure rises to the same level 
as on Earth. This stimulates circulation in 
the legs and prevents reduction of the 
ability to stand upright which tends to 
affect cosmonauts returning to Earth. 
During the last few days of the flight 
the cosmonauts take in salt-water solu- 
tions, causing fluid retention and an 
increase in the volume of blood. This also 
makes it easier for them to maintain an 
upright stance on their return. Another 
very important preventive measure is to 
add an extra ration of vitamins and trace 
elements to the diet. 
In the future, recourse will very proba- 
bly be had to artifictal gravity, but thisis a 
complex problem which calls for very 
careful study, through experiments both 
on Earth and in space.

Above, two cosmonaulis take a shower on 
board the orbiting Soviet space station 
Salyut 7. 
Left, a cosmonaut (foreground) works out 
on an ergometric bicycle in the Soviet 
space station Salyut 7. This type of exer- 
cise is vital to enable the body to readapt 
to Earth’s gravity after a time spent in 
space. 
Much is now known about the body’s 
reactions to weightlessness, and how 
these reactions come about is largely 
understood. The general impression is 
that man is capable of adapting satisfac- 
torily to a prolonged state of weightless- 
ness, then of re-adapting to gravity and 
smoothly returning to a normal and use- 
ful life on Earth. 
However, since human health and 
safety are at stake, it is important to 
assess each new step in space exploration 
with meticulous accuracy, and to pay the 
closest possible attention to the smallest 
details in the growing store of experience. 
Nothing must be overlooked, from the 
remote consequences of space flights 
already undertaken to the difficulties and 
complications likely to be faced on future 
flights. Science, especially biological and 
medical research in space, has a long way 
to go in order to perfect knowledge of 
Man and the Universe and penetrate the 
complexities of the interaction between 
the two, thereby helping to achieve a har- 
monious relationship.  §

### 73369: The Time of our lives: subterranean experiments on the rhythms imposed by the solar day

14 
  
Subterranean experiments onthe — _-_ by the solar day 
Hippocrates and probably even ear- 
lier have demonstrated the impor- 
tant ways in which man is conditioned by 
environmental rhythms, especially the 
twenty-four-hour alternation of night and 
day. 
In man, as in other animals and plants, 
rhythmic variations in a whole range of 
physiological functions—alternation be- 
tween sleep and waking activity, formation 
of glycogen (animal starch) in the liver, 
temperature change, metabolism, for 
example—occur regularly every twenty- 
four hours. 
Known as “circadian rhythms” (from the 
Latin circa: “about”, and dies: “day”), 
these more or less independent or inter- 
dependent rhythmic variations, operating 
throughout the day/night cycle, constitute 
the mechanism that is termed man’s “bio- 
logical clock”. 
These circadian rhythms are of consid- 
erable importance. If they are interrupted 
or too rapidly or abruptly thrown out of 
Pippen since the time of phase, serious physical and psychological 
troubles can result. It is common knowl- 
edge that total deprivation of sleep over a 
period of several days is certain to entail 
marked deterioration in mental and physi- 
cal performance. After an east/west or west/ 
east flight of only a few hours it may take a 
passenger’s rectal temperature rhythm as 
long as fifteen days to adapt to the appropri- 
ate rhythm of the new local time. 
It is generally held that, under normal 
conditions on earth, environmental factors, 
and especially the alternation of night and 
day, act as phase-setters or synchronizers 
which maintain the coincidence between 
human circadian rhythms and the local 
twenty-four-hour time scale. What, 
however, would happen to our biological 
rhythms, to the bundle of nerve cells whose 
precise location in the brain is now being 
established and which register the periodic 
signals of the environment, were those sig- 
nals to be suppressed? 
Botanists and biologists have known for a 
long time that cycles of about twenty-four 
hours continue in many plants and animals 
even when they are kept either in total 
obscurity or in continuous light. However, 
concentrated research on the adaptation of 
the human organism to an aperiodic 
environment, that is to say to an environ- 
ment in which the normal phase setters or 
synchronizers are lacking, only began in 
earnest in 1962. 
The three main situations in which these 
conditions apply are those in which people 
find themselves living for long periods in 
space, underground or under water. Would 
the human organism continue to show evi- 
dence of regulation by circadian rhythms 
once deprived of the environmental syn- 
chronizersit had known throughout the mil- 
lions of years of human evolution? Are 
there, in fact, other rhythms specific to the 
human organism? 
This was the crux of my long-term experi- 
ments, deep in an underground cave, which 
have added to our knowledge of how man 
adapts to a timeless, aperiodic environ- 
ment. These experiments have shown how

patterns during his confinement. 
complex that adaptation is and how much it 
varies from individual to individual, and 
have afforded a better understanding of the 
mechanism of human circadian rhythms. 
Without synchronizers, without time 
“landmarks”, whether natural (alternation 
of day and night) or artificial (clocks or 
watches), each individual’s internal 
rhythms appear to be, but in fact are not, 
synchronized with the rhythms of local 
times on Earth. 
The most important findings concern two 
distinct fields of interest—the evolution of 
the sleeping/waking cycle and of other phys- 
iological functions (such as temperature 
and cardiac rhythms), and the internal 
structure of sleep itsclf, which lies within 
the field of neurophysiology. 
With regard to the sleeping/waking cycle, 
all the long-term (two to six months) experi- 
ments I carried out between 1962 and 1972 
seem to point in the direction of a lengthen- 
ing of the cycle, that is to say, a lengthening 
of the interval between two waking periods 
and two sleeping periods. This has been 
confirmed by the experiments carried out 
by all the other research teams (mainly Ger- 
man, British and American) who have 
worked on this problem, even though these 
were of shorter duration (about one 
month), 
Although those who have written on this 
- subject seem to be agreed on a statistical 
average for the sleeping/waking cycle of 
around twenty-five hours, this has little sig- 
nificance with regard to the individual. My 
long-term experiments have brought out 
clearly the multi-faceted nature of a particu- 
lar rhythm and its unreproducibility over a 
given period of time. This has been demon- 
strated in spectacular fashion by the fact 
that whereas for some individuals the sleep- 
ing/waking cycle changes within a few days 
from twenty-four to forty-eight hours 
(thirty-four to thirty-six hours of continuous 
waking activity and fourteen to twelve 
hours of sleep), for others this may not hap- 
pen for several months. A comparison 
between my 1962 experiment (when I was 
isolated on the underground glacier at 
Scarasson in France from 16 July to 17 Sep- 
tember) and my second experiment in 1972 
(205 days alone in Midnight Cave, Texas) 
shows clearly the unreproducibility of the 
sleeping/waking cycle. 
A significant outcome of this spon- 
taneous change from a twenty-four-hour to 
a forty-eight-hour cycle is that for just a 
third more sleep than is normal under 
ordinary conditions of life it is possible to

double the period of waking activity, a very 
considerable potential increase in creative 
activity, entirely naturally and without hav- 
ing recourse to any form of drug, for a 
period of several weeks. 
Desynchronization of the circadian 
rhythm of sleep and waking activity is paral- 
leled in most of the other physiological 
rhythms examined, such as the cardiac 
rhythm, the rhythm of the rectal tempera- 
ture, of potassium and of the hydroxycor- 
ticosteroid hormones. 
I believe that this desynchronization is an 
adaptive response by the organism to the 
aperiodicity of the environment. This 
brings me to the second group of important 
findings concerning the structure of sleep in 
a timeless situation. We were the first to 
undertake such studies which were carried 
out in 1966. Under a forty-eight-hour sleep- 
ing/waking cycle the human organism the- 
oretically builds up a sleep deficiency or 
debt. The question then arises as to which of 
the major stages of sleep (see below) is 
reduced to compensate for the abnormal 
(thirty-six-hour) period of waking activity. 
Progress in this field of research was only 
made possible by underground, atemporal 
experiments. Previous experiments on 
sleep had been carried out within the con- 
text of local time and of a circadian (twenty- 
four-hour) sleeping/waking cycle. Con- 
sequently, the natural variations in the vari- 
ous stages of which sleep consists could only 
be very limited. The relative proportions of 
what is known as REM (Rapid Eye Move- 
ment) sleep and the four other stages of 
sleep could only vary minimally around the 
mean average, which itself varied according 
to the individual concerned and the time of 
the year. 
However, the spontaneous changes in 
periodicity of the sleeping/waking cycle 
(cycles of 12, 24, 26, 28, 36, 48, 60 and even 
72 hours) occurring within the framework 
of my “out of time”, aperiodic experiments 
revealed the natural evolution of the time 
  
 
devoted to each stage of sleep, especially to 
REM sleep and to what is known as Stage 4 
sleep (deep sleep), as a function of total 
sleep and in relation to the biological cycles 
and the waking period. 
In short, the neurophysiological adapta- 
tion of the human organism in an “out of 
time” setting is marked by profound modi- 
fications in the internal structure of sleep, 
which vary from individual to individual, 
and which can be summarized as follows: 
— Whatever the duration of the sleeping/ 
waking cycle, the proportion of REM sleep 
can be accurately forecast since there is a 
precise linear correlation between REM 
sleep and total sleep, of which it is a func- 
tion. This phenomenon was observed for 
the first time in man during my experiments 
underground. 
— When the period of continuous waking 
activity doubles (rising from 16 to 34 or 36 
hours), total sleeping time does not double. 
However, REM sleep increases in a ratio of 
about one to ten to the length of waking 
activity. 
— The change from a circadian to a forty- 
eight-hour sleeping/waking rhythm does 
not affect the period (some 90 minutes) of 
REM sleep, which remains stable. 
To conclude this brief survey of the time 
factor in human adaptation, it should be 
recognized that it is an imperative necessity 
for ever more penetrating studies to be car- 
ried out on the desynchronization of circa- 
dian rhythms in order to increase man’s vig- 
ilance and operational capacities. The study 
of the desynchronization of the biological 
clock is all the more essential in that 
unavoidable desynchronization creates 
fatigue in many situations in modern life— 
night work (total inversion of the cycle), 
work in revolving shifts (continuous and 
prolonged desynchronization), east/west 
and west/east travel (involving almost con- 
tinuous desynchronization for certain per- 
sonnel), life around airports and other sites 
with high sound levels, work in exceptional 
surroundings (missile silos, tanks, sub- 
marine-spotting aircraft, nuclear submar- 
ines, spacecraft and space laboratories). 
Finally, when the organism is syn- 
chronized (that is to say, when it is subject 
to the normal circadian rhythm of twenty- 
four hours), the effect of many medicines 
varies according to the time of day that they 
are taken. Consequently, any change in the 
periodicity of the sleeping/waking cycle 
(resulting, for example, from an east/west 
" or west/east jet flight) or of the organism’s 
other rhythms, could have repercussions on 
the action of the medicine, altering or even 
reversing its therapeutic effect. |

### 73370: The Desert as a way of life

  
The desert as a way of life 
by Hamidou A. Sidikou 
O survive in a harsh world man has 
] no option but to adapt to the 
physical and climatic conditions 
of his environment. In doing so he must 
develop strategies which are often 
reflected in salient features of his culture 
and society. 
The peoples of Niger, and especially 
the Tuareg, the Tubu, the Kanuri, the 
Guézébida and the Arabs who live in the 
difficult conditions that prevail in the arid 
and semi-arid regions of the country, are 
no exception to this universal rule. Indi- 
vidually and collectively, their way of life 
is influenced, if not determined, by the 
need to adapt to the rigours of a climate in 
which the dominant factors are wide tem- 
perature variations, their duration and 
intensity. 
Over two-thirds of Niger’s total area of 
1,267,000 square kilometres consists of 
desert and semi-desert zones situated 
between latitudes 15° and 23° North. Of 
this vast expanse, the Ténéré Desert, 
bounded to the west and north-west by 
the Air massif and to the north and north- 
east by high plateaux whose southern lim- 
its are marked by impressive cliffs, itself 
covers more than 350,000 square kilo- 
metres. 
In these climatic zones, a combination 
of factors related to rainfall, atmospheric 
humidity and seasonal temperature vari- 
ations normally gives rise to four distinct 
seasons of varying length. 
The rainy season, which lasts from 
July-August to September, is short and 
irregular. When it does rain, the pre- 
cipitation is often slight, but sudden vio- 
lent storms are a threat to those whose 
houses are made of low-quality earth con- 
taining a large proportion of salts which 
dissolve rapidly in the wet. 
From the end of September to the end 
of October there is a short intermediate 
season characterized by both a high 
atmospheric humidity level and very high 
temperatures. This is followed by a dry, 
cold season lasting from November to 
March when an east wind, the Harmat- 
Berber peoples living in Mali, Niger and 
other Saharan countries, the Tuareg have 
created an original civilization adapted to 
the desert and its borderlands. In the 
southern parts of the region, nomadic 
herding over vast areas is a way of life 
conditioned by the arid climate and scar- 
city of water and grassland. Above, a 
Tuareg of Niger and his camel. 
tan, brings dry mists which are liable to be 
transformed into violent sandstorms, and 
temperatures fall below zero at night. 
Finally, there is a hot dry season which 
extends from March to June or July. This 
is the season of very great heat, with tem- 
peratures reaching 45°C or more. 
The maximum daily temperature 
range which is generally experienced at 
the beginning and end of the dry season 
may be as great as 20°C, while the range 
between the absolute minimum and max- 
imum temperatures may even reach 
40°C, if not more. An extraordinary 
capacity for adaptation is required of

peoples subject to such rigorous climatic 
conditions. This adaptation is reflected in 
every aspect of their lives. The strategies 
they adopt are in many cases indissocia- 
ble from the organization of society and 
from housing, clothing and diet. 
In this setting, human activity is strictly 
ruled by the existence of watering places. 
Because they are so rare, they have great 
economic value and are decisive factors 
in the determination of social status. 
Three branches of human activity— 
stock-raising, agriculture and manual 
labour—appear to be directly deter- 
mined by the harsh climatic conditions. 
Stock-raising activities not only fulfil 
economic requirements but also meet the 
need to adapt to the climate with its great 
variations of temperature. Camels and 
cattle are the main species raised, pri- 
marily for the production of milk which is 
the basic element of the diet. Since cam- 
els are more hardy than cattle, they can 
be raised in wide open rangelands and are 
able to adapt more easily to variations in 
soil composition and grazing vegetation. 
The available quantity of milk, which 
serves as both food and drink, varies from 
season to season, and this is why two com- 
plementary species are chosen for its pro- 
duction. Thus camel’s milk, which is 
available in adequate quantities during 
the hot, dry season, is appreciated both 
for its very rich vitamin content and for its 
low fat content, characteristics which are 
thought to increase endurance and resis- 
tance to hunger. It is also said to have 
remarkably beneficial effects on eye- 
sight. The absence or very low proportion 
of visually handicapped people among. 
populations whose diet is based on cam- 
el’s milk may be partly due to its high 
mineral content. 
Camel-herders also engage in trans- 
Saharan trading. One reason for this is 
the need to reconcile the differing 
demands of life in complementary ecolo- 
gical zones. Until it declined following 
successive droughts which decimated the 
herds and destroyed the vegetation on 
which they depended for grazing, the car- 
avan trade, in which tens of thousands of 
camels were stillinvolved only afew years 
ago, was of more than just economic sig- 
nificance. It was one of many responses 
to the particular environmental condi- 
tions and perpetuated a whole way of life 
through a wide-ranging network of social 
relationships. . 
Knowledge of the location of watering 
places is a key factor in this way of life in 
areas where the water supply is a matter 
of fundamental and permanent concern. 
Agricultural activity is thus limited to the 
area around oases where a permanent 
supply of water is available. Date-grow- 
ing is the mainstay of this irrigation agri- 
culture adapted to the seasons. Dates,

which are an important item of trade with 
the regions to the south, are a source of 
food, according to their quality, for both 
man and beast. 
Manual labour is primarily concerned 
with the exploitation of salt and natron. 
The latter, a hydrous sodium carbonate, 
is an essential element in animal feed 
since it meets the animals’ salt require- 
ments and also rids them of 
intestinal parasites, thus boosting their 
milk production. 
The concern to adapt diet to environ- 
mental conditions, which always under- 
lies human behaviour, is also apparent in 
the unusual, some would say immoder- 
ate, consumption of tea. A beverage that 
both quenches thirst and staves off hun- 
ger, tea is served ceremonially. It plays a 
part in creating physiological mecha-

nisms for adapting to the variations in 
temperature. 
Dress is another important indication 
of adaptation to the environment. The 
wearing of the veil and the turban are not 
only of social significance (attainment of 
adult status, for example), they also serve 
to protect the head, and in particular the 
eyes, nose and ears against the effects of 
low temperatures, the stinging blast of 
hot or cold winds and sandstorms. The 
wearing of voluminous clothing, usually 
made of cotton, is a form of adaptation to 
high temperatures. 
Finally, housing, its conception, the 
materials used in its construction, and the 
use made of it in relation to the seasons, is 
another important element in adaptation 
to climatic conditions. In the Kawar 
region of Niger, for example, where, in 
past centuries, fortified villages were con- 
structed for security reasons, four main 
types of dwellings are found. 
Stone houses, the last relics of those 
troubled times, are used during the dry, 
cold season because they offer better 
protection against sharp drops in tem- 
perature. 
Finding, transporting and storing water is 
a major preoccupation for Saharan 
nomads. Right, women of Niger carry 
water in gourds, an indication that they 
belong to a semi-sedentary village (since 
caravaners use water containers made of 
goatskin). 
During the hot, dry season, houses 
constructed of date-palm leaves come 
into their own. Cool, airy and well ventil- 
ated, they are divided into rooms desig- 
nated for different functions. A room 
reserved for the head of the household 
adjoins the entrance; there is a room for 
the women and children, a store-room for 
food or for animal fodder, a kitchen, and 
a living-room in which meals are taken. 
Tents, which are made of skins or of 
rush matting, vary in size according to the 
means of the occupants. They are always 
put up on a north-south axis with one or 
two openings on the east and west sides to 
allow air to circulate and the rays of the 
sun to enter. Tents are all-the-year-round 
dwellings which can easily be dismantled.

### 73371: Hunter-gatherers of the tropical forest

Hunter-gatherers 
of the tropical forest 
by Laurentiu Palade 
  
  
Between 100,000 and 200,000 Pygmies live 
in equatorial Africa, scattered through the 
forest which extends from the Atlantic 
Ocean to the great lakes of the east. 
Remarkably well adapted to conditions in 
the tropical forest, they live by hunting and 
gathering. Below, a Uganda Pygmy hunter 
with animal hides for use as drumskins. 
Beating drums is a form of communication 
between isolated groups in the forest. 
ROPICAL forests form a green 
] band around the Equator, 
extending roughly 10° North and 
South. This means that they account for 
only a small proportion, about 8 per cent, 
of the Earth’s land surface. Yet they com- 
prise almost half of all growing wood on 
the face of the planet, and harbour at 
least two-fifths of Earth’s plant and ani- 
mal species, a genetic resource of increas- 
ing importance to humanity through agri- 
culture, medicine and industry. They also 
comprise the most complex and diverse 
ecosystems on Earth, which fulfil regula- 
tory and productive functions that are 
essential to man and to his natural 
environment. 
The question of human adaptation to 
conditions in tropical rain forests has 
been examined in a number of scientific 
studies on groups of hunter-gatherers 
such as the Pygmies. The existence of 
such peoples is recorded in ancient times. 
Representations of tliem dating back 
over 4,000 years are found on ancient 
Egyptian bas-reliefs from the tombs of 
pharaohs of the Vth Dynasty. They are 
mentioned by Homer in the Iliad as well

as by Herodotus and Aristotle. Yet while 
other civilizations have completely disap- 
peared, the Pygmies, living in perfect har- 
mony with their environment, have sur- 
vived the ages. 
Pygmies are to be found in most of the 
world’s tropical forests. They are fairly 
numerous; the Ituri Pygmies of Africa, 
for example, number some tens of thou- 
sands. Operating in small groups of from 
five to thirty-four individuals, they live a 
semi-nomadic life adapted to conditions 
in the rain forest which are as extreme 
and pitiless as those of the cold and inhos- 
pitable Polar regions. 
Light penetration of the forest canopy 
is minimal. Virtually all ultraviolet rays 
are screened out. The accumulated heat 
and humidity is so intense that the 
atmosphere is like that of a greenhouse. 
The average temperature is 28°C, with 
variations no greater than from 3°C to 
9°C. Average relative humidity is 95 per 
cent at night and 60 to 70 per cent during 
the day, with only slight seasonal varia- 
tions. Winds are also very light, except 
when there is a tornado, and the air is 
extremely rich in carbon dioxide and is 
laden with scent elements, formic vapour 
amd microscopic particles of hair, scales 
and fibres. Rapid breakdown and trans- 
formation of organic matter is ensured by 
micro-organisms, which teem in the heat 
and humidity. 
The level of evapotranspiration is very 
high—three times the average for the 
planet as a whole. The forest floor is per- 
manently moist and a protective layer of 
branches and leaves is essential should 
you wish to lie on it. Ants and termites 
abound. Like the flora, the fauna of the 
forest is rich and varied. Animal life is 
“stratified”, with different species living 
at different levels. Monkeys and birds live 
in the higher levels of the canopy where 
conditions are easier and food is more 
abundant. 
The tropical forest is not very generous 
to the people and the larger animals who 
live at ground level. Food is difficult to 
find and they sometimes have to be con- 
tent with fruit that has been dropped by 
monkeys. At night, the large predators 
venture out to the open savannah at the 
edge of the forest and to river banks and Ph

abandoned cultivated plots. Game con- 
sists mainly of small antelope. At the 
same time, the inhabitants of the forest 
are under constant threat from insects, 
parasites and arboviruses, a group of 
viruses that develop in anthropods such 
as mosquitoes and are then transmitted 
by bites to vertebrate hosts. 
One indication of adaptation to forest 
life is to be seen in the fact that forest- 
dwelling elephant and buffalo are, in gen- 
eral, half the size of their counterparts 
living in the savannah. The forest people, 
too, weigh less and are shorter than those 
who live in open country. A comparative 
study undertaken in Africa has shown 
that forest-dwellers weigh, -on average, 
39.8 kilograms and are 1.44 metres tall, as 
compared with 62.5 kilograms and 1.69 
metres for inhabitants of the savannah. In 
comparison with other population 
groups, their oxygen consumption during 
effort, their pulmonary capacity and their 
cardiac rhythm are above average. They 
show no signs of protein deficiency or 
malnutrition. 
Their small stature gives the hunter- 
gatherers of the tropical forest a definite 
advantage in the form of a relatively high 
work capacity under difficult climatic 
conditions. A well organized routine, 
with major activities carried out early in 
the morning or late in the evening, helps 
them to avoid excessive perspiration. In 
fact, despite the dampness of the 
atmosphere, they sweat very little. In 
general, they maintain a satisfactory state 
of health and, among those who live in a 
Pygmies in concert: this man from the 
Central African Republic is playing a whis- 
tle cut from a branch of the papaya tree.

forest ecosystem which is still intact, 
there is a very low incidence of malaria. 
In order to adapt to the constraints of a 
life of hunting and gathering in the forest, 
the Pygmies, like nomads, have had to 
reduce their material possessions to a 
minimum. Those they do have are easily 
replaced. All they need is a stick to dig 
with and a leaf to drink from; a hollow 
stem provides a pipe for them to smoke. 
As a general rule they manage without 
anything that is too heavy to carry, such 
as pots and pans and looms. The forest 
provides them with liana, bark and 
branches with which to built their huts, 
make their beds and clothe themselves.

They make strings for their bows and 
padding for their shields from raffia fibre. 
From the hide of the game they kill they 
make belts. They carve traps from roots 
and make wicker griddles which, placed 
over a fire, enable them to smoke the 
flesh of big game. Food is cooked in large 
leaves. 
Hunting, upon which the survival of 
the group depends, is traditionally a male 
preserve. It has had a profound effect on 
both the individual and the collective 
mentality and has forged family and 
social structures. The forest is a foster- 
mother who must be respected. It is tac- 
itly accepted that no animal should be 
killed or tree felled unnecessarily. Game 
is usually caught with a net made of inter- 
woven liana and its meat is shared out in 
accordance with a strict ritual. Gather- 
ing, which is left to the women, is a com- 
plementary source of food. The produce 
of the forest—fruit, roots, leaves, mush- 
rooms—is abundant. Certain insects, 
such as caterpillars and termites, are 
gathered, as is honey. The forest also 
provides products for bodily care and the 
treatment of wounds, sickness and infir- 
mities. 
These forest people know their 
environment to perfection. Far from 
being overwhelmed by their natural sur- 
roundings, they are well organized and 
lead an active social life—festivities, pal- 
avers, dancing—and have a culture rich 
in tradition, myth and legend. 
The uncontrolled clearing of tropical 
forests for agriculture presents the forest- 
dwellers with problems of adaptation to 
their changing environment and may 
expose them to health and other risks. 
The pathogenic agents found in a forest 
environment attack man more readily in 
a cleared area than in an intact forest, 
where they concentrate on the primate 
and rodent population. An increase in 
the incidence of malaria, cardio-vascular 
troubles, physiological ailments and 
nutritional imbalances has in fact been 
noted. 
The exploitation of forest regions con- 
stitutes an indispensable economic 
development resource in many tropical 
countries. In order to achieve a judicious 
strategy which respects the natural bal- 
ance, Unesco’s Man and the Biosphere 
Programme (MAB) is currently engaged 
on a project to study the ecological effects 
of increasing human activity on tropical 
and subtropical forest ecosystems. It is 
hoped that this project will help to answer 
the many scientific questions raised by 
land use planning in the tropics. |

HE sea flows inside us—literally. 
T In our bloed as in seawater, the 
proportion of dissolved salts is the 
same: 3.5 per cent. Like all other forms of 
life, we emerged from the sea, yet despite 
such links, our attitude towards it is 
ambivalent. The sea inspires awe and 
fear, it is so unlike the landmasses that we 
inhabit. The vastness and solitude we 
now associate with outer space have 
always been present at sea. Even close to 
land, the surf waits to take its toll. 
With the ending of the Ice Age 10,000 
years ago and the subsequent rise in sea 
level, peoples everywhere found them- 
selves driven back by the invading waters.

Above, the “Triton”, an early breathing 
apparatus for divers, named after the son 
of the sea god Poseidon. In Greek mythol- 
ogy, Triton lived with his parents in a 
golden palace in the depths of the sea. 
people of the Arctic in a similar culture 
are still used by fishermen today, with 
= little change in their basic principles. 
Attitudes to the sea have been divided 
since the earliest times. Some sailed for 
trading purposes, endeavouring to spend 
as little time on the water as possible and, 
at first, to stay within sight of land. They 
belonged to the civilizations huddled 
around the Mediterranean. Then there 
were the sea-peoples, the dwellers on the 
ocean, who sought the sea, who returned 
to its womb. 
They did not shrink from the sea but 
embarked upon it in frail coracles or out- 
rigger canoes. And the sea repaid them. 
Its waves could be read to indicate the 
proximity of land, in the wake of an island 
breasting the tidal stream. The skies told 
their story by day and by night; there 
were nearly always clouds over islands 
and mariners set their course by the stars. 
Even birds could show in which direction 
the land lay, and surf breaking on rocks 
over the horizon threw up a telltale haze. 
Physical conditions on shipboard in the 
days of sail were extremely hard. No one 
has described a seaman’s life better than 
Richard Dana in his narrative Two Years 
Before the Mast, published in 1840 and 
still a classic. Dana signed on as an ordi- 
nary seaman aboard a vessel bound for 
California around Cape Horn, an 
unheard-of move for a university gradu- 
ate of good family. In a storm off Cape 
Horn, the sailors went aloft to take in the 
mainsail: “We had to fist the sail with bare 
hands. No one could trust himself to use

mittens, for if he slipped, he was a gone 
man. All the boats were hoisted in on 
deck and there was nothing to be lowered 
for him. We had need of every finger God 
had given us. ... Frequently we were obli- 
ged to leave off altogether and take to 
beating our hands upon the sail, to keep 
them from freezing.” Such Olympic 
exploits were part of the daily business of 
moving passengers and cargo. 
Until the end of sail, aseaman’s life was 
a constant flirtation with death. And 
now? Kipling’s “call of the off-shore wind 
and the voice of the deep-sea rain” can 
still be heard, but can it be answered? 
Hardly, on the automated tankers and 
cargo carriers of today. Noel Mostert, 
author of Supership, describes such a ves- 
sel: “One felt the arid metal acreage 
spreading invisibly all around, and its 
 
impact was one of menace: a mechanical 
desert of indefinable purpose imposed 
upon the sea’s own emptiness, and with 
forms and shapes that had no reassuring 
familiarity; it was filled with wind signs, 
not those of masts and rigging but of 
abandoned structures upon a plain, and 
there was no comfort even from the sea.” 
Mostert perhaps saw his vessel as a pre- 
cursor of unmanned ships of the future, 
sailing under remote control. 
There are still those who must seek 
the sea—fishermen, oceanographers, 
divers—and they are of a different breed. 
The attitudes of small-scale fishermen 
have not changed over time. They still 
live in small egalitarian communities 
where growth is not a goal and informa- 
tion is shared in co-operative net- 
works.

### 73372: The Sea within us

Right, two women aquanauts, a botanist 
and a zoologist, carry out an experiment. 
on fish behaviour as part of a U.S. marine 
research programme on the sea bed. The 
scientists lived for two weeks in a 4-room 
habitat at a depth of 15 m in the Caribbean 
near St. John Island (Virgin Islands). 
Left, a diver about to take the plunge from 
HMS Tedworth, protected by the cumber- 
some type of diving suit used in the 
1930s. 
  
Sociologists observe that fishermen 
tend to defer their pleasures and ritualize 
their risk-taking behaviour. Risks there 
are: the death rate of fishermen is seven 
times higher than the average. And they 
are a vanishing species, as booming 
leisure activities encroach on their 
beaches and shellfish beds. 
Not all fishing fits these descriptions. 
Big trawlers are more like factories, as 
William W. Warner points out in Distant 
Water: “Not since the great age of whal- 
ing have men stayed at sea for such 
protracted periods ... and no whaler ever. 
suffered the continuous and exhausting 
work schedules of the modern distant 
water fisherman.” Despite their size, 
these ships fell victim to storms, 
especially in winter when they were top 
heavy with ice. Adoption of 200-mile eco- 
nomic zones shut them out of rich shelf 
waters and rendered them obsolete. 
Warner sees a future with smaller 
medium-range ships such as “autoliners” 
that can handle 15,000-hook lines 
entirely by machine. 
Oceanographers are another variant of 
the human species found only at sea: not 
only must they survive aboard small ships 
but they must do scientific work as well, 
collecting data with precision. I once 
went out on an Icelandic research ship 
and took my turn taking Nansen bottles! 
off a wire as they were winched in. All 
waste motion had been eliminated from 
this series of movements that had to be 
repeated tens of times a day, hundreds of

times a voyage. The captain, his big 
tousled head stuck out of the port window 
of the bridge, made a special effort to 
keep the wire within my easy reach. With 
the help of propellers and rudder, he 
could move his 800 tons of ship literally by 
the inch in the empty grey water. 
I thought of the oceanographer on this 
voyage, Svend Malmberg, reading the 
thermometers on his Nansen bottles to an 
accuracy of a hundredth of a degree, 
when I came across an account of the 
contrasting life on board an oil rig 200 
kilometres out in the Gulf of Mexico with 
four 2,000-horsepower generators roar- 
ing night and day. Crew members worked 
seven 12-hour shifts on this platform, 
then hoped that bad weather would not 
hold up their relief. Drilling for oil is 
probably the least nautical of all occupa- 
tions pursued at sea, but it is not neces- 
sarily the safest. Oil rigs cannot run from 
a Gulf hurricane or a North Sea storm. 
Divers, too, are essential to these cities 
on the sea when it comes to finishing up a 
wellhead or troubleshooting on the bot- 
tom. One of the oldest of the maritime 
trades is here put to good use by one of 
the newest. Divers were going down for 
pearls in the Babylonia of 4,500 years 
ago, using the breathhold technique that 
now allows them to stay under for 4 min- 
utes at depths of up to 45 metres (the 
record for such diving is 90 metres). 
In the nineteenth century, diving suits 
fed by compressed air from the surface 
were invented, allowing divers to spend 
more time on the bottom but bringing in 
the danger of the bends, that painful and 
potentially fatal condition engendered by 
nitrogen bubbles forming in the blood. 
Now that man was moving in this totally 
alien environment he had to adapt to it, 
to the lack of oxygen, to the cold, to the 
distortion of vision by water pressure on 
the eyes. 
He did this with the hard-hat diver’s 
suit invented in 1819 by a German engi- 
neer, Augustus Siebe, that still left the 
diver attached to the surface. Then in 
1942, the Frenchmen Jacques Cousteau 
and Emile Gagnan came up with their 
independent breathing device, the Aqua- 
lung, and the scuba’ diver was born. Here 
was a new animal, free-swimming into the 
depths. 
It was soon apparent that many 
psychological and physiological adjust- 
ments had to be made. Nitrogen under 
pressure in the divers’ air led to “rapture 
of the deep” or the so-called “martini 
effect” (each 15 metres of depth equals 
one dry martini). An oxygen-helium 
breathing mixture took care of this but 
created new problems: a high-pitched 
“Donald Duck” voice and extreme 
cold. 
Diving tables were developed to show

valves and a mercury thermometer to record tempera- 
ture at specified depths.

how much time was needed in 
decompression for a stay at a given depth. 
Once a diver is “saturated” at his depth, 
the decompression time is the same no 
matter how long he stays there. Under- 
standing of this principle led to the first 
attempts to colonize the sea floor, the 
underwater habitats of the 1960s and the 
1970s. Unlike man-in-space missions that 
demand rocketry within the capability of 
only a few nations, man-in-the-sea 
experiments could be carried out by a 
number of countries. Among them were 
France, the United States, the Soviet 
Union, the German 
Republic, the Federal Republic of Ger- 
many, Israel, Poland, Czechoslovakia 
and Canada (which set some kind of a 
record with an “underwater Volks- 
wagen” costing only $15,000). 
The.French were first to develop a 
manned underwater station, with Cou- 
steau’s Conshelf, then the U.S. Sealab 
was constructed. All sorts of problems 
arose in the habitats. Humidity gave rise 
to infections, particularly in the ear, and 
wounds were slow to heal. Cooking could 
be tricky—dough just will not rise in a 
high pressure environment and if a can of 
fizzy drink is opened the bubbles go 
inward. (Some habitats solved all this by 
having their meals sent down from the 
surface in containers.) Cuisine may not 
be all that important, since many aqua- 
nauts reported a loss of their sense of 
smell and taste. 
It has been found that during the first 
five days of habitat living, people show 
signs of stress which then go away only to 
reappear after fifteen days. Life under 
the sea is shipboard or submarine life car- 
ried to an extreme. Like space travellers, 
aquanauts occasionally resented “ground 
control” at the surface with its constant 
monitoring of their behaviour. The tele- 
phone could be a hated intruder, con- 
stantly interrupting their routine. 
And people had to get on well 
together. In one habitat, scientists at first 
found themselves at odds with seamen 
doing simulated salvage work, but they 
ironed out their differences. Everyone 
would probably agree with the Soviets 
aboard Chernomor, who in 1971 reported 
in the newspaper Izvestiya: “The 
psychological problems caused by the 
confinement of several men together for 
long periods of time was of great concern 
before the start of the programme. Under 
these conditions it is well-known that 
men may tend to find fault with each 
other, that a man’s silence may be taken 
  
DAN BEHRMAN is an American author and 
journalist who frequently contributed to the 
Unesco Courier during his many years as a 
Unesco science writer. He is the author of a 
number of books on oceanography including 
The New World of the Oceans (Little, Brown and 
Co., Boston) and Assault on the Largest 
Unknown, The International Indian Ocean Expe- 
dition 1959-65 (Unesco, 1981).

for sullenness, a very neat man may be 
accused of being fussy. ... There were 
some problems aboard the Chernomor 
during the first few weeks but soon the 
crew came to appreciate the abilities of 
the other members and no new problems 
arose.” 
There have been no recent experi- 
ments in underwater living. Instead of 
remaining on the bottom, divers can now 
be brought to the surface in personnel 
transfer capsules and live in pressurized 
deck chambers until they go down again. 
But there will always be underwater 
explorers, just as there were navigators 
on the surface. Perhaps they will benefit 
from that ultimate transformation, the 
invention of an artificial gill through 
which the diver’s blood will flow and take 
up oxygen from the water, as fish do. 
Then the age of the sea people will have 
truly begun. [|

### 73373: Stress in the modern world

Stress in the modern world 
CCORDING to United Nations 
A statistics, the world’s urban pop- 
ulation has doubled since 1950 
and may double again by the end of this 
century, by which time three-quarters of 
the population of developed countries 
and one-third to one half of the popula- 
tion in developing countries will be living 
in cities. Current estimates suggest that as 
a result of both population growth and 
migration, the number of poor people 
clustered in slums and shanty-towns is 
increasing annually by 10 to 15 per cent. 
Conditions in these places are appalling. 
The result is tension, depression and vio- 
lence superimposed on physical hardship 
and a constant threat of disease. 
According to the Athenian statesman 
Pericles (495-429 BC), “health is that 
state of moral, mental and physical well- 
being which enables man to face any crisis 
in life with the utmost facility and grace”. 
This ancient, definition. highlights two 
critically important points: firstly that 
health concerns man’s interaction with 
his living conditions, and secondly that he 
may lose his capacity to adapt if the life 
crisis is severe enough. 
Much more recently, this insight has 
been echoed in the terms of a Swedish 
measure, the Public Health Service Bill 
(1984-1985), which declares that “Our 
health is determined in large measure by 
our living conditions and lifestyle. ...” 
The Bill goes on to state that “The health 
risks in contemporary society take the 
form of, for instance, work, traffic and 
living environments that are physically 
and socially deficient, unemployment 
and the threat of unemployment, abuse 
of alcohol and narcotics, consumption of 
tobacco and unsuitable dietary habits, as 
well as psychological and social strains 
associated with our relationships—and 
lack of relationships—with our fellow 
beings.” 
by Lennart Levi 
The Bill strongly advocates what is 
called a “holistic approach” to such prob- 
lems and attempts to solve them, mean- 
ing that “people’s symptoms and ill- 
nesses, their causes and consequences, 
are appraised in both a medical and a 
psychological and social perspective”. 
Bearing this in mind, let us look at some 
of these possible “causes” in the human 
environment, including some of those in 
the world’s major cities in developing and 
developed countries. 
According to recent United Nations 
and World Bank statistics, half of the 
countries of Africa and southeast Asia, 
including four of the five largest, with a 
combined population of almost 2,000 mil- 
lion, have an annual median per capita 
income of less than $300. This mass pov- 
erty leads to hunger, undernourishment 
and malnutrition for vast legions of chil- 
dren in the developing world. 
In the worst of cases, children die. In 
the “best” of cases, they grow up with 
physical and mental disabilities. When 
they reach sexual maturity, therefore, itis 
even more difficult for them to plan their 
families and care for their children, who 
then become even more malnourished, 
even more disabled, and even less com- 
petent to care for the following genera- 
tion of children. Thus a descending spiral 
is created causing morbidity, death and 
suffering for hundreds of millions more in 
the poor countries of the world. 
According to recent UNICEF reports, 
in the developing countries 15 million 
children die annually before the age of

five, most of them because of lack of 
potable water, adequate nutrition and 
basic hygiene. In many African and some 
Latin American countries, plagued by 
hunger and shortage of water, this means 
almost every other child. 
The Food and Agriculture Organiza- 
tion of the United Nations (FAQ) and the 
World Bank report that at least 430 mil- 
lion human beings are malnourished or 
undernourished. In the developing coun- 
tries about 60 per cent of the population 
has no access to safe potable water; 75 per

cent has no access to basic hygiene— 
simple latrines, ways to dispose of house- 
hold rubbish, and personal and food 
hygiene. 
Only 19 per cent of the population of 
these countries has access to housing of 
acceptable quality. Four out of every five 
households live in miserable huts in the 
countryside or in shacks made of burlap, 
cardboard and sheet metal in the slums of 
the large cities. Public health services are 
available to less than 15 per cent of the 
rural and urban poor. 
Such conditions cause acute physical 
and psychological and social stress by 
creating threats to survival, health and 
well-being, to self-esteem, to close 
attachment to others, to the sense of 
belonging to a valued group. These 
threats can in turn provoke potentially 
pathogenic reactions leading to further 
increases in sickness and mortality 
rates. 
But causes of psychological and social 
stress are also extremely common in 
developed countries, in all types of social 
and economic systems. In the United 
States, for example, 13.7 million children 
have unemployed or absent fathers. One 
out of three white and three out of five 
black children will experience marital dis- 
ruption before reaching the age of six- 
teen. Most of them will grow up in 
women-headed families, which are six 
times as likely to be below the poverty 
level. In 1978, 17 per cent of all children 
in the United States under eighteen (11 
per cent white, 27 per cent Hispanic, 41 
per cent black) lived in poverty, i.e. in 
conditions of run-down housing, heavy 
traffic, overcrowding, risk of contagion, 
accidents, injuries, pollution, violence, 
abuse and neglect, 
When people are exposed to stress- 
inducing conditions of this kind— 
whether it is a question of lack of control 
over their lives, combined with excessive 
demands, unsatisfied needs, expectations 
that cannot be fulfilled, overstimulation, 
or role conflicts—most of them experi- 
ence “dysphoric” reactions such as feel-

medical treatment, vaccination and safe drinking water is an essential part of a global

ings of anxiety, depression, uneasiness, 
apathy, alienation and hypochondria. 
In Sweden, statistics produced by the 
National Board of Health and Welfare 
(1978) show that every third four-year- 
old has mental problems (with symptoms 
such as bed-wetting, aggressivity, noctur- 
nal fears). Every third adult suffers from 
malaise, sleep disorders, fatigue, dejec- 
tion or anxiety. Every seventh working 
person is mentally exhausted at the end of 
the working day. Every other man and 
three women out of four will suffer from 
pronounced mental decompensation 
some time in his or her life up to the age of 
sixty. Every tenth man has an alcohol 
problem. Two thousand people commit 
suicide every year, and 20,000 attempt to 
do so (in a population of 8.3 million). 
Taken together, these figures mean 
that approximately every third or fourth 
Swede lives a life in which malaise, anx- 
iety, fatigue or dejection is a common 
component. Moreover, the situation did 
not improve from 1968 to 1974, in spite of 
a considerable increase over this period in 
material wealth and social security. This 
rather alarming picture assumes a further 
dimension when related to the ambitious 
goals and very considerable material 
means of the Swedish welfare state. 
According to studies recently sum- 
marized by the World Health Organiza- 
tion (WHO), there are at least 48 million 
drug abusers in the world. But this is only 
one example of stress-related pathogenic 
behaviour. Others include tobacco 
dependence, quoted as the primary cause 
of one-third of all cases of cancer, 75 per 
cent of chronic bronchitis and 25 per cent 
of myocardial infarction in the United 
States. 
As well as reacting emotionally to the 
stresses and strains of modern life and 
behaving in potentially disease-provok- 
ing ways, we also react physiologically— 
with our internal organs. Coping with 
stress influences basic physiological reac- 
tions in our central nervous system as well 
as our ductless (endocrine) glands. The 
biologically active agents of the glands, Ph

the hormones, together with nervous 
impulses, influence virtually every cell in 
the organism. If prolonged, pronounced, 
or recurrent, such reactions can eventu- 
ally lead to physical ill health, 
A WHO report (1986) also mentions 
the high prevalence of somatic symptoms 
resulting from psychological and social 
distress, i.e. in cases with no ascertaina- 
ble organ pathology, or with complaints 
of discomfort disproportionate to the 
physical problem. This accounts for from 
30 to 50 per cent of all consultations in 
developed countries and for from 15 to 25 
per cent of those coming to the attention 
of health care personnel in developing 
countries—the largest single complaint 
category in primary care. 
Altogether, the resulting conditions 
make for extreme and ever greater suffer- 
ing for over one-quarter of mankind. It is 
true that people can adapt even to 
extreme environmental influences. Yet, 
as indicated above, this adaptation takes 
its toll in terms of emotional, behavioural 
and/or physiological deformation. 
Although a cause-effect relationship is 
difficult to prove in specific cases, circum- 
stantial evidence supports the existence 
of such a relationship. 
In developed and developing countries 
alike, governmental action against such 
problems is often of a troubleshooting 
nature; it addresses only one or a few 
specific problems. It may include the 
provision of medical treatment, vaccina- 
tion, food shipments, or wells of potable 
water. Not infrequently, it takes the form 
of acute disaster aid in situations where 
disasters are usually chronic. In such 
cases, intervention is usually admin- 
istered by one of many specialized agen- 
cies, with no or insufficient co-operation 
with other specialized agencies. One 
health problem—say, ill-health caused by 
pollution—may therefore be attacked, 
while another, such as poverty-induced 
undernourishment, is neglected, or vice 
versa. 
This brief, oversimplified account illus- 
trates the existence of many interacting 
and pathogenic factors in the human eco- 
system. If one of its components is influ- 
enced, effects will occur in many of the 
others. Consequently, it will probably be 
impossible to cope successfully with cur- 
rent and future urban and health prob- 
lems by considering—in research, 
therapy and/or prevention—just one or 
two of the components of the total eco- 
system. Success will be more likely if as 
many as possible of the critical ones can 
be taken into account. n

### 73374: Solo to the Pole: an interview with Jean-Louis Etienne

 
Solo to the Pole 
An interview with Jean-Louis Etienne 
On 11 May 1986, forty-year-old 
Jean-Louis Etienne, a French 
nutritionist and doctor specializing 
in the care of athletes, reached the 
North Pole after a solitary hike last- 
ing sixty-three days. Wearing cross- 
country skis and pulling an ultra- 
light sledge, he had covered 750 
- kilometres in temperatures as low 
as -52°C and in winds of up to 100 
kilometres an hour. The Unesco 
Courier talked to him about his 
exploit. 
What motivated you to undertake your soli- 
tary walk to the North Pole? Was it the 
challenge of a great sporting achievement, 
or was it the scientific interest of an experi- 
ment designed to measure the limits of 
human resistance in an extreme environ- 
ment? 
It was neither. The fact is that such motives 
are often advanced to give respectability to 
a taste for adventure, a love of open spaces 
and the pleasures of discovery. There is 
really no need to go such a long way just to 
carry out a scientific experiment. It would 
be perfectly possible to set up a cold cham- 
ber right here in Paris and live in it for three 
  
weeks, or two months, at a temperature of 
-47°C. Forme, to go to the North Pole was a 
dream, just as earlier I had dreamed of 
climbing Mount Everest, rounding Cape 
Horn, or sailing round the world. It was also 
a human and, above all, a technological 
challenge. 
What exactly do you mean by that? What 
equipment did you take with you? 
The North Pole is located in the centre of an 
ocean of ice, the Arctic, but it is no skating 
rink! The terrain is very uneven. The ice is 
cracked, sheets are superimposed on sheets 
or collide and compress to form ridges. You 
can never see the horizon, and your pro- 
gress is constantly hampered by the ice 
which can be completely churned up for 
kilometres on end. It is rather as if you 
decided to cross Paris in a straight line by 
walking across the roof-tops. What is more, 
this extremely difficult terrain is only 
accessible for about two months of the year, 
between the beginning of March, when the 
Polar day dawns, and mid-May, when the 
ice-pack begins to break up as summer 
approaches. It is a real race against time, 
and to travel fast you have to travel light. To 
equip myself for this undertaking I made 
use of materials that have the best low-tem- 
perature performance. With the aid of an

engineer friend of mine, I perfected a sledge 
made of Kevlar, a light but very tough poly- 
mer which is being increasingly used in 
aeronautics. The sledge was 2.20 metres 
long by 60 centimetres wide and weighed 3 
kilograms. I managed to get the load down 
to 50 kilograms. To keep my bearings on the 
ice-pack I carried with me a small Kevlar- 
encased safety-beacon-cum-radio-emitter, 
the signal from which was picked up by 
satellite and transmitted to a computer at 
the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales 
(National Space Studies Centre) in 
Toulouse, France. Michel Franco, who was 
acting as my back-up at our base camp at 
Resolute Bay on Cornwallis Island in the far 
north of Canada, questioned the computer 
by telephone every evening and then 
informed me of my position. The beacon- 
emitter was powered by lithium batteries 
which are capable of withstanding 
extremely low temperatures. 
Did you also use a compass? 
No. The magnetic pole, to which compass 
needles point, is some 1,500 kilometres 
from the geographical pole through which 
passes the axis of rotation of the Earth, and 
it was to this “true” North Pole that I was 
heading. Furthermore, compasses are dis- 
oriented by the magnetic fields in this 
region. Here the sun is the only guide. I 
therefore had a watch made on which the 
hour hand made only one complete revolu- 
tion in twenty-four hours. Knowing that the 
sun is in the east at 0600 hours, in the south 
at 1200 hours, in the west at 1800 hours and 
On his expedition to the North Pole Jean- 
Louis Etienne took specially designed 
lightweight equipment weighing 50 kg, 
left. His sledge weighed only 3 kg. 
in the north at 2400 hours, all I had to do to 
find my bearings was to point the hour hand 
in the direction of the sun. 
Why did you travel on skis? 
Skis are indispensable. The ice-pack is 
fractured and there are crevasses every- 
where, into which it is easy to fall unless you 
take great care. Skis enable you to cross 
them. In most places the ice-pack is from 2 
to 3 metres thick, but where it breaks the 
water freezes again forming a very thin skin 
of ice. Skis spread your weight over a larger 
surface and enable you to walk over very 
recently-formed ice. I used nordic cross- 
country skis to the undersides of which T had 
stuck synthetic anti-slip skins. In the past, 
people used sealskins for this purpose 
because of the rigidity of the seal’s body- 
hair which enables it to climb on ice without 
slipping. When, once a fortnight, Michel 
Franco brought me fresh supplies by aero- 
plane, he would also fit me out with new 
skins. 
What did you have to eat? 
Drawing on the recorded experience of pre- 
vious polar expeditions, I had concocted 
some special food rations. At the beginning 
I allowed myself a daily ration of 4,000 calo- 
ries. However, this proved to be insufficient 
and I was somewhat hungry, sol stepped up 
my daily ration to 5,000 calories. My meals 
for a day were vacuum-packed in bags of 
about 1 kilogram. As this was dried food I 
would melt some ice to go with it (only 
newly-formed ice is salty; old surface ice 
loses its salt by gravity). I would heat up the 
water on a petrol cooker (at those tempera- 
tures gas is unusable) and pour it on the 
dried food to produce a kind of porridge. In 
the evenings my supper consisted of soup 
and a freeze-dried pre-cooked dish. 
The surface of the ice-floe is rugged. The 
blocks of ice fracture, collide against each 
other and impact to form walls extending 
over several km. 
Did you also draw on the cold weather sur- 
vival techniques of the inhabitants of the far 
north? Did you, for example, dress in their 
fashion? 
Not at all. These people are hunters who 
live in encampments, do not travel far and 
do not go in for comparable, long-lasting 
physical or sporting activities. They are not 
interested in the North Pole, where there is 
nothing and where life is not possible, and 
they have never been there. In this they are 
similar to the Nepalese who would not 
dream of climbing Everest. As far asdressis 
concerned, clothes are now made that are 
much warmer and much lighter than tradi- 
tional Eskimo clothing. The clothes I wore 
were made of Qualofil, a synthetic fibre 
with very good insulating qualities. 
Your journey lasted sixty-three days. Can 
you describe a typical day? 
I used to get up at four in the morning and 
set off at six. I would walk for eight to ten 
hours a day, until about three or four in the 
afternoon. Then I would stop, switch on my 
beacon-emitter and put up my tent. After 
that I would have a snack and rest until 
seven, when I would contact Michel Franco 
by radio. After that I would write up my log 
book, have my evening meal and go to 
bed. 
Weren’t you ever afraid that you might go to 
sleep in the cold and never wake up again? 
No. When you are in good physical shape, 
as I was, you are always first woken up by

Nutritionist and medical doctor, Jean- 
Louis Etienne devised the contents of 
compact rations to provide him with 5,000 
calories a day. The food was freeze-dried 
and vacuum-packed in numbered packets 
each weighing 1 kg. Supplies were flown to 
him every two weeks. 
the cold. You only die of cold if you are ill, 
or tired—for example, after being stuck for 
several days on a mountain ledge. In that 
case, after a long struggle, you get 
exhausted and there is a danger of falling 
asleep for good. 
Did you manage to warm yourself up in your 
tent? 
No. The temperatures in the tent varied 
between -52°C and -20°C. I had to take 
great care, before going to bed, to brush off 
the frozen perspiration which covered me 
like a skin under my watertight clothing and 
which could, during the night, have brought 
on a chill. T used to make myself a hot water 
bottle with a 1-litre aluminium bottle which 
I would fill with boiling water and hold 
against myself inside my sleeping-bag. 
Did you suffer from solitude in those vast 
frozen expanses? 
Solitude is not a handicap, it is a fantastic 
force which enables you to bring all your 
resources fully into play. Going to the 
North Pole is no joyride. You have to be on 
the look-out all the time. You have to pick 
your route and avoid falling and injuring 
yourself. You are living permanently on the 
razor’s edge. At the same time, however, 
you can give free rein to your imagination. 
Blocks of ice are transformed into mountain 
peaks, into towers or cathedrals. Some- 
times I would say to myself: I shall go on to 
that house ... to that mountain ... After 
about three weeks to a month, when you 
have got into your stride and the landscape 
starts to seem monotonous, other thoughts 
take over. I have never thought so much 
about my childhood and my family. And 
then there was God ... the God of the Arc- 
tic, the God of the Pole, of whom I 
demanded right of passage. It was, as it 
were, a sort of journey of initiation. Yet I 
never felt any anxiety. 
But did you feel fear? 
Yes, twice. Once when I saw the tracks of a 
bear, and then when the ice gave way under 
my feet. My reflex was to fall flat on the 
sheet ice and to crawl. Only afterwards did 
I realize that I might have had a serious 
accident. 
When you got back, did you undergo a series 
of medical examinations? 
Yes. I had lost six kilograms. The most 
important test was an evaluation of my 
adaptation to the cold. As had done before 
I set out, I underwent tests in a cold cham- 
ber. [stayed in the chamber, naked, for two 
hours, in a temperature of 1°C and in an 
airstream of a speed of 8 metres per second, 
which is the equivalent of a temperature of 
-10°C. My internal temperature and my 
consumption of oxygen was then measured. 
Before setting out, over a period of two 
hours, I had maintained a temperature of 
37°C at the cost of a certain consumption of 
energy. On my return, it was observed that 
my temperature went down progressively to 
35.5°C before my body began to fight 
against the cold, and that my energy con- 
sumption was considerably lower. In other 
words, I had become accustomed to living 
at a below normal temperature and, from 
the point of view of energy expenditure, my 
two hours in the cold chamber had been 
very economical. Like primitive man, or 
like nomads who sleep in the open air, my 
body’s thermoregulatory mechanism had 
adapted to hypothermic (low tempera- 
ture) conditions. Thus, modern man, 
accustomed to high temperatures, can 
return fairly rapidly to the physical ther- 
moregulatory comportment of his primitive 
ancestors. 
Has this experiment of yours added to the 
sum of scientific knowledge? 
From it have gained a medical observation 
on human adaptation to cold, as well as a 
nutritional study—the rations I developed 
are now being used in France by the men of 
the Chasseurs Alpins Regiment and by par- 
ticipants in the Paris-Dakar car rally. The 
watch I developed has been put on the mar- 
ket and the tests using the beacon-emitter 
supplied by the Centre National d’Etudes 
Spatiales are considered to be conclusive, I 
have also worked with Professor Jouvet, of 
Lyon, on the subject of sleep. In fact, con- 
trary to all expectations, I slept very well 
throughout my journey. But it. must be 
repeated that scientific research, and par- 
ticularly medical research, should be based 
on a large number of experiments. No valid 
observations can be based on a single case. 
Most of all, I have the impression that, in 
the eyes of young people, [ have taken over 
the role of those who first aroused in me my 
passion for adventure. 
After the North Pole, you now plan to cross 
the Antarctic. 
This time I shall not be alone. I shall have 
three travelling companions, two Amer- 
icans and someone from the Soviet Union. 
We shall also have two dog teams. We shall 
cross the continent, keeping in contact with 
a polar sailing vessel which will hug the 
coast and transmit the pictures we shall be 
sending. This expedition, planned for 1989- 
1990, will coincide with the expiry of the 
Antarctic Treaty (1961-1991) which regul- 
ates the status of the Antarctic. We want to 
focus attention on this immense territory 
which, under 2,000 metres of ice, contains 
great mineral wealth which in four years 
time will belong to no one. It is our hope 
that all industrial or strategic exploitation of 
the continent will be excluded and that it 
will retain its international status and its 
vocation as a land of scientific research. 
Above all, our hope is that it will remain a 
land of silence. n

### 73375: Marathon man

Marathon Man 
by Bredo Berntsen 
enjoyed a popular revival in 
recent years, and runners such as 
Paavo Nurmi, Emil Zatopek, Abebe 
Bikila and Grethe Waitz are household 
names. But it was 150 years ago that the 
greatest runner of all time was at the peak 
of his career. He was a Norwegian named 
Mensen Ernst. 
His real name was Mons Monsen Oyri. 
He was the son of a poor tenant farmer 
from Leikanger on the Sognefjord where 
he was born in 1795. He lived there until 
he was about fifteen years old, when he 
moved to the town of Bergen. He went to 
sea, and won his first competitive run in 
Cape Province in 1813. 
As a seaman and adventurer he visited 
the American, African, Asian and Aus- 
tralian continents, acquiring along the 
way survival skills that were later to help 
him navigate, wheedle and bluff his way 
through his extraordinary journeys. The 
only surviving contemporary portrait of 
the “Running King”, as he was known in 
Norwegian, shows him cradling a sex- 
tant. 
In 1818 he arrived in London. Itis here 
that he officially became a “pedestrian”, 
a runner or walker who covered long dis- 
tances in return for money. Here he also 
took his professional name, Mensen

Ernst. His subsequent career was to last 
for twenty-five years. 
His first important run was in the spring 
of 1819, from London to Portsmouth (116 
kilometres) in nine hours. His popularity 
was assured when he then covered the 240 
kilometres from London to Liverpool in 
thirty-two hours. 
After a time he began to long for the 
Continent, however, and in 1820 crossed 
the Channel again, travelling on foot to 
Annenrode manor in Miihlhausen (in 
what is now the German Democratic 
Republic), where he made a number of 
life-long friends. From then on he lived as 
a professtonal runner, and his fame as the 
greatest runner of all time spread quickly 
as he ran from city to city—Berlin, 
Prague, Rome—across the Continent. In 
1826 he put on a demonstration in 
Copenhagen, where the high fees he 
earned included 100 “daler” from the 
Danish King Frederick VI. Ironically, his 
native Norway was one of the few coun- 
tries through which he never ran. 
After some years Mensen Ernst came 
to see himself as something of an interna- 
tionalist. He became a genuine traveller, 
curious about foreign cultures and 
customs; he learned to speak French, 
English and German well, and knew 
some [talian and Turkish.

The only surviving contemporary portrait 
of Mensen Ernst 
In 1832, aged thirty-seven, Ernst went 
to Paris in order to plan an audacious run 
to Moscow. Among those who helped 
him organize the stakes was a Swedish 
diplomat, Count Léwenhielm. Ernst was 
to receive 3,800 francs if he covered the 
distance in fifteen days. He left Paris on 
11 June, arriving in Kaiserlantern two 
days later. “I felt | was sailing ... on my 
two unique frigates,” he was quoted 
later, in a German book about him writ- 
ten in 1838. “Those who witnessed my 
running considered me eccentric, or else 
a fool, or possessed by the devil.” 
On 18 June he crossed the Polish river 
Vistula and next day was in Russia. He 
actually reached Moscow a day earlier 
than expected. The commander there 
had prepared to greet him, but because of 
Ernst’s early arrival and the ragged state 
of his clothing he was taken at first for a 
beggar. He had covered about 2,500 kilo- 
metres, or more than 170 kilometres 
daily. 
How did Ernst adapt to the extreme 
conditions encountered on his journeys, 
the burning sun, cold winds, pouring 
rain? We know that he had a strict set of 
rules that he followed all his life. He stuck 
to a simple diet, for example: mostly 
bread and cheese, a few vegetables, less 
frequently cold meat; but he never ate 
warm food. He also preferred to sleep 
outdoors, believing that lying on hard 
ground kept the body supple. If he did 
sleep indoors it was always on a hard 
bench, never a soft bed. His only weak- 
ness was for wine, which he used to drink 
by the bottle even on his runs, but with no 
apparent ill effects. 
By the time he returned to Paris from 
his Moscow run, Mensen Ernst was a 
hero. He had become a living legend who 
attracted rapturous audiences of thou- 
sands. 
In 1833, he set out from Munich for 
Old London Bridge in the early 19th cen- 
tury, around the time when Mensen Ernst 
began his running career.

Nauplion, then the capital of the newly

months his offer was accepted. His depar- 
ture on 6 June was cheered by a crowd of 
20,000 outside Nymphenburg Palace. 
This was a particularly dramatic jour- 
ney, partly because of the rugged land- 
scape, partly because of some unusually 
severe problems Ernst encountered 
along the way. In Montenegro he was set 
upon by five robbers wielding pistols and 
swords; as well as his money, they took 
his maps, compass and quadrant, but for- 
tunately not the letters. He managed to 
find his way to the town of Cattaro, where 
he got food and drink, new maps and 
compass, and started out again—only to 
be arrested as a spy. He spent three days 
in jail before he was freed by the Pasha of 
Janina, who “looked more like a Western 
general than an Oriental Pasha”, as Ernst 
later said.

On 1 July he stood outside the King’s 
residence in Nauplion to receive his 
award of 1,000 guilders. He had covered 
2,700 kilometres in just over twenty-four 
days. Allowing about four days’ delay for 
various mishaps, he had done the run in 
twenty days, or about 135 kilometres 
daily. These statistics are so extraordin- 
ary that we are lucky to have contempo- 
rary sources to verify them. 
Ernst’s third and most dramatic project 
began with an offer by British merchants 
of the East India Company in Con- 
stantinople: £150 to carry important doc- 
uments to Calcutta. He left on 28 July 
1836. The vigorous Norwegian had 
thought the journey would take perhaps 
six weeks; in fact he did it in four, on a 
route that took him through Anatolia, 
and finally across the Indian sub-con- 
tinent. 
On his twenty-eight-day return jour-

Ernst. 
His fourth epic run was to be his last. It 
began when the German author, proprie- 
tor and adventurer, Count Hermann von 
Piickler-Muskau, thirty years before 
Stanley and Livingstone, asked him to 
find the source of the White Nile. Count 
Hermann had a keen interest in running 
stemming from a visit to Greece in 1837, 
when he had watched the Marathon and 
heard about the Norwegian’s exploits 
four years previously. 
Ernst left the Count’s estate in Prussian 
Silesia on 11 May, 1842. He passed Con- 
stantinople and reached Jerusalem in 
thirty days, and then ran the 500 kilo- 
metres to Cairo. After some months in 
Cairo he headed south along the Nile. 
But now his luck had run out. He suc- 
cumbed to dysentery on 22 January 1843, 
ending his legendary career in the desert 
near Syene, now Aswan. Ten years latera 
Norwegian newspaper declared: “The 
world will never see his like again.” Nor 
has it! u
