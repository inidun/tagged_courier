A WORLD INQUIRY 
INTO EDUCATION ®mCouricr 
~ In 1971, Unesco set up an International 
~~ Commission on the Development of 
Education. The. conclusions of the 
Commission's world-wide inquiry have 
just been published by Unesco and offer 
a bold blueprint for tomorrow’s children 
and adults alike. This issue is devoted 
in its entirety to this unique study and 
its guidelines, which, if adopted by 
nations, could well serve as an answer 
to the world crisis in education.

Bw 
I- an international commission 
which has just reported to Unesco is right, education 
throughout the world is likely to change out of recognition 
in the next generation. 
To begin with, education will start much earlier as the 
importance of pre-school education is more widely recog- 
nized; then it will never end, for the signs are that the 
concept of lifelong education, already an ideal, is about 
to become a practical reality. Examinations, the bane of 
every student's existence, may wither away, for they will 
be meaningless to people who are learning at their own 
pace. Fixed subjects and curricula are likely to go into 
the melting pot and schools themselves, if not as physical 
locations then at least as places exclusively for children, 
are threatened with extinction. 
Above all, spirit and aims will change: the emphasis will 
be on learning, not teaching, and education’s products will

### 52669: Blueprint for a 'learning society'

" not be measured in terms of so much knowledge dispen- 
sed but of completely developed human beings. 
The International Commission on the Development of 
Education which arrived at these conclusions was called 
on to make proposals that would help governments work 
out strategies to meet their own educational situations (1). 
The Commission drew on educational experience through- 
out the world, Furthermore, the composition of the 
seven-man commission—which Included members from 
France, Syria, the People’s Republic of Congo, the Soviet 
Union, Chile, Iran and the United States—makes the fact 
that they were able to reach wide agreement remarkable 
and compelling. 
F OR the ordinary reader, two 
things are perhaps particularly striking in the Commission’s 
report: its understanding—and even acceptance—of the 
reasons for youth's rebellion against present-day education; 
its belief that lifelong education is not just a theory but 
already a fact which educational systems should take 
account of to help people cope in a changing world where 
the quantity of knowledge increases faster than individuals 
can keep pace with, and where, in some countries, half the 
working population are in jobs that did not exist at the 
beginning of this century. 
Striking, too, Is the commission's analysis of what edu- 
cation has been and is now: in other words, its diagnosis 
of what is wrong with it. In the commission’s view, man 
is a learning animal. Learning is both natural and necessary 
to him but the systems he has set up have all had a 
tendency to set out to be a system and to end up as a 
straitjacket, 
Why? Because the tradition they were established to pass 
on became a dead weight, because school became an 
institution instead of an approach to life, because there 
was too much emphasis on the written word, too much 
subject-division, too much authoritarianism—in a word, too 
much school and not enough learning. 
The present situation, the commission finds, is paradoxi- 
cal. There has never been so much demand for education 
(between 1960 and 1968, the total number of school-age 
children in the world increased by 20 per cent); and there 
has never been so much dissatisfaction with, and rejection 
of, education by the young. Never before has so much 
education been provided but never has society so widely 
rejected the product of institutionalized education, as the 
increased rate of educated unemployed in many countries 
goes to show. 
What is to be done about the situation? The Commission 
does ndt lay down ground rules for the educational sys- 
tems of the world. But it does suggest guidelines, and 
from its considerations of the possible strategies to be 
adopted a number of watchwords for educational reform 
emerge, Among these are democracy, flexibility and con- 
tinuity. 
The move towards democracy in schooling has several 
causes, Including the general demand for qualified labour 
to meet the demands of stepped-up technology. In some 
countries ideology is behind the move, in others, the con- 
sequences of decolonization. In some cases the spur is 
even the fear of social unrest. But the report points out 
that there is a wide gap between a decision of principle 
to provide universal education and the democratization of 
the systems, for, as they are currently structured, inequa- 
lity is built into them. “The universal right to education, in 
which contemporary civilization takes such premature 
pride”, says the commission, “is often refused to the most 
underprivileged.” 
Nutrition, family background and factors like housing all 
 
(1) The report of the International Commission on the Development 
of Education has been published under the title “Learning to Be” as a 
Unesco-Harrap co-edition (see inside back cover). In addition to the 
French language edition ("Apprendre a étre”, published as a co-edition 
Unesco-Fayard, Paris) editions in Arabic, Iranian and Spanish are in 
preparation and publication in ten other language editions is planned. 
play a role in success at school. Throughout the world, 
the disparities between social classes are strikingly reflec- 
ted in university enrolments, 
Merely multiplying schools is not the answer. What Is 
needed is not equal treatment for everybody, but provision 
for each individual of a suitable education at a suitable pace 
for his particular needs. 
Real solutions to the problems of inequality can only 
be found in a sweeping re-organization on the lines of 
permanent, lifelong education for “once education becomes 
continual, ideas as to what constitutes success and failure 
will change. An individual who fails at a given age and 
level in the course of his educational career will have other 
opportunities. He will no longer be relegated for life 
to the ghetto of his own failure. 
“Human beings, consciously or not, keep on learning 
and training themselves throughout their lives, above all 
through the influence of their environment.” 
Recognition of this should bring revolutionary conse- 
quences: not the extension of school by evening classes 
but the integration of child and adult education; not the 
occasional use of television to supply the lacks of 
schooling but whole-hearted employment of media which 
already teach as much and more as lessons. Education 
“first helps the child to live his own life as he deserves 
to do but its essential mission is to prepare the future 
adult for various forms of autonomy and self-learning”. 
‘Schools, insofar as they continue to exist as we have 
known them, cease, under this system, to be reserved 
to children and become places of learning for future and 
present adults, Pupils cease to regard learning as the 
acquisition of a certain quantity of knowledge within a cer- 
tain time; teachers cease to be time-keepers and progress- 
chasers and become channels through which pupils can 
get at the knowledge they need. 
Flexibility, the third characteristic of the education of 
the future, is obviously necessary if lifelong education is to 
work. As the divisions between subjects are eroded by 
advances in knowledge, curricula will have to change to 
meet specific needs—grown-ups who want to turn to, say, 
radio engineering will not necessarily have the time to 
plough through the whole syllabus of heat and light before 
they come to sound. 
In any case, says the report, flexibility Is required by 
modern conditions. “At the rate technology is advancing, 
many people during the course of their working life will 
hold several jobs or frequently change their place of work... 
Education rarely equips the individual -for adapting to 
change, to the unknown. The world has not yét widely 
accepted the principle of a general polytechnical educa- 
tion at secondary level—an education which would gua- 
rantee professional mobility and lead to lifelong education.” 
Yet such an education has given positive results where it 
has been tried. 
Corsommnon of new tech- 
niques occupies a substantial portion of the report. For the 
first time since the textbook, the exercise book and the 
blackboard were invented, the “hardware” of the teaching 
trade has been substantially increased by a wide range of 
audio-visual aids, closed-circuit TV and computers, 
The focus of all the innovations of the last ten years 
is significantly the same: on self-education, on learning, not 
teaching. 
This being so, the commission believes that the school 
“will be less and less in a position to claim the educational 
functions in society as.its special prerogative. All sectors 
—public administration, industry, communications, trans- 
port—must take part in promoting education. In the com- 
mission's view, the trend must be towards the “learning 
society”. 
How this learning society might be achieved makes up 
the last portion of this close-packed report, and its twenty- 
one recommendations on the directions of tomorrow's 
educational strategies provide plenty of material for thought 
and argument (see page 20). |

1. many countries today 
education is regarded as an excep- 
tionally difficult problem, but all 
countries without exception agree it 
is a task of the utmost importance.

better world proclaim education to be 
the keystone without which their work 
is in vain. In setting up the Interna- 
tional Commission for Educational

Social Affairs. 
Development, Unesco has shown that 
it is alive to the political issues of 
our time. 
Educational systems with long- 
established traditions that have stood 
the test of time, needing only a few 
adjustments to keep them running 
smoothly, are now the target for cri- 
ticisms that often question their 
whole essence. Youth today is in 
more or less open revolt against 
established educational methods and 
institutions, though it is not always 
easy to determine exactly how much 
of its general unrest and outbursts of 
rebellion may be ascribed to this 
specific cause. 
In the developing countries educa- 
tional systems of recent date, usually 
copied from a foreign model, have 
run into trouble. 
Emerging from the colonial period, 
the developing countries threw them- 
selves wholeheartedly into the fight 
against ignorance, which they viewed 
quite rightly as an essential prelimi- 
nary to lasting liberation and real 
development. 
They believed it would be enough 
to wrest the weapon of technical 
superiority, as it were, from the hands 
of the colonizers. They have now 
realized that the models they chose 
(which were often already out of date 
for those for whom and by whom 
they were devised) are not suited 
either to their needs or to their prob- 
lems. 
Their investment in education is far 
beyond their financial capacity. More 
graduates are produced than the 
economy can absorb, so that many 
remain unemployed; this is not only 
unprofitable but causes psychological 
and social damage so extensive as to 
disturb the balance of society. 
As they cannot bring themselves to 
renounce one of the basic principles 
for which so many sacrifices were 
made and so many battles fought, they 
are faced with an “agonizing reapprai- 
sal”. Such a situation calls for an

Lastly, some States regard their own 
educational systems as fairly satisfact- 
ory and there is no authority competent 
to say whether they are right or wrong. 
They may perhaps be deluding them- 
selves and fail to perceive some deep- 
lying deterioration invisible to the 
superficial gaze. In that case the 
awakening will be a rude one, as 
France found in May 1968. But equally 
possibly these countries may have 
succeeded, by good management or 
good luck, in achieving this adjustment 
which others find so difficult. 
Yet even those modern States 
which think they are doing quite well 
and are therefore not troubled by any 
fears of crisis or pangs of conscience, 
do not necessarily feel that they have 
nothing to worry about. On the con- 
trary, they generally pay great atten- 
tion to modernizing and improving their 
institutions and methods and are not 
afraid to innovate. 
  
But they cannot ignore the rest of 
the world. 
When they are scaling the heights 
of knowledge and power, how can they 
fail to feel concern and even anxiety 
at those vast areas of ignorance still 
darkening our planet, like those other 
persistent shadows of hunger and 
early mortality? 
The great change we are now exper- 
iencing calls in question the unity and 
the future of the species and man’s 
very identity. The danger lies not 
only in the painful prospect of severe 
inequalities, hardship and suffering, 
but in a real dichotomy of the human 
race, split into superiors and inferiors, 
masters and slaves, supermen and 
submen, 
Among the risks inherent in this 
situation would be not only those of 
conflict and disaster (for modern 
weapons of mass destruction might 
well fall into the hands of deprived 
rebellious groups), but the fundamental

risk of dehumanization affecting priv- 
ileged and oppressed alike. 
Some people think there is no need 
to “dramatize” the- current problem. 
This is -an extremely mistaken view. 
The situation we are considering is 
entirely new and quite without preced- 
ent. For it does not proceed, as is 
still too often repeated, from a simple 
phenomenon of quantitative growth, 
If we take a broad view of education 
through the ages, we see that advan- 
ces in education accompany economic 
progress. 
In stable societies of the agrarian 
type, education is concerned with the 
transmission of skills, traditions and 
values. It does not raise any special 
problems of its own, as distinct from 
social, political and religious problems. 
As the pace of economic progress 
quickens, the educational system natu- 
rally tends to dispense an increasing 
amount of knowledge to an increasing 
number of persons, since more elabor- 
ate production requires a more highly

### 52670: Education and the destiny of man

EDUCATION AND THE DESTINY OF MAN (Continued) 
A new commitment to the use of technology 
skilled labour force, and in addition, 
this labour force promotes further 
technical improvements, as it throws 
up inventors and innovators, 
In the long term, education is linked 
to social and political development as 
well as technical and economic pro- 
gress. Better educated people tend 
to assert their rights as citizens and 
if there are a lot of them, they press 
their claims for democracy. 
The view that educational institutions 
are purely conservative or even repres- 
sive forces is not correct. Of course, 
every institution is by its very nature 
a stabilizing influence, and teaching 
implies a tendency to repetition and a 
concern with form, formulas and form- 
ulation, in the same way as the prac- 
tice of law. In times of rapid change 
this dual aspect becomes more strik- 
ing; education then seems to be an 
obstacle to the movement which it has 
nevertheless provoked. 
H.:- however, there 
has been nothing comparable in its 
consequences to what we now call 
the scientific revolution. 
For in fact, much technical progress 
was made in earlier days through 
scientific observation and the discovery 
of “recipes” which involved no special 
intellectual grasp of the secret forces 
of nature. Only In relatively recent 
times have conquests through fund- 
amental research penetrated to the 
core of the problems examined, while 
at the same time their practical applic- 
ations have entered ever more rapidly 
into the daily life of the man in the 
street. 
The changes wrought by the 
18th century industrial revolution and 
the early machine age were concerned 
with the physical and muscular capac- 
ities of the workers; but the scientific 
revolution has invaded the intellectual 
field with the automatic transmission 
of information over any distance and 
the invention and constant improve- 
ment of computers. 
This phenomenon necessarily affects 
the whole of mankind. 
The effects of economic expansion 
may differ greatly according to the 
region and the social group, but mass 
media and cybernetics reach everyone 
everywhere. 
The scientific revolution thus places 
knowledge and training in an entirely 
new perspective; man now has new 
possibilities of thought and action and 
for the first time their context is truly 
universal, 
This fact inevitably comes to mind, 
but it should be stressed that people 
do not always deduce its logical con- 
sequences. 
In the economic and social sphere 
people are no longer so easily resign- 
ed to class distinctions or national 
disparities as in the days when these 
were regarded as ordained by the 
natural order of things. Nor are they 
resigned to educational underdevelop- 
ment, particularly since they have been 
led to believe that education for all is 
the key to economic advancement. 
The problem of democracy is even 
more cogent. All nations now aspire 
to democracy, and this has nothing 
whatever to do with their GNP or their 
enrolment rates. But the democracy 
to which they aspire is different from 
the type we have known hitherto. 
In this field no nation is really satis- 
fied with its performance; and it is a 
field where the development of the 
individual personality 1s paramount. 
The technological age brings un- 
deniable benefits and opens up vast 
prospects, but there is a debit side 
too. Scientists warn us of dangers 
on all sides, in terms that sometimes 
mask their hallucinatory quality—over- 
population to the point where it beco- 
mes inconceivable, destruction of the 
soil and the countryside, asphyxiation 
of cities, exhaustion of food and ener- 
gy resources, a new Flood caused by 
the melting of the polar icecap, mind- 
destroying chemicals in the atmos- 
phere, and so on... 
Some do not hesitate to propose 
the complete halting of growth—"zero 
growth"—on the grounds of limiting 
the damage; while others, without 
openly going to this extreme, advocate 
a revival of Malthusianism in the guise 
of an “ecology policy”. 
Such solutions would ultimately con- 
solidate international disparities and 
even accentuate distortions. Growth 
must therefore continue, but in order 
to exorcise its perils and reduce its 
harmful side effects, communities must 
be able to establish the necessary 
priorities and controls in a democratic 
manner, which assumes the presence 
of adequately educated, informed and 
responsible persons. 
Growth oriented towards the quality 
of life and the search for equilibrium 
in human affairs cannot be left to 
governments alone, bogged down in 
their problems of administration and 
often in systems founded on prejudice. 
Only public opinion, if it can shape 
world opinion, can manage to impose 
simple and obviously essential measu- 
res, yet postponed ad infinitum, such 
as a ban on nuclear weapons and the 
switching of some portion of the 
unproductive expenditure on military 
preparations to social purposes. 
If the people are to take over this 
role, which is within their power, they 
must become aware of their identity, 
- their aspirations, their strength; they 
must shake off their fatalism and their 
resignation, and this psychological 
confidence can only be acquired 
through education made available to 
all. 
D..ocor now appears 
to be the only way of preventing man 
from becoming the slave of the ma- 
chine and the only condition compati- 
ble with human dignity and the human 
intellect, and hence deserves our full 
support. 
The Commission considered it vital 
that science and technology become a 
basic element in education of every 
type and for all ages including chil- 
dren, adolescents and adults. 
Both developed and developing 
countries will have to devise very 
similar strategies, though their resour- 
ces differ. 
In the developed countries the educ- 
ational system always—or nearly 
always—has a dual character: the 
education it dispenses is pre-techno- 
logical and its social recruitment is 
élitist (in the case of higher education). 
This is the system—with the same 
characteristicse—which has generally 
been introduced into the developing 
countries, where it has the additional 
disadvantage of not being adjusted 
to the cultural background or to the 
social and human environment. 
In both cases, therefore, it is neces- 
sary to move from the pre-technolo- 
gical to the technological stage and to 
construct a broadly based education 
for the people on the foundation of an 
educational system limited to.the few, 
for whom it was a guarantee of jobs 
in the higher levels of the economy 
and the administration. 
Logically speaking, this dual trans- 
formation should be accomplished In 
one operation, but this has not always 
been the case. 
Surprising as it may seem, countries 
regarded as “developed” are faced

with an internal situation of educational 
underdevelopment. Students of work- 
ing-class origin exhibit (at least rela- 
tively speaking), symptoms of mal- 
adjustment and failure similar to those 
observed in the ex-colonial countries 
which adopted a western-style educ- 
ation, lock, stock and barrel. 
So the spotlight falls in both cases 
on the combined problems of motiv- 
ation and employment, which govern 
the intake and output of the educ- 
ational cycle. 
Motivation is the key to any modern 
education policy. 
Curiosity, the desire to understand, 
to know or to discover, is one of the 
basic drives in human nature. Through 
the notations devised by science it is 
now possible for the dullest minds to 
assimilate concepts which it needed a 
genius to discover. 
This ought to be the most powerful 
motivation, if it were encouraged. But 
it is not. On the other hand, the 
stimulus of ambition and a good job is 
not strong enough to guarantee the 
democratization of higher education in 
a number of industrialized countries, 
nor even to ensure regular school 
attendance in the developing countries. 
We then have the paradoxical situa- 
tion that in some regions where only 
half the children can get to school, 
half of that half fail to settle down and 
drop out even in the first cycle. 
T. employment motiva- 
tion, .on the other hand, cannot secure 
real democratization and also has the 
serious drawback of giving credence 
to the idea that a diploma entitles its 
holder to a job of equivalent level. 
Graduates who cannot find jobs 
corresponding to their qualifications 
feel that they have been cheated and 
prefer to remain unemployed rather 
than demean themselves by doing a 
lower-grade job, for which they have 
anyway not in fact been trained. 
Modern democratic education requi- 
res the revival of man's natural drive 
towards knowledge and the simulta- 
neous dismantling of the diploma-em- 
ployment mechanism which in many 
cases (even in developed countries) is 
not viable economically. 
Some educationists advocate far 
more radical action, often based on 
the same principles. 
Because the educational system is 
often obsolete and hidebound, they 
propose it should not be reformed but 
abolished. Because the school should 
be in closer touch with everyday life, 
some think it should simply be done 
away with. Such views are usually 
presented as progressive and even 
revolutionary, but if they were in fact 
generally adopted, their effects would 
be far more retrograde. 
The scientific and technical revolu- 
tion, with its mass media delivering an 
endless flow of information, and many 
other economic and social factors 
have greatly modified traditional sys- 
tems of education, revealing the weak- 
ness of some forms of instruction and 
the strength of others, broadening the 
scope of self-learning activities and 
enhancing the value of active and 
conscious attitudes in the acquisition 
of knowledge. Teaching methods bas- 
ed on reflection are acquiring increas- 
ing prestige. 
The problems involved in teaching 
and educating students of all ages, 
including adults, lead to many forms of 
out-of-school learning. Such education 
offers a wide range of possibilities 
which must be used productively in all 
countries, Scorn for out-of-school 
education is a relic of the past and no 
progressive teacher can hold such a 
view, 
Yet both now and in the future the 
school—defined as any agency dis- 
pensing systematic education to the 
rising generation—is the decisive fac- 
tor in training men fitted to contribute 
to the development of society and play 
an active part in life. 
The Commission's attitude differs 
both from the limited approach of 
those still hypnotized by existing struc- 
tures and from the ideas of those who 
dream of breaking them down and 
rushing out into the unknown, with no 
thought for the constraints of reality 
and feasibility. 
The Commission therefore stressed 
two fundamental concepts: lifelong 
education and the educational com- 
munity. If learning is the affair of a 
lifetime and of a whole society, then it 
is necessary to look beyond the 
reform of “educational systems” and 
think of an educational community. 
That is the real educational challenge 
of tomorrow, 
The “age of change” provides us 
with the necessary instruments for 
meeting the quantitative and qualitative 
demand for education which it pro- 
vokes. But we must know how to 
recognize and adapt such instruments 
for this purpose. 
The two major innovations of the 
technological age—mass media and 
cybernetics—both relate to information 
and are therefore naturally suitable for 
applying to learning and education. 
Yet little use is made of program- 
med instruction, radio, television, and 
especially computers in education, 
When they are used, radio and tele- 
vision are external and parallel to 
formal education. 
All countries, whatever their level of 
development, must adopt the large- 
scale use of educational technology 
and technological principles, or in 
other words, post-machinist intellectual 
technologies. 
What is a very valuable facility to 
the developed countries appears to 
the developing countries as the pre- 
requisite for tackling the general prob- 
lem. For most of them educational 
innovation offers the only hope of find- 
ing a satisfactory solution in a reason- 
able time. 
Present procedures do not offer any 
solution for illiteracy affecting a large 
fraction of the population (despite the 
undoubted progress of functional liter- 
acy) nor in many cases for securing 
the generalization and profitability of 
school attendance, nor for promoting 
adult education and the gradual imple- 
mentation of the concept of lifelong 
education, 
The outlook is quite different if it 
is decided to introduce the full-scale 
use of educational technologies and 
especially the dual method of pro- 
grammed instruction and radio-televi- 
sion programmes. 
I we agree that the time 
is ripe for educational reform, that 
education is today facing a critical 
challenge, that we must all join to- 
gether in rethinking it in its entirety, 
then international co-operation and 
world solidarity are clearly more 
necessary than ever before. 
The research organizations that will 
have to be set up or extended to 
develop forms of technological aid to 
education can. benefit all countries. 
The need for innovation is felt today 
in many developed countries and their 
problems are no different in essence 
from those of the developing countries 
they are trying to help. 
The Commission found that present 
forms of bilateral and multilateral aid, 
the resources available and the basic 
conceptions are not commensurate 
with the educational requirements of 
the world community. And the dispar- 
ity is even greater if renewal becomes 
the top priority in educational activity. 
Ways of broadening and strengthen- 
ing solidarity must be found. We are 
convinced that they can be found 
through the action and ingenuity of 
countries, peoples, educators, resear- 
chers, and international organiza- 
tions, especially Unesco, which has 
a leading role to play in this field. HW

ANATOMY 
OF 
  
A WORLD CRISIS 
SS. the end of the 
Second World War, education has 
become the world's major activity in 
terms of total spending. In terms of 
expenditure from public funds, it 
comes second only to military bud- 
gets. The tasks it is being asked to 
carry out are increasingly complex 
and vast, beyond comparison with 
anything required of it in the past. 
It is vital to every aspect of human 
progress and development, and its 
place in national and international 
policy-making grows steadily. 
MW For the first time in history, 
educational development on a glo- 
bal scale tends to precede econo- 
mic development. 
MW For the first time in history, 
education is preparing men and 
women for radically new types of 
societies. 
WM For the first time in history, 
some societies have begun to 
reject many of “finished products” 
of formal education. 
This new social, economic and 
psychological situation is caused by 
the speed-up in structural change and 
development, which tends to accentu- 
ate the gap that normally exists 
between structures, infrastructures and 
superstructures. It shows how easily 
educational systems can develop a 
time-lag or become maladjusted. 
A system designed for a minority, in 
the days when knowledge changed 
slowly and a person could hope to 
learn all he would need for his intellec- 
tual and professional life in a few 
years, quickly becomes out of date 
when it is extended to mass education, 
and when the volume of knowledge 
increases at an ever faster pace 
during a period of change and 
upheaval. 
Unequal growth, disparities in social 
and economic development, diam- 
etrically opposing trends: all these 
conflicts have a strong impact on 
educational systems, which find it 
difficult to keep up with the demands 
of an expanding society. 
Those they train, too, find it difficult 
to adapt to change; and some socie- 
ties now categorically reject the qua- 
lifications and skills being offered 
when these no longer correspond to 
immediate requirements. This is 
because unequal growth and “stop- 
and-go” development can only create 
equilibrium in one sphere by upsetting 
it in another. Even so, the process 
is not a wholly negative one, in spite 
of the different re-adjustments it 
demands, and the “growing pains” 
which the educational world is under- 
going today. 
One other factor should be stressed. 
Educational structures have a number 
of common traits and trends. These 
are far from evident to the same 
degree everywhere, but significantly 
the same ones appear in various 
guises in all parts of the world. Des- 
pite the many cultural, historical, 
economic and ideological differences 
existing among countries, or even 
within a single country, education in 
this respect, has a global character. 
This is shown in a number of 
important ways. The first is the 
choice of educational models. When 
it comes to choosing between two 
basic options—highly selective or 
open admission—it is the latter that 
is most often adopted. Many of the 
problems industrially developed coun- 
tries are grappling with at present are 
the result of a changeover from their 
former highly-selective systems to a 
more open structure, 
Most developing nations opted for 
open admission at first, but lack of 
resources and the demands of eco- 
nomic development have often obliged 
them to resort in practice to varying 
degrees of selection. Seeking to 
avoid both vocational control based 
on a planned economy and laissez- 
faire anarchy, they try to find solu- 
tions that reconcile respect for the 
individual with the needs of society. 
Then there is the adoption of so- 
called technocratic systems designed 
to train workers and qualified pro- 
fessionals and to promote science and 
technology. 
A more recent trend in educational 
policies stems from the desire to 
provide an outlet for the upsurge of 
freedom-seeking aspirations from the 
broad mass of society. This ten- 
dency Is increasing where economic

THE EGG AND l...Q 
Current biochemical research on the brain suggests that 
it has a largely unused potential (as high as 90 per cent 
according to some authorities) and that under favourable 
conditions its creative capacity could be tremendously 
increased. Other studies, on mental mechanisms and the 
learning process, have revealed the serious effects of 
malnutrition on brain development. Under-nourishment in 
the mother can make the new-born baby’s nervous system 
more fragile; malnutrition between the 5th and 10th month 
following birth may reduce the number of cells in the brain, 
which has virtually finished growing by the end of the 
second year. The role of RNA (a genetic substance 
controlling protein synthesis) in memory and consequently 
in the learning process has also been closely studied, 
revealing a link between protein-calorie malnutrition In 
infancy and early childhood and impaired learning and 
mental retardation in later life. “If such damage has been 
done”, says a U.N. report on the subject, “the consumption 
of extra protein in adult life will not repair it, and if such 
damage is widespread in a country, it will be likely to impede 
that country’s future development in almost every respect.” 
Protein malnutrition is also a major cause of death among 
infants and young children. A country’s efforts to improve 
nutrition during the pre-school period, especially up to the 
age of four, would improve the performance of its educatio- 
nal system. LQ. in fact, gets its real start “in the egg”.

### 52716: Anatomy of a world crisis

ANATOMY OF A CRISIS (Continued from page 10} 
The growing emphasis on self-education 
and social development calls for the 
active participation of the whole 
population, 
The transfer of responsibility for 
education is also being accelerated. 
Until the end of the 19th century, it 
was provided mainly by the family 
and by religious institutions, grant 
schools, apprenticeship guilds and 
independent higher-educational estab- 
lishments, whereas today, in most 
countries, the responsibility is that of 
public authorities or the State. 
There are three main reasons for 
this. First, a general tendency to 
rely on public bodies to satisfy social 
needs. Second, the belief in nearly 
all countries that although the State 
may allow and in some cases even 
encourage private initiative, it alone 
is in a position to assume responsi- 
bility for overall educational policy. 
Third, the determination of many 
governments to keep control of edu- 
cation because of its ever-increasing 
political role, 
A regards the structure of 
educational systems, several trends 
are emerging. 
ation, which still remains limited, is 
generally an integral part of the school 
system. Primary education is widening 
in scope and children begin school at 
an earlier age. The number of years 
spent at school is increasing too, and 
reforms often lead to a link-up bet- 
ween primary schooling and the first 
years of secondary education. The 
number of children at school is grow- 
ing, and not only at the lowest levels: 
enrolment in the higher classes shows 
a marked increase. 
However, as the school population 
increases, there are more drop-outs 
and more repeaters. In general in- 
take occurs at the lowest level of the 
system and outflow either halfway up 
(mainly because of failures) or else at 
the top, after successful completion of 
studies. Admissions and departures 
or changeovers in mid-programme are 
still rare, but are beginning to be 
accepted. The validity of strictly sel- 
ective systems Is questioned be- 
cause of their obligation to do more 
to overcome the handicaps suffered 
by the most underprivileged social 
groups. 
In spite of stubborn opposition, 
school curricula are beginning to be 
made less burdensome. Previous 
inequalities in elementary school pro- 
Kindergarten educ- 
grammes—often the result of social 
discrimination—are rapidly disappear- 
ing. Instruction is increasingly given 
in the mother tongue (1). 
There is also a general tendency to 
raise the age at which specialization 
is required; but this does not prevent 
technical and professional education 
being increasingly diversified to fit 
the growing variety of productive roles. 
Cross-links are multiplying between 
general and technical education, wide- 
ranging cultural courses and specialist 
training, the humanities and science 
and technology. 
plays an increasing role in general 
education), 
In higher education, traditional uni- 
versities are breaking up inte smaller 
units, and post-secondary education 
as a whole is being widely diversified. 
On the one hand, paradoxically, var- 
ious disciplines and facilities are being 
grouped in single large establishments 
or put under a centralized administra- 
tion (“multi-universities”); while on the 
other, smaller, more flexible institu- 
tions are being created to cater locally 
for the special needs of certain cate- 
gories of students. 
Higher education also tends more 
and more to be spread over a number 
of different levels. Many new sub- 
jects of study are being introduced, 
and interdisciplinary instruction is dev- 
eloping, as well as closer and closer 
links with scientific research. 
The whole scope of higher educa- 
tion is indeed being widened to meet 
the new requirements of a larger stu- 
dent body, to satisfy the need for 
expanded research facilities and com- 
munity projects, and to respond to the 
demands of those who want the uni- 
versity to act as a catalyst for social 
reform, 
New kinds of structures, new types 
of students and new curricula entail in 
turn a thorough revision of selection 
and evaluation procedures. Student 
participation in the management of 
educational institutions and the choice 
of teaching programmes is growing. 
All over the world, teachers now 
constitute a major social and profes- 
sional group; in many developing 
countries they form the largest group 
of salary-earners. 
To all this should be added a grow- 
ing tendency to extend the non-school 
sector of education. Adult literacy 
(1) In the Soviet Union, sixty-six languages 
are used. 
(Technology now 
campaigns are making headway, and 
the distinction between formal elemen- 
tary education and literacy program- 
mes is beginning to disappear. 
Schools and universities are supplem- 
ented and sometimes replaced by a 
multitude of extra-mural or semi-aca- 
demic activies, which call for the use 
of methods long neglected by tradi- 
tional education or only recently intro- 
duced. These developments are of 
two different kinds. 
First, there are those that take place 
within the professional context. A 
whole range of programmes provide 
civic and vocational training; schools 
and other educational establishments 
offer advanced courses, retraining or 
special * coaching; and universities 
admit adults without any formal en- 
trance examinations. 
Secondly, there are the develop- 
ments belonging to the general cultu- 
ral context. These have freer and 
more flexible structures. People are 
encouraged to teach themselves, with 
the help of information material and 
data sources; leisure activities and 
social and community projects aim at 
promoting participation and helping 
people to teach one another. 
Increasing stress is also being laid 
on the link between educational dev- 
elopment and the many other aspects 
of social and economic development. 
M.- of the innovations 
mentioned above may take various 
forms. What counts is that even where 
these common trends have not yet 
emerged, contrary currents are rarely 
found, and there is little indication that 
such innovations are likely to be 
reversed in the future. 
This does not mean that highly di- 
vergent and even contradictory trends 
do not exist on other levels. For ins- 
tance, the movement in some countries 
is towards centralization, State control 
and overall standardization (2). In 
other countries, the trend moves to- 
wards decentralization, loosening of 
State control and greater variety. 
The fact remains, though, that many 
developments show a general consis- 
(2) in the Soviet Union, for example, where 
the basic principles of the educational sys- 
tem have been summed up by Prof. A. V. Pe- 
trovsky, a Soviet member of the Commission, 
as: “State control and centralized man- 
agement of public education; universal and 
compulsory schooling, free and open at all 
levels; unity and sequence in all types of 
education.”

BRITAIN'S ‘OPEN UNIVERSITY’ 
Founded in 1969, “to provide education of university and professional standards , . . and 
to promote the educational well-being of the community”, Britain's “Open University” 
became fully operational in January 1971. Today, with a student body approaching 40,000 
it has become the largest university in Britain. No formal educational attainments are ° 
required for admission, the only restrictions being that students must be over 21 and 
resident in the United Kingdom. Students are expected to study for a minimum of 
10 hours a week, 36 weeks a year. Degrees are awarded to students gaining six “credits”; 
one credit is granted for each study course completed. Instruction is given through a 
combination of radio and television lectures, correspondence courses and direct counselling 
by tutors at the 300 Study Centres scattered throughout Britain. Every week students 
complete their assignments and send their work back to the University where it is marked 
by computer. Each student following a foundation (Ist levei) course must spend one week 
at a residential summer school. Left, aerial view of the Open University’s headquarters

CAUTION! CHILDREN AT WORK 
By the year 2000, the number of young people of school and university age 
will have grown by more than 1,000 million—an average annual increase of 
36 million potential pupils and students. From 1960 to 1968, during the first 
United Nations Development Decade, the world’s total school-age population 
(children from 5 to 19 years) increased from 995 million to about 1,150 million, 
or by 20 per cent. During the same period, world population increased 17 per 
cent, from 3,000 million to almost 3,500 million. In other words, the “population 
explosion” contains within it an even more remarkable “pupil explosion”. Today's 
rapidly growing demand for learning throughout the world calls for radical economic, 
social and educational innovations.

tency which is all the more remark- 
able in that the various situations 
have evolved under the influence of 
very different theories, challenges and 
protest movements. These fall into 
four major groups. 
1. Educational Reforms 
The first trend consists in reforming 
or reorganizing existing educational 
structures and modernizing - teaching 
methods. With or without attendant 
structural changes on the social or 
economic level, reforms of this kind 
are in course nearly everywhere, 
Steps taken by public authorities, as 
well as by scientific bodies and indi- 
vidual educators, have prepared the 
way for major innovations in a num- 
ber of countries (1). 
Important changes have also taken 
place in developing countries (2), 
largely instigated by central govern- 
ments, although lack of means and 
bureaucratic inertia sometimes put a 
brake on innovation, as those in charge 
(1) In the United States and Canada many 
important and meaningful reforms have been 
initiated, particularly in modernization of 
programmes and the use of teaching machi- 
nes. In the Fed. Rep. of Germany, current 
reforms alm at the democratization of 
education and the ovetall development of 
secondary education. Reforms are also being 
planned or catried out in Sweden, Finland, 
Japan, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, 
. the Netherlands (higher education) and Cze- 
16

periments undertaken elsewhere can

sources, the extent and gravity of cer- 
tain problems and the failure to cope 
with them provide strong arguments 
for those who insist that fragmentary 
measures are Ineffective and who 
therefore advocate total reform, 
2. Structural transformations 
In countries which have gone 
through social and political upheavals 
in recent years, events have often led 
to profound structural changes in the 
educational world, affecting student 
entries, access to education at various 
levels, curricula reform and—to a les- 
ser extent—the modernization of 
teaching methods. 
The establishment of closer ties 
between schools and the local popula- 
tion is a top priority in countries which 
see education as a vast mass move- 
ment, where all those who have re- 
ceived training have a civic duty to 
teach those who have not had the 
same opportunities (3). Similar con- 
cerns are to be found in countries try- 
ing to reduce the domination of the 
State and socialize education by mak- 
ing it the direct and active respon- 
sibility of those involved (4). 
(3) Two examples are Cuba, with its literacy 
campaign, and the Democratic Republic of 
Viet-Nam, with its people's education pro- 
Jects. 
(4) As In Yugoslavia, where schools are run 
by councils composed of representatives of 
teachers, pupils, parents and the local com- 
munity, etc. 
3. Radical Criticism 
The third trend is marked by those 
who are in favour of “de-institution- 
alizing” education and “de-schooling” 
society, Their theories have not yet 
been tried out in practice (5). 
Frank criticism _or outright condem- 
nation of “institutionalized® educa- 
tion may lead either to intermediary for- 
mulas or else to radical plans for the 
total "de-schooling” of society. These 
extremist theories are based on the 
idea that education, being an indepen- 
dent variable in each society, is a 
direct cause of social conflict. 
The school's position in society and 
the power relationships to which it is 
subject make it incapable of being the 
instrument of a true education in the 
service of men. On the contrary, it 
serves the purposes of repressive, 
alienating and dehumanizing societies. 
So according to Illich, institutions 
should be “inverted” and schools abo- 
lished, so that men may become free 
agents again in a society unencum- 
bered by formal schooling, where they 
can regain control of the institutions 
and thereby recover the initiative for 
their own education, 
Even the most ardent partisans of 
these ideas, however, recognize that 
while young people can develop their 
(5) The best known proponent of these 
ideas, Ivan Illich, and other of their advo- 
cates meet at the Inter-Cultural Documenta- 
tion Centre at Cuernavaca, in Mexico. Their 
theories, which have often been taken up 
elsewhere, draw a clear distinction between 
the development of the learning potential, 
which they recognize, and the Institutionall- 
zation of teaching, which they oppose.

characters and acquire knowledge and 
understanding by participation in com- 
munity life and from practical exper- 
lence, some form of schooling is still 
necessary for certain kinds of learn- 
ing. 
In any case, these novel theories, 
which closely reflect other movements 
among young intellectuals, are chal- 
lenging both for the controversies and 
new ideas they stimulate and for the 
lively way in which they pose the 
basic problem of the true purpose of 
education. They help to highlight pos- 
sible openings or solutions from which 
other systems, however different, may 
well draw inspiration. 
4. Dissent 
A fourth trend, swelled by the dis- 
satisfactions of the users themselves, 
has developed in certain countries , 
where education is of increasing con- 
cern to politicians, educationists, res- 
earch workers and scholars, as well 
as to the students themselves and the 
general public. 
Analysis of the reactions of work- 
ing-class people confronted with the 
rigidity of traditional educational sys- 
tems is very instructive in this con- 
nexion. Where the school system re- 
mains the exclusive preserve of an in- 
tellectual elite springing from the 
middle class which created the sys- 
tem and which continues to impose its 
own laws and moral values, students 
are often disconcerted by the divorce 
between the outmoded education they 
receive and the reality of the world 
around them. They become frustrat- 
ed, waste their energies, grow bored, 
hr WA ES rg hE Ab i 
or find some other outlet for their 
hopes and aspirations. 
Student unrest made its mark on 
history when widespread criticism be- 
gan to undermine the hitherto impreg- 
nable fortress of education. Despite 
its sometimes confused or naive char- 
acter and its two-edged radicalism, 
it opened a breach in the defences. 
Admittedly, however, apathy among 
the student population constitutes, in 
its own way, 
sent. The disaffection or lack of 
enthusiasm found among students in 
many countries are undoubted signs 
that antiquated educational systems 
are being rejected. 
Yet interest in education has never 
been greater. It increasingly becomes 
the cause of conflict between parties, 
between generations, and between so- 
cial groups of every kind, which often 
amounts to political or ideological 
strife. In fact it has become one of the 
dominant themes of both empirical and 
ideological social criticism. 
It is easy to see why public figures 
are taken aback when their authority is 
challenged—not courteously, by a few 
informed critics, as in the past, but 
massively, by angry criticism of stu- 
dents and even by open revolt. The 
reserve and suspicion with which many 
of the more revolutionary conclusions 
of present day research are greeted 
are also understandable. 
We believe, however, that all these 
forms of dissent, whether tacit or ex- 
plicit, peaceful or violent, reformist or 
radical, deserve for varying reasons 
to be taken into account when edu- 
cational policies and strategies are 
aly 
another form of dis-: 
being mapped out for the coming years 
or coming decades. 
But how can we identify the true 
characteristics of the present day 
world among this constellation of con- 
verging or divergent trends and 
methods, these teeming ideas and gen- 
erous intentions? 
For more than twenty years, atten- 
tion has remained focused on a few 
major questions: the quantitative ex- 
tension and democratization of educa- 
tion, the diversification of structures, 
and the modernization of curricula and 
methods. 
A few years ago a new analytical 
attitude to the basic problems began 
to take shape, which came down in 
the end to three essential questions. 
Are school systems capable of meet- 
ing the world-wide demand for educa- 
tion? ls it possible to provide them 
with the vast resources they need? In 
short, is it possible to continue dev- 
eloping education along current lines 
and at the current rate 7 
To these very pertinent questions 
others of a very different order must 
be added today, so as to bring out the 
full dimensions of .the problem as it 
affects the future development of 
mankind and conditions the full reali- 
zation of the human potential. 
Given the present state of affairs, 
we can and must inquire into the true 
meaning of education in the modern 
world, not only reassessing its respon- 
sibilities to the present generations 
which must be prepared for tomorrow's 
world, but also analyzing its underly- 
ing powers and myths, its prospects 
and its fundamental aims or ends. W

for a global 
strategy

The concept of lifelong education 
could be applied in as many different 
ways as there are countries in the ’ 
world. For all countries this question 
is the crucial issue of our time. 
Educational reforms recently pro- 
posed in Peru, for instance, call for 
a complete restructuring of education, 
in and out of school, based on the

Today's tremendous demand for 
education and the demands of tomor- 
row will not be met by present types 
of educational systems. Rigid internal 
structures need to be broken down 
and education offering a far more 
varied choice should be made widely 
accessible. 
In Canada, the Educational Planning 
Commission in Alberta Province has 
recommended that educational reforms 
be centered on the idea of lifelong

far beyond a reform of teaching, the 
proposals are directly geared to radi-

With too many pupils and a shortage of

of Parkway, a broad avenue in the heart

“Family hostels”, found mainly in 
France and ltaly, in rural areas with

schools which offer a secondary 
education running parallel "with pro-

ART FROM THE SOUND

“Education”, says the report of the International Com- 
mission on the Development of Education, “has the 
power to cultivate or stifle creativity.” Regrettably, the 
latter tendency has generally prevailed, turning edu- 
cation into a purely mechanical process for the trans- 
mission of knowledge and skills, often of doubtful utility, 
with scant regard paid to the development of the pupil's 
personality as a whole, Today the situation is beginning 
to change. In the teaching of science, and even more 
in the teaching of art “the individual's imaginative faculty 
must be developed.” This is what the young Spanish 
artist and teacher, Ramon Sancho-Mifano, is attempting 
to do. In his art class at the High School of Lugones, 
near Oviedo, he has broken with the traditional method 
which prescribes mechanical copying. He asks his 
pupils to draw directly upon their powers of imagination. 
His method, which has been studied by Unesco experts, 
is to make his pupils listen to a piece of classical music 
after which, with no further guidance, they draw images 
and impressions evoked by the music. In this way 
Sancho-Mifiano attempts to develop the imaginative 
sense of his pupils and create in their minds “a veritable 
integration of the two art forms." Their drawings, some 
examples of which are reproduced here, often surprise 
by their quality, considering that they are the work of 
culturally underprivileged children of 10 to 12, whose 
first experience of art is acquired in these classes. 
“Air on the G string” by Johann 
Sebastian Bach, as interpreted

follows the style of modem

allusive power,

Development of adult education, in and out of school, should 
be a priority objective of educational Strategies during the next 
Ann ten Years. 
Adult education can have a direct 
bearing on the progress of children 
in school, since primary education 
and the educational level of parents 
cannot be disassociated. Children 
cannot be properly educated in an 
illiterate environment. Thus, 
education can no longer be a fringe 
activity in any society. It should be 
given its proper place in educational 
policies and budgets, and firm links 
established between school and out- 
of-school education, 
adult . 
Step-by-step progress in adult 
education is not sufficient to meet the 
present situation which calls for a 
giant leap forward. This can only be 
achieved by mobilizing the efforts and 
resources of individuals and of public 
bodies. 
Yugoslavia’s “workers universities” 
provide both formal and out-of-school 
education and are open to all adults 
whatever their earlier training, the 
only criteria for admission being indi- 
 
vidual aptitude. Courses are offered 
at all levels, ranging from elementary 
education to instruction in specialized 
subjects for highly qualified workers. 
Programmes . are adapted to local 
conditions and are diversified accord- 
ing to community and individual needs. 
Equal importance is attached to func- 
tional education (for professional, 
civic or social progress) as to a 
person's general and cultural develop- 
ment.

New paths taken by education and 
an expansion of educational facilities 
have helped to promote the principle 
and practice of self-learning. Everyone 
ought to be provided with the means, 
tools and incentives for making self- 
learning a productive and rewarding 
activity. 
Self-education, which has been far 
too often neglected as an objective, 
,should have its place in the educa- 
tional strategies of every country. 
Even countries with limited resources, 
should allocate part of the educational 
budget to the development of self- 
learning among priority groups of the 
population, 
An Inquiry into self-education was 
made in Canada by Prof. Allen Tough 
and associates at the Ontario Institute 
for Studies in Education. Carried out 
among several hundred teenagers 
\ a —u 
and adults engaged in self-learning 
projects, it revealed the broad scope 
and possibilities of self-directed learn- 
ing in many fields. It also showed 
that learners sought the help of a 
wide range of persons, other than 
teachers and librarians—an indication 
that many non-specialists qualify as 
“teachers” in individualized learning. 
Rapid, cheap and easily available 
means such as radio should be more 
widely used for mass education, parti- 
cularly in rural areas. Where resour- 
ces allow, modern communication 
media would be effective as teaching 
aids in many branches of education— 
higher technical education, for exam- 
ple. 
A striking example of education via 
the mass media is the Tevec project 
in Quebec (Canada) designed to bring 
adults who have not completed nine 
ws a RL 
years of schooling up to that level. 
The programme comprises “scholas- 
tic® subjects (French, English mathe- 
matics, etc.), and a theme chosen from 
a variety of topics (health, the law, 
community participation, social welfare, 
government) aimed at fostering an un- 
derstanding of daily life in a rapidiy 
developing society and stimulating 
citizen participation. 
Methods used in the project have 
included: 90-minute television pro- 
grammes, five days a week; corres- 
pondence courses (averaging 15,000 
reply cards daily); personal contact 
between participants and teachers 
(regular visits to homes every three 
weeks) and weekly tele-club meetings 
to discuss the topic presented. Sampl- 
ing surveys show that 35,000 persons 
viewed the programmes regularly, and 
110,000 saw them more than once a 
week,

In the U.S.S.R., from five to eight 
hours of special TV programmes for 
teachers and children are broadcast 
daily. The teachers’ programmes bring 
to the TV screen educators, psycho- 
logists and other specialists in educat- 
jon. Children’s broadcasts aim to

Thus far, school systems have gen- 
erally been unable to make system- 
atic use of new possibilities offered 
by technological and scientific pro- 
gress. 
Mass communication technology is 
currently developing in two opposite 
directions: towards individualization of 
education (as in programmed learning) 
and towards mass distribution (as in 
educational TV programmes by satellite 
transmission). 
One new technique is the use of 
direct-wire television which makes it 
possible to relay more than twenty 
programmes simultaneously to the 
entire subscriber network, or to serve 
one subscriber with a single pro- 
gramme selected from a range of 
several dozen. 
Mass transmission techniques capa- 
ble of making education available to 
millions of children and adults include 
two of great importance for developing 
countries: radio and communications 
satellite relays. 
Radio is the only advanced com- 
munication technique which has found 
its proper place in developing coun-

is made of this virtually universal 
means of communication.

participate in Intelsat, which recently 
orbited the first of the Intelsat IV

For the moment, however, national 
spatial telecommunications systems 
are of interest only to regions with 
a common language, to very large 
countries such as India, Brazil and

Satellite-relayed broadcasting will 
therefore have to be handled on a 
multi-national scale, on the lines of 
the Latin American cultural integration 
scheme (SERLA) or the Franco-Ger-

Africa south of the Sahara, for 
example.

the United Kingdom, almost all

Federal Republic of Germany have 
also acquired computers. 
In the school itself architecture is 
bringing changes. The classroom is 
no longer necessarily a “compartment”

schools have novel and original inter-

expenditure on teaching staff produces 
an equivalent Improvement in results. 
Hitherto, the continual rise in expen- 
diture on teachers’ salaries has been 
achieved at the expense of spending 
‘on new equipment, innovation and 
research. Teaching methods must 
therefore be found which are as “pro- 
fitable® as possible, or running 
expenses will reach.such a high level 
that the cost factor will put modern- 
ization of educational systems out of 
reach. 
National authorities will have to 
consider setting aside a fixed propor- 
tion of the annual increase in the 
educational budget to developing new 
ways of making the educational system 
more efficient. 
The radical changes that can be 
made in education by large scale in- 
troduction of new techniques are being 
demonstrated in the Ivory Coast. This 
country's programme of education via 
television aims to bring basic educat- 
ion to all school-age children and to 
use TV on a nation-wide scale in 
promoting cultural and political unity. 
By 1980, about 16,500 classes will 
be equipped with television receivers 
making televised education available 
to first-level classes and to young 
people aged betwen 13 and 17, and 
providing cultural, lifelong education 
and information services to all adults. 
By 1986 all children will be receiving 
televised education. 
The World Bank estimates that the 
Ivory’s Coast's project will cost 44 per 
cent less than the maintenance of the 
traditional educational system. 
The new project is based on a broad 
research programme covering teach- 
ing methods and curricula, modification 
of school buildings and teacher train- 
ing. It has led to a new intensive 
teacher training programme compris- 
ing not only an introduction of new 
subject matter, but also training in the 
use of audio-visual techniques, com- 
munication, psychology, after-school 
activities and new evaluation techni- 
ques. 
The organization of classes and the 
order in which courses are arranged 
have also had to be altered, and these 
modifications will eventually be carried 
over into secondary education. 
The repercussions of the Ivory Coast 
programme are also being felt outside 
classrooms and teacher training coll- 
eges. Out-of-school education will be 
widely influenced by the introduction 
of television and the ministries res- 
ponsible for these activities are having 
to modify their own procedures to 
meet the needs of this exciting new 
venture,

iL vy 4 All hierarchical differen ces among teachers in primary schools, 
technical colleges, secondary schools and universities should 
  
be abolished. 
Teaching is everywhere identical in 
nature, value and purpose. A teacher 
should specialize according to his 
preference for teaching children, teen- 
agers or adults and his wish to live 
in the country, in a town or in a big 
city. The idea of promotion, with its 
financial and other advantages, should 
not draw him inexorably towards the 
biggest city or the largest school or 
towards the top level of higher edu- 
cation. 
In some countries, differing levels 
of training and pay for primary and 
secondary teachers have already been 
abolished. Czechoslovakia, Denmark, 
UK. and U.S.A, among other coun- 
tries, now train primary and secondary 
teachers in universities or equivalent 
post-secondary institutions. 
Others, including France, Poland, 
and the U.S.S.R. are now following 
the same path by training teachers to 
university level.

Present day divisions between for-

becoming blurred. Teachers who are 
trained today will still be teaching 
after the year 2000. Teacher training 
strategies should be drawn up with 
these factors in mind. Programmes 
for training tomorrow's teachers 
should follow two main lines:speciali- 
zation (in pre-school education, school 
pedagogy, technical education, back- 
ward child training, adult education, 
etc.) and the training of most teachers 
as organizer-educators, capable of

out of school.

require specialists in teaching mat- 
erials, self-teaching equipment and the 
use of educational techniques, audio- 
visual auxiliaries, etc, as well as 
community centre leaders, psycholo- 
gists, administrators with new skills, 
systems analysts, etc. 
Teacher training institutes recently 
set up with Unesco’s aid in six African 
countries (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ivory 
Coast, Liberia, Niger, Togo) aim not 
only to train teachers for specific 
classes or subjects but to form rural 
educators equipped to work under 
local conditions and capable of initiat- 
nity aides, persons with special skills: 
handicraft workers, opticians, photo- 
graphers, stamp collectors, politicians, 
salesmen, insurance experts, police- 
men, chefs, dairy farmers, members of 
minority groups—the possibilities are 
endless. 
Volunteer student aides also have 
an important part to play. It is widely 
accepted that helping someone to 
learn can also be a significant learning 
experience for the person teaching. 
On this assumption, many schools 
provide opportunities for pupils to 
teach other pupils. 
The usual method adopted is for

room of a younger one to read to him

institutes have two main objectives:

personnel—primary schoo! inspec- 
tors, education advisers, high school 
teachers, headmasters and primary 
teachers—to bring them up to date 
with reforms in education, and to train 
them in new methods and techniques.

### 52717: A 21-point programme for a global strategy in education

21 POINTS (Continued) 
Wa ~ R ROE r p Sota 4B TE ARERR Ei CE, pt A VERT NEN Hl SR A A PR Tl EE rr  H—— 
Contrary to traditional practice, teaching should adapt itself to 
the learner. The student should have greater freedom to 
decide for himself what he wants to learn and how and where v
e
y
 
na
 
to learn it. 
LE, 
Children should be encouraged from 
an early age to share in the organiza- 
tion of school life. In particular, they 
should be able to discuss their rights 
and duties, as laid down by school 
rules—rules that should gradually be 
made more flexible. 
The same reasoning applies to 
teaching methods and subjects. The 
learner, particularly the adult learner, 
should be free to choose which school 
or institution to attend and the kind of 
training he wants. He should be able 
to enter the educational system at the 
level which suits him best and select 
optional additional subjects which 
interest him. 
All or most compulsory disciplines 
in schools are, however, laid down in 
terms of objectives the establishments 
has set for itself. But this in no way 
prevents possibilities for individual 
choice being extended. 
Many examples exist of institutions 
that encourage learners to take res- 
ponsibility for their own education. 
The Gesamtschulen, in the Federal 
Republic of Germany, seek to stim- 
ulate students’ capacity for choosing 
their own paths and aim to bring their

working methods close both to uni- 
versity studies and modern professio- 
nal training. Students do not decide 
on the kind of diploma they want to 
acquire immediately on entering 
school. 
Studies are divided into three cate- 
gories: Studienfacher, or major choice 
subjects; Orientierungsfacher, or com- 
plementary subjects; Grundfacher, or 
basic subjects. The first and second 
categories form the core of knowledge 
regarded as necessary for the pupil's 
adaptation to society, but are, how- 
ever, subject to choice. Only the third 
category is compulsory for all and 
comprises civic and social training, the 
visual arts or music, physical training 
and religion. But a certain freedom 
is allowed as to the amount of time 
the pupil devotes to each subject. 
In England, the Prior Weston primary 
school, London, is an outstanding 
example of the increased réle of the 
learner and of recent widespread 
changes in primary education in the 
United Kingdom. Learning takes place 
within a classless environment with 
the different age groups working to- 
gether on various learning activities. 
CC 5 4 gt A IE SE RR 1 sess EE 
Students and the public as a whole should be given a greater 
© / say in decisions affecting education. 
Student participation in the planning 
and running of education is progress- 
ing. Such participation increases with 
the age of the student, and varies in 
different branches of education. Stu- 
dents responsibilities are greatest 
where their social, cultural and mater- 
ial interests are concerned. In the 
case of programmes and teaching 
“methods, student responsibilities are 
still limited, and, in most cases, 
even more restricted in financing or 
teacher recruitment. Student partici- 
pation should, in fact, be exercised 
separately from, as well as in conjunc- 
tion with, that of teachers, parents and 
others. 
Some forms of participation (inspec- 
tion, co-management, self-manage- 
ment, etc.) are now common in certain 
primary and community schools, in 
secondary and technical schools, in 
some adult education institutions, and 
in organizations outside the school 
system, handling such problems as 
educational programmes, research, 
teacher promotion, salaries, educa- 
tional investment, etc. 
The most significant developments 
today are going on in universities in 
various parts of the world. Students 
have for some time been given partial 
or complete control over the “social” 
sector:student hostels, sports, sanitary 
and auxiliary services. They have also 
been “consulted” on general policies 
or have made their views known 
through committees set up to propose 
reforms. 
In recent years, student representa- 
tion has spread to areas of university 
ERT eR OO yw wh i El wi 
The “open plan’ surroundings prov- 
ide activity areas for subject study, 
reading, art and other manual activities 
and play. A mixture of 5, 6 and 
17-year-old children work together on 
the same mathematics project (for 
example noting down and analysing 
the physical characteristics of the 
group) with the quicker pupils helping 
the slower ones in the same group. 
* The timetable is flexible and pupils 
may spend one or more days inves- 
tigating and describing a single theme 
or topic, only moving on to another 
activity when the project is completed. 
~The teaching of reading and writing 
is based on individual interests with 
the emphasis on creative expression 
rather than copy-book exercises. 
Self-discipline is encouraged through 
co-operative activity and pupil partici- 
pation in the organization of much of 
their work. The headmaster and 
teachers maintain regular contact with 
parents who are encouraged to share 
in the school’s activities and even act 
as ancillary aides for play supervision, 
manual training assistance, group 
reading, etc.

management previously regarded as 
the preserve of a few persons chosen 
for their particular experience or qua- 
lifications. Today, educational methods 
and study programmes are - being 
brought more and more within the 
scope of participation arrangements, 
and management bodies (faculty coun- 
cils, national and ministerial commit- 
tees) are admitting student representa- 
tives. In some countries students are 
successfully demanding representation 
on bodies which decide on admissions, 
examinations, finance and the general 
administration of education. 
Student participation is today dev- 
eloping in Asia, and student influence, 
direct (as in the Philippines, India 
and Indonesia) or indirect (as in Malay-

MAN'S ORIGINS 
DEMYSTIFIED 
  
  
Sir, 
Congratulations on your splendid 
August-September 1972 issue ("The 
Emergence of Man"). Even for the 
layman the mystery of man’s origins is 
no longer so much of an enigma thanks 
to the many fascinating and informative 
articles by leading authorities. 
| read your “sclentific” numbers with 
great interest, and generally find them 
more rewarding than those dealing with 
books or art, for instance. 
Please devote more issues to science. 
Martine Pottier 
Sceaux, France 
SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE 
 
Sir, 
Your magazine deserves the highest 
praise for its clear and down-to-earth 
presentation of scientific subjects. The 
issue on the Emergence of Man is an 
outstanding example of science popu- 
larization. } 
A reader of several years’ standing, 
| have come to admire the “Unesco 
Courier's™ consistently rational approach 
to all subjects. 
Robert Bellanger 
Montrouge, France 
NORMAN E. BORLAUG’'S 
DEFENCE OF DDT 
 
 
Sir, 
Norman Borlaug's defence of DDT 
("Unesco Courier” February 1972) is 
groundless because he ignores many 
commonly known facts. We can send 
him a list of the mutagenic, gonadotropic, 
embryotropic, cancerogenic and terato- 
genic properties of the pesticides he so 
furiously defends. 
The major argument advanced by 
Borlaug and his supporters—that the 
prohibition of the use of DDT and other 
chemicals would mean starvation for 
humanity—holds no water. Why should 
we poison all agricultural produce in 
order to save 15 to 20 per cent of the 
harvest? For this Is no ordinary 
poisoning but a threat of disastrous 
mutations leading to the deterioration 
of the health of present and future 
generations, far worse than any hunger. 
Perhaps Dr. Borlaug thinks that men 
should meekly share the fate of the 
99 per cent of animal species which, 
according to H. Spencer, have dis- 
appeared from the face of the earth. 
S. Yuzko, A. Khalitov and 
M. Nikolskaya 
Members of the Moscow Soclety 
for Nature Protection 
Sir, 
| found Norman Borlaug's article in 
defence of DDT profoundly depressing. 
The author tries to disprove the count- 
less facts that demonstrate the disast- 
rous influence of DDT on the biosphere. 
- Letters to the Editor  
If it is not his ignorance, then what 
lies behind his claims? | consider that 
the production, sale and use of DDT 
is a crime against humanity. 
| have personally witnessed many 
cases of sickness and death resulting 
from DDT polsoning—either direct or 
through food crops treated with DDT. 
It was a big mistake for the "Unesco 
Courier” to devote space to Norman 
Borlaug’s article.

DOWN-TO-EARTH 
  
UTOPIANISM 
  
Sir, 
As a student, | find your magazine a 
mine of invaluable, practical information 
that helps me in my studies and in 
improving my general culture. 
Some readers have criticized the 
“Unesco Courler® for being a platform 
for Utopian ideas, and have asked to 
be spared “from the inept ‘if onlys’ of 
Utopian dreamers.” | hope you will 
disregard such requests. If our Utopias 
disappear, if men can no longer express 
such views freely, then life will have no 
meaning or purpose in a world that 
appears to be dominated by hatred, war 
and racism. 
S. Bessicot 
Montpellier, France 
BOOK, DEAR FRIEND 
 
Sir, 
Reading your Issue “Book, DearFrlend” 
(July 1972) was indeed a rewarding 
experience. As an assistant-librarian, 
| found it a rich source of information 
and enlightenment on the book and its 
future.

BOOKS CONSIGNED 
TO THE FIRE 
Sir, 
In your issue “Book, Dear Friend” 
a photo caption (page 7) says that the 
systematic destruction of certain books 
dates back to at least 600 B.C., and 
quotes an incident described in the 
First Book of Maccabees. In fact, this 
episode occurred in 167 B.C. during 
the Maccabean revolt. 
An example actually dating from 
600 B.C. is the burning of a scroll on 
the order of Jehoiakim king of Judah, 
in 605 or 604 B.C. as recounted In 
chapter 36 of the Book of Jeremiah. 
Brother Paul-Irénée Fransen 
Maredsous Abbey, Belgium 
CULTURAL OLYMPICS 
 
Sir, 
After watching with admiration the 
wonderful spectacle of the Olympic 
Games at Munich, | reflected that man, 
capable of such prowess in sport, is too 
often Inclined to forget that the power 
of thought Is his most valuable posses- 
sion. 
Why doesn't Unesco take the ini- 
tiative of instituting Arts and Culture 
Olympics? Previously unknown artists 
and writers would be revealed to the 
world and their work evaluated by- 
recognized experts in the fields of 
muslc, literature, painting, sculpture, 
theatre, photography and amateur film- 
making. 
José Manuel Briones Gonzalez 
Madrid, Spain 
CHILEAN LANDSCAPE 
 
Sir, 
The “Unesco Courier” is a never- 
ending source of knowledge concerning 
the peoples and cultures of the world. 
| was particularly struck by the March 
1972 issue on Latin America—a theme 
long awaited by your readers. 
May | make a correction to the cap- 
tion for the photo by Mr. Roberto Mon- 
tandon, on page 13 of this Issue, which 
Is described as showing Chilean Pata- 
gonia. | understand from Mr. Montan- 
don that the photo actually shows the 
“Puna” in the Atacama region of the 
Cordillera in northern Chile, 
Serglo M. Espinoza 
Santiago, Chile 
MODEL OF THE GENRE 
 
Sir, 
| am a student at a Hungarlan gram- 
mar school and am studying foreign 
languages to become a linguist. | am 
writing to tell you how much | appre- 
clate the “Unesco Courier” and cannot 
congratulate you too highly both on 
the presentation and the quality of your 
review. It has a profound sense of 
history and art and | am constantly 
showing It to my friends as a model of 
the genre. 
| should be glad to read more in the 
“Unesco Courier® about translations 
and language education in other coun- 
tries.

POPULATION EXPLOSION 
 
Sir, 
Overpopulation is one of the funda- 
mental causes (perhaps the most 
important) of the despoiling of nature 
because of the Industrial expansion that 
inevitably follows it. 
One way to reduce the birth rate 
would surely be to limit the payment 
of family allowances to three children 
per family. A measure of this kind, 
clearly, could only be adopted after an 
intensive public information campaign 
had been carried out. 
In my view, the whole question of 
birth control should be re-appraised and 
the subject should be introduced as a 
part of general education In schools. 
All countries would do well to reflect 
on the gravity of the problem while 
there Is still time, 
Adrien Grosrey 
Geneva, Switzerland   33

Maharashtra State, India, has been award- 
ed the 1972 Mohammed Reza Pahlavi Lit- 
eracy Prize presented by the Shahinshah of 
fran. Since 1961, the Movement has taught 
9.7 million people to read and write and 
has eradicated illiteracy in 36,693 villages 
and hamlets. The 1972 Nadezhda K. Krup- 
skaya Prize, sponsored by the U.S.SR, 
went to Iran's Literacy Corps. Since 1962, 
when the Literacy Corps was founded, 
young Iranian men and women doing their 
national service have taught more than a 
million children and half a million adults 
to read and write. The awards were 
presented by Unesco's Director-General, 
Mr. René Maheu, on International Literacy 
Day, September 8. 
Treasures of prehistoric art 
Our Issue, "The Emergence of Man” 
(August-September 1972) featured a num- 
ber of photographs by Jean Vertut, taken 
from André Leroi-Gourhan’s remarkable 
book “Préhistoire de [Art Occidental” 
published by Editions Mazenod, Paris. This 
authoritative study has been published in 
English ("Treasures of Prehistoric Art") by 
H.N. Abrams, New York, and has appeared 
in several other language editions. The 
illustrations published in the “Unesco

The stepping-up of international action to 
curb art thefts was studied by art and 
security experts at a recent meeting spon- 
sored by Unesco and the Belgian National 
Commission for Unesco at Ham Castle, 
near Brussels. Among a broad range of 
subjects dealt with were the problems 
posed by security in museums, public 
buildings and archaeological sites, the 
control of trade In art, the Insurance of 
collections, and national and International 
regulations governing the Import and 
export of art works.

Prof. Auger was director of Unesco’s 
Department of Sciences from 1948 until 
1959, and director of the European Space 
Research Organization, in Paris, from 1962 
to 1967. Author of numerous works on

School of tomorrow 
The school of tomorrow as envisaged by some leading American educationists, architects and commu- 
nications experts. As shown in this artist's impression, it would have three towers for teaching human 
resources, science and cultural media. Each tower provides education at kindergarten, school and 
university level with the help of computers, radio, films, television and other audio-visual aids. Serious 
obstacles and problems which have brought a crisis in world education will need to be overcome before 
such ideal “scholastic cities” of the year 2000 become a reality. These problems are examined and 
radical solutions proposed in the report on Unesco’s recent inquiry into the state of world education 
which provides the theme of this issue of the "Unesco Courier”.
