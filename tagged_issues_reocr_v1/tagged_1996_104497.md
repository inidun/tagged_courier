Javier Pérez de Cuellar 
    
Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, 
former Secretary-General of the 
United Nations, headed the 
independent World Commission on 
Culture and Development which 
spent three years (1993-1995) 
rethinking the notions of 
development and culture and the 
relationship between them, Here 
he outlines the Commission's 
approach to its task and sums up 
some of the conclusions it reached.

“\ Mz 
BH The World Commission on Culture and 
Development was the first group of 
distinguished development economists, social 
scientists, artists and policy-makers to reflect 
together so intensively on the relationships 
between culture and development. How does 
its work take us forward? 
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar: First, it shows how we 
can and mst broaden the notion of devel- 
opment itself. Development divorced from its 
human or cultural context is growth without 
a soul. And economic development in its full 
flowering is part of a pcople’s enlture. In 
these years of momentons change, which

offer people such nuprecedented opportu- 
nities yet such unequal aceess to these 
opportunities, it is particularly timely, it 
seems to me, that this idea be asserted and 
promoted internationally. 
Because material measurements of “pro- 
egress” ave no satisfactory index of human wel- 
fare, the search for other criteria has led, for 
example, to the notion of human develop- 
ment, that measures improvements in a broad 
array of eapabilities, ranging from political, 
economic and social freedom to individual 
opportunities for being healthy, educated, and 
creative and for enjoying self-respect and 
hnman rights. Calture was implied in this 
notion but it was not explicitly introdueed. We 
have shown why it mnst be introduced and 
how it ean be. This ts an important step for- 
ward in rethinking development. 
The second advance, it seems to me, is to 
have transformed the way we look at the 
pairing of the terms “culture” and “develop- 
ment”. Is it simply cnltnre and development? 
Or is it culture in development? Culture for 
development? Or development for culture? 
Once yon define culture as we have—as 
“ways of living together”—and once devel- 
opment is seen as a process that enhances 
the freedom of people everywhere to pursne 
whatever goals they have reason to value, 
then culture must be far more than just an 
aspect or a means of development. 
However important it may be as an instru- 
ment of development (or an obstacle to it), 
culture should not be reduced to being a 
mere promoter of (or impediment to) eco- 
nomic growth. Rather, itis the end and aim of 
development when the latter is seen as the 
flourishing of human existence as a whole. 
The converse, which is the purely instru- 
mental view, was nicely characterized hy one 
scholar as the “add culture and stir” school. 
I think many people expeeted the Commis- 
sion to at least inventory all the ingredients 
that one might “add and stir” so as to 
improve development programmes as cur- 
rently conceived, if not prodnec entirely new 
recipes of its own! 
BM Did you adopt that approach? 
J. P. de C.: We took a different tack. Tuman 
beings value goods and services because of 
what they contribute to our freedom to live 
the way we value. And what we have reason 
to value must itself he a matter of culture. 
So while it has. far-reaching instrumental 
functions in development, this cannot be all 
there is to it. There is also the role of cul- 
ture as a desirable end in itself, as giving 
meaning to onr existence. This dual role 
applies not only to the promotion of economic 
erowth but to ether objeetives, suel as sus- 
taining the environment, enhancing social 
cohesion or fostering civil institutions in a 
soetety. Insofar as we have reason to value 
these objectives, naturally we would value 
the attitudes and behaviours that help us 
attain them. But when we turn te the more 
hasic guestion—why concentrate on these 
objectives in the first place?—cnlture has to 
enter in a more fundamental way. Not as a 
servant of ends, but as the soeial basis of the 
ends themselves. 
The third important step forward the 
Commission has made, in my opinion, has 
been to explore the myriad ways in which 
cultural diversity is a strength, not a weak- 
ness; why there ean be as many different ver- 
sions of development as there are cultures; 
why we must find ways of allowing peoples 
from every part of the planet to contribute 
to “modernity” in their own terms; and why it 
is vitally important to preserve our diverse 
heritages in an era so rich in the potential for 
...There is also the role of culture as a 
desirable end in itself, as giving meaning 
to our existence.

### 104415: Our creative diversity

fraught with the menace of homogenization. 
This is the hasic message we sought to put 
across in the title—Our Creative Diversity— 
we chose for our report. 
Once again, we offer no recipes. To dis- 
cuss culture today is to admit a multiplicity 
of readings. Hence instead of tailor-made 
solutions, we preferred to raise some of the 
hard questions that people face, particularly 
in the developing countries. ow to deal 
with the paradoxes of globalization? How to 
find order and meaning in a werld disorder 
full of uncertainty, incoherence and injus- 
tice? How to claim a space for locally rooted 
culture yet take part in shared, planetary 
processes? How, in a word, to elaborate their 
own models of development? 
BM We take your point that there can be no 
recipes. But what are your main messages? 
J. P. de C.: We decided to explore ten key 
areas in which the interactions between cul- 
ture and development appeared particularly 
acute or especially pertinent. In each case, 
we focused on the challenges of diversity, 
and the potential of human creativity, 
Intolerance is particularly pernicious when it 
is the policy of intolerant governments, 
opening the door to discrimination, 
segregation and 
the unesco (DURIER + WSEPTEMBER 1996 
exclusion. 
As the globalization of markets, technology 
and information sweeps the planet, the fear of 
growing homogenization induces aeeelerating 
fragmentation. People are bronght closer 
together; simultaneously, they are driven 
apart. Bridges ntust be built between them. 
What values can provide shared points of ref- 
erence, the minimal moral guidance the world 
must heed? Many different sets of values 
could enrich such common ground. We for 
our part identifted five principles: human 
rights and responsibilities; demoeracy; the pro- 
tection of minorities; commitment to peaceful 
conflict resolution and fair negotiation and the 
promotion of equity. 
HB What was your position on pluralism? 
J.P. de C.: We could not avoid reaffirming a 
commitment to pluralism, as a basie tenet, 
Not only as an ideal for relations between 
nations but also within nations. How can 
each nation create a sense of itself as a eivie 
community, freed from any connotations of 
ethnic exclusivity? 
We asked the question hannted by the 
ethnic conflicts erupting across the world 
even as we deliberated—each one the bitter 
harvest of diversity mismanaged or cynically 
manipulated, with the terrible price innocent 
people have had to pay and the consequent 
rising tide of human despair and anger. 
Surely the lesson of our terrible century is 
clear by now: we must learn to rejoice at cul- 
tural differences and attempt to learn from 
them. 
Governments can hardly prescribe such 
attitudes and behaviour as respect and 
rejoicing, but they can prohibit attacks on 
people from different cultures and their 
practices, and they can set the legal stage for 
mutual tolerance and accommodation. Intol- 
erance is particularly pernicious when it is 
the policy of intolerant governments. Dis- 
crimination, segregation and exclusion based 
on cultural traits then deny people their 
basic cultural rights. In these cases strong

invalidate 
another, 
though it may

new concepts, 
categories and 
insights. 
international pressures should be used to 
denounce such policies and practices, as the 
international community was able to do suc- 
eessfully in South Africa. 
BM What is the role of democracy in this 
context? 
J.P. de C.: The only way to achieve pluralism 
that delivers equity as well as political sta- 
bility is to make society an inclusive whole, 
extending opportunities to all groups. This 
requires a democratic framework, consider- 
able decentralization of power and equal 
access to institutions of justice. All of these 
in turn require real creativity in governance. 
The notion of creativity was a sccond leit- 
motiv for us, as the leaven of diversity. We 
urged therefore that the idea of creativity be 
move broadly applied to problem-solving in 
every field. In the arts and cultural expres- 
sion, it is too often taken for granted in our 
world of commodified culture, and its col- 
leetive and participatory forms remain under- 
valued. We noted also that scientific and 
technological knowledge, creatively adapted 
to local circumstances, can De strongly 
cmpowering. 
WM The Commission devoted specific attention 
to women and young people... 
J. P.de C.: Development is changing cultural 
perceptions of women’s and men’s life cycles 
as well as patterns of gender relations. It is 
time to develop agendas which would avoid 
the dual pitfalls of ethnocentrism and 
Western bias on the one hand, and unprinei- 
pled forms of cultural relativism which deny 
women their basic human rights in the name 
of “difference”, on the other. Ilence it Is 
important, we think, to devise and apply 
policies with regard to women’s rights as 
human rights; reproductive freedom; and to 
gender-aware planning and civic and cul- 
tural participation. 
[ow can we construct a world in which 
the defences of peace are built in young 
minds? Young people today are better able 
than their parents to appreciate the diversity 
of values and forms of expression and ave 
generally more comfortable with technology. 
Yet they must be helped to realize that no 
culture can ever be thought to invalidate 
another—though it may often be able to 
enrich it by new concepts, categories, and 
insights. Our generation has a responsibility 
to encourage positive exposure to both diver- 
sity and complexity. 
BM Your recommendations are set forth in an 
“International Agenda” that some people 
appear to find over-ambitious. 
J. P. de C.: We designed onr “International 
Agenda” to be selective and illustrative, not 
comprehensive. First and foremost, we wanted 
it to deepen the analysis of enltnre and devel- 
opment. We wanted it to focus energies 
around practical initiatives such as the inter- 
national mobilization of Cultural Ieritage Vol- 
nnteers and an international plan for gender 
equality. We hoped it would lead to the emer- 
gence of an international consensus on the 
core issues we raised, partienlarly through 
the universal recognition of cultural rights, 
and of the need to balance these rights with 
responsibilities, 
When we call for a reformed United 
Nations that really represents “We the peo- 
ples of the United Nations”, with a two- 
chamber General Assembly, one with govern- 
ment representatives as at present, and the 
other representing national eivil society orga- 
nizations, we are perhaps even further away 
from our goal than the visionaries who first 
imagined a European union some seventy 
years ago and were considered hopelessly 
unrealistic at the time! But we have laboured 
not only for our peers, but also for our chil- 
dren and our children’s ¢hildren. On the eve 
of a new millennium, as my fellow Commis- 
stoner Celso I'urtado has put it, “the chal- 
lenge we face is to conceive a new Utopia 
without which the survival of humanity will 
not be possible.” ||

### 104416: What is development?

  
 
What is 
development? 
Is it a soulless process of economic growth 
dedicated exclusively to the creation of wealth 
and regarding everything, including culture, as a 
commodity? Or is it part of a broader endeavour 
to construct a society whose members are both 
participants and beneficiaries and whose goals are 
not limited to economics but shaped by the 
values to which these people subscribe? 
These questions, which have long been 
asked, were recently re-examined in depth 
during a three-year enquiry (1993-1995) carried 
out by a distinguished World Commission on 
Culture and Development chaired by Mr. Javier 
Pérez de Cuéllar. The Commission’s overall 
findings have recently been published by 
UNESCO in the form of an excellent report 
entitled Our Creative Diversity. 
This issue of the UNESCO Courier is natu- 
rally more limited in scope than the Report. It is 
an attempt, via contributions from some of 
those who helped the World Commission in its 
deliberations, to present this complex issue to a 
wide public in simple terms. The conjunction of 
two such disparate terms as development and 
culture 1s 1n itself enough to give rise to misun- 
derstandings, false problems and false solutions, 
and therefore invites caution.

The dominant economic system is being 
called to account. Its driving principle—rampant 
worldwide competition for profit in an open 
market—deploys a logic that is based on greed, 
inequality and pollution and in cffect condemns 
the majority of the world’s people to a grim fate. 
Today this system 1s being contested at various 
levels, ranging froin root and branch opposition 
to piecemeal criticism of its specific effects. Cul- 
ture often seems to be the spearhead of this 
challenge. But what, one might ask, is the true 
role and nature of culture? 
Some, in the North, simply regard culture as 
an instrument—as one factor among others in 
the search for profit or as a corrective to certain 
excesses of the system of production. Others, 
in the South, use culture as an emblem of iden- 
tity which can be brandished against Western 
ways of life. In so doing, they do not attack the 
dominant system’s fundamental flaws, its 
propensity to create socio-economic inequali- 
ties and environmental damage, but the political 
and legal institutions that are its concomitants in 
democracies (individual freedoms, human rights 
and political pluralism). Here, support for cul- 
tural specificity masks the defence of conserva- 
tive interests in patriarchal and despotic socicties 
or the total rejection of Western society in the 
name of a programme which is to a greater or 
lesser extent fundamentalist. 
Yet another way of looking at culture (in the 
broadest sense) is to regard it as a source of self- 
renewal and a lever of change—as the bearer of 
moral, aesthetic and spiritual values that can 
endow economic activity with nobler purposes 
than the profit motive, help to liberate people 
from need and ignorance, stimulate their cre- 
ative impulses, and establish new forms of soli- 
darity between individuals, between peoples, 
and between humankind and nature. 
The goal of culture regarded in this way is not 
to detach—and isolate—a given region or com- 
munity from the rest of the world, but to enable 
it to play a part in the system of global exchange 
while enjoying full respect for its dignity, its 
originality and its essential interests. 
Culture in this sense is not at odds with eco- 
nomics; it provides economics with a human 
face. It is the very core of a society’s way of life, 
defining the purposes and standards which 
show it at its best. 
But if culture is to play this role effectively, 
it must not be venerated as a sacrosanct 
immutable tradition but regarded as a malleable 
process capable of adapting to new situations 
while retaining a certain essential continuity. It 
must be able to sacrifice superstitions, habits and 
inclinations that have become oppressive, and— 
in the interests of self-renewal and free expres- 
sion—to borrow from other societies criteria of 
efficiency that have proved their worth. 
But surely there is nothing new in this. Are not 
today’s living cultures those which refused to 
become fossilized and, instead of trying to make 
time stand still, took root in time, drew fertility 
from it and thus remained eternally youthful?

 MISEPTEMBER 1996 
here are two ways of looking at 
development in the contempo- 
rary world. One, deeply influ- 
enced by growth economics 
and the values that underlie it, 
regards development as essen- 
tially a rapid and sustained expansion of gross 
national (or domestic) product per head, per- 
haps qualified by some requirement that the 
fruits of this expansion reach all sections of 
the community. I shall call this “the opulence 
view of development.” In this approach, 
values and culture have no foundational place. 
A second, contrasting view sees develop- 
ment as a process that enhances the freedom 
of those involved to pursue whatever objec- 
tives they value. In this, which I shall call “the 
effective freedom view of development”, the 
importance of economic opulence is left to 
& 
BY AMARTYA SEN 
the values of the people involved, and is thus 
culturally conditioned. 
In line with this view of development, the 
expansion of human capability may be 
described as the central feature of develop- 
ment. The concept of a person’s “capability” 
can be traced back to Aristotle, for whom the 
life of a person could be scen as a sequence of 
things the person does, or states of being he 
or she achieves, and which constitute a col- 
lection of “functionings”. “Capability” refers 
to the alternative combinations of function- 
ings from which a person can choose. Thus, 
the notion of capability is essentially one of 
freedom—the range of options a person has 
in deciding what kind of life to lead. Poverty, 
in this view, lies not merely in the impover- 
ished state in which a person may actually 
live, but also in the lack of real opportunity—

imposed by social constraints as well as per- 
sonal circumstances—to choose other types 
of living. Even low incomes, meagre posses- 
sions, and other aspects of what are stan- 
dardly seen as economic poverty are relevant 
ultimately because of their role in curtailing 
capabilities (that is, in severely restricting 
people’s opportunities to lead valuable and 
valued lives). 
The application of this broader view of 
development thus involves specific 
hypotheses about the values people have 
reason to cherish. Economists who have 
studied this problem have been particularly 
attentive to indicators of quality of life such as 
longevity, good health, adequate nutrition, basic 
education, absence of gender-based inequality, 
and basic political and social freedoms. 
This approach, which is based on people’s

just for the help that it might 
give to economic growth, but 
because it is an essential part 
of cultural development.”

values, differs from the radical « priori judg- 
ment implicit in the “opulence” view of 
development. If, given the choice, people 
would rather have longer and more disease- 
free lives with more autonomy rather than a 
higher level of GNP per head, then the 
“cffective freedom” view of development 
can be applied to their case, but not the “opu- 
lence” view of development. 
In the opulence view of development, the 
focus is uncompromisingly on the growth of 
incomes. However, while classical economic 
theorists from Adam Smith to John Stuart 
Mill did indeed write a great deal on the 
growth of real income per head, they saw 
income as onc of several different means to 
important ends, and they discussed exten- 
sively the nature of these ends—very dif- 
ferent as they are from income.

Smith, Mill and other classical authors 
were deeply concerned with the idea that we 
value many things other than income and 
wealth which relate to real opportunities to 
lead the kind of life we would value living. 
Their writings reveal great interest in the 
foundational importance of our ability to do 
the things we value, and have reason to value. 
They commented fairly extensively on the 
connection between these matters, on the 
one hand, and income, wealth, and other eco- 
nomic circumstances, on the other, and they 
had much to say on public policies that sup- 
port and promote the more basic ends on 
which we may choose to concentrate. 
Evaluating 
economic growth 
In the opulence view of development, the role 
of culture is purely instrumental, helping in 
particular to promote rapid economic growth. 
The question thus arises as to whether eco- 
nomic growth can be valued for its own sake, 
thus leading to the treasuring of those things 
(including culture) that promote growth? Or 
is economic growth itself an instrument, with 
less claim to a foundational role than cultural 
aspects of human life may have? It is hard to 
think that people have good reason to value 
goods and services irrespective of what they 
do to our freedom to live in a way we would 
value. It is also difficult to accept that culture 
can have a purely instrumental role. Surely, 
what we have reason to value must be itself a 
matter of culture, and in this sense we cannot 
reduce culture to a subsidiary position as a 
mere promoter of economic growth. How 
can we make our reasoned valuing completely 
valueless? 
It is thus important to acknowledge the far- 
reaching instrumental functions of culture in 
development but also to recognize that culture 
cannot be reduced to these functions. Culture 
also plays, for example, an intrinsic role in eval- 
uating the process of economic development, 
as well as in making room for less immediate 
objectives such as sustaining the environment 
and preserving the diversity of species. 
Some cultural parameters can help, and 
others will hinder, the fulfilment of these 
objectives, and we have grounds for valuing 
those cultural attitudes and features that 
foster this fulfilment. But when we turn to 
the more basic question, namely, why con- 
centrate on these objectives, culture must 
appear not as a servant of ends, but as the 
social basis of those ends themselves. We 
cannot begin to understand the so-called 
“cultural dimension of development”

A foundational role 
Since the language of “sustaining” has become 
common in the literature of development, it 
1s not surprising that the phrase “culturally 
sustainable development” has made its 
appearance. Is this the right direction to take, 
in moving away from a purely instrumental 
view of culture in development? 
There are two major drawbacks in using 
language of this kind. First, it ignores the con-_ 
stitutive role of culture. If culture is only to 
do the “sustaining”, we still have to ask what 
is to be sustained. Focusing on “culturally 
sustainable development” is to alienate cul- 
ture from its foundational role in judging 
development, and to treat it just as a means of 
sustaining “development” —no matter how 
that is defined. This is, in other words, an

ornamental debasement of culture to the 
status of a glorified instrument in sustaining 
“development”, defined independently. 
The second problem comes from a dif- 
ferent direction. Culture admits of 
dynamism, evolution and refinement. Cul- 
ture in every country in the world has 
changed over the centuries. The rhetoric of 
“sustaining”—as opposed to having the 
freedom to grow and develop—frames the 
cultural debate in prematurely conserva- 
tionist terms. There is a dis-analogy with the 
environment, here. When it comes to the 
natural environment, we don’t try to 
improve the best that nature gave us; we try 
to “conserve” what we have got, and perhaps 
return to what we had earlier. But culture is 
the fountain of our creativity and progress. 
Sustaining is too feeble a role for it to play in 
development. Once we shift our attention 
from the purely instrumental view of culture 
and accept its constructive and creative role, 
we have to sce development in terms that 
include cultural development as well. 
The three roles of culture 
Culture comes into development in three 
quite distinct-—~though interrelated—ways. 
HB Constitutive role: Development in the 
broadest sense includes cultural develop- 
ment. Cultural development is a basic and 
inseparable component of development in 
general. If people are deprived of the oppor- 
tunity to understand and cultivate their cre- 
ativity, then that in itself is a hindrance to 
development (not just because it may hurt 
cconomic growth, or some other externally 
specified objective). Basic education is thus 
important not just for the help that it might 
give to economic growth, but because itis an 
essential part of cultural development. 
EH Evaluative role: What we value is, ulti- 
ately, influencable by culture. There is no 
externally sanctified importance to economic 
growth or any other such objective, and the 
things that we intrinsically value reflect the 
impact of our culture. Even if the same things 
are valued in many different societies (if, for 
example, longer and happier lives without ill- 
health are sought in many quite different 
societies), this does not make them indepen- 
dent of values or cultures, but only indicates 
the congruence of valuational reasons in dis- 
tinct societies. 


### 104417: A Matter of choice

H Instrumental role: No matter what 
objectives we value, their pursuit is to some 
extent influenced by the nature of our cul- 
tures and ethics. While there is more to cul- 
ture than this, we must not ignore the fact that 
cultural parameters do inter alia have strong 
instrumental roles. This applies not merely to 
the promotion of economic growth, but also 
to the achievement of other objectives such 
as raising the quality of life, 
Central to culture is freedom, and in par- 
ticular, the freedom to decide what we have 
reason to value, and what lives we have 
reason to seck. The instrumental, the evalua- 
tive and the constructive roles of culture all 
relate, ultimately, to this freedom. |

or the first time in history, the 
global market and telecommu- 
nications have brought people 
of all the cultures of the world 
into permanent contact. While 
this is an astonishing historical 
achievement, it is bringing both benefits and 
liabilities. Better communications between 
cultures may bring greater understanding, or 
greater friction. Increased trade, conducted 
in a just and equitable manner, may provide 
more people with access to necessary prod- 
ucts and services; yet it may also wipe out 
livelihoods and leave people destitute as 
information on the new markets eludes 
them. More technology increases our under- 
standing and capacity for managing the envi- 
ronment and our own genetic processes: yet 
it may lead to the de-skilling of the cultures 
in a “brave new world”. The manner in 
which these processes evolve will depend on 
how people react to such new possibilities. 
This 1s the reason why culture needs to be 
made visible as the context in which societies 
evolve. Development thinking and policies 
must, as a matter of urgency, take up the 
issues of co-operation, community, trust, 
cthnicity and identity since these make up the 
social fabric on which the polity and the 
economy are based. In many parts of the 
world, exclusive emphasis on competition 
and the market are altering these sensitive 
equilibrium factors and exacerbating cultural 
tensions and feelings of uncertainty. 
The way to situate oneself in the world 
most readily is by enumerating the traits of 
one’s culture, which are best defined by 
being set in contrast with those of other cul- 
tures. Human beings enjoy a feeling of polit- 
ical and psychological certainty by being 
enclosed within symbolically visible cultural 
boundaries, although these are contextualized 
in historically continuous cultural flows. 
Shifting boundaries 
Now that these boundaries are shifting, 
people are having to rethink their place in a 
microglobal world. In the past, national bor- 
ders circumscribed laws, state policies, 
economics, politics, education and, as a rule,

demography, as well as culturally expressive 
collective rituals and ceremonies. This highly 
centralized, mechanical scheme must now 
open up to more flexible participative arrange- 
ments in which the realities of economic inter- 
dependence and cultural identities may be 
incorporated. 
Complex identities 
The great battle today is between a humanist, 
rational culture, which proposes respect for 
all cultures and religions, and manichean cul- 
tures, which posit the intolerant imposition 
of exclusive creeds. 
The rational culture secks political solutions 
to today’s eruption of entitlements (human, 
national, bioethical, gender, ethnic and reli- 
gious) which involves a new co-evolutionary 
viston that will lead to new agreements, reor- 
ganizing existing institutions and, in some 
cases, building new ones. At the individual 
level, it advocates multi-layered arrangements 
of identities that will allow a person to recog- 
nize his or her place in the world simultane- 
ously as a planetary inhabitant, a citizen of a 
nation-state, a gendered being, an affiliate of a 
particular culture—or several, according to 
ancestry, geography or choice—and a holder 
of beliefs in a given religion. 
The opposing cosmopolitical scheme 
entails the enforced imposition on other 
people of one’s own cultural affiliation, polit- 
ical system or religious creed. Such a vision 
may lead to successive killings since each vic- 
tory ensures that revenge will be sought by 
the defeated party within a few years. 
What is new in today’s shifting of cultural 
boundaries is that these are interwoven with 
the political reorganization of the role of 
nation-states on the global stage. Significantly, 
new legislation, institutions and participation 
mechanisms related to cultural pluralism con- 
stitute by their very nature proposals for new 
political schemes to organize public life. 
However, while creativity has brought 
about a revolution in technology, communi- 
cations and the arts, it has barely touched 
institutions and procedures of governance. 
The transformation of institutions and the 
search for civic ties to allow different groups 
of people to live together are more urgent 
than ever. They must be based on recognition 
of the equal dignity of people and of their cul- 
tures. Experience has taught us that gover- 
nance that denies cultural identities leads to 
barren tyranny, and culture without gover- 
nance leads to unmanageable conflict. ||

THE AGE OF THE 
MIGRANT ARTIST 
BY MICHAEL HAERDTER 
ur globalizing world scems to be 
marked by rapidly increasing chaos, 
a profound crisis of the ideas of 
order, coherence and limitation that 
long prevailed and whose legend we 
arc still addicted to. Linear systems 
in the sciences arc slowly giving way to what has been 
labelled “chaos theory”. A clear and calculable image 
of the world is fading, and the ideas of national 
integrity and coherence are increasingly revealed as 
an illusion. 
The traditional concept of separate cultures 
based on ethnic homogeneity and national singularity 
has become untenable, whether we like it or not. 
Cultures today are in gencral characterized by 
hybridization. Our lives are defined by more than 
onc culture of which our personalities are crossing 
points. We have hyphenated identities, and our cen- 
tury might be seen as a “hyphenated” period whose 
dramatic turning points and murderous climaxes 
reveal the death-throes of one world and the birth- 
pangs of another. 
The ivory tower in which solitary artists strove 
for transcendental purity has been abandoned. Post- 
modern artists have left their lonely studios and 
returned to the marketplaces of the world. Instead of 
creating timeless works of museum art, they com- 
municate ideas and emotions, often by provocative 
concepts or irritating objects and installations. The 
formalist master perfecting his style over a lifetime is 
a model which has been replaced by that of the artist 
capable of formally mastering an existential message 
or situation at any moment of his or her life. Art 
today is largely interventionist and temporary. It can 
happen anywhere. The studio of the postmodern 
artist is the world. 
Migrating artists are among the many transcul- 
tural messengers of a world whose keywords are 
nomadism and globalism. The postmodern inven- 
tion and worldwide spreading of residential arts cen- 
tres are onc response to the needs of artists and intel- 
lectuals to experience the world and its many envi- 
ronments and cultures, to be temporarily part of 
creative communities and to exchange ideas and 
knowhow. The networking of centres across 
national and cultural barriers is part of the post- 
modern game, as is the crossing of borders between 
arts and technologies that many of these centres are 
able to provide. ||

THE RESURGENCE OF RELIGION 
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN L. ESPOSITO 
BM The resurgence of religion is one of the 
most powerful forces to have influenced 
culture and development in recent times. 
When did it start? In what parts of the world 
is it prevalent? 
John L. Esposito: Iran’s Islamic revolution in 1978- 
1979 threw light on a reassertion of Islam that had 
been going on for more than a decade 1n some 
Islamic countries. Since then Islam has re- 
emerged as a major force in political and social 
development. Certain movements have engaged 
in campaigns of terror in attempts to destabilize or 
overthrow governments. Moderate Islamists have 
emerged as social and political activists, espousing 
the re-islamization of society. 
In Latin America, Catholic liberation theology 
has informed attempts at social and political 
reform. It emerged shortly after the Medellin con- 
ference of Catholic bishops in 1968, which 
reflected the spirit of the Second Vatican Council, 
: 
} 
and its message was re-emphasized at the 1979 
conference of Catholic bishops at Puebla, with its 
emphasis on Christianity’s “preferential option for 
the poor”. It has been accompanied by greater 
recognition of the role and participation of the laity 
in the Church, and a greater emphasis on the rela- 
tionship of the Church to the world, in particular 
to 1ssues of justice and equality. In Eastern Europe, 
Christian churches played a significant role in the 
fall of communism and the emergence of a 
democracy movement. 
In Sri Lanka, conflict between Sinhalese (Bud- 
dhists) and Tamils (Hindus) has had devastating 
consequences during the past decade. India, an 
ostensibly secular state, has experienced multiple 
communal conflicts, often motivated by the chal- 
lenge of religious nationalism. Clashes between 
Muslims and Hindus at Avodhya, where Hindus 
seized a mosque claiming it as an ancient Hindu 
religious site, and conflict over family law have

» heightened tensions between the two communi- 
ties. In the southern Philippines, militant Muslim 
factions have agitated for autonomy from the ‘Injustice has driven many to their local place of worship where 
“Christian dominated” government. In the former the scripture is read and experienced as a message to their 
Soviet Union, emergent religious nationalism in 
Central Asia is matched by new religio-political 
impulses of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
All these events remind us of the potential 
force of religion in the developing world in partic- 
ular. They reveal the fragility of many nation-states 
and the issues of identity and legitimacy that con- 
tribute to the vulnerability of many governments. 
HM What forms do these movements take? 
J. L. E.: Revivalist movements are communities 
within communities. They view themselves as just 
societies established within broader unjust soci- 
eties. They tend to be manifestations of popular 
religion, that is, organizations that are born from 
populist movements rather than from the official 
or institutional church or clergy. These organiza- 
tions create a new religious consciousness and 
sense of identity and mission. Religious beliefs and 
rituals are reinterpreted to provide direction, as 
the faithful combine their quest for happiness in 
the next life with a determined effort to create a 
better life in the here and now. 
BM What are the causes of religious revivalism 
in the developing world? 
J. L. E.: The new and better world promised by 
modernizing elites and development experts has 
not materialized for many. The modern nation- 
state with its secularism, consumerism and unfet- 
tered individualism has often produced societies 
in which the needs of the majority are subordi- 
nated to those of a minority. Maldistribution of 
wealth, corruption, unemployment and housing 
shortages have become endemic. Modernization 
and urbanization have resulted in overcrowded 
cities, social dislocation and culture shock, urban 
slums and barrios.of shattered expectations, a 
breakdown of the family in the midst of the more 
“permissive and foreign” ways of the city. 
The development of non-Western countries 
was based upon a theory of modernization that 
equated development with the progressive west- 
ernization and secularization of society. Religion 
tended to be regarded as a major hindrance to 
political and social change. Science and technology 
were seen as powerful handmaidens in this 
process of secular development. However, not 
hopeless or desperate situation.’ 
HB What is the basis of this religious revival? 
J. L. E.: Generally speaking, its representatives claim 
to offer a more authentic and religiously-based 
society. They espouse themes of liberation, social 
justice and equality, and project themselves as 
champions of the poor and oppressed. Injustice has 
driven many to their local mosques or churches 
where the scripture is read and experienced as a 
message to their hopeless or desperate situation. In 
some countries, Islamic movements have provided 
an alternative set of social welfare services. Similarly, 
Catholic liberation theology has been essentially a 
response to the plight of the poor. 
BM Sos this a kind of backlash by those who 
have lost out from development, who are 
turning their backs on the world and rejecting 
modern technology and the communications 
revolution? 
J. L. E.: Most revivalists do not believe that they 
are retreating. Many see themselves as reclaiming 
the original message and guidance of their 
prophets and scriptures, a message obscured with 
the passage of time and the assault of modern scc- 
ularism. They fault or incriminate the impact not 
only of colonialism but also of despotic govern- 
ments that came later, entrenched elites, and a 
clergy that itself came to constitute an unrespon- 
sive religious establishment. 
These movements have attracted educated 
professionals—teachers, engineers, lawyers, scien- 
tists and bureaucrats. Many of their leaders arc 
graduates from faculties of medicine, science and 
engineering, who have harnessed modern tech- 
nology—radio, television, audio and videocas- 
settes, computers and fax machines—to organize 
and mobilize mass support and disseminate their 
religious and socio-political message. 
Thus technology and communications have

J. L. E.: Underestimation of the continued presence 
and power of religion, and its role as a source of 
identity and solidarity, has led some modernists to 
reject the challenge of seeking a civilizational dia- 
logue. For myself, I do not think there is a neces- 
sary incompatibility between religion and modern 
change, or democracy. History has revealed many 
examples of the flexibility or plasticity of religious 
traditions, as well as examples of intransigence. The 
transition in the West from divine right monarchies 
and feudalism to modern political and economic 
institutions took centuries, and so too did the reli- 
gious response to the challenge of modernity. 
We must realize that the modern transforma- 
tion of politics, society and religion is an open- 
ended process, imperfect and incomplete. Just as 
the successes of the modern nation-state cannot 
be denied, so too its shortcomings must be identi- 
fied and addressed. 
The eradication of poverty and illiteracy might 
address some of the causes of religious and political 
extremism, but it would not fully respond to the 
deeper religio-cultural issues of identity, authen- 
ticity, culture and values that are of equal impor- 
tance. Addressing the difficult issues of religion 
and modernity will require new theoretical and 
conceptual perspectives. 
BH How do you see the future? 
J. L. E.: Religion and culture will remain a signifi- 
cant force in development. The “either... or” 
dichotomies and allegiances of the past {secular and 
religious, sacred and profane, traditional and 
modern) will need to be transcended as govern- 
ments, societies, development experts and reli- 
gious leaders seek to identify areas for mutual 
understanding and co-operation.

A RECIPE FOR DISPOSSESSION 
INTERVIEW WITH SMITU KOTHARI 
THE UNESCO Courier WSEPTEMBER 1996 
HB You believe that current pattems of 
development are inimical to cultural pluralism 
in the Third World. Why is this? 
Smitu Kothari: In most Third World countries, 
the kind of development that has been pursued in 
the last five decades has widened the gap between 
those who have benefited from it and those who 
have become its victims. Structural inequity within 
and between nations, discriminatory and racist atti- 
tudes and the politics of natural resource use arc at 
the core of this polarization. 
Take the question of natural resources. The 
unsustainable extraction of natural resources 1s con- 
trolled by and benefits a privileged few, while the 
millions who depend on these natural resources, not

only for their subsistence but also as a source of their 
identity, are marginalized. Global cultural and cco- 
nomic hegemony, supported by new communica- 
tion technologies, is radically altering or threatening 
biological and cultural diversity. These issues are at 
the heart of the relationship between development 
and culture. 
HM Has nothing been done to halt these trends? 
S. K.: Significant efforts have been made to deal 
with these structural causes of inequity and there 
have been many plans to alleviate poverty, and yet 
the gap between rich and poor has grown wider. 
In India, my own country, for instance, in 1990, 20 
per cent of the population controlled 60 per cent 
of the assets and the bottom 20 per cent only con- 
trolled 1 per cent. The polarization of wealth is 
even more striking in countries like Mexico, 
where the top twenty-four families in 1993 owned 
more assets than 150 million people at the bottom 
of society. It could be argued that despite a growth 
in national and global middle classes, most national 
and international development has reproduced 
and intensified powerlessness. 
Inequality of access to productive resources 
and widespread lack (and loss) of control over deci- 
ston-making among a majority of the world’s popu- 
lation is one of the strongest threats to the diversity 
of cultures and the wisdom and knowledge 
enshrined in them. Market rationality and profit 
maximization are fundamentally incoinpatible with 
ecological sustainability, cultural plurality and social 
justice. And yet the fact that poverty and scarcity 
can be induced by development is not even grudg- 
ingly acknowledged, and there continues to be an 
almost spiritual belief that the market is a panacea. 
BH What effect are the emerging global 
alignments between multilateral banks, 
transnational corporations and economic and 
political elites having on cultural diversity? 
S. K.: Many people are arguing that these align- 
ments are recolonizing much of the planet in order 
to sustain and widen their economic dominance. 
Newer, more sophisticated forms of colonialism, 
including the colonialism of the mind, may be a far 
greater threat than the colonizations that occurred 
in the past. 
Current trends suggest that multilateral regimes 
like the World Trade Organization, though seem- 
ingly non-partisan, are bound to further capitalist 
accumulation by transnational corporations, indus- 
trialized countries and Third World clites. 
Transnational corporations (TNCs) exercise 
phenomenal influence over the global economy. 
The top fiftcen corporations now have gross 
incomes that are larger than the GDP of 120 coun- 
tries. TNCs control 70 per cent of world trade and 
own or control 80 per cent of the land that grows 
crops for export. TNCs have been the main agen- 
cies that have aggressively pushed for deregulation 
and privatization not only in national economies 
but also in multilateral agreements and conven- 
tions in the world economy as a whole. Efforts to 
make TNCs accountable and to develop a regime 
of social control have floundered under the might 
of the TNC lobby. 
If the marketplace is the arena where ethical 
and moral questions of our role on this planet arc 
sorted out, then culture will be restricted to 
accepting the dominant trends and to displays of 
theatre and dance during national festivals and 
visits by foreign dignitaries. 
BH How do the governments of developing 
countries react to this? 
S. K.: They hope that the dynamism and impetus 
generated by “development” projects will lead to 
progress and prosperity from which all citizens 
will benefit through a trickle-down process and 
that the fruits of science and technology will 
spread to all. This presumption is proving difficult

» to justify. Experience from countries across the 
world suggests that the bitter medicine of struc- 
tural adjustment favours the privileged and 
devalues or destroys those cultures, knowledge 
systems and ecologies that stand in the way of 
maximizing productivity and profit. At a time 
when the desire for democratic process and 
democratic institutions is growing, these countries 
continue to be largely dominated by processes and 
stitutions which remain unaccountable and 
undemocratic. 
Most Third World states operating under a 
dependent, capitalist mode of production have 
gradually dispensed with traditional institutions 
and spiritual ideologies, and seek legitimacy instead 
through economic growth and the doctrine of 
national security. In turn they endorse structures 
of economic development and hegemonic com- 
munications—both national and global—and priv- 
ilege a corpus of dominant languages at the expense 
of a vast pluralism of “people’s languages”. 
HB And how are people, rather than 
governments, responding? 
S. K.: Faced with growing economic and cultural 
insecurity, communities are reverting back to pri- 
mary or primordial loyalties. These are often rede- 
fined and manipulated by politicians to serve their 
own ends. Resurgent ethnicities do not necessarily 
become secular and egalitarian, still less do they pro- 
mote a truly democratic framework of diversity and 
pluralism. States have, often successfully, tried to 
selectively involve members of these ethnic groups 
either to win their favour, to nurture dissension, to 
retain control or seek political concessions. 
The past decade has also seen states absorb 
potentially “disruptive” associations, as well as other 
dissenting activity. Competing claimants have been 
absorbed into the machinery wherever possible. 
When routine controls have been ineffective, 
repressive measures have often been used. All this 
makes the task of nurturing political and cultural 
pluralism more difficult. Despite these trends, mil- 
lions of people are involved in diverse forms of col- 
lective action—from linking the blocks of an eco- 
logically and socially just society to mass mobiliza- 
tion in the form of social movements. 
BM What role should the state play in cultural 
life? 
S. K.: Serious problems arise when the state has 
responsibility to interfere in culture. But then, 
should this be better left to civil society? In this 
case, who will be involved and how can represen- 
tation and participation in cultural life be ensured? 
Won't the state always have to play some kind of 
non-partisan mediatory role? If not the state, then 
who will create the conditions that will nurture a 
plurality of languages and literature? Who will pre- 
serve and vitalize the folk heritage? 
‘Most national and international development so far has 
reproduced and intensified powerlessness.’ 
argues that culturally defined groups must be inte- 
grated into the “mainstream”, either to hasten the . 
“proletarianization” of the rural areas or to achieve 
a more “integrated” and homogeneous national 
society. In fact, most development literature in 
both these traditions fails to adequately acknowl- 
edge and explain both the homogenizing steam- 
roller effects of development and the persistent 
vitality of culturally based movements and their 
effects on people. 
The situation becomes more complex when, 
over the years, elites emerge from cultures that 
have previously been subjugated and discrimi- 
nated against and seek power or legitimacy by inte- 
grating themselves into the institutional main- 
stream. In some cases, these elites have abused 
their power and collaborated in the exploitation of 
the natural resource base that is the source of the 
identities and subsistence cconomies of their 
ethnic group. 
It is a tragedy that, in most parts of the Third 
World, popular cultures, particularly those of 
indigenous peoples, have been marginalized and 
subjected to an unequal conflict with powerful 
external political, economic and cultural forces. 
Cultural symbols that give meaning to lives are 
being lost, and to compound this loss, the newer 
cultural experiences that people are exposed to, 
such as television, advertising and consumerism, 
give rise to a structure of meanings and values that 
further undermine social and cultural security. 
Bl What specific impact are these processes 
having on languages in developing countries? 
S. K.: In countries like India there is still a phe- 
nomenal range of languages, but most ruling elites 
regard this diversity as pre-modern and inefficient, 
as leading to political instability and technical back- 
wardness. Their attitude reflects an obsessive con- 
cern with standardizing societies and streamlining 
their activities, jeopardizing the maintenance of 
variation as a vital reality of everyday life. 
Hl Is there a connection between 
environmental and cultural issues?

struggle to survive. Nature, for a vast majority of 
them, is the basis of their cosmology. 
Unfortunately, what is also being witnessed all 
over the world is a pervasive feeling among the 
middle class and those who defend a strong cen- 
tralized state structure that politically and cultur- 
ally “underdeveloped” people lack political matu- 
rity, rationality and efficiency to play a central role 
in modern times. 
HB What can be done to maintain cultural 
diversity? 
S. K.: There is a need to break the prevailing belief 
that national and global elites are the cultural van- 
guard, that knowledge defined by them is liber- 
ating. There are some signs that this may be 
starting to happen. The past two decades have seen 
a gradual build-up of popular initiatives on the part 
of those who have been marginalized and who 
seek the democratization of the state and the estab- 
lishment of an egalitarian social order. These 
people articulate an ccologically-sensitive, locally- 
rooted system of governance. In India, for 
instance, the rise of the Dalit movement and the 
‘There is a need to break away from the prevailing belief that 
knowledge defined by elites is necessarily liberating.’ 
  
  
growing self-confidence and assertiveness of the 
tribal people (of whom there are 60 million from 
over 200 different cultural groups) are evidence of 
fundamental shifts that are taking place in cultural 
and political life. 
It is, in fact, becoming increasingly evident 
that, despite advances in urbanization and com- 
munications, there is little likelihood that cultur- 
ally diverse ways of living can be homogenized, 
little chance that a single culture can be woven 
from such disparate strands. Nevertheless, there 
is no room for complacency, even though a diver- 
sity of subcultures will prevail. These subcultures 
will need understanding and committed represen- 
tatives to contest the hegemony of the authori- 
tarian (though increasingly sophisticated) state or 
reductionist economic development. 
The fundamental challenge is that of creating 
the political space in which the diversity of cul- 
tures can evolve democratic processes of mutual 
understanding and tolerance. It is a formidable 
challenge since it calls on us to reverse the con- 
quest of society by the economy, restore an ethic 
of self-discipline and recognize that positive values 
involve dignity as well as modest material security. 
We must commit ourselves to a struggle based on 
the belief that development is not feasible without 
restoring ethics to economics, without returning 
to a symbiotic relationship with nature, without 
taking into account in all we do every person on 
our fragile and beleaguered planet. [|

### 104458: A Vicious circle

A VICIOUS CIRCLE 
BY TERRENCE HEATH 
he accomplishments of tech- 
nology have been the text of a 
hymn to progress that has been 
loudly sung for the past 200 
years. It has been largely a hymn 
celebrating human control over Nature. 
Recently, however, the celebration has 
become more muted as we have begun to 
realize some of the effects that technological 
change can have not only on natural systems 
but also on our social and political systems. 
The most obvious concerns are what we call 
“environmental problems”. These include 
the impact of the automobile and the house- 
hold refrigerator as well as the incalculable 
issues associated with the operation of 
nuclear power stations and the disposal of 
nuclear wastes. Many other problems are 
connected with heavy industry, raw material 
extraction, production processes, disposal 
methods, the use of non-degradable pack- 
aging and the overconsumption of renewable 
and non-renewable resources made possible 
through “improved” harvesting technology. 
Managing the 
environment 
Solutions to these problems are almost always 
conceived of in terms of managing the envi- 
ronment. Through monitoring, regulation, 
better science and technology, and conserva- 
tion, we hope to correct at least the worst 
aspects of what is wrong. This approach to 
controlling environmental degradation 1s 
largely what is understood by the term “sus- 
tainable development”. Basically, we are 
saying that the instruments by which the sit- 
uation has been created can also be used to 
correct it. But while we must applaud 
Western culture’s concern to address the 
problems that it created in the first place, it is 
clear that this approach almost invariably pre- 
cludes looking outside the boundaries of 
Western culture when trying to define what 
sustainable means. 
At the same time as technology is being 
used to attempt to correct the problems it has 
created, there is a growing awareness of the 
social and political consequences of technology. 
Examples could be drawn from indigenous cul- 
tures around the globe, but the Inuit of Arctic 
Canada are a particularly striking example of a 
people who live in a remote part of a highly 
industrialized nation and have had to cope with 
dramatic change in two generations. 
The rifle, the powerboat and the skidoo 
have, for example, changed the Inuits’ techno- 
logical impact on their environment, and 
imported technologies have also changed 
social aspects of their culture. Inuit hunters can 
now travel to herds, make kills and bring the 
animals back to the settlement for processing. 
It is no longer necessary for them to live in 
camps close to the herds, and women and chil- 
dren no longer take part in the hunt itself as 
they did during the time of camp life. The 
women and children become increasingly set- 
tlement-minded, and this attitude is reinforced 
by schools, health care facilitics, jobs, and per- 
manent, independent homes. 
Relationships within the family change; 
the use of language changes; the role of clders 
changes. In addition to its effects on the ani- 
mals and the terrain, the use of rifle, power- 
boat and skidoo also leads to a shift in cultural 
relationships and in the relationships of the 
Inuit with what they call nunavut (“our 
land”). And, because the technology comes 
from Western culture, the Inuit’s culture is 
also influenced by the methodologies and 
assumptions of Western culture. 
The case of the Inuit is relevant because 
people of “civilized” cultures are becoming 
increasingly uncasy with the results of their 
activities and are turning to so-called “primi- 
tive” cultures for wisdom to guide them. The »

wisdom they seek is largely what might be 
called selective spirituality, that is, sayings, 
prophecies and advice which can be separated 
from the traditional context in which they arise 
and which is often basic to understanding 
them. They are rarely attracted to the science, 
technology and sustainable development for 
subsistence of many of these cultures, even 
though these may be the only base for coping 
with environmental degradation. 
Western technology and management 
techniques are not only an integral part of 
market- and commodity-based culture, they 
also change every culture they come into 
contact with. Because they are part of 
Western culture which has a global system of 
production, distribution and consumption, 
they absorb, change and destroy other cul- 
tures, whether intentionally or unintention- 
ally. Even if local cultures wished to integrate 
this technology and these methods, they 
would have to be protected in order to have 
the time to absorb and adapt. But Western 
culture can only provide such protection by 
dismantling its own dominance.

The failings of a 
dominant culture 
Western technology and management tech- 
niques are successful in dealing with isolated 
parts of processes, but they are not only inad- 
equate, but actually destructive when dealing 
with whole, integrated processes. If thereis a 
market for wood products, Western tech- 
nology and management can be applied to the 
selection, planting, fertilizing, harvesting and" 
marketing of, say, Eucalyptus trees, but they 
are singularly incapable of dealing with the 
integrated system of land, trees, water, human 
subsistence, religion, art, memory, invention, 
feedback and inter-regional relationships 
which have to be modified or destroyed in 
order to satisfy market demand. 
The shadow side of the development of 
Western culture has been a scramble to 
counter-balance, modify, explain away, and, 
on occasion, replace these methods which 
were initially overwhelmingly successful but 
eventually became terribly dangerous. Envi-

Three strategic objectives have been pro- 
posed in order to cope with this degradation: 
maintenance of essential ecological processes 
and life-support systems, preservation of 
genetic diversity, and sustainable use of 
species and ecosystems. 
There is a growing interest in attempting 
to include environmental costs in the eco- 
nomics of development. These costs are 
increasingly being referred to as “externali- 
ties”, which in itself is semantically interesting 
in assessing the mindset which is developing 
them. There is even talk of the “counterpro- 
ductivities” of cconomic growth, such as the

is a Canadian consultant on the 
arts and the environment, 
“labour saving devices”. The industrial world 
has moved from efficiency experts to stress 
management experts. 
Governments in the industrialized world 
are attempting to adapt these solutions to 
their legislative and development policies. In 
Europe and North America, laws and regula- 
tions are slowly being put into place and pop- 
ular awareness 1s growing, both formally 
through curricular development at all levels 
of the educational system, and informally 
through non-governmental organizations 
dedicated to environmentalism. There is also 
a growing awareness of the global responsi- 
bilities that some industrial enterprises should 
embrace. “Being green” 1s even scen as a 
competitive advantage for industrial firms of 
the future. 
No one would wish to discourage efforts 
by Western culture to correct these prob- 
lems. Many if not most of those secking 
solutions to environmental degradation are 
motivated by genuine concern. It must be 
emphasized, however, that their solutions are 
dominant culture solutions, based on tech- 
nological and managerial applications of the 
methods and mores of that culture. Taken to 
their ultimate stage, they envisage a planet 
which is totally managed and technologically 
controlled. 
Us and them 
Let us imagine that these approaches are 
completely successful and then ask whether 
the resultant world is the world we want to 
live in. In the North America of the 1950s the 
answer might have been an cnthusiastic 
“yes”; in the world of the 1990s I think I hear 
a resounding “no”. How can we act so that 
we all can enjoy some of the benefits of tech- 
nology and management and not become 
their slaves? How can we limit the dominant 
culture before it destroys itself and everyone 
clse along with it? 
The most basic reason to be apprehensive 
about the ability of Western culture to solve 
the environmental problems it has created is 
its marked inability to include itself in the 
concept of nature. As someone once said in 
response to a request for a definition of 
“environment”, “it is everything except me”. 
The word “environment” itself explains that 
most clearly. The problems are “out there” 
and we will address them through tech- 
nology and management expertise. Coupled 
to this attitude 1s the assumption that people, »

» usually others, are part of the problem and 
that the solution lies in technology and man- 
agement, usually ours. A first step in looking 
at the entire problem that the planet faces 
might be simply to apply some of these solu- 
tions to Western culture. 
Human cultures have adapted ideas, rit- 
uals, techniques and beliefs from one another, 
and it might be argued that the success of the 
human species has been based on this char- 
acteristic ability to learn, to adapt, and to be 
open to the experience of others (even when 
at times attempting to destroy them). One of 
the most problematic issues concerning the 
future of the planet is the seeming inability of 
Western culture to understand and take seri- 
ously the experience of other cultures which 
have developed very different solutions to 
the problem of survival. 
Perhaps a first step might be to apply to 
human cultures some of the solutions being 
proposed for environmental problems. The 
destruction of human cultures is arguably 
more devastating in the long run than the 
environmental degradation of the planet, 
which can be seen as its symptom. 
Biodiversity is one area of concern to envi- 
ronmentalists today. The loss of species is 
occurring at a potentially disastrous rate. The 
triumphant “survival of the fittest” of nine- 
teenth-century science is suddenly sounding 
hollow as we begin to realize that no species 
survives by triumphing. Every survival is the 
result of a complex system of life which 
involves competition but also involves co- 
operation and dependence. And beyond that it 
involves interdependence and enormous 
diversity of plant, animal and mineral presence 
to sustain the cycles within cycles of birth, 
growth and death. The huge agro-businesses 
are finding that the one-crop approach may be 
a short-term triumph for technology and 
management, but that the long-term results 
are land degradation, displacement of peoples 
with the accompanying problems of urbaniza- 
tion and poverty, loss of species, and eventu- 
ally a curve of falling profits. 
A recipe for disaster 
Monoculture in agriculture is a recipe for dis- 
aster, but what about monoculture in human 
culture? We talk volubly about the loss of 
species and the shrinking of the gene pool in 
the environment, but what of the loss of lan- 
guages, words, thoughts, values, skills, rituals, 
relationships, knowledge, traditions, not to 
mention songs, dances, plays, adornments, 
paintings, sculpture and sounds? What of 
human diversity? It is possible that Western 
culture can through conservation, preserva- 
tion and sustainable use partially manage the 
loss of species. Is it not even more important 
that the diversity of human cultures should be 
conserved, preserved and used sustainably? 
The agro-business, to use a much discussed 
example, destroys species through the intro- 
duction of monocultures; it also destroys 
human cultures through the concomitant 
monocultural technology and management. 
Diversity is as sure a sign of success in human 
affairs as it is in the environment “out there” 
and the two are intimately related. 
It is difficult to imagine where the 
counter-balance to Western culture can come 
from if not from the cultures it has thus far 
cither pushed aside or treated as curios. 
Without a counter-balance, it is difficult to sce 
Western culture’s “solutions” doing anything 
but furthering the monoculture based on 
technology and management which have 
shown themselves inadequate to deal with 
the situations they create. The most basic 
solution will have to include local consulta- 
tion and decision-making and a cessation of 
mega-projects which destroy environment 
and human communities for the sake of 
export markets and foreign capital exigencies. 
But, beyond that level, we have to recognize 
that sustainable development is not primarily 
an cconomic/environment issue, but an issue 
of sustaining the interrelationship of human 
cultures and nature. |

UNEQUAL PARTNERS 
BY NESTOR GARCIA CANCLINI 
«The far-reaching cultural 
changes brought about by 
communication technologies 
are becoming still more 
radical through their links 
with the globalization of 
production and 
consumption.” Above, a 
young consumer from Brunei. 
n the second half of the twentieth 
century, the industrialization of the 
production of material goods, closely 
linked to the industrialization of cul- 
ture, gave rise to new concepts of 
development. The latest stages in this 
process have been the integration of the mass 
media into information superhighways and 
the integration of national cultural circuits 
into globalized systems. 
The merger of computer science and 
telecommunications, especially direct broad- 
casting by satellite and fibre optic cables, is 
enabling the “old” communication media to 
be used in new ways. Telephone, cinema, 
television and video are being brought 
together in interactive transnational systems 
which link up the networks possessed by 
these media in the most remote countries. 
These information superhighways are 
transforming scientific communication, 
office automation, banking and intercompany 
services and no doubt also the distribution of 
cultural performances. Transnational compa- 
nics programme the circulation of films, car- 
toons and news in many countries of the 
South and even in some European countries.

of cities on every continent without the lim- 
itations imposed by customs tariffs on cinema 
and video films. What is more, access to 
video games, teleshopping, national and inter- 
national news from television and personal 
computers is being widely extended. The arts 
are being incorporated into these mass media 
networks in order to expand their audience 
and obtain financing. 
As a result, the communication industries 
are among the most dynamic agents of the 
modern cconomy and constitute onc of the 
main sources of investment and employment 
opportunities. In the United States they rank 
second only to the aerospace industry as a 
source of export earnings. 
The media explosion 
The far-reaching cultural changes brought 
about by communication technologies are 
becoming still more radical through their 
links with the internationalization and global- 
ization of production and consumption, pop- 
ulation migrations and tourism. This global- 
1zing movement is throwing national cultures 
open to news, films, radio, theatre, television 
serials and other entertainment forms pro- 
duced outside the country concerned. 
Until twenty or thirty years ago, cfforts 
were made to control the challenge of these 
communication flows between societies by 
imposing time quotas for the broadcasting of 
foreign programmes in cach country. These 
controls are no longer feasible today for the 
following reasons: 
the deterritorialization of artistic production 
He unesco (Duritr BSEPTEMBER 1996 
which loosens its ties with any particular 
country; 
the existence of technological facilities which 
can circulate mass media messages 
throughout the world; 
the increasing cost of film and record pro- 
duction, which makes it hard to recoup 
investment in a single country; 
the monopolistic concentration of produc- 
tion and distribution in the hands of pow- 
erful multinational companies; 
the transnational expansion of communica- 
tions, which has weakened local traditions 
and given birth to a world folklore. Com- 
munities of consumers, especially young 
people, are defining their cultural prac- 
tices on the basis of homogenized infor- 
mation and styles which seem acceptable 
to diffcrent socictics, regardless of their 
own specific political, religious or national 
concepts. 
A system with built-in 
inequalities 
Today, all these factors are leading to radical 
changes which go beyond internationalization 
or the opening of the geographical frontiers 
of cach society to goods and messages from 
other cultures. The age of globalization is 
being interaction 
between disparate economic and cultural 
activities brought about by a multi-centred 
system in which the speed of world-wide 
transmission and strategies for winning over 
audiences completely outweigh local historic 
traditions. The fact remains, however, that 
accompanied by an 
this global reorganization of cultures does not 
eliminate inequalities or asymmetry between 
the metropolis and outlying regions. 
In Latin America, the economic recession 
of the past decade has impoverished local 
artistic production and the capacity to play a 
competitive part in international integration. 
The contraction of public budgets and the 
weakness of private enterprise, except for a 
few big multinational businesses, confront us 
with the paradox that more intensive trade is 
being promoted between the receiving coun- 
tries and the metropolises while these coun- 
tries are producing fewer books, fewer films 
and fewer records. Integration is being pro- 
moted at the very time when there are few 
cultural goods to exchange, and falling wages 
inhibit consumption by the majority of the 
population.

The situation is even more dramatic in the 
field of high technology and the information 
superhighways. The subordination of the 
Latin American countries is being accompa- 
nied by the elimination of customs tariffs on 
foreign products as a result of the conclusion 
of free trade agreements, while the few subsi- 
dies for local technological development are 
being further eroded. 
Greater cultural and scientific dependence 
on advanced communication technologies 
which require heavy financial investment and 
at the same time generate faster innovation, 
will render the marginal societies more vul- 
ncrable to transnational capital and to cultural 
trends generated outside the region. That is 
why the multicultural system and its inherent 
inequalities are typified today not only by the 
coexistence of different historical traditions 
but also by the unequal access of different 
countries, and of the different sectors of each 
society, to advanced means of transnational 
communication. 
These inequalities have given rise to new

social injustices. The broad masses are 
involved in the global culture to a limited 
extent because they only have access to the 
first stage of the audiovisual industries, i.c. to 
the entertainment and news programmes put 
out by radio and television services for which 
there is no charge. 
Some (minority) groups of the middle and 
working classes have been able to gain access 
to a second, more up-to-date and sophisti- 
cated tier of the communication media in the 
shape of cable television networks providing 
environmental and health education, political 
information on videos, and so forth. Only 
small fringes of the entreprencurial, political 
and academic clite are linked up to the more 
active forms of communication, t.e. to the 
third tier of the system, which includes the 
fax, clectronic mail, satellite dishes, and infor- 
mation and game networks ranging from 
home videos to international clectronic net- 
works of the horizontal kind. 
World folklore and 
traditional culture 
The development of policies to promote 
broad access to these second and third com- 
munication tiers is a necessary corollary to the 
development of modern democratic forms of 
citizenship which have the capacity to inter- 
vene significantly in the processes of global 
and regional integration. The multinational 
dimension of problems such as environmental 
pollution, drug trafficking, and technological 
and cultural innovation means that citizens 
need to possess information which transcends 
the local or national context. 
We know that the process of globalization 
does not spell the end of ethnic, regional and 
national cultures. The deterritorialization of 
the arts is accompanied by effective reterri- 
torialization in the form of social movements 
which place emphasis on local characteristics, 
and usc mass media techniques such as 
regional radio and television and the creation 
of micromarkets for folk music and objects. 
It is undeniable, however, that in many 
countries, national and cthnic symbols are 
ceasing to be the main references of social iden- 
tity and cohesion. The time has come to think 
of ways of establishing equitable and creative 
ties between the homogeneous transnational- 
ization of styles of information and entertain- 
ment and the aspiration of local and national cul- 
tures to survive. ||

CULTURE IN THE CITY 
BY J. MARK SCHUSTER 
8 nett td lis 
he arts and culture have long 
been associated with cites. It 
was there that people congre- 
gated to exchange ideas and 
stimulate one another’s cre- 
ativity, that the economic sur- 
plus that could support the arts was centred, 
and that an appreciative and critical audience 
was available. The symbols of Greek city cul- 
ture were the gymnasium, the sanatorium, 
and the theatre, which encouraged cultural 
interchange by travel and pilgrimage—a fore- 
runner of today’s cultural tourism. 
Good urban design 
Cities are also cultural artifacts in themselves. 
Many of them commissioned artists, architects 
and designers to embellish them and trans- 
form them into generators of the good life. 
This tradition is still very much alive. The 
commissioning of large scale public sculpture 
has become common in the world’s major 
cities, some of which have developed exten- 
sive outdoor collections, while others have 
used a single large-scale artwork to provide 
themselves with a strong image, much as Paris 
discovered it had done with the construction 
of the Eiffel Tower a century ago. 
Another old idea that has lost none of its 
allure is that of building flagship cultural facil- 
ities as visible symbols of a city’s cultural

House, the Kennedy Center in Washington, 
D. C. (U.S.A), the Ludwig Museum com- 
plex in Cologne (Germany) and the Guggen- 
heim Museum under construction in Bilbao 
(Spain) are familiar examples. The French 
government has taken the idea of building 
flagship cultural facilities to great lengths, 
developing a number of great works in Paris, 
including the Pompidou Centre, the Bastille 
Opera House, the Grand Louvre project and 
the Grande Arche to the west of the city. 
Cultural Centres 
In the late 1950s and 1960s, cultural centres 
were widely seen as a solution to the prob- 
lems of housing the arts and of providing 
access to them. They would create a critical 
mass of activity and would facilitate cross-dis- 
ciplinarity in the arts. In France, André Mal- 
raux had high hopes for his Maisons de la

Culture. They would be ©... a meeting place 
intended to bring cultural wealth of all types, 
past and present, and of the highest standards, 
to the widest possible public, with no one 
excluded.” 
Yet experience with cultural centres has 
been mixed. Many turned into retail outlets 
for cultural products produced in pre- 
existing cultural capitals. Many were builtona 
scale out of proportion to local demand. 
Above all, from an urbanistic point of view, 
there was a danger that they isolated cultural 
activities on an island. Other solutions to the 
  
  
   
geographic distribution of cultural institutions 
and activities in the city came to be adopted. 
Mixed-use developments 
Mixed-use developments in which the arts 
combined with other uses have long existed in 
many European cites. As the Britush arts 
adviser David Pratley has pointed out: “In 
Paris the commercial development of the gar- 
dens of the Palais Royal in the 1780s to create 
the shopping centre of Europe presaged the

» the twentieth century American city. In Eng- 
land theatres and assembly rooms commonly 
catered for performance, dances and dinners, 
and elaborate pleasure gardens combined 
nature and arts in the promenade, music and 
dinner. The peculiarly English combination of 
being ill and having a good time fueled the 
development of entire spa towns in Bath, 
Buxton and Cheltenham.” 
In the United States, mixed-use develop- 
ments were rediscovered both because they 
avoid the sterility of segregated uses and in 
the hope that they would improve the 
chronic financial problems of cultural institu- 
tions by providing internal cross-subsidiza- 
tion of cultural activities. Rockefeller Center 
in New York, begun in 1931, was originally 
intended to provide a home for the Metro- 
politan Opera and cross-subsidize its opera- 
tion through revenues from the building that 
was supposed to be built over it. Though this 
never happened, Radio City Music Hall, art 
galleries and theatres were built as part of the 
Rockefeller Center complex. 
Cultural districts include districts based on 
artistic resources and programmes, which 
nie unesco (Qurier SEPTEMBER 1996 
might be called “arts districts”, and districts 
based on historic resources, which might be 
called “heritage districts”. In the former the 
emphasis has been on integrating cultural 
development into the overall growth and 
development of the city rather than on iso- 
lating it in a cultural centre. In some cases, this 
has been done by preserving long-abandoned 
cultural facilities and developing the district 
around them. Occasionally, entire new cultural 
districts, such as the Dallas Arts District 
(U.S.A.) or the Antigone district in Montpel- 
lier (France), have been created as the result of 
large scale redevelopment plans. Frankfurt 
(Germany) pursued this idea with great vigour, 
building between the Museums Bank of the 
river Main and the Rémerberg, twenty-two 
museums, eighty galleries, seventeen theatres 
and four concert buildings, an unprecedented 
concentration of cultural facilities. 
Cities of culture 
A more recent idea is to expand the bound- 
aries of the cultural district to those of the city 
itself. One proposition for halting the urban

tural industries to locate there and cultural 
institutions to develop around the cultural 
infrastructure already in place. 
Another spin on the idea is the European 
Union’s European City of Culture programme. 
Originally intended to recognize those Euro- 
pean cities that had already developed an exem- 
plary public cultural life, the programme has 
gradually been turned into one that provides an 
incentive for bidding cities to improve the 
quality of their cultural offerings. Glasgow’s 
successful bid to become the European city of 
Culture in 1990 is widely regarded as a turning 
point in that city’s urban revitalization.

the Spoleto Festival (Italy), which have long 
sought to move out of the normal performing 
venues into the city itself, a new generation of 
urban festivals is growing out of local arts com- 
munities to become part of the shared life of 
the city. Over twenty years, First Night, the 
New Year’s Eve celebration in Boston, Massa- 
chusetts, has become a heavily attended cul- 
tural festival with performances by a thousand 
artists. The idea has been adopted in over 130 
cities in North America, and the International 
Alliance of First Night Celebrations is 
working to spread the idea of a New Year's 
Eve celebration of the arts and culture to cities 
around the world. 
Festivals need not be solely based on the 
performing arts. The Biennales in Bologna 
and Venice feature the visual arts, and trade 
fairs based on cultural industries bring 
another kind of cultural festival to cities, c.g., 
the Cannes Film Festival and the Frankfurt 
Book Fair. |

Pathways of Arab culture to Latin America 
The goal of ACALAPI (Contribution of Arab Culture to Ibero-American 
Cultures via Spain and Portugal) is to highlight aspects of Arab civi- 
lization that have influenced Latin America and flourished there, and to 
promote exchanges between the Arab and Latin American peoples. 
As well as studying mass migrations during the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries, the project sets out to identify elements of Arab 
culture that survived on the Iberian Peninsula and moved to Latin 
America. More specifically, the ACALAPI project emphasizes the Arab 
influence on Latin American art, particularly through Mudejar art and 
architecture; on agriculture and irrigation techniques; on plants and 
crops such as sugar, rice, citrus fruit and industrial crops; on horse 
riding, e.g. introduction of the Barbary horse; on pharmacology and 
medicine; on literature (the Arab influence on Latin American literature 
and vice versa}; on music and folklore; on language; on the mass 
media; and on education (again in both directions). The project aims 
to highlight the role of immigrants in the cultural dialogue between 
Latin America and the Arab world.

Evolution in the number of television and radio receivers in developed and International trade 
In cultural goods 
{fn 
developing countries 
Despite persistent inequalities, it is in the audio-visual field that the North-South gap is 
shrinking the fastest. In 1970 figures show 259 television sets for 1,000 inhabitants in 
developed countries against 10 in developing countries, or a ratio approximating 1 to 26. 
The respective higures for radio receivers were 618 and 45, or a ratio of 1 te 13. Some twenty 
years later, in 1992, the ratio for radios had hardly changed while for television sets, it had 
narrowed to slightly more than 1 to 8. 
Radio remains the privileged means of communication in rural areas. Its further growth 
is hampered by the cost of receivers and above all, of buying new batteries. The increase in 
the number of televisions has gone hand in hand with urbanization. But while the number of 
sets has shot up in the Third World, dependence on programmes produced in the North 
remains very strong.

Integrated rural development 
in the Sahel 
In the Sahel region of Africa the cycle of environmental deteri- 
oration is rapid, and is accompanied by human misery as tradi- 
tional lifestyles disintegrate. 
Unesco and its regional counterpart, the Institut du Sahel, 
have launched two projects. One aims at improving methods of 
animal husbandry, and the other is designed to strengthen sci- 
entific capacity in agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry. 
The projects involve the nine Member States of CILSS 
(Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the 
Sahel)—Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, 
Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Chad—and have helped to 
promote an ecological approach to rural development in these 
countries, by stressing the need to adapt training and 
research programmes to local socio-economic and cultural 
conditions. =

RETHINKING DEVELOPMENT 
The United Nations launched a World Decade for Cultural Development (1988- 
1997) with UNESCO as the lead agency, but covering the entire United Nations 
system. 
The Decade has four aims: 
acknowledging the cultural dimension in development; 
asserting and enhancing cultural identities; 
broadening participation in cultural life; 
promoting international cultural co-operation. 
The Decade’s action plan is based on two definitions adopted by the World 
Conference on Cultural Policies which was held in Mexico City in 1982. The first of 
these states that “Culture comprises the whole complex of distinctive spiritual, 
material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a society or social 
group. It includes not only the arts and letters, but also modes of life, the funda- 
mental rights of the human being, value systems, traditions and beliefs.” In other 
words, development is a cultural process that cannot be imposed from outside or 
presented as a gift from benevolent development agencies, but must be generated 
from within each society itself. 
According to the second definition adopted in Mexico City, development is “a 
complex, comprehensive and multidimensional process which extends beyond 
mere economic growth to incorporate all dimensions of life and all the energies of 
a community, all of whose members are called upon to make a contribution and 
expect to share in the benefits.” 
Research, pilot projects and the design of appropriate methods and tools have 
been one part of the Decade’ work. Another has been the sensitizing of decision- 
makers and world leaders to the importance of incorporating cultural considera- 
tions into development strategies. It is for this purpose that the World Commis- 
sion on Culture and Development was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Javier 
Pérez de Cuéllar, former Sccretary-General of the United Nations. | 
The World Commission on Culture and Development (1993-1995) 
Its inception 
UNESCO, in conjunction with the United Nations, established the World 
Commission on Culture and Development at the ¢nd of 1992. Com- 
posed of 12 leading figures from various backgrounds, including four 
Nobel Prize winners, and chaired by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, former 
U. N. Secretary-General, this independent Commission was entrusted 
with preparing the first-ever action-oriented World Report on the close 
ties between culture and development. The main objective of this doc- 
ument, entitled Our Creative Diversity, is to shape the national cultural 
and development strategies of the twenty-first century.

### 104461: Living in tomorrow's cities

BEC ommentary 
  THE unesco (QURIER BSLPTEMBER 1996 
Federico Mayor 
What will tomorrow’s cities be like? Above all, will they be 
decent places to live in? 
The city is a foens of far-reaching changes in our time. 
By the year 2025, an estimated 83 per cent of the popu- 
lation of the industrialized countries and 61 per cent of the 
population of the South will be living in urban areas, But 
while cities are focal points of progress and social change, 
they are also crucibles of crisis and social tensions. 
Urbanization is taking place on three levels: in mega- 
cities, in medinm-sized cities and in inter-nrhan areas. 
Megaeities, cities witht more than 4 or 5 million inhabi- 
tants, are not specific to the industrialized countries. By 
2025 18 of the world’s 25 largest cities are likely to he sit- 
uated in the South. As great centres of international com- 
munication and exchange, these “global cities” form part 
of an emerging new world map which increasingly ignores 
the North-South divide between industrialized and devel- 
oping countries. 
Medium-sized eities with a population ranging from 
100,000 to 2 or 3 million are autonomous from and sub- 
ordinate to the megacities. They give structure to rural 
areas and connect them with the urban world. Develop- 
ments of this kind in Asia and Latin America are the 
world’s fastest-growing urban areas, facing management 
problems eomparable to those of large metropolises. 
Thirdly, the networks of exchange that link these cities 
form a global urban framework within which the labour 
foree is being redistributed and large-scale population 
movements are taking place. 
While cities are places of dynamisin, innovation and 
opportunity, they also harbour poverty, violence, pollution, 
unemployment, social exclusion, criminality, insecurity, 
drugs and squalor. The problem of urban poverty is today 
being discussed in terms (exclusion in France, underclass 
in the United States, marginalidad in Latin Ameriea) which 
reflect three different representations of urban space— 
inside/outside, high/low and centre/periphery. 
Cities for citizens 
The city is thus a meeting-point of three crises: a crisis 
provoked by cleavages in society linked to social and eco- 
nomic injustice; a crisis affecting the types of social rela- 
tions traditionally associated with the urban habitat; and a 
erisis of governance and political representation. 
Although no two cities are alike, nrban development 
must follow one common guideline. The city and the 
economy must be made to serve humankind, and not the 
reverse, as is the case at present.

### 104461: Living in tomorrow's cities

The enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms pre- 
supposes the exercise of citizenship and participation in 
the life of the community. The right to housing, the right to 
a roof overhead for onesell and one’s family, is a prereq- 
uisite for citizenship. UNESCO therefore has a duty to 
remind the international community that the International 
Covenant on Economie, Social and Cultural Rights 
requires that “appropriate steps to ensure the realization 
of this right” be taken. 
Natural resources should be effectively managed in 
big cities, but at present these are places where water and 
energy are squandered. Cities also swallow up increasing 
amounts of land as they continue to expand over arable 
areas and green spaces. The expansion of coastal cities 
even affects the marine environment. In the last quarter of 
a eentury the population of New York City has risen by 5 
per cent, but the area it eovers has increased by 61 per 
cent. Measures must be taken to ensure that activities to 
protect the nrban environment become a source of income 
and enable the people who live in cities to take charge of 
running them. 
In many eases the management structures of large cities 
are inconsistent with their demographic development. 
UNESCO supports the introduction of urban governance 
strnctures that clearly delineate the respective areas of 
jurisdiction and responsibility of central and local author- 
ities. But it should not be forgotten that democratie and 
effective urban governance is based on the participation of 
city-dwellers and citizens’ organizations in the life of their 
community. 
An open-ended heritage 
Three main challenges face the cities of the twenty-first 
century. The first is the introduction of democracy and 
the creation of an urban community to whieh all citizens 
belong; the second is the control of urban development 
and hence the governance of cities; and the third is the 
development and control of urban engineering, especially 
during the current transition to a renewed sense of public 
interest and to flexible negotiating procedures between 
public bodies and private individuals. 
Urban development has the potential to promote social 
progress, improved access to information, education and 
health, and the enrichment of ways of life and cultural 
exchanges. But this calls for equality of aecess to the 
city—to its physical infrastructure, to education facilities 
and employment. UNESCO intends to work towards this end 
on two fronts: knowledge generation and action in the 
field. 
The eity is an essential ink between the individual and 
the state. Just as local democracy and citizenship are the 
cornerstones of the city as a moral edifice, social apartheid 
is a sign of its degeneraey. Citizenship must be rooted in a 
sense of solidarity arising from an urban eulture that is 
neither a standardized international culture nor a pateh- 
work of antagonistic cultures hut the outgrowth of a sense 
of place and membership of a great urban community. 
The city is an open-ended heritage and each city has its 
own cultural personality. Modern building materials, 
which bring improvements in terms of space-saving, health 
and safety, are often at odds with aesthetic and climatic 
considerations in the conntries where they are nsed. Sei- 
ence and the arts must be harnessed to serve the eity via 
an interdisciplinary approach that encourages the emer- 
sence of a new generation of builders. The architecture of 
the twenty-first century will have to strike a difficult hal- 
ance between modern energy-saving technology and aes- 
thetie traditions which exist in their own right and which it 
would be wrong to ignore. 
Training for city-dwellers 
This kind of strategic urbanism must be seen in terms of 
sustainable urban development. The use of durable mate- 
rials that are consistent with sound management of the 
environment must be encouraged. Water, which is indis- 
pensable for hygiene, is being wasted at such a rate that it 
is bound to be a major international issue in the coming 
century, if it is not one already. Cities are heavy consumers 
of energy, and will have to find new renewable and less 
polluting energy sources. World energy demand, which is 
expected to double in the next thirty years, will have an 
incalculable effect on raw material reserves and on the 
environment. 
As a place where people live aud move and have their 
being, the eity must provide equal aceess to the modern 
communications and information media, In this way 
everyone will have an opportunity to participate in the life 
of the community and of the world. If tomorrow’s city 
dwellers are to he well adapted to their urban environ- 
ment, they will have to learn as early as possible to con- 
sider the city as a living environment, to feel self-respect 
and respect [or others. 
UNESCO has developed an approach to these problems 
which has three complementary components—under- 
standing, action, and information—and has ercated a 
number of programmes to implement this threefold 
strategy, The Management of Secial Transformations 
(MOST) Programme, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) 
Programme, the International ITydrological Programme 
(ITIP), aud the International Geological Correlation I’ro- 
sramne (IGCP) all aim to increase and disseminate knowl- 
edge. Secondly, a number of training schemes for those 
concerned with urban issues are built into the MAB and 
MOST programmes. They include sehemes supported by 
non-governmental organizations in many parts of the world 
for restoring historic buildings, rehabilitating urban cen- 
tres, and promoting vernacular architecture and enviren- 
mental and population education. Finally, sinee knowl- 
edge and expertise are only useful if they are shared, 
UNESCO has developed a clearing house for information- 
exchange and a data bank as part of the MOST pro- 
aramme. UNESCO is also pursuing a communication policy 
designed to help town-planners, officials, educators, jour- 
nalists and civic organizations to strengthen solidarity, tol- 
erance, respect for enltural diversity and the culture of 
peace—in a word, everything that can form a common 
bond between men and women everywhere. |

the founder of their city, Tacay-

the “Pata” constellation, which is 
known to us as Orion.

come {rom Paramonga, a war-torn 
area on the furthermost reaches of 
the kingdom. They bear bad tid- 
ings. The fortresses that were 
holding back the advancing Incas 
have been falling one after another. 
Disaster looms unless major rein- 
foreements are sent immediately. 
They know the city is not far 
away now, but they have been 
travelling along the shore for 
nearly three days with hardly any 
steep. The following day they are 
to appear before their lord, Min- 
chancaman (the Chimo-Capae). In 
order to present him with a clear 
report of the situation, they first 
need some rest. They walk into 
the dunes and, covering them- 
selves with their light coats, lie 
down on a bed of warm sand. 
They sleep fitfully. Their 
dreams are haunted by the same 
images—their aproaching fate, 
the end of time, the eollapse of 
everything that has made their 
lives what they are. They belong 
to different social classes but 
have been friends since child- 
hood. Alentec is a nobleman, 
while Malakan is of humble 
origin, though he comes from a 
family of artists—which in a sense 
makes him a nobleman: no one has 
ohjeeted to the pledges of love he 
has exehanged with Tsel, his 
friend’s young sister. 
All this, and their whole world, 
is now in mortal danger. The terri- 
fyingly efficient army of the Inea 
Pachacttec has been taking strong- 
holds and cities in the south one 
alter the other, and also threatens 
to swoop down on the kingdom 
from the east. These are the tidings 
they are bringing home: that the 
lords of Cuzco have enough troops 
and weapons to bring down for good 
the proud Chima Empire, which 
has refused to hand over its riehes 
and is preventing them from 
invading its vast and prosperous 
coastal lands. 
The Great Chimi Empire had 
slowly grown up around the eity in 
the Moche valley where Tacay- 
namo, founder of the city and the 
kingdom, had arrived centuries ear- 
lier. Ile did not arrive alone: noble 
warriors and other personages 
accompanied him on great rafts. 
They found a land devastated by 
war and the ruins of the dying 
Mochica kingdom, which had 
known greatness eenturies earlier. 
Now the Quechua of Cuzeo were 
about to scize the eountry, just as 
Tacaynamo had done in his time; 
and the Chim, if they survived, 
would have to wait upon and pay 
tribute to a sovereign other than 
Minchancaman. 
The great prince Minchan- 
eaman, a descendant of Tacaynamo 
and, like him, a son of the stars and 
the sea, has brought the kingdom

» power, the Great Chima Empire 
now stretches from Paranionga and 
Huarmey in the south to Tumbes 
and Guayaquil in the north. The 
cities and minor lordships pay 
tribute to the great prince. Their 
finest children and artists live in the 
capital. Depending on their origins 
and the art they practise, they 
inhabit a district in the ten 
“eitadels” (or palaces) which, elus- 
tering together like an enormous 
beehive, make up Chan Chin. 
“It has always been so, and 
maybe it will always be so as long 
as time continues on its course, driv- 
ing the clouds, the river waters and 
the sea,” says Malakin. And his 
friend replies: “if Suari, the old 
woman who sells delicious chicha 
(maize beer) at the market in the 
gardeners’ quarter is to be 
believed, it has heen prophesied 
that within one or two generations

[or they will belch fire. They will 
arrive in huge ships; they will 
defeat and subjugate all the peo- 
ples in this part of the world, 
including the proud imhabitants of 
Cuzco.” “If that is true,” says the 
potter, “and if the Incas enter the

then our descendants will ally 
themselves with these new gods and 
we shall again he free and masters 
of our land.” “We shall help them

adds. “But the vanquished have no 
rights before the victors, They owe 
them submission.” 
A world on the march 
With alarm, Alentee and Malakin 
see in their dreams all the cities 
they have known, with their tem- 
ples and their fortresses. They can 
feel themselves becoming children 
again, racing one sunny afternoon 
througli Chan Chan’s 
streets and up and down its steps, 
beneath the city’s trapezoid walls, 
which ave as high as five ov six tall 
men. They know every nook and 
cranny of its rectangular citadels, 
of the walls marking the dividing 
line between the fishermen in the 
narrow 
north and the farmers in the south, 
between the potters and the brass- 
founders. The capital has only one 
entrance gate, giving straight onto 
its narrow streets. This makes it 
easier not only to control the popu- 
lation but to defend the city: even 
the most seasoned troops will find 
they have fallen inextricably into a 
trap if they try to invade Chan 
Chan. Alentee thinks: “This 
defence system should safeguard 
our future.” Bunt his {riend, as 
though reading his thoughts, 
retorts: “Think again. We are 
already being devoured from 
within, just as the sweet, fleshy,

same black colour as those of his 
fellow potters, but they bear the 
stantp of his personality and tem- 
perament. The neck of one of the 
jugs represents the head and head- 
dress of a male figure solemnly 
making love to a woman. Children 
burst into laughter because they 
think the figures portray the 
potter’s neighbours. Ilis pots, on 
the other hand, are a natural red- 
dish colour obtained by oxidization. 
Malakan also uses these techniques, 
but there is nothing light-hearted 
about his version of realism, and his 
sculptural compositions amaze both 
connoisseurs and laymen with the 
way they describe the joys and sor- 
rows of Clnmil nen and women, not 
forgetting the animals that are their 
faithful companions. 
The two men then enter a 
temple while a religious ceremony 
is being celebrated and look in 
amazement at the finery of the 
dignitaries as they file before the 
high priest. The highly sophisti- 
cated art of the Chima gold- 
smiths is abundantly evident in 
the gold and silver used for wor- 
ship, and in the masks, breast- 
plates and braeelets worn by the 
nobility. The officiating priest 
raises above his head a huge gold 
tumi (ceremonial knife), with 
turquoise inlays and a handle rep- 
resenting the divine figure of the 
founding father. The knife is half 
as high as a man and so heavy that 
the priest finds it difficult to hold 
aloft. The Chimo-Capac wears a 
gold mask and gauntlets, as well 
as a diadem with pendant fig- 
urines that probably tell a story. 
He is [ollowed by a procession of 
men and women wearing lead- 
bands decorated with feathers. 
Their faces and clothes are cov- 
ered with gold and precious 
stones: small discs, nose orna- 
ments, earrings, rings, pearl neck- 
laces and gold chains decorated 
with human or animal figurines. 
Alentec and Malakdn are 
excited by the brilliance of all this 
gold and jewelry—Dut in fact it is 
the fire of the rising sun that rouses 
them from their slumbers. The 
sun’s rays will soon strike the bas- 
reliefs and stuccoed paintings in 
Minchaneamin’s Palace. The two 
men look for the waters of the hnge 
canal which has enabled the engi- 
neers of the Great Chimii Empire 
to enlarge the Moche Valley and 
tnrn it into a vast orchard. After 
washing themselves and taking a 
few sips of water, they return to 
the road that will lead them to the 
palace. Their news is not good, hut 
it is a magnificent day and what dis- 
turbed their sleep was perhaps no 
more than a bad dream. There 
might still he a way out, a road to 
salvation they do not know about, 
but which the Chimo-Cipac docs. 
In an hour’s time they will be 
before him. They shout out to 
announee their arrival, and sentries 
answer them from the top of the 
city walls, They ean hear the sound 
of voices and dogs barking. As soon 
as they pass through the palace 
door, members of the sovereign’s 
household will run up to weleome 
them in the main courtyard. 
Ilistory is certainly waiting for

door—in that very courtyard

CHAN CHAN IN BRIEF 
The great pre-Inca metropolis of Chan Chén is 
located on the right bank of the Moche 5 km from 
the town of Trujillo, on the road that leads to the 
port of Huanchaco in northern Peru (La Libertad 
department). It has been on Unesco’s World her- 
itage List since 1986. 
Chan Chan, which was the capital of the Great 
Chimd Empire, is the largest pre-Hispanic city in 
Latin America: it extends overan area of 20 km? and 
had about 35,000 inhabitants. 
According to legend, the city was founded 
in the 11th or 12th century by a mysterious figure 
who arrived by sea—as in the case of other peo- 
ples and nations of Latin America. 
The Spanish conquistadors and their chron- 
iclers—Father Cabello de Balboa in about 1586, 
and Carlos Marcelo Corne between 1604 and 1610, 
collected legends that evoked its past splendour. 
Archaeological evidence sugests that the Chimd 
civilization succeeded the Mochica culture in 
about 1200, on the very spot where that culture 
had developed since the 4th century. 
At the height of the Great Chim( Empire, the 
Moche Valley (or the Santa Catalina Valley) became 
the nerve centre of a vast empire. A highly sophis- 
ticated irrigation system diverted the river waters 
along a canal about 80 km long and watered the 
arid region around Chan Chan, rendering it fertile 
to a degree that is difficult to imagine today. ll

Straddling the borderline between 
the United States and Mexico, the 
Sonoran Desert stretches on the 
American side from California to 
Arizona and on the Mexican from 
Baja California to the state of 
Sonora. It is home to the world’s 
largest cactus, sncenlents and a 
profusion of bushes, not to mention 
numerous species of birds, inscets 
and mammals. It ean get so hot and 
it rains so Little that the first mis- 
stonaries to set foot in the area 
likened it to Ilell. From the plant 
and wildlife point of view it is one 
of the ricliest deserts in the world 
and has been lived in by humans for 
more than 12,000 years. 
On the northern side of the 
border, the Organ Pipe Cactus 
National Monument (ORPI) was 
proclaimed a national monument in 
1937, then a Unesco Biosphere

by scientists and administrators 
from the two conntries, who on the 
same occasion created the Interna- 
tional Sonoran Desert Alliance 
(ISDA) in order to maintain an on- 
going dialogue between Mexicans, 
Americans and Tolono O’odham 
Native Americans, and to integrate 
conservation, rescarch, edncation 
and sustainable development. 
Organ Pipe Cactus National 
Monument 
The most spectacular part of the 
Sonoran Desert and the most typical 
of its ccosystem is probably the 
Organ Pipe Cactus National Monu- 
which 134,000 
heetares on the American side of the 
ment, covers 
border. Despite the aridity of the cli- 
mate (an average of 23 em of spo- 
radic rain a year) and summer tem- 
peratures nudging 60° Celsius, 574 
of the 730 vascular plant species (or 
tracheophyta) in the desert are 
found there; and more than 90 per 
cent of these are endemic. The most 
impressive plants are the giant 
saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), which 
has become the symbol of the area, 
and the Organ Pipe Cactus (Steno- 
cereus thurberi). The commonest 
tree is the palo verde (Cercidinm 
microphyllum) that blooms with 
small yellow flowers in the spring. 
There is also an abundance of jojoba 
(Simmondsia chinensis), agave 
(Agave deserti) and one-sced juniper 
(Juniperus monosperma). 
by France Bequette 
There is also a wide variety ol 
wildlife: 55 species of mammals, four 
species of amphibians, 43 species of 
snakes, 260 bird species and even one 
species of fish, the desert pupfish 
(Cyprinodon macularius eremus), 
that is unique to the United States. 
It may well seem strange to talk of 
lish and the desert in the same 
breath, bnt ORPL eontains 11 
springs, three of which are pevennial. 
The largest is Quitohaquito which 
discharges nearly 130 litres per 
minute and sustains a pond and a 
green oasis. ltwas a vital staging-post 
for travelers 400 years ago as they 
passed along the Camino del Diablo 
on their way from Mexico to Cali- 
fornia in search of gold and other 
minerals. It was already a eross-roads 
at the time of the HHohokam culture 
between 300 B.C. and 14100 A.D. 
But intensive agricultural devel- 
opment and urbanization in the 
neighbouring Mexican state of 
Sonora, especially since the installa- 
tion of a high-voltage powerline at 
Hermosillo, are posing serious proh- 
lems for ORPL. Over 200 wells 
pump 5,300 litres of water per 
minute from the groundwater of the 
Sonoyta River basin, i.e. two and a 
half replenishment 
capacity. Aerial spraying of crops 
times its 
and the introduction of cnltivated 
exotic plants are added threats to 
the park’s natural resources. On the 
Awerican side unchecked irrigation 
has already caused the salination of 
200,000 hectares of land. 
ORPT is bordered on the west 
by the Cabeza Prieta National 
Wildlife Refuge, which was created 
in 1939 to protect the Desert 
Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis 
mexicana) and the Sonoran Prong- 
horn Antelope (Antilocapra ameri- 
cana sonoriensis). In 1912, how-

ever, its 348,000 hectares became 
the second largest artillery range in 
the United States, now called the 
Barry M. Goldwater Air Foree 
Range. The U.S. Air Foree and Navy 
carry out air-to-air target practice all 
year long, and the ground is littered 
with unexploded deviees and debris. 
Low-altitude flying by supersonie jet 
fighters frightens the animals, but 
experts admit that the refuge’s envi- 
ronment is generally in exeellent 
shape because access to itis severely 
restricted. 
A study by Jennifer Jenkins of 
the Yale School of Forestry and Envi- 
ronmental Studies points up what 
she calls the “inconsistencies” of the 
refuge system. On the one hand 
refuges exist to proteet biodiversity; 
on the other, they have to receive 
more and more tourists, hunters, and 
oil and mineral prospectors, and at 
the same time withstand the conse- 
quences of the intensive farming of 
neighbouring lands: pesticide run-off 
and abstraction of groundwater sup- 
plies. A reform that would resolve 
these contradictions is underway. 
The cinders of hell 
The nature of Mexico's Pinacate 
and Gran Desierto Reserve is quite 
different. Essentially volcanic, the 
terrainin its northern sector resem- 
bles the moon's surface so strongly 
that American astronauts have 
trained there. There are more than 
400 cinder eones, ten giant craters 
(more like meteor impact areas 
than volcano craters), lava flows and 
gently sculpted sand dunes that 
contrast sharply with the jagged sil- 
houctte of the mountains. There 
are more than 560 vascular plant 
species, 56 species of mammals 
(including the pronghorn), 43 
species of reptiles, 222 bird 
speeies and 4 species of fish. Tem- 
peratures range between -30°Cel- 
sins and +50°Celsius. 
The reserve is managed by 26- 
year-old Isabel Granillo, a gradnate 
in ecology. Unlike her Ameriean 
counterparts, Isabel does not pack 
a gun. And yet the reserve attracts 
drug traffickers who nse the flat- 
lands as a runway for their small 
planes whose cargo is intended for 
the United States, some 50 kilo- 
metres away. “I'm not here on a 
crime-prevention mission,” she 
explains. “All I ean do is call the 
police. I'm here to inform the 
public.” With the help of eight 
young rangers, one of whom is an 
0’odham, she eriss-crosses the 
reserve telling visitors not to leave 
the beaten track, hunt, light fires, 
leave litter or take anything away. 
Anyone is liable to make a chance

of primitive tools, campsites near 
watering holes (tinajas) and huge 
fignres etehed into the voleanie soil 
provide evidence that the area has 
been inhabited hy humans for more 
than 12,000 years. 
The eastern section of the Alto 
Golfo Reserve is composed of two 
cove arcas: the Sierra del Pinacate 
(228,000 heetares) and the Sierra 
del Rosario (42,000 hectares), 
whieh are surrounded by a buffer 
zone of 445,000 hectares. Isabel's 
task is complicated by the fact 
that the larger of the two core 
areas is in the hands of small 
landowners (ejideros) whose herds 
compete with wild animals for the 
meagre grazing lands and for 
watering holes that are few and far 
between. The area’s 200 inhabi- 
tants live in tiny hamlets, work on

Shrinking wetlands 
Further west, aronnd the Sea of 
Cortez, another core area consists of 
165,000 heetarcs that are part 
desert and part wetland formed by 
the delta of the Colorado River. But 
a huge dam on the United States side 
of the border siphons off so much 
river water for local agriculinral 
needs that the wetlands, located in 
Mexico, are shrinking steadily. By the 
time the Colorado empties into the 
Sea of Cortez, it is a mere muddy, 
over-salted trickle. 
José Campoy and his wife 
Martha Roman Rodriguez, two 
biologists who have recently been 
assigned to manage the reserve, 
have begun hy building a reception 
centre, dwellings and research 
faeilities. Their jo will not be 
easy, for they will have to deal with 
the conlliets created by the facts 
of local economic life. Shrimp 
fishing, for example, has been 
banned from April to September, 
and fishing for eertain speeies such 
as the totoaba (Totoaba mac- 
donaldi) and marine mammals such 
as the vaquita dolphin is prohib- 
ited in the Sea of Cortez. Talks are 
being held with Mexican shrimp 
fishermen in an attempt to per- 
snade them to convert to the {ledg- 
ling ecotourism industry. But dia- 
logue is impossible with the drug 
traffickers who dump into the Col- 
orado River erates of drugs 
marked with eyanide-based fhio- 
rescent paint that can be seen at 
night hy their accompliees. Pollu- 
tion of the Colorado River is a 
major problem, and some biologists 
believe that damage to the estuary 
is now irreversible. 
A grassroots movement 
One question that arises, in addition 
to problems of legal definitions and 
administrative boundaries, is what 
eoneeption do the locals have of a 
Biosphere Reserve? Joaquin Mur- 
rieta Saldivar, a Mexican studying in 
Arizona, has written his doctoral 
thesis on this subject. The notion of 
development that benefits everyone 
seems hard to grasp by those who 
ask: “What's in it for me, right now?

To avoid friction, selentists, deei- 
sion-makers and loeals must see eye 
to eye so that no one group’s inter- 
ests take precedence over the others. 
With help from the International 
Sonoran Desert Alliance (ISDA), dia- 
logue has already produeed results 
and some population groups have 
reacted positively. The Tolono 
O'odham, for example, have built 
sone small dikes to capture rain- 
water rnn-off and combat erosion. It 
shonld be said that Anthony Ramon, 
the President of the Alliance, is a 
Tohono O'odham chief. 
The Alliance encounters many 
administrative roadbloeks—not least 
the problem of erossing the border— 
but its monthly meetings (which are 
conducted in both English and 
Spanish) demonstrate its determina- 
tion to include the Biospheres of 
Alto Golfo, ORPI and the Cabeza 
Prieta Refuge in one huge Biosphere 
Reserve. With the core areas already 
determined, the only things left to 
define are the buffer zones and the 
transition areas, 
Harold Smith, an ORPE super- 
intendent for the past fourteen 
years, is optimistie, “We've shaken 
up the general apathy,” he says.

THE RISING URBAN 
TIDE 
Areport from the U. S.-based World 
Resources Institute predicts that hy 
the year 2015 the world will contain 
33 megacities with more than § mil- 
lion inhabitants and more than 500 
cities with at least one million. The 
population of cities in developing 
countries is growing by more than’ 
150,000 people per day, and by the 
year 2000 the area of these cities 
will have donhled since 1980. In the 
near future a majority of the world’s 
population will be dwelling in eities, 
exerting phenomenal pressure on the 
planet’s resources and equilibrium. 
The report, which contains many 
more statistics, is published by the 
World Bank in 7 languages and is 
available worldwide.

VOTERS TARGETED 
IN HUNTING LAW POLL 
Should bears, pumas and lynxes be 
hunted with dogs or bait? Ts it right 
to hunt wolves from a helicopter? 
Should traps be allowed? Seveu of 
the U.S.A.’s 50 states will go to the 
polls next November to vote for or 
against certain hunting practices. 
Supporters of liunting see these ref- 
ercnda as a way of prohibiting the 
use of a natural resource, whereas 
animal lovers see them as a way of 
halting cruelty to animals. Ecological 
or ethical questions apart, however, 
the stakes in the vote arc also polit- 
ical. 1s it a step towards replacing the 
legislator by referenda on certain 
issues? | 
GREENFREEZE 
When the role of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) became known as one of the 
agents depleting the ozone layer, sei- 
eutists began looking for substitutes. 
Unfortunately none of the CFC sub- 
stitutes developed proved completely 
inoffensive until two scientists in Ger- 
many developed a mix of propane and 
butane. Named “Greeufreeze” in a 
Greenpeace promotional campaign in 
1992, the new blend caught on with

WHEN MOTH STINGS BEAR 
In some parts of North America, the voracious appetite of the 
gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), is contributing to the decline of 
the black bear (Ursus americanus). The larvae of the moth, 
which was introduced into North America around 1869, devour 
the leaves of trees and can kill weaker, hollow specimens. To 
assess the impact of this moveable feast on the bear population 
of the Shenandoah National Park (Virginia), American 
researchers fitted out 54 bears with radio collars. Results of the 
study show that in this neck of the woods, deprived of the acorns 
they depend on and the hollow trees they use for dens, the black 
bear is on the decline.

IN EUROPE 
The Foundation for Environ- 
mental Education in Europe 
(FEEE) was sct up in 1981 by a 
gronp of experts {rom the 
Council of Europe. Headquar- 
tered in Copenhagen (Denmark), 
with offices in each of the 
nations, Council's member 
FEEE sponsors education and 
awareness-raising programmes. 
It has three major action pro- 
grammes: “Young reporters for 
the Environment” gives high 
school students a chance to 
rescarch topics connected with 
the environment, in their own 
countries and elsewhere, and to 
exchange their findings via e- 
mail; the “Eco-sehools™ pro- 
gramme encourages schools to 
reorganize their own manage- 
ment in order to save resources 
and go “green”; last but not

   A LAKE THAT RUNNETH OVER 
Lake Van (3,500 km2) in eastern Turkey, is the country’s largest 
lake. Tn 1968 its water level suddenly rose by 1.2 metres, and 
again in T1988. A new rise in 1995 caused flooding at the local 
airport, railway station, school and military hase. In the last 27 
years the water level has risen by 2.7 metres. A 50-page report 
by geologists, cartographers and meteorological engineers sug- 
gests that heavy rains may have caused a drop in the average air 
temperature and a decrease in evaporation. Not everyone agrees 
with this explanation, however. Some have even gone so far as to 
suggest that a denizen of the lake may be a cousin of Nessie, the 
legendary Loch Ness monster. 
 
 
THE PANTANAL: 
A WETLAND UNDER THREAT 
The estnary of the Paragnay River (“Pantanal™ in Portuguese, 
“swamp”) in southwestern Brazil is the world’s largest wetland. 
With 658 bird species, some 1,100 butterfly species, more than 
400 species of fish and numerous mammals, it is also one of the 
planet’s richest sanctuaries of biodiversity. But this exceptional 
area is being threatened with irreparable damage as a result of 
a proposal to straighten the course of the Paraguay to facilitate 
river transport of farm products and minerals to deep-water ports 
in Uruguay and Argentina. Dredging would cause erosion, and 
the river would flow faster, bringing the threat of disastrous sca- 
sonal flooding. Even so, river transport may be less harmful to 
the environment than a road or rail system.

### 104470: Isabelle Leymarie talks to Doudou N'Diaye Rose

DOUDOU 
N'DIAYE ROSE 
Praise-singer, musician, and living repository of oral 
history, the griot is an important figure in West Africa. 
Doudou N'Diaye Rose, chief drum major in Dakar, is the 
most famous living Senegalese griot. He has revolu- 
tionized the language of drums and spent many years 
touring the world with his talented troupe. 
HM How did your parents react 
when they found out you loved 
music? 
Doudou N’Diaye Rose: Very 
badly te start with. My great- 
erandfathers, whom [I never 
kuew, were musicians. But 
alter them no one in my family 
had played musie profession- 
ally. Several of my relations 
were intellectoals. My father 
worked as a chartered accoun- 
tant and had been a builder. 
When I was about nine years 
old my urge to play drums 
became irresistible. I went all 
round Dakar in search of a 
suitable teacher. In the end I 
chose El Iladj Mada Seck, 
who was a drum major. I spent 
my whole childhood with him. 
HM How did he teach you? 
D.N’D. R.: Ile got us to come 
round to his house. Ile 
explained the meaning of 
rhythms and demonstrated 
them on the drums. Ile let us 
choose an instrument, then 
asked us why we had chosen 
it. In traditional Wolof music, 
you have to be able to play 
every kind of drum. First yon 
learn how to play the gorong,

then after a few months you go 
on to another, then another. 
We did little jobs for our 
teacher in exchange for 
lessons. When he went to play 
at a baptism or a wedding, we 
pupils wonld take his drums 
along. Ile only turned up at 
the last minute. We also 
helped him make his musical 
instruments. Very early on I 
began to go to various kinds of 
ceremonies with more experi- 
enced musicians, and as they 
thought I was talented they 
let me play. 
The study of percussion 
instruments involves a great 
deal of work, and I had to 
practise alone. The trouble 
was, my maternal unele for- 
bade me to practise. When- 
ever he found out I’d played 
truant in order to devote my 
time to music he gave me a 
good spanking. My teacher 
eame to talk to him and putin 
a good werd for me. My family 
also pleaded with him to be 
more indulgent, but for years 
lie kept on beating me—and 
he was a big man! We finally 
came to a compromise, | 
attended school regularly and 
in return [was allowed to play 
at weekends. I ended up 
taking my school certificate, 
then I went to technical col- 
lege. For some years 1 even

HM Were you paid when you took 
partin ceremonies? 
D. N'D. R.: Yes, and I took 
the money back to my family. 
Even then, they didn’t want to 
know. It went on like that until 
one day, when I was nincteen, 
my uncle came to give me yet 
another spanking and I stuck 
up for myself, It has to be said 
that by then everyone was 
already talking about me as a 
musician. My teacher some- 
times accepted two engage- 
ments and passed one of them 
on to me. [ was invited all over 
the country. In the end, when 
my uncle realized how sue- 
cessful Iwas, he felt ashamed 
and apologized to me. By the 
time he died he had com- 
pletely redeemed himself. Ile 
protected me with his lueky 
charms and became my body- 
guard. 1 paid for him to go on 
a pilgrimage to Mecca.

international career? 
D. ND. R.: When [ was 
twenty-five, my teacher went 
to live in Cote dIvoire, leaving 
me his musicians and his 
instruments. | became a chief 
drum major and played with 
the group until I was thirty. 
Two years later, I decided | 
wanted to learn Senegal’s var- 
ions traditional rhythms and 
their meaning, so travelled all 
over the country, spending 
about three months in each 
region. I would approach the 
elders, bringing them rice, 
sugar, candles and other gifts 
in exchange for their teaching. 
I learned how news had been 
announced with drums in 
Senegal’s ancient kingdoms. 
The kings had their own per- 
cussion groups, and the leader 
of the lamp drums, who was 
knewn as the fara lamp, 
passed on the king’s messages 
to the people. Each instru- 
ment had a well-defined role. 
A drum called khin was 
widely used at court. It is now 
used by a Murid sect for 
Muslim eeremonies. 1 also dis- 
covered a very old sqgnare 
drum mounted on a frame, the

assiko, which comes from the 
island of Gorée. 
HM Asimilar drum has been found 
in some mountain communities 
in Jamaica, where it is called 
gumbe. 
D. ND. R.: The word gambe 
is also used in Senegal. It is 
the name of a dance—which is 
also old—aceompanied by 
singing, where women would 
delicately raise their volumi- 
nous boubous. At a concert we 
gave recently in Bahia the 
audience was very enthusi- 
astic, because we were giving 
them an opportunity to listen 
to their musical roots. In 
1960, when Senegal became 
independent, [I joined the 
Senegal Ballet, and we went on 
tours to Kurope—Czechoslo- 
vakia, Romania, Turkey. Then 
I decided to form my own 
group and taught musie to my 
children. Now they work with 
me. In 1980 I set up the 
Rosettes, a female percussion 
group, then the Roseanx, a 
troupe of children aged 
between fonr and twelve. They 
performed in Japan last year. 
HW How did you come to play with 
Miles Davis? 
D. N'D. R.: Miles had heard 
me on tape and asked me if I'd 
like 10 play in the first half of 
his concert at the Pare des 
Expositions in Paris. When the 
coneert was over, he eame and 
improvised with us. I’ve also 
played in the first half of con- 
certs by the Rolling Stones 
and several French singers. 
HM How did you learn to dance? 
D. ND. R.: By watching other 
people. All drummers know 
how to dance. 1s vital to dance 
well in order to play drums. 
M Do dancers depend on the 
drums or do theyinvent their 
ownrhythms? 
D. N'D. R.;: They follow the 
hen the drums dance: 
the marriage of hands and feet 
dmms, but each dancer has his 
or her favourite rhythms and 
can ask the musicians to play 
them. 1t’s the denm major who 
changes the rhythm, and he 
has to know what kind of 
instrument a particular musical 
genre should be played on. 
What’s more, cach dance has 
its own symbolism. 
HM Are old dances still 
performed? 
D. N'D. R.: Yes. The yaba, 
for instance, whichis a partic- 
ular favourite with older 
women in the regions of Saint- 
Louis, Dakar, Gorée and 
Rufisqne. Tt can be danced for 
hours on end. Tt was originally 
a danee for conrtesans. Only a 
few years ago, women would 
still put on their finest attire 
and jewelry, and do their hair 
in little plaits. They showed 
off their dresses and gems as 
they danced. Some of them 
undid their hair, then plaited 
it again as they continued to 
dance. During this dance the 
men would try to seduce the 
women. Many couples first met 
when dancing the yaba, and 
some have since been married 
for forty years! Another dance 
is the wongue, which is per- 
formed by initiates after civ- 
cmncision, or daneed to cele- 
brate the end of the harvest. 
The farevoudiare is danced 
by boys who are trying to 
appeal to girls. If a girl finds a 
dancer to her liking, she lets 
him know by taking off her 
headscarf and throwing it 
down in front of him. Lebont 
women prefer the niari 
gorong, where the rhythm is 
provided by two drums. It is 
danced at baptisms and wed- 
dings. as well as at circumei- 
sion ceremonies. Griots may 
sometimes play for traditional 
Sencgalese wrestling bonts. On 
these occasions they use a 
drum with a low sound, which 
has the same name as the 
sport itself: lamp. Here again 
the drum major leads, with 
ten or so drummers behind 
him. Certain passages in 
picees played on the khalam 
(a Wolof lute) may be accom- 
panied by muffled drums. 
HM Has the drums’ repertoire 
changed down the years? 
D. N'D. R.: Yes, enormously. 
The mbalax, for instance, is a 
basic rhythm which came into 
being in the 1970s and is 
played by one or more drums 
for festive dances performed 
during certain ceremonies 
such as baptisms and wed- 
dings. The younger generation 
lias changed. They know how 
to dance to new rhythms, 
though some youngsters some- 
times ask me to play them old 
ones. A very expressive dance 
that is all the rage with the 
Senegalese today is the 
digente niit at nit (under- 
standing between human 
beings), in which the dancers 
put their hands on their hearts 
and pretend to sleep. Its mes- 
sage is that everyone should 
get on with everyone else and 
open up their hearts [rom 
dawn to dusk. 
Hl Since the griots’ usual role is 
to keep traditions alive, were 
your compatriots surprised when 
you created new rhythms? 
D. ND. R.: No—and Dve 
invented more than 500 of 
them. Actually, that’s what 
helped me to become popular. 
I didn’t think it was right that 
my predecessors created 
rhythms and I didn’t. I’ve been 
inspired by events like football 
matches. Creating is something 
that is always uppermost mn my 
mind. I have composed the sig- 
nature tune of Senegal’s televi- 
sion news, among other things. 
It came to me one night when I 
was in a hotel in Romania and 
couldn't get to sleep. I could 
hear windows banging, birds, 
wind and rain, and 1 recorded all 
those natoral sounds on a little 
tape recorder. When I got back 
to Dakar, 1 went to the beaeh 
and continued recording—the 
return of the pirogue boatmen, 
the roar of the sea and, during a 
football match, the cheering of 
supporters, the sound of the 
ball hitting the gronnd, and the 
shouting of players. 1 had a 
good think, then I translated all 
those impressions into the lan- 
gnage of drums. 
HM How do you compose? 
D. N'D, R.: 1 hole up in a 
house T own near Dakar, so | 
ean get some peace and quiet. 
[invent sequences of rhythms, 
which I then work together. 
As our musie is passed on 
orally, I’ve created a code of 
gestures that enables ne to 
tel the musicians when to 
increase their tempo or 
volume, or when to change 
rhythm. There are passages 
where I improvise, and where 
the other drummers have to 
follow me. 
HW What plans do you have for 
the future? 
D. ND. R.: 1 would like to 
organize a concert in Franee in 
the year 2000 which would 
demonstrate the wealth of 
Africa’s rhythmical and 
musical heritage. I'll shortly he 
touring Africa, from the 
Maghreb to South Africa, 
looking for musicians and 
dancers. The show should 
inclnde rhythms, musical 
instruments and costumes from 
various African countries. WM

LETT BERS 
THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS 
The Appeal by the Director-General 
of UNESCO for the continuation of 
the peace process in the Middle 
East, published in your April 1996 
issue, raises a number of questions. 
No human being worthy of the name 
could fail to oppose terrorism. But 
terrorism does not arise sponta- 
neously. It is fed by bullying, humil- 
iations and constraints imposed on 
peoples whose condition is not far 
from slavery. If the many resolutions 
taken by the United Nations had 
been effectively implemented, 
would things be as they are today, in 
the Middle East and elsewhere? Is 
it not the ease that many heads of 
state have no intention of translating 
their fine words into deeds? In 
which ease, President Charles de 
Gaulle’s description of the UN as a 
“thingummyjig” is very apt.

Appeal for the continuation of the 
peace process in the Middle East, 
and would like to express our sup- 
port for it.

LYING BY OMISSION 
The illustrated pages devoted to the 
Second World War in your December 
1995 issue (“Troglodytes, a hidden 
i SS 
world”) give a good picture of how 
the war developed. However, they do 
not show clearly enough how the 
“demoeratic” powers, which chose to 
appease Ilitler in an effort to push 
him eastwards, encouraged the war- 
mongers, and how their non-interven- 
tion—I'm thinking partieularly of 
republican Spain and Czeehoslo- 
vakia—ultimately cost the lives of 
more than 50 million people on the 
European, African and Asian fronts. I 
spent four years in Mauthausen con- 
centration camp where 102,000 
people died of overwork, hunger, 
beatings, rain, cold, wind and snow. 1 
am the sole survivor of the 23 July 
1941 shipment. It is not easy to tell 
the story of the Nazi era, but lying 
by omission condemns us to endure 
anew trials and trihulations for which 
we paid such a heavy price.

A PERSONAL OPINION 
I'read very carefully the articles on 
the complexity of world problems 
published in your February 1996 
issue on complex thought. The con- 
elusion drawn by Mr. Ivar Ekeland 
at the end of his article on com- 
plexity seems to me extremely sim- 
plistic, however. It strikes me as 
frivolous to compare the vicissi- 
tudes of weather and climate with 
the governance of the United 
States. Most industrialized coun- 
tries are run by powerful financial 
groups, and unemployment in these 
countries is neither fortuitous nor 
The 10th Bordeaux Book Fair 
The Unesco Courier will be represented at the 10th Bordeaux 
(France) Book Fair (“Salon du Livre de Bordeaux”), which is to be 
held from 10 to 30 October 1996. 
The Fair will include two exhibitions, one devoted to the Sur- 
realists, the other to the French philosopher René Descartes, the 
400th anniversary of whose birth is being celebrated this year. 
The Fair will give a prominent place to literature for young 
people and to comic strips. Young readers will have an opportunity 
to meet their favourite authors and a jury of teenagers will award a 
prize for a first novel. 
This year’s annual foreign literature prize, which honours a 
non-Francophone writer and the quality of the translation of 
his/her work into French, will be awarded to the Italian novelist 
Pier Maria Pasinetti and his translator.

uncontrollable. Compared with 
these bastions of economic power, 
the Universal Declaration of ITuman 
Rights looks like a catalogue of 
pious hopes. Yet generous-minded 
people like the Abhé Pierre in 
France have a more humane and 
realistic view of things, and others 
such as Nelson Mandela have risked 
their lives and liberty to give sub- 
stance to these rights. But such 
people are rare. Too many people 
in high places are too comfortably 
ensconced in the system to want to 
change it. A regular Courier reader

your magazine to local youth clubs 
or reading rooms when I’ve finished

CLASSICAL BALLET 
IN OUR TIME 
I was very interested to read your 
January 1996 issue entitled “Dance, 
the sacred fire”. The articles on the 
aesthetic and social aspects of dance 
are of good quality and could be 
used for reference by anyone inter- 
ested in our art. But what a pity that 
there were no articles on the extraor- 
dinary heritage of the classical ballet 
tradition. Safeguarding the enduring 
values of this tradition and making 
them more widely understood should 
be part of the agenda of our time.

Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development 
chaired by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar

Goulandns, Keith Griffin, Mahbub ul Hag, Elizabeth Jelin, Angeline Kamba, Ole-Henrik Magga,

After three years of work and reflection, the World Commission on Culture and Development, 
comprised of 14 leading figures from a wide range of professional backgrounds, including four 
Nobel laureates, has unveiled its report, Our Creative Diversity. 
By reflecting upon a series of themes, the report broadens our concept of creativity, offering 
new approaches that heighten awareness of the cultural underpinning of human development. 
An International Agenda, intended to influence cultural strategies in the 21st century, makes 
ten recommendations, including the protection of cultural rights as human rights; the 
application of a new global ethics in global governance; the implementation of policies to 
  
enhance access to, and diversity and competition, in the international media system; and an 
international plan for gender equality.
