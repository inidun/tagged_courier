IN THIS ISSUE 
Shockwaves 
After the initial shock of the attacks 
on September 11,three words have 
been repeated like a mantra: 
war, civilization and Islam.Such 
reductionism more often than not 
prevents considered analysis of 
the context in which this abominable 
act was committed (p. 3). Several 
articles in this issue provide leads 
for undertaking such urgently needed 
reflection,though they were not 
planned as reactions to the atrocities 
in New York and Washington. 
From Jerusalem,the Palestinian 
scholar Sari Nusseibeh dreams 
that his city, ravaged by violence, 
may fulfil its destiny and bring peace 
to nations (pp. 4-9).Pierre Sané, a 
senior UNESCO official and former 
secretary-general of Amnesty 
International,explains why Durban 
was a success in the fight against 
racial discrimination, which lies at the 
source of many current frustrations 
(pp- 10-12).Dirty money is a weapon 
of terrorism:the United Nations 
is preparing a convention against 
corruption,a scourge fed by 
globalization (pp. 39-41).“Digital 
convergence unites all means of 
communication onto a single medium. 
This technical revolution goes hand 
in hand with increasing economic 
concentration,undermining the 
critical importance of pluralism 
(pp-39-41).In an interview, Malian 
griot Sotigui Kouyaté,one of Peter 
Brook’s longtime actors, shares a deep 
commitment to cultural encounters 
(pp- 47-51).Such cultural mixing is 
hard to come by in contemporary art, 
despite its claims to being universal 
(pp- 42-43).And while education is a 
key to transmitting knowledge and 
fostering critical thought,its role 
may be increasingly endangered 
by the ageing population of teachers 
(pp- 13-15). 
The dossier also brings a message 
of hope. While many have predicted 
that wars this century will be fought 
over water, recent and distant history 
points to the contrary:this precious 
resource nourishes dialogue rather 
than conflict (pp. 16-38).

VIEWPOINT 
10 In defence of Durban 
The Durban conference against racism was the target of much unfair criticism, argues Pierre 
Sané, who led UNesco’s delegation. 
EDUCATION 
13 A hard sell for teaching 
In industrialized countries, teaching is a greying profession. Attracting a new generation starts 
with addressing some deep-set grievances. Cynthia Guttman 
15 Chicago's headhunting drive Julie Blair 
Striking peace 
on troubled waters 
The one resource we can't live without is 
becoming ever more scarce. Will wars be fought 
over water, as they have been over oil? 
The thesis is provocative, but overlooks the fact 
that hostile countries have almost always 
managed to strike deals on the rivers flowing 
across their borders. From the Danube to 
the Nile, this dossier highlights the ways 
in which water is used to extinguish fires rather 
than ignite them.

September 11, 2001 
Making sense 
of the attack 
lose to 7,000 dead, nearly all of them missing. 
The world's sole superpower struck at the heart 
of its economic life and defence system, 
something that no state at war with the U.S. 
had previously managed to achieve. A whole 
new scale of destruction, marking the advent of “hyper- 
terrorism.” Suspects linked to obscure transnational networks 
believed to centre around a billionaire warlord, hidden in a 
country that could not be more different from America.No 
admission of responsibility. The September 11 attacks were 
unthinkable. For this very reason, the shockwaves that 
ensued have been unprecedented. 
First thoughts went to the victims, their families and 
the nation, in a spirit of unreserved solidarity. Then,once 
rescue operations got underway and public security 
measures were taken, came disbelief, rage and resolve, 
but also, on a more diffuse level, the time for 
introspection and doubt. 
American military forces are mobilizing and 
Operation “Infinite Justice,” (renamed "Enduring 
Freedom”) has been launched. But to deliver what kind 
of justice, within what legal constraints and against 
whom? Doing justice to the victims and preventing more 
violence by dismantling terrorism is a legitimate and 
imperative obligation. But the wall of an American 
Muslim insitute bears an anonymous warning: “An ‘eye 
for an eye’ leaves everyone blind.” Retaliation against 
fanatics using force alone succumbs to their logic. The 
military and security response can only be fair, and thus 
effective, if it is part of a global answer to the key 
question: how and why did we come to this? 
So far, the words that are repeatedly cited— war, 
civilization and Islamism—stand in the way of profound 
analysis. The first word is inappropriate, since wars are 
fought between nation-states. The second has a painful 
history that can be traced back to the Enlightenment, 
when humanity was divided into the “civilized” and 
“barbarians” in order to legitimize Western conquests. 
This war-cry of “civilization” came to paper over colonial 
expansion. Today, use of this word in the singular 
suggests that the world contains only one civilization, 
relegating all others to an inferior or even non-existent 
status. The third term, Islamism,describes a political and 
religious movement advocating expansion of and respect 
for Islam. The term is increasingly confused with its 
violent extremes, which are condemned by most 
Muslims. To line up this skewed definition with the words 
“war” and “civilization” is to adopt exactly the same 
way of thinking as that embraced by the alleged culprits. 
Actions that stem from such an interpretation inevitably 
lead to a dead-end. 
Reactions to the attacks as gleaned from the 
international press offer a starting point for reflection. 
They point to significant fault lines. The attacks were 
clearly a trauma for Americans, as well as for many 
people, mostly living in developed countries. A very small 
number of people openly displayed abominable joy. A 
larger group, while empathizing with the victims, looked 
upon these attacks as one more instance—albeit a more 
dramatic one—of a plague of violence affecting the 
entire planet. This time it had hit the U.S. as it had 
already struck many other countries. Yet perhaps the 
greatest number of people around the world showed no 
more than indifference, as if these events were 
happening on another planet, or did not break with life's 
daily routine. 
More than half a century ago in London, when 
German bombs were still raining upon the city, diplomats 
and an educated group of men and women gathered to 
reflect upon the unthinkable events of their time. Why 
and how, in the heart of “Christian Europe,” in the 
country with the most educated population, could 
Nazism surge and the Holocaust take place? What new 
world order could prevent a return to barbarism? Their 
answers are cast in UNesco's Constitution. They found 
that a denial of reason unleashed a denial of human 
dignity. They attributed this to barriers erected between 
people, which gave rise to “mutual incomprehension.” 
Their answer lay in a voluntary mission that called for the 
development of the “free exchange of ideas and 
knowledge” for the “purposes of mutual 
understanding” —the “United Nations.” They sought to 
give meaning to a world that had gone adrift by 
restoring “the moral and intellectual solidarity of 
mankind.” 
True, the historic context was starkly different from 
today. True, the world has strayed from the path traced 
by these visionaries. One probably explains the other. But 
do these differences invalidate the visionaries’ 
conclusions and render their path impracticable?

Following André Chouraqui’s vision of Jerusalem in last month's 
Courier, Al-Quds university president Sari Nusseibeh, whose family 
holds the keys to the Holy Sepulchre, spins a childhood tale that has 
lost none of its profound resonance 
childhood. For me, this is the essence of the identity of Jerusalem 
—a beautiful mosaic of tales spun out from a misty past, rooted 
in events, whether real or presumed,and constituting the fibre 
of the hearts and souls of its inhabitants.

mystery of Jerusalem is already engraved in the above tale. Laid 
out before me, immediately see the moral contours of a cosmic 
design, mapping out and balancing the relation between the Man 
and the City, between Earth and Heaven.At one end of the 
design stands the Conqueror and First leader of Men.But his 
size is diminutive. His submission is total. His humility and 
self-denial are complete. At the other end stands the Golden but 
“conquered” City. Its size is majestic. Its form is imperial. Its

heavenly walls totally impregnable, 
impervious but to the pious, who enter it 
submissively and with humility. It is not 
another stone-habitation to be submitted 
and conquered by force. It is the 
penultimate earthly stepping stone in the 
journey of the humble and pious towards 
their Creator. 
I look at this drawing in awe and 
wonder. Not here do I find the signs of 
pomp and glory of earthly warriors. Nor 
here in the drawing do I see the details of 
blood, battle and plunder. There is a 
peaceful absence of human force and 
violence. There is only the City’s divine 
supremacy, illuminating the path to God. 
A jewel box 
of moral tales 
I take a look back to reevaluate or 
understand the approach of the Caliph 
and his man-servant. It takes but a second 
for me to realize the other significant 
message, the other universal value in this 
childhood tale: the equality and 
brotherhood between men. Regardless 
of their respective earthly stations, Caliph 
and man-servant are equal before God. 
And, as equals, they naturally come to 
share their earthly utilities. 
This is certainly no Roman Emperor 
riding golden chariots surrounded and 
protected by soldiers and servants, nor a 
Cleopatra or Pharaoh carried regally on 
the shoulders of beautiful Nubians 
belonging to a sub-race, in celebration of 
Man’s mighty conquests: it is, rather, a 
humble servant of God, piously seeking to 
be received by Him. Jerusalem—the 
stones and the inhabitants—is a jewel- 
box of such moral tales. The mosaic 
intercrosses time and space, stone and 
soul, reality and dreams. It is impossible 
not to hear the throbs of your heart, not to 
pierce through present sounds and smells 
to the point of contact with the images and 
sounds of the past,as you tread through 
the ancient cobbled streets of history. 
You may see soldiers and guns parading through the streets 
of the present. You may see anguish or pain or suffering. You 
may sense bigotry, or bias or misplaced self-righteousness. But 
somehow, you manage to gaze right through these and other 
images of human contortions, from this period or from other 
grim periods of Jerusalem’s history, to see Jerusalem as its 
real, heavenly self, as a City of unity and piety. And as you gaze 
at this eternal Jerusalem with the eyes of faith, you manage

### 123745: Jerusalem: childhood truths

  
somehow to imbibe differences and imbalances, distilling into 
your own identity other peoples’ pains, tales and histories. 
For, what is a Jerusalemite if not a complete human being, a 
human being stripped of earthly prejudices, of racism and 
bigotry, a human being sufficiently purified to be received by 
God? 
I would like to believe, in spite of the contortions of the 
present, that Jerusalem can still outshine human differences 
and reign supreme; and that Jews, Christians and Muslims 
can still make Jerusalem fulfill its destiny of bringing peace unto 
the nations. I believe the secret to this dream lies in a childhood 
tale. It is the tale of Umar: that men who would venture 
to step into the earthly Jerusalem, in fulfillment of the 
beckoning of God, should behave towards each other as 
equals, and be prepared to share their earthly means of entry 
to the divine world. [|

(Aug. 31-Sept. 7) managed to draw

up to date on all these points. 
These kinds of political gatherings 
invariably give rise to trials of strength, 
and there are failings. The final 
documents in Durban do not mention 
the biggest group of human beings 
affected by discrimination—South 
Asia’s 260 million dalits, or 
untouchables. Neither was there 
mention of black people living in Arab 
countries, nor of the Palestinians. 
Putting faces 
on the victims 
But many “invisible” victims did 
show their faces to the world at the 
conference. Seemingly trivial but really 
very telling was a delegation of 
“Pygmies,” who came to publicize for 
the first time at a world conference the 
threats to their society from war in 
Central Africa. Afro-Latins—people of 
African origin from Colombia and 
Venezuela—also spoke of their 
suffering. 
The presence of delegations of 
Roms, Gypsies, Sindis and other 
travelling people—all victims of a 
racism ignored by the international 
community—were able through their 
links with NGOs to have their say in the 
conference's final declaration and action 
plan. Many other victims were clearly 
identified. Now it is up to governments 
to do something about them. This was a 
significant achievement for the con- 
ference. 
Some critics have singled out the 
“catch-all”nature of the gathering and 
claimed that it was submerged by 
disputes of “questionable relevance” — 
arguments about whether reparations 
should be made for slavery, or whether 
Israel should be condemned on the 
grounds that Zionism is racist. 
The task of the conference was to 
list the causes of racism, and slavery was 
seen in this context. The slave trade and 
colonialism were probably legitimized 
by racism and in turn encouraged it. 
They were denounced in these terms. 
And for the first time, the international 
community recognized that slavery and 
the slave trade were “appalling tragedies 
in the history of humanity” and that 
they formed a “crime against humanity.” 
All this is only a start. UNESCO, for 
example, argues that people have a duty 
to remember the past and is calling for 
scholars to be allowed access to all 
records so that the extent and effect of 
the slave trade can be conclusively 
assessed. It is also asking that school 
textbooks reflect the importance of this 
tragedy and its criminal nature. 
Hidden guilt 
The conference had no brief to work 
out details relating to the controversial 
issue of compensation for slavery during 
its 10-day session. But it carried out its 
job by making a declaration of principle 
over the “moral obligation” to pay 
financial compensation for wrongs 
committed,and for me that is stronger 
than a “legal obligation.” 
Giving the status of victims to 
Africans, who were the objects of this 
trade, finally enables their descendants 
to lift their heads high, while allowing 
the descendants of those who 
committed the crime to end their 
silence. 1 have always regarded 
development aid as the unhealthy 
product of a secret feeling of guilt. With

Some people think the Palestinian 
issue was intrusive, but it was inevitably 
going to come up in Durban at a 
conference organized by the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. For 
delegations from Arab and Muslim 
countries, the issue is one of human 
rights, discrimination (some Israeli laws 
discriminate in this way), violence 
against a people and violation of the 
right to self-determination. It is in the 
news and had to be raised,as apartheid 
was in its day.

conference, they could decide to include 
it for discussion. They did so, and the

“deep concern” over “the increase in 
anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in 
various parts of the world,” while 
emphatically rejecting any equivalence 
between Zionism and racism. 
A moral

Can we trust the countries that 
promised the conference they would 
fight racism? The first test will be 
whether they come up with national 
plans to do so, along with a budget, 
identification of perpetrators and 
victims, legislation and a timetable for 
action. They have said they will. To help 
them, the conference has drawn up a list 
of “best practices,” such as banning all 
kinds of discrimination in the workplace 
and in housing, devising ways to 
measure progress in education by the 
most disadvantaged groups, and 
assuring that those who file complaints 
about racism (especially concerning the 
police) are protected. 
All this might seem wishful thinking.

### 123746: In defence of Durban: racism is back on the agenda

VIEWPOINT 
 
A FORUM OF SOUND AND FURY 
urban gave the final proof: the gatherings of NGOs that are now part 
Dn parcel of all major UN conferences are turbulent affairs. To make 
matters worse, they are often infiltrated by “false NGOs,” associations 
created especially for the event by undemocratic states, political parties 
or industrial lobbies. But even so, these assemblies are valuable hothouses 
that have facilitated the gradual emergece of a “global civil society” intent 
on talking on equal terms with the powers that be. 
Durban, the first major conference of the 21st century, formed the 
latest instalment of a series of similar events (see p. 11) over the last 
decade, meetings that have heralded the ascent of non-governmental 
representatives into the management of international affairs.They may 
be accused of squandering funds (budgets vary from two to 10 million 
dollars each), but today's UN conferences are no longer mere stages for 
states to lock horns. Aside from revealing the differences between 
governments and other parts of society (such as NGOs, cities and 
businesses), the summits also vent the disputes within civil society 
itself. The Rio Earth Summit in 1992 was the first occasion in which 
NGOs, until then excluded from large global gatherings, played an 
significant part in shaping debate—even if their representatives were   
shunted several kilometres away from the official conference. Butall the 
same, they were there in force (over 2,500 of them), denouncing injustice, 
blaming market economics for its undesirable effects and proposing 
“alternatives.” 
Sometimes, as in the 1993 Vienna conference on human rights, activists 
have been granted a presence on the official podium and a voice in the 
final decision-making process. In Beijing,in 1995,they made the front 
page, which is more than can be said of the official conference discussions 
on women’s rights. For the very first time, Amnesty International's then 
secretary-general,Pierre Sané, held a press conference in China. 
As the summits have continued, these NGO forums have grown in 
importance and diversity, often with the approval of the UN. Termed the 
“gringo forum” at Rio due to the preponderance of groups from the 
northern hemisphere, these meetings have since welcomed a much greater 
presence of delegates from the developing world, testimony to the upsurge 
of southern NGOs. u

### 123747: A Hard sell for teaching

  
In the U.S.,up to 60 percent of teach- 
ers who work in poor neighbourhoods are 
not certified. More than half the country’s 
physics teachers don’t have a major or 
minor degree in the subject; for math 
teachers the proportion is 33 percent. 
In country after country, a paradox is in 
the making. On the one hand, standards are 
being raised and new curricula introduced 
in the name of the knowledge economy. 
“Things that you used to see in senior high 
school now appear in younger classes, 
because we're trying to cram in more and 
more,” says the general secretary of the 
Canadian Teachers’ Federation. 
On the other, teachers continue to be 
faced with large classes, mounting 
expectations and poor professional 
training. “We frequently have to update 
our knowledge, especially in the sciences, 
and this is not taken into account by 
institutions,” says a representative of the 
French secondary teachers’ union 
(SNES). In Britain, the government 
lowered national targets in math for 14- 
year-olds after schools complained that 
the demands were unrealistic 
Demands for a 
greater say 
What tends to exasperate the 
profession is that these targets often 
rhyme with stricter checks on teachers. In 
the UK, for example, teachers are 
expected to prepare detailed lesson plans 
for inspections and monitoring. “You 
have to prove that you're doing what the 
government has set down,” says Jeff 
Holman of the British National 
Association of Head Teachers. “There is 
a sense that someone is always looking 
over your shoulder.” 
His concern is shared by his peers in 
other countries. “Leading politicians say 
we should leave schools in the hands of 
professionals, then they turn around the 
next week and say that students need 
more training in history or again in maths 
because we're lagging behind the rest of 
Europe,” says Alf Lindberg, of the 
Swedish Teachers’ Union. “There’s a 
palpable sense,” according to SNES’ 
Denis Paget, that “governments no longer 
look towards teachers as people who are 
creative, but as executors of a 
programme.” 
For the OECD’s Santiago, “the main 
problem is that teachers don’t have 
enough autonomy and decision-making 
power. They don’t have much of a say 
about the curriculum and teaching 
1 4 The Unesco Courier - October 2001 
methods. For any activity, the most 
important thing is motivation, and that 
comes from incentives.” 
Incentives, however, are an explosive 
issue. So far, governments have mostly 
opted for “soft”ones. Sweden is offering 
training for unqualified teachers. Britain 
has introduced bursaries for trainee 
teachers and offered to pay off their 
student loans over their first ten years on 
the job. In certain short-staffed subjects, 
potential candidates are lured by “golden 
hellos,” while affordable housing has also 
“There's a palpable 
sense that 
governments 
no longer look towards 
teachers as people 
who are creative, 
but as programme 
executors” 
been promised in the 
prosperous southeast. 
Incentives become a much thornier 
issue when sacrosanct salary structures 
are touched. Teachers’ wages are 
traditionally based on education level 
and years of service. Arguably, the snail’s 
pace of pay rises adds to some of the 
profession’s gripes. The alternative of 
tying wages to student achievement and 
teachers’ performance in the classroom is 
political dynamite. Timid experiments 
with performance pay are being carried 
country’s 
out in a handful of U.S. school districts, 
while in Saxony (Germany) the education 
minister stepped down over an attempt to 
introduce this system. 
For now, there are less politically risky 
options. “Strategies are really crucial,” 
says Mildred Hudson, head of Recruiting 
New Teachers, a U.S. non-profit 
organization. “We've known this was 
going to be a problem, but we didn’t plan 
properly.” Coaching for apprentice 
teachers, scholarship support, fielding 
students at the high school level and 
scouting for talent in community colleges 
have all enjoyed modest success. Many in 
the profession also admit that it’s high 
time to “recognize that adults can go 
through two, three or four careers in their 
lifetime,” says Hudson “We don’t know 
how to bring those adults into the 
classroom and there’s definitely a pool 
out there.” 
Governments might have woken up 
late to the crisis, but shortages are now 
climbing high up on the political agenda. 
Education was a bone of contention in 
recent elections in Britain and the U.S., 
while in Sweden, a country heading for 
the polls, a recent Gallup survey revealed 
that 78 percent of those interviewed put 
education ahead of health care and 
unemployment as a leading concern. In 
France, also gearing up for elections in 
2002, schools have so far not been cited as 
a hot campaign topic. “Public debate is 
very weak,” laments Monique Vuaillat, 
the former head of SNES. Then again, 
the shadow of an economic slowdown 
might lure some talents toward a 
profession they'd once have shunned—at 
least until the going gets better. |

education.”   
ined with houses and gardens, the Dutch town of Almere hardly looks like a place where 
teacher shortage might be an issue. And yet, it's more acute here than anywhere else in 
the country. “ Between last Christmas and the summer, at any given time, three or four schools 
were forced to lock their doors for one or two days a week,” says Netty Tiemersma, head 
Almere has arisen in less than 25 years on the outskirts of Amsterdam, growing rapidly into 
a middle-class town of 160,000 people, with a majority of young families. Against the backdrop 
of a national shortage, teachers have been hard to come by. Instead, Almere has come up 
with other solutions, such as team teaching. Primary schools have hired assistants from 
different walks of life and bumped up class sizes to 40 or 50 pupils. Teachers divide them 
into sub-groups and rely on their assistants for learning activities. In the longer run, 
assistants may receive teaching qualifications. The strategy, now being tried out in other towns, 
is winning support, with retired teachers and part-time bankers knocking on Almere’s 
school doors. The board stands ready to “interview anyone interested in working in

### 123748: Chicago's headhunting drive: a hard sell for teaching

  
A HARD SELL FOR TEACHING 
Chicago's headhunting drive 
The “windy city” has embarked on an aggressive drive to court teachers, often weary of working in a 
district where a majority of students live in poverty 
JULIE BLAIR 
ReporTER AT EDUCATION WEEK (U.S.) 
RRR 
ree years ago, administrators in the 
hicago Public Schools did little more than 
hci available teaching positions in 
cal newspapers in an attempt to recruit 
tors. 
This academic year, they’ll spend more 
than $2 million on the endeavour, dispatch 
headhunters throughout the nation to 
locate talent, and develop a partnership 
with the city to provide affordable housing 
for those they hire. 
“In a seller’s market, we have to go out 
there and woo people,” said Carlos Ponce, 
chief human resources officer for the school 
district. Critics, however, warn that 
ambitious recruiting efforts must be coupled 
with well-funded retention policies. “You 
can recruit all you want and have wonderful 
incentives, but if working conditions are 
not palatable, teachers are going to leave,” 
said Barnett Berry of the National 
Commission on Teaching & America’s 
Future, a panel of educators, public officials, 
business and community leaders charged 
with analyzing the national teacher 
shortage. 
Corporate tactics 
Like many urban school districts in the 
United States, the Chicago Public Schools 
has overhauled its approach to attract and 
retain teachers. Of the 26,000 educators 
now on the payroll, 17 percent will be 
eligible to retire next year, Ponce said. And 
while the state of Illinois produces more 
than enough teachers to meet demand, 
only a handful want to take on the 
challenges of working in America’s third- 
largest school district, where 94 percent of 
the 432,000 students enrolled are believed 
to live in poverty, a figure based on the 
number of free lunches distributed.Many 
students are black or belong to Hispanic 
and other minority groups, and 
administrators are desperate for educators 
to reflect this diversity, as well as for those 
who are bilingual, qualified to teach special 
education, mathematics, science, or are 
willing to work in schools located within the 
poorest neighbourhoods. 
“In the past, we used to just sit back and 
wait until teachers came to us,” Ponce said. 
“What we did [during the 1998-99 school 
year] was to institute a corporate-style 
recruiting programme.” That meant 
allocating significantly more dollars and 
manpower to recruitment efforts and 
thinking creatively about meeting the needs 
of rookie educators. The recruitment 
budget was increased from $500,000 to $2.1 
million over the past three years, and 12 
recruitment officers now do the work once 
assigned to two, Ponce said. This year, they’ll 
travel to 60 colleges and universities around 
the country to attend job fairs, a strategy 
never before implemented. 
Furthermore, the headhunters are 
offering competitive packages. Beginning 
teachers with bachelor’s degrees can earn 
between $35,521 and $39,365 their first 
year;those with master’s degrees can pull 
in between $37,981 and $41,825. Educators 
also have the choice of two types of medical

Looking for educators who are rea 
plans and may be eligible for a college debt 
cancellation programme offered by the 
federal government, provided they choose 
to work in a shortage area. To make the deal 
even more attractive, the district has 
instituted a pilot programme to provide 
up to $5,000 in salary advances to be repaid 
over a teacher’s first few years of work. 
Future plans include embarking on a 
partnership with the city to provide housing 
assistance for teachers in a city where the 
cost of living is high. 
To date, the strategies appear to be 
working, Ponce said.“During the 1998-99 
school year, we brought in 1,900 teachers,” 
he said.“In 1999-2000, we did 2,200. This 
year, we're shooting for 3,000.” 
Experts, however, point out that there 
isno research available to determine which 
strategies are most cost-effective. “We're 
getting a number of takers on these things, 
but we don’t know what the long term 
impact will be,” said Susan Melnick of 
Michigan State University. 
Success depends on making lasting 
changes within the system, she said, from 
higher wages and better training to 
effectively manage the difficulties of the 
modern-day classroom. That will all come 
in good time, Ponce said.“None is happier 
than me about the national teacher 
shortage because it has allowed us to

ill wars be fought over water, as they have been over oil? The 
fear has been expressed by high-ranking UN officials and state 
leaders. The short answer is that no military force in the 
world has ever managed to “capture”a river basin and the 
only full-fledged water war dates back over 4,500 years (pp. 
18-19)." Water by its very nature is used to extinguish fires, 
not to ignite them,” says Jordan's Munther Haddadin, who 
negotiated one of the most historic water agreements ever 
signed (p. 22). 
In the Middle East, thirsty nations have no choice but to cooperate. Despite the bloodshed 
between Israelis and Palestinians, the two sides regularly meet to assure water supply in the West 
Bank, while informal talks continue on a plan to share the region's resources (pp. 22-25). 
From the Danube (pp. 26-27) to the Nile (pp. 30-31), mighty rivers have been used as pawns in the 
Cold War. Yet today, as countries like Egypt, Ethiopia or the republics of 
Central Asia shake free from this legacy, they are learning to trust one another by trading in the 
economic benefits of water, like hydroelectricity or irrigation supplies. Just by studying an aquifer 
or a river, states like Namibia and 
Botswana (pp. 34-36), or India and 
Bangladesh (pp. 32-33), are shedding 
t h e [ r 
mutual suspicions. There are no magic 
formulas in hydrodiplomacy, but slowly, 
a new alliance is forming between 
lawyers, technicians and the people 
closest to the resource (pp. 37-38). 
Together, they are devising ways of 
sharing the one natural resource that 
we cannot replace, or live without.

### 123758: Don't cry wolf

PEACE 
bled waters 
DON'T CRY WOLF 
JEROME DELLI PRISCOLI 
SENIOR POLICYANALYST AT THE INSTITUTE OF WATER RESOURCES, U.S. ARMY CORP OF ENGINEERS 
There is no denying the potential violence 
surrounding the current water crisis. 
About 40 percent of the world’s 
population live in river basins shared by 
two or more countries. These basins 
comprise more then 50 percent of our 
planet’s landmass. Only a fool would be 
surprised to find competing claims over 
water. Yet this interdependence does not 
inevitably lead to war over water. 
The “water war”thesis may actually 
help create the very conflicts it seeks to 
avoid. It is usually presented as a growing 
number of people vying for less and less 
water. However, the current crisis is not 
about an absolute limit, but about 
distribution. For water to reach people at 
the right place and time, a government 
must have access to technology, 
knowledge and money as well as the 
institutional capacity to distribute this 
essential resource. 
The wealthy North cannot approach 
the South by saying, “Conserve water! 
Don’t develop the resource. Don’t use 
water-saving technologies to grow food. 
And for God’s sake, reduce population!” 
This message may be based upon good 
intentions but it reinforces a sense of panic 
and the notion of a zero-sum game, in 
which one side must compete against 
another for water. It is a message to the 
bullies, “You better get yours first!” 
By focusing on looming water wars, 
we fail to see water as a tool for 
preventive diplomacy. For example, a 
river basin forces us to rethink notions of 
i n t e 
dependence. Instead of fearing it as 
weakness, we use it as a network to better 
respond to the tests of nature. By 
exchanging information on events like a 
flood or drought, states can reduce the 
potential danger. This flexibility addresses 
the basic, almost primordial fear that has 
driven humans to become toolmakers 
and engineers: fear of uncertainty in a 
harsh environment. While often 
challenging the engineering mentality, 
this same fear inspires environmental 
concerns. Somehow water forces us to go 
deeper, beyond adversarial relationships, 
to confront what we really share—an 
instinct for life. 
Water is one of our enduring human 
symbols of life, regeneration,purity and 
Tr -) 
hope. It is one of our potent links with the 
sacred, with nature and with our cultural 
inheritance. It offers a medium for a 
global project that unifies humanity in a 
single cause for peace, stability and 
ecological sustainability. The water war 
thesis takes us in the opposite direction. 
It denies the universal acceptance of 
water as a common good. 
The water war thesis has raised 
consciousness of the resource. But we 
are in danger of crying wolf too often. 
This thesis plays to human fears—fears of 
change, fears of deprivation, fears of 
limits, fears of violence and indeed 
primordial fears of death. It is time to 
move beyond fear to action. Leaders 
need to rediscover and harness water’s 
capacity to generate wealth, its potential 
for multiple uses and reuse, its great 
convening power, its ability to provide 
the learning ground for building civic 
culture. 
Perhaps we need to “go back to the 
future”and look at how water has been 
used in order to redefine the goals of 
water leadership. Water holds the 
potential for both conflict and 
cooperation—the choice is ours n

ust about every journalist writing about water 
will evoke the spectre of past and impending 
wars over the resource. You have searched 
for and analyzed every international water 
agreement signed and “incident” reported. 
Ww h e n 
was the last time two states formally went to war 
over water? 
The only recorded incident of an outright war 
over water was 4,500 years ago between two 
Mesopotamian city-states over the Tigris-Euphrates 
in the region we now call southern Iraq. Since then, 
you find water exacerbating relations at the 
international scale. But you also regularly find 
hostile states—such as India and Pakistan or the 
Israelis and Palestinians—resolving water conflicts 
even while disputes rage over other issues.

have run out of water. They have the means to 
divert their neighbour’s water and the enmity 
between them couldn’t get much worse. Yet they 
have all come up with agreements. 
States have gone to war over oil, why not water? 
Strategically, water wars don’t make sense. You 
cannot increase your water resources by going to 
war with a neighbour unless you are willing to 
capture the entire watershed, depopulate it and 
not expect a tremendous retaliation. 
But water has been used as a weapon and target in war. 
That's a totally different issue, which happens all 
the time. During the Gulf War, Iraq destroyed most 
of Kuwait’s desalination plants and the Allied 
coalition intentionally targeted Baghdad’s water 
supply and sanitation system. Serbian engineers 
reportedly shut down Pristina’s water system in 
Kosovo before NATO arrived in 1999. 
Yet you must distinguish between water as a 
source of conflict, as a resource and as a weapon. 
We've gone to war over oil. Yet you wouldn’t put 
that event in the same category 
as the military use of a flame

thirds of a total of 1,800 events with a neighbour A lot came from the post- 
involved cooperation, like 
conducting joint scientific 
investigations or signing over 150 water treaties. 
Turning to the negative events, we found that 
80 percent consisted of verbal threats and posturing 
by state leaders, which was probably aimed at their 
own internal constituents. In 1979, Egyptian 
president Anwar Sadat said:“The only matter that 
could take Egypt to war again is water,” in reference 
to the Nile. King Hussein allegedly said the same 
thing for Jordan in 1990. 
Yet in the last 50 years, there have only been 
37 events in which people actually shot at each 
other over water. Of those, 27 were between Israel 
and Syria over the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. 
But critics argue that you cannot look to history to

Cold War period, when the 
Western military asked,“what 
do we do now?” That is when this whole 
environmental security movement took off. By 
around 1992, a lot of political scientists began writing 
that resource scarcity in general was going to lead to 
warfare. It’s very tempting to see water as a source of 
conflict once you begin to understand what it means 
to society and ecosystems. But in emphasizing the 
value of the resource, these analysts overlooked the 
subtleties involved. 
You argue that water by its very nature induces co- 
operation between states. Can you give an example? 
The Oslo Accord between Israelis and Palestinians 
actually came out of backroom talks among water 
people from the region who met in Zurich in 1990— 
I believe. The water people introduced their political

STRIKING PEACE ON TROUBLED WATERS 
 
water naturally flows into other realms. States along 
the Nile began by talking about water and are now 
working towards an agreement that includes roads, 
electricity and other infrastructure (see pp. 30-31). 
You maintain that the “red flag” for international 
water is not water scarcity but one country’s attempt 
to dominate an international river. Most of these 
conflicts usually revolve around plans to build a 
major dam. But this kind of project generally requires 
assistance from organizations like the World Bank, 
which evaluate proposals according to environmental 
and ethical criteria. By pulling the purse strings, can’t 
these organizations prevent water conflicts from 
arising? 
What you're suggesting has been the case. But 
as more private capital takes over investment in 
these projects, the ethical and environmental 
criteria of the development banks is no longer an 
issue. Turkey, for example, is diverting private 
and public capital to fund one of the most content- 
ious projects, known as GAP, which envisages the 
construction of 22 dams and 19 power plants on 
the Tigris-Euphrates and its tributaries. The same is 
true for the Narmada dam in India and China’s 
Three Gorges project. 
The Tigris-Euphrates is regularly cited as a flashpoint 
for a possible war. How can anyone induce Turkey, 
probably the most powerful state in the region,not 
to pursue its own interests to the detriment of its 
downstream neighbours, Iraq and Syria?

ER a i a A St

” "J Dw     
Everybody keeps talking about the Tigris- 
Euphrates as a potential flashpoint, but what's really 
interesting is that in 1991, NATO actually asked 
Turkey to shut the flow of the Euphrates towards 
Iraq. But the government refused and basically 
said,“You can use our air space and bases to bomb 
Irag,but we won't cut off their water.” 
Since the 1970s, Turkey, Syria and Iraq have 
had an implicit agreement, which Turkey continued 
to respect even while building the dams. And despite 
the rhetoric, Syria and Iraq both recognize that 
they benefit from those dams because they even out 
the river’s flow and extend their farmers’ growing 
season. Turkey wants to be seen as a fair, good 
neighbour for several reasons, including NATO 
pressure as an ally, internal politics and attempts to 
join the European Union. The difficulty lies in 
making the implicit agreements explicit. 
Water professionals maintain that you have to 
manage a river basin as a whole. But multilateral 
water treaties must be a nightmare to negotiate. 
Which are more effective—multilateral or bilateral 
agreements? 
The more people in the room, the more difficult 
it is to reach an agreement, especially when you 
are dealing with a country’s sovereignty. Take the 
Jordan River as an example: Syria and Jordan have 
an agreement, Jordan and Israel have an agreement, 
Israel and Palestinians have an agreement—several 
sets of bilateral agreements for a multilateral basin 
which is managed fairly efficiently, although the 
Palestinians will eventually claim and probably get 
greater water rights. 
A new way of solving water conflicts, some economists 
argue, is to set up an international water market.But 
then again, we can look to the recent conflict in which 
the U.S. has argued that Canada must sell its water 
resources under the terms of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement—a proposition that Canada rejects. 
What is the value of treating water as an economic 
resource when trying to resolve a conflict? 
Economists can highlight and quantify the 
benefits flowing from water, like hydroelectricity, 
and help build what we call a “baskets of benefits.” 
For example, the U.S. and Canada have an 
agreement in which the U.S. has flood control dams 
within Canadian territory. The U.S. pays Canada 
for that benefit. It is generally easier and more 
equitable to allocate the benefits than the water 
itself. 
Economists also remind us of the need to recover 
the cost of water delivery, treatment,storage and so 
on. But we’re often pushed to think in terms of water 
markets—buying and selling water as a commodity 
even though this has never happened internationally 
in a practical sense. As someone who is committed to 
water emotionally, aesthetically, religiously and for 
ecosystems, I am reluctant to think of water as just 
another economic good. |

A thirsty world 
The population is not only growing but using more water, even though 
the world’s total supply remains the same. This scarcity could put a major 
brake on the world’s development this century 
  
  
f states substantially invest in water-related infrastructure 
and management policies, we can expect the projections 
presented below. 
Yet despite these efforts, many countries will still face 
“physical water scarcity in 2025:" their water needs will 
outstrip supplies no matter what measures are taken.Others 
will be faced with “economic water scarcity: "they will lack 
the financial and institutional capacity required to increase 
their water supplies by 25 percent.

TAKING STOCK TO BETTER MOVE AHEAD 
early ten years have passed since the Rio Earth Summit of 
1992 alerted the world to the importance of “water” on the 
international development agenda. Since then, assessments of 
global water resources indicate that water scarcity will increase 
dramatically during the next decades, with a disproportionate 
effect on developing countries. Demand is growing,and with it, 
competition among different users. Unless we change the way we 
think about and manage our water resources, both people and 
planet could suffer irreparable damage. Already, the lives and well- 
being of millions of people are constrained by water. 
The World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP)—established 
in 2000 and endorsed by 23 United Nations agencies with a stake 
in water—is part of the global effort to seek integrated 
approaches and sustainable solutions to human development 
problems. Hosted at UNEsco, it responds to concerns expressed by 
the international community at the World Water Forum in The 
Hague (2000), and builds on the challenges identified in the 
Ministerial Declaration that followed. 
A key component of the project will include the World Water 
Development Report, which will not only assess the state of the 
world’s water resources but monitor the progress in meeting its 
growing demand. The first edition of the report will be published 
in 2003. 
The Unesco Courier - October 2001 
Within the WWAP framework, a project has recently been 
launched to help dispel the myth that increasing water stress 
will inevitably lead to international conflicts or potential 
“flashpoints,” namely along the world's 
261 international river basins “shared” by 145 countries. 
Although water offers potential for conflict,it also provides a 
powerful tool for cooperation. Hence the title of the new PPCP 
project: From Potential Conflict to Cooperation Potential. A 
series of studies, publications and educational activities will 
focus on the social, cultural, scientific and political complexities 
involved in transboundary water resources. |

STRIKING PEACE ON TROUBLED WATERS 
 
on our part was the recognition of Israel. I had to 
make the Israelis feel secure but at the same time use 
this weakness as a card in my sleeve.” 
Tales of poisoning 
As Haddadin explains, all of the states along the 
Jordan River had agreed to their rightful share of water 
in a plan drawn up with the assistance of an American 
diplomat in 1955. However, the technical resolution 
wasn’t translated into a political accord because it 
would entail tacit Arab recognition of the state of 
Israel. Once Egypt broke this taboo in 1979, Israel 
was anxious to continue the peace process and turned 
to Jordan. To some extent,water served as a bridge in 
opening discussions between the two states: a drought- 
stricken Jordan was losing part of its rightful share of 
the Yarmouk River to Syria and Israel. 
At first, Haddadin kept contact to a minimum, 
only discussing immediate technical problems, like 
the famous sandbar, under the auspices of the United 
Nations Truce Supervision Organization. With military 
escorts looking on, Haddadin and his Israeli 
counterpart would meet midstream, standing in two 
feet of the river’s water. Slowly, they got in the habit of 
pulling up sandbags to talk at a makeshift picnic table 
along the Yarmouk.But it wasn’t until 1991 that the 
formal peace process began and Haddadin began 
hammering out major water-sharing proposals. 
Whether meeting in a hotel lobby in a foreign 
capital or the garden of Jordan’s Crown Prince, “always 
avoid a stand-off,” says Haddadin. When Israelis balked 
at his demands for more water, he would “beat around 
the bush”on economic grounds. “Let us see who can 
afford to increase their supply by pumping or 
desalinating water,” he would ask in order to highlight 
the gap in per capita income between the two countries. 
“Do you think you will live in peace when your 
neighbour is starving?” 
During the three years it took to forge a deal, 
Haddadin earned a reputation as a staunch negotiator 
and a hothead capable of exploding unexpectedly, which 
he laughs off as a “skill” to destabilize his opponents. But 
as he notes, you cannot just seal a deal,you have to sell 
it. With kid gloves, he informed his fellow officials that 
they didn’t own the country’s namesake and would have 
to share the water of the Jordan River Basin. Despite 
personal attacks (namely false rumours that his 
American wife was Jewish), Haddadin proudly watched 
the signing of the peace treaty with its water annex in 
1994 and later became minister of water and irrigation. 
But Haddadin would pay for this glory in 1998, 
when residents of West Amman found cloudy water 
running through their taps after a treatment plant 
failed to handle high levels of algae. The water didn’t 
pose a serious health threat but it did spread a noxious 
mix of nationalism and fear, as tales of Israeli poisoning JORDAN 
spread through the media and ordinary grapevines. 
“The panic was orchestrated from within Jordan to Logi 22 
bring down the government,” says Haddadin, who source: Mount Hermon 
decided to resign as minister. Since then,he has gone | Mouth: Dead Sea

The violence of the past year has killed the formal 
discussions on redistributing water supplies and 
recognizing Palestinian sovereign rights over natural 
resources. The Israeli government no longer considers 
water to be a technical issue but a matter of national 
security. According to the hawks, Israels very existence 
depends upon military and political control of the 
Palestinian Territories, especially the West Bank which 
provides for 25 percent of Isracli water needs. 
Talking dollars 
and cents 
This obsession with security is certainly not new in 
Israel. Even before the intifada, environmental issues 
were cast as threats, sold to the public as “water 
security” or “food security.” The Western press in 
particular has towed this line, peddling stories about 
water inevitably killing prospects for peace. Yet the 
truth of the matter is that hydrologists and civil 
engineers on both sides have been steadily developing 
 
possible long-term agreements. While formal SEER 
discussions of these plans are now taboo, technicians ~~ | 53

on all sides. Here is an outline of a plan we have in 
mind. 
First a bit of background.Palestinians each have 
about 85 cubic metres per year for all of their needs— 
domestic, industry and agriculture. Average use among 
Israelis is 447 cubic metres per year. In the West Bank, 
about 25 percent of the population doesn’t have 
running water, even though this area is relatively rich 
in groundwater thanks to the Mountain Aquifer, from 
which Israel pumps about 85 percent of its yield. Here 
lies the heart of the dispute. 
The famous Mountain Aquifer actually consists 
of three different ones—situated in the east, northwest 
and west of the mountain. The media tends to paint the 
Eastern Aquifer as a political minefield, yet the path to 
resolution is far from tortuous. The Palestinians can MOUNTAIN

Farmers setting up irrigation for agriculture

pumps after 1967 Israel has apparently contravened 
international rules concerning military occupation. 
The decision to give up this aquifer is not as painful as 
it might seem. It is the poorest of the three in terms of 
water quantity and quality. 
The rest is not so clear-cut, as seen with the Western 
Aquifer, the largest of the three. About 80 percent of

trickle down into the aquifer—lies in Palestine.

to give up control over a resource, especially one so 
precious and politically explosive as water. But there 
is another way of evaluating the trade-off: in dollars and 
cents. 
Water equals money. Each cubic metre of water in 
Israel is worth an estimated $0.20/m>. So the water in 
dispute amounts to between $20-40 million a year—or 
about 0.05 percent of Israeli GDP. This isn’t worth 
fighting over. It is money well spent. 
The economic value of water is obviously not new

Debates over water rights generally turn in circles. 
While there is clearly a need to recognize both sides’ 
sovereign rights to natural resources, international 
law and common sense directs us to find a “reasonable 
and equitable” use of the water. How do you determine 
a fair deal? You cannot quantify a right to water, but 
you can calculate the need for it. 
Everyone—Palestinians and Israelis—should be 
entitled to a minimum of 100 metres’ per year for 
domestic and industrial use. To do this, Israel would 
have to reallocate 100 to 200 more million metres’ of 
water each year to Palestinians. No state leader wants

degradable packets of water. It’s 
a lot easier and cheaper to import a tonne of fruit and 
vegetables than the water it takes to grow it. 
We want to expand this trade. To begin with, Israeli 
farmers can no longer earn a living by feeding their 
country, which is accustomed to a costly Western 
lifestyle. Not so for the Palestinians. Both Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority currently allocate about 80 
percent of their respective water supplies to 
agriculture. In Israel, farmers make up about three 
percent of the labour force and contribute three 
percent of the GDP. In Gaza and the West Bank, a 
third of workers depend upon agriculture, which 
accounts for about a third of the GDP. So it is no 
surprise to find that Israel buys the entire surplus 
from farms in the West Bank and Gaza, providing

STRIKING PEACE ON TROUBLED WATERS 
 
for one-twelfth of the country’s fresh fruit and 
vegetable needs. We suggest that they both use this 
trend to their advantage and that of their neighbour, 
Jordan. 
Over the next 10 to 15 years, all three parties 
should agree to increase the supply of irrigation water 
in Palestine and Jordan. There are several options for 
finding the extra water within the Jordan Valley: a 
redistribution of supplies from the Mountain Aquifer 
and the Jordan River. Rain-harvesting, treated 
wastewater and improved infrastructure (40 percent of 
water 1s lost to leaky pipes in some Palestinian 
municipalities). New sources further afield might also 
open up. For example, Lebanon might sell water from 
the Litani River which could be stored in Lake Tiberias. 
The new Unity Dam, under construction by Jordan and 
Syria,also holds potential. 
Desalination: the saviour? 
No one loses in this proposal. Palestinians and 
Jordanians see a steady increase in the number of 
agricultural jobs at a time of staggering unemployment. 
They also gain a guaranteed market for crops and by 
cultivating more land, Palestinian farmers lay the seeds 
for new settlements. We are not suggesting that 
Palestine base its economy on agriculture in the long- 
term.No country in the Middle East can afford to do 
so financially or environmentally. But after decades of 
occupation,Palestinians cannot be expected to leap- 
frog economically. 
Despite Israel’s cultural attachment “to making the 
desert bloom,” the state will have to cut back on 
farming. By allocating more water to Palestinians and 
Jordan, it would not only gain a secure source of cheap 
fresh food, but the country’s hi-tech industry would 
grow by selling irrigation technologies as well as high- 
profit seeds, fertilizers and pesticides 
Finally, the international community could 
“reward” such a regional plan by setting up an 
international fund for research and development in 
water desalination. For this is clearly our most likely 
option in the very near future. 
In the next 20 to 30 years, the Israeli and Palestinian 
populations are expected to double as their respective 
diasporas immigrate to the region, especially with 
formal recognition of a Palestinian state. Every drop 
of fresh water will be required to fulfill domestic needs. 
Desalination will be the saviour. Today the process 
costs about $0.65/m>, which is still far too expensive, 
especially for agriculture. (In the Middle East, a cubic 
metre used for irrigation brings an economic return of 
just $0.50 to $1.00). Yet it is still cheaper than importing 
from the region’s hydrological baron, Turkey, which has 
proposed constructing a “peace pipeline” to deliver and 
sell its blue gold at 
$0.95/m’. 
This proposal may appear to be a naive attempt to 
deny the escalating violence. Yet from where we stand, 
it would be absurd and even criminal to give up on our 
work.In the very near future, technicians from both 
sides and beyond will be meeting outside the region to 
continue to informally discuss and refine this proposal. 
Contrary to popular belief, water in the Middle East is 
not a source of war, but ingenuity. n 
THE DEHYDRATED WEST BANK 
  
  
Based upon a new report by B'Tselem—the Israeli Center for Human Rights in 
the Occupied Territories—released in July 2001. 
n the West Bank, 218 villages—home to about 200,000 people—are not 
connected to a single water network. This is why just about every yard in the 
area has a cistern where families store the rain water they have collected from 
the rooftops of their homes. However, they can usually only live from supplies 
during the rainy season between November and March. 
In the summer months and sometimes even the winter, most residents have no 
choice but to buy water from vendors who own private tankers. Even villages with 
running water often rely on this commerce because of the irregular supply 
during dry months. The owners of the tankers buy most of the water from 
Palestinian municipal water networks and the rest from Israeli settlements and 
Palestinian-owned private agricultural wells (which are not subject to any 
quality control). 
This water market is completely unregulated—"market forces” alone set the 
prices. While a household connected to a water network will pay the equivalent 
of about a dollar per metre? a vendor will charge between $3.50 and $9.50 for 
the same amount. This financial burden is like a noose around the neck of many 
families, who have lost their primary source of income since the intifada.’ 
According to B'Tselem, some village residents can no longer purchase water from 
the tankers. In the summer, the women and children of these families cross military 
checkpoints and blocked roads to fill bottles and jerrycans with water from nearby 
springs. 
The West Bank contains 114 springs, most of which are primarily used for 
irrigation. The most bountiful springs lie in the Nablus and Jericho districts (52 
springs). The others are generally quite poor, especially given the current drought. 
For example, the Auja spring, north of Jericho, has totally dried up over the last 
three years. Despite decreasing rainfall, an Israeli well continues to pump the 
aquifer that feeds the spring for the benefit of nearby Israeli settlements. The 
situation has devastated Palestinian agriculture in Al Auga,whose farmers used 
to rely upon the spring for irrigation water. 
In general, the springs are not just poor in terms of quantity but also quality. The 
Palestinian Authority does not control the water, despite the high risk of pollution 
by sewage from nearby towns and villages as well as from Israeli settlements and 
industrial zones. The very source of a spring can be at risk as the pesticides and 
fertilizers used by local farmers seep into the ground. | 
1. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in the first quarter 
of 2001, the median income of a household in the Occupied Territories fell 
by 48 percent, unemployment increased from 11 percent before the intifada 
to 38 percent, and the percentage of families living in poverty increased to 
64 percent, compared to 21 percent before the intifada.

A tale of two dams 
An author renowned for his sense of humour takes a grim view 
of a political row between his native Hungary and Slovakia in which

e may thank rivers for life: bringing 
water to drink, to nourish our fields 
and to carry our boats. There is only 
one problem: they are exceptionally 
suited to forming borders. Instead of 
uniting people bound for a common destiny, suspicious 
nations, often incited by clashing politics, glare at each 
other like wolves from opposing shores. I have seen 
such venom flowing along the Danube between Hungary 
and Slovakia. 
The Danube has always been a tempestuous force, 
bringing alternating waves of calamity. Either it was too 
abundant, forcing entire villages to seek higher 
ground,or it was too feeble, leaving fields to wither 
and causing a sudden halt to navigation. 
The Roman emperors Tiberius and Trajan were 
the first to hire civil engineers to devise ways of 
protecting their banks from the fickle Danube. Many 
would follow their example, but it was not before the 
20th century that the technicians would muster the 
power and tools to tame the river. 
By 1951, serious plans were underway to build a 
series of dams along the Danube in Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union was anxious to alter 
the river’s shallow reaches which were hampering the 
shipment of its goods in Eastern Europe. At that time, 
few questioned the wisdom of “correcting mother 
nature” and it was considered a scientifically proven fact 
that a river the size of the Danube required not just one 
dam,but several. Otherwise, sediments would collect

and disrupt navigation and damage embankments, 
causing bridges to collapse. It would take another 
20 years to iron out the technical and financial 
arrangements but in September 1977,the Republic of 
Hungary and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic 
signed a now infamous treaty to build the Gabcikovo- 
Nagymaros dam system. 
Grinding the axe 
of the opposition 
The region was clearly suffering. Authorities 
recorded more than 100 days of shallow waters a year, 
which damaged the wild flora and left several hundred 
ships stranded along a 250-kilometre stretch of the 
river. While the project was originally intended to 
improve navigation, it grew to include hydroelectricity 
as the oil shocks of the 1970s intensified. 
A large reservoir would be built at Dunakiliti, 
which straddled both countries. From there, a 17-km 
canal would divert 90 to 95 percent of the Danube’s flow 
to a hydroelectric dam and powerplant in Gabcikovo 
in Czechoslovakia. About 100 km downstream in 
Hungary at Nagymaros, another power station and 
dam would even the river’s flow. 
Construction began in 1978 based upon plans drawn 
up by world-famous Hungarian Slovak and Austrian 
water experts, against whom accusations of a technical 
nature could hardly have been raised—not so against 
their political inclinations, as it was later revealed. 
By the end of the 1980s, the powers waiting to 
relieve the socialist system of Eastern Europe lurked in 
the shadows. Yet they could hardly demand the 
departure of the occupying Soviet army, or indeed a 
multi-party system. Instead, they demonstrated on 
environmental grounds and found an obvious target in 
the ongoing construction of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
dams. It was like a chink in the system’s wall into which 
the opposition could wedge its demolition axe, held at 
the ready. 
Protestors marched en masse down the streets of 
Budapest and along the banks beside Nagymaros. 
Anybody who had anything to do with the project was 
declared a Stalinist, or worse, a traitor to his country. As 
public pressure intensified, the Hungarian government 
decided to suspend the half-finished construction. The 
culmination came in 1990 when the right-wing 
government took power and unilaterally cancelled the 
treaty.

STRIKING PEACE ON TROUBLED WATERS 
 
But the Czechoslovak side paid no heed to the 
Hungarians and carried on with the work further 
upstream. The authorities unilaterally decided to divert 
a 25-kilometre stretch of the Danube, which served as 
part of the border between the two countries, into its 
own territory, where another dam was built to replace 
the one intended for Hungary. Gabcikovo would not be 
as powerful as planned,but it would be operational. 
Fish in the mud 
Protest marches similar to those in 
Hungary had no effect.History was not 
on the demonstrators’ side. As 
Czechoslovakia divided into two parts, 
Slovakia came to see Gabcikovo as the 
symbol of their independent state, born in 
1993. 
By the end of October 1992, the 3 
Danube was diverted and the main J 
channel stretching across Hungarian : 
territory suddenly lost 90 to 95 percent of 
its water. Signs indicating the river’s water 
level were left standing on dry land. 
Groundwater levels in surrounding areas 
dropped by two or three metres days after 
the Danube stopped feeding its streams. 
Fish were trapped in the old basin, left to 
asphyxiate in the mud. 
The Hungarians could not believe 
the drama unfolding before them. 
Extremist elements spoke of blowing up 
the obstructing dam. Fortunately, this 
threat was soon replaced by negotiations 
fostered by the European Community, 
which was already panicked by 
bloodshed in the Balkans. Both sides sat 
down to talk, yet the balance of power was skewed in 
Slovakia’s favour. With firm control of the lion’s share 
of the river’s water supply and energy output, it took 
little notice of Hungarian wishes. In April 1993, the 
dispute was submitted to the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague. 
In 1994, the Socialists came back into power in 
Hungary but could hardly back out of the court case, 
which was hailed as a landmark:for the first time, the 
court would rule over an environmental dispute. But 
this case was about politics, not water. And so the court 
handed down an ambiguous decision in 1997, which 
both parties could interpret to their advantage. The 
1977 treaty was still valid, according to the ruling, but 
each side was at fault for acting unilaterally—Hungary 
for pulling out and Slovakia for continuing with the 
construction. They were called upon to negotiate in 
good faith. Even though the court had no way of 
enforcing its ruling, both sides returned to the 
negotiating table. Anxious to join the European Union, 
the two governments wanted to show their wealthy 
Western neighbours that they could resolve their 
disputes in a civilized manner. The outline of a mutually

acceptable agreement was drawn up to finally complete 
the project and resolve key environmental concerns. 
Once again, politics intervened. Hungary's right- 
wing opposition joined forces with the “storming” 
Greens and together they organized mass 
demonstrations. For a second time in less than a decade, 
they managed to use the same weapons to force the 
government to back down. Yet this time, the Socialist

Weak resolve 
In their manifesto, the right-wing elements at the 
helm of the new government promised to remedy the 
Danube. Yet three and a half years later, not a single 
worthy step has been taken. Hungary has however, 
been spending millions of dollars to take down the 
half-built dam and might be forced to spend millions 
more to compensate Slovakia for pulling out of the 
deal. There is talk of forming more committees or 
returning to the International Court of Justice—a sure 
sign that both countries are still not committed to 
resolving the situation. Their true colours will inevitably 
show soon—both will hold parliamentary elections in 
2002. 
Take a stroll along the two banks of the Danubian 
basin today and you will see that the Gabcikovo region 
in Slovakia is thriving, while on the Hungarian side, the 
land which was supposed to store water has been 
overrun by weeds. And the Danube? The Danube

with ice, so the surge of water was diverted as it is 
every winter towards the Aidarkul Basin. 
This has been going on for three decades, with 
more water each year. Greater use of hydro- 
electricity in winter means the power stations 
discharge a lot of waste water downstream. As a 
result, the basin, which was once a desert, has 
turned into a huge and useless lake that is 
200 kilometres long and 30 km wide, and which 
contains 16 km® of water that would otherwise 
have flowed into the Aral Sea, where it is badly 
needed.! 
Trading off 
water and gas 
This year’s “revenge” flooding was the biggest 
ever. It lasted two weeks, yet drew only a few 
complaints from the Uzbeks. The Kirghiz replied, 
tongue in cheek, that after releasing so much 
water they could no longer guarantee a supply in 
the summer. The response from Tashkent, the 
Uzbek capital, was swift. Five days later, the two 
countries sat down to negotiate. Ten days after 
that, I had gas in my kitchen again. 
The media was pessimistic about the talks. 
But on July 12, it was announced that “the water 
problem has been solved.” The deputy prime 
ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and 
Uzbekistan signed an agreement for the “sensible 
use of water and energy resources.” Even though 
this “understanding” was limited to a year’s 
duration and was drawn up by purely technocratic 
ministries, it opened the door to multilateral 
exchanges instead of the previously annual 
bilateral accords. In exchange for electricity and 
water from Kyrgyzstan, the Kazakhs will provide 
400,000 tonnes of coal and the Uzbeks an 
undisclosed quantity of gas. 
But the big event came a few days later. A law 
published in Bishkek on July 29 about “the inter- 
governmental use of water resources, dams and 
other water-related installations” took the region 
into a whole new era. Modelled on the 1992 Dublin 
Declaration, the law stated that “water has an 
economic value in all its competing uses and should

Water always

egend has it that at the time of the pharaohs, 
the people of Egypt sent gifts up the Nile to 
the kingdom of Ethiopia to placate the Gods 
that fed the river’s source. Egypt had, and 
remains to have, good reason to be grateful: 
some 86 percent of the water that flows down the Blue 
Nile to irrigate the arid North African country emanates 
from floodplains on Ethiopian territory. 
Yet the one-way river flow between Egypt and 
Ethiopia—as might be expected between a country that 
craves water and a country that supplies it for free—has 
not always resulted in such harmonious exchanges of 
gifts. In 1979, Egypt’s then president Anwar Sadat made 
the Nile’s fate into an urgent issue of national security. 
“The only matter that could take Egypt to war again is 
water,” he said in reference to Ethiopia’s plans to tap into 
its one precious natural asset. 
The potential for conflict over the water is 
undeniable. Some 95 percent of the Egyptian 
population is packed onto the fertile ribbon of land 
along the banks of the Nile and its delta, the country’s 
only water sources of note. Desperately poor and 
underdeveloped Ethiopia, in contrast, has suffered 
periodic droughts since the 1970s, causing the loss of 
millions of lives. The Blue Nile!, emerging largely from 
Lake Tana in the Ethiopian highlands, has long been 
eyed as a possible source for irrigation, hydroelectricity 
and general economic growth in a country whose 
population is set to boom. At present, Ethiopia 
consumes a mere two percent of the water available to 
it. 
Water distribution between the two African 
neighbours has always had a political edge, but by the 
time of Sadat’s sabre-rattling remarks, a different 
rivalry was poisoning relations. After flirting for a 
decade with the United States, Ethiopia found itself 
ruled in the 1970s by Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam’s 
Marxist regime. Soviet experts invited by the colonel 
began studying the feasibility of damming the Nile’s 
tributaries and exploiting its water, provoking Egypt 
into threatening that any dams built would be 
destroyed by military force. 
“Although such threats gave rise to the commonly 
held notion that future African wars would be over 
water, the fact is that these tensions were a spin-off of 
the Cold War,” argues Rushdie Saeed, one of Egypt’s

### 123762: Taming the Nile's serpents

the Nile’s serpents 
Guzzled by Egypt but generated in Ethiopia, the waters of the Blue Nile 
have long been a source of sabre-rattling. A new plan might finally put 
most prominent experts on water issues. 
Since the end of the Cold War, however, the Nile 
waters have continued to prompt regular diplomatic 
spats. The early 1990s, for example, saw Sudan and 
Egypt at loggerheads following alleged efforts by the 
Sudanese government to overthrow Egypt’s president, 
Hosni Mubarak.Sudan and Ethiopia formed a joint 
Blue Nile Valley Organization and pledged to study 
several major infrastructure projects with or without 
Egypt’s approval. Once again, Mubarak resorted to 
threats of military intervention. 
Though a marked improvement in relations 
between Cairo and Khartoum has since calmed nerves, 
diplomats and experts are convinced that only a lasting 
settlement will bring peace to the Nile’s coveted waters. 
Until now, only one agreement has been signed by 
Egypt and its neighbours—the Nile Waters Agreement 
of 1959 between Sudan and Egypt, itself based on a 
deal made by the region’s colonial powers in 1929. 
Ethiopia was not even mentioned in the accord. 
Yet the case for some more equitable distribution 
of the river waters is mounting by the day. Besides

### 123762: Taming the Nile's serpents

STRIKING PEACE ON TROUBLED WATERS 
 
Ethiopia’s traumatic droughts and destitution, studies 
point to a staggering rise in the country’s population: 
current data suggest that the population will increase 
from 61.4 million at present to 186 million in 2050. 
Given that only 1.7 percent of the country’s arable 
land is irrigated (compared to 100 percent of Egypt’s), 
an exponential rise in demand for water is only to be 
expected. 
A durable solution might not be too far off. In 
July of this year, and after five years of preliminary 
talks, the 10 states of the Nile basin—including Egypt, 
the Sudan and Ethiopia—announced that they had 
secured World Bank money for a series of programmes 
to explore how the river’s waters can best be shared. 
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) has launched several 
such studies, due to be followed by loans worth at 
least three billion dollars 
Thrashing out 
differences 
“The River Nile still has a great potential which is 
not yet exploited and which can be a great benefit to 
the people of the Nile basin,” said Egypt’s minister of 
public works, Mahmoud Abu Zied, in a recent 
interview. “Each country is entitled to an equitable 
share from the river without causing appreciable harm 
to the other riparian states” 
Underpinning the initiative is the experience of 
states surrounding the Mekong River in Southeast 
Asia. Since 1957, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and 
Thailand have been members of a commission charged 
with economic development of the river basin. Despite 
15 re 
bw SS 
hard hit by periodic droughts since the 1970s. 
political differences between the 
nations and an absence of formal 
treaties, the body has helped 
convert the Mekong into a source 
of regional integration instead of 
rivalry: the Nam Ngum 
hydropower plant,completed in 
Laos in 1971, provided electricity 
to the home country and covered 
80 percent of Thailand’s needs, 
even during the violent conflicts 
that followed inauguration. 
With this precedent in mind, 
the World Bank hopes the Nile’s 
waters might usher in a similar 
spirit of co-operation. Which is 
not to say that members of the 
programme have been pulling 
their punches. “There are 
questions such as how to 
calculate future quotas. Should 
it be according to the size of the 
territory or the size of the 
population, or possibly the 
availability of other water 
resources?,” wondered one 
Egyptian official who took part in 
arecent NBI meeting in Geneva. 
“We all have different ideas for 
answers and this remains to be 
resolved.” 
Ethiopia has already started 
building a series of small dams 
to tap the Blue Nile water. 
According to officials involved in the projects, these 
dams will benefit nations downstream by protecting 
Sudan from over-flooding and reducing the silt 
accumulation suffered by Lake Nasser dam in Egypt. 
But Egypt’s Saeed is unconvinced by their arguments. 
He insists that it is in fact more dangerous for the silt 
to be stopped than for it to flow with the water: should 
the former occur, he says, the river might gain in energy 
and cause havoc in the northern reaches of the Nile. 
Saeed also takes issue with Ethiopia’s claims that 
the new dams will enable the government to sell 
electricity to neighbouring countries. “Which countries 
Ethiopian officials have had in mind is difficult to 
determine, however, as none of Ethiopia’s neighbours 
are industrialized nations or great consumers of 
electricity,” he observes. 
All parties now admit, however, that their 
differences of opinion are better thrashed out at the 
negotiating table than left to the generals. What 
promised to be Africa’s next war might just have 
become Africa’s latest remedy. [|

egional cooperation appears difficult to

since 1947, clashes on the Indo-Bangladesh 
border and accusations about India’s 
overwhelming influence. When the South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was 
established in the 1980s to provide a forum for 
discussion primarily on trade, contentious topics like 
water resource negotiations were totally excluded from

and technical co-operation. 
Countries had one precedent in the field. The

### 123766: South Asia: sharing the giants

STRIKING PEACE ON TROUBLED WATERS 
 
demonstrates how functional cooperation on both 
sides is not impossible to achieve, though most other 
contentious issues remain deadlocked. 
New breakthroughs were made in the 1990s over 
water-sharing in the region. In December 1996, 
recently elected governments in both India and 
Bangladesh decided to resolve decades of acrimony 
over the sharing of the waters from the Ganges, one 
of the most culturally and economically significant 
rivers on earth. The breakthrough came after years of 
political stalemate and bitter rhetoric at the public 
level, alongside quiet work behind the scenes by 
water specialists, politicians and scholars on both 
sides at the non-governmental level. The result was the 
30-year India-Bangladesh water-sharing agreement, 
signed in 1996. 
Bangladesh, being in the downstream and delta 
portion of a huge watershed, has been most vulnerable 
to the water quality and quantity that flows from 
upstream. The way rivers are used in one country can 
indeed have far-reaching effects on nations 
downstream. 
When India built the Farakka Barrage in the 
1960s, Bangladesh (then East Pakistan until its 
independence in 1971), watched helplessly as it 
wreaked havoc. In the dry season, the barrage blocked 
the natural flow of water into the country, causing 
drastic water shortages. And in the rainy season, 
sudden water releases caused floods and extensive 
damage, including the loss of property and human 
lives. 
Early warning 
systems 
The principal objective of the 30-year treaty is to 
determine the amount of water released by India to 
Bangladesh at the Farakka Barrage. The water-sharing 
arrangements, primarily for the dry season, are 
specified to the last drop and depend on the river’s 
flow. It aims to make “optimum utilization” of the 
waters of the region,and relies on the principles of 
“equity, fair play and no harm to either party,” with a 
clause for the sharing arrangements to be reviewed 
every five years. 
Spurred on by the success of this treaty, India 
resolved yet another riverine dispute, this time with 
Nepal, in 1997. The Mahakali River treaty settles 
Nepal’s entitlement to water flows and electricity 
from the Indian side, improving on a 1992 agreement. 
The treaty, however, has run into opposition from 
various Nepali groups, who claim it is still unfair to the 
country’s interests. 
Although these various agreements point to 
steady regional cooperation on water-sharing, 
another dispute may be looming on the horizon. 
This time, it centers on the Brahmaputra,the other 
great river of this region,which flows through Tibet 
(China), India and Bangladesh over a distance of 
nearly 3,000 kilometres. Although no dispute has 
broken into the open, the issue of information sharing 
has strained relations between the three countries. 
The problem is that even the most basic data is not 
disclosed. 
The results have been tragic. In the summer of 
2000, a landslide in Tibet caused a dam to collapse, 
unleashing a 26-metre wall of water that destroyed 
every bridge on the Siang, as the Brahmaputra is 
known in the Indian border state of Arunachal 
Pradesh. The water then rushed through the Indian 
state of Assam and, within a week devastated parts 
of Bangladesh. Human casualties were light but 
damage to property was extensive. An effective

Concern is also being voiced about purported

a Chinese move to assess international reaction to the 
possibility of a dam on the river to tap its huge hydro- 
energy potential. 
Cooperation on river waters could significantly 
improve the lives of millions of people. In the case of 
the Brahmaputra, it is not so much a question of 
sharing the waters as of tapping the waterway 
profitably for mutual benefit, primarily for transport, 
commerce and industry.

ust nod with a smile and maybe your companion 
from the Water Affairs Department won’t notice 
the confusion. Driving north into the vast spaces 
of Namibia, you keep missing the rivers he spots. 
“And this is the Okahanja River,” he says. 
Another blank nod. “And here we have the famous 
Omatako. It may look small but this river can be very 
powerful.” Look small? Look where? The patient Greg 
Christelis is gushing with tales of flash floods, yet all you 
see 1s a cracked and sandy track in the bush, when 
suddenly, what used to be dry facts and figures about 
erratic rainfall and aridity come rushing back—Namibia 
doesn’t have any regular or perennial rivers to call its 
own.*

underground secrets 
Namibia almost came to blows with Botswana over plans to divert 
a river, but the answer may lie just beneath the surface of the driest 
Namibian landscape. Groundwater is already providing 
for about half of the country’s needs and its role will 
increase as the population grows and droughts hit 
harder and more frequently with predicted climate 
change. Yet this invisible resource is just breaking the 
surface of the country’s national and regional priorities. 
“For the past ten years, we've focused on 
negotiating protocols [agreements] for international 
rivers like the Zambezi, which involved eight states. But 
we ignored groundwater, even through we have 
aquifers running across national boundaries,” says Dr. 
Serge Puyoo, a French geohydrologist working with the 
Southern African Development Community (SADC). 
Think of aquifers as a lattice of rock, whose cracks, 
crooks and crannies are filled with water. Sometimes 
the water is from recent rain which seeped down 
through the soil. Other aquifers only contain fossil 
water, rain of bygone geological eras. Depending upon 
various factors—from the type of rock to the pull of 
gravity—the water can slowly 
flow within the aquifer and

A dehydrated capital 
In Namibia—the driest country south of the 
Sahara—water scarcity and unpredictability form a 
constant constraint on national development. Average 
annual rainfall is 250 mm compared to 1,400 mm in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example. A 
corner of the country can receive double the average 
rainfall one season and nothing for years after. And the 
little that does fall doesn’t stay for long:83 percent is 
lost to evaporation, plants soak up and then sweat 
another 14 percent back into the atmosphere, leaving 
just two percent to run off those mysteriously 
ephemeral rivers and one percent to infiltrate rock 
underground. 
That single digit, however, may transform the

managers are unaware of the potential and limits of the 
resource, until they are faced with a crisis.” 
That is exactly what happened in 1996-97, when 
severe drought brought Namibia's capital, Windhoek, 
to its knees and the country close to the brink of war 
with neighbouring Botswana, according to sensational 
media reports. Simmering tensions over disputed 
borders added fuel to the fire surrounding Namibia’s 
plan to divert part of the Okavango River, which 
originates in Angola before carving the border with 
Namibia and then snaking into Botswana to feed the 
“jewel of the Kalahari.” In this vast wetland, traditional 
communities weave around a wealth of biodiversity 
and wildlife that tourist operators milk for foreign 
currency, amounting to ten percent of the country’s 
gross domestic product. 
For ecologists in Botswana, the river was sacred. 
But in Namibia, those shining waters appeared as a

saviour, prompting civil engineers like Piet Heyns to 
update an old scheme to pipe about one or two percent 
of the average flow to dehydrated Windhoek. The 
capital was in crisis—ordinarily three dams would 
store enough water to keep the city running for a few 
years. Two were almost empty and the third was 
collecting dust. Officials were digging holes in a 
desperate search for more groundwater, while 
municipal authorities set up an electric sign to count 
down the days remaining of supply in the dams. By the 
time it hit 30,the government prepared to divert the 
Okavango. Then, without warning, it rained... 
Rolling back 
apartheid’s legacy 
Today, the plans for the pipeline still sit within 
reach of Piet Heyns, who is now director of Water 
Affairs and Namibia's representative to the Permanent 
Okavango River Basin Water Commission, which is 
supposed to resolve the dispute over the river. Heyns 
and his counterpart in Botswana, Balisi Khupe, speak 
of glowing plans for joint studies and monitoring. Yet 
according to some experts involved, the commission is 
mired in bureaucratic gridlock. The delay may prove 
beneficial, however, as Namibia moves with the 
international current running against building new 
dams and their hefty price-tags. 
Instead of grabbing for rivers, the government is 
looking underground to economize its reserves, notably 
by building the largest water bank on the continent. The 
aim is to plug the holes in the three dams, partly 
connected by an open canal running more than 
250 kilometres in the bushy savannah, where 
substantial amounts literally vanish as vapour. In 1997, 
for example, the three dams supplied Windhoek with 
about 15.7 million cubic metres (Mm?) of water. Yet the 
system lost 33.5 Mm? to evaporation. Instead of letting

Namibia is removing the vestiges of apartheid’s control (315-250 B.C) 
over its natural resources 11 years after independence 
from South Africa.“There was so much money flowing 
in from South Africa that we did major infrastructure 
projects without proper study,” says Greg Christelis, 
chief geohydrologist at Water Affairs. The problem 
may not have been the quantity of money flowing in, 
but the direction it took: straight to wealthy white 
folk in Windhoek and the surrounding cattle country, 
where the average livestock farm, fattened by subsidies,

Namibia is not alone in trying to roll back the 
hydrological legacy of apartheid. South Africa is in 
the lead, passing the world’s most progressive water law 
to ensure fair and sustainable use of the resource at 
home and abroad. With 80 percent of its river (surface)

aquifers from a scientific, legal and management perspective. A new project will not only 
highlight important case studies like the Karoo, but develop maps and a database on how 
best to manage and monitor transboundary aquifers. The project has several partners, 
notably the IAH, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the UN Economic Commission 
for Europe. [|

this is probably the one 
natural resource that has 
managed to avoid 
international regulation. 
Countries spent decades 
hammering out a UN 
convention on international 
rivers, yet they barely 
discussed deep aquifers 
Instead of trying to forge 
formal agreements, 
international organizations 
like UNESCO are promoting data exchange and joint 
monitoring between countries (see box). Namibia, 
Botswana and South Africa are now mapping an 
enormous sequence of aquifers, known as the Karoo, 
which spreads across the Kalahari into all three 
countries. The initial hope was that the investigations 
would uncover phenomenal supplies of water in 
Namibia that could serve as an alternative to the 
controversial Okavango scheme. On the contrary, the 
Namibian side appears to be on the decline, according 
to Jurgen Kirchner, who is helping to coordinate a 
major study financed and led by the Japan International 
Cooperation Agency that focused on the country’s 
most important swathe of Karoo, known as Stampriet 
and covering an area of 65,000 kilometres®. The two 
ephemeral rivers which most experts used to believe 
fed the aquifer seem to dead-end in sand dunes. The 
only apparent source of recharge is rainfall collecting 
in sinkholes, or indents in the topography, according to 
recent satellite images. 
 
    
Trouble in cattle country 
The bad news is more destabilizing within the 
country than across the borders. In South Africa,the 
aquifer sits beneath a national park, which requires 
little water. Demand is also low in Botswana, where few 
people are willing to brave the remote Kalahari, 
although this may eventually change as traffic increases 
along a new highway crossing the desert. 
The real conflict is brewing in Stampriet, which, says 
Kirchner, must reduce its water use by 30 percent. 
This prognosis will ricochet like a bullet in this rolling 
land, with crests of red sand. This isn’t just any stretch 
of cattle country, but a bastion of wealthy white farmers 
who believe that they are the backbone of a land they 
love but a country they seem to fear and even hate. 
The Unesco Courier - October 2001 
Stampriet is the home of a “tough breed,” says 
Willie Prinsloo, a legendary driller who dug for water 
and minerals across southern Africa before retiring to 
his farm, Donnersberg or Thunder Mountain, where he 
raises livestock and wildlife for trophy hunting on 
7,500 hectares. The one-eyed Willie runs the farm like 
a ship, overseeing every watering hole for cattle and 
vegetable planted in the plot he shares with his four 
labourers, who live in tidy cottages behind his own 
home. Banish the thought that he and his brethren 
are depleting the aquifer, says Prinsloo. Fault lies with 
the government—for it refuses to replace the farmers’ 
boreholes, the old rusty metal pipes installed decades 
ago to bring up the groundwater. To reach the Karoo, 
the boreholes must first pass through another aquifer 
which tends to have very salty water. Holes in the 
pipes enable this saline stuff to sink down and pollute 
the clean Karoo. 
Communal wisdom 
The government, however, has a new policy in 
which people pay for the water services and 
infrastructure. In the north, nomadic herding 
communities are helping to install new pumps and 
should one day pay for the water they use. Might the 
same apply to Stampriet? 
The question provokes a torrent of what many 
would consider racism, as Prinsloo expounds on the 
benefits of colonialism.Beneath the old hatred lies a 
new fear:government plans to spread the wealth by 
land taxes and water metres. Here in the Kalahari, 
you can still feel the heat from Robert Mugabe's 
Zimbabwe, so few dare to place the word “land before 
“redistribution.” But the government is slowly buying 
commercial (generally white) farms from willing sellers 
to ease pressure in the northern communal areas, 
which are in many ways like a separate country, divided 
by a three-metre-high fence from the commercial 
cattle farms of men like Prinsloo. 
According to the Japanese study, about five percent 
of Stampriet’s 1,500 farms are now government-owned. 
So not only must the Afrikaner brethren cut down on 
their water consumption, but they can also prepare for 
more and new neighbours. Yet Stampriet’s farmers 
are probably the only ones in the country to use half 
their expensive groundwater to grow commercial 
crops. For economists, this is like throwing gold away— 
every cubic metre of water invested in irrigation 
brought in just half a Namibian dollar (U.S. $0.06). 
For the sake of the Karoo, Stampriet’s newcomers 
hopefully won’t follow the “commercial”ways of the 
“tough breed”next door. [|

tseemed absolutely improbable, bordering 
on the impossible,” U.S. Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt said last January in reference 
to a water accord reached among seven of 
the southwestern U.S. states after five tough 
years of negotiation. The challenge he faced in brokering 
this agreement is one shared by many senior 
administrators around 
the world. As increasing 
scarcity exacerbates water 
conflicts within and among 
countries, water nego- 
tiations will inevitably grow 
in scope and intensity 
almost everywhere. 
In a thirsty world, 
water can no longer be 
regarded primarily as a 
“strategic asset” that can 
be secured and 
safeguarded through the 
instruments of 
conventional security, least 
of all through the use of 
force. As with atmospheric 
pollution leading to ozone 
depletion and climate 
change, or with the 
depletion of renewable 
resources such as fish 
stocks and forests, water 
disputes involve a whole range of political,economic, 
social and scientific considerations. The challenge lies in 
finding and maintaining a balance between political 
and technical priorities. To this end, the United Nations 
has developed a framework convention to guide fresh 
water negotiations—which 10 states have ratified out of 
the 35 required for the treaty to come into force. 
National governments are, however, increasingly turning 
to an alternative form of negotiation involving neutral 
mediators, who work closely with international 
organizations, development banks, and a wide cross 
section of groups concerned about the future of water 
use. 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its 1999 
i 
- 
annual report, offered to mediate regional water 
disputes as part of a policy to increase access to clean 
water in Asia. And the work of the World Commission 
on Dams is cited by many as a remarkable feat of 
consensus building between widely divergent interests 
around a highly controversial development issue. 
From these experiments and other environmental 
negotiations, we can 
highlight some key 
principles and “best 
practices” in water 
negotiations. 
Finding a 
unified voice 
To begin with,it is not 
always obvious who 
should be at the 
negotiation table. The 
standard response is for 
national governments to 
treat water as a foreign 
policy matter, and thus to 
charge their top-level 
diplomats with working 
out bi- or multi-lateral 
agreements. It is a mistake, 
however, not to include a 
host of non-governmental 
actors in these 
negotiations (farmers, 
industry, environmental and women’s groups, etc.), 
whose activities directly affect the condition of a 
watershed, and whose livelihoods depend on the 
resource. These groups, along with local authorities and 
indigenous groups, can offer relevant technical and 
traditional knowledge necessary to mitigate the 
stresses and strains suffered by a water system. 
To be effective, these groups must be sufficiently 
organized to speak with something approaching a 
unified voice. So even before the larger dialogue 
begins, each group must work out its differences 
through internal consultations which should continue 
throughout the negotiation process. This ongoing 
feedback forestalls the tendency of negotiators to

lock into a position before hearing what others have 
to say. Just to be certain that all of the key actors are 
involved, an impartial mediator should conduct a 
series of confidential interviews with all the key 
stakeholders to clarify their concerns and identify 
additional players that should be included. 
Finding the key people is only one element in 
preparing for negotiations. Mediators should also 
play a role in “joint fact-finding” by helping to identify 
experts acceptable to everyone involved and by 
framing questions that these scientists should then 
be commissioned to investigate. Their findings can 
help reduce uncertainties and set priorities that may 
differ from country to country so that an overall 
“package” of proposals can be 
crafted. They can also help to Water negotiations 
think that the costs of adherence outweigh the benefits. 
Others favour the theory that most nations observe 
most international law principles and obligations most 
of the time, if only to avoid the “shaming”campaigns 
orchestrated by non-governmental organizations. But 
even the optimists readily acknowledge that many 
factors other than willful disregard get in the way of 
perfect compliance. The vague language of many legal 
rules, for examples, is a problem. In addition, some 
states simply don’t have the capacity—technically or 
financially—to do what they have promised. 
These constraints must be kept in mind when 
transforming informal understandings into binding 
contracts. There are a few important ways of enabling 
agreements to adjust over time to 
changing circumstances and new

actual negotiations can begin. 
After a mediator prepares a 
written conflict assessment to create an overview of the 
parties’ interests and priorities, face-to-face meetings 
can begin. They usually start with the business of 
setting an agenda and adopting procedural 
groundrules that will allow for constructive 
deliberation—or the “creation of value”—in an 
atmosphere that emphasizes creative problem-solving. 
No party is ever pressured to commit or to 
compromise in well-managed mediation. At stage 
three it is time to decide—or “distribute value.” The 
challenge here is to make sure that the goodwill 
previously generated isn’t lost as parties fight for 
competing proposals. Once an agreement on the 
substance is reached informally, the mediator must 
then be certain that it is communicated accurately to 
the official decision-makers. 
Still waiting 
for the “Green Helmets” 
In treaty-making, much of the focus is on the 
painstaking task of drafting written agreements. Yet, 
in the global arena, the resulting provisions are 
typically difficult if not impossible to legally enforce. 
Calls for an international water court are unlikely to 
be heeded in the near future. Nor is deployment of 
“Green Helmets”—a kind of environmental 
counterpart to the existing blue-helmeted United 
Nations peacekeeping forces—feasible. International 
relations theorists and lawyers hotly debate the 
propensity of states to comply with treaty obligations. 
Some subscribe to the Machiavellian notion that 
nations flout norms with impunity whenever they

and largesse will not be taken 
advantage of by laggards. 
Penalties might also be levied in the case of non- 
compliance, or rewards might be agreed upon ahead 
of time for each step completed as promised. 
Finally, any effective agreement requires the active 
engagement of actors operating on the ground. Water 
negotiations can no longer be left solely to elected 
leaders. The conversation must be broadened. We 
also need greater transparency with regard to decision- 
making and greater rigour with regard to the scientific 
basis underlying the agreements reached. These are the 
key lessons learned from the two-decade long 
experience with environmental treaty-making and 
negotiation efforts. [|

### 123769: On the tracks of a global vice

  
Twenty years of ever-faster financial 
transactions, spurred by deregulation 
and the rise of electronic 
communications, has turned money 
gained from criminal activities into a 
source of political and financial 
instability. And money embezzled 
through corruption has gone hand-in- 
hand with the money made by organized 
crime. 
“These two kinds of crime feed off 
each other, hiding and recycling their 
profits in the same way,” says Daniel 
Dommel, president of the French branch 
of the NGO Transparency International. 
“To stay out of sight, organized crime 
uses corruption, which weakens 
institutional safeguards against such 
criminals.” 
In recent years, several scandals have 
revealed the extent of the scourge. In 
the summer of 1998, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) lent Russia eight 
billion dollars to stave off the collapse of 
the ruble. Benyamin Sokolov, Russia’s 
chief auditor, told a BBC interviewer in 
November that year:“We have looked 
into what happened to some of the IMF 
money and we have to admit that several 
billion dollars did not go to the 
programmes they were earmarked for. 
Some of it was simply stolen.”

A The Unesco Courier - October 2001 
The following summer, the biggest 
money-laundering scandal in U.S. history 
erupted,with the Bank of New York at 
its centre. According to the FBI, the 
Russian mafia used this venerable 
financial institution to funnel $10 billion 
back into the Russian economy after its 
passage through the tiny Pacific island- 
state of Nauru, famous for “offshore” 
banks that ask few questions of their 
customers. 
“Forty years ago, just one place in the 
world, Switzerland, guaranteed secrecy 
for its banking clients, but today there 
are more than 50 such countries,” says 
Yves Mény, head of the Robert 
Schumann Centre at the European 
University Institute in Florence and 
author of Democracy and Corruption in 
Europe (Cassell, London, 1996). 
Monitoring financial movements, 
particularly through tax havens, is now 
one of the main features of the battle 
against corruption. 
An annual 
blacklist 
The Financial Action Task Force on 
Money Laundering (FATF), which grew 
out of meetings of the G-8 countries and 
is based at the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and

s 
Development (OECD), has since 2000 
published an annual blacklist of the most 
financially suspect countries, sending a 
sharp jolt through the genteel world of 
international finance. 
“We want to get all banking centres, 
including the least willing, to conform 
to international standards,” says FATF 
executive secretary Patrick Moulette. 
“We're exerting constructive pressure 
on all of them, whether they're tax 
havens like the Marshall Islands, 
Dominica and Nauru,or countries such 
as Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Russia. 
Note that we're removing Russia from 
our blacklist of 17 countries because it 
passed a law this summer imposing 
tighter controls on its banking system.” 
Economic interests are also pressing 
international organizations to crack 
down on corruption. But not for moral 
reasons. Firms operating in the 
international arena—from construction 
to water supplies—are horrified by the 
demands for ever-bigger kickbacks. 
The bribing game 
“Economic liberalization has sent 
the cost of bribes skyrocketing, but few 
have noticed,” says Rob Jenkins, who 
teaches political science at Birbeck 
College (London). “During public sector 
privatization, prospective buyers fight 
each other to bribe politicians and civil 
servants. And with each new reform, 
firms that want to have a say in drafting 
the new rules or simply want to know 
what the rules will be, are forced to make 
pay-offs without getting any guarantees 
inreturn. I've seen that in every country 
where I've looked at economic reform— 
in India,South Africa and Uganda.lt is 
ironic that in the early 1980s, the IMF 
and the World Bank promised that their 
liberalization programmes would reduce 
the power of bureaucracy and thereby 
stamp out the source of corruption.” 
To eradicate this kind of crime, the 
OECD in 1997 drew up a Convention 
on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public 
Officials in International Business 
Transactions, which has been signed so 
far by 33 countries. “Its main point is 
simple,” explains Dommel. “It bans firms 
in the signatory states from paying 
kickbacks to foreign officials. Until a 
few years ago, such “commissions” were 
tolerated in many countries. In France, 
for example, they were officially tax- 
deductible. It was compared to going to

confession in church.” 
The Convention’s many critics say it 
is a step in the right direction, but far 
from enough. “It seems absurd to 
condemn bribing an official of a 
government-owned airline and then shut 
your eyes to a kickback paid to an official 
of a private one,” says Stuart Eizenstat, 
former U.S. under-secretary of state in 
the Clinton administration. 
His comments are especially 
pertinent at a time when the economic 
fashion is to privatize public services. 
Benoit Dejemeppe, a state prosecutor 
in Brussels and a corruption expert, 
notes that the OECD convention is 
largely based on the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, which U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter pushed through Congress 
in 1977 in the wake of the Lockheed 
bribery scandal that rocked governments 
in Europe and Japan.“In over 20 years, 
only four major corruption scandals have 
led to criminal convictions,” he says, “so 
I conclude the law isn’t strict enough.” 
A third “mandate” against 
corruption comes from civil society, 
which has shown increasing concern 
about the murky relationship between 
politics and money. “In the process of 
worldwide ‘quasi-democratization’ and 
global access to information, what people 
want above all else is transparency,” says 
Jenkins. 
Eluding all 
control 
Until the end of the Cold War, the 
major political movements upheld 
widely contrasting ideologies;how they 
were financed was seen as less important. 
Today, in contrast, institutional political 
debate boils down to minor differences 
over how to apply broadly similar 
economic programmes, all requiring big 
sacrifices by most of the population.So 
it is no accident that anti-corruption 
campaigners have emerged at the same 
time as economic austerity in Western 
Europe, financial crises in Southeast Asia 
and Latin America, and structural 
adjustment programmes in many poor 
countries. 
But the slowness of the anti- 
corruption process, the problems 
investigators come up against as they 
try to trace international networks, the 
rarity and lightness of the penalties— 
all have helped in fostering a good dose 
of cynicism. French journalist Denis 
Robert has published several books 
about corruption scandals. His latest, 
(Révélation$) written with Ernest 
Baeckes, is about how a Luxembourg- 
based clearinghouse called Clearstream 
operates. Such institutions are vital to 
the business of banking since they 
catalogue all transactions and list the 
people who make them. They 
nevertheless encourage anonymity and 
elude all control. 
An insult to the poor 
“The very word ‘corruption,’ if it 
means a departure from the legal rules, 
is no longer appropriate,” says Robert. 
“It’s the system that’s corrupt. And the 
institutions never react until long 
afterwards. As Spanish judge Baltasar 
Garzon said, the fight against corruption 
is a fight between a mammoth and a 
leopard.” 
The battle is not only uneven but is 
being waged in thick fog according to 
five European judges, all anti-corruption 
experts, who wrote an article in the 
French daily Le Monde last May, soon 
after Robert’s book came out. “The main 
thing that emerges from this 
investigation,” they wrote, “is the 
deafening silence of those responsible for 
the system that is in the dock.... The 
tactic of hiding one’s head in the sand 
might suggest that the book was a 
pointless exercise. But we think that it’s 
only just started to tell the true story.... 
The book should help Europeans 
understand what clearinghouses do and 
throw new light on the globalization of 
finance.” 
The effectiveness of different ways to 
fight corruption is still being debated. 
But everyone at least agrees on what 
the enemy is. Even James Wolfensohn, 
the Australian president of the World 
Bank, raised the then taboo subject 
inside the Bank in 1996. He called 
corruption a serious “cancer” that 
“insulted the poorest people by diverting 
money to the richest.” | 
1. Author of Arthashastra, a famous 
philosophical treatise. He was adviser 
THE SIZE OF WORLD CORRUPTION 
efore you can measure corruption, you have to know what it is. The United Nations and the World 
Bank have adopted the sober definition offered by Transparency International, which calls it “the 
misuse of public power for private profit.” 
But even its authors recognize the limits of this description since it takes no account of private sector 
corruption. To understand this, it's best to look at how graft works in practice. A bribe, according to 
the English dictionary, is “a sum of money or other favour, given to someone in authority so as to 
influence their opinions or behaviour” 
Putting a figure on the amount of corruption in the world is very hard but also irresistible. Patrick 
Moulette, executive secretary of FATF (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering), says 
there is “no financial basis to measure the extent of this illegal activity. All the figures given are fictitious 
and unscientific.” 
FATF documents, however, cite the International Monetary Fund's estimate of $80 billion a year. In 
comparison, the total of criminally-acquired capital is reckoned at between $500 and $1,500 
billion—two to five percent of the gross world production. 
Case studies are a much more accurate guide. One in Milan,conducted before and after Operation 
Mani Pulite (Clean Hands),showed that the city’s public works budget had been inflated by 30 to 
40 percent. The airport extension project, for example, could have been cut from 2,610 billion lire ($1.1 
billion) to 1,990 billion ($860 million). 
Transparency International has in the past few years published a Corruption Perception Index (CPI), 
and more recently, an index of corruption in exporting countries, the Bribe Payers Perceptions Index 
(BPI).Both are based on rigorous opinion polls among businessmen, financial analysts, journalists 
and sometimes the general public. They are not exhaustive (not every country is represented) and 
remain subjective (because they measure corruption as perceived by those asked). But despite 
these two drawbacks, they give a meaningful picture of the situation and,in the absence of other 
surveys, the indexes have been accepted by public opinion. 
In 2001, the CPlindex revealed that Finland, Denmark and New Zealand were seen as the least corrupt 
countries, while Indonesia,Uganda, Nigeria and Bangladesh came out bottom of the list. [|

### 123772: Contemporary art: who calls the shots?

Contemporary art: 
who calls the shots? 
Despite the international veneer of the art market, research by French sociologist Alain Quémin 
shows that a handful of rich countries dominates the scene   INTERVIEW BY RENE LEFORT 
Director OFTHE UNESCO COURIER 
LE 
ow has contemporary art been affected by 
globalization? 
Contemporary art lovers and 
pote onals believe that it’s becoming 
creas internationalized. Any 
gallery director, art critic, museum 
curator or exhibition commissioner 
would more or less agree that it would be 
absurd to take nationality or country of 
origin into account when judging an 
artist’s work.All that matters, they say, 
is whether or not he or she is good. In 
other words, an artist’s fame and market 
value should have nothing to do with 
nationality. As proof, those in the art 
world point to the fact that exhibitions 
and biennales are scattered around the 
planet? (they are even held in Havana, 
Taipei and Dakar), and to the rise of 
Asian artists after the Eastern European 
wave of the early 1990s. In contemporary 
art, globalization and its corollaries in 
the art world—cultural mixing and 
relativism—are taken for granted. 
  
But do these claims match what is actually 
happening on the art market? 
To answer that question, I have 
developed or compared several 
indicators, including rankings of 
“reputation” by experts (those who 
contribute to an artist’s fame or “name 
recognition”),the composition of large 
private and public collections, 
* Alain Quémin, a researcher and teacher 
at Marne-la-Vallée university (France), 
has just published a study commissioned 
by the French Foreign Affairs ministry, 
entitled “The role of buyer countries on the 
market and in the contemporary art 
world” 
42 The Unesco Courier - October 2001 
acquisitions by large museums, 
participation in major fairs and biennale 
exhibitions, sales on the international 
market, and so on. These indicators 
sometimes give different rankings, but 
they reveal a very strong geographical 
hierarchy (see box). The most famous 
artists and those whose works have the 
highest market value are from the 
United States. Several countries in 
Western Europe form the second group, 
sometimes equal to or outdoing the 
United States, especially at fairs and 
biennales. 
A FEW INDICATORS 
D Each year, the German magazine Capital 
publishes a world ranking of living artists called 
Kunst Kompass. Highly influential around the 
world,it supposedly reflects their aesthetic value 
based on the opinions of “experts” and 
exhibitions in major museums and shows. 
In 2000, the 100 “best” artists included 33 
Americans, 28 Germans, eight Britons, five French, 
four Italians and three Swiss. Of the 16 other 
artists, only five came from the developing world 
(South Africa, Cuba, Iran, Mexico, Thailand). 
» On November 16, 2000, Christies held one of its 
two major annual contemporary art auctions in 
New York. Of the 48 artists whose works were 
sold, 26 came from the United States, six from the 
United Kingdom, five from Germany, four from 
Italy, three from Switzerland, two from Japan and 
one each from France and South Africa. 
» On November 17, 2000, Sotheby's held a similar 
auction in New York. Of the 63 works sold, 50 
were by American artists or artists living in the 
United States. Just one was by an artist from a 
developing country, where he still lives (Mexico). 
[| 
But the ranking in this group is very 
marked. Germany is far ahead of the 
United Kingdom, France, Italy and 
Switzerland. After them, the contribution 
from other nations, including developed 
countries such as Spain, the Nordic 
countries, Japan and South Korea, is 
insignificant. The third world is at the 
very bottom of the list. 
In art as in many other fields, there is 
obviously a gulf between a “centre,” 
made up of only a few countries that are 
themselves ranked in a very rigid 
hierarchy, and a huge “periphery.” 
But artists from the periphery, as you call 
it, have achieved a certain degree of fame 
and their works have attained a very high 
market value... 
That may be true, but the proportion 
is very small. And how long will it last? 
Artists from Eastern Europe, who were 
very fashionable in the early 1990s, have 
now fallen into oblivion in the Western 
art world. And there’s nothing to indicate 
that the Asian or African artists currently 
in vogue will not in their turn be as 
“disposable as Kleenex”themselves. 
In any case, how should they go 
about getting known? There are 
practically no exceptions to the rule: 
they must be exhibited in a country at the 
centre or go there to live in the hope of 
finding their place in mainstream 
contemporary art. 
But hasn't this inequality always existed? 
Without going too far back,didn’t France 
occupy this “monopolistic” position from 
the late 19th to the mid-20th century? 
Yes, but the big difference is that this 
dominant position was recognized and 
fully accepted in the name of France’s 
contribution to art history. Today, on the 
contrary, contemporary art circles cannot 
recognize America’s supremacy in this 
field because they simply don’t “see”it. 
In the artistic fields where this supremacy 
is recognized,it tends to be stigmatized 
because the United States is considered

a latecomer on the art scene. 
So why is there this contradiction between 
image and reality? 
I'll answer with another question: 
why would the contemporary art world 
be an exception to the dominant 
globalization credo, according to which 
everyone, wherever they are, has a 
chance as long as they have talent? And 
more specifically, why would it be free 
from two contradictory movements that 
are part of globalization? On the one 
hand, you have an endless search for 
innovation, which sometimes goes as 
far as including the periphery. On the 
other, the tendency to minimize risk, 
especially financial risk, ends up 
boosting the value of artists from well- 
established art centres, who are 
therefore the easiest to promote. 
But playing the devil's advocate, can’t we 
say that “good” contemporary artists 
simply wouldn't choose to live in places 
where their work cannot be properly 
exhibited or sold? 
Today, artists from the periphery 
have a growing number of opportunities 
to aid them. For example, fine arts 
schools are now more open to the 
world. However, these artists rarely 
make it on the international scene. Is 
that because they might be “naturally” 
worse? Let’s take a sporting metaphor. 
For decades, people thought you had 
to be Scandinavian to be a champion 
middle-distance runner. Then they came 
from Eastern Europe. Now, athletes 
from North and East Africa are winning 
all the races. And each time, the success 
of these different groups is considered 
“natural.” At the very least, the 
geographical concentration of 
contemporary art hampers the 
recognition of the artistic potential that 
exists outside the United States and in 
some European countries. [|

When the media 
meet as one 
Now the Internet's star has faded, a new buzzword is circulating in the corridors 
of the world's media. But will “digital convergence” really be able to keep its promise 
of communication and information anytime, anywhere, in any shape or form? 
JOHN VINCE 
he past 40 years have witnessed an 
extraordinary evolution. From slow 
expensive machines controlled by punched 
cards, computers have become low-cost, 
erful units taking up no more space 
than a briefcase. Simultaneously, our world 
has become interlaced with telephone wires, 
optic fibres, undersea cables, microwave 
links, television channels and satellite 
communications. 
At the crossing of these two 
developments stands the Internet—a direct 
result of computer technology intersecting 
with communication technology. But for 
many in the world of today’s media, this is 
merely a first landmark in what promises to 
be a giant upheaval in the way people 
communicate, relax and work. This is the 
era of digital convergence. 
According to a recent article in 
Scientific American, convergence is in 
principle “the union of audio, video and 
data communications into a single source, 
received on a single device, delivered by a 
single connection.” Digital technology has 
already provided a medium for integrating 
media that until now required distinct 
channels of communication: we can now 
send emails using our televisions or text 
messages over mobile phones. Real-time 
video can be transmitted over radio 
channels, while television and radio can be 
received on Personal Computers (PCs). 
Hyped-up precedents 
Full digital convergence promises real- 
time access to information anywhere in the 
world,and global communication through 
text, graphics, video and audio. In fact, there 
seems to be no technological limit to what 
might be possible. “The reality of ‘anywhere, 
anytime’ access to broadband digital 
networks is going to make our lives freer and 
fuller,” Gerald Levin, chief executive officer 
of AOL Time Warner, has promised. But 
technology alone cannot bring about such a

world: as long as consumers and companies 
do not embrace it,convergence is likely to go 
the way of several hyped-up predecessors. 
Over adecade ago, for example, virtual 
reality was the technology of the future, 
and many people anticipated a day where 
we would be wearing head-mounted 
displays and interacting with all manner 
of virtual environments. At the time there

was real concern about changes in industrial 
practices and social behaviour brought 
about by this technology. So what happened 
to this vision? Well, we got it wrong. 
Currently, the home computer is the main 
interface to the Internet. But relatively few 
people in the world have access to PCs, and 
few would argue that they are ideal for the 
purpose—they crash and freeze because

they were not designed for widespread 
Internet use. 
In promising to fuse media as diverse as 
television, telephone communication, video 
games, music and data transmission, the 
era of digital convergence goes one better 
than yesterday’s celebrated “information 
superhighway.” Yet in doing so, it also raises 
critical questions: what services are needed, 
what is the ideal platform, will it be fully 
interactive? Can the old be so easily 
combined with the new? 
At the root of any digital application 
stands a binary coding system: designers 
of early computers found that only when 
  
ER GIAETC RU ER RDI 
using such a system could their computers 
be relied upon to give consistent results. The 
binary code enables numbers, letters and 
characters to be assigned unique digital 
patterns that can be stored on magnetic 
tape, compact discs, DVD and computer 
files. These digital codes can then be readily 
transmitted via copper cable, fibre optics or 
as radio waves. Once in a digital format, 
  
text,audio, graphics and video can therefore 
all be processed by one common 
technology with great accuracy. 
Skeptical consumers 
Yet achieving this single technology is 
far from straightforward. There are 
currently three major television broadcast 
standards, and they are all incompatible 
with each another. But this is nothing 
compared to the many technologies 
supporting the Internet, each with a 
different bandwidth and physical media. 
The problems faced in designing platforms 
and communication systems that will be 
accepted across the world can appear 
insuperable. 
One body, the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), is 
at the heart of efforts to devise world 
standards for coding audio-visual 
information. Its Motion Picture Experts’ 
Group has already notched up several 
important benchmarks via standards for 
storage media and broadcast, while the 
MPEG-4 (now under development) will 
establish the means for storage, transmission 
and interactive manipulation of video 
data—the essence of 
doubts remain over whether consumers 
will be interested in having to make the 
sort of mental effort associated with 
computing while also settling down in front 
of a sitcom. 
“There is a large group of people who 
have no interest in the new media and, 
contrary to many predictions, that segment 
is shrinking slower that the icebergs in 
Antarctica,” recently warned Horst Stipp, 
director of research at NBC television 
network in the United States 
Besides the issue of consumer habits, 
infrastructure costs are set to be immense, 
and will have to be met by national states or 
the private sector before being passed on to 
users. Platforms do not necessarily have to 
be expensive. The mobile phone is a good 
example of how something that is 
technologically sophisticated can almost 
be given away, with its cost recovered 
through service charges. Users are then 
coerced through clever marketing to 
upgrade to newer phones with more 
features to reinforce their dependence. 
The creation and copyright protection 
of digital content are other vital issues. We 
have already seen that satellite television 
provides us with so

The Internet is to turn it on.” this by making it easier 
plagued by long, 
erratic response times 
because it is a pull-technology, driven by 
patterns of user demands. Push-technology, 
on the other hand, reverses the 
relationship: servers simply send 
information to passive users, as in 
television and radio. But if some form of 
combination between one-way television 
flow and interactive Internet is to be the 
basis of our future media,it is hard to see 
how it could be operated. Current network 
technology could not support a pull-based 
approach towards television, while a push- 
based approach would simply duplicate 
what we have already: normal, 
uninteractive television or radio. 
Yet the problem of fusing Internet with 
television is also one of defining the services 
offered. As Steve Jobs, chief executive 
officer of Apple, has observed: “TV is where 
you go to turn your brain off; the computer 
is where you go to turn it on.” Information, 
entertainment and relaxation appear at 
first to be quite different needs. Serious 
to create totally 
synthetic television 
programs employing virtual sets and actors. 
One might even suggest this has already 
started to happen. 
Whatever the outcome, it is obvious 
that technology will play an increasing part 
in our everyday lives. Beyond technology, 
digital convergence embraces the services, 
industrial practices and social behaviour 
that form modern society. We have in our 
hands the technology to construct the most 
sophisticated machines ever built, but if 
they are unusable, simply because of their 
operating instructions, then recent lessons 
have taught us they will not survive. 
Whatever we design must be simple, 
reliable and useful. Perhaps this is where 
artificial intelligence will play an important 
role. [|

### 123775: All power to the barons?

WHEN THE MEDIA MEET AS ONE 
All power to the barons? 
Digital technologies may promise a host of new channels and activities, 
but the stranglehold of big business is set to tighten, says leading media commentator Robert 
think these changes in ownership will go 
a long way towards shaping how the 
digital world will eventually look. 
How exactly is ownership changing? 
The crucial trend is vertical 
integration, or more broadly, 
conglomeration of media ownership. In 
the United States for example—and this 
is a pattern that could have been found in 
most countries with market economies— 
the media industries such as music or 
cinema in the 1950s each tended to be 
dominated by three or four different 
companies. What has happened in the 
U.S. and globally over the last 50 years is 
that the largest media companies have 
become conglomerates, meaning that the 
largest film studio also owns a television 
network or a music company, radio 
stations, magazines, cable systems, satellite 
systems, video rental chains.! What you 
have is a tremendous web of power built 
up by the largest firms, which have 
become dominant players in several 
media sectors. All this predates digital 
convergence. Digital convergence is really 
the cherry on top of the sundae. 
But will the new digital technology not 
offer greater choice and allow new 
companies to enter the market? 
There is a paradox with the rise of 
the Internet specifically and digital 
communications more broadly. The 
standard belief has been that all of a 
sudden,the traditional market power of 
these media giants is going to fall because 
the barriers to entering media markets 
are being radically lowered, if not 
eliminated. But the problem with this 
theory is that it’s technology driven. It 
makes perfect sense technologically, but 
what it misses—and this is the perceived 
wisdom on Wall Street—is that new 
technologies are not going to spawn a 
wave of commercially viable media 
entrepreneurs or businesses due to the 
market power of existing companies. 
Technologies are developed in the market 
for the most part, and the ones that are 
aggressively pursued and promoted are 
the ones most likely to offer a profitable 
return for the dominant companies 
What effects does concentration have on 
the media we consume? 
Firstly, you see the incessant rise of 
what I call hyper-commercialism, 
meaning that these companies are quite 
rationally trying to make a profit from 
every aspect of their media services— 
something they can do much more easily 
in a non-competitive market. If you don’t 
like the fact that in the U.S. the average 
commercial radio station has 18 to 
20 minutes of advertisements per hour, 
you don’t really have any alternative, 
they all do the same. The flipside of this 
prevalence of commercial values 
throughout our media culture is a decline 
in public service content. Journalism that 
does hard investigation or raises serious 
social issues doesn’t make economic sense 
for these companies—it costs a lot of 
money and the pay-off isn’t high. 
Furthermore, the largest media 
companies now rank among the largest 
firms in the entire economy. These 
companies are not neutral bystanders on 
the sidelines of society. They're main 
players right in the heart of it, with distinct 
self-interests on the crucial issues of the 
day. 
What do you believe should be done? 
Our traditional notions of what 
proper media ownership is must be re- 
evaluated. But the sort of public and 
political debate on the issues, at least in 
the U.S., is the last thing on earth large 
media companies want to encourage. As 
long as this issue is kept in the smoke- 
filled back rooms and lobbyists talk to 
politicians, the position we have now will 
continue. [|

### 123776: Sotigui Kouyaté: the wise man of the stage

TALKING TT O I | 
Sotigui Kouyate 
The wise man of the stage 
 
  
  
Despite years away from home and a career spanning many cultures, Malian actor 
and griot Sotigui Kouyaté has not strayed from his foremost mission: to break ignorance 
of Africa's living traditions and spark encounters across continents 
ou often say you're 
first and foremost 
a storyteller, a 
“griot.” How does 
this deep-rooted 
  
identity affect your 
approach to 
theatre? 
I draw my inspiration,my energy, 
from meeting people. In my corner of 
Africa—my parents were from 
Guinea, I was born in Mali and I'm 
Burkinabé by adoption—such 
encounters are important, since 
outsiders are the ones who bring us 
what we don’t know. 
I didn’t go to any drama school, 
unless you count the great school of the 
street—the school of life. When I was 
young, a theatre producer friend, 
Boubacar Dicko, asked me several 
times to play parts for him.But it was 
the last thing I dreamed of: at the time, 
I was playing for Burkina Faso’s 
national football team! 
Did you have a bad impression of 
theatre? 
When I was a kid, I enjoyed koteba 
performances, an old African tradition. 
The word means “big snail.” They took 
place in our neighbourhood and there 
would be three circles—one of 
children,another made up of women 
and a third one of men. But in those 
colonial days, the koteba was dying out 
and being replaced by Western-style 
theatre. The French started drama 
contests between all their West African 
colonies, which later became eight 
countries. Consciously or not, the idea 
was to instil us with Western culture.

We weren't allowed to speak our own 
language at school. If we did, the 
teacher would make us wear a piece of 
wood or metal around the neck with a 
mule’s head on it and deprive us of 
lunch. The best way to kill a tree is to 
cut it from its roots. This Western-style 
theatre also helped steer African 
intellectuals away from the campaign 
for independence. 
What made you change heart? 
I love dance and in 1966, I finally 
agreed to be in a historical play 
produced by my friend Boubacar 
Dicko which featured a war dance. He 
also asked me to play a part as adviser 
to the king. The play won a prize and 
went on tour in the region. I became 
attached to the show, and then to 
another, based on a play written by 
my uncle. 
Gradually, acting grew on me But 
I wasn’t enamoured by everything— 
not the courses run by French 
instructors, for example. They told us, 
without explaining why, how we should 
walk on stage, which seemed far too 
affected to me. They would ask us to 
imagine a ship, to picture it on the wall, 
but I couldn’t see anything. I left, 
though by then, I'd really become 
taken with the profession. 
I set up my own theatre company in 
1966 with a group of 25 people. 
Burkinabé radio gave us a place to 
work and we mainly did 
improvisations. I'd go to work at the 
ministry for labour and public 
administration in the morning, play 
football in the afternoon,and then go 
off to theatre rehearsals. At the same 
time, I was also writing my first play, 
The Crocodile’s Lament. It was about 
being sensitive, a gift with which you 
can even manage to caress a crocodile, 
as it actually happens in several regions 
of Burkina Faso, where crocodiles are 
viewed as sacred. 
Sensitivity— is that what actors need 
most? 
When I give courses, I do a lot of 
work on being open, sensitive and 
learning to communicate. Politicians 
always make speeches about 
communication and dialogue. But it 
all has to do with economic interests, 
never human ones. You can’t 
communicate if you don’t listen, and 
people don’tlisten to each other, even 
if they live in the same country. 
Everyone’s absorbed in themselves, 
so exclusion grows. People risk their 
lives to leave their country, and the 
authorities close their eyes on all that. 
Finding another way of communicating, 
through the efforts of actors from 
different cultures working together, is 
key to the approach of Peter Brook, 
who you met in 1983 for the great 
Indian epic The Mahabharata. 
When 1 joined the Bouffes du 
Nord Theatre in Paris, I had no 
intention of staying in France. I'd taken 
a year’s sabbatical from my job at the 
ministry. The problem—or if you 
prefer, the luck in my case—was that 
The Mahabharata was a hit. 1 asked 
the ministry to extend my leave, and 
they gave me another year unpaid. 
But when that was up, the play’s run 
still hadn’t ended. I didn’t have an

Antigone, staged by Sotigui (CINE CRT 
understudy, and the play lasted nine 
hours. I was brought up not to aban- 
don something halfway through, I 
couldn’t leave the company. But I'd 
been with the civil service for 29 years 
and was just a year away from being 
able to draw my pension. I lost that, 
and four months later, The 
Mahabharata closed and I was left 
without a job back home. I didn’t want 
to return to my family empty-handed 
“A MAN WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY 
PRESENCE AND QUALITY" 
South African writer Can Themba.   
hen casting The Mahabharata, Peter Brook's assistant scoured through film 
Wao in search of an actor to take on one of the lead roles, Bhisma the sage. 
“| saw one shot of a tree and a man as tall and slender as this tree, with an extraordinary 
presence and quality. It was Sotigui,” recalls Brook in a recent documentary about the actor. Born 
in 1936 in Bamako (Mali), Kouyaté belongs to an illustrious family of griots—masters of words 
who are at once genealogists, historians, masters of ceremonies, advisers, mediators, singers and 
musicians. He has handed down all these talents, as a composer, dancer, actor and father, to his 
own children and a multitude of “spiritual children” dispersed across the world, for whom he is 
a precious guide. Filling each of his roles with profound dignity, he has appeared in some 60 films, 
most recently in Little Senegal, directed by Rachid Bouchareb. As one of Peter Brook's longtime 
actors, he will tour in several shows over the next year, including The Man Who, based on Oliver 
Sacks’ The man who mistook his wife for a hat, and The Suit, adapted from a story by the late

because as the oldest son,I was their 
pillar. It was very hard. Here in France, 
I could struggle, work and continue 
to explore my culture and being. Art 
has never fed anyone in Africa. 
You are said to have slipped into the 
part of the wise man Bhisma. 
When I joined Peter Brook, I didn’t 
feel out of place. I could see everything 
was happening inside a circle, just like 
in Africa, and on the third day, he took 
my hand, looked me in the eye and 
said:“Sotigui, from today, you're part 
of the family.” That was a magical 
moment for me. He didn’t say: “You're 
part of our group, of our company.” 
He’d understood the soul of an 
African, he’d embraced my culture. 
Brook is a universal man. For him, 
there are no barriers between people, 
which is rare in today’s world. Some 
people don’t understand my loyalty 
to Brook. But how can I not be loyal to 
someone who defends such values in 
today’s world, where separation and 
individualism hold sway? 
At his International Centre for 
Theatre Research were 22 actors from 
18 different countries. In The 
Mahabharata, the five Pandava 
brothers were played by a German, a 
Frenchman, an Iranian, an Italian and 
a Senegalese. This bothered no one, 
and the play travelled the world for 
four years. Only Brook could have 
pulled off such a feat. There aren’t any 
races or skin colours in his mind.I've 
also played Prospero in The Tempest 
under him. It was the first time a 
European director, a British 
Shakespearean to boot, had staged 
this play with a black Prospero. 
Brook has said your imagination was 
nourished by a culture where the visible 
and invisible worlds are not separate. In 
the parts you play, it often seems as if 
you're on an initiation voyage. 
I come from a culture where 
nature is very importantin a person’s 
life. Your soul is first incarnated in a 
tree, then in an animal and then in a 
living human being. Some people are 
even named after trees. All this means 
everything in the world is alive. 
Unfortunately, humans increasingly 
think they’re the only living beings 
on earth. 
In French, you can point to 
someone and say “there’s a person.” In 
several African languages, when you 
say “person,” the word is followed by 
something that means roughly “the 
person of the person.” That is, each 
human being comprises many 
identities, which are in fact other 
people. Daily life is about discovering 
all these beings within. This can only 
happen through meeting other 
people. 
“When you meet another, instead of 
losing yourself in his eyes, recognize 
yourself—and perhaps you'll see 
yourself,” the saying goes. Our wise 
men tell us thatignorance is the worst 
thing that can happen to anyone, worse 
than illness or death. And the most 
ignorant person of all, they say, is

outside his or her house 
Your own work as a stage director 
is enriched by such contacts and 
encounters. You once produced 
Antigone with Malian actors. 
It’s through differences that you 
find ways to work together. At the 
request of the Jean Moulin Museum 
in Paris, I produced a show in 1999 to 
mark the centenary of the French 
wartime resistance leader’s birth. I 
adapted his diary, Le Premier Combat, 
and merged it into a novel by the 
Cameroonian writer Ferdinand Oyono, 
Le Vieux Negre et la Médaille. This 
shocked some of Moulins old 
comrades, but the director of the 
museum, a historian, firmly defended 
the project. 
In recent months, I've been working 
on Oedipus, which follows naturally 
from Antigone. I've based myself on 
several versions of the story, from 
Sophocles to Jean Anouilh, and even a 
thriller on the theme. I've read the 
analyses of psychoanalysts from Freud 
to Tobie Nathan. All focus on incest. 
For me, however, Oedipus is about the 
“Is there any sin so serious 
that it can never be forgiven? 
problem of facing up to oneself. I'm 
not trying to provide an answer, I'm 
just raising the issue to foster awareness 
of the battle that’s inherent in every 
destiny, namely not to let ourselves be 
overcome by fatalism. Is Oedipus guilty 
of killing his father? At first he was 
hailed as a hero who rescued a suffering 
country. Then he was rejected by his 
own sons and stoned to death before 
the wall of Thebes by the very people 
he’d saved. He’s a man on the run, 
consumed by suffering, by an obsession. 
If he’d come to terms with his human 
weaknesses, he wouldn’t have gouged 
his eyes out. I end my Oedipus by 
looking at what I think is the most 
serious issue—the refusal to forgive. 
The choir exhorts the gods to praise 
the hero after his vain ordeal. 
It's an appeal to reason... 
Forgiveness doesn’t heal everything 
but it can make some things better. Is 
there any sin so serious that it can 
never be forgiven? Is evil 100 percent 
evil, or can we find a little crack within 
that can draw it closer to good? 
You stand for deep-rooted African 
values, just like the character you played 
in Rachid Bouchareb’s film Little Senegal 
(2000). Do you think these values are 
under threat? 
I'm always afraid of that,but I try 
to fight with words and culture. For 
example in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina 
Faso’s second city, my children and 1 
opened a cultural centre a few years 
ago. I set it up in the courtyard 
belonging to my father, a very large 
space. Today it’s a place where you can 
learn music, percussion and painting, a 
meeting place where we invite foreign 
painters to teach courses. We also wish 
to make it into a computer training 
centre. Besides which,we are seeking 
to create a university of African 
traditions where we could develop 
ways to preserve this heritage and 
deepen knowledge of our culture. 
You also set up the Mandeka Theatre in 
Mali, which encourages literary and 
artistic creation. 
We founded the Mandeka in 1997, 
at the same time as France was 
deporting charter plane loads of Malian 
and Senegalese immigrants every day. 
While that was happening, actors in 
Bamako were still asking me how they 
could come to France, as if they were 
blind to how immigrants were being 
treated. When I advised them not to

00, they’d stare at me as if to say: “Look 
at you,you’re doing alright over there, 
and so are your sons.” The easiest way 
out in the end was to say I couldn’t help 
anyone in coming to France. But I was 
ready to do what I could by finding 
them jobs, courses or training. This 1s 
what I had in mind when I founded the 
Mandeka—stopping young people 
from fleeing, helping them to win 
respect through having a job and 
showing people what they could do. 
Antigone was performed in France by 
actors from Mandeka.Les Boutfes du 
Nord agreed to produce Oedipus, in 
which Mandeka’s Malian actors will 
ddl 
you vehicles and cameras. And it’s even 
worse for theatre. The troupes you see 
abroad, in Europe, have to live off their 
Own resources. You can’t even say they 
were once better off. When I founded 
my own dance troupe in Burkina Faso in 
1971, 1 received no funding. I went into 
debt to buy musical instruments and 
costumes. Several times the government 
seized them so they could represent the 
country in foreign festivals or greet a 
visit by the French president—without 
ever giving us anything in return. 
Do you feel you're carrying a message 
from Africa?

perform with French ones. 
African theatre and films still have a 
very low world profile, unlike African 
music. 
There 1s no African cultural policy. 
Our filmmakers don’t have the money 
to produce and distribute their work. 
A few years ago, a lot more films were 
given loans against eventual box-office 
receipts from France because their 
subjects, often ethnographic, attracted 
donors. But as African directors 
became interested in other 1ssues and 
left folklore to one side, they secured 
less and less money. As for the actors, 
for years you could look through the 
budgets of African films and not find 
any mention of them. 
In Mali and Burkina Faso, the film 
authorities do what they can, but that 
doesn’t go much further than lending 
Let’s be modest. Africa 1s vast, and 
it would be pretentious to speak 1n its 
name. I'm fighting the battle with 
words because I'm a storyteller, a griot. 
Rightly or wrongly, they call us masters 
of the spoken word. Our duty is to 
encourage the West to appreciate 
Africa more. It’s also true that many 
Africans don’t really know their own 
continent. And 1f you forget your 
culture, you lose sight of yourself. It 1s 
said that “the day you no longer know 
where you're going, just remember 
where you came from.” Our strength 
lies in our culture. Everything I do as a 
storyteller, a griot, stems from this 
rooting and openness. n
