### 50277: Illyria of yesterday, Albania of today; archaeological excavations over the past 30 years at hundreds of ancient sites have thrown new light on the earliest ancestors of the Albanian people

lllyria of yesterday 
Albania of today 
Archaeological excavations over the past 30 years 
at hundreds of ancient sites have thrown new light 
on the earliest ancestors of the Albanian people 
by Muzafer Korkuti 
  
MUZAFER KORKUTI, Albanian historian and 
archaeologist, Is a leading authority and the 
author of many studies on Albanian antiquity. 
The article we publish here is based on a 
special study by the author entitled in Alba- 
nian, “Shqiperia Arkeologjike® (Archaeolo- 
gical Albaria), recently published in a tri- 
lingual (Albanian, French and English} edition 
by the Archaeological Section of the Institute 
of History and Languages at the National 
University of Tirana (Albania). 
I. 1948, workers draining 
the Malig marshes in southeast Albania 
discovered potsherds, horn tools and 
small flint knives embedded in the 
mud of a drainage channel. Quite by 
chance they had stumbled across an 
important prehistoric site. 
To appreciate the significance of 
their find it is essential to under- 
stand the existing state of Albanian 
archaeology and current theories on 
the history and civilization of the 
lllyrians and their direct descendants, 
the Albanians. 
At the beginning of this century, the 
archaeological map of Albania was 
virtually blank. The limited amount of 
  
research that went on was the work of 
foreign scholars who were mainly 
interested in Greek and Roman civi- 
lization and hence confined their 
attention to the Albanian coastal towns 
which the Greeks and Romans had 
colonized. Even those whose interests 
ranged wider did not go into the fun- 
damental questions of Illyrian history. 
Yet Albania is a country of ancient 
culture and its soil has been inhabited 
since prehistoric times. The lllyrians 
were formidable warriors, as we know 
from their stiff resistance to the 
Romans between 6 and 9 AD. They 
were also skilful metal-workers and 
potters. 
Archaeological research 
in recent years has shown 
that Albania can boast 
a continued period of 
inhabitation going back 
to prehistoric times. Left,

Nevertheless, the culture and civi- 
lization of the indigenous population 
of Albania continued to be largely 
ignored until the end of the Second 
World War, which saw the birth of 
Albanian archaeology as a scientific 
discipline. 
Albanian archaeologists began to 
delve into the history of their country. 
Some of their finds have been 
sensational, and today they can look 
back on nearly twenty-eight years of 
systematic work which has illuminated 
many previously obscure aspects of 
Illyrian history. 
They have excavated a large number 
of settlements, fortresses and necro- 
polises from various periods, and the 
fruits of their work can be seen in the 
ancient castles which tower over the 
city suburbs of modern Albania, in 
fortified settlements deep in the heart 
of the countryside, and in a host of 
museums scattered about the country. 
Albania currently boasts over 170 
archaeological sites and new ones 
open each year. 
It had long been believed that the 
Illyrians brought Iron Age civilization 
  n TL TTT EE ATE 
CL R 
to the Balkans, which they reached as . 
part of a great wave of migrations from 
Central Europe durino the second half 
of the second millenium B.C. The 
excavations at Maliq and elsewhere 
were to disprove this. 
For six years archaeologists worked 
at Maliq. They discovered that the 
site consisted of several layers, and 
that it had been inhabited from the late 
Neolithic Age (the first half of the 
third millenium B.C.) until the late 
Bronze Age (the end of the second 
millenium B.C.). 
The late Neolithic layer revealed the 
remains of rectangular huts with wattle 
and daub walls and clay floors. Each 
hut had a space set aside for an oven. 
Containers and potsherds of various 
shapes and decoration were also 
unearthed from this layer. 
During the Aeneolithic Age (the 
transitional period between the Neo- 
lithic Age and the Bronze Age), the 
inhabitants of Malig lived in lake 
dwellings built on piles,” hundreds of 
which were dug out during the exca- 
vations. Aeneolithic copper axes also 
came to light, along with a rich

collection of pottery decorated with 
geometric patterns on black and grey 
glazes. 
The Maliq site was inhabited right 
through the Bronze Age, but by this 
time the water level had dropped and 
the huts were being built on the ground. 
Most of the Bronze Age specimens at 
Maliq were pots which had several 
features in common with those from 
the previous period, although some 
new forms and designs had also been 
developed. 
Meanwhile, archaeologists were 
learning more about the Bronze Age 
population of present-day Albania from 
excavations of tumuli on the Pazhok 
plain near the city of Elbasan. Tumuli 
—earth and stone burial mounds 
standing anything up to four metres 
high—have revealed a great deal of 
information about Illyrian civilization, 
for the lllyrians believed in a life after 
death and were buried with objects 
such as weapons, jewellery, pottery 
and tools which would help them in 
the after-life. 
After meticulous examination, it was 
discovered that the Bronze Age tumuli

FROM ILLYRIA TO ALBANIA (Continued) 
on the Pazhok plain bore a remarkable 
resemblance to later, lllyrian Iron Age 
tumuli at Kruma and Kéneta in northern 
Albania and at Vodhina and elsewhere 
in the south. Both Bronze and Iron 
Age tumuli had been built in the same 
way and identical funeral rites had 
been performed in each period, 
Furthermore, there was a close simi- 
larity between the contents of the 
Bronze and Iron Age graves. All this 
indicated that the people buried in the 
tumuli at each period belonged to the 
same tribe. 
Some extremely important middle 
and late Bronze Age objects were 
unearthed at Pazhok: bronze swords, 
spears, daggers, aold and bronze 
ornaments, and earthenware. The 
pottery revealed several features of 
the earlier Aeneolithic tradition and 
suggested that the people who lived 
there during the Bronze Age were 
indigenous. 
The experts’ observations and con- 
clusions from their discoveries at 
Pazhok and Malig may be summed up 
as follows. 
First of all, the late Neolithic civi- 
lization discovered at Maliq (and at 
another prehistoric site at Kamnik in 
the Kolonja region) is in many ways 
similar to contemporary cultures in the 
nearby south and must be seen as 
part of the great Balkan-Anatolian 
cultural complex. This means that the 
Maliq Neolithic civilization originated 
in the southeast. 
Secondly, the Aeneolithic popu- 
lation of Maliq also came from the 
southeast. Thirdly, the Bronze Age 
inhabitants of the region were the 
direct descendants of the Aeneolithic 
Age population, and the distinguishing 
feature of their culture, their pottery, 
inherited. many characteristics from 
that of the previous era. 
- AN or =E 
C PEA A 
Finally, this pottery has many new 
features which have been found on 
other Bronze Age sites in Albania and 
which are also characteristic of Illyrian 
Iron Age pottery. 
All this evidence supports the 
hypothesis that the Bronze Age civi- 
lization discovered in Albania is Illyrian, 
and that the lllyrians were formed in 
the Balkans and already existed as a 
people by the beginning of the Bronze 
Age. In other words Illyrian civilization 
in Albania is much older than had been 
thought. 
One of the main fields in which 
Albanian archaeologists have been 
active has been research into lllyrian 
civilization during the Iron Age, when 
it reached its apogee. They have 
concentrated mainly on excavating 
necropolises and fortified settlements 
and have made particularly important 
discoveries in tumuli on a site in the

Mati river valley, at Vajza in the Viora 
district and at Upper Dropull near to 
Gijirokastra. 
In the Mati valley archaeologists 
excavated thirty-five tumuli while a 
dam was being built for a hydro- 
electric power station, Most of the 
tumuli dated from early in the last 
millenium B.C., although others were 
more recent and some were even put 
up during the Roman Empire. 
The necropolis belonged to an 
Illyrian tribe known to history as the 
Pirusts. They were renowned as 
tough fighters, and the excavations 
produced evidence that they were 
equally proficient as metalworkers. 
For the Mati valley tumuli yielded a 
surprisingly large number of bronze 
and iron objects: spearheads of 
various sizes, swords, daggers, helmets 
and other weapons, as well as

ornamental objects—clasps, necklaces, 
buttons, bracelets and diadems. 
The earliest fortified settlements in 
Albania date from the transitional 
period between the Bronze Age and 
the Iron Age. Their ruins can be seen 
scattered throughout southern Albania. 
These early fortresses are usually 
found in strategic positions on high 
ground, dominating fertile plains and 
river valleys and surrounded by good 
pasture land. They conform to no 
standard layout since they were skil- 
fully adapted to local topographical 
conditions so that building was reduced 
to a minimum. Remains of wattle and 
daub huts have been discovered 
within walls made of huge blocks of 
rough stone put together without 
mortar, and in some places more than 
ten feet thick. : 
Detailed study has revealed conclus- 
ively that the early Iron Age forts at 
Gajtan, Tren and Rosuja were used 
by lllyrian tribes for defensive pur- 
poses. There is no evidence of any 
economic activity worth speaking of;

they were simply strongholds where 
the people and their flocks could take 
refuge in time of war. 
The second half of the Iron Age in 
Albania saw the birth of a group of 
Illyrian kingdoms and the development 
of a system of economic production 
based on slave ownership. A number 
of castles and fortified settlements in. 
southern Illyria date from this period. 
Many of these settlements have now 
been discovered and studied. Some 
of them were added onto existing 
forts; others were entirely new. The 
walls of these late Iron Age forts were 
built with remarkable technical sophis- 
tication of rectangular blocks of skil- 
fully hewn stone laid perfectly flush 
without mortar. 
A major discovery was a rectangular 
stadium dating from the 3rd-2nd cen- 
turies B.C. It was found in the ruins 
of the ancient lllyrian city of Amantia, 
which is mentioned by fourth-century 
Greek geographers and stood on the 
site of the present-day village of Ploga. 
Seventeen tiers of stone seats have 
ye TT TTT, 
been uncovered on one side of this 
well-preserved stadium, eight on the 
other. 
In the ruins of the ancient lllyrian 
city of Dimale (present-day Krotina), 
a portico with seven entrances has 
been’ excavated, and at Byllis, once 
so powerful that it minted its own 
coinage, the remains of a theatre have 
been found. 
For several years now work has 
also been going on in the imposing 
ruins of Antigonea in the Drino valley 
in southern Albania, near the modern 
town of Gijirokastér. Visitors to the 
excavations can stroll along the 
straight streets and walk into the 
houses of this once-great lllyrian city. 
In Lower Selenica four monumental 
graves hewn into the rock have been 
discovered among the remains of an 
lllyrian settlement whose name is still 
unknown. The burial vault of one of 
the graves contained dozens of 
weapons, bronze and earthenware 
vases, and many gold and silver 
ornaments, including a remarkable belt 
  Ne NN A AE r A 
  
made of a thin strip of silver carved 
with three horsemen and a warrior. 
In the same grave was a pair of iron 
shackles attached to the legs of a 
skeleton—a slave who had been put 
there to serve his master in the next 
world. 
Although there is relatively little 
monumental building in lllyrian cities, 
they have yielded an abundance of 
objects which have given historians 
a profound insight into the economic, 
social and cultural development of 
Illyria. 
Numerically, pottery—such as con- 
tainers large and small for storing and 
transporting wine, oil and grain—takes 
pride of place among the findings, 
along with metal tools and building 
materials. There are fewer weapons, 
ornamental jewellery and other decor- 
ative objects. 
An interesting feature is that some 
pithol, or wine-jars, bear their makers’ 
seals, and we can still read on them 
Illyrian names like Trito, Bato, Pito, 
Genthios and Plator. Metal picks,

Excavations in Albania have produced a 
wealth of artifacts that throw new light 
on its mythology and ancient cultures The 
5,000-year-old Neolithic earthenware figu- 
rine (1) found at Kamnik, in south-east 
Albania, is a symbol of the earth-mother 
cult. In burial mounds at Kugi Zi, in the 
same region, many bronze objects have 
been found in the form of birds (2) and 
human figures (3) as well as bracelets and 
clasps. They are believed to have been 
used as amulets and ornaments. They 
reveal the skill of Albania’'s metal crafts- 
men in the 8th century B.C. The small 
bronze figurine (4) portrays Poseidon, 
Greek god of the sea. It dates from the 
2nd century B.C. and was unearthed at 
Antigonea, in southern Albania.

FROM ILLYRIA TO ALBANIA 
(Continued) 
sickles, scythes, pruning knives and 
ploughs have also been discovered in 
these late Iron Age fortified towns, 
along with tiles and bricks in such 
enormous quantities that—given the 
transport difficulties obtaining at that 
time—we can conclude that they were 
manufactured locally. 
The rise of Illyrian cities during the 
4th century B.C. was followed by a 
period of prosperity which lasted 
roughly from the 3rd to the middle of 
the 2nd century B.C. This was a time 
of intense political, economic and 
cultural activity in lllyria. Several 
settlements which had hitherto been 
little more than villages now expanded 
and became in a real sense cities. 
The great coastal cities of Dyr- 
rhachion, Apollonia and Bouthroton 
became the main centres of Hellenistic 
culture in southern lllyria and as such 
they boosted the region's economic 
and cultural development. Commercial 
and other contacts between the 
Illyrian tribal aristocracy and these 
Greek cities further accentuated 
the economic inequalities and social 
differences in Illyria. But at the same 
time, trade expanded and the new 
society based on slave-ownership 
began to forge ahead. 
The great age of Illyria stretched 
from the 4th to the 2nd centuries B.C., 
and during this period she made a 
sizeable contribution to the life of the 
Greek cities on the coast. 
The sequel to the dynamic expansion 
of lllyrian society between the 4th and 
2nd centuries B.C. came with its 
vigorous resistance to the impact of 
the Roman world. After a bitter 
struggle, the Southern lllyrians manag- 
ed to maintain their individuality as a 
people virtually intact, although from 
this time their culture begins to bear 
the marks of Roman influence. The 
Northern lllyrians were less fortunate: 
they lost their ethnic identity and were 
assimilated by the foreign invaders. 
The course of Illyrian history cannot 
be properly understood without detailed 
knowledge of the Greek and Roman 
civllization of Albania’s coastal cities, 
a subject on which Albanian archae- 
ologists are currently concentrating. 
It is a mistake to consider the 
Hellenistic civilization of the slave- 
owning cities of Apollonia, Dyrrha- 
chion, Bouthroton and Orichon in 
isolation from the Illyrian territory 
which surrounded them. As time

went by, more and more lllyrians went 
to live in these cities and made a 
distinctive contribution to their life. 
The architecture of Apollonia is that 
of a typical slave-owning city. The 
aristocracy led a life of ease and 
luxury, as we can see from the 
sophisticated 1st-century B.C. houses 
excavated in the northwest of the city 
opposite the modern village of Pojan. 
There are floors of brightly-coloured 
mosaics, some of which are decorated 
with geometric and floral motifs, while 
others depict mythological scenes, 
such as Achilles fighting the Amazons. 
One of Apollonia’s most magnificent 
and best-preserved monuments was 
unearthed during systematic exca- 
vations carried out north of the city 
between 1964 and 1968. This is the 
nympheum, or monumental fountain, 
which was put up during the city’s most 
prosperous period, around the end of 
the 4th century B.C. 
Recent work in Dyrrhachion has 
also brought to light a number of 
important buildings, including the city’s 
amphitheatre, which is comparable in 
style and size to the biggest Roman 
amphitheatres found elsewhere in the 
Mediterranean world. Excavations at 
Bouthroton and Orichon have like- 
wise provided information about Alba- 
nia's ancient history and Illyrian in- 
volvement in the life of the Greek 
cities on the Coast. 
During the last 28 years, Albanian 
archaeologists have also made a 
detailed study of early medieval Alba- 
nia and have drawn particular attention 
to two points. Firstly, they stress that 
although Albanian civilization extended 
over a wide area, it had a pronounced 
degree of cultural unity. Secondly, 
they point to the persistence of Illyrian 
influences, particularly as reflected in 
metal ornaments of the period. 
The lllyrian tradition mainly survived 
where mining and metal-working contin- 
ued without a break, and in fact traces 
of the lllyrian cultural heritage still 
exist today in those parts of Albania 
where there are rich mineral deposits 
and where metals are mined and 
worked on the spot. But it is hardly 
surprising that the medieval Albanians 
should have inherited this and other 
traditions. They were after all the 
direct descendants of the lllyrians. 
This is not to say that early medieval 
Albanian civilization was immune to 
outside influences. It was not. Alba- 
nians learned much from their contact 
with the Roman and Byzantine worlds. 
Yet the crucial fact remains that the 
medieval Albanians were the direct 
descendants of the ancient lllyrians. 
They even owed their name to their 
Illyrian ancestry, for Byzantine chroni- 
clers used the name of one small llly- 
rian tribe, the Albanoi, to describe the 
whole Illyrian people.’ 
During the early Middle Ages this 
term and its derivatives such as 
Alban, Arban and Arber gradually came 
to denote the whole area occupied 
by the old indigenous lllyrian popu- 
lation. It is just one more proof to 
add to the multitude unearthed by 
archeologists, of the ancient roots o 
the Albanian people. |

### 50278: Onufri, master of fantasy and realism: a 16th-century Albanian painter of icons and frescoes virtually unknown outside his country

ONUEFRI 
MASTER OF FANTASY 
AND REALISM 
A 16th-century Albanian painter 
of icons and frescoes 
virtually unknown outside his country 
by Theophan Popa 
W.-. Michelangelo, Titian 
and Tintoretto were producing works 
of art in ltaly which became famous 
in their day, another great artist, only 
a few hundred kilometres away on the 
other side of the Adriatic, was painting 
masterpieces which are still practically 
unknown today outside his country. 
The artist, an Albanian priest, whose 
only name known to us is “Onufri”, 
produced a large number of frescoes 
and icons of rare quality and powerful 
originality. It is only now that he is 
beginning to find his place in the world 
of art as one of the great painters of 
his age. 
Onufri, most of whose works 
fortunately remain intact, worked 
chiefly at Elbasan, a small town in 
central Albania. He injected new life 
into the Byzantine pictorial art of his 
time which was until then shackled 
to medieval tradition. His influence 
led to a search for realistic human 
expression and movement, and to an 
 
THEOPHAN POPA, Albanian art historian, has 
dovated numerous studies to the work of 
nufri. 
attention to life-like detail which had 
never before appeared in Albanian 
painting. 
Albania was for many centuries part 
of the Byzantine empire. During the 
Middle Ages the Albanian Church 
observed Greek Orthodox rites, Greek 
became the country’s literary language, 
while Byzantine art and architecture, 
spreading from Constantinople, took 
root and flourished there. 
In the 13th and 14th centuries, under 
the Byzantine Paleologus dynasty, 
Albania enjoyed a period of remarkable 
economic and social progress. The 
feudal chiefs formed principalities 
which became independent of the 
Byzantine empire and less subjected to 
the political, religious and cultural 
authority of Constantinople. Artistic 
expression began to assume certain 
distinct characteristics of its own. 
One of these was a search for true- 
to-life art, but the movement was 
arrested at an early stage by the 
Ottoman conquest in the second half 
of the 15th century. 
A period of turbulence ensued 
during which the length and breadth 
of the land were torn asunder by 
insurrections against the invader. 
Struggling to defend their language 
and culture against the arbitrary rule 
of the Ottomans, the Albanians joined 
forces with their neighbours, Greeks, 
Serbs, Bulgarians, Macedonians and 
Montenegrans who were all trying to 
rid themselves of the common yoke. 
It was during these sorely trying times 
that Onufri appeared. 
We have very little information about 
the artist's life—neither the date of his 
birth nor that of his death are known. 
He worked during the first half of the 
16th century, and a few autographic 
inscriptions appear on some of his 
frescoes covering the walls of the 
churches of Elbasan, Shelcan and 
Valsh. Some of these inscriptions are 
simple prayers, and one of them dates 
the fresco as 1554. His son Nicola, 
who was also a painter, left some 
clues on a fresco painted in 1578— 
scraps of information indicating that 
Onufri married, had children, was 
ordained and became archpriest of 
Elbasan. 
Information about his artistic training 
is no more plentiful. He was probably 
able to study frescoes and icons at 
leisure, for at the time there were in- 
numerable and very fine examples of 
both. Some can still be seen today, 
but a great many have been lost. lt is 
almost certain that Onufri must have 
begun work in Berat, a lively centre 
on the river Osum. He presumably 
studied in the studio of a master- 
painter who, according to the custom 
of the times, passed on to his pupil 
the secrets of his art. 
The life-like expressions of Onufri's 
characters were a distinct departure 
from traditional Byzantine painting, and 
lead to the supposition that the painter 
visited Italy and gained inspiration from 
the various Renaissance schools which 
in the early 16th century were at the 
height of their brilliance. However, 
Onufri restricted his art to large-scale

Away from the traditional 
Towards a fresh realism 
A painter who deserves to be better known outside his 
country is the Albanian 16th-century artist, Onufri, who 
produced some of the most astonishing icons and frescoes 
of the late Middle Ages. Onufri, who had a keen eye for 
colour and form, often broke away from traditional Byzantine 
painting and took delight in enriching his works with realistic 
and shrewdly observed details of the landscapes, architec 
ture, clothing and other everyday objects of different parts 
of Albania. On this double page we present Onufri's 
magnificent icon painting, “The Nativity” (1) and four details 
from the same work: (2) a shepherd; the drinking gourd 
at his belt is exactly the same as those used today by 
Albanian shepherds. (3) One of the Three Kings. (4) The 
bathing of the Infant. (5) The archangel announcing the 
birth of Jesus; the shepherd's bonnet and musical instrument 
are still seen in Albania.

THE PRESENTATION IN THE TEMPLE, another icon painting by Onufri. 
Note how skilfully the artist manages to incorporate vaulted ceilings, 
pavilion roofs, balconies and other architectural features of his time 
into this work, depicting Mary, mother of Jesus, finding her son among 
the doctors in the temple at Jerusalem. The narrow coloured bands on 
the stole worn by the archpriest greeting Mary (detail below) are still 
a feature of Albanian folk art weaving.

mural paintings and to easel work 
for icons. 
His admirable frescoes cover the 
walls of the churches of St. Nicholas 
at Shelcan, St. Venerand at Valsh, 
near Elbasan, and St. Theodore at 
Berat. Other churches at Berat are 
richly decorated with his icons. He 
is known to have worked in Greece 
where he painted the fresco of the 
Holy Apostles’ Church in the Mace- 
donian town of Kastoria. His com- 
prehensive work embraces hundreds 
of single figures and scenes of a rich 
variety of compositions. 
Onufri observes the tradition of 
pictorial narrative which sought to 
provide religious instruction in works 
of art, but his compositions are power- 
fully original and the expressions of 
his subjects have a strong element of 
realism and imagination. This is 
particularly exemplified in an icon 
of the “Presentation in the Temple”, 
where the Virgin is met by the arch- 
priest and a number of women, 
Onufri likewise gave a new sense 
of realism to the treatment of accessory 
motifs. His “Entry into Jerusalem” has 
an architectural background showing 
red-tiled house-roofs with two eaves 
to drain off rain-water, just as they 
were in Elbasan during the painter's 
lifetime and just as they still are today. 
Another example is the “Last Supper” 
at which the Apostles have table- 
napkins decorated with narrow red 
bands. These motifs are still used 
today on table napkins in Albania. 
Again in the “Nativity” (both fresco 
and icon), Onufri paints a shepherd 
with a gourd attached to his belt just 
like the drinking gourds used today by 
Albanian shepherds. 
Right up to the 19th century all 
Albanian religious painting bore the 
stamp of Onufri's influence: his - 
plasticity of form, transparency and 
contrast of colour, dynamic compo- 
sition and intense spirituality in facial 
expression all played a decisive role 
in the subsequent trends followed by 
Albanian art. 
Besides Onufri’s son, Nicola, a whole 
line of anonymous 17th century painters 
followed in the master's fotsteps, but 
none of them grew to his stature. The 
18th century produced another Alba- 
nian master, David of Selenica, who 
reached a remarkable degree of per- 
fection, but creative originality in 
religious painting died with him. 
Onufri is now not only recognized 
as a great master of Albanian painting, 
but his name is beginning to take a 
deservedly prominent place among 
those artists who throughout the 
ages have enriched the cultural heri- 
tage of humanity as a whole. |

In some of his icons, 
Onufri seems to have let 
his imagination run wild, 
depicting hallucinating 
panoramas and landscapes 
peopled by strange 
diabolic or angelic 
creatures. “The Baptism 
of Christ” (right) is a 
remarkable example of

combined.

THE WORLD'S 
  
ON SILK 
  
OLDEST PAINTING 
Visions of Heaven, Earth 
and the Underworld 
in a 2,000-year-old Chinese tomb 
by Wen Pien 
1. April 1972 an early Han- 
dynasty tomb dating from the second 
century B.C. was discovered at Ma- 
‘Wang-T'ui in the eastern suburb of 
Ch'ang-sha, in Hunan Province. Ma- 
‘Wang-T'ui is a mound more than fifty 
metres across and more than twenty 
metres in height. In the tomb beneath 
the mound was discovered a woman's 
body in an astonishingly good state of 
preservation. The body, swathed with 
twenty layers of silk and gauze, was 
half immersed in a reddish fluid. 
The layout of the tomb is fairly 
elaborate. Its burial chamber lay 
20 metres below the top of the mound. 
Inside, at the centre of a triple 
enclosure of wooden planks was a 
triple coffin. Funerary objects were 
found between the wooden enclosures. 
Outside this was a covering of charcoal 
more than 30 cm. thick, weighing over 
10,000 chin (5 tons). This in turn was 
sealed with white clay 60 to 130 cm. 
thick. The charcoal and clay pro- 
tecting the coffin from damp and the 
means of embalmment used no doubt 
account for the extraordinary state of 
preservation of the body and burial 
accessories. . 
‘When the body was removed from 
the coffin, the skin and flesh were 
found to be so firm and supple that one 
could have believed the woman had 
only recently died. 
All three coffins are remarkable 
works of art. The outer casket, lac- 
quered black, has paintings in white, 
red and yellow of clouds or mist and 
strange beasts and birds wrestling, 
chasing each other and playing music 
or dancing. The middle casket, lac- 
quered red, is decorated with vigorous 
paintings of two dragons and two 
tigers fighting together. The innermost 
casket is. covered with silk having 
a ‘“satin-stitch®” embroidered border 
and ornamented with lozenge-shaped 
designs of golden, black and emerald 
feathers. This is the first discovery of 
a silk coffin-covering of this kind. 
Between the wooden enclosures 
were found over a thousand funerary 
objects, including silken fabrics, lac- 
querware, wooden, bamboo and pot- 
tery utensils, grain and other foodstuffs. 
Among the silk objects were more 
than forty garments, slippers and 
stockings, all in good condition, as well 
as more than twenty embroidered pil- 
lows, aromatic pouches and wrappers. 
There were also lengths of fabric 
38.5 cm. to 50 cm. wide which represent 
most of the varieties of Han-dynasty 
silk known to us: satin, silk, gauze, 
embroideries, brocade and damask. 
The designs, woven, painted or 
embroidered, depict animals, clouds, 
plants, flowers and variously shaped 
geometric designs. The gauze is so 
light that one white inner garment, 
128 cm. in length with sleeves measur- 
ing 190 cm. from cuff to cuff, weighs 
only 49 grammes. No thicker than 
the wings of a cicada, its texture is as 
fine as modern nylon. A brocade with 
a thick short pile on one side is another 
example of the high quality of Han- 
dynasty weaving. 
The colours of these fabrics, derived 
for the most part from vegetable dyes, 
include brown, crimson, grey, red, 
fawn, buff, yellow, green, blue and 
white. Discovered for the first time 
are some lengths of silk dyed with 
cinnabar or painted in gold and silver 
with printed designs. There are also 
linen fabrics of different textures, the 
finest having 36 cross-threads to each 
square centimetre. This has a smooth 
glossy surface and is as strong as new 
linen today. 
The most precious find, however, is 
the painting on silk draping the in- 
nermost coffin. Before the invention 
of paper it was usual for artists to 
paint on silk. This silk painting is 
T-shaped, 205 cm. long, 92 cm. wide 
at the top and just over half as wide 
at the bottom, with silk tassels attached 
to the corners. 
The objects depicted cover a wide 
range including human figures, the sun 
and moon, birds, beasts, reptiles and

COLOUR PAGES 
The 4 colour pages that follow are devoted 
to the oldest example of painting on silk 
found so far. The painting was discovered 
in China in an early Han Dynasty Tomb 
(2nd century B.C.) unearthed at Ch'ang-sha 
in Hunan Province. Everything inside the 
tomb was in an almost perfect state of 
conservation including the embalmed body 
of a woman preserved for 2,000 years. 
The painting on silk, the most precious 
find among over 1,000 objects, covered the 
innermost casket of the woman's triple 
coffin. The painting comprises three 
sections representing the universe: Heaven, 
Earth and the Nether Regions, and is filled 
with creatures and representations from 
Chinese legends and mythology. The 
complete painting is shown on page 20.

legendary monsters, as well as sacri- 
ficial vessels and musical instruments. 
The whole painting is divided into three 
sections, representing the Heavens, 
the Earth, and the Nether Regions. 
The upper section depicts a scene 
in heaven. In the upper right-hand 
corner is a round sun, inside it a crow 
and under it eight smaller suns with 
spreading foliage between them. 
According to an ancient Chinese myth 
there were once ten suns and ten 
golden crows on a huge tree known as 
fusang in a place called Tang-Ku. 
These ten suns circled the sky in turn. 
When one sun came out, carried on 
the back of its crow, the other nine 
would rest under the boughs of the 
tree. A sun being carried by a crow 
may have symbolized the cycle of day 
and night. 
Once all ten suns came out at the 
same time, so that plants and crops 
hegan to shrivel. Then the sage king 
Yao ordered a famous archer, Yi, to 
shoot them down, and Yi shot down 
nine suns and nine crows. This 
painting shows eight small suns only. 
Perhaps the artist deliberately con- 
cealed the ninth behind the leaves. 
1 the upper left-hand 
corner is a crescent moon with a toad 
and a white hare in it, while a woman 
on a winged dragon is ascending 
towards it. This is a scene from 
another ancient myth which relates how 
the woman, Ch'ang Ngo, wife of the 
archer Yi, stole the elixir of immortality 
which her husband had obtained from 
the Queen Mother of the West and 
fled to the moon. 
Between the sun and the moon 
hovers Ch'u lung, a deity with a man’s 
head and a serpent's body, who has 
authority over heaven and earth. Five 
stork-like birds are flying towards him. 
Further down in the middle hangs a 
bell. The two capped and robed figu- 
res with folded hands below it are 
either the musicians who sound the 
bell or guardians of the gate of heaven. 
Flanking them are two horizontal 
beams each supporting a vertical 
board, and on these boards are two 
leopards spotted red. The wooden 
structures probably represent the gate 
of heaven which the leopards are 
guarding. On either side of the bell 
are monsters riding on horses towards 
the sun and the moon, beneath which 
winged dragons with claws and fangs 
are breathing out red flames. 
In the middle section, the main part

guardians of the gates of heaven (here

of the painting, is a dignified and 
elegant old lady with elaborately 
dressed hair who is walking slowly 
with the help of a stick. Two kneeling 
figures in front are welcoming her with 
trays of food in their hands, while 
behind are three maidservants. 
This old lady, the central figure in 
the painting, is a noblewoman. The 
curtain above her may represent some 
hangings in the sacrificial hall, while 
the horizontal line with coloured 
lozenge designs below the figures 
presumably stands for the ground. 
The lower section of the painting 
appears to represent the earth and the 
ocean. Under the horizontal earth-line 
is a jade pendant, a symbol of nobility, 
from which two dragons are issuing 
and rearing upwards. Strings of beads 
suspended from the pendant fan out 
on either side above a jade chime, and 
on them perch winged birds with 
human heads. 
Below these are two short tables 
beside which, facing each other, sit 
two rows of seven neatly dressed 
figures with folded hands. The tripods, 
boxes, pots, bowls and other utensils 
on the tables may be the sacrifice for 
the dead lady. 
Underneath, supporting the tables 
with both hands, a mighty monster, half 
man and half bear, stands astride two 
fish-like monsters. Beside it are two 
tortoises with two owls on their backs. 
Since owls come out only at night, 
shunning the light of day, they are 
usually depicted as creatures of the 
Nether Regions. 
At the very bottom are the two sea 
monsters with protruding mouths, fish 
tails and spotted intertwined bodies. 
These may be the creature called Ao 
which, according to early Chinese 
mythology, could support the heaviest 
weights. That would explain why they 
form the base of the whole compo- 
sition. 
Thus the striking scenes painted on 
the silk were inspired by myths and 
legends or represented the life of that 
period. Whether imaginary or based 
on life, they have been arranged by 
this unknown artist into one perfect 
whole, a gem of ancient pictorial art 
reflecting the high level reached by the 
Chinese painters of old. 
The composition, though so rich in 
content, is no mere jumble of objects 
but pleasingly presented. The chief 
subject, the dead lady, has the central 
position to give prominence to the 
main theme, while the sun and moon 
and other accessories form an integral 
part of the whole. 
The lines are fluid and vigorous and 
the objects depicted are remarkably 
lifelike. The garments of the dead 
lady, for example, are painted with 
exquisite delicacy of touch which 
conveys the texture of silk, while we 
can see that the monster supporting 
the earth is flexing its powerful 
muscles. The sun and moon, the 
dragons, leopards, tortoises, birds and 
sea monsters appear thoroughly vivid 
and lifelike. 
The use of such mineral dyes as 
cinnabar, azurite and malachite has 
produced glowing and resplendent 
colours, while the perfect symmetry of 
the composition induces a sense of 
order and harmony. 
The tomb has also yielded more than 
180 pieces of lacquerware retaining 
their original lustre. Some of the lines 
on the surface designs are as fine as 
silken threads. Most of these wares 
are inscribed inside or outside with the 
name of the owner or with the purpose 
and capacity of the utensils. When 
first unearthed some of them contained 
lotus-root, or food made of rice and 
flour. On some lacquer plates were 
ox-bones, chicken-bones and fish. 
I. objects made of 
bamboo and wood include 162 wooden 
figurines, 312 bamboo slips and 48 
bamboo vessels. The wooden fi- 
gurines are dressed in coloured gar- 
ments or have clothing painted on 
them. Twenty-three of them are giving 
a performance of music and dancing; 
opposite them are lacquer stands, 
screens, a walking-stick, a scented 
pouch, a powder-box and lacquer trays 
heaped with food. This evidently 
represents a feast during the dead 
lady's lifetime. 
Slips of bamboo were used for 
writing on before the invention of 
paper. Those found in the tomb were 
inscribed in elegant calligraphy with 
the number, size and name of different 
objects in the tomb. These ink in- 
scriptions are still clear and unblurred. 
The woven bamboo vessels with covers 
contained silk, pendants, meat, veg- 
etables, eggs, fruit and medicinal herbs. 
Among the musical instruments are 
a 25-stringed zither 1.16 metres long 
with four pegs; a pipe-organ 20 cm. 
long with 22 pipes in two rows; and 
twelve bamboo pitch-pipes. These 
well-preserved musical instruments 
provide valuable material for the study 
of ancient Chinese music. 
There were 50 pottery objects in the 
tomb including tripods, food containers 
with lids and wine-pots, some with 
a yellow glaze or painted surface. 
Jhese contained cereals, pickles and 
ruit. 
Inscriptions in ink or clay seals on 
the funerary ware indicate that these 
objects belonged to the family of the 
Marquis of T'ai. According to Han- 
dynasty histories, the hereditary title 
of Marquis of Tai was created in 
193 B.C. and the title remained in the 
family for four generations. The 
woman in the tomb was probably the 
wife of the first marquis. This 
nobleman, who was chancellor of the 
Prince of Ch’ang-sha, ranked relatively 
low in the Han aristocracy. 
The unearthing of the Ma-Wang-T ui 
tomb is a significant discovery in 
contemporary Chinese archaeology, a 
find of considerable value for the study 
of the culture and history of the early 
Han Dynasty. |

THE ENIGMA 
OF ECUADOR’S 
ANCIENT POTTERY 
Did it receive the imprint 
of an Asian people 4,500 years ago ? 
by Jorge Enrique Adoum 
Aoresonc the Royal 
Geological Society in London just 
over a century ago, Sir Roderick Mur- 
chison, a well-known British geologist 
declared: “There was human civiliz- 
ation... in South America at the time 
of the older Stone Age in Western 
Europe.” 
Sir Roderick based his statement 
on the discovery of some ceramic 
vessels and gold figurines that James 
S. Wilson had unearthed two years 
earlier, in 1860, at an archaeological 
site on the coast of Ecuador. 
The site of the discoveries was the 
scene of the first known “geological 
tragedy” in that part of the South 
American continent which was destin- 
ed to become Ecuador. It consisted 
of a stratum of vegetal loam covered 
over with a thick layer of marine 
deposits, indicating that the Ecuadorian 
coast was once inhabited but then sank 
into the sea, only to rise again 
thousands of years later. 
We do not know exactly what the 
objects were that Wilson discovered 
or where they are today. What we do 
know is that the “biography” of the 
Ecuadorian people goes back to the 
Valdivia culture which dates from 3200 
to 1800 B.C. A number of ceramic 
pieces of this period are to be seen in 
 
JORGE ENRIQUE ADOUM, Ecuadorian poet 
and writer, was formerly National Director 
of Culture in Ecuador. Among his works 
are a 4-volume poetic cycle, “Los Cuadernos 
de la Tierra" (Notebooks on my Country, 
1952-1962), and a play on the fall of the Inca 
Empire following the Spanish Conquest 
entitled “El Sol Bajo las Patas de los 
Caballos™ (The Sun Trampled by Horses’ 
Hooves). He is now a member of the 
editorial staff of the “Unesco Courier”. 
a magnificent exhibition of pre-Colum- 
bian art from Ecuador that has been 
travelling through Europe since 1973. 
How Ecuador was given its name—it 
mean “equator” in Spanish—makes an 
interesting story. It was originally a 
confederation of tribes which 16th 
century chroniclers baptized the King- 
dom of Quito. In the Spanish colonial 
period it was known as the Real 
Audiencia de Quito (the Judicial Dis- 
trict of Quito under the authority of 
the Spanish Crown), and afterwards 
the Presidencia (Presidential District) 
of Quito. 
By 1736 it was well known that the 
earth was round and measurements 
had been made of the terrestrial 
meridians in the polar regions. That 
year the French Royal Academy of 
Science sent a mission of geodesists 
to Quito to ascertain whether, as a 
result of its rotation, the earth was 
flattened at the equator as Giovanni 
Domenico Cassini, director of the 
Paris observatory, had claimed, instead 
of at the poles as Newton had main- 
tained. 
The surveyors found the equinoctial 
line to be twenty kilometres north of 
the capital, Quito. This is -probably 
the only place where the line is not 
just an imaginary one: it has been 
drawn on the concrete base of a 
commemorative pyramid. The country 
then began to be called the “Land of 
the Equator” and subsequently this 
name was officially adopted, though it 
was somewhat ambiguous and could 
suggest that the country lay in Africa 
or some other place through which 
the earth's longest parallel passes. 
The relative isolation of South 
America from the rest of the world 
was originally a geological phenomenon 
dating back some two hundred million 
years. According to the theory of the 
German geophysicist, Alfred Wegener, 
South America was once a part of a 
single land mass that also included 
what are now the territories of 
Antarctica, Africa, India and Australia. 
This mass had in turn broken off from 
the primeval land mass that further 
comprised present-day Europe, North 
America, Greenland and Asia. 
The future continents separated and 
moved westward, and as they did so 
they left behind telltale traces of their 
breakaway. The Red Sea, for example, 
is a vestige of the sundering of Africa 
from Asia, and North America seems 
to have left Greenland behind as it 
migrated ever farther to the west. 
Meanwhile South America had worked 
itself loose from the vast continent that 
Wegener called Gondwana, and form- 
ed an immense island drifting away 
from the rest of the world. 
If we look closely at a map of the 
world, we see that the eastern coast 
of South America fits perfectly into 
the western coast of Africa, hke a 
piece in a jigsaw puzzle about to be 
set in place. (For an earlier treatment 
of Wegener's theory of continental 
drift, which he formulated in 1912, 
see the “Unesco Courier”, October 
1963, p. 7.) 
Science, however, is not content, 
to rely on such superficial evidence. 
It has dug deeper and found convinc- 
ing proof of Wegener's thesis in the 
geological links between South Amer- 
ica, Africa, India and Australia, in 
the continuity of the Mid-Ocean Ridge 
with its branches, and in a certain 
“family connexion” to be found bet-

ECUADOR’'S ANCIENT POTTERY 
(Continued) 
ween animal species that are now 
extinct on the New Continent—such as 
the woolly mammoth and the sabre- 
toothed tiger—and those, past and 
present, of the African continent. 
Here let us note that the oral 
history of peoples always begins with 
a legend. Throughout South America 
there is a legend, first recorded by the 
Spanish Chroniclers of the Indies, 
about an invasion of giants who came 
from the sea, destroyed the indigenous 
towns and raised megalithic monu- 
ments along the Pacific coast. 
This legend may have its origin in 
the discovery of large-sized bones 
which, according to Alexander Hum- 
boldt, the German scientist and 
explorer (1769-1859), must have 
been "the remains of enormous un- 
known cetaceans”; according to some 
more imaginative archaeologists, they 
were the bones of the Andes masto- 
don or “carnivorous elephant”. 
But anthropologists are also per- 
plexed by the enigma of America. 
They are not so much concerned with 
giants as with knowing how man first 
came to South America. The mon- 
goloid features that are still apparent 
in the New World Indians seem to 
point to an Asian origin. 
Professor Juan Comas, a leading 
authority on Latin American anthropo- 
logy, asserts—and it is now consider- 
ed an established fact—that 40,000 
years ago wanderers from Asia cross- 
ed the Bering Strait on an ice bridge 
about fifty miles wide that then linked 
the two continents (See article by 
Prof. Comas, in the “Unesco Courier”, 
August-September 1972, p. 46). By 
that time the land bridge of Central 
America had emerged from the ocean 
and thus enabled the nomads from 
the north to travel as far south as 
Tierra del Fuego.

Other theorists, such as Professor 
Paul Rivet, former director of the 
Paris Musée de I'Homme, who carried 
out research in Ecuador, claim that 
there was a twofold current of mi- 
gration, a northern one made up of 
Mongolians and Eskimos who came 
by way of the Bering Strait, and a 
southern one consisting of Malayan- 
Polynesians who crossed the Pacific 
Ocean in fragile open sailing-craft. 
Characteristics of the australoid 
race of Lagoa Santa in Brazil are 
also exhibited by the first-known 
“Ecuadorian”, Punin man, whose skull 
was unearthed some 50 years ago in 
central Ecuador. Punin man is 6,000 
years old according to carbon-14 tests. 
DOUBLE-CONE CERAMIC JAR 
Bartholomé Ruiz, the first Spanish 
navigator to reach the coast of 
Ecuador in 1526, described with 
wonder a sea-going craft used by 
the Mantas Indians {a raft with a 
lateen sail) and the objects it carried. 
Dating from 500 B.C., the Mantena 
culture on the central coast of Ecuador 
was noted for its outstanding 
craftsmanship in metal and stone. 
Its pottery, usually coloured black, 
featured superb animal and human 
figures, realistically depicted or 
stylized in shapes as unexpected 
as this double-cone vessel topped 
with a human head.

Pre-Columbian remains found along 
the coast of Ecuador have been seen 
by some as evidence that Asians 
came to Ecuador 2,500 years before 
the Christian Era, blown off their 
course by a storm, and exerted a 
strong influence on the aboriginal 
cultures. 
Dolico-cephalic skulls (long narrow) 
belonging to a fishing people were 
found in a lower stratum in Valdivia, 
whereas a more recent level has 
yielded the remains of a brachy-ce- 
phalic people (round headed) who 
introduced agriculture and a technique 
of baking clay so highly developed 
that the Valdivia culture may be 
considered the first ceramic centre in 
the New World. 
Moreover, their ceramic "Venuses” 
nave certain traits in common with 
the statuettes of the Jomon culture 
in Japan, and both types may possibly 
be related to some fertility cult 
common to both sides of the Pacific. 
The figurines aiso suggest that an 
early matriarchal society existed in 
Ecuador. Some of the coastal tribes 
worshipped the goddess Umifia, “god- 
dess of the green stone”, which may 
be a reference to jade. 
Additional evidence of links with 
Asia comes from the Chorrera culture 
of Ecuador (1800 to 500 B.C.) with

VENUS 
OF VALDIVIA 
These three figurines are 
believed to represent female 
divinities. They are works 
of pottery of the Valdivia 
culture which developed on 
the southern coast of Ecuador 
from 3200 to 1800 B.C. 
Valdivia potters produced a 
great variety of ceramic 
“Venuses” (rarely over 
5 cm. high) using finger-nails 
to shape eyes and eyebrows, 
mouths and hair. Certain 
scholars have advanced the 
hypothesis that pottery was 
introduced to Ecuador by an 
Asian (Japanese?) people 
who reached the Ecuadorian 
coast by 2500 B.C. and under 
whose influence the modelling 
and baking of clay developed. 
its figures displaying typically oriental 
features and its finely-drawn ceramic 
work decorated with an iridescent 
metallic paint the technique of which 
remains unknown—subjected to tem- 
peratures of 1,000 degrees in labora- 
tory tests, the metallic film still clings 
to the underlying pottery. 
Other Asian associations are seen 
in the Chorrera clay models of build- 
ings on truncated or stepped pyramids 
that are reminiscent of pagoda struc- 
tures, and, most particularly, in a large 
number of “neck rests”, similar to the 
type of oriental pillow made of fine 
porcelain or willow branches that could 
still be purchased in antique shops in 
Peking or Shanghai when the author 
was there a few years ago. 
The most convincing piece of 
evidence, however, for certain advo- 
cates of the Asian hypothesis is to be 
found in the similarity between the 
rudders of rafts still used for navig- 
ation in South America, Viet-Nam and 
Taiwan. Since such rudders existed 
in China five centuries before the 
Christian Era, it has been assumed 
that they could have come from Asia 
to South America. 
But the sea can be crossed in both 
directions. in 1947 Thor Heyerdahl, 
the Norwegian anthropologist and 
explorer, built one of these rafts, the 
  
Kon-Tiki, on which he sailed from the 
Peruvian port of Callao to the atoll 
of Raroia in an attempt to prove that 
the islands of Polynesia were origin- 
ally inhabited by aborigines from 
South America, remote ancestors of 
the mythical “noble savage” imagined 
by Montesquieu and discovered later 
by the French navigator, Louis de 
Bougainville, and by Captain James 
Cook. 
Whatever the point of departure 
may have been, there is no doubt 
that there were trans-Pacific and 
inter-American contacts. The gigantic 
sculptures of Chile's Easter Island are 
parents—or children—of Polynesian 
wood sculpture. The cultivation of 
maize spread from Central America 
to the southernmost part of the South 
American continent. Utensils indispu- 
tably made in Ecuador have been 
found in Panamanian graves. In Ecua- 
dor and Peru there are place-names 
of Arawakan-Caribbean origin, and 
the great variety of human types 
found in the statuettes of the La 
Tolita culture in northern Ecuador 
either reflect striking ethnic differen- 
ces or are the exaggerated, grotesque 
or even caricatural rendering of the 
features of strange invaders who 
landed on the coasts. 
Some clay models represent houses 
on stilts for protection against floods 
and wild beasts; others, built like 
sanctuaries on platforms, seem to 
imply the existence of a hierarchized 
and stratified society where political 
and religious power was in the hands 
of priest-chiefs and shamans whose 
dignity was easily recognized by their 
pectoral ornaments and nose-rings. 
Ocarinas, whistles, rattles and drums 
no doubt played an important part 
in the religious rites performed to 
appease the gods. From mollusc 
shells they made recipients, orna- 
ments, and strings of beads as fine 
as two millimetres in: diameter which 
served as a kind of money for trade 
with the Andean peoples who acquir- 
ed them in order to compel their own 
gods to give them rain. 
All these cultures had different 
languages and different customs, 
though they had some features in 
common. For example, they all equat- 
ed art and craftsmanship. The artist 
was considered a useful member of 
society because he wrought vessels 
and utensils for domestic use, and 
the artist, feeling the community's 
need for art, produced artifacts that 
were aesthetically pleasing to behold 
and to live with. 
The extraordinary number of fig- 
urines found in La Tolita lead neces-

ECUADOR’S ANCIENT POTTERY 
(Continued) 
sarily to the conclusion that many 
people, perhaps the entire population, 
were engaged in making and selling 
their artistic well-crafted products. 
These were cultures whose oral 
traditions escape us. Centuries of 
imagination, creative effort and spiri- 
tual turmoil would be needed in order 
to develop systematic religion with 
mythical concepts of bird-men or 
leopard-men and idots which did not 
merely represent divinities, but actually 
incarnated them. 
No one knows how this ideological 
process evolved or how long it went 
on. It must have culminated in a 
belief in some sort of survival of the 
soul, otherwise why would they have 
placed the bodies of their dead in a 
foetal position and buried them with 
jewels, pottery, clothing and food, as 
though replacing them in the womb 
of earth to be reborn to another life? 
What intense hope must have gone 
into the effort to replace realism by 
a more abstract representation, and 
led to the unbridled “baroque” decor- 
ation on the vessels known as 
“witches’ cauldrons”, and the overly 
ornamented costumes still worn 
by dancers in solstice celebrations 
and on other high days. These co- 
incide with the major feasts of the 
Christian calendar, though their signi- 
ficance has been forgotten. 
like all popular festivities, they are a 
way to cast off all restraints, perhaps 
nothing more than a manifestation of 
the humble human need to be “king 
for a day”. 
It is important to remember that 
since the wheel was unknown in these 
early cultures, they had no wheel on 
which to mould pottery, But nothing 
has ever prevented any people from 
developing the noble and all-embrac- 
ing art of pottery in which man takes 
a handful of earth and fashions his 
own creations. 
Perfectly symmetrical whorls for 
spindles were made by craftsmen of 
the Guangala culture of Ecuador (500 
B.C. to 500 A.D.) and its jars have 
been compared to those of Crete. 
Olaf Holm, the German archaeologist, 
maintained that the ancient potters 
must have used large disk-shaped 
platters which they rotated with one 
hand while modelling the vessel they 
were making with the other. 
The road from clay to metal was 
also a long one. No doubt gold was 
more elegantly wrought in other coun- 
tries, but it was in La Tolita, from 
500 B.C. to 500 A.D. that man first 
worked with platinum. The Danish 
scientist, Paul Bergsoe, discovered 
that the secret lay in softening the 
platinum by mixing it with molten 
gold—a technique that only began to 
be used in Europe in the 18th century. 
These cultures lacked the plough 
in addition to the wheel. They sur- 
vived—as some still do—on cereals 
and potatoes. From one period to 
the next, and from one region to 
another, they doggedly waged their 
Perhaps, . 
Wess 
dramatic struggle against the environ- 
ment, though not always successfully. 
Along the coast they were plagued 
with eruptions of now extinct volca- 
noes, long periods of drought, and 
the formation of saltpetre beds that 
make agriculture impossible. 
In the mountains there was the 
bleak paramo with its scrubby vege- 
tation, its drizzly rain and the mist 
which envelops the two Cordilleras of 
the Andes—that double backbone of 
the land, made up of volcanoes and 
snow-covered peaks rising as high as 
six thousand metres above sea level, 
with warm, temperate valleys between 
them like hollows in the vertebrae of 
a continental spinal column. 
And on the other side of the moun- 
tain range were the Amazonian 
jungles, the domain of wild monkeys 
and jaguars, where snakes laid their 
eggs on leaves that had been piling 
up since primeval times. 
The diversity of climates gave rise 
to a wide variety of products and 
cultivation techniques, but man was 
first of all, here as elsewhere, a 
hunter. The deer was not only a 
figure in the mythology and art of 
primitive man but also provided his 
. basic food and bony material with 
which to manufacture tools. 
The tutelary and totemic animal of 
~- a
  
- gd — LI LEN 
the South American Indians was 
the llama, a symbol of the silent 
wastes of the Andes. From time to 
time fish crop up as decorative motifs 
on their pottery, but this was the mark 
of other cultures which sooner or 
later began to influence them, or a 
result of the descent of mountain 
tribes to the coast. 
The desolation of the brushwood 
tablelands, the stillness scarcely bro- 
ken by the wind and the mountainous 
landscape with its double barrier that 
acts like a set of blinkers preventing 
man from seeing beyond them—all 
those forced the individual to look 
either down at the ground or up at 
the stars, both of which prompted him 
to ask questions about himself. 
The plateau-dweller had the same 
aesthetic feeling for utensils of current 
use and the same desire to decorate 
functional objects as his cousins on the 
coast, but the austerity of his environ- 
ment caused him to express himself 
in more severe art forms. 
The Carchi culture had a clear pre- 
ference for negative painting. The 
hieratic attitude of their sculptured 
figures was emphasized by the use 
of black, and a dramatic facial 
expression was obtained by using 
substances that made the eyes seem 
to shed tears of colour.

La Tolita, an island at the 
northern efd of the Ecuadorian 
coast, show a highly : 
developed form of art. They 
may represent religious, 
human-animal figures to 
conjure” evil spirits. Left, 
the terracotta figure 
(21.5 cm. by 255 cm.) is a 
fragment of a pottery of 
unknown shape. Right,

La Tolita, strongly suggests 
links between this culture 
and those” of Central America. 
So many of these objects 
have been found in La Tolita 
that it would seem that the 
whole population of the island 
was engaged in pottery-making.

the arms of Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, 
is an apt description of the evolution 
of that ancient city in the heart of the 
Balkans which continues to modernize 
and look to the future while preserving 
its 7,000 years-old links with the past. 
The central part of the city, which is 
still in the process of change above 
ground, extends over the buried 
remains of several civilizations, com- 
prising strata of ruined cities to a depth 
of 10 metres. 
From the now scarcely identifiable 
traces of an ancient Thracian settle- 
ment to the vestiges of later cultures, 
the whole of this archaeological 
complex records the troubled history 
of a city often besieged by invaders 
and destroyed several times. 
Lying at the crossroads of the

Balkans peninsula, set in a fertile well- 
watered plain surrounded by mountains 
and forests filled with game, and famed 
for its mineral springs and baths, Sofia

situation. 
The "heart” of the city is still the 
same: it is the Forum of the Roman 
town of Serdica, the centre of medieval 
Bulgarian Sredets and the main 
square of the Sofia liberated less than 
a century ago from foreign domination 
—a square today named after Lenin.

five steps down below the ground.

built, the towers were about 10 metres 
high. Today their ruins reach the 
ceiling of the hall at a height of about 
four metres. 
Behind these fortifications the ruins 
of another wall, built in alternating 
layers of stone and brick, were also 
unearthed. Fortifications and wall are 
both four metres thick. It is not by 
chance that Serdica's fortress was 
claimed to be impregnable and that 
only a long siege could force the city's 
defenders to open its gates. 
The second wall dates from the time 
of Constantine (4th century) but an 
inscription cut in a great stone slab 
displayed in the hall indicates that 
Serdica also had a defensive wall as 
early as the 2nd century, at the time of 
the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. These 
fortifications protected the city even 
after its occupation by the Slavs and 
inclusion in Bulgaria in the Sth century, 
but were destroyed in 1382 when the 
Turks besieged and captured Sredets, 
as it was known by that time. 
The outer gate leads to an enclosed 
space in which are entrances to the 
towers, well preserved up to their 
arches. There is an inner gate on the 
opposite side of the enclosure. On 
the threshold of both gates traces of 
the ruts left by the passage over many 
centuries of innumerable iron-rimmed 
wheels of carts and patricians’ chariots 
are still visible.

gates is paved with thick stone slabs. 
Most of them are parts of the magni- 
ficently ornamented cornices and 
architraves, with their sculptured sides 
face downwards. They once adorned 
the facades of buildings and porticos 
around the forum of Serdica. 
The Roman city, which grew and 
prospered in the second to fourth 
centuries, was devastated in the fifth 
century by the Goths, the Huns and 
other invaders. In the sixth century, 
under lustinian, the city regained its 
importance, but during the vicissitudes 
of the ensuing centuries much of its 
magnificence was to be trampled under 
foot and buried. Today men of the 
20th century are again walking on the 
original stone slabs. 
The finds were not unexpected, 
' because archaeologists had the plan 
of the ancient lay-out of the city, and 
parts of the old fortifications had

Passage to Serdica 
Stepping down one of the four 
entrances to the subway (above) 
pedestrians find themselves 
among the amphoras, mosaics 
and sculpted reliefs of the world 
of antiquity. Going along the 
passage, they can follow the 
ancient road through Roman 
Serdica from the citadel gate to 
the forum (above right) treading 
on the original paving stones, 
still well preserved. Right, a 
carved stone slab of the 4th 
century A.D., representing circus 
games with riders, wild animals 
and their keepers. The slab, 
which may have once decorated 
Serdica’s Circus, is now in the 
Sofia Archaeological Museum.

But as soon as the work of excava- 
tion started, archaeologists realized 
that the old east gate would be 
unearthed in an exceptionally good 
state, considering that the town had 
been destroyed and rebuilt so many 
times. So it was decided to modify 
the course originally planned for the 
passage and to allow more time and 
money for its construction.

tower? The inhabitants of Sofia do. 
Above, like the prow of a ship or some

has been placed on one of the walls.

magnificent 6th century basilica of

### 50283: The Enigma of Ecuador's ancient pottery; did it receive the imprint of an Asian people 4,500 years ago?

36 
  
ECUADOR’S ANCIENT POTTERY 
Continued from page 28 
Physical anthropologists may sigh 
when they come upon skulls that have 
been deformed into the shape of a 
cone (probably for ritualistic reasons), 
and when figurative representations 
depart from strict realism and do not 
portray the typical physical traits 
that they are looking for. But the 
gradual development of art is the 
result of changes in man's way of 
looking at himself. 
The Cashaloma and Tacalshapa 
cultures, the last ones to survive 
before the invasion of the great 
Inca armies, had worked out a theory 
of form and colour, mass and line, 
in harmony with their environment. 
Here we find an early manifestation 
of artistic freedom with a breakaway 
from stylized forms, the use of free, 
arbitrary shapes, the asymmetrical 
application of colours, and the transfer 
of textile designs onto the nude bodies 
of the miniature caryatids that sup- 
ported their fruit dishes, Could this 
be the origin of.tatooing in Ecuador? 
These cultures possessed no writing. 
But their masks seem to indicate that 
they had developed a rudimentary form 
of theatre. The features are usually 
very expressive, contorted, grimacing 
or wrinkled, and sometimes sardonic. 
I wonder whether the masks found 
in tombs, on skulls ten or twenty cent- 
uries old, are meant to capture the 
true essence of the departed, faceless 
and unknown. Or were they intended 
as a disguise so that the divinities 
could not recognize the person enter- 
ing heaven? Or were they simply to 
frighten off evil spirits and demons? 
True art never really answers ques- 
tions; on the contrary it gives rise to 
them. The axiom that aesthetics has 
precedence over logic. or that a sense 
of form came before speech was 
developed, may apply to the Pre- 
Columbian civilizations in Ecuador. 
The examples of Pre-Columbian art 
touring Europe are a retrospective 
exhibition of the works of the Ecua- 
dorian artist covering slightly more 
than three thousand years. A whole 
people left the sign of its hand on 
these, plates, pitchers and statuettes, 
and thus created a cultural identity 
that can be recognized not only 
through the objects but in the works 
of art themselves, 
The Incas arrived from the south in 
the middle of the 15th century. Theirs 
was one of the great great civilizations 
of history: theocratic (they worshipped 
the sun), an absolute hierarchy (the 
Inca was considered the son of God 
and his mediator on earth), imperialist 
(they called their Empire “The Four 
Corners of the Earth”, encompassing 
the entire universe). 
When they conquered the aboriginal 
tribes they made Quito their second 
capital. They amazed the Spanish 
with their mathematically hierarchized 
social organization, their dignified and 
forbidding demeanour, and their gift 
for town-planning based, as an Ecua- 
dorian archaeologist recently wrote, 
“upon a respect for ecology and the 
introduction of Nature into the urban 
environment and the architectonic 
space.” This briefly, is a description 
of the colossal sacred citadel of 
Machu Picchu the mystery of whose 
construction may never be deciphered. 
But that is another story,

This curious object is a whistle-bottle 
of the Bahia culture of Ecuador, 
composed of three round 
inter-connected vessels of polished 
grey earthenware decorated with 
human-animal heads. The Bahia 
culture produced earthenware 
headrests and structures with 
pagoda-shaped roofs. These and 
other objects have been seen by certain 
specialists as evidence of direct 
early contact between Asia 
and South America. 
Half tortoise, half iguana, the vessel 
immediately below was produced by 
the Bahia culture during Ecuador's 
so-called “Period of Regional 
Development” (500 B.C. to 500 A.D.). 
The tripod with human feet belongs 
to the Carchl! culture of northern Ecuador. 
It is of the so-called “Period of 
Integration” (500 to 1500 A.D.). 
The geometric motif is produced by 
painting the background and leaving 
the pattern the colour of the original 
clay, a technique known as “negative 
painting”. The two works bring to mind 
similar Chinese objects.

POP OR NO POP? 
We thank the many readers who 
replied to our query “Want an issue 
on pop music?” The replies 
show a majority in favour of an 
issue on pop and other forms of 
modern music. A large percentage 
come from young people, but a 
significant proportion are from older 
readers who want to know more 
about pop, including its origins, 
meaning and social significance. An 
issue on pop is planned for late 
next year. Space permits us to 
publish only a few of the many 
letters received. 
Sir, 
An issue on pop and other forms 
of modern music would have a 
universal appeal. | shall look forward 
to its publication. 
Mary Dewhurst 
Burlington, Ontario 
Canada 
Sir, 
My reply is Not This Is not a 
suitable subject for a serious magazine 
such as the “Unesco Courier”. Pop 
music gives a harmful slant to the 
moulding of young minds and tastes. 
It also turns young people away from 
the beauties of our folk-music and 
from the classics—the finest music of 
all. 
L. Carrion 
Sao Gabriel 
Ric Grande do Sul, Brazil 
Sir, 
| suggest you include articles dealing 
with the origins of pop music and its 
different forms and styles. The issue 
will help people to understand this 
kind of music, which has become so 
obviously a part of present-day culture, 
and no form of culture should be 
looked down upon. 
Matti Palomaki 
Turku, Finland 
Sir, 
| enjoyed your June 1973 issue devot- 
ed to “Music of the Centuries” and 
| would welcome an issue on pop. | 
am not an expert on modern pop, but 
| think that as time goes by it will 
be seen as something unique and 
revolutionary in the history of music. 
Raymond Laberge 
Villeneuve, Quebec 
Canada 
Sir, 
Bravo for your idea. | teach music 
to 300 young people at a technical 
education centre and believe me, pop 
makes a far bigger impact on them 
than classical music or jazz. The 
young are seeking a language for the 
20th century. | try to understand them, 
but it is not easy for an adult. Seo 
let the specialists enlighten us on the 
pop craze. 
Ch. Tripp 
Belfort, France 
Letters to the Editor  
Sir, 
Because | was made to practise the 
piano from the age of 5 to the age 
of 18, and because | was saturated 
with Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Mendels- 
sohn, etc., | found myself, as an adult, 
addicted to Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky, 
Messiaen, etc. Now at the age of 
61, | am a fan of King Crimson, Pink 
Floyds and other pop stars and collect 
their records. | confess that for me 
pop has blotted out all other music. 
With its violence and despair, its 
planetary use of instruments from every 
continent and played by the teen-agers 
who are the world of tomorrow, it is 
the real pulse of our times. Thank 
you for the June 1973 issue devoted 
to non-European music. 
N. Provins 
Paris, France 
Sir, 
Please, Please, NO pop issue. The 
British Broadcasting Corporation and 
all the world's record companies cater 
for ALL mankind's needs in this respect. 
G. England 
Porthcawl, United Kingdom 
Sir, 
Pop is not a subject that should 
concern Unesco. With so many other 
media, pouring it out, it is practically 
impossible not to know something 
about it. 
Why not wait another ten years by 
which time the controversy will have 
died away—if pop still exists. By then 
it will have become part of the world's 
musical heritage—whether one likes it 
or not. 
Robert Daigneault 
Montreal, Canada 
Sir, 
A great idea, but please include an 
article on "Musica Contesta” (Protest 
Music) or “Cancién Protesta” (Songs 
of Protest) now so popular throughout 
Latin America. 
David Gonzales Gross 
Palma Soriano, Cuba 
Sir, 
Why not take a retrospective look 
at young people's music since 1950: 
rock, twist, pop, folk-songs, etc. 
Alain Charmillot 
Besan¢on, France 
Sir, 
By all means devote an issue to pop 
music as well as to modern music in 
general. As a music teacher in a 
secondary school, | had been intend- 
ing to prepare a course on the origin 
of pop music and on how electronic 
music is “made”.

PAKISTAN—5,000 YEARS 
OF CIVILIZATION 
 
Sir, 
In your December 1973 issue the 
history of civilization in Pakistan has 
been captivatingly presented in 40 
pages of informative articles and 
photographs on ancient sites, antiquities 
and historic monuments. 
{| am sure this commendable effort 
will go a long way in giving the world 
a distinct glimpse into the cultural 
heritage of Pakistan and the treasures 
of art and culture in this ancient land 
of the Indus.

In your |ssue dedicated to Pakistan, 
| must congratulate your for highlighting 
the salient features of Pakistan's 
ancient art and culture in a most 
appealing manner.

THE ICELAND SAGA 
Sir, 
Congratulations on giving your 
readers those excellent articles on the 
life and culture of the Icelanders 
(February 1974). As Jonas Kristjansson 
rightly says, in the sagas “are to be 
found answers to all the problems of 
human life". 
To the sagas and Eddas of Iceland 
we are indebted for the preservation 
of the faith that guided the actions of 
all northern Europe until the coming 
of Christianity. | hope readers of the 
“Unesco Courier” will have been 
encouraged by your articles to discover 
for themselves the magic of the sagas. 
They will not regret itl

WHEN CHILDREN 
CAN TEACH ADULTS 
 
Sir, 
I would like to endorse what Rosa 
Maria Pérez Mirabent had to say in 
the letters column of your January 1974 
issue. | really enjoy your publication 
but 1 hate to feel that people younger 
than myself (I am in college} are being 
deprived of a good resource because 
they cannot understand the material. 
Many children and young people are 
very concerned about their world and 
| think publications like yours should 
encourage this. | suggest that you 
regularly publish a supplement that can 
be used in the classroom. As a beginn- 
ing, | would like to see a supplement 
dealing with World Population Year, 
the problems, the solutions, and espe- 
cially some ideas for younger folks on 
how they can help to solve the problem. 
You would be suprised to see how 
often children can educate adults.

African science 
and technology 
By 1980 African states should each have 
between 1,000 and 2,000 scientists per 
million inhabitants and should be spending 
at least one per cent of their gross national 
product on research and development. 
These targets were set by 38 countries at 
the recent CASTAFRICA Conference in 
Dakar (Senegal) on African science and 
technology. Commenting on Africa's 
progress in this field, Unesco's Director 
General, René Maheu, told the conference 
that 24 out of Unesco’s 38 African member 
states today have ministries of science 
or other bodies to direct national science 
policies. 
Universal Postal Union 
centenary 
1974 marks the 100th anniversary of the 
Universal Postal Union. In this connexion, 
Unesco's Director-General, René Maheu, 
has suggested ways for Unesco member 
states to promote the international flow of 
information through postal communications. 
These cover cheaper postal services (by 
suppressing or reducing taxes, extending 
rates for printed matter, etc.) for books, 
newspapers, and a wide range of edu- 
cational, scientific and cultural materials. 
The Icelanders and the Sea 
The Editors wish to draw readers’ atten- 
tion to the following observations with 
regard to the article “The Icelanders and 
the Sea” by Dr. Unnstein Stefansson of 
the Marine Research Institute in Reykjavik, 
which appeared in the February 1974 issue 
of the “Unesco Courier”. 
1. The last paragraph of Dr. Stefansson's 
article referred to the decision taken on 
September 1, 1972 by the Icelandic Gov- 
ernment and the Althing (Parhament) to 
extend the Icelandic fisheries jurisdiction 
to 50 miles. The final sentence of the 
article originally read: “Behind this decision 
the entire nation stands united.” In the 
published text on page 30, this sentence 
was inadvertently omitted, when, for 
complementary clarification purposes the 
following sentence was added by the 
editors: “This decision has not been 
accepted by all nations and has been the 
cause of some tensions and disputes with 
certain European fishing nations.” 
2. The sentence on page 30 “No single 
nation relies as heavily on the sea for 
its economic prosperity as do the Iceland- 
ers” originally read “No independent 
nation relies as heavily on the sea, etc.” 
The author had in mind certain nations that 
have not gained full independence. 
The Editors regret these discrepancies. 
Architecture, sports 
and popular culture 
Unesco's new international quarterly, 
Cultures, devotes its second issue, just 
published, to a series of themes: “Aspects 
of Popular Culture”, “Architecture” and 
“Sports and Culture”. Cultures, (annual 
subscription 75 Fr F; single copy 22 Fr F) 
can be ordered from Unesco national 
distributors (see next page).

The following information is taken from 
the latest edition of Unesco's Statistical 
Yearbook, just published: 
B Leading book producers in 1971 were 
U.S.S.R. (85,487 titles), U.S.A. (80,569) and 
the Fed. Rep. of Germany (40,354). 
B Daily newspapers increased from 7,860 
in 1969 to 8,050 in 1970, but at the latest 
count 44 countries and territories still had

ECUADORIAN TWO-HEADED PITCHER 
The double-spouted pitcher was a popular form of ancient Ecuadorian craft. The one shown here is a highly 
original example of Andean pottery of the 5th century A.D. The heads of different sizes forming its spouts 
probably represent those of an Indian mother and the child she carries on her back. Discovered in Ecuador's 
southern province of Cafiar, it was modelled by a craftsman of the Tacalshapa culture which flourished on 
the Andes at that period. (See article on the Pre-Columbian cultures of Ecuador, page 24.)
