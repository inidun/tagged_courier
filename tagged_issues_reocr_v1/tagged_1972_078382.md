HOW TO SAVE 
YOUR HEART 
On the occasion of World Health 
Day, April 7, 1972, the “Unesco 
Courier” devotes this issue to 
cardiovascular diseases—a major 
health problem of the modern world. 
The issue was prepared in 
collaboration with the World Health 
Organization and the editors of 
“World Health". In our cover 
illustration, the artist has depicted 
the process of agglutination in the 
blood. Research into the biology of 
the blood contributes to an 
understanding of cardiovascular 
diseases.

### 52067: The Heart, yours for life

  
  
APRIL 7 
WORLD HEALTH DAY 
kd Your heart is your health” 
—that is the theme for World Health Day, 1972. 
~~ Public health measures against infectious diseases 
are obvious to everybody. Urgent action is now 
needed against diseases of the heart and blood 
vessels, which are the main cause of death in so 
many countries throughout the world. High blood 
pressure, vascular lesions of the central nervous 
~ system and congenital malformations, for example, 
are common everywhere. Ischaemic heart disease 
(See Mini-dictionary, starting page 10) is associated 
with affluence, while rheumatic heart disease and 
heart diseases of infectious origin are more common 
among less privileged groups. Some causes of heart   Aa Ly — “lt AE a yee 0 PRR ®t IE oh 
  
diseases, such as Chagas’ disease, are concentrated 
in certain parts of the world. 
Although the increasing burden of cardiovascular 
disease of atherosclerotic origin is to some extent 
associated with the rising age of the population, 
ischaemic heart disease is becoming more and more 
frequent in younger subjects. 
  
    
    
    
    
Enormous progress has been made in science and 
technology and important social and economic 
achievements have been accomplished. Yet health 
indicators warn us that all is not well with our 
civilization and that its harmonious continuation 
depends, to an extent which might surprise some, on 
the solution of major health problems such as the 
cardiovascular diseases. The prevention of those 
diseases will require some far-reaching changes in 
our way of life and in order to make them possible 
we must be sure that we call upon all the scientific 
and technical means at our disposal.

Much more than we realize, the health of our 
hearts is in our own hands. The time has come for 
community action to control high blood pressure, to 
prevent rheumatic heart disease, to give proper care 
to persons with myocardial infarction or cerebral 
stroke, to treat respiratory diseases that often lead 
to chronic heart failure, and to diagnose and treat 
malformations of the circulatory system in children 
as early as possible. 
We need better nutrition and healthier living habits. 
Much more concentrated research is necessary to 
clarify the unknowns of atherosclerosis and ischaemic 
heart disease. Since some predisposing factors are 
already present in young people, prevention needs 
to be concentrated on the young adult, and even on 
the child and adolescent by promoting their optimum 
development, 
We need better care for all stricken by heart 
disease. In many places there are excellent hospitals 
with modern equipment and trained personnel; but 
everywhere there is difficulty in rapidly providing the 
right care to all those who need it. 
This calls for increasing international effort, govern- 
ment support, active participation of health workers 
and of the public. If all these forces will universally 
unite, we may soon be able to live a better, a healthier 
and a longer active life. 
| hope that World Health Day 1972—the Day of the 
Heart—will give impetus to world-wide co-operation 
in the conquest of cardiovascular diseases. 
Remember: “Your heart is your health.”

### 52067: The Heart, yours for life

THE HEART — 
YOURS FOR LIFE 
by Zdenek Fejfar 
 
The popular conception of 
crippling rheumatic heart disease is 
very common among children and 
young people in hospital wards. 
Various other heart diseases occurring 
in tropical and sub-tropical areas, such 
as endomyocardial fibrosis (a fibrous 
thickening that constricts the cavities 
of the heart), or Chagas’ heart disease, 
  
cardiovascular diseases as a necessary 
evil of middle and old age is false on 
two counts. Children do have heart 
ailments, and, while cardiovascular 
disease is an evil, it is not a 
“necessary” one. 
As with many other problems in 
today's world, a number of cardio- 
vascular diseases begin at a young 
age. This goes without saying for 
congenital malformations of the 
circulatory system. Acute heart 
disease associated with common child 
infections like diphtheria still appears 
from time to time, particularly in 
connexion with epidemic outbreaks. 
Rheumatic heart disease has roots 
in streptococcal sore throats of 
children. In some tropical and sub- 
tropical areas, particularly with crowd- 
ing and inadequate hygienic conditions, 
begin in childhood and sometimes 
lead to irreversible cardiac failure 
even before adulthood is reached. 
Functional disorders of the heart, 
such as cardiac neurosis, are often 
recognized in children or adolescents 
and are frequently induced by a 
chance discovery of an innocent 
murmur. If this is incorrectly explained 
as a heart disease the stigma may 
persist throughout life. Neurosis 
usually reflects the hypersensitivity of 
the child as well as the neurotic 
atmosphere in the family.

### 52067: The Heart, yours for life

THE HEART, YOURS FOR LIFE (Continued) 
More and more evidence indicates 
that “middle age” heart ailments also 
have their roots in childhood. For 
example, this is true of hypertension 
which accompanies some kidney 
diseases. 
Ischaemic or coronary heart disease, 
the scourge of today's technologically 
advanced society, may be due to 
unhealthy habits which begin in child- 
hood. Several reasons support this 
belief, The most severe manifes- 
tations of ischaemic heart disease— 
acute myocardial infarction causing 
damage to the heart muscle, or sudden 
unexpected death—are now occurring 
in younger people with greater 
frequency. Coronary atherosclerosis, 
impeding the flow of blood through 
the arteries which is the commonest 
lesion leading to coronary heart 
disease, begins in childhood. Blood 
cholesterol levels in children from 
countries with frequent ischaemic 
heart disease are higher than in places 
where heart disease in adults is rare. 
The habits which are involved in the 
development of atherosclerosis and 
ischaemic or coronary heart disease 
are acquired in childhood and adoles- 
cence. They include overeating, par- 
ticularly rich foods with saturated fat 
and purified carbohydrates, lack of 
adequate physical activity and smoking. 
The social environment of a child or 
adolescent may also contribute to the 
development of adult heart disease in 
a modern society often demanding a 
pace of daily life which exacts a heavy 
toll. For example, the insecurity of 
a child who suffers from lack of 
tenderness or inadequate care from his 
parents may carry over uncertainties 
of life to school and later on to work 
and lead to maladjustment throughout 
life and eventually to disease. 
Some of these factors are difficult 
to control, others can be handled with 
relative ease, although changing life 
habits usually requires far more 
effort than treating symptoms of the 
disease with a drug. Some preventive 
measures were accepted a long time 
ago by the medical profession and the 
community. These include early 
recognition and treatment of congenital 
malformations, of streptococcal and 
other infections, or prevention of 
cardiac rheumatism, 
Health examinations in schools and 
education of both children and their 
parents help a great deal to raise the 
awareness in the community. However 
much more effort is needed to reduce 
the chances of severe atherosclerosis 
and ischaemic heart disease in adults. 
It means increasing the emphasis on 
investigating causes of the diseases, 
on the recognition of known pre- 
disposing factors, and on introduction 
of appropriate actions in children and 
adolescents to assure optimal condi- 
tions for their healthy development. 
It also means adoption of healthier 
habits as early in life as possible in 
order to set a pattern for the future. 
The important réle of the family first 
and school later should be more 
widely recognized and appreciated, be 
it for adoption of adequate dietary 
habits, or in sensitive understanding 
and advice on how to overcome the 
many smaller or bigger problems of 
daily life of the young. 
Regular physical education, with 
emphasis on sports, must be encour- 
aged to counterbalance hours of 
sitting at school and in front of the 
television screen. Furthermore, the 
young sportsman is not only less 
inclined to smoke, but he is also less 
apt to develop into a sedentary animal 
attached to the seat of his motor 
vehicle. He carries with him into 
adult life a higher physical fitness 
which may easily be regained even 
after years of low physical activity, 
and which should help him to keep fit 
longer than the untrained “soft” type. 
The disturbed youth of today—less 
inclined to compromises than their 
parents—apparently suffer from the 
“achievements” of our civilization. In 
this sense the burden of cardio- 
vascular disease cannot be lifted until 
the ecological balance of society is 
restored and a more sensible adap- 
tation of man to his environment is 
achieved. The habits of childhood 
often linger for a lifetime. |

by Jean Lenégre 
  
JEAN LENEGRE, who died in February at the 
age of 68, was professor of clinical car- 
drology at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. 
A world authority on heart diseases, he was 
formerly president of the French Cardio- 
logical Society and president of the Euro- 
pean Cardiological Society (1960 to 1964). 
Prof. Lenégre was the author of many studies 
on cardiovascular diseases and a member of 
several medical associations in other coun- 
tries, including the Royal College of Physi- 
cians, London. 
  
Ischaemic disease (from 
the Greek iskhaimos—literally “that 
which stops the blood”) occurs when 
the supply of blood to any part of 
the body is considerably reduced or 
cut off. 
The most common of all the ischae- 
mic diseases is ischaemic disease of 
the heart. The term covers those 
diseases or disorders which result 
from a major reduction in the blood 
supply to all or part of the heart. 
This may be brought on by various 
diseases and by various mechanisms. 
For example, a narrowing of the aor- 
tic orifice may interfere with the flow 
of blood to the coronary arteries which 
supply the heart walls and muscles. 
In almost 90 per cent of cases, 
ischaemic heart disease is due to ath- 
erosclerosis, a general disease of the 
-walls of the large arteries which shows 
a marked tendency to attack the 
arteries forming the coronary tree. 
The direct causes of atherosclerosis 
remain a mystery but an increasing 
number of facts about the disease are 
known. 
Coronary atherosclerosis is far more 
common in men than in women, but 
while almost all patients under the 
age of 40 are men, this ceases to be 
true as people grow older; from 60 on, 
and more particularly after 70, it strikes 
equally at both sexes. Thus women 
are in general affected later in life than 
men. 
It occurs more frequently with age. 
Coronary atherosclerosis before the 
age of 20 is most unusual and is fairly

ONE PERSON OUT OF FOUR (Continued) 
uncommon up to the age of 40. Be- 
tween 45 and 50, there is a substantial 
increase, most cases occurring be- 
tween 50 and 80. 
It runs in certain families whose 
members, particularly the males, may 
for generation after generation be the 
unfortunate victims of the disease. 
In industrialized countries such as 
the U.S.A. or Great Britain, coronary 
atherosclerosis is by far the most fre- 
quent cause of death. It is responsible 
for 50 to 60 per cent of all deaths from 
cardiovascular disease, which itself 
accounts for more than half the total 
number of deaths. Coronary athero- 
sclerosis kills three out of every thou- 
sand inhabitants of these two coun- 
tries every year, not to speak of the 
one million work-days lost annually in 
the United States alone. 
The figures for Canada, Australia, 
the Federal Republic of Germany and 
the Scandinavian countries are propor- 
tionally almost as high. In these coun- 
tries it is the No. 1 health problem—a 
plague of modern society. 
The same applies to France, poss- 
ibly to a lesser degree. However, in 
spite of the frequency of cardiovascu- 
lar diseases, the efforts made at pre- 
vention remain far below what is re- 
quired. If the same effort were made 
in France to prevent cardiovascular 
diseases as is made for tuberculosis 
or cancer, mortality would indisput- 
ably decline. 
Over the past twenty years, doctors 
have been making a tremendous effort 
to find out what causes hardening and 
narrowing of the arteries (atheroscle- 
rosis), and how heart disease dev- 
elops from atherosclerosis. Although 
they still have not found the 
whole “scientific truth” about the 
direct causes of the disease, they are 
getting nearer to it and have brought 
to light a certain number of “clues” to 
the mystery. 
Mm Since some families show a mark- 
ed predisposition to coronary athero- 
sclerosis, hereditary or genetic factors 
have been suspected, Heredity most 
probably influences the disease in a 
variety of ways. Disorders of the meta- 
bolism and enzyme disorders such 
as an excess of cholesterol in the 
blood or diabetes mellitus and some 
endocrine defects, may all play their 
part. However, it is unlikely that the 
heredity factor is a simple mechanism 
of gene mutation. 
MW Statistics show us that high blood 
pressure is a predisposing factor: at 
least 25 per cent of men and 50 per 
cent of women with coronary heart 
disease suffer from high blood pres- 
sure. Even a mild degree of hyper- 
tension in an adult may have serious 
consequences. 
M In the same way diabetes can be 
said to predispose to atherosclerosis. 
Typical diabetes mellitus is actually 
present in over 10 per cent of patients 
suffering from coronary heart disease. 
Certain diabetic conditions, where one 
of the parents, usually the mother, has 
a history of diabetes and/or the results 
given by blood sugar tests are clearly 
abnormal, are even more frequent. 
Hidden defects in sugar metabolism 
are often found in association with 
abnormalities of fat metabolism. Thus, 
some patients should follow a “dia- 
betic” diet and cut out simple sugars 
and fruit so as to lower abnormally 
high blood levels of cholesterol, tri- 
glycerides or lipids. 
MW A theory that high cholesterol levels 
may be responsible for coronary athe- 
rosclerosis has been gaining ground 
over the last fifty years. More and 
more frequent reports have appeared 
of its coexistence with other diseases 
of a completely different nature such as 
diabetes. All these diseases, however, 
have a common denominator—a per- 
manently raised blood cholesterol 
level. Even when no other disease is 
present, patients suffering from coron- 
ary atherosclerosis are found to have 
a higher blood cholesterol level than 
normal healthy individuals of the same 
age. 
The incidence of coronary heart dis- 
ease varies widely from country to 
country but studies show that such fac- 
tors as race, climate and geographical 
situation are less closely related to its 
distribution than diet and the level of 
economic development. 
WM Obesity, or excess fat, is almost 
invariably due to overeating, although 
in some cases another factor may 
operate—such as an inherited family 
tendency to put on weight more easily 
when calorie intake is high. In certain 
individuals every calorie in excess of 
the number required to satisfy the 
body's metabolic requirements is 
stored in the form of fat and leads 
slowly but surely to increasing obesity. 
The significance of obesity in coron- 
ary heart disease has been variously 
assessed. It may not be the main fac- 
tor but there is no doubt that it plays 
some part. This is borne out both by 
the statistical tables compiled by life 
insurance companies, which show how 
life expectancy falls as body weight 
increases, and by clinical studies, 
some of which have shown that deaths 
from cardiovascular disease are twice 
as frequent among those who are 
overweight as among comparable in- 
dividuals whose weight is normal (60 
per cent as against 30 to 35 per cent). 
W Other factors have been suspected 
of causing coronary atherosclerosis, 
among them cigarette smoking, espe-

The heart, a machine more efficient than any made by man, contracts an average of 70 times 
a minute, 100,000 times a day, 36 million times a year. No bigger than a fist, it can send 
from five to 30 litres of blood a minute into the arteries, depending upon how much energy 
you are using. Diagrams on these pages show how this remarkable pumping system works. 
Blood flowing through the veins is shown in dark grey and blood flowing through the arteries in 
light grey. 1: Used blood from the veins and re-oxygenated blood from the lungs enter the 
right and left atrium respectively. 2: The used and re-oxygenated blood is 
then pumped into the right and left ventricles. 3: The ventricles are now filled with blood. 
4: Used blood from the right ventricle is pumped into the lungs for re-oxygenation while 
fresh blood from the left ventricle sets off on its journey to feed the body's oxygen-hungry q 
cells. 5. The amazing, closed-circuit, circulation system that keeps the body going. 
Oxygen and nutrients are transferred from the blood to body tissue by thousands of tiny 
capillaries that snake out to every corner of the body.

MINI-DICTIONARY 
ON CARDIOVASCULAR 
DISEASES 
Aneurysm 
Widening of a portion of an artery. 
Aneurysm of the aorta occurs in upper or 
lower part of the aorta, due to athero- 
sclerosis or to syphilis. Dissecting aneu- 
rysm of the aorta: an aneurysm in which 
blood penetrates through a tear of the 
inner layer into the aortic wall, disrupting 
its tissues; fatal unless immediately treated. 
Angina pectoris 
Pain occurring centrally in the front of 
the chest, brought on by effort (e.g. exer- 
cise, emotion, ingestion of food, exposure 
to cold). It is felt as a tight, heavy, 
constricting or crushing pain, but may also 
be numbing or burning, and may radiate 
to the left arm or both arms, round the 
chest, or into the neck or jaw. A few 
minutes of rest or a tablet of nitro- 
glycerine give quick relief. It is a symptom 
of ischaemic heart disease (coronary heart 
disease). 
Arrhythmia 
Any irregularity of heart rhythm, Some 
arrhythmias are entirely harmless, others 
may indicate that heart disease is present. 
Arrhythmias occurring in acute ischaemic 
heart disease call for emergency treatment. 
Arteriosclerosis 
Thickening, hardening and loss of elas- 
ticity of arterial walls, usually due to 
atherosclerotic changes. The arteries may 
become narrower and impair blood flow. 
Atherosclerosis 
Lesions on the inside of the arteries 
with fibrous and fat deposits that lead to 
thickening, hardening, narrowing or even 
obliteration of the arteries and thus impede 
the flow through the arteries. 
Bradycardia 
Unusually slow action of the heart. 
Cardiac arrest 
Cessation of the heart's contractions. 
It may take the form of a complete stand- 
still of the heart muscle, or of rapid, chao- 
tic individual twitching of the heart muscle 
cells (fibrillation of the ventricles). The 
patient must be resuscitated immediately. 
Cardiac neurosis 
Disturbed functioning of the heart, 
though the heart itself is not organically 
diseased. 
Cardiomyopathies 
Diseases of the heart muscle of various, 
often obscure, origin. The dominant 
10 
feature is the great enlargement of the 
heart with diminished function (cardio- 
megaly). Chagas’ heart disease is a car- 
diomyopathy in which the cause is known. 
Cerebrovascular diseases 
Any brain disease caused by impaired 
blood flow. The main forms are cerebral 
haemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis and cere- 
bral embolism, 
Cerebral embolism 
Occlusion of a brain artery by some 
circulating particle, usually a small blood 
clot detached by blood flow from the heart; 
it results in stroke. 
Cerebral haemorrhage 
Bleeding in the brain because of a rup-. 
tured artery. Hypertension is its common- 
est cause; many cases could be prevented 
by adequate treatment of hypertension. 
Cerebral thrombosis 
Clotting within a brain artery. It deprives 
part of the brain of blood and oxygen 
causing damage to the brain cells. Cere- 
bral thrombosis is the most common con- 
dition underlying stroke. 
Chagas’ disease 
A disease endemic in parts of rural 
Mexico and Central and South America, 
caused by a parasite that is insect borne. 
The insect bites its victim and defaecates. 
When the victim scratches himself, the 
parasite enters the blood stream. The 
disease may lead to serious heart damage. 
No cure has been developed. Prevention 
entails improved living conditions and sani- 
tation, as well as insect control, 
Coarctation of the aorta 
Narrowing of the upper portion of aorta, 
a relatively frequent congenital heart 
disease that can be cured surgically. 
Coronary arteries 
Arteries that supply blood to the tissues 
of the heart. 
Coronary heart disease 
(See Ischaemic heart disease.) 
Embolism 
Occlusion (blockage) of a blood vessel 
by a detached clot or by some other 
particle, including bubbles of air or other 
gas and particles of fat.

  It is unquestionable that there is a relationship between 
cigarette smoking and mortality from heart disease. Recent studies 
have sought to determine whether certain predisposing factors 
exist (such as stress) which make the same people liable both 
to become cigarette smokers and to be prone to heart disease. 
It has been found that cardiovascular mortality is higher 
in areas where the drinking water is soft, and specialists are 
trying to determine whether some “protective” substance 
present in hard water (photo left) is absent in soft water. 
Obesity {photo below right) as well as the stresses of modern 
society and sedentary life (photo below) have both been implicated 
as causes of heart disease although some doubt has been placed 
on these as true risk factors by some medical authorities.

MINI-DICTIONARY (Continued) 
Endocarditis 
Disease of the internal layer of the 
heart, especially the heart valves, caused 
by rheumatic fever, bacteria or other 
agents, leading to leakage and narrowing 
of the valves (insufficiency and stenosis). 
Both conditions may be combined and 
either or both the mitral and aortic valves 
may be affected. 
Endomyocardial fibrosis 
A tropical cardiomyopathy characterized 
by massive fibrosis (scarring) of the inner 
wall of the ventricles leading to the defor- 
mation of the cavities and impaired pump- 
ing of the heart. 
Essential hypertension 
Hypertension of unknown origin, the 
most common form of consistently elevated 
blood pressure. In some patients the 
disease is progressive, leading to com- 
plications such as heart, kidney or brain 
damage, but which may be prevented by 
adequate treatment. 
Extrasystoles 
Premature contractions of the heart that 
occur independently from the basic rhythm 
of the heart: a variety of arrhythmia, 
usually harmless and insignificant. 
Haemorrhage 
Bleeding from any blood vessel. 
Heart block 
General term for conditions in which the 
bioelectric current that activates the heart 
muscle cells is delayed (or interrupted) 
somewhere along its path. More specific 
terms (e.g. atrio-ventricular, bundle branch 
block) refer to the site of impairment. 
Some types of block are innocuous, others 
may point to serious disease. 
Hypertension 
High blood pressure, abnormal elevation 
of arterial blood pressure as a result of 
narrowing of the small arteries: this 
increases resistance to the flow of blood 
and thus may overwork the heart. 
Ischaemic heart disease 
Cardiac disability from insufficient supply 
of blood to the heart muscles; in most 
cases caused by advanced atherosclerosis 
in the coronary arteries.

cially when the smoke is inhaled. 
Almost all the statistics agree that 
mortality from various diseases is 
much greater among smokers than 
among non-smokers. This is true 
for lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, 
ischaemic diseases of the lower limbs 
and, although perhaps to a lesser 
degree, coronary thrombosis. 
BM Sedentary habits, the stress and 
strain of modern life, and some psycho- 
logical and emotional factors may also 
play a part, though this is not yet 
fully proved and requires further study. 
The very fact that coronary heart 
disease strikes more frequently in 
nations that are economically rich and 
whose populations are predominantly 
sedentary and well-fed has led to 
atherosclerosis in general, and 
coronary atherosclerosis in particular, 
being considered as a disease of the 
privileged—the price we pay for 
belonging to what has rightly been 
called the “consumer society”. 
What, then, lies behind this sharp 
increase in coronary heart disease? 
It has sometimes been alleged that the 
increase is more apparent than real 
since, with the improved diagnostic 
methods at our disposal, it is possible 
to diagnose forms of the disease 
today which formerly would not have 
been recognized. 
It has also been said that the 
increased incidence of the disease in 
the second half of life is due above 
all to the fact that we now live longer. 
The proportion of men who die from 
cardiovascular diseases in relation to 
other causes of death varies from 
country to country as follows: 21 to 
37 per cent die at age 40; 33 to 51 per 
cent die at age 50; 39 to 57 per cent 
die at age 60; 48 to 62 per cent die at 
age 70. 
There is thus some truth in these 
allegations. But Ostler, who a century 
ago in one year met only rare cases 
of angina pectoris among his many 
patients, was as capable of diagnosing 
it as we are today. Moreover, it is 
difficult to explain away the increasing 
number of cases among people 
under 40. 
While we have only a sketchy 
knowledge of the direct causes of 
atherosclerosis we do know quite a 
lot about the structure of the lesions 
associated with it. They consist of 
diffuse and segmentary changes in the 
arteries, remarkable in that they show 
a predilection for the male sex and 
the middle-aged. 
The first anatomic changes occur 
early in life, from 10 or 20 onwards. 
The yellowish fatty streaks which 
appear in the internal lining of the 
artery are small at first and remain 
inactive for many years—almost in- 
definitely in most cases. With the 
passing of time, slowly and im- 
perceptibly, the lesions develop, 
showing a preference for certain 
regions and particularly for the arteries 
forming the coronary tree. 
Within these regions, they most 
frequently attack the point at which 
the main body of an artery divides 
or curves. In these areas, the in- 
soluble lipid substances circulating 
in the blood (cholesterol and fatty 
acids) are precipitated on to the 
internal wall of the artery and form 
yellowish deposits which in turn are 
soon covered by a gradually thicken- 
ing fibrous shell. 
Thus an atherosclerotic plaque is 
formed which infiltrates deeply into the 
arterial wall, eroding or compressing 
the middle muscular coat of the artery 
and, what is more serious, bulges out 
into the blood channel, which becomes 
progressively narrower as the athero- 
sclerotic plaque grows larger. 
This narrowing of the 
arteries progresses very slowly. The 
failing blood supply to a certain extent 
is compensated for by blood supplied 
from other coronary arteries. 
The narrowing usually begins to 
interfere with the functioning and 
nutrition of the heart muscle in 
persons aged between 50 and 70. 
The normally slow course of the 
disease—progression as the arteries 
narrow, alternating with regression 
as the supplementary circulation 
comes to the aid of the failing heart— 
may be accelerated by the formation 
of a coronary thrombosis. 
A clot of blood suddenly forms 
around or near an atherosclerotic 
plague, completely blocking the artery, 
and the supplementary circulation is 
unable to meet the extra demand for 
blood. That part of the heart muscle 
which depends on the blocked coron- 
ary artery becomes acutely anaemic 
and this condition usually brings on 
a heart attack, 
This can be defined as complete 
ischaemia of a particular area of the 
heart wall—usually part of the wall 
of the left ventricle. The stricken 
area ceases to contract, fails to assist 
the ventricular pump in its work, de- 
generates and, over a period of 
several months, is transformed into 
a fibroid scar, incapable of taking 
any further part in the working of the 
heart. 
When the narrowing of the coronary 
arteries or in some cases their pro- 
gressive blockage reaches a stage 
where the circulation is no longer able 
to compensate fully, any occasion

The electrocardiograph detects and records the electrical 
impulses that develop in the heart and spread through its 
muscles with each heart-beat. To make a recording, the 
impulses are gathered at points on the skin corresponding 
to precisely determined areas of the heart, Wires are 
usually attached to the wrists, ankles and various parts of 
the chest. Diagram above shows one normal sequence

This usually happens when one 
makes a big physical effort, especially 
walking. After one has walked a short 
distance of a hundred yards or less, 
especially in cold weather or at a 
brisk pace up a hill, or after a heavy 
meal, the coronary insufficiency shows 
up as a short-lived pain in the chest. 
This pain, known as angina pectoris, 
comes on suddenly, varies in intensity, 
and is usually felt in the centre of 
the chest. There is a tight feeling in 
the chest but no loss of breath. 
Nevertheless, it is unpleasant enough 
to bring one to a halt or make one 
slow down sharply. The pain goes 
as quickly as it came—usually In less 
than two minutes. 
Its passing is often accompanied 
by stomach gurglings or by belching,

which gives the mistaken impression 
that one is suffering from indigestion, 
especially if one has just had a meal. 
The pain often occurs while one is 
walking but it may also appear for no 
apparent reason while resting. 
Some persons may suffer several 
attacks in one day, others only two 
or three in a month. In between these 
painful attacks (always very brief and 
never lasting more than five to ten 
minutes) there is no feeling of illness 
or discomfort and one usually says 
“everything is fine”. 
Between attacks, medical examin- 
ations often show no signs of ab- 
normality, the heart appearing normal 
under the stethoscope and X-ray. The 
electrocardiogram is the best method 
of diagnosis. In a third of cases it 
reveals abnormalities; in a further 
third, the electrocardiogram is not 
absolutely normal but the irregularities 
are slight and non-typical; in the 
remaining third, the electrocardiogram 
taken at rest is quite normal. When 
the electrocardiogram is normal, 
negative or difficult to interpret, it is 
best to give a controlled exercise 
tolerance test, after which any 
irregularity present should show. 
When the arteries become so 
narrow that the flow of blood 
approaches the minimum required by 
the heart muscle, then the heart, 
which normally needs a lot of oxygen 
to function and is not getting it, 
reaches a critical stage, 
Pains in the chest become more 
or less continuous, coming on after

and sometimes even in definite 
changes in the electrocardiogram.

MINI-DICTIONARY (Continued) 
Myocardial infarct or infarction 
A manifestation of acute ischaemic heart 
disease: the occlusion of an artery of the 
heart cuts off the blood supply to a portion 
of the heart muscle. The affected tissue 
dies off injuring the heart. Symptoms are 
prolonged intensive chest pain, fall of 
blood pressure, and often shock. Many 
surviving patients can be rehabilitated to 
lead a fruitful life. 
Neurocirculatory asthenia 
Disturbance of the functioning of the 
heart and circulatory system, although no 
organic damage can be detected in the 
heart and vessels themselves. Patients 
experience a variety of symptoms and their 
physical performance may be decreased; 
there is no lasting impairment. 
Pericarditis 
A disease of the heart surface; rheu- 
matic fever, tuberculosis, a great variety 
of infections and many other agents are 
its possible causes. 
Renal hypertension 
Elevated blood pressure due to kidney 
disease; some forms (if only one kidney 
is affected) are amenable to surgical treat- 
ment. 
Rheumatic fever 
A sequel to infection by Group A strep- 
tococci characterized by heart disease 
and/or acute pain and inflammation of the 
joints. The disease usually begins in 
childhood with an acute attack and may 
have a long-lasting course, since the 
patient is liable to recurrences brought on 
by new streptococcal infections: these 
aggravate the heart disease, but may be 
prevented by penicillin. 
Rheumatic heart disease 
Damage to the heart valves and heart 
muscle resulting from rheumatic fever. 
Because of endocarditis the valves may 
become crippled (see Endocarditis). The 
disease may occur without a history of 
acute rheumatic fever, 
Stroke 
A colloquial term for any cerebrovascular 
disease having an abrupt onset. The lead- 
ing symptom is paralysis of one side of the 
body. 
Tachycardia 
Accelerated action of the heart. Paroxys- 
mal tachycardia is a particular form of 
rapid heart action, occurring in seizures 
which may last from a few seconds to 
several days. There are several varieties 
of paroxysmal tachycardia, some of them 
harmless, others rather dangerous.

site of occlusion. fq

a heart attack (Myocardial infarction). 
In these circumstances, any one of 
“many “incidents” may cause the blood 
supply, and therefore the oxygenation 
and nutrition of the heart muscle, to fall 
below the minimum vital level and 
bring on a heart attack. The immediate 
cause may be unaccustomed physical 
effort (though this is rare) or a violent 
emotion such as anger. 
A meal that is too heavy or too 
rich in fatty foods may affect the 
blood supply in various ways. It may 
precipitate an attack by upsetting the 
water-salt balance in the blood, by 
increasing the work load on the heart, 
or by modifying the blood chemistry 
and causing a sudden rise in the level 
of triglycerides and fatty acids, 
Heavy cigarette smoking and inhal- 
+ ing and various “incidents” such as an 
attack of another unconnected illness 
—flu for instance, accidental injury 
or a surgical operation—may also 
trigger an attack. 
In most cases however a major 
heart attack occurs suddenly and 
without warning. It may surprise the 
victim at work, while resting or, 
without any apparent reason, in bed 
at night. These cases of unexpected 
myocardial infarction, particularly 
when there are no warning signs such 
as recurrence of chest pain, are 
usually due to coronary artery 
thrombosis. 
Whether preceded by a 
recrudescence of chest pain (in 40 per 
cent of cases) or apparently linked 
with an “incident” such as the ones 
described above (less than 10 per cent 
of cases) or striking suddenly and 
without warning, the heart attack is 
characterized by a violent bout of 
pain which spreads to the whole of 
the thorax, often radiates along the 
arms, and lasts not minutes but hours. 
The immediate risk to a person 
suffering such a major attack is even 
greater than was once thought. Recent 
studies show that the victim often 
dies within an hour or two of its onset. 
If he survives this first critical period, 
myocardial infarction usually develops 
within the next few days—a con- 
sequence of the partial destruction of 
a segment of the wall of the left 
ventricle. 
Once the pain has subsided, the 
arterial blood pressure falls and there 
is usually a temporary rise in tem- 
perature to about 38 or 39 degrees 
Centigrade (100 to 101 degrees 
Fahrenheit). Blood tests carried out 
in the first few days after an attack 
show abnormal amounts of certain 
substances (enzymes), indicating that 
some degeneration of the cardiac 
muscle cells has taken place. Their 
presence and the irregularities of 
successive electrocardiograms confirm 
the diagnosis. 
There is nothing to do but to put 
the person to bed for three weeks 
or so with appropriate treatment and 
wait for the damaged heart tissue to 
heal. 
Although heart disease, and esp- 
ecially coronary heart attacks, are 
obviously “Public Health Enemy No. 1", 
they are not always given the system- 
atic treatment they require. This is 
probably because heart disease is 
often looked on as part of the in- 
exorable “running-out® of a human 
life. 
But nothing could be further from 
the truth. Heart disease, particularly 
ischaemic heart disease, strikes more 
and more frequently in all age groups. 
Its causes are often accidental, or the 
consequence of years of accumulated 
neglect. Yet in many cases it can 
not only be foreseen and prevented, 
but also cured. Proper treatment may 
limit or postpone its effects and keep 
the disease under control for many 
years. 
Much of this treatment becomes 
critically urgent in the case of a major 
heart attack when, as often happens, 
the sick person's life is in immediate 
danger. Every minute counts and it 
is vital that the heart attack should 
be diagnosed correctly from the outset. 
This calls for education not only 
of the public but also of doctors, 
whose medical training may not 
always have prepared them to under- 
take the modern and sometimes 
“revolutionary” treatment called for 
in these cases. 
The classic treatment of a heart 
attack which forbade moving the 
patient during the acute stage and 
insisted on his being treated on the 
spot (often in his own home) is losing 
favour, This was perhaps logical in 
the days when treatment of myocardial 
infarct was largely a matter of “wait 
and see”. 
But today we know that the first 
few hours are by far the most 
dangerous and during this time “un- 
necessary” deaths may occur, not 
because of irreversible damage to the 
heart, but following a sudden dis- 
turbance of the heart's rhythm, such 
as ventricular fibrillation (chaotic 
twitching of the heart muscle cells) 
or cardiac arrest (a complete standstill 
of the heart muscle). 
Such mishaps, against which we 
are helpless for lack of suitable 
equipment when the patient is treated 
at home, are often curable if treated

in centres specializing in the handling 
of heart disease, where “re-animation” 
and “defibrillation” are standard 
procedure, 
In view of the immediate risk, the 
patient should be transferred right 
away to one of these specialized 
“coronary units”. This calls for a 
special ambulance service equipped to 
provide immediate intensive care and 
able to go into action as rapidly as 
a fire engine, and also the setting up 
of special units in most hospitals for 
the treatment of heart attacks. 
These are by no means novel 
suggestions—such centres have been 
in operation in the hospitals of many 
cities for years. Any large modern 
hospital should find it possible to 
meet the cost of such a unit without 
overstraining its budget. 
  
In the majority of cases, 
patients make a complete recovery 
from a first attack of myocardial 
infarction, and they may even be 
allowed to practise certain sports, 
provided that these cause them no 
physical discomfort or other difficulty. 
But even when “cured”, myocardial 
infarction should never be taken 
lightly. 
An infarct, even when healed, or 
indeed any anginal pain, however brief, 
coming on spontaneously or during 
exercise, may signal the presence of 
coronary atherosclerosis and indicate 
that certain precautionary measures 
should be taken. 
The patient should be asked to avoid 
any physical effort which causes him 
discomfort and particularly any move- 
ment which brings on anginal pain. 
If pain does occur, a tablet of nitro- 
glycerine should be crushed in the 
mouth without delay. This drug is 
harmless when taken in the recommen- 
ded dosage and its effect is little short 
of miraculous. It may cause a head- 
ache in 5 to 10 per cent of cases 
(disagreeable but short-lived). 
It is erroneously believed by many 
that nitroglycerine loses its powers if 
taken frequently; on the contrary, it 
continues to be effective indefinitely. 
Of all the drugs known today it is the 
most reliable, the most rapid and the 
most spectacular In its results: in 
90 per cent of cases it relieves the 
pain of angina pectoris in less than 
one minute. No other drug can do 
this. 
Other drugs, generally thought to 
be capable of dilating the coronary 
arteries, diminishing the labouring of 
the heart, or improving the metabolism 
of the myocardium by reducing its oxy- 
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
Hypertension is a rise in the systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure 
above the normal. Systolic refers to the pressure at the artery wall when 
the heart is in contraction and drives blood into the aorta. Diastolic refers to 
k the pressure when the heart is in relaxation. When the heart pumps rhythm- 
pi ically, blood pressure oscillates between the systolic and diastolic values. It 
changes to meet the needs of muscles and other organs. 
pressure is indicated by the first figure and diastolic blood pressure by the 
Systolic blood 
second. 
! A casual blood pressure of 150/90 is considered normal in a middle-aged 
fv adult, but other factors, including the patient's age, must be taken into 
, account. A systolic pressure of 160 is a more serious matter at age 40 than 
at age 60. Although a person’s blood pressure varies considerably during the 
? day and night, it will vary particularly with emotional upset. Therefore, 
comparative measurements should always be taken under the same conditions.

These levels, however, may vary in different countries. 
de 
gen (and therefore blood) require- 
ments, may be used with varying 
success to complete the treatment. 
American surgeons have recently 
perfected an effective surgical method 
of restoring the blood supply to parts 
of the heart muscle that have been 
deprived of it, in cases where angina 
pectoris proves resistant to medical 
treatment. 
To supply blood to the affected 
parts surgeons use a by-pass graft, 
A piece of the saphenous vein is 
taken from the patient's leg and one 
end is grafted on to the aorta, one 
of the major blood vessels, the other 
end being grafted on to the coronary 
artery beyond the point where it is 
blocked. 
This operation, logical, simple to 
perform and involving little risk, has 
proved very effective in controlling 
and alleviating anginal pain in the 
chest, but it does not cure the 
coronary atherosclerosis that has 
caused a blockage of the artery. 
Any treatment for heart disease 
must include advice on principles of 
general health and diet. This advice 
is of great importance, as much to 
persons already suffering from the 
effects of the disease as to those 
who, though apparently in good health, 
have been shown by clinical and 
HW stop 
biological tests to be affected by one 
or more of the “risk factors”. 
Among preventive measures, by far 
the most important are these three: 
smoking (in some cases, 
smoking is one of the major aggrav- 
ating factors and should be stopped 
immediately and for good); 
HW lead a reasonably active life, avoid 
sedentary occupations, and exercise 
enough to keep the muscles in good 
condition; 
HB keep to a diet designed to counter- 
act any metabolic disorder revealed 
by biological tests. 
The old saying “Prevention is better 
than cure” applies to most cases and 
underlines the need to set up special 
centres for the diagnosis and pre- 
vention of atherosclerotic diseases in 
general and coronary heart disease 
in particular. With our present know- 
ledge of “risk factors”, a relatively 
simple examination should enable us 
to determine which persons in the 
community are “at risk”, and to advise 
them what precautions to.take. 
If this advice is followed, one may 
hope that within the next few years 
there will be a dramatic fall in the 
number of victims of heart disease 
and particularly of coronary heart 
failure. un

The human heart, that vital 
busy pump made of muscle interwoven 
with blood-vessels, is an organ about 
which we know much but need to find 
out far more. If it slows down and 
fails to supply any part of the body, 
that part may literally die; the result 
may be paralysis of an arm or a leg, 
or part of the brain may cease to func- 
tion; if the heart itself is deprived of 
blood, death may occur. 
Like any hard-worked machine, the 
heart is subject to mechanical failure 
from a variety of causes, some known, 
others obscure. The distribution of 
these ailments in the world's popula- 
tion is not uniform but varies accord- 
ing to sex, diet, area and economic 
status. A disease may also lead to 
different complications in different 
settings; for example, the main 
consequences of high blood pressure 
are different in developing and highly 
developed countries. 
In most of the affluent societies of 
the world, the level of arterial blood 
pressure rises progressively with 
increasing age, especially after 40. 
Whether this is a normal pattern or 
should be regarded as an environmen- 
tally induced disorder remains a source 
of heated discussion. Studies of the 
aging process in developing countries 
may answer this question. 
A.G. SHAPER was formerly WHO Research 
Professor at the Department of Medicine, 
Makerere University College, Kampala, 
Uganda. At present he is working at the 
Medical Research Council's Social Medicine 
Unit, at the London School of Hygiene and 
Tropical Medicine, England. 
ZDENEK FEIFAR is Head of the World 
Health Organization's Cardiovascular Dis- 
eases Unit, Geneva (see page 5). 
The Medical Research Unit in Wel- 
lington, New Zealand, has investigated 
several groups of Polynesians. The 
population of Pukapuka (Cook Island) 
does not show the usual rise of blood 
pressure with increasing age, but other 
groups of genetically similar Poly- 
nesians, now exposed to the modern 
affluent way of life, do; their blood 
pressure rises with age; arterial hyper- 
tension and complications are not un- 
common. 
Among the Maoris of New Zealand, 
the prevalence of hypertension is high 
and is still rising, while among the 
Europeans in New Zealand it has been 
falling; hypertension in the Maoris is 
frequently associated with a tendency 
towards gout. Tantalizing as these 
clues are, their true signifiance has 
yet to be determined. 
The peoples of northern Kenya, the 
Samburu and the Rendille, lead a 
nomadic existence with their herds of 
cattle, camels, sheep and goats; they 
also show no increase in blood pres- 
sure levels with increasing age. 
Studies carried out by the World 
Health Organization Cardiovascular 
Research and Training Centre in Kam- 
pala, Uganda, have shown that young 
men from these tribes who join the 
Kenya army show a significant increase 
in blood pressure in their second year 
of service. 
One of the many changes associated 
with their transition from a nomadic life 
to the disciplined existence of the army 
is a considerable increase in salt 
intake, although other dietary changes 
and such factors as environmental 
stress may also play a part. 
In the affluent countries it seems 
that people with high blood pressure 
are more likely to develop disease 
of the arteries and coronary heart 
disease. In the tropical countries, 
although long-standing and severe 
hypertension results in brain damage, 
heart enlargement and heart failure, or 
in kidney damage and kidney failure, 
severe atherosclerosis and coronary 
heart disease virtually do not occur. 
A similar situation has been observ- 
ed in China, Japan and Mongolia, as 
well as in many tropical countries, and 
shows that hypertension should be 
regarded as an aggravating factor 
in the development of coronary 
heart disease and not as a basic 
cause. There is clearly a tremendous 
need to study the natural history of

OF HEART DISEASE 
  
hypertension in populations not prone 
to severe atherosclerosis. 
The usual cause of the reduced 
blood supply is atherosclerosis of the 
coronary arteries, a process which 
leads to narrowing and distortion of 
the blood vessels. A sudden obstruc- 
tion in one of these arteries will result 
in damage to the heart muscle which 
it supplies; this is acute myocardial 
infarction, often called by the general 
term “heart attack”. It is the most 
common heart disease in adult man 
in all affluent societies. 
Yet heart attack is rare in develop- 
ing countries, with the apparent excep- 
tion of small groups of people with 
a high level of responsibility and socio- 
economic advantage. 
In the affluent societies, cigarette 
smoking, hypertension, diabetes melli- 
tus, obesity and sedentary occupations 
are factors known to be associated 
with the development of coronary heart 
disease, yet these factors do not pro- 
duce coronary atherosclerosis and 
coronary heart disease in the "average 
man” in the developing countries. 
This is true even for middle-aged 
persons with long-standing hyper- 
tension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and 
sedentary occupations! The reasons 
are as yet not quite clear but there is 
a strong suggestion that all these “risk 
factors” are only aggravating factors 
which accelerate the development of 
atherosclerosis and its complications 
in communities already prone to this 
disease. 
The relative importance of 
dietary factors and of physical activity 
patterns, which are perhaps expressed 
in the low blood-fat levels of these 
tropical communities with virtual free- 
dom from coronary heart disease, is 
of considerable interest. Many claim 
that the basic causes of coronary 
heart disease cannot be adequately 
studied in the communities which 
suffer most from the disease because 
all individuals are exposed. Hence the 
usefulness of studying communities 
relatively free from it. 
Particularly rewarding studies cover 
well-defined groups of people with 
considerable differences in the preval- 
ence of coronary heart disease. For 
example, in Kampala, Uganda, the

GEOGRAPHY OF HEART DISEASE (Continued from page 16) 
WHO Centre has emphasized the strik- 
ing differences which are found in the 
fibrinolytic (clot-dissolving) system of 
subjects prone to coronary heart 
disease compared with subjects who 
are not. The African community in 
Kampala have no coronary heart dis- 
ease, and at all ages have an active 
system for the breakdown of blood 
clots. 
The Indian minority in Kampala, 
with an incidence of coronary heart 
disease similar to any “affluent” group, 
have a very poor clot-dissolving sys- 
tem when they reach middle age (40- 
60 years), and this inability to break 
down blood clots Is significantly 
associated with body fatness, blood 
cholesterol levels and a tendency to 
diabetes. This may be a phenomenon 
of fundamental importance in the 
development of atherosclerosis and 
coronary heart disease, and furnishes 
another example of how the absence 
of a disease in a community may lead 
to the better understanding of the 
mechanisms of the disease elsewhere. 
Food habits may play an important 
part in determining whether a com- 
munity does or does not suffer from 
coronary heart disease, 
In Singapore, where three-quarters 
of the population are Chinese and one 
quarter Malay and Indian, the Indian 
section of the community, whose eating 
habits are quite special, is the one 
most commonly affected. 
In Fiji, coronary heart disease is not 
seen in the native Fijians, but is com- 
monly diagnosed resident 
Indians. 
In Ceylon, where coronary heart 
disease is commonly diagnosed in 
relatively poor people on low-fat diets, 
considerable interest focuses on the 
fact that, although the total amount of 
fat consumed is low, it consists of 
coconut oil, a substance similar in 
certain ways to butter, i.e. highly 
saturated. 
among 
. Clearly the nutritional 
peculanties of tropical countries are of 
considerable concern to those involved 
in unravelling the mysteries of athero- 
sclerosis and coronary heart disease. 
A small proportion of those who 
suffer from certain streptococcal throat 
infections experience inflammation of 
the heart and swelling of the joints 
which may go unrecognized if symp- 
toms are not striking: this is acute 
rheumatic fever. However, though the 
acute phase soon passes, permanent 
injury to the heart in the form of a 
thickening of the heart valves may 
result; this is chronic rheumatic heart 
disease. 
There has been a remarkable decline 
in the incidence of rheumatic fever in 
highly developed communities in recent 
years through the treatment of strep- 
tococcal infections with sulphonamides 
and penicillin. Moreover, preventive 
regimens have considerably prolonged 
PYRAMID CLINIC 
Rheumatic fever which can cause crippling 
damage to the heart is a disease which 
often strikes children. Thirty per cent 
of adult cardiac diseases are due to 
rheumatic fever contracted in childhood. 
In the U.S.A. about one million heart 
sufferers owe their ailment to this cause. 
In Egypt, the Pyramid Clinic, built almost 
in the shadow of the great pyramids near 
Cairo (right) treats and rehabilitates children 
suffering from disabilities of the heart 
and joints caused by rheumatic fever, It 
has already cared for some 10,000 children 
and provides primary school teaching 
and appropriate job training. 
Chagas’ heart disease is a threat to 
35 million persons in Latin America, where 
it causes many deaths. It affects an 
estimated five million persons in Brazil and 
one million in Venezuela. Photo left shows 
inhabitants of a district where the incidence 
of Chagas’ disease is particularly high. 
the life of subjects with chronic rheu- 
matic heart disease, and surgical cor- 
rection of the valvular deformities has 
become a well-established treatment. 
In many developing countries, par- 
ticularly in the tropical and subtropical 
regions, the reverse situation can be 
seen. Severe rheumatic heart disease 
is being recognized with increasing 
frequency and it is the most wide- 
spread and serious chronic heart 
disease in children and young adults. 
Poor social and economic conditions, 
inadequate hygienic and therapeutic 
measures as well as increasing urban- 
ization appear to be far more impor- 
tant than climate. The high proportion 
of children in the population and the 
rapid progression from onset of the 
disease to severe permanent damage 
of the heart valves and irreversible 
heart failure make this a serious 
problem, 
Tropical physicians and pathologists 
are familiar with the presence of 
advanced rheumatic heart disease in 
children below the age of ten, and 
considerable evidence indicates that 
the prevalence of chronic heart dis- 
ease is increasing in many tropical 
countries. 
Despite the frequency of chronic 
rheumatic heart disease in the tropics 
and sub-tropics, surprisingly little acute 
rheumatic fever is diagnosed in these 
areas. Surveys carried out by WHO 
consultants suggest that the clinical 
features of acute rheumatic fever may 
be different in the tropical countries

### 52072: Geography of heart disease

and that the natural history of rheu- 
matic heart disease may be modified 
by environmental factors. 
It is widely accepted that acute 
rheumatic fever is caused by strepto- 
coccal infection, usually manifested as 
a sore throat, and that treatment of the 
infection can prevent rheumatic fever. 
A question which requires study in 
the tropical situation is whether strep- 
tococcal skin infections, which are very 
common and often precede acute 
kidney disease, may also result in 
rheumatic fever, 
At the WHO seminar on cardio- 
vascular diseases due to infections, 
held in Manila in November 1968, the 
preventive aspects of rheumatic fever 
and rheumatic heart disease were fully 
discussed. 
In Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, 
Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia 
and New Guinea, there is a significant 
amount of rheumatic fever and partic- 
ularly rheumatic heart disease. The 
severity of streptococcal infection and 
the degree of the immune response to 
streptococci are factors influencing a 
high rheumatic disease incidence. 
Reports from countries in the west- 
ern Pacific region showed a wide 
range in the magnitude of the problem; 
according to some reports, the situa- 
tion may be considered under control, 
for example among the European 
population of Australia and New Zea- 
land; elsewhere a severe problem is 
recognized, for example in the Philip- 
pines, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
Persons who have recovered from 
an attack of rheumatic fever remain 
susceptible throughout their lives and 
thus require continual medical super- 
vision. However, if their infections are 
promptly treated with antibiotics, 
serious damage to the heart can be 
prevented. 
In most of the western Pacific 
region, existing health services are 
able to dispense long-acting penicillin 
to those already suffering from rheum- 
atic fever in order to prevent serious 
relapse and heart damage. But the 
main obstacles to actually doing it are 
lack of a clearly defined programme, 
the lack of free medicine, and lack of 
public awareness. 
Of the many parasites which may 
damage the heart, the most serious is 
Trypanosoma cruzi which is respon- 
sible for Chagas’ heart disease. Car- 
los Chagas, a Brazilian physician, des- 
cribed this condition for the first time 
in 1909 as being common in central 
Brazil although the disease had been 
locally recognized in many regions 
well before this time. 
Chagas’ heart disease can be 
regarded as one of the plagues in 
several countries of Latin America and 
there are areas in which as much as 
half of the population is infected. The 
parasite is transmitted to man by a 
biting bug; the acute phase of the 
illness occurs within two weeks of 
the entry of the parasite. 
Apart from fever and typical signs at 
  
Photo D. Henrioud - WHO, Geneva 
the site of entry of the parasite, there 
may be acute myocarditis (inflamma- 
tion of the heart muscle) with enlarge- 
ment of the heart and heart failure. 
In most cases, this phase passes un- 
recognized and the first symptoms 
appear many years later when the 
damage has been done and the disease 
has become chronic. Although the 
heart is the most frequently damaged 
organ, in some endemic areas, partic- 
ularly in Argentina and Brazil, charac- 
teristic disturbances in the digestive 
tract are also common. 
The basic problem of chronic Cha- 
gas’ heart disease is a disturbance in 
the conduction system of the electrical 
impulses which are responsible for the 
harmonious pumping activity of the 
heart. Various types of rhythm irreg- 
ularities and even interruption of 
impulse conduction and heart block 
are common, and may lead to stop- 
page of the heart beat in an apparently 
healthy subject. In other subjects, 
damage to the heart muscle is gradual 
and progressive, sometimes resulting 
in decreased pumping ability of the 
heart and enormous dilatation, and 
ending in heart failure. 
There is no specific treatment for 
Chagas’ heart disease. Prevention, 
however, is possible by interrupting 
the transmission of the parasite by the 
proper use of insecticides and espe- 
cially by the improvement of housing 
and living conditions. These are vital 
tasks for the public health authorities 
in the endemic areas.

Sven Johnsson, a 58 year- 
year-old machinist, works in the busy 
port city of Goteborg, Sweden's 
second largest city. He was raised in 
a small town several hundred kilo- 
metres to the north and came to 
Goteborg as a young man. Sven's 
formal education stopped at the age 
of 14. Both his parents died young, 
and Sven was forced to go to work 
before he had completed his second- 
ary school education.

A few months ago, Sven had a heart

the hospital. A thorough physical 
examination showed that his heart was 
enlarged and that his' vital capacity, or 
lung function, was lower than it should 
be. He was also suffering from 
breathlessness and chronic bronchitis. 
Certain blood lipids, such as serum 
cholesterol and triglycerides, were 
higher than normal.

He is a composite drawn from a study 
of cardiovascular patients. The investi-

such a study as the population is 
stable, and accurate records make the 
statistician’s task easier. 
~ Since we already knew that the risk 
of heart attack increases with age, we 
chose only middle-aged men born the 
same year, 1913. When the study 
began in 1963, none of them had any 
signs of heart trouble, but by 1971, 
some 36 had had heart attacks. 
Their backgrounds disclosed several 
common denominators, all described in 
the portrait of Sven Johnsson. Smok-

is continuing, is only part of a large- 
scale programme for cardiovascular 
disease control ‘in Goteborg. The 
second part is an attempt to prevent 
ischaemic or coronary heart disease. 
Some 10,000 men aged between 45 and 
55 were chosen at random to receive 
preventive treatment. The treatment 
is designed to reduce three of the risk 
factors—high cholesterol, high blood- 
pressure and smoking. Another 20,000 
men were selected as controls and 
given no treatment. 
The 10,000 risk factor subjects are 
treated at the Section of Preventive 
Cardiology at Sahlgren’s Hospital, 
which serves the whole of Géteborg. 
The anti-smoking part of the pro- 
gramme is still in the development 
stage, but after three months of 
treatment 40 per cent of the par- 
ticipants stopped smoking completely. 
Those who have difficulty giving up 
the habit come to information sessions 
and group meetings. They are some- 
times given individual treatment as 
well. Chewing-gum flavoured with 
nicotine is sometimes helpful as a 
physical aid. 
Among the patients receiving treat- 
ment for hypertension, or high blood- 
pressure, some drop out after a while. 
Here again certain common social and 
emotional factors are present. The 
patient who drops out nas usually dis- 
covered only recently that he has 
hypertension. He has less education 
than the others, and a lower income, 
We have tried to reduce the drop- 
out rate by developing a special pro- 
gramme for these newly detected 
cases. It begins with a slide-session

tension is and what can be done about 
Goteborg, Sweden's second largest city, 
has carried out a major study of 
cardiovascular disease since 1963. At 
the city’s Sahlgren Hospital, some 10,000 men 
aged between 45 and 55 are given special 
treatment aimed to reduce three risk 
factors of heart disease—high cholesterol, 
high blood pressure and smoking (details 
in article this page). Left, a physiotherapist

it. General discussion follows, with 
questions encouraged. Later, the 
patients are called in at regular inter- 
vals for re-examination and follow-up 
visits, to stimulate attendance for 
treatment while prevention is. still 
possible, A good physician-patient 
relationship is important, so we try- 
to make sure that these “doubtful” 
patients always see the same doctor. 
All cases of heart attack and stroke 
that occur in Goteborg are reported 
and entered in a register, so by compar- 
ing the register with our records we 
can tell whether these cases have 
received preventive treatment. In 
about four or five years, we should 
learn how much of an influence our 
preventive efforts have had. 
Meanwhile, we are trying to improve 
after-care for people who already have 
myocardial infarction. When the pro- 
gramme began in 1967 we discovered 
that care after patients left hospital 
was very uneven. Some were receiv- 
ing intensive and specialized physical 
training, but others nothing at all. Just 
as many patients died in the first year 
after an attack as died in hospital at 
the time. 
Coronary care units using 
new techriiques have greatly increas- 
ed survival chances for heart attack 
patients. By giving regular check-ups 
and supervision after their release 
from hospital, we hope to improve 
these chances still further. 
When we first set up the infarction 
clinic, we had to limit it to patients 
under 55 years of age at the time of 
their attack, but now we cover all 
those under 67. We leave the actual 
treatment in hospital to the doctors 
there, and take over when the patient 
goes home. Apart from regular phy- 
sical check-ups, psychological and 
social factors are of the utmost impor- 
tance in the recovery phase, and we 
have to educate the patient's family 
as well as the patient. 
The staff of the infarction clinic 
includes a psychiatrist and two psy- 
chologists. Patients are invited to 
bring their wives or husbands to dis- 
cuss their condition. We explain the 
treatment of complications and point 
out the risks which could lead to 
another attack. All these patients 
were originally smokers. Half of them 
stop smoking completely a year after 
they begin treatment. 
Nearly 1,000 patients are in follow- 
up treatment at the infarction clinic. 
Many of them do supervised exercises 
which help us to judge the right time 
for them to return to work. When a 
patient knows his physical capacity 
and how he can best make use of it, 
he gains in reassurance and con- 
fidence. Then he can gradually return 
to an active life, at work and in his 
leisure hours. The results so far indi- 
cate that patients who persevere with 
physical training lead a healthier life. 
Survival rates can be improved if 
patients know the warning signs of 
infarction. Many people die suddenly 
from ischaemic heart disease outside 
hospital. Most have signs of previous 
infarction or have had chest symptoms 
a week before their death. These 
symptoms should have been recogniz- 
ed as early warning signals. Patients 
who have had one infarction, and their 
relatives, must watch out for any 
recurrence of symptoms so that action 
can be taken in time. 
Hypertension is a frequent early 
warning sign. Five per cent of the 
population over 50 are hypertensive. 
Early recognition of high blood-pres- 
sure is the most promising of all 
preventive aids at our disposal. 
A modern health service is expen- 
sive and must be efficient. The cardio- 
vascular programme in Goteborg 
offers a chance to compare costs and 
benefits of the various forms of care 
we provide, and to find the answers 
to many questions. How many inten- 
sive coronary care units and infarction 
out-patient clinics do we need? How 
many can we afford? What is the 
value of primary as compared with 
secondary preventive care? Does 
health education save lives? When we 
know these things we shall be able 
to provide an improved service to 
heart patients, and give many people 
a longer lease of life. |

DOES HIGH STANDARD OF 
by Dan Behrman 
A high standard of living 
can mean a high rate of death from 
heart disease. Not only that, but 
“labour-saving” occupations are not 
necessarily life-saving. 
These are the conclusions that one 
is tempted to draw from the recently- 
published results of a study on how 
heart attacks strike a county in the 
southern United States. They shed a 
glimmer of light on the problem of 
coronary heart disease—that is, myo- 
cardial infarction and angina pectoris— 
as a companion to highly-developed 
societies. 
The story of the study goes back 
more than ten years when Dr. Curtis 
G. Hames, a general practitioner in 
Evans County, Georgia, observed that 
his black patients appeared to suffer 
coronary heart attacks much less fre- 
quently than whites, even though Evans 
County lies in the so-called “coronary 
belt” of the United States running from 
Virginia through Georgia. 
He was not the first to make such 
an observation. Other physicians had 
noted the apparent immunity of blacks 
to coronaries and had attributed it to 
racial differences. But Hames’ cur- 
iosity drove him further. 
As he reported in Archives of 
Internal Medicine, recently published

### 52074: Does high standard of living equal high rate of dying?

EQUAL HIGH RATE OF 
by the American Medical Association, 
it led to a community study of Evans 
County with support from the Amer- 
ican government and the nearby Uni- 
versity of North Carolina. 
Evans County must be a quiet place, 
judging from .what the Archives of 
Internal Medicine says about it. It 
lies sixty miles inland from the Atlan- 
tic Ocean on a coastal plain of red 
clay and sandy soil. Pine forests 
ramble over much of its area (at its 
greatest diameter, the county mea- 
sures 19 miles). Not much industry to 
speak of, there's a sewing factory giv- 
ing jobs to 500 and another plant that 
makes. .. fruitcake. 
In 1960, when the study began, the 
population of Evans County was 6,952 
and, by 1970, it had gone up to only 
7,290. Obviously a stable community, 
and a good one for a long-term health 
study. Two-thirds of the population 
live in completely rurai surroundings. 
Two-thirds, too, are white and one- 
third black. 
During an 18-month period between 
1960 and 1962, every Evans County 
resident over the age of 40 and half 
the residents between 15 and 39 were 
given complete physical examinations, 
3,102 in all. 
These examinations bore out what 
Dr. Hames had noticed. Coronary 
heart disease was a rarity for black 
men, it hit them only half as often as 
it did whites. But the study brought 
out a new factor: whites on the bottom 
half of the social ladder were not 
being affected any more than blacks. 
Summarizing the findings in the 
Archives, Dr. John C. Cassel, of the 
University of North Carolina, comment- 
ed that they could not be attributed 
to other factors such as blood pres- 
sure, blood cholesterol levels, cigarette 
smoking, body weight or diet. 
But the state of a man's heart 
appeared to be linked to what he did 
for a living or, in Dr. Cassel's words, 
“these occupational differences sug- 
gested that possibly physical activity 
exerted a protective effect and that 
variations in the level of physical act- 
ivity between the various ethnic and 
social class groups accounted, at least 
in part, for the difference in their 
rates.” 
This looked promising, but not after 
a first glance at the results of a follow- 
up study made between 1967 and 1969 
covering nearly 99 per. cent of those 
who had been originally examined. 
This study showed that vulnerability 
to coronary heart diseases was now 
affecting nearly all whites equally. The 
doctors reasoned that the younger 
men on the bottom were under greater 
pressure—in any case, their blood 
pressure was greater—because they 
were climbing up. 
Yet the difference between blacks 
and whites persisted during the follow- 
up study. Was it then a matter of 
race after all? Researchers looked 
hard at the figures. They saw that, as 
Dr. Cassel wrote, “the only circum- 
stance in which white men had as low 
rates as blacks was when they were 
both sharecroppers.” He added that 
the only difference between white 
sharecroppers and other white men 
was that they had to work a lot harder 
physically, as hard as black share- 
croppers do. 
White or black, a share- 
cropper does a hard day's work. A 
visitor to one Evans County farm 
reported that the tenant was up before 
the sun. He ate a big breakfast—bacon 
and eggs fried in hot lard (enough to 
make some people die just at the mere 
thought of so much animal fat), coffee 
and bread—then he and his wife went 
out to work. At seven in the morning, 
they were caring for some 30,000 baby 
chickens on the farm, 
When they stopped for lunch, they 
filled up on starches and carbohydra- 
tes—a stew of cheap beef, rice and 
turnip greens. Then back to work until 
after six, more fats and starches for 
supper, and an evening around the 
television set. 
The visitor also reported that this 
sharecropper chews tobacco, takes a 
drink of whisky from time to time, but 
never takes a vacation. Yet his chan- 
ces of developing coronary , heart 
disease after the age of 40 are less 
than a third as high (31- per 1,000 dur- 
ing the 1960-62 period) as those of a 
professional man or a top executive 
“earning $20,000 a year, enjoying a 
three-week vacation, but sitting at a 
desk all day long. In that bracket, the 
coronary rate was 96 per 1,000. 
The mere virtues of rural living do 
not explain the difference, for the white 
farm owner was almost as vulnerable 
to heart attack as the city executive. 
Dr.- Cassel, the professor, turned to 
Dr. Hames, the family doctor, for an 
explanation and this is what he was 
told. 
The men who had been labelled high

DYING? 
  
social class, while living in a rural 
environment were in fact living a very 
“urban” way of life, 
In contrast to their fathers, they were 
not living by the sun but by the clock; 
they were commuting to work in small 
industries, their wives were driving in 
car pools, and even if they were farm 
owners, they were no longer private 
entrepreneurs but “employees” of 
some larger company. 
Further there was some evidence 
that an increasing proportion of white 
men in Evans County, even those 
labelled low social class, were begin- 
ning to participate in this 20th-century 
urban “way of life” as the county was . 
rapidly changing from a rural agrarian 
to a more industrialized economy. 
However, it would be a mistake to 
take the results of the Evans County 
study as a plea for poverty (in fact, 
it isn't—the unemployed, the poorest 
of all, got more heart attacks than the 
sharecroppers) or a plea for a high- 
starch diet. 
What it does seem to show is, as 
Dr. Cassel says, that physical activity 
is a protection against coronary heart 
disease, but only above some 
“threshold value” which is exceeded 
by farmers and particularly sharecrop- 
pers, white and black. Physical activity 
increases the diameter of the blood 
vessels in the heart and this is a 
“plausible biological explanation” for 
its role, state the Evans County 
researchers. 
They are less certain about where 
this “threshold value” lies, a subject 
of great controversy in the medical 
profession. Studies made elsewhere 
do not settle it. In one factory in a 
large American city, active workers 
suffered from coronary heart disease 
just as much as their sedentary 
colleagues, even though they were 
expending over 50 per cent more 
calories. 
In Evans County, the study also 
showed that social instability seemed 
to go hand-in-hand with vulnerability 
to coronaries. In the lowest social 
classes, men were more likely to get 
heart attacks if they were moving 
upward than if they were stable. 
However, in the higher brackets, it 
was those up above who seemed to 
be less in danger. 
It may be that in both cases,

cardiologists 
dWdy 
A study carried 
out on men aged from 50 to 
59 by the Myasnikov Institute 
of Cardiology, in Moscow, 
shows that one man in five 
suffers frcm coronary heart 
disease and nearly one In 
four has high blood pressure 
(hypertension). 
It also reveals that these 
diseases now occur more fre- 
quently in. younger persons. 
Deaths from cardiovascular dis- 
eases In men aged from 35 to 
44 have risen sharply, and a 
serious increase is noted In 
even younger. men, 
According to the Myasnikov 
Institute, which collaborates 
with the World Health Organi- 
zation as a cardiovascular 
research centre, atherosclerotic 
changes In the vessels of the 
heart and aorta are also on 
the Increase among younger 
persons. 
This finding Is borne out by 
research at Riga (Latvia) where 
doctors investigating the deaths 
of persons between the ages 
of 30 and 39 who had suffered 
from atherosclerosis found that 
on the average 22 per cent of 
the internai surface of the ab- 
dominal aorta was . affected 
by the disease. 
This disease, however, .be- 
comes far more serious after 
the age of 40 and complications 
such as heart attacks and 
strokes may well occur. 
Observations have revealed 
two important factors: where 
one lives and how one lives. 
  
EVGENI I. CHAZOV is a cor- 
responding Member of the 
US.S.R. Academy of Medical 
Sciences. In 1969, he was 
awarded a State Prize for deveil- 
oping new methods of treatment 
for coronary heart disease. He 
is the author of many publica- 
tions and research studies on 
the problems of cardiovascular 
disease. Prof. Chazov, who Is 
41 years old, is now Deputy 
Minister of Public Health of the 
U.S.S.R. 
by Evgeni I. Chazov 
While 2.2 per cent of workers 
over the age of 40 in Moscow 
fall victims to heart attacks, the 
figure for a comparable group 
of workers in Ufa, in the 
southern Urals, Is only 0.6 per 
cent. This suggests that the 
faster pace and different pattern 
of life in the capital may 
increase vulnerability to heart 
attacks. 
Current research In the 
U.S.S.R. points to the influence 
of certain environmental fac- 
tors on the appearance and 
development of several dis- 
eases of the heart. In many 
rural areas, hypertension Is 
found only half as often as In 
the towns, In some parts of 
eastern Siberla, for example, 
angina pectoris among smokers 
over the age of 30 was observ- 
ed in 27 persons out of 1,000, 
whereas in non-smokers of the 
same age group the proportion 
was oniy 16 per thousand. 
In some parts of Uzbekistan, 
the frequency of coronary heart 
disease among local people 
who eat vegetable fats has 
been compared with that among 
immigrants who eat mainly ani- 
mal fats. Among local men 
over the age of 30, only 3.2 per 
cent had coronary atheroscle- 
rosis; among the immigrants the 
percentage was 8.8 per cent. 
Occupation seems also to 
play a part In the appearance 
of coronary disease and heart 
attacks. Among technical en- 
gineering personnel, the rate is 
twice that of workers whose 
jobs apparently cause less 
mental strain. This situation, 
however, is changing, since 
nowadays jobs tend to be- 
come more and more complex 
and often lead to Increased 
nervous tension. 
The Importance of mental 
factors has been confirmed 
many times. Among 200,000 
workers and employees in Mos- 
cow, high blood pressure was 
found most frequently among 
workshop engineers, foremen, 
dispatchers and technicians, of 
whom 7.2 per cent were affect-

It is all too easy for the harassed 
city-dweller to neglect his body, 
already enduring the stress 
and pollution of modern 
industrialized life. The value of 
moderate physical exercise 
as a means of preventing heart 
disease is now widely recognized. 
Some 50 million people belong 
to physical culture organizations in 
the Soviet Union (photo left).

ed. The next group consisted 
of engineering constructors, 
workers in the technical control 
sectors and accountants, of 
whom 6.2 per cent were 
affected. 
High bicod pressure often 
occurs among workers exposed 
to excessive noise, vibrations 
or other unfavourable con- 
ditions. For example, the per- 
centage of cases of high blood 
pressure was 69 among 
poiishers, and 5.7 among elec- 
trical fitters. The disease is 
also common among bus and 
taxi drivers. 
Among women, high blood 
pressure is frequent among 
telephonists and telegraphists, 
who work “under pressure”. 
It is less frequent among 
women in textile factories. 
Studies carried out in eastern 
Siberia, where very strong 
liquor is drunk, and in Georgia, 
where dry wines are mainly 
consumed, have shown no rela- 
tionship between the occurrence 
of coronary atherosclerosis or 
ischaemic heart disease and 
the consumption of alcohol, 
although alcoho! undoubtedly 
plays a part in the appearance 
of cardiac insufficiency. 
The tendency to have heart 
attacks at an earlier age is 
found in many countries. The 
explanation may be that athero- 
sclerosis of the coronary 
arteries starts to develop now- 
adays much earlier. This, in 
turn relates to a number of 
factors: reduced physical acti- 
vity, dietary changes and 
greater emotional strain brought 
about by technological dev- 
elopment and the frantic tempo 
of modern life. 
The part played by stress in 
heart attacks is particularly 
obvious. At the Myasnikov Ins- 
titute of Cardiology, we studied 
the events that led up to the 
heart attack in many of our 
patients. The attack was imme- 
diately preceded in 20.5 per 
cent of cases by an acute emo- 
tional shock; in 35 per cent by 
a state of emotional tension 
lasting several days; in 30 per 
cent by prolonged overwork; 
but in only 4.5 per cent by a 
physical effort. 
Preventlve measures go 
beyond the purely medical 
framework and are very lar- 
gely social in character. The 
U.S.S.R. has a large network 
of treatment centres, spas and 
rest homes, organizations for 
culture and travel 
assoclations. Special attention 
is also given to the improve- 
ment of environmental health, 
the promotion of balanced diets 
and similar measures. 
Physical culture organizations 
have a membership of some 
50 million, including not only 
young people, but many of 
middle and even advanced age. 
Some eight million persons 
come to State centres for 
rest, preventive examinations 
and treatment. 
Another institution which 
plays an Important part is the 
preventorium In industry. For 
a month or a month and a 
haif, manual and office workers 
may spend time there after 
work under the supervision of 
doctors who test their blood 
pressure, carry out laboratory 
analyses and prescribe treat- 
ment, diets or gymnastics. 
in this way, preventive 
therapy—gymnastics, the im- 
provement of sleeping habits 
or of diet—can be carried out 
without the worker having to 
interrupt his job. There are 
many such preventoriums in 
the U.S.S.R.; at present they 
have over 100,000 beds. 
We are very much against 
the sort of life in which the 
individual, after an eight-hour 
working day, takes refuge In 
trashy books, or stretches out 
on a sofa in front of the tele- 
vision set, or sits drinking with 
friends. 
A passive, sedentary life, 
totally lacking in any creative 
effort, in physical activity or 
intellectual stimulation, is at 
the origin of disturbances in 
the metabolism of fats and 
carbohydrates, and leads to fur- 
ther disturbances In the ner- 
vous system. In this way, 
conditions are created for the 
development of atherosclerosis, 
coronary insufficiency and vas- 
cular spasms. 
Sieeping long enough is an- 
other important point. Sleep 
should be part of a well- 
regulated life, and not the 
result of taking sleeping npiils. 
We attach great importance 
to human relationships, to 
character formation, and to 
education in the widest sense 
of the term. The spirit of com- 
radeship, tact, discretion, self- 
control and respect for others 
are not merely moral obliga- 
tions, but are fundamental for 
the education of a healthy 
generation, They are also 
important in the prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases. 
Education in this sense should 
start at school, It is important 
that children should be taught 
to master their emotions. 
in the prevention of heart 
diseases, an important role can 
be played by health education, 
and special scientific research 
institutes have been created in 
the U.S.S.R. for this purpose. 
In conclusion, a word about 
heart transplantations. It is 
obvious that such operations 
illustrate the remarkable possl- 
bilities of modern medicine. 
Yet there Is no doubt that 
heart transplants cannot provide 
any broad solution to the prob- 
lem of cardiovascular diseases. 
Frankly, 1 believe that the 
search for methods to prevent 
atherosclerosis, heart attacks 
or high blood pressure offer 
greater promise than 100 or 
even 1,000 brilliantly successful 
heart transplants. |_|

Office of Health Economics in London. 
study, carried out under the supervision of its 
tion, diagnosis and treatment. 
Coronary 
  
heart disease 
 
By 1990, the possibility of 
preventing coronary heart disease by 
most of the currently mooted methods 
will at least have been thoroughly 
explored. 
BLOOD LIPIDS (fats). The effec- 
tiveness of one important cholesterol- 
lowering medicine will be known by 
1975. A definitive answer concerning 
the benefits to be obtained from 
dietary changes affecting blood lipids 
will not be available before 1980, if 
then. There is a very strong and 
fairly general expectation that lower 
blood lipid levels are more likely to 
be achieved by medicines than by 
dietary changes. By 1975, we should 
have medicines to decrease the body's 
absorption or synthesis of lipo- 
proteins, Whatever means of affecting 
blood lipids is adopted, a screening 
process, probably including young 
adults and children, will identify those 
with abnormal blood levels. 
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. The 
results of various trials will soon result 
in routine screening being offered. By 
1980, people will probably be given 
a blood pressure screening every year, 
possibly even by self-measurement. 
Safe and effective medicines for the 
control of a high blood pressure will 
be available, perhaps given in fixed- 
dose regimens, 
Some five to ten per cent of the 
middle-aged men screened will be 
found to need lipid control; some two 
per cent of middle-aged and old 
people screened will need control of 
blood pressure. It is estimated, how- 
ever, that only 50 per cent of those 
needing such controls will adopt and 
persevere with treatment. In addition, 
some 25 per cent of persons who have 
had an attack of coronary heart 
disease will receive treatment aimed 
at reducing blood lipid levels. 
DIABETES. The association of 
diabetes with coronary heart disease 
(and with strokes and disease of the 
limb arteries) is already established, 
and by 1975, trials will have proved 
the value of anti-diabetic treatment in 
preventing the occurrence of these 
diseases in borderline diabetics. Once 
such proof is available, then, as with 
high blood lipid levels and a raised 
blood pressure, widespread preventive 
measures will be undertaken. 
OBESITY. The treatment of obesity 
is already regarded as a medical task, 
and medicines which effectively “burn 
off” excess calories without other un- 
The full 
desirable side effects should soon be 
available. This approach is more likely 
to be effective than educational 
measures to improve dietary habits. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING. Present 
evidence incriminating cigarette smok- 
ing will be stronger by 1975 and, by 
1990, cigarette consumption, at least 
in high-risk subjects, may be only 
50 per cent of present levels. 
OTHER RISK FACTORS. Other 
known or suggested risk factors 
include lack of exercise, an inherited 
tendency to the disease, and stress; 
these may be less amenable to control. 
To combat stress there may be ways 
of controlling the heart action, when 
necessary, so that emotional over- 
loading does not occur. 
EARLY TREATMENT. In order to 
combat the very high mortality in the 
first hour after coronary thrombosis, 
a form of treatment may be developed 
that could be used immediately the 
patient is seen by his family doctor, 
or possibly even by the patient himself 
as soon as he had a symptom suggest- 
ing an attack. This would give pro- 
tection for some hours against the 
dangerous disturbances of the heart's 
rhythm that commonly occur in this 
condition. If the patient is to be able 
to apply the treatment himself, it would 
have to be extremely safe, since it 
would often be mistakenly used for 
minor conditions. 
CONTROL OF SHOCK. Better 
blood plasma substitutes and better 
pharmaceutical contro! of shock will 
also help in the treatment of the 
disease once it has gained a footing, 
as will electrical pacing of the heart. 
These advances will come mostly from 
the experience gained in intensive 
coronary care units which will continue 
for some years but which may, if 
safe efficient therapy can be derived, 
be a passing phase. 
ANGINA PECTORIS (a condition 
allied in various ways to coronary 
thrombosis). More effective, long- 
acting preparations, which might 
improve the blood supply to the heart 
muscle, and medicines designed to 
prevent anginal attacks while not 
depressing the heart muscle will both 
be developed by 1975. 
NEW MEDICINES FORECAST. By 
1975, new medicines should be 
available to increase the blood's 
ability to dissolve the fibrin of blood 
clots. On the other hand, there Is 
probably a less promising future for 
anti-coagulant medicines. Other new 
medicines forecast include some that 
will increase the strength of con- 
Director, George Teeling-Smith, ranges over many 
branches of medicine from allergic disorders and 
cancer to mental illness and virus infections. On

sabaya, Director of the Myasnikov Cardiological 
Institute, in Moscow, comments on these forecasts.

affecting the heart's rhythm adversely,

stimulate urination) suitable for cases 
resistant to present diuretics or less 
liable to cause a loss of potassium 
from the body. Myocardial infarction 
will probably be treated by direct 
injection through the skin into the 
heart of tissue culture extracts 
containing capillary vessel buds and 
growth-stimulating substances making 
revascularization surgery unnecessary. 
SURGERY. In a small proportion 
of the very large number of cases 
surgery will still be needed. Artificial 
hearts should be perfected by 1990 
and may replace human and animal 
transplants because of availability. 
Some experts believe that pig hearts 
will be increasingly used for heart 
transplantation, the specially bred pigs 
being “immunized” beforehand against 
a rejection of their hearts by the 
human recipients. 
PREDICTION AND PREVENTION. 
By 1990, it should be possible to 
predict which people are going to have 
an attack of coronary thrombosis 
within a matter of days and to minimize 
their chances of dying from a sudden 
disturbance of heart action. Great 
advances should be made In cardio- 
logical diagnosis. This should make 
it possible to carry out automated 
predictive studies, for example at 
three-monthly intervals. These could 
indicate whether the heart was per- 
forming easily or haltingly. Even if 
this particular approach does not 
prove successful, it should bring 
benefits by re-orienting the medical 
profession to a predictive approach 
to heart disease. There is dis- 
agreement as to the effect of the 
various preventive measures on the 
incidence and mortality of coronary 
heart disease; the forecasts range 
from “an important fall” to no very 
marked change in the national 
coronary mortality rate despite all 
the methods of prevention adopted. 
Vascular diseases 
 
The problems of vascular disease 
are in many ways similar to those of 
heart disease. 
HYPERTENSION. Substantial pro- 
gress cannot be expected until there 
is a better understanding of the under- 
lying mechanisms of vascular changes 
and the causes of hypertension (high 
blood pressure). This is likely to 
come within ten years. It should then 
be possible to use naturally occurring 
hypotensive agents to control: hyper- 
tension. Immediate advances in vas-

IN THE YEAR 1990 (Continued) 
cular diseases will depend on better 
peripheral vascular diagnostic proced- 
ures, probably based on ultra-sonic 
techniques. 
TRACE ELEMENTS. Another possible 
form of progress will be the identi- 
fication of trace metals and other 
“micro-nutrients” whose absence may 
be responsible for vascular damage. 
Once these are identified, and tests 
have been developed to indicate their 
presence, replacement therapy should 
be possible for individuals in whom 
they are lacking. This may be avail- 
able by 1975 or 1980. A better under- 
standing of the general aging process 
and its effect on the blood vessels 
should be achieved by 1990. 
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. lt is 
also likely that other environmental 
causative agents will be identified and 
(as with smoking at present) the 
challenge will be to change national 
habits to reduce exposure to such 
causes. 
SURGERY. In the immediate future, 
surgical techniques will improve, and 
lasers, for instance, will be used to 
burn away diseased tissue. The next 
step forward will be in the field of 
vascular replacement, first with grafts 
from humans and then with grafts from 
animal banks and finally with grafts 
from tissue culture extracts such as 
chick-embryo growth extract mixed 
with vascular buds which will be devel- 
oped from a small piece of specially 
treated patient's tissue. 
THROMBOSIS. Early in the 1970s,

One must .obviously agree 
with the experts’ conclusion that 
methods for preventing heart disease 
will have been thoroughly explored 
before the end of the century, and 
that by 1975, or thereabouts, the 
pharmaceutical industry will be pro- 
ducing medicines to lower the pro- 
portion of cholesterol in the blood. 
sible by separating anti-thrombotic and 
anti-coagulant properties. Specific 
fibrin-dissolving enzymes should be 
available to prevent thrombus (blood 
clot) formation. 
HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS. There will 
remain the problem of identifying 
high-risk individuals and pre-sympto- 
matic cases and getting social 
acceptance for large-scale preventive 
medication in these individuals. This 
need for early identification of vas- 
cular or blood changes is particularly 
important, first because many acute 
bouts of vascular disease are rapidly 
fatal and second because the changes 
which have occurred by the time symp- 
toms appear are often irreversible. 
Specifically, the brain damage caused 
by a vascular catastrophe will still be 
untreatable by 1990. 
Conclusion 
  
The pessimistic view is that the 
conquest of many diseases of middle- 
age (and particularly coronary heart 
disease) will leave growing numbers to 
suffer in old age from progressively 
destructive vascular disorders and de- 
terioration of their nervous system. 
The more optimistic view is that des- 
pite the great difficulties the causes of 
vascular disorders also will be under- 
stood, and that the medical profes- 
sion and the public will accept the con- 
sequent implications of early diagnosis 
and long-term therapy for those at 
risk, In this way vascular diseases 
could be effectively controlled by the 
1990s. | 
Yet to my mind the experts 
seem to have picked out isolated 
facts from a series of different 
discoveries, grouped them—some- 
what arbitrarily, it seems to me—and 
then tried to sketch in, on that basis, 
an overall picture of all future trends 
in cardiology. 
It seems likely, for instance, that 
predictions about the use of grafts 
from animals (heterografts) in human 
heart-transplant operations will prove 
to be unrealistic, though this does not 
apply to partial transplants. 
The experts’ forecasts on smoking 
also seem to me somewhat question- 
able. 
A question worth examining is why

leading cause of death in the world, 
after having ousted cancer from that 
unenviable position. 
While there can be no simple 
answer to this question, one thing 
is obvious: the heart occupies a 
unique place and function in the body. 
it is the focal point of stress from 
many forces. It reacts to the slightest 
change in the body's environment 
and is extremely sensitive to every 
occurrence in daily life. Doctors ac- 
cordingly find it hard to master the 
problems of heart disease. 
In recent years, heart diseases have 
“grown younger”, as shown by the 
increasing number of cases among 
young persons. Changes in our way

are not alone a sufficient explanation 
of this. Heart diseases are the result 
of a whole series of influences acting 
on man's organism, 
Past experience has convinced 
cardiologists that there is a very close 
relationship between high blood 
pressure (hypertension), deterioration 
within the blood vessels (athero- 
sclerosis}, and damage to the heart 
due to a faulty supply of blood to the 
heart muscles (ischaemic disease). 
These processes are interconnected 
and influence each other. 
Hypertension actively provokes 
atherosclerosis. Increased blood 
pressure can lead to a heart attack. 
And atherosclerosis may trigger the 
development of hypertension. 
  
  
This implies that by treating one 
ailment we can affect the development 
of another. It took cardiologists a 
great deal of time and effort to reach 
this simple conclusion. Yet this 
“systems approach” is a vital factor 
in forecasts concerning cardiovascular 
diseases. 
So before turning to prospects in 
the fight against heart disease, | 
would like to say a word on hyper- 
tension and its treatment in the future. 
| think that by 1975 we shall be able 
to stabilize the pathological process 
of high blood pressure in many, if 
not all cases. We can expect that 
two or three years after such stabiliz- 
ation has been achieved, people 
suffering from this disease will find that 
their capacity to work has greatly 
improved. There will be less need 
for. hospital treatment, and far fewer 
complications and fatal cases. 
Forecasts offer even more hope to 
people afflicted by the disease in its 
early stages. Between five and seven 
years from now, it*seems likely that 
medicine, through a combination of 
treatment and advice, will be able to 
help innumerable victims of heart 
ailments by bringing about a “reces- 
sion” of the disease and in some 
cases curing it completely. 
Over the next ten years doctors 
will be able to fight “pre-disease” 
more effectively; that is, they will 
eliminate conditions leading to hyper- 
tension. Fifteen years ago this hardly 
seemed possible. During the second 
half of the 1950s medicine was only 
taking its first steps towards an under- 
standing of the way arterial hyper- 
tension appears, and how it evolves. 
New discoveries about the origin 
and development of hypertension have 
been made during the past ten years, 
and fairly effective forms of treatment 
have been developed. Doctors now 
dispose of a varied arsenal of med- 
icines which have a very important 
selective effect on the crucial links 
in the progress of the disease. 
Medical treatment is six to eight 
times more effective nowadays than

it used to be, and the life expectancy 
of patients has almost doubled. During 
the next ten years we shall be able 
to apply more new methods, with 
mathematical models and computers 
playing an important réle, 
In the more distant future, cyber- 
netic systems will be more widely 
applied to safeguard public health. 
They will enable health checks to be 
made on a massive scale—not only 
among existing heart patients but also 
for those who are prone to heart 
disease. This means that by about 
1990, “risk factors™ will have been 
reduced to a minimum. In some cases 
they are likely to be completely elimin- 
ated and in others their effects will 
be reduced, 
One has to admit that atherosclerosis 
is still an extremely serious problem 
and, in my opinion, the situation will 
not change for some time to come. 
Indeed, medicine will need to con- 
centrate much of its effort in the 
future on the fight against athero- 
sclerosis; the disease becomes more 
acute and occurs more frequently 
with advancing age, and every year 
 
the number of persons reaching the 
55-60 age group is increasing. 
As is often the case in science, the 
most urgent problem is also the 
hardest one to solve. Yet the outlook 
today is encouraging as is shown by 
the methods of diagnosis now in use 
and based on specially designed 
instruments and bio-chemical tech- 
niques 
medicines are now 
available for correcting the faulty 
metabolic processes that lead to 
atherosclerosis. Doctors are able to 
reduce fairly effectively the amount 
of cholesterol and other fatty sub- 
stances in the blood. They can also 
correct deteriorations in the exchange 
processes of substances such as 
carbohydrates and albumen, and they 
can restore the correct degree of 
permeability to the blood vessel walls. 
Furthermore, 
Given the present pace of techn- 
ical progress and recent advances in 
pharmacology, we should be winning 
the fight against atherosclerosis by 
about 1985 or 1990. But this will 
require an enormous effort. 
We can be even more hopeful and 
optimistic as regards the problems 
of defective coronary arteries and 
heart attacks. A few years after 
World War ll, these diseases increas- 
ed considerably in the Soviet Union. 
It is now clear that great progress 
has been made during the past five 
to seven years. 
Deaths have fallen by almost half 
and complications have also de- 
creased. Statistics show that some 
80 per cent of all patients can resume 
an active life during the first year 
after the disease began. This should 
surely encourage us to be optimistic 
about the future. 
By about 1980 the situation will 
improve considerably. The most im- 
portant task is to find effective ways 
of foreseeing and preventing heart 
attacks. Statistics compiled by the 
Institute of Cardiology of the U.S.S.R. 
Academy of Medical Sciences show a 
sharp reduction in cases of recurrent 
heart attacks among patients who have 
been under medical observation for 
three years, The number of working 
days lost has been nearly halved and 


### 52072: Geography of heart disease

GEOGRAPHY OF HEART DISEASE (Continued from page 21) 
At a meeting of the British Cardiac 
Society held in Oxford In 1946, 
Drs. Bedford and Konstam described a 
most unusual form of heart failure in 
African troops serving in Asia. The 
soldiers were mostly from West Africa, 
their average age was 20-30 years. 
They were all cases of heart failure 
and were found to have greatly 
enlarged hearts. Seventeen of forty 
patients under observations died and 
came to autopsy. The description of 
these hearts stimulated widespread 
interest in unusual forms of heart 
disease in the tropics. 
In the more common forms of heart 
disease, the heart's function is impair- 
ed by damaged valves, or by an in- 
creased load on the heart due to hyper- 
tension or disease of the coronary 
arteries. There are, however, disorders 
in which the main feature is a disease 
of the heart muscle itself; these 
conditions are now widely known by 
the collective term “cardiomyopathies”™. 
Many of the hearts described by 
Drs. Bedford and Konstam were of 
this kind, and subsequent reports have 
contributed greatly to the recognition 
of heart-muscle disease in the rest 
of the world. 
In the more affluent societies, a 
diseased heart muscle usually goes 
with poor blood supply, and the true 
cardiomyopathies have only recently 
been sorted out from the coronary 
heart diseases. Damage to the heart 
muscle may be produced by a wide 
variety of agents, some infective, some 
toxic, and even by nutritional defi- 
ciencies, hormonal upsets and meta- 
bolic disorders. Frequently, however, 
the cause of the damaged heart muscle 
is uncertain or unknown. 
Apart from alcohol, certain food 
additives and preservatives are now 
known to damage the heart muscle 
cells. Outbreaks of cardiomyopathies 
with high mortality have occurred 
recently in heavy beer drinkers in 
Canada. The beer had been treated with 
cobalt and papain; such unforeseen 
cardiac accidents are a warning of our 
need for a deeper knowledge of the 
normal mechanisms of the heart muscle 
cells. 
In comparison with the incidence of 
rheumatic heart disease or arterial 
hypertension, the cardiomyopathies 
occur with relative infrequency, 
although in some areas they are of 
considerable importance. In Ibadan, 
Nigeria, and among the African popu- 
lation of Johannesburg, South Africa, 
about one-third of the patients with 
clinical heart disease are considered 
to have heart muscle disease, while in 
Kampala, Uganda, only about 10 per 
cent are included in this category. 
At autopsy examination, about 4 per 
cent of hearts in Kampala, lamaica 
and Japan have this form of cardio- 
myopathy, while in Cali, Colombia, it 
runs as high as 12 per cent. Studies 
in many parts of Africa, in South 
America and in southeast Asia all indi- 
cate that unexplained enlarged hearts 
are a significant health problem; 
reports from Jamaica also point to a 
high prevalence of cardiac enlarge- 
ment which is not due to coronary 
artery disease. 
Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), in 
which a fibrous thickening constricts 
the cavities of the heart, particularly 
the ventricles, is a tropical cardiomyo- 
pathy in the true sense of the term; 
its occurrence as an endemic problem 
is confined to the tropical parts of the 
world. 
The disease has been intensively 
studied in Nigeria, Uganda and other 
countries within the tropical belt of the 
African continent, and in southern 
India, Ceylon, Malaysia, Brazil and 
Colombia. The occurrence of EMF in 
Europeans who have lived for long 
periods in West Africa and the very 
occasional report of EMF in subjects 
who have never lived in or visited the 
tropics are important clues whose 
meaning has not yet by any means 
been grasped. 
The disease apparently begins in 
childhood but by the time a diagnosis 
is made, heart damage is usually 
already serious and the patient is In 
a state of heart failure. Predominantly a 
disease of children and young adults, 
it is found in all age groups. There is 
no specific treatment beyond the 
general management of heart failure 
and, as the cause 1s unknown, pre- 
vention is not yet possible.

### 52072: Geography of heart disease

deaths have also considerably de- 
creased. Thus a heart attack with its 
related complications is not necessary 
fatal. 
The most frequent cause of sudden 
death is a serious disturbance of the 
heart rhythm in the form of a rapid 
twitching of the heart muscle cells, 
when the contractions of the heart 
virtually cease, thus arresting the 
pumping action which causes the 
blood to circulate. 
Though at this point a state of 
clinical death occurs, this can be 
reversed if the disturbance in the 
heart rhythm is eliminated in time 
with the aid of an electrical de- 
fibrillator. Most ambulances, hospitals, 
clinics and health centres are now 
equipped with this apparatus. By 1980 
(or by 1985 according to more cautious 
estimates) deaths from disturbances 
of the heart's rhythm during a heart 
attack will be exceptional. 
Let us hope that in the 21st century, 
cardiology will become simply a 
branch of preventive medicine. | 
Igor K. Shkhvatsahbaya 
In many ways, EMF appears to have 
a natural history similar to that of 
rheumatic heart disease. Studies in 
Kampala have also demonstrated a 
very significant concurrence of EMF 
and rheumatic heart disease in patients 
on whom autopsies have been made. 
This has lead to the hypothesis that 
EMF may be a disorder similar to 
rheumatic heart disease, another 
hypersensitivity disorder of the heart. 
Streptococcus, filariasis and malaria 
may also be factors in the development 
of this disease. 
There is a scientific philosophy 
according to which many problems of 
the highly developed world can best 
be solved away from the complexity 
and confusion of modern industrial 
societies; it may be as important to 
study communities apparently free 
from a disorder as those in which 
almost everyone is prone to it. 
As the preceding examples have 
shown, there may be something in the 
African or Asian diet, or way of life, 
which has some protective influence 
against the major killing heart diseases 
of Europe and North America. 
If the factor lacking in the one or 
present in the other proves to be 
decisive, then ways of preventing 
some common causes of death will be 
found. This type of comparative study 
is a way in which mankind can make 
use of its diversity for the common 
good. [|

THE FIRST HOSPITALS 
Sir, 
Your issue devoted to Iran (Oct. 1971) 
featured an article entitled “The Scien- 
tific Legacy of Iran”, by Desmond 
Stewart, a British authority on Asian 
cultures, 
It says that one of the greatest 
legacies left by the Persians in the field 
of medicine is their conception of 
hospitals. This statement is not entirely 
correct. H.G. Wells, in The Outline of 
History, states that Asoka, Indian Bud- 
dhist Emperor, built hospitals both for 
man and animals in the 3rd century. 
There were courses in medicine in 
Buddhist centres of learning and the 
personal physician of the 4th century, 
patricidal King Ajasatta of Magadha 
(North India) sent him for higher studies 
in medicine to the Wickremasela Budd- 
hist University in Ghandara (N.W. India). 
Hospitals existed in Ceylon in the 
3rd century B.C. and Buddhist temple 
walls in Ceylon proudly depict a 2nd- 
century Singhalese physician-king oper- 
ating on an ulcer of a poisonous snake, 
after anaesthetizing it. These facts are 
recorded In the Maha-wansa — the great 
Chronicle of Ceylon. 
Therefore the earliest concept of 
hospitals may be the product of both 
Persian and Indo-Ceylonese influences, 
or the latter may have preceded the 
former as the incipient concept of 
hospitals may be due to Buddhistic 
inspiration, for the Buddha (6th century 
B.C.), while nursing a sick monk, called 
on his followers thus: “He who nurseth 
the sick nurseth me”. This is said to 
have influenced Buddhist kings to build 
hospitals in Buddhist Asia from the 3rd 
century B.C. 
Dr. Buddhadasa P. Kirthisinghe, 
Maha Bodhi Society of India and 
the World Fellowship of Buddhists 
New York, U.S.A. 
Desmond Stewart's reply: “The mod- 
ern hospital Is the lineal descendant,” 
I wrote, "of the Islamic ‘maristan’, 
seen by Crusaders in the Holy Land 
and visitors to Egypt. It derived from 
Persia." If | say that the present 
Queen of England is the lineal descen- 
dant of Queen Victoria, this does not 
mean that other ancestors may not 
include Charles | and even Williarn the 
Conqueror! Of course the Persians 
did not invent medicine, and | nowhere 
said that. 
Besides the Buddhist heritage there 
are two other ancestors of great impor- 
tance: Pharaonic Egypt, where opera- 
tions on the skull were carried out in 
very ancient times, and Pergamum in 
what is now Turkey. (I visited the great 
Aesculapium there some years back 
and was in particular struck by a room 
in which mentally sick patients were 
put at night and then whispered to down 
whispering shafts: an interesting antici- 
pation of Aldous Huxley's hypnopaedia.) 
But the Europeans were unable to 
contemplate the Aesculapium, the hos- 
pitals of Asoka or the clinics of the 
Pharaohs. What they did see were 
Islamic “maristans”, derived from Persia. 
Those “maristans” undoubtedly derived 
In part from Buddhist India and Ceylon. 
I made the point elsewhere In my essay 
Letters to the Editor  
that the Persians of the period in 
question were In touch with Indian 
thought. They knew Sanskrit. 
Persia's great contributions were very 
much due to her position at the cross- 
roads between the west and the very 
creative east. 
REALITIES OF APARTHEID 
Sir, 
In my view, the “Unesco Courier” 
should not have published the extracts 
from South Africa's apartheid laws 
(“Inequality before the law in South 
Africa”) In its Nov. 1971 issue. Why 
not give the people of South Africa 
time to change things, instead of publish- 
ing in your columns a text so far 
removed from reality, for example, as 
paragraph 3 of the section on Education: 
“A white man who spends a few hours 
each week in his own home teaching 
his African servants to read is guilty of

THE FIG-TREE OF THE RUINS 
Sir, 
Your colour photo “The fig-tree of 
the ruins reigns supreme at Angkor” 
("SOS Angkor", Dec. 1971) moved me 
to write the following: 
How often repeated are destruction and 
[waste, 
While foolsteps are echoing so softly in 
[space, 
Echoing footsteps in the process of time 
Are a message to seekers of archaolo- 
[gical finds. 
Each echo so silent, yet whispering the 
[way, 
Each empty footstep professing its day. 
in the absence of present—to the future 
[of now, 
Are recordings of movements and 
[moments outgrown, 
Sounds mocked by seasons of mutilated 
[time, 
Evidence smothered by centuries of grime. 
How often repeated are destruction and 
[waste, 
While footsteps are echoing so softly In 
[space.

RIDDLES OF MALTA'S 
PREHISTORY 
Sir, 
| was pleased to see the article on 
the "Venus figures” of Malta (Feb. 1972 
issue). The photographs are magnifi- 
cent, but the text reproduces an account 
which is no longer accepted by most 
prehistorians and | feel that your readers 
are entitled to up-to-date information. 
Most of the new information is derived 
from the excavations conducted by 
Dr. David Trump at the site of Skorba; 
it affects our understanding of both 
the culture sequence and the absolute 
chronology of Maltese prehistory. 
 
  
The culture sequence. The excavation 
at Skorba established stratigraphically 
that the Zebbug phase was earlier than 
the Mgarr phase and not later, as had 
formerly been thought. It also produced 
evidence for two previously unknown 
phases between Ghar Dalam and 
Zebbug, which Dr. Trump has called 
Grey Skorba and Red Skorba. . 
Absolute chronology. There is some 
confusion in the article about the abso- 
lute chronology of the Maltese sequen- 
ce. In fact this has been fairly well 
established by a series of ten C14 
(radiocarbon) dates—seven from Skor- 
ba, one from Mgarr and two from Tar- 
xien—of which eight form a consistent 
sequence and two are anomalous. 
The C14 chronology suggests that the 
first phase (Ghar Dalam) should be 
dated ¢.4200-3800 B.C. (not 2500-2100 
B.C., as quoted by Mr. Almasy) and in 
fact the latest phase of the temple 
period (Tarxien) has a date c.2400 B.C. 
Moreover, even this chronology now 
seems too short, since recent work has 
shown that the C14 time scale diverges 
from the real time scale (calculated by 
counting the tree-rings of the enormously 
long-lived bristlecone pine, Pinus Aris- 
tata) by varying amounts at different 
periods. A calibration scale has been 
prepared for C14 dates back to ¢.4500 
B.C, so it is possible to calculate 
approximately the real date in calendar 
years represented by C14 dates within 
this range. 
The result for the Maltese sequence 
is startling: the first settlers seem to 
have arrived ¢.5000 B.C. and the temple 
building period was probably over before 
c.2500 B.C. In the light of this chron- 
ology, the Maltese temple culture 
appears not simply a remarkable devel- 
opment, but also an astonishingly pre- 
cocious one. Ruth D. Whitehouse

RACE AND l.Q. 
Sir, 
I have just finished reading Prof. 
Klineberg's article "Race and 1.Q.* in 
the Unesco Courier (Nov. 1971). It is 
a good piece, intelligently written and 
soundly based. | like it better than 
some of the recent writings on the same 
subject in other periodicals. | notice 
that the article contains examples from 
a number of peoples on this troubled 
earth of ours, but none about the Chi- 
nese, Koreans, lapanese, Indians, Cey- 
lonese, etc. Has no research been 
done by their scientists?

ANYTHING GOES 
 
Sir, 
The modern cultural climate seems 
not only to accept everything uncriti- 
cally, but to offer sometimes very high 
rewards to the mediocre. Music and 
singing seem, more than any other of 
the art forms, to be accepted without 
criticism. Singers with no voice, mouth- 
ing meaningless lyrics receive the adu- 
lation due to the trained singer of real 
talent.
