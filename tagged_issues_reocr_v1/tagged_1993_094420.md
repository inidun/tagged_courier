Tristes Tropiques 
1991, mixed media on paper box x 80 og 
by Léo Scalpel 
This work, which evokes the encounter between America and Europe in 1492, draws its unity L 
from an original synthesis of techniques and cultural references. On to a sheet of paper made 
in France using traditional methods the artist has glued a papyrus leaf from Egypt (at bottom 
left) and a sheet of gold leaf (top right). The image, which was computer-generated and 
printed by ink-jet, represents an Amazonian Indian from Brazil. The moonbeam at top left 
was spray-painted, and the splash of blue acrylic on the gold leaf recalls the blues of Yves 
Klein, a leading figure in 20th-century Western art.

UMBERTO ECO 
INTERVIEW 
  
BM You are a semiologist. You study systems 
of signs. What relevance does semiology 
have for ordinary people? Can any prac- 
tical conclusions be drawn from work such 
as yours? 
—1 regard myself as a philosopher rather 
than a semiologist, but general semiotics 
could be said to have become the most 
important branch of philosophy. Semiolo- 
gists are perhaps more needed today than 
ever before. We are living at the end of a 
period of bipolarization; things seemed 
simpler before, inasmuch as semiologists 
from either of the two ideological camps 
appeared intent on analysing and criticizing 
the other’s system, whereas now so many 
cultures, so many languages and types of 
discourse are clamouring for attention, 
sometimes peacefully but sometimes by 
force of arms, that it seems to me more 
than ever necessary to compare and contrast 
the various communication systems or 
world-views. This is where semiology 
comes in. 1 am not so credulous as to think 
that semiology can bring peace to the 
world, or that the Republic of Philoso- 
phers could ever be established. But semi- 
otics can play a role in education and civics; 
it can, for instance, inculcate a certain sense 
of relativity, of diversity and tolerance. 
Work needs to be done among the 
young, from a very early age, three or four 
onwards, if only to teach them that there are 
different languages, so that they grasp the 
idea of diversity, to show them, for example, 
that in different languages there are many 
different names for a rabbit, and that those 
who call a rabbit by some other name are 
not necessarily barbarians. Since semiology 
is concerned with all cultural systems and 
not only languages, it could help to teach 
children that there are other ways of 
dressing, other eating habits, in other words 
different forms of ritual behaviour in dif- 
ferent societies, each of which 1s mean- 
ingful within a given society. 
That would be one way of teaching tol- 
erance and understanding. If future gener- 
ations of children could look upon dif- 
ferent systems with the same tolerance as 
semiologists, we would have made extra- 
ordinary progtess! 
Having said that, enabling people to 
understand each other better is not neces- 
sarily a panacea for the ills of the world. 
Aspirin does not cure all ailments, but there 
is no harm in sending some to places where 
there is an epidemic of malaria. 
I do not believe, either, that a shared lan- 
guage or culture necessarily means a broth- 
erhood of man: some of the worst con- 
flicts of the last 200 years have been civil 
wars between people speaking the same 
language. 
WM Nevertheless, the mere idea of 4 certain 
cultural relativism unfailingly stirs up con- 
troversy, Where do you stand in the debate 
that, rightly or wrongly, sets “cultural rel- 
ativism” against “universalism”? 
—Cultural relativism argues that our 
understanding of the world takes various

forms, from language to religion, and that 
they lack a common basis of comparison. 
Taking this argument to extremes, one 
would have to conclude, for example, that 
there was no possible way of translating 2 
concept expressed in the language of Hopi 
Indians into English, or vice versa. That 
would be absolute cultural relativism. As 
Thomas Kuhn said about scientific para- 
digms, they may be incompatible but that 
does not mean they cannot be compared 
one with another. The Ptolemaic and 
Copernican systems are indeed incompat- 
ible, but it is possible to compare them, to 
show their complete independence of one 
another, but also to understand how the 
transition from one to the other came 
about. The concepts of Moon or Earth are 
not totally different in the two systems, 
even though the two systems had different 
ideas about their movements. The semio- 
logical approach, that of cultural anthro- 
Semiotics can 
inculcate a certain 
sense of relativity, 
of diversity and 
tolerance. 
pology or any other approach that pays 
heed to the diversity of cultures proceeds by 
comparison. It looks for points where com- 
parisons can be made; it does not shut sys- 
tems off in totally different compartments, 
but seeks out common ground between 
them, and if it does not find any it respects 
their differences. In my view there is no 
unresolvable contradiction between cul- 
tural relativism and universalism. 
To take another example, different lan- 
guages employ different categories to sig- 
nify even such simple things as wood. Eng- 
lish may use the word “timber” to 
distinguish the construction material from 
“wood” in the sense of woodland, but 
French uses the same word “bois” in both 
senses. Translation is possible all the same; 
it bases itself on the possibility that two 
different languages have a meeting-point; it

{ 
is an operation whereby the target lan- 
guage tries to keep as much of the source 
language as possible and transpose it into its 
own terms. To translate from German into 
French, I need to know German and to 
grasp precisely where the two languages 
differ. In that sense, there is nothing more 
universal than translation. 
Holism—absolute cultural relativism— 
would have us conclude that translation is 
impossible, and that there is no way of 
enunciating atomic physics in a jungle lan- 
guage or of expressing the problems of 
jungle-dwellers in Western languages. 
A totally different mistake, but one of 
equal gravity, would be to think that in 
language there are such things as discover- 
able universals, and that the diversity of 
languages could thereby be reduced to a 
single language. If there are any universal 
categories, they are such distinctions or 
opposites as “up” and “down” or ideas 
connected with our bodies like those of 
being hungry or being full. There is no 
need to look much further to find how 
many things, including the concepts of 
good and evil, differ even between peoples 
that are relatively close to each other, but it 
is still possible to compare two concepts of 
good and evil and see what they have in 
common, 
We could take for our guidance the 
metaphor of translation as an image 
standing for a tolerant world outlook. In 
purely theoretical terms, translation should 
not be possible, and yet people do talk to 
one another and translate or interpret one 
another’s words. In the abstract, by 
sophistry, the impossibility of movement or 
anything else can be proved, but in real life 
people live and move about. 
To my way of thinking, an organization 
such as UNESCO should neither promote 
cultural diversity to the point where the 
cultures concerned can no longer compre- 
hend one another, nor claim to assert uni- 
versal values equally valid the world over. 
The essential thing is to bring cultures into 
contact. Any given culture is, generally 
speaking, capable of “translating” another 
into its own terms. Even if there are bound 
to be inaccuracies, mistakes and distor- 
tions, it is better than total ignorance. 
The same goes even for closely related 
languages like Italian and Spanish. All Ital- 
ians think they can more or less under- 
stand Spanish and vice versa, but there are 
misleading cognates in the two languages, 
expressions that look alike but mean the 
opposite of each other. Although this means 
one has to be on the lookout for possible 
mistakes and misunderstanding, it does 
not, in practice, stop an Italian and a 
Spaniard understanding one another rea- 
sonably well. 
B Understanding each other or under- 
standing the diversity of cultures is one 
thing, but making value judgements is 
something else. Isn’t there some point at 
which, even if one has grasped the idea 
that concepts of good and evil vary from 
system to system, one has to exercise one’s 
own judgement as to good and evil? 
—This is one of the most serious prob- 
lems. Somebody once asked me if I looked 
at such problems through the eyes of a 
sociologist or of a moralist. My normal 
answer is that if I have to study a culture 
where cannibalism is practised, I do so with 
a sociologist’ eye, trying to understand 
how it is that this culture views cannibalism 
with approval, but as regards my own con- 
duct, the moralist in me tells me that eating 
people is wrong. The problem arises when 
cultures come into contact. Suppose that 
some lost jungle tribe of cannibals emi- 
grated to this country. Should we, out of 
respect for their culture, allow them to 
practise cannibalism here or should we 
forbid it because it is against the law here? 
Situations like these have to be solved on

### 94407: Interview: Umberto Eco

a case-by-case basis, by deciding where to set 
the limits of toleration. If a certain culture 
requires girls to wear the chador, I see no 
reason to forbid it, since it does not violate 
my own ethical principles. If a culture, as 
happens with certain religious sects, bans 
blood transfusions for sick children, there 
starts to be a problem because the law in this 
country says one must help a person in 
danger. Cannibalism should be banned 
because it violates our value system; we 
have to tell the cannibal, “If you come here 
you have to comply with certain rules.” 
Limits to what is tolerable have to be set, but 
there are things that are truly “intolerable” —
racism, cannibalism, murder and so on. 
I obviously cannot tolerate human sac- 
rifice being practised in my own country, 
but if I am told to go and invade or colonize 
a country to stop it being practised there I 
find myself in a predicament. The justifi- 
cation given for colonialism was this idea 
that we should go to other people’s coun- 
tries and “teach them right from wrong”. 
Problems like these have to be solved 
case by case, and are often harrowing, In 
Italy, for instance, one such question has 
arisen over population groups that practise 
ritual infibulation. When they come to our 
country, a difficulty arises because we con- 
sider infibulation an intolerable practice. 
Some people have suggested there could 
be special clinics where the infibulation 
required by their customs could be carried 
out. For myself, I consider infibulation to 
border on the intolerable. But where is the 
  
borderline between tolerable and intoler- 
able? That is the really difficult question. 
There can be no hard-and-fast answer, 
otherwise we would end up invading the 
whole world from pole to pole just because 
such and such a group might have customs 
that are unacceptable by our standards. 
These are questions that have to be dealt 
with, sometimes painfully, case by case. 
WB We have seen that “cultural relativism” 
is a controversial subject, but there is 
another controversy, almost its mirror 
image, over a certain form of “global cul- 
ture” or “mass culture” disseminated by 
the media and the so-called “cultural indus- 
tries”. It has long been criticized by various 
intellectuals, but your views are, are they 
not, more optimistic than the opinions of 
those you have dubbed “apocalyptic”? 
—As long ago as the 1960s I criticized intel- 
lectuals who reject mass culture from the 
outside without taking the trouble to look 
into it, and I stressed that we could make 
positive use of these mass media. I am rather 
more pessimistic now than I was then, 
because anyone can see, for example, how 
the ratings war has brought television pro- 
grammes down to their lowest common 
denominator in terms of quality; but this is 
like acknowledging that translation is pos- 
sible and then ignoring the reality that 80 per 
cent of translations are appalling because 
they have been done in a hurry, because 
translators are badly paid and so on. 
Let’s not forget that mass culture can 
also mean the use of new technologies for 
distance education at university level. We 
tend to equate mass culture with its most 
obvious, most commercial outlets such as

The function of poets, 
thinkers and philosophers is

think about it. 
some forms of television; but mass culture 
also represents an opportunity for easier 
access to culture and education, through 
diskettes, CD-ROM and suchlike, so why 
not imagine UNESCO helping to set up a 
vast mass communication system using radio 
and television for educational purposes? 
The main burden of my criticism in the 
1950s and 1960s remains valid to the extent 
that the intellectual community still in many 
cases protests about the negative aspects of 
mass culture without really involving itself 
in an effort to correct them. You still find 
people who say that we live in a civilization 
of the image and that the printed word is on 
its way out. That is wrong: mass culture 
has resulted in an increase in the output of 
printed matter and has given a boost to the 
reading habit. 
Some “apocalyptic” views are uncalled 
for, but that does not prevent our observing 
that television and the press are caught ina 
downward commercial spiral of sensation- 
alism, making up bogus news items and 
engineering sensational happenings. Mass 
culture has, however, also taught children to 
show greater respect for trees and has helped 
to create greater environmental awareness. 
There are positive sides to what the 
media are doing, the growing awareness of 
the nuclear threat for instance. I remember 
that when we were trying to carry out anti- 
nuclear propaganda in the 1960s with 
demonstrations, books and so on, people 
turned a deaf ear. They didn’t even know 
what radioactivity was and didn’t want to 
know. Thirty years on, thanks to films, tele- 
vision and the press, they all have a better 
understanding of the nuclear menace. It is 
through the mass media that people in some 
countries have gained a better idea of the 
dangers of pollution. 
Both aspects have to be looked at: tele- 
vision can be conducive to extremes of vul- 
garity, abuse, inanity and so forth, but at the 
same time it can raise public awareness of 
atmospheric pollution, soften up resistance 
to traffic control measures, for instance, 
or persuade people to be careful how they 
dispose of rubbish. These are realities that 
must be faced, in the knowledge that some 
new technology may be invented 
tomorrow that may change the nature of 
communications. 
That said, some innovations that started 
out positive may have become negative. 
Mass car ownership seemed a good thing at 
first but now road traffic needs to be kept 
in check. What is needed is to avoid any 
preconceptions while remaining vigilant. 
BW Why are intellectuals more and more 
often called on to show the way? 
—In a sense, this has been the case for thou- 
sands of years, since societies have always 
needed to assign to certain of their mem- 
bers, priests or philosophers for example, 
the role of discussing values. 
Itis possible, in the abstract, to imagine 
aworld in which each individual is by turns 
a hunter, a fisherman, a thinker and so on, 
but for the time being, as long as society is 
made up of people most of whom cannot 
devote themselves to this question of values, 
there have to be “Indian reservations” 
where society continues to support people 
whom it requires to fulfil this role. The 
problem is that they need to be regarded 
not as oracles but as channels through 
which the discussion about values gets to 
the others. This is the function of poets, 
thinkers and philosophers, to be attentive 
to what is going on and bring it to other 
peoples attention so that they in turn can 
think about it. This role we assign to intel- 
lectuals is, I think, almost a physiological 
function that the body politic cannot do 
without. Regarding intellectuals as oracles, 
on the other hand, is more like a social dis- 
ease. Here again it is a question of moder- 
ation. As far as I am concerned, I do not 
regard it as any part of my mission to be 
consulted as an oracle, which is why I avoid

### 94673: Minorities; editorial by Federico Mayor

Editorial by Federico Mayor 
HAT 1s a minority? Does a group become a minority simply by virtue of regarding itself 
as one? Can any and every minority invoke the right to self-determination? Is it con- 
ceivable that the map of the world could ever be redrawn to conform with ethnic cri- 
teria? Are there any general principles for ensuring peaceful coexistence between majorities and 
minorities? These are some of the questions raised in the following pages, in an issue of the 
UNEscO Courier which does not claim to be an exhaustive treatment of the problem but an 
attempt to investigate its complexity. For myself, I should particularly like to emphasize the 
worldwide dimension of this question, because it throws light both on its most topical aspects and 
on conditions for a long-term solution. 
The context in which the issue of minorities arises today is indeed very closely related to the gen- 
eral characteristics of the age. It is no longer a context of sealed frontiers and isolated regions but 
one of an integrated global system in which the links of interdependence in finance, technology and 
communications are growing closer each day. Political, industrial or military decisions made at one 
end of the world very rapidly have an impact at the other. Because of the scale of production units 
and the pressures of international competition, regional economic groupings are imposing increasing 
constraints upon individual countries, to the detriment of their national preferences. Certain role 
models, symbols and tastes in clothing and food are being propagated worldwide by the mass media. 
As a reaction against this trend towards globalization—which is accompanied by growing inequal- 
ities between the different world regions—people everywhere are seeking to defend themselves against 
encroaching uniformity and dehumanization. Individuals and communities alike are thereby 
voicing their desire to exist, to use their powers of creation, to play an active part in national and 
international life. Where there is no peaceful and democratic context in which these aspirations can 
find an effective outlet, extremist, demagogic, xenophobic and even racist ideas begin to spread, trans- 
forming the legitimate desire to affirm identity into an aggressive attitude, tending towards isola- 
tionism and exclusion and accompanied by a rejection of universal values, disregard for the rights 
and liberties of the person, and a refusal to seek common ground or to teach the values of tolerance. 
The problem of minorities today is a specific instance of this general phenomenon: the global- 
ization not only of economic networks but also of humanist values means that no feasible solution 
can be based on the establishinent of ethnic, national or religious frontiers. Minorities—whether 
they be cultural communities within a nation or entire regions confronting a centre of industrially 
developed power—are destined to achieve fulfilment as part of a general democratization of public 
life, both within each state and worldwide. 
The lives of peoples, large and small, today come within the scope of a balance that needs to be 
established between rights and duties in relation to humankind as a whole, but this balance will only 
be accepted by all if it commands the allegiance of all, and this in turn presupposes absolute 
respect for the freedom and dignity of minorities—failure to respect them has so often been the jus- 
tification for breakaway movements. 
Culture is clearly a crucial area of self-fulfilment, the realm in which the particular genius of a 
people or an individual finds freest expression—provided, however, that it is something other than 
a memory of the past, looking back towards a mythical identity, provided that it becomes a 
memory looking towards the future, receptive to others, deriving continual, never-ending enrich- 
ment from inner and outer sources. 
Minorities and majorities alike, we are all called upon to choose between competing pasts and 
a common future, between withdrawal into old totalitarian modes that stifle the individual and tear 
the world apart, and the challenge of freedom for each and every one of us, the challenge of a human 
race finally reconciled with itself. no

### 94408: What is a minority?

WHAT IS 
A 
MINORITY? 
by Deirdre Meintel 
Applied to society, 
the concept of a 
minority is not 
necessarily 
numerical. Social 
and historical 
factors shape a 
group’s 
consciousness of 
minority status 
to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth 
century, when the new or changing political 
boundaries of European nation-states subjected 
certain ethnic groups to the domination of other 
ethnic or national groups. Probably the most 
influential definition of the concept of “minority” 
is that first proposed in 1945 by the sociologist 
Louis Wirth, who wrote: “We may define a 
minority as a group of people who, because of 
their physical or cultural characteristics, are sin- 
gled out from the others in the society in which 
they live for differential and unequal treatment 
and who therefore regard themselves as objects of 
collective discrimination.” 
By Wirth’s definition, the existence of a 
minority implies that a corresponding majority 
group enjoys higher status and greater privileges; 
those holding minority status are excluded from 
full participation and are treated as, and consider 
themselves to be, “a people apart”. To summarize, 
members of a minority group are “identifiably 
different”, that is, characterized by observable 
traits that distinguish them from others in the 
same society; subject to differential treatment 
from others; and conscious of the discrimina- 
tion they experience as members of the group. 
The anthropologists Charles Wagley and 
Marvin Harris have proposed several modifica- 
tions to Wirth’s definition. Minority status, in 
their view, is inherited according to the descent 
rules of a society, in such a way that an indi- 
vidual is assigned to the minority group even 
when he or she does not manifest the minority’s 
visible traits. For example, in the American racial 
system, having any known African-American 
I N the West, the issue of minorities goes back 
ancestry has usually been sufficient to place an 
individual in the “Black” or “Negro” category. 
Minority status is thus something one is “born 
into”, rather than something acquired later in 
life. Wagley and Harris also consider that minori- 
ties are generally endogamous, since they are 
normally prohibited from marrying into the 
dominant group. Such prohibitions have the 
effect of maintaining the boundaries between 
majority and minority, and by extension perpet- 
uating the privileges of the majority. Note that 
what is at issue is not sexual contact between the 
two groups but rather descent and inheritance. 
Endogamy (marrying within one’s own group) 
ensures that majority status is passed only to the 
legitimate children of majority members and so 
remains inaccessible to anyone not of that group. 
While Wagley and Harris’ formulation would 
apply well to many situations of majority- 
minority relations, it is far from universal in 
application. For one thing, their criterion of 
“endogamy” requires some qualification in the 
light of later research. While it is true that 
endogamy of the elite, privileged group serves to 
maintain its boundaries, minorities often marry 
into other minorities. In fact “intermarriage” 
between ethnic groups in the contemporary 
United States often concerns partners of dif- 
ferent minority groups. More importantly, recent 
years have seen the emergence of many groups 
that see themselves as minorities and organize 
themselves as such but do not meet the criterion 
of inherited status or endogamy. We shall return 
later to the issue of whether, for example, women 
or homosexuals can properly be considered 
minorities.

More recent writers have given greater 
emphasis than did Wirth to the political domi- 
nation exercised by the majority group. Itis the 
greater access to and control of resources—access 
to health care, jobs, food, education, wealth—that 
allows one group to control the life chances of 
another. Put another way, it is the greater polit- 
ical power of the majority that allows it to dis- 
criminate against the minority, to treat its mem- 
bers in detrimental ways that may range from 
stereotyping to extermination. 
IDENTIFIABILITY 
Wirth’s criterion of “identifiability” also requires

inant group to attribute a minority’s inferior 
status to its unique characteristics rather than to 
its structural position. This is the process known 
as “blaming the victim”. This may be done, not 
only in regard to what are conventionally seen as 
racial groupings, but also in regard to religious 
minorities, homosexuals and others. Other 
writers have drawn attention to modern forms of 
racism whereby “culture” is invoked in so essen- 
tialist a fashion (see below) as to constitute a 
“second nature”. Immigrants, for example, may 
be discriminated against on the grounds of their 
culture. In such instances, the norms, values, 
beliefs and practices attributed to them are seen 
as the basis of their essential difference from and 
inferiority to majority members.

DEIRDRE MEINTEL 
is a Canadian anthropologist 
who teaches at the University 
of Montreal. She has carried 
out research in the Cape 
Verde islands, among Cape- 
Verdean Americans in New 
England and among immigrant 
groups in Montreal. In recent 
years her research has focused 
on social identity and on family 
relationships in migrant 
groups. 
 
The quality of “identifiability” is an espe- 
cially pertinent issue at present, given that in 
North America, at least, one hears much of “vis- 
ible minorities” in public discourse. The differ- 
ences thought to be “visible” are in reality those 
considered socially significant. Thus a North 
African may be highly visible in Paris, yet less so 
in Montreal or New York. 
In other words, identifiably “different” char- 
acteristics do not so much explain power differ- 
entials as legitimize them and facilitate their exer- 
cise. Furthermore, identifiability is not always 
supplied by the minority itself. Jews, for example, 
were required to wear a yellow star in Nazi Ger- 
many precisely because their supposed “differ- 
ence” from the rest of the population might oth- 
erwise have remained invisible, giving the lie, 
one might add, to the grotesque representations 
of Jews to be found in the Nazi-controlled press 
and cinema. In other cases, as we shall see, making 
oneself identifiable as a minority group member 
is part of developing minority consciousness. 
(EE NEN NENENNENNERENNNNLHN] 
“NEW” MINORITIES 
This brings us to the question of what might be 
called “new” minorities. Recent years have seen 
increased political consciousness among, and in 
some cases mobilization of, other types of groups 
who see themselves as minorities that have been 
subject to discrimination. Women, for example, 
would seem to fit Wirth’s definition of 2a minority 
quite well: they are visibly different, subject to dis- 
crimination of various sorts and in recent decades 
have been conscious of being discriminated 
against because of being women. Yet it was only 
in the 1970s that sociologists began to see 
women’s status as separate from that of the men 
to whom they were attached and the position of 
women as an issue for the study of social hier- 
archy and stratification. Indeed, women’s dif- 
ferential access to wealth, prestige, health care 
and in some societies even food, all go to show 
that, as Rosalind Dworkin put it in the title of an 
article on women as a minority group, “Numbers 
do not a minority make”. 
Homosexuals are another such “new 
minority”, insofar as they have developed a group 
awareness of suffering differential treatment 
because of their sexual orientation. In this case, 
identifiability is of special concern. Many gays and 
lesbians associate raised consciousness of social 
injustice toward homosexuals with “coming out”, 
that is, making their sexual orientation public. In 
the United States, “outing”, or making public 
the homosexuality of individuals in public life, 1s 
a strategy favoured by some gays, though it has 
been more often threatened than actually put 
into practice. 
Another social category that might be seen as 
a minority, at least in some cases, is the elderly. 
Age-based discrimination in hiring, forced retire- 
ment and other issues of common concern have 
mobilized group consciousness in North America 
and Western Europe, where modern capitalism 
has been associated with devalued status for older 
persons. Examples of political mobilization 
include the “Grey Panther” organization in the 
United States; in Italy, old-age pensioners have 
been known to organize political demonstra- 
tions in recent years. The deaf offer yet another

example of a social category thatis currently in the 
process of mobilizing as a minority. 
There are many contemporary instances of 
highly diverse categories of disadvantaged people 
being treated as homogeneous groupings char- 
acterized by inferior moral characteristics. Etienne 
Balibar, for instance, holds that the category 
“immugration” (or “immigrants”) now functions 
as a substitute for the notion of race. In Canada 
one often hears generalizations whereby refugees 
are presented as particularly undesirable immi- 
  
grants, as “queue jumpers”, perpetrators of “wel- 
fare frauds” and so on. Several years ago, a nation- 
wide television broadcast in the United States 
showed through brief interviews with passers-by 
that “the homeless” are often perceived as a 
homogeneous grouping, one composed of moral 
undesirables who are themselves to blame for 
their circumstances. If such stereotyping were 
to go on for many years, it is quite possible that 
these social categories too might develop minority 
group consciousness. 
MINORITY CONSCIOUSNESS 
The above examples make it clear that minority 
formation is a social and historical process. One 
of the key elements in it is the development of 
consciousness among those concerned that they 
are subject to a common discrimination as mem- 
bers of a given category. Thus what might appear 
as simple social aggregates in one historical period 
become politically conscious minorities in 
another. 
As mentioned earlier, the stereotypes applied 
to minorities are generally “essentialist” in char- 
acter; that is, they refer to differences supposed to 
be either biological or cultural, but in any case pri- 
mordial, fundamental and little amenable to 
change. At the same time, minority group mem- 
bers may themselves adopt an “essentialist” dis- 
course whereby their characteristics are seen as 
intrinsically different from those of the majority; 
certain manifestations of negritude, on the one 
hand, and feminism, on the other, might be viewed 
in this light. In a context of persecution or dis- 
crimination, it is likely that minority members 
themselves will be led to experience whatever 
defines them as “different” as the key element, per- 
haps the only pertinent one, in their social identity. 
However, it is our belief that minority con- 
sciousness does not necessarily lead to a narrow 
concern with one set of issues, and with one 
aspect of social identity, but rather can become the 
basis of wider solidarities with other groupings 
who have experienced similar treatment. In the 
case of ethnic minorities, such solidarities may 
take the form of transethnic affiliations between 
groups on the basis of cultural similarities, shared 
minority status and/or common experiences of 
discrimination. In the words of Albert Memmi, 
“The oppressed all resemble each other; the Col- 
onized, the Jew, the Poor, the Woman. . .. The 
same suffering often calls forth the same reac- 
tions.” It is not popular in our times to assert such 
solidarities, yet in a historical period marked by 
ever-increasing minority consciousness, expressed 
on ever more narrow bases of affiliation, to the 
point of becoming a kind of collective individu- 
alism, such solidarities may be our best hope for 
creating human community. ||

### 94409: Identity: a card with two faces

IDENTITY— 
A CARD WITH 
TWO FA( 
  
ES 
by Mauro Peressini 
A hard look 
at the concept of 
group identity 
and its impact, 
for better or 
worse, on today’s 
world 
looking at the current upsurge in demands 
for the recognition of cultural, religious, 
ethnic, racial or national identities. 
On the positive side, the efforts by certain 
population groups to assert their identity can be 
regarded as “liberation movements”, as strategies 
for challenging oppression and injustice. What 
these groups are doing—proclaiming that they are 
different, rediscovering the roots of their cul- 
ture, strengthening group solidarity or aspiring to 
political self-determination—may accordingly 
be seen as necessary and legitimate attempts to 
escape from their state of subjugation and enjoy 
a certain measure of dignity. 
On the down side, however, involvement in 
militant action for recognition tends to make 
such groups more deeply entrenched in their 
attitudes and to make the cultural compartments 
into which they are divided even more watertight. 
The assertion of identity then starts to turn into 
self-absorption and isolation, and is liable at any 
time to slide into intolerance of others and 
towards ideas of ethnic “cleansing” and xeno- 
phobia, racism and violence. 
T HERE are, to my mind, two ways of 
CHANGE AS A CONSTANT 
OF CULTURE 
The main feature of human societies and their 
cultures has always been not that they have stood 
still but that they have been responsive to change. 
Instances of isolated societies that have remained 
unaffected by historical events are exceptions, if 
notindeed myths, and such societies have seldom 
prospered. 
Almost all societies have, in one way or 
another, been caught up in history, whether 
through natural phenomena (disasters or climatic 
or environmental changes), migratory move- 
ments (emigration, immigration, the meeting and 
intermingling of peoples, or the dissemination of 
knowledge, beliefs and values), political events 
(wars and annexations) or economic factors (trade 
 
and the spread of technology), and have con- 
stantly needed to redefine and change them- 
selves, invent, generate ideas, borrow and acquire, 
and devise new ways of acting and thinking. 
Far from representing an unchanging set of 
ways of acting and thinking or a finite body of 
knowledge, beliefs, values, traditions or rules, 
standards or principles, culture is a living thing, a 
process involving communication and cross-fer- 
tilization. It is therefore an exaggeration to talk 
about the danger of “losing” a culture and about 
the need to “retrieve”, “protect”, “safeguard” or 
“cleanse” it. Since culture is a continuing process 
of change, acculturation is its mode of existence. 
It is because of this constant reshaping of cul- 
ture by history that a cultural, ethnic, racial or 
national group is never a uniform entity but 
breaks down instead into different cultural sub- 
units that are themselves continually undergoing 
change, such as families and kinship groups; vil- 
lages, towns and regional groupings; social classes, 
occupational groups, blue-collar and white-collar 
workers, managers and bosses; generations, 
young people and old; men and women; or the 
mentally or physically handicapped. 
Thus, although the fact of being different is at 
the heart of every group’s identity, on the other 
hand every group contains individuals who share . 
many points of resemblance with people in other 
groups. According to the cultural aspect on which 
emphasis is placed (religion, culinary habits, 
dress, language etc.), groups shift frontiers and 
overlap, the limits become more blurred, and 
distinctions between one’s own and others’ iden- 
tity become a matter of degree or of place in the 
same continuum. 
Governed by their own hybrid logics,! the cul- 
tures of all groups are much more like a mobile 
and open-ended assemblage of many differing

P0000 SOOO SOPOPIPORIROINTODS 
A SIMPLIFYING FICTION 
Ata time of continual changes in ways of acting 
and thinking, collective identities provide indi- 
viduals with a means of simplifying reality. 
This simplification works firstly by trans- 
forming the whole set of individuals composing 
the group (cultural minority, ethnic group, race or 
nation) into a uniform and distinct entity, so that 
the group can be represented as an obvious enspir- 
ical reality. The uniformity of the group is ensured 
by the selection of a limited number of features 
both as being typical of the individuals forming the 
group and as being more important than other fea- 
tures in terms of the definition of their identity. 
Whereas an objective observer analysing a 
given population would find an infinite number of 
possible criteria for describing, grouping together 
or distinguishing between the individuals being 
observed, those militating for recognition of their 
group’s identity arbitrarily choose a limited 
number of criteria, such as language, skin colour 
or religion, so that group members recognize 
themselves primarily in terms of the labels attached 
to the group whose existence is being asserted, 
“black”, “white”, “Arab”, “Muslim”, “Jewish”, 
“Christian”, “Hindu”, “French”, “Italian” or 
whatever. 
The distinction between the group in question 
and other groups is established by simplifying 
the features selected. Whereas the same objective 
observer could see only continuous vartations 
for each criterion, and would thus be prevented 
from drawing clear dividing-lines between the 
groups, those militating for recognition of their 
identity simplify each criterion by eliminating the 
variations they regard as secondary and are thus 
able to speak, for example, of 2 national lan- 
guage, of “whites” and “blacks”, or of the Islamic 
or Jewish faith. 
Simplification also works by transforming 
groups into essences, abstractions endowed with 
the capacity to remain unchanged through time. 
The cultural minority, ethnic group, race or nation 
concerned is thus seen as being outside of time, 
while change and the effects of history are denied 
or underestimated. In some cases, people actu- 
ally act as though the group had remained 
unchanged and talk, for example, about the history 
of the “French”, the “blacks” or the “Jewish 
people”, as if those entities had survived for cen- 
turies without changing, as if the “French”, the 
“blacks” or the “Jews” of two or five or ten cen- 
turies ago were the same people as today, using the 
same tools and techniques and with the same ways 
of acting and thinking, the same desires, aspirations, 
anxieties and pleasures. 
In other instances, although the changes 
wrought by history are acknowledged, the deep- 
rooted identity of the group is still not questioned. 
The group is seen metaphorically as an edifice 
that has been collectively shaped and built up 
over the centuries, or else as a living individual who 
is born and develops. It is when the concepts 
enshrined in the words “patrimony” or “her- 
itage” are looked at in the context of the metaphor 
of “work under construction” that they really 
become meaningful: objects, knowledge, beliefs, 
values and traditions all represent building-blocks 
for the collective edifice which have to be carefully 
stockpiled and must not be lost or destroyed. Its 
likewise in the context of the metaphor of the 
“individual” that the concept of the “collective 
memory” can be understood: cultures, ethnic 
groups or nations are credited with the faculty of 
memory and are spoken of as though they were 
human beings (who can be “humiliated” or 
“betrayed” or “avenged ”). When people are forced 
to acknowledge the far-reaching changes that his- 
tory has wrought and when they admit that the 
identity of the group may no longer be what it was, 
the present state of the group often comes to be 
seen as one of “sickness”. People then start looking 
back on some period in the past as having been the 
time when the group possessed a now tarnished 
“purity” or anow lost “authenticity”. The past— 
although it was the present for the people living at 
the time—is regarded as an unchanging state, a 
baseline to be turned to—as one turns to a 
remedy—in order to rediscover and re-establish 
the truth about the group, or its essence. 
Cultural, ethnic, racial or national identities 
are fictions that simplify social realities, and they 
have practical effects, two negative aspects of 
which I wish particularly to stress. 15

### 94409: Identity: a card with two faces

Firstly, they gloss over and disparage the pre- 
sent and contemporary history. Changes in ways 
of acting and thinking, contacts between peo- 
ples, the patterns of exchanges and intermin- 
glings of which both present and past are 
formed—all these are often discussed in such 
negative terms as the “contamination” of cul- 
tures, the “expansion” of modern Western cul- 
ture, world-wide “uniformity” and the “disap- 
pearance” of human diversity. Some aspects of 
recent history show there to be an element of 
truth in these judgements, but to leave things at 
that would be to run the risk of failing to see 
what is being created afresh in the crucible of 
the present. It could be argued, moreover, that a 
disparaging attitude to the present day and con- 
temporary history is tantamount to contempt 
for the lives, efforts, aspirations and desires of mil- 
lions of men and women who are, after all, coping 
as best they can with the unstable, ill-assorted raw 
materials that history has handed down to them. 
Who is to say that they are on the wrong track 
and that their cultures are not authentic? What 
right or authority has anyone to say so? 
Secondly, the way in which groups are indi- 
vidualized or personalized in the name of iden- 
tity has negative effects similar to those of the 
individualism that is creating havoc in the indus- 
trialized societies of the West. It is individualism 
raised to the group level. As a result, the only 
legitimate principle of behaviour that such groups 
recognize 1s the satisfaction of their own self- 
interest, which lies in maximizing their economic 
and political profits and in selfishly devising 
schemes for development and expansion without 
regard for other people. 
Such group individualism ends up with all 
groups fighting and competing against one 
another, and leads on to the logical consequence 
of all individualism, i.e. there can only be “win- 
ners” if there are also “losers”—cultural minori- 
ties, ethnic groups or nations that cannot fend for 
themselves, cannot have their own territories or 
form their own states.

IDENTITY AS A COGNITIVE 
NECESSITY 
Paradoxically, however, it is precisely because 
identity represents a simplifying fiction, creating 
uniform groups out of disparates, drawing border 
lines across a continuum and turning groups into 
unchanging essences, that it is necessary and 
indeed essential to the agents of social change. 
Although it is a factor of division, it is also a 
factor of vision? Like the concepts we use to put 
names to things and designate ideas, identity cat- 
egories make it possible for us to understand and 
grasp reality. In a constantly changing world, 
they enable us to put names to ourselves and to 
others, form some idea of who we are and who

occupy along with other people in the world

the members of a particular group (x is an X 
because he or she acts or thinks in such-and- 
such a way), identity provides the framework 
for interpreting, predicting or managing our 
behaviour or that of other people (x is bound to 
do this because he or she is an X). 
The current upsurge in efforts to assert the 
identity of various groups can, in fact, be partly 
explained by the cognitive function performed by 
identity. Naturally, many of these movements can 
be explained in terms of a tangle of economic and 
political factors combining the faceless logic of the 
international system and the special interests of 
small groups and individuals who look upon cul- 
tures, ethnic groups, races or nations only as means 
to achieve other ends and to manipulate people. 
That being said, people would not go along as 
they do, often in large numbers, with the propo- 
sitions put to them, in spite of the sacrifices they 
entail, if there were not a very strong feeling of 
need for identity, 2 need to “take stock of things”

reconciled? I propose to confine myself to a few 
lines of approach. 
The first of these relates to what I would call pt the mobility of identity. If any identity, whether 
it be cultural, ethnic or national, is to function 
properly—in other words, if its suggested con- 
figuration is to be acknowledged as real and legit- 
imate—it has to overlook or disregard the fact that 
all such configurations are arbitrary and could be 
drawn in many other possible ways. 
This means we must bear the arbitrary nature 
of identity constructs constantly in mind, not 
with a view to eliminating all forms of identifi- 
cation and affiliation—which would be unreal- 
istic, since identity is a cognitive necessity for 
human beings—but simply so as to remind our- 
selves that we each have several identities at the 
same time. 
The realization that we all have several iden- 
tittes whereby to define ourselves has its uses.

cobbling together of new ways of acting and 
thinking, fresh and original combinations of ele- 
ments, and counter-cultures. 
In this respect, the Third World sets an 
example. There are, for example, a large number 
of syncretic cults, such as “Kimbanguism” in 
Congo and voodoo in Benin, Haiti, Cuba and 
Brazil, in which Christian rites and modern ele- 
ments are blended with traditional values or 
Christian saints are identified with pagan divini- 
ties. Similarly, the galloping urban growth thata 
number of countries are undergoing gives rise, in 
the Third World, not only to the kind of dehu- 
manization that is seen in the main cities of the 
industrialized countries but also to an upwelling 
of cultural and social creativity. In the pobla- 
ciones of Santiago, the favelas of Rio de Janeiro or 
the shantytowns of Mexico City and elsewhere, 
what 1s happening in many cases is the regener- 
ation of the social fabric through new principles 
of solidarity and new forms of social participation, 
such as self-managed micro-organizations, grass- 
roots economic organizations, religious com- 
munities, neighbourhood associations, young 
  
people’s and women’s movements, environmental 
groups and so on. As regards the economy too, 
informal-sector activities are springing up all 
over the place through a mixture of resourceful- 
ness and ingenuity, based on ideas of produc- 
tion and consumption very different from those 
of the capitalist economy. 
All these examples, which have their coun- 
terparts in the most marginalized sectors of the 
industrialized countries (prisons, teenage gangs 
and also grassroots organizations), rather than 
representing the replacement of “traditional” 
cultures by a “Western-style culture”, actually tes- 
tify to the emergence of a new, third way that, ill- 
defined as it may be and arising under appalling 
conditions, nevertheless holds out hope for the 
future, indeed perhaps for the only possible 
future. 
Identities formulated in these terms deserve 
our attention. Far from being based on 
unchanging and exclusive membership rules, like 
those of blood ties, parentage or mythical origin, 
many of these identities are open-ended, in that 
there is a continual inflow and outflow of mem- 
bers, which prevents them from taking on a self- 
perpetuating existence of their own. This is true, 
for example, of identities based on places of res- 
idence, like neighbourhood associations, or those 
based on membership rules that are not handed 
down from one generation to the next but are 
defined by individuals themselves through the 
institutions they create. “Citizenship” is another 
form of identity which can be defined in the 
course of struggles directly related to current 
issues. A number of these identities also have 
the advantage of being tied to the present and 
being short-lived, of lasting for no longer than a 
particular plan or militant action may last, which 
prevents them from turning into hard and fast 
identities. 
Such identities, with their changing mem- 
berships and limited life-spans, give rise to com- 
munities which, vulnerable and unstable though 
they may be, possess, thanks to this precious 
“lightness of being”, the strength to maintain an 
enquiring and tolerant relationship with others 
and at the same time to counter the unhealthy self- 
absorption that is still so prevalent. [

### 94410: Communities at the crossroads

Reconciling 
societies and the 
groups that 
compose them 
must be a priority 
for modern 
democracy 
  
COMMUNITIES AT THE 
CROSSROADS 
Above, Basque separatists 
stage a demonstration in 
Guernica (1992). 
  
N the half-century following the Second 
| World War, the nation-state came to be 
regarded with approval by every political 
system and every ideology. In the name of mod- 
ernization in the West, of socialism in the countries 
of the Eastern bloc and of development in the 
Third World, it was expected to guarantee the 
happiness of individuals as citizens, and of peoples 
as societies. At a time of globalization and cultural 
secularization, it seemed inconceivable that vio- 
lence could again rear its head on the basis of 
community divisions, as it had in the past. 
Today the state appears to have broken down 
in many parts of the world. It has failed to guar- 
antee either security or social justice, and it has 
been unable to prevent either international wars 
or, to an even greater extent, civil wars like those 
now ravaging Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka and 
Somalia. In the past two decades, many states 
have, through short-sightedness or self-interest, 
been slow to respond to the new demands of 
underprivileged peripheral groups. 
In such situations people often respond by 
replacing their loyalty to the state with loyalty 
to a community. The community concerned 
may take one of many forms. It may be a family 
community of people who trace their genealogy 
back to a common ancestor, real or mythical; a 
by Elizabeth Picard 
local community—people living in the same 
valley, perhaps; a cultural community of peoples 
sharing the same customs, values and above all 
language; a racial community—a group con- 
vinced that it is physically different from those 
around it, despite the prevalence of ethnic inter- 
mingling; a religious community of members of 
the same sect or faith. 
At this point the community’s objective—to 
be prosperous, to be free, and to defend itself— 
enters into competition with that of the nation- 
state. If the state is stable and its institutions are 
legitimate, it will be in a position to negotiate 
with dissatisfied communities and to convert their 
demands into political interests. If it is authori- 
tarian, it will repress what it sees as insubordina- 
tion or a threat of secession. If it is weak, it will col- 
lapse in the turmoil of rivalries between 
communities. It may also be taken over by one of 
its constituent communities at the expense of the 
others. In that case, economic paralysis and for- 
eign intervention often intensify the internal crisis 
and hasten the transition to armed hostilities. 
As one observes the awakening of commu- 
nities in different parts of the world and sees 
how armed force is being used to decisive effect 
by small groups, one is bound to ask a number of 
questions. Do these new community loyalties

directed against the state not themselves reflect an 
aspiration to construct a state? Can such a state 
be viable, based as it must be on the principle of 
protective exclusion? What excesses may the 
logic of group uniformity lead to? Is there not a 
danger that the reaction, today so common, 
against the excessive uniformity of the nation- 
state may lead to a rejection of politics, under- 
stood as community management, in favour of 
widespread tribal warfare? 
SO GSSOOLOOIOIOIOIOIBSIOOSEOSIOSEOSTOOBSOES 
THE QUEST FOR SECURITY 
All over the world, retreat into the community- 
group is closely linked to the quest for security. 
“There can be no intensely felt sense of identity 
without some perception of danger,” writes the 
French philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff in La 
force du préjugé (1987). Since in the eyes of the 
community-group the state has lost what Max 
Weber called its monopoly of legitimate vio- 
lence, the only recognized form of security 
becomes that of the “armed tribe”. Arms flow in, 
sent by sympathetic groups, procured by external 
powers eager to acquire influence, or bought on 
a world market awash with weaponry. 
Amid the enthusiasm and emotion of collec- 
tive mobilization, volunteers form local militias 
which soon, because of the economic crisis, take 
on paid recruits for whom war is the only source 
of income, the only means of feeding their fam- 
ilies. On the fringe of the militias, local gangs 
take advantage of civil disorder to terrorize the 
population and hold it to ransom. The militias 
enforce their law on political parties and on civil 
society. Within each community warlords take the 
lead in mobilizing the group and are the main 
architects of the “invention” of its identity. 
Under their leadership, organizing the defence 
of the community becomes the cement that binds 
the community together. “We need a war to bring 
us together and give us a common identity,” said 
the leader of a proscribed Northern Ireland para- 
military group in 1992. The militia sets out to 
dominate a piece of territory and control access 
to it, then to make it homogeneous by forcing 
people to move out and by perpetrating mas- 
sacres. For if the horror of “ethnic cleansing” 
has reared its head again fifty years after the col- 
  
lapse of Nazism, obsession with the security of 
the community causes forced and massive exo- 
duses of groups whose rights within a given piece 
of territory are just as firmly based in history 
(or myth) as those of their persecutors. Attempts 
to preserve the security of the community by 
expulsions create a sense of injustice in another 
community nearby. 
The militia builds walls and barricades, trans- 


### 94410: Communities at the crossroads

forming zones of contact with other communi- 
ties into an impassable no-man’s-land. Direct 
contact and mixing between the different popu- 
lations come to an end and are replaced by ideo- 
logical relationships as communities are caught in 
the toils of mutually hostile propaganda. 
This process whereby militias, without any 
precise military or political objectives, turn their 
communities into fortresses has come to be 
known as Lebanonization, after the pointless 
and destructive conflicts that tore Lebanese 
society apart for more than fifteen years (1975- 
1990). Once the break with the other communi- 
ties has been made, the violence of the militias is 
soon turned on their own people. The prevailing 
view is that internal treason or defection is even 
more dangerous than the external threat. The 
militia will use all kinds of intimidation and coer- 
cion, from shows of force to taxation and con- 
scription, from admonition to kidnapping and 
murder, to repress any sign of deviation and any 
move towards co-operation between communi- 
ties or any questioning of the single-minded atti-- 
tude its power is based on. By stirring up fear and 
encouraging the community to retreat into itself, 
coercion replaces consensus as society’s motive 
force and takes the place of the law at the heart of 
the collective conscience. 
(ENE NNENNNENNENNENNNENNENNNNNNMNNNLHN/ 
INVENTING A COMMON IDENTITY 
Use of force is the hallmark of the process of 
community consolidation, but it is by no means its 
only characteristic. The group’s new leaders also 
go in for social engineering, creating public services 
and social support funds exclusively reserved for 
members of the community. The arms trade, often 
linked to drug trafficking, provides the militias 
with illicit funds to keep their supporters on their 
side. But it is principally by robbing the state 
(controlling customs receipts) or by taking its 
place (taxing business and trade and distributing 
necessities) that the militias acquire usurped legit- 
imacy in the eyes of the people. 
The warlords use terror and the redistribution 
of society’s wealth to begin a more ambitious 
and in the long term more revolutionary process, 
the definition of a specific identity for the group. 
They base this definition on some form of dif- 
ference, objective or subjective, which has hith- 
erto been no more important within the state 
than regional, professional or class distinctions. 
From now on, however, all these factors will

and crowd-manipulation techniques are set in 
motion. Young people are a particular target for 
the business of identity-construction. Several 
studies in Lebanon and Northern Ireland have 
shown how receptive they can be to the language 
used to construct a sectarian frame of mind and 
how they become increasingly indifferent to 
democratic values. If the frustrations of the com- 
munity generated the initial tensions, inter-com- 
munity warfare in its turn helps to sharpen the 
sense of difference, to increase the gap between 
groups and to make it impossible for them to 
coexist within a single state. 
But as the anthropologist Benedict Anderson 
has pointed out, a community that is “invented” 
in this way (in a dual sense of being both discov- 
ered and created) can never be other than an 
“imaginary community” that is essentially no 
more legitimate than the “national” community 
it rejects, from which it wants to secede or whose 
place it wishes to take. For the logic of commu- 
nity identity and security is ultimately national- 
istic; it seeks to establish a state for the commu- 


### 94410: Communities at the crossroads

nity. It is obvious that this logic, if it goes 
unchecked, must lead to a proliferation of ever- 
smaller states, since each sub-group in turn can 
invoke its own “distinctness”, in a process that 
ultimately ends up at the level of the individual 
human being. 
A NEW RULE OF LAW 
Disturbed by the claims of the communities 
within it, the modern state oscillates between 
two temptations. The first is to forcibly repress 
the demands of the communities and to pro- 
claim itself the only guarantor of the security of 
all. In the name of national unity, territorial 
integrity, the equality of its citizens and a non-par- 
tisan secularism, the state can use its powerful 
resources to reject the demands of communi- 
ties—it may even go as far as genocide to ensure 
that order prevails. Contrariwise, there is now a 
big temptation to respond to community 
demands by questioning the very nature of those 
states that were constructed more or less artifi- 
cially after the two World Wars. Czechoslovakia, 
for example, has sadly but calmly decided to split 
into two. Yugoslavia, on the other hand, 1s giving 
anew and dramatic meaning to the word “Balka- 
nization”: not only are the republics separating 
from one another, but within each one the so- 
called “confederated” regions, held together by 
loose ties, are also splitting apart. Thousands of 
kilometres away in Somalia, eight “clan regions” 
aspire to separate from one another. 
Even if they have the merit of guaranteeing the 
security of the communities involved (and this is 
by no means certain), can such divisions make 
sense in a world of ultra-rapid communications 
and industrial gigantism? Will these regions not 
lack the redistributive resources necessary to 
promote economic growth and social mobility in 
such limited areas? 
Without returning to the age of Empires, 
whether Ottoman, Russian or Austro-Hun- 
garian, the modern state must respond to the 
new militancy of its constituent communities, 
and to their legitimate quest for security. It must 
do so by inventing what the French philosopher 
and sociologist Raymond Aron called a “peace 
through law” that would guarantee justice both 
for the state as a whole and for its parts, and 
respect the claims of both reason and the emo- 
tions. The problem is one of reconciling nation- 
alist demands with the exercise of democracy. 
Before it can be solved, progress will have to be 
made in international law (particularly with . 
regard to the formulation of community and 
minority rights) and in constitutional law (with 
regard to definitions of decentralization, associ- 
ation and devolution). 
At a time when mternational organizations 
and communities of states are becoming more 
important, the nation, and therefore the state, 
no longer holds a monopoly on democracy. For 
this reason alone it should find a way of accom- 
modating local aspirations. m

HE Couriers “Greenwatch” 
section is now a year old. In 
the course of looking into 
programmes in progress 
around the world and listing 
available environmental edu- 
cation documents, we have come 
across many initiatives that we 
wanted to share with our readers. 
The time has now come to take 
stock of the most significant exper- 
iments carried out in the South and 
the North alike, of the obstacles they 
have encountered and the solutions 
that have been proposed.

define environmental education as 
“a permanent process in which indi- 
viduals gain awareness of their 
environment and acquire the knowl- 
edge, values, skills, experiences, and 
also the determination which will 
enable them to act—individually and 
collectively—to solve present and 
future environmental problems”. 
Experience shows that there is an

them. It is relatively easy to com-

to alter the mindsets that underlie 
certain types of behaviour—the atti-

instance, who paradoxically prefer 
murky river water to the clean water 
from a standpipe because “it has 
some taste”, the attitude of people 
who pour used motor oil into the 
sewage system, or that of people who 
have always burned down forests to 
make clearings for grazing land. 
UNEP and UNEsco have put great 
efforts into the establishment of an 
International Environmental Edu- 
cation Programme (IEEP). Some 
excellent documents have been 
produced, but they need to be made 
more widely available, in more lan- 
guage versions and at lower cost, 
and in any case a document, no 
matter how good it is or how well 
translated, is all but useless unless it 
is adapted to the specific needs ofits 
intended readers. It is essential, 
especially in the developing coun- 
tries, for local concerns and realities 
to be understood, then explained 
by respected community members. 
People will be unwilling to put 
recommendations into practice 
unless they clearly see the justifica- 
tion for them. A farmer will take 
some persuading that by cutting 
down the timber he badly needs he 
may be causing erosion and 
flooding downstream. It is pointless 
to recommend expensive environ- 
mental solutions where there is no 
money. It will be hard to convince a 
manufacturer to stop pouring toxic 
wastes into a river—even though he 
knows it is dangerous—as long asiit

of collection, disposal or recycling

There may also be serious con- 
flicts of interest between govern- 
ment departments. While one sells 
large, sometimes excessive, quanti- 
ties of wood in order to meet foreign 
debt repayments, another builds 
roads, and a third is looking for new 
energy sources, the department 
with responsibility for the environ- 
ment may not have an easy time 
putting across its point of view. 
Effective environmental educa- 
tion may, however, trigger vast 
movements of public opinion that 
can sway government policy. When, 
for example, it was planned to con- 
struct a hydroelectric dam at Nam 
Choan in the Thung Yai Naresuan 
Wildlife Sanctuary, the largest forest 
in Thailand, a nationwide campaign 
was immediately undertaken to 
  
focus attention on the drawbacks 
and dangers of the project, which 
included the flooding of a unique 
ecosystem and the extermination 
of some extremely rare animal 
species. Under the strong pressure 
of public opinion, the project was 
cancelled and the sanctuary was 
subsequently included on UNESCO's 
World Heritage List. 
Action to protect the environ- 
ment—in the form of demonstra- 
tions, media campaigns or civil dis- 
obedience—often has subversive 
overtones, as in the case of certain 
confrontations staged by anti- 
nuclear activists in Western Europe, 
or Greenpeace actions against 
French underground nuclear tests 
in the Pacific, while the seringueiro 
(Brazilian rubber tapper) Chico 
Mendes was murdered for wanting 
to protect his forest, 
To be credible, environmental 
information must be objective and 
must include and explain contra- 
dictory views. The nature of the polit- 
ical context is also of considerable 
importance: those involved in envi- 
ronmental education must enjoy 
civil rights and be legally protected. 
Despite UnEesco’s efforts to 
encourage press freedom, journalists 
in many countries are all too often 
public employees subjected to cen- 
sorship, unable to report freely, for 
instance, on a pollution problem or 
an epidemic for fear of harming the 
tourist industry, while the fear of 
losing their jobs often makes jour- 
nalists practise self-censorship, with 
harmful effects all round. Journalists 
must have access to data which are 
both scientifically correct and rele- 
vant, i.e. related to local realities. 
Despite all the statements of 
intent produced by international 
conferences, development and the 
protection of the environment still 
do not live in harmony together. 
“Powerful economic interests,” 
explains an expert, “tend to threaten 
both the livelihood of the local pop- 
ulation and the natural environ- 
ment.” Environmental education 
must adapt to this situation and 
invent new strategies. |

FORESTS—ADVANCE 
AND RETREAT 
The Forests Committee of the 
United Nations Food and Agricul- 
ture Organization (FAO), meeting 
in March 1993 in Rome, noted that 
during the 1980s 154 million 
hectares of tropical forest disap- 
peared, whereas forest resources in 
the industrial countries grew. 
According to an FAO study, forests 
cover 56 per cent of the land sur- 
face area in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, 24 per cent in Africa, 
and 35 per cent in Asia where, 
though this is the region where 
deforestation has been most 
intense, 26 million hectares were 
reforested in the same period of 
time. Forest cover in developed 
countries is constantly increasing,

FUELLING A

The Proalcool programme launched 
in Brazil in 1975 appears to have 
some drawbacks. Methanol, used 
as a petrol substitute, is made from 
sugar cane. In order to produce 
more cane, the Atlantic forest in the 
Nordeste province continues to be 
cleared and has dwindled from one 
million to 135,000 square kilome- 
tres. The Secretaries of the Envi- 
ronment of the states in this part of 
the country are aware of the threat 
and have joined in a forest conser- 
vation programme run by the orga- 
nization Mata Atlantica which is 
"already being put into effect in eight 
southern and southeastern 
Brazilian states. The $200-million 
programme is supported by the

BLEACH VERSUS 
BACTERIA 
Research conducted in 1989 by Pro- 
fessor Dodin of the Institut Pasteur 
in Paris confirmed that Javel water, 
a common bleach containing 
sodium hypochlorite, salt and 
water, is one of the most powerful 
and cheapest disinfectants avail- 
able. Two or three drops of 12° 
bleach are enough to kill the bac- 
teria in a litre of water in thirty sec-_ 
onds, or to disinfect raw vegetables. 
The advantage of this for the coun- 
tries of the South is that it obviates 
the need to boil water, thereby 
saving wood, while providing effec- 
tive protection against cholera. 
What is more, this humble sub- 
stance is environment-friendly: it 
self-destructs in the course of its 
action, releasing oxygen and leaving 
just alittle salt behind. ||

RETURN OF THE GRAY WOLF 
American environmentalists and the National Wildlife 
Federation are campaigning to reintroduce the gray 
wolf into Yellowstone National Park in the northwestern 
United States. More than 80,000 wolves were killed in the 
state of Montana between 1883 and 1918, and the 
species completely disappeared from the area in the 
1930s. Local farmers are not happy about a project 
likely to expose their livestock to this ill-famed predator. 
They argue that there are still plenty of gray wolves in 
Alaska and Canada and that there is no real threat to the 
survival of the species. The reintroduction of the lynx in 
the French Vosges and Jura mountains poses a similar 
problem: even though the move is theoretically 
favourable to the balance of the ecosystem, it creates 
hostility on the part of local people. Is it better to over- 
ride such objections or to accept a “simplification” of

and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) returned 
from a six-month mission in the Gulf with dismal news. 
Marine life on the Saudi Arabian coasts has virtually dis- 
appeared and 90 per cent of the coral reefs off the coast 
of Kuwait have been destroyed. The destruction of 
Kuwaiti oil wells by the retreating Iraqi army sent some 
1.3 billion litres of oil into the waters of the Gulf, 25 
times as much as the wrecked tanker Exxon Valdez 
spilled onto the coast of Alaska in 1989. Whoever said

WHAT TO DO WITH WASTE? 
According to the American nongovernmental organi- 
zation INFORM, the 180 million tonnes of waste gen- 
erated in the United States each year would form a 
tower 42 kilometres high if packed tightly onto a foot- 
ball field. This evocative image is all the more dis- 
turbing because per capita garbage output is increasing, 
while existing disposal sites are saturated and com- 
munities are opposed to new ones being established in 
their neighbourhood. INFORM, which is backed by 
foundation and government subsidies and by indi- 
vidual and corporate donations, aims to mobilize all the 
interested parties. Among other activities, it publishes 
simple waste-prevention advice for schools and a series 
of intelligent, practical manuals. The contact address is:

1993, YEAR OF INDIGENOUS 
PEOPLES 
“We are just one more acting element in the biosphere, 
no more and no less important than the others, and we 
haven't the right to submit the other elements to our 
excessive needs and our domination,” writes Rémy 
Kurtness, chief of the Montagnais Council of Lac-Saint- 
Jean in Quebec, Canada. The Montagnais people live on 
avast area located in Quebec and Labrador. “Our fore- 
fathers always rotated their hunting grounds, just like 
farmers who periodically leave their lands fallow to let 
the soil rest. Land can be productive as long as it is 
respected. It cannot overproduce, and it certainly 
cannot be bled to death.” The United Nations has pro- 
claimed 1993 the Year of Indigenous Peoples, providing 
an opportunity for everyone to share the wisdom of 
those who love their land and are devoted to harmo- 
nizing development with nature and wildlife. |

### 94412: The Siren song of self-determination

When empires

* of self-determination 
can be exploited by 
extreme nationalist 
ideologies, with 
“terrible consequences 
¢ J ATIONALISM ...1s nothing without the 
N creation of nation-states, and a world of 
such states, fitting the present ethnic- 
linguistic criteria of nationality, is not a feasible 
prospect today. . . . Only a handful of fanatics 
would, it is safe to say, regard this achievement of 
national/communal self-determination as more 
than marginally better than an acutely unsatis- 
factory status quo.” 
So wrote the British historian Eric Hobs- 
bawm in 1990, in his book Nations and Nation- 
alism since 1780. His prognosis is not untypical 
of the views held by most observers on the eve of 
the implosion of the Soviet empire. Almost invari- 
ably, speculation about the impending transfor- 
mations of Soviet communism stopped short of 
“Balkanization” as a plausible scenario. Rational 
choice arguments pointed to the senselessness 
of trading “an unsatisfactory status quo” for the 
uncertainties of ethno-regional self-determina- 
tion. On the left, much the same conclusion was 
reached by advocates of the “proletarians have no 
fatherland” thesis. But perhaps the most preva- 
lent assumption was that the collapse of com- 
munism necessarily implied the advent of “free- 
market democracy”, thus creating the very 
inducements needed for the maintenance of 
multinational state systems.

asserting themselves as the principal vectors of Lag 
oppression and violence. Conversely, in most of 
these states, the once dominant Russian majority 
“has been fragmented into embattled ethnic 
minorities, up against chronic violence (as in 
Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan) and systematic 
political discrimination (as in the Baltic 
Republics). 
The parallel with the massive re-ordering of 
political loyalties that followed in the wake of 
European decolonization can hardly go unno- 
ticed. Just as the impending withdrawal of colo- 
nial controls from much of Africa and Asia stim- 
ulated the rise of a host of nationalist and 
ethno-regional movements, the advent of pere- 
stroika has had a similarly catalytic effect on the 
crystallization of ethnic claims and counter- 
claims. In Eastern Europe as in much of Africa 
and Asia the logic of self-determination carries 
within itself the seeds of seemingly endless con- 
flicts. As more and more ethnic groups seek to 
reclassify themselves as potential nations, others 
strenuously resist incorporation in the name of 
their own claims to self-determination.

ETHNIC MANIPULATION 
The violence that has accompanied the redrawing 
of state boundaries bears ample testimony to the 
threat posed to human rights and democracy by 
the excesses of self-determination. Where group 
rights defined in terms of assumed blood ties 
and ethnicity are held up as a normative standard 
against individual rights, there can be no basis for 
democracy. The same is true of situations where 
the claims of the majority are exercised to sup- 
press the rights of minorities. Implicit in such slo-

Nowhere in the world does territorial sover- 
eignty coincide with ethnic identity. The bound- 
aries of the successor states of the Austro-Hun- 
garian, Ottoman and Soviet empires are no less 
artificial than the lines drawn by European col- 
onizers around their imperial domains in the last 
century. Even in the case of so-called “ethnic 
cleansing”, new patterns of fragmentation are 
bound to emerge behind the fagade of shared 
cultural commonalities. 
“Ethnic cleansing”: what the horribly ant- 
septic metaphor conveys is a definition of the 
“other” as a vector of social contamination. The 
intent, in short, is to give moral justification to the 
physical suppression of culturally distinct com- 
munities. Whether defined in terms of religion, 
language or other cultural traits, real or assumed, 
ethnic minorities often end up being the prime

targets of ethnic cleansing. The most important 
point, however, is that in almost every instance the 
“other” is being redefined, recontextualized, and 
in the process almost dehumanized. The Holo- 
caust is an extreme example of how the dehu- 
manization of an entire group of people helps jus- 
tify its physical annihilation. A strikingly similar 
phenomenon lies behind the genocidal killings in 
Bosnia, where Muslims are now being reduced to 
a sub-human category by certain ideologues, and 
treated as such. 
Politicized ethnicity does not invariably trans- 
late into genocidal violence; yet it always involves 
a measure of political manipulation. Contrary 
to what is often assumed, ethnic nationalism does 
not just emerge full-blown from the mists of his- 
tory. Itis the product of complex social and eco- 
nomic forces often set in motion under the aegis 
of the colonial state. The critical factor, however, 


### 94412: The Siren song of self-determination

is the part played by ethnic entrepreneurs in 
stimulating the awakening of a collective self- 
awareness. 
If ethno-nationalism is first and foremost 
manipulated nationalism, in this process histor- 
ical memory plays a crucial role. It mixes facts 
with fiction, it squeezes reality into symbolic 
frames and invests the past with new meanings. 
“Imagined communities” thus take on a reality of 
their own. The ties that bind are not blood ties or 
kinship ties but what Paul Veyne calls “/’imagi- 
nation constituante”. It is sadly ironic that some 
of the worst examples of ethnic killings should 
have happened among communities that are cul- 
turally almost indistinguishable, and which for 
centuries had lived in peace with each other. 
The devastating effects of selective memory as

a form of political manipulation are nowhere 
more evident than in the exalted brand of ethnic 
chauvinism exhibited by the extremists who set 
themselves the task of “cleansing” Bosnia of 
Muslim and Croat elements. While the first are 
seen as a living reminder of Turkish domination, 
and are collectively referred to as Turks even 
though none are able to speak a word of Turkish, 
the second are collectively identified with the 
horrors of the Nazi-installed Croatian fascist 
state during the Second World War. Totally oblit- 
erated from the collective consciousness is the fact 
that Serbs, Croats and Muslims lived at peace 
with each other for centuries prior to the Second 
World War. This is where the resistance of the 
people of Sarajevo carries a powerful demon- 
stration effect: it demonstrates that communi- 
ties of mixed origins can indeed live in harmony. 
iISCALATING VIOLENCE 
Again, to see in the savage bloodletting in Ayo- 
dhya and elsewhere in India nothing more than 
an age-old antagonism between Hindus and Mus- 
lims misses the point. Rather than a religious 
confrontation between mosque and temple, what 
is at issue here is a conflict of nationalist ideolo- 
gies activated through the symbolic manipulation 
of Ram and Babur, the first identified with the 
most potent of all gods in the Hindu pantheon, 
the second with an alien, Turkic-Mongol con- 
queror. In the contemporary discourse of Hindu 
fundamentalists the myth of Ram—encapsulated 
in the ubiquitous slogan of “Jai Sri Ram!” (“Hail 


### 94412: The Siren song of self-determination

to the Lord Ram!”)—emerges as a powerful 
symbol of cultural identity and a rallying-cry 
against the Moghul conquerors. Behind the threat 
posed to the survival of Muslim communities 
  
also lies a major challenge to the spirit of tolerance 
and mutual respect embedded in what was once 
known as the “Hindustani culture” —the fragile 
fusion of Hindu and Muslim influences which 
also formed a major ingredient of the Nehru 
brand of liberal Indian nationalism. 
The claims embodied in the principle of self- 
determination are made all the more explosive by 
the external dimensions of ethnic strife. Where 
cultural affinities transcend the domestic arena 
and serve as poles of attraction for the interven- 
tion of outside forces, or as a pretext for retalia- 
tion against minorities in neighbouring states, 
successful conflict resolution becomes very dif- 
ficult indeed. Domestic conflict inevitably triggers 
inter-state ethnic conflict; each feeds on the other, 
thus generating a nightmarish sequence of inter- 
locking violence. 
To recognize the primacy of ethnic particu- 
larity is to acknowledge the rights of minorities. 
In looking for ways of protecting these rights 
we need to rethink the responsibilities of the 
international community. As has now become 
dramatically clear, the threats posed to minorities 
through the “excesses of self-determination” 
carry implications that go far beyond the bound- 
aries of existing state systems. The massive exodus 
of refugee populations into neighbouring areas 
imperils their political stability, generates fresh 
outbursts of xenophobic violence and imposes 
insuperable burdens on their economies. 
Although the tasks ahead are daunting, the time 
has come to invest the United Nations security 
system with a new mandate, one that would not 
simply reaffirm the rights of minorities but stip- 
ulate the rules and criteria under which the use of 
force can be internationally sanctioned and 
brought into effect. u

4 SERRE 
  
GUESTS, IMMIGRANTS, 
FRYE modern nation-state, which is based on 
a universalist ideology, invented the con- 
cept of citizenship so as to include all 
people, irrespective of the communities to which 
they belong, as individuals with equal rights. But 
the cultural, linguistic and religious diversity of 
modern societies has persisted, to the point where 
the notion of minorities has re-emerged. 
The term minority refers to a community 
which organizes itself around an identity that 
is different from that of society as a whole, 
which expresses that difference publicly and 
demands to be recognized for what it is. Such 
minorities may be religious, national or ethnic. 
National minorities demand recognition of a 
territory of their own within the nation-state. 
Regional minorities put forward certain spe- 
MINORITIES 
by Riva Kastoryano 
cific claims arising out of their geographical 
location. 
Ethnic minorities are more difficult to define 
precisely, since they encompass the twin con- 
cepts of cultural community and social class. In 
the United States, for example, in spite of the 
cultural diversity on which the nation is based, 
people disadvantaged not only by their ethnic, 
racial, national or religious origin, but also by 
social class, are designated as minorities. | 
In Europe, the large-scale immigration that 
has taken place since the 1960s has created sim- 
ilar situations. Yet in contrast to the practice in the 
United States, immigrant populations in Europe 
are not defined as minorities, but as immigrés 
(“immigrants”) in France and as Gastarbeiter 
(“guest workers”) in Germany and Switzerland. BB

RIVA KASTORYANO, 
of France, is currently carrying 
out research at the Centre for 
International Studies and 
Research, Paris, on the 
expression of identities and 
community action among 
migrants in Europe. Among 
her publications are Etre turc 
en France: Réflexions sur familles 
et communauté (L'Harmattan 
publishers, Paris, 1986) and 
“Integration and expression of 
collective identities of migrants 
in France and Germany”, a 
study which appeared in the 
Journal of Ethnic Studies 
(1992). 
Behind these differences in terminology, which 
reflect the influence of national thinking on the 
subject, a convergence between European immi- 
gration and integration policies can be seen. 
Immigration in Europe grew out of efforts to 
promote economic reconstruction after years of 
war and stagnation. Some states, such as Ger- 
many, signed bilateral agreements with coun- 
tries of the Mediterranean basin. Others, such as 
France, the United Kingdom and the Nether- 
lands, opened their doors to the peoples of their 
former colonies. Some, such as Germany, laid 
down a specific policy on immigration. Others, 
such as France and the United Kingdom, implic- 
itly acknowledged that foreign workers were 
there to stay for some time. The immigrant 
workers themselves saw their situation as an 
opportunity to move up the social ladder back in 
their home countries. This economically-driven 
immigration movement was thus seen by both’ 
sides as a temporary expedient. 
Today the fact that the immigrants and their 
families have settled permanently is paralleled 
by forms of integration that vary from group to 
group and from country to country. The ways in

nizing themselves are strongly influenced by the 
historical, economic, cultural and political links 
between their countries of origin and the host 
countries. Even so, a common pattern of activity 
can be discerned. In every country, immigrants 
mobilize in a bid to achieve equal rights to jobs 
and housing; they fight discrimination; they react 
against racism; and they seek to obtain some 
form of political representation that will bring 
them respect and recognition.

Demands for a say in political matters are voiced

other things, basic legal information on such’ 
matters as entry and residence rights and for-

sense of identity is strengthened and they are all the 
more eager to win recognition for their distinctive 
features. They also establish new ties in which 
economic, social and political interests go hand in 
hand with the desire to assert their identity, a 
desire that prompts them to negotiate with the 
authorities and the machinery of the state, Even in 
a political context in which citizenship is seen as 
the only path to integration, this approach is two- 
edged, insofar as it establishes a de facto minority 
status. 
In the debate on immigration in France, the 
term “minority” is never used, since the French 
state has traditionally regarded itself as universalist 
and secular. In Germany the word has a very 
different connotation. The idea of the German 
nation, founded on a community of culture, lan- 
guage and even blood, rules out all cultural dif- 
ferences. Since, by their very nature, they cannot

status, the associations promote his or her inte- 
gration into society through language and lit- 
eracy courses for adults and education and 
training programmes for the young. They also 
organize debates, concerts and other types of 
performance to increase public awareness of the 
group’s indigenous culture and to make people 
more responsive to their particular situation. 
These associations depend for their survival 
largely on government grants to the main sectors 
involved in the integration process, such as 
employment, housing and community life. In 
its support for socio-cultural activities, the gov- 
ernment encourages community events such as 
the celebration of national holidays. Govern- 
ments regard the right granted to foreigners, asa 
legally recognized category, to form associations 
as being primarily aimed at encouraging civic 
equality. However, some researchers see this sup- 
port as a deliberate policy to perpetuate the 
minority status of immigrants, since in their view 
the authorities are intent on controlling the types 
of organization created, on steering the immigrant 
population in a given direction, and, if neces- 
sary, mobilizing it for that purpose. 
Through the associations, the immigrants’ 
belong to a nation defined in these terms, the 
Gastarbeiter—also referred to as Auslinder (“for- 
eigners”) or as auslindische Mitbiirger (“foreign 
fellow-citizens”)—claim minority status and 
demand a policy on minorities that will secure 
their political recognition. 
"The Netherlands is the only European country 
that expressly refers to “minorities”, although 
they are still not defined as a legal category. Minon- 
ties have been officially described as “caravan- 
dwellers and legal residents such as Indians, Suri- 
namese, Gypsies, refugees and migrants”. In order 
to create conditions conducive to their emanci- 
pation, the formation of groups on a national or 
religious basis is encouraged. These are assured of 
playing an active part in social and political life as 
pressure groups. 
In the United Kingdom, according to John 
Rex, the immigrant communities are not simply 
ethnic groups seeking to preserve their cultural 
identity and negotiate their status as minorities 
with society as a whole. They are more ambitious 
in that they seck to work in conjunction with the 
nation’s institutions in order to win the support 
of majority opinion. 
The prospect of a united Europe reopens the 
whole issue of the integration strategies of the var- 
ious countries. Fresh scope for negotiation, 
extending further than the framework of the 
nation-state, is emerging for all national and reli- 
glous communities. In years to come, minority 
status will have to be based on a multicultural 
conception of citizenship. In a society that has 
raised the banner of multiculturalism on the insti- 
tutional, national, regional and even religious 
levels, the assertion of minority identity will 
come to seem the only real course of action. Wl 35

### 94414: A Sense of difference

A SENSE OF 
DIFFERENCE 
by Yves Plasseraud 
T HAT are the usual criteria by which a 
W minority group can be identified? In 
the case of ethnic or cultural minori- 
ties, the first criterion is that of language. A group 
using a language different from that of the majority 
in the midst of which its members live, like the 
Armenian community in exile or the Jews in nine- 
teenth-century Russia, is clearly a minority. The 
same applies to peoples such as the Kurds in Iran 
or the Welsh in the United Kingdom, who live in 
a specific region of a state and speak a different lan- 
guage from that of the state. 
The linguistic criterion is far from conclu- 
sive, however. A variety of identity “tags”, such 
as religion, or cultural factors such as tradition, 
can also help to give people a sense of identity as 
members of a minority. 
We shall therefore adopt a definition that is 
more subjective than objective and say that a 
group constitutes a minority when it feels from 
experience that it is in a minority in relation to the 
environment in which it lives. Account must 
therefore be taken of its culture, language, tradi- 
tions or religion.

RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL AND 
ETHNIC MINORITIES 
The first and probably most obvious category of 
minority is that based on religious affiliation. 
This is more than just a statistical phenomenon. 
The fact that there may be more Protestants than 
Catholics in, say, Germany or the United States 
does not mean that the Catholics can be said to be 
a minority. For a religious group to be in a 
minority situation, this situation must be con- 
spicuous enough for it to give rise to a sense of 
vulnerability or even inferiority. By this crite- 
rion, the Bahais of Iran, the Copts of Egypt and 
the Mennonites of Russia are minorities. The 
same criterion has applied for some years now to 
the Muslims in India and the Hindus in Pakistan 
and Bangladesh. 
So-called “cultural” minorities constitute

another important category, although one thats 
mentioned less often and is sometimes ques- 
tioned. Their “difference” is not, strictly speaking, 
one of language or religion. One such case is that 
of the Jews who in some countries speak dif- 
ferent languages from most of the population, 
even though some of these languages, such as 
Ladino or Yiddish, could be described as “ethnic 
languages”. Here, religious affiliation often only 
represents a symbolic form of loyalty to an iden- 
tity that has a number of other defining features, 
such as dietary practices, humour and a long tra- 
dition of persecution. A similar situation is found 
among the Gypsies, who show an awareness of 
their identity that goes beyond differences of 
language and religion. 
When we come to the third category—the 
ethnic or national minorities which account for by 
far the largest number of minority situations—we

enter a problem area in which a distinction has to 
be made between several sub-categories. 
The first of these sub-categories is that of abo- 
riginal or tribal populations who live outside the 
mainstream of present-day society and continue 
to practise their ancestral customs. These groups, 
which are often almost on the verge of extinction 
because their way of life is out of step with the 
modern world, include ethnic groups as different 
as the Pygmies of Cameroon, the Aborigines of 
Australia, the Miao of central Vietnam or the 
Indians of the Mato Grosso in Brazil. Their situ- 
ation is in many respects different from that of the 
other groups. They are specifically considered as 
“indigenous peoples” by the United Nations. 
Another sub-category consists of those peo- 
ples who are widely scattered and who, although 
speaking a common language, do not have a 
country of origin or attachment. This is the case

of the Assyro-Chaldeans, or Assyrians, in the 
Middle East and of the Vlachs in Europe. These 
peoples, which tend not to be numerous, are par- 
ticularly vulnerable. 
There are also the relatively rare cases of what 
might be termed “majority” minorities, peoples 
which comprise the majority of the population in 
terms of numbers but are relegated to de facto 
“minority” status in the country in which they live. 
Among these peoples are the Quechua Indians of 
Ecuador and the Blacks of South Africa. 
Another category is that of the “territorial” 
minorities, which have traditionally occupied a 
specific area which they regard as their “ethnic” 
or “national” territory. Members of this cate- 
gory include the Berbers, the Kurds, the Cata- 
lans, the German-speakers of the South Tyrol, 
and the Maris (people of Finno-Ugric stock 
living in the Urals), all of whom have long 
occupied regions which they regard as their 
“homeland”, to which they are bound by col- 
lective memories that form the bedrock of their 
“systems of symbols”. 
In many cases, they owe their situation as 
minorities to border changes, particularly as a 
result of the creation of new states. These changes 
suddenly put them on the other side of a border, 
along with other minority peoples from different 
ethnic groups. The partition of Czechoslovakia 
in 1993, which has left some Slovaks in “Czechia” 
and some Czechs in Slovakia, is one such problem 
area. These “contingent minorities”, as they are 
sometimes called, can be contrasted with other 


### 94414: A Sense of difference

minorities whose status might be said to be their 
“essence”. The latter traditionally regard them- 
selves as minorities and belong to two types, 
“colonies” deliberately settled by a ruling power 
for military or economic purposes, and “landless 
nations” like the Gypsies. 
The sense of identity varies significantly 
between different groups, regardless of their size. 
The factors that determine the extent of a people’s 
resistance to assimilation are still not fully under- 
stood. Our own time, when “progress” and “con- 
sumerist” standardization are undermining iden- 
tities and differences almost everywhere, also 
happens to coincide with a juncture when those 
identities and differences are being strongly 
asserted. When peoples are sucked into processes 
of levelling down and standardization, they seem 
to generate “differentiating antibodies” that inten- 
sify their sense of identity and prompt them to 
seek greater autonomy. 
Whatever the cause and significance of this 
paradox may be, it is certain that people cannot 
be robbed with impunity of the stabilizing and 
comforting ethos of an identity fully accepted and 
expressed. To uproot people and repress their 
identity is to breed anxiety among them and 
destroy their sense of community. The choice 
today may lie between urban riots and Sarajevo- 
type situations on the one hand and on the other 
the harmonious and unfettered development of 
identities from which all features incompatible 
with the dignity of the human person have been 
banished. ||

JGOSLAV QUAGMIRE 
FB HERE are no minorities in multinational 
states such as the Switzerland and Belgium 
of today, the Soviet Union of yesterday, and 
the Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and 
the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia of earlier 
times. In such cases state and nation do not nec- 
essarily coincide. The existence of several nations 
within the state is taken for granted. No distinc- 
tion is made between majority and minorities. 
Nor do minorities exist in the state-based 
nation-state, in which the state is formed before 
the emergence of the nation, which takes shape 
within that pre-established mould. The two enti- 
ties thus automatically coincide. This is true of the 
oldest states of Western Europe, such as France, 
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Por- 
tugal, and also of the United States. The various 
ethnic minorities which live in states of this 
kind—Bretons or Scots for example—feel that 
they belong not only to the state but also to the 
nation—French or British as the case may be. 
A national minority can only exist in a nation- 
based nation-state, in which the state is formed 
after the nation becomes conscious of its existence 
and with the avowed aim of modelling itself 4 pos- 
teriori on an already existing nation. Since the 
frontiers of the two entities never entirely coin- 
cide, there are bound to be national minorities. 
This is the situation throughout central Europe, 
from Italy to Estonia, from Germany to Greece. 
The creation of states of this type was one of 
the great ambitions of the victors of the First 
World War, and this is why the peace treaties of 
1919 and the League of Nations drew up abody 
by Paul Garde 
of legislation on national minorities. The mem- 
bers of these minorities were to have the same 
individual rights as other citizens and thus be 
protected against any discriminatory measures. 
They could also demand the recognition of col- 
lective rights concerning the use of their lan- 
guage, education and the protection of their cul- 
ture. But the instruments adopted between the 
wars did not provide for them to be granted a 
third possible type of freedom: that of territorial 
antonomy. 
These rights were poorly implemented in the 
1920s and were later systematically flouted by fas- 
cist regimes. They were ignored altogether under 
communism. Today they are back on the agenda. 
THE LAND OF THE 
SOUTHERN SLAVS 
In this respect the example of the Yugoslav or 
southern Slav territory has been unique in this 
century. What were the key stages in the forma- 
tion of this area? 
Before 1914, the kingdom of Serbia was the 
quintessence of the nation-based nation-state. It 
was homogeneous until 1912 because the non- 
Serbian (Turkish and Albanian) elements had 
been expelled during the previous century. It 
took in Albanian, Macedonian, Turkish and other 
minorities during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) 
but without recognizing that they had any rights. 
Between 1914 and 1941, having in the mean- 
time become Yugoslavia, the kingdom doubled in 
area. Its subjects now included Croats, Slovenes,

among others. And yet officially it remained a 
nation-state thanks to the fiction of the “Yugoslav 
nation” subdivided into three “tribes” (pleme): 
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (the other Yugoslav 
nations did not count). Thus the state, in which 
the Serbs were numerically preponderant (com- 
prising some 40 per cent of the population), was 
supposed to consist of a “Yugoslav” majority 
(some 85 per cent) and non-Slav minorities. 
Between 1945 and 1991, Tito’s Yugoslavia 
abandoned the fiction of the “Yugoslav nation”, 
which the horrors of the Second World War had 
brought to a bloody end, and officially became a 
multinational state, recognizing six southern Slav 
peoples as distinct nations: the Serbs, the Croats, 
the Slovenes, the Macedonians, the Montene- 
grins and somewhat later the “Muslims” 
(Bosnians). The unitary kingdom became a fed- 
eral republic. The Yugoslav communists thus 
followed the example set a quarter of a century 
earlier by the Soviets, who had transformed the 
Russian empire, dominated by a single nation, 
into a multinational federation, the USSR. 
But Stalin had drawn the logical—or at least 
terminological—conclusions from this change. 
The Russian communists had championed the 
rights of the various non-Russian peoples of the 
empire, designated by the term “national 
minority” (natsmen). In the USSR, majority and 
minorities officially ceased to exist; there were 
only large or small nations, all theoretically equal. 
In Yugoslavia on the other hand, in spite of the 
transition to a multinational state, the hierarchy 
PASSOVER IN 
between “nation” (narod) and “minority” (man- 
jina) was maintained. The former term was used 
to designate the six southern Slav nations, while 
the latter referred to the other non-southern- 
Slav peoples, such as the Albanians, the Hun- 
garians, the Gypsies and the Turks. In 1963 the 
term “minority”, which was felt to be pejorative, 
was replaced by that of “nationality” (narod- 
nost), but the same ranking order continued to 
exist. Official language referred to “nations and 
nationalities”, but a term encompassing the two 
was never invented. The logic of the multina- 
tional state was not fully applied: some peoples 
were more equal than others. 
This hierarchy of peoples was paralleled by 
a hierarchy of territories. The federation com- 
prised six republics; in other words there were 
as many republics as there were “nations”, Each 
nation was thus “constitutive” of at least one 
republic. Attached to the republic of Serbia, 
however, there were also “autonomous 
provinces”, corresponding to the existence of 
“minorities”. These were Kosovo, where there 
was an Albanian “minority” (sic) which 
accounted for 68 per cent of the population in 
1948 (90 per cent today), and Vojvodina, where 
non-Serbs totalled 49 per cent of the population 
in 1948 (43 per cent today). 
The history of the federation was marked 
from start to finish by hesitations over the status 
of the autonomous provinces, especially Kosovo. 
The provinces enjoyed very limited autonomy at 
the outset, but this grew unul in the last consti- 
tution adopted under Tito, that of 1974, it almost

The place: the old synagogue, miracu- 
lously still standing, although its windows 
are shattered. 
The time: 12:30 p.m. 
The weather is fine. There is relatively 
little shooting. The little street, usually 
empty, is full of onlookers, policemen and 
armed soldiers. Everyone is waiting for 
President Izetbegovic. 
Inside the synagogue there is an unusual 
bustle of activity, Pesach—Passover—is 
being celebrated for the 500th time since the 
first Sephardic Jews arrived here in search 
of a quiet spot where they could take refuge 
from the Inquisition. 
Quieter spots than this could be imag-

At the same moment, a few blocks 
away, at the Academy of Sciences, a sym- 
posium on the damage suffered by the city 
during a year’s shelling is about to open. 
For some reason, there is no shelling 
today. There is the usual machine-gun and 
automatic rifle fire, but people hardly notice 
it any more. 
A hundred-odd townspeople, Jews and 
non-Jews, are packed into the little room on 
the left of the main entrance. The table has 
been carefully laid by the women and girls. 
In front of each guest is an egg, dark brown 
from being boiled for hours with onion 
peelings. Where have they managed to find 
the onions? And the eggs? 
“Eggs were cheaper at the market yes-

and until there is a cease-fire around this 
town in eastern Bosnia, he does not wish to 
negotiate. 
Surrounded by bodyguards, he enters 
the synagogue, followed by members of the 
government. Two minutes later the Rei ul

of former Yugoslavia, arrives, at almost the 
same moment as the Catholic archbishop, 
Monsignor Puljic, and the former leader of

ment has not yet reached Sarajevo because of

table and listen to Ivica Ceresnjes, presi- 
dent of the city’s Jewish community. They 
know each other well; their communities 
have lived together for five centuries.

equalled that of the republics, before being bru- 
tally suppressed in 1989-1990. 
In 1991 the federation broke up into five 
states, one remaining multinational (Bosnia) and 
the other four being nation-states (Slovenia, 
Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia). With 
the exception of Slovenia (which is virtually 
homogeneous), these states contain minorities. 
The largest of these (each comprising over 300,000 
persons) are the Serb minority in Croatia, the 
Albanian and Hungarian minority in Serbia- 
Montenegro, and the Albanian minority in Mace- 
donia. Bosnia, by virtue of its constitution, is the 
common territory of three peoples: Muslims (44 
per cent), Serbs (31 per cent) and Croats (17 per 
cent). 
THE STEAMROLLER 
OF HIERARCIY 
But the consequences of the hierarchy estab- 
lished in Tito’s time between “nations” and 
“minorities” can still be felt. Everything sug- 
gests that the Serbs regarded the status of “nation” 
Bosnian Muslims executed 
at the entry to their 
village. 


### 94416: Passover in Sarajevo

Fifty years ago, between 1941 and 1945, 
the harmony was interrupted. Tens of thou- 
sands of Bosnians were killed during a ter- 
rible war. Nine-tenths of the Jewish popu- 
lation were annihilated, and the rest hid in 
the homes of their Muslim, Serb and Croat 
friends. Then, with the return of peace, the 
survivors came back to Sarajevo to take up 
again the life of their community, shattered 
by foreign aggression. 
Aware of their unique situation, the 
Jews of Sarajevo have always been 
extremely cosmopolitan. One marriage in 
three was a mixed marriage. When misfor- 
tune again struck the people of this 
Olympic city on 7 April last year, the 
Jewish community numbered 5,000—1,000 
Jews and 4,000 Muslims, Serbs and Croats, 
wives and husbands, cousins, uncles and 
aunts, or simply friends affiliated to the 
community. About a thousand children 
and old people have left the city to escape 
death, but the other 4,000 have remained 
and form one of the world’s most tightly- 
knit groups. They are now virtually insep- 
arable. Each day they come to the syna- 
gogue for a meal, one after the other. 
Opposite, in the pharmacy which belongs 
to the community, medicines from abroad 
are dispensed to the people of Sarajevo free 
of charge. All they have to do is show a 
medical prescription. 
His prayer shawl over his shoulders, 
Ceresnjes speaks of tolerance, friendship 
and peace. People listen gravely, making 
no attempt to hide their tears. Qutside, 
close by, death lies in wait, ethnic cleansing 
is going on, a sermon of hate, not love, is 
being preached. The guests eat their eggs— 
two dollars is a small investment for a 
friendly meal—and unleavened bread, as 
the matzo wafers have somehow got lost 
between New York and the little street in 
Sarajevo. Speaker follows speaker; each 
one talks of peace, but seemingly without 
great conviction. They want peace but don’t 
quite know how to achieve it or whether it 
can be achieved. They want the madness to 
stop and multi-ethnic families to be able to 
continue their lives without fear. No one 
talks of happiness. That will have to wait. 
Meanwhile, a candle is lit. The flame is 
small but it has vast significance. It is the 
flame of tolerance, the flame of survival. 
The ceremony is over. People shake 
hands, embrace. They go back to the cellars. 
Take care at the intersections—even if there 
is no shelling, there are always the snipers. 
Where there are trees there is danger, so 
move quickly. If they were not dangerous 
places, people would have chopped the 
trees down long ago for firewood. But now 
spring is here and perhaps there will be no 
need for wood and fire. 
The little flame burns on, a last flame of 
hope that soon this nightmare will be over 
and these Jews and Muslims, Serbs and 
Croats of Sarajevo will be able to live a 
new life together. 
Will they be given this last chance? ®

for themselves and that of “minority” for others 
as a privilege to be enjoyed in perpetuity. 
Their refusal to be a “minority” in Croatia led 
to the outbreak of war against that country in the 
summer of 1991 and to the setting-up of a seat of 
Serb power (“the Serb Republic of Krajina”) on 
at least one-quarter of Croat territory, as well as 
to the expulsion of non-Serbs, representing about 
half the population (200,000 to 300,000 persons). 
In Bosnia, where there 1s no majority nation 
and where their status as a “constitutive people” 
is not disputed, the Serbs are afraid of being in the 
minority (in the Parliamentary meaning of the 
term) in face of a possible coalition of the other 
two peoples, and also reject the independent 
Bosnian state. This led to the war which they 
unleashed in April 1992 in a bid to hive off and 
create an ethnically pure “Serb Republic” in 
Bosnia, covering two-thirds of the land area. The 
outcome so far has been to create two million 
refugees. 
In Serbia on the other hand, the authorities 
proclaim the rights of the “majority” vis-a-vis the 
“minorities”, and consequently the territorial 
autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, provinces 
peopled by “minorities”, has been suppressed. 
Outside Serbia the rights of Serb minorities are 
being defended to the point of secession, while 
within Serbia itself the rights of non-Serb minori- 
ties are being whittled away to zero, if necessary 
by forcible expulsion; in other words, the object 
is to change the frontiers of Serbia wherever the 
latter leave Serbs outside, but to preserve them 
intact in cases where they include non-Serbs. 
What aim can the international community set 
itself in view of this strategy? The preservation of 
existing frontiers is an absolute principle for want 
of which the whole of Europe would again be 
plunged into the nightmare of wars of conquest. 
It must be saved from such a fate On the other 
hand, the nation-based nation-state is a very 
potent aspiration in this part of the world, and one 
that it would be vain to oppose. In other words 
there are bound to be minorities and they will 
have to be protected. 
The only valid aim would be to adopt an 
international law on minorities that would guar- 
antee individual and collective rights to each and 
every one of them, but not necessarily the right 
to territorial autonomy, which only shifts the 
problem by creating a minority within a minority. 
There should be a long-term commitment on 
the part of the United Nations to make sure that 
this law is respected on the ground: This regime 
should be applied wherever the problem arises, 
not only where conflicts have already erupted. 
Bosnia 1s the only existing multinational state in 
central Europe, and should be protected as such. 
Here too, the United Nations should make a 
long-term commitment through some form of 
mandate arrangement. 
Some might say that this is a utopian view. It 
is true that the forces opposing such a solution 
currently have the upper hand. But if action is 
undertaken, there is no other aim it can pursue. 
The only alternatives are expulsions, “ethnic 
cleansing” and wars everywhere. [|

T O longer can anyone plead igno- 
rance of what is going on in Bosnia 
today or of what is at stake there. 
No longer can anyone maintain that there 
is nothing to choose between the lawful 
representatives of the sovereign state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the massed forces 
of “ethnic cleansing” that are near to having 
destroyed it. 
The international media have seen to 
that: the press and, more especially, radio 
and television show us day in and day out 
how the tide of horror is inexorably rising, 
detailing the plight of the refugees, the con- 
centration camps, the murders of children 
and the mass rapes; writers and artists of all 
political persuasions are becoming per- 
sonally involved; and the resolutions of 
the United Nations Security Council are 
becoming increasingly urgent. 
Everyone has now begun to realize that 
what 1s happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is much more than a local conflict between 
rival communities; it is the clash of two 
outlooks that exist in all societies the world 
over: one that 1s humanist and open, and 
that opts for pluralist democracy, and, on 
the other hand, one that yields to the temp- 
tation to create a supposedly “pure” ethnic 
entity by force. Everyone knows—politi- 
clans in particular—that there is nothing 
more contagious, in the long run, than that 
temptation, and that there is no greater 
threat to world peace, as the Holocaust of 
fifty years ago reminds us. 
How isit, then, that the irreparable has 
been allowed to happen? How has it come 
about that victory seems to have been con- 
ceded de facto to the ethnic cleansing cam- 
paign? 
Why, despite the total involvement of 
the mass media, whose awesome power 
has recently been brought to bear to alter 
decisively the course of world events, has 
nothing been done to prevent a disaster 
that everyone foresaw and everyone has 
denounced?

"A PROTECTIVE FRAMEWORK 
| 
JANUSZ SYMONIDES, 
an internationally known 
Polish lawyer, has been 
Director of UNesco's Division 
of Human Rights and Peace 
since 1989. He is the author of 
more than 350 publications 
(including 17 books), on 
human rights, international 
control, the law of the sea, the 
protection of the environment, 
international security, and the 
theory of international 
relations. 
NTERNATIONAL regulations concerning the 
protection of minorities go back to 1555 
when, for the first time, the Peace of Augs- 
burg provided for the protection of religious 
minorities. Later the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 
and the Polish-Russian Conventions of 1767 and 
1775 guaranteed rights of dissidents in Poland, 
while the Vienna Treaty of 1815 gave religious 
minorities not only freedom of faith but also cer- 
tain civil rights. Again, relatively far-reaching 
obligations concerning the protection and equality 
of all subjects were imposed on Turkey and the 
Balkan States in 1878 by the Treaty of Berlin. 
The struggle of various national and religious 
minorities to establish their independence in 
Central and Eastern Europe was a prominent 
factor in the First World War. Post-war treaties 
provided for the protection of racial, religious or 
linguistic minorities in these newly independent 
states. The League of Nations was to supervise 
imposed obligations, and violations were subject 
to action by the League. 
The United Nations Secretariat in 1947 took 
the view that the League of Nations minority 
system had ceased to exist, and favoured a new, 
universal and individualistic conception of human 
rights. United Nations action and standard-set- 
ting instruments were at that time dominated by 
the individualistic concept of non-discrimina- 
tion and equality. The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights did not mention the “protection 
of minorities”, though during the debate pro- 
posals in this respect were presented. They were 
rejected because of a fear that they might create 
incentives for separatist tendencies and move- 
by Janusz Symonides 
ments. In consequence, the Universal Declaration 
contains only general clauses prohibiting dis- 
crimination. 
The concept of protection of persons 
belonging to minorities—but not that of minori- 
ties themselves—was accepted in the Interna- 
tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which declares: “In those States in which ethnic, 
religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons 
belonging to such minorities should not be denied 
the right, in community with the other mem- 
bers of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to 
profess and practise their own religion, or to use 
their own language”. 
Similarly, the UNESCO Convention Against 
Discrimination in Education (1960) takes into 
account the right of persons belonging to minon- 
ties: ©... It is essential to recognize the right of 
members of national minorities to carry on their 
own educational activities, including the main- 
tenance of schools and, depending on the educa- 
tional policy of each state, the use or the teaching 
of their own language”. 
Among UNESCO Declarations, two are of 
special importance for the recognition of the col- 
lective rights of minorities: the Declaration on 
Race and Racial Prejudice (1978) which provides 
that “All individuals and groups have the right to 
be different, to consider themselves as different 
and to be regarded as such”, and the Declaration 
of the Principles of International Cultural Co- 
operation stipulating that: “1. Each culture has a 
dignity and value which must be respected and 
preserved. 2. Every people has the right and the 
duty to develop its culture”.

### 94418: A Protective framework

The protection of minority rights has been 
particularly advanced in the European region 
within the Conference on Security and Cooper- 
ation in Europe (CSCE) process. The Helsinki 
Final Act adopted in 1975 proclaimed that: “The 
participating States on whose territory national 
minorities exist will respect the right of persons 
belonging to such minorities to equality before 
the law, will afford the full opportunity for the 
actual enjoyment of human rights and funda- 
mental freedoms and will, in this manner, protect 
their legitimate interests in this sphere”. This 
formulation was in line with the concept still 
prevailing in the 1970s that the elimination of 
any discrimination, guarantees of equality before 
the law, and the full enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms satisfy all claims that 
persons belonging to minorities may present. 
The Concluding Document of the Madrid 
follow-up meeting, adopted in 1983, stressed the 
importance of constant progress in ensuring the 
respect for an actual enjoyment of the rights of 
persons belonging to national minorities. A step 
forward was made during the Vienna follow-up 
meeting. In a new international atmosphere, at the 
time of perestroika and the elimination of ideo- 
logical controversies between East and West, the 
Vienna Concluding Document, adopted in 1989, 
imposed on participating states the duty of cre- 
ating conditions for the promotion of the ethnic, 
cultural, linguistic and religious identity of 
national minorities on their territory. 
The 1990 Copenhagen meeting of the Con- 
ference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE 
assumed that questions concerning national 
minorities can only be solved within the frame- 
work of democratic policies based on the exis- 
tence of a state of law, effective judicial control of 
government, pluralism and tolerance. 
The Charter of Paris adopted by the CSCE 
Summit Meeting on 21 November 1990 con-

firmed that the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and 
religious identity of national minorities should be 
protected and conditions for the promotion of 
that identity should be created. 
In 1992, during the CSCE follow-up meeting 
in Helsinki, a decision was taken to nominate a 
High Commissioner for National Minorities. 
The High Commissioner has no competence to 
ajudicate but only to provide “early warning” 
and, as appropriate, “early actions” at the earliest 
possible stage in regard to tensions involving 
national minority issues which have, in his 
opinion, the potential to develop into a conflict 
within the CSCE area, affecting peace, stability or 
relations between participating states. 
On 18 December 1992, the General Assembly 
of the United Nations adopted the Declaration on 
the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. The 
Declaration formulates the obligation of states to 
protect the existence and identity of minorities 
within their respective territories. Among the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities, it lists: 
the right to enjoy their own culture; to profess and 
practise their own religion; to use their own lan- 
guage; to participate effectively in cultural, reli- 
gious, social, economic and public life, as well as 
in the decision-making process concerning the 
minority to which they belong; to establish and 
monitor their own associations; to establish and 
maintain without any discrimination free and 
peaceful contacts with other members of their 
group or other citizens of other states to whom 
they are related by national or ethnic, religious or 
linguistic ties. 
The importance of this Declaration can hardly 
be overestimated. It is the first comprehensive, 
universal standard-setting instrument dealing 
with the rights of persons belonging to minori- 
ties, and as such it will influence state practice and 
national legislation. nu

UNESCO IN ACTION 
WORLD HERITAGE 
Te High Atlas mountain chain once 
divided Morocco into two distinct parts. 
The area of ample rainfall, bountiful agri- 
culture and placid village life to the north 
was called bled al-makhzan, the land of 
imperial governance. To the south, a 
rocky, sandy and sun-baked expanse 
stretched into the Sahara. This was bled 
al-siba, the land of disorder. 
This geographical dichotomy did not 
always hold, however, as the great four- 
teenth-century Arab thinker Ibn Khaldun 
noted. Often called the father of modern 
sociology, Ibn Khaldun saw fundamental 
differences in the organizing principles 
and cultural bases of city life and desert 
life, but he also found ample evidence of 
parallels, and indeed of a symbiotic rela- 
tionship of such intensity that the 
unfolding of history itself depended on it. 
As he saw it, the seeds of urban culture's

Ait Ben Hadd

highest artistic and political achieve- 
ments, reached only through co-opera- 
tive enterprise, were buried somewhere 
deep in the soul of the lone desert 
horseman. Whenever nomads rode 
together in bands of even five or ten 
men, they incorporated a collective spirit 
and a joint purpose pushing inexorably 
towards a larger design. 
The Moroccan desert is rich in exam- 
ples writ small of what were to be the 
seeds of dynastic urban grandeur. The 
southern oases along the lush green river 
valleys are cultivated with the same 
intensity and ingenuity as the north’s fer- 
tile plains. Clan loyalties once radiated 
from the southern strongholds of the 
local saint in much the same way that 
dynastic loyalties later spread from the 
imperial cities of Meknes, Fez and Rabat. 
Perhaps nowhere are these parallels 
between desert and urban Moroccan cul- 
ture more striking than in a comparison 
of Ait Ben Haddou, a hauntingly quiet 
fortified farming village south of the High 
Cy 1 
Atlas, with the teeming, labyrinthine, 
cacophonous kasbah of old Fez. Both are 
on UNEsco’s World Heritage List, and one 
can visit neither without recalling the 
lessons taught by Ibn Khaldun. 
FE 
ROOFTOP NOMADS 
While Fez has a recorded history, a host 
of founding dynasts known by name, and 
precise construction dates for its earliest 
architecture, we know little of Ait Ben 
Haddou’s Berber past. Its age as a human 
settlement, we can safely assume, is less 
than the geological age of the rock upon 
which it is built, but its proximity to 
known prehistoric sites in the Sahara 
indicates quite plausibly that it is cen- 
turies, if not millennia, older than Fez. 
But we do know that it, like Fez, rep- 
resents the acme of its own particular 
school of high-density, multi-use, envi- 
ronmentally-adapted architecture and 
town planning. Ait Ben Haddou’s desert- 
born model for urban design, applied

with such stunning success to the Fez 
kasbah, dramatically illustrates Ibn 
Khaldun'’s unified theory of civilization. 
For in Ait Ben Haddou city and desert 
living habits meet in unusual concord. 
Densely-packed, multi-storey dwellings 
create an utterly urban atmosphere, yet 
their inhabitants still live something of a 
nomadic existence. In response to 
changing temperatures, they “migrate” 
from room to room, from rooftops where 
they sleep at night to ground-level cham- 
bers where they escape the midday heat, . 
just as pastoralists move about in 
response to climate-induced changes in 
grazing and watering conditions. 
Ait Ben Haddou is by no means 
southern Morocco's only fortified village 
constructed of stone, rammed earth, 
adobe brick and mud plaster. The valleys 
of the Dra, Dades, Gheria and Ziz rivers 
and their tributaries are studded with 
such settlements in all shapes and sizes. 
One stretch of the Dades is in fact known 
in the tourist guides as the “Route of the

Kasbahs”. But the term “kasbah” leads to 
a certain amount of confusion when 
applied to the High Atlas and to pre- 
Saharan oases. The word can lead the 
unwary to imagine mistakenly the maze- 
like alleyways and dead-ends of the 
imperial cities’ enclosed palace 
precincts, now converted to mixed com- 
mercial and domestic use. 
More precisely, however, desert kas- 
bahs are the ex-residences of southern 
Morocco’s once-great ruling families— 
the Glaoui, the Goundafa and the 
M’tougga—usually built to stand alone 
on some imposing mountain spur. The 
only true kasbah of this type that remains 
largely intact is the Glaoui family’s home 
at Telouet. 
 
CASTLES AND KASBAHS 
To describe the full range of southern 
Moroccan architecture, one needs to be 
familiar with two Berber words, agadir 
and tighremt, which refer respectively to 
fortified granaries and the multi-towered 
castles occupied by village headmen, as 
well as with the Arabic words kelaa and 
kasr, which refer to mountain citadel vil- 
lages and to walled oasis settlements. 
The so-called “kasbah” of rural 
Morocco is often in fact a tighremt, con- 
structed usually in the midst of the vil- 
lage. But since village housing is built 
contiguously and shares party walls, it 
becomes impossible over time to tell 
where the tighremt ends and the kasr 
begins. Separate construction thus takes 
on the look of an organic whole. 
Ait Ben Haddou has at least four 
tighremt-like structures. Because the vil- 
lage is built for defensive purposes up the 
flank of a steep hill, the fairly rectilinear 
grid pattern of the typical kasr has here 
been abandoned in favour of a more 
fluid layout following the contour lines. 
As a result it exhibits even more than the 
usual amount of spatial disorientation. 
The view looking down upon the 
multi-level flat roofs from the ruined 
hilltop agadir that overlooks Ait Ben 
Haddou takes in the overall plan of the 
village and the flow of its passageways. 
From this perspective the settlement 
calls to mind a geode, a geological forma- 
tion with which the region is rife, but a 
convex rather than a concave geode, with 
the massed, crystal-like cubic forms of its 
architecture jutting up from the dull reg- 
ularity of the surrounding landscape. 
Village housing displays a perfect 
marriage of form, function, material and 
climate. In view of the latitude and the 
heat of the Sun, the ratio of habitable 
volume to exposed exterior surface is 
maximized by the networks of irregularly 
oriented walls shadowing courtyards and 
second-storey family quarters. Flat open 
roofs provide ample work space and an 
area where grain and dates can be spread 
out to dry. Fresh animal fodder is con- 
served in the cooler, damper ground- 
level store-rooms. 
Sun-dried mud is an ideal building 
material in zones of low humidity where 
there are wide temperature fluctuations 
between day and night. Exterior walls 
heat slowly during the day, but radiate 
interior warmth during chilly nights. By 
morning, the high-ceilinged rooms have 
fully cooled and are comfortable again 
despite the mounting midday heat. 
Ait Ben Haddou is constructed 
mainly of monolithic walls of rammed 
earth—mud, straw, dung and gravel 
tamped into rectangular wooden shut- 
tering—and unbaked, handmade adobe 
bricks. The thick monolithic units are 
generally used for the lower levels and 
outer walls, the bricks for upper walls, 
stairways, partitions and the ever-pre- 
sent surface ornamentation. 
Foundation walls for some of the 
tighremt’s twenty-metre towers are two 
metres thick, tapering to just one brick’s 
width at the top. In a land where plumb 
lines were unknown until recently, right 
angles were considered not worth 
striving for. Instead, the sloping look 
gives the entire kasr a feeling of vertical 
tension and momentum. Against the 
backdrop of the High Atlas, this upward

sweep makes the village appear to levi- 
tate from its hillside setting. 
Because it lies in the Qunila river's 
flood plain, not far from its confluence 
with the Mellah, the village is bifurcated 
by running water. To the east is old Ait 
Ben Haddou, the village of mud brick 
and high walls; on the Ounila’s western 
bank is the new town, built of cinder 
block and concrete slab—cubical too in 
its own modern way, but so much the 
poorer for it. 
The new town looks as if it has been 
hastily erected to serve the needs of the 
busloads of tourists arriving on two-hour 
visits. As such, it serves a necessary pur- 
pose. One hesitates to think how the old 
village's increasingly delicate sociological 
and physical condition could withstand 
the tourist shock—not to mention that 
caused by the many Hollywood film 
crews which have worked here—if drink 
stands and postcard shops had not been 
set at a distance from the village proper. 
Ait Ben Haddou’s ancient half still 
rests on shaky ground. Many of its homes 
have been abandoned by families who 
prefer the new town's piped water and 
electricity. Only six families remain today. 
  
FACING THE FUTURE 
In order to attract the old village's occu- 
pants back from the other side, a new 
organization, the Centre for the Conserva- 
tion and Rehabilitation of the Architec- 
tural Heritage in the Atlas and Sub-Atlas 
Zones (Centre de Conservation et de Réha- 
bilitation du Patrimoine Architectural des 
Zones Atlasiques et Subatlasiques) has 
undertaken a project to rebuild Ait Ben 
Haddou’s mosque and involve the com- 
munity in long-range planning. 
The village needs to offer a balanced, 
low-impact array of tourist services, but 
also to maintain its traditional agricul- 
tural base. The problem is whether, as 
the village leader puts it, the sheep 
stabled in his kasbah’s lower enclosure 
are compatible with paying overnight 
guests upstairs. As for the already aban- 
doned housing, how can mixed-use 
stables, granaries and domestic quarters 
be “retro-fitted” with the physical facili- 
ties—electricity, plumbing, larger 
rooms—expected by both foreign 
tourists and Moroccan home-owners 
accustomed to more modern accommo- 
dation? This is the question that the 
Centre's architects and sociologists are 
now trying to answetr. 
When the Centre asked the new 
town’s residents what improvements 
would be most likely to draw them back 
to their original homes, the mosque’s 
repair was near the top of their list. And 
since the project is now near completion, 
time will tell if it will in itself be sufficient 
to spark a revitalization. But since the 
mosque is without question the village's 
architectural and spiritual centrepiece, it 
is fitting that it should be restored first. 
Over the past few centuries Ait Ben 
Haddou has survived fiooding, siege and 
drought. In the future it faces perhaps 
even more daunting challenges—heavy 
tourist traffic, agricultural obsolescence 
and physical abandonment. But there is 
still hope. Its designation by UNESCO as a 
World Heritage site has brought it to the 
attention of the wider world. And its 
townspeople have taken a stand to pro- 
tect it from reckless change. |

YES TO DEMOCRATIC 
CULTURE 
I read Federico Mayor's Commentary in your 
November 1992 issue with great interest. To 
quote the opening: “A viable democracy is 
inconceivable in the absence of an authentic 
democratic culture. This culture of democracy 
seems to me to be a space that permits the 
synthesis of four fundamental concepts: citi- 
zenship, tolerance, education, and the free 
exchange of ideas and peoples.” The rest of the 
article is in the same spirit. This is encouraging. 
Without such ideas, the world, and Africa in 
particular, will have great difficulty in coping 
with the challenge of the year 2000.

HOW DEMOCRATIC 
ARE WE? 
Your November 1992 issue entitled “The Chal- 
lenge of Democracy” charts pertinently enough 
the vicissitudes of the definition of democracy. 
However, 1 was sorry to see that nothing was 
said about one important challenge harboured 
within our own so-called modern democra- 
cies. Should you not have extended your inves- 
tigations to explore the inadequacies of Western 
democracies? What is the value of democracy 
when political power is in thrall to the power of 
money or when only 40 per cent of the popu- 
lation vote in a presidential election? What lib- 
erty and what democracy exists for the poor and 
the unemployed? Meanwhile, great advocates 
of democracy that we are, we are asphyxiating 
Africa and various developing countries else- 
where. These few examples are enough to indi- 
cate what is wrong with equating Western 
society with democracy.

NO NEED FOR PANIC 
T'was very interested by the ideas expressed by 
the astrophysicist Herbert Reeves in the inter- 
view published in your January 1993 issue. But 
I strongly disagree with him about the danger 
posed by carbon dioxide to our climate. Volca- 
noes were emitting carbon dioxide long before 
we had oil, but nobody has ever claimed that 
variations in the level of volcanic activity could 
explain the ice ages, or the global warming 
experienced when the Roman Empire was at its 
peak, or the many occasions when wine was 
sold by weight in Paris because it was frozen. 
What is more, in twenty years’ time we shall 
no longer be burning oil because everything will 
be powered by nuclear-generated electricity. I 
share Hubert Reeves’ concern for the future of 
humanity. But there is no need to panic.

MYTHS OF THE FLOOD 
[write to strongly protest the clearly subjective 
implications of the wording of the introduc- 
tory remarks to “The Great Flood” in your June 
1992 issue. You twice refer to the event in ques- 
tion as a “myth”, implying that it is a fictitious, 
fanciful matter—one imaginary and unreal, to 
-quote the Oxford Dictionary. However, there 
is certainly sufficient archaeological and 
palaeontological evidence to call into ques- 
tion even the most incredulous of agnostic 
views. Marine fossils at the top of Mt. Everest 
surely provide proof of an historical phenom- 
enon that cannot simply be explained by “con- 
tinental drift".

myths belong primarily to the world of the imag- 
ination. If they preserve the memory of historical 
events, they transpose these events into a per- 
spective that transcends them. These questions 
have been extensively discussed in modern 
studies of mythology by such scholars as Claude 
Lévi-Strauss, Georges Dumézil and Mircea 
Eliade. Editor

DECADENCE 
Although not without interest, the themes 
treated by the new-look Courier reflect a civi- 
lization that must be described as decadent, 
since it is composed of people cut off from 
their ontological roots. Our society is a prison 
in which individuals are chained to one another 
and can only break their chains at the expense 
of their companions in squalor. The Courier, as 
I'see it, only serves to illustrate the facilities of 
this prison. So less, please, about television, 
cars and sport and more about traditions— 
our only links, however tenuous, with our divine 
origin.

SOME CORRECTIONS 
Iwas very interested—as I am sure all students 
of Africa must have been—by Caroline Haardt'’s 
excellent piece on the island of Gorée in the 
October 1992 issue. But I should like to correct 
two small details. The phrase “Slave Coast” is 
correctly applied only to the Bight of Benin and 
cannot be extended to far-distant Angola, even 
though the slave trade was practised there. Sec- 
ondly, the capital of French West Africa in the late 
nineteenth century was Saint-Louis, not Dakar 
as the article states. Dakar was only made the 
federal capital in 1902, and became the capital 
of Senegal in 1957.
