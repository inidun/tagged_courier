EAST MEETING WEST is symbolized by antique heads, Hindu and Greek, in this Polish 
poster announcing a special week of activities to promote knowledge and understanding 
of the Orient. During this campaign, organized by the Polish National Commission for 
Unesco, in which the country’s press, radio and TV collaborated, more than 200 talks and 
lectures were given and exhibitions of Oriental art and literature were held. In Warsaw 
an exhibition on the development of Oriental writing and the Oriental book was held at the 
National Museum, and Unesco’s latest travelling exhibition of colour reproductions, water 
colours from the brushes of some the world’s greatest Eastern and Western artists, was on 
view at the International Press Club. The Polish East-West Week was one of the many co- 
ordinated activities through which Member States of Unesco are supporting Unesco's 
Major Project on Mutual Appreciation of Eastern and Western Cultural Values (See page 20)

HE men of our time have been constantly preoccupied 
with the problem of confronting Eastern and 
Western cultural values and of finding a basis for 
fuller understanding between the peoples of these two 
parts of the world. 
The changes which have taken place in recent years 
in the relations between these two groups of peoples in 
every sphere, and the need—recognized ‘by all nations— 
to live together and to give to their peaceful relations a 
spiritual foundation without which they cannot be secure 
have further emphasized this Important trend and led to 
a restatement-of the terms of the problem. 
Mutual understanding between Orient and Occident 
stands on the borderline between two categories of 
questions: questions of cultural values, which have a 
relatively stable content; and problems of relations be- 
tween peoples, whose terms and psychological conditions 
are in full process of change. 
Under its Major Project for the mutual appreciation 
of Eastern and Western cultural values, Unesco’s work 
therefore falls into line with an already powerful move- 
ment to which it offers a focus and a frame of reference. 
It takes care not to separate artificially the two categories 
of cultural and psychological questions. And it calls the 
most enlightened men of East and West to a work of 
joint reflexion; their presence at the same discussions 
and study meetings, in an atmosphere of complete intel- 
lectual freedom, demonstrates the “mutual” character of 
the appreclation Unesco seeks to develop. The spirit may 
be seen both in the meetings or other initiatives arranged 
under UNEsco’s own programme, and in those sponsored 
by its Member States. The same principles are involved: 
to promote intensive study of questions with a general 
bearing and to direct men’s minds towards sympathetic 
understanding of foreign realities, an understanding often 
obstructed by prejudice or resentment. 
THE UNEsco CoURIER has devoted several issues in the 
past to the East-West Major Project of Unesco and to 
the mutual appreciation of cultural values (see particu- 
larly June 1956; January, June 1957; April, June 1958). The 
present issue is a further attempt to present some of the 
important problems which face us today on this question 
and to survey a few of the activities to which Unesco 
attaches particular significance, 
The Fédération des Coopératives Migros in Zurich has 
produced, in French and German, for the benefit of its 
members, an album entitled Asia. In its 208 pages hundreds 
of photographs, 18 colour plates and accompanying short 
explanatory texts (the whole prepared and edited by Jean 
Herbert of Geneva), the album offers a striking panorama 
of the daily life, customs, costumes, people, wild life, art, 
sculpture, industry and many achievements of the countries 
of Asia. The album 1s highly recommended for reference 
as a source of photographie material on Asia. All the pholo- 
graphs published wn the present issue of Tue UNEsco 
COURIER with the following exceptions (pages 1, 2, 8, 18-19, 
23, 28, 30 and 33) were taken from this album. The French 
edition of Asia has been published by Editions Albin 
Michel, Paris, and an English edition is being prepared.

Album can be oblawned [rom Fédération des Coopératives

### 66944: The Days of cultural tribalism are over

THE DAYS OF CULTURAL 
TRIBALISM 
  
  
ARE OVER 
  
  
  
    \ 
  
= Nw EY 7 : 
K.L.M., Amsterdam 
by Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan 
Vice-President of India 
HE days of cultural tribalism are over; 
we no more have separate cultural 
universes. East and West have come 
together, never to part again, and they 
must settle down in some kind of 
peaceful coexistence which ‘will eventually grow into 
active, friendly co-operation. That is essential for the 
future of the world, the welfare of the world itself. 
 
There are many ideas about East and West which are 
somewhat misleading in character. There are some 
people who argue that the East is mystically minded and 
the West is empirical in its outlook, one is more religious, 
the other is more scientific, but these distinctions have 
arisen only in recent times. China has contributed to us 
many great scientific inventions: the compass, vaccination, 
paper, printing silk. India has contributed logic, meta- 
physics, grammar, mathematics. It is in the last three 
hundred years that the Asian countries lagged behind, 
and Western nations made spectacular achievements in 
science and technology, so that the contrast is emphasized 
by the material backwardness of the Eastern nations and 
the progressive character of ‘Western nations. 
This is true only for a few centuries; I remember a 
great statement made by Lord Acton who tells us he who 
looks at the last three hundred years overlooking the last 
three thousand has no proper historical perspective. East 
and West are not categories indicative of different forms 
of consciousness or different systems of culture. They 
are aspects of every human being—religious and scientific, 
spiritual and rational. These represent two sides of 
human nature, but sometimes the emphasis is more on 
the religious side, sometimes more on the scientific side. 
The distinction is only one of distribution of emphasis. 
We have great traditions of idealism from the time of 
Socrates and Plato down to our own day, and we have 
also great scientific achievements made by Eastern 
nations, We should not therefore look upon these 
expressions, these large generalizations, as more than 
working hypotheses. 
Asia is awake, Africa is on the move 
uT now the East is in ferment; Asia is awake, Africa 
is on the move. They both wish to throw off the dead 
hand of the past and join in the stream of human 
progress. There have been political and economic revolu- 
tions and also revolutions of awakened desires, of roused 
hopes. If these longings are not satisfled, if we are not 
able to bring about at least a partial fulfilment of these 
very legitimate aims that Eastern nations today have, 
there will be no security for peace in this world, If we 
want to have enduring peace it is essential for us to 
emphasize the desirability of satisfying these aspirations 
of the nations of Asia and Africa. 
I am glad to note that Unesco has contributed a great 
deal by way of giving scientific advice and technical 
‘assistance to the nations who are demanding develop- 
ment. Yet the difficulties are there, and greater atten- 
tion will have to be paid if this Organization is to be 
global in its character—not merely in its name but in its 
content. This global character ‘will have 
  
    
to be reflected, at all levels, in all matters | Cont'd

essential, we must acquire knowledge, we must learn how 
we can keep ourselves healthy, literate, modernist and 
progressive. We suffer from disabilities, but I should like 
to stress that merely to attain literacy is not enough. 
Plato said in Charmides: “It is not life according: to 
knowledge which makes men act rightly and be happy, 
not even if it be knowledge of all the sciences, but one 
science only, that of good and evil”. Science and techno- 
logy, medicine and surgery, industry and commerce will 
provide us with the framework of our society, but without 
the knowledge of good and evil they will fail us. That 
knowledge is the science which enables us to take interest 
in the pursuit of truth and in curing the ills of sufferin 
humanity. 
One man’s suffering is all humanity’s 
UR intellectual achievements are great and our tech- 
nological advance has been outstanding, yet we live 
on the brink of fear, at the edge of a precipice and 
in perpetual fear of falling over it. We do need therefore 
that this Organization should give ampler meaning to 
certain common concepts which belong to all traditions of 
the world—the dignity of man, the need for compassion, 
understanding. 
We constantly speak of the inward presence of the 
divine in the human being, and all the great religions are 
an invitation to human beings to grow and change their 
nature; though our nature may be limited, we are capable 
of intimate unlimited developments. They tell us that 
human nature need not be what it happens to be at the 
present moment. . There is a capacity for self-renewal in 
the human being. This assertion of the spirit in man 
is the hope of the world.

sometimes in museums, like the one

ers, fruit or Incense are placed 
in pious homage before statues, 
fragments or even empty pedestals, 
Have we not rid ourselves of many pestilences which 
devastated humanity, of cannibalism and head-hunting? 
There was a time when we thought that God would be 
pleased if we sacrificed children on the altar. We thought 
religion would progress and expand by massacres and 
inquisitions. We have grown out of all those ideas, so 
also the idea that ‘war is essential is something that we 
can outgrow. There is no doubt that if human nature 
asserts itself, that if the spirit in man is given scope, this 
greatest pestilence of all ages will also be driven out by 
human effort. 
Man is invincible if his spirit asserts itself. He has 
endurance and the capacity for compassion. He can 
stand up and say, “I will not bow down to the cir- 
cumstances, I am more powerful than the material forces 
which confront us”. Man is higher than the forces which 
overwhelm him. If this principle of the inward presence 
of spirit is taken by us as an assertion of human dignity, 
we will realize the interwovenness of human life. We will 
take seriously the Christian injunction to bear one an- 
other’s burdens. 
If one man suffers, the whole of humanity suffers, for 
all humanity has become one today. It is to the develop- 
ment of the oneness of mankind that 'we must make the 
great contribution. We are passing through trying times, 
our civillzation Is being tested; it may be destroyed or 
renewed. What will happen to it depends on ourselves, 
not on our stars nor upon the impersonal forces which 
surround us. It depends on the spirit of man, on the will 
of man to take these things seriously. I have no doubt 
that we shall march forward and that Unesco will 
contribute to that cultural solidarity which is the 
essential basis of enduring peace.

EOPLE often hear “the East” spoken of as an infinitely complex enigma which only specialists can 
attempt to decipher. It seems to be made up of vast continents unknown seas and enormous 
nations which used to be little heard of, especially as they were often considered merely vague 
and picturesque provinces of empires whose capitals lay in the West. In it live an incredible 
number of extremely varied peoples, speaking a multitude of languages (which are printed in incompre- 
hensible characters). These strange inhabitants are steeped in philosophic, religious and literary tradi- 
tions which are at the same time quite ancient, and yet curiously alive. 
When Westerners were at school, all they were taught about these religions and cultures was the fact 
of their existence, and even this was usually brought in merely as a footnote to a chapter of ancient his- 
tory or elementary philosophy. Monuments had been photographed. Statues and paintings had been 
brought to Western museums and shops. These objects might be regarded as curious or moving; they

Throughout Asia, the artisan 
has always been an artist, 
and the same trades have 
been handed down from 
father to son for generation 
after generation. Thearticle

whether fabric or pottery, 
garment or jewel, is fashion-

might even be admired. But they ‘were considered part 
of the past, and of a rather abstract past at that. 
The history of these peoples? Western schoolbooks 
rarely mentioned it except in relation to the West. The 
Arabs, for instance, appeared just in time to invade 
Spain and fight the Crusaders in the Holy Land, after 
which they left the stage and went back into the void. 
India emerged from a long, legendary, fairy-tale night 
to be exploited from the sixteenth to the eighteenth 
centuries by a number of trading companies. China escap- 
ed from its dreary isolation to ‘welcome the “civilizers” 
of the Opium War; and Japan, symbolized for two cen- 
turies as an armoured Samurai killer of Portuguese 
monks, was given two paragraphs under the date 1853. 
Thus our ignorance can often be explained or excused. 
But it can no longer be tolerated. It appears dangerous 
at a time when real politics are planetary, when the 
words “fate of humanity” are no longer used exclusively 
by moralists but are common in the newspapers in which 
the conscience and the anxiety of our time are expressed 
to a greater or lesser degree. 
Where does East end & West begin? 
VERYONE knows, everyone senses, that peace, general 
progress and world prosperity may depend to a large 
extent on the development, the decisions and the 
accomplishments of certain countries that many of us 
stili locate rather vaguely “in Asia”, or “in Africa”, but 
that no one any longer dares call exotic. The profound 
solidarity of all peoples has become a truism; and even 
if one thinks chiefly of economic solidarity one feels the 
need to know more about one’s neighbours, near or far, 
than just their industrial and commercial status. Many 
are wondering: “What are they really like, these nations 
with whom we are henceforth linked for better or for

of UNEsco, has for several years made special studies of the probtems

worse? What may be expected of them? How do they 
look at the world?” 
But this last question implies a far deeper curiosity 
than that aroused now and then by casual newspaper 
reading or concern for the future. To wonder about the 
views and opinions of a people is to want to know the 
broad lines of its history, its living conditions, its social 
structures, its religious attitudes, its aspirations. 
It would be an exaggeration to say that the varied 
peoples who make up the West know one another really 
well. Their misunderstandings have often been deplored, 
and, when it comes to culture, they are likely to show a 
provinecialism which leads them to be rather neglectful 
of their neighbours’ values. Yet these peoples never 
consider themselves very distant from one another; 
within Europe or the Americas they see no cultural barrier 
difficult to cross if they will take a little trouble. 
But when these Westerners who so strongly sense their 
own basic unity turn toward one or another of the peoples 
of the East, they are completely at a loss. All the keys 
they have to open doors inside their own West seem 
useless where the lands of Africa or Asia are concerned. 
Over there, as they see it, the languages, beliefs, customs 
and races have the peculiarity of being “Oriental”—which 
must mean that they have nothing in common with the 
West, that they stem from absolutely different human 
themes. To learn anything about them one would have 
to start from zero, to set out on a long road of hard study. 
To these Westerners, the East is another world. It is 
another bloc—not hostile, certainly, but radically diffe- 
rent, closed, mysterious. They know that it is possible 
to stay there for a long time without understanding 
anything; certain travellers have furnished the llving 
proof of this. The realization that more than half of 
all human beings are Asiatic, Oriental, is not always an 
encouragement to pierce the mystery; on the contrary, 
it may have the opposite effect. 
East and 'West are vague terms. Where does one end 
and the other begin? Yet the words must have some reality,

at least In people’s minds, since they have been used for so 
long without being worn out, since the “East-West prob- 
lem” has existed. But if we admit that they evoke basic 
differences, and that very often we can say, “This is 
Oriental, that is not,” then we must name the criteria 
for our judgements. At least five criteria come to mind: 
geography, races, languages, religions and social forms. 
Bengali not more Oriental than Gaelic 
E must not put too much trust in “natural” or “ideal” 
frontiers. The difference between East and West 
is certainly not a question of a few degrees of 
longitude east or west of any particular meridian. From 
the point of view of an Italian, Marrakesh is certainly in 
the East, Sydney in the West. "Natural frontiers” shift 
like the others, To Athenians of the fifth century B.c. the 
East meant Asia and the Persian Empire. A thousand years 
later Athens itself, and Byzantium and Alexandria, had 
become part of the East. As for the Persians, they continu- 
ed, as for centuries past, to deal with Turkish horsemen 
and Chinese traders: to them, these were the Orientals. 
Shall we say that today “Eastern” means essentially 
“non-European?” Hardly, for the connotations generally 
linked with the term “Eastern” would not exist in most 
of Africa except those parts where the Moslem religion 
is dominant or the Arabic language is spoken; and 
“Eastern” certainly does not include the territories occupi- 
ed by the American Indians or the Polynesians although 
these are “non-European.” In general, we must admit 
that The East includes Asia and North Africa, without 
stopping to ‘wonder why this Asia includes the Celebes 
and not Madagascar—and especially without supposing 
that a Syrian, a Kirghiz, a Javanese or a Tibetan feels 
himself a membervof a tight “Asiatic” or “Oriental” 
community. 
Races? There is one called yellow, rich in varied 
families, which has always lived principally in Asia and

the Far East. Beyond this we cannot be specific: it is 
clear that races are as inextricably mixed in Asia as in 
Europe. Furthermore, the same races may often be 
found in both continents. Anthropologists talk about 
Mediterraneans, Caucasians or Malays; they measure 
skulls and separate curly hair from straight. What 
conclusions may be drawn from these uncertain classi- 
fications? That the fishermen of Latakia resemble those 
of Barcelona, and the peasants of the Punjab are much 
like the Serbs? And that in the picturesque field of 
appearance, bearing, gestures and costumes the differences 
are much more striking between North and South than 
between East and West? Questions and speculations like 
these will not get us very far. 
There are also languages proper to Asia: Chinese, Japa- 
nese, the Tibeto-Burmese group, the Dravidian group, 
and also Turkish and the Semitic languages, if you will, 
though they are not confined to Asia. But from Lake Van 
to the Deccan Plateau, more than three hundred million 
persons speak languages classified as Indo-Iranian or 
Indo-European, related to all the Latin, Slavic and Ger- 
manic idioms. The East therefore cannot be defined as 
the territory of Oriental languages: our languages, from 
Greek to Gaelic, have no more and no less Oriental an 
origin than does Bengali; and two old nations of Europe 
‘which speak idioms known as Finno-Ugrian, as un-Aryan 
as possible, are no less Western for that. 
As for beliefs, it is not superfluous to mention the 
spread of a religion which defines itself as universal, a 
spread which sometimes preceded, sometimes accompanied 
European commercial or colonial expansion in the East. 
It 1s clear, nevertheless, that in so far as religious tra- 
ditions model the culture of peoples and the face of 
nations, the presence of several million 
Christians does not prevent Japan, China, 
India, Viet-Nam or Indonesia, for instance, : 
from being countries of “Oriental” Cont'd

the most deeply rooted cults, do not necessarily confer 
an exceptional character on countries situated in a larger 
cultural ensemble: an Adriatic country may have a 
majority of Moslems without belonging to the East for 
that reason—just as Lebanon, for example, _derives a 
special personality from its Christian majority, but a 
personality which manifests itself in an Arab context. As 
for small minorities, fervent and influential though they 
may be, it seems impossible nowadays for them to change 
perceptibly the climate of a civilization. If there were a 
million English Buddhists in Great Britain, that would 
not make one Oriental the more. 
On the other hand, everyone remembers that Christian- 
ity was in the beginning just as “Eastern” a religion as 
Islam—or as Judaism, source of both the others. It is 
obvious that the faith which was gradually to animate 
a new Europe seemed at first, to the conscious citizens 
of the Roman Empire, simply one more exotic cult (incom- 
patible, furthermore, with wholesome traditions) among 
all those that exalted Orientals were coming to preach in 
the West. 
It may be replied, not ‘without reason, that in the 
twentieth century the Christian churches consider their 
doctrines radically different from the beliefs most gener- 
ally held, let us say, in India, Tibet or Ceylon. But it 
should be added that the same position would also be 
affirmed, in the very same terms, by the Moslems. It is 
likewise true that if a Japanese speaks of Oriental reli- 
gions he is probably not thinking of Islam any more than 
of Christianity. 
All in all, the criteria on ‘which we presume to found 
so many judgements seem somewhat confused. There 
remains one, however, which Is sometimes presented'as 
surer or more tangible: that of social progress, generally 
linked with industrial. progress. If this yardstick were 
applied, the East would be a vast realm of under-indus- 
trialized nations in which agrarian civilizations and 
feudal or patriarchal societies still prevail. And this, 
incidentally, is why 'we see so many generous persons, in 
Europe and still more in America, explaining to Easterners 
the advantages of modern techniques and the virtues of 
democracy. It would seem, however, that these lessons 
  
nations and conquering commerce, and the power- 
ful European expansion in the Atlantic as well as 
in central Asia and the Indian Ocean, contacts bet- 
ween East and ‘West have become a daily affair. On May 
29, 1453, the Turkish power was installed in Europe for 
more than four centuries, and on May 18, 1498, Vasco de 
Gama landed in Calicut. Peoples, rather than individuals, 
were mutually to discover one another. The West arrived 
in more and more numerous successive or permanent 
delegations, with differing methods but with curiously 
similar aims. In its Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, British, 
French or Russian species, persons in Ormuzd, Goa, 
Manila, Delhi, Canton, Rangoon, Jakarta and Peking 
watched the advance of Europe, 
In most cases, these mass revelations were terribly 
disappointing. As the peoples involved discovered their 
diversity, they saw their differences through a magnifying 
glass but denied all justification for these differences; 
each met the other and was exasperated to find him 
“0 er.” 
The merchants, missionaries, soldiers, contractors and 
judges who landed from Europe were in a hurry; impa-

make others sign. To understand? That takes patience. 
In the eyes of the Indian or the Malay, these agitated 
10 
NY the “great discoveries,” the rise of seafaring 
are addressed to a global, abstract audience, and never to 
one particular people or another. For if there still exists 
a very small number (among the weakest) ‘whose system 
of government does not correspond to accepted popular 
norms, there is almost no country that has not been 
touched or permeated by an industrial revolution ‘which, 
in some cases, took place a long time ago. 
Nobody is entirely unaware of the production of the 
Japanese or Chinese steel works, or of the textile factories 
of Egypt or Pakistan. But in the imaginary portraits 
most Westerners have of Eastern nations, these industrial 
realities seem to count for less than the relics of legend 
and the survivals of the past. On the road to Trombhay, 
the Indian centre for nuclear research, a tourist will 
photograph buffalo carts. On his return he will describe 
the buffalo carts, going into ecstasies over their poetic 
antiquity. He will forget the atomic reactors; he has 
reason to suspect that it is not feudal obeisance and 
caste taboos that make them work. In a word, they do 
not fit in with his picture of “eternal India.” 
Thus the economic lag of certain Asian countries (and 
not of all) takes on enormous proportions in the picture 
we habitually paint for ourselves of the East. This exag- 
geration flatters the good conscience of a West proud of 
its technical advances, and likewise flatters certain of 
its sentimental tastes which are also nourished by novels 
and films. 
A great many Westerners have an avowed or secret 
hankering for a peaceful rural society, for human contacts 
without clashes or surprises within the reassuring frame- 
work of village harmony and family hierarchies—for a 
simple life, slow and regular, with deeprooted customs and 
unchangeable beliefs. Not finding this idyllic existence 
at home, they are prone to look for it in a legendary 
East; and the contradictions that a real East ‘would 
oppose to them might only disturb their dreams—those 
dreams that are also called prejudices. So in their nostal- 
gia for some kind of antique purity, quite honest travellers, 
even men of science, cannot always resist the temptation 
to identify the East with a patriarchal handicraft system. 
If the latter has disappeared from a country, the whole 
nation seems to have betrayed them to wallow in mercan- 
tile regimentation. 
'B From the great discoveries 
to the time of disenchantment 
and enterprising Westerners had not come to understand 
or appreciate. They seemed to be overly aware of the 
differences in his customs, his clothes, his beliefs, his food, 
but were not the slightest bit interested in the reasons 
for this way of life, this religion—in his reasons—no more 
than they were in hls language, his songs, his books. On 
the contrary they preferred, from the start, to teach him 
their practices and their doctrines—all beautiful and good 
things, no doubt, but which had an unfortunate tendency 
to be imposed in the name of one or another far-off 
monarch, or as a clause in a doubtful contract, and in 
a spirit devoid of tolerance. 
Under these conditions, there ‘was room for negotiation, 
astuteness, political or military solutions, but not for the 
understanding of cultures. It ‘was precisely the cultures 
—the art, the intellectual traditions, the history, the 
spiritual life—that the visitors refused to consider except 
in the most superficial fashion, so that they might call 
them unintelligible. 
There were some outstanding exceptions, of which the 
most notable, up to the nineteenth century, were probably 
certain Catholic missionaries. Every time the Jesuits 
could accomplish their work freely—in India, for example, 
or in China, and more briefly in Japan—real human, and 
fruitful, reldtions were established. These Italian, Ger- 
man or French priests knew how to make an honest

lity, religion and thought. In everyday 
organization the dominant element is a |= 
effort to understand the refinements of the Chinese and 
Japanese civilizations, and the elevation of Hindu thought. 
They conceived their mission not as that of masters, but 
as that of collaborators, seeking to adapt the moral riches 
of Christianity to the old traditions of their new lands. 
In India certain of them wrote works in Marathi or 
Tami] which still figure among the classics of Indian 
letters. In China their scientific contribution was parti- 
cularly valuable, and ‘while Japan was still cloistered, 
in the beginning of the nineteenth century, its astrono- 
mers secretly imported the mathematical treatises that 
these Jesuits had composed in (Chinese in their Manchu 
observatories. Only in a very recent period was this 
collaboration renewed and developed, thanks especially to 
the rise of the studies in philology, history and philosophical 
criticism carried on by the scholars known as Orientalists. 
Among the European and American students Who 
harnessed themselves to the essential task of exploring 
the literary patrimony of the peoples of the East—in 
whom most of their compatriots were interested only 
through a desire to exploit material wealth-—several 
became celebrated and exercised an immediate influence 
on the poets and philosophers who read their work. They 
revealed forgotten eras, treasures of thought and lyricism 
whose existence had never been suspected before. 
But in spite of the admirable work of the Orientalists, 
in spite of the new horizons they opened to cosmopolitan 
culture, Europe did not seem in the least to believe that 
their studies had given it any more understanding of the 
contemporary Hindus, Iranians or Chinese. 
Yet we must remember that it is probably impossible 
to penetrate the literature, art and culture pf a people 
whose values one denies from the start, and to whom one 
hardly concedes the right to affirm its personality on any 
plane. Under such conditions a people can be observed

its peculiarities or mysteries. The political and economic 
relations of the West with Asia and Africa were such, 
for 150 years, that it was rarely possible to talk on those 
terms of brotherhood and mutual esteem ‘which are 
essential if understanding is to be reached. The youth 
of Bengal, Teheran or Sumatra studied in the Western 
fashion; they learned that not only mathematics and 
chemistry but also all contemporary literature, all modern 
thought, were Western. A few Europeans delighted in 
The Tale of Genji, but milllons of Japanese read Shakes- 
peare, Gibbon, Goethe, Dickens and Zola. 
And yet Japan had never lost its freedom. Many other 
peoples, living under various regimes that were dependent 
In law or in fact, felt that in matters of culture as well 
as of government they were denied the right to speak. 
They were encouraged to learn (sometimes); they were 
never asked to teach, never asked to explain themselves. 
The most they could do was to give information to such 
investigators as deigned to ask them questions. For the 
rest, specialists would marshal all the resources of 
Western erudition to study their jargon, their folklore 
and their old monuments. Then in the end, in spite of 
so many efforts, functionaries high and low, tourists and 
novelists would complain that they could not understand 
these people—sometimes refined, sometimes backward, 
always secretive, dissimulative, suspicious. 
Any Easterner who might read these lines would see 
certain quite concrete historical situations reflected in 
them. Many Westerners, too, know that such situations 
were at the origin of a great number of resigned judge- 
ments on “psychological barriers” and on the “impene- 
trable threshold” of various “Aslan mentalities.” 
This time of disappointment has not been entirely for- 
gotten. Yet the men of our century have generally recog- 
nized a simple truth often neglected by their fathers: 
that peoples, like individuals, can understand one another 
only as equals.

something of the history of China as the Chinese them-

As for the great religions which, by definition, address

ceremony at Lourdes or Bangkok, or to analyse St. Paul's 
Greek or the Pali of the Buddhist canon. But neither 
the Orient may well be compared with the Christian mysteries 
for both have a religious setting and both relate the divine saga 
of beings whose sacred character is thus indefinitely renewed.

reporting nor literary criticism ‘can presume the right to 
penetrate the spirit of a cult, of a faith, of a church. 
And here again, one can really understand only from the 
inside. The sacred books of Buddhism and of Islam are 
easy to find. Furthermore, Buddhists and Moslems of 
our day frequently compose, for the benefit of outsiders, 
the sort of commentaries and biographies which Western 
writers used to undertake. 
For Hinduism, the documents are still more abundant, 
in varying degrees of popularization. Among them, one 
may easily surmise that it is often advantageous to 
choose works by Hindu authors, who generally do not 
pretend to reveal mysteries or advise practices in the 
inspired tones ‘which certain of their European proselytes 
used to adopt. Fortunately the best Orientalists today, 
on both sides of the Atlantic, are conscientious translators 
and faithful interpreters who do not believe themselves 
either superior or inferior to the spiritual groups they 
are presenting. It may be regretted only that their 
works reach so few readers. : ' 
The situation is the same where philosophies and 
mysticisms are concerned, if one distinguishes them from 
religious teachings properly speaking, Whether one is

Novels, poetry and the drama obviously present fewer 
obstacles. Today as yesterday, every time a Western 
reader has been able to acquaint himself with authentic 
texts, he has drawn joy and profit from them. Unfortu- 
nately good translations are still all too few, and despite 
some real commercial successes, like those of the works 
of Arthur Waley (1), those which do exist are rarely 
published in a format and at a price which would make 
them popular. But several publishers are at present 
making notable efforts in this respect, and the fleld 1s 
one in which Unesco is playing an important role through 
its Collection of Representative Works, an effort is being 
made to enrich the Oriental series of this collection as 
rapidly as possible. 
Doors to Japan’s literary treasures 
T is a mistake, then, to give up the search for good 
translations while comforting oneself with the thought 
that in 10 years the literatures of Asia will be more 
easily accessible than they are today. There are so many 
readers who are hardly beginning to be concerned with 
these literatures that it ‘would be superfluous to pity them 
for lacking the necessary books: To take a single 
example in a language reputed to be difficult, and which 
translators began to tackle only in a relatively recent 
period, Japanese poetry, drama, essays and novels are 
really at the disposal of millions of Westerners who do 
not even seem to suspect it. 
In English, French and German—and to a lesser degree 
in other European languages—these Westerners may read 
the principal anthologies of poetry, from the Man’yoshu 
to the Sir Collections; the novelists and memorialists of 
the Heian period (Murasaki Shikibu, Sei Shonagon); the 
story-tellers and essayists from Kamo No Chomei to 
Yoshida Kenko; the great writers of the seventeenth 
century; novelists like Saikaku; poets like Basho; dra- 
matists like Chikamatsu Montaemon; 
curious writers. of the eighteenth century 
like Uéda Akinari, and so on. As for   
     
contemporaries, several poets have been Cont'd

twenty novels. .

  TWO FACES OF ASIA. When life is good 
the smiles of mother and child reveal a joy 
that words can never express. Around the 
world human needs are inexorably alike— 
love, food, clothing, work, sleep and relaxa- 
“tion. When these are met, life is indeed 
~ good. But Asia also shows the twisted, pain- 
ful face of hunger. Only a decade ago it was 
found that one-third of mankind was con- 
suming three-quarters of the world’s food 
production. Asia, with 559% of the world's 
people, only disposed of 179%. Since then 
food crops have increased—but so have popu-

It must be admitted that these publications are 
insufficilent—and it should be noted in passing that they 
far from equal in number the Japanese translations from 
the literatures of Europe’ and America. But what should 
be emphasized is the resources that they already offer, 
since this quickly-jotted-down list contains key works 
that a Westerner has the right to demand if he is not 
to “ignore Japan.” 
It must be agreed that the best-beaten route to the 
cultures of the East, as to those of the West, remains the 
path through books, even though ‘works of art, song and 
the dance would speak a more direct and more attractive 
language where many people are concerned. In spite of 
the great ease of travel of which the twentieth century 
is so proud, theatrical companies do not move about 
much and, like musicians, hardly visit any foreign cities . 
except the capitals. And in spite of the progress of 
photography and electronics, good reproductions of paint- 
ings and sculpture in the field of Asian art are as rare 
commercially as are good recordings of classical Oriental 
music. 
Aside from such material obstacles, though, is it really 
more difficult to become interested in Chinese painting 
than in the Chinese novel, in Turkish ceramics than in 
Turkish poetry? Does it take more effort to acquire an 
introduction to the music of Eastern peoples than to learn 
something about their literary works? Those Westerners 
who have made up their minds to listen to Indian, Bali- 
nese or Near Eastern music, instead of lolling in lazy pre- 
14 
judices about “monotonous chanting” and “strange quar- 
ter-tones,” perceive that they are entering a musical uni- 
verse which though it is certainly not that of Mozart, has 
beauties which are no harder to appreciate than those of 
Pierrot Lunaire or the Marteau sans Maitre. Once the 
threshold has been crossed, no one will find insurmount- 
able difficulties in obtaining the best records produced 
in Benares, Cairo, Istambul or Rabat—pending the greatly 
Increased number of concerts which are to be organized 
In the West by the Association for Oriental Music and 
the International Council of Music. 
"On the other hand, it is doubtful if any similar 
society will succeed in making known and appreciated to 
an equal degree the innumerable masterpieces which 
sculptors, painters, architects, engravers, weavers, potters 
and goldsmiths have piled up through the centuries from 
Korea to Morocco. Yet many of these treasures enrich 
the great museums of Europe and America; several 
Western capitals have even housed them in special insti- 
tutions where the public may go at leisure to study six- 
teenth-century Persian tapestries or Afghan ivories or 
Tibetan painting. 
But the public does not rush to get in. The audience 
that would be reached, even in small towns and villages, 
by unambitious exhibitlons—particularly of good repro- 
ductions of paintings—would be more numerous; and, as 
experience has shown, it would generally be enthusiastic. 
In this field there is a great task to be undertaken by 
universities, museums and youth movements; we must

hope that the publication of reproductiors and inexpen- 
sive albums will be further developed, and that the prac- 
tice of holding travelling exhibitions may become general. 
But we may conclude, even now, that although the 
avenues leading to a knowledge of the arts of the East are 
not so broad as those which lead to its literatures, they 
are not, any more than the latter, closed or secret. 
Even if he consents to identify his values with those of 
his nation, no man confines himself to those expressed in 
the works and the monuments of the past. He may 
respect these latter, cite them very frequently or vene- 
rate them, without, for this reason, regarding them as 
the total explanation of his acts or the inspiration of his 
whole life. So for anyone who wants to understand the 
peoples of the East to about the same degree as he 
understands his neighbours, a knowledge of their cultural 
history is indispensable. Yet a knowledge of their con- 
temporary development is no less necessary. - 
In other words, Asia and Africa are situated in time, 
and we are now in the second half of the twentieth cen- 
tury. Up to a certain point the prestige of ancient litera- 
tures, the silhouettes of mosques, pagodas, Angkors and 
Boro Budors form a screen between the Western observer 
and the modern countries which nevertheless live on 
other things besides these books and these edifices. This 
word “modern” shocks people who prefer to imagine an 
East opposed to machines, one which is becoming indus- 
trialized in spite of itself under the influence of 
Westerners of the atomic age.

The reality is very different. Certain countries of the 
East have a great lag to make up; but already their 
progress is much more rapid than the experts were pre- 
dicting ten or fifteen years ago. In this field, changes 
hardly obey cultural imperatives; they follow the rhythm 
of investments. On the. other hand, it is true that all 
the countries of the East do not enjoy the techniques and 
the social advantages which characterize “twentieth-cen- 
tury civilization”. But in varying degrees one may say 
the same of all the countries of Europe and America, 
without exception. Even the richest and best equipped 
have their forgotten lands, their anachronistic survivals 
or their underdeveloped classes. And if we are talking 
about the atomic age, no nation lives in the atomic age; 
none yet possesses the new installations or the equality 
in abundance that ought to accompany this age of 
human maturity. 
Westerners know perfectly well that Tokyo, Delhi, 
Peking, Cairo, Singapore and Karachi are living in the 
same century as New York, London and Berne. If is not 
sure that they like to think of these poetic-sounding capi-

as sadly modern, depending on the hour of the day and

what Chinese metal-workers of Japanese salesgirls do 
after work? What kind of homes do they go back to? 
‘What kind of hopes? 
How can we see this total present-day picture: urban 
and industrial life, customs, street scenes and family 
gatherings, flelds and workshops, popular fairs and nation- 
al holidays, the atmosphere in temples and schools? 
Unless we are to set out on a ceaseless round of travel, 
we have to depend on the mass information media, espe- 
cially the press and the cinema; and it seems certain 
that we shall be able to count on them to fulfil this 
essential task. 
Newspapers publish articles on one Eastern country or 
another, and many of these reports are excellent: they 
provide 2 wealth of detail set in an intelligible whole; 
they furnish valuable information concerning living con- 
ditions, political opinions, economic prospects. Illustrat- 
ed magazines have published admirable portraits of a 
family, a village, a countryside. Unfortunately these 
successes cannot erase the memory of other ‘writings, too 
brilliant to be honest, whose authors were obviously less 
anxious to inform than to please. In these cases only 
the strangest and most exceptional characteristics of a 
people, or a city, hold the limelight; the authors seem to 
fear that they would bore their readers if they used the 
more subdued colours which generally convey the ordi- 
nary existence of people and countries. 
Troops of bagpipers & Cossack choirs 
oMETIMES those who want to understand the East 
S even need to be warned against certain documen- 
taries which are both fascinating and scientific: 
ethnographic fllms whose character is likely to be sadly 
misunderstood by the public. For the average cinema- 
goer may have no way of knowing that the Bedouins in 
their tents do not represent “the Arabs”, or that the tiger- 
hunters of Assam do not represent India any more than 
the luxuriously armed tourist they are escorting repre- 
sents the United States of America. On a less scientific 
level, the folklore of many a pleasant short film may 
suggest nations peopled exclusively by young temple 
dancers or tambourine players to spectators who would 
feel indignant if Scotland were symbolized exclusively by 
a troop of bagpipers or the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics by a Cossack choir. 
Western countries never appear either very distant or 
very self-effacing to the inhabitants of Eastern cities 
endowed with American automobiles and enriched with 
products of the mechanical, electrical, chemical and tex- 
tile industries of most of the countries of Europe. In so 
far as the Asian and African nations are in process of 
development, and count on foreign aid to hasten their 
economic equipment, they unleash intense competition 
which, needless to say, goes far beyond simply mercantile 
aims; there is no exporting nation which does not shower 
them with more or less discreet publicity, or provide them 
with goodwill ambassadors or technical missions, some- 
times in impressive numbers. The inhabitant of an 
Indonesian, Thai, Indian, Persian or Arabian city may 
thus have the feeling that the West is with him every 
day, garish or raucous, on posters, on the roads, in the 
shops, in the cinema. To him, the idea of studying this 
West more closely may seem taintly amusing. 
It is clear that trade, consumer goods and even propa- 
ganda do not in any case embody the essential of cultural 
values. But to the man in the street, this truth does not 
always appear to be self-evident. Cultivated people, on 
the other hand, will admit it willingly—that goes without 
saying—and yet their difficulties are none the less great. 
Some of them, who have studied in secondary schools 
16 
and universities of a purely Western type, and who are 
as familiar with Western civilization as with their own 
country, have trouble realizing that they are, after all, 
exceptional, and that the problem of the appreciation of 
foreign cultures has not yet been touched where most of 
their compatriots are concerned. Others seem to feel 
that they know the West thoroughly because they have 
learned a European language. Almost all meet discourag- 
ing obstacles in the history of wars and colonization: it 
is sometimes hard to distinguish between the themes of 
politics and those of culture, and there are in all longi- 
tudes people who prefer to close their eyes and ears to 
the literature or the arts of a nation of whose government 
they disapprove. 
Oriental serenity vs. Rock 'n’ roll 
vc factors explain a certain self-satisfaction, a cer- 
tain attitude of ironic retreat. Intellectual curiosity 
regarding the West is surely not the most prevalent 
virtue in all Eastern circles. The consequences of this 
may be noted in the sweeping judgements which, for 
example, condemn the “Western spirit” whose notorious 
materialism is assumed to characterize Europe and the 
Americas from end to end. To materialism a scandalous 
sequence of other “isms” is usually added: imperialism, 
alcoholism, and so on. A West full of unemployed workers, 
brash militarists, juvenile gangsters and adulterous wives 
surely cannot have much to teach. 
If a man thinks he knows everything about the Wester- 
ners’ will to power and their basic anxiety, he does not 
ask whether something more than mere appetite does 
not lie at the origin of this fever, this spirit of conquest. 
If he identifies the West with its industrial techniques, he 
supposes that it will go on producing machines and more 
machines—useful, dangerous or amusing; he does not 
stop to consider that intellectual, social and even spiritual 
discipline may explain a scientific progress that has been 
developing, after all, for 400 years. 
In other words, to the naive ignorance of many Wester- 
ners concerning the East there corresponds, where more 
than one Easterner is concerned, a partial acquaintance 
with the West, insufficient to prevent serious errors as to 
cultural values. Certain critics, for example, cannot

resist the temptation to oppose the serenity of the Chi-

swami to Hitler, the atomic bomb to Iraq’s sanctuaries of

appreciate the deeper realities where the Western peoples 
are concerned—a history, a life of the mind ‘which are 
not revealed either in propaganda or in the export trade. 
If Europeans and Americans may be advised to try to 
understand a young and lucid East, stripped of its pictu- 
resqueness and “immobility”, then Easterners might well 
take as a temporary theme a mysterious West, charged 
with ancient contradictions and often fonder of pure 
research than of wealth and comfort. It is not a 
question of substituting one cliché for another, but of 
looking for the almost secret truths that are hidden 
under apparently incontrovertible appearances. Thus, 
for example, a man who thinks he has an adequate pic- 
ture of the United States would do well to forget 
Hollywood for a moment and turn his attention to Ame- 
rican poets and American monks; the number of the first 
as well as the second may seem surprising. From an- 
other point of view, an Easterner will doubtless find it pro- 
fitable to try to find out what romantic German music 
means to the millions of men and women, from Moscow 
to Buenos Aires, who listen to it with such tireless fervor. 
In the West as in the East, everyone educated enough 
to measure the extent of his own ignorance ought to be 
able to replace accepted ideas with the personal study 
that is In every case deserved by other peoples... their 
books, their paintings, their music, their systems of 
thought, their ways of living. Schools, publishers, and 
various national and international organizations will 
doubtless be called on to furnish the means and the 
opportunity for this study. Naturally, each of us will 
remember that it is always wise to suspend judgement 
—on men and on cultures—until one has read, seen, 
listened and understood. . 
One final question: If we follow UnEsco’s suggestions—if 
we try to see the nations of the East in their historical 
reality, and to understand their cultures as broadly as is 
possible for a non-specialist who is simply curious about 
the works and the ways of his fellows—if we do this, what 
will we have achieved? ‘What will be the result of these 
explorations? 
One might solemnly reply that we twill have contributed

to the coming of a peaceful civilization, global, and fra- 
ternal. That is possible, after all. But it is more certain 
that there are some very simple qualities to be acquired, 
some virtues which are not so common: modesty, for 
example, and tolerance. No one is so vain of his nation- 
al culture as he who knows no other; conversely, it is 
difficult not to respect a people whose masterpieces one 
loves, whose joys and sorrows one senses. 
To know the literature, the arts, the thought of a 
nation, to know its traditions, its teaching methods and 
its social problems, its costumes and its cooking—none of 
this necessarily brings about any practical consequences. 
Ordinarily these studies have the effect of refining the 
intelligence and sensitivity. They teach that men must 
not remain strangers to men. They lead one to realize 
that there is a human unity, rich in numerous forms 
‘which struggle against monotony. They lead one to per- 
ceive this unity in the highest works of peoples, and not 
only in their elementary needs. 
The people of a country, a city and even of a street 
are extremely varied and unpredictable; ‘we shall never 
really know them. Yet knowing what they admire, what 
is recited, read or sung around them, we are not ignorant 
of them either. Furthermore, 'we will judge them the 
less summarily as we know these things a little better. 
To esteem is not always to judge. The cathedral of 
Chartres and the tragedies of Corneille, Hamlet and the 
Novum Organum, the Well-Tempered Clavichord and the 
Critique of Pure Reason do not permit us to judge the 
French, the English of the Germans of today; and one 
‘would generally be wrong to judge Westerners by their 
poems or their theologies. 
Yet these works, these monuments, these revelations 
are the patrimony of Westerners; if not examples and 
terms of reference for them, at least living and fruitful 
images. It is worth the trouble to familiarize ourselves 
with the corresponding images which inspire the peoples 
of the far-off East, in order to understand them and 
know what aims these peoples set for themselves. Per- 
haps we shall then understand that this patrimony 
belongs to us too, and that these aims are in reallty 
our own.

### 66947: UNESCO's East-West Major Project

UNESCO'S EAST-WEST MAJOR PROJECT 
by Jacques Havet 
HE march of history has reduced physical distance, 
T multiplied the exchanges between peoples and the 
opportunities for useful communication, but it has 
also increased the risks of tragic misunderstanding. 
Oriental and Occidental people now belong to the same 
world, and this evolution must lead to solidarity. 
But the West does not yet know the East. The studies 
of Eastern civilizations made by scholars through cen- 
turies have too often escaped the notice of the general 
public. The basic culture of the man of the West 
remains centered on a limited heritage. Prejudices and 
erroneous ideas continue to circulate. 
The East, thrust daily into the presence of the West, 
too often sees only an incomplete and distorted image. 
The conventional picture that the cinema, press and 
radio offer is added to the image left from the times of 
trading and colonialism. TUnavoidably, the picture of the 
West that predominates is that of a technology, detached 
from its intellectual and spiritual bases. 
In November 1956, UNEsco’s General Conference meeting 
in New Delhi decided that the Organizatiog should con- 
cenfrate important resources during the next ten years

on activities that would contribute to a closer relationship 
between the East and the West. The entire Organization, 
including groups working with it in each country, would 
participate in this common enterprise. This appeal for 
concentrated and continuous action is the meaning of 
UnEesco’s “Major Project for Mutual Appreciation of Cul- 
tural Values of East and West”. 
For Unesco, three important points emerge from the 
conclusions submitted by an international advisory 
committee which was set up to give guidance in the 
implementation of the major project. Firstly an effort 
must be made to eliminate prejudices and replace them 
with knowledge of established historical and sociological 
facts, Secondly an understanding of the spirit of each 
culture, the way of life and the manner of thought and 
feeling of each people must be promoted by presenting 
facts in the perspective of history, geography and social 
and economic conditions. Finally, more ways must be 
developed to inform the general public in each country 
about the most remote cultures. 
In this ten-year programme, the spreading of factual 
knowledge of all the cultures plays an important role. 
But there can be no substitute for direct contacts between 
human beings, the actual experience of meeting and 
talking together; only that can bring about, in the words

of the advisory committee, a “new spirit” in relations 
between the peoples. 
This programme involves, first of all, the basic studies 
and research needed for a proper understanding of the 
meaning of East-West rapprochement; the investigation 
of certain obstacles impeding mutual understanding; and 
an elaboration of the cultural values of different peoples 
sO as best to interpret them to the general public in other 
ands. 
Plans already under way include international talks, 
social science studies related to the evolution of the 
modern East, fellowships for study and research on 
various civilizations, and listing of the principal reference 
works — encyclopedias, histories, etc. — of greatest use 
to the layman. Later, new activities will be added: a 
survey of the teaching of Eastern and Western literatures, 
fellowships to train more translators capable of present- 
ing to the Western public the great representative books 
of the East, the development of university institutions 
for the study and presentation of cultural knowledge of 
different regions and the organization of exchanges 
between them. 
The education of children, whose minds are still unpre- 
judiced, is an important field for long-term action. 
Curricula, textbooks and other teaching materials, and 
teaching methods, must be revised and adapted to that 
objective. Unesco distributes materials, makes sugges- 
tions and organizes teachers’ conferences to this end. 
In many countries “associated schools” serve as a test- 
ing ground for the principles developed by Unesco. These 
will continue, on an experimental basis, to help in 
improving the teaching of cultural values. Member Sta- 
tes will be asked to produce books about their cultures for 
use in the schools of other countries. Unesco will publish 
brochures for the use of teachers and pupils. 
Groups concerned with adult education and youth activ- 
The Unesco Courier. — December 1958 
ities are receiving help and suggestions from Unesco for 
meetings and study courses among their leaders, for the 
preparation of material on cultural values; for the devel- 
opment of exchanges among their members, activities 
which may help to introduce into the life of a given 
community some of the cultural riches from other areas. 
For the general public, a programme for translating 
the great works of modern and classical literatures of 
East and West is now being developed; albums are pub- 
lished to spread knowledge of little-known masterpieces 
of art, travelling exhibitions of art reproductions in 
colour, are circulating in Member States. The most 
recent one shows water colours of both East and West. 
Unesco is to publish materials for projection, and inex- 
pensive volumes to give the public easy access to this sort 
of material. In 19359, two parallel series of popular works 
will be undertaken, in which each book will present a 
historical panorama of the art or literature of one 
country of the Orient. 
Articles and sample broadcasts are being provided for 
journalists and radio producers of East and West. UNEsco 
promotes co-operation and exchanges between them, pro- 
duces programmes of comparative music and documentary 
film. Unesco is compiling lists of films for public screen- 
ing or TV, classified according to their cultural values. 
These are the principal aspects of a co-ordinated effort 
which should provide a basis or an example for activities 
by Member States either in their own countries or on an 
international scale. 
UnEesco’s project is a long-term enterprise, but there is 
already progress which promises well for the future—the 
development of new habits, the broadening of public 
awareness of the need for better understanding between 
East and West, an increase in cultural materials that can 
lead to a genuine knowledge of the values of East and 
West, and a weakening of the most dangerous prejudices. 
NEW SKYWAYS are today opening up areas of Asia which only a few years ago were isolated or even inaccessible. Asian 
countries are planning and building railways, roads, canals, harbours and airfields for exploitation of natural resources, the 
setting up of factories and the development of home and overseas trade. Below, plantation in Indo-China with its own airstrip.

influences our actions in the present and to a large 
extent governs our behaviour in the future. The 
world of yesterday is reflected in the virgin mind of the 
schoolchild or student by his textbooks, and what he 
learns from them will be projected by him onto the world 
of tomorrow. 
‘What the International Advisory Committee on the 
Major Project is interested in is not pure historical 
Research, but the translation of history and historical 
writing into action, the extent to which acquired ideas 
will be practically expressed by an increase or a lessening 
of international understanding. What interests us, above 
all, is contemporary history, history in the making. 
The teachings of ancient or modern history undoubtedly 
help to mould men’s minds and deeds, but their effect is 
usually confined to mental attitudes. They provide no 
spur to direct action but leave in the subconscious mind 
a strange amalgam of sympathy or aversion. They are 
not decisive in producing definite immediate action. 
Our object is to calm men’s minds and ensure peace in 
our time, which means that our activities should be essen- 
tially focussed on contemporary history. 
Not, of course, that we shall ignore ancient or modern 
history altogether—especially 'we Orientals, for whom to 
speak with brutal frankness—the past was the time when 
most of us (were strong and powerful, with the world at

From our history, we can take hope for the future. I, 
a Lebanese, an Asian by geographical definition, find two 
grounds for pride in my country’s history. Every man 
who reads a book or sails the seas owes something to 
the Phoenicians; and we have our share in the fame

flowering of art and science. Forerunners of the 
Renaissance, ancestors in their way of Leonardo da Vinci 
and Christopher Colombus, custodians of the heritage of 
Greece which they reverently transmitted to Europe and, 
indirectly, discoverers of the New World and fathers of 
algebra, chemistry and the pointed arch, the Arabs 
contributed as much as any other people to the world’s 
progress. ’ 
The exploitation of coal marked the beginning of a de- 
cline for them. There was none in their territory (or they 
were unable to find any). In general, they lacked a 
source of energy, and when one was discovered deep be- 
neath the desert they no longer had the means of exploit- 
ing it. - 
There is a lesson to be learnt here. All this power and 
glory, culture and civilization, which once had the mastery 
and were the envy of the world, has shrunk in a bare two 
or three centuries, to a few pages in the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica! Nor is there any civilization or country which 
can be sure of escaping such a twist of fate. 
But we Orientals, reviewing this history, must set our- 
selves firmly against basking in our past glory, using it 
as an excuse for living In a dream-world of yesterday, 
and justitying our inactivity, divisions and vanity, as we 
squander the noble heritage of our ancestors, by flaunting 
the golden pages written by them in the face of the 
marvelling West. What we need is just sufficient history 
. to avoid becoming exclusively concerned with the present 
but not too much to lull us to sleep in a Capuan paradise 
of the past. . ‘ . 
Passions are still hot so far as contemporary history 
is concerned and many of the actors are still living. The 
‘wounds have not yet healed, and conflicts of interests are 
still unresolved. 
‘World developments since 1914 have moved apace. All 
we need do is to consider the facts, look at the map and 
study the statistics. There has been a tremendous uphea- 
val, and this is especially true as regards the relations 
between. the Orient and the Occident. ’ 
The post-1914 period has been marked by the accession 
of a 'whole host of States to independence. The influence 
of the West—or perhaps, to be more exact, one should 
say, of Europe in particular (and, still more precisely, its

military and political presence or entrenchment)—has 
undergone an amazing decline. The contraction of this 
Balzacian *wild ass’s skin” sums up the whole drama of 
modern times. 
In what way can the history of these developments pro- 
mote better appreciation of mutual values? It is history 
in the making, and, in some cases, still to make. To, 
complete it, two lines of action ‘would today have to bé 
contemplated, designed for different sets of school- 
children or students and based on two equally vital prin- 
ciples. 
The first is oblivion. Our memories may be a millstone ° 
round our necks. It is good now and then to deposit 
them in the cloakroom of modern times and let them 
stay there. 
The new conception of history should be based on total 
oblivion of one particular aspect of the past. People 
must forget that they once occupied a country and had 
to govern it by main force, that they exploited it econo- 
mically, humiliated it by all sorts of legal or devious 
discriminatory practices, disparaged its culture and lan- 
guage and cast scorn on its institutions and faith; and 
that it emerges from these passages in its history still 
bruised in body and still suffering from the indignities to 
its pride and self-respect. With all this over and done 
with, there must be no hankering after the past: the 
only possible reconquest is a cultural one. 
What must be consigned to oblivion, above all, is the 
concept of racial superiority, and those red, green and 
blue patches which pictorially symbolized servitude or 
domination, the relationship of the lord to his serfs or 
slaves, on yesterday's atlases and wall maps. I do not 
think I am being over-paradoxical in stressing this seem-

ingly trivial aspect; but who can say how much harm 
has been done to the world by this insidious colour-mania 
—a symbol of possession for the one and a badge of shame 
for the other? Our eyes must be trained to see with a 
new vision. co 
History textbooks more than any others, reflect the 
spirit behind them. We can count on the full support 
and honest co-operation of all governments in the Orient 
or the Occident in inculcating this spirit in their schools, 
colleges and universities; and the rising generations, 
having unlearned hatred or contempt, will extend the 
hand of the friendship to each other across the seas. We 
shall have restored the bridge of love and friendship. 
I note with alarm, however, that so far I have mainly 
expressed the Oriental point of view, much as I wanted 
to slough off my old self: I would be setting a bad 
example, if I did not manage to shed that skin. 
We are agking the Occident to forget; but we shall ask 
the Orient to remember. That is the second principle. 
We shall ask it to remember all the benefits conferred by 
hygiene, science and education; the roads, ports and 
hospitals that have been built and the modern techniques 
which have been thrown open to it and on ‘which its 
salvation” depends; and to cherish the memory of the 
devoted service given by teachers, doctors and missiona- 
ries, or even by soldiers who ‘were all three in one. Nor 
should it forget—however paradoxical this may seem—that 
from its struggles as well as from the 
example set it has often acquired a sense 
of dignity and an understanding of Cont'd 
freedom, and become conscious, through its on 
tribulations of its historical, political or next page 
national personality.

THE ORIENT TODAY 
AND YESTERDAY 
(Continued)     
The Occident never succeeded in hiding its true face 
behind the mask it presented to us, and it reassumed its 
true character whenever it dropped that mask in moments 
of relaxation. These brief moments of truth enabled us to 
model some of our own features on those of the Occident, 
or rather to rediscover them, buried as they were under 
centuries of servitude and oppression. 
Especially must we not forget the language which was 
prought to us, and through which we have made contact 
with the new era; there is not one of us who does not 
owe something in his educational make-up to that contri- 
bution. For myself, it is so much part and parcel of me 
that I cannot speak of an outside contribution to designate 
that language which has put us into touch with all the 
technical and humanistic sciences and glorious new fields 
of intellectual activity and enabled us to profit by the 
fruits of world endeavour, to assimilate the achievements 
of mankind as a whole and to merge them ‘with our own. 
Certain considerations should be singled out for special 
study. In particular, action must be taken to combat dis- 
crimination. This new word for a very old phenomenon 
still awaits precise definition. In essence, it covers in- 
equality of treatment based on prejudice, the prejudice 
often being nothing more than a philosophical cloak 
masking concrete material interests. Anything done in 
this fleld will have a very beneficial effect. 
Injured pride is at the root of very many of the mis- 
understandings existing between Orient and Occident. 
Until recently, the Westerner, and more particularly the 
European, was the master of the world, and the fount of 
all power. That situation lasted for two or three gene- 
rations. How could it fail to produce a certain sense of 
superiority, conscious or unconscious, which was bound to 
be reflected in action, 'whether in a crude, concealed or 
even in a courteous manner. It is this feeling which must 
be overcome on the part of the Occident, and the way 
to do it is by explaining the historical facts. 
We Easterners, too, are very sensitive on this point. We 
often—all too often—give the impression of having been 
flayed alive: the slightest remark upsets and irritates us. 
Years and sometimes centuries of contempt or insult have 
left us with hypersensitive skins. We are no longer 
content with anything less than superlative praise. Our 
accession to independence has transformed us neither 
into States nor nations, nor into perfect beings. 
It is understandable, after all, that in the first flush 
of our recovered freedom, we should have let ourselves 
become intoxicated by the magic of the word and the 
reality of what it stood for. But today, one of the condi- 
tions for our survival and salvation is that we should see 
ourselves more clearly, and expose and fight against our 
failings, weaknesses and indeed faults, accepting and in- 
viting criticism, comment and even friendly raillery. 
* 
HAVE referred particularly to action among school- 
I children and students. This must be supplemented 
by another form of action relating to another gen- 
eration entirely. Here we come up against a new pro- 
blem: that of the discontinuity of history. 
The world does not stay still between the time we leave 
the schoolroom or the university and the time when we 
play an active part in life. The fact that the historical 
process has quickened is now generally accepted. By a 
sort of process of osmosis or contagion which can be 
traced back to modern techniques, history has been shar- 
ing in the effects of the acceleration of means of commu- 
nication and information media. 
Modern man has little time for reflexion, and the states- 
man is no exception to the rule. It needs a prodigious 
effort of energy and will on his part to turn inwards and 
make a calm, careful and objective study of the facts. It 
is even more difficult to look beyond national boundaries 
and draw overall conclusions from unco-ordinated events 
taking place in the four corners of the earth. 
There is a wide gulf between what the student has 
learnt and what the man of action has failed to learn 
and assimilate in a world which is in rapid and perpetual 
24 
Let the Occident forget 
and the Orient remember 
motion. All this is even truer of the relations between 
the Orient and the Occident. 
_ We must think in terms of a revision of modern history 
in respect of Orient-Occident relations, for the use of 
adults. Let us be bold innovators in this respect. 
‘What I have in mind would be the selection of a group 
of Easterners, a body of travelling professors or lecturers, 
as it were, ‘who (would give courses at universities but 
whose main role would be primarily that of missionaries. 
They would act in a missionary spirit, and their courses 
would have to be -fairly widely publicized. They would 
spend a year in each country giving their audiences an 
accurate picture of developments in their native lands. 
There remains one final aspect: future prospects. What 
we have to do, I suggest, is to write the history of future 
relations between the Orient and the Occident—and this 
without having recourse to fortune-tellers, seers or pro- 
phets! 
Not that we can work out this history of tomorrow in 
detail, but its main lines of development can be foreseen. 
Once we have forgotten 6r unlearnt hatred, we shall have 
to build anew; and, in that connexion, we shall have to 
demonstrate, by suitable examples, the impossibility of 
nationalistic isolation. 
HIS brings us to a delicate point. There can be no 
| denying that there is a rising tide of nationalism 
over a large part of the globe. It cannot be turned 
back, and it is useless to oppose it: it must be harnessed. 
Nationalism is out of date. It has come too late in a 
world which is too old. It is, in any case, a necessary 
stage, and the wise course might be to shorten that tran- 
sition from one state to another as far as possible. But 
it would be futile to ignore it, and even more so to 
discount it. 
Nationalism has not always been solely a reaction 
against the Occident. The Arab countries, for example, 
languished for centuries under Oriental oppression. Their 
nationalism is a phenomenon which retains its purity just 
because it is not channelled in a single direction. 
It has to be accepted, as a necessary good or evil. And 
I really mean “necessary”: even if it Is an outmoded 
concept made obsolete by the advance of modern thought 
and science, a dose—or fit—of nationalism enables coun- 
tries which have just achieved independence to gain a 
clearer knowledge of themselves in all fields, and espe- 
cially in the cultural field. They rediscover their lan- 
guage, their literature, their poets, their historians and 
(more rarely) their scientists. 
This reawakening sometimes has its childish aspects. 
Let us see to it that there is nothing repugnant about 
it and that it is free from the excesses ‘which sometimes 
result in condemning the use of Arabic figures in the name 
of Arab nationalism, or others of the same kind—which 
incidentally, are now on the wane, even where they have 
been found. 
Once this outburst is over, another aspect of the prob- 
lem arises: the need for close collaboration in all, fields 
and especially in that of culture, for exchanges in all 
forms, for interpretation and interdependence, for action 
directed along two distinct but not contradictory lines. 
Such is the first task in which a little nationalism does 
not come amiss, to bring about the revival of a country’s 
culture and restore to it its former glory (for all cultures 
are glorious), to invigorate and foster it, making it dyn- 
amic, modern and inspiring through contact with other 
cultures—in our case, the Western cultures or culture. And 
this must be done straightforwardly and candidly with- 
out ulterior motives, and with that feeling of respect 
which is essential in any task. True there must be no 
© imitation, but neither must there be any hesitation in 
learning. 
What we have to do, above all, is to drive home the need 
for human fellowship. That is yet another elementary 
truth, but it seems essential today to repeat such truths 
continually. They are accepted in principle but ignored 
in practice.

[n the mountain-rimmed, open spaces of Mongolia, children learn to ride when they are four or five years old on ponies which 
are famed for their speed and hardiness. Automobiles can be used, even without roads, over great stretches of the flat dry 
country, but the people rely mostly on horses for transportation and the mail is usually carried by men on relays of horses. 
by K.D. Erdmann 
Professor of Modern History, University of Kiel, Federal Republic of Germany 
ince the middle of the 18th century, Europeans 
have become accustomed to arranging the history 
of civilizations in a series which, ‘while chrono- 
logical, also signifies a grading of values. The 18th 
century French statesman and economist, Turgot, 
himself visualized the evolution of history in three stages, 
namely, the theological, metaphysical and empirical eras. 
As empirical knowledge developed in Europe, Europeans 
felt justified in considering themselves in the forefront 
of progress and looking down on other civilizations as 
backward. 
This outlook is aptly described in the following terms 
by Paul Hazard in his book on La pensée européenne au 
XVIIIre siécle : “The virtuous Chinese and the wise 
Egyptians were for ever being praised; but it had to be 
admitted that neither China nor Egypt had fulfilled the 
promises of early days. They had remained sunk in iner- 
tia, while the West had displayed tireless intellectual 
26 
curiosity. It had never ceased to do so, so that the 
Greeks and Romans themselves were surpassed by the 
present... and thus the new Europe was better than the 
old... Not that its sons were ‘without faults. Restless 
and excitable, their history was one of incessant revolu- 
tions and their annals a tissue of misfortunes, follies and 
crimes. Corrupted by luxury, they cruelly exploited the 
inhabitants of the colonies they had conquered. Yet they 
retained the right to be proud of themselves. Why had 
the Asians and Africans not anchored in their harbours, 
conquered their territories and imposed their authority 
on the local princes? Because the Europeans were 
stronger and they were stronger because they were wiser; 
being wiser, they represented a more advanced state of 
civilization.” 
This conviction of the superiority of the progressive 
European spirit over people of other civilizations has been 
very forcibly expressed in Hegel's Philosophy of History.

He took ‘freedom as the central theme of history. The 
essence of world history was, according to his famous defi- 
nition, progress in consciousness’ of freedom. He consi- 
dered that history began in the Far East and then advan- 
ced through the Near East, Greece and Rome, to culminate 
in European civilization. He did not see cultures on the 
same level as different possibilities inherent in Man’s na- 
ture of representing himself and interpreting his position 
in the world; on the contrary, looking back from the cul- 
tural heights of 19th century Europe, the old civilizations 
of Asia and ancient European cultures appear as histori- 
cal stages which have been left behind. 
All of us have had numerous occasions to realize that 
the end of European colonialism does not mean the end 
of the process of Europeanization which began to spread 
through the world a century ago. On the contrary, this 
process has been accelerated since the freed peoples of 
Asia have themselves taken over, with all their energy, 
the rebuilding and modernization of their economies, 
States, and societies. No one can foretell the fate 
of these peoples’ ancient philosophical, religious and 
artistic inMleritance or foresee, whether a civilization, 
forming a new chapter in human history, will 
emerge from this confrontation. 
In order to see the relationship between East and West 
in proper historical perspective, however, it must be rea- 
lized that the development of modern technology means 
a profound incision, not to say a break, even in Europe 
itself. The life of a modern European is further removed 
from the life of a townsman or countryman of Goethe's 
day, some 150 years ago, than the life of the latter was 
“from that of a European in the early Middle Ages, a 
thousand years ago. It is becoming increasingly clear 
from historical research that the real turning point in 
European ‘history was not in 1500, between the Middle 
Ages and modern times, but at the time of the great 
industrial, political and social revolution of the 18th and 
19th centuries. 
Man has taken it upon himself to burst his natural 
bonds and to conquer time and space. Like technology, 
economics and society have been drawn into the sphere 
of planning and calculation. Our age is dominated by 
technical considerations of a utilitarian nature and not 
by respect for inherited values and traditions. For a 
thousand years, the basic element of the European social 
system was seignorial right and the privileged urban 
community. This system, on ‘which the old European 
culture was based, has vanished. A propertied and edu- 
cated middle class and after that the working class, have

come to the fore as the determining factors in history, 
and the process of social revolution, which began 
150 years ago, has not yet come to an end. Educators 
throughout the Western world are wondering what will 
become of Europe’s cultural and educational inheritance 
and whether, for example, a classical education has any 
real chance of survival in the present-day world. 
In this uncertainty about its present-day civilization, 
Europe is in a position which, despite all differences, is in 
a sense comparable with that of the peoples of Asia, with 
their ancient civilizations, ‘who are in process of becoming 
Europeanized. All civilizations are today facing the same 
problem, namely, how to preserve an old and hallowed 
cultural heritage, handed down through the ages, in our 
modern world of technology and bureaucracy, and whe- 
ther it is even possible or desirable to preserve it. Do the 
peoples of East and West realize that they are in the 
throes of the same cultural crisis? 
For the Westerner, it may be said that the fascination 
of Asia lies in its traditional culture—its old religions, phi- 
losophy, wisdom and art—in comparison with which 
modern Asian culture and Asian present-day problems 
are unfortunately given less weight. Conversely, is it not 
true that the attraction of Western civilization for the 
ian peoples is to be attributed almost entirely to modern 
scientific and technological progress, which has made 
them forget the old European values? 
Here, it appears necessary to establish a balance and 
this might be a special task for Unesco under its East- 
West Project. The Westerner, who looks upon free Asia 
as an area where a great and immensely important move- 
ment is going on, must recognize that the attempt of the 
Aslan peoples to reconcile their venerable cultural tradi- 
tion with present-day industrial and technological needs 
is a matter which concerns him also. Whether this 
reconciliation is everywhere desired and whether, where 
it is desired, it will succeed, is another question. 
This aspect of the Asian situation is important to the 
modern Westerner, concious of his own cultural problems. 
On the other hand, I wonder how far the Asian peoples 
in process of adopting Western industrial practices and 
technology are aware that this is only one aspect of 
Western civilization. Industry and technology are the 
offshoots of science and the latter is deeply rooted in the 
intellectual, and I might even say spiritual, heritage of 
Europe. A gulf divides the new Europe from the old and 
yet modern Europe draws its life-blood from its intellec- 
tual past and its historical legacy.

### 66951: All men are brothers: UNESCO's tribute to Mahatma Gandhi

ALL MEN ARE 
BROTHERS 
UNESCO'S 
TRIBUTE TO 
MAHATMA GANDHI 
Unesco is paying a special tribute 
to Mahatma Gandhi. It renders 
homage to both the person and the 
writings of a man whose spiritual 
influence has extended throughout 
the world in a new book entitled 
All Men Are Brothers, which pre- 
sents the life and thoughts of the 
great teacher as set down in Gandhi's 
own words. The aim of the texts 
is to illustrate and make better 
known the different aspects of 
Gandhi's personality and writings. 
The English edition will be followed 
by French and Spanish versions 
(See page 35). On pages 30 and 3 | 
we publish a selection of Gandhi's 
thoughts taken from All Men Are 
Brothers. The complete introduc- 
tion to the Unesco volume specially 
written by Sir Sarvepalli Radhak- 
rishnan, Vice-President of India, is 
presented on the opposite page.  Henri Cartier-Bresson © Magnum Photos

is ~ Grear teacher appears 
: once in' a while. Several 
centuries may pass by 
A without the advent of 
such’ a one. That by 
: which he is known is his 
life. He first lives and then tells 
others how they may live likewise. 
Such a teacher was Gandhi. These 
Selections from his speeches and 
writings compiled. with great care 
and discrimination by Sri Krishna 
Kripalani will give the reader some 
ideas of the ‘workings of Gandhi's 
mind, the growth and the practical 
techniques ‘which he adopted. 
Gandhi's life was rooted in India’s 
religious tradition with its emphasis 
on a passionate search for truth, a 
profound reverence for life, the ideal 
of non-attachment and the readiness 
to sacrifice all for the knowledge of 
God. He lived his whole life in the 
perpetual quest of truth: “I live and 
move and have my being in the 
pursuit of this goal.” 
A life which has no roots, which is 
lacking in depth of background is a 
superficial one. There are some who 
assume that when we see what is 
right we will do it. Even when we 
know what is right it does not follow 
that we will choose and do right. 
‘We are overborne by powerful im- 
pulses and do wrong and betray the 
light in us. “In our present state 
we are, according to the Hindu doc- 
trine, only partly human; the lower 
part of us is still animal; only the 
conquest of our lower instincts by 
love can slay the animal in us” It 
Is by a process of trial and error, 
self-research and austere discipline 
that the human being moves step by 
painful step along the road to 
fulfilment. 
Gandhi's religion was a rational 
and ethical one. He would not 
accept any belief which did not 
appeal to his reason or any injunc- 
tion which did not commend to his 
conscience, 
A] F 'we believe in God, not 
merely with our intellect 
~ but with our whole being, 
we wili Jove all mankind 
without any distinction of 
. ne —— Bi race or class, nation or 
religion, We will work for the unity 
of mankind. “All my actions have 
their rise in my inalienable love of 
mankind.” “I have known no dis- 
tinction between relatives and stran- 
gers, countrymen and foreigners, 
white and coloured, Hindus and 
Indians of other faiths whether 
  
Musulmans, Parsees, Christians or’ 
Jews. I may say that my heart has 
been incapable of making any such 
distinctions.” “By a long process of 
‘prayerful discipline I have ceased 
for over forty years to hate anybody.” 
All men are brothers and no human 
being should be a stranger to another. 
The welfare of all, sarvodaya, should 
be our aim. God is the common 
bond that unites all human beings. 
To break this bond even ‘with our 
greatest enemy is to tear God him- 
self to pieces. There is humanity 
even in the most ‘wicked. 
This view leads naturally to the 
adoption of non-violence as the best 
means for solving all problems, na- 
tional and international. Gandhi 
affirmed that he was not a visionary 
but a practical idealist. Non-violence 
is meant not merely for saints and 
sages but for the common people 
also. “Non-violence is the law of 
our species, as violence is the law of 
the brute. The spirit lies dormant 
in the brute and he knows no law 
but that of physical might. The 
dignity of man requires obedience to 
a higher law — to the strength of 
the spirit.” 
| 2 © anpHI was the first in 
bie human history to extend 
( the principle of non-vio- 
lence from the individual 
(ir to the social and political 
~.. plane. He entered poli- 
tics for the purpose of experimenting 
with non-violence and establishing 
its validity. 
“Some friends have told me that 
truth and non-violence have no place 
in politics and worldly affairs. I do 
not agree. I have no use for them 
as a means of individual salvation. 
Their introduction and application 
in everyday life has been my experi- 
ment all along.” “For me, politics 
bereft of religion are absolute dirt, 
ever to be shunned. Politics con- 
cerns nations and that which con- 
cerns the welfare of nations must be 
one of the concerns of a man who is 
religiously inclined, in other words, a 
seeker after God and Truth. For 
me God and Truth are convertible 
terms, and if any one told me that 
God was a God of untruth or a God 
of torture I would decline to worship 
Him. ‘Therefore, in politics also we 
have to establish the Kingdom of 
Heaven.” 
In the struggle of India's indepen- 
dence, he insisted that we should 
adopt civilized methods of non- 
violence and suffering. His stand 
for the freedom of India was not 
based on any hatred for Britain. We 
must hate the sin not the sinner. 
“For me patriotism is the same as 
humanity. I am patriotic because I 
an human and humane. I will not 
hurt England or Germany to serve 
India.” He believed that he rendered 
a service to the British in helping 
them to do the right thing by India. 
The result was not only the liberation 
of the Indian people but an increase 
in the moral resources of mankind. 
In the present nuclear context, if 
we wish to save the world, we should 
The Unesco Courier. — December 1958 
adopt the principles of non-violence. 
Gandhi said: “I did not move a 
muscle, when I first heard that an 
atom bomb had wiped out Hiroshima. 
On the contrary I said to myself: 
“unless now the world adopts non- 
violence, it ‘will spell certain suicide 
for mankind” “In any future con- 
flict ‘we cannot be certain that 
neither side will deliberately use 
nuclear weapons. We have the power 
to destroy in one blinding flash all 
that we have carefully built up across 
the centuries by our endeavour and 
sacrifice. By a campaign of propa- 
ganda we condition men’s minds for 
nuclear warfare. Provocative re- 
marks fly about freely. We use 
aggression even in words; harsh 
judgements, ill-will, anger, are all 
insidious forms of violence. 
In the present predicament when 
we are not able to adjust ourselves 
to the new conditions which science 
has brought about, it is not easy to 
adopt the principles of non-violence, 
truth and understanding. But on 
that ground ‘we should not glve up 
the effort. While the obstinacy of 
the political leaders puts fear into 
our hearts, the common sense and 
conscience of the peoples of the 
world give us hope, 
With the increased velocity of 
modern changes we do not know 
what the world will be a lundred 
years hence. We cannot anticipate 
the future currents of thought and 
feeling. But years may go their 
way, yet the great principles of saiya 
and ahimsa, truth and non-violence, 
are there to guide us. They are the 
silent stars keeping holy vigil above 
a tired and turbulent world. Like 
Gandhi we may be firm in our 
conviction that the sun shines above 
the drifting clouds.

The world is sick 
of hatred 
% I have nothing new to teach the world. 
Truth and non-violence are as old as the 
hills. 
* It has always been a mystery to me how 
men can feel themselves honoured by the 
humiliation of their fellow-beings. 
% “Hate the sin and not the sinner” is a 
precept which, though easy enough to 
understand, is rarely practised, and that is 
why the poison of hatred spreads in the 
world. 
% You have to stand against the whole 
world although you may have to stand 
alone. You have to stare the world in 
the face although the world may look at 
you with bloodshot eyes. Do not fear. 
Trust that little thing in you which resides 
in the heart and says: “Forsake friends, 
wife, all; but testify to that for which you 
have lived and for which you have to die.” 
* God has created different faiths just as 
He has the votaries thereof. How can I 
even secretly harbour the thought that my 
neighbour's faith is inferior to mine and 
wish that he should give up his faith and 
embrace mine? As a true and loyal 
friend, I can only wish and pray that he 
may live and grow perfect in his own faith. 
In God's house there are many mansions 
and they are equally holy. 
% Let no one even for a moment entertain 
the fear that a reverent study of other reli- 
gions is likely to weaken or shake one's 
faith in one’s own. The Hindu system of 
philosophy regards all religions as contain- 
ing the elements of truth in them and 
enjoins an attitude of respect and reverence 
towards them all. This of course pre- 
supposes regard for one’s own religion. 
Study and appreciation of other religions 
need not cause a weakening of that regard; 
it should mean extension of that regard to 
other religions. 
* Non-violence is the greatest force at the 
disposal of mankind. It is mightier than 
the mightiest weapon of destruction devised 
by the ingenuity of man. Destruction is 
not the law of the humans. Man lives freely 
by his readiness to die, if need be, at the 
hands of his brother, never by killing him. 
Every murder or other injury, no matter 
for what cause, committed or inflicted on 
another is a crime against humanity. 
* My experience, daily growing stronger 
and richer, tells me that there is no peace 
for individuals or for nations without 
practising Truth and Non-violence to the 
uttermost extent possible for man. The 
policy of retaliation has never succeeded.

### 66951: All men are brothers: UNESCO's tribute to Mahatma Gandhi

— Mahatma Gandhi 
* My love for non-violence is superior to 
every other thing mundane or supramun- 
dane. It is equalled only by my love for 
truth which is to me synonymous with non- 
violence through which and which alone I 
can see and reach Truth. My scheme of 
life, if it draws no distinction between 
different religionists in India, also draws 
none between different races. For me “A 
man’s a man for a’ that.” 
% My non-violence does not admit of 
running away from danger and leaving 
dear ones unprotected. Between violence 
and cowardly flight, I can only prefer vio- 
lence to cowardice. I can no more preach 
non-violence to a coward than I can tempt 
a blind man to enjoy healthy scenes. Non- 
violence is the summit of bravery. And in 
my own experience, I have had no diffi- 
culty in demonstrating to men trained in 
the school of violence the superiority of 
non-violence. As a coward, which I was 
for years, I harboured violence. I began 
to prize non-violence only when I began 
to shed cowardice. 
* Not knowing the stuff of which non- 
violence is made, many have honestly be- 
lieved that running away from danger every 
time was a virtue compared to offering 
resistance, especially when it was fraught 
with danger to one’s life. As a teacher 
of non-violence, I must, so far as it is 
possible for me, guard against such an un- 
manly belief. 
% I am not a visionary. I claim to be a 
practical idealist. Religion of non-violence 
is not meant merely for the rishis and saints. 
It is meant for the common people as well. 
Non-violence is the law of our species as 
violence is the law of the brute. The spirit 
lies dormant in the brute, and he knows 
no law but that of physical might. The 
dignity of man requires obedience to a 
higher law, to the strength of the spirit. 
% Often does good come out of evil. But 
that is God’s, not man’s plan. Man knows 
that only evil can come out of evil, as good 
out of good... The moral to be legitimately 
drawn from the supreme tragedy of the 
atom bomb is that it will not be destroyed 
by counter bombs, even as violence cannot 
be by counter violence. Mankind has to 
go out of violence only through non-vio- 
lence. Hatred can be overcome only by 
love. Counter hatred only increases the 
surface, as well as the depth of hatred. 
* It is impossible for one to be an interna- 
tionalist without being a nationalist. Inter- 
nationalism is possible only when national- 
ism becomes a fact, i.e.,, when peoples 
belonging to different countries have orga- 
nized themselves and are able to act as one 
man, It is not nationalism that is evil, it 
is the narrowness, selfishness, exclusiveness 
which is the bane of modern nations which 
is evil. Each wants to profit at the expense 
of, and rise on the ruin of, the other. 
% Interdependence is and ought to be as. 
much the ideal of man as self-sufficiency. 
Man is a social being. Without inter-relation 
with society he cannot realize his oneness 
with the universe or suppress his egoism. 
His social interdependence enables him to 
test his faith and to prove himself on the 
touchstone of reality. If man were so 
placed or could so place himself as to be 
absolutely above all dependence on his 
fellow-beings he would become so proud 
and arrogant as to be a veritable burden 
and nuisance to the world. Dependence on 
society teaches him the lesson of huma- 
nity. 
* ‘What is the cause of the present chaos? 
It is exploitation, I will not say of weaker 
nations by the stronger, but of sister 
nations by sister nations. And my funda- 
mental objection to machinery rests on the 
fact that it is machinery that has enabled 
these nations to exploit others.

* My notion of democracy is that under 
it the weakest should have the same 
opportunity as the strongest. That can 
never happen except through non-violence. 
* The true source of rights is duty. If 
we all discharge our duties, rights will not 
be far to seek. If leaving duties unper- 
formed we run after rights, they will escape 
us like a will-o’-the-wisp. The more we 
pursue them, the farther will they fly. 
* To me political power is not an end but 
one of the means of enabling people to 
better their condition in every department 
of life. Political power means capacity to 
regulate national life through national 
representatives. If national life becomes 
so perfect as to become self-regulated, no 
representation becomes necessary. There 
is then a state of enlightened anarchy, In 
such a state every one is his own ruler. He 
rules himself in such a manner that he is 
never a hindrance to his neighbour. In the 
ideal State, therefore, there is no political 
power because there is no State. But the 
ideal is never fully realized in life. Hence 
the classical statement of Thoreau that that 
government is best which governs the least. 
* I value individual freedom but you must 
not forget that man is essentially a social 
being. He has risen to his present status 
by learning to adjust his individualism to 
the requirements of social progress. Un- 
restricted individualism is the law of the 
beast of the jungle. We have learnt to 
strike the mean between individual freedom 
ang ‘v .ia) restraint. Willing submission to 
social 1estraint for the sake of the well- 
being of the whole society enriches both 
the individual and the society of which one 
is a member. 
* The golden rule of conduct is mutual 
toleration, seeing that we will never all

Conscience is not the same thing for all. 
Whilst, therefore, it is a good guide for 
individual conduct, imposition of that 
conduct upon all will be an insufferable 
interference with everybody's freedom of 
conscience. 
* Differences of opinion should never 
mean hostility. If they did, my wife and 
I should be sworn enemies of one another. 
I do not know two persons in the world 
who had no difference of opinion, and as 
I am follower of the Gita, I have always

* We must be content to die, if we cannot 
live as free men and women. 
* Even the most despotic government 
cannot stand except for the consent of the 
governed which consent is often forcibly 
procured by the despot. Immediately the 
subject ceases to fear the despotic force, his 
power is gone.

therefore, his country’s and ultimately that

benefits of their learning to India and to 
the world. 
* I am not sure that it is not better for 
the children to have much of the prelimi- 
fresh, of the power of assimilating instruc- 
tion by word of mouth. 
* I would develop in the child his hands, 
his brain and his soul. The hands have 
almost atrophied. The soul has been alto- 
gether ignored. 
* A wise parent allows the children to 
make mistakes. It is good for them once 
in a while to burn their fingers. 
* To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; 
it is man’s injustice to woman. If by 
strength is meant brute strength then indeed, 
is woman less brute than man. If by 
strength is meant moral power, then woman 
is immeasurably man’s superior. Has she 
not greater intuition, is she not more self- 
sacrificing, has she not greater powers of 
endurance, has she not greater courage? 
Without her man could not be. If non- 
violence is the law of our being, the future 
is with woman... Who can make a more 
effective appeal to the heart than woman? 
* I believe in the proper education of 
women. But I do believe that woman will 
not make her contribution to the world by 
mimicking or running a race with men. 
She can run the race, but she will not rise 
to the great heights she is capable of by 
mimicking man. She has to be the comple- 
ment of man, 
* I am not at all concerned with appearing 
to be consistent. In my pursuit after Truth 
I have discarded many ideas and learnt 
many new things. Old as I am in age, I 
have no feeling that I have ceased to grow 
inwardly or that my growth will stop with 
the dissolution of the flesh. What I am 
concerned with is my readiness to obey the 
call of Truth, my God, from moment to 
moment. 
* Music means rhythm, order. Its effect 
is electrical. It immediately soothes. Un- 
fortunately like our shastras, music has 
been the prerogative of the few. It has 
never become nationalized in the modern 
sense. If I had any influence with volun- 
teer boy scouts and Seva Samiti organiza- 
tions, I would make compulsory a proper 
singing in company of national songs. 
And to that end I should have great musi- 
cians attending every congress or confe- 
rence and teaching mass music. 
* I love music and all the other arts, but 
I do not attach such value to them as is 
generally done. I cannot, for example, 
recognize the value of those activities which 
require technical knowledge for their 
understanding... When I gaze at the star- 
sown heaven, and the infinite beauty it 
affords my eyes, that means to me more 
than all human art can give me. That 
does not mean that I ignore the value of 
those works generally called artistic; but 
personally, in comparison with the infinite 
beauty of Nature, I feel their unreality too 
intensely... Life is greater than all art. I 
would even go further and declare that the 
man whose {ife comes nearest to perfection 
is the greatest artist; for what is art without 
the sure foundation and framework of a 
noble life?

TRUE WORTH OF A CROWN 
Sir, 
In your issue “Science Versus Old 
Age” (October 1958) we are told that 
the old people of “De Gamles By” (The 
Old Peoples’ Town) in Copenhagen 
receive 30 crowns a month as pocket 
money. And further we are told that a 
crown is about 1/- or 15 cents. It is 
true that when you change one Danish 
crown into American money it will be 
worth about 15 cents, but it is just 
because of the American dollar’s 
superiority to European money when 
being spent in Europe. What you want 
to know is how much the Danes can 
buy for one crown in Denniark, and 
how much the Americans can buy for 
15 cents in U.S.A. When you have 
made that out and compared the two 
amounts of goods, you will see that a 
crown is equal to about 40 cents, and 
now you have a more true picture of 
the old peoples’ pocket money con- 
ditions. 
Finally, my compliments to the 
editors for one of the most valuable 
periodicals which has ever existed.

U.N. COUNCIL OF YOUTH 
Sir, 
Why not have a Youth Council as a 
permanent part of The United Nations? 
With more young people taking an 
active interest in world affairs, studying 
longer, taking extra night courses, 
helping to fight each nation’s military 
battles and generally being more active 
in a nation’s growth, why not give them 
a say in their own affairs? 
Mature youngsters could be chosen 
to act as delegates on a UN. Youth 
Council. This council could discuss 
all affairs that go before the adult 
councils and the delegates could also be 
ambassadors between the larger nations. 
Youngsters are asked to die for their 
nations but are not given any direct say 
in world affairs. A U.N. Youth Council 
would represent all nations in the 
United Nations, even those still outside, 
Delegates would be chosen from 
universities, organizations and young 
peoples groups in each country. Perhaps 
the training they would receive would 
even help them later as leaders in their 
own lands, or as representatives in the 
U.N. Assembly. 
The Youth Council would be station- 
ed at U.N. Headquarters in New York. 
Decisions would be by a majority. 
There could be a permanent secretary 
and assistant secretary and president 
and vice-president, the latter two being 
changed every two years. Perhaps 
Youth Councils could be formed in each 
area as a link with the larger Council. 
Regional Councils could act as informa- 
tion centres and work in with schools 
and educational bodies. 
Perhaps scholarships could be given 
by local councils for a young man or 
to the 
woman to study at the United Nations. 
He or she could spend a year at U.N. 
observing, learning all about Iinter- 
national affairs and perhaps preparing 
for a diplomatic or political career... I 
feel a Youth Council could do a great 
deal for world peace especially among 
the people who will be tomorrows 
leaders.

TIRESOME READING 
Sir, 
I must say quite frankly that your 
magazine makes boring reading. The 
articles are too long and too crammed 
with facts. Only with difficulty does 
one find a general idea and food for 
thought. The typography suffers from 
an excess of uniformity. As a doctor 
I have very little leisure time and the 
articles you publish offer me neither 
the relaxation nor the intellectual sti- 
mulus which I need. 
Dr. Paul Noel 
Chaville, France 
DOUBLE DUTCH ? 
Sir, 
Because we appreciate and heartily 
applaud the excellent work dome by 
Unesco, 1 was sorry to see a minor 
inexactitude in one of the articles in the 
July issue of THE UNEscO COURIER 
which I would like to point out. In 
the article on Bilingualism, Sir Ben 
Bowen Thomas names the Netherlands 
as a bilingual country. This is very 
definitely not so. We have many 
dialects, of course, but only Dutch is 
spoken. Or was he thinking of “Double 
Dutch?” 
Marian Gobius 
Voorburg, Netherlands 
A WEAK PUBLICATION 
Sir, 
I follow certain of UNEsco’s activities 
very closely and I have bought and will 
continue to buy some of its publications, 
in particular those in its collection of 
representative works. When one consi- 
ders the usefulness and the quality of 
these publications and the very real need 
which they fill, one is justified in using 
a certain severity of judgement with 
regard to your magazine. More often 
than not THE UNESCO COURIER is rather 
weak, is influenced by a puerile need to 
popularize, and seems, in part, to be the 
work of bad journalists. As it is your 
most widely distributed publication and 
is offered at a “publicity” rate, it is 
likely to prove harmful to your activities. 
Dr. J.-L. Doreau 
Paris, France 
SAVING INDIGENOUS ART 
Sir, 
I read with great interest the article 
by Lilo Linke, “Art Revival for 
Ecuador’s Indians,” in the N° 6, 1955 
issue of THe Unesco Courier (U.S. - 
Editor 
Sept. 1955). Did you know in Morocco, 
a similar and, as far as I can judge, even 
more ambitious effort to save indigenous 
art has been made by M. Marcel Vi- 
caire, director of handicraft industries? 
M. Vicaire, who has lived in Morocco 
for 35° years, has undertaken the 
restoration of several mosques and im- 
portant monuments and has set up pilot 
workshops. These are in operation all 
over Morocco, not only to develop 
handicrafts, but to enable them to 
follow traditional lines. As director of 
Morocco’s eight museums, M. Vicaire 
periodically organizes exhibitions of 
costumes, musical instruments, carpets, 
textiles, decorated arms, ceramics, 
leather work, jewellery, etc., of Berber 
and Arabic origin. Much more could 
be said of the admirable work carried 
out under his direction.

SCENE FROM PARSIFAL 
Sir, 
Congratulations on your October 
issue (Science vs. Old Age)... I was 
struck by the magnificent photo which 
appeared with the article by Aldous 
Huxley (“The Greatest Enemies to Li- 
berty”). 1 notice that the photo refers 
to the Beyreuth Festival. Can you tell 
me from which of Wagner's music- 
dramas this is a scene ? 
R, Stanford 
London 
Ed. not. : The picture in question is 
a scene from Wagner's ‘Parsifal” as 
presented in its modern staging at Bey- 
reuth.  “Parsifal” was Wagner's last 
work and is sometimes called his “Fare- 
well to the World”. It occupies a 
special place within Wagner's opus. In 
it Wagner shows how he who finds the 
way to renunciation rises above his own 
sufferings, experiencing that of others, 
and in compassionate understanding 
delivers the world of sin and creates a 
new life. 
‘COURIER’ IN GERMAN 
Sir, 
I have come across your publication 
through a friend. It interests me very 
much and I should like to know if 
there is any possibility of a German 
version being printed. The numbers in 
my possession are mainly in English, 
but I notice that they also exist in 
French, Spanish and recently Russian. 
In my opinion there must be conside- 
rable interest in your publication in 
German-speaking areas, but a sufficient 
knowledge of one of the Unesco lan- 
guages which would enable the reader 
to understand the highly qualified arti- 
cles is rare. I feel therefore that a 
German edition would be well worth- 
while. 
Hans Friedemann 
Berlin-Lichterfelde, Germany

Dr. VITTORINO VERONESE (LEFT), CONFERING WITH Dr. L. EVANS DURING UNESCO'S RECENT GENERAL CONFERENCE. 


### 67034: Dr. Vittorino Veronese, new Director-General of UNESCO

Dr. VITTORINO VERONESE 
NEW DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF UNESCO 
(Codice di Camaldoli) inspired by the principles of demo- HE General Conference of Unesco at its 10th session 
held in Paris in November has elected Dr. Vittorino 
Veronese, of Italy, Director-General of the Organi- 
zation in succession to Dr. Luther H. Evans. He is 
appointed for six years and assumed office at the close of 
the General Conference on December 5. 
Dr. Veronese was elected by 55 votes for, 20 against, 
with four abstentions. His election marks the first time 
that the post of Director-General of one of the agencies 
of the United Nations has been entrusted to a citizen of 
Italy. 
Born in Vicenza in 1910, Dr. Veronese brings to UNEsCO 
a distinguished career as a leader in cultural affairs and 
as an administrator and promoter of international co-op- 
eration, particularly in social and economic matters. Doctor 
of Law, barrister and then professor at the Institute of 
Social Sciences at the Athenaeum Angelicum in Rome, 
Dr. Veronese became Secretary-General of the Catholic 
Institute of Social Work in 1944 and later its president. 
Before this period he was associated with a group of 
democratically-minded university men and intellectuals 
who had come together in a review entitled “Studium” of 
which Dr. Veronese later became editor. It was this group 
(which included men like De Gasperi, Gonella and Vanoni) 
which in 1943 elaborated a manifesto of social action 
cracy. At this time he became the Central Secretary of 
the “Catholic Movement of University Graduates” which 
rallied university circles to the cause of freedom and human 
dignity. 
Since 1944 he has held a number of high posts in his 
country, including those of President of the Italian “Catho- 
lic Action”, member of the Governing Board of the 
Foundation “Premi Roma” for youth, President of the 
Association of Refugee Intellectuals in Italy, President of 
the Italian Central Institute of Credit, President of the 
“Consorzio di Credito per le Opere Pubbliche” and member 
of the Executive Committee of the Italian African Institute. 
His association with UNEsco dates from 1948, when Italy 
became a member of the Organization. Since that time he 
has attended all Unesco General Conferences as a member 
of the Italian delegation. As a-member of the Social 
Sciences Committee of the Italian National Commission 
for Unesco he has promoted many UNEsco activities in 
Italy. In 1952 he became a member of the UNEsco Execu- 
tive Board of which he was elected Chairman. in 1957. 
As a member of the Executive Board he initiated a series 
of discussions and meetings which led to profound changes 
in UNEscO’s programme, including the introduction of the 
“Major Projects” to which Unesco is now devoting a large 
part of its resources.

Cross FOR HOMEWORK: 
“Lernclubs”, or clubs for the prepa- 
ration of lessons, are now operating 
for the benefit of schoolchildren in 
Vienna and other Austrian cities. 
The clubs are open during the after- 
noons to children whose parents 
are employed away from home, and 
they enable these children to do their 
homework under the supervision of a 
teacher. The teacher does not help 
the children directly, but shows them 
how to find for themselves the solu- 
tion of their problems and teaches 
them to work independently. 
Hl FLIGHTS OF MERCY: Aircraft 
of Australia’s Royal Flying Doctor 
Service flew nearly half a million 
miles last year and its doctors 
treated some 13,000 patients. 
Another 11,000 sick people had 
their complaints diagnosed by 
flying doctors over the service's 
two-way radio network. The 
Flying Doctor Serpice has become 
an essential parl of Australia’s 
national life, and has given people 
living in remote regions a much - 
greater sense of security.

IN azarps OF CHILDHOOD: 
Accidents kill more European chil- 
dren over one year of age than does 
tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, cancer or 
any other disease reports the World 
Health Organization. Statistics 
show that in the Netherlands, Swe- 
den and Switzerland, for example, 
one death in three among children 
aged one to four is caused by an 
accident. Different risks apply to 
different countries. While drowning 
is particularly frequent in Scandina- 
via, the Netherlands and France, 
dnjury or death from burns caused by 
braziers or open fires is a greater 
danger in Britain and Spain. Experts 
stress that children must not be 
overprotected, but should be taught 
to cope with dangerous situations.

course of Esperanio was started 
recently at the U.N. Headquarters

introduction of uniform proce- 
dures, amendment of regulations 
which may delay or restrict inter- 
national air traffic, and the 
reduction of ground delays to the 
minimum. During its 13 years 
existence, ICAO has done much 
towards cutting down the red tape 
involved in border crossings by air. 
The problem has become even 
more vital as aircraft speeds have 
increased, making it necessary to 
cut down the time spent in 
customs, immigration and other 
formalities. 
A Frica’s GROWING OUTPUT: 
Agricultural production in Africa 
south of the Sahara showed an 
average annual increase of: about 
3 per cent since 1948-52, a rate which 
exceeded all other major regions of 
the world except the Near East. This 
was reported in “The State of Food 
and Agriculture 1958” published by 
the Food and Agriculture Organiza- 
tion. Fishery production in Africa 
increased nearly four times in 20 
years, but the increase in forest pro- 
ducts was less, since two-thirds of the 
forests were still inaccessible. Popu- 
lation figures rose by one-third in the 
same period, yet this represented 
only five per cent of world population 
on a total land surface of 15 percent 
of the earth. Agricultural produc- 
tion here is capable of great expan- 
sion since the area contains about 
15 percent of the world’s total agri- 
cultural land. Today the production 
Is only four percent of the world’s 
otal, 
m TIME OUT FROM SCHOOL: 
The length of school holidays 
varies according to the different 
countries and often within the 
same couniry. In the German 
Federal Republic, holidays average 
75 days a year; in Austria 85 days; 
in England and Wales 94 days; in 
Canada 102 days; in France 110 
days, in the United States 116 
days, in Ireland 130 days and in 
Italy 150 days per year.

Albania recently became the 81st 
Member State of Unesco when the 
Albanian representative in London 
signed the Organization's Constitu- 
tion which is deposited at the 
Foreign Office.

number of national languages in 
which instruction is given in the 
USS.R. is now sixty. In the 
Russian Soviet Federated Socialist 
Republic alone, forty-four lan-

different nationalities are used.
