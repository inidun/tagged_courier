WOMEN IN THE NEW ASIA 
Imost the whole world has seen revolutionary 
changes in the status of women—politically, legally, 
economically, educationally. What do these 
changes amount to in practice? What has been the 
effect of this newly-granted status upon day-to-day 
domestic living? 
In an attempt to answer these questions, Unesco has 
recently published a collection of studies entitled 
Women in the New Asia: The Changing Roles of Men 
and Women in South and South-East Asia (1) edited by 
Barbara Ward. Its purpose is to put before the ordi- 
nary reader material gathered for two years under the 
Unesco Major Project on Mutual Appreciation of Eas- 
tern and Western Cultural Values, and thus enable a 
more realistic appraisal to be made of the past, present 
and future of millions of women in Asia. 
Mrs. Ward points out in her introductory essay that 
these studies “may help us to emerge a little from the 
cocoon of our preconceptions, including our own cultur- 
ally derived sterotypes about what are truly ‘mascu- 
line' and what ‘feminine’ social roles—and also about 
what are really ‘Eastern’ and what ‘Western’ patterns 
of living.” 
The book examines the impact of the new status of 
women upon the private domestic lives of both sexes 
—of families, in fact—in eleven countries: Burma, Cey- 
lon, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaya, Pakistan, the Phi- 
lippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet-Nam and presents 
personal accounts by women from these countries. 
In the preface to “Women in the New Asia”, Barbara 
Ward writes: “In this book Unesco js daring to ask for 
trouble—for to study the relation between the roles of 
the two sexes is to do just that. Probably no other 
topic excites more argument and less agreement, and 
probably on no other topic is the argument more heated 
and the disagreement more profound. Nevertheless, we 
have endeavoured to set out facts and suggest con- 
clusions for the common reader in the West, and also, 
we hope, in the East, to ponder upon. We hope our 
endeavour will provoke new argument—perhaps less 
heated and more enlightened; we even dare to hope 
that it may produce some measure of agreement here 
and there.” 
Tue Unesco Courier is pleased to present selected pas- 
sages from this stimulating new work contributed by 
authors from Ceylon, Burma, Thailand and Viet Nam.

The vast majority of the people of South and South 
East Asia live in villages or towns of less than 
20,000 inhabitants. Hardly more than 109 live in bigger 
cities, as compared with an average of 429, in North 
American and between 309, and 35% in Europe. But 
today this picture is changing and from fishing villages. 
and rural hamlets alike there is a surge towards the 
towns. Perhaps the most striking example of this trend 
is Hong Kong (left). To meet Hong Kong's population 
~gxplosion”city authorities have had to embark on major 
projects to provide housing and increase water supplies.

THE SURGE 10 THE 
- 
= came: by Biirbara Ward 
a RTL, od < : 
AL, nd AR CAT TAO nett la NA Belt LL 
I: 1953 something quite new happened in the 
Chinese fishing village of Kau Sai, which lies 
on one of the many islands in the territory of Hong Kong: 
several fishermen sent their daughters to school. Pre- 
viously this had been the privilege of sons only. But in 
the early 1950's Kau Sai was becoming prosperous. Some 
of the fishing junks were fitted with dlesel engines; 
catches were larger and more regular, incomes higher. 
With higher incomes, wives and daughters, as well as 
sons and grandsons, wanted to buy things. The city had 
plenty of things to sell, but to find the shops you needed 
to be able to read—read the shop signs, the street names, 
the figures on the buses and their destinations. Modern 
communications were laid on, travel and goods were at 
the women’s disposal—but first they had to be able to 
read.

In the village literacy was not necessary; town lving, 
even town visiting, was difficult without it. The 
schoolgirls of Kau Sal illustrate very neatly the inter- 
dependence of the many different factors in contemporary 
social change. 
More than that, they illustrate also the surge towards 
the towns. Between 1951 and 1959 four young fisher boys 
left the village—prosperous though thelr families undoub- 
tedly were—for work in the city, and one girl was lucky 
enough to marry a townsman. 
This, which made her the envy of every other woman 
and the ideal of every schoolgirl in the village, meant 
that she went to live in a windowless cubicle about 9 feet 
long and 5 feet broad, whose hardboard walls reached a 5

WOMEN OF NEW ASIA (Cont'd) 


### 62199: The Surge to the towns

From the most heautiful scenery to a slum 
height of about seven feet and which was flanked by six 
or seven similar cubicles with whose occupants (together 
with those who slept in the passageway) she now shares 
a common kitchen-cum-lavatory about ten feet square. 
The fourth floor of the tenement which contalns this 
cublele Is reached by a steep, stralght stalrway, a yard 
wide, down which all refuse—including night-soil—has 
to be carried, and which, being no tenant's property, is 
no tenant's business to keep clean. The tenement is, of 
course, only one in a street of such bulldings, and in 
scores of such streets. There Is a standplpe for water 
about a hundred yards away. The good fortune of this 
girl, who now has two children both under three years old, 
{s still the talk of her old friends in the village. She has 
achieved thelr highest ambition: she lives In town. 
What has she gained? In the eyes of her friends and 
herself two precious things: freedom from the ceaseless- 
ness of toll in the village, and access to glamour and 
excitement. Both the “push” from the country and the 
“pull” to the towns are here reflected. There is no doubt 
that in most countries peasant rural life is an endless 
round of physically demanding work. 
Chinese fishing familles are perhaps an extreme 
example, since they live always (men, women and 
children) on their boats and many of them work far into 
the night; moreover they are driven all the time by the 
constant desire to make good in the material sense. BY 
no means all the other nationalities in South and South- 
East Asia share this motivation, and, without it, most of 
them, living in a climate and environment which do not 
force absolutely continuous effort, do in fact lead a less 
strenuous life. 
Nevertheless, even for them, the work is usually 
demanding and unending; often especially so for the 
women who, in addition to the inescapable dally chores 
of child care, cooking, cleaning, collecting water and 
firewood, laundering, and other domestic dutles, usually 
have the more continuous, if less arduous tasks of agri- 
culture laid upon them—planting out, for instance, and 
weeding. 
B the towns tasks disappear; water comes 
from a tap (what [s a hundred yards or So 
down the street compared with a quarter of a mile or 
more on a rough village path?); food can quite often be 
bought ready cooked; charcoal and firewood are in the 
market; there is electricity. All this and glamour too: 
things to see, shops to look at, the cinema, a fire engine, 
buses, crowded pavements, curious foreigners, rich people, 
perhaps processions for funerals and weddings. The 
fascination of town life for the imaginations of peasant 
women 1s not hard to understand. 
The question of how far thelr expectations are fulfilled 
can hardly be answered. For the fisherman's daughter 
from Kau Sal they undoubtedly were. Though to middle- 
class Western eyes she may appear to have exchanged a 
healthy open-air life in some of the most beautiful scenery 
in the world for an overcrowded slum, she is a truly 
happy woman. She told me so; and I could see that it 
was true. But for the pavement sleepers of other parts 
of Hong Kong (or Calcutta, or Bombay, or elsewhere) I 
cannot say. 
Overcrowding, unemployment, slum housing—these are 
common in all large Asian citles and there are probably 
many who wish they had never left the land. But we 
do not always see the alternatives. We need information, 
more factual studies of the relative advantages of poor 
town and poor country living and the actual reasons 
behind the decisions to migrate. 
Moreover it is as misleading to think solely in terms of 
poverty and overcrowding as it is to ignore them. Asian 
Though Ceylon’s women 
themselves and men's atti- 
tudes towards them have 
changed, only a relatively 
small number of women 
have in practice heen able to 
add to their traditional roles 
of wifeand motherorchange 
their position in comparison 
with men. In Ceylon most 
people live in rural areas 
where change has hardly 
occurred at all. Right, 
paddy fields rise tier upon 
tier like a giant staircase in 
the countryside of Ceylon.   
towns have their well-to-do inhabitants too. Further- 
more, in Asia as elsewhere, it is town life that gives the 
greatest opportunities for recreation, cultural activities of 
all kinds, education, diversified employment—after all, 
as the derivation of the word shows,’towns are the seats 
of civilization. And, as often as not they are also the 
places in which It is easiest for traditionally secluded 
women to emerge from purdah. 
In this they are atypical. Apart from city-states like 
Singapore, the proportion of the total population lving 
in towns containing a population of 20,000 or more 
nowhere in our region exceeds 22 per cent, and the average 
is not much above 10 per cent. In North America it is 
42 per cent (1950), in Europe (excluding Russia) 35 per 
cent, in the U.S.S.R. 31 per cent. One of the difficulties 
in the way of mutual understanding between East and 
West is that the overwhelming majority of Asians are 
villagers—or small-town dwellers—still. 
Nevertheless it is certain that there is a surge towards 
the towns in Asia, and that it is increasing.

### 62202: Ceylon: silent victory

aed SILENT VICTORY 1) 
by Subada Siriwardena 
] HE coming of the British to Ceylon in 1796 
marked the start of a new era in the history 
of this country, which from then onwards began to 
undergo the many changes that paved the way for its 
present emergence as one of the leading countries in 
South-East Asia. Plantations of coffee, tea and rubber 
were introduced, and with them the economic develop- 
ment of the country began. With the introduction of 
British government the seeds of democracy were sown. 
With the improvement of the means of communications 
the country was opened up and became more closely knit. 
The traditional legal systems of the country were 
supplemented and modified to meet modern requirements. 
Health services began to be within the reach of everyone. 
Education began to be considered the right of all irres- 
pective of sex, creed or ethnic group, and not as the 
privilege of a few. More than in anything else there 
opened a new chapter in the life of women in this 
country. - 
Traditionally, soclety in Ceylon was ordered strictly on 
a caste basis, which roughly corresponded with a class 
basis. Those who belonged to the so-called higher caste 
were the rich upper class, who were landed proprietors 
and who held responsible posts in government. Until 
the country fell into the hands of the Portuguese, the 
Dutch and later the British, these posts ranged from 
those of ministers and commanders-in-chief down to 
village headmen, and after the British occupation, from 
maha mudaliyar down to the village headmen. All the 
paddy cultivators, too, belonged to this Goigama caste, 
although they were not rich. The rest of the people 
belonged to the so-called lower castes, each with its 
traditional caste occupation (1). 
Buddhism was the religion of the Ceylonese and Hin- 
duism that of the Tamils, until Christianity obtained 
converts from both Ceylonese and Tamils. Moslems have

caste structure of the Tamils is very similar, but the Moslems 
have only a class structure.

WOMEN OF CEYLON (Cont'd) 
Most fathers

always followed Islam. Religion was the basis of the 
culture and the way of life of the people. 
In traditional Ceylon it was difficult to draw a hard 
and fast line between town and country. Even today 
three-quarters of the population consists of rural people, 
and the distinction between rural and urban soclety Is 
something that has been developing only since the begin- 
ning of the twentleth century. 
To be a good wife and mother was considered the 
ideal and the perfection of womanhood In all religions 
and caste groups from the earliest times and even after 
the coming of Christianity. Religion also fostered this 
ideal of the perfect wife-mother for the Ceylon woman. 
Careers were not meant for women... Economically 
gainful employment for women was unheard of - until 
the coming of the British. Girls had none of the oppor- 
tunities open to boys to get a formal education in the 
pirivena schools run by Buddhist monks or at the feet 
of Hindu Brahmin teachers. The few ‘women who 
happened to be literate had been taught at home by 
their fathers, or elder brothers, or other elderly male 
relatives. 
Women's position In Ceylon was far from favourable, 
and they were always considered inferior to men in all 
aspects, and as a constant source of trouble and wicked- 
ness. Even the Buddha is said to have at first refused 
to admit women to the Sasana (Buddhist clergy) because 
It was considered very difficult for a woman to lead the 
austere life of renunciation, since her mind is more prone 
to be fickle, unsteady and emotional than that of a man. 
| rT is the general belief among Buddhists that 
one must be a male to become a Buddha, and 
that arahantship (the second highest state of “enlighten- 
ment”) 1s more difficult for women to attain. To be 
born a female ls Itself considered the result of bad karma 
in a past birth, and much merit has to be accumulated 
to be born a man. Hindus have the corresponding belief. 
It is these beliefs that moulded women’s position In 
society. 
Woman was expected to be an affectionate and sub- 
missive helpmate to man, She was to be the responsible 
one in the domain of household duties, of bearing and 
rearing children, cooking and cleaning, sewing and 
mending, and ministering to the needs of the husband, 
parents and parents-in-law and children, It was 
contemptible for a woman to shirk, these duties which 
had been assigned to her by birth itself... 
Today, with the progress of compulsory education, 
cultural influence from the West and universal franchise, 
society itself has changed radically, Caste Is less rigid 
and class less coincident with it. The acquisition of 
education and wealth has been responsible for a visible 
mobility in soclety resulting in the growth of a new 
middle class to which may belong people of any caste, 
creed or ethnic group. The majority of the middle class 
are clustered in the citles and towns. The quest for 
money and education has further resulted in the rise of 
a working class of skilled and unskilled labourers, also 
clustering in the towns except for those working on the 
tea and rubber estates. . 
Thus, today’s society can be roughly divided into rural 
and urban sectors. The rural category can be subdivided 
into the non-cultlvator land-owning upper class and 
the working class engaged in small-scale paddy and 
other cultivation or in labour. The urban society can 
be divided into the elite upper class, educated and well- 
off, In important administrative positions or in business, 
the middle class, educated and moderately well-off in 
white-collar jobs, and the working class, performing 
skilled or unskllled labour, with or without a primary 
g education, and poor. All the previously mentioned castes 
are represented in all these strata of urban and rural 
society in Ceylon. 
  
  
    
     
These and other changes in the structure of soclety 
In modern Ceylon have not been without their repercus- 
sions on the life of women. There are now equal oppor- 
tunities for education from the primary school to the 
university for both men and women. 
In 1957, English and vernacular schools totaled 8,188 
of which there were 618 boys schools, 540 for girls and 
7,030 mixed. There were 986,333 boys and 846,741 girls 
attending school, and 1,990 young men and 728 women 
at the University of Ceylon. 
Women now have equal opportunities for employment 
in any profession or occupation, excepting the Civil 
Service, and today women in Ceylon do have more chance 
of promotion. But at the same time it must be said that 
though Ceylon’s women themselves and men’s attitudes 
towards them have changed, this still applies only to a 
few men, and relatively few women are actually able 
to avail themselves of the opportunities open to them. 
The position of women has changed, but only for a few. 
The old ideal is still popularly accepted, that is, that of 
getting married and being a successful wife and mother. 
Only a small percentage of women, and those especlally 
in the urban areas, have been able to add to thelr roles 
or change their position in comparison with men. But 
Ceylon is largely a rural country and the majority live 
in rural areas where change has hardly occurred at all 
Men of the upper and middie class, even those who 
have gone through a higher education course at the 
university or other institutions, prefer to marry stay- 
at-home wives with a dowry; not salary-earning, educated 
career women. They also feel that a woman with a 
higher education and a monthly salary would acquire 
a sense of independance and not be sufflciently sub- 
missive to their husbands. Such men often resent women 
going out to work or undertaking such activities as 
driving a motor-car or cycling.

~ before by the women of their country. One of them, seen here

~ Minetta de Silva. Her work has included a broad range of archi- 
~~ tectural designs, from private homes and large-scale housing 
projects to open-air theatres and low-cost school buildings for 
~ Ceylon. Her buildings reflect her search for a synthesis of tradi- 
~ tional and modern design—a regional modern architecture. She 
~ embodies, as an integral part of the construction, the skills of 
~ local craftsmen and artists, as can be seen in the tiled wall (left). ’ 
Thus, many highly educated career girls find it difficult 
to marry men of equal soclal and economic status and 
often continue to live as spinsters. Only a handful are 
fortunate enough to find husbands who demand neither 
old-fashloned submissiveness nor a dowry. It is true 
that working-class men and those of the lower middle- 
class, where incomes are insufficient to make ends meet, 
do want their wives to add to the family income by going 
out to work, but once they become economically well-off 
they too would wish to keep them safe at home. 
As a result most fathers decide to give their girls only 
a secondary education and stop their schoollng after 
that or even earlier. Instead, they wish to collect money 
for their daughters’ future dowry and trousseau, and 
train them in household work. Rich parents want their 
girls to learn accomplishments like music and dancing, 
which are considered assets in getting a husband with 
social prestige—perhaps a doctor, a civil servant or a 
lawyer. But generally speaking, extra pains are not 
considered worth while in educating girls on equal terms 
with the boys. 
M-: of the women of the present generation 
who are educated are asserting their rights 
silently, but effectively, and have found themselves in 
paths of employment which were never trod by women 
before. Thus today we have women 'who are highly 
qualified teachers, unlversity lecturers, doctors, lawyers,

librarians and Members of Parllament and, recently, 
even a woman Cabinet Minister (1). 
During 1958, more women students than men entered 
the University of Ceylon. In the teaching profession, 
for the year 1957, there were 27,101 women, as against 
28,309 men, and of these 890 were graduate women 
teachers. The nursing profession Is entirely a woman's 
profession. Many more are employed as sales-girls, 
typists, stenographers and clerks. 
All this is the result of education, especially the spread 
of English education. And the cost of living Is so high 
that most husbands are beginning to feel that it would 
be a blessing to have an additional income. Nevertheless, 
for various reasons according to surveys of the clty of 
Colombo and two villages made by the writer, from ten to 
20 per cent of the children of school age today are not 
attending school. Thus, most girls are not In practice 
able to avail themselves of the opportunities theoreti- 
cally open to them. 
Girls are today going to forelgn universities at their 
own expense or through scholarships sponsored by 
Unesco and the International Federation of University 
Women, etc. They go for courses ranging from uni- 
versity academic courses to courses In home science, 
nursing and beauty culture. Many educated women are 
engaged in social service work, running créches, female 
adult education, poor relief work, etc. The Lanca Mahila 
Samitiya Is a women’s association for such voluntary 
work. 
There is many a working mother In every soclal class 
who, after the husband’s death, has had to shoulder the 
burden of bringing up the family entirely alone.

at the feet of Buddhist monks and was successful in the 
Cambridge examinations through his own efforts. He 
acquired a government scholarship to the Unlversity of 
Oxford, where he recelved his B. Litt. in Western Classics. 
From there he proceeded to Berlin University, where he 
did further lnguistic studies and to Queen's College, 
Benares, for a further course in Sanskrit. He was head 
of the Department of Indo-Aryan Languages at the 
University of Ceylon for some time. 
My mother's parents were both literate, and were also 
rather well-to-do farmers. She was the fifth in a family 
of elght children. She was an uncertified Ceylonese 
teacher when she was glven in marriage at the age of 
24 to my father, who was in his forties at the time. No 
dowry had been asked or given. The parents had deci- 
ded for her and she had simply to consent. My father 
did not wish her to go out to work, and with reluctance 
she had to give up her job. Within one year after 
marriage I was born. My grandmother and my mother’s 
elder sister helped to bring me up as a baby. After two 
years my brother was horn and when he was two years 
old a sister also arrived.

father was strict, but also a lovable companion. He used 
to play with us indoors and outdoors and take us bathing 
in the river, and he helped me in my studies. He did not 
make me read books all the time. He took me out for 
walks and made me observe the surroundings, and 
recounted incidents about his travels abroad. He instilled 
in me as a young child the idea of what a long, unending 
but happy process learning Is. He took me out on visits 
to the “Sunday Fair,” to the city of Colombo, and to my 
paternal relations in the village, who were all illiterate, 
hardworking and simple farmer folk. 
My father never for a moment forgot or belittled his 
native village or even the areas around it. As a monu- 
ment of his love for the villagers, he founded an English 
school for them with his savings, the first and the only 
such school for miles around, at that time—the early 
1930s. Very low fees were levied and he was the prin- 
cipal. This school was handed over to the government 
one year before he died in 1939. 
On my father's death the burden of bringing up the 
family fell on my mother’s shoulders. More than any- 
thing else she strove to meet my father's last wish on 
his death bed—to give us children a good education. 
The other important influence in our lives has been 
my maternal uncle, who is a Buddhist monk engaged 
for the last twenty-five years in misslonary work in 
Penang (Malaysia). He has been my spiritual guide ever 
since the death of my father, and even now we seek his 
advice on all important matters. 
By the time I was 14 my mother had trained me to 
cook and sew and look after the younger ones. We were 
all also sent to both Christian and Buddhist English 
schools in the cities of Panadura and Colombo. Later 
my brother and I both graduated at the University of 
10 Ceylon, but my sister gave up school after a few years.

WOMEN OF CEYLON (Cont'd) 
Career woman 
but... 
I was given In marriage in 1956 at the age of 27 to 
my husband, who was 30 at the time. The marriage 
was arranged by my parents, but subject to my consent. 
My husband is a Food and Drugs Inspector, educated 
in Ceylon and England. Dowry was not asked or glven 
at our marriage, which was an orthodox Ceylonese 
Buddhist cercmony but for the fact that it was held at 
a public hall. We are of the same caste and religlon. 
We llve with my own mother and her family in Kandy, 
an arrangement which is very convenlent for me as our 
baby daughter, who was born within a year after our 
marriage, can stay happlly at home—whlile I continue 
with my unlversity work. 
Immediately after graduation I took to the teaching 
profession, the vocation I had chosen ever since I was a 
little pupil under my great father; and I acquired the 
diploma In education at the Unlversity of Ceylon three 
years after graduation and on the eve of my marriage. 
My husband soon understood my desire to continue to 
learn and, as he was convinced that I would not assume 
undue Independence, he allowed, and indeed encouraged, 
me to start reading for the M.A. in Education. This I 
am now dolng. 
I travel dally to the university In my own car, which 
I drive myself. My husband takes pride in my work, 
even in the face of some critielsm from his colleagues. 
I have not secen a husband more Interested in his wife's 
continuing to study, even denying for himself much of 
the attention traditionally due from a wife. 
B: although I have a certain amount of in- 
dependence which most women In Ceylon do 
not enjoy, this does not mean that I have devlated much 
from the ideal pattern of the wife and mother: My 
position at home follows very much the traditional 
pattern. My husband decides all Important matters, and 
often It Is acceptable to me. He commands and I obey. 
Except on scholarly matters It Is not for me to argue 
with him. I have to accept the fact that he knows best 
and that thls is all for my own good. I never go out 
or do anything outside the precincts of the home without 
his permission. But we do discuss important matters 
together, although the tendency is for him to decide 
finally. I feel quite happy and secure in this manner. 
We have no special preference for either sons or 
daughters, and when our daughter was born we were 
both happy. She Is glven the comforts that we can 
afford, by way of food, clothing, toys and attentlon. As 
a rule once we are back home for the day after work, 
we give her our company and it is seldom that we leave 
her to go out for an evening. We should feel sorry to 
deprive her of our company them. She loves to play 
and talk to us. I feel very proud that I breast-fed my 
daughter for ten full months, just as my mother did for 
me. 
We hope to give her the best educatlon available in 
this country, and later even in England if she turns out 
to be enterprising and Interested. We shall leave it to 
her whether or not to choose a career or what career to 
choose. Whether she has a career or not, we wish to see 
her happlly married to an intelligent, educated good- 
natured, well-mannered and understanding Ceylonese 
Buddhist. Provided these characteristics are there we 
do not mind her making the choice of the young man 
without allowing us to arrange her marriage. 
SuBapA SIRIWARDENA is a Ceylonese educationist. Since 
writing this article she has obtained her M.A. and 
is now working for a Ph. D degree in education. She 
intends to publish a work on “Growing up in a Ceylon 
Village” in the near future.

To her grand-daughter in short sleeves and 
high-heeled sandals should be at a cocktail 
party with a glass In her hand (even though it be orange 
or tomato julce) 1s hardly a picture that my grandmother 
Daw Meln Ka Lay would have imagined in her wildest 
dreams half a century ago. We have certainly come a 
long way since the ya-hta-lone, the Burmese horse and 
buggy days. In her time Ma Mein Ka Lay, as my grand- 
mother was called, was dedicated to the home and spent 
all her time at household chores, and would never go out 
at night except maybe to a pagoda festival, and then only 
in the company of the whole famlily. 
Thus It Is evident that even the stald and conservative 
Burmese culture which had always boasted of being 
impervious to the Influences of “foreign matter” is show- 
ing slgns of thawing... 
My familly cannot be described as a typical Burmese 
famlly, as the typlcal Burmese family would live on a farm, 
be literate in Burmese only, be engaged in farming and 
maybe never get to the big cltles except on a pilgrimage. 
My family can best be described as urban (we settled 
down in Rangoon when my father retired from govern- 
ment service) with the socio-economic status of a middle- 
class family, and we are staunch Buddhists... 
It should be Interesting to find out the changes that 
have taken place from the days of my grandmother, who 
lived under the last reigning Burmese king, to mine, the 
post-Independence days. The span of time Includes 
Burma under the rule of Burmese kings, the British 
regime, Japanese rule, re-occupation by the British and 
independent Burma... 
In my childhood the familly was made up of my grand- 
mother, father, mother, my sisters, an aunt (my mother’s 
cousin) and cousin who was really a poor relative living 
with us. The famlly was mobile in the sense that it 
moved wherever my father was transferred (he was the

Children of the calendar 
principal of a high school) and he was posted in each 
town for a few years at a time... 
The family system was very strong and absolute respect 
and obedlence were shown all along the line. Even the 
children had to obey the next in line, according to their 
ages. The deep-seated bellef is that one is to show 
respect for people even if they are one day older than you 
are. My grandmother, being the oldest in the household, 
formed the apex of authority and respect and she was 
followed by father, mother, aunt and cousin down to the 
children, from the eldest to the youngest. Burmese 
children from childhood are instilled with the idea of 
absolute reverence for the following in the order given: 
Lord Buddha, his teachings, the clergy, parents and 
teachers. This Is the reason why implicit obedience is 
accorded the parents. 
The attitude 1s somewhat changed now; the trend Is 
towards more rational obedience, and relations between 
my mother and ourselves are on a more informal plane. 
I noticed as a child there was never any familiarity or 
outright friendliness between my grandmother and my 
father or mother: she was treated with too much awe to 
allow that. Whereas now, If my mother makes a certain 
decision, we are able to explain things to her and even 
disagree with her and she takes it in the best light. In 
fact, when I accompanied my husband on a world tour 
in 1955 my mother was very much against it, but I was 
able to make her understand my point of view and even 
got her blessing for the trip... 
| N the matter of giving names to children there 
is still much adherence to tradition. Every 
Burmese child’s name depends on the day of birth. Since 
time immemorial, wise men have lald down a code 
making certaln sounds synonymous with certain days of 
the week. To give myself as an example, as I was born 
on a Saturday my parents could only name me from one 
of the following sound: “ta”, “hta”, “da”, “na”. 
In other words my name could being with only the T, 
D or N sounds. Accordingly I was named Ni Ni. It is 
only a first name and has nothing to do with my father’s, 
since in Burma we do not have family names. No strict 
Burmese family will have any other criterion for choosing 
a name for a baby. Thus In Burma it Is quite easy to 
guess someone’s day of birth once you hear the name. 
The only modern touch in the matter of names Is that 
most modern families are coming to realize the confusion 
caused by having only personal names and are beginning 
to add the father's name to the daughter's for purposes 
of identification. 
For example, just as Mary, daughter of Mr. Smith, is 
Mary Smith, Ni Ni, daughter of U Maung Maung Gyl, Is 
now called Ni NI Gyl. Wives, too, are beginning to take 
on their husband's names in addition to their own, thus 
if I wanted to be modern I could call myself Ni Ni Nyunt, 
as my husband’s name is U Hla Nyunt. 
In the matter of education, my grandfather went to a 
monastery where he learned the three Rs but more of 
religlous instruction. My grandmother went to a lay 
school were she studied the three Rs and scriptures as 
well. The reason for the girls going to a lay school was 
that it was not proper for the monks to teach girls. By 
the time my mother went to school, Rangoon could boast 
of a modern school called the Empress Victoria Buddhist 
Glrls’ School and my mother and aunt were proud to be 
its pupils and to learn English there. At that time my 
14 maternal grandmother's idea was to glve them enough 
“modern education” to enable them to read English news- 
papers and she made them leave school after middle 
grade. It was strongly felt that a full education was 
only for the men... 
The philosophy with regard to education had greatly 
changed when we reached school age. My father, in 
particular, had a very practical philosophy. Since he had 
no sons he was determined to give his daughters the best 
education he could. He explained that the best legacy 
parents could glve children was education, and often 
repeated the well-known cliché that education is a pot 
of gold that no one can steal. He thus sent us as boarders 
to a convent renowned for its high standard of education. 
My grandfather was at first very much against the idea 
of our going to an English school where we wore only 
European clothes and were given English names. He 
could not for a long time resign himself to the idea that 
we were glving up our national dress (even though tem- 
porarily) and our own names for the sake of learning to 
speak English, but he finally gave way in favour of the 
cause of education. 
In our generation two of the daughters got the benefit 
of. foreign education. One of my sisters went to study in 
England before the war. At that time the usual reaction

In an open-air restaurant set amid the stalls of a Rangoon market, Burmese families (left) 
enjoy a meal of "mohinga” (soaked rice pounded and passed through a sieve before being cooked) 
accompanied by fish or meat and sauces. This animated scene contrasts sharply with the Rangoon 
marriage group (above). The young wife wears a traditional bridal robe and her husband is 
dressed in a tunic and a ceremonial “paseo”, a kind of sarong reserved for great occasions. 
to the idea of a young unmarried girl going abroad was 
not very favourable. Quite a few of our elderly relatives 
criticized my parents for letting a young girl go alone 
to a stange country, where she might be exposed to the 
“wild ways of Western civilization.” When I went to 
study in the United States as a State scholar a decade 
later opinion had changed considerably and my going 
abroad met with complete approval from everyone. 
A: the present time every family takes pride 
in having a member going abroad to study. 
In fact things have reached the point where even elderly 
people would love to go abroad if “they could only get 
the chance,” at least on a pilgrimage. This Is a clear 
indication of social change and changing attitudes 
towards travel and the lessening of suspicion of the West 
and what it has to offer. 
To return to the matter of dress: my grandmother wore 
white cotton jackets (almost Chinese style) complete 
with cloth buttons, fixed her hair up with one or several 
combs on the top and walked sedately so that not even 
her ankles showed. Her tight sleeves came down to her 
wrist and her longyi to her ankles, and her hair for formal 
occasions was done up like a cake on her head. 
The above style of dress still prevalled until the end 
of the war. However, the post-war fashion is to wear 
short or three-quarter sleeves and now the present 
generation of teenagers and young girls go in for sleeveless 
jackets, brassiéres, short knee-length skirts and high- 
heeled sandais. 
I feel it is pertinent to write a few lines here about 
certain Innate beliefs and mores that neither education 
nor modern times can shake off. In spite of the fact that 
the Burmese woman has “gone modern” In more ways 
than one, it is almost paradoxical to see the way she 
sticks to certain of her ultra-traditional ways. Speaking 
for myself, I will never leave on a journey on the “bad” 
days of the month and will invariably undertake major 
items like choosing the day for the wedding, shifting 
house, buying property, etc., only on the “good” days, and 
these “good” and “bad” days are specified on each month 
of the Burmese calendar. 
To give another example, I would never bath or shampoo 
my hair while my husband was away on a journey unless I 
had definitely asked for permission to do so, prior to his 
departure, as washing one’s hair when a member of the 
family is away is believed to bring ill-luck to the traveller. 
On the other hand I fight with grim determination against 
the custom that one is not to cut one’s hair or nails on a 
Friday, Monday or on the day you were born, and I do 
It any time the necessity arises. Nor do I adhere strictly 
to the mealtime custom of giving the first serving of every 
dish to the oldest or masculine member of the family. 
If a husband and wife are eating together, traditionally 
the wife is not supposed to help herself to anything until 
she has given a small spoonful to her husband first. This 
custom is fine in that it is a symbol of respect, but we 
find it more convenient to by-pass it and have done so 
by mutual agreement between ourselves. If, however, my

WOMEN OF BURMA (Cont'd) 
World of the new 
‘rice winners’ 
mother or any elder is with us for a meal, both my husband 
and myself are prompt with the symbolic gesture. 
One feature of our generation which was not common 
in the time of my mother and grandmother is the emer- 
gence of the career woman. Burmese women have always 
been noted for their shrewd business acumen and thelr 
ability to stand on their own as viilage chiefs, and have 
even sat on the throne at different stages of Burmese his- 
tory, but their taking to regular careers is a new pheno- 
meno. 
The rising cost and standards of post-war living have 
made it necessary to have two incomes In order to live 
well. Although, the husband’s income may be sufficlent for - 
the basic needs of the family, any additional income 
contributed by the wife will afford the family the extra 
amenities of modern living. In addition to this economlc 
reason, the modern educated woman feels a sense of 
independence in having her own career and Is thus eager 
to make use for the excellent opportunities now offered 
to educated women. Besides, it adds a touch of prestige 
to the family’s reputation as both are bread-winners, 
I: my grandmother's and mother’s day, the 
position was reversed. The husband took 
pride in the fact that he was the sole “rice-winner” and 
that his wife could afford the luxury of staying home. 
We find that the modern career woman-cum-housewife 
is heavlly burdened with social obligations after office 
hours. In addition to her own professional social 
contacts, she Is also expected to keep up with her 
husband's. Consequently, the woman who combines the 
roles of housewife and career woman has a full-time job, 
out-of-office-hours professional obligations, her evening 
social engagements, and the task of running a home, 
does take a great deal out of the modern woman . . . 
The Burmese woman has always had a distinct place in 
public life. Theoretically speaking, there is no social or 
legal . barrier to her holding any position in the. land. 
Throughout Burmese history, - the -position- of -Burmese 
women has always been on a par with that of men. 
Traditional law recognizes us equally with men and all 
through our history we have had full inheritance rights. 
However, apart from the days when women ruled the 
country, the Burmese women have not taken any great 
interest in polltlecs. There is no great polltical conscious- 
ness such as is to be found in some other countries. 
Accordingly, there is no Burmese counterpart of the 
political stature of Mrs. Pandit, Mrs. Sun Yat Sen or Mrs. 
Roosevelt . . . This apathy towards politics may be 
attributed to the general passive philosophy of the 
Burmese Buddhist mind. 
We have certainly come a long way from the days of 
my grandmother. We have marched forward but with 
restraint. If in some ways the pendulum of social change 
has swung too fast, it has been because we were swept 
on by the inevitable chain of social evolution. 
  
NI NI GYI was educated in Rangoon. Burma, and in the 
United States where she went to study as a State scholar. 
She has since held several literary posts. She is married 
to U. Hla Nyunt, a leading Burmese scientist, whom she 
met while a student alt Columbia University, New York.

This narrow lane running between gardens and courtyards was typical of 
old Bangkok before modern roads were driven through it. It is now a 
metropolis of over one million people and with its many transformations has 
come a wave of social changes. Today Thai women are taking advantage 
of the new standards of equality of opportunity for both sexes and the new 
economic order. Education has given them access to positions of influence 
in a more specialized society. Freed from home-centered work women nowa- 
days often engage in petty trade, home industry or salaried office positions.

THE HIND LEGS 
OF AN ELEPHANT’ 
by Pramuan Dickinson 
W I asked my parents’ approval of my decl- 
slon to get married, my mother said: “If your 
grandmother were still alive she would be shocked by 
this.” This was because I had declded to marry a young 
man from a place far from our community, and our hemli- 
sphere—In Canada. It was so unusual that a strong 
protest ‘was to be expected, at least at first. “But the 
world has been changed a great deal,” sald my father, 
“how can one resist such a great change?” 
My father was right. The world has been changing a 
great deal from my grandmother's days to our present 
time. My grandmother married a man from the same 
community, but whom she had never met before. My 
mother became a little acquainted with my father before 
they married, but he came from a place In Central Thal- 
land far from her community, This was something of a 
shock because my father spoke a different dialect and no- 
one in the familly had ever heard of the village he 
came from, 
When my parents married, one part of the country 
seemed almost llke a forelgn country to another. A wild 
mountainous jungle between the north-east and central 
districts made it very difficult for people to travel back 
and forth. It used to take my grandfather two months to 
cross by elephants. Now, on 2 modern highway, one can 
cross within two hours by car. 
In my grandmother's day it ‘was unusual for women, 
especially unmarried girls, to travel very far from home. 
My grandmother, like all girls of her age, was educated at 
home only. She was taught by her mother to work in the 
household—cooking, spinning, weaving and sewing. My 
grandmother did not learn to read and wrlte because it 
was thought not proper for girls to do so. 
My grandmother had nine children altogether. The 
first, a boy, was sent to study with the monks when he was 
about 12 years old. My mother was the second child. My 
grandmother did not object to her daughters learning to 
read and write at all. Therefore my uncle was encouraged 
to teach hls younger sisters in his spare time from the 
monastery. 
When my grandmother's fifth child was about 10 years 
old, a school for girls was set up In the community, and 
she was sent to it. My mother was too old to go, so she 
continued to study at home until she married my father 
who helped her to learn both reading and writing. 
In my generation education was compulsory up to the 
fourth grade. But most parents who could afford it liked 
their children, boys and girls alike, to continue up to the 
end of secondary school which was avallable in the home 
town, and If possible to have further study in Bangkok.

### 62232: Three villages under a microscope

    
  
THREE VILLAGES 
UNDER A MICROSCOPE 
remote country villages in Thailand 
have been put under the micro- 
scope. In Napa, in the central rice- 
growing plain of the Bangkok region, 
Udorn, on the edge of the jungle in 
the north east, and Umeng, in the far 
north near the Burmese border, a cross- 
section of some 200 children and their 
families have been observed, studied 
and interviewed at length, each commu- 
nity survey lasting about six months. 
These operations are part of a unique 
survey carried out by the Bangkok 
Institute of Child Study, founded nearly 
nine years ago jointly by Unesco and 
the Government of Thailand. The study 
was carried out because Thailand, like 
many other countries, is trying to improve 
and extend its education system, and 
D the past year or so three knowledge about the nature of the child 
is the cornerstone of any development 
in education. 
During the survey, researchers have 
been asking questions such as “What . 
do you fear most in school and out of 
school?” "What do you enjoy most and 
why?" “What kind of responsibilities 
and home tasks do you have and how 
do they effect your going to school?” 
“Do you like having girls (or boys) with 
you in class?” Mothers have also been

### 62232: Three villages under a microscope

  
  
  
  
Three villages (conrq) 
in most Asian villages, little has changed 
in the past century until recently. New 
ways of behaving and living challenge 
traditional customs. The staff of the 
Bangkok Institute therefore has been 
investigating the factors in home, school 
and community life that affect the adjust- 
ment of children to learning and to 
becoming responsible citizens. 
They have been seeking the answers 
to questions like these: “What are the 
existing and potential points of stress 
and strain on children entering school?” 
“What kinds of teaching methods and 
what aspects of educational programmes 
are best fitted to ease the transition from 
one kind of society to another?” "What 
techniques may lead to conflict between 
the child and the school or the child 
and the family?” 
No final conclusions from the survey 
will be available until a fourth village, 
in the south towards the Malay penin- 
sular, has been visited later this year. 
But it is already clear that from the 
experience gained by the researchers 
it will be possible to evolve a new 
methodology which can be used for 
similar investigations in other Asian 
countries. 
This is already of great value because 
the methods and yardsticks used in 
Western surveys of child and family 
psychology have been found to be of 
little value in Asia. Any system of 
education is part of a whole pattern of 
values, social aspirations, traditions and 
folkways. An attempt to transplant 
educational ideas, techniques or methods 
bodily from one culture to another may 
destroy this pattern. 
OME differences were at once 
by apparent when tests used in 
Western surveys were applied to 
Asian children. It was found that in a 
general way the Asian child's mind is 
more contemplative, more shy and 
withdrawn, less impulsive and aggressive 
and less competitive than that of the 
Western child. The survey showed too 
that the Asian child has a tremendous 
and genuine desire and respect for 
learning, probably due to the influences 
of the village Buddhist temples which 
for many years were the sole repositories 
of education. 
Side by side with these surveys, the

carrying out a nation-wide programme in 
curriculum evaluation. Nearly 300 
schools, some 70,000 children and 1,200 
teachers have been involved in an 
operation which made use of tests 
and questionnaires. Achievement tests 
were devised to measure a child's abili- 
ties in arithmetic, reading, writing, geo- 
graphy and natural sciences. 
In addition to its research work, the 
Institute has a training programme as a 
graduate school for Bangkok's College 
of Education with two-year courses in 
general, educational and clinical psycho- 
logy, child development, statistics and 
physiology, leading to a Master's Degree 
in Education. Sixteen graduate students 
are now taking this course. Fellow- 
ships, including some from Unesco, 
have been granted to students from 11 
countries, emphasis being given to pro- 
vide facilities for training Asian students 
in research and teaching methods for 
use in Asian villages. 
The Institute's work is .directed by 
Dr. Lemaimas Saradatta, a leading Thai 
woman educator, and its staff includes 
two Unesco specialists and a number 
of Thai graduate researchers.

### 62216: Thailand: 'I am no longer the hind legs of an elephant'

WOMEN OF THAILAND (Cont'd) 
Reading and writing now proper for girls 
Boys still had a better chance because they could stay at 
monasteries in Bangkok. Only rich people could afford to 
send their daughters to expensive boarding schools, but 
every year the government granted some scholarships to 
both boys and girls to study In the field of education. 
This was the only chance for girls of poor families to go 
to school in Bangkok, and only provided that they were 
very bright. 
At present it is quite different. Girls have many more 
opportunities for education. They may now choose careers 
as teachers, doctors, lawyers, and many other professions. 
When I was 0f school age, my father decided to take 
over the running of a mine of preclous stones in the 
wilderness of the jungle. There was no school at the 
mine, which was at least one week’s journey by elephants 
from the nearest town, so my parents decided to leave 
me with my grandmother. 
I stayed there for some years. Then the time came 
when I had to leave for further study in Bangkok. I was 
sent to a well-known boarding school for girls. I was 
the first girl of the family to come out of the home to 
a school so far away. I was to go even further later on 
when I was given a Unesco fellowship to study at the 
University of Toronto, in Canada, where I met the man 
who became my husband. 
Looking back at the famlly history, I can see a tremen- 
dous change in the expectations about women’s roles in 
the family. My grandmother used to tell me how she was 
selected as a wife. One day as she was weaving, an elderly

lady whom she knew dropped by and watched her closely 
as she worked. It dawned on my grandmother that the 
lady had a son who was just at the right age to get 
married. He had entered the monkhood for one period 
of the Buddhist Lent, and was now accepted as being a 
mature man who was ready to “have family.” It was 
the mother's duty to look for a suitable wife for her son. 
If she had someone in mind, she would make a thorough 
check as to whether the girl was good at home-making, 
especially cooking, weaving and spinning—the handicrafts 
expected of her. My grandmother was right. A few days 
later, her mother told her that the lady had asked for 
her to be married to her son. 
I told my grandmother that I would have been angry 
because nobody seemed to care what the girl herself might 
feel, and also that the girl should have the right to select 
her husband. My grandmother laughed and sald: 
“Grandchlild, we girls at that time did not bother very 
much talking or even thinking about ‘rights’ as you do 
now, but we were still very happy. There Is an old saying, 
‘A woman Is the hind legs of an elephant.’ That means 
that you are to be the follower only, and I had done my 
duty as a good follower. That's all.” 
| did not know my grandfather, who died very 
young. He alone worked outside the home. 
He gave all the money he earned to my grandmother 
who kept the budget, ran the houschold, looked after the 
children and made cloth for the whole family. Besides 
being the place to live in, the home was a school and a 
small factory in itself. It was the only place for a 
woman to work. 
In my mother’s day, the majority of women still stayed 
at home. Very few had Independent carcers. Wage- 
earners were almost all men. There was only one woman 
in the local town who had a job as a teacher. Another 
woman, a nurse, worked In Bangkok. 
At present, it {s not unusual for women to earn their 
own living. Most young wives and mothers take jobs 
outside their homes. All my female cousins of my age 
are now wage-earners. Families have become smaller 
than those In my mother's day. Most families can no 
longer take in all the distant relatives as dependents In 
the household. In most cases where mothers work, 
servants must be hired to help in the home. 
My grandmother always quoted the old saying: “Your 
husband is a shading umbrella to protect your head. He 
makes you look pleasant and respectable to all eyes. 
Therefore, obey him.” At present, some wives might say: 
“But the world has changed a great deal, man and wife 
must be mutually dependent toward each other, there Is 
no such thing as absolute obedience on the wife's part 
now.” 
Within three generations, roles expected of men and 
women, boys and girls, have been tremendously modified 
by the great change of the world. And the rate of change 
has increased rapidly. I believe there was little difference 
between the soclal life of my grandmother and her own 
mother. But In the case of my mother and myself, one 
can see a big gap between the two generations, and the 
change is still going on very rapidly. 
By the time my own children are grown up, what will 
they think of their great-grandmother's days?

OF CHANGE AND TURMOIL 
TWENTY YEARS 
  
by Le Kwang Kim 
| am thoroughly bored with this ‘essay on 
Voltaire! I have no desire this evening to 
emulate his caustic wit. Saigon, In this stormy May 
weather 1s oppressive; in the hot and humid air the body 
is damp with sweat and the mind is Incapable of effort. 
Nevertheless, I must finish my essay or else I know what 
I shall hear from the professor on the subject of the 
usefulness of higher education for girls, on their proper 
place in the home, on the quality of their intelligence ...” 
When these words were written in May 1940, girls who 
wanted to continue their education beyond the primary 
stage had to study at the mens’ college. Thus every 
year four or five courageous—or foolhardy—young women 
adventured on the road to a bachelor’s degree. It was 
Indeed an adventure. The powerful and inflexible Confu- 
clan tradition forbade any companionship, any familiarity 
between the sexes. They never exchanged a word except 
on occasions of urgent necessity. 
Nowadays, after 20 years, if I meet one of my former 
classmates, bald, stout, married, the father of a family, 
we cannot help laughing when we recall the past. How 
things have changed since the morning when our group 
of girls, wrapped In a haughty and dignified silence, arri- 
ved for the first time at Petrus Ky College, and made our 
way along the corridors, following the red arrows which 
would direct us, as.we supposed, to the lecture room, but 
which in fact, to our great confusion, led to the lavatories! 
At 18, like most of my companions, I wore my long, 
straight, black halr in a heavy knot at the back of my 
neck. Out of doors I wore silk trousers—black or white 
according to whether or not it was raining—beneath a 
flowing high-necked tunic. A wide conical hat of plaited 
palm-leaves protected my complexion for, paradoxically

times a day to and from my home. Mothers in those

used to sleep, our heads resting on those oblong, wicker- 
work blocks which though very pretty with their brightly 
coloured covers, were very hard and most uncomfortable. 
He looked at me over his spectacles and quietly said: 
“Tomorrow you will take your boaks back to the libra- 
rian at the college and give this letter to the vice- 
principal before giving up your studies. Your mother and 
I with the approval of your grandparents, have arranged 
a marriage for you with the sixteenth son of Madame H. 
The young man is one of the most eligible matches in the 
country. They are Catholics and have asked that you 
should become one, and therefore you will do so. It is 
of no importance since, as a girl, you would not have to 
be responsible for the cult of the ancestors. Your brother 
will undertake this honourable duty. The day after 
tomorrow you will attend instruction at the Cathedral of 
Saigon.” 
HUS speedily, clearly and without discussion, 
the two most important declsions of my 
life—my conversion and my marriage—were taken by my 
parents. 
Do not be surprised that a girl of 18, educated in 
Western culture for many years, should submit with such 
meekness to decisions of great moment affecting her 
personal life so closely. In Viet-Nam the family ruled 
everything, decided everything, but also took all respon- 
sibility for the consequences and supported all its members 
in any trouble... I could not, therefore, live my own life 
as an independent and responsible person. 
In the turmoil of the months before my marriage I 
was scarcely able to apprehend the change which had 
taken place in my life, to question or to understand the 
real significance of events. One thing struck me, however, 
the presence beside me of the man with whom 1 was 
soon to share my life. As he had not been able to get the 
bishop's permission to take part, he merely stood respect- 
fully by while, on the day of our bethrothal, I carried 
out alone the customary prostratlons before the altar 
of my ancestors, presenting my future husband to them. 
After the ceremony he asked me affectionately if I was 
pleased with the jewels his mother had given me. These 
were a palr of earrings—the traditional betrothal gift, like 
the ring in the West—with a pendant and bracelet to 
match. 
The southern part of Viet-Nam, before the second world 
war, was a country of huge rice-ficlds, which at harvest 
time spread a golden carpet as far as the eye could sce. 
Small hamlets or trim peaceful villages lay in the 
shade of clumps of trees or green bamboos. A luxuriant, 
fertile and prosperous land! That was why its children 
were gentle, amiable, and smiling; too gentle, indeed, to 
be energetic or pugnaclous, too amiable to be firm and 
decisive, too cheerful to be sober and ambitious. 
The Chinese, who ruled us for a thousand years, were 
not far wrong when they called our country “Annam"”— 
the peaceful South. The easy life, the bland Confucian 
ethic, the troplcal heat-—all these conspired to make us 
what we were in those tranquil and peaceful days. But 
one is never sufficiently distrustful of still waters. 
These same Annamites (as we were called), good, 
generous and peaceable, suddenly exploded, as withess- 
the events of 1945, when the people of Viet-Nam rose 
with incredible violence and put an end to eighty years 
of French rule. 
This was the classic story of the insurrection of a 
dependent territory against forelgn domination, with 
guerillas, massacres, bloodshed and martyrs. It was also 
the awakening of a people. Finally, it was the prelude 
to a shock which affected every member of the community

### 62235: Viet-Nam: twenty years of change and turmoil

WOMEN OF VIET-NAM (Cont'd) 
Achieving the ‘golden mean’ of Confucius 
without exception and rocked the very foundations of 
society. 
The family shrank to its simplest expression—{father, 
mother and children. Individuals generally, and women 
in particular, no longer protected within the framework 
of the Great Family, began to measure thelr capacity 
to cope with life. As a result, there was a frantic rush 
to secure diplomas and enter professions. The young 
girl's future had indeed changed; marriage still was to 
be hoped for, but was no longer the one and only end. 
For me personally the 1945 revolution was a harsh 
ordeal. I was then a widow with a 2-year-old son and, 
without a profession, without an income. I had to take 
refuge with my parents who, when our property had 
been destroyed by fire, had gone to live in a small house 
they owned in the capital. 
A: old age and the sorrow caused by the 
destruction of his possessions took toll of my 
father's delicate health and in due course he died, leaving 
my mother, seventeen years my senior, and my young 
brother of 13. He was at the awkward age and had never 
submitted to discipline, except from my father, who had 
devoted himself to training him to be the future guardian 
of the cult of the ancestors. 
I spent three years of my life In this atmosphere of 
mourning, insecurity and increasing disintegration, while 
my mother continually bewailed the cruelty of fate, the 
heartlessness of friends, and the outlook of post-war 
society; to the end of her life she never succeeded in 
adapting herself to the changing world. 
All this was too much for me at the age of 22. Never- 
theless our troubles quickly matured me. When I consi- 
dered my brother, my child and my mother, I realized 
that if I did not quickly take action, if I did not decide 
to be “the man of the household”, we would soon find 
ourselves adrift. 
‘What does a person do who has to support a woman 
not equipped for the battle of life, to educate a boy, 
to bring up a baby? She works. So be it, I would work. 
‘But a rapid assessment of my capacities clearly showed 
that I could achieve very little by that means, and who 
would help me to carry out my heavy responsibilities? 
To marry agaln was out of the question; it was not 
considered fitting for a woman to marry twice. Was my 
reluctance to marry due to a desire to show myself worthy 
of my mother-in-law, that indomitable woman, who 
though widowed, was bringing up her children alone? 
No, I think rather, though I was unaware of it at the 
time, that the fact of being able at last to take my life 
and my future into my own hands, having no longer 
either father or husband in authority over me, liberated 
me from my bonds, so that I intended to preserve my 
new-found freedom at all costs. 
was, so to speak, Intoxicated with sense of 
being no longer a minor, no longer under 
tutelage, being able at last to make decisions for mysef. 
I experienced to some extent the feelings of a person who, 
having just learnt to drive, takes the steering wheel of his 
new car. It was the exhilaration of emancipation. It was, 
however, a time of groping, of feeling one's way, the 
discovery of life, of reality, for until then I had lived only 
at second hand. 
It was not without pain and suffering but for me it 
was a tlme of great enrichment. Soon I realized that 
in order to fight one must be armed, and well armed, and 
that in every field my weapons were inadequate. "To 
educate two boys one must oneself be educated, and 1 
had not learned nearly enough; therefore, It was here 
that I had to begin. 
I managed to collect enough money to enable me to 
go abroad and begin my studies agaln, at the same time 
supervising those of my brother and my son. Through 
this close contact with Europe I became, without noticing 
it, and In spite of myself, progressively Westernlzed; this 
was Inevitable. The culture I had partially acquired, 
now freed from the Inhibiting Influence of the famlily, 
gradually developed and took root in me, soon permeating 
me entirely. 
I became completely adult, In the Western meaning 
of the term; making decisions for myself, assuming 
responsibilities, engaging In undertakings, discussing, 
persuading, settling questions, becoming dally more sure 
of myself and of my capacities and my potentialities; 
already I was able to manage my two boys with some 
competence and authority. This went on for seven years, 
at the end of which I believed myself to be trained for 
life. Having taken my degree, I returned to Viet-Nam 
with my son. 
In Asla, although the rhythm varied in different 
countries, In general changes took place with the sudden- 
ness of revolution. In Viet-Nam particularly the speed of 
change was stupefying. By reason of its geographical 
situatilon—the pivotal point of an Asla suddenly risen 
to importance—Viet-Nam is at the exact centre of the 
South East Aslan countries. Her capital, which had been 
French when I left, had when I returned become cosmo- 
politan. 
Nevertheless, cutting across all the penetration by 
different civilizations, and the wider opening towards the 
West, there was a persistent and definite return to the 
traditions of the past, as if the people, alarmed by so 
many new things and new influences, were conscious of 
a need to rediscover themselves. 
EEPLY Influenced, in spite of ourselves, by 
Western culture, we now found ourselves in a 
completely different, environment, divided between two 
opposing trends. Readjustment was not altogether com- 
fortable. It is impossible to define the cflect on one’s 
mind of the passage from an organized soclety to a society 
in course of organizing itself—as ours Is today—whlle In 
spite of everything it Is still part of ourselves. One is 
conscious of being at once strong and weak, at home and 
at the same time foreign, doubtful and also assured. 
It took months for us to adjust ourselves to the pace 
of the new Viet-Nam. After having learned to advance, 
we learned to retreat, which we thought useless but which, 
nevertheless, Is necessary. It Is only when one has learned 
to move in both directions, that one really knows how to 
drive. 
It has taken me several years to achleve that delicate 
balance—*“the golden mean” of Confucius—between the 
frenzied urge towards Westernization and the simulta- 
neous need to cling passionately to the old traditions, 
both of which are characteristic of Viet-Nam today. This 
gives me a sense of fulfilment and satisfaction which one 
can only experience when one's personality has become 
finally integrated. It is a strength and a stimulus to feel 
that one has at least achleved stability In a changing 
world.

WORLD SIDE STORY In its May and June issues, The Unesco Courier published 
three articles on juvenile delinquency based on the results 
of a special inquiry carried out for Unesco by William C. 
Kvaraceus, Director of Youth Studies at the Lincoln Filene 
N OF Center for Citizenship of Tufts University, Medford, U.S.A. 
In this final article, the author discusses delinquency as a 
community problem which, he stresses, should be dealt 
with by the community as a whole and not simply left for 
OUR SPECI AL schools, churches and police courts to handle. The full 
report of this inquiry has now been published by Unesco 
(in English, French and Spanish) under the title "Juvenile 
Delinquency: A Problem for the Modern World". For further 
N Qu RY information write to Public Liaison Division, Unesco, Place 
 
de Fontenoy, Paris-7°. 
The photos shown here may seem 
to many adults as typical of the attire 
of the juvenile delinquent. Formidable 
as it may be—with its trappings of 
chains, horseshoes, cowboy boots, 
photos of “pop” singers, kerchiefs 
knotted above the knee, etc.—to 
the psychologist and youth guidance 
specialists such eccentricities are not 
necessarily signs of delinquent inten- 
tions. The specialists admit, however, 
that gangs of boys (and even girls) 
do form a major element in the over- 
all pattern of juvenile delinquency.

### 62239: Is there a solution for delinquency?

IS THERE A SOLUTION 
FOR DELINQUENCY? 
by William C. Kvaraceus 
Doe behaviour is not a twenty-four hour 
malady that attacks a child lke some virus 
disease. Since a child does not become delinquent 
overnight but as the result of a long and Intricate series 
of reactions, any realistic plan to help that child will not 
be easy to formulate. Any person, or any community, 
hoping to change a specific delinquency problem must 
accept the fact that it is a long process, often one of 
discouragement and delay. It is expensive in terms of 
money, time and effort. It need hardly be pointed out, 
however, that the results of dellnquency are twice as 
costly. 
What emerges clearly from many studies, reports and 
surveys is that delinquent behaviour must be the concern 
of the entire community, not just dismissed as a problem 
to be handled by local schools, churches, police courts or 
professional agencles. 
Unfortunately even the most honest and earnest 
attempts to curtail delinquency may fall without two 
essentials: funds and facts. Any operation should have 
as Its.foundation a validated theoretical frame of refe- 
rence about the causes of delinquency. The community 
should have available facts on the local youth situation 
and there must be individual facts on the individual child 
who shows a tendency towards delinquency or who has 
already broken the law. 
Such measures as curfews, restricting movie attendance 
or closing a dance-hall, are Irrelevant to the real problem 
and, for the most part, accomplish little. 
We know that there are many forces which decisively 
affect the growth, the development and the ultimate 
behaviour of the child. Among these are the home, the 
school, the church and church organizations, health and 
welfare groups and recreation organizations for young 
people. 
One of the most crucial forces, if we consider simply 
the number of years during which it exerts an influence 
over the child, is the school. The school cannot solve the 
problem of delinquency alone or even attempt to prevent 
it single-handedly. However, its role should always be 
considered as a vital part of a well-planned community 
programme. 
Together with the home, the school provides the basic 
learning experience for all children. Admittedly the 
school cannot ever completely compensate for the lack of 
a decent home or wise and loving parents. But it can

WORLD SIDE STORY (Cont'd) 
When the school ‘fails’ the child 
do much to make the child aware of his own basic values 
and teach him how to develop them. 
This Is precisely what does not happen In the case of 
the juvenile dellnquent. The records of many schools 
show with monotous regularity that these youngsters 
establish habits of failure and inferiority in thelr school 
years. Therefore, the .question that must concern the 
community and the school—why do children fall?—is not 
easy to answer. The reasons for a child’s failure vary 
with each pupil. The teacher often faces real limitations 
in trying to discover them. He is not always able to visit 
the child’s home, he is not a psychologist, a health spe- 
clalist or a case worker. 
Many educators belleve that far too many schools adhere 
too rigidly to a curriculum that Is not appropriate for nor 
of value to every pupil. After all, they point out, good 
schools begin with youngsters who are already quite 
different from each other and enable each to develop 
according to his talents. The school programme which 
provides only a narrow, one-track academic curriculum 
that squeezes out overyone but the students alming for 
higher education Is denying equal opportunity to all 
youngsters by such an exclusive focus on traditional 
academlc objectives and prestige. 
| F we agree that the child who might become a 
good mechanic is not to be considered inferior 
to the child with an Interest in medicine then we must 
also acknowledge that a single school should accommodate 
and benefit both of them. Pouring all students Into a 
single academlc mould causes many children who might be 
vulnerable to delinquency to come a good deal closer to it. 
The authorities and the community should consider setting 
up different types of school experiences for children who 
cannot benefit by a standard academic education or for 
those children who, for different reasons, cannot hold 
their own In the regular classroom. 
In trylng to relate the problems of delinquents with 
thelr problems at school, some educators have asserted 
that an inability to read is frequently a strong factor in 
their fallure. Certainly the chlld who cannot read ade- 
quately will only be confronted with such a rapid 
succession of tensions and frustrations in any classroom 
that it is not surprising if school becomes a place to be 
feared or despised. Vandalism of school property Is a 
protest; escape is.the only solution. Such a pupil may 
resort to truancy or drop out when he reaches the legal 
age. 
If the school curriculum is a realistic one, there will 
be remedial help available, but first the child must want 
to improve. If a pupll has been humiliated too often, he 
may never make the necessary effort. The school that 
expels a child, or fails him year after year, is more or 
less urging that student to get out when he is least 
prepared to build his own life. If the school must reject 
a pupll, then every effort should be made to find what 
other help can be offered to that child by other commu- 
nity agencies and organlzations. 
But it must be pointed out that in many cities of the 
world the problem of juvenile delinquency and the role 
of the school is eclipsed by more urgent considerations. 
It Is not always a question of improving schools for some 
countries, but of creating them. There Is a bitter humour 
In the suggestion that a teacher should do something 
about a child's emotional problems when many teachers 
in Asla and Africa face a classroom each morning 
knowing that some children are sick and 1ll-fed. 
It is sufflclently tragle that each year more than three 
million children are deprived of the right to education 
but it Is no less depressing to learn that many schools fail 
to make their pupils feel that education is a personal and 
Interesting experience. These schools work hard but the 
return from their work, if not the quality, is inadequate. 
While there are many children of the world who wish for 
education, it can hardly be denied that there is also an 
Impressive number who want to escape it. And a high

During a day of violence 
and vandalism at the 
English seaside town of 
Margate earlier this year 
police arrested about 40 
teenagers, members of rival 
juvenile gangs from London 
who style themselves the 
"Mods “ (short - haired, 
suede-booted and jacketed) 
and the “Rockers” (who 
wear black leather jackets 
and fringed cowboy hats). 
Here, “Mods” chase a 
group of “Rockers” across 
the sands. Holiday makers, 
watching the scene, were 
obliged to dodge salvos 
of milk bottles and broken 
legs from deck chairs as the 
rival gangs fought a series 
of battles, broke shop win- 
dows and ransacked cafes. 
proportion of these children who dread school become 
involved in some form of dellnquency. 
Any school will make its maximum contribution to delin- 
quency prevention and control by becoming a better 
school. It cannot achleve this alone. Ideally the school 
should have some link with the health, welfare and 
recreation agencies that exist in a community. For even 
if a teacher is aware that a child is ill or needs glasses, 
she cannot provide medicine and a pair of glasses if the 
family falls to do so. If a teacher is aware that a child 
is disturbed or damaged by emotional problems, she can 
only recommed a source of help. If a youngster has no 
place to go and nothing to do except loiter on a street 
corner, without outside help the most concerned and 
conscientious teacher cannot create a better world for 
him after he leaves the class. 
D ELINQUENTS, for a variety of reasons, frequently 
do not have an accepting or reassuring re- 
lationship with their parents. They can rarely discuss 
any problems with an older member of the household. 
They are not encouraged to share their own lives or 
emotions with their families and this, in itself, is a 
damaging restriction -for a child. Any education pro- 
gramme or any counselling that the community makes 
available to parents, providing it is wisely presented, can 
often be a turning point. . 
Some city communities have established neighbourhood 
centres where informal educational activities are conduct- 
ed. These activitles include parent discussion groups. 
Through these neighbourhood centres, people of all back- 
grounds who have a natural ability for different kinds of 
leadership can be found and involved in committee and 
recreational work. The basic premise of any education 
programme is that citizens should be educated to help 
themselves. 
Little scientific data exists to show exactly what preven- 
tive procedures have been effective. If we think of 
prevention as referring both to the forestalling of delin- 
quent behaviour and also to the reduction in its frequency 
and seriousness, then there are only meagre signals to

we 
gulde us in certaln directions. The very concept of delin- 
quency prevention is stili a vague, experimental one. 
As in the case of prevention, the control and the reha- 
bilitation of a juvenile delinquent often begins with the 
community. In highly industrialized countries, many 
communities have a number of services established for 
the benefit of all children and all youth. 
These existing facilities are rarely the result of any prior 
overall community planning and forethought. All too 
often, they operate as separate little islands weakening 
their value by the very distances between them. It is one 
of the most urgent responsibilities of any community 
programme that attempts to prevent, let alone control, 
delinquency to know what these resources are, how they 
function, how they can be improved if necessary and in 
what manner they can most efficiently work together. 
It is defeating, for example, for a social caseworker to 
try to help a dellnquent when his teacher, the policeman 
on the corner and the people in the neighbourhood coun- 
teract her efforts, when the poverty of the family com- 
pounds the problem, and when she cannot procure for the 
child the treatment he many need. There should be a 
continuity and a high degree of co-ordination among the 
services offered by a community, a close co-operation 
between private and government agencles if their existence 
Is to make sense. No hope exists for the delinquent unless 
guidance personnel, psychologists, psychiatrists and 
psychiatric social workers are easily and quickly accessible 
to the Individual child through the school and the 
community. : 
Depending on the nature of the offence, a delinquent 
often is put in custody of a detention centre until his 
hearing comes up in court. This may be days or weeks. 
Many detention centres begin the punishment, for they 
resemble gaols and the “detained” are given an all too 
clear understanding of prison life. Other juvenile delin- 
quents throughout the world are even confined in a local 
gaol and their cases are reviewed in the same courtroom 
where criminals stand and are sentenced. 
The exceptionally lucky delinquent may be referred to 
a court which has a number of services at its disposal: a 
© Associated Press 
decent and well-stafTed detention centre, clinical resources 
for child study, a highly-qualified professional probation 
staff and an effective llalson with other child welfare 
agencies. But it Is a question of contrasts. Vast differen- 
ces exist not only between nations but often there are 
extreme variations between courts in the same country 
or province. 
The establishment of special juvenile courts with 
trained judges and special legislation and practices Is 
encouraging; many experlences and research studies have 
proved the value of handling the juvenile delinquent in 
special courts and speeclal institutions. 
In the last fifty years probation and juvenile courts have 
spread to many European countrles, and have come to 
rank among the most Important measures of treatment 
and rehabilitation of the juvenile delinquent. Probation 
has been defined as “a method of dealing with specially 
selected offenders . . . It consists of the conditional suspen- 
sion of punishment while the offender is placed under 
personal supervision and is given Individual guidance and 
treatment.” 
S OMETIMES, possible methods of prevention, 
control and even rehabilitation tend to overlap. 
Police chiefs have often been heard to protest that many 
youth workers act and talk as though the police had no 
duties or responsibilities except to juveniles. And yet the 
importance of the police In a community with delinquency 
can hardly be overstated since they often represent the 
frst official contact between the young offender and the 
aw. 
The policeman or juvenile officer Is the one who must 
frequently decide whether to let the child off with a 
reprimand or to refer him to a juvenile court or some 
other agency set up to deal with such children. The 
police also supervise the areas where youth gather to play 
—public dance-halls, movie houses, public parks, street 
corners.

WORLD SIDE STORY (Cont'd) 
Success for the local police 
  
  
© Magnum-Wayne Miller qn 
xy. 
In many places where special juven- 
ile courts have been set up to deal 
with the juvenile delinquent, with 
trained judges and auxiliary services 
—a decent and well staffed detention 
centre, clinical resources for child 
study, a highly-qualified probation 
staff and an effective liaison with 
other child welfare agencies—en- 
couraging results have been obtained. 
delinquency can clearly be measured in hls attitude 
towards them, which should be nelther too vengeful nor, 
of course, too indifferent. 
In several countries the evolution of the work of the 
police has glven rise to more definite forms of actlon of 
a preventive nature. In Denmark, the Copenhagen police 
run four leisure-time clubs for boys in the 10 to 16 age 
group who come from poor quarters of the city and who 
have no adequate supervision in their homes. The police 
have also organized and maintained a club for young 
people over 18 years of age. All these clubs are devoted 
to sports and gymnastics. 
In Liverpool, England, a city police programme known 
as the Liverpool City Police Juvenile Llaison Scheme has 
been developed since 1949. Its object is to deal with 
youngsters under 17 years of age who manifest some 
behaviour disorders or who have already committed petty 
offences. The children are referred to the Juvenlle Liai- 
son Officer through normal police channels. The liaison 
officer visits the child and parents often. He tries to 
advise and assists them in various ways. 
What is most significant about the Liverpool plan is that 
it improves the relatlons between the police and the 
public in general. Police officers are presented not merely 
as awe-inspiring law-enforcing agents, but In the 
unexpected role of a protector of children and adviser to 
parents. It is claimed that this special operation was a 
contributing factor in diminishing the figures of juvenile 
delinquency In Liverpool, a city with the unhappy distinc- 
tlon of once having the highest delinquency rate in 
England. 
A sons: police tralning programme, that con- 
centrates not only on deterring delinquency 
but coping with it and helping the delinquent personally, 
is provided by the Dellnquency Control Institute at the 
University of Southern California, United States of 
America. The training programme lasts twelve weeks and 
the course provides the officers with an excellent 
background for work with children in their own 
community. They return to their jobs with an increased 
abllity to understand the reasons behind delinquent 
behaviour. : 
      
In highly developed countries, the community that 
attempts to cope with the individual problems of the 
delinquent without having the resources of a child gul- 
dance clinic close at hand places some severe, perhaps 
insuperable, limitations on its programmes. The work of 
the child guldance clinlc is related to the study, diagnosis 
and treatment of troubled children. 
All case studies involve an elaborate inquiry into the 
home and family of the delinquent but through the case 
study approach it is hoped to uncover the numerous 
factors which relate significantly to misbehaviour and 
which can finally be synthetized and analysed within a 
scientifically supported frame of reference. 
To sum up: Where there is a strong will to help the 
delinquent and when this is tied firmly to a sound know- 
ledge of the meaning and implications of the delinquent 
act, there will emerge a promising pattern for delinquency 
control and prevention. 
One of the most obvious reasons for our concern with 
juvenile delinquency is the fear of continued adult crime. 
It has been pointed out in one country that a very large 
number of men in prison began their criminal careers 
before they were thirteen years of age. 
Therefore, we must look in two directions at the same 
time: immediate action and help for today’s delinquents 
and the often neglected long road of research to give us 
validated methods for detecting and helping minors whose 
behaviour may lead to delinquency. At the same time we 
need to learn why certaln children bend in the direction 
of delinquent behaviour. - - 
Such research might seem to exclude the layman. It 
will be done by professionals and be interpreted by pro- 
fessionals. But this need not discourage any person from 
doing his own type of research through reading. Too 
often one's knowladge of delinquency is confined to what 
one reads hastily in the newspapers or sees in the films 
where a delinquent often appears as the stereotyped 
villain in a second-rate plot. 
Our own judgement about his crime is sometimes 
inflamed by a dramatic denunciation in the Press. But 
the delinquent needs neither our indignation nor our 
sentimentality. He needs, most of all, to achleve what so 
many adults have never attained: the knowledge of what 
he is and what, with help, he could become.

15TH GUIDE TO 
WORLD TRANSLATIONS 
“Index Translationum,” the interna- 
tional bibliography of translations 
published each year by Unesco, 
reveals in its latest edition (1) that 
32,787 translated books were pub- 
lished in 70 countries in 1962 (com- 
pared with 32,931 in 77 countries in 
1961). 
The bibliography lists only translat- 
ed works actually published during 
a single year and on this basis the 
Bible remains the most published of 
all translations (221 In 1962). The 
works of Lenin, which usually follow, 
fell behind N.S. Khrushchev's writ- 
ings which came second with 204 
translations. 
The centenary of Rabindranath 
Tagore in 1961 brought the great 
Indian writer to the fore and with 
129 publications of translations of 
his works, he ranked as high as 
Tolstoy, the world's most translated 
novelist. Other perennial favourites 
with translators were as follows: 
Shakespeare (112 translations pub- 
lished), Dostoievski (95), Gorkl (77). 
Mark Twain (59), Hemingway (54), 
Balzac (53), Dickens (50). 
As in previous years, literature 
outweighed other classifications with 
more than half the listed works. 
Social sciences, law and education 
accounted for 3,686 titles; history, 
geography and biography for 2,724; 
applied sciences 2,659 and philology 
and linguistics 113.

Letters to the Editor 
AVOID DIDACTICS 
  
Sir, 
In view of the large number of 
subjects you deal with and inform- 
ation you want to give your readers, 
I fully understand your desire to 
offer a greater variety of interesting 
articles. But this approach is not 
without certain dangers, for by so 
doing you deal with too many 
subjects and hence tend to be super- 
ficial. For me, the value of THE 
Unesco Courier has been its deep 
approach to problems and the way it 
has summarized and given form to 
questions inadequately presented by 
radio and press. 
The suggestion that you alternate 
“special issues’ and “issues with a 
varied table of contents” is only 
partly satisfactory, since it would be 
to the detriment of the special issues. 
Your technique of serializing articles, 
such as those on underdevelopment, 
seemed to me to offer all the 
advantages of the “special theme” 
dealing with a question in depth, 
reviewing present knowledge of the 
subject and in addition, making it 
possible for the reader to assimilate 
the material in easy doses. This has 
the further advantage of not taking 
up all the pages of an issue and 
allowing space to be devoted to other 
subjects. Another solution might be 
to publish a few articles on a given 
subject in the same issue when desired, 
which would not prevent you from 
adding articles on other subjects to 
vary the contents. 
I realize that your readership is 
very varied and that there is no ideal 
solution. The best solution, perhaps, 
might be to strike a fair balance 
between the possibilities. But for 
goodness sake don't give us the class- 
room approach, which attempts to 
cram. Instead, prepare apt minds to 
understand and act in the world.

TV TO FIGHT ILLITERACY 
Sir, 
I read your article “330 Million 
Brains for a New Era” (THE UNESCO 
CourIiEeR, July/August 1963) and I felt 
deeply impressed about UNEsco’s plan 
“for making some 300 million adults 
between the ages of 15 and 50 
literate within 10 years.” 
Many countries are using television 
as the easiest way—maybe the only 
possible one—to reach the isolated 
villages. If Colombia, for example, 
can have T.V. network programmes 
that cover 90% of the country, why 
cannot other countries do the same? 
Isn't it possible to start a campaign 
to get the interest of teachers, priests, 
pastors, judges, mayors, anyone who 
is literate in each community and 
who can afford a television set? 
Each educated person should be a 
teacher in a sense. 
Can't UNEsco launch a campaign to 
get twa free hours a day from each 
channel for teaching and free lessons 
published by newspapers and 
magazines? I believe in many 
countries much help can be got from 
all communication media. 
I hope you can realize your dream 
of world-wide literacy. Millions of 
people will bless you if you can at 
least begin this remarkable task.

MARIA MONTESSORI 
  
Sir, 
My pleasure at finding Dr. Maria 
Montessori the subject of an article 
in your April issue turned to dismay 
and chagrin that Maria Remiddi 
should write: “She undoubtedly follows 
the great tradition of Rousseau...” 
Such an observation is as jejune 
and unscholarly as to conclude that 
the Christian sacraments are in the 
“great tradition” of the pagan mystery 
cults, 
In this time of unparalleled Christian 
scholarship, when sensitivity to spiritual 
values and to ecumenism is universal 
(and when it is no longer de rigueur 
even among the sophisticated to ignore 
Christianity), why should not the sole 
and the correct source of Dr, Mon- 
tessori's inspired and dedicated labours 
—her Christian concept of human 
dignity——be recognized and applauded? 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau indeed! The 
suggestion is, to put it mildly, 
unseemly. 
It is disconcerting to think that the 
editor of a magazine of THE UNESCO 
CouRrIER's stature should wittingly or 
unwittingly have allowed such a piece 
of nonsense to appear in an article 
marred only by the author’s incom- 
prehension of Dr. Maria Montessori’s 
individual religious genius.

REGULAR COLOUR COMING 
In response to the many requests received from read- 
ers all over the world we are happy to announce that 
starting with the January 1965 issue The Unesco 
Courier will introduce pages in full colour on a regular 
basis. We plan to offer readers 20 full colour pages SPECIAL OFFER: 
 
grouped in four or five issues each year. 
To make ‘this innovation possible an adjustment will 
of course be necessary in our annual subscription rates 
and single copy price. This is further dictated by the 
fact that the subscription rate of The Unesco Courier 
has remained unchanged for the past six years des- 
pite continually mounting production costs. 
If your subscription expires before Dec- 
ember 31, 1964, you can renew for one 
year at the present lower rates (see 
inside backcover) provided you send 
the sales agent in your country before 
October 1. New or gift subscriptions will 
also be accepted at our current rates 
before October 1. 
On October 1, 1964, our new rates will go into effect as follows:
