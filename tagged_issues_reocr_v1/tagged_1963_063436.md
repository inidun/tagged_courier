### 63288: World of opportunity

WORLD 
by Ritchie Calder 
Last February the United Nations brought together at 
Geneva probably the world’s greatest assembly of scientists 
to discuss the application of science and technology for 
the benefit of the less developed areas. This double issue 
is based in major part on material from these discussions. 
In the special article below Ritchie Calder, winner of 
Unesco’s Kalinga Science Prize (1961) highlights the 
work of the UNCSAT conference and its implications for 
the new nations tomorrow. He is now completing a 
full-length analysis of the meetings, shortly to appear 
under the title “World of Opportunity” as Volume | of an 
8-volume condensation of the UNCSAT conference to be 
published later this year by the United Nations. 
| Bs are plenty of new flags fluttering at the 
mast-heads. When the United Nations was 
created in 1945, there were fifty-one members. Now there are one hundred 
and eleven and of those forty-six are countries which have won their indepen- 
dence in the meatime. 
But flags are not enough. Political freedom is an exhilarating experience, 
but there is the morning after the celebrations when peoples are likely to wake 
up and find that freedom has been robbed of much of its meaning; they are 
just as hungry, just as sick, just as impoverished. They have the pride of 
nationhood but are deprived, by squalor and hardship, of human dignity. 
They have an equal vote in the assembly of the nations but they suffer the 
inequality of unshared abundance. 
This is the contradiction of the modern world. At one and the same time, 
there has been the “revolution of rising expectations, of which political 
freedom is only part-fulfilment, and the scientific and technical revolution which 
has increased the prosperity of the advanced countries and has widened the 
gap between them and the less-developed countries. 
From the peasant in the paddy-field to the astronaut 
As Professor M. S. Thacker, in his presidential address to the United Nations 
Conference on the Application of Science and Technology for the Benefit of 
the Less Developed Areas, reminded the world: “One tenth of the peoples of 
the world enjoy 60% of the world’s income, while 57% of them have 
less than 10% of that wealth at their disposal. If present trends are to 
continue, the gulf between the poor and the rich countries will widen still 
further and this at a time when great continents have awoken to freedom 
and their populations are clamouring for certain minimum standards of life... 
Prosperity, like peace, is indivisible.” 
The gap is as wide as the vertical 200 miles which separate the peasant, 
wading in the wet paddy-field transplanting rice stem by stem, from the 
astronaut, circling the planet Earth which 3,000,000,000 human beings have 
to share; between the muscle-efforts of the poor and the supreme achievements 
of modern science; and between those who lack science and technology and 
those who have them.

OF OPPORTUNITY 
The closing of this gap was the “categorical imperative” of the injunction 
of U Thant, United Nations Secrctary General, to the 1,655 participants at the 
gcience and technology conference at Geneva. Ironically, the roll-call of that 
conference displayed the gap; the numbers of delegates from the advanced 
countries were four to one of those from less-developed countries, representing 
two-thirds of the world’s population; their governments just could not afford 
to send more than onc or two delegates; fourtecn could not send any. 
A meeting of minds without precedent 
  
Unesco. - Pierre A. Pittet 
The Bosscha Astronomical Observatory, 
close to Bandung in Indonesia, has been 
equipped, partly through a Unesco con- 
tribution, with twin telescopes, one 
intended for visual and the other for 
photographic work. Because they are 
situated seven degrees south of the 
equator, the observatory’s telescopes 
are well-placed for studying certain 
constellations such as the Milky Way. 
Apart from its size and the 10,000,000 words which “went into the record,” 
this conference was exceptional. It was not one more of those 1,500 scientific 
conferences which are held every year and at which scientific specialists discuss 
the details of their specializations. It was a public “stock-taking” not only 
of the goods which science has to offer in what Professor I’. M. S. Blackett 
called “the supermarket of science,” but of the cupboards, meagre in the 
essentials of human existence, of the less-developed countries. Jt was a 
venture in a new dimension of discussion—not just the laying out of facts hut 
a consensus of human aspirations. 
No one had to be reminded of what science is capable of doing—the release 
of atomic energy and the circling satellites (57 when the conference opened) 
were proof of what Thinking Man can do when he sets his mind to it. There 
were no bitter recriminations; political considerations, while not entircly 
absent, were muted. There was a certain amount of finger-wagging, of 
professorial cautioning about not attempting too much hut alo salutary 
reminders ahout the dangers of doing too little. 
There was, to begin with (because it was a conference without precedent), a 
tendency to over-formalize the discussions but that quickly broke down under 
protest and perhaps more mental business was transacted outside the sessions 
than in them, in the lobbies, and in the bars of the Palais des Nations. And in 
a real sense the delegates fullfilled their function of being, in Professor 
Thacker’s phrase, “the ambassadors of the needy and the spokesmen of the 
tongue-tied.” 
As Academian E. K. Fedorov said, the range of items was “encyclopa:dic.” 
Governments had been asked to submit papers as well as to send delegations 
and, in advance of the conference, over 4,000 papers were sent in, from which, 
with political as well as scientific tact, the scientific secretariat had to reject 
2,000; the number of papers eventually presented to the conference was 1,819. 
If all the transactions, totalling 10,000,000 words, were to be published, they 
would [ill 80 volumes. Instead, one of the post-conference tasks was to distill 
from all this material eight “working” velumes (1), cach self-sufficient as a

subject, so that men of affairs could comprehend and, more important, act 
upon the useful suggestions. 
There were 96 sessions in sixteen days—three plenary sessions in which out- 
standing and understanding personalities could survey the problems and set 
up the signposts for The World Development Decade, as the U.N. General 
Assembly designated the 1960s; 12 general sessions, covering cognate subjects; 
and 81 specialized sessions. 
A host of unexpected answers from the computer 
At the instigation of the President, three other special sessions were arranged 
so that the representatives of the less-developed countries could canvass their 
general prohlems. Even that was not cnough; the chairmen of the various 
sessions organized twenty-three extra meetings so that they could go into more 
detail. And—just to show how desperately in carnest the participants were— 
an extra-curricular service that no one had planned sprang into existence. 
Experienced conference-goers became the “hosts” for the hesitant and made 
it their job to introduce them to those who had the answers for which they were 
looking, 
The result was a friendly “clubbin_”—little groups getting together in alcoves

or private rooms. And it was not a one-way traffic; the “teachers” hecame 
the “taught,” because they learned from the representatives of less-developed 
countries a great deal that is not in the text-hooks. In winding-np, Professor 
Thacker compared the conference to a computer into which a great amount of 
information had been fed and a lot of unexpected answers had come out. 
It was, in truth, a conference without precedent hut, then, the circumstances 
were unprecedented. Ilistorically one might think of The Age of Reason at 
the end of the Eighteenth Century when there was a similar ferment of 
freedom, with the coming into existence of the United States, with the French 
Revolution, with Voltaire, Rousseau and Tom Payne and with the *“encyclo- 
pedists” trying to encompass and disseminate the knowledge of their times. 
And all of it coinciding with the invention of the steam-engine which gave a 
new power to the Industrial Revolution. If, as in the case of the Geneva 
Conference of 1963, there had been a coming together of those two forces, of 
aspirations and of material change, how different would history have read 
today,   
There was, in the Geneva Conference, this sense that it was changing human 
destiny. It could not be otherwise. Science and technology has hccome the 
social dynamic of our times. While reminding the leaders of the emergent 
nations that they were inadequately informed of the scientific advances which 
would give the maximum content to political freedom, U Thant, in his message, 
had this challenge to offer: 
“Science today is on trial because of the vastly increased power it has given 
to the forces of war and destruction to the point that, for the first time, 
humanity may be threatened with instant and total annihilation hut equally 
because, in its boldest and most far-reaching experiments science seems to have 
lost contact with society. Its processes have at times become so involved in 
mathematical abstraction and its preoccupations centred on areas so remote 
from daily life, that to the common man the scientists may appear today to live 
in a secluded world of their own. In some way, science must he made to 
remain aware of its human origin and human destination.”

No more foundling on the doorstep of society 
The scientists accepted that challenge. By their very presence in such 
numbers, they had accepted the fact they had social obligations and must no 
longer be prepared to leave their discoveries like foundlings on the doorstep 
of society with no responsibility for their upbringing. But speaker after 
speaker made this explicit in such phrases as: 
“No one can deny that the scientist has become a man of power and influence 
in the twentieth century. Whether he likes it or not, he has obtained a high 
place in decision-making.” (Thacker, India.) 
“Science is a supra-national activity, for its truths recognize no political 
boundaries.” (Bernardo Iloussay, Argentine.) 
“For far too long has the scientist lived in an ivory tower of his own creation. 
For far too long he lived the captive life of the djinn of Aladdin’s Lamp. 
He must change his own attitudes before he can ever see the goal of world 
development fully realized.” (Abdus Salam, Pakistan.) 
“We, scientists who have each of us embarked on vessels over which we have 
no control, have at least the right and the duty of saying publicly that in aiding 
the under-developed countries, the industrialized countries should not only give 
away their superfluity or their surpluses but should be ready to deprive them- 
selves and give until it hurts.” (Henri Laugier, France.) 
“Today, when science is exerting enormous influences on life, scientists 
appreciate their responsibility for the way their knowledge is being applied.” 
(Fedorov, U.S.S.R.) 
This, however, was not just a conference of soul-searching but of life-giving. 
In the twelve sections of the Conference, problems were examined on the most 
prosaic as well as the most profound levels, In purely material terms, 7

countries are underdeveloped because full use has not been made of their 
natural resources. More often than not, they do not know what natural 
resources they possess and a great deal of practical consideration (and advice) 
was given about how those resources should, by modern techniques, be found, 
charted and made use of. 
One of the most critical discussions in this section was on river basin develop- 
ment. Agriculture, rightly in a hungry world, had more papers than any 
other subject. Industry in all its aspects was examined, with the recognition, 
continually emphasized that, however preoccupied with increasing its farm 
yields, no country can enjoy complete independence unless it has a developed 
industry. 
Charting and using a nation’s natural 
Transport and communications are indispensable to “getting a country on 
the move.” Health, nutrition, housing,: rural and urban development, were 
examined and exemplified, with the recurring warnings to avoid the mistakes 
of the older industrialized countries and reminders that development is not an 
end in itself but a social purpose. 
Planning, it transpired, is no longer a suspect word with ideological inflec- 
tions. This was one of the most important of all the sections, not only in 
terms of economie planning but especially of the planning of seience and its 
direction to the needs of countries. Permeating and to some extent domin- 
ating all sections was the need for education and the sharing of knowledge and 
skills and how this is to be done, in terms of international collaboration and 
new techniques, as the most urgent follow-up of the conference. In this, 
UNESCO's role, as in the promotion of science for development, was obvious and 
accepted. 
Perhaps the most significant, indeed revolutionary change in thinking was 
the recognition of the need for “investment in human resources.” This is basic 
to all UN. thinking and has Leen embodied in all the work of all the 
specialized agencies. But here was the recognition that the true “in- 
frastructure’” is not that of conventional economics—the building of ports, 
railways, roads, ete. as a precondition of industrial development, “the gravit- 
ational flow of capital.” Instead, it is not only “human resources,” but “human 
resourcefulness” which matters, A healthy, better fed, better educated popu- 
lation can hasten everything else. In addition to being the “social beneficia- 
ries,” human beings become the economies factors in their own prosperity. 
resources 
The rising éxpectations that cannot wait 
“Hasten” is the operative word. People are now impatient to give material 
meaning to their freedom. Delay, as the Geneva Conference insisted, means 
a worsening of the disparity between the rich and poor—*“a slum at the bottom 
of the rich man’s garden,” as the President put it. 
We are trying to telescope time. Britain, first off the mark in the Industrial 
Revolution, has the benefits of 200 years of industrialization; Western Europe, 
of 150 years; the U.S.A., of 100 years; Japan, of 80 years; Russia, since the 
Soviet Revolution, of 40. If the less-developed countries have to wait 40, those 
“rising expectations” will be deferred until the twenty-first century. Seience 
and technology, shared and with means to make their possibilities real, can 
compress the calendar. The World Development Decade, with the Geneva 
Conference lo give it its head-force, is under way.

wo movements dominate the life of our age. 
One of these is the growth of knowledge. 
Vast conceptual changes, new terms for the understanding 
and deflnitlon of nature, have gone hand in hand with: 
spectacular technological results. Man is now clothed 
with a power which he never previously held—to generate 
and control energy; to fructify land; to conserve and 
utilize water; to combat disease; and to draw mankind 
together In close and constant accessibility. 
Together with the growth of knowledge we have 
celebrated the growth of freedom. The movement 
of sclentific progress has been accompanied by an intense 
movement of national liberation. More than fifty states, 
most of them In Africa, have added their flags to the 
International family within the past two decades. 
Fifteen years ago a quarter of the world’s population 
llved In colonies and dependent territorles under the rule 
of Imperial powers. Today the emancipation of Asia Is 
almost complete. In Africa the familly of independent 
states has grown from three to thirty-three. All but a 
few of the 230 million Africans have achleved their sover- 
elgnty or are negotiating for Its early attainment. 
Multitudes are newly embarked on the adventure of 
freedom with Its pitfalls and hazards—but also with its 
deep, enduring satisfactions. 
If constitutional freedom could itself guarantee welfare 
and equality we should now be celebrating mankind’s 
golden age. But in the awakening continents political

freedom has not been attended by a parallel liberation 
of peoples from their social and economic ills. Behind the 
new emblems of sovereignty millions continue to languish 
in squalor, illiteracy and disease. Men awaken to learn 
that they may be free in every constitutional sense and 
yet lose the essence of their freedom in the throes of 
famine and want. As the political Inequality between 
nations passes away, a new inequallty comes to the fore. 
It is the inequality between those who inherit the new 
abundance and those who can only look in upon it from 
outside. 
N ow the United Nations conference on the 
application of science and technology for the 
benefit of the less developed countries has sharply 
revealed the extent of the gulf separating those two 
worlds. In the advanced countries the average per capita 
income varies between $900 in Europe and $2,500 in North 
America. In most countries of Asia and Africa it is $50 
to $100. In advanced western countries the average life 
expectancy has reached 68 to 71. In the undeveloped 
areas It stands between 29 and 39. 
In the west Industrialization goes forward with swift 
momentum. In most of the new states it is impeded by 
the lack of basic technical skills, of power and transport, 
and of the social and economic Infra-structure necessary

for a technological society. Natural resources are abun- 
dant but not developed. The lack of momentum in the 
educational movement prevents a wider acquisition of 
technical skills. Debilitating diseases continue to enfeeble 
the people and set a limit to production. At the same 
time the expansion of welfare In the advanced countries 
is swift and headlong. And the gap is becoming wider, 
with the science and technology of the advanced coun- 
tries increasing it dynamically year by year. Meanwhile 
the pressure of population on resources grows more 
intense. 
The disparities in achievement between the advanced 
and the developing states do not arise from any inherent 
inequalities in moral and intellectual capacity. Nothing 
has been achieved by Europe and America of which Africa 
and Asia are intrinsically incapable. Indeed, if a con- 
ference similar to this had been convened some centuries 
ago, the east would have been defined as the advanced 
world, the west as the backward region. The truth is 
that since the scientific revolution began, one part of 
humanity has been cut off from contact with processes 
of thought and action which have endowed another part 
of humanity with the elements of its power. 
It might seem that all we need to do is to “export” 
science and technology from countries in which it is 
abundant to countries in which it Is scarce. Such an 
easy formulation would distort the truth. Science is a 
plant which can only grow in certain conditions of social 
climate and economic soil. It cannot be transferred fully

grown. Sclence Is not a monopoly of any social system. 
It has flourished both In capitalist and In soclalist socle- 
tles. It has prospered In big states, but some of its most 
eminent representatives and Institutions have arisen In 
small communities. Nevertheless, it is a tree that will 
only grow In a soclety ‘which possesses a vision of dev- 
elopment, which allows freedom for the creative Imagina- 
tion, and in which education, the pursuit of scientific truth 
and the penetration of the spectacle of nature are held 
in profound respect. 
FE state, however poor and small, can train 
enough of its citizens to ensure its own entry 
into the domain of scientific thought and action. Indeed, 
the prolonged exclusion of any state from that world is 
compatible neither with Its national dignity nor with its 
economic and social progress. But the narrowing of the 
gap between advanced and developing states requires 
International action going far beyond scientific advice 
and technical training. 
There must be a vast increase In the flow of capital 
available for developing states. Some of us have jolned 
in calling attention to the Improbability of such an 
Increase so long as 150 billion dollars and untold efforts

FREEDOM WITH KNOWLEDGE (Cont'd) 
Standing on a new threshold 
arms race. Even if our hopes in this direction are not 
fulfilled, something can be achleved by a more logical 
system of human priorities In the world’s scientific effort. 
How is it possible to justify the expenditure of tens of 
billions of dollars In prestige projects in outer space, when 
there is hunger, disease and illiteracy on this planet 
where the human condition stands to be determined for 
good or 111? Is it our business to invade the moon or to 
save the earth for our common humanity? 
The advanced states and the international agencies 
should regard this problem as having a higher priority 
than it has hitherto enjoyed. If we cannot change the 
relationship between advanced and backward regions 
within two decades, the chances of a peaceful and ordered 
human society may be forever lost. By 2000 a ‘world 
populated by 6,280 million people will not be able to endure 
the Inequalities which now exist between states. The 
WHO 
 
problem which has engaged the attention of the UNCSAT 
Conference should be solemnly considered by the heads of 
all governments interested in international development. 
The problem is not less urgent than those on which other 
“summit conferences” have been held. 
Nothing of value can be achieved without the initiative 
of the governments of developing states. These govern- 
ments must be given a deepened confidence in the modern 
scientific movement as one of their sources of their pro- 
gress. The course open to them js clear: Draw up a 
survey of resources; formulate a ten-year development 
plan; give the most urgent priority to human resources; 
establish an indigenous science through the training of a 
scientific elite: make maximal use of the U.N. Specialized 
Agencies, of bilateral agreements, and of the specialized 
assistance which is so patently available to governments 
seeking accelerated development.

Opposite, woman scientist uses an induction heater for research on iron magnetism. 
Let us hope and believe that the leaders of new nations 
will approach the problems of development and technical 
progress with the same ardour and perseverance which 
they have hitherto devoted to the struggle for national 
liberation. 
While I advocate a full use of international machinery, 
I do not believe that the United Nations should claim a 
monopoly of initiative and responsibility. The communion 
between the world of science and the world of national 
liberation should be sustalned at every level. Individual 
states and scientific institutions should do what they can 
to stimulate the reciprocal flow of experience and know- 
ledge. Bilateral programmes sometimes have an intimacy 
and speed which large international agencies cannot 
always achleve. 
Many of the new states have territories and populations 
too small to constitute viable units of development. 
Irrigation projects, universities and research institutes— 
except in such unusual conditions as those which affect 
my own country, Israel—require a broad demographic and 
territorial basis. There is a strong case for regional 
organization of planning and research, especially in Africa. 
It is not impossible to combine individual sovereignty with 
collective development. 
Foo conferences held by the United Nations 
or in member states should be of more limited 
scope and should address themselves to clearly defined 
fields. Believing that soil and water are still the main 
source of life for millions in the awakening continents, 
Israel proposes to hold a conference *in 1963, bringing 
experts on agricultural planning and agrarian education 
together with ministers and officials of developing states 
concerned with these problems. I belleve that similar 
specialized conferences could usefully consider problems 
of disease control, technical and scientific education, the 
use of new energles, Initial industriallzation and planning 
and survey techniques. The dialogue held here must be 
maintained and even Intensified, but on an increasingly 
functional basis. 
I: we understand the U.N. Conference in fits 
special context of history, we have no reason 
to be disappointed. There has never been such a 
concentration of scientific knowledge and responsibility 
in the service of humanity's submerged millions—those 
who have secured the outward form of liberty and now 
seek its Inner content. There is evidence that the world’s 
scientific conscience Is being galvanized by the pathos 
and opportunity of the less developed regions. This is 
the first generation of mankind in which the elimination 
of poverty and disease has hecome objectively possible. 
Science is the father of this possibility. Scientists do not 
wish to retreat into their laboratories in an effort to 
escape the challenge of human anguish and human hope. 
They have the will and the capacity to transform the 
human situation. 
If we can only fertilize their will and organize their 
capacity we may yet inaugurate one of the Great Ages 
of History.

THE PROMISE OF 
by Homi Jehangir Bhabha 
A: adequate supply of energy is the primary 
requisite for all modern industrialization and 
for supporting a high standard of living. For the under- 
developed countries of the world, it is therefore of prime 
Importance to ensure that adequate amounts of energy 
and power are harnessed at all stages of their develop- 
ment. A sound policy with regard to energy development 
can be formulated properly only by taking a long view of 
the broad energy requirements for quite some time into 
the future. 
In planning for the supply of electricity, it is important 
to remember that the capital investment in plants and 
industries required to consume a unit of electricity is on 
the average roughly seven times the capital investment 
in plant required to produce a unit of electricity. Thus, 
In any industrial complex the investment in power pro- 
ducing industries is generally only about 10 to 15% of 
the total investment. 
A conclusion to be drawn from this important fact is 
that when making large investments in power production 
it must be assured that several times this amount, say 
five to seven times, is available for investment in new 
industries to utilise this power. Otherwise, some of the 
investment made in producing new power will lie unuti- 
lized. A second and equally important conclusion to be 
drawn is that while the investment in power has to be 
roughly one-seventh of the total industrial investment, 
one should always ensure that the investment in power- 
producing industries is somewhat more rather than less 
than the optimum figure of about one-seventh. Under- 
supply of power has a much more adverse effect than 
an over-supply. 
We discussing the economics of utilizing alter- 
native energy resources. the present levels of 
energy consumption the growth in demands for energy and 
the availability of the different energy resources have to 
be taken Into account. For an examination of these fac- 
tors, it is convenient to divide the world into nine groups 
of countries as follows: North America, comprising essen- 
tially the United States and Canada; Oceania, consisting 
of Australla and the Pacific Ocean islands; U.S.S.R.; West- 
ern and Eastern Europe; Africa excluding Egypt; Latin 
America including Mexico and countries south of it; 
South Asia and the Far East, including all countries of 
Asia excluding the Middle East and China; The Middle 
East, including Iran, Turkey, Egypt and other Arab 
countries, and China. 
A tabulation of the per capita consumption of com- 
mercial energy, electricity production and installed elec- 
trical capacity for these regions shows that the per 
capita energy consumption for North America is about 
7.8 tons of coal equivalent per annum, and that for Europe, 
Oceania, and the U.S.S.R. is about 3 tons. These areas 
comprise the industrially advanced countries of the 
world today. 
On the other hand, Latin America, Africa, South Asia 
and the Far East, the Middle East and China, which 
comprises areas that may be termed as “underdeveloped”, 
have a per capita consumption of less than 0.7 tons coal 
14 equivalent. The disparity in these figures points to the

NUCLEAR ENERGY 
India is basing plans for its future industrial development on the use of nuclear 
energy. It began surveys of its nuclear fuel resources—uranium and thor- 
ium—as far back as 1949 and, as pant of its programme of nuclear research, 
began to operate its first reactor, the “Apsara”, or water nymph, at Trombay, 
near Bombay in 1957. It now has three research reactors at Trombay, includ- 
ing the Canada-india Reactor whose huge steel protective dome is shown 
here, and in addition it is planning to build two nuclear power stations.

NUCLEAR ENERGY (Cont'd) 
Coal and oil exhausted in 75 years 
enormous increases in energy production that will be 
required as the underdeveloped regions industrialize 
themselves. Moreover, the underdeveloped regions con- 
tain the bulk of the world’s population—some 2,139 mil- 
lion out of a total of roughly 3,000 million. 
According to a recent survey by the World Power Con- 
ference, it is estimated that the total reserves of fossil 
fuel in the world that could be economically recovered 
are about 3} million million tons. On the other hand, 
the total consumption of commercial sources of energy 
in the world in 1960 was about 4,200 million tons of coal 
equivalent. The world consumption of energy increased 
at a rate of about 5% per annum in the 1955-1960 period, 
and the rate has increased above this figure in 1959 and 
1960. On this basis the estimated reserves of economi- 
cally recoverable fossil fuel would be exhausted in about 
75 years. 
So far as water power Is concerned, it is estimated that 
if all the sites in the world that have been surveyed are 
utilized, it should be possible to generate about 5 million 
million Kw hours of electricity per annum. This forms 
a small portion of even the present total world energy 
consumption and would be less than 3% of the likely 
consumption 30 years hence. It therefore appears that 
POWER FROM THE

there is an immediate need 
for small solar power units 
that can be used to pump

world's arid areas. Re- 
search on such batteries

ward in many countries.

within the foreseeable future, the world will have to go 
in for a massive utilization of nuclear energy or other 
non-conventional resources. 
A tabulation of the total reserves of conventional re- 
sources, both measured and inferred, for different re- 
gions of the world, reveals the striking fact that the 
underdeveloped areas of the world are also those with 
the least per capita resources of conventional energy. 
The reserves are under 400 tons of coal equivalent per 
capita for the underdeveloped areas, 1,400 tons for Eu- 
rope, over 8,000 tons for North America and over 25,000 
tons for the U.S.S.R. 
We may assume that the underdeveloped areas will 
aim at achieving as rapidly as possible a stage of dev- 
elopment corresponding to that prevailing in Europe today, 
which would mean a per capita annual energy consump- 
tion of about 3 tons of coal equivalent. With a consump- 
tion of 3 tons per capita for these regions annually the 
entire reserves would be exhausted in less than 40 years 
in Latin America, less than 65 years in the Middle East, 
less than 30 years in the South Asia and Far East region 
and less than 133 years in Africa. This does not, of 
course, take into account the steadily rising population. 
It is clear therefore that in the underdeveloped areas,

### 63291: The Promise of nuclear energy

the conventional reserves will not be sufficient to support 
a developed economy for any significant length of time 
and that recourse will have to be made either to nuclear 
energy or to imports of fuel on a massive scale in the 
near future. 
The area which is worst endowed with conventional 
resources is the South Asia and Far East region which 
with a present population of 925 million will therefore 
require the use of nuclear energy at the earliest date of 
all. 
The cost of commercial energy depends on two factors; 
first, the intrinsic cost of the energy in the fuel used, 
and secondly the cost of the plant necessary for extract- 
ing this energy from the fuel and converting it into a 
commercially useful form, such as electricity. 
If the cost of coal is $4 a ton, the cost of energy in it 
comes to 20 US cents per million British Thermal Units. 
Transport may more than double the cost of energy. For 
furnace cil at $16 per ton, the cost of energy contained 
in it is 40 US cents per million BTU. The cost of nuclear 
fuel is higher, for we have to include the cost of bringing 
the ore to the surface of extracting the uranium content 
in it and then fabricating this uranium into fuel ele- 
ments of the desired type. This may result in fuel 
elements costing anything from $30,000 to $60,000 per ton. 
On the other hand, the amount of energy that can 
be extracted from each ton, even with today’s technology, 
is so enormous that the cost of energy from uranium may 
    
vary between 8 and 20 cents per million BTU. In other 
words, the intrinsic cost of energy from nuclear fuel is 
almost invariably lower than the cost of energy from 
conventional fuel, and may in many cases be less than 
half the cost of energy from coal even at the pit heads. 
This general situation could have an important bearing 
on fuel policy. If fuel has to be imported In any case, 
then it is much cheaper in terms of the energy obtained 
to import nuclear fuel rather than conventional fuel. 
The known reserves of conventional fuels in most of the 
underdeveloped areas are relatively so small that the full 
industrialization of these areas will have to depend either 
on a large scale import of fuel or on using nuclear energy. 
In view of the markedly low cost of energy in nuclear 
fuel the necessity to import fuel in very blg amounts 
will itself tip the balance in favour of going in for nuclear 
energy. Thus, we come to the conclusion that the full 
industrialization of the underdeveloped areas will in the 
long run take place only on the basis of atomic energy, 
whether the fuel is imported or obtained indigencously. 
If the generation of electricity from nuclear cnergy is 
not already much cheaper than from conventional fuels 
it is entirely because the technology is still in its infancy 
and the cost of plant required to utilize nuclear fuel is 
greater than the cost of plant required to use conventional 
fuel. However, the cost of nuclear power stations has 
been coming down rapidly, so much so that in many 
areas of the world electricity from atomic energy has 
already become competitive with electricity from conven- 
tional fuels. A major portion of India, which is remote 
from the coal fields, falls within this category, and cer- 
tain high fuel cost regions of the United States are prob- 
ably also in the same class. 
B conclusion it is necessary to make a few 
general observations. Should a study of the 
economics of the situation in a particular underdeveloped 
area show that it would be expedient to go in for nuclear 
production, this could be done initially on the basis of 
imported equipment. It is neither necessary nor desirable 
for every such country to go in immediately for the design 
and manufacture of nuclear equipment, as the necessary 
technical effort may well take away scarce personnel from 
more urgent problems. 
On the other hand, every new industrial project, 
whether in the nuclear ficld or otherwise, should Be made 
the starting point for the training of personnel, not only 
for operating such plants but for wider purposes. Each 
industry should be used to make its contribution directly 
and indirectly towards the development of technical 
personnel in a wider context than merely required for its 
operation. 
It is not necessary for every country, especially a small 
one, to produce everything, but it must be able to produce 
some things containing a high technological content 
which can be sold in return for other things which may 
be needed. A balance cannot be maintained only by 
trading raw materials for industrial equipment. In the 
last analysis, the most important asset of the highly 
industrialized countries is their educated and trained 
manpower in all fields, in particular their large number 
of scientists, technologists and skilled labour. It is this 
resource which the underdeveloped countries must build 
for themselves as quickly as possible, if they are to cease 
lagging behind, and to pull their own weight in the 
forward march of humanity.

### 63295: Index of prosperity: S.T.P. (scientific and technical potential)

INDEX OF PROSPERITY 
  
Ss. Te. PP. 
(Scientific & Technical Potential) 
by Victor A. Kovda 
Seience is the most dynamic cultural force in the modern world. The 
impact of science has revolutionized habits of dress, speech, travel and 
communication, cities and villages. At a deeper level it has affected philo- 
sophy through its new concepts of causality. And by making human want 
technologically obsolete it has brought into relief the moral responsibility 
of its use for constructive rather than destructive ends. A country without 
scientists and engineers cannot be in the main stream of modern life. 
A developing country can begin to meet its most imme- 
diate economical needs by Importing scientists from 
abroad, but it will never be really independent until it 
has created its own national pool of highly trained scien- 
tists and engineers, and its own scientific institutions. 
The economic progress out of which the cultural well- 
being of a country will grow depends to a great extent 
upon natural resources: climate and topography, flora and 
fauna, soil and water, and mineral riches. Therefore the 
very first requirement is scientific knowledge of a country’s 
natural environment and its resources. A detailed know- 
ledge of geographical conditions and energy sources, for 
example, must precede economic and industrial planning. 
This scientific knowledge can be obtained only through 
a series of systematic studies and surveys of natural 
resources. This is a task of paramount importance be- 
cause it can provide both the basis for the elaboration, of 
economically profitable schemes of exploitation and for 
rational plans of conservation. 
The number and type of resources having economic 
importance are very variable, depending on the natural 
history of the territory and of the continent where the 
country is located. It Is characteristic for natural re- 
sources to be distributed very irregularly. Thus we find 
a concentration of important mineral deposits In one 
country and a total absence of the same type of deposits 
in a neighbouring country. 
The experience of the scientifically advanced countries 
shows that no country is really “poor in natural resour- 
ces” In the absolute sense. The absence of one resource 
can be compensated for by the presence of another no 
less valuable, but this obviously requires the development 
of human resources, of the individuals within the country 
who are capable of directing both studies and development 
because they have the sclentific knowledge to do so. 
One of the most important of the new concepts which 
Unesco is now using is that of a country’s sclentific and 
technical potential or S.T.P. S.T.P. is the totality of a 
country’s resources for formulating and solving problems 
of national, regional and international importance In the 
fleld of science and the application of science. 
In determining a nation’s S.T.P. six factors have to be 
considered: 
The number of scientists and engineers. We have 
suggested that an index should be established showing the 
number of sclentists per million population. The more 
developed countries have from 500 to 4,000 sclentists per 
million population. If we take as a target for the sclen- 
tifically less developed an average of 1,000 scientists per 
milllon population, then a country with a population of 
5 million should have 5,000 scientists: one with a popula- 
tion of 30 millicn should have 30,000 scientists: a continent 
with a population of 200 million should have 200,0C0 
scientists.

ENGINEERS 
FOR IRAN'S 
NEW INDUSTRIES 
  Future engineers for Iran's new industries are seen 
here on the grounds of the Teheran Polytechnic during 
a break in classes. Left, a brunette Iranian teacher 
explains the operation of textile machinery to students, 
Far right, a Unesco expert in a practical course on 
textile engineering. The Polytechnic was set up with 
Unesco and U.N. Special Fund aid. Unesco has 
provided specialists in building construction and in 
textile, electrical and mechanical engineering. It has 
awarded fellowships to Iranians in these fields and has 
supplied large quantities of equipment. The Poly- 
technic has four Institutes where special emphasis is 
placed on practical skills not only in workshop and 
laboratory work, but in actual training within industry.   
Minimum target : 1,000 scientists 
per million population 
Judging from the experience of the most developed 
industrial countries, the number of engineers should be 
from five to ten times as great. The United States, with 
a population of 185 million, has 1,000 scientists per million 
population and 4,000 engineers per million population. 
The Soviet Union, with a population of 200 million, has 
1,800 scientists and 20,000 engineers and agronomists per 
million population. France, with a population of 46,000,000 
had (in 1955) 360 scientists and 2,608 engineers per million 
population. 
These figures can be used by any country to estimate its 
ultimate needs for scientists and engineers. But to 
achieve this proportion will take one or two generations. 
The number and equipment of national research insti- 
tutes. The next index of a country’s S.T.P. is the number, 
equipment and system of organization of national research 
institutes, universities and laboratories. We are studying 
this question and propose to publish monographs on the 
organization of science in a number of typical countries, 
such as Belgium, Czechoslovakia and Norway. Talks are 
also taking place with India and the Ukraine. The more 
numerous and the better equipped a country’s scientific 
institutes are the greater is that country’s S.T.P. 
It is also important to know whether a country has 
research centres in mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
mining and geology, chemical technology, economics and 
statistics. 
National production of scientific apparatus, measuring 
instruments and special equipment. This index illustrates 
a country’s capacity constantly to renew and improve the 
scientific apparatus and equipment needed for research. 
Scientific equipment becomes obsolete approximately every 
ten to fifteen years, and has to be replaced by new, more 
improved types. Today, production of scientific apparatus 
and precision Instruments is mainly concentrated in 
twelve to fifteen of the most developed countries. 
At the present stage of scientific development, it 1s very 
important that a country should be able, if not to produce, 
at least to repair and service the technical equipment it 
requires, for example, isotopes, electronic computers, tele- 
vision, and so on. 
Network of scientific documentation centres. Scientific 
libraries, microfilm libraries, map collections, scientific 
museums, translation and bibliographical services are a 
revealing index of a country’s S.T.P. 
The range and number of national scientific publica- 
tions. Periodicals, textbooks and works of scientific 
popularization are another important element of a coun- 
try’s scientific planning and research programmes. 
Scientific vocabulary. The existence or lack of a 
national scientific vocabulary, of a scientific terminology, 
and of appropriate concepts in the national language are 
another important index of a country’s S.T.P. 
A nation’s level of literacy, the general level of educa- 
tion, and the extent to which education is compulsory 
should also be taken into account. This does not mean 
that all these factors are necessarily of equal importance 
or incontrovertible, especially since it is not quantity so 
much as quality which is the decisive factor. UNEscCO 
will intensify research in this field, and in particular will 
attempt to determine the absolute and relative importance 
of all these factors, which constitute a nation’s S.T.P. 
A national scientific policy may be defined as a system 
of measures taken by a government to carry out a long- 
term (fifteen to twenty-five years) programme for science 
and its applications aimed at achieving the maximum 
socio-economic and cultural effects for the benefit of its 
people. In this sense a national scientific policy becomes 
an integral part of the government’s economic policy. 
Many of the countries which have recently attained 
independence are endeavouring to establish a network of 
scientific establishments, to set up a guiding scientific

body in the government, and to assign a regular part of 
the budget to training scientists and to scientific research. 
UnNEsco’s Department of Natural Sciences is conducting 
extensive studies of the existing sltuation with regard to 
national scientific policies. Of UNEsco’s 113 Member 
States, twenty-five do not now have any central bodies to 
guide or co-ordinate the activities of scientific establish- 
ments. About thirty have relatively ineffective national 
cenfres or councils responsible for the planning and 
development of science. 
A: increasing number of requests are being re- 
ceived from the governments of UNEsco 
Member States for assistance in preparing legislation for 
the establishment of national scientific councils, centres 
or academies. For instance, at the time of the opening 
of the Geneva Conference, the Parliament and President 
of the Republic of Lebanon approved a law (prepared 
with the help of Unesco) establishing a national council 
for the direction of science in that country. 
We feel that assistance to governments in working out 
national scientific policy and scientific organization will 
be one of UNEsco’s most important tasks during the next 
few years. We are already helping several governments 
to prepare appropriate legislation and programmes, as in 
the case of Lebanon. 
The size of State expenditure on national scientific ins- 
titutions Is an equally important element of State policy 
in the fleld of science. Every government should deter- 
mine the total financial outlay on sclence and its 
apportionment among basic, technical and social sciences. 
The size of expenditure and its allocation depend, of 
course, on the historical, social and natural conditions in 
each particular country. 
Economically and scientifically advanced countries 
allocate from 1 to 5 percent of thelr annual national 
- 
SL |, 
A 
 
income to development of science. European industrializ- 
ed countries allocate on an average 2.5 per cent of the 
national income. Some large countries which have 
recently achieved independence spend about 0.25 per cent 
of the national income on science, but most of the inde- 
pendent countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America 
spend less. 
Available statistics obviously do not show the full 
picture. Further research and improved methods of 
collection, processing and also evaluation of the available 
figures are necessary. But even now It is safe to say that 
the less developed countries do not spend enough on 
science. Much greater efforts are required of the 
countries themselves and of the international organiza- 
tions of the United Nations family. 
The third basic element of national policy in the field 
of science is the laying down of the main lines of scientific 
research, the planned creation of scientific institutions on 
a long-term basis, the establishment of priorities and time 
limits, having regard to the economic and natural condi- 
tions of the country and its individual regions. This is 
particularly Important in the case of large multinational 
States with vast territories and a heterogeneous popula- 
tion. 
The assessment of immediate and long-term require- 
ments as regards the tralning of scientific staff and 
teachers is the further Important element of State pol- 
icy In the field of sclence. The growth and development 
of science are inseparable from the creative activity of 
the scientist. The talents and working capacity of the

i HE United Nations Dev- 
elopment Decade has set 
out to mobilize the world’s technologi- 
cal and economic resources in a vast, 
peaceful offensive in support of dev- 
eloping countries in all parts of the 
world. Following the United Nations 
Conference on the Application of 
Science and Technology for the Bene- 
fit of the Less-Developed Areas, held 
in Geneva last February, Unesco is 
now reshaping its activities and its 
thinking in order to play its part in this 
offensive. 
The UNCSAT Conference in Geneva 
clearly brought out the fact that the 
“application of science and technolo- 
gy" is not keeping pace with the pre- 
sent growth of the world's new nations. 
It is the urgency of this problem creat- 
ed by the ever-increasing immediate 
and long-term needs of the developing 
countries that has led Unesco to plan 
a reinforcement of its activities in 
science and technology for the bene- 
fit of these nations. 
As presently proposed by Unesco's 
Director-General, Mr. René Maheu, the 
new Unesco programme (for 1965-66) 
will give to science an importance simi- 
lar to that now accorded to education. 
Unesco's budget for science, techno- 
logy and their applications will amount 
to about %7.3 million for two years as 
compared with $4.3 million for the cur- 
rent programme. About 60% of the 
budget will be concentrated on acti- 
vities of direct importance to dev- 
eloping countries, helping them to set 
up national scientific and technolo- 
gical institutions and universities, to 
make studies of natural resources and 
to train engineers, research workers and 
university professors. * :

### 63435: UNESCO expands its science programme

UNESCO EXPANDS ITS 
gramme in science teaching at all levels, 
in research and training in the en- 
gineering sciences and in studies and 
training related to natural resources. 
Unesco's reinforced Department of 
Natural Sciences will then have broadly 
two main responsibilities: the interna- 
tional promotion of science and the ap- 
plication of science to problems of eco- 
nomic development. In addition, a post 
of Assistant Unesco Director-General 
for Science and Technology will be set 
up. 
Moreover, Unesco will be able to 
count on financial and organizational 
help from the United Nations Technical 
Assistance Programme and the United 
Nations Special Fund which are expect- 
ed to provide, through Unesco, bet- 
ween 20 and 25 million dollars during 
1965-66. This will make possible the 
creation of new faculties and institu- 
tions, the recruitment of specialists and 
the purchase of equipment. 
The new programme was considered 
in broad outline by Unesco’s Executive 
Board in May and will be given further 
study by the Board in October. In its 
final form the expanded plan will be 
submitted for approval to the Unesco 
General Conference in 1964. 
Its adoption, however, will in no way 
diminish Unesco’s continually evolving 
programme in the field of international 
scientific co-operation. About 409% 
of the expanded regular budget for 
science will be devoted to the basic 
and earth sciences. 
The new programme proposes a 
considerable expansion of international 
activities in astronomy, atmospheric 
sciences, geology, ecology and pedo- 
logy. A reinforced and expanded pro- 
gramme in the life sciences—in bio- 
logy and brain research, for example— 
will be carried out. Research in outer 
space sciences and oceanography will 
be maintained and expanded. An im- 
portant new project in scientific hydro- 
logy—The International Hydrological 
Decade, which will be of long-term 
value to all countries—will be started. 
In drawing up its plans for 1965-66, 
Unesco has taken into consideration 
many of the facts and the recommen- 
dations received from national, regional 
and ‘international scientific organizations 
as well as from special advisory groups. 
Many valuable suggestion were offered 
by an advisory committee which met 
in Paris .in April to discuss specifically 
Unesco’s role and functions in the use 
of science for economic development. 
This committee brought together top- 
level scientists and technologists from 
seven countries under the chairman- 
ship of Prof. M. S. Thacker, of the 
Indian Government's Planning Com- 
mission, who presided over the UNCSAT 
Conference in Geneva (1). 
Noting that Unesco is the only U.N. 
Agency with a general mandate in the 
field of science and that as such it 
has an extremely important role to play, 
this committee declared that increased 
emphasis should be placed upon 
science and technology not only in 
view of economic development, but also 
as a component of education and of 
culture. 
The committee urged Unesco to em- 
phasize technological and scientific edu- 
cation at all levels and in all branches, 
from the secondary to the post-univer- 
sity level. It asked Unesco to continue 
its aid to countries establishing national 
research councils and other similar poli- 
cy-making bodies. Unesco should fur- 
ther encourage local scientists to share 
in the work of international scientific and 
technological associations and foster 
increased interest by these associations 
of problems facing developing areas.   
S.T.P. (Cont'd) 
The head and eyes of science 
scientist are precious qualities which must first be recog- 
nized and brought out in a young man or woman and 
then developed and trained. 
Plans for the training of scientists and university 
professors must always be prepared and carried out well 
ahead of current needs and in anticipation of future 
needs. It is necessary, for example, to allow for the 
inevitable elimination of some students and scientific 
workers In the initial stages. The increasing need for 
scientific staff follows a geometrical progression, and this 
too must be met. 
Of 100 boys and girls in schools, only ten to fifteen will 
attend a university. Of 100 university students only ten 
to fifteen are likely to become scientists—Iif they are given 
the opportunity. But of 100 scientists perhaps only two 
or three will be innovators of outstanding merit and 
significance in science. 
If a student is to grow into a true and creative scientist, 
he will need fifteen to twenty and sometimes twenty-five 
years for education and training and also to learn how to 
work as an individual researcher. 
As part of its national policy in science and technology, 
each country must decide what proportion of theoretical 
scientists and technical experts it wishes to have in 
various branches and special subjects. Each country, 
however, will always require good mathematicians, phy- 
sicists, chemists, geologists, geographers, biologists and 
technical experts. 
The Department of Natural Sciences of Unesco, together 
with international assoclations of scientists is preparing 
optimum types of scientific curricula, and suggestions for 
laboratory equipment and educational experiments to 
assist less-developed countries in establishing faculties 
of science and in tralning scientists in the basic branches 
of learning.

Today Unesco is making a large re- 
appraisal of its resources in science so 
as to give maximum support to the 
vast United Nations effort that is 
implied by the Geneva Conference. 
However, the urgency of the problems 
evoked by that Conference were recog- 
nized by Unesco's General Conference 
three years ago, when it approved a 
ten-year programme for science, 
stressing the special importance of all 
forms of assistance, through science 
and technology, for the accelerated 
industrialization of developing coun- 
tries. 
The Conference named three priori- 
ties in this ten-year (1960-70) pro- 
gramme. 
BW Co-ordination of scientific activities 
on both national and international 
levels ; 
I Exploration of the earth, methods for 
drawing up an inventory of natural 
resources, and the study of scien- 
tific problems related to the exploi- 
tation of these resources. 
HM Application of science and techno- 
logy for industrialization. 
In Unesco’s current (1963-64) pro- 
gramme for science, all forms of assis- 
tance to Member States for the creation 
of national scientific institutions, univer- 
sities, industrial research laboratories 
and polytechnic institutes, have been 
greatly increased in comparison with 
past years. About 250 specialists are 
now working in research and training 
institutes that are being established 
with the aid of Unesco and the United 
Nations. Between 30 and 35 new scien- 
tific institutions, faculties of engineering 
and applied research centres are being 
created with Unesco’s help and the use 
of U.N. special funds. 
While looking to the future and plan- 
ning its action on a new scale and with 
greater scope, Unesco can now draw 
on a decade of working experience in 
this field. 
Institutions like the Indian Institute of 
Technology in Bombay or the Middle 
East Technical University at Ankara 
show what can be achieved by large- 
scale national effort (in this case by 
India and Turkey) with a backing of 
international technological aid supplied 
by Unesco. 
Unesco specialists have trained geo- 
logists who are working to solve the 
water problems of Brazil's Polygon of 
Drought, they have taught physics in 
Indonesia, they have gone to earth- 
quake-prone areas to advise on sound 
construction methods for building and 
public works and they have set up a 
world network of centres to make avail- 
able the documentation which is the 
lifeblood of science. 
In these and many other ways, 
Unesco is working to accomplish aid 
programmes in scientific research and 
training and in the applications of scien- 
tific and technological knowledge. It is 
thus responding to requests for aid 
from many newly-independent countries 
who realize that real political and eco- 
nomic independence can only be achie- 
ved by the parallel creation of scien- 
tific institutions and universities carrying 
out research and studies on vital prob- 
lems related to economic and cultural 
welfare.

tronics, radio-isotopes, television, etc.) really needed for 
Industrializing the less-developed countries and for 
developing their economy. and science? Unesco has 
studied this question and has concluded that these things 
really are essential. The economic reconstruction of the 
newly-independent countries will have to be completed 
rapidly in the life-time of one or at the most two genera- 
tions. They must now bridge the gap separating them 
from economically developed nations. Thus, Unesco 
belleves that the development of industry, transport, agri- 
culture and forestry should be based on economically 
viable foundations ‘which are scientifically and technically 
the most advanced and also adapted to local conditions. 
This view is shared by many Unesco Member States; for 
example India, whose Government has co-operated with 
Unesco in establishing a first-class polytechnic institute 
in Bombay; or Turkey, where a Middle East Technical 
University is being established by Unesco and the Turkish 
Government with the assistance of the United Nations 
Special Fund. Institutes of the same kind and highly 
developed scientific centres are being established co- 
operatively by national governments and Unesco. True, 
this process is only just beginning. We shall have to 
establish these centres not only by ones and twos but by 
dozens, and in the future perhaps by hundreds. 
The next question is whether or not there should be 
any functional dlvislon between scientific research and 
the application of sclentific discoverles. What I have in 
mind here Is not economic Investment, nor the practical 
aspects of Industrialization—planning for Industrialization 
and executing these plans. Obviously these are not 
matters for Unesco. What I am thinking about is the 
Indivisibility of research, the training of a sclentist or 
an englneer, and the practical application of sclence in 
the national economy. 
It often happens that the application of sclence leads 
to new theoretical discoveries or to new general theories. 
It Is the role of the scientist himself to suggest the best 
possible ways of applying sclentitic discoveries In practice. 
If we separate theory from practical application, sclence 
will have lost its brain and eyes. If we separate reasoned 
application from scientific theory, then the theory will 
lose all meaning.

### 63297: 330 million brains for a new era

AINS FOR A NEW ERA 
by René Maheu 
Director-General of Unesco 
HEN looked at from the standpoint of educa- 
tion the major factor underlying underdeve- 
lopment is the absence, for much of a given population, 
of the minimum of schooling required to learn those 
basic signs and characters which are the key to the Intel- 
lectual and technical creations of our civilization. This 
major factor, in short, is illiteracy. 
There are today an estimated 700 million adults—or 
more than two-fifths of the world’s total population—who 
are illiterate (the word adult here being taken to mean 
persons 15 years of age or older). And it is in the less 
developed regions that most of these adult illiterates 
live. 
As for children of primary school age (5 to 15 years), 
47 per cent did not attend school during 1960 in the 
countries of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and 
Asia. If we add to this figure those children who are 
going to school now but who will drop out before they 
master reading and writing and hence will grow up 
illiterate, we can say that there are today 150 million 
future illiterates in these countries and that there will 
be an additional 20 to 25 million illiterates added to the 
world’s adult population in the next 8 or 7 years. 
It is in the light of this general context of educational 
under-development that the speclal problem of training 
scientific and technical personnel in the less developed 
reglons must be viewed. 
First of all let me emphasize what a frightful loss of 
mindpower these hundreds of millions of illiterates repre- 
sent for technological progress. Who can say how many 
scientists, engineers and technicians potentially existed 
among all these forsaken adults as well as the children 
consigned from birth to the shadows of ignorance. 
There is certainly no need for me to make the point 
that an illiterate person never ceases to be a human 
being endowed with his own natural dignity and ability. 
I have personally known individuals who, despite the 
fact that they were illiterate, possessed unusual intelli- 
gence, keen judgement and a high standard of culture. 
The realm of signs and characters does not encompass 
the whole gamut of human experience. Nevertheless, 
illiteracy by the very fact that it makes science and 
technology a closed book makes active participation in 
modern civilization impossible. The millions of illiterates 
I have referred to submit to history, they do not make it. 
T= question then is raised—why isn’t a big 
international campaign started to help these 
countries to get rid of this blight, since to allow it to 
continue is an absurdity in terms of economic efficiency 
as much as it is a disgrace on the moral conscience of the 
world. UnNEsco considers that the political, economic and 
technical conditions are at the present time such as to 
make a campaign of this kind possible, if we so desire it. 
At the end of last year, after a series of consultatlons 
with many experts on the question, I submitted a plan 
to the Unesco General Conference for making some 
300 million adults between the ages of 15 and 50 literate 
within 10 years. The plan applied to illiterates living in 
Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
The real question is, are we willing to undertake such 
a job? We cannot blink the fact that if will be a very 
expensive operation. Unesco has calculated that it will 
cost about 1,900 million dollars for the ten years, four- 
fifths of which will have to come from natlonal budgets. 
But is it not much more expensive to allow 330 million 
brains to go to waste? And are there not other types 
of expenditure which are also very costly but which our 
planet could well afford to do without? 
A country with a high percentage of illiterates does 
not only suffer an intrinsic loss in terms of wasted man 
and mindpower; the progress of the cducated segment 
of the population is equally slowed down and made more 
difficult. It is a well-established fact that the degree 
of education of the adult population as a whole has 
a direct bearing on the lasting effects of the education 
glven to children in school. 
We can no longer afford to have, as we unfortnately 
do in many of the developing countries, an enormous 
gulf separating one group or generation from another, 
that 1s, those who have had a full, modern education 
from those who are illiterate. Such an unhealthy state 
of affairs disrupts the equilibrium and unity of a country 
and completely defeats any effort to create a nation-wide 
positive attitude toward scientific thinking and technology 
without which there can be no real development. 
A- educational system is or purports to be an 
organic whole, both intellectually and admi- 
nistratively, the different parts of which at thelr various 
levels are mutually dependent and intrinsically related. 
Hence it is neither desirable nor possible to plan the 
improvement or expansion of one particular stage 
of education in isolation from all the others. Obviously 
this does not mean that emphasis and resources must be 
equally divided throughout the entire school system. 
Priorities do exist, depending on the circumstances and 
situation of a country, and these of course make for 
differences, But it does mean that no serlous reform 
should be contemplated or carried out even In a priority 
area of the school programme except within the frame- 
work of an overall reform of the educational system as 
a whole. 
In my opintlon there is one principle which is basic 
to the organic unity of education and its administration, 
namely, that the general always conditions and prepares 
the speclalized. In the context of our discussion this 
means that speciallzed technical training always presup- 
poses a general technical education just as thls in turn 
implies a grounding in general sclence. And general 
science too must itself be viewed as an integral part of 
general education. 
To turn now to the-question of educational planning 
as a national policy, I am convinced that such planning 
is not only justified but absolutely indispensable. Three 
considerations lead me to make this statement. 
In the first place educational planning follows logically 
from the idea I have just referred to, namely, the organic 
unity of education. For obviously if students are to 
advance rationally from one stage of education to another 
within a total framework there must be some kind of 
plan. 
Secondly, planning carries with it the very great advan-

### 63297: 330 million brains for a new era

BRAINS FOR A NEW ERA (Cont'd) 
Education’s new role 
tage of not neglecting the importance of time as a factor 
in education, first determining the time available and then 
putting it to the best advantage. Educational planning, 
therefore, has a special added function for the developing 
countries, that of providing a much-needed standard or 
yardstick to gauge the future. 
In these countries, where the past offered little oppor- 
tunity for advancement, where the present is fraught 
with Impatience and the future charged with emotion, 
educational planning serves as a measure of caution 
since the practical necessity of making the best use of 
available resources is usually out of all proportion to 
actual needs. But it also commends itself, perhaps even 
to a greater extent, as an Invaluable mental exercise to 
prepare the way for the bullding of a sound future. It 
serves as a reminder to the developing countries that 
anything at all cannot happen at any time whatever 
and that even acceleration must obey the rule of rhythm 
and order. 
Thirdly, educational planning Is now being increasingly 
recognized as an Integral part of the planning of eco- 
nomic and social development as a whole; an essential 
part since 1t 1s basic to all the others and so broad In 
scope, but nonetheless only a part, which should be 
percelved as such. When it is so integrated, educational 
planning is of the greatest value In helping a country 
speed up its development since it becomes possible to 
gear the educational system to the specific needs and 
potentialities of the nation. This Is especially true for 
the training of scientific and technical personnel for 
they are the ones ‘who will be most directly involved in 
the actual development process. 
One of the most striking and encouraging aspects of 
the change taking place in the world’s educational 
thinking In recent years has been the growing recog- 
nition of precisely thls threefold need for educational 
planning. 
Unesco Is proud of the part it has played here and 
will Intensify its activities in this priority area of its 
programme. This year, for instance, Unesco is setting 
up an international institute with the specific purpose 
of tralning top-level specialists and promoting research 
In educational planning; and its reglonal centres now in 
operation’ or about to start functioning, mostly in con- 
Junction with the planning institutes of the U.N. Regional 
Economic Commissions, have the same purpose. I am 
certain that these institutions will all play a tremendous 
role in advancing the theory and practice of educational 
planning which Is still in its infancy, and will be able 
to help the member countrles of Unesco in setting up 
their own national centres and in training their own 
leaders in this fleld. 
PA oviease of what the organic unity of the 
education system implies together with metho- 
dical planning—these then are the frames of reference 
and the basle requisites for any realistic approach to the 
special problems facing the less developed countries in 
the training of scientific and technical personnel. 
Broadly speaking, there are three areas of major diffi- 
culty—technical education, university training and 
methods of sclence teaching. 
Probably the greatest need for expansion and impro- 
vement lies in the field of technical and vocational 
education, particularly at the secondary school level 
since this Is certainly the part of the school system of 
the most immediate importance for the growth of the 
developing countries. 
Here Unesco has devoted considerable effort In recent 
in a modern society 
years to helping the developing countries in two different 
ways: by ‘working on international standards for technical 
education, and by direct ald in the field. For three 
full years-a Unesco team of experts studied the question 
of standards, and in 1962 the UNEsco General Conference 
approved the terms of an international Recommendation 
one section of which specifically deals with standards of 
scientific and technical education. The drafting of this 
Recommendation was carried out in consultation with the 
International Labour Office concurrently with the revision 
of a similar Recommendation on vocational education by 
the International Labour Organization. 
R its operation activities In the fleld, Unesco 
has been giving its member states direct aid 
in setting up or developing national schools for post- 
secondary or higher technical education, thanks to large 
financial contributions made by the U.N. Special Fund. 
At present Unesco is the Special Fund’s executive agency 
for 22 projects (totalling about $24,500,000) for the estab- 
lishment of trade schools and higher institutes of tech- 
nology. This work, on what I would call the general 
technology level supports and serves as a basic foundation 
for that of the other bodies of the U.N. family who are 
engaged In specialized technological training in specific 
fields. 
As for the role of universities in training senior scien- 
tific and technical personnel, the importance of which 
cannot be stressed too strongly, it varies considerably 
since conditions in the less developed countries are by 
no means uniform. } 
In certain countries the problem is chiefly one of 
quantity. Here the key word is shortage: a shortage of 
universities, a shortage of instructors and professors, a 
shortage of equipment, mainly laboratory equipment, 
even a shortage at times of adequately prepared students 
arising from the inadequacies of secondary education. 
In other countries the problem is chiefly one of quality, 
that is, lack of organization and guidance services with 
the result that higher education is poorly adapted to the 
needs of a modern economy and technology. Thus most 
of the university students in these countries are advised 
to prepare for degrees in traditional subjects; and those 
who do major in science and technology often do so by 
chance or for personal reasons that have little to do with 
the real top-priority problems of economic and social 
development in their country. 
As a result, though these countries can boast eminent 
scientists in no way inferior to those of the more deve- 
loped countries, such men are few in number and lack 
sufficient fellow scientists and technicians to work with 
them or under them and on whom they can count or who 
can follow in their footsteps. In other words what is 
missing is the rank and file for the teams of scientists 
which are now becoming a standard feature of scientific 
work and a prerequisite for optimum results. 
And so, though we find a need for new universities in 
one place, for expansion in another and reform elsewhere, 
everywhere the development of universities remains an 
urgent, vital problem. Foreign study grants or scholarships 
no matter how generously endowed or wisely planned can 
never really compensate for the basic deficiencies I have 
just outlined. The evil of underdevelopment must be 
attacked at its very root by creating national structures 
for training qualified personnel where they do not exist 
and strengthening and improving them where they do. 
In the present state of things in the world there is no 
question but that study abroad is absolutely essential. 
But 1f practised indiscriminately it has a serious drawback 
in that it separates the fellowship holder from his native 
land and environment and may eventually detach him

from his own country and its needs. In point of fact it 
often happens that the student who goes abroad finds it 
difficult to fit into the pattern of his home country for 
psychological, social or economic reasons. He rarely uses 
more than a fraction of the knowledge and techniques 
acquired abroad after his return. Sometimes he simply 
never returns, and so an erosion or draining-off process 
begins with the most talented minds migrating from the 
underdeveloped nations to the developed ones. 
In reality training abroad is required chiefly to enable 
technicians and other specialists of an advanced or even 
professional level to acquire additional technological skills, 
and as such serves its full purpose only as an adjunct of 
the studies carried out at home within the pattern of the 
nation’s cultural, economic and social requirements. 
If a country is to build a sound foundation for its tech- 
nological development it is of paramount importance that 
science be taught in the schools at every level. For the 
point cannot be too often made that only meagre, super- 
ficial and short-lived progress can be achieved by the 
acquisition of technical skills or knowledge when the 
people of a nation are almost untutored in science. The 
real basis for development is a scientific civilization. 
Merely importing techniques without the science which 
This wide-eyed Philippines schoolgirl is one of the world’s 
lucky children. In countries of Latin America, Africa, the 
Middle East and Asia, 47% of the children of school age 
have no schools to attend. This is the measure of under- 
development in education which each year condemns 
millions of children to adult illiteray. How many potential 
scientists, engineers and technicians are thereby lost? 
Unesco ~ Pierre A. Pittet 
  
produces and serves them will not in itself equip the 
underdeveloped countries for the full utilization of thelr 
natural and human resources whereby they hope to 
achieve their great transformation. And though the 
importing of techniques results in a number of immediate 
improvements in certain domains it prolongs and rein- 
forces the state of dependency of the general economy 
of these countries. 
Now it can hardly be denied that, as a general rule, 
there are many things wrong with science teaching in 
the underdeveloped countries and that something must 
be done about it as quickly as possible. 
Too often there is a tendency in science classes to 
overstress the Importance of knowledge as such, especially 
practical knowledge, to the detriment of scientific thinking 
and the scientific attitude of mind. As a result very little 
of the real scientific attitude is more than superficially 
apparent in the thinking of the technical and other super- 
visory personnel who occupy subordinate and intermediate 
positions in society. In most cases the only thing learned 
from science Is a serles of formulas and prescriptions 
applied mechanically and unthinkingly. 
Teaching of this sort, which puls exercise of memory 
before the cultivation of the mind seems closer to trained- 
seal-learning than to genuine education. It Is the very 
antithesis of sclence which secks In essence to achieve 
the liberation of the mind as well as the mastery of 
nature... In the same manner it Is the antithesis of 
everything that the less-developed countries require 
most in order to regain control of thelr own destinies. 
HERE is much talk of the disequilibrium and 
tensions brought about in these countries by 
the conflict between the imported scientific and techno- 
logical civilization and the traditional national cultures. 
This certainly constitutes a problem such as arises when- 
ever a society is subjected to a process of swift change 
under the impact of outside factors. But the resultant 
conflict and tensions are chiefly due to the fact that 
science does not appear to these countries in its true gulse, 
that is, as a civilizatlon—indeed the only clvilization of 
potential universality—but as a kind of allen magle 
imparting sudden power. And if the civilization aspect of 
science is not apparent to those whose eycs are chiefly 
fixed on its more practical technological consequences, it 1s 
fundamentally because the heart of the matter—the scien- 
tific spirit and its methods—Iis neglected in the teaching of 
sclence. 
This teaching is particularly defective as regards the 
practice of the experimental method and the understand- 
ing of its significance as a general mental discipline. 
Training in the experimental method, which Is the most 
effective initiation to modern civilization for both young 
minds and young societies ardently desirous of progress, 
must contend with many obstacles in these countries. 
Some are due to local circumstances in that there is 
often a distressing shortage of even the most essential 
laboratory equipment for schools and universities, and 
purchases and gifts are not always wisely made. 
But the educational system Is responsible for other 
obstacles ‘which are no less scrious for being less directly 
apparent and can be overcome only by sustained effort. 
In many cases, curricula are ill-conceived, textbooks and 
teachers’ handbooks are not suited to local conditions, 
either material or psychological, and the training of 
teachers leaves a very great deal to be desired, turning 
to little account the substantial progress made over the 
past few years in both the psychology and technology 
of education. In all these spheres, Unesco is at pains to 
promote and back up the efforts of its member states. 
Everywhere the results are heartening, but like the funds 
available, they are limited. Far greater resources must 
be marshalled by international aid for this vital contri- 
bution to progress.

Colombia boasts the largest TV network in all Latin America. 
This year a special transmitter, Televisora Educativa, will begin 
to televise a series of educational programmes to classrooms of 
1,500 schools, many of them in isolated villages high up in the 
Andes. More than half Colombia's population lives in rugged 
mountain terrain, but TV. engineers have overcome communica- 
tions problems this presents by siting transmission stations 
high up on the mountain sides. Today TV programmes cover 
90 %, of the country. New experimental and teacher-training 
telecasts are due to begin this autumn and the regular school 
programmes next February. Above, announcer introduces an 
educational programme which is followed (left) on studio control 
panel. Right, studio teacher in “What do we know ? “ programme. 
Catching up with science’s dizzy pace 
However, it is questionable whether, even if national 
efforts and forelgn aid, both bilateral and International, 
are stepped up considerably, the educational system, as 
it is run at present and with its existing teaching methods, 
Is capable of meeting the tremendous quantitative and 
qualitative needs of technological development In 
our modern era of population explosion and qulckened 
sclentific progress. 
To this question, which it is the duty of educational 
leaders to ponder most seriously, I for one must resolutely 
answer no. I do not belleve that the educational system, 
with its present organization and methods, can meet the 
demands of the growth of our clvilization in the developed 
countries, let alone those in the underdeveloped areas. It 
is far too costly in terms of money and still more so in 
terms of qualified personnel, and the returns are not high 
enough. 
Education cannot make its full and decisive contribu- 
tion to the technological revolution which must take place 
in the less developed countries unless it ltself drastically 
overhauls its own technology, which in many respects 
is out of date. 
Changes are needed both in the utilization of staff and 
in the use of teaching alds. 
So far as staff is concerned, we all know what a long 
and costly process the training of teachers is at no matter 
what level. There can be no question of economizing in 
this vital field; far from it. But lt is rational to keep 
such qualified personnel for the most vital tasks in educa- 
tion. Experience has shown that for the performance 
of other duties, assistants, with a far less advanced train- 
ing, are quite adequate. The savings made in this way 
may be quite considerable. 
Even the machines now being tried out for programmed 
Instruction, by increasing the contribution made by the 
pupil's or student’s own efforts, reduce proportionately the 
need for personal coaching by the teacher and thus enable 
him to concentrate on the truly decisive steps in educa- 
tion. 
As for teaching alds, the audio-visual media for the 
recording and dissemination of information that have 
been created by modern technology over the past fifty 
years and are constantly being perfected open up for 
school and university education as well as for the out- 
of-school education of young people and adults tremen- 
dous possibilities as yet insufficiently explored and only 
half-heartedly exploited. It is undoubtedly at this point 
that the all too belated technological revolution of modern 
education should be carried through, particularly in those 
fields relating to scientific and technical training. 
Nowhere is the wholesale, systematic use of audlo- 
visual media more natural and surer of having a strong 
psychological impact than in those countries where, 
owing to the high proportion of illiterates, the image and 
the spoken word are the traditional media for the acquisi- 
tion, preservation and appreciation of ‘knowledge. The 
cinema, radio and television—not to overlook such valu- 
able teaching alds as fillmstrips and the gramophone— 
have demonstrated over and over, again how potent they 
are as means of conveying ideas, imparting knowledge, and 
expressing emotions and passions, too. Educators must 
lose no further time in discovering what the professional 
entertainers and political propagandists have already 
found out in other fields, the vital part these media can 
play in the progress of education in the developing 
countries. 
After considering the question of the training of scienti- 
fic and technical personnel against the general back- 
ground of educational underdevelopment, on the one hand, 
and of the educational system on the other, one must also

view it in the light of the demands of sclence itself and 
of its offshoot technology. 
The inexorable consequence of the quickened pace of 
progress in ’ nowledge, is the speed—which increases with 
each higher degree of specialization—with which the 
content of scientific education and technical training 
becomes unusable. I mean that the knowledge and prac- 
tices acquired through this education and training are 
being ever more rapidly outstripped by the constant 
advance of science and technology and must accordingly 
be revised and renewed. We have taken quite a long time 
to realize this, but in one generation the phenomenon has 
assumed such proportions that by now it has revolution- 
ized the position of scientific and technical education. 
The obligation to keep scientific and technical know- 
ledge constantly up to date affects teachers and taught 
alike. Teachers, particularly those at the university level 
or those concerned with specialized technology, must 
increasingly be prepared to attend intensive training and 
refresher courses. The same applies, with even greater 
force to those actually engaged in technical work. As 
for the general educated public which merely aspires to 
understanding the scientific factors underlying modern 
civilization, and accordingly to keeping in a position to 
play an active part in the life of this civilization, a veri- 
table permanent education must now be planned and 
organized for it. In neither case can scientific and tech- 
nical education stop short at the end of their formal 
studies. 
Does this mean that these studies should be extended 
and diversified so as to cover all the ever-growing expanse 
of science itself? Not at all. This would be an utterly 
exhausting and fruitless endeavour for schools and uni- 
versities, which are already showing all too many 
symptoms of hypertrophy and take up too much time and 
energy. No, they must deliberately confine themselves to 
providing a relatively general training, leaving more spe- 
clalized knowledge to be acquired later in direct contact 
with practical life. 
In my opinion it is not in schools or universities (though 
both can continue to promote educational activities 
beyond their scope) that thls renewal or extension of 
scientific education and technical training must be 
effected. It must take place wherever the malin part of 
an adult's life and energles are spent—at a place of work 
and during leisure hours. 
Places of work are ideal centres for specialized sclentific 
and technical education on a continuing basls. The major 
undertakings are becoming increasingly aware of this 
educational responsibility which they bear and which has 
incomparably wider Implications than the Immediate 
concern of Improving production and fostering harmonious 
relations between employers and workers. This Is a task 
on a scale commensurate with modern society as a whole. 
The fact is that the major industrial and commercial 
concerns are bound to assume more and more the cha- 
racter of specialized training establishments supplement- 
ing the work of schools and universities. The university, 
far from ignoring or vying with them, is in duty bound 
to keep In very close touch with them in order to stimulate 
and guide them, for they are its natural extenslon. 
As for the considerable £mount of leisure made avallable 
by industrialization, it is being increasingly taken over or 
at least controlled by the mass communication media. 
It 1s already clear that it is from these media that the 
vast majority of adults and even a proportion of those at 
school and unlversity derive the bulk of what I would 
term their scientific and technical culture. 
While the diversity of situations which distingulsh the 
less-developed countries from the industrialized ones call 
for different approaches to the problems of development, 
there are, however, no ways and means too novel or 
modern for the less developed countries in applying the 
solutions adopted for those problems. Quite the contrary. 
And this Is why the training of scientific and technical 
personnel is so urgent a necessity for them. For on this 
personnel depends whether or not they are to play a real 
part on the contemporary scene.

### 63301: Sensible shopping in the supermarket of science

SENSIBLE SHOPPING IN THE 
SUPERMARKET OF SCIENCE 
by Patrick M.S. Blackett 
Nobel Prize for Physics 
Prosi of formulating practical and 
realistic plans for the application of science 
and technology today face the government of many a 
newly emerging country. I specifically have in mind the 
new African nations, since, for various historic reasons, 
they are very short of trained manpower. 
The first thing which must strike, say, the Prime 
Minister or Minister of Finance of such a young nation, 
is that sclence and scientists are expensive and that thelr 
financial demands clash with the innumerable other 
demands on a country’s very limited financial resources, 
and still more limited foreign currency. "Even in the field 
of scientific and technical education alone, there will be 
the choice to be made of the proper allocation of finance 
between primary, secondary and higher education; 
or between tralning science teachers, scientifically trained 
administrators, research workers in pure and applied 
science, and engineers and technologists. Then there are, 
of course, the essential problems as to what the scientist 
and technologist should be used for. 
It is important to note that these main decisions have 
to be made by the Government. For the Government 
alone, in general, has the financial resources to carry out 
any worthwhile programme. Even when financial aid 
from other countries is available for specific educational 
and scientific projects, government assessment * and 
approval will generally be necessary. 
So today a great deal of very detailed decision-making 
in the scientific and technical field will fall on the govern- 
ment of these newly-emerging countries, and just at a 
time when vital political, economic, and social problems 
have to be solved. It is evident that a high priority for 
the educational system of an emerging country is the 
training of an adequate number of scientifically and 
technologically minded executives, able to make these 
complex and difficult decisions. 
Any minister or other high officlal from an emerging 
country attending the U.N. conference on sclence and 
technology will, no doubt, be in two minds about the vast 
display of scientific and technological developments which 
are dealt with in the hundreds of communications. On 
the one hand, the conference will make clear the great 
possibilities, inherent in modern scientific industrialization 
and agriculture, for the raising of the material standards 
of life of the emerging countries. On the other hand, it 
will confront such a statesman or official with a frighten- 
ing number of decisions which must be taken. For, even 
leaving new research and development out of account, the 
sheer ‘bulk of advanced technology which is available to 
be bought In the world today, by a nation with the cash, 
is staggering. 
Even rich countries like the United Kingdom do not 
buy every process, plant, machine tool or vehicle on sale. 
How much more must this be true of the newly-emerging 
countries, with their very limited resources both of finance 
and of trained manpower! Their representatives may feel 
like window-shoppers, admiring the riches of modern 
technology through the plate glass window of their limited 
resources in money and men. Moreover, when they have 
some money in their pockets they must clearly be very 
discriminating purchasers. 
In considering the formulation of national policy in 
relation to the application of science and technology to 
the increase of material wealth, it is useful here to 
distinguish three main aspects. 
The first is that of known and available technology. 
Most of the most urgent needs of the emerging countries 
in the early stages of development come into this category. 
To set up a motor bus service, it is necessary to have the 
foreign exchange to buy the vehicles and fuel, and the 
technical schools to train the drivers and repair personnel, 
but no research or development at all is needed. Nor is 
new research and development required to set up an 
airline, or a television system, or an electricity supply, or 
a sewage system and piped water supply, or the majority 
of normal manufacturing plants. 
Though such projects do not involve any appreciable 
research and development, they do require a large supply 
of technically and seientifically-trained personnel to run 
them. A blg increase of indigenous-trained sclentific, 
technological and administrative personnel will be needed 
before a country can make full use of the known techno- 
logies without undue and expensive reliance on foreign 
personnel. A major task of a new nation’s educational 
system must be to provide as soon as possible the necessary 
technological intelligentsia to make use of all the known 
and avallable technology which the country can afford to 
buy. 
Prominent among the vital tasks which such trained 
people will have to tackle is the formulation of a sensible 
“shopping list”—I mean by this homely phrase the deci- 
sion as to what to buy and what not to buy in the world’s 
well-stocked supermarket for production goods and pro- 
cesses. In one sense the UNCSAT conference is a cata- 
logue of what is available, and so should be of great value 
to the citizens of the emerging countries who have the 
responsibility for making these decisions. One cannot 
over-emphasize the importance of recognising the necessity 
for wise choice of what to buy. Incidentally, the mere 
readlng and digesting of the mountainous mass of the 
conference documents will provide a major task for the 
sclentists and engineers of the emerging countries. 
] HE second most important aspect of the 
application of science and technology to a 
less developed country is that concerned with problems 
which are related to the special conditions of the country, 
and the solution of which must be done on the spot. 
Prominent among these, of course, are those special 
aspects of agriculture and medicine which have specific 
local significance and so cannot he studied elsewhere. 
Then there are many problems in meteorology, geology, 
geophysical surveying, road building and housing, where 
original research and development related to local condi- 
tions is required. In addition, many new technological 
problems arise in the setting up of local industries, due 
to the special properties of the local fuels, raw materials, 
textiles, foodstuffs, etc. 
In relation to these problems, the importance of a first 
rate information service is vital. It must be made as easy 
as possible for the research and development personnel 
to be kept continuously aware of the state of general 
world knowledge on a particular subject, so as not to be 
led by ignorance into expensive researches to find out 
what is already well known. The opposite danger is to 
assume too easily that some process, technique or method, 
which has long heen in successful use in some other 
country, can be transferred without modification to new

‘ 
    
   
   
surroundings. Some of the most valuable research pro- 
jects in the early stages of a country’s development will 
surely lie in the imaginative adaption of known methods 
to local conditions. 
There is one ever imminent danger in such fields as 
medicine and agriculture. This is, that the policy~ 
makers may become so impressed by the latest triumphs 
of science that the more humdrum requirements of public 
health and good husbandry may get too little emphasis. 
The danger of relying on wonder drugs and neglecting 
the plumbing is very real. Historians of the future may 
be amazed that our present epoch had the genius to 
discover penicillin, but had not the wit to give the ma- 
jority of mankind a sewage system up to the technological 
level of River Valley civilization 5,000 years ago. 
The third aspect is the group of new technologies which 
are not yet in general use but are still under development, 
mainly in the technologically advanced countries. I refer, 
for instance, to such things as solar heat, fuel cells, 
desalination of water, and hosts of improved processes 
and manufactured goods. Though a close watch must 
be kept on these developments, I am convinced that the 
national economic and technological planning of a new 
country’s development, over the next decade or so, should 
be based on what is now known. 
Useful technological innovation, when it arises, should 
be welcomed as a windfall profit: it should not be relied 
on for planning purposes. In fact, most of the now

emerging new technologies are likely to be of only mar- 
ginal economic importance to those countries, which are 
in the early stages of development, compared with the 
possible gains from fully utilizing existing technologles. 
For often, but not always, new developments like nuclear 
power, desalination of water, etc., are expensive in capital 
cost—and it Is capital, particularly In the form of foreign 
exchange, that emerging countries tend to be most short 
of. 
It is essential that the applied sclentists and technolo- 
gists of the emerging countries develop a sound sense of 
the economic realities of the related phases of research, 
development and production. The first two stages are 
expensive. Only when the last stage of production is 
reached is there any increase in material wealth. Though 
no one would admit to believing that modern science is 
a magic wand to be waved over a poor country to convert 
it Into a rich one, not a few seem to act as if it were 
true! In fact the advance of scientific technology can 
only be a part of a concerted national programme of 
educational, economic, industrial and social change. Only 
when integrated into such a plan will the full fruits of 
scientific technology be reaped.

### 63303: A Face-lift for the science curriculum

ENCE CURRICULUM by Jerome B. Wiesner 
  
Soc today is In an evolutionary state, in 
which each advance of our knowledge of the 
natural ‘world has a series of consequences, frequently 
unforeseen and probably unforeseeable In detail. 
For example, one consequence of the automobile not 
written in the original specifications Is the congested city. 
Improved health measures may mean a greatly reduced 
mortality rate, but without accompanying Improvements 
in agricultural methods or the Industrial base, they may 
result In greater impoverishment. Widespread use of 
nuclear energy for industrial purposes may provide an 
answer to some problems of development, but as we can 
already see, it may also pose the serious problem of con- 
tamination of our environment. 
Each of these advances therefore poses new problems 
and new challenges, forcing man through science and 
technology to make hard choices as to how he will use his 
technical advances. The wiser and better informed these 
decisions, the more chance we have of moving towards 
better social conditions and of avoiding the fate of the 
dinosaur. 
I do not want to minimize the problems of transfer and 
adaptation of technology from one culture to another. 
Indeed, the variety of cultures offers opportunity for 
experimentation in the application of science and techno- 
logy to development. With the Increasing number of inde- 
pendent countries we can have a variety of experiments 
with new approaches to old and new problems. 
The problem of transfer may indeed work both ways. I 
have not attempted to differentiate between the more and 
less developed countries for, in fact, all countries are 
faced with the same need for wise application of science 
and technology to solution of thelr problems. 
Many of the presently less developed countries have an 
opportunity to leap-frog the problems and patterns en- 
countered in the economically advanced countries. This 
age is newer than many of us realize; we should not 
commit the error of copying old ways that are being 
replaced by new ones. Many new countries have the 
opportunity to experiment and produce something 
better; in the older countries we should like to be in the 
position of being able to copy their innovations. For 
example, the communications satellite will soon be avail- 
able and in many situations will be superior to present 
techniques for internal communications, 
It is obvious that an adequate level of education is an 
absolute prerequisite to enable any society to incorporate 
new ideas and attitudes Into its development process. 
But a more subtle and exciting observation is that educa- 
tion itself can benefit from the application of research. 
Here the needs are monumental in all countries and 
the fleld ripe for the kind of systematlc research and 
development on the educational process itself that has 
only recently begun. 
I have become convinced that if we pool our best efforts 
dramatic Improvements in teaching and learning are 
possible. I can speak on this subject with some feeling. 
We In the United States have come to realize that our 
educational system has not kept pace in the way we feel 
necessary with the world created by sclentific and techno- 
logical advance. Accordingly a number of the scientists 
and technologists in our unlversities, who heretofore have 
limited thelr efforts to traditional flelds of research, are 
now applylng the methods of organized research and 
development to education, not only in the universities, 
but also at primary and secondary levels. 
As a result of thelr initlative over the past few years 
it has been demonstrated, repeatedly and on a grand 
scale, that educational quality In our schools can be 
vastly Improved. I am firmly convinced that the same 
methods can be applled, taking account of glven varla- 
tlons, to greatly improve and speed the development of 
new educational systems. 
0 NE aspect of the effort to improve educational 
quality Is the development of new alds for 
teaching. The blackboard and the textbook have done 
good service for half a millennium, but that does not mean 
that the presentation of information cannot profit from 
a little re-design. In these experimental programmes, we 
are beginning to make new use of media that until 
recently have been the province principally of the enter- 
talnment Industry—film, tape, records, radlo and tele- 
vision. And we are also experimenting with teaching 
devices of an entirely novel character—new methods of 
instruction and new types of apparatus, not to replace, 
but to enrich the work of the teacher, the indispensable 
human factor in education. 
Our sclentlsts and technologists also are working on 
curriculum structure and content. They are seeking to 
insure that fundamentals are taught; that the informa-

A lesson from the entertainment industry 
tlon presented is up to date, accurate and in perspective; 
and that the method of teaching and the content impart 
the excitement and challenge of the subject to the student 
—whether he is a potential scientist or mathematician 
or technologist, or one ‘who ‘will pursue other occupa- 
tions. 
Although our experience has so far concentrated on 
sclence and mathematics and foreign languages, we are 
beginning to extend this approach—to the teaching of 
social studies, history, writing, literature, and also the 
practical arts, in order to develop the skills necessary for 
work in the new industries and in the new agricultural 
enterprises. 
The preparation of first-rate curriculum materials in 
a subject is a complex operation in research and develop- 
ment. It requires the use of teams of workers from a wide 
variety of backgrounds. The teams comprise not only the 
outstanding masters of the fleld, but also outstanding 
teachers at the appropriate levels, specialists who have 
conducted significant research on the learning process, 
and technleians such as artists, photographers, laboratory 
and shop workers, who can help in devising new methods 
of presentation. 
Like research and development in other fields, the 
creation of new educational techniques also requires a 
large and genuine testing component. New curriculum 
materials are not made generally available until they are 
demonstrated to work in the classroom, in an experimental 
process that can involve many schools over several 
years, 
Ws are the implications for the less developed 
lands for this growing experience in improving 
educational quality? The spirit of innovation, the team 
approach, the development of new media and techniques, 
and classroom experimentation would appear applicable 
to new and old countries alike—with the added advantage 
for some countries that they are starting relatively fresh 
in facing their educational problems. 
This new approach to education could make possible a 
massive attack on the problem of illiteracy, from which 
so many of our countries suffer. To attain basic literacy, 
as well as scientific literacy, true co-operation is in order. 
There is no rule saying that the citizens of one country 
—experts in subject matter and experts in new teaching 
devices—cannot work with the citizens of another country 
in developing new materials. People with distinet kinds 
of special experience may also be necessary on the teams. 
There may be problems of special frames of reference, 
for example, exploiting local flora and fauna in a biology 
course or—to cite a more subtle problem—teaching expe- 
rimental science in a culture that traditionally depreciates 
manual labour, 
In some cases, especially in mathematics, some of the 
curriculum materials already developed might be useful 
directly in other lands. In fact, some efforts for such 
transfer are already under way, as are some efforts to 
use teams made up of people from many countries to 
develop new curriculum materials. 
There is one aspect to improving educational quality 
which dwarfs all others: the preparation of teachers to 
teach the new courses—both the retraining of teachers 
now teaching traditional courses, and the education of 
new teachers. A large number of teachers is needed and 
so is a large number of teachers of teachers. But if we 
are willing to experiment a little in finding more efficient 
ways to prepare people for both tasks, it may not ne- 
cessarily take generations to build up a large supply of 
skilled professionals. 
Mo of our colleges and universities have set 
up special institutes to retrain teachers, both 
in short summer programmes and academic year pro- 
grammes. In some schools we have tried establishing a 
kind of interneship in education, an arrangement under 
which the new teacher works for a period of time under 
the supervision of a master teacher. We are also making 
use of local broadcasting facilities, using both taped and 
live programmes, to help teachers on a ‘week-by-week 
basis in using new instructional materials. 
To conclude, I belleve that educational development 
must go hand in hand with scientific and technical de- 
velopments. Isolated technical projects, however worthy 
by themselves, do not add up to development unless they 
fit into an integrated national effort. There is a role in 
the development process for all branches of science and 
technology, for all the academic disciplines. We need a 
better sense of priorities—a closer identification of those 
problems most in need of technological attention. 
In this way the United Nations Specialized Agencies 
will gain better guidelines for orienting thelr own pro- 
grammes of technical assistance in support of the deve- 
lopment process.

| N 1942, Manipal was a village with a few hundred 
Inhabitants on the outskirts of the town of Udipl in 
the State of Mysore, southern India, hardly distingulshable from scores 
of similar hamlets in the region. Today, Manipal is a town of nearly 
10,000 inhabitants. It has a medical school, an engineering college, a 
college of arts, letters and science, a college of commerce, a schoo! of 
music, three elementary schools and a secondary school. How did this 
obscure village become a thriving town and a vigorous educational and 
cultural centre? 
The transformation of Manipal has come about through the vision and 
determination of a country doctor named T. M. A. Pai who sparked a 
remarkable community enterprise In education and science. Dr. Pai, 
who was born in a village not far from Manipal 67 years ago, studied at 
the University of Madras and after obtaining his medical degree returned 
to practise in his native village. 
As he went hls rounds, Dr. Pai mused on many problems, but the one 
that preoccupied him most of all was India's lack of schools, not only

In his own area there were no facilities for higher education and he

he help them? : 
The answer came in 1940 when, after discussing the problem with 
leading citizens of Udipi, he decided to create an educational co- 
operative to give the area the schools it needed. Two years later, in 
1942, his courageous project came into being with the foundation of the 
Academy of General Education at Manipal. The first aims of the Aca-

supporting or building schools and colleges. A vigorous drive was 
undertaken to enlist support and donations from all sections of the 
community. 
The project started modestly enough with a few vocational courses but 
soon expanded to include two primary, a higher elementary and a secon- 
dary school. By 1949 Dr. Pal was able to enter the field of higher 
education with the establishment of an Arts and Science College—later 
named the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College to honour the memory of 
the great Indian leader. 
Four years later, in 1953, he astounded educationalists by setting up 
India’s first privately-sponsored medical college, the Kasturba Medical 
College, named after the wife of Mahatma Gandhi. This was one of 
Dr. Pai’'s most significant achievements. He and his friends had been 
moved by the plight of the many young men for whom there were no 
places in existing medical colleges in India, so they launched the 
Kasturba Medical College on a co-operative basis, asking the parents 
of the students who would benefit from its tuition to contribute equal 
amounts to the project. Sixty-seven per cent of the first class graduated 
as doctors in 1959, 
In 1960 a large teaching hospital was added to the College. This has 
provided clinical facilities for the students and has helped to relieve 
some of the region's urgent medical problems. 
Today the Academy has 800 medical students, 700 at the Polytechnic 
School, 1,200 at the College of Arts, Letters and Science, 200 at the 
School of Commerce. The primary schools founded by Dr. Pal have 
900 boys and girls, the secondary school 550 and the School of Music, 
350. . 
Dr. Pai's achievement is a triumph of educational planning and educa- 
tional financing from co-operative sources, for today the Academy's 
resources amount to £250,00 ($700,000).

completed. Shown 
here is a model of 
the teaching hos- 
pital complex that 
will have 1,200 
beds and complete 
facilities for the 
students and staff. 
I: 1957 the United Arab Republic established 
a new university at Assiut in Upper Egypt. 
One of the main problems of a modern university is 
how to maintain balance between three functions: 
mm educating the youth and preparing them to assume 
their role as leading citizens of their country, 
m providing the country with a centre of higher thought 
and culture, and 
mm making the country’s contribution to the develop- 
ment of human knowledge and science through the 
pursuit of research. 
In highly developed countries the last function may 
tend to outgrow the other two, while in developing 
countries stress may often have to be laid upon the first. 
In some cases too, the second function may also either 
be overlooked or overstressed in a way that diminishes 
the possibility of national contribution to peaceful human 
development through the work of the university. 
Prior to 1952, the United Arab Republic had three 
modern universities together with Al-Azhar, the tradi- 
tional theological university of the Muslim World. These, 
however, were not enough to meet the needs of the 
developing country. They were also all concentrated in 
the north in the two single large cities of the country, 
Calro and Alexandria. 
This meant that in the provinces of the south the young 
people were deprived of an equal opportunity to attend 
university. Only the ‘well-to-do could afford the long 
journey and the costly life of the far cities. Some 
800 kilometres extending along the narrow strip of the 
Nile valley south of Cairo had no higher educational 
services. Not a single institute of higher education 'was 
established south of the capital. Over six millions of the 
population had to send their children to Cairo or further 
north if they were to get any form of higher education. 
Once in Cairo or Alexandria for university education

University of Assiut 
lasting from four to seven years, students from the 
southern provinces tended to look for jobs in the north 
instead of going back to their home areas. This meant 
a regular depletion of human resources. Indeed the 
southern part of the country, which was once the seat 
of power in anclent Egypt, became badly neglected In 
many respects. 
The idea of establishing a university in Assiut, the 
capital city of the region of Upper Egypt, goes back to 
1949. But the effective step to bring the project Into 
existence was taken in 1955. After two years of planning 
and preparation, two faculties for sclence and engineering 
were inaugurated in 1957. In Upper Egypt, the High 
Dam of Aswan was to be bullt and schemes for industrial 
as well as agricultural development had to follow. We 
had to think of the need for technicians to carry out the 
vast programmes which were to change the face of this 
ancient land. This meant the need for faculties of 
science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, veterinary 
medlcine, business administration, etc. 
But the potentialities of the country for the establish- 
ment of such a modern university had to be carefully 
surveyed. A new modern university would need, above 
all, qualified staff In large numbers for teaching and 
research work. It was realized that the university would 
have to be bullt up in stages, and that priorities in setting 
up one faculty after another would have to be governed 
by needs and avallability of staff. It was also decided 
to start with the first year enrolment of students in each 
faculty and to let it grow year by year, 
In 1958 a third faculty, agriculture, was added. In 
1960 the faculty of medicine was Inaugurated and ‘In 
1961 new departments of pharmacy were added. In the 
same year a new faculty of veterinary medicine was 
established. This year the faculty of commerce and 
business administration will be added. In following years 
new faculties for dentistry and for arts (humanities),

### 63306: At Assiut, the ancient capital of Upper Egypt, a new university is born

A UNIVERSITY IS BORN (Cont'd) 
Campus for 16,000 students 
will complete the picture of the university. It Is a plan 
which has been carefully prepared and which will take 
some 10 to 12 years to Implement in full. 
At Assiut there were no bulldings avallable as a per- 
manent campus for the new university. A good secondary 
school building was taken as temporary headquarters. 
New land was purchased for the campus within easy 
reach of different parts of the city, totalling some 370 
acres, to comprise the whole campus with Its scientific 
departments, its recreation and sports grounds and a 
university city to.house students and staff. It comprises 
also the site for university hospitals as well as an 
experimental farm. 
Of course for an agricultural country as densely popu- 
lated as ours, it was ‘a pity that the university should 
take such space from the arable land. But it was plan- 
ned that once the faculty of agriculture was established, it 
should undertake a project of reclamation covering at 
least four times as much of desert land in the vicinity. 
The reclaimed land ‘would then be handed over to 
landless peasants in the area according to agrarian 
reform laws. This will not only afford good training 
opportunities for our students; it will also show the 
local community that the university did not deprive 
them of good arable land. It will also help integrate 
more intimately the work of the university with the 
efforts being made In the area to raise the standard of 
living of the people. 
A plan was then drawn up for the 
building of a campus. A careful study 
was made of present and future 
requirements ‘with possibility for expan- 
i a slon. It was found that the university 
would need some 30 buildings for its scientific departments, 
apart from the public buildings for library, hospitals, 
recreation, etc. The programme was spread over some 10 
years for the principal buildings, with an additional two or 
three years for the completion of auxiliary ‘buildings. 
A professor of architecture was appointed as head of 
the architecture department of the faculty of engineering 
and put in charge of the planning of the site and prepara- 
tlon of the draft designs for building. Some of the 
buildings, such as the hostels for students and the blocks 
of flats for the staff, were also designed by members of the 
stafl. 
It Is estimated that the total cost of the campus will be 
in the neighbourhood of eight milllon Egyptian pounds. 
The programme started late In 1958 with the building of 
large 'workships for engineering (and where most of our 
furniture and some of our scientific apparatus is now being 
manufactured) and part of our recreation grounds. It 
is hoped that by 1968-1969 the whole campus will be 
completed. It will accommodate some 12,000 students 
(attending 8 or 9 faculties), and eventually 16,000 students. 
The question of style of buildings was also carefully 
considered. The ldea of a classical style was discarded. 
We are building a university in the second half of the 
20th century, and feel that it should reflect its time and 
age. 
  
So we adopted a modern style, adapted it to the local 
conditions of a warm climate (such as double external 
walls, double roof, good orientation to provide insulation, 
etc.). The buildings are of a concrete frame, with red- 
brick outside walls and large glass windows, especially on 
the shady side. . ) 
The purchase of up-to-date scientific equipment is 
necessary for the proper functioning of any university. 
As our university at Assiut 1s composed principally of 
“science” (rather than humanistic) faculties,” more

a hieroglyph meaning “to unite’. 
apparatus Is needed for this work. That was why we 
had to start in our bullding programme with the work- 
shops, which have so far been able to provide us with 
some of the simpler apparatus for teaching, as well as 
some of the apparatus especially designed for research. 
Equipping a scientific department with apparatus needs 
very careful planning to avoid waste and make one’s 
funds go as far as possible. It also implies other 
difficulties connected with obtaining hard currency. 
Another problem we faced was that we had to get our 
equipment from different countries, East and West. This 
entailed special training of technicians and, in some 
instances, the sending of technicians abroad, or receiving 
the help of foreign technicians for short terms at Assiut. 
One other problem which we had to tackle was the repair 
of instruments. But the workshops of the university 
were of invaluable help in this respect. 
It is difficult to estimate the total cost of apparatus 
for a new university, for this depends on the number of 
scientific departments to be equipped and the total of 
student enrolment. We have so far Invested over 
1,500,000 Egyptian pounds. But we are still less than half 
equipped in some of our newer faculties. 
As for books, we began collecting some during the two 
years of planning before we went to Asslut In 1957. We 
started with a nucleus of more than 50,000 volumes for our 
library. But we found real difficulty in getting back- 
numbers of scientific periodicals. The university is 
setting up its own press to publish a “Bulletin of Science 
and Technology,” as well as text books prepared by the 
staff and sold to students at cost price. 
Staffing of the scientific departments was probably the 
most difficult of all our problems. Fortunately, when the 
idea of the university ‘was first conceived In 1949, some 50 
graduates from the other universities were sent abroad for 
Ph. D. work in the various disciplines. They represented 
the nucleus of our first faculties. The staff of the 
university was then regularly added to year by year from 
returning members of missions or by other recruitment 
for leading posts. Gradually we also recelved a small 
number of visiting professors from other countries, mostly 
through cultural exchange agreements. ’ 
In 1955 a vigorous programme for research at universi- 
tles in Europe and America was started. By the summer 
of 1962 we already had some 130 men and women doing 
research abroad, together with another 40 to follow. Some 
of these have already finished their preparation abroad 
and are returning to assume teaching posts. Nearly 1,500 
At its foundation, the University of Assiut gave priority 
to science and ‘engineering faculties. Already 500 
science and engineering students have graduated to 
join those now carrying out development programmes 
in Upper Egypt. Below, buildings of science faculty.

Bird's-eye view of future campus of the University of Assiut to be completed in 1969-70. Covering 
about 250 acres, it will have 30 buildings for science and allied subjects alone and a total student 
body of 16,000. Dormitories are at [ower right below stadium. Humanities faculty is just above tip 
of minaret. Faculties of science and agriculture line the northern edge alongside irrigation canal and 
those of engineering and medicine the southern side. At left is the university teaching hospital. 
members are now abroad and will occupy teaching or other 
posts upon their return. Thus the acute problem of 
staffing the University of Assiut is being gradually solved. 
Ours was to be essentially a provincial university. It 
was decided that our places should be allocated primarily 
to students taking their secondary school certificate from 
schools in the five southern provinces of the country. 
This meant that the new university would alleviate 
pressure on the universities in Calro and Alexandria, 
Entry into all universities in the United Arab Republic 
Is based upon open competition between students finishing 
their secondary education. In addition to the numbers 
accepted from the country, 10% of the total is allocated 
to students from different Arab and other countries. At 
present girls make up 8 to 10% of our enrolment, but the 
percentage is steadily rising. 
The establishing of our university in Upper Egypt has 
provided a new opportunity for girls in this part of the 
country to obtain a university education. At present 
nearly 80% of our students are from the five southern 
provinces of the country. The University of Assiut started 
with 500 undergraduate students and some 10 research 
students. The total number (including research students) 
was nearly 6,000 during the academic year 1962-1963. 
As in most other countries, our youth justly feel that 
we are becoming an engineering society. So most of our 
boys (and many of our girls) prefer to join the engineering 
faculty. Next In preference are the faculties of medicine 
(and pharmacy) and science. 
As already mentioned, Assiut is a small provincial city 
of some 120,000 inhabitants. Before the university was 
established, the town had limited accomodation for 
visitors from outside. It was never really a tourist city. 
It was also not in the tradition of its families to accept 
strangers as paying guests. So there were difficulties for 
the university to establish itself in the city. Living 
conditions were not easy for staff or for students. 
Eight blocks of new apartment buildings were rented 
by the university and converted into hostels for students. 
The bullding plan included the construction of the 
university city already mentioned, to house, when complet- 
ed, some 3,000 students. 
An appeal for funds was made and the sum of 65,000 
Egyptian pounds was collected from private donations. 
This was sufficient to build the first block of buildings 
for students. Ten more blocks will follow. Also three 
blocks of flats have already been built for 24 families of 
the staff. Other blocks will follow. A new housing 
scheme was also started by the local authorities two years 
ago. So the face of our little town is quickly being 
changed. It is estimated that within 10 years or so, the 
university will have added (directly or indirectly) to this 
provincial city about 20% of its population. This will give 
a new pattern to the social life In Assiut. 
Life in the campus is gradually taking shape. Ours 
will be one of the rather rare examples of a complete 
campus, comprising both academic buildings and living 
accomodation for a section of the staff and student 
population. At the same time, recreational amenities are 
gradually being added. The recreation grounds were 
actually amongst the earliest facilities to be provided. A 
stadium 1s already being used by students and other youth 
of the city. It is in our plan to have all our facilities 
open to the public. This includes the stadium, the club, 
the halls, the theatre, as well as the public library. 
The university has its own department 
of public relations to organize contact 
: | with the local community. Extramural 
| J activities and extension services include 
Assiut and the whole region north and 
south of it. The faculty of agriculture gives advice and 
guidance to peasants and farm groups. The hospital is 
designed to serve the whole region and to be a centre for 
health services and research. Even the workshops of the 
faculty of engineering are in the service of any citizen 
who wishes to avall himself to their services at cost price. 
The university of Asslut is gradually bullding up its status 
as a provincial institution in the service of the commun- 
ity and the whole nelgbourhood. 
  
Yet even thls new university Is not limited In its ser- 
vices to the area In which it is located. It is in our 
tradition in this land to consider ourselves as an integral 
part of the Arab people as a whole. In addition to the 
percentage of seats reserved for students from Arab and 
other neighbouring countries, these students are accorded 
every care to facilitate thelr stay with us. Already 
students from more than 10 countries, coming from as 
far as Malaya, are studying in this small university. The 
numbers of students and the countries from which they 
come are gradually Increasing. This is a welcome feature 
of our university education. 
Our university Is thus playing an ever-increasing part 
in our national life and development, as an Institution 
for men and women citizens of a growing nation.

### 63308: African metamorphosis

IX years ago, Liberia was the only independent 
country in West Africa (1). The rest of the 
area was divided between the British, French, Spanish and 
Portuguese. Today, only Gambia (a British crown colony) 
and Portuguese and Spanish Guinea with less than 2% 
of the population are dependent countries. The rest of 
the population, totalling more than 80 million inhabitants, 
Is divided among 15 independent states (2) of which 
Nigeria alone has 40 million people and Ghana six and a 
half million people. 
In spite of ample land, minerals and forest wealth, 
West Africa remains a poor region. None of the countries 
has an annual income per head of 200 dollars. Many in 
fact have only about 100 dollars a head per year. 
The main problem of development in West Africa there- 
fore is how to raise the levels of production so that the 
people can come somewhere near the 800 dollars per head 
which is earned in Western Europe, not to speak of the 
2,000 dollars per head which is earned in the United 
States. It will require a phenomenal rise in productivity 
for the real incomes in West Africa to approach those of 
the developed world. 
While the West African leaders and their professional 
advisers are puzzled about how to tackle this problem, 
the higher consumption standards of the developed 
countries are being communicated to West African 
(1) West Africa is here understood as the area stretching 1,700 
miles from Cape Verde near Dakar on the west coast to the 
Cameroons mountains in the east and from the Gulf of Guinea 
in the south to the northern boundaries lying in the Sahara 
Desert which starts roughiy some 600 to 700 miles from the 
coast. It covers an area of about 2,400,000 square miles and 
has a population of about 80 million.

villagers, who In turn are no longer content to remain 
without the amenities of good food. good housing, good 
health and good education for their children. Most of 
the goods and services which go to satisfy these higher 
levels of living are still imported goods. The need arises 
therefore to find the foreign exchange to pay for develop- 
ment as well as current Imports if standards of living 
are not to fall. 
W:= AFRICA is a producer of primary commo- 
ditles. Industries are almost non-existent. In 
each of the countries, the economies have been geared to 
the needs of European powers with which they were 
associated. Thus, each country is heavily oriented to 
the production of one or two commodities only at the 
expense of a more balanced development In the economy. 
Ghana is heavily dependent on cocoa, Nigeria on cocoa, 
oil-palm and ground-nuts, Liberia on rubber, and the 
former French West African countries on cotton. 
The heavy dependence on primary production for export 
makes these countries victims of the whims of foreign 
trade, producing in them large fluctuations of Income. 
The bitter experience of cocoa farmers in the 1930's 
caused a stagnation in the cocoa production of Ghana 
for some twenty years. One aspect of this pattern of 
trade is that each European power held a monopoly of 
the trade of each dependent territory. That is why even 
today exports and imports of the IFrench-speaking coun- 
tries of Africa are still almost exclusively with France 
and those of Nigeria and Ghana with Britain. 
These countries have therefore been unable to establish 
among themselves an internal West African market which 
could widen their arcas of exchange and gain for them 
the economies of large interdependent production.

At the same time, Puerto Rico has transferred during this 
twenty-year period some 30 to 60,000 of her surplus or 
under-employed population per year to the United States.

  I: Is not surprising therefore that the same 
pattern of trade should produce in a little, 
resource-poor island of 2-1/2 millions a per capita income 
of 565 dollars ‘while producing in the large relatively rich 
region of West Africa with 80 million people under 100 
dollars per head per year. As West Africa has not the 
advantages of Puerto Rico therefore, the problem arises 
how best to develop an Internal West African market 
large enough to stimulate all-round production while 
retaining the present expert products upon which the 
countries depend at the moment. 
What of the resource situation In West Africa ? Unlike 
Asla, fortunately, West Africa’s population is not alarm- 
ingly large. But, with the rapid improvements going on 
In the health of the people, it can be expected that the 
population will rise, thus creating greater pressure upon 
the land. At the present over 70% of the people are 
farmers, mainly peasant subsistence farmers with pro- 
ductivity only about a fifth that of United States farmers. 
This low productivity of West African agriculture can be 
explained by the very low level of capital Input into 
agriculture, poor techniques and deficiencies in the land. 
     
    
T= failure of the British attempt to mechanize 
agriculture in East Africa illustrates in a dra- 
matic way some of the problems of increasing agricultural 
productivity in West Africa. It has heen found, for 
example that the rock fragments of West African soil are 
such that a caterpillar tractor only consolidates the sur- 
face into a hard macadam layer. Thus is ruled out the 
majority of mechanical cultivators at present used in 
temperate countries. Dlsc ploughs have also been found 
unsuitable and frequent ploughing only ploughs out all 
the goodness from the land. 
Until agricultural scientists devise suitable equipment 
and techniques for the soil, therefore, it appears there 
will be no alternative to the small hoe and shifting culti- 
vation. In spite of those disadvantages, agriculture 
remains the most important source from which surplus 
can be generated for other development. Effort Is 
therefore needed to ralse this surplus. 
In addition to agriculture, there is some evidence of 
substantial mineral resources In West Africa. Gold and 
diamonds are at present exploited in Ghana, bauxite in 
Guinea and Ghana, tin, coal and petroleum in Nigeria, 47

Nation-builders in transition 
iron in Liberia and Slerra Leone, phosphates in Togoland, 
manganese In Ghana, and saline salts In Mauritania. 
Further geological work is required to determine the 
extent of these deposits. 
Although West Africa has ample land and a not 
ungenerous supply of mineral resources, the countries are 
still very poorly supplied with capital, whether as fixtures 
like houses, roads, railways, or as equipment lke ma- 
chines, transport vehicles and agricultural tools. In fact, 
capital accumulation has been going on at the rate of 
about 5% a year, but at that rate capital formation can 
barely keep pace with the rate of population growth, let 
alone cover any increase In the standard of living. 
I: is considered by some people that the rate 
of capital formation should be upped to 10% 
or 15% if development is to accelerate. But with income 
so low, it Is not the easiest thing to save such a large 
percentage for capital formation. Like other poor coun- 
tries of the world therefore, West Africa is caught in the 
proverbial vicious circle of poverty. But how can this 
circle of low investment and low productivity be broken? 
The answer produced by the West African governments 
was to create the social overhead capital so that directly 
productive activities can be established or expanded. 
During Ghana's first five-year development plan, for 
example, a first class trunk-road system was established 
running from north to south and from east to west and

is higher production

year. Over 709% are

also linking the major urban areas of the country. 
Several hundred miles of secondary roads, untarred but 
quite adequate, radiated to most of the small villages and 
hamlets in the country. 
A new harbour and its 40,000 service township was 
planned and substantially completed. A university was 
built, the school system expanded and health centres built 
throughout the country. Telephone and electric lights 
more than doubled. This development was carried out 
during a period when the country was a net exporter of 
capital. This was due mainly to the good price of cocoa 
which financed some 90% of the 130 million pound pro- 
gramme. 
In the Second Development Plan, the emphasis shifted 
from the infra-structure to concentration on agricultural 
improvement, development of industry and expansion of 
the secondary school system to provide necessary tech- 
niclans for the new activities. As the country has been 
dependent upon cocoa production so far, a start was made 
to diversify agriculture by Introducing or encouraging 
crops such as coffee, bananas, and rubber. At the same 
time, attention was given to improvement of cocoa. A 
public corporation was given funds and the authority to 
develop industries in the country. Tax concessions were 
provided to Investors, factory buildings provided on rental 
basis for those who needed them, and financial and other 
assistance offered. Trade agreements were signed with 
countries like the United States. 
The foregoing gives an example of some of the attempts 
being made to create the conditions for industrialization

in West Africa. As a practical matter, local capltal can 
be gathered only slowly, mainly out of present agriculture 
and it will take a little while for the local entrepreneurs 
to acquire the necessary industrial know-how. Forelgn 
capital can help tide over this period of transition in the 
economy. But the flow has been slow. Most of the 
foreign Investment is locked up in quick-ylelding enter- 
prises like import and export trade. What is wanted 
really is the means to exploit local resources and train 
adequate personnel. The governments are therefore out 
of necessity forced to undertake some of the directly 
productive activities considered necessary for the growth 
of the economies. 
T oe Is no doubt that increased capital for- 
mation is urgently necessary for West African 
countries. But we do not want to lay too much stress 
on that factor alone. The existing capital could be put 
to a better use and even increased if the illiteracy rate 
were not so high. It is significant that the new state of 
Israel, located on a desert, should within a very short 
time have developed faster than the oil-rich Middle East 
countries. Not a small part of the explanation is that 
Israel had a high degree of literacy which enabled the 
country to train her work force and organize them 
quickly, free from the crippling inhibitions of tradition- 
oriented social structure and illiterate communities. 
In any case, in West Africa, with some 85% of the 
people illiterate, any scheme of major development is 
bound to press hard upon the already limited supply of 
educated people who are required as legislators, business- 
men, engineers and technicians. Fortunately, there have 
been enough of these people to assume the responsibilities 
of self-government without a breakdown occuring as has 
happened elsewhere. Ilowever, what constitutes an 
immediate bottleneck for many of these countries’ 
developments Is secondary school graduates for training 
in the technical and skilled operative level in agriculture 
and Industry. The problem can be tackled as has been 
done In Ghana by the allocation of more resources to 
secondary education than before. But It will take time 
for the teachers, especially In the sclentific flelds, to 
emerge. 
Of even greater importance is the problem of political 
stability and the establishment of law and order. Now 
that most of the countries have become independent, they 
are faced with the problems of transition. The new 
institutions have not yet established thelr full authority. 
The energies of the leaders are therefore concentrated on 
political problems of nation-bullding, leaving them little 
opportunity to give full attention to problems of economic 
and technical development. 
The bureaucracles trained in the old colonla!l school 
to regard their main function as maintenance of law 
and order are converting even more slowly to their 
new functlon of speeding up the economic develop- 
ment of thelr countries. However, {t Is noteworthy 
that the leaders as well as the people of West Africa are 
all anxious to transform thelr countries into modern 
nations. I belleve that thls enthusiasm for development 
which can be seen In the brisk and lvely cities of the 
western coast, is perhaps the most important factor which 
will help clear away some of the problems of developments 
in West Africa.

### 63319: Urban explosion in developing nations

URBAN EXPLOSION 
IN DEVELOPING NATIONS 
by Paul Mercier 
I: the majority of developing countries, the 
town (especially the large town) is an entirely 
new phenomenon which forced itself ruthlessly upon 
essentially peasant communities. These were village 
communities in ‘which economic and social relations 
developed between horizons that were often extremely 
narrow. In these villages blood relationships were 
broadly the basis of much of the social life, attachment 
to the soil was of religious or quasi-religious significance 
and respect for tradition slowed down the effects of 
forces of social and cultural change. 
The city thus offered an environment radically opposed 
to the traditional way of life. It Is significant that in 
various regions of Africa south of the Sahara, for instance, 
‘yisits to the city and a temporary stay have replaced to 
some extent the reputedly hazardous rites of initia- 
tion to which young men formerly had to submit before 
being admitted to a fully adult status in society. Contact 
with the city came to be considered as an experience par 
excellence of a foreign, difficult and hostile world, though 
one that none the less held many attractions. 
For nearly all the developing countries entry into the 
modern world has meant the creation of towns: adminis- 
trative centres In colonial territories, commercial centres 
everywhere and an at first limited number of industrial 
centres. 
Economists were the first to emphasize the importance 
of these links with the economically-developed nations, 
links established by these countries for their own needs— 
as centres of political and economic domination in 
directly colonized countries or simply for economic control 
in others. 
The limited integration of these towns with the regions 
they were intended to exploit rather than to serve was 
also noted. Even today this integration is only proceed- 
Ing at a slow place. A similar lack of harmony is also 
found on the social and cultural level, though it is also 
true that migration to the city has done much to spread 
its influence widely within a short time. 
At first the new towns were rather primitive, and they 
have still not outgrown this stage In many cases. Bulild- 
ing over the urban as whole ‘was sparse and somewhat 
haphazard. Residential sections looked more like over- 
grown villages or “encampments.” (Today many towns 
are still unable to provide sufficient housing for their 
inhabitants.) The creation of municipal administrative 
services was in its formative stages as also was the labour 
market. 
However, within the last few decades, and especially 
since the Second World War. many of these towns have 
diversified their activities and have reached a stage of 
partial consolidation. This process of diversification is 
extending today, especially in former colonial territories. 
The development of trade, industry and administration

and of political and educational activities is increasingly 
combined in many towns. 
The influence of the town as a centre for spreading 
standards, prototypes and new ways is now penetrating 
the rural areas more systematically. The development 
of transport and news and information media of all kinds 
helps appreciably to reduce the gap between town and 
country. Some plans for modernization and equipment 
show clearly the intention of making the towns and their 
resources the effective servants of the rural areas. 
Neveriheless, the stabilization of urban populations— 
essential for the creation of sound economic and social 
conditions—still creates difficult problems. 
Most new towns have heterogeneous populations, hete- 
rogeneous from regional, ethnic, linguistic and religious 
points of view. Thus they facilitate contacts and the 
mixing of different elements which Is especially important 
to countries striving to achieve unity. However, they are 
also the scene, for varying periods, of social tensions 
which sometimes turn into bitter conflicts between indi-

viduals, regional or ethnic groups or even between 
different castes. 
This situation arises all the more frequently because 
of the lack of arrangements to assimilate these people 
in urban areas. The individual or group has therefore been 
driven to congregate with others of similar origin so as to 
enjoy familiar social relationships. These could to some 
extent be continued in town and help to lessen the 
shock of starting an entirely new kind of life. At the 
same time, the formation of associations of this kind, 
all aiming basically at mutual aid, partly compensated for 
the loss of the traditional kinship groupings which had 
been the very basis for existence in the past, but which 
could only subsist with difficulty in urban surroundings. 
One of the malin reasons for the Intense migration to 
towns is rural over-population. However, this is not the 
only cause, and countries with a very low density of 
population offer equally spectacular examples of migra- 
tion. The factors which come into play here include

various kinds of social imbalance found in rural areas. 
economic regression due to special historical circumstances 
and direct and indirect constraints imposed in colonized 
countries to make sure of an abundant labour force, and 
even a manpower surplus which helped to support a low 
wages policy. 
Although migration concerns a large part (often the 
majority} of the adult male population, most migrants 
do not settle permanently in towns or have no intention 
of doing so. Industrial labour studies show that in the 
majority of developing countries the numbers of men 
actually employed are small, but that the labour force is 
continually being renewed. 
Industrial workers and town populations are basically of 
a shifting kind. Recruitment of workers for industry and 
urban Jobs has a “partial” character. The village re- 
mains their real “home” and even those who settle more

URBAN EXPLOSION (Cont'd) 
Replacing the shanty towns 
or less permanently in towns return to the village 
periodically to visit thelr relatives, to help with the 
harvest, to take part in ceremonies and so on. They do 
not evade the social and religious obligations imposed by 
the village. Studies in India and Africa revealed many 
facts of this kind. While there is thus no complete rup- 
ture between the town and rural populations the tem- 
porary town dwellers or those who remain largely allen 
to their new environment are nevertheless inadequately 
equipped to meet the social and economic demands of 
the town 
Migration to the town means a search for work—an 
often hopeless search, as many migrants discover. Most 
studies reveal a large proportion of unemployed and even 
more often, of non-employed persons. If the migrant 
does not immediately find employment, he stays in town 
knowing that he will always be able to subsist with the 
help of “relatives” he will find there. 
The man who finds a job is a privileged person; relatives 
often come to live at his expense and he usually complies 
with the ancient, still surviving rules of family solidarity. 
This phenomenon of “family parasitism,” found almost 
everywhere, is an obstacle to the raising of the standard 
of living of the worker and to any show of initiative by 
him. Yet at the same time it offers a spontaneous 
compensation for the effects of urban under-employment. 
Some economists have referred to the transfer of under- 
employment from country to town. We shall return later 
to the question of the lag that can be observed between 
the rate of growth or urban populations and the rate of 
increase in the number of jobs. Not all town dwellers 
without regular employment are entirely inactive, but the 
work they do is of an unproductive kind—everywhere 
there is an abundance of servants, petty traders, middle- 
men and people who live by doing odd jobs. The enormous 
increase in the section of the population which does not 
earn regular salaries reveals the extent of under-employ- 
ment in towns. 
In urban areas which are still poor in resources and 
where productive activity lags well behind the increase in 
population, the housing shortage is always acute. Every- 
where there are shapeless shanty towns. Even the man 
with a job often has no more than “a corner to sleep In,” 
and overcrowding is a general rule. 
VEN where vigorous efforts are made to meet 
this situation there is only a very gradual 
improvement. Intensive speculation in land, housing and 
rents has been reported in many towns. Anything (even 
the “corner to sleep in”) is let at an exhorbitant price. 
Rent eats up far too large a proportion of the budgets 
of the lowest income groups. This explains why seasonal 
migrants especially, but sometimes other categories of 
workers too, are ready to accept overcrowding and poor 
sanitary conditions or even to share accomodation with 
others on an “in rotation” basis. This situation, the 
result of rapid urban expansion, again reveals the limited 
degree of integration of the townsmen in their new 
environment. 
Having developed too quickly the town communities 
lack administrative structures and show signs of serious 
disequilibrium. Reports have referred to “formless masses 
of people.” This is an exaggeration, although the fact 
remains that the individual does lack the social structures 
which he needs to support and guide him. The groups 
to which he belongs are unable to give him all the help 
he needs in the difficult choices confronting him and in 
his efforts towards adjustment. 
Efforts are often made fo establish traditional types of 
groups but these can never be more than fragmentary and 
relatively ineffective. The basis of a new social structure 
is still far from flrmly established. The small family 
unit tends to replace the large family group, but this 
transition creates many problems because people are 
unprepared for the new kind of relationships which it 
involves between men and women, children and parents. 
The fragility of this social structure is only partially offset 
by the relations that are maintained with the large family 
groups in the villages from which the migrants came. 
We must also remember that many towns had and 
sometimes still do have very unbalanced demographic 
structures because of the surplus of men, particularly 
young men. This is explained by the nature of the mi- 
grations and has often lead to a widespread growth of 
prostitution, along with other social disorders. A Society 
in which traditional standards no longer apply or are 
misappligd, in which new rules have not yet taken shape 
or are not yet properly understood, is a favourable breed- 
ing ground for many kinds of disease. In some cases 
there has been an alarming increase in crime and delin- 
quency. 
It has been said that the incorporation of rural peoples 
into the industrial work force demands a real effort of 
“conversion” on their part. This is also true of every 
kind of non-traditional work offered by the town. The 
migrant who gets a job finds himself facing an entirely 
new situation which includes a salary system, payment in 
cash and the breaking down of work info individual tasks. 
The new conception of economic and social relations in 
work is instilled only with great difficulty. 
Along with the instability of the labour force one finds 
a lack of skill and low productivity due to a number of

physical, psychological and social factors. While the new 
townsman learns his job fairly easily, either by following 
a properly organized training course or “on the job” 
(which is usually the case), he has more difficulty in 
adapting himself to its context. His new work lacks the 
social and religious meaning of traditional occupations; 
it is specialized and he finds it hard to grasp the process 
as a whole. This, therefore, mitigates against the intro- 
duction of incentives to production. 
The worker, moreover, is not properly at home in an 
undertaking which is made up of heterogeneous working 
groups, sometimes managed by foreigners, and in which 
he often stays only a comparatively short time. The 
vocational training which many countries endeavour to 
develop must not only be vocational but must also com- 
prise an element of “cultural adaptation.” The efficacy 
of such measures depends largely upon the control of 
migration and by this fact is closely bound up with the 
whole process of development. 
Towns are favourable breeding grounds for new forms 
of soclal stratification. Soon it is possible to distinguish 
several more or less contrasting types of townsmen. Even 
where a class structure has not fully developed—in 
present or former colonial territories, for example—the 
main social groups emerge by reason of their length of 
residence in town, level of education, professional qualifica- 
tions, political activities, by their style of living (housing, 
food and recreational activities becoming status symbols) 
or by the ties maintained with traditional social forms 
and values. 
This stratification, combined with the creation of new 
notions of prestige, produces a social breakdown very 
different from that prevailing In the old communities. 
The nucleus of townspeople who are firmly established, 
who have permanent employment and the highest incomes 
and who have adopted to a large extent the non- 
STRAW IN THE WIND. Dilapidated shacks and straw huts contrast 
sharply with nearby neatness of new homes built at Katutu in the 
Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville). Housing is an urgent problem 
in Africa's burgeoning towns. Most have shapeless shanty towns and 
“encampments”, the homes of hordes of migrants from rural areas. 
  
traditional ways of life, fills the top ranks of this soclal 
structure. These are the people who play a decisive role 
In political life, not only in town, but In the country as 
a whole. The town, then, is the chief formative centre 
of these modern elites and this is an important element 
of its prestige and of its attraction for the rural popula- 
tions. 
The control of migration to towns (the prerequisite of 
equilibrium and general development) implies both an 
expansion of the industrial economy and a rapid improve- 
ment in the situation of the rural areas, irrespective of 
whether or not they suffer from overpopulation. 
T= difficulties inherent in agrarian reform 
have already been mentioned. It is signifi- 
cant that those who draw up development plans often 
include only modest provisions for Increasing agricultural 
production, as, for instance, in the case of Indla's first 
two natlonal plans. Many targets, desirable but too 
costly, have in fact eventually to be abandoned. Except 
in very limited spheres, educational measures can only be 
expected to produce long term results. Even some tech- 
nological enterprises which seemed not overambitious 
ended in failure because social changes which are part 
and parcel of such development were not taken suffi- 
ciently into account; this has happened in many reglons 
of Africa south of the Sahara. 
One good example of the difficulties inherent in 
the development of the rural economy is the mechanlza- 
tion, at least to a certain extent, of agriculture—one of 
the methods envisaged In many countries, as a way to 
increase agricultural production and in particular the 
production of foodstufls In short supply. 
Mechanlzatlon, of course, calls for considerable invest- 
ment. But foreign or international aid is mostly directed 
to other sections of the economy, state subsldies are 
usually small and the ability of the local farmers to 
save money or to invest is very limited or even non- 
existent. 
In the case of regions where highly profitable crops for 
export have been introduced, for example, when the 
revenue earned from agriculture cxceeds the amount 
required for immediate needs, the surplus is used primarily 
to buy luxury consumer goods or goes on traditional items 
of expenditure. This is true of many African reglons 
and the money amassed there is (economically speaking) 
more or less frozen. 
Even If mechanization was financlally feasible, it would 
still ralse many other problems. It often demands 
structural changes in the community; people must be 
trained to look after the new equipment, and peasant 
habits must be changed. In addition, mechanization In 
tropical countrles may cause still greater deterioration to 
already fragile soils. 
Theoretically, the simplest solution is to increase the 
area of cultivated land and to put to use virgin lands. 
It has been said that in the case of Africa south of the 
Sahara this kind of expansion would be possible and would 
demand only slight technological changes. 
In many regions of Africa, areas which had hitherto 
been uninhabited or only sparsely populated were turned 
to cultivation during the colonial period, though not with 
the alm of increasing the average agricultural production 
per inhabitant. This was done because the already 
cultivated lands were becoming exhausted and because 
new land was needed for bumper export crops which 
quickly impoverish the scil. Such use of virgin territories 
without the use of improved land care techniques and 
proper precautions resulted all too often in a squandering 
of frail soil. 
But the case of Africa Is by no means the most serious. 
In some parts of the world either it is impossible to 
increase the land under cultivation or such possibilities

Finding new jobs for migrants 
are very limited. Egypt's territories outside the Nile 
Valley cannot be used for agriculture and this is also true 
of most of the Amazon Basin in Brazil. Even in regions 
where there are virgin lands thelr exploitation in the 
near future will only be possible where cultivation would 
not entail prior (and too costly) development of com- 
munications, irrigation and so on. 
It will not be enough simply to throw these lands open 
for exploitation. The farmers who settle there will need 
to be led and educated—technically, economically and 
socially—and migration will have to be carefully con- 
trolled, otherwise the immediate benefits gained may well 
prove illusory. 
While it is often difficult to increase the area of land 
under cultivation, it is possible everywhere to improve 
methods of exploitation within limits which vary accord- 
ing to each individual case. The dangers of overambi- 
tious plans have already been stressed. It is the small- 
scale agricultural projects, costing comparatively little, 
which have proved effective in many cases and which have 
quickly produced an increased yield—by better use of land 
in terms of its particular qualities, by improved farming 
methods and by changes in the system of crop rotation. 
Larger scale measures which bring long term benefits 
are irrigation, soll preservation and the rehabilitation of 
worked-out land. These must be part of an overall plan. 
The importance of “a broad programme of small under- 
takings” has been stressed particularly in relation to 
irrigation. These individual efforts can be accomplished 
without recourse to large-scale investment and in the 
familiar setting of a village or group of villages. 
This, of course, does not exclude enterprises on a 
grander scale such as dam building when funds and labour 
are available. But such projects often involve major 
changes In social and agrarian structures and also in the 
way people are housed. And this in turn calls for a 
concerted programme affecting the entire rural com- 
munity. 
Soil conservation measures may Include the use of 
“green manure” (although this modern technique often 
meets with opposition from traditionalist farmers) or of 
chemical fertilizers, though these are expensive and their 
use in tropical countries needs further study. In the 
immediate future it looks as though in many cases action 
will have to be restricted to teaching farmers how to care 
for their soil. 
As regards long term measures, the restoration of 
exhausted lands for later use can often be achieved at 
low cost and with existing labour resources, by planting 
protective rows of trees and building low walls along 
slopes and so on. But efforts of this kind must be part 
of a future plan for the complete modernization of agri- 
culture and an intensive educational programme. 
Reference has already been made to the existence ot 
a surplus population in areas now in the throes of ur- 
banization and industrial development. This recent in- 
dustrial growth has been unable to absorb the enormous 
mass of migrants who have come to the towns in recent

decades. The increase in the number of jobs is never 
more than a feeble percentage as compared to the rise 
in the urban population: about 3% in India, 5% in 
Africa and 6% in Latin America. 
As the proportion of men of working age among the 
new town dwellers is very high, under-employment in the 
towns has actually increased. This problem is reflected 
in national development plans whose target figures for 
creating new fields of employment are enormous. The 
second Five Year Plan in India, for example, aimed at 
creating 15 million new jobs. 
‘But targets of this importance are hard to attain even 
when priority is given to the development of industries 
which need large labour forces. Industrialization moves 
at a slower pace than should be the case, not only because 
of the general shortage of investment capital, but for 
other reasons as well. The absorption of individuals and 
family groups into an industrialized economy does not 
necessarily give them a higher standard of living. 
Actually it is often difficult to make statistical com- 
parisons between the living standards of the wage- 
earning population and those of the rural peoples engaged 
in a subsistence economy. 
A worker with a regular job is regarded as a privileged 
individual and his commitments increase accordingly. 
Below a certain level of industrialization the income of 
the vast majority of wage earners provides only for a 
precarious existence and does very little to reduce the 
poverty of the rural populations. The level at which the 
situation would be reversed is seldom reached. 
Industrial development may be carried out in various 
ways depending on the particular conditions found in 
each country and upon the choices made by each govern- 
ment for economic and political reasons. 
In countries where population pressure is not an imme- 
diately urgent problem the only kind of industrialization 
   
  
that can be envisaged (except In a limited number of 
fields) is a long-term one, priority being given instead to 
the technological and social transformation of the rural 
economy. In the majority of cases, however, both poli- 
cies wili have to be pursued simultaneously. 
Industrial development aiming at the production of 
consumer goods is effective only in so far as the rural 
areas are capable of absorbing a substantial part of these 
goods. This in turn assumes that a number of conditions 
will be met. Agricultural production must rise above the 
ordinary level of subsistence In an ever-increasing number 
of regions. An adequate network of roads must be 
constructed. Distribution channels between producer and 
of industrially-produced goods on rural crafts must be 
borne in mind. 
Finally, efforts must be made to bring about changes 
In the needs and demands of consumers (often very differ- 
ent from those of people in highly industrialized coun- 
tries). This is a fundamental necd, economically, 
socially and culturally. Consumer demand is only partially 
linked with the circulation of money and is only partially 
aimed at the satisfaction of individual needs. 
But any educational effort in this direction will be 
meaningless unless it becomes part of a giobal attempt to 
Introduce changes in the traditional ways of life of these 
peoples. Thus we see once again how necessary it is to 
consider both industrial development and rural develop- 
ment as an inseparable whole and also to avoid approach- 
ing either the one or the other from a too strictly econo- 
mic point of view.

56 
HOMO SAPIENS 
THAT STRANGE PARADOX 
by Daniel Bovetf 
Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medecine 
W is science? What are we scientists trying 
to accomplish in the work we do in our 
laboratories and research? When we try to answer this 
question we come up against the two complementary 
aspects of the problem. On the one hand, science seen 
only as part of the development of rational thought and 
knowledge; on the other the contribution of science to 
economic and social advancement through the applica- 
tion of new techniques in industry, agriculture and 
communication. 
Even though the classical opposition between pure and 
applied sclence is today out of date, the purposes and 
consequences of science cannot be totally divorced from 
these two aspects. 
If the purpose of scientific knowledge is considered by 
some to be the enunciation of universal laws, to others it 
is nothing more than an instrument of practical action. 
Whereas Henri Poincaré affirmed that “thought is no 
more than a flash of light in the darkness of a long night 
but it is this flash that is everything,” Henri Bouasse, not 
without humour, supported the pragmatic attitude when 
he wrote “the scientist seeks a pattern into which the 
facts may be moulded, and science has but one justifica- 
tion for its extreme monotony: to serve an end.” 
When looked at in terms of economic development 
(where its results are most apparent) the answer to our 
question is relatively easy: the growth of new sources of 
energy, the advances made in telecommunications and 
methods of transport, automation In industry and fac- 
tories, the rise in the expectation of life and the almost 
total disappearance of infectious diseases are but a few 
of the hundreds of obvious examples of the progress 
achieved by the second industrial revolution. 
But this is not the most important consideration, and 
if we are not to overlook what is perhaps the crux of 
the problem we must recognize that the moral, soclal 
and even political revolution brought about by the recent 
development of science is as important as, if not more 
important than, the technological changes themselves. 
Today scientific research has become such an impor- 
tant element of modern society conducted and exploited 
almost on a par with mineral or land resources, that a 
real effort must now be made not to forget that this 
capital asset is really no more than the ideas, the culture, 
the creative genius—I am tempted to add the flight of 
fancy—of a few men. 
Thus if the stereotyped image of the scientist as a man 
in an ivory tower lost in incomprehensible experiments, 
little understood and the butt of many jokes, has not 
entirely disappeared, it is slowly dying and giving way 
to the modern notion of the “team of scientists” working 
in richly endowed institutes, forming a growing army of 
skilled Investigators at the service of important industrial 
and governmental bodies. 
One of the major results of the new policy of planning 
scientific research is the influence it will have, either 
consciously or not, on the ultimate equilibrium between 
the various branches of scientific research. 
In the nineteenth century the most audacious theories 
of science came from the field of biology and it was here 
that the greatest battles raged between old and new ideas. 
In our present century the most spectacular and most 
revolutionary discoveries have been made in the physical 
sciences—microphysics and our knowledge of the uni- 
verse. The scope of present-day discussions on both 
questions of theory and practice lead one to believe that 
the balance will continue to weigh heavily In favour of 
the physical sciences for some time to come. 
But when we consider the enormous problems facing 
the biologist and the crucial importance for all mankind 
of the ultimate solution to these problems it would seem 
preferable to have the scales of the balance tip once 
again in favour of the life sciences. 
I should like to recall at this point a hypothesis which 
I formulated some years ago concerning the history of 
the major trends in human thought. I called it “the 
hypothesis of the constant or invariability of grey 
matter”. This hypothesis is based exclusively on the 
experimental method. Thus, of 100 rats raised in my 
laboratory only ten (or fifteen at the most) are capable 
of being taught even a slightly complex operation. If I 
train them to climb on to a perch at a given signal it 
is unlikely that they will learn to open a door. If I teach 
them to push a lever in order to get a drop of sugared 
water they often forget their other skills. 
I have sometimes asked myself if this does not also 
apply to our own human society. 
We know that certain colleges and universities have 
found themselves depleted of staff because of the serious 
inroads made upon them by industrial laboratories. Can 
we imagine what would happen if an excessive demand 
for physicists suddenly deprived us of good biologists and 
doctors? Do we not have examples in history where cities 
have suffered from a lack of good statesmen because 
everyone wanted to be an artist, or ‘where the over- 
popularity of philosophy deprived a nation of leaders for 
its defence. This is a subject the reader might carefully 
ponder. 
I: is no longer enough to proclaim that no 
sphere of knowledge can henceforth remain 
unexplored; we must also recognize our degree of igno- 
rance regarding the many problems deeply affecting man 
himself. These embrace a broad field of subjects parti- 
cularly the vast domain of the basic sciences, molecular 
biology and biophysics, research Into intermediary meta- 
bolism and the science of nutrition, neurophysiology, the 
study of the information processes in the central nervous 
system, psychology and animal sociology in relation to the 
study of behaviour. 
Man’s noblest intellectual and cultural achievements 
have sprung from the human brain, the organ which 
controls our behaviour and thought and largely regulates 
our physical and mental well being. , The study of the 
brain should, therefore, it seems to me, occupy a promi- 
nent place in research programmes and be carried out 
as a co-operative scientific enterprise both on an inter- 
national and inter-disciplinary scale. 
As for the field of pharmacology, particularly familiar 
to me, I feel that the time is now ripe for a concerted

FROM MICE TO MEN. The behaviour of animals, of mice and rats in particular, has been 
widely studied by scientists. Biologists have gained valuable knowledge for the life sciences. 
attack on the problems of therapeutics and mental and 
social hygiene just as the research drives of recent years 
have led to Important breakthroughs that have van- 
quished disease and prolonged human life. 
We must work for the prevention and treatment of the 
degenerative diseases of the brain, mental deficiency and 
the physical disorders of old age. Certainly after 
conquering a horde of disease-bearing microbes, chemo- 
therapy is hardly less capable of attacking those more 
subtle spectres, our hallucinations and obsessions. 
Not long ago a biologist formulated the hope that 
science would produce a “formula to make men good.” 
I for my part believe that since man can never halt on 
the road of evolution he will be obliged in the future to 
resolve his own dilemma by choosing between the “Soma” 
of Huxley’s Brave New World which will plunge him into 
a state of stupid beatitude, and the pill which will make 
him more intelligent by developing his learning capacity 
and power of retention. 
Since I have espoused the cause of hiology I dare 
say I gladly support the seeming paradox which main- 
tains that it is through the study of animal behaviour 
that we should embark on the study of the human 
sciences. And I am convinced that biological research 
offers us the clearest road for understanding how the 
development of his own knowledge can in fact modify 
and enrich man’s vision of his own destiny. 
In human terms then what can we foresee as the result 
of this new “Operation Scientific Research”? 
In contrast to Jean-Jacques Rousseau who denounced 
the corruption of morals engendered by science, the 
Encyclopaedists saw in scientific progress the one great 
hope for mankind and the raison d’étre of all our endea- 
vours. In the centuries that followed, Rousseau won 
numerous new supporters as the world witnessed the 
extraordinary development of science and technology. 
And even today there are still those who point an accusing 
finger at science. The narrow intellectual sphere in 
which the scientist works is roundly denounced and cer- 
tain groups have even gone so far as to see in the machine 
and automation a “world conspiracy against all inner 
life,” accusing the scientist of depriving man of his 
“soul.” 
And yet the value of science In forming and developing 
the individual is evident to us every day as teachers. We 
see it in the drive, the enthusiasm, the perserverance as 
well as the will and spirit of abnegation of our students 
and colleagues; we see it in action among our fellow 
scientists In universities and research institutes; we sce it 
in the determination of so many of them to be an active 
part of the soclety they live in, convinced that their deep 
faith in a supreme truth will help to achieve a much 
broader ideal of human justice. As scientists we are filled 
with the feeling that we have received a parcel of the 
wonderful heritage bequeathed to us by our masters, and 
which, transcending those now living, continues to enrich 
us after four centuries of a long, prodigious tradition. 
Why is our age, which is barely over the threshold of 
immense new sources of energy, gripped by a sensation 
of helplessness bordering on despair? We are so disillu- 
sloned by the experience of two world wars and thelr long 
aftermaths; so obsessed once again by the feeling of 
insecurity and so deeply troubled as members of society, 
that It would seem our generation has lost the courage 
and the will to believe and work for peace. 
As men of science we must proclaim loudly not only 
that science is not solely responsible for all the evils of 
our day but that some of the greatest accomplishments 
of the post-war period have been brought about by 
science. 
Confident as I am in a new humanism, I believe that 
‘we can have no sober constructive vision of the future if 
it is not based on a rational approach to reality, recourse 
to science to solve the problems facing us, and the search 
for an ideology and technology worthy of man.

RLD OF THE FUTURE

Nobel Prize for Chemistry 
  
  
HAT will the world be like 20 or 40 years hence, 
at the close of the century? What levels, so 
far unimaginable, will science and technology attain by 
that time? And what fundamental changes will this 
have wrought in the world economy? In this age, when 
science is moving ahead with such amazing speed, it is 
impossible to predict new scientific discoveries. But we 
can foresee, with a certain degree of probability, the very 
considerable practical consequences of scientific trends 
that are already apparent. 
  
The 19th century is often described as the age of steam 
and electricity. How are we to describe the 20th cen- 
tury? As the age of nuclear energy, of the conquest of 
the air and of outer space, of plastics, of radio, television 
and electronics, or of cybernetics and electronic computers, 
of chemicalized and mechanized agriculture, of new 
medical compounds and longevity? 
Modern science is ceaselessly producing new and varied 
types of technique and new kinds of production. The 20th 
century Is characterized not only by the great increase in 
the volume of scientific knowledge but by the qualitative 
Soviet photo, SCR photo library. London 
change in the character of science Itself. 
Comprehension of the inner structure of matter, the 
attack on the inner regions of the atom, began in the first 
20 years of the 20th century and it was that which started 
this revolution in natural science. This understanding 
of the internal structure of matter has made it possible 
for us consciously to determine some of the characteristics 
of some materials. 
In chemistry this has led to a new method of synthesis, 
by which we can create new compounds and improve the 
technology of producing previously known substances. 
In physics it has led to a great number of new dis- 
coveries in the field of solid bodies, of which we shall men- 
tion only a few. They are the emission of electrons 
under the influence of heat and irradiation by light; the 
discovery of semiconductors with thelr astonishing 
electrical properties; the discovery of the phenomena of 
the transmission of energy in a solid body and, connected 
with it, the possibility of coherent radiation of a narrow

WORLD OF THE FUTURE (Cont'd) 
Brief encounter with 
beams of light and short radio-waves in the so-called 
lasers and masers. 
Ali this led to the creation of new techniques in very 
different forms. For example, the discovery of radio- 
waves, predicted by Maxwell and made by Herz in the 
19th century, has acquired very great technical signifi- 
cance only as the result of the application of the dis- 
coveries of physics in the 20th century. New flelds of 
selence and technology have appeared, such as radiotech- 
nology and electronics. 
Many wonderful discoveries were made as a result of the 
study of the atomic nucleus. When nuclei are being 
formed a tremendous amount of energy is liberated from 
the protons and neutrons as a result of the nuclear forces 
between them. According to the well-known equation 
formulated by Einstein on the equivalence between mass 
and energy, the energy liberated corresponds to the loss 
of mass. Depending on the content and the structure of 
a nucleus the concentration in the nucleus varies, as a 
result of which different nuclei have different losses of 
mass which can be measured. This loss of mass is called 
the mass defect. 
In nuclear reactions the less the mass defect of the 
initial elements, the greater the energy released. I feel 
confident that the day Is not far off when we shall be 
able to achieve a controlled thermonuclear reaction which 
promises quite unprecedented prospects for the develop- 
ment of world energy. 
Our galaxy consists of substances built of protons and 
neutrons in the nucleus, and electrons in the shell of an 
atom. However, there is a possibility that some other 
galaxies are made of anti-substances, of anti-protons and 
anti-neutrons in the nucleus and positrons in the shell 
of the atom. In these worlds anti-particles will be stable 
and our particles will be unstable. . 
It is noteworthy that all physical and chemical quali- 
ties of the atom will be identical in both worlds. In these 
other worlds we might find the same chemical combina- 
tions with the same structure and qualities and it is quite 
probable that living matter and even human beings simi- 
lar to those in this world may exist there. 
Imagine the meeting of a man and an anti-man some- 
where In space. They will be able to study each other 
and even become bosom friends, but they will not be able 
to touch each other. If they should try to do so, they 
would both explode with a power considerably greater 
than that of a thermonuclear bomb... 
HERE need be no doubt that coming decades 
will see a powerful upsurge in physics which, 
as Is always the case, will have as its “end” result very 
important technical achievements. In fact, I believe that 
two fundamental problems stand out in modern natural 
science. The first concerns the theory of elementary 
particles in physics, or, in other words, the problem of 
the primary particles of matter. The second, in contrast, 
concerns the structure and behaviour of highly organized 
matter in biology and chemistry. 
Animate matter is the most highly organized matter. 
The revolution which began in physics, and partly in 
chemistry, in the early years of the century, reached 
blology about half a century later, some 10 or 15 years 
ago. Working in concert with physicists and chemists, 
biologists began to penetrate the inner physical and 
chemical foundations of the amazing phenomena of life. 
In these fifteen years we have obtained highly interesting 
scientific results, and the pace of research is constantly 
60 being increased. 
Just as in the case of the study of atomic structure, 
these major scientific discoveries have not had, and prob- 
an ‘anti-man’ 
The very real dangers of air 
pollution resulting from indus- 
trialization are now being stud-

versal application of electric 
power in the future would

haps eliminate altogether—

ably will not for some time have, serious practical results. 
But it is beyond doubt that sooner or later they will lead 
to revolutionary changes in medicine and agriculture. For 
instance, I feel sure that the problem of cancer can be 
solved only by developing this trend in biology. And I am 
equally certain that research in the mechanism of physical 
and chemical processes in vital activity will likewise lead 
to a veritable revolution in chemistry. 
By applying the same principles to inanimate matter we 
should be able to create catalysts of unprecedented power 
and specific properties, notably for photochemical pro- 
cesses. We should also be able to design fundamentally 
new types of machines which, working like muscles, will 
directly and efficiently convert chemical energy into 
mechanical energy, etc. That is why I believe that the 
problem of highly organized matter is the second main 
problem in the decade ahead. 
It is very characteristic of modern science to make a 
profound investigation of the internal structure of matter 
and to produce on this basis new unprecedented techniques 
and new types of production. Research which now seems 
very abstract and of no practical application, such as the 
investigation of the properties of matter, sooner or later 
leads to revolutionary changes in industry. The more 
purely scientific the research appears, the greater the 
changes that result. The research that seemed most 
abstract of all turned out to be that which produced the 
greatest practical results—the discovery of atomic and 
thermonuclear energy. 
Here, I can only give a brief outline of the gigantic 
prospects opening up before mankind as a result of the 
further development of science and its practical applica- 
tion. 
Available sources of power, notably electric power and 
deposits of coal, oil, uranium, thorium, and water power 
resources will not last forever. They are gradually being 
exhausted, and though the reserves are great, they are 
neverthless limited. In addition, the mining of coal, 
uranium and thorium, even with maximum automation, 
will always involve strenuous working conditions. The 
question therefore arises of the new, more powerful and 
practically inexhaustible sources which could be developed 
with relative ease. 
At present there are three ways of solving this crucial 
scientific and technical problem: (1) by controlled thermo- 
nuclear reaction: (2) by the utilization of solar energy: 
and (3) by the utilization of the underground heat of 
the magmatic stratum below the earth’s crust.

Controlled thermonuclear reaction would open up 
altogether new and incomparable vistas for the human 
race. However, it seems that a continuously controlled 
thermonuclear reaction is practically impossible because 
it releases such tremendous heat and such high tempera- 
tures to sustain itself that the walls of the “thermo- 
nuclear furnace” would be Immediately vaporized. 
But physicists have suggested the principle of magnetic 
isolation, which reduces heat radiation through the walls 
and makes the process feasible in principle. By using 
a powerful current impulse they have succeeded in 
obtaining temperatures close to those required to start a 
thermonuclear reaction and test the principle of magnetic 
isolation. 
However, to start a self-sustained thermonuclear reac- 
tion we shall have to obtain considerably higher tempera- 
tures. There are aiso many other major difficulties, for 
instance, the problem of effective magnetic isolation in a 
continuous thermonuclear reaction. 
Controlled thermonuclear reaction has not yet been 
achieved. Undoubtedly its achievement calls for new 
ideas, new departures. It is hard to say when this 
cardinal problem will be solved, tomorrow or many years 
hence. But I believe that solved it will be, and within 
this century. For all the experience of modern science 
shows that what is possible in principle soon becomes 
possible in practice. 
Ver great prospects would be opened to 
mankind if we learned to transform solar 
energy into electric energy with a high efficiency 
standard. The sun sends to earth 4x10" calories per 
second. Most of this solar energy is diffused or absorbed 
by the atmosphere, particularly by clouds. An average of 
only 30 per cent reaches the earth’s surface in any given 
year—a little more in southern latitudes, a little less in 
northern latitudes. Yet even one-tenth of what reaches 
the land surface would suffice to generate thousands of 
times more power than we have today. This is the second 
major potential power purveyor, and one that will always 
be there and will never require mining or expenditure of 
fuel. 
In principle, 100 per cent of solar energy can be 
converted into electricity, but we are not likely ever to 
achleve this in practice. Ilowever, the progress in photo- 
electric and thermoelectric research should, within a few 
decades, cnable us to devise new photo- and thermo- 
elements and find special catalysts of photochemical 
processes. This, in turn, should make it possible to 
convert solar cnergy into electricity with an efficiency 
rate of 30 to 40 per cent. I am convinced that the 
problem of utilizing solar energy for power purposes can 
and will be solved before the end of the century. 
The third potential and practically inexhaustible source 
of energy is the underground heat of the magmatic strata 
of the earth, located about 30 kilometres below the surface 
and much nearer under the ocean bottom. The chief 
problem here is effective and economical technological 
methods of deep boring. Recent years have seen revolu- 
tionary changes In boring techniques, but many formida- 
ble technical problems have still to be solved before we 
can tap these underground heat depositories. 
Several countries are working on new methods of deep 
boring, and in some cases they are actually being applied. 
Given an abundant supply of low-cost electricity and 
Improved transmission techniques, we should be in a posl- 
tion to replace boring by the melting of rock and extrac- 
tion of the melted substance. 
A» so, In addition to coal, of], uranium and 
thortum, we have other, much more potent 
suppliers. of energy. If we put them to efficient use, all 
the power requirements of the world's growing population 
will be fully met, for these new sources are practically 
limitless. But they can be utilized only if there is a vigo- 
rous and concerted effort by scientists and technicians, 
and, needless to say, by all the peoples of the world. 
Thus, I feel sure that by the close of the century all 
three new sources of energy will have been put to work 
and the first thermonuclear, solar and underground 
generating plants will have been built. The 21st century 
will see the mass construction of such plants. That will 
bring electricity to every inhabitant of the world, In 
virtually limitless quantities. 
With a superabundance of electric power at its disposal, 
mankind could tackle and accomplish other, even more 
ambitious tasks. One example is the regulation of the 
earth's climate. Temperature and rain control could 
turn our planet into a flourishing garden. 
The auspiclous beginning of space travel poses another 
problem, one which today seems rather far-fetched. I 
refer to the possible role of thermonuclear energy in the 
exploration of Mars and other planets of the solar system. 
We know, of course, that Mars has an atmosphere but, in 
the first place, it is much more rarefled than the Earth's, 
and secondly—and more important—it contains a very 
small proportion of oxygen. Apparently there is water on 
Mars, but in relatively small quantities. The climate is 
colder than the Earth’s, and that would be an additional 
drawback. 
Let us consider whether or not it is realistic to create 
on Mars, within a relatively short period (say, a few 
decades) conditions that would support life. The first 
requirement for this i{s to obtain several hundred trillion 
tons of oxygen, to bring Mars’s oxygen content near to 
that of our own atmosphere. Oxygen can be produced 
from the water we shall find on Mars. Calculations show 
that if we build thermonuclear power plants on Mars 
capable of generating ten thousand times more clectricity 
than is now produced on Earth, and if thls energy is 
used for the electrolysis of water, then we should be able 
to accumulate the needed oxygen in a few decades. 
I do not know whether mankind will ever need to do 
that. It may well be that it will ind better employment 
for its superabundance of power. But I cite this example 
to indicate the majestic alms mankind can set itself once 
it has inexhaustible sources of energy.

WORLD OF THE FUTURE (Cont'd) 
Transistor network on the moon 
In discussing the practical problems involved in explor- 
Ing the solar system, I should llke to go a step further in 
my fantasy and examine opportunities for utilizing the 
moon to supply power to our planet. The moon is 16 
times smaller than the earth, but since it has no 
atmosphere It gets three times more solar radiation, per 
unlt of territory, than the earth. Consequently, in terms 
of solar energy absorption, the moon is equivalent to one- 
fifth of the earth's surface or, what amounts to the same 
thing, gets nearly as much energy as all our continents. 
Thus, if we were able to cover the moon with a network 
of high-efficiency transistor photo-elements, and if, in 
addition, we devised ways and means of transmitting this 
energy (say, via dlrected radio beams), then the moon 
would become a huge generating plant serving the earth. 
It might also become a sultable location for nuclear and 
thermonuclear power plants that could rid our earth of 
all radioactive contamination. 
Utillzation of thermonuclear and solar energy and of 
underground heat would naturally involve fundamental 
changes in industry, agriculture and what we sometimes 
describe as household service. Inorganic chemistry, 
metallurgy and the building materials industry would, in 
the main, use high-temperature reactions and arc dis- 
charges. There would also be a sharp increase in the use 
of electrolysis technlques. Super-high temperatures 
would be obtained either through arc electric furnaces 
or {rom thermonuclear reactor waste gas, heated to several 
thousand degrees. 
For example: nitrogenous fertilizers would be obtained 
chiefly from the air, through a synthesis of nitrogen 
oxides. All the elements of thie Mendeleyev Table could 
be produced either by electrolysis or by decomposition of 
ores, effected by high-temperature thermonuclear reactor 
waste gases. In facet, the very concept “ores” would 
change, for any combinations, notably those that have 
not been used hitherto because of their chemical inertis, 
could be employed as “ores.” 
  
On the other hand, utilization and enrichment of poor 
ores would be greatly simplified. Essentially, any soil 
treated by high-temperature techniques could become a 
building material. Universal application of electric power 
would lead to maximum automation in all lines of pro- 
duction and would drastically reduce—even perhaps 
eliminate altogether—the emission of harmful gases and 
dust into the atmosphere. 
There would, of course, be a great demand for polymers, 
and their production would be on a scale comparable to 
the production of metals. All deposits of natural gas, oil 
and some of coal would be used for this purpose and for 
obtaining a wide variety of organic substances. All that 
will be possible when electricity replaces gas, oil and coal. 
However, despite total electrification, there would still 
be automobiles, aircraft and rockets; they would still be 
using liquid and gaseous fuels; there would still be a need 
to produce substantial quantities of oil and gas. 
The problem can be solved by (1) producing synthetic 
fuel from inorganic raw materials. This can be done, for 
instance, by employing electric techniques fo obtain 
hydrazine from nitrogen and hydrogen; (2) by using 
carbon dioxide and hydrogen for an artificial synthesis 
of conventional fueis. 
Agriculture and the food industry would be electrified 
and automated throughout. When we have a supera- 
bundance of cheap electricity, the production of fertilizers, 
as I have already pointed out, will be greatly simplified 
and enlarged. Irrigation, too, would be expanded, by 
using plastic sheets to retain moisture, both under and 
over plants. 
Another development would be soil heating in northern 
areas and a vast expansion in hot-house cultivation. 
Combined, these methods would produce high harvests 
and, in many areas, two harvests annually. Lastly, 
electricity would be used on a very large scale to augment 
our fresh-water supply from seas and salt lakes.

Today's gigantic technological 
achievements often have as 
their basis the tiny electronic 
components in these photos.

amplifiers and detectors for 
which almost limitless uses have

There is no need to dwell on the fact that electricity 
adds to our comfort. I will, however, mention two 
beneficial developments: electric heating and alr 
conditioning in every home in every part of the world. 
Universal automation would reduce the working day to 
three or four hours, leaving many hours for sports, 
gardening, amateur theatricals, art, literature, civic duties, 
and for research in excellently equipped public labora- 
tories, which would become centres for bringing science 
to the people and ensuring its continuous development. 
That is how I visualize life in the 21st century: an 
age of total electrification. That 1s my vision of the 
heritage we can and should bequeath to our children, 
grandchildren and their children. 
The ideal of social progress can be approximately defined 
in the following way: the maximum happiness for the 
maximum number of people, for almost everybody. The 
first precondition for this is naturally the full satisfaction 
of the material and cultural needs of every man on earth. 
Hawever, the satisfaction of material needs alone is not 
enough far a happy life, though it is, of course, the main 
and necessary precondition for the full spiritual activity 
of man. But by his nature man is also a creator of 
material and spiritual values. The need of creative 
activity is not only one of the noblest but also one of the 
 
most Important fundamental and Ineradicable needs of 
homo sapiens. So our greatest task Is to bring varied 
creative activities within the reach of the mass of the 
people. 
Some people may not agree with my understanding of 
happiness; they regard happiness not as a creative but 
as a passive thing. Others regard happiness as a turbu- 
lent thing arising out of work or leisure. But I personally 
believe that such views of happiness are due to spiritual 
poverty or to the lack of the social conditions necessary 
for the discovery and development of the creative talents 
which exist potentially In every normal man. 
In a word, to demonstrate his creative ability and to get 
pleasure from doing so, every man must have a certain 
level of knowledge, of mental and emotional development, 
of =sthetic taste, and a moral attitude towards soclety 
and himself. This can be achieved if such economic and 
social conditions are created as to ensure an all-round 
development of people and thelr creative labour.

### 63332: Scientists abroad

SCIENTISTS ABROAD 
by Alan J. A. Elliott 
A: one third of all fellowships and scholar- 
ships offered for study abroad are awarded in 
the fields of science and technology. This has been 
revealed by successive analyses of the offers listed in 
Study Abroad, UNEScO’s International handbook on 
fellowships, scholarships and educational exchange. 
The thirteenth edition of Study Abroad, which gave 
information on awards available in 1962 and 1963, listed 
over 130,000 individual opportunities. Of these about 
10% were for the study of mathematics and natural 
science. And about 20% were for the study of applied 
sclences and technology, Including engineering, medicine 
and agriculture. For the sake of comparison, about 14% 
of awards were offered in the social sciences, and nearly 
167% in humanities, liberal arts, linguistics, literature and 
history. 
This means that at least 40,000 scientists and techno- 
logists received awards for study abroad during the aca- 
demic year 1962 alone. In practice the figure may be 
considerably higher, because 25-30% of the offers made in 
Study Abroad do not specify a field of study. Although 
the actual allocation of awards is not known with any 
great accuracy it would be safe to say that at least a 
quarter of these awards, amounting to about 10,000 were 
also made to scientists. 
Actual examples of fellowship programmes listed 
in Study Abroad are extremely varied. They include 
the programmes of the Food and Agriculture Organiza- 
tion, Unesco, the World Health Organization, and other 
organizations of the United Nations system. There are 
also the programmes of other intergovernmental organiza- 
tlons such as the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research and the International Computation Centre. 
Non-governmental organizations—such as the Inter- 
national Union against Cancer and the International 
Astronomical Union—contribute their share. Among the 
national chapters some very important programmes are 
listed, for example those of the French Centre National 
de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), the United Kingdom 
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), 
the United States National Research Council and the 
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. 
0: the other end of the scale there are many 
progran:mes of limited size and more 
specialized aims. For instance, Rutgers University, New 
Jersey (USA), gives one fellowship a year to a young 
Italian microbiologist. The A.F. Regnell Botanical Dona- 
tion permits the Swedish Royal Academy of Science to 
award, at Irregular intervals, fellowships to Swedes for 
study of botany in Brazil or other “intertropical 
countries.” 
In between these two extremes are a large number of 
programmes—involving many thousands of individual 
awards—directed in general towards the promotion of 
economic development. Most of these programmes are 
government-sponsored, accounting for about 50% of all 
fellowships offered. 
It is not always easy, though, to identify the proportion 
devoted to science and technology. The Government of 
India offers four “Union Territorles Overseas Scholar- 
ships” for “any branch of science, engineering, technology 
or medicine.” But the Government of Libya offers 258 
State Scholarships for study of “teacher training, agrl- 
culture, engineering and other fields” in Europe, the U.S.A. 
and the United Arab Republic. And among countries 
offering technical assistance, the U.S. Government, In one 
of Its many programmes, makes approximately 1,900 
awards for which the subject of study Is “generally 
unrestricted” to “nationals of most countries having 
United States diplomatic or consular posts.” It Is 
reasonably certain, however, that a high proportion of 
such awards is made in science or technology. 
The fellowship programmes of the U.S 8.R. on the other 
hand, although fewer in number, make more specliic 
mention of “science, agriculture and medicine” as tields 
of study. 
Wi attention is turned to the number 
of scientists studying abroad. regardless of 
whether or not they are recelving fellowships, It is found 
once agaln that they represent a large proportion of all 
forelgn students. UNEsco’s tenth annual survey of forelgn 
students enrolled in higher education showed a total, In 
all fields, of over 250,000 In the academic year 1960-1961. 
In a very general way, the overall situation can be viewed 
from two main viewpoints. One is the tradition that 
science, and for that matter all academic learning and 
research, cannot be restricted to any one nation, and that 
as long as there have been universities, students and 
teachers have gone abroad to follow thelr vocations. 
The other—of much more recent orlgin—concerns the 
great need for training sclentists and technologists from 
countries undergolng rapid economic development. This 
second part of the problem Is by far the more urgent 
for practical, present-day purposes; but as It cannol be 
seen in entire isolation a word needs to be sald about the 
more general problem of sclentific exchanges. 
In a sense, the phenomenon of seientists studying abroad 
1s only part of the broader problem of the International 
exchange of scientific information. While it would be 
wrong to infer that all sclentists who go abroad do so for 
purely professional purposes—there is probably as high a 
proportion of *educational tourlsts” among scientists as 
In any other dlscipline--it can be assumed that most of 
them are prompted by the need to acquire knowledge and 
experience that they cannot obtain at home. 
It may be that institutions for sclentific study do not 
even exist in thelr own countries; or perhaps they have 
been unable to obtaln places in sultable institutions. With 
respect to the more specialized branches of post-graduate 
study or research, a student may feel the need to work 
with a particular teacher abroad. Very few countries 
are entirely self-sufficient in facllities for scientific re- 
search. And even those that are, or nearly so, have a 
strong traditlon of exchanging knowledge ‘with workers in 
the same fields abroad. 
But study abroad Is not the only way of exchanging 
scientific information. From some points of view it is a 
very Ineffective way. For the problem nowadays is not 
so much one of encouraging sclentists to meet each other, 
but of providing them with a means of access to the very 
large quantities of articles and papers on a enormous 
range of subjects appearing in the sclentific journals of 
the world.

### 63332: Scientists abroad

SCIENTISTS ABROAD (Cont'd) 
90,000 science fellowships a year 
Fellowships for study abroad are by no means 
the only way of promoting personal contacts. An 
increasingly important phenomenon is the large number 
of congresses, conferences and meetings that take place 
every year. The facilities of air travel, and the financial 
support of governments and industrial concerns, has made 
it possible for larger numbers of scientists than ever 
before to meet each other. At least half a million go 
abroad every year for such purposes. 
This, then, is the general background of international 
scientific relations against which the problems of study 
abroad must be seen. But when one turns to the particu- 
lar problems which face countries in the process of rapid 
enonomlic development a completely new set of factors 
has to be taken into account. In the past—and even 
today—some of the greatest scientific developments have 
been achieved without a very clear definition of goals. In 
fact, the research scientist often produces his best results 
through being allowed a maximum freedom of action. 
Nowadays the drive towards economic and social 
development demands a very careful statement of 
objectives. This tendency affects the whole world, but 
it is particularly drastic in countries which can least afford 
the luxury of wasted effort. 
In two-thirds of the countries of the world, in which 
many mllllons live on the borderlines of undernourish- 
ment, there is the greatest need for economy of effort 
and the careful development of human resources. Qffers 
of outside assistance are not lacking, but programmes of 
technical co-operation cannot achieve the results expected 
of them unless they are carefully planned and co- 
ordinated. The development of science and technology 
is obviously one of the first and foremost needs. 
But inevitably projects in the fields must find themselves 
in competition with other types of projects. Moreover, 
scientific personnel must be of high intelligence and 
ability. So there is competition for human resources just 
when the most desirable prizes may seem to lie in politics 
or diplomacy rather than in further academic study. 
Further than that, there is competition between basic 
sciences on one hand and technology on the other. If 
there are not enough scientists it simply means that not 
much research will be done. If there are not enough 
technologists there will be no factories or railways. And 
beyond that there is competition between the different 
sclences and different technologies. And so on. 
  
Wi: does study abroad fit into this picture? 
The answer to this is complicated by the fact 
that whatever its role may have been in the past there 
must now be a careful assessment of plans for the future. 
Two major considerations must be taken into account. 
The first is derived from the well-known situation in 
which exceptionally large numbers of science students 
who go abroad never return home. And of those that 
do there is much dissatisfaction owing to inability to find 
employment sultable to the experience acquired abroad. 
The second consideration depends on an assessment of 
where the most serious obstacles to scientific development 
lie. For the present and immediate future some of the 
most serious problems lie in general education at the 
primary and secondary levels, rather than in the specific 
training of scientists, But in many countries the heart 
of the problem can be pinpointed as lying in science 
teaching in secondary schoois. And this is not a problem 
which can be solved by massive programmes for study 
abroad by scientists. 
It is clear that in future there must be a careful selec- 
tion—in fact, rather more careful than has hitherto been 
the case—of objectives to which funds will be devoted for 
study abroad. This must begin with an assessment of 
the number of qualified scientists who can be produced 
by domestic training institutions, and decisions as to how 
these institutions ‘will be developed or supplemented in 
e future. 
To a great extent plans for study abroad must be 
designed to fill the gaps. Some countries may still have 
to send relatively large numbers of science students abroad 
for university degrees, simply because of a present lack 
of university places. Others may be able to pinpoint their 
needs to a few specialized post-graduate subjects in which 
they do not possess—and in which they may probably not 
find it worthwhile to possess—fully developed research 
facilities. But above all, the scientist must be assured 
of worthwhile and remunerative work on his return. 
Wherever possible, fellowships for study abroad in 
scientific or technological fields should be planned so as 
to achieve very much more effective results than at 
present. It is ‘worth noting that in Unesco’s fellowship 
programmes, in which science is given a very high priority, 
only about one-quarter of the thousand or so awards made 
each year are in scientific subjects per se. A high propor- 
tion of Unesco fellowships as a whole are for the develop- 
ment of general education. 
A MONG the sclence fellowships awarded by 
UNEsco there are many examples of the ways 
in which study programmes are carefully elaborated in 
relation to clearly-defined needs. One of its programmes, 
which is operated in collaboration with the International 
Brain Research Organization, provides for about 30 
fellowships through which interdisciplinary studies 
concerning the brain can be promoted. Fellows may 
specialize in neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, neurophar- 
macology or other relevant fields. Plans are being made 
for a fellow from Japan, for example, who has already 
been studying at the University of California, to do re- 
search on the topic of “Brain Mapping in Birds” at the 
University of Tiibingen. 
Another type of fellowship can be found in connexion 
with projects under the United Nations Special Fund. 
Whereas the brain research fellowships are intended to 
promote research at a very advanced level, Special Fund 
fellowships are designed to give the necessary qualifica- 
tions to scientists or technologists who will be employed 
on clearly-defined projects after their return home. Five 
fellowships of this type, for mathematical study and 
hydraulic engineering, are being awarded, for example, to 
candidates from Vietnam and Cambodia in connexion 
with preliminary studies for the gigantic project of 
controlling the Mekong River, which flows through. 
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, by a series of dams 
and barrages. 
A different example of a Special Fund project can be 
found in the Japanese International Institute of Seismo- 
logy and Earthquake Engineering. Fellowships for atten- 
dance at the Institute by candidates from seismic zones 
elsewhere in the world are awarded by both the Govern- 
ment of Japan and by UNEsco. 
But an important part of this broader picture is the 
increasing realization that the application of science and 
technology for the purposes of economic development is 
not a one-way process in which the more highly indus- 
trialized nations transmit their knowledge and experience 
to those less advanced. The real key to the problem lies 
in the creation of institutions in less developed countries 
‘which can absorb and utilize experience gained elsewhere. 
Once these institutions have begun to take root they 
are often in a position to contribute to development 
outside their own frontiers. In scientific matters, as 
much as any others, much of the success of this process 
must depend on the sympathetic relationships which can 
be established between institutions in different countries. 
As often as not these relationships are of a non-govern- 
mental or private nature. 
There are many examples of fruitful results from the 
“palring” or twinning of universities. The personal 
contacts established through study abroad on this basis 
can have far more meaning than when such a system 
does not exist. In this and similar ways there lie the 
greatest possibilities of not only assisting developing 
countries in their more urgent needs, but also of bringing 
them, to the advantage of all, to the status of full 
participants in the worldwide scientific community.

A UNIQUE SURVEY OF WORLD 
by Pierre Auger 
A book which is not only the first of its kind, 
but likely to be one of the most important basic 
scientific works of the coming decade. It will 
be of exceptional interest to science research 
institutions, universities, government science 
officers, science teachers and industry—in fact, 
to all who are interested in the history and deve- 
lopment of scientific research. 
Twenty-nine intergovernmental organizations, 
66 international non-governmental organizations, 
the national research organizations of 42 coun- 
tries and 255 scientific experts have collaborated 
to produce this book under the direction of Pro- 
fessor Pierre Auger, a leading physicist and the 
former head of Unesco's Department of Natural 
Sciences.
