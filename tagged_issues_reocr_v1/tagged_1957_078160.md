particles of matter some of which 
make up the nucleus of the atom, 
and on the other hand the galaxies 
and galactic systems. Photo right

James Thornton, a blind American

i» Imogen Cunningham 
or many millenia, man’s knowledge of the external 
F world was limited to what he could detect with his 
senses. Living in a purely natural environment, he 
found his place therein, like the other animal species. 
Man's senses, however, are not always better than those 
of animals: certain insects can see ultraviolet light; the 
bat can hear ultrasonic vibrations, dogs have a more 
highly developed sense of smell. So it is not because he 
has a sensory system superior to those of animals which 
has enabled man to conquer a privileged place for himself 
in nature. It is his ability to reflect upon the plain evi- 
dence of his senses, to analyse it, to compare various pieces 
of information with one another, and to interpret the 
result with his mind. 
Among our senses, those which enable us to appreciate 
the arrangement in space of all the objects of the world 
around us, give us more valuable information than do the 
others. Thanks to this idea of arrangement in space we 
can attribute larger or smaller dimensions to objects. 
Many animals of course possess the idea of space and 
have some knowledge of the sizes and distances away of 
various other animals, plants and objects in their environ- 
ment. But this knowledge is confused and cannot be 
raised to the status of a science because the animals have 
no idea of measuring lengths or distances by a voluntary 
experimental act. 
There are many species of animals which can count, 
but there is not a single one which has the faculty to 
measure. Thus even in the fleld of medium distances (such 
as the size of his own body, distances between himself 
and other objects) man has, since remotest antiquity, 
had a great superiority over animals in his ability to 
measure, 
But it is only in the past few hundred years, with the 
invention of the microscope and telescope and other ins- 
truments of measurement, that man has made his most 
prodigious bound forward. Today, the electron microscope 
permits us to see details one hundred times smaller than 
ever before. In bacteriology it has provided valuable 
information about the structure of viruses and bacteria; 
in metallography it has made possible extensive study of 
metallic surfaces and crystals. The 200-inch Mt. Palomar 
telescope, on thé other hand, has extended man’s vision 
of the universe up to 720 million light years—the distance 
of the furthest galactic cluster yet observed. 
During this pursuit of fresh knowledge, into the regions 
of both the extremely small and extremely large, man has 
not only encountered unknown and marvellous phenomena 
which have enriched his conception of the universe, but 
has also been able to transform his own existence by 
entirely new means developed in the process.

One day while 
their parents were away hunting, the children decided to go off into the bush by themselves. When night came they were lost, but 
with the resourcefulness of aboriginal children they found food and water and built themselves a shelter for the night. Next day 
their parents set out to look for them and the family was soon reunited. Here is their adventure—a bedtime story told to aboriginal 
children around the campfire, but one that really happened—now recounted by a photographer. 
where an inexperienced white man 
would perish in a few days. 
The lessons are driven home in a 
practical way when the children go 
“walkabout” (long trips across 
country) with their parents. On 
these walkabouts the children are 
taught all the skills necessary for a 
life in the bush: how to find food 
and water, how to hunt and fish, how 
to build a bark canoe, how to weave 
a basket and make a spear. Younger 
children go food gathering with the 
womenfolk who teach them how to 
track animals and to read the signs 
of the bush. Sometimes, as in the 
photo story on these pages, the chil- 
dren decide to take off on a minor 
walkabout of their own. 
The boy in the story, Nullagundi, 
is tall for his ten years. He has 
already learned most of these things 
and soon he will undergo the initia- 
tion rites which will make him a 
man. As soon as these ceremonies 
begin life becomes very different for 
a boy. He may no longer speak to 
his sister or many other women who 
are closeley related to him. Taboos 
are imposed on him. There are foods 
he may not eat and his whole beha- 
viour is strictly controlled. His nine 
year-old sister Rikili, on the other 
hand, just goes on growing up. Rikili 
has already been promised in mar- 
riage and she will be claimed by her 
husband as soon as she is old enough. 
The aborigines of Arnhem Land are 
among those peoples whose lives and 
cultures have remained the most 
primitive, the closest to those of 
their far-off ancestors. These bush- 
men, as they are called, depend solely 
for their living on hunting, fishing 
(where possible) and food gathering. 
Until 1788 aborigines had been 
occupying the entire continent of 
Australia undisturbed for many cen- 
turies. They are thought to have 
numbered some 300,000 at the time of 
the first white settlement in Austra- 
lia. Today there are some 60,000 full- 
blood aborigines and about 25,000 of 
mixed blood. They are mostly 
nomads found in tribes scattered over 
the Northern Territory, the north of 
Western Australia and northern 
Queensland. Many roam vast reser- 
vations, Others, no longer tribal, live 
in organized camps where medical 
services and schools are provided by 
the Australian Government. Others - 
live in normal contact with the white 
man and work at various trades. 
Aborigines have contributed in no 
small measure towards Australian 
life. Pastoral industries could not 
have developed without their help. 
One of the most remarkable aspects 
of the aboriginal is his art, a truly 
primitive and still living art. Unesco 
cevoted an album in its World Art 
Series, “Aboriginal Paintings-Arnhem 
Land” to this art on bark and stone. 
(See THE UNESCO COURIER, N° 11, 1954). 
Today the Australian aborigines are 
not only diminishing in numbers but 
are also losing their primitive beliefs 
and customs because of their greater 
contacts with Western civilization.

'LET'S HAVE A 
SPEAR FIGHT’ 
Nullagundi and Rikili met their 
friends on the beach and decided to 
play the “spearfight” game. The 
boys tied soft bark round the 
points of their spears, and as they 
threw them at each other, the 
girls stood between them as “peace- 
makers” and tried to deflect 
the flying spears. (The aboriginals 
use spears for hunting and at the 
peace-making ceremonies which 
often precede the corroborees, or 
big feasts). The game ended as 
one of the boys pretended to be 
killed, and the girls wept over him.

WHAT ABOUT 
A WALK? 
Rikili got tired of playing games 
and suggested a walk in the forest. 
The two children sneaked off into 
the bush, taking care that their 
grandmother didn't see them. 
Soon Rikili was thirsty, but all 
the water holes were dried up so 
Nullagundi “tapped” a paperbark 
tree. He cut into the tree with 
his spear and soon water was 
dripping into the bark ‘cup they 
had made. It tasted slightly brack- 
ish, but they were too thirsty to 
notice. (When these photographs 
were taken there had been no rain 
for a good two years and water 
was very hard to find anywhere).

Goanna (lizard) meat is an abori-

dart into rocks or hollow logs the 
moment they hear humans around. 
‘By pulling hard on the goanna’s 
tail Nullagundi drew it from its 
hiding place and quickly killed it. 
Rikili proudly held the trophy of 
the chase. Rubbing two sticks to-

brother made a fire with dried 
grass and branches. The goanna 
was soon cocked and in no time 
the children had gobbled it down.

STORY WITH A 
HAPPY ENDING 
When the mother and father return- 
ed from their hunt they were very 
worried by the two children’s dis- 
appearance. Early next morning they 
set out in search of them and soon 
found the trail the children had made 
—sometimes a footprint, sometimes a 
broken branch or grasses bent back. 
From time to time they stopped to 
call out... and finally Nullagundi heard 
them, That evening a big corroboree 
was held in the camp to celebrate the 
children’s return. The story had a 
happy ending and the children’s 
“walkabout” taught them still another 
lesson about aboriginal skills and lore.

captivity, although not always for the same 
reasons. Animals have been kept as objects of 
curiosity, wonder and amusement as well as for 
observation and profitable study. At various times 
they have been used for thrills in sport and specta- 
cles. 
Today, apart from travelling menageries and the 
captive performing animals of the circus, all the older 
forms of the practice have been superseded by 
zoological gardens—a comparatively recent develop- 
ment. The one thing that has not changed is the 
curiosity excited by the spectacle of wild creatures in 
captivity which is as strong today as ever before. 
Nowadays, however, the aspect of sensationalism has 
been more usefully turned in an educational direction, 
as exemplified by the zoological garden, or the “zoo” 
as people have been calling it for the past century. 
As far as we can tell the very earliest zoo existed in 
the advanced civilization of Ancient China. There 
the first emperor of the famous Chou dynasty founded 
a collection of animals about 1100 B.C. We have no 
record of what creatures it contained, but <rom its 
title, “a park of intelligence”, we gather that its 
objects were obviously educational and scientific and 
probably corresponded to those of modern zoos. This 
is all the more remarkable because at that time very 
often the only reason for keeping animals was for 
their religious associations which gave them elevated 
rank among the denizens of the earth. 
This was an attitude widely prevalent in Egypt, 
where the cat was reverenced as also were calves, 
baboons, crocodiles and many other creatures regarded 
as animal deities. 
Ancient Egyptian drawings and designs abound in 
animals and birds. But the Egyptian practice was 
one of pet-keeping rather than the assembling of 
caged collections—a pet-keeping carried to excess. 
Many of these creatures lacked for nothing and had 
picked slaves to look after them. From the many 
mummified remains discovered in tombs we know 
that after their death such animals were buried with 
ceremony and ritual. 
The peoples of Ancient Greece and Rome were well 
accustomed to seeing a variety of wild animals, but 
these were nearly always brought to Europe and 
maintained with care solely for the role they were to 
play in the arenas, to be slaughtered either by other 
beasts or in combat with gladiators. Thus, the people 
of Rome saw camels, elephants, leopards, lions, 
antelopes, rhinoceroses, crocodiles, hippopotamuses 
and ostriches, and even the giraffe, which was after- 
wards not to be seen again in Europe until 1827. 
S INce early times men have kept wild animals in 
  
‘CT Paul Almasy 1957 
The Roman Emperors could always maintain large 
collections of wild beasts. As these animals existed 
in far greater numbers than they do today, there was 
little difficulty in restocking the collections after the 
bloody combats attended by thousands of citizens. 
Vast quarters were built for the beasts within the 
precincts of the Coliseum, often only a few yards from 
the prisons oi the ‘Christians and others who had 
incurred disfavour. These hapless victims were 
thrown to the lions regularly, the beasts having been 
kept hungry to ensure lively “sport”. Fights between 
gladiators and lions were a favourite spectacle; we 
read of Commodus who slew more than a hundred 
lions in as many single struggles. Sometimes certain 
animals—leopards, lions and tigers—apparently tame 
and pampered with food and attention, wandered 
freely amid the palaces and garders. It is said that 
Nero had a pet tigress called Phoebe which sat with 
him at banquets and was occasionally used to rid the 
court of unwanted guests or those who displeased the 
Emperor. It is also recorded that Heliogabalus 
entered Rome in a chariot drawn by four panthers 
and four tigers later set loose in the palace. 
Thus throughout the Roman era animals provided 
entertainment for people and nokles alike. Towards 
the Middle Ages, however, arimal collecticns were to 
be found only in the entourage of feudal potentates, 
princes, dukes and barons, for they alone could afford 
to maintain the animals in proper quarters. The 
keeping of animals was often a form of hobby among 
the rich from whose collections our own zoos of today 
directly derive. 
Throughout Europe the rare visit of some cheap 
travell:ng menagerie of the lowest form, or perhaps 
some unusual pet, a .showman’s monkey or a 
performing bear, were the only chances the average 
poor person had of seeing wild creatures from 
different lands. The pandering to empty sen- 
sationalism only began to disappear when the 
ccllections of the privileged grew both in numbers 
and in scientific status, and were thrown open to the 
public Zor its edification and amusement, 
Kings had the most extensive collections for they 
were often presented with live captive arimals ty 
rulers of other lands, explorers and the captains of 
ships visiting sirange parts. The first zoo in England 
seems to have been founded by Henry I at Woodstock 
early in the 12th century. It included lions and 
leopards. This collection was later trarsferred to the 
Tower of London where it formed the basis of the 
famous menagerie which in its turn was to be the 
original nucleus of the present Regent's Park.

ZOOS (Continued) 
    
This transfer of the first English collection to the 
Tower of London, where there was ample room and 
safe accommodation for the increasirg numbers of 
wild animals being presented by foreign rulers, took 
place in the reign of Henry III, in the early thirteenth 
century. The collection was presided’ over by an 
official of the Crown and it seems the Sheriffs of the 
City of London and of the counties of Bedford and 
Buckingham were ordered to finance the complete 
menagerie, including the keepers. Henry III added 
an elephant and a white bear to his collection, as well 
as three leopards—symbolizing those on the royal 
coat of arms—which he had received from the Em- 
peror Frederick as a token of friendship. In 1252 it 
is recorded that the sheriffs of London were ordered 
to pay fourpence a day for the maintenance of the 
white bear and its keeper. A year later it was deemed 
advisable to provide a muzzle and a chain for this 
animal while it was washing or fishing in the Thames! 
The menagerie at the Tower grew throughout the 
reigns of the next three sovereigns, and orders still 
preserved show that sixpence a day was the usual 
allowance for each leopard or lion, with three-half- 
pence as the keeper’s wages. 
We know very little of the actual conditions under 
which these collections were housed, but they do not 
appear to have been at all bad; and the animals 
thrived as a rule. By the time of Henry VI the 
menagerie had risen in official status, for the keeper 
of the lions was a rank held by a gentleman of the 
court, with a fee of sixpence a day and as much again 
for the maintenance of every lion or leopard in his 
charge. It is obvious that the royal menagerie was 
held in high esteem, for the corresponding allowance 
for human prisoners in the Tower was a penny a day. 
  
  
  
  
                             
The keeper of the lions: a court gentleman 
Henry III's elephant was a gift from the King of 
France about the year 1255. It was the first live 
elephant to be seen in England and accordingly 
attracted vast crowds of sightseers on its arrival. A 
document still extant describes how the Sheriff oi. 
Kent was ordered to proceed to Dover in person in 
order to see how the animal might most conveniently 
be brought to London, and if necessary to arrange for 
a ship to convey it in. Shortly afterwards the 
Sheriffs of London were commanded to erect with 
all speed, in the Tower, an elephant’s house, forty feet 
in length and twenty feet wide, strongly built, but 
adaptable to other uses should the need arise. This 
prudent touch is typical of the age when the keeping 
of wild animals was still very much a novelty. 
Similar collections were being built up in Europe. 
In France, Phillip VI had a fine collection by 1333, 
and Charles V maintained menageries at Couflans, 
and at the Tournelles in Paris. Later, Louis XI 
formed a zoo at Plessis-les-Tours in Touraine and 
after his death this was re-established at the Louvre 
in Paris and enlarged with a number of animals 
brought specially from North Africa. This establish- 
ment was done away with by Henry III but in due 
course a collection was built up again, first by 
Henry IV, then by Louis XIII at Versailles where the 
famous Menagerie du Parc was ultimately founded by 
Louis XIV. This collection was quite a good one and 
received many different species from Cairo. It was 
kept in order for more than a century, affording 
much scope for naturalists ard anatomists until its 
eventual decay and final destruction during the 
Revolution in 1789. 
In Germany, the Elector Augustus I started a zoo 
at Dresden in 1554; one of the lion keepers was killed 
there by a particularly savage beast. 
Outside Europe zoological collections were being 
formed in South America, although nothing oi their 
existence was knewn until centuries later. In the 
middle of the fifteenth century, King Nezalhualcoyotl 
had zoological gardens in Mexico. At the beginning 
of the next century the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II 
kept large collections of wild creatures, including 
serpents, fish, jaguars and ocelots, feeding the 
carnivorous animals on the plentiful wild turkeys of 
that part of the world. Cortez reported finding 
extensive aviaries and fishponds at Iztapalapan. 
From now on the keeping of menageries and zoo- 
logical collections became more widespread. Much 
of the initiative came from monarchs who vied with 
one another for the interest or rarity of their 
collections. Charles II of England kept a large 
assortment of birds in cages at Birdcage Walk (as it 
is still known) in London. After the menagerie in 
the Tower was opened to the public, James I started 
a small private one in St. James's Park. Here, away 
from the eyes of his subjects, he kept flying squirrels 
brought back from Virginia by Sir Thomas Dale, 
sables from Russia, gyrfalcons from Iceland, five 
camels, an elephant from the King of Spain (which 
had four attendants and ‘was given six bottles of wine 
daily in winter), and strangest of all, a cream fawn, 
for ‘which a woman was hired as a wet nurse. 
The collection at the Tower became a centre of 
great attraction, wild animals still being considerable 
rarities for the populace. In his Diary, Pepys records 
a visit in the 17th century there “to see the lions”. 
Not long afterwards a separate, privately-owned 
collection of animals was kept in the Strand. This 
was Pipcock’s menagerie, later taken over by Cross, 
who founded his own zoo in Surrey. One of the in- 
mates was Jack, a trained mandrill which smoked a 
pipe and drank spirits. Cross’s collections were 
housed under a glass dome, and he studied the 
longevity of captive carnivores. In 1731, the news

A ZOO BORN OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 
Mid-nineteenth century engravings show monkey house (opposite page) and two views of bear pit at the Museum of Natural History, Paris. 
Before the French Revolution this “King's Garden”, founded by Louis XIII, was already being widely used for studies of the natural sciences, 
and in particular of botany. Buffon, the famous I8th century naturalist, worked there for half a century. A menagerie was added in 1793 
when Bernardin de St, Pierre, the famous author, managed to prevent the destruction of the animals in the royal menagerie at Versailles, From 
that once magnificent collection there remained only a handful of beasts, including a kind of African antelope, a crested pigeon, an Indian rhino- 
ceros and an African lion. These fivesurvivors ofthe revolutionary upheavel were the first boarders at the Museum of Natural History, as the 
former King’s Garden was named. The present Paris Zoo was opened at Vincennes on the eastern edge of the French capital in 1935, 
that a litter of lion cubs had been born at the Tower 
created a great sensation. 
In 1735 an elaborate plan for a zoo for the Duke of 
Savoy and Piedmont was drawn up, idealistically 
indicating seven enclosures in a fan-shaped pattern, 
laid out artistically with avenues of trees and with 
only low walls separating the groups of bison, lions, 
ostriches, wild goats and so on. . This does anticipate 
much of the modern zoo lay-out, and the Mappin 
Terraces in Regent's Park, London, are not very 
remote from this early idea. 
By 1793 the French established a Museum of 
Natural History in Paris, and Buffon’s idea of having 
a menagerie attached took shape in what still sur- 
vives as the Jardin des Plantes. The original 
collection contained many valuable species and 
boasted a lion and a dog living amicably together. 
Although a great number of travelling and well- 
patronized menageries were coming into vogue the 
trend was towards the scientific keeping of wild crea- 
tures under more natural conditions, supported and 
encouraged by the growing interest in natural history 
museums and zoological societies. 
Thus it was that Regent’s Park gardens were 
founded by the Zoological Society of London in 1826. 
The collection from the royal menageries at the 
Tower, together with certain deer, emus and ostriches 
from Windsor Great Park were transferred to modern 
conditions in London. Here were installed some 297 
mammals, 637 birds and 18 reptiles—nearly a 
thousand creatures. By 1839 there were more than 
twice as many. 
The serious modern zoo had been born, and its like 
appeared all over the world, The Phoenix Park Zoo 
in Dublin was formed in 1830, and almost from the 
start it achieved a reputation for the successful 
breeding of lions. Bristol followed with the formation 
of the Clifton Zoo in 1835, Manchester with its 
privately-owned Belle Vue Zoo in 1836, Amsterdani 
Zoo, owned by the Society Natura Artis Magistra, in 
1838; a large menagerie at Antwerp in 1843; the 
famous and also privately-owned Tiergarten of Berlin, 
1844 ; and some years later the gardens at Edinburgh. 
Within the next twenty years or so, first-class zoo- 
logical gardens sprang up throughout the world. We 
find zoos being established in such widely separated 
places as Melbourne, 1857; Philadelphia, 1859; Co- 
logne, 1860; Hamburg, 1863; Copenhagen, 1859; Mos- 
cow, 1864; Calcutta, 1875; Cincinatti, 1875; and New 
York, 1889 and 1890. In addition zoos were laid out 
in Vienna, Rio de Janeiro, Hanover, Bombay, Tokyo, 
Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco, Brussels, Buenos 
Aires and countless other places, and the growth has 
continued right up to the present. 
By 1886, Regent's Park was a favourite and 
fashionable London resort. Its population has not 
diminished. It pioneered the use of radiant heat, 
artificial sunlight and modern ventilation, amenities 
now found in almost every large zoo. Almost all of 
the zoos established in the nineteenth century sur- 
vive and flourish today, although several in Europe 
were devastated during the war, 
After a long and arduous history, zoos have now 
come fully into their proper role which is to educate 
the public, ard especially young people, by inculcating 
a love of and a kinship with natural creatures. This 
is probably their greatest achievement.

Ministere de la France d'Cutre-Mer 
GOD OF THE FORGE and of fire in Dahomey, named 
Gou, is shown here with headdress bearing symbols of 
the metal-working trade. 
uring the two years she spent in 
Dahomey, Claudie Hauferlin, wife of an 
ethnologist, was brought face to face with 
the two Africas that exist side by side today 
—the new Africa undergoing the birth pains 
of modernization, and traditional Africa with 
its polygamous families, minor rulers and 
sorcerers. In the new Africa, where women 
have won the right to vote, they have also 
become printers and journalists, doctors 
and magistrates. In the old Africa women 
too have important roles as guardians of 
traditions, for they cling, far more than do 
the men, to ancestral rites and customs. 
In the first part of her article, “A Woman's 
Life in an African Village”, (THE UNESCO 
COURIER, March, 1957), Claudie Hauferlin 
depicted the traditional Dahomey family 
life—the quarrels between wives, the songs, 
marriage customs and social etiquette. Here 
she shows us her friends in the village of 
Mitro as astute and independent business 
women, enjoying a larger measure of free- 
dom, as women, than is commonly believed, 
and bringing up their families. 
~ BUSINESS AFFAIRS 
« EXTENSIVE FREEDOM 
~ RAISING A FAMILY 
by Claudie Hauferlin 
iT 1957 
Ew of the women of Mitro—the nearest village to my 
home in Dahomey—cook meals very often for their 
husbands, but as the Dahoman market is exactly like 
an open-air restaurant, the husbands are in no danger 
of starving. Bosi, a young woman with whom I spent 
much time, is typical of the majority of wives in this 
respect. 
Her household chores include little cooking and not 
much sewing, but on the other hand she often does 
washing. Here in Dahomey, it is not considered em- 
barrassing to wear torn clothes, While it would be un- 
seemly to appear in a soiled pagne (half-skirt), a torn 
garment is a sign of mourning or of straitened circumstan- 
ces, but never a proof of negligence. 
Bosi rises early, about five o'clock, and washes and 
dresses in her “bathroom”—one of the little outhouses 
made of dried, interwoven palm leaves which lean against 
the side of every hut in the village. She sees to her 
children and cleans out the hut. (The cleanliness of the 
Southern Dahomey villages is striking; the women, with 
brooms made of palm branches, seize every occasion of 
sweeping in and around their huts). There are always 
children to be washed and some laundry to be dried. Mo- 
thers rub their offspring vigorously with soap, and sluice 
them down with ‘water several times a day. At 
Porto-Novo, they even install themselves with their tubs 
on the pavements. Yet there are no taps in the houses; 
water has to be fetched from the river or the well, which 
is not always near, and carried back on the head in jars. 
Since Dahoman women hardly ever have to cook, they 
are able to devote time to trade—in fact, “business” is 
their main occupation. On the market place at Mitro, 
Bosi sells akasa, a starchy maize - paste, resembling 
maizena, which, in Dahoman cooking, is as important as 
the potato in some European cooking. She takes up her 
stand at the market from 8 a.m. onwards or else, with her 
basket on her head, goes round from tata to tata, display- 
ing her wares. (A tata is the group of houses of a single 
family surrounded by mud walls.) At about 4 p.m. she 
goes home where she finds plenty to do until the evening: 
preparing the akasa for market, carrying maize to be 
ground at the mill, making palm-oil for home use, and 
paying various visits—to kinsfolk in mourning, to her 
mother, to a friend who nas just had a baby, or to a 
newly-married fellow trader. 
Night falls swiftly in Africa; at 7.30 p.m. it is already 
dark. For an hour, with lanterns flickering in every hut, 
the whole village, looks like a Christmas tree. At 9 p.m. 
everyone is asleep and the only sounds are the drone of 
insects and the deep-throated croaking of the bull-frogs. 
Sometimes, the harsh sound of the night-guards’ horns 
haunts the village until dawn. On such nights, no woman 
would venture outside or even dare to peer curiously 
through the window; for the task of policing the district 
at night falls to a secret masculine society, known as the

Zangbeto, and no woman is allowed to see what goes on. 
One evening, Bosi, who had stayed late at a distant 
market, met the night-guards as she reached Mitro. She 
was fined, and recounting her adventure to me next day, 
she added in a whisper: “If things were still as they used 
to be, I should be dead now.” 
All the women of Mitro are traders. Tavi, the richest 
of my women acquaintances, has a stall with a very 
strange mixture of wares: pencils for schoolchildren, reels 
of cotton, fish hooks, talcum-.powder, antimony for the 
eyelids, and cigarettes. Videhu sells small piles of leaves, 
which are used here as wrapping paper. As for Henrietta, 
she takes her stand at the market with some frying palm- 
oll and sells piping hot maize fritters to the passers-by, 
Inviting them to come and sample her *delicious crisp 
fritters.” 
I spent a great deal of time at the market. An African 
market is a place where news is exchanged quite as much 
as goods. The Mitro market, held every other day, is one 
of the busiest in the region; it is a meeting-place for the 
people of the nearby plateau and those of the river. 
Women who come from distant villages to buy or sell, set 
out at two or three o'clock in the morning with forty to 
fifty pounds of merchandise cn their heads and their 
babies comfortably asleep attached to their backs. They 
return home about five o’clock in the evening. 
As soon as she used to see me, Laly Yemadje, an old 
fetisher-woman with whom I often 
sat, would unwind the Madras hand- 
The Unesco Courier. — May 1957 
she turns to selling palm-oil. This is the great trade of 
women—one of the most profitable, but also the one which 
is the most severely threatened by the establishment of 
oil factories. These concerns buy directly from the men 
who own the palm-plantations and the women are thus 
in danger of losing an entire source of earnings. For them 
it is a potential catastrophe. 
The profits that a Dahoman woman makes from her 
business are administered by her alone—in other words, 
she benefits from similar rights to those which women 
enjoy, for example, in England, under the Married Wo- 
man’s Property Act. The receipts from the market often 
do not amount to much—fifty to one hundred francs a 
day—but they are regular and, moreover, a woman's right 
to keep and to dispose of her earnings as she pleases, gives 
her a privileged position in the country’s economic system. 
A woman is thus able to keep herself if her husband 
does not fulfil his duty to feed his wife. And husbands 
are often slack about that—“He used to keep me when I 
was young,” Videhu told me, “but now he seldom gives 
me any money.” Bosi and Tavi—who have “good” 
husbands—admit that they sometimes contribute to the 
household expenses, especially during that period of bridg- 
ing the gap between harvests when food prices rise. 
They all told me, too, that they lend money against 
interest. Women are often the bankers of the family, and 
sometimes even of the entire village, where they control 
practically all of the trade. They 
earn less money than men, but they 
kerchief round her head to make me 
a cushion. We would exchange smiles, 
gestures and the few French or Gun 
words which we both know: “Alors, ¢a 
va?” (Well, everything all right?)— 
“Dagbe, dagbe.” According to Daho- 
man etiquette, any conversation must 
be prefaced by a long series of compli- 
ments and good wishes. With the 
help of my interpreter, questions and 
answers followed in quick succession: 
“How are you?”—*I am very well”— 
“How is your husband?”—-*Very well, 
thank you.” Every member of the 
family is mentioned . 
Then came the good wishes: “May 
you have continued good health”, 
“May your children be strong and 
healthy”, “May your business pros- 
per”, etc. To every wish, Laly Yem- 
adje replied “ami”, rubbing the palms 
of her hands together. In her turn, 
she hoped that I would have many 
children, that my husband would be 
made a governor or earn a larger 
salary—to which I answered “ami”, 
rubbing my hands. Here, silence is 
certainly not golden. Patiently, the 
family is enquired after again and 
more good wishes are expressed. 
When you receive a visitor in your 
own house, etiquette does not require 
that you stay to keep him company, but it does demand, 
that you come back from time to time to say: “Please 
make yourself comfortable.” 
When I first arrived in the village, Laly Yemadje was 
selling maize. Although there is a whole series of recepta- 
cles for measuring cereals accurately, Laly Yemadje, like 
all maize vendors, prefers to use baskets a little smaller 
than the standard size. She presses her arms round the 
basket, squeezing the maize up into a dome. Thus the 
customer, impressed by the overflowing pyramid, always 
has the feeling that he is getting more than his money’s 
worth and is better served here than elsewhere. As for 
the vendor of fritters or croquettes, she does not raise her 
prices at times when maize or manioc are scarce, but gives 
smaller portions for the same price, which the customer 
notices less. 
Women are not obliged to stick to one kind of trade. 
If Henrietta is in mourning for a few weeks and cannot 
go near the fire or do any cooking, she collects wood and 
chops it up for sale as firewood; Bosi does not hesitate to 
give up her akasa trade temporarily in order to speculate 
on maize. She Keeps an eye on the price of cereals, finds 
out how things are with the farmers who sell them and 
cleverly takes advantage of the slight differences between 
the harvest on the plateau and that in the valley. As for 
Laly Yemadje; after dealing in maize for a few months

Novo shows off her magnificent jewellery. 
earn it more regularly and it is to 
them that the men turn when in need 
of funds; often, in fact, men in debt 
obtain loans from the women by 
pledging their future harvests as 
security. This whole financial bal- 
ance Is now, of course, threatened by 
industrialization. 
Tavi uses her money to make herself 
attractive. She showed me her ward- 
robe one day; it contained twenty- 
six skirts for special occasions and 
ten everyday ones. “If they are 
shabby”, she said, “I give them to 
my grandmother”. 
Bosi, the most thrifty, confided to 
me that she is putting money aside 
in the hope of buying herself a palm- 
plantation one day; that is exception- 
al, because palm-plantations belong 
to men and when a woman possesses 
such land she tries to hide the fact 
that she is the owner. 
Henrietta, before her marriage, 
used her earnings to set up her future 
home; but now she puts some aside 
so that she may one day be able to 
open an ironmongery business. When 
I questioned Videhu, she threw up 
her hands in despair and said: “I have 
only the skirt I'm wearing. Money? 
I never have any—I don’t know where it goes. I'm sure 
that someone has cast a spell on me!” Remarks like these 
are very common: you do not manage your affairs badly, 
‘but you have enemies who send you bad luck. One day, 
I asked a schoolboy how he had done in his examinations 
and he replied: “Badly!—An uncle of mine has a spite 
against me.” 
One day, Laly Yemadje said to me:“When I have given 
a customer credit and she does not pay up, I go to see her 
and flatter her, but above all I do not get angry with her, 
otherwise she would buy nothing more from me.” Few 
women, however, are as patient as Laly Yemadje. Fre- 
quent disputes take place during which the defaulting 
customer often puts on an offended air. Insults to the 
family and warnings of impending diseases follow—there 
is no lack of pursuasive arguments. “Personally,” said 
Bosi, “I warn all my friends if one of my customers is in 
the habit of not paying for the goods that she buys on 
credit. The word goes around and in the end the "woman 
is forced to change markets because no one will sell her 
anything any more.” One morning, I saw 
a shabbily-dressed man arrive at the mark- rea 
et; he strode round it several times, shout- Cont'd on 
ing volubly and making threatening ges- 
tures. “One of the vendors has given him page 32 
some money”, my interpreter explained, “to

EVEN years ago eleven people sat 
down in a San Francisco art 
class to do the impossible. 
Plunging their hands into masses of 
wet clay for the first time in their 
lives, they set out to make sculptured 
portrait busts of themselves. And 
they were blind. 
It was Jeanne Kewell, a young and 
gifted art-teacher from the California 
School of Fine Arts who first con- 
ceived of sculpture as a method of 
helping the sightless to use their 
hands and find a valuable emotional 
outlet. Her original group of stu- 
dents, chosen from the San Francisco 
Centre for the Blind with no regard 
to talent or manual dexterity, caught 
fire from her enthusiasm. They 
learnt and carried out all the ne- 
cessary technical processes for them- 
selves, from the initial mixing of the 
clay to the hollowing out of the mo- 
dels before firing. For nine months 
they worked, patting, pressing, mould- 
ing the clay, and at the end of the 
year the doors of the California 
School of Fine Arts opened on an 
exhibition of eleven completed clay 
and terra cotta self-portraits made 
by eleven sightless men and women. 
Three of the eleven were blind from 
birth; others went blind later. 
Others again could still distinguish 
light from darkness, but these latter 
removed their glasses so that “all of 
the students might be on a more 
equal footing”. There could be no 
mirror for them, no gauging of dis- 
16 
‘bone structure, 
tance and relationship with pencil or 
thumb. They built their figures 
slowly in wet clay, feeling their own 
shape of feature, 
details of hair and expression, finger- 
ing the fold of flesh and curve of lips, 
forcing out of the clay, it seems, not 
~ only the likeness of their features but 
also some visible expression of an 
emotional attitude; for the astonished 
public could not only clearly reco- 
gnize the extraordinary physical 
resemblances, but also the suggestion 
of profound feeling built into the 
terra cotta and clay. What the artists 
said about their own work is very 
revealing. “I lived in a world of ideas 
and sounds”, said Leonid Malarevsky, 
a former accountant who lost his sight 
during the war, “and sculpture 
brought me back to the world of di- 
mensions”. Said Elsie Northern: “I 
get at the open window in the morn- 
ing and look up and wish that I could 
do something worth while”. Even 
more moving were the words of Louise 
Bixler: “I wanted to portray the 
sagging feeling in a person when they 
can scarcely bear any more... I didn’t 
think of the head as just a chunk of 
clay, but I thought here, under here, 
is my heart... I was thinking of what 
life had made of me.” 
After the West Coast exhibition the 
busts were shown at the Brooklyn 
Museum in New York, and later at a 
private art gallery, arousing enorm- 
ous interest and a great deal of dis- 
cussion. Some critics pointed out the 
  
   
high degree of manual dexterity and 
tactile awareness in these works; 
others related a certain monumental- 
ity and austerity in the portraits to 
the art of other periods, such as early 
Egyptian art, when expressive quali- 
ties were counted of greater impor- 
tance than visual ones. Others again 
claimed that memory played the 
predominant role, and insisted that 
strict representationalism had been’ 
the aim, and fhe lack of pictorial 
detail was more a limitation of sight 
than a deliberate choice of form. 
Since that time the experiment has 
expanded and the particular value 
of sculpture for the blind become 
more widely recognized. 
In Amsterdam, for instance, at an 
exhibition of the work of the English 
sculptor Henry Moore in the Stedelijk 
Museum, the director invited several 
blind people to visit it and tell him 
what they thought of the different 
works, Patting, stroking, passing 
their hands over the curves and 
angles, over the forms of this sculptor, 
their first reactions were much the 
same as the sighted public. The 
shapes did not feel like bodies and 
heads, they. thought. But some of 
them, returning again and again, 
liked them more and more. As one 
of them said, “It is better when you 
come to understand that Mr. Moore 
isn’t imitating life but telling you 
about it. It is the same with music.” 
Jeanne Kewell, in the meantime, 
had been extending her work to the

education of blind children. A class 
of eighteen ranging roughly in age 
from nine to thirteen, with one girl 
of seventeen among them, was cho- 
sen, again without regard for artistic 
leanings. “The sighted child”, says 
Jeanne Kewell, “learns through visual 
exploration and initiation. The blind 
child does not. Through sculpture” 
she claims, “he can come to know the 
intimacy of objects, formulations, 
concepts, and ideas”. The eighteen 
children, therefore, were given the 
clay to play with and handle, chose 
their subjects and began to model, 
no one child working for more than 
a total of thirty-two hours over a 
four-month period. 
‘What subjects did they choose ? 
The little girl whose family group had 
been separated through illness and 
death modelled families—the dog 
family, the bird family, in smooth 
rounded shapes. Others chose single 
animals, birds, cats, dogs, horses—all, 
be it observed, domestic animals they 
may once have seen. The child 
with no visual memory, blind from 
birth, made a rough unrecognizable 
heap representing a bird, in a nest 
curiously suggestive of the walls of a 
room; children who had been studying 
King Arthur in English class modelled 
knights in the clay. « They were hor- 
rible men, I think”, said one, “you 
can hear the blood”. 
Extraordinarily powerful in its 
sense of opposing forces is the horse 
and rider modelled by an eleven-year- 
 
old boy, blind since seven. “I like to 
ride on things” he said, adding “I 
like horses especially”. Unbearably 
poignant is “The Solitary child”— 
three figures at the playground 
bench, two together at one end, one 
small immobile form seated alone at 
the other. The blind nine-year-old 
who made it gave a name to the child 
sitting spart. It was his own. And 
there are the two solid featureless 
figures modelled by a thirteen-year- 
old girl. Her brief explanation of them 
may well stand for all these children 
struggling in blackness—“She says

Whether the theories of aesthetic 
values propounded by some of the cri- 
tics are valid, time alone will tell. 
But of the healing and releasing pro- 
pertles of this form of activity for the 
blind, in this new method of expres- 
sion and appreciation, there can be 
little doubt. The faceless

FORTY JUMPS 
THROUGH 
THE UNIVERSE

On the pages that follow, we invite our readers on an imaginery and fantastic journey through space 
—into the world of the infinitely large and the world of the infinitely small. Our voyage will be un- 
dertaken in a unique fashion, by a series of 40 jumps in the direction of a straight line perpendicular ~ 
to the horizon. In the first part of the voyage each jump will be on a scale ten times smaller (in the 
second part on a scale ten times larger) than the preceding one until we have reached the two extre- 
me limits of size of our Universe. Forty Jumps Through the Universe, or “Cosmic View”, as its author 
terms it, has been devised by Kees Boeke founder and former director of the Werkplaats Children’s 
Community at Bilthoven, Netherlands, a pioneer “comprehensive school” created in 1926. The 
school is now associated with the International Federation of Children’s Communities founded with 
the aid of UNESCO. Fcrty Jumps Through the Universe reveals in a novel and fascinating fashion 
the different orders of magnitude of the Brobdingnagian and Lilliputian worlds around us, and 
can serve as a stimulating complement to the UNESCO pamphlet “Man Measures the Universe” 
(see inside back cover for details concerning this pamphlet and free offer to subscribers). 
T is important for us human beings who are living together on 
our little planet to widen our sphere of interest. We are too 
often inclined to consider our immediate surroundings as our 
“world”. For some of us it may be the house in which we live, 
for others our village or town, for many our country. For the 
few it is the continent, for fewer still the whole earth. But even 
this horizon is too limited. We must develop a truly cosmic view 
if we are to become free from the narrow provincialism, the chau- 
vinistic outlook, which is such a hindrance to a truly human atti- 
tude, and therefore one of the great dangers which beset mankind. 
In order to develop this cosmic view, and thus as a help in 
education for international understanding, the material which fol- 
lows has been devised (1). In the hands of a teacher who has 
this wide outlook and interest, it may help children and young 
people to realize their relative position in the great and mysterious 
whole of the Universe. 
At school we are introduced to a great many different spheres 
of existence, but they are often not connected with each other. 
It is therefore of value in our education to supply ourselves with 
the means of developing a wider and more connected view of the 
strange world in which we are placed. 
This series of illustrations, published for the first time in the 
pages of the UNESCO COURIER, originated years ago in a school 
in the Netherlands, the “Werkplaats Children’s Community” at 
Bilthoven, where a group of children under my guidance drew 
the original pictures which form its basis. 
I began this project with them because I realized the importance 
of developing a “sense of scale” and I therefore proposed to the 
children to draw the same objects in different scales, using the 
units of the “metric system”. 
When we started to make the pictures, we at once saw that it 
looked as if we were going right up into the sky, so that we saw 
the objects from ever increasing heights, smaller and smaller, where- 
as at the same time a constantly increasing area around them 
was included in our view. We also noticed that the imaginary 
jump we had to make to see the next picture at a ten times smaller 
. (1) It will shortly be published in book form under the title “Cosmic 
View : Forty Jumps through the Universe” (John Day Company, 62 West 
45th Street, New York 36, New York, U.S.A.). Price : $2.95. It will then 
also be published in the Netherlands in Durch.

scale had to be ten times higher than the one before, and we 
soon found that we had started on a tremendous journey of 
exploration, for we began to wonder what we would discover if 
we kept on going up in the same way. 
In undertaking such a plan, it was first necessary to decide on 
the date and time of day, for we had to know where the sun would 
be at that moment. With the group of children in Holland, we 
assumed that the moment of observation in each case would be, 
and would remain, the 21st of December 1951, at noon. We 
knew that the sun would then be in what is called the “Winter 
Solstice”, and that it would stand in the south. 
We chose as our object to start with a little girl sitting in a deck 
chair in the courtyard in front of the school building, and facing 
south. When we started on our project, we hardly suspected what 
our self-imposed task, which seemed so simple, would lead to. 
The first 26 pictures are the record of such an imaginary journey 
up into space. 
The question then arose : what should we see, if instead of 
decreasing the scale, we should increase it each time in order to 
plunge into the world of the infinitely small? To find this out, 
we had to go back to the original picture of the little girl sitting 
in front of the school. We then began a second journey of 
exploration, which proved to be as full of marvels as the first, 
and which is shown in the second half of this story in pictures on 
page 28. 
In our jump upwards into the heavens (Numbers 1 to 26) each 
illustration is on a scale ten times smaller than the one before it. 
This means that every centimetre (or inch) in a drawing is equiva- 
lent to a ten times larger distance, than the drawing preceding it. 
Thus the first picture is on a scale of “one to fifteen”, that is, one 
centimetre portrays what in reality is 15 centimetres. In the 
second picture, one centimetre represents ten times the distance or 
a length of 150 centimetres, and so on until the centimetre in illus- 
tration 26 stands for a real length of unimaginable magnitude. 
1 cm = 10 millimetres or 4/10 inch. Thus a centimetre in one 
view simply becomes the same number of millimetres in the next. 
In our jump downward into the microcospic world (Numbers 0 to 
minus 13) the reverse is true, and each photo is on a scale ten 
times larger than the one before it until in the final illustration 
each centimetre stands for a real length of unimaginable tinyness. 
Under each photo the scientific degree of scale is indicated.

O:'"° AND CAT. Our voyage into the universe begins with 
this simple photograph of a girl holding a cat. This is what we 
are going to look at as we move straight up into the sky at noon on 
December 21, 1951. Cat is used merely to compare sizes of living 
creatures as they would occur in later domains of scale. It is assumed 
we look down on scene from a height of 5 metres (161 ft), or 33 cm 
on this scale. Smallest humans are pygmies: average 1.45 m (4.80 ft), 
Tallest: Patagonians and Lake Chad Africans (1.84 m; 6.07 ft),

(2) TEN TIMES SMALLER. The small square in the centre of this 
second illustration is the miniature image, reduced ten times, of the 
preceding picture. Near the child with the cat we can seé the compar- 
ative size of two automobiles and the front part of a blue whale, the 
largest animal the world has ever known. The giant blue whale meas- 
ures up to 34 metres (100 feet). Diplodocus was about 25 m (82.5 ft) 
long. Certain Americain sequoias have attained heights of 83 m 
(274 ft), some marine algae lengths of 100-200 m (330-660 fc).

WHALE IN A SCHOOL. We now look down from a height of 
500 meters (1,640 ft) on a U-shaped building (1) the Werkplaats 
Children's Community at Bilthoven, Netherlands. In the courtyard 
is the small square which corresponds to the previous illustration. We 
now can see the whole whale (2), and the two cars are still visible (3) 
but the little girl (4) is practically invisible. The long building (5) 
is typically Dutch: it is a large bicycle shed for the numberless bicycles 
on which the children from the surrounding area come to schoo! 
r——— | cm = [5,000 cm = | 50 metres. 
CHILD HAS VANISHED. Jt is surprising that already in this 
fourth image the child which filled the greater part of the first picture 
has completely disappeared. We must not forget that each time we 
jump upward we rise ten times higher than we were in order to produce 
an image ten times smaller than the one before. The wavy line reaching 
the child represents, symbolically, a radio wave of the Hilversum Sender, 
enabling us to compare its wave length with the other objects in this 
illustration. We are at a height of 5,000 metres or 5 km (3 miles).

the second effect of the jumps we are making: not only do all things we 
see become smaller each time, but the area also increases tenfold.

Its axis in empty space. The sun, to the south, casts its shadow towards 
north, Two dotted lines mark limits of this shadow or “umbra” (1), as 
otherwise they could not be shown against the blackness all around. 
Other dotted line shows path of earth, moving from right to left. Many 
distant stars would be visible but are omitted here and in following

moon was on the left, night on earth was lit up there by its reflected light.

SUN COMES IN. The sun (I) has now come into the picture, 
The dot denoting it and of course that showing the earth (2) are 
much too big. Inside the earth's orbit are the planets Mercury (3) 
and Venus (4). Outside it are Mars (5) and Jupiter (6) with their 
orbits, The position of the planets In this and the following drawings 
is that which they occupied on December 21, 1951. Apart from the 
sun and the planets we see part of the orbit of Halley's comet (7), 
which comes into our “neighbourhood” once every seventy-seven years.

in the centre of a black square. Yet the spot stands for our whole Solar 
System (the sun along with all the planets, comets, asteroids and meteor- 
ites which move around it... and their orbits{). Numberless stars, we 
see at night, may possibly have similar satellites moving around them.

Earth: It is about 25 billion miles (in U.S, trillion miles) or 4 light 
years away, (i.e. light travelling at 186,000 miles a second takes 4 years 
to cover the space). A jet plane going 700 miles (1,120 km) an hour 
would take almost a million years to reach it. From our observation 
point here looking down the sun is closer to us than Alpha Centauri.

give a wrong impression of what the Solar System would look like, 
as all the orbits are shown, What would be seen would be only sun

for star of its magnitude is barely visible with naked eye from "dis- 
tance of more than 55 light years. Present point of observation:

more than 6 months to cover that enormous distance from the earth, 
travelling at the rate of 299,800 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. 
As we have imagined that we made our trip without spending any 
time, this means that if we had a marvellously good telescope we could 
at this point see what happened on our little earth over six months ago!

BEYOND SOLAR SYSTEM. We have now jumped so high 
that we have come right out of the complex of stars to which our 
Solar System belongs, and which we can see on a clear star-lit night as 
a strip right across the sky: the “Milky Way” or “Galactic System™. 
It contains thousands of millions of stars. Our sun is a very unimportant 
one and Is located not in centre but on outskirts as seen above. In

MORE WORLDS. Countless galaxies and clusters of galaxies 
are known to be spread out in all directions around our *‘Local 
Group”. "In previous drawings only a few galaxies were shown but 
were put in their correct positions. Here no more than a general 
sketch can be given of the numberless worlds surrounding them. Each 
galaxy or stellar nebula is isolated in space by an almost complete vac- 
uum extending for one or two million light years. Bridges of matter 
between certain galaxies have, however, been discovered in recent years.

THE MILKY WAY. We now see whole galactic system or 
“Galaxy™. It is a “Spiral”, a circular disk with protruding spiral 
arms and bulging centre. We see it partly tilted, hence as an ellipse. 
In small square we recognize a rather irregular spiral, near which our 
Solar System is situated. Other spiral arms can be seen. Below on 
right is a nebulous body, the Great Magellanic Cloud, a much smaller 
galaxy, far behind our “Milky Way”. White dots around galaxy are 
some of the 100 or more clusters of stars which surround it.

STILL MORE WORLDS. Some thousand million galaxies are 
visible with present telescopes, the furthest 2,000 million light 
years from Earth. Galaxies are not fixed in position relative to one 
another; they are moving away from each other at varying speeds. 
According to one theory the Universe is continuously expanding. 
Clusters of galaxies, above, have been placed arbitrarily. What is 
shownis certainly very much less than what actually exists, in the immen- 
sity of the Universe, for the galaxies would be much nearer to each other 
and they would continue far beyond the confines of the present picture...

in groups, some small, others hundreds or even a thousand strong. 
Our Galaxy belongs to a small group, called the “Local Group™. Ellip- 
soidal in shape, its larger axis is 2 million light years long. Nearest 
galaxies to ours were shown in previous photo. The Magellanic Clouds 
are respectively 150,000 and 170,000 light years from sun. Among 
more distant galaxies, Messier 3| Cluster (6) the Great Spiral 
Nebula in constellation Andromedais 1,600,000 light years from sun. 
~ FROM MACROCOSM TO MICROCOSM 
ow far these countless millions of worlds continue outside the large square of illustration n° 26 is 
not known. All these worlds seem to be rushing away from a centre somewhere, and therefore 
from each other. Their speed seems to increase the further away they have proceeded on their 
ways. It seems also that space is curved, but how it is curved is not yet known, nor do we know 
if the Universe has a “radius”. As all this is still so vague and uncertain, we end our imaginary journey 
into these infinite expanses of space and turn back, to go through all the stages we passed on our flight 
upwards. Let us attempt to picture to ourselves what it means each time the small central square extends 
and extends as we come nearer and nearer to the Solar System, which must be there in the centre... until 
at last the small square has grown to the size of the large one, and what we then see is to be found on 
the previous drawing. It is clear that on this return journey the height from which we view the pa- 
norama decreases each time tenfold from station to station. When we have returned to the original 
picture of the little girl in her chair, which we reproduce again on the next page, the height of our point 
of observation has again become only '5 metres, and when we continue in the same way to the next 
picture, it will be one tenth of this, that is only 50 centimetres. 
    
We shall see, when we pursue our campaign of exploration, that on this journey we can go 
through only half the number of stages we passed on the first expedition. We shall reach the unknown 
after 13 of them whereas in the journey upwards we counted 26 jumps. But who will say what wonders : 
are hidden beyond the limits of man’s investigations of today? :

PREPARE TO PLUNGE. We now begin the second part of our 
adventure, this time plunging downward into the world of the 
infinitely small. Our jumping off point is once again the girl with her 
cat. One of the things we have wanted to find out has been: in how 
many of the domains of scale are living creatures known to occur? 
Thus far we have found them only in photos numbered |, 2 and 3. 
From now on we shall continue to look for representatives of the 
living world in all succeeding scales. Unusual creatures and objects will

In the centre of the tiny square we may be able to distinguish a minute 
white spot. It is a grain of salt. We will note that, contrary to our

2000 miles). Sodium nucleus would be one-thirtieth of a millimetre, 
the hydrogen nucleus or “proton” one-hundredth of a millimetre. 
A. so our journey ends at the nucleus of the atom, that 
mysterious, utterly small and incredibly powerful centre of 
energy which only recently has unveiled some of its secrets 
to mankind. Whereas at the end our first journey we stood 
in awe before the imposing greatnéss of the dimensions of the 
Universe, and felt as nothing in comparison to their immen- 
sity, the conditions are now completely different. True, we 
feel 'as much awe and reverence when we attempt to think 
of the miracles of dynamic power which are hidden in these 
domains of the smallest existing entities, but our own dimen- 
sions are now indescribably colossal compared with what we 
see. Thus in the last drawing a man’s height on that scale 
would be of the nature of 10 thousand million kilometres, 
that is about the diameter of the Solar System! If we add 
to that the thought, that man is beginning to control and 
use these limitless nuclear powers, it is clear that unthinkable 
possibilities are within his reach. When we thus think in 
cosmic terms we realize, that, if he is to become really 
human, man must combine in his being the greatest humility 
with the most careful and considerate usc of the cosmic powers 
of which he can dispose. 
The problem, however, is that primitive man at first tends 
to use the power put in his hands for himself, instead of 
spending his energy and life for the good of the whole growing 
human family which has to live together in the limited space 
of our planet. But now it is a matter of life and death for 
the whole of mankind that we learn to live together and that 
our children be educated in a spirit of tolerance and mutual 
respect, regardless of differences of birth or upbringing, of 
nationality or race, of creed or conviction.

### 67527: A Woman's life in an African village, part 2: Business affairs, extensive freedom, raising a family

WOMAN'S LIFE 
(Continued from page 15)     
come here and publicly denounce a customer who hasn't 
paid her debts!” 
The Dahoman woman is free, far +reer than Is 
commonly imagined in Europe—she is free to go out (and 
even to travel), free to carry on her business as she thinks 
best and to do exactly as she likes with the money she 
earns. 
Bosi and Henrietta were born at Mitro, but Videhu and 
Tavi lived in neighbouring villages before they were 
married: and Se Kande, the Chief's ‘wife, is from Porto- 
Novo. These women often visit their families. From time 
to time, Tavi, piling a few skirts, crockery, provisions 
and gifts on her head, sets out with her children on foot, 
or in a lorry if she is lucky enough to find “a lift”. Her 
visits to her native village last a week or two. Once she 
was away nearly two months: “My mother was ill, so I 
looked after her”, she explained. One of Henrietta’s 
friends made up her mind one day to visit some of her 
relations in Nigeria... the other side of the world #or a 
little village girl. Another set out for Natitingu, a 
Northern town some four hundred miles away, to see her 
daughter. 
For the three religions 
tolerance is de rigueur 
  
conform to a very severe traditional code of morality. 
One day I found Tavi in bed with a high fever; she 
accepted the quinine tablets which I offered her, but said, 
“I am going to see the witch-doctor to tind out what gave 
me the fever”. It is never by chance that one is laid low 
by sickness. Fever is either a punishment for having 
forgotten to make some offering, or a sacrifice demanded 
by an ancestor, or, again, a penalty for having offended 
the gods. In such circumstances, a doctor is all very well, 
but a witch-doctor is still better. There are remedies— 
medicinal plants to soothe a stomach ache, bring down a 
fever or a swelling and relieve pain—but, most important 
of all are the purifying baths and penances prescribed by 
the witch-doctor, 
The Dahoman woman lives with a sword of Damocles 
over her head—the possibility that she may be punished 
for a sin, even unconsciously committed, by seeing one of 
her relations become sick or even die. One day, I asked 
after a fisherman whom I had not seen for a long 
time. Bosi told me with a confidential air: “His body is 
swollen, he is very ill”, and she added: “Perhaps it is 
because of his wife.” This woman was reputed to be 
fickle; and, according to tradition, when a woman is 
unfaithful to her husband he is always warned of it 
because he falls ill. “Time was when the gods killed the 
woman”, sald an old fetisher-woman regretfully. If the 
invalid is to recover, the misdeed must be confessed and 
the name of the seducer revealed. 
So far as the punishment of adultery, theft, scandal- 
mongering or disrespect is concerned, Dahoman morality 
is a private code, designed to keep the family intact; the 
principal punishments are sickness or sterility, which, as 
they strike the individual, show that he or she has 
offended against society. . 
There are other obligations and other things forbidden. 
The school-teacher’s ‘wife explained to me that every 
family, probably for reasons connected with its distant 
antecedents, refrains from eating certain foods. Tavi 
does not eat eels, Videhu does not eat snails and Bosi does 
not touch certain vegetables. When she gets married, a 
woman never forgets to ask an old aunt for her husband’s 
“diet sheet”, so that she will not run the risk of serving 
him with types of food forbidden in his family. 
The gods may forbid those who worship them to eat 
certain foods. Thus Videhu, a fetisher of serpent- 
worship, eats no fish that is smoked and rolled around a 
stick because its form suggests a coiled snake, 
32 
B utr though the Dahoman woman is free, she has to 
How free is the African housewife? 
Henrietta's sister-in-law, Mary-Jane, is a Roman 
Catholic but her husband worships the vodun. She had 
her last child baptised but all the others, who are dead, 
were not Catholics: “As all the other children died, I had 
this one baptised”, she informed me. And (she must have 
acquired tolerance in her family) she added: “In any 
case, the witch-doctor had told me to do it.” I met a 
fetisher woman ‘whose two sons were Animists, one of her 
daughters a Protestant and the other a Roman Catholic; 
and when I asked the reason for this diversity, she 
replied with some such words as “One mustn't put all 
one’s eggs in one basket!” In the village, religious 
differences do not lead to quarrels and, in a tata, 
Moslems, Christians and Animists get on very well 
together. 
Although Christians and Moslems may refrain from 
taking part in the religious ceremonies, ancestors continue 
to be universally hallowed. Before they drink, Henrietta 
and Bosi, like their fetisher friends and kinswomen, never 
forget to sprinkle a few drops on the ground “for our 
ancestors”. While Tavi’s children wear greegrees on their 
wrists, Bosi’s three children have devotional medals, and 
Animata hangs round her little daughter’s neck a sachet 
containing a few verses of the Koran. They believe that 
scapulars and verses of the Koran have the same value 
and function as greegrees—to ward off sickness and 
death, the two disasters which haunt Dahoman women. 
And there is some justification for their fears: Bosi’s baby 
died of a fever in three days, and Mary-Jane has lost 
three children. There are very few women at Mitro who 
have never lost any children and I have met some who 
have seen four or five and even as many as seven of their 
babies die. 
In these African villages where three religions coexist— 
the old Animist religion, Mohammedanism and Christia- 
nity—great tolerance reigns among the people. When 
Henrietta’'s old uncle died, part of the family sacrificed 
the traditional chickens, while cousins from the town 
sprinkled the body with holy water. Tavi, who is very 
particular about her appearance, once enumerated the 
occasions on which a “smart” woman likes to dress up; 
in addition to religious festivals and traditional 
ceremonies, I was astonished to hear her—a devotee of 
thunder-worship—mention Christmastide. “For my Chris- 
tian kinswomen and friends, it is a festival”, she 
explained, “so I too put on my best clothes, and go to 
church to see what the ceremony is like”. One day, a 
high dignitary of a local religion told me that he was a 
Roman Catholic. Seeing my amazement, he gave me a sly 
smile and said: “After all, I wasn’t born in Rome!” 
I saw the finest example of this tolerance one day when 
I was invited to a big local wedding. The young couple, 
who had been married the day before according to local 
custom, called at the Civil Registry Office in the early 
morning, 'were married in the Roman Catholic church at 
ten o'clock and then, about midday, received a blessing 
from the Moslem Imam. As one guest, who was toasting 
the couple, told them: “You'll run into terrible difficulties 
if you ever try to divorce!” 
    Herb-tea prepared 
by ¢ those who know’ Ji 
sour one year after her marriage, Henrletta had her 
first child. Throughout her pregnancy, she followed 
the advice of her mother, of elderly aunts and of 
other old women, and wore round her hips a greegree cord, 
which is supposed to protect the child; she drank herb- 
tea, carefully prepared by women “who know” and avoided 
going near too hot a fire; but she continued to work and 
carry burdens. No word was spoken, in her hearing, of 
her pregnancy and no plans or preparations were made 
for the child, in order not to tempt Providence. Death, 
they say, is always lying in wait and its attention is easily 
attracted. Many women have refrained from telling me 
how many children they have, or else have told me in a

whisper, so as not to arouse the interest of Death, or of 
Jealous ‘women “friends” who would rejoice in their 
ecease. 
Henrietta gave birth to her child in her hut, assisted by 
the village matrons. Only about a third of the village 
women go to the clinic for their confinement. “The 
clinic is twelve and a half miles away from here”, the 
school-teacher explained to me, “and it is not always 
easy to go there; besides, the women here calculate their 
period of pregnancy very roughly”. Se Kande, one of the 
wives of the village Chief, waited over a month at the 
clinic for the birth of her last son; and two of her sisters, 
who had gone with her to help prepare her meals, stayed 
with her throughout that period. Near to the clinics I 
have often seen women, surrounded by children, cooking 
on a portable stove for a relation who is in hospital. 
Patients whose families live nearby have their meals 
brought to them every day. 
Alihossi, the little girl 
‘who was born on the road’ 
  
oR Se Kande, this absence from home was no handi- 
F cap, since, being the Chief’s wife, she does not go in 
for trade; but for the other village women it is a 
serious matter to stay for several weeks at the clinic, doing 
and earning nothing. “And on top of that”, said 
Bosi, “one is never sure of being able to get one’s custo- 
mers back afterwards”. Nevertheless, when she was 
expecting her little girl, Bosi decided to have her baby 
at the clinic and to go there at the very last minute. 
Indeed, she left it so late that the child was born in a 
ditch, a few miles from Mitro. The little girl was thus 
called “Alihossi”, or “she who was born on the road”. 
In Dahomey, one’s name is almost a curriculum vitae. 
It describes one’s birth, events in the family during one’s 
mother’s pregnancy, and anything unusual that happened 
when one was born. One of Videhu’s children is called 
“They told lies” because, when he was born, his family 
was in the throes of a quarrel involving slander. 
S0 many names here recall to mind that infant 
mortality is the great scourge of the countryside. One 
child is called Kudunukpo, or “Death has taken my 
children”; another is called Yemalo, or “He who is no 
longer awaited”. As for Se Kande's baby, his name is 
“It is Death's fault”, because, before he was born, Se 
Kande had lost her three children, one after the other. 
Her last-born has special tattoo marks on his cheeks and 
wears copper bells round his ankles, so that his little dead 
brothers may not come to fetch him. 
Roman Catholics give their children the name of the 
saint’s day on which they are born. Henrietta’s son is 
called George because he was born on April 23. Had he 
been born the next day, he would have been called Gaston. 
One day I saw a man, who had just become a father, 
looking very crestfallen, He said to me: “My child was 
born last Sunday—what am I to do?” It was Septua- 
gesima Sunday! 
Christians also have several African names which are 
given to them seven or nine days after their birth, during 
the ceremonies succeeding the confinement. These 
traditional ceremonies still take place at Port-Novo, in 
modern and old-fashioned families alike; they are 
accompanied by a great deal of pomp. - Sugared almonds 
(the traditional sweetmeat offered at French christenings) 
may not yet have appeared on the scene, but the custom 
of displaying all the “birthday presents” is becoming 
increasingly common. One day when I went to see the 
newborn son of the wife of a Porto-Novan official, I 
found the baby dressed in pink garments and lying amidst 
embroidered cushions and bowls overflowing with tins of 
talcum powder, bottles of scented oil, cakes of soap and 
eau-de-cologne. 
Henrietta’s son, George, is a member of his father's 
family. That is what is meant by the expression “a child 
belongs to his father”. If Henrietta divorced, she would 
take her son with her, but would later send him back to 
his father. For it is from his father that he will later 
receive his lands and titles; when he is of an age to marry, 
again it is his father who will give him his first wife by 
helping him to pay the dowry. 
The Unesco Courier. — May 1957 
In the towns, modern young women are beginning to 
consider this custom unfair, and several have said to me: 
“We should at least like to keep our daughters with us.” 
In the village, however, the women considered my 
questions on this subject out of place. This rule, perhaps, 
surprises us; yet it is responsible for the strength of the 
African family, for it keeps the men in the same place 
and thus ensures the family’s continuity. 
In reality, the link between the child and its mother is 
a very strong one. I am always struck by African 
children’s affection for their mother, and aiso by the 
tenderness of their relationships. Completely naked, with 
little rounded stomachs and rolling their large inquisitive 
eyes, they are adorned with multi-coloured pearl necklaces 
and bracelets. There are never any “washed-out” looking 
children. I ‘went to see Henrietta’'s son the day after his 
birth and found the baby asleep. He was hardly browner 
than if he were slightly sunburnt, and I exclamed: “He's 
a little vovo, a little white boy!”, for newly-born Africans 
all have fair skins. There was general laughter and my 
interpreter said: “You'll see him in a few weeks and 
he'll be completely black.” 
Henrietta's friends came to visit her, almost all of them 
with a child hanging in a cloth on their backs. The 
babies were dressed in their best clothes and, with their 
faces smeared with talcum powder, looked like little 
pierrots. The women chattered and, ‘whenever a child 
started to cry, its mother would sit down, lift up her 
muslin blouse, undo the cloth, catch hold of the baby 
under the armpit and pull it round on to her knees to 
give it the breast. Children are reared in this way up to 
the age of two or even three. This lays the foundation of 
children’s affection for their mothers; a child who later 
joins his father never forgets his mother, and will help 
her and often house her in her old age. 
I seldom hear children cry. Is it because their mothers 
seldom scold them and they are not always being told, 
“don’t touch this”, “don’t do that”, “don’t pick your nose”, 
or “hold yourself straight”? A child’s mother feeds him 
when he is hungry and puts him to sleep when he is tired 
and he doesn’t seem any the worse for it. An African 
child is relaxed and free and appears thoroughly happy. 
He does not know what loneliness means. Agossu, Bosl’s 
eldest child, has a host of small cousins in the tata with 
whom he can play; he also has his neighbours and as 
many friends of his own age as he could wish. They 
dance in a ring and together build little bamboo cages or 
make whistles. A Ilittie ten-year-old cripple, his legs 
wasted away by a mysterious disease, makes miniature 
lorries out of bamboo sticks. He forgets nothing, not even 
the spare tyre, which is made out of a dried fruit, round 
and flat like a fig. 
Solving the great problem 
of an empty continent. 
  
GossU, who is already seven years old, does not spend 
A all his time playing. His mother asks him to do 
little jobs for her. He often goes to market to buy 
one or two francs’ worth of peanuts. “He is learning the 
value of money” Bosi said, and added : “When you take 
him to France, he will already know how to count”; she 
winked as she said this, for Agossu’s trip to Europe was 
a standard joke between us. From time to time, his father 
takes him into the fields where he hoes the furrows with 
a little hoe just the right size for him. He is already 
treated like a little man. Helen, his cousin, who is six, is 
also learning to work. She has a little jar with which she 
goes to fetch ‘water from tne marigot, and a miniature 
palm-broom to sweep out the hut (or pretend to). On 
market days, her mother enirusts her with manioc cro- 
quettes which she carries on a tray on her head, selling 
them from door to door. 
A child is always wanted and always expected with joy. 
To have a large family is one of the reasons invoked in 
defence of polygamy. In a farmer’s family, children are 
a guarantee that labour will always be available. They 
are also a guarantee that the dead will continue to be 
revered. Lastly, as every African vaguely feels, even in 
thickly populated areas, to have children is to help solve 
the great problem of Africa—how to populate an almost 
empty continent, and give it vitality.

caricature of reality, seems to me unworthy of the cultural level and of the 
objectivity which should be maintained by the magazine. It should, in any 
case, be absolutely proscribed in a large-circulation periodical published by 
an international and inter-governmental organization working for the 
brotherhood and closer relations between peoples. In this regard, the 
illustrations used for this article seem to me to be of such a nature as to 
arouse, in inexperienced minds, more a sentiment of hostility than a desire

Sir, 
Hearty congratulations for your 
January number! No issue until now 
has been so beautiful, so well written 
and presented as the arresting work of 
Masaccio and the Perisan miniatures. 
They have revived the fairy dreams of 
my childhood. I spent a whole evening 
admiring both the finesse of the printing 
and the perfection of the colours and 
not once did this tire me. 
When I was at Montserrat (about 100 
miles from Barcelona) I remember seeing 
the Black Virgin which you reproduced 
(page 20), but covered with huge jewels 
and emeralds... Before reaching the 
monastery—Ilittle is left connected with 
the name of Ignazio de Loyola—I was 
surprised by the unbelievable strange- 
ness of the site: a pile of gigantic 
columns, and sometimes extraordinary 
- shapes which seem to have been care- 
fully sculpted in the mountain side. 
" On enquiring I was told: “It is the 
erosion of the winds and waters”. This 
explanation did not satisfy me, and the 
allusion you make to the “many legends 
which have grown up around the 
extraordinary site” has aroused my 
curiosity. Why not publish an article 
on this subject? I am sure it will 
interest your readers. 
Certainly many striking and curious 
legends must still exist in various parts 
of the world, in Africa and in Central 
America, in Rhodesia and Mexico, in 
Peru and Asia Minor. These legends 
have their roots in the most distant anti- 
quity, and something about them would 
be sure to interest your readers. It 
might also put professional and amateur 
archaeologists and writers (such as P. 
Hermann, M. Briou etc.) on the track 
of important discoveries or lead to 
studies on these oral traditions 
transmitted from generation to gene- 
ration.

Sir, 
I am an invalid (tota! deafness) who 
like other invalids has had his share of 
suffering on this earth. UNESCO must 
certainly deal with the conditions of 
invalids, and I should like to read 
something about its efforts in the 
columns of THE UNESCO COURIER.

EDITOR'S NOTE : An issue on this subject 
is being planned for a later date. Reha- 
bilitation of the physically handicapped is 
the responsibility of the United Nations in 
New York, and the World Health Organi- 
zation. A conference of all international 
organizations dealing with the physically 
handicapped is convened periodically by 
the UN. Dept. of Social Affairs. UNESCO 
maintains contact with various international 
bodies dealing with this subject and advises 
on specific educational problems. UNESCO 
has given special attention to handicapped 
children and the international standard- 
ization of Braille for the blind. UNESCO'S 
Gift Coupon programme includes projects 
for aiding the handicapped. See special 
issue of UNESCO COURIER on blind, March 
1952 as well as April 1952, Nocember- 
December 1956. For other subjects see 
analytical indexes. 
Sir, 
I am writing to say how much I 
enjoyed the January issue. Today 
Edito 
international relations are strained by 
political beliefs on all except cultural 
and sporting levels. This magazine 
helps to create international under- 
standing as well as being interesting in 
itself, 
(Miss) Cosima Bayne

Sir, 
Your. August 1956 issue, “Buddhist 
Art and Culture” (English edition July 
1956) is one of the finest presentations 
of Buddhism that I have ever had the 
pleasure to encounter. The issue is a 
gem. The day Nations begin to extend, 
genuinely, this attitude of Buddhism 
and, apparently, THE UNESCO COURIER, 
instead of threats...,, two-thirds of the 
world's troubles will be on the way out. 
(Miss) Terreden Dickinson 
New York U.S.A. 
Sir, 
Your magazine deserves praise; I be- 
lieve it is very human, and in these 
times the message of Men of Good 
Will. But, frankly, I don't find the ma- 
gazine gay. Don't you think that the 
smile also reflects love and fraternity 
between peoples. Why do you always 
publish grave, tortured faces and take 
life in such an infinitely dramatic 
way 7... I should like to see faces where 
the eyes are lit up despite the injustice 
of men. Mine is only a modest point 
of view compared to your very intelli- 
gent and educated readers, but I think 
you would reach a wider public if your 
magazine relaxed the working man and 
housewife more. 
M. Amand 
Champagne, France 
Sir, 
I sometimes have the impression that 
too much space is given in your pages 
to the countries of the Far East. It 
is true that our knowledge of them is 
too small, but these countries do not 
always have sufficient knowledge of us 
either. I should like to see future is- 
sues devote a regular place to the edu- 
cational systems of the various countries 
of Europe and America. 
L. Cosentini-Frank

Sir, 
I have the greatest pleasure in reading 
THE UNESCO COURIER which keeps 
me in touch with the whole world 
through the work and benevolent genius 
of unesco. My warmest compliments 
and sincerest wishes that this humani- 
tarian work may continue.

FREE TO SUBSCRIBERS 
MAN MEASURES THE UNIVERSE is 
the fourth travelling scientific exhibition 
organized by UNESCO. Inaugurated in 
Paris in 1954, it has been seen so far by 
more than a quarter of a million visitors 
in Oslo, the Hague, Madrid, Ghent, Brussels, 
Liege and Warsaw. The exhibition is now 
touring Poland and is currently on view to 
visitors in Cracow. 
Devoted to the techniques and instru- 
ments used to measure length and distance, 
from the infinitely small to the infinitely 
great, the UNESCO exhibition deals with 
a fundamental subject which is the root not 
only of knowledge but also of scientific 
method. The great [9th century physicist, 
Lord Kelvin, said that “to measure is to 
know”. It is through the introduction of 
measurement into observation and experi- 
ment, that science has, in fact, been able to 
make its most striking advances, and it is 
the measurement of lengths which provides 
the key to all other measurements. 
The exhibition tells the story of the units 
of measurement used in the different orders 
of magnitude: the human scale (metre), 
the microbial (the micron), the virus and 
very large molecules (the millimicron), 
the atomic scale (angstrom), the inter- 
atomic scale, the geographic (kilometre), 
the solar system (astronomic unit), the 
interstellar (light-year) and the inter-galac- 
tic (the parsec). 
The UNESCO COURIER is pleased 
to announce that copies of the UNESCO 
pamphlet “MAN MEASURES THE UNI- 
VERSE” describing the exhibition in detail,
