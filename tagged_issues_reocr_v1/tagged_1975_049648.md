Our photo shows a piece of natural gold, 
remarkable for its shape and size (enlarged

### 49641: Architecture without architects: the timeless art of building in Tunisia, the first of a series of UNESCO studies on traditional architecture in Africa and Asia

ARCHITECTURE 
WITHOUT 
ARCHITECTS 
The timeless art of building 
in Tunisia: the first of a series 
of Unesco studies on traditional 
architecture in Africa and Asia 
VERY part of the world has a, 
form of architecture which is 
rarely mentioned in encyclopaedias or 
scholarly works and which is given 
only marginal treatment in the history 
of building and architecture. And yet 
this traditional or indigenous architec- 
ture as it is.sometimes called, boasts 
an extraordinary wealth of expression, 
that differs widely from country to 
country. 
It is not associated with any archi- 
tects, for the simple reason that archi- 
tects have had nothing to do with it. 
It Is not a product of the drawing- 
WOLF TOCHTERMANN, German architect 
and town-planner (Fed. Rep. of Germany) has 
been in charge of Unesco's programme of 
architecture and the environment in the Dept. 
of Culture since 1969. He is concerned in 
particular with the education of architects and 
town planners and with research Into traditional 
architecture in the context of development,

board, nor does it follow the rules 
and canons laid down and taught by 
art schools and universities, 
It is not only the fruit of ancient 
traditions and the skill of its builder- 
occupiers (for it is essentially “"do-it- 
yourself” building), but in every case 
it mirrors the structure and way of life 
of a specific society. Architecture of 
this kind makes wise and efficient use 
of available local materials, and is 
perfectly adapted to climatic conditions. 
It is only in the last few years—per- 
haps since the famous 1964-65 exhi- 
bition organized by the New York 
Museum of Modern Art on the theme 
"Architecture without Architects™—that 
architects, weary of the "international 
style”, sociologists, ethnologists and 
geographers have come to recognize 
the importance of this hitherto un- 
known, or at least little-known, form 
of architectural expression, 
A white mosque of simple beauty at 
Kairouan, a central Tunisian city 
founded in 670 A.D. Its cupola is 
typical of Islamic religious 
architecture. Elsewhere in Tunisia, such 
cupolas are found only on the 
island of Djerba (see following 
pages) as a characteristic feature 
of traditional architecture in 
village houses and other buildings.

by Wolf Tochtermann 
The few studies previously devoted 
to the subject by a handful of specia- 
lists had had very little influence, and 
some specialists only began to show 
an interest in the conceptual originality 
of this vernacular architecture when 
they became aware of the dangers 
involved in the indiscriminate use of 
an all-purpose style of architecture, 
whose enthusiasts advocated its appli- 
cation in every latitude and climate. 
It has been noted that buildings that 
derive from rural traditions remain 
extraordinarily efficient as dwellings, 
because they are directly related to 
an economy and a way of life still 
very much alive in many rural areas. 
It is far easier to see the relationship 
between environment and habitat in 
these dwellings than In the case of 
the big-city architecture of Western 
countries,

Rhythm of undulating roofs 
The low, flat island of Djerba in the 
Gulf of Gabes (south east Tunisia) 
has many gardens and orchards that 
drink from thousands of wells and 
storage tanks. A diversity of mosques, 
(above and right) spread their admir- 
able architecture and blindingly white 
outlines across its landscape. Vaulted 
roofs give a particular rhythm to 
Djerba’s architecture. Some are 
multi-domed, as on the public baths 
seen at left. Standing among olive 
groves and date palms are 2-storey 
white houses also capped by cupolas. 
The two small rooms are thus well 
protected from heat and cold. The 
layout of the traditional-style house 
is designed above all to maintain the 
intimacy of family life. Ph

pression of these buildings are not 
dictated by a striving for aesthetic 
effects. They are determined by a 
profound though often quite uncon- 
scious understanding of the landscape 
and a judicious use of locally available 
materials. The builder-occupier's con- 
struction reflects his social and cultural 
needs and establishes a balance which, 
however precarious, is nevertheless a 
real one, between his dwelling and the 
natural environment from which he has 
to provide a shelter. 
Yet today, this indigenous architec- 
ture, an expression of the outstand- 
ingly rich cultural heritage of many 
countries in Asia, Africa, Latin Amer- 
ica and Europe, is seriously threaten- 
ed. Over the last few years many 
splendid examples have disappeared 
or are in the process of doing so. 
Since it is basically a rural archi- 
tecture, its disappearance is geared 
directly to the speed of urbanization 
and the depopulation of rural areas, as 
in villages in the valley of Verzasca 
in southern Switzerland and Berber 
villages in the south of Tunisia, among 
many other places, 
In 1973 Unesco launched a number 
of studies on traditional architecture, 
particularly in African countries (Tuni- 
sia, Cameroon, Ghana, Senegal, the 
Central African Republic, the People’s 
Republic of the Congo). Further 
studies are to be carried out in Asia. 
Missions of architects have been 
sent to various countries to carry out 
surveys and prepare photographic and 
written reports. Unesco intends to 
publish all these works in a series 
under the general title of Studies on 
Traditional Forms of Architecture. 
The first study in the series, pre- 
pared by a French architect, Claude 
Perron, is devoted to Tunisia. 
Situated between the Mediterranean 
and the Sahara, Tunisia has been sub- 
jected to a wide variety of outside 
influences, through its maritime links 
with the countries of the Middle East 
and of Europe, and its lines of commu- 
nication with Africa south of the 
Sahara across the formidable yet by 
no means impassable barrier of desert 
wastes. 
Tunisia has also known both the ebb 
and flow of a nomadic population, at 
certain times extending over a large 
part of the country, and the growth of 
settlements in areas with the most 
favourable ‘climatic conditions. The 
impressive variety of Tunisian dwell- 
ing-places is thus largely explained by 
these contrasting ways of life. 
In his study, Claude Perron points 
out that the history of North Africa is 
marked “by the struggle of the noma- 
dic peoples of the steppes and desert 
against the settled populations of the 
wealthy coastal areas and the oases.” 
This struggle has given birth to the 
different types of houses found in 
Tunisia. 
Today, when nomadism is on the 
wane and settlement is more wide- 
spread, the groups of tents that were 
once set out so as to form temporary 
villages have disappeared, although 
the individual tent is still found in 
almost every part of the country. In 
some cases it serves as a kind of 
annexe to the home of a newly-settled 
family. The forms of these family 
dwellings, like all traditional architec- 
ture, in Tunisia and elsewhere, are 
determined by the nature of the local 
terrain and the climate, the nature of 
farming and animal rearing, historical 
events such as occupation and outside 
cultural influences, or sociological 
factors such as the structure of family 
and community life. 
The author of the Tunisian study 
describes many examples of huts 
constructed of branches or reeds, of 
circular houses with conical roofs, of 
square or rectangular houses with 
pointed or flat roofs. Some dwellings 
have attained their purpose to per-

One of southern Tunisia’s most astonishing 
landscapes is in the plain of Matmata which 
runs to the foot of .the heights of Djebel 
Dahar (above and left). People and animals 
come and go across a lunar-like countryside 
dotted with palms... and suddenly vanish as 
if the earth had swallowed them. There is a 
simple explanation. Having no hard and 
durable building materials, the local people 
have dug out homes (up to 50 metres long) 
in the soft alluvial soil. Craters criss-crossing 
the countryside are in fact patios around 
which the rooms of the underground houses 
are set. Round or square, and up to 8 metres 
deep, the patios are reached via tunnels along 
which stables for animals have been exca- 
vated. Cooking is done in the patio while 
the rooms around it, white-washed and 
shaped like the hull of a boat turned upside 
down, are used as living quarters, store- 
houses or workshops. When the ground. is 
suitable, houses also have a granary, with 
access through a hole at ground level by means 
of a rope or ladder of branches. These houses, 
with their many amenities, cool in summer 
and warm in winter, are still made by their 
inhabitants. Communities of cattle breeders 
and shepherds in the nearby mountains have 
a different kind of architecture. Right, the 
village of Toujane with its houses built of 
stones from the rocky soil.

fection: various family-sized defensive 
structures and highly functional dwell- 
ings such as the “menzels” on the 
island of Djerba. Among the wide 
variety of materials used are fabrics, 
wood, matting of reeds and straw 
and other materials derived from 
plants, bricks of mud and earth and 
unmortared stone. 
The study examines not only indivi- 
dual buildings, but offers examples of 
groups of dwellings set in compounds 
or of villages each with installations 
appropriate to their needs. In almost 
every case the author shows that the 
forms of traditional architecture are 
not an accidental choice but on the 
contrary are the logical answer to 
certain specific needs, which can vary 
from one region to another. 
Why then is Unesco carrying out 
these studies? They might quite justi- 
fiably have been undertaken to pre- 
pare for later work of preservation. 
They might too have been considered 
worthwhile from the viewpoint of 
10

oF 4 . ” » > »i 
historical documentation. However, 
Unesco’'s reasons for carrying out 
these studies were quite different. 
The world's population is likely to 
double within the next thirty years if 
the present rate of growth continues, 
in which case additional housing will 
need to be provided for 3 to 3.5 billion 
persons. Since urban expansion is 
far outpacing that of rural communities, 
new technologies will have to be used 
in order to meet this unprecedented 
demand for housing more efficiently 
and economically. 
However, the building techniques 
habitually used in Western style archi- 
tecture often call for materials which 
are difficult to obtain in the developing 
countries, and are therefore beyond 
these countries’ economic means. 
Moreover, such materials are rarely 
suited to the specific climatic, social 
and cultural conditions in these 
countries. 
In future, therefore, there can be 
no question of despising cheap build-

ing materials such as clay bricks, 
moulded clay or bamboo. Nor is 
there any reason to consider traditional 
building materials as a mark of under- 
development. 
On the contrary, the merits of tradi- 
tional architecture must be made clear 
to architects, urban planners and 
government officials in order to pro- 
mote the rise of an architecture that 
is not merely an imitation of Western 
industrial construction. In the same 
context, traditional architecture should 
occupy an important place in the pro- 
grammes of architectural colleges in 
the developing countries. The ren- 
aissance of this type of architecture 
would also prevent the appearance of 
shanty-towns and other blights of 
urban housing. 
It is with such needs in mind that 
Unesco has launched its studies on 
traditional architecture in different 
parts of the world.

The citadel 
granaries 
The unusual structures shown here are 
“ghorfas” (granaries) once used as store- 
houses for grain, oil and other produce 
by the semi-nomadic peoples of southern 
Tunisia—farmers or shepherds according 
to the season. Left in the care of a few 
guardians for part of the year, ghorfas were 
often built on rocky mountain spurs and 
grouped defensively to form a “ksar” (the 
Arabic word for fortress or citadel). Tiers 
of ghorfas top the hill at Chenini (photo 
left) and below them homes have been 
hollowed out in softer ground. These par- 
ticular dwellings blend into and even accen- 
tuate the natural outlines of their setting. 
Fortified granaries are also found in the 
plains of southern Tunisia as at Medenine 
(below). They consist of small rectangular 
cells with barrel vaults on which an identical 
unitis often superimposed (right). Designed 
for the needs of a semi-nomad way of life, 
each cell held the food reserve for a single 
family, during whose absence the entrance 
was walled up. Buildings of great stylistic 
beauty, the storehouses are mostly aban- 
doned nowadays although groups of them 
have been converted into hotels.

Nomad 
homes 
and 
oasis 
cities   
The nomad builds his dwelling with the produce of his flocks—sheep’s woo! and goat or dromedary 
hair woven into long strips and sewn together into a large rectangle. With a few pieces of wood as 
tent pegs and brushwood to make it draught-proof around the bottom, this mobile dwelling is quickly 
erected and just as quickly taken down. It is easily transported by dromedary or donkey along with the 
household utensils and the handsome carpets woven by womenfolk. Above, a traditional Tunisian tent 
pitched with its entrance facing Mecca. In harmony with the landscape and solidly anchored to the 
ground, the tent shown here is a habitat that serves its purpose to perfection. After crossing vast 
windswept desert wastes, a traveller experiences a feeling of relief on reaching the oases of the Djerid 
region of southern Tunisia. Below, a street in one of these oases, at Tozeur (12,000 inhabitants) whose 
large houses are faced with straw coloured bricks. Openings of ventilation shafts for drying dates 
—Tozeur’s main product—are seen at top of photo. Right, aerial view of Thysdrus, an ancient Roman 
city lying between Sousse and Sfax, and today called El Djem. Its enormous third century amphitheatre, 
which could accommodate 60,000 persons, dominates the present city’s typically Tunisian buildings. .

by Pierre Kalfon 
INETEEN fifty-three. Senegal 
is still a French colony. In the 
village square at Badiana, deep in the 
bush of the Casamance region, a man 
addresses the villagers. 
He speaks of the need to learn to 
read and write, to observe simple rules 
of hygiene in order to prevent disease; 
he explains that green manuring yields 
more rice, that animals should be 
vaccinated and that infant mortality is 
not inevitable. He tells the villagers 
not to be ashamed of Africa's past. 
He speaks of dignity and hope... 
If the assembled villagers listened 
so intently, it was not only because 
they were fascinated by. his words. 
It was because this time it was a black 
African, and not a Frenchman from the 
town, speaking to them about them- 
selves in clear and simple terms. This 
Senegalese, a graduate from the Sor- 
bonne, was a school teacher of a new 
kind. His name was Amadou Mahtar 
PIERRE KALFON, French teacher and jour- 
nalist, has lived for many years in Latin Ame- 
rica, where between 1968 and 1973 he taught 
French language and literature at the University 
of Chile, Santiago, and was also correspondent 
of the French daily “Le Monde * and the weekly 
" Le Nouvel Observateur “, Author of an essay,

M'Bow. On November 14, 1974, he was 
elected Director-General of Unesco 
by the representatives of 135 
countries assembled in Paris. He 
had jumped a century. 
Shortly after he was born in Dakar, 
in 1921, his parents took him back to 
Louga in the Sahel, where the rest 
of the family lived, the extended 
African family of uncles, aunts, grand- 
parents and cousins. There he grew 
up, “learned about life”, had brothers 
and sisters to whom he was the elder 
brother and, above all, first learned 
from practical experience and later 
from books, as Jean-Jacques Rous- 
seau once proposed. Louga was at 
that time a small rural community 
with a population of hardly more than 
5,000, situated at the cross-roads of 
the Wolof, Peul, Toucouleu and 
Berber settlements of Senegal. 
His father, who came from a village 
near the coastal town of St. Louis, was, 
like many other villagers, an artisan and 
farmer. He worked hide and made 
leather goods, cultivated his field, and 
kept a few sheep, cattle and horses. 
A devout and highly esteemed Moslem 
who read the Koran and strictly 
observed the fast of Ramadan, he 
was respected as much for his moral 
uprightness as for his imposing 
physical stature. Visiting Senegalese 
political leaders always stayed at his 
house, and as a prominent local 
figure, he had been a member of the 
Senegalese delegation invited to 
Paris for the Universal Exhibition in 
1900. 
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow spent his 
childhood and adolescence in a pro- 
tected yet liberal atmosphere: he 
played to his heart's content with the 
other "children of his age to the 
rhythm of Wolof fable-songs, ab- 
sorbing his cultural heritage in this 
way: he listened spellbound to the 
legends and tales of marvellous hap- 
penings whose animal characters 
parodied man, his faults and his 
qualities. 
He was brought up in the time- 
honoured way by his mother and 
aunts, until the age of seven or eight, 
when the responsibility for his edu- 
cation fell to his father and mat- 
ernal uncle who initiated him in crafts 
and farming skills, taught him to raise 
animals, build huts, repair tools and, 
above all, to discover and to love 
nature. 
“I knew the names of all the plants 
and how to recognize those that 
healed ‘and those that killed”, he 
says, “and even here in Paris, | often

make herbal tea from African plants 
which are sent to me.” In fact, 
years later his knowledge of agricul- 
ture was to astonish many an 
agronomist. 
The only constraint he knew was 
the systematic memory-training, from 
the age of five, which consisted of 
learning by heart and reciting verses 
from the Moslem Holy Book at the 
Koranic School. “It is a school of 
humility”, he wrote. “Whatever his 
status or background, the pupil must 
be prepared to render such services 
as fetching wood and water, working 
the land or seeking donations for his 
teacher...” 
Between 1928 and 1930, a terrible 
drought hit the Sahel, like the one of 
recent years, in which thousands died 
from starvation. But without radio or 
television, this appalling situation went 
unnoticed in the Western world. 
Even as an adult, Amadou Mahtar 
M'Bow was never to forget what he 
had seen as a boy. He still talks 
about it: “As a child, | lived with 
hunger. | saw men and women die 
for lack of food. For me hunger is no 
rhetorical expression; one must have 
lived through it to understand its 
horror.” 
One day, when he was nearly nine, 
 
“on a morning in November 1929, | was 
taken by my father, who did not know 
a word of French, to the French 
regional school at Louga.” Wearing 
his long African boubou (he did not 
exchange it for European dress until 
he was seventeen), Amadou Mahtar 
M'Bow spoke only Wolof like most 
Senegalese. He also knew Pula—the 
language of the Peul people—which 
he picked up from his grandmother, 
One wonders whether this is where 
he became interested in history. Did 
he learn it from a typical French 
history textbook of the time which 
always began, “Our ancestors, the 
Gauls..."? One thing is certain. 
Within his own family, his father and 
uncles took it upon themselves to 
teach him another history, in the oral 
tradition, of the feats of his ancestors. 
Louga, where his family lived, had 
been part of the ancient kingdom of 
Cayor where resistance against col- 
onial penetration had been at its 
strongest in the 19th century. 
Mr. M'Bow himself has stressed the 
vital importance of this aspect of his 
upbringing, and it explains his later 
deep-rooted need to affirm his identity 
as an African. “Many of us were 
brought up on tales which were a far 
cry from what was taught in the col- 
onial or mission schools.”

At fourteen, he was awarded his 
certificate of primary studies, no mean 
feat considering that nine out of ten 
African children dropped out of primary 
school. Told that he was too old to 
enter secondary school, he changed 
to a higher primary school, took a 
commercial course and got a job as 
a clerk in the Governor of Dakar's 
office. He was already organizing 
a youth movement. 
Then came World War Il. He was 
eighteen, thirsty for knowledge and 
eager to fight oppression, He joined 
the French Army as a volunteer, “I 
felt | had a duty to accomplish as a free 
man”, he says. He embarked for 
France, where he later witnessed the 
horrors of war. He does not like to 
talk about this period of his life: 
“I am not a pacifist at any price”, he 
says, “but to me war is utterly absurd. 
The next one will mean the end of 
mankind.” 
After the debacle of 1940, he 
returned to Senegal until the Allied 
Forces landed in North Africa, in 
November 1942, when he again joined 
the French Forces and was assigned 
to the Air Force school at Agadir, in 
Morocco. He left there at the top of 
his class, and a specialist in electrical 
aviation equipment. At the time, he

It was during this post-war period 
that Africans were discovering Aimé

coined the word “négritude” and 
brandished it like a flag, long before 
American blacks proclaimed “black is 
beautiful”. At that time, the poet 
. Léopold Sédar Senghor, Senegal's 
future head of state, was the most 
listened-to apostle of négritude. Jean- 
Paul Sartre was writing a brilliant 
preface to Senghor's “Anthology of 
Black and Malagasy Poetry”. Another 
Senegalese, Alioune Diop, was de- 
fending Pan-Africanism in the magazine 
Présence Africaine...

But for an African living abroad, in" 
France, there were then three pri- 
orities crying for action: first, to 
rediscover Africa's true identity, 
second to rescue Africa's past from 
colonial disdain, third to proclaim the 
rich cultural heritage of the African 
people. 
Senegal was sorely in need of 
technicians but it was even more in 
need of people to awaken the African 
conscience. 
So, Mahtar M'Bow decided to return 
to his own cultural roots, though not 
empty-handed and not unprepared. 
Rather than become an engineer- 
technocrat, he chose as a Senegalese, 
to become an African geographer and 
historian. After taking his Bacca- 
laureat at the age of 26, he entered 
the Sorbonne. “There | learnt rigour 
and method”, he says, speaking of his 
Marxist and non-Marxist mentors. 
He quickly established himself in the

Paris, and in 1950, President then 
Secretary-General of the Federation 
of Black African Students in France. 
This organization was to be the well- 
spring from which emerged the future 
“intelligentsia” of all French-speaking 
Africa. It was here that Mr. M'Bow 
discovered the complex realities of 
pressure groups and French political 
and trade union movements. 
Contrary to what sometimes hap- 
pens, his militancy stimulated his 
academic work. He quickly obtained 
his licence degree, and even found 
time to marry a geography student, 
Raymonde, whom he met at the Sor- 
bonne. She was a Haitian, tall and 
beautiful, a diplomat's daughter, and 
a descendant of the African slaves 
shipped to the Americas centuries ago. 
Their marriage was the beginning of 
a long and rewarding association: joint 
publication of many works, and a close 
family life, with three children. 
When he left university, M'Bow was 
offered a teaching job in France. He 
refused and asked to return to his own 
country. But because of his political 
views, the authorities of French West 
Africa preferred to keep him away 
from the major centres. He was 
appointed to the secondary school at 
Rosso, a small isolated town in Mauri- 
tania, then a part of French West

event.” 
- This_“event” was to last two years. 
A singular spark fired the lessons of 
this young teacher, but his pupils were 
not aware that it came from a man 
rediscovering himself. 
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow did not 
remain unnoticed in isolated Rosso for 
very long. At that time, Unesco's 
Director-General, Jaime Torres Bodet, 
had proposed the setting up by Unesco 
member countries of “fundamental 
education programmes” to combat 
illiteracy. The Rectorate of Dakar 
called on Mr. M'Bow, because of his 
experience as a teacher and also as 
It was quite an 
. a Senegalese, to head a new depart- 
ment of fundamental education for the 
whole of Senegal. 
Then began a unique period in the 
life of Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, “no 
doubt the most inspiring and instruc- 
tive of my whole career”, he says. 
This was a far cry from the quiet 
sinecure of a civil servant sitting 
behind his desk. For five exciting 
years, from 1953 to 1957, accompanied 
by a small team of African doctors, 
veterinary personnel, student teachers, 
farming specialists, radio and cinema 
technicians, and sometimes even a car- 
penter and a mason, he travelled by 
truck throughout the country. 
He ate from the calabash pot with 
the villagers, whose life he shared for 
two or three months at a time. He 
acquired a unique and detailed know- 
ledge of daily life in the villages of 
Senegal. Under his direction, schools 
were built, health centres opened, 
midwives and nurses trained, agricul- 
tural co-operatives installed, chemical 
fertilizers introduced. Everywhere he 
strove to alleviate ignorance, disease 
and misery, the afflictions of what was 
"already beginning to be called under- 
development. 
The villagers were illiterate. But 
“dignity comes through leaming”. The 
history teacher became a simple pri- 
mary school teacher. Using French 
and local dialect, he devised a 
reading and writing method specially 
adapted to his classes. His pupils, 
of both sexes, were ‘aged from 6 to 
60. “In Badiana, for the first time, a 
literacy campaign included both men 
and women. The villagers helped to 
finish the ideographic alphabet: it 
was stencilled and roneoed... Tha 
simplicity of the method gave them 
confidence. Those who had learned

po read well were loudly applauded. 
Evening sessions sometimes went on 
far into the night.. 
It is revealing to read the reports 
written by Mr. M’'Bow, Chief of Mission, 
after expeditions to places such as 
Badiana, Dembakane, Senoudébou, 
Mangaroungou, or Gaya... The fifty 
close-written pages are not only a 
sociological study of life in a Sene- 
galese village twenty years ago, but 
also, despite the deliberately im- 
personal style, an adventure story of 
a handful of men working together to 
bring African villagers into the modern 
world, 
Between missions, however, Mahtar 
M'Bow found time to participate 
actively in the political life of his 
country. His name became known as 
that of an opposition leader whose 
views commanded respect. First he 
was a member of an independent group 
of intellectuals which, in 1955, united 
with the Democratic Coalition, led by 
Léopold Senghor, to later form, with 
the Senegalese Union for Progress, 
the Senegalese People’s Coalition. 
In 1957, France beaan its decol- 
onization process and installed Sene- 
gal's first semi-autonomous govern- 
ment. Mr. M'Bow was appointed the 
first Minister of Education and Culture. 
Once again, he travelled through the 
bush, built additional schools and set 
up the first post primary classes, so 
that more children could go on to 
secondary education. 
In 1958, General de Gaulle, on 
assuming power, asked the French 
African territories if they would 
agree to form a Community linked to 
France. Some said “Yes”. Others, 
with M'Bow, replied “No”, and called 
for immediate independence. When 
the views of the former prevailed, 
M’ Bow, who had resigned to fight his 
campaign, returned to secondary 
teaching, with his wife, at St. Louis, in 
Senegal, at the same Lycée Faidherbe 
which had turned him down as a pupil. 
This time, it was as an influential 
opposition leader in the African Re- 
groupment Movement that he patiently 
took up the struggle again. His pro- 
gressive nationalism won him esteem 
abroad, especially when Senegal 
finally gained independence in 1960. 
He travelled a lot, made many 
contacts, published several books 
aimed at making Africa better known 
to the world at large and also school 
textbooks designed to impress on 
African children the richness and 
diversity of their continent. But he 
remained a teacher at heart. 
The new Africa needed highly quali- 
fied personnel. In many countries, 
Unesco launched the idea of teacher 
18 
training colleges to train such person- 
nel, and M'Bow was called on to teach 
in one of these colleges in Dakar. 
In 1966, Senegal's economy de- 
pended on one crop, the ground-nut. 
An economic crisis loomed; the huge 
port of Dakar stood empty. President 
Senghor asked the opposition to 
collaborate with him. It accepted, 
hoping to implement its own proposed 
reforms from the inside. ~ 
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow once again 
became Minister of Education and with 
Léopold Senghor's accord began the 
“Africanization” of the university. He 
himself presided over the commission 
which drew up the first Senegalese 
alphabet based on the phonetic tran- 
scription of the six Senegalese 
languages, including Wolof. From 
then on the teacher and the political 
leader in M’'Bow were to become one. 
When the 1968 wave of student 
revolt in the world hit Dakar, M'Bow 
tried to avoid a head-on confrontation 
and succeeded in keeping the dis- 
cussion open with the student body 
whose motives he fully understood. 
Following this he was made Minister 
of Youth and Culture, a post he held 
until 1970, when in a cabinet reshuffle 
he again left the Government. 
Y that time he had come to be 
known as “elder brother” by 
many of his fellow Africans. In 1966 
and again in 1968 he headed the 
Senegal Delegations to two Unesco 
General Conferences. Since 1966 he 
had been a member of Unesco’s 
Executive Board. He also became 
chairman of the African group of 
Unesco's Member States and of the 
group of 77 countries representing the 
Third World. 
In November 1970, Unesco’s Direc- 
tor-General, René Maheu, offered him 
the key post of Assistant Director- 
General in charge of Education. 
This post, calling for administrative 
and diplomatic qualities, permitted 
Mr. M'Bow to gain a detailed know- 
ledge of the educational developments 
in every part of the world. 
At Unesco’s Paris headquarters and 
“in the field”, M'Bow's tall, well-built 
figure soon became a familiar sight. 
He was known for his frank, open 
manner, his simple and direct method 
of speaking. Possessed of a phenom- 
enal memory, he spoke with an 
assurance that comes from knowing 
every detail of a project. He came to 
be recognized as the man who 
preferred to settle questions rapidly by 
direct personal contact rather than 
through red tape or lengthy bureau- 
cratic procedures. 
He owes to his African village back- 
ground and long experience a feeling 
for conciliation invaluable for solving 
harmoniously the thorniest problems. 
“We have never seen him lose his 
temper”, say his colleagues, “but while 
he readily shows confidence in others, 
woe betide anyone who lets him 
down.” 
Now a vigorous 53, with a capacity 
for work that astonishes everyone, 
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow has no illusions 
about the job ahead. He knows. it 
will be tough, but he also knows 
how much Unesco can do to help 
countries free themselves from ignor- 
ance and poverty. Knowing Unesco 
well and believing wholeheartedly in 
its objectives, he intends to infuse it 
with fresh vigour and give it a new style. 
“| should be delighted indeed to 
listen—as we do under the baobab 
tree in Africa—to all points of view and 
to find a solution acceptable to all...”, 
he says. “| am a little wary of a 
universalistic humanism which often 
masks Eurocentrism. | prefer plural- 
ism, which accepts the distinctive 
identity of each people. | was brought 
up to accept differences in a spirit of 
tolerance. | am the brother of every 
human being, whatever his or her race, 
whatever his or her belief, and 
wherever he or she may live. This is 
the first stepping stone for building 
true solidarity between all peoples. 
With René Maheu, Unesco's former 
Director-General, a whole generation 
of the early pioneers of the Organ- 
ization is disappearing. They were 
dedicated men and women who often 
came from the Western world. With 
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, a black 
African who stands at the cross-roads 
of several civilizations and rejects 
neither his past under a colonial 
regime nor his European university 
background, a new generation of men 
and women is emerging in the train 
no doubt of the present acceleration 
of history. 
The path that led the country boy 
from the African Sahel to head one 
of the most important organizations of 
the United Nations system perhaps 
marks a turning point in the emergence 
of this other world, long oppressed, 
despised or disregarded—the world of 
the disinherited peoples. “I feel that 
| am today the symbol of these 
peoples”, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow said 
on taking office, on November 15, 1974. 
In choosing him as Director-General 
for six years, Unesco has entered the 
21st century.

An age of solidarity 
Or 
An age of barbarism? 
by Amadou Mahtar MI'Bow 
Director-General of Unesco 
INCE each of us is marked by the age in which 
he lives, by the environment into which he was 
born and in which he grew up and by the experience 
which he has accumulated, it is first of all in the spirit 
of the African people, and in their wisdom, that | shall 
find guidance for my actions. 
When | speak of the people of Africa, this is not 
some abstract image, but a reality which | have exper- 
ienced and in which | have fully shared. My presence 
at the head of this Organization is merely the conse- 
quence of the profound changes which have taken 
place in that vast continent since the present century 
began. 
Yes, | grew up with Africa, suffering its pains, feeling 
its anguish, sharing its aspirations. The lesson | learned 
there was the lesson of determination to root oneself 
in the traditional environment; in accepting the funda- 
mental values of that environment, we accepted our 
responsibilities as free beings in a dominated society, 
for what we had to preserve was freedom of the spirit, 
in which lies the true meaning of dignity. We never felt 
hatred in our hearts, even in times of conflict, because 
we never lost hope in mankind... 
The inevitable choice facing mankind is between 
entering an age of solidarity or relapsing into an age 
of barbarism. Solidarity means firstly the acceptance 
of differences, whether they are biological in origin 
or the product of geography and history. It means 
the renunciation of all notions of hierarchy among peo- 
ples and nations. It means the abandonment, once and 
for all, of the view of history long held by those who, 
from Ancient Greece and Rome down to the age of 
modern imperialisms, have always confused civilization 
with power, reducing to the status of “barbarians” the 
subjugated peoples as well as those who rejected their 
yoke, 
But solidarity means something more. It calls for 
an effort to rise above our differences in order to 
build, on a world-wide scale, a new economic, social 
and cultural order which, transcending national self-in- 
terests, will enable man to organize his environment 
rationally, so that each of us may live there freely and 
happily, in brotherhood with his neighbours, whoever 
they may be. 
It is to be feared that the only alternative is barbarism, 
for the balance of terror and the rising tide of inequal- 
ities may lead to those final confrontations after which 
nothing will remain but ruin and desolation: the destruc- >   19

2 tion of all that human genius has helped to create over 
SO many centuries, 
Even if peace were assured, failure to make wise 
use of the power conferred on us by science would 
pose no less a threat. Man's capacity to calculate and 
to inquire has today expanded to the point at which 
he is able to study both the infinitely small and the 
infinitely great. Whether he penetrates the mysteries 
of genetics or escapes from gravity to explore outer 
space, whether he pursues the study of the microcosm, 
dividing particles which only yesterday seemed indivi- 
sible, or sets out in conquest of the universe, man 
indeed appears to stand on the threshold of a new 
age, as if the combined fruits of two centuries of scien- 
tific progress were on the point of freeing him from all 
his bonds. 
But were science to be diverted from its highest 
goal and placed at the service of evil, it too might well 
imperil mankind's very existence, or at any rate enslave 
humanity in new forms of bondage, worse perhaps than 
any which it has known throughout its history. 
It 1s true that scholars and scientists in many countries 
are—each face to face with his own conscience—reflec- 
ting on the true meaning of their work and on the final 
aims of science. Unesco cannot stand aside from 
this debate, any more than it can remain indifferent 
to whatever bears on the progress and the destiny of 
mankind. 
its responsibility is all the greater since no organiza- 
tion is better placed to mobilize the intellectual resour- 
ces which both reflection and action demand. The 
ambition of its new Director-General is to stimulate a 
vast movement in which scholars from all horizons and 
all disciplines may participate in a joint, world-wide 
effort of meditation on the problems of the evolution 
of our civilizations. 
Since its foundation in 1946, Unesco has followed 
a long and difficult path, facing countless problems 
and passing through a number of world political crises 
with their tensions and confrontations. Today its Mem- 
ber States, all its Member States, must endeavour to 
understand that Unesco can carry out its mission only 
in an atmosphere of serenity, and frank and patient 
dialogue. : 
In the period of unprecedentedly rapid change through 
which the world is passing, Unesco must constantly 
review its objectives and its methods, in order to meet 
the imperatives of new situations. In many spheres, this 
sustained effort of renewal and adjustment has made it 
possible to deepen and broaden a programme of action 
for which, by reason of its universality, there is still no 
substitute in the modern world. 
Admired by some, criticized by others, at times misun- 
derstood, Unesco exists because of the part taken in 
its work by its 135 Member States, whose participation 
bears witness to the faith and hope that mankind as a 
whole places in it. So a heavy responsibility is invol- 
ved in everything connected with the preparation and 
execution of Unesco's programme, which demand an 
unremitting effort of self-criticism, evaluation of the 
results achieved, and an open-minded, imaginative out- 
look on the future. 
Ethical action, the promotion of knowledge, with all 
the exchanges it involves, and aid for development, 
cannot be considered in isolation from one another 
without a risk of divesting Unesco of one of the reasons 
for its existence. 
While ethical objectives reflect the Organization's 
loyalty to one of its foremost tasks, which is to lay 
down universal standards applicable to all because 
they are freely accepted by all, the promotion and dis- 
semination of knowledge represent the prime source of 
progress. 
But human destiny cannot be dissociated either from 
the development of society—of all societies; there 
is no society in the world today which is not in some 
way having to face development problems. Special 
attention must certainly be given to the needs of the 
most seriously deprived peoples. 
It is shocking and unjust that hundreds of millions 
of human beings are suffering the humiliations of disease, 
illiteracy and hunger, and are thus being deprived of 
what is indispensable to human dignity, when one thinks 
of the colossal waste which is a feature of certain 
societies. 
If it is not to fail in its mission, Unesco must do more, 
and do it more effectively, to help the underprivileged. 
And so we must make a determined effort to modernize 
our methods for planning and carrying out all our acti- 
vities. . . 
Each period of history has its underlying trends, its 
lines of force, marking its significance and its distinc- 
tive character. Today more than ever, an organiza- 
tion such as Unesco cannot afford to trail world events; 
it must resolutely take its proper place in the vanguard 
of the double movement of emancipation and unification 
of peoples which is the outstanding feature of our time. 
| wish to address an appeal to Unesco's Member 
States, and, through them, to all men and women in 
every country of the world, to redouble their efforts to 
encourage all those for whom the happiness and well- 
being of others are more than empty words to rally 
to Unesco in a great movement of universal solidarity. 
Forum for the global exchange of ideas and fraternal 
association of peoples, Unesco must continue to be the 
ultimate hope for peace and understanding, in a world 
which now, for better or worse, possesses tremendous 
technical powers. 
The task before us is to see to it that each day the 
meaning of justice and truth is more clearly perceived, 
to combat all that abases man physically and intellec- 
tually—poverty, ignorance and inequalities and cons- 
traints in all their forms—and to free him from the 
often overwhelming pressures of exploitation, alienation 
and mechanization which tend to reduce him to the status 
of an object. 
If the goal at times seems far distant and our quest 
an arduous one, it is because the true achievement 
of our purpose would mean nothing less than an ethical 
revolution through which all mankind may be assured of 
full development. | remain convinced—and this convic- 
tion will underlie all my work in the service of Unesco, 
in the years ahead, and be an unfailing source of hope 
and energy—that hatred and misunderstanding can be 
overcome in the unity which is forged when ideals 
freely accepted by all are finally put into practice, and 
that man will one day succeed, as we read in the 
Vedas, in “overcoming hatred by love, and falsehood 
by truth...” un

### 49645: A Greater need than ever for tolerance and understanding

= 
A greater need 
than ever 
for tolerance 
and understanding 
E do not live in an 
ideal world and it 
would be vain to seek to idealize 
it. That the world is often torn by 
political, economic and social con- 
flicts is the patent reality of today. 
But this reality forces us—with- 
out denying any of the contra- 
dictions of our times and without 
giving up truth and justice as the 
basis for our action—to seek to 
rise above the tensions and con- 
flicts of today if we genuinely wish 
to act in conformity with the prin- 
ciples of our Constitution. 
| wish to make another urgent 
appeal for tolerance and under- 
standing. In the future we should 
try, even if at first it seems impos- 
sible to do so, to achieve through 
patient dialogue the consensus 
which should be the golden rule 
in an institution such as this. 
Admittedly, this calls for quiet, 
patient and unflagging efforts and 
for mutual concessions. It is by 
this means that the moral autho- 
rity of our Organization can be 
strengthened. | am firmly resolved 
to speak out on important inter- 
national questions each time and 
whenever | deem it necessary in 
order to reconcile conflicting 
points of view and in order to 
reach the broadest possible 
agreement. 
One thing strikes me immedia- 
tely: the importance that the Gen- 
eral Conference as a whole has 
given to Unesco's ethical action, 
particularly its efforts to contri- 
bute (in its fields of competence) 
to the effective application of hu- 
man rights, the maintenance of 
peace and the development of 
understanding among peoples. 
Unesco's action for peace must 
be pursued on two fronts : first, 
against all forms of oppression 
and discrimination which endanger 
peace and international security 
and are a denial of human dignity; 
and second, support for the forces 
of progress, freedom, justice and 
mutual respect among nations. 
In this respect the General Con- 
ference has repeatedly stressed 
that justice is directly linked with 
the concept of social progress 
and that equity must govern rela- 
tions between both individuals and 
nations. 
With these imperatives in mind, 
Unesco will do its utmost, during 
the next two years, to ensure that 
the combined resources of res- 
earch, education and communi- 
cation make a more effective con- 
tribution to promoting the right to 
education, science and culture. 
As the United Nations agency 
pledged to uphold the highest in- 
tellectual and spiritual values, 
Unesco will also see to it that this 
vigorous and sustained effort 
extends beyond its own spheres 
of competence to embrace the 
whole range of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
Unesco’s determination to com- 
bat the inequalities which deprive 
vast numbers of the world's people 
of the right to education has been 
the guiding principle for plan- 
ning many of Unesco's activities 
in education. Although Unesco 
can contribute only indirectly to- 
wards removing the social bar- 
riers which many delegations 
have denounced as a major cause 
of the inequalities in education, 
through its programme for equal 
access to education it is directly 
attacking specific forms of discri- 
mination against women and girls 
(who make up half of humanity), 
migrant workers and their fami- 4 
  
  
1975 
INTERNATIONAL 
WOMEN’S 
YEAR 
Designated as International Women’s 
Year by the United Nations General 
Assembly, 1975 will mark a turning 
point in the struggle to end 
discrimination against women. The 
United Nations has established three 
themes for International Women's 
Year: 
— the promotion of equality between 
men and women; 
— the integration of women into 
development; 
— recognition of women’s increasing 
contribution to strengthening world 
peace. 
Unesco’s contribution to the 
achievement of United Nations 
objectives for International Women's 
Year will include the following 
activities: 
Education 
  
HM International meeting, in 1976 
(in co-operation with the International 
Labour Organization) on educational 
and vocational guidance and job 
opportunities open to women. It will 
study ways of integrating women 
into economic, social and cultural 
development and of promoting equal 
access to education. 
M Study on working mothers and on 
solutions adopted in different 
countries to problems of educating 
pre-school-age children. 
HB Meeting of women holding major 
posts in Unesco Member States on 
the theme '* Exchange and co-operation 
between women in different countries”. 
HM Inquiry into recent steps taken by 
governments in different parts of the 
world for the advancement of women 
in such fields as education, 
employment, social welfare, family 
planning, legal status, etc. 
MW Two major programmes to develop 
women’s technical education in rural 
areas, in the Central African Republic 
and Mauritania. 
HM Promotion of equal access for 
women to all literacy programmes. 
Social sciences 
  
WM Research on the changing role of 
men and women in family and 
community life. 
NM Study on the image of women 
presented in school text-books. 
MH Study on how women can contribute 
to the strengthening of peace. 
Information 
  
M Study on the effectiveness of mass 
communications (radio, television, 
etc.) in the education of women.

EDUCATION 
Educational Innovations 
 
H A global reporting service on 
current innovations in education to 
be set up as part of Unesco’s 
International Bureau of Education. 
Unesco will maintain an updated 
computerized directory of educational 
studies and research. By the end of 
1976. the International Bureau of 
Education will operate as an educa- 
tional data bank on a world scale. 
H A comparative study to analyse 
and evaluate educational theories of 
the 20th century. 
HM Studies on new methods for the 
education of nomad peoples and 
children of migrant workers and on 
the most effective ways of teaching 
the physically handicapped. 
HM International Conference in Geneva, 
in September 1975, on the changing 
role of the teacher and its 
implications for new approaches to 
teacher training. 
New strategies for the 
struggle against illiteracy 
Hl Mobile teams to be formed for 
training literacy teachers in Africa 
and Asia. 
HM Expansion of activities by regional 
functional literacy centres in rural 
areas of Latin America and the 
Arab States. 
Combating discrimination 
in education 
 
BH World-wide Unesco inquiry into 
new ways of combating 
discrimination and ensuring equality 
of opportunity and treatment in 
education. 
EH A wide-ranging inquiry into 
obstacles to the achievement of the 
right to education for all. 
Development of education 
 
Focal points of international 
co-operation: 
Mm Conference of African Ministers of 
Education, in 1976, on the 
development and renovation of 
education systems at national and 
regional level. 
HM Meeting of Latin American and 
Caribbean Member States, in 1976, 
on the same questions. 
HM Regional meeting to prepare Fourth 
Conference of Ministers of Education 
of Arab States. 
HM Seminar on the development of 
out-of-school education in Africa. 
Hl Conference of representatives of 
education ministries of the 25 least 
developed countries to study new 
ways of promoting educational 
progress in these countries.   
2 lies, refugees, and people strug- 
gling for their independence. 
In addition, there are other 
Unesco activities which can be 
said to fall into this same cate- 
gory, aimed at removing obstacles 
or changing conditions which 
hamper equal access to education 
for all. These include educational 
programmes for rural develop- 
ment and literacy and adult edu- 
cation programmes, all of which 
have been given priority status 
by Unesco's General Conference. 
In many countries, the econo- 
mic and social inequalities that 
exist between urban and rural 
areas are tantamount to discrimi- 
nation in education for millions of 
rural children and young people. 
In the years ahead, therefore, we 
must step up our efforts in edu- 
cation for rural development. 
Because it is so widespread 
and has such profoundly negative 
effects on the development of the 
individual and the community, 
illiteracy remains one of the ma- 
jor evils of the twentieth cen- 
tury. Its persistence—its actual 
increase, when reckoned in abso- 
lute figures—makes it one of the 
most formidable challenges that 
the international community must 
take up if the future of mankind is 
not to be seriously compromised. 
If Unesco's action in this res- 
pect has perhaps not yet been as 
fully effective as one could wish, 
this is mainly because the prime 
factor in attacking this problem is 
national determination, since only 
governments are able to bring 
about the kind of total mobiliz- 
ation of a country’s resources 
without which literacy campaigns 
are doomed to failure. 
Adult education too is a power- 
ful force in the democratization of 
education, and one of the main 
links in lifelong education. It is for 
these reasons that the General 
Conference has asked that Unes- 
co's activities aimed at correcting 
the imbalance found in many edu- 
cation systems should be con- 
tinued and intensified, in line with 
the recommendations of the Third 
International Conference on Adult 
Education, held in Tokyo, since 
this imbalance is detrimental to 
adult education which has its own 
objectives, content and methods. 
In recent years, the idea of life- 
long education has become one 
of the key-features of Unesco's 
programme... | think it will be pos- 
sible to free the concept of life- 
long education both from the un- 
duly restrictive definitions some 
people have tended to give it and 
from the equally dangerous risk 
of vagueness which all too often 
deprives general concepts of any 
real content, so that its full scope 
and living reality may be clearly 
seen. 
Unesco’s programme for science 
and technology has been reinforc- 
ed in the past few years, although 
its scope is perhaps not yet as 
broad as it should be. 
As regards the spread of scien- 
tific knowledge, 1 welcome the 
support given to the UNISIST pro- 
gramme since the exchange of 
scientific and technological infor- 
mation is of fundamental impor- 
tance for the progress of both the 
industrialized and the developing 
countries. But the developing 
countries still need to be able to 
make use of such knowledge in 
ways that they themselves choose. 
It is with this in mind that we 
shall continue to aid Member 
States whenever they ask for as- 
sistance in formulating science and 
technology policies appropriate to 
their development needs. 
Regarding human resources in 
science and technology, you have 
adopted a recommendation on 
the status of scientific research 
workers, the application of which 
should give positive results. We 
shall also try to facilitate contacts 
between research workers and 
institutes, particularly on a re- 
gional basis. 
| also note with satisfaction the 
importance accorded to science 
and technology training program- 
mes at all levels. Training scien- 
tists, engineers and technicians is 
still a crucial problem for most 
developing countries. For this 
reason, we must step up our 
efforts in this field too, giving 
special emphasis to the quality of 
such training. 
Our post-graduate training pro- 
grammes have an important func- 
tion and meet real needs. We 
shall try to strengthen this part 
of our programme, particularly in 
the developing countries; and | 
should like to thank those States 
which have arranged for their 
institutions to provide post-gradu- 
ate courses. ; 
| wish to say a few words about 
“transfers of technology” al- 
though, in fact, | prefer the term 
“development of appropriate tech- 
nologies”. Some countries have 
fallen into what may be called 
“technological traps”. Imitating 
others, they have adopted tech- 
niques which call for considerable 
capital, costly equipment and fo- 
reign specialists, and which are 
not really suited to their needs. 
It would nevertheless be absurd 
to reject any innovation from ano-

ther country or even to refrain 
from using advanced technologies 
whenever the right conditions can 
be fully met. | think that one of 
Unesco’s functions should indeed 
be to assist Member States which 
seek such aid to find the right 
path, particularly by promoting the 
pooling of ideas, information and 
experience and by helping to 
launch pilot projects that can be 
further developed. 
While it is true that many coun- 
tries seeking to further their dev- 
elopment still lack the necessary 
scientific and technological know- 
ledge, it is also true that, on a 
global scale, we have both the 
knowledge and the resources with 
which to banish hunger, cure 
disease, and remedy poverty and 
injustice. What we lack is an ethic 
which provides an alternative to 
the egoistic or uncontrolled and 
intimidating application of science 
and technology, a humanitarian 
and humanizing ethic which can 
guide the thinking and purpose 
of men and women towards more 
fraternal and more universal aims. 
While certain parts of the pro- 
gramme for the social sciences, 
humanities and culture, were 
approved unanimously, others in 
some cases gave rise to widely 
diverging opinions. This occurred, 
in particular, when ideological 
differences brought to light dif- 
ferent interpretations of economic 
or social and cultural questions 
which the social sciences cannot 
as yet analyse objectively, for 
want of scientific tools that would 
enable us to reach a universal 
consensus, 
Thus, any action that enables 
the social sciences to contribute 
to the development of scientific 
methods whose usefulness and 
objectivity are universally accepted 
would be both justified and bene- 
ficial. And at the same time as 
such methods are improved, 
efforts must be continued to make 
better use of them. In saying this 
| have in mind both the developed 
countries, with their specialists 
whose goal will always be to 
seek perfection, and the develop- 
ing countries, where the main 
emphasis must be placed on basic 
training by means provided for in 
one of the resolutions adopted by 
the General Conference. 
However, over and above these 
specific activities, the role that 
the social sciences play or will 
play in Unesco's programme has 
been considerably expanded. It 
has been rightly pointed out that 
the social sciences are at the 
crossroads of numerous activities, 
of which the problems of peace, 
of development or of the estab- 
lishment of a new international 
order are only three examples. 
The social sciences should provide 
the thinking which precedes action 
and then enriches it. 
Similar observations could be 
made concerning culture. Today 
there is a growing awareness that 4

countries bordering on the 
Mediterranean.

international economic order:

p culture is an integral part of over- 
all development. This situation 
is not without its dangers, as | 
have already said in speaking of 
the relationship between cultures, 
which are sometimes fragile, and 
technologies which are often reck- 
lessly imported. The only way to 
transform this fragility into 
strength may be through the plann- 
ing of cultural policies in harmony 
with policies for education and 
science, If these three compo- 
nents are integrated, each will be 
strengthened by the contributions 
and support of the others, 
I shall not examine in detail the 
numerous activities which you 
have approved, such as the pres- 
ervation and development of 
national cultural heritages, the res- 
titution of cultural property to its 
country of origin, the preservation 
of historic quarters, towns and 
sites in places where moderniza- 
tion is in many cases intrusive, or 
man in his environment in con- 
riexion with the Man and the Bio- 
sphere Programme. Yet the fact 
that | mention these activities only 
briefly in no way detracts from 
their importance nor from the 
attention | intend to give to them. 
It was gratifying to find so many 
speakers contributing to the Gen- 
eral Conference discussions on the 
programme for free flow of infor- 
mation since access to information 
is vital both to the strengthening 
of international understanding and 
to the development of science and 
technology. However, in this field 
as in many others, a certain laxity 
of language can be harmful. 
Information may appear differ- 
ently to those who communicate 
it and those who receive it. The 
former see it as a service they 
are providing, whereas for the 
latter it is or it may appear to be 
an intrusion upon their environ- 
ment or their privacy. Freedom to 
circulate information may become 
a pretext for exercising pressure, 
and this raises the problem of the 
content of information. 
You were therefore right in 
emphasizing that the free flow of 
information, which has its rightful 
place in Unesco’s Constitution, 
must be a two-way flow, and be 
regarded as an exchange, if in this 
field too we are to avert a division 
of the world into producers and 
passive consumers, In this respect 
the adoption of a code of ethics 
for journalists, which has been 
proposed, could become the coun- 
ter-balance to an ill-defined free- 
dom of the press. Many other 
problems are inextricably bound 
up with the free flow of informa- 
tion. One example is the shortage 
of newsprint and the control of 
its production in a manner pre- 
judicial to certain countries, parti- 
cularly the least developed, as is 
the case today. 
Intellectual co-operation which 
was the very root of Unesco, since 
our Organization was in a real 
sense the successor to the League 
of Nations Institute of Intellectual 
Co-operation, remains one of the 
principal reasons for Unesco’s 
existence even if, as a result of 
changes in the world, the Organi- 
zation has gradually extended its 
activities to new fields. Today, 
intellectual co-operation is truly 
the source and the fundamental 
condition of all international action 
for progress. 
Without a global exchange of 
ideas, human knowledge would 
not achieve that universality which 
not only puts it in its true perspec- 
tive and enriches it, but at the 
same time enables it to be used 
for the benefit of the world com- 
munity. To appreciate the true 
value of the communication of 
knowledge, one need only think 
of the injustice caused in the field 
of science, for example, by the 
monopolization of knowledge for 
the benefit of the few, the threats 
to international peace and security 
to which this may give rise, and 
the obstacles to progress which it 
creates. 
Unesco's record in intellectual 
co-operation is outstanding and is 
widely known. | shall try to 
broaden this basic activity still 
further, steering it when neces- 
sary in new directions. 
| think that Unesco, whose vo- 
cation it is to be one of the cen- 
tres of universal thinking, should 
call more frequently on the great 
figures of the world intellectual 
community—philosophers, histor- 
ians, men of letters, scientists, 
specialists and research workers in 
all disciplines and of all schools, 
artists and sculptors—to reflect 
together on certain major prob- 
lems of our time. | intend shortly 
to set up a working group of this 
type, whose members could give 
useful advice on certain aspects 
of Unesco’s role in the coming 
years. 
We ought also to stimulate in- 
ternational co-operation among 
the major research institutions by 
encouraging the development of 
fundamental and applied research 
at national level in the various 
branches of knowledge. | think, 
in fact, that we should get the

most influential institutions in the 
world to participate closely in the 
execution of Unesco's programme, 
as part of a mobilization of the 
world scientific community to 
serve mankind and especially the 
developing countries, 
| should like to emphasize here 
the crucial role which Unesco's 
National Commissions must play 
by initiating and stimulating in- 
tellectual co-operation among the 
various national institutions. Simi- 
larly, | think that the trend which 
has developed in recent years 
towards entrusting certain pro- 
gramme activities, such as studies 
or research, to non-governmental 
organizations, deserves to be en- 
couraged as it has frequently pro- 
duced excellent results. 
Inter-university co-operation, 
which we chiefly promote through 
the International Association of 
Universities, is of course one of 
the fundamental forms of intellec- 
tual co-operation. 
In this connexion, we expect a 
great deal from the initial work of 
the European Centre for Higher 
Education in Bucharest and from 
the similar centres soon to be 
established in Latin America and 
the Arab countries. Moreover, the 
conclusion of agreements bet- 
ween States, modelled on the 
Mexico City Convention on the 
recognition of studies, diplomas 
and degrees in higher education, 
should infuse fresh life into in- 
tellectual co-operation by encou- 
raging the movement of students 
and teachers and the pooling of 
ideas... 
| view with great hope the activi- 
ties of the United Nations Univer- 
sity which will shortly begin. Con- 
ceived as an “international com- 
munity of scholars engaged in 
research, post-graduate training 
and dissemination of knowledge”, 
the United Nations University will 
study from an interdisciplinary 
standpoint the urgent problems 
posed by the survival, develop- 
ment and welfare of mankind. 
But as well as offering unprece- 
dented opportunities for throwing 
light on these problems through 
the combined intellectual efforts of 
the international community's most 
eminent institutions and persona- 
ties, the United Nations Univer- 
sity will also help to strengthen the 
solidarity of the world community 
and stimulate the flow of ideas, In 
particular by endeavouring—as 
laid down in its Charter—to “alle- 
viate the intellectual isolation of 
members of academic and scien- 
tific communities in the developing 
countries”. We may thus hope 
that in addition to being a symbol 
of the universality of thought and 
an international intellectual centre, 
the university will be a powerful 
force for international rapproche- 
ment and understanding. 
Co-operation among the Spe- 
cialized Agencies of the United 
Nations system is obviously diffe- 
rent in nature from that which

### 49645: A Greater need than ever for tolerance and understanding

p may develop between the other 
26 
organizations | have mentioned, 
since it is not only a welcome 
source of enrichment of interna- 
tional thought and action, but is 
indispensable for the satisfactory 
operation of the whole U.N. sys- 
tem, indeed for its very existence... 
The United Nations General 
Assembly is to examine in 1975 
the problem of the overall co-ordi- 
nation of the institutions of the 
United Nations system and their 
respective roles, with a view to 
improving the system’s ability to 
satisfy the needs of the interna- 
tional community as effectively as 
possible. 
Having for many years carried 
out major programmes in close 
collaboration with other U.N. Spe- 
cialized Agencies and organiz- 
ations (1), Unesco will collaborate 
fully in all efforts aimed at better 
co-ordination between the parallel 
activities of these organizations. 
| shall do my utmost to increase 
Unesco’s co-operation with its 
sister agencies in every way. 
The problems of aid to devel- 
opment, so often associated with 
Unesco's operational activities, 
are also now taking on new 
dimensions. The debate on a new 
international economic order, be- 
gun at the sixth special session 
of the United Nations General 
Assembly, has already led to 
extremely interesting discussions 
in the Economic and Social 
Council, and will be the subject 
of the special session of the 
United Nations General Assembly 
in September 1975, thus gaining 
fresh scope and a new quality. 
Here we are no longer con- 
cerned with operational action or 
aid to development, in the tradi- 
tional meaning of these terms, but 
with problems affecting all man- 
kind, It is for this reason that 
we should speak of co-operation 
for development rather than aid 
to development. Indeed, the inter- 
national crisis in energy sources 
has demonstrated the vulnerability 
of the developed countries and the 
interdependence of all countries, 
whether regarded as developed 
or developing. 
Unesco must be able not only 
to participate in this .debate, 
within the United Nations or 
elsewhere, but also to contribute 
to it the wealth of experience it 
has accumulated over the three 
decades of its existence. 
Co-operation for development 
is a daily fact of the Organiz- 
ation’s life and there can be no 
question of halting current op- 
erations on the grounds that there 
1s need for reflection with the 
idea of reorganizing the pro- 
gramme. Two parallel and si- 
(1) In particular the United Nations 
Children's Fund, the Food and Agri- 
culture Organization, the International 
Labour Organization, the World Health 
Organization, the United Nations Dev- 
elopment Programme and the World 
Food Programme, 
multaneous activities are called 
for: we must do all we can to 
formulate new objectives and new 
means of co-operation for devel- 
opment and we must carry out 
current projects and programmes 
as efficiently as possible... 
It is commonly said that devel- 
opment is an integrated process, 
a many-faceted enterprise in which 
efforts must be brought to bear 
on several fronts simultaneously. 
But in the past, we have been 
unable or unwilling to draw the 
logical operational conclusions 
from this self-evident fact, namely 
that if development is an inte- 
grated process, the financing and 
fields of action of programmes of 
co-operation for development 
should also be integrated. 
Among the many fields of action 
in development, probably the best 
example is that of rural devel- 
opment programmes. For rural 
development means the devel- 
opment of education, agriculture, 
roads, cottage industries, distri- 
bution networks, water supply 
systems, a system of credit, a 
health service, etc. Are there in 
fact any areas of human activity 
that are not part of rural devel- 
opment? 
The same is true of financing. 
During recent decades, each of 
the international or bilateral 
financing bodies has painstakingly 
established its criteria for 
financing and has selected the 
types of activities for which it 
provides support. This special- 
ization, the at times unduly rigid 
choice of criteria and the over- 
compartmentalization of different 
activities may curb the introduc- 
tion of new approaches and new 
procedures for co-operation for 
development. 
So we should carefully examine 
the real content of development 
and study the areas in which 
co-operation for development is 
possible and desirable, dis- 
tinguishing them from those which 
should be the responsibility and 
the result of nationa! efforts. The 
aim is certainly not to establish 
new restrictive criteria in addition 
to those | have just mentioned, 
on the contrary, it is to identify 
openings which will yield maximum 
results with modest resources. 
And here | wish to emphasize 
two things: Unesco is not founded 
on a theoretical universality; it 
also exists to serve its Member 
States, each of its Member States. 
It is essential that each Member 
State—rich or poor, industrialized 
or aspiring to be so, in northern 
or southern hemisphere, in east 
or west—should be able to find 
a place in the Organization and to 
receive from it all the services 
which it is entitled to expect. 
Aid to development, then, in 
spite of its importance, is only 
one aspect of Unesco's action. 
As Assistant Director-General for 
Education, it became clear to me 
that we could also render useful 
services to the industrialized 
countries by offering them our 
vast experience of the problems 
in our fields of competence with 
which they are confronted daily. 
Moreover—as {| shall always 
emphasize—development poses 
problems, however different they 
may be, to all countries, It is time 
that we geared our action ac- 
cordingly and it is also desirable 
that the industrialized countries 
bring more of their problems to 
us so that together we may work 
out new forms of co-operation.

### 188765: Our hidden mineral resources

“OUR HIDDEN 
MINERAL RESOURCES 
An Eldorado beneath the oceans 
and in every kind of rock 
ANKIND will need more 
mineral resources in the next 
half-century than in the whole of its 
previous history. This applies to all 
types of minerals but particularly to 
fuels and to rare metals and elements. 
In many of the modern alloys and 
materials used in industry and science, 
many different constituents are added 
to the basic metals, including large 
quantities of rare elements. 
Many kinds of minerals, occurring 
by Konstantin I. Lukashev 
in large deposits, are being rapidly 
exhausted or in some cases have 
already been exhausted. This is 
especially true of iron ores, manganese, 
chromium, nickel, copper, lead, zinc, 
gold, silver and platinum. 
Fewer deposits of metallic and non- 
metallic minerals are being discovered 
near the surface and at depths of two 
or three kilometres. Prospectors are 
concentrating more and more on 
deeper levels of the earth's crust. >

. In theory, contemporary science and 
technology could make it possible fully 
to satisfy the world's material needs. 
In practice many social, geographical, 
technical and other difficulties will 
have to be overcome before these 
needs are filled. 
Information on world mineral stocks 
is not complete even for the major 
metals and minerals used in Industry. 
Many developing countries recently 
freed from colonial rule are only 
beginning to prospect and assess 
their own mineral wealth while Infor- 
mation on deposits and reserves of 
ores, petroleum and gas at depths of 
more than three kilometres is also 
very inadequate. 
According to rough calculations, the 
bulk (65 per cent) of known deposits 
of various kinds of minerals consists 
of low-grade ores, with only a very 
small proportion (5 per cent) of high- 
grade ores. 
The resources of the United States, 
Japan, the Federal Republic of Ger- 
many, the United Kingdom, France and 
other Western European countries are 
not sufficient to meet their require- 
ments. 
The United States of America, for 
example, has adequate supplies of 
coal, gas, phosphates and molybdenum 
but is dependent on imports for the 
bulk of its supplies of manganese, 
chromium, nickel, mercury, tin, cobalt 
and other metals and minerals. Japan 
is completely dependent on imports 
for its oil, iron ore, chromites, nickel, 
cobalt, molybdenum, bauxite, tin, 
potassium salts and phosphates. 
The Federal Republic of Germany 
Imports 55-85 per cent of its supplies 
of copper, manganese, mercury, lead, 
tungsten and zinc, the only minerals 
which it is not obliged to import being 
coal and potassium salts. The United 
Kingdom is able to supply its entire 
natural gas needs from domestic 
sources and has been supplying 90 per 
cent of its own coal requirements. 
While France is rich in iron ore, 
potassium salts, bauxite and some 
other useful minerals, it is obliged to 
import many others. 
The Soviet Union is better provided 
than other countries with mineral 
resources, having large deposits of 
coal, oil, gas, iron ore and non-ferrous 
metals. 
8 Energy Resources. Of all the 
possible sources of energy—fossil 
fuels, atomic power, . solar energy, 
hydraulic and wind power, and geo- 
thermal energy—the most widely used 
have hitherto been coal, oil and gas. 
What energy resources will mankind 
have at its disposal at the beginning 
of the twenty-first century and what

TAPPING UNDERSEA OIL 
To meet the world’s rising demand for oil. man is now prospecting and exploiting 
new sources under the sea. Huge concrete structure, below, under construction 
in Stavanger Fjord, Norway, is protective casing of a 160,000 m?* deepsea tank 
for storing output of a North Sea oil-field. The 100-metre-high structure has 
since been towed about 300 kms out to sea close to the drilling site, where 
it is now grounded on the sea bed with about 30 metres protruding above 
the water, ready to provision tankers anchored nearby. Perforated casing will 
blunt the force of heavy seas. Study of fossil microscopic marine organisms 
like the one shown above, 0.8 mm in diameter, helps scientists to date 
geological layers during oil prospection. Right, three aqualung divers are 
lowered from a drilling rig in the Gulf of Gascony, off the French coast, for 
underwater inspection.

scientific and technological progress 
is to be foreseen in the utilization of 
these different resources? 
World supplies of coal, which is a 
very important raw material In the 
manufacture of synthetic products, are 
assured for the next 150-200 years. 
For world reserves of bituminous coal 
and brown coal at economically 
workable depths (up to 1,800 metres 
for coal and 600 metres for brown coal) 
the most often quoted estimate ‘is 
16 trillion tons (1 trillion = 1012), 
Towards the end of this century, 
prospecting for further deposits at 
great depths, particularly in developing

countries, may well raise this estimate 
to one of 30 or 40 trillion tons, 
Known world supplies of oil amount 
to 85.5 billion tons, including 14.8 billion 
tons in sea bed deposits. These 
figures could be multiplied by three or 
five to allow for deposits which may 
be discovered before the turn of the 
century. ) 
Known world reserves of natural 
gas, according to the same calculations, 
amount to over 50 trillion cubic metres, 
including almost 7 trillion cubic metres 
in sea-bed deposits. 
Coal, oil and gas will probably be 
the main sources of energy until the 
end of this century. But extraction 
of oil and gas Is increasing very 
rapidly and, if present trends continue, 
supplies of these extremely important 
fuels will be exhausted in a matter of 
decades—even allowing for the dis- 
covery of new deposits and improved 
extraction coefficients. We might 
recall that Mendeleev, the formulator 
of the periodic table of elements, once 
observed that burning oil was like 
stoking a furnace with banknotes. 
This applies equally to natural gas. 
® Other Mineral Resources. One of 
the most Important tasks facing 
science and technology in the im- 
mediate future, therefore, is to discover 
ways of using other natural sources 
of energy. Nuclear energy, solar 
energy, geothermal energy and energy 
derived from the wind and water are 
bound to become increasingly import- 
ant in the near future. 
It is possible that towards the end 
of the century progress will have been 
made in harnessing thermonuclear 
energy, which will mark an extremely 
important step by science and tech- 
nology towards solving the world's 
energy problems. Mankind will then 
have millions of years of supplies of 
thermonuclear energy based on 
hydrogen isotopes obtained from sea 
water, 
If world population estimates for the 
end of the century (at least 6,000 to 
7,000 million) are taken as a basis of 
needs, production and consumption of 
metals will have to double. With the 
development of ferrous and non- 
ferrous metallurgy in the developing 
countries, the total world production 
and consumption of metal may well 
increase more than twofold but prob- 
ably not more than threefold. Rough 
calculations indicate that the world's 
extraction of iron could rise to a total 
of 1 billion tons. Extraction of other 
ferrous and of non-ferrous metals 
could increase up to tenfold. 
The importance of the rare elements 
is certain to increase steadily In 
consequence of technical progress. 
They are essential for the development 
of modern processes and industries 
which require extremely strong, light-. 
weight, acid-, heat- and corrosion- 
resistant materials to be made into 
articles of small size. 
Little in the way of study and 
prospection has been carried out on 
ores containing rare elements. The 
problem of metal ores is therefore 
highly important and indeed acute for 
many countries, its solution involving 
geological, technical and sometimes 
social factors. 
Non-metallic raw materials are more 
widely used in the economy than

p metals. They are increasingly import- 
ant to the construction industry, the 
manufacture of products for use in 
agriculture, mineral salts, chemical 
products and so on. The building 
industry obviously relies on stone and 
the ingredients for cement, bricks, tiles 
and insulating materials, while rock 
salts, potassium salts, sulphur and 
phosphates are basic raw materials 
for the chemical industry, and clay, 
feldspar, talc and other minerals are 
the basic materials for the ceramics 
Industry. Many minerals and rocks 
are used in metallurgy and in the 
manufacture of abrasives, insulators 
and lubricants. 
More than forty kinds of minerals 
are used by industry. Among the 
most important are diamonds, asbestos, 
gypsum, clay, granite, graphite, lime- 
stone, minerals containing potassium, 
30 
sodium and lithium, sand, sandstone, 
sulphur, mica and phosphates. 
It is a curious fact that the world’s 
annual per capita consumption of 
sulphuric acid exceeds that of sugar 
and that the petroleum and petro- 
chemical industries are to a large 
extent dependent on barite and 
bentonite clays for use during drilling 
and on fluorite, salt, sulphur and 
various clays for the refining process. 
8 Future Sources of Mineral Wealth. 
There Is a preponderance of low- 
grade ores in the earth's crust. The 
exploitation of these ores is likely to 
become more important as further 
technological advances are made. In 
the nineteenth century only copper 
ores containing 4 to 6 per cent or more 
of copper were regarded as paying 
ores. Now ores with a copper content 
of as little as 0.4 per cent are con- 
sidered worth working. Modern 
methods make it possible to extract 
zinc, lead, silver, copper, nickel, 
cobalt, and many other metals from 
low-grade ores. 
The possibility of using low-grade 
ores will greatly increase our mineral 
stocks and remove the threat of total 
depletion of the world’s mineral 
resources for decades. 
A substantial proportion of the 
world’s resources of coal, oil, gas, 
bauxite, rock salts and potassium 
salts, sulphur and phosphorites occurs 
in sedimentary deposits. There are 
good prospects for extracting these 
minerals from depths of 5-7 kilometres 
and more. 
It has recently been established that 
vast reserves of mineral wealth lie 
beneath the seas and oceans of our

scientists in recent years indicate that 
thousands of millions of tons of 
manganese, nickel, cobalt, and copper 
are contained in the iron-manganese 
nodules which lie on the sea-bed. 
The Soviet exploration vessel Vityaz, 
for example, has discovered large 
accumulations of these nodules at 
depths of 4-5 kilometres in the central 
Indian Ocean, covering whole areas 
of the ocean bed in continuous layers. 
Reserves of these minerals on the 
floor of the Pacific Ocean are esti- 
mated at 1,656 billion tons, including 
358 billion tons of manganese, 207 
billion tons of iron, 43 billion tons of 
aluminium, 25 billion tons of mag- 
nesium, 14.7 billion tons of nickel, 
9.9 billion tons of tin, and 7.9 billion 
tons of copper. 
Furthermore, it has heen calculated 
that the seas and oceans of our planet 
contain more than 20 million cubic 
kilometres of salts, a truly colossal 
figure. Sea water also contains 
varying quantities of iron, gold, copper, 
nickel, cobalt, manganese and other 
elements, 
If all the gold contained in sea 
water could be extracted and divided 
equally between all the earth's in- 
habitants, there would be more than 
a ton for each of usl And there is 
twenty times more silver, thirty times 
more thorium and molybdenum and a 
thousand times more iodine in sea 
water than there is gold. The oceans 
are indeed a veritable Eldorado. But 
a satisfactory way has yet to be found 
of extracting rare elements from sea 
water, 
In the long run, technical progress 
may make it possible to extract the 
essential minerals from any kind of 
rock. Every 100 tons of ordinary 
magmatic rock (granite, for example) 
contains on average 8 tons of alumi- 
nium, 5 tons of iron, 540 kilogrammes 
of titanium, 80 kilos of manganese, 
80 kilos of chromium, 18 kilos of 
nickel, 14 kilos of vanadium, 4,5 kilos 
of tungsten, 9 kilos of copper, 1.8 kilos 
of lead and a quantity of uranium and 
thorium capable of producing as much 
energy as 50 tons of coal. 
If man could devise a method of 
extracting chemical elements from all 
the different kinds of rocks, he need 
never lack mineral resources. It is 
my belief that in time mankind will 
solve this problem and will look on 
all rocks as ores.

### 49649: A Young nation builds a unique open-air museum: the wealth of Niger's traditions, crafts and wildlife in an unusual setting

The National Museum of Niger, at Niamey, 
has achieved a remarkable feat. It has 
recreated, in the heart of a city on a 
24-hectare site, the immense country of 
Niger (1,200,000 km? in area) in all its 
aspects: ethnic, cultural, artistic, zoolo- 
gical, botanical, etc. This highly original 
museum, held up as a model for other 
newly independent countries, enables over: 
200,000 visitors each year to discover 
Niger's national roots and to learn about 
the country’s diversity through contact 
with its rich cultural heritage and facets 
of contemporary life. Below left, a

HE young African nations, 
whose historical, ethnic and 
geographical “fabric” is sometimes far 
from homogeneous, for reasons with 
which everyone is familiar, feel a 
need—a strong need—to express their 
personality and affirm their unity. 
Firstly because it is only in the last 
few decades that these nations have 
emerged on to the international stage. 
Secondly because their governments 
are well aware that the long and 
arduous task which faces them, and to 
which they must give the highest 
priority, is to melt and unite in the 
crucible of a collective consciousness 
the ethnic and historic mosaic formed 
by their different peoples. 
In laying the foundations on which 
the new state of Niger has been built, 
the government has been employing 
every means it could devise, including, . 
surprisingly enough, the creation of a 
national museum. 
Four separate yet closely connected 
operations are simultaneously being 
carried on by the National Museum of 
Niger: an ethnological museum; a zoo 
and public pleasure gardens; a centre 
for the development of traditional 
craftsmanship; and an educational and 
social work, project. 
 
PABLO TOUCET, Spanish archaeologist and 
museologist, was responsible for planning and 
building the Nstional! Museum of Niger, Niamey, 
of which he has been curator since 1958. 
He was previously in charge of Punico-Roman 
excavations at Utica, Tunisia. Using a new 
method he had developed for handling ancient 
" mosaics, he succeeded in removing and recons- 
tructing the famous baptistry of Kelibia, a 
masterwork now in the Bardo Museum in Tunis.

These four operations, carefully 
planned to interlink, have given the 
Museum an original appearance and 
made it a dynamic ensemble of 
activities. 
The buildings of the National Mu- 
seum stand in the very heart of 
Niamey, capital of the Republic of the 
Niger, on a beautiful site whose 
southern section overlooks the broad 
and peaceful waters of the river Niger. 
The great park had been. badly 
neglected and eventually became the 
city refuse dump because of its 
proximity to what was then Niamey's 
only market. Since June 1958 it has 
been gradually transformed into a 
series of delightful gardens where 
today the people of Niamey and 
tourists stroll in ever increasing num- 
bers. In these surroundings stand the 
various Museum buildings, whose 
diversity is one of their chief attrac- 
tions. 
A museum is a means of extending 
and completing the basic teaching 
given in schools. However, in our 
case we were aiming to attract the 
interest of both educated people and 
those who are illiterate. Thus we 
were constantly searching for a highly 
elusive compromise: a museum that 
would appeal to the first of these 
groups without boring the second. 
A visit to the ethnological museum 
is an opportunity for people to return 
to their past, creating in many cases 
a new self-awareness. 
In Niamey there are many adults 
with time on their hands and children 
with no opportunity to attend school. 
By attracting their interest, the Mu- 
seum is making a real and practical 
contribution to the education of 
children and adults. 
Since its foundation, the National 
Museum of Niger has carefully 
arranged a collection of many every- 
day objects used by the people of p

Niger. These objects are an ethnolo- 
gical treasure trove, not because of 
their intrinsic value but on account of 
their authenticity. 
Within the Museum grounds are 
modern buildings whose architecture 
is inspired by the traditional construc- 
tions of banco (dried mud), buildings 
which show that Niger possesses the 
essential features of an architectural 
style suited to the country and which 
can easily be developed and adapted 
to meet the needs of modern life (see 
also article page 4). 
Different types of dwellings from all 
over Niger have also been accurately 
reconstructed in the Museum grounds, 
so that people can see them without 
having to travel great distances. 
There is a Sorkawa fishermen’s 
encampment, just like those found on 
the banks of the river Niger during 
the fishing season. Huts, ovens for 
smoking fish, nets, fish-traps, har- 
poons and a canoe give the im- 
pression that the camp is actually 
being used. 
Not far away tents with lavish 
3 
furnishings used by Niger's nomadic 
tribes have been pitched. There are 
tents of Toubbou tribesmen from the 
oasis of Bilma, of Tuaregs from the 
Air region and from Azaocuack in 
+ northwest Niger, as well as those of 
Wogos, Kourteys and Fulani. 
The rural homes of the major Hausa, 
Songhai and Djerma tribal groups have 
been recreated down to the last detail, 
comprising buildings, furnishings and 
the utensils used by families in daily 
life. These recreations of rural Niger 
are of great educational value, offering 
foreign visitors a broad panorama of 
the country's traditional life and at the 
same time giving the people of 
western Niger an opportunity to get 
to know about the way of life of their 
fellow-citizens in the distant eastern 
countryside. 
Elsewhere masons have built a 
house with the famous "Hausa" arches 
used in a typical type of dwelling of the 
Hausa people. This style of building 
is urban rather than rural. 
There is also a pavilion of Niger 
traditional dress, which considerably 
enriches the Museum's ethnological 
collection, But the Museum has gone 
still further by bringing together 
craftsmen from all parts of the 
country—blacksmiths, weavers, cob- 
blers, carvers, leatherworkers and 
potters. This has been done partly to 
prevent traditional techniques from 
dying out, but above all so that 
craftsmen from different tribes, the 
Djerma and the Tuareg, the Songhai 
and the Hausa, the Beriberi and the 
Fulani, can work together, mingling 
their laughter and their songs. 
When the visitor has seen the 
different traditional costumes and 
homes, he can watch the craftsmen 
at work and, if he wishes, take away 
one of the objects he has seen being 
made. We do not think that any 
ethnological museum can do more than 
this. 
"In another part of the park visitors 
listen to traditional songs, legends 
and historic tales from Niger's distant 
past, all rendered in the native lan- 
guages. We believe that there is no 
better way of preserving a song or 
story than teaching it to children,

### 49649: A Young nation builds a unique open-air museum: the wealth of Niger's traditions, crafts and wildlife in an unusual setting

  
The regional diversity of the Republic 
of the Niger is outstandingly displayed 
and explained at the country’s national 
museum in Niamey. All the different 
types of traditional dwellings have 
been scrupulously reconstructed in the 
open air: nomads’ tents, fishermen’s 
huts, and town and village homes from 
the mosaic of regions that form Niger. 
Left, a “boua”, a millet granary of a 
kind found in Songhai villages in 
western Niger. This highly functional 
construction of “banco” (worked clay 
and straw) has an opening a metre 
above ground level. The grain is poured 
through a vent in the dome, which is 
covered with an enormous straw hat 
known as a “boua bata”, affording 
protection against sun or rain. Below, 
in the museum’s zoo, where virtually 
all Niger's animal life is represented, a 
hippopotamus accepts a little snack 
~ from admiring visitors. 
without any kind of compulsion. These 
songs, in which the Niger visitors 
sometimes join in, are thus being 
saved from the oblivion which threat- 
ened them. : 
In a report written after a tour of 
Africa, South America and Asia, M. de 
Varine-Bohan, Director of the Interna- 
tional Council of Museums, described 
the Niger as the first country to have 
made maximum use of a museum to 
further government efforts to promote 
- national unity. 
About 300 boys and girls regularly 
attend courses given in the Museum's 
education centre. These boys and girls 
have been pupils in state primary 
schools, but at the end of their 
schooling some have not yet found an 
opening in the country’s economy. 
And so they have time on their hands, 
they forget what they have been 
taught, and become a serious social 
problem. The school at the Museum 
is not modelled on the state schools. 
The primary aim is to encourage the

children to retain what they have 
learned, and so they attend revision 
classes in languages and mathematics. 
At the same time they are given a 
broad training in manual skills which 
find a ready use in everyday life. 
They learn how to build a complete 
house in banco: how to prepare the 
foundations, make bricks and build 
walls and roofs, and also how to paint 
it and install electric wiring, etc. 
Among other things they also learn 
market gardening, how to rear chick- 
ens and rabbits, basic mechanics (how 
to repair light motor-cycles and bicy- 
cles), and traditional pottery. 
The girls also attend revision classes 
and learn sewing and cooking. The 
cookery taught is based on foods 
produced locally,” the aim being to 
work out nutritionally well-balanced 
menus. They also learn hygiene and 
child care. 
By the end of their time at the 
Centre these boys and girls have 
learned many useful skills. They also 
come to realize the importance of 
manual work, unlike some young 
people in cities who tend to despise it. 
In October 1971, the National Mu- 
seum, using its own resources, began 
to work on behalf of the blind and 
physically handicapped. Initially these 
persons were housed in a straw hut. 
Most of the handicapped were 
beggars, and the aim was to make 
them capable of earning a living. 
This meant providing for all their needs, 
including food, clothing, transport, and 
training, including special exercises in 
order for them to acquire manual skills. 
Today over a score of blind and 
handicapped persons are housed in a 
specially constructed building and are 
taught by two young instructors who 
have graduated from the craft training 
school, Each blind person works with 
a spastic person, and this teamwork is 
producing good results. 
We have made no attempt to Imitate 
the fine museums of Europe and else- 
where. Instead, we have planned and 
created a museum in keeping with our 
resources. It was originally conceived 
for the people of Niger, but we have 
since found that Europeans enjoy 
visiting it as much as Africans. 
Several other African states have 
expressed their intention of setting up 
similar museums. By launching this 
pioneering cultural enterprise, we have 
shown our fellow African countries 
that it is possible to create a museum 
without spending vast sums on 
buildings and running costs,

OCTAVIO PAZ, Mexican poet, essayist and 
translator, is one of the outstanding writers in 
the Spanish language. He has been Mexico's 
ambassador to India, and has taught in several 
universities, including Cambridge (U.K.) where 
he was Simon Bolivar Professor of Latin-Am- 
erican Studies. He has published several volumes 
of poetry, including “Libertad bajo palabra” 
(Liberty on parole). English translations of his 
essays include “Labyrinth of Solitude = (1961), 
"Claude Lévi-Strauss: An Introduction (1972) 
and "Alternating Current” (1973). An antho- 
logy of his transiations of poetry into Spanish 
(~ Versiones y Diversiones ”’) was published 
in 1973.

EARNING to speak implies 
learning to translate. When a 
child asks his mother what this-or that 
word means, what he is really asking 
her to do is to translate the unknown 
term into language that he can under- 
stand. In this sense, translation 
within a language does not differ 
basically from translation into another 
language. The history of every people 
re-enacts this childhood experience. 
Even the most isolated tribes at one 
time or another come up against the 
language barrier of some alien group. 
The sounds of a foreign language 
may cause us wonder, anger, loathing 
or amused perplexity, but soon make 
us think about our own form of speech. 
Language then loses its universal 
character and we become aware of the 
existence of other tongues, each of 
them strange and unintelligible to the 
others. 
In the past, translation dispelled any 
doubts we might have entertained. 
Even if there was no single uni- 
versal language, languages never- 
theless formed a universal society in 
which everyone could understand one 
another and communicate, once certain 
difficulties had been overcome, Com- 
munication was possible because

whatever the language, people every- 
where spoke about the same things. 
This universality of the mind was 
the answer to the confusion of Babel. 
There may be many languages but they 
have meaning in common. For Pascal 
the very multiplicity of religions 
constituted a proof of the truth of 
Christianity. Translation offered the 
ideal of universal intelligibility to 
counterbalance the diversity of 
languages. Thus translation was not 
only an additional proof of the unity of 
mind but also a guarantee of that unity. 
The modern age has destroyed that 
security. When man rediscovered the 
infinite variety of temperaments and 
emotions that existed, and became 
conscious of the multiplicity of customs 
and institutions in the world, he 
stopped seeing himself in other men. 
Until that time the savage had been 
an exception that had to be eliminated 
through conversion or extermination, 
by baptism or by the ‘sword. The 
savage who made his appearance in 
the eighteenth-century salons was a 
new type of creature. Even when he 
spoke the language of his hosts to 
perfection, there was a residual 
strangeness about him. He was not 
a candidate for conversion but a sub-

p ject for dispute and criticism. The 
originality of his judgements, the 
simplicity of his customs and the very 
violence of his emotions were proof of 
the folly and vanity, if not the infamy, 
of baptism and conversion. 
Then things were reversed. The 
religious search for a universal identity 
gave way to an intellectual curiosity 
anxious to discover differences that 
were no less universal. Strangeness 
ceased to be a deviation and became 
exemplary in a paradoxical and 
revealing way: the savage now rep- 
resented civilized man's yearning for 
the past, his alter ego, his lost half. 
Translation reflects these changes. 
It is no longer an operation that tends 
to prove the ultimate similarity of men 
everywhere, but has become the 
vehicle of their individualities. For- 
merly its purpose was to reveal the 
likenesses that transcended their 
disparities; henceforth it shows that 
these disparities are absolute, whether 
they reflect the strangeness of the 
savage or that of our neighbours. 
A remark made by Dr. Samuel John- 
son while on a journey expresses this 
new outlook quite cogently. “A blade 
of grass is always a blade of grass, 
whether in one country or another,” 
he said. “Men and women are my 
subjects of inquiry; let us see how 
these differ from those we have left 
behind.” 
Two meanings are implicit in 
Dr. Johnson's observation and they 
both foreshadow the twofold path that 
the modern age was to take. The first 
concerns the separation between man 
38 
Velazquez 
and Nature, a separation that would 
later turn into an antagonistic relation- 
ship and a struggle between them, 
with man considering that his mission 
was no longer to save himself but to 
dominate Nature. The second im- 
plication has to do with the separation 
between man and man. The world 
ceases to be one world, an indivisible 
totality. It is split into Nature and 
Culture, and Culture is broken up into 
cultures. 
So we have a multiplicity of 
languages and a multiplicity of 
societies. Each language constitutes 
a way of looking at the world, and 
each civilization is a world in itself. 
The sun that the Aztec poem glorifies 
is different from the.sun the Egyptians 
worshipped, even though the astro- 
nomical body is the same. 
For over two centuries philosophers 
and historians, and now anthropol- 
ogists and linguists, have been 
accumulating proof that the differences 
between individuals, societies and 
periods are irreducible. The major 
division, scarcely less fundamental 
than the one established between 
Nature and Culture, is that which 
separates primitive from civilized 
peoples. Then come the variety and 
heterogeneity of cultures. 
Differences spring up within each 
culture. The very languages that 
enable us to communicate . be w en 
ourselves also confine us in an in- 
visible network of sounds and mean- 
ings, with the result that nations 
become prisoners of the languages 
they speak. Each language spawns 
Goya 
its own divisions in the form of 
historical epochs, social classes and 
successive generations. Individuals 
may belong to the same community, 
but each one is isolated, walled up 
alive in his own skin, 
All this ought to have discouraged 
translators, but it has not done so. 
On the contrary, there is a contra- 
dictory and complementary tendency 
to translate more and more. The 
reason for this paradox is that, on the 
one hand, translation does away with 
the differences between one language 
and another; and, on the other hand, 
it brings them into greater prominence, 
because through translation we become 
more fully aware of the fact that other 
people speak and think in ways that 
differ from ours. 
In one sense the world seems to us 
like a collection of differences, and in 
another like a pile of texts, each one 
slightly different from the one before 
it, resembling translations of trans- 
lations of translations. 
Each text is unique, yet at the same 
time it is the translation of another 
text. No text is entirely original, 
because language itself is essentially 
a translation. In the first place, it 
translates from the non-verbal world. 
Then, too, each sign, each sentence, 
is the translation of another sign, 
another sentence. This reasoning may 
even be reversed without losing any 
of its force and we may assert that 
all texts are original because every 
translation is different. To a certain 
extent every translation is an original 
invention and thus constitutes a 
unique text,

### 49652: On translation; the noted Mexican writer reflects on the delicate art of striking the right balance

  
What the discoveries of anthro- 
pology and linguistics condemn is not 
translation itself but a naive view of 
translation, or in other words literal 
translation which is significantly re- 
ferred to in English as slavish. lt is, 
of course, possible to translate literally, 
but this is not translation. It is 
generally no more than a string of 
words intended to help us read a text 
in its original language. As such, it is 
more like lexicography than translation. 
In any event, even in cases where 
it is only necessary to convey the 
meaning, as in scientific works, trans- 
lation always implies a transformation 
of the original. Such transformation 
is necessarily literary because trans- 
lation is an operation that makes use 
of the two modes of expression to 
which, according to Roman Jakobson, 
all literary processes can be reduced, 
namely metonymy and metaphor. 
The original text never reappears in 
the other language: this would be 
impossible. Nevertheless, it is always 
present because, although the trans- 
lation’ does not explicitly state as 
much, it refers to the original text 
constantly, or else converts it into a 
verbal object that differs from it, yet 
reproduces it by metonymy or meta- 
phor. Both of these, as distinct from 
explanatory or free translations, are 
strict forms that are not incompatible 
with exactness. Metonymy is an 
indirect description; metaphor is a 
verbal equation. 
Poetry has always been considered 
the form of writing that lends itself 
least to translation. This prejudice is

surprising when we stop to think that 
many of the best poems in every 
Western language are translations, and 
that many of these translations have 
been made by outstanding poets. 
Some years ago Georges Mounin, 
the French critic and linguist, pointed 
out that it is usually admitted—grudg- 
ingly, to be sure——that the denotative 
meanings of a text can be rendered 
into a foreign language, whereas it is 
almost unanimously held that the 
connotative meanings cannot. 
Poetry contains overtones, reflec- 
tions and relationships between sound 
and sense. It is a tissue of con- 
notations, and these are deemed un- 
translatable. | confess that this view 
goes against my grain, not only 
because it conflicts with my conception 
of the universality of poetry, but 
because it is based on a false notion 
of what translation really is. 
My ideas are not shared by 
everyone, however. | Indeed, many 
modern poets assert that poetry 
simply cannot be translated. But they 
are perhaps moved by an infatuation 
with verbal material and have been 
caught in the snare of subjectivity. 
Language becomes a landscape and 
that landscape in turn is an invention, 
the metaphor of a nation or an 
individual. It is a verbal topography 
in which everything is communicated 
and everything is translation. Sen- 
tences are mountain chains and the 
mountains are the signs and ideo- 
grams of a culture. 
But the play of resonances and 
verbal interrelationships, while intoxi- 
lon and creation, 
twin operations in art and literature 
Painting as well as literature offers 
notable examples of the art of translation. 
The famous work by Velazquez, Las Meninas 
(Ladies-in-Waiting) painted in 1656 and now 
in the Prado Museum, in Madrid (far left) 
was used as an original for works by two 
equally celebrated artists: Goya and 
Picasso. About 1780, Goya “translated” Las 
Meninas by transposing it from painting to 
engraving. Hisversion (centre)isnowin the 
Petit Palais Museum, in Paris. Picasso's 
“translation” of Velazquez’ masterpiece 
is a bold departure from the original and 
bears the imprint of his own genius. 
Left, the first of 45 variations of 
aspects of Las Meninas painted by Picasso 
"in four months during 1957. 
cating, conceals a certain danger. 
Surrounded as we are by words on 
all sides, there comes a time when 
we suddenly feel dumbfounded and 
alienated by the anguish of living with 
names instead of things. Sometimes 
it even seems strange to have a name 
of one's own. Federico Garcia Lorca 
wrote: 
Here amid the bulrushes in the late 
[afternoon, 
How odd that | should be named 
[Federicol 
This experience too is universal. 
Garcia Lorca would have felt just as 
strange had he been called Tom or 
Pierre or Chuang-Tzu. Losing our 
name would be like losing our shadow, 
but to be only our name is to be 
reduced to being a shadow. The lack 
of conformity between things and their 
names is doubly unbearable. Either 
significance disappears, or the things 
themselves seem to vanish. A world 
of exclusively abstract meanings is just 
as unappealing as a world of things 
devoid of meaning and nameless. 
Language is what makes the world 
livable. The amazement at being 
named Federico or So Ji is immediately 
followed by the invention of another 
name, a name which in a sense is a 
translation of the previous one, the 
metaphor or metonymy which, without 
pronouncing it, implies it. 
In recent years, owing perhaps to 
the ascendancy of linguistics, there 
has been a tendency to minimize the 
eminently literary nature of trans- 
lation. Actually, there is no such 
thing as a science of translation, nor

4 can there be, though translation can 
and should be studied scientifically. 
Just as literature is a specialized 
function of language, so translation is 
a specialized function of literature. 
But what about translation machines? 
If these devices one day succeed in 
really translating, they will then be 
performing a literary operation no 
different from that which translators 
now accomplish. * They will be turning 
out literature. Translation is a task 
in which, apart from the requisite 
knowledge of languages, what is 
decisive is the translator's initiative, 
whether this be taken by a machine 
that man has “programmed” or by a 
human being surrounded with dic- 
tionaries. 
Arthur Waley's words are convincing 
here: “A French scholar wrote re- 
cently with regard to translators: 
'‘Qu'ils s'effacent derriére les textes et 
ceux-ci, s'ils ont été vraiment compris, 
parleront d’eux-mémes." [Let them 
efface themselves. The texts, if they 
have been properly understood, will 
speak for themselves] Except in the 
rather rare case of plain concrete 
statements such as ‘The cat chases 
the mouse’, there are seldom sen- 
tences that have exact word-to-word 
equivalents in another language. It 
becomes a question of choosing 
between various approximations... 
have always found that it was I, not 
the texts, that had to do the talking.” 
It would be hard to add a single word 
to this statement. 
Theoretically, poetry should be 
translated only by poets, but in point 
of fact poets are rarely good trans- 
lators because they almost invariably 
take someone else's poem as the 
starting point for a poem of their own. 
A good translator does just the 
opposite: his aim is to produce a poem 
that is similar to, though not identical 
with, the original poem. He only 
departs from it in order to follow it 
more closely. A good translator of 
poetry is a translator who is also a 
poet—like Arthur Waley—or a poet 
who is also a good translator—such as 
Gérard de Nerval when he translated 
the first Faust. 
The reason why many poets are 
+ unable to translate poetry is not purely 
psychological in nature—though the 
cult of self does enter into it—but 
functional. * Poetic translation, as | 
shall try to show, is an operation 
similar to poetic creation, except that it 
is executed in reverse. 
Every word has a certain number of 
possible meanings. When a word is 
combined with others to form a sen- 
tence, one of its meanings is singled 
out and becomes predominant. Mean- 
ing tends to be univocal in prose, 
whereas one of the characteristics of 
poetry, as has often been noted, and 
possibly its chief quality, is that it 
retains the several meanings of a word, 
In reality, this is a property of 
language in general. Poetry accen- 
40 
tuates it, but it is also to be found in 
everyday speech and even in prose. 
Critics have lingered over this dis- 
turbing particularity of poetry without 
noticing that the mobility and in- 
definiteness of its meanings is paral- 
leled by another equally fascinating 
particularity, namely the immobility of 
its signs. Poetry transforms language 
radically and in a direction opposite to 
that of prose. In the one case, the 
mobility of signs coincides with a 
tendency to establish a single mean- 
ing; in the other, the plurality of mean- 
ings coincides with the immutability of 
the signs. 
Language is a- system of mobile 
signs which, to some degree, may be 
interchangeable. One word may be 
replaced by another, and every sen- 
tence can be put in another way 
(translated). We may say that the 
meaning of .a word is always another 
word. If we wish to prove this, we 
have only to realize that each time we 
ask “What does that sentence mean?” 
the answer is always a different 
sentence, ) : 
Once we enter into the realm of 
poetry, however, words lose their 
mobility and their interchangeability. 
A poem has many shifting meanings, 
"but the words of a given poem are 
unique and irreplaceable. To alter 
them would be to destroy the poem. 
Without ceasing to be a language 
poetry transcends language. 
The poet, caught up in the whirl of 
language—which is a constant verbal 
coming and going—selects a few 
words, or is selected by them. He 
fashions his poem by combining them 
and it then becomes a verbal object 
made up of irreplaceable and irre- 
movable signs. 
HE translator's starting point is 
not language in motion, which 
is the poet's raw material, but the fixed 
language of the poem. It is a frozen 
language, and yet it is quite alive. His 
operation is the opposite of the poet's. 
He is not called upon to forge an un- 
changeable text with changing signs, 
but to take that text apart, set the 
signs in motion again and return them 
to the language. Up to this point the 
translator's work is similar to that of 
a reader or critic, since every reading 
is a translation, and every criticism is, 
or begins by being, an interpretation. 
Reading, however, is a translation 
within the same language and criticism 
is a free version, or more exactly a 
transposition, of the poem. For the 
critic a poem is the jumping-off place 
towards another text, his own, whereas 
the translator, using another language 
and different signs, must compose a 
poem similar to the original. or 
Thus at the second stage the trans- 
lator's activity is comparable to that of 
the poet, but with this important differ- 
ence: when the poet writes, he does 
not know what his poem is going to 
be like; when the translator translates, 
“he knows that his poem must re- 
produce the poem he has before him. 
Translation and creation are twin 
operations. As the cases of Baude- 
laire and Ezra Pound show, it is often 
impossible to distinguish translation 
from creation. Moreover, there is a 
constant give and take between them, 
a continual and mutual creative 
influence. The great ages of poetry 
in the West, from the time of its origin 
with the Provencal troubadours down 
to our own day, have been preceded 
or accompanied by the interweaving 
of various poetic traditions. These 
cross-currents have sometimes taken 
the form of imitation and at other times 
that of translation, 
From this point of view the history 
of European poetry may be looked 
upon as the history of the mingling 
of the many traditions that go to make 
up what is known as Western litera. 
ture, not to mention Arabic presence 
in Provencal lyricism or that of haiku 
and Chinese poetry in modern poetry. 
Critics study “influences”, but this 
term is equivocal. It would be better 
- to consider Western literature as a 
single whole in which the central 
figures are not national traditions— 
English, French, Portuguese or German 
poetry—but styles and trends. 
No trend or style has ever been 
national, not even the so-called 
“artistic nationalism”. All styles have 
been translinguistic. John Donne is 
closer to the Spanish poet Quevedo 
than he is to Wordsworth; there is an 
evident affinity between Géngora and 
Marino, but there is nothing except 
the Spanish language to connect 
Géngora with the Archpriest of Hita, 
who in turn is sometimes reminiscent 
of Chaucer. 
Styles are collective and pass from 
one language to another; written 
works, rooted in their verbal soil, are 
unique. They are unique but not 
isolated, for each of them is born and 
lives in relation to other works in 
different languages. 
In every period European poets—and 
now those of the two Americas as 
well-—write the same poem in their 
several languages, and each of these 
versions is likewise an original and 
different poem. 
The synchronization may not be 
perfect, but if we withdraw a bit, we 
find that we are listening to a concert 
in which the musicians, playing ‘differ- 
ent instruments and without following 
any orchestra leader or score, are 
composing a collective work in which 
improvisation is inseparable from 
translation, and invention is closely - 
bound up with imitation. Occasionally 
one of the musicians launches into an 
inspired solo. The others soon take 
their cue from him and then go on to 
introduce variations, while the original 
motif becomes lost in the .new 
creation.

Global pattern 
of TV traffic 
The American share of the world market 
for TV programmes is declining while 
British, French and German exports are 
increasing, according to a recent Unesco 
report. “Television traffic—a one-way 
street?” by two Finnish researchers, 
Kaarle Nordenstreng and Tapio Varis, 
reveals that American programmes still 
take the lion's share with estimated sales 
abroad of between 100.00 and 200,000 pro- 
gramme hours per year. However, Amer- 
ican programme exports declined from $100 
million in 1970 to $85 million in 1971. The 
British are the second largest exporter of 
TV programmes. 
Folk Tales from Asia 
Folk Tales from Asia (Books I and ll), 
recently published, mark the start of a 
co-publishing venture to provide Asian chil- 
dren with reasonably priced illustrated 
books. This co-publishing programme is 
carried out in co-operation with Unesco by 
the Asian Cultural Centre for Unesco-Tokyo 
Book Development Centre. Book | of Folk 
Tales from Asia presents stories from Ban- 
gladesh, India, Korea, Iran, Laos, Singapore, 
Thailand and Viet-Nam. In book Il are sto- 
ries from Indonesia, Japan, Khmer Republic, 
Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philip- 
pines and Nepal. The 18 countries partici- 
pating in the programme will use the En- 
glish editions to produce editions in their 
own languages. (See “Bookshelf”.) 
Order of the Golden Ark 
Remembering the Biblical stofy of Noah, 
who took a pair of every animal aboard 
his ark to save them from the Flood, 
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands has 
created the order of the Golden Ark, an 
award to recognize “special service ren- 
dered to the conservation of flora and 
fauna”. Prince Bernhard, a champion of 
conservation, is president of the World 
Wildlife Fund. 
A future for our past 
A recent Unesco television film, “A 
Future for our Past”, shows restoration and 
preservation work carried out with Unesco 
aid on monuments and cities in various 
parts of the world, including Abu Simbel, 
Philae, Carthage, Florence, Venice, Machu 
Picchu and Borobudur. This 13-minute 
16 mm. colour film is available in English, 
French, Spanish and Russian language ver- 
sfons. For further information, write to

European Architectural 
Heritage Year 
The Council of Europe has proclaimed 
1975 “European Architectural Heritage 
Year” to mark the culmination of its 
campaign for the protection of European 
buildings of historic and artistic merit, 
launched in 1973. One aim is the adoption 
of a European charter designed to give 
legal force to measures for preserving the 
character of ancient towns and cities and 
for the adaptation of old buildings to 
modern uses. 
International book award 
for Japanese publisher 
The first international book award honour- 
ing outstanding services to the cause of 
books has been awarded to a leading 
Japanese publisher, Shoichi Noma, for his 
leadership in the movement to develop 
Asian book publishing. The award has 
been made by the International Book Com- 
mittee, which groups the principal profes- 
sional organizations concerned with books. 
Mr. Noma is the founder of the Toiyo 
Book Development Centre for Asia, set up 
following a Unesco conference on book 
development in Asia, held in 1966. 
The world’s 
water problems 
Man today depletes or pollutes his fresh 
water reserves at the rate of 300 cubic 
kilometres a year. Ways of easing the 
present water shortage were examined 
recently by an international hydrological 
conference at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris. 
The conference, organized jointly by 
Unesco and the World ‘Meteorological Or- 
ganization, reviewed the achievements of the 
International Hydrological Decade launched 
by Unesco in 1965. It adopted an ambitious 
international hydrological programme for the 
five years ahead, stressing scientific 
research into the problems of drought and 
the effects of pollution on water resources. 
Protecting the monuments 
of Cyprus 
Monuments and works of art In Cyprus 
have suffered less than might have been 
feared from events on the island last year, 
reports a Unesco mission which made an 
on-the-spot investigation. The mission 
found that the castles of Kyrenia and 
Pathos and the Lala Mustapha mosque in 
Famagusta have only been slightly 
damaged. The important mosaics unearthed 
in Paphos are damaged but not beyond 
hope of restoration.

AFRICA'S RAIL PROBLEMS 
Sir, 
Maaza Bekele suggested worthwhile 
ideas for improving living conditions In 
Africa (your July-August 1974 Issue on 
population). Nations on other conti- 
nents probably could benefit by using 
some of her thoughts. 
Specifically, she suggests, “...a move 
towards economic co-operation between 
and among African nations, which 
together can provide a market large 
enough to admit of viable trade.” 
A study of the map of Africa reveals 
problems. The typical rail line runs 
from the seacoast to the interior and 
has few, if any branches. So trade is 
favoured with overseas nations as 
connexions to adjoining nations are rare. 
Even building important connecting 
links will not be enough because the 
existing lines are built to five or 
six different gauges. Remember that 
England built the first commercial steam 
railroad in 1825, but it wasn't until 1892 
that the last wide-gauge line was 
converted to the -national standard. 
Experience has been the same in 
other major industrial nations: A 
national uniform gauge is necessary for 
speedy and efficient movement of 
people and goods. Even better Is 
where several adjoining nations use the 
same gauge.

THE FOUR BILLION 
POPULATION QUESTION 
Sir, 
Your “World Population Year”, issue 
answers the question Cain asked, "Am 
| my brother's keeper?"—*“Yesl” 
That answer raises more questions. 
Grant that the population prob- 
lem (current world population nearly 
4 billion) in all its ramifications, with 
all its implications has been made clear 
to every nation, to every community 
of man. 
One nation forbids birth control. 
That nation’s population grows faster 
than the nation’s ability to provide 
gainful work or food for its people. 
Must other nations support one nation 
that will not help itself? 
Another nation is rich. Its people 
eat more than they need. They waste 
while others hunger. Because they can 
pay, they use for pleasure resources 
which poorer nations could employ to 
produce food. Should the better 
situated share with those who have not 
even the basic necessities? 
An underpopulated country claims 
that it must have more men and women 
to develop its dormant resources. Will 
the benefits from the development flow 
equally to all? Or is the call for un- 
hindered breeding a device for per- 
petuating present extremes of wealth 
and poverty? 
A nation regulates its agriculture and 
its industry, and its farms and factories 
do not pollute the air, the water, the 
soil. Can that one nation, or a 
consortium of nations take steps to stop 
another nation’s harmful practices? 
Each nation insists that it must decide 
Letters to the Editor  
for itself what it can and will do for its 
people without interference from others. 
Your writers on the population prob- 
lem realize that a nation can hurt itself 
when it disregards the welfare of others. 
René Dumont says that change, con- 
tinuance of acceptable life on thls earth 
“will often require as an inescapable 
condition the abolition of privileges, 
and consequently a genuine social 
revolution.” 
The only effective way to move 
nations to act for the common good is 
through education, persuasion, appeal 
to immediate as well as to long term 
self interest. Is there time enough for 
education to become effective? What 
else can we do? 
While making best use of the time 
he has, man should think also of the 
other life with whom he shares the 
world. In all his concern with survival 
man acts as if he were creations most 
important product. 
All that lives is brother to man. 
When man controls his own numbers, 
while he encourages the others to 
multiply, the world will support, and will 
keep man and his brother.

FRIENDS OF UNESCO 
Sir, 
Recently we organized a youth club 
of “Friends of Unesco” whose members 
are 17 to 30 years old. Our aim is to 
publicize Unesco’'s work and to get 
acquainted with the cultural heritage and 
the present state of science and edu- 
cation, literature and art of other 
countries. We do not know much 
about how similar clubs work in other 
countries, and would be glad to hear 
more about the organizations that 
support the United Nations and Unesco.

BOTANICAL ENIGMAS 
OF THE PAMIRS 
Sir, 
Your article, “Enigmas of the Plant 
World of Central Asia” (November 
1974), on studies by Soviet scientists 
of the paradgxical botanical wealth of 
the Pamirs made fascinating reading. 
The luxuriance of the vegetation in this 
region is quite astounding. 
The author suggested several expla- 
nations: ultra-violet radiation, which in 
the Pamirs Is 50 per cent higher than 
normal; intense solar reaction due to 
the transparency and dryness of the air; 
enormous fluctuations in temperature, 
etc. In my opinion, however, two 
fundamental causes were omitted, the 
main one being the extremely high 
radioactivity of the soil. 
Before World War ll, French scien- 
tists and researchers discovered that 
application of radioactive substances in 
carefully controlled doses had Important 
stimulating effects. on plant growth. The 
soil of the Pamirs plateaux must 
contain a high percentage of silica, 
and pure silica is extremely radioactive. 
The second cause, linked to the first, 
must lie in the very small amount of 
clay in the soil, for clay and all its 
derivatives are effective Insulators of 
certain currents and rays—electrical, 
magnetic, radioactive, etc.

Sir, 
As an engineer and scientist, | read 
with great pleasure Anatoly V. Pokrov- 
sky's article on the plant world of the 
Pamirs. 
However, | am surprised that the 
author did not mention the possible 
role of cosmic rays, which may provide 
an explanation of these botanical mys- 
teries. Between 2,500 metres and 
3,800 metres above sea level, at the 
latitude of the Pamirs, there must be 
quite a heavy bombardment of protons 
and muons, capable of causing other 
biological effects than those which may 
derive from the intensification of short- 
wave or ultra-violet rays in the solar 
spectrum, or from the purity, trans- 
parency and dryness of the air, etc. 
In any case, Mr. Petrovsky's absorb- 
ing article clearly demonstrates that the 
work of the Pamirs Botanical Institute 
is of fundamental importance to the 
study of world plant biology.

LITTLE-KNOWN 
OCEANIA 
Sir, 
The “Unesco Courier” has published 
a great deal on the cultures of various 
countries and peoples, and rightly so. 
But what about the peoples of Oceania 
and their original culture which still 
holds many a mystery and riddle? 
The average reader knows much less 
about the history and peoples of 
Oceania than he does about Africa and 
South America, since both these conti- 
nents have been widely discussed in 
popular science books and fiction.

CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST RACISM 
Sir, 
| would like to call your attention to 
a question of current concern which 
| find deeply disturbing: racism in 
France today. 
Arab workers are the chief victims 
of this racism. Although latent until a 
few months ago, it erupted through 
pressure by certain right wing groups. 
The situation reached the point where 
a government minister recently announc- 
ed that a public Information campaign 
is to be launched to highlight and 
explain the problem in order to count- 
eract the action of racist groups. 
By participating in this campaign and 
publishing facts and figures you would 
help people like myself who are In 
contact with large numbers of workers.

THE TIMELESS ART OF BUILDING 
BEL TELCRCLL ESSER ERC ROUTER SENS CI CHE CIDE RCLIECLR UIE ERE EL EEE LR eastern coast of Tunisia, 
are today being built in increasing numbers throughout the country (in foreground, wall of house; in rear, 
village mosque). Traditional architecture in all parts of the world provides countless examples of buildings 
in which beauty and functional qualities have been combined harmoniously for many centuries. Unesco has 
launched a series of studies on these forms of architecture, many of which offer an immense untapped 
‘source of inspiration for modern builders. See article page 4.
