### 94907: Interview: Oliver Stone

OLIVER STONE 
talks to Mahmoud Hussein 
and Régis Debray 
    
One of America’s leading film-makers, Oliver Stone 
has won several Oscars for best film and best 
director. He has made many big hits, including 
Scarface (1983), Platoon (1986), Wall Street (1987) 
and JFK (1992). He follows political and social 
developments in the United States closely and 
describes them uncompromisingly. Here he talks 
about his commitment and the conditions under 
which film directors operate. 
 
M You have made several films dealing 
with very sensitive matters. That is not 
easy. In the movie business, it isn’t a 
question of wanting to do something 
then going and doing it, is it? 
—No, it’s never easy, because the stu- 
dios want to make money. That's always 
the issue with movies like this: if you 
take on a large subject that’s contro- 
versial, you're going to upset a certain 
group of people. That doesn’t generally 
help the movie; people think it does, 
but many people stay away if there’s 
controversy. 
WM That wasn’t the case with Platoon, 
your film about the Viet Nam War, 
was it? 
  
  
—Platoon caught the national mood 
when it came out. President Reagan 
was about to invade Nicaragua, there 
was a feeling we were going to be drawn 
into another war, and there was a gen- 
uine curiosity, eighteen or twenty years 
after the event, about the Viet Nam war. 
People were getting tired of Reagan. 
The Oliver North trial had just hap- 
pened in 1986, and opinion was begin- 
ning to turn against the militarization of 
the country. So I think the timing of 
the movie was just right. 
BW Was there an autobiographical ele- 
ment in the film? 
—Platoon is based pretty much on my 
own experiences in Viet Nam. I was in

### 94907: Interview: Oliver Stone

the 25th Infantry and the 1st Cavalry. 
It was not straight autobiography, I 
fictionalized the story and ran charac- 
ters together. 
You don’t see much when you’re in 
combat, but I felt that every platoon 
that I was in was divided into the 
people who were more sensitive to the 
Vietnamese and the people who were 
insensitive to what we were doing in 
Viet Nam. There was a moral division 
inside each combat unit. I thought the 
same about America when I got home. 
It was very divided between what they 
called the hawks and the doves. Most 
people were neutral, but there were 
strong opinions on both sides. I fought 
with my father, with my family. I felt 
very alienated. I tried to deal with those 
feelings in a film I made about coming 
home, Born on the Fourth of July. 
BW We often bear from the American 
film industry that cinema is entertain- 
ment. When Hollywood turns to bis- 
tory, accuracy is hardly the main con- 
cern. How do you feel about this? Must 
entertainment come first? 
—That’s two different questions. I 
agree that movies are entertainment. A 
good movie has to grip you. Most 
people don’t want to sit for two hours 
in the dark watching a documentary, so 
you have to introduce the element of 
tension, the thriller element. I think 
[ve been able to deal with relatively

with Kevin Costner during the 
filming of JFK (1992). 
serious subjects in my movies and 
make them intriguing, so that people 
want to see them. There are a million 
films made, in Europe or even in 
America, that, let’s face it, nobody 
wants to see. They don’t want to see 
life down on the farm if there’s nothing 
to hook their attention. You know, the 
sun comes up, the sun goes down, the 
farmer washes his laundry. . . . But if 
the farmer has a daughter and—ahal— 
she gets involved with some rich guy, 
then the complications start, that’s 
when the audience gets interested. 
BW Let’ look a little further into what 
you call the thriller element. Is it always 
simply a matter of good guy versus bad 
guy, or can it be more complicated than 
that? 
—Good movies play with your idea of 
who the villain is. You think some 
character is the bad guy but he’s not. 
The good guy turns out to be the vil- 
lain. So movies are not that simplistic. 
In Alfred Hitchcock’s films you rarely 
know who is going to do what to 
whom. In Vertigo, is the woman bad or 
good? In Notorious, is Cary Grant bad 
or good? We play with identity in 
movies. 
I have to agree that the film business 
has notoriously bungled history. It’s 
famous for it. We've made heroes of 
some very hollow people, no question

about it. We would have made films 
about Senator Joe McCarthy if he 
hadn’t been found out. J. Edgar Hoover 
was a hero in my country until recently. 
But history is always being changed 
and rewritten. Shakespeare made a vil- 
lain out of Richard III and history says 
he was essentially a good king. Why 
blame Hollywood? Historians them- 
selves should be held to account, 
because we are always re-examining 
history. A historian like Arthur 
Schlesinger reinvents American his- 
tory to his liking, making a hero of 
President Andrew Jackson, for 
example. George Washington has been 
reinterpreted several times. Thomas 
Jefferson has been reinterpreted as a 
slave-owner, a good guy, a bad guy. 
Abe Lincoln’s the only one I know 
who seems pretty much to have gotten 
away with it in American history. 
A scene from Salvador 
(1986). 
B You say that history is reinterpreted 
every few years in America, but one 
thing that doesn’t change is the pre- 
sentation of Mafiosi and gangsters 
as heroes in American films. Why is 
there this perversion of the idea of the 
hero? 
—The glorification of the Mafia in our 
country is sick. As great as Coppola’s 
two Godfather films are, they are, I 
believe, historically wrong in 
attributing this degree of power to the 
Mafiosi when they are really a bunch of 
thugs who have done much to corrupt 
the country via organized labour, busi- 
ness—the liquor business, Las Vegas, 
the jukebox business—kickbacks for 
politicians, and so on. Gangsterism in 
our country goes back before the 
Italian Mafia, back to Boss Tweed, the 
Irish Mafia, the ugly Mafia that existed 
in the time of George Washington. 
There were all kinds of gangsterism in 
American life. To glorify it as we have 
done 1s, as you say, a perversion. 
BW But why do American audiences 
respond to these films? 
—1J think it’s because we were revolu- 
tionaries, because we were mostly out- 
casts from Europe, because we have a 
tough-guy strain. We don’t like being 
shoved around by authority, which is 
not a bad quality in some ways. We 
admired Bogart and Cagney, but they

Television footage used in 
JFK, with Martin Luther King 
in the centre. 
were sentimental gangsters, movie 
gangsters. 
BW When you made JFK, for example, 
did you think of it as a militant film? 
—7Yes, in a sense. I didn’t give the 
Warren Commission’s version of events 
because it had been defended for years 
by the establishment and the media. I 
touched a very sensitive nerve in JFK 
when I attacked the media, saying that 
the cover-up was not only the work of 
certain people in government but was 
propagated by the media, who accepted 
the story without doing any home- 
work—and they didn’t do any. 
The power of the media is, I think, 
one of the biggest problems in my 
country. The newsrooms of CBS, 
NBC, ABC, Newsweek, Time, the 
New York Times—there are fifteen or 
twenty of them and they all think alike, 
they plug the same agenda over and 
over again. When Clinton came into 
office, they forced this young man to 
consider the agenda their way. They 
force the issue by putting tremendous 
pressure on somebody new who may 
want to address the situation in a new 
way. I think this is a distorting effect of 
the First Amendment, whose authors 
couldn’t have guessed how strong the 
media would become in the electronic 
era. I don’t know the solution. You 
have to have freedom of speech, but it’s 
  
reached insane proportions when it’s 
really control of speech, not freedom. 
BW Why is there this consensus among the 
twenty or so centres of power in the 
media? 
—1I can’t tell you where it starts, but 
there’s a decision that certain things will 
be on the agenda, that they will make 
those things the issue of the day or of 
the month. One time it may be home- 
lessness or taxes, another time it will 
be why the military must be supported 
in Iraq or whatever. As LE Stone said, 
the press are like blackbirds, they all 
take off from the telephone wire at the 
same time and when one comes back, 
they all come back. We’re living in an 
Alice-in-Wonderland society where 
from one month to the next we stagger 
from one issue to another. We are told 
what is important for that month. I 
resent that. 
I went to Viet Nam as a result of a 
media onslaught that convinced us we 
had to prevent it from being the next 
  
domino to fall to communism. The 
media messed this country up terribly 
with that one. With the Kennedy 
murder, they all lined up behind the 
idea of the lone gunman firing three 
crazy bullets and killing the President, 
although there is little factual evidence. 
BW Why exactly did you make JFK? 
—1I think Kennedy was killed for polit- 
ical reasons, to remove him from power. 
First of all because, as of 1963, there 
was a significant change in his policies 
and the way he viewed the world. He 
made a deal with Khrushchev; the two 
of them signed the Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty in 1963. He was talking to Castro 
behind the establishment’s back. He 
had signed a memo to pull out of Viet 
Nam. This is not speculation: the doc- 
ument exists, he signed it, it’s called the 
National Security Action Memo- 
randum 263. Only recently Robert 
McNamara finally admitted that 
Kennedy was going to pull out of Viet 
Nam.

  NE En ea ell _ m 
There was a significant accelera- 
tion of intention when Lyndon 
Johnson took over. On the very day 
Kennedy was buried, as I showed in 
the movie, Johnson called an emer- 
gency meeting with General Maxwell 
Taylor and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to 
push the Viet Nam agenda. There was 
a meeting in Honolulu the day that 
Kennedy was killed about the subject 
of Viet Nam. It’s a fascinating story, 
   
   
what went on the last two or three 
days before he was killed. 
BW Did you have free access to all the 
archives? 
—The archives in America are like they 
are in Russia, they’re opened but by 
the time the public gets to know of 
them they've been reviewed and cen- 
sored by the bureaucratic process. A 
new legislation was passed, that the film

helped create, opening up the Kennedy 
files. Anything that might endanger 
national security has to be reviewed by 
a special board of people appointed by 
the President. 
I'm sure that Kennedy, if he had 
lived, would have ended the Cold War 
with Khrushchev in the late sixties, in 
his second term. It’s interesting that 
very shortly after Kennedy was killed, 
Khrushchev was ousted. I think there’s 
a linkage between the fates of the two 
men. That's why I think the subject is of 
such importance, not just to American 
history but to world history in the 
twentieth century. 
B JFK is a mixture of stockshots and fic- 
tion. Were some of the stockshots in fact 
staged? 
—We staged most of it. There are some 
genuine stockshots in the beginning, 
but not as many as people think. The 
autopsy sequence, for example, was all 
staged except for one very clear shot 
of Kennedy at the end. You’ll see that 
his face was intact, which is interesting 
because if he had been shot from behind 
the face would have been blown away. 
B The docudrama element—the inter- 
linking of fact and fiction—gives the 
film its aesthetic impact. But perbaps 
that mixture raises a moral problem too. 
—I’ve heard that criticism. My answer 
is, it’s a war. You ripped off this country, 
you told this story no holds barred, 
you fought dirty and I'm fighting you 
the same way, I steal things left, right 
and centre. Yes, I was militant.

### 94907: Interview: Oliver Stone

MW What difference did the film make? 
—All films find their way into the 
country’s subconscious in the end. I 
think what it changed was trust in the 
government. Around twenty million 
Americans saw it. And I don’t think 
any young kid now will buy the story 
that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone 
gunman. The papers don’t say that so 
much now. They think twice before 
saying it. 
BW Would it be possible to make a film in 
the United States now about the Amer- 
ican attitude during the Gulf War, with 
President Bush as hero or anti-hero? 
—That’s another Orwellian story. It’s 
not for me, it’s for some other movie- 
maker. Someone said to me that the 
  
Gulf War wasn’t a war, itwasa TV film. 
Nobody got killed on our side and we 
didn’t even know there were all those 
people killed on the other side. There 
were six Time magazine cover stories 
about the situation before the war 
started, and by the end of it Saddam 
Hussein looked like Hitler, complete 
with the moustache. He was demo- 
nized in the American consciousness, 
made out to be a monster. We were 
ready to go out and kill. It was a hor- 
rible time to live through because again 
you saw the way patriotism came out.’ 
MW You mention patriotism. In the 
golden age of cinema, Americans were 
proud of Hollywood. Now foreigners 
are buying into Hollywood and maybe 
in a few years they’ll have bought 
it out. What do you think of this 
situation? 
—The film business is a land without 
frontiers. You work for different people 
in your lifetime, different producers, 
people you never thought you would 
team up with. JFK was made with 
French, Israeli, German money. The 
Italians put up money for The Doors, 
the English for Salvador and Platoon. 
That's what's good about the film busi- 
ness. All these international players like 
to be in on the game. 
W You approve of that? 
—Of courseit’s a good thing. How else 
would movies get made? They need an 
enormous concentration of capital.

### 94907: Interview: Oliver Stone

BM What about creative freedom? Are 
you allowed it? 
—Only if you can get away with it. If 
you make a film that makes money, 
they like you. I just got by by the skin 
of my teeth. Salvador missed out at 
the box office, but Platoon was a hit, 
and then I got carte blanche for the 
next couple of films. They were both 
successful, so then I was able to make 
Born on the Fourth of July, which also 
did well. That gave me a little more 
freedom, so then I decided to go for 
JFK. They would never have let me 
do JFK in the beginning, but they did 
at that point of my career, and it 
worked. 
BM Why was Salvador not a success? 
~—Politics. When it came out in early 
1986, we were still in the grip of Rea- 
ganism. The critics were not very kind. 
The New York Times said it was a typ- 
ical Costa-Gavras kind of propaganda 
effort. Yet most everything of that film— 
including American complicity—has 
emerged in the last ten years as a truth. 
WM Do you sometimes feel like a latter- 
day knight errant? Knights were priv- 
ileged people but they also bad duties, 
they were defending sacred values. Do 
you feel both this privilege and this 
duty? 
—That’s very true. It’s a special situa- 
tion. You must use your power well to 
    
 
make films that are difficult to get made. 
Otherwise you'll lose it. 
Right now is a good time for me to 
make difficult movies. I just finished 
Heaven and Earth in Thailand and Viet 
Nam. It’s the story of thirtysome years 
in the life of a Vietnamese peasant 
woman. It was not an easy film to make. 
WM Are you working especially for an 
American audience, or do you feel the 
world is your audience? 
—Most of my films have made more 
money abroad than in America. JFK 
made twice as much abroad. The films 
are going well internationally. I feel I 
need a world-view to understand my 
own life better. I always think film- 
makers tend to underestimate the power 
and intelligence of the audience’s sub- 
conscious mind. 
BM Not only that, maybe. Perbaps people 
want, at least sometimes, to be stirred by 
noble causes? 
 
  
  
—JFK didn’t make any commercial 
sense. It was three hours long, it had lots 
of dialogue and it was complicated. But 
I said I'm going to make this movie, it 
will bomb but I have to make it. I never 
really thought it would be easily under- 
stood by medium range audiences. But 
they did understand it. It was one of the 
great experiences of my life. It proves 
that people are more intelligent than 
they’re given credit for. Even if they 
don’t understand everything at first, 
they’re willing to sit there and see it a 
second time, on video or something, to 
fill in the gaps. 
MW How do you explain the world- 
wide fascination with Hollywood 
films and with American popular 
culture in general? 
—The world is a satellite world now, 
and America 1s on the cutting edge. 
People like the music, they buy it; they 
like the look, they buy the clothes; they 
like the hamburgers. .... Youth wants to 
be free from the shackles of the adult 
world and old ways of doing things. 
It’s more fun—F-U-N. And many Hol- 
lywood movies evoke the concept of 
fun. They’re light, they’re entertaining. 
. I think that’s the answer. 
BM But not all Hollywood films have 
had the same success. . .. 
—Maybe they didn’t have the right 
lightness of being. ||

WHAT IS MODERN? 
 
What do we mean by “modern”? The concept is elusive, ambiguous, ever- 
changing. It is a paradox, constantly disputed, that refuses to be pinned down 
by even a tentative definition. That which is modern is that which defies its 
own definition, or is defined in negative terms, by what it is not. 
There are modern things, not only objects but also functions, qualities 
and forms of behaviour. Compact discs are modern and so are organ trans- 
plants and concern for the environment. A taste for superlatives is one fea- 
ture of modernity, whether applied to the prowess of athletes or the soft- 
ness of detergents. Extremity of scale is another, one might think—the 
minuscule in electronics, the gigantic in architecture. 
Perhaps the best way to understand “the modern” is to take a cluster of 
modern phenomena and to see what signs, clues and images they reveal. 
Acting on this assumption, we asked men and women from different back- 
grounds, cultures and walks of life—artists, designers, writers, architects, 
musicians, philosophers, doctors, engineers—to investigate the concept of 
modernity. To help them on their way we suggested 2 number of ideas, clues 
and keywords such as fragmention, the act of seeing, disorder, miniature, 
new, audio and invisible. 
As it happened, some of these clues did not lead far. However, new 
pointers emerged. Where they led to can be seen on the following pages, in 
a compilation of images and “signs of the times” that illustrate some of the 
innumerable manifestations of modernity.

### 94888: Modern times, new approaches

Modern 
times, 
new 
“approaches 
by Aya Wassef 
E are confronted nowadays with an 
endless stream of new products and 
ideas—new brands of detergent, new 
biscuit flavours, the latest issue of the news- 
paper, new economic and social policies, 2 new 
world order—and we might be tempted to think 
that if something is new then it is by definition 
modern, that the very word new is enough to 
give the cachet of modernity to anything it is 
used to describe. Newness today would thus 
seem to be a kind of short cut to modernity, 
rather than standing in an obvious or causal 
relationship to it. ) 
The widespread use of the word new is 
symptomatic of both a state of affairs and a 
state of mind. New things have always been 
made, but the emphasis on newness as a selling 
point has not always existed, still less the craze 
for new things. Common sense long decreed 
that a new object was one that had not been 
tried and tested, that it was not necessarily sound 
and might even be dangerous. 
THE NEW IS DEAD, 
LONG LIVE THE NEW! 
Today’s perception of newness is very different. 
A thing must be new in order to be acknowl- 
edged as modern. Novelty is the price of moder- 
nity—whence the paradox of a so-called 
“modern” or even “post-modern” society that 
still seems, through its frantic quest for nov- 
elty, to be in search of its own modernity. 
The European pioneers of Modernism sig- 
nalled that they were breaking with tradition by 
co A _% 
ascribing an intrinsic value to newness. This 
choice of the new as a symbolic value was an 
invitation to take a leap in the dark, to run the 
risk of destabilizing generally accepted ideas, 
but whereas for these intellectuals and artists 
modernity signified a break with the past, within 
our modernized society newness has gone its 
own way. 
Modernity has gone hand in hand with sci- 
entific progress and discovery, industrializa- 
tion, mass production, the consumer society, 
the growth of the media and their increasing 
influence on culture. With the development of 
branches of trade and industry based on new 
products, newness has come to be accepted as a 
fact of life. It has lost its originality and its rev- 
olutionary connotations as the symbol of a 
break with tradition, its sense of being ahead of 
its time. It has lost its modernity. The consumer 
society demands a rapid turnover of new prod- 
ucts, making sure that what’s new today is obso- 
lete tomorrow. The opposite of new is no longer 
old, but old-fashioned, yesterday’s novelty that 
has fallen out of favour. This is an ephemeral 
form of newness, greeted with fanfares simply

because for a fleeting moment it is new. The 
new, the supreme triumph of the present over 
the past, has become the ultimate expression of 
a modernity that has reached fever pitch. 
A NEW LOOK 
AT THE OLD 
Thus emptied of its substance, the new has 
become the vector of the dominant values of 
our societies. Through constant media expo- 
sure, it has taken over the media. A new product 
is more efficient, nouvelle cuisine is healthier, a 
new computer 1s more user-friendly, a new 
lifestyle 1s more environment-friendly, new tele- 
vision is more interactive. Consumer goods are 
marketed by associating them with the appeal of 
qualities such as efficiency, environmental aware- 
ness, conviviality and comfort. They offer each 
individual a slice of modernity and people buy 
them in order to claim the values enshrined in 
them—in other words, to be modern. 
A value considered modern in a society here 
and now 1s not, however, necessarily so regarded 
elsewhere and at a different time. In a space-time

faster and ever more sophisticated means of 
communication, modernity seems to play tricks 
with history and geography. When something 
modern originating in the Western industrial 
nations—the so-called “North”—is exported 
to the “South” there is a certain time-lag, so 
that what is modern in the South is a thing of the 
past in the North. 
Conversely, what is traditional in the South 
is modern in the North. In the “developing” 
countries, newness and modernity are often 
associated with the acquisition of objects, of 
products from the West, which itself went 
through this phase some time ago. Modernity in 
the industrialized countries, on the other hand, 
is often related to a new way of looking at some- 
thing that already exists; paradoxical as it may 
seem, “going back to one’s roots”, rediscov- 
ering in the present the values of the past, is 
thus a modern phenomenon. 
Significantly, “naturalness” is one of the key 
values in a form of modernity that promotes 
respect for the natural environment, ecology, 
wellbeing, and the health-giving properties of 
organically-grown foods and of natural medicine 
based on ancient traditions. Naturalness as such 
is not new; it is the appeal that it holds for us 
today, as a significant new value, that makes it 
modern. 
THE LOGIC 
OF THE NEW 
This new approach to what already exists is dis- 
tinctively modern: it is the logic of the new—the 
process whereby something new is created from 
what went before—rather than newness in itself, 
that is modern. 
The artist who synthesizes images out of 
images of the real world reduced to digital form 
in a computer, the architect who turns a railway 
station into a museum, the fashion stylist who 
borrows sophisticated materials from the space 
industry to create a garment, the designer who 
fashions a piece of furniture from recycled mate- 
rial—all these are creating something new by a 
process of diverting and reshaping, by bor- 
rowing, reassembling and changing meanings. 
These are the defining characteristics of an atti- 
tude, today considered modern, in a society 
that has broken loose from any kind of histor- 
ical perspective and settled into a continuous 
present: new things are wrought from old, dis- 
tant things are brought to our own doorstep, and 
everything is seen throught the prism of moder- 
nity—this is the logic of the new. 
The logic of the new is a logic of retrieving 
and reassembling. It scorns the passage of the 
years, bringing together in space things that are 
far apart in time. The logic of the new is indeed 
distinctively modern. |

HEN people describe their experience of 
communications technology and rapid 
intercontinental travel, they often say 
that we live in a shrinking world. This is an image: 
the world is not really shrinking. In a more literal 
sense, however, many of the instruments and 
appliances we regularly use are, because of tech- 
nological advances, becoming smaller—so small 
in many cases that it would be no exaggeration to 
say that miniaturization is one of the defining— 
and disconcerting—features of life today. 
Miniaturization is a process that gives rise to 
many questions and very few answers. What /s 
miniaturization, exactly? At what point is some- 
thing miniaturized? Do we have some notion

by Arik Levy and Pippo Lionni 
that 2 manufactured object—a camera or a tele- 
phone, say—~can have a “right” or optimum size? 
If so, by what standards is this normal size 
defined? Now that a pocket-sized electronic 
device has the capacity to store the contents of a 
pile of documents on an office table, what is hap- 
pening to the rules that have traditionally gov- 
erned our ideas of proportion? 
What, furthermore, are the psychological and 
physiological implications of miniaturization? 
After all, the shape and size of the objects which 
surround us inevitably influence the relation- 
ship we have with them. In this dynamic inter- 
action between objects and people, the minia- 
turization of one element in the relationship 15

implies more than just a reduction in size. A tele- 
vision set reduced to the size of a pack of playing 
cards is no longer a piece of furniture in the same 
proportion to a chair, a table or a cupboard, and 
the moving image on its screen is no longer com- 
parable to the static image of a painting hanging 
on a wall or a magazine cover. We can pick up a 
miniature television and carry it around with us. 
It becomes an extension of our bodies. It is easier 
to find a place for it in our home. Our reaction to 
the relative smallness of objects is important 
because it suggests that there may be a limit to the 
hitherto seemingly unchecked race towards 
miniaturization. As things get smaller and smaller, 
the fingers that manipulate them seem to be get- 
ting bigger and bigger... .. 
Miniaturized objects can be seen as “envi- 
ronment friendly” inasmuch as they are designed 
to take up the least possible space and consume 
the least possible energy and other resources. At 
the same time they enable us to free ourselves 
from the constraints of place and time: one 
response to the hostile subway environment is to 
retreat into the auditory isolation of a personal 
stereo. Of course there may be limits to the user- 
friendliness provided by miniaturization, which,

if taken too far, would literally become a reductio 
ad absurdum. It would, for example, be techni- 
cally possible to produce an issue of this magazine 
that would be, say, one-twentieth of its present 
size, thus saving ink, paper, time, mailing and 
transport costs. Unfortunately the magazine 
would have become impossible to read with the 
naked eye. 
Miniaturized consumer products such as 
microcomputers and digitally-controlled portable 
telephones are becoming familiar features of 
everyday life. In Japan a minute robot named 
“Monsieur” has been developed using wristwatch 
technology. It is driven by an ultra-small, super- 
energy-efficient motor with an extremely compact 
quartz crystal oscillator that enables the micro- 
robot to make precise, shock-resistant movements 
over an extended period. “Monsieur” has many 
potential applications in industry and medicine. 
Imagine a microrobot being injected into your 
body and sent crawling around it to carry out a 
check-up and if necessary perform repairs. 
Not all objects seem destined to be shrunk. 
Furniture, clothes and cooking appliances, for 
example, will no doubt undergo fundamental 
changes in the years to come, but though they 
may become minimal, it is doubtful whether 
they will become much smaller. |

towards the very small, from Japanese bonsai 
trees to computer chips. Are they unconnected, 
or are they two different facets of the same mod-

Those who discuss modernity in the present 
tense must necessarily include themselves in the 
subject under discussion, for modernity can only 
be defined in relation to a given moment in time. 
That moment is thereby defined, either implicitly 
or explicitly, as a break in the time continuum of 
a civilization or culture, and no break can be 
more noticeable or indeed spectacular than one 
that startles the eye by disproportionately 
enlarging familiar features of the beholder’s envi- 
ronment. This tendency to make things appear 
new by enlarging them finds expression in the 
familiar myth of the Tower of Babel, in which the

challenge of monumentality translates the desire 
to transcend the limits of the human. The urge to 
build ever bigger would indeed seem to satisfy 
modern man’s need to leave some lasting monu- 
ment so as to outlive the vagaries of time. 
In the nineteenth century this attitude became 
more systematic and widespread than ever before. 
The engineering feats of the Industrial Revolution 
paved the way for an ever-increasing number of 
colossal construction projects: this was the age of 
stations built like cathedrals, department stores 
resembling temples, and factories disguised as 
castles. The context of daily life was radically 
altered as urbanization progressed. Cities came to 
express the all-conquering power of attraction of 
modernity. 
Then space began to grow scarce under the 
pressure of such overweening ambition. Satura- 
tion-point loomed. To survive, modern man 
invented a new, equal and opposite approach, a 
steady reduction in the size of objects that were 
regarded as taking up too much space. “Small is 
beautiful” could be the motto of twentieth-cen- 
tury technology, for miniaturization has been 
an overriding concern in the development of 
electronics, information technology, office and 
household automation and telecommunications. 
Gigantism and miniaturization are two coex- 
isting aspects of the same desire to control space 
with the aid of increasingly complex technologies. 
By using intelligence in this way, modernity 
shows itself to be a manifestation of power. In the 
all-out search for efficiency, the attraction exer- 
cised both by the very large and the very small has 
pushed aside concern for harmony and its corol- 
lary, wisdom. Modernity calls for the inordinate. 
In some respects this attitude could well be a 
new form of hubris, the concept of impious 
flouting of the natural order that the ancient 
Greeks used to describe the condition of bar- 
barity. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the mas- 
sive and the miniature come together in the 
atomic bomb, whose vast destructive power is 
matched by its small size. 
Our contemporaries may be barbarians, but 
they are Titans too, constantly courting danger by 
daring to shake established norms to their foun- 
dations. n

### 94893: The Sky horizon

The sky horizon 
by Edmond Petit 
| 
EDMOND PETIT, 
former reconnaissance pilot 
and a founder member of 
France’s National Air and 
Space Academy, is the author 
of many published works, most 
recently a history of aviation 
entitled Nouvelle histoire 
mondiale de I'aviation (Paris, 
1991). 
was in the sky, and earthbound humans 
sought to imitate it. 
In the words of the French poet Saint-John 
Perse, “The bird . .. by encouraging humans to 
fly, alone emboldened them afresh.” 
Once people had worked out how birds flew, 
i N the beginning was the bird and the bird 
- they mistakenly believed that they could make 
wings for themselves and that they would be 
strong enough to work them. 
While waiting for wings that worked—and 
above all for an engine to power them—the 
people of Antiquity (which was, after all, modern 
in its day) first made imaginary beings fly: gods 
and demi-gods, heroes and spirits. To this we 
owe the story of Icarus (not forgetting the 
inventor Daedalus, his father), a recurrent theme 
in the literature and imagery of every age. 
We read of magic carpets, feathered capes, 
winged horses. . . and of how humankind’s first 
imagined flights were borne on the pinions of 
griffins, eagles or geese. Before aspiring to take 
flight unaided, man first acquired experience of 
falling: one after another, the would-be birdmen 
of old crashed to the ground. 
Then one day a visionary came close to 
finding the answer. Leonardo da Vinci seems to 
have foreseen flying machines, helicopters, para- 
chutes. To judge from his notebooks, he may 
even have experimented with such devices. 
Some time later, the French philosopher René 
Descartes exchanged instructive letters with Pere 
Mersenne on the question of “whether the art of 
flying is possible... and if men can fly as high, as 
far and as fast as birds. ...” 
The French fantasist Cyrano de Bergerac 
devised “six ways of violating the virgin skies”. 
The Marquis de Bacqueville donned wings to 
try to fly across the Seine, and Father Gallien 
surmised that “the art of aerial navigation” might 
lie in letting oneself be carried along on “air- 
rafts” by currents (jet-streams, perhaps?) “at the 
altitude where hail forms”. 
INGENIOUS FLYING MACHINES 
Oddly enough, all these precursors of flight came 
up with the same prescription: all that was 
required was to devise “an ingenious mecha- 
nism”. The formula crops up again and again, but 
is never accompanied by further details. As early

as 1250, the English philosopher Roger Bacon 
suggested that “Flying machines could be con- 
structed in which men, seated or suspended in the 
centre, could turn cranks that would operate 
wings to beat the air.” 
The project was in the air... . 
talking about it except scientists. 
In 1782, an influential and respected mathe- 
matician and astronomer by the name of Joseph 
Jérome de Lalande, a member of the French 
Academy, affirmed that “if men of learning keep 
silent, it 1s not through contempt. Rather it is 
demonstrably impossible, in every sense, that a 
man could rise into, or even stay up in, the air. . ... 
Only an ignoramus would try to do so.” 
In 1783, Pilatre de Rozier answered him by 
taking off on the first balloon flight, accompanied 
by the Marquis d’Arlandes. 
Soon Victor Hugo was enthusing: 
And Newton's science flies away 
Riding a Pindaric ode?’ 
Writers, scientists and engineers such as 
Nadar, Jules Verne, Mouillard, Cayley, Marey 
and Lilienthal made calculations, speculations, 
experiments. 
In 1890, Clément Ader became airborne. The 
aircraft had taken off at last. In their monoplanes 
and biplanes, pilots were no longer floating but 
Everyone was 
  
flying. They had been along time on the drawing 
board, these flying machines! 
One pioneer aviator, the French engineer 
Gabriel Voisin, pointed out that “heavier-than-air 
flight does not start with anything as clever as the 
wheel. Its i nspiration 1s the wing, rather as if, 
instead of relying on wheels for land transport, we 
had developed a vehicle with mechanical legs.” 
Jean Cocteau repeated the remark to me, going on 
to add: “Wings are growing shorter and starting 
to disappear “altogether. They are turning into 
fins. The bird 1s becoming a fish.” There you 
have the history of acronau rtical engineering ina 
nutshell! 
After the Wright Brothers, the pioneers gave 
way to the sportsmen. Then it was the warrior’s 
turn. Considerable advances were made in avia- 
tion between 1914 and 1918, With the return of 
peace, further progress was made in exploring the 
planct. Oceans and mountains were conquered. 
Records were broken. 
A danger remained. As carly as 1759, Samuel 
Johnson had written: “If men were all virtuous 
. I should with great alacrity teach them all to 
fly.” A second world war intervened, crueller, 
more frightening, more modern than its pre- 
decessor. But aircraft are not to blame for all the 
harm humankind has done with them. Instead, 
reflect on Charles Lindbergh’s words: 
“Hiroshima was as far from the intention of 
the pure scientist as the Inquisition was from the 
Sermon on the Mount”. 
Progress continued to be made, to the benefit 
of civil aviation, which became safer. With the first 
jets, the power of engines increased threefold. It 
was time to take another step forward and, as the 
French poet Jules Supervielle put it, “to colo- 
nize the stars”. 
A NEW DIMENSION 
Is transient modernity anything more than a 
matter of scene-shifting? Time has already lost 
much of its importance and distance is a dated 
concept. We have conquered a new dimension. 
Should we not call it a new freedom? As Jules Roy 
has noted, “the speed a spaceship must attain to

escape the Earth’s gravity is called escape 
velocity.” 
Have we finally escaped, and if so from what? 
In continuing down the road that has led from the 
prehistoric age of Gagarin to the glorious present 
promised for tomorrow, fresh questions arise. 
Are there boundaries to space? Is the sky the 
limit? 
Here on Earth, there is no cause for alarm as 
long as speeds can still be measured in relation to 
the speed of sound. It will be time to start wor- 
rying when people start talking about the speed 
of light. But by then robots may have taken the 
place of human beings. u

### 94896: The Devalued image

  
The devalued image 
by Sonia Younan 
N times gone by, images were drawn, engraved 
or painted on a physical support, in an enclosed 
space which took on meaning from the pro- 
jection onto it of the latent physical attributes of 
the subject depicted. The way in which this space 
was organized had its roots in a physical, 
Dionysiac quality which situated it in time and 
thereby linked it to music, to what Nietzsche 
called that “total dance whose rhythm stirs the 
whole body.” In The Birth of Tragedy, the German 
philosopher described all the plastic arts as aspiring 
to the condition of music, which is pure sym- 
bolism and is independent of either image or con- 
cept. The plastic arts are merely the projection of 
what he called “sparks of imagery”, the draping of 
the Apollonian veil of beauty around the subject. 
The Dionysiac principle is one of communion 
and fusion with the whole universe. The artist 
must triumph over subjectivity, find deliverance 
from the self, and become the vector of cosmic 
energies. Itis through this process of “unselving” 
that the wisdom of art is attained. 
The whole of a picture bears the imprint of the 
body and its mystery. In Leonardo’s magnifi- 
cent draperies, the body is suggested by inden- 
tations, its very absence enabling it to orchestrate 
even more effectively the Apollonian display of 
draperies and highlights. What is shown is less 
significant than what is left in shadow. The lines 
take on meaning only insofar as they condense 
the temporal nature of the painter’s gesture, 
because they exist as music before being pro- 
jected into the spatial dimension. In a corre- 
sponding fashion, the movement of the viewer’s 
eye as it “browses on the canvas” unlocks many 
meanings. In his Theory of Modern Art, the Swiss 
painter Paul Klee stresses the idea of the work of 
art as genesis and describes the trajectory of cre- 
ation in this way: “The first movement in us, 
the active, operative movement, directed towards 
the work of art, and then the transmission to 
others, to the viewers, of the movement con- 
tained in the picture.” A snapshot appears to us 
less truthful than a painting precisely because it

1s cut off from this two-way process that takes 
place over a period of time. 
THE AESTHETICS 
OF BANALITY 
What has happened? Apollo has lost touch with 
Dionysus. Space has become dissociated from the 
body whence meaning could emerge. Machines 
have taken over from the eye of the beholder. 
Disconnected from the ways in which subjects are 
perceived, images are no longer defined in relation 
to reality but in relation to one another. 
In hyperrealism, painting has found a high- 
definition style of its own. In the words of one 
hyperrealist painter, “photography is not the last 
word in realism”—nor is reality itself, one might 
add, as the hauntingly accurate detail in this form 
of painting confirms. Richard Estes’ paintings, 
 
worked up from dozens of different photographs, 
recreate urban landscapes caught in the inter- 
play of multiple reflections and frames. They 
show us what the human eye could never see, 
such as an image reflected in a shop window and 
an object inside the window both rendered with 
the same degree of definition. Hyperrealism, 
with its sharp focus and flattened perspective, 
presents a smooth, uniform painted surface that 
calls for no cffort of the imagination. The frontal, 
rectilinear gaze of the camera lens has taken the 
place of the eye, with its curving field of vision and 
its aura of possibilities. By interposing between 
spectator and subject a series of technological 
intermediaries, it destroys the original status of the 
subject, which becomes the mere adjunct of a 
piece of viewing apparatus. Is it fortuitous that the 
painter’s signature is often reversed, one more

reflection among others? The painters of the 
Renaissance endeavoured to recreate a humane 
vision of the world, portrayed in depth, where 
light emerged from shade, a vision in which 
necessity had its place, a fragile conquest snatched 
from the jaws of a universally prevalent contin- 
gency. Driven by an obsessive desire for trans- 
parency, hyperrealism teaches us that there is 
nothing below the surface, in short that there is 
nothing to sce. 
When perception is dissociated from imagi- 
nation, we are left with banality, tautology, liter- 
alism. The psychoanalyst Sami Ali describes 
banality as “the end of projection”, “the disap- 
pearance of all emotive assocations”, the absence 
of an inside/outside polarity. “It is a ‘reality’ that 
is both immediate and final,” he claims, “cut off 
from the historical process of which it is the cul- 
mination and no longer bearing in itself any trace 
of the labour of negation”. When temporality is 
eclipsed by an absolute positivity, and imagina- 
tion—the faculty of saying no—is taken away, we 
are left in a situation where everything is 
reversible, where copies outrank originals, the vir- 
tual is indistinguishable from the actual, and 
reality is no more than a special effect. 
A SURFEIT OF IMAGES 
An intricate web of relationships has been woven 
between the different types of image produced by 
painting, photography, the cinema, video and 
computer graphics. This rivalry and this mutual 
fascination are illustrated in the films of the 
German director Wim Wenders, for example in 
the relationship between Jonathan and Ripley 
in The American Friend. Jonathan, a picture 
framer, lives in a workshop filled with the smells 
and materials of his craft and in the ambit of the 
painterly culture, based on the act of secing. In 
one scene he is the only person at an auction 
who spots subtle differences of shades of blue that 
reveal some of the works to be fakes. He is the 
embodiment of the Apollonian ideal of the Beau- 
tiful, that of the circumscribed, the sober outline, 
the frame. With Ripley, the American friend of the 
title, we are taken into the realm of the immate- 
rial, an unchecked flow of symbols, of specula- 
tion. A parallel is suggested between money, the 
generalized form of commodities, and images, the 
generalized forms of reality. Ripley is defined 
only through external symbolism, through the 
objects that surround him. At one point he takes 
Polaroid photographs of himself lying on a pool 
table; eventually the proliferating images cover his 
whole body. The death of the original is con- 
summated in the triumph of the copies. Else- 
where we see him taping himself and later playing 
back the recording, as though his self-awareness 
can only be sustained by means of the fragile 
traces recorded by a machine. Ripley, a post- 
modern character, finally draws Jonathan into 
his own ambit, that of the sublime reduced to the 
level of the quantitative. The turning-point of 
the film is marked by a shot of Jonathan smashing 
a picture frame in his workshop. The smashing of 
the frame symbolizes the relentless onward rush 
towards the limitless, the sea, death. .... 
Restoring to images their innocence... . In his 
book The Act of Seeing, Wim Wenders discovers 
in seeing the possibility of latent truth that is 
“obscured by words, by past events, by opinion.” 
This return to true perception, unencumbered by 
judgements and opinions, is close to the idea, 
advocated by phenomenology, of getting back to 
things in themselves. It means learning to sce 
things with the cyes of childhood again. This 
possibility tends, however, to disappear as the 
number of images we are exposed to increases. 
High-definition systems allow images to be 
reproduced ad infinitum without any loss of 
clarity and with unlimited possibilities for manip- 
ulation. Digitized and insubstantial, the high- 
definition image does not deteriorate like a film

negative. It makes the concept of “originality” 
entirely meaningless, and the special effects to 
which it is subjected leave no trace. 
Wim Wenders wants to make the cinema a 
focal point of resistance to this loss of meaning. 
“The cinema,” he writes, “must represent, for 
each image, a last bastion of this sense of the 
image.” The transition from a pictorial culture to 
the “cra of technical reproduction”, to repro- 
ductions of works of art, to photography, the 
cinema and finally the electronic image, has been 
responsible for an increase in the quantity of 
images that constitutes “one of the most serious 
sicknesses of our civilization”. 
The cinema has a memory of its own, its own 
highly- developed language. To quote Wenders 
again, “cinematographic language i ts a powerful 
medium that leaves its imprint on everything it 
produces”. Video is easier to handle and more 
spontancous but lacks this “capacity for taking 
shape”. Its language is basic: instead of con- 
structing a diachronic development it breaks time 
down into a succession of instants, and it aban- 
dons the cinematic pan shot in favour of the 
close-up. The relationship between film and 
video is the same as that between an original and 
a copy. The proliferation of video images is indeed 
a disease, a malignant tumour that thrives to the 
detriment of organic growth. In Nick’s Movie, 
Wenders shot the cancer-stricken Nicholas Ray 
in video because video seemed to him like a 
cancer within the film itself. Hence, tn order to 
check the progress of a disease that the French

sociologist Jean Baudrillard has called “the con- 
tamination of things by the virus of images”, and 
their “unlimited pullulation”, the video image 
must be reinserted into the cinematic framework, 
marked with its imprint, filled out with the 
organic quality, the meaning and the memory 
that it presently lacks. 
ABSORBED BY THE ‘BLOTTING 
PAPER’ OF THE SCREEN 
In his critique of Wagner, Nietzsche poured scorn 
on the signs of a modernity that sought to attain 
the infinite grandeur of the sublime but only 
succeeded in achieving the ultimate in triviality, 
that of sound reduced to its component parts, 
bereft of all organic linkage. The decline from the 
sublime to the quantitative is paralleled by the 
way in which the new technology of the image 
absorbs us so that image and viewer become one 
and actually causes our perception to regress by 
eliminating the distance that is an integral part of 
our way of sceing. 
“We used to stand in front of the image, now 
we are inside the visual environment.” In Vie et 
mort de l'image, une histoire du regard en Occi- 
dent, Régis Dcbray stresses the the importance of 
the clement of distance in visual perception. 
“Sceing,” he writes, “means standing back from 
the thing seen, distancing oneself, cutting oneself 
off.” The perception of sound is more archaic; lis- 
tener and sound become one. In the world of 
the audiovisual media, seeing undergoes annex- 
ation by listening, “visual noise” is superimposed

### 94896: The Devalued image

upon audio noise. “The visual environment has 
virtually become a sound environment.” We are 
caught up in a process of absorption, in what 
the French critic Paul Virilio has called the “blot- 
ting paper” cffect of the screen. 
The omnipresence of images and the speed 
with which they are transmitted relieve us of the 
necessity to imagine an elsewhere, to project our 
thoughts through time and space. Everything is 
here and now; everything comes to us without 
our having to go anywhere. The cult of live 
transmission, immediacy and the close-up con- 
_ spire to make us believe we are in direct contact 
© with events; but as Marshall McLuhan has taught 
us, the medium is the message, events are indis- 
sociable from the trace they leave, and the only 
present is the presence of the image. Removed 
from the opaque order of visible culture, the 
image has been subjugated by the strategy of 
communication and promoted for its own sake, 
regardless of any meaningful content. 
To prevent the imagination from crumpling 
under the impact of high-speed transmission and 
to restore to images their lost innocence, we need 
to disconnect image from sound—which is no 
longer recorded on separate tracks as in the cinema. 
We must halt the flow of images, and resist the 
seductive power of immediacy. If we do, perhaps 
we shall witness the return of what Wenders calls 
the truth potential. It takes time for meaning to 
come across. [n Proust’s great novel A la recherche 
du temps perdu, the taste of a small cake—a 
madeleine—brings back buried memories from the 
past, a past relived as the present. Images only 
take on meaning again when they are related to our 
own mental images, integrated into our own time- 
frame, vibrating in sympathy with our bodies, 
the storehouse of our memories—the body, what 
Nietzsche called our “great reason”. 
THE MYSTERY 
OF APPEARANCES 
In Michelangelo Antonioni’s film Blow-up, the 
plot revolves around a photograph taken in a 
London park. When the photo is developed it 
reveals a dead body that Thomas, the photogra- 
pher, had not noticed when he took it. The eye of 
the camera captures something that remained 
invisible to the naked cyc. But Thomas then 
decides to blow the image up bigger and bigger, 
and again the mystery cludes us. By dint of 
zooming in closer and closer we are left with the 
meaningless mosaic of the grain of the film, as 
meaningless as the grain of Albertine’s skin is to 
the narrator in Proust’s novel. The pervasive use 
of close-ups and the zoom lens drags us down 
into what Baudrillard calls the “blank obscenity” 
of a transparent universe. “Where does this crazy 
idea come from,” he asks, “the idea of being able 
to reveal the secret, to expose the naked sub- 
stance, to touch the ultimate obscenity? The idea 
itself is utopian—there is no reality, there never 
has been; the power to allure lies i n realizing this 
and preserving the mystery.” 
In order to rediscover the allure of appcar- 
ances, to guard against “blank obscenity”, the 
mystery of the body needs to be reinvented. In 
The Draughtsman’s Contract, by Peter Green- 
away, the English film director and painter, the 
architectural drawings of a country house play a 
part in the plot, like Leonardo’s draperies, giving 
depth to the cinematographic image. They cannot 
be deciphered as a poster can; they yield up the 
memory of past events in minute doses. The 
murder clues are revealed through a subtle inter- 
play of appearances and disappearances. The 
time-frame of the film and the logic of its plot are 
organized around the drawings, and the true 
mystery ts the one played out in the arrange- 
ment of lines, values and chiaroscuro. Works of 
art, as the German philosopher Martin Heidegger 
says, always hold themselves “in reserve”. The 
painter meets his death perhaps because he dis- 
covered the murderer but more certainly because 
he was unable to preserve the mystery of appear- 
ances, the innocence of images. 
DIGITAL FEVER 
In the beginning was the digit; the Word became 
software and dwelt among us, to adapt the 
French writer René Berger's phrase. Video, com- 
puter graphics, holograms—the new visual tech- 
nologies detach themselves from the familiar 
forms of our perception and hitch themselves to 
Joan of Aragon, by Raphaél 
and his studio.

digits. Computer-generated images usher in the 
age of simulation, where virtual reality prevails 
over reality itself. 
The relationship between art and these tech- 
nologies is a problematical one. Whereas the 
artist’s approach sidesteps conceptualizations, 
digging below the specificities of the real world 
to capture the totality of experience, digital 
imaging does the opposite, making the specific a 
fall-out from the idea of the universal. The arust 
becomes a computer operator, and the transcen- 
dency of the work of art implodes somewhere in 
the networks. As Michel Jaffrenou has pointed 
out, “the proliferation of networks, that spider’s 
web that is being spun around the whole world, 
that fluidity that is seeping into all communica- 
tion, means that works created on screens can be 
fed into circuits, circulate through them and 
return almost immediately to the sender, trans- 
formed, interpreted and ready to go out again.” 
Moving and having their being in an intangible 
environment, absorbed into the networks, manip- 
ulated in the course of interactive communication, 
produced in real time, images are turning their 
backs on human beings and looking at one 
another. 
THE WISDOM OF LOVE VERSUS 
THE WISDOM OF THE IMAGE 


### 94896: The Devalued image

Other people reveal themselves to us above all 
through the expression in their eyes. This does not 
add any new significance to the image perceived 
by the senses; indeed, it emerges only if and when 
that image 1s destroyed. The endless fascination 
of the Mona Lisa reminds us how a gaze can 
convey the mystery of another person—we are so 
captivated by her gaze that we cannot look at her. 
The painting itself fades away, disappears, leaving 
behind the pure presence of another being. Who 
remembers the colour of the Mona Lisa’s eyes? 
Another person’s gaze 1s unbearable. The 
narrator of A la recherche du temps perdu not 
only keeps Albertine prisoner but can only tol- 
crate her when she is asleep, because, as he says, 
at such times her “personality no longer slipped 
away all the time, as it did when we were talking, 
through the channels of unacknowledged 
thoughts and looks. At such times, she seemed to 
have called back all that part of herself that was 
outside; she had taken refuge, enclosed and sim- 
plified, within her body.” The eyes are the channel 
through which the personality escapes and 
through which it must return. “Those closed 
eyelids,” Proust tells us, “laid on her face that per- 
fect continuity unbroken by the eyes.” 
The proliferation of images is the sign of a civ- 
lization that has forgotten how to sec, that erases 
all forms of otherness, a culture “with closed eye- 
lids”. Our response to the lure of an act of sccing 
that kept a distance between perceiver and per- 
ceived, to a love directed towards “the mystery of 
the Other”, to the transcendency of an art that pre-

### 94897: The Apple of my eye

A... green, yellow and red. Colours... . 
I have placed the red apple on the ground to 
paint it. The ground is ochre, the colour of 
scorched earth. There is a contrast. Consistent 
and indelible, oils are best for getting close to 
nature. Pigments. 
The smell of oils is not that of the colour of 
the apple. Energy of the senses. 
“Energy” is 2a word that crops up often. 
Nothing is certain. I went away for a 
moment, and my absence made itself felt in the 
silence, a unifying factor: “poly-presence”. 
Painting, watching colours appear on a flat 
surface. A black line weaves around the colours, 
which are obstinately pressed up against one 
another. Chance. 
Everything around gives off vibrations. The 
apple is fixed in the retina, but its colour vibrates 
somewhere clse. 
Watching the silhouette of the main object 
taking form. The apple is white on a white back- 
ground. Barely visible... . 
Apples are eaten. Apples rot. 
Cézanne proved that there is more to apples 
than that: there is beauty in them. The consis- 
tency of the colour builds up the object’ 
“unique” form—a kind of magic whose power 
can be transmitted and can be converted from 
one material to another. 
Physical sensation is consumed, like energy. 
A painting, 50.7 x 73.5 centimetres. 
Colour has a molecular structure, it reflects 
light equally for two bodies whose basic iden- 
tity differs materially. The similarity between the 
red skin of the apple and the colour of blood is 
artificial. When removed from any convention 
relating to form and given its freedom, colour 
enters the realm of universal abstract thought. 
The tree on which the apple grows is empty. 
The sun shrinks in volume. Seen through 
an clectron microscope, the pips of an apple 
contain a sequence of memories that have not 
been decoded. 
With the aid of X-rays, one can see that the 
artist sketched and painted in the pips before 
covering them over with green paint. Memory 
is something else again.

industrial fraud, infringement of patents, indus- 
trial espionage or whatever. Advertising goes 
all out to whet the consumer’s appetite, even 
resorting to deceit. Every product is presented 
as the best, the most competitively priced, the 
most efficient. All kinds of hype are used. 
Advertisers will stop at nothing to get their 
message across, including the exploitation of 
feminine charms. If customers are short of ready 
cash, they are offered casy terms, at least to start 
with. They may even be offered a car they can

THE LURE 
OF 
EASY MONEY 
Are the developing countries affected by this 
phenomenon? I believe they are. There 1s, for 
example, nothing new about young Africans’ 
infatuation with imported goods—after all, trade 
with the carly European explorers was based on 
Africans’ taste for luxury goods from abroad. 
The remarkable thing is the way in which this 
infatuation has spread to broad sectors of the 
African population since the Second World War. 
Several factors have been at work here. In 
Ghana, for instance, as air travel became more 
common in the 1940s and 1950s, the fact of 
having visited England, London in particular, or 
having studied in Europe conferred special status

on the happy few, in the eyes of the vast majority 
of their compatriots who had never left the 
country. They were known as the been-to, and 
with their higher social standing they set the 
fashion, especially among the young. 
To a certain extent, a desire for higher social 
status and material prosperity also motivated the 
struggle for political emancipation. What could 
once only be gained through education—and 
this was hard to come by—could now be 
obtained through success in politics, whatever 
one’s educational level. A new kind of politician, 
brought to power by a succession of coups 
d’étar, appeared on the scene, replacing one 
privileged class by another. 
Lastly, the lure of easy money and an affluent 
life-style has attracted many young Africans 
into occasional dealing in imported luxury 
goods. These small traders who travel back- 
wards and forwards between West Africa on 
the one hand and Europe and the United States 
on the other make no appreciable contribution 
to their countries’ economies.

A variety of small-scale drug traffickers 
follow the same route—there is now an under- 
ground market for drugs in Africa. The risks are 
enormous but the profits to be made are very 
tempting. The consumers are obviously after 
bigger kicks than they can get from more 
innocuous stimulants; in other words they too 
arc out for more. Drug abuse is not necessarily 
a modern phenomenon, but its spread is some- 
thing new. The incidents that have occurred in 
some universities and even some secondary 
schools, as well as among some of the soldiers 
involved in military coups, show that drug- 
taking is starting to spread among the young, 
THE HIGH LIFE 
In many ways, therefore, a growing number of 
Africans, traders, traffickers, adventurers— 
internationalized Africans, so to spcak—have an 
attitude towards the consumer society that 
scarcely differs from that prevalent in the United 
States or Europe. The taste for luxuries, for 
consumer goods—for the high life, in short— 
evident in the countries of the North has its 
counterpart in the countries of the South, with 
this difference, that its consequences, given the 
deprivation that afflicts most of our fellow- 
countrymen, are much worse. The spread, in 
some cascs the prevalence, of this constant 
sceking after more is one of the hallmarks of 
modern times. |

The spare parts syndrome 
by Bernard Teo 
Above, a liver transplant 
operation in a Paris 
hospital. 
| 
BERNARD TEO, 
of the Republic of Singapore, 
has been teaching moral 
theology and bioethics at the 
Yarra Theological Union in 
Melbourne (Australia) since 
1991. 
NE of the marvels of modern medicine is its 
ability to repair people’s lost or impaired 
bodily functions with artificial devices 
such as the pace-maker, the hearing aid, pow- 
ered limb prostheses and the dialysis machine. 
Organ transplantation represents a further step 
along this ingenious path. For patients suffering 
from vital organ diseases, organ transplantation 
may offer the only hope of survival. 
The capacity to repair human beings brings 
out the best in us. Unless we take care, however, 
it may also bring out the worst—our capacity to 
fragment ourselves and our communities, and 
our propensity to exploit and to dehumanize. 
Provided that there is a scrupulous regard 
for ethics in transplantation, the repairable human 
can be a powerful symbol of our shared humanity, 
adaptability and global interdependence, for suc- 
cess in organ transplantation would be impossible 
without national and international co-operation 
and exchange. To take one example, the devel- 
opment and widespread use of powerful 
immunosuppressives, which are crucial to the 
success of any transplant programme, are possible 
only because of international collaboration and 
a sense of compassion for the sick. 
Organ transplantation differs from other 
kinds of health care in that it depends upon full 
participation by the community. A government 
may legislate ethically sound transplant policies 
and commit sufficient resources to ensure the 
success of a transplant programme, but its efforts 
will be doomed to failure if the public is unwilling 
to donate organs and provide support. 
Many countries have adopted policies to 
ensure fair public access to donated organs, in 
recognition of a demand that factors such as ability 
to pay, race, gender, social status or religious beliefs 
should not be barriers to anyone who really needs 
a transplant. If a transplant programme is per- 
ceived by the public as denigrating a person’s 
humanity, or as introducing values that divide the

community, public goodwill and support in the 
form of donated organs may come to a halt. 
However, there is a great danger that trans- 
plant technology may encourage the objec- 
tivization of the human being into a mere col- 
lection of body parts, subject to exploitation for 
consumerist and utilitarian purposes. 
Proposals to allow commerce in human body 
parts constitute a fundamental attack on human 
dignity and identity. To turn human body parts 
into exchangeable commodities is to alienate a 
person from his or her bodily life and under- 
mine human dignity and identity. The humani- 
tarian and communitarian foundation of organ 
transplantation would be corrupted by such a 
consumerist approach. 
Trade in human body parts would also frag- 
ment the community, since it would transform 
communal relationships into those of contractual 
buying and selling; the poor would be exploited 
while the wealthy would be able to buy their 
way onto the priority list of transplant candi- 
dates. It would also undermine international 
goodwill. It is well known that wealthy transplant 
candidates from richer countries are in a position 
to purchase organs from the poor in poorer coun- 
tries, often under exploitative conditions, and 
that the poor are brought to the wealthier coun- 
tries to complete the commercial transactions. 
Such practices not only shift the problems of 
wealthier nations onto poorer ones, but also strip 
the poor of their dignity by turning them into 
commodities. There 1s an urgent need for inter- 
national co-operation to deal with these problems. 
Governments should make policies to control 
the situation, and impose penalties on their 
nationals who cross international boundaries to 
purchase organs from the poor. Those involved 
in transplant programmes should also screen 
patients and organ donors more thoroughly 
before beginning any procedure. 
Above all, the repairable human may reflect 
an extremely myopic view of life: an aggressive 
preoccupation with the preservation of our bodily 
life, regardless of the financial and human costs, 
points to an inability or refusal to confront the 
reality of human mortality and to address the 
question of whether the full meaning of human 
existence may not be more than the preserva- 
tion of life as we know it. |

THE I COURIER 
CCORDING to forecasts by the 
United Nations Environ- 
ment Programme (UNEP), 
if world energy consump- 
tion were to continue at its 
1990 level, oil reserves 
would last 46 years, coal reserves 
205 years and natural gas reserves 
67 years. In addition, the produc- 
tion and use of these fossil fuels 
are responsible for a constant 
increase in water, soil and above 
all atmospheric pollution by 
nitrogen oxides, sulphur and 
methane. The amount of carbon 
dioxide, which stood at about 6.3 
billion tons in 1988, could double 
by the year 2010. “By the end of 
the 1980s,” writes Mostapha K. 
Tolba, former Executive Director 
of UNEP in his book Saving our 
Planet (1992), “it had become 
clear that current trends in energy 
consumption—especially of fossil 
fuels—could lead to increased 
degradation of the global envi- 
ronment (from, for example, acid 
rain, urban air pollution and cli- 
mate change), undermining 
future development and well- 
being across the planet.” 
Presented as a “clean” form of 
energy, nuclear energy raised high 
hopes, promising cheap and 
abundant electricity. But the 
Chernobyl accident, aging power 
  
  
stations and the build-up of toxic 
wastes that are difficult to process 
soon cooled people's enthusiasm. 
In addition, this form of energy 
production is far too expensive 
and technologically too onerous 
for the developing countries. 
Although they are not high on 
the political or economic agenda, 
probably because oil is cheap, the 
so-called renewable energies— 
solar electricity, biomass, wind 
energy, ocean energy—have not 
been as successful as they deserve. 
And so Unesco has decided to 
organize this year an international 
conference on renewable energy 
sources, the World Solar Summit. 
The term solar is used symboli- 
cally to designate the different 
renewable sources of energy. The 
meeting, which will take place at 
UNESCO Headquarters in Paris 
from 5 to 9 July 1993 in close co- 
operation with relevant organi- 
zations, is designed as a summit of 
experts.

[HE WORLD MOLAR SUMMIT § 
A group of high-level special- 
ists will assess solar energy devel- 
opment in the two decades since 
a conference was last held on the 
subject by UNEsco in 1973. They 
will also explore the future of 
renewable energy resources and 
will consider the launching of a 
World Solar Energy Decade (1995- 
2005). The major objective, how- 
ever, will be to formulate a World 
Plan of Action to develop and use 
renewable energy resources effec- 
tively. 
The moment has come to assess 
the State of political and techno- 
logical progress in this field and to 
highlight the many advantages 
renewable energy sources offer for 
the environment, sustainable 
development, health, cleaner 
industry, a higher degree of energy 
security and self-sufficiency for 
nations. Research and develop- 
ment must be encouraged without 
neglecting the socio-cultural and 
educational aspects of the use of 
solar energy which could change 
our way of life. This mission 
UNEsco, within its fields of com- 
petence, is ready to undertake.

DOSSIER 
  
uLy 2893. A fleet of boats car- 
rying participants to a climate 
conference unloads its pas- 
sengers directly onto the 
twenty-sixth floor of the 
United Nations building in 
New York. The meeting is being held 
too late. As a result of global 
warming the polar ice caps have 
melted and the sea level has risen to 
the point that the twenty-sixth floor 
windows are now on the water level. 
This scene was described some 
years ago in a United Nations peri- 
odical in an attempt to sound the 
alarm about global warming. 
Although wildly exaggerated, it is 
part of a scenario linked to the 
greenhouse effect which has 
alarmed not only the inhabitants 
of low-lying islands such as the Mal- 
dives in the Indian Ocean, but also 
those of the Netherlands, where 
land reclaimed from the sea is pro- 
tected by dunes and dikes. The 
effects of such a scenario would also 
threaten Bangladesh, the Nile Delta, 
the east coast of the United States - 
and all flat coastal regions—a par- 
ticularly serious prospect since 70 
per cent of the world’s population 
lives less than 60 km from the sea. 
What exactly is the greenhouse 
- effect which has been so much 
written about in the last few years 
and has caused such widespread 
dismay? This is how the problem 
has been described so far. Radia- 
tion from the Sun penetrates the 
atmosphere and warms the Earth's 
surface, which then radiates some 
ofthe heat it receives back towards 
space. Some of this heat, which is 
vital for life on Earth and keeps 
water from freezing, escapes, but 
some is trapped—as if by the glass 
panes of a greenhouse—by gases of   
which there is an increasing build- 
up in the atmosphere such as 
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous 
oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
and tropospheric (low-altitude) 
ozone. Edward Goldsmith, who 
founded the British magazine The 
Ecologist twenty years ago, believes 
that atmospheric carbon dioxide 
concentration has increased by 25 
per cent since the beginning of the 
industrial era, that the methane

concentration has doubled, and 
that nitrous oxide and tropospheric 
ozone concentrations are increasing 
by 0.5 per cent each year. 
In their book The Earth Report, 
Edward Goldsmith and Nicholas 
Hildyard describe the greenhouse 
effect as “the most serious environ- 
mental problem facing the planet. 
There is some disagreement whether 
or not the rise in global temperature 
of 0.5° Centigrade in the last century 
is due to global warming caused by 
human activities or is a natural cli- 
matic fluctuation. However, it is 
almost unanimously agreed among 
climatologists that immediate action 
to curb global warming is needed”. 
Goldsmith and Hildyard also quote 
former British Prime Minister Mar- 
garet Thatcher as saying in March 
1989 that “major changes in the 
chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere 
are taking place, with potentially 
calamitous effects for mankind.” 
The alarmist remarks of environ- 
mentalists have thus been echoed 
by politicians who in some cases 
have gone so far as to compare the 
greenhouse effect with a world 
nuclear war. 
FROM CERTAINTIES 
TO BOUBTS 
But is it possible that the certain- 
ties of 1989 have become improb- 
able hypotheses in 1993? Palaeocli- 
matologists who study ice, 
sediments, rocks, coral and the 
trunks of ancient trees, admit that 
they cannot calculate the tempera- 
ture of the Earth as it was 2,000 years 
ago. The planet experiences climatic 
cycles that are alternately hot and 
humid and cold and dry. But 
although a rise of 0.5°C has been 
recorded in the second half of this 
century (i.e., since precise temper- 
ature measurements began to be 
made), peaking in the 1980s, no-one 
today is prepared to state categori- 
cally that this provides incontro- 
vertible proof of global warming, or 
that global warming is due to human 
activities, since no-one knows what 
happened before humankind 
appeared on the scene. Gérard Lam-

The greenhouse 
effect. 
The Intergovernmental Confer- 
ence on the World Climate Pro- 
gramme, which was held in Geneva 
(Switzerland) from 14 to 16 April 
1993, also yielded some surprises. 
The meeting was co-sponsored by 
the World Meteorological Organi- 
zation (WMO), the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP), 
the Food and Agriculture Organi- 
zation of the United Nations (FAQ), 
UNEsco, the International Council of 
Scientific Unions (ICSU), the United 
Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and the International 
Oceanographic Commission (10C). 
Entitled “The Climate Agenda”, the 
meeting reviewed, a year after the 
Rio Conference, the current situa- 
tion with regard to the socio-eco- 
nomic impact of climate change 
resulting from the greenhouse 
effect. The 400 participants from 
some 140 countries took note of 
one obvious point. “Climate pre- 
diction,” says one of the Conference 
documents, “is a complex under- 
taking which is hindered by the gaps 
in our knowledge. . . . Knowledge 
of climatic processes must be deep- 
ened and we must improve obser- 
vation of the atmosphere, the 
oceans, ice and the land areas of 
the planet.” All the speakers insisted 
on the need to intensify research in 
these fields. 
COULD THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT 
BE BENEFICIAL! 
While the industrialized coun- 
tries already have satellite, rocket 
and land-based observation facili- 
ties, as well as computerized cli- 
mate modelling systems, the devel- 
oping countries generally do not 
have adequate facilities for 
observing the local climate and its 
variations, or for collecting and 
analysing meteorological data. Con- 
sequently an appeal has been 
launched for the rich countries to 
participate in the creation of obser- 
vation centres in the poor coun- 
tries. A budget has even been 
drafted, although nothing has been 
said about where the money would 
come from. Gunnar Kullenberg, 
secretary of the IOC at UnEsco, told 
us he was sorry that no state or indi- 
vidual has really taken a lead on this 
issue. It seems as if governments 
are waiting for the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change to be ratified. This Con- 
vention, signed by 154 countries in 
June 1992 at the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED), must be 
ratified before it can come into 
force. Its ultimate goal is to “stabilize 
greenhouse gas concentrations in 
the atmosphere at a level that would 
prevent dangerous anthropogenic 
interference with the climate 
system”. 
Observers at the Rio and Geneva 
conferences were very surprised 
that nothing was said about the 
need to reduce the production of 
greenhouse gases by reducing pol- 
lution. On the contrary, at a press 
conference at which FAO was rep- 
resented by Wim Sombroek, 
Director of FAQ’s Land and Water 
Development Division, and by René 
Gommes, Secretary of FAO's Inter- 
departmental Sub-group on Cli- 
mate Change, we heard that “cli- 
mate change could also lead to 
useful modifications from which 
we should be ready to draw profit: 
the increase in carbon dioxide con- 
centrations could have a beneficial 
effect on world food production 
when world population has dou- 
bled”. Carbon provides plants with 
food. Several other beneficial effects 
of climate change have been iden- 
tified, including increased poten- 
tial for bio-fuels and higher tem- 
peratures in temperate zones. This 
  
revolutionary assertion must have 
surprised Edward Goldsmith. 
Should we conclude from it that to 
have bumper harvests we should 
step on the accelerator? [|

MEASURING LEAD LEVELS 
Few states publish lead emission figures. However, 
according to estimates made by UNEP human activities 
produce around 332,000 tons of lead annually world- 
wide, including some 12,000 tons of natural origin 
(wind-borne volcanic dust). The lead in petrol repre- 
sents only 10 per cent of all refined lead but is respon- 
sible for 60 per cent of emissions caused by human 
activity. Since it is deposited 100 metres each side of the 
road, it is not advisable to eat plants and mushrooms 
which grow in this area. |

(Uruguay) to seize a cargo of 29,000 caiman skins. 
Loaded into a container in Colombia, they were due to

territories of the Netherlands but not covered by the 
Convention}. Meanwhile, the authorites in Italy seized 
10,000 caiman skins also from Colombia, which had

FIRE OR FLOOD 
For years the rice-growers of California's Sacramento 
Valley set fire to their fields after the harvest to burn off 
the remaining straw. Smoke blanketed the valley, adding 
an estimated one million tons of pollution to the atmos- 
phere annually. In 1992, environmentalists suggested 
that they should flood the fields instead of burning 
them. Last December, 6,000 hectares of rice were 
flooded. These wetlands have become a paradise for 
wintering waterfowl. In spring the water is drained into 
the Sacramento River, aiding the seaward migration 
of young salmon. [| 
 
BOTANIC GARDENS AND BIODIVERSITY 
Around half of the world’s 1,600 botanic gardens are 
active in conservation, maintaining facilities ranging 
from seed banks containing samples of hundreds of 
species to small conservation collections kept in public 
gardens or greenhouses. Unfortunately, these gardens 
are badly distributed. Most of them are in the world’s 
temperate zones, where plant diversity is less rich. 
Europe has 532 gardens and about 12,000 species; 
North America has 265 gardens and 20,000 species, 
whereas in South America, with an estimated flora of 
80,000 species, there are only 66. [| 
LUCKY STARS? 
Asterias forbesi, the common starfish, is unpopular 
with fishermen. A powerful carnivore, it feasts on mus- 
sels, periwinkles, snails, scallops and oysters. But 
researchers love it, since its method of feeding is unique 
in the animal world—it pushes its stomach out through 
its mouth and envelops its prey. If one of its arms is 
wounded it casts it off and grows another. It has 5 eyes, 
one at the end of each arm. Another amazing charac- 
teristic is its ability to change sex—experiments have 
shown that sex reversal from male to female occurs in 
adult specimens when there is a shortage of females. 
Perhaps such a wonder of nature deserves some of our 
shellfish. | 
  
A NEW LAW FOR LAKE 
BAIKAL 
In September 1992, Russian and 
German experts took partin a con- 
sultation on draft legislation for 
Lake Baikal, threatened by pollu- 
tion from cellulose factories at its 
southern extremity. According to 
the representative of the World Con- 
servation Union who took part in 
the consultation, the law would 
establish the lake as a core protected 
zone surrounded by a buffer area. 
Lake Baikal, which is 634 km long, 
from 25 to 79 km wide (the surface 
area of Belgium) and 1,637 metres 
deep, contains one-fifth of the 
planet's fresh water. When 1 visited 
it, found there was a difference of 
opinion between Grigori Galazy, 
the former director of the Irkutsk 
Institute of Limnology, and his suc- 
cessor, Mikhail Grachev. Galazy 
believes that the lake is dying as a 
result of pollution, whereas Grachev, 
who would like it to be included on 
UNESCO's World Heritage List, is 
convinced that the lake's water is 
pure, a point of view confirmed by 
American scientists whom I meton 
the spot. After exploring the icy 
waters of the lake in a pocket sub- 
marine, they told me: “The lake is 
magnificent. The purest in the 
world!” Let's hope that the law pro- 
tecting this vast water reserve will be 
adopted. [|

Gendarmes 
on an 
environmental 
mission at a 
disused factory 
(France). 
AREEN GENDARME 
N France the gendarmerie is going green. In 
October 1992, Captain Emmanuel Bartier was 
appointed chief of a new environmental sec- 
tion. He claims, however, that there is nothing 
new about his mission, pointing out that “The 
gendarmerie policed nature in the country- 
side as early as 1903.” Certainly the gendarmerie— 
a military body—has always been more firmly 
established in the countryside than in the towns. 
Although 80 per cent of its environmental work is 
preventive, the number of prosecutions has also 
considerably increased. Whereas 30,000 offences 
involving a fine and 2,800 crimes punishable by 
prison and/or a fine were recorded in 1980, the fig- 
ures had risen to 62,000 and 5,500 respectively 
by 1992. In 1987 the gendarmerie distributed a 
memorandum on nature and the environment 
to its staff of 90,000. This 700-page “green book” 
covers such subjects as air and water pollution, 
nuclear energy, control of chemicals, waste, 
poaching of plant and animal life and the pro- 
tection of parks, and explains what action should 
be taken in each case. A training session has been 
arranged to inform noncommissioned officers 
and teach them how to use sampling equipment. 
Captain Bartier, who has been travelling to meet 
his opposite numbers elsewhere in Europe, notes 
that so far there is no inter-state co-ordination 
despite the fact that police forces are increasingly 
concerned with environmental issues. He cites 
as examples Italy, which has created a special- 
ized unit of 70 carabinieri, and Spain, where units 
of the Guardia Civil have been specially trained 
and equipped—not surprisingly since protection 
of the environment is written into the Spanish 
constitution. This October, representatives from 
different national police forces will hold their first 
joint meeting at Interpol Headquarters in Lyons 
(France). International co-operation should make 
Europe cleaner, though the task of harmonizing 
legislation will still remain.

    LIVING UITH CHANGE 
The glass and concrete environment of modern cities sets up 
barriers between inside and outside, cutting people off from 
each other and from themselves. 
Developed in France, this 
“audiosphere” is used to 
simulate street noise. New 
sounds can be added to 
study the effect they would 
have on the urban 
soundscape. 


### 94900: Sound barriers

 
Sound barriers 
proprictor and his wife share a carafe of wine 
fitted with a spout from which they pour 
the wine directly into their mouths by raising 
and tipping it, in exactly the way the old wineskin 
would have worked. The sensation of drinking is 
entirely different when the liquid is squirted into 
the mouth rather than sipped out of a glass or 
sucked through a straw, and so arc the accompa- 
nying sounds, on this occasion a bright burbling 
as the air sceks to replace the liquid through the 
twisted thin spout. Nothing touches the mouth 
but the liquid. It is probably the purest way to 
i N the Tunisian restaurant in Montreal, the 
by R.Murray Schafer 
drink, yet it has been replaced by the glass as 
individual proprictorship has replaced tribal 
sharing. The glass, replacing more tuneful recep- 
tacles, is raised and chimed at the beginning of the 
meal, partly in compensation for mute con- 
sumption, an exercise denied its successor the 
plastic cup. 
The soundscape of every society is condi- 
toned by the predominant materials from which 
it1s constructed. Thus we may speak of bamboo, 
wood, metal, glass or plastic cultures, meaning 
that these materials produce a repertoire of sounds 
of specific resonance when touched by active 41

agents. Europe was a stone culture and to a large 
extent still 1s, particularly in its smaller, less- 
touched communities. North America was orig- 
inally a wood culture, passing, like modern 
Europe, to cement and glass during the twentieth 
century. 
The glazed window was an invention of great 
importance for the soundscape, framing external 
events in an unnatural, phantom-like “silence”. 
The diminution of sound transmission, while 
not immediate and occurring only gradually with 
the thickening of glazing, not only created the 
notion of a “here” and a “there” or a “beyond”, 
but also introduced a fission of the senses. Today 
one can look at one’s environment, while hearing 
another, with a durable film separating the two. 
Plate glass shattered the sensorium, replacing it 
with contradictory visual and aural impressions. 
Ih a study of fairy tales, Marie-Louise von 
Franz points out that glass “cuts you off, as far as 
your animal activity is concerned. . . . People 
very often say. ‘It feels as if there were a glass wall 
.. . between me and my surroundings.” That 
means: ‘I see perfectly well what is going on, I 
can talk to people, but the animal and feeling 
contact, the warmth contact is cut off by a glass 
wall...” 7" The world of sounds and textures, the 
palpitating, kinetic world, is zoned out; we still 
watch it move, but from our (generally scated) 
position indoors our physical contact with it has 
ceased. The physical world is “there”; the world 
of reflection and speculation is “here”. 
When the space within is totally insulated it 
craves reorchestration: this is the era of back- 
ground music and of the radio, a form of interior 
decoration, designed or absent-mindedly intro- 
duced to re-energize the space and render it more 
sensorially complete. Now the interior and exte- 
rior can become totally contradictory. The world 
seen through the window is like the world of a 
movie set with the radio as soundtrack. I recall 
travelling in the dome car of a train passing 
through the Rocky Mountains with schmaltzy 
  
music on the public address system and thinking: 
this 1s a travelogue movie about the Rocky Moun- 
tains—we are not here at all. 
When the division between “here” and 
“there” is complete, the glass wall will become as 
impenetrable as the stone wall. Even thieves will 
respect it. Shattered glass is a trauma everyone is 
anxious to avoid. “He shall rule them with a rod 
of iron: as the vessels of a potter shall they be 
broken to shivers” is a potent acoustic image in 
the Bible (Revelation 2:27). A keynote of the 
Middle-Eastern soundscape under normal cir- 
cumstances, crockery became a violent signal 
when broken. For us the same is true of glass. And 
yet one cannot help feeling that the mind-body 
split of the Western world will only be healed 
when some of the glass in which we have sheathed 
our lives is shattered, allowing us again to inhabit 
a world in which all the senses interact instead of 
being ranked in opposition. 
ACOUSTIC TRADEMARKS 
AND SYMBOLIC 
SOUNDS 
It is unnatural for our senses to be forcibly choked 
off, and when they are, they often reopen with a 
vengeance. One could study the suppression of 
the different senses in terms of the great culture 
revolutions in history. Right now we are being 
overwhelmed by the audio-visual media, which 
exclude other sensory stimulations. A measure of 
their inadequacy: everyone feels the compulsion 
to eat while watching movies. 
Little by little the whole world is becoming 
mediatized, that is to say, it is driven by sound 
objects designed to manipulate or persuade. In 
this way itis different from the natural world we 
have left behind in which sounds stimulated us 
but rarely tried to control our behaviour. Think 
about this: there is scarcely a sound in modern life 
that has not been manufactured and is not owned 
by someone. The music we listen to is copy- 
right-protected and licensed. Carhorns are the 
The one and the 
many. A lone

property of car drivers and often blowing them 
is the only conversation drivers make as they 
pass through the city streets. 
Almost all the noises of the modern city— 
police sirens, jet noise, construction noise—are 
designed to fortify some special-interest group. 
Thus, many sounds have become symbols for 
social classes. A ghetto blaster says: “I'm talking, 
you listen!” A portable telephone (silent in cars, 
audible in restaurants or on trains) says: “I'm a 
very successful person. I’m important.” The 
ubiquitous cash registers of shops and restau- 
rants proclaim: “Listen to how much business we 
do here!” An alarm-bell system screams: “Hands 
off!” Even the owner of a growling dog on a 
leash is silently saying: “Meet my friend. He pro- 
tects me.”

Much of this sound is pugilistic. Is this 
inevitable? Is it the result of overcrowding in the 
modern world or a means of dividing the rich 
from the poor, the winners from the losers? 
Poverty is quict. It is affluence that has become 
noisy. With the acquisition of more and newer 
gadgets with impressive acoustic trademarks, 
successful groups stencil their identities into the 
contemporary soundscape and attempt to influ- 
ence social behaviour to their own advantage. 
THE VOICE 
OF THE CROWD 
The only means available to the poor or disen- 
franchised to make their presence known is the 
rioting crowd. Certainly crowds arc a feature of 
modern life and will undoubtedly become 
increasingly significant in the decades to come. 
Elias Canetti analyses the crowd question in his 
book Crowds and Power, and emphasizes the 
importance of touching in dense assemblies of 
people. “Itis only in a crowd,” he writes, “that 
man can become free of his fear of being touched. 
This is the only situation in which the fear changes 
into its opposite. The crowd he needs is the dense 
crowd, in which body is pressed to body; a

crowd, too, whose physical constitution is also 
densc, or compact, so that he no longer notices 
who it is that presses against him.” 
Touch and sound arc intimately connected. In 
the lower frequencies tactility and sounding meet 
as the pedal tone breaks into a vibrating pulse. 
This intimacy encourages the densely-packed 
crowd to invoke sound as its most potent 
weapon. In every other way it is vulnerable to 
penetration and disunification by better-armed 
opponents who seck to neutralize it. The crowd 
remains outside the towers of glass in which the 
elite have imprisoned themselves. [tis primarily 
with 1ts voice that it defends itself and seeks to 
remain invincible. The crowd roars, the crowd 
chants, the crowd scrcams—you don’t count the 
voices; there is only one voice. If it contains 
within it individuals who have not entirely sur- 
rendered to its purpose by the encouragement of 
touching, sound will reinforce the dedication of 
the wavering. There is a passage in St. Augustine’s 
Confessions in which the fate of a man who had 
forsworn gladiatorial shows is scaled after he 
had re-entered the maelstrom of a crowd. “If 
only he could have stopped his cars!” cries St. 
Augustine despairingly. 
There are many ways of characterizing a 
Skyscrapers in Denver crowd—Dby its purpose, its credo or its numbers. 
(US.A). This is what the explainers, the media men and the 
  
  
politicians try to do. But vocally the crowd is 
beyond all understanding. How many nuances 
arc detectable in its bawling? Joy... anger... 
exasperation . . . derision . .. rudimentary emo- 
tions, at times chaotic but more often unified 
rhythmically in the repetition of slogans, for 
unless the crowd speaks with rhythmic incisive- 
ness it can be fractured, set upon itself internally 
and be routed. 
By the carly twentieth century, urban noise 
had increased to a point where it began to affect 
writers in a similar way, and among the first were 
the Futurists, led by ET. Marinetti. “Through a 
disjointed, feverish and posturing language 
Marinetti was able to capture something of the 
mood of a human crowd in motion... ..” This is 
Istvan Anhalt commenting on Marinetti’s rhetoric 
in a book in which he shows parallel develop- 
ments in twentieth-century music. Marinetti’s 
prose is “the text of a poster, a proclamation, or 
aseries of headlines. It is a throbbing, aggressive, 
insistent language, brooking no dissent, dis- 
missing the need for reflection, intolerant and 
destructive.” In his Futurist Manifesto Marinetti 
had proclaimed: “We will sing of great crowds 
excited by work, by pleasure and by riot; we 
will sing of the multicoloured, polyphonic tides 
of revolution in the modern capitals.”

spicuous 1n much contemporary music, first of all 
in the bloated orchestras of Berg and Schoenberg, 
then later in the statistical organization of 
Xenakis” works, as well as in the cluster and 
aggregate effects of Ligeti and the “mob” vocal 
outbursts of Lutoslawski and other members of 
the Polish school. Crowd power is everywhere 
present in rock music, which could not exist 
without it. “No-one goes to a rock concert unless 
they’re stoned or stupid,” a teenager tells me, 
and yet almost everyone has been there. And the 
music ricochets from car radios and ghetto 
blasters, through the streets, over the back yard 
fences, and dribbles out of the Walkman of the 
passenger next to you on the bus, where no-one 
speaks. It is almost as if music is haemorrhaging 
all around us, exploding out of its containers; 
and suddenly you realize that music is the glue of 
the modern multiracial, multilinguistic city, 
holding it together more effectively than any 
political or social system, and you allow yourself 
to hope that it will continue to do so, fearing the 
consequences if it fails. We know that there are 
more violent forms of intolerance than the 
tyranny of the loudspeaker. 
RITUALS OF TRANQUILLITY 
When modern humanity gave up life in the 
country for life in the city, when it deserted open 
spaces for the dénse packing of the metropolis, 
when the alarm clock replaced the sunrise and fac- 
tory noise obliterated wind, rain and the birds, 
when the drowsiness of natural life was surren- 
dered to the mad dash to get ahead, the frictions 
of increased human contact, the hell of other 
people, as Sartre put it, replaced the great geo- 
botanic garden that had been the scene of past 
existence and the quiet life it promoted. Has it 
been extinguished from memory or can a new 
ccological awareness help to recover it? 
What we seem to need are rituals of tran- 
quillity in which large assemblies of people could 
feel the serenity of a shared experience without 
the desire to proclaim their emotions in destruc- 
tive or disfiguring action. In this sense we might 
again study the model of the Western concert 
audience to determine whether it might have 
wider or evolving significance. When we think 
about it, how astonishing is the concert audi- 
ence, quietly sitting before the music, scarcely 
breathing, engulfed by the mysterious vibrations 
in the air about them. I suppose every picce of 
music longs to be worshipped in silence, but few 
achieve such a distinction, and some achieve it 
only by the authority of habit rather than the 
privilege of beauty. I have often wondered 
whether the ritual of the concert could not be 
transposed to other environments and trans- 
formed into a collective contemplation of a bird 
dawn chorus, a summer solstice or an Earth Day 
celebration. 
  
If the future of the planet is destined to embrace 
increasing numbers of people, it is absolutely vital 
that we discover means of taming the noises that 
arc threatening to tear us to pieces. Noise pollution 
is a world-wide problem but its solution does not 
lie in increased legistation and enforced prohibi- 
tion. It rests with a regaining of the still centre, a 
discovery that there is a time for everyone to 
speak and a time for cach of us to listen. This is the 
“great open secret” of the natural soundscape 
where all sounds have their place but none 
attempts to dominate or smother all others into 
submission. There are simply no sounds in nature 
that arc a threat to our hearing. As reports of an 
alarming mcrease in deafness accumulate from 
some of the most developed nations of the world, 
we realize that humanity is the exclusive architect 
of sounds that kill. Either we will voluntarily 
reduce the sound sewage now threatening whole 
populations or we will all become deaf. In either 
case the world will be quieter.

### 94901: Architects of disorder

Architects of disorder 
by Fernando and Diego Montes 
ECENTLY-BUILT public housing estates 
cannot by any stretch of the imagination be 
regarded as examples of haphazard design. 
On the contrary, they suffer from an excessive 
enthusiasm for order on the part of their planners. 
The order that reigns in them is so oppressive and 
simplified that it distracts attention from the 
shape of the buildings. It is the expression of an 
earthbound conceptual art that pays too little 
attention to the estate-dweller’s desire for a gen- 
uine urban environment. 
This discrepancy has always existed and has 
never been resolved. Art is not, in this case, ahead 
of its time but off on a side-track strewn with his- 
tory’s bright but mistaken ideas, ideas that should 
perhaps have been looked into cautiously before 
large-scale building operations began. As it is, the 
frustration of estate-dwellers, provided with a 
roof over their heads but deprived of an urban 
environment, 1s one of the discontents of modern 
times. 
The situation varies little from one country to 
another. The rows of dreary blocks lining the 
broad, empty avenues of the Moscow suburbs are 
variations on a town-planning theme that recurs 
in Barcelona, Santiago, Milan, Essen and the Paris 
working-class suburb of La Courncuve. With a 
few allowances for climatic differences, the pic- 
ture is the same everywhere: long, narrow hori- 
zontal slabs, the same back and front, or “high- 
rises”, multistorey flats reaching up into the 
power lines rather than into the clouds. 
The only thing not in order about these end- 
less vistas, these repetitious excrescences that 
bear so little resemblance to real buildings, these 
unfinished but already run-down blocks, was 
the decision to build them in the first place. Ever 
since, it has been one long tale of false reasoning, 
miscalculation and mistaken designations imme- 
diately shown up for what they are: “green 
spaces” can never take the place of natural 
greenery, and the “amenities” provided scarcely 
qualify as public buildings. 
IMPROVISED 
ARCHITECTURE 
Let us now look at the favelas, cases, villas-mis- 
erias, barriadas and other shantytowns that have 
mushroomed around nearly all major agglomer- 
ations, from Lima to Lagos and from Cairo to 
Mexico City. These indescribable encrustations 
are archetypes of a modern urban and architec- 
tural phenomenon. Once peripheral, like the ring 
of shacks that used to occupy the “zone” just out- 
side the former fortifications of Paris, this type of 
habitat has become commonplace, perhaps even 
the commonest type—it would, incidentally, be 
interesting to compare the area covered, respec- 
tively, by shantytowns and by conventional types 
of habitat in a Third World conurbation. 
Slums, run-down or derelict dwellings—the 
traditional answers to the demand for urban 
housing—are no longer sufficient to accommo- 
date the masses of people moving in from rural 
areas that can no longer feed them. The drift 
from the land is not an organized movement of 
population; 1t just happens. The cities, the first 
places the migrants from the countryside head for, 
have done nothing to cater for the newcomers, 
perhaps because there was nothing they could do. 
It took Paris fifteen hundred years to reach a 
population of a million. How long will it take to 
rcach ten million? As for Mexico City, it is 
heading for a population of twenty million.

A city 1s a cumbersome structure and its 
growth 1s hard to control. An overnight deci-

and by definition haphazard. It goes without 
saying that planners and architects have had 
nothing to do with them, nor do they meet 
normal town-planning standards. But which of 
these, strictly laid-out housing estates or hig- 
gledy-piggledy shantytowns, are the more rep- 
resentative of the spirit of modern architecture? 
In the late 1960s, John Turner, a British- 
born architect who teaches at the Massachu- 
sctts Institute of Technology, emerged as a pas- 
sionate advocate of the architectural merits of

shantytowns. His message, relayed through the 
world’s leading schools of architecture and 
avant-garde publications, is that there is much to 
be learned from this architecture without archi- 
tects, an architecture dictated by need and 
urgency, which he sees as being richly imagina- 
tive. This form of self-built housing is extremely 
well adapted to the requirements of the inhab- 
itants, who do not receive welfare handouts but 
are the protagonists in a tragedy they arc obliged 
to act out in order to survive. 
At the other extreme, large-scale housing 
projects planned, built and managed by a cen- 
tralized institution are the outcome of a ruthless 
rationalization of social needs. The context of 
their construction and of the decision-making 
processes on which they depend is more often 
than not a bureaucratic one, even in the most 
free-market-oriented countries. 
Turner’s point of departure is the idea that, in

the conditions of extreme deprivation that prevail 
in shantytowns, the mode of production takes 
precedence over technical or aesthetic consider- 
ations. Basically, he believes that architecture, as 
usually practised, is either a luxury reserved for 
developed societies or an art that is out of place 
outside a stable social context: it requires, if not 
order, at least a certain degree of methodical orga- 
nization. The new urban society of the shanty- 
towns, however, is a prime example of a social 
body in the throes of change. 
Do shantytowns open new horizons or do 
they point up the need to rethink the hierarchies, 
values and methods of architecture? 
As a good dialectician of social progress, 
Turner plays on the inseparability of the two 
possibilities. According to him, it should be pos- 
sible to reconcile modern architecture with dis- 
order and foresight with spontaneity and achieve 
a kind of hybrid form, something like jazz or 
the music of Stravinsky or Gershwin, a mixture 
of improvisation and highly complex orchestra- 
tion. But Turner has so far failed to carry opinion 
with him, and modern architecture has still to find 
its philosopher’s stone. 
A FRUITFUL ECLECTICISM 
Fifty years earlier, Picasso, with his usual per- 
spicacity, had also put his finger on this dilemma. 
In the middle of his cubist period, he said that, 
after Van Gogh, everything had become possible 
(disorder), but that what had been gained in 
freedom had been lost in self-confidence. 
History does not move forward in a straight 
line but follows a strange kind of trajectory, 
swinging one way then back again, leaping for- 
ward, stopping and accelerating. The innocent 
observer might think that it never points the way 
clearly, that it is constantly correcting its course 
and changing tack. 
The twentieth century, which got off to a 
flying start in architecture only to finish in low 
gear, has scen the pendulum swing time and 
again and has had its share of skids and knocks 
as well, but it may well have made an original 
contribution to the history of art in that it has 
been a time of greater eclecticism and diversity 
than ever before. This characteristic feature of 
the times is perhaps linked with the development 
of the communication media and data-storage 
facilities, which enables the particular and the 
universal to coexist in the spirit of the global vil- 
lage, combining the parochial with the planet- 
wide. 
For centuries, the memory of humanity was 
oral, written or pictorial. As its storage capacity 
was very limited, its contents had constantly to be 
weeded out. Thanks to chemical and electronic 
devices, the storage capacity has increased immea- 
surably. We no longer need to discard whatever 
is out of date or offbeat to make room for main- 
stream ideas. The two can exist side by side, just 
below the surface of our memories, waiting for 
the moment to re-emerge. That moment may 
come quite soon: the wheel of history, we arc 
told, 1s turning faster and faster. |

The third bank of the river 
by Roberto DaMatta 
Above, a participant in the 
Parintins carnival (Brazil). 
O reflect on modernity is necessarily to 
T deconstruct a myth. But what are myths? It 
took us a long time to see them as anything 
other than the irrational outgrowth of primitive 
minds, but we now realize that they provide a 
framework within which societies define their 
values, that they arc devices for taking control of 
time, time that bears within itself the seeds of 
death and oblivion. Myths, then, are stories that 
seck to escape the grip of time. That is why 
mythologies are disturbing. When, thercfore, the 
heralds of post-modernity proclaim that the age 
of great stories is over, they do so in order that 
they can themselves construct the great (and true) 
story of all times... 
Ultimately this 1s the dilemma that lics at 
the root of our civilization: how to find stable 
values in a world that chooses to be unstable, 
how to reconcile individuals who regard them- 
sclves as the repositories of rights, desires and 149

subjective feelings with collective institutions 
that have to be stable and objective, that require 
duties to be performed and that guarantee the 
existence of individual choice? 
If myths are stories that reject the linear 
chronology of cumulative history, how can they 
be reconciled with a civilization that claims to 
have invented modernity and defines itself as the 
product of a history that continually transforms 
people and institutions? 
To answer this question is to recognize that 
there 1s no such thing as a society exclusively 
based on the future or on movement. Modernity 
may have exorcised many myths, but it has not 
abolished myth-making. Repressed and re-

constantly reappear—above all when the death of 
God or, worse, the end of humankind, is 
announced. For myths, like dreams, signal unre- 
solved problems. The generous Western ideals of 
social justice, individual freedom and political 
equality for all arc clearly based on a mythology, 
and this mythology, even in the developed coun- 
tries, is still grappling with many deviant phe- 
nomena—racism, anti-semitism, political and 
economic marginalization—that haunt or chal-

conferred by graduating from a great university, 
by speaking English or French and, last but not 
least, by being white! 
Confronted with an enlightened, rationalist 
and bourgeois West whose concept of time is 
dominated by the idea of progress, other parts of 
the world are obliged to make a synthesis between 
the modern idea of a universal history centred on 
utilitarian individualism and their own tradi- 
tional values, which hinge on personal loyalties to 
the gods and to ancestors, families and friends. In 
many parts of the world, and particularly in so- 
called marginal or peripheral regions, a rap- 
prochement is taking place between bourgeois 
mythology on the one hand, which refers to a 
system in which the individual is the moral and 
political centre of the universe, and, on the other 
hand, stories based on very different premises. 
The societies that survive this process are those 
that invent mythologies combining these two 
value-systems, previously regarded as incom- 
patible. This path has been followed by Japan and 
by Asia in general, and, on an equally signifi- 
cant scale, by Latin America and particularly 
Brazil. 
EQUAL YET UNEQUAL 
I have written that Brazilian society is struggling 
to combine two mythologies. The first, taking its 
inspiration from the modern tradition, considers 
the individual as an autonomous moral entity 
endowed with inalienable rights such as freedom 
and equality. The second is based on a world-view 
that denies individualism, distrusts progress and 
rejects formal political equality. Whereas the first 
of these mythologies leads to the modern concept 
of representative democracy, the second reflects 
a way of life in which personal relationships are 
stronger than political institutions. Some sce in 
this way of life the imprint of an Iberian counter- 
reformism which (by virtue of its myths, its 
heroes and its forms of civilization) is a kind of 
counterpoint in carnival dress to liberal individ- 
ualism, above all that form which flourishes in the 
United States, which—with its media, fast food, 
tragic solitude and insurmountable ethnic, sexual, 
age and occupation barriers—is the paradigm of 
modernity. 
This convergence of mythologies clearly cre- 
ates a dilemma to which the Brazilian—and, 
more generally, Latin American—solution lies in 
a tendency to sce all people as politically and 
economically uncqual but as morally of equal 
worth. In this world we may be masters or slaves, 
bosses or underlings; but face-to-face with death 
we arc all equal. This paradoxical solution is an 
attempt to reconcile modern egalitarianism with 
the inequality ingrained in traditional ways of 
thought by recourse to an ethic of ambiguity. 
Latin American mythologies adopt equality 
as the framework of the legal and political system 
and competition as the basis of the cconomic 
system, without abandoning or curbing tradi- 
tional social practices based on inequality and 
personal relations. As a result, the legal and polit- 
ical systems always seem to be cither far ahead or 
far behind what is really happening in society. 
Here we have a process of modernization 
imposed from above by the state, which attempts 
thereby to substitute itself for the creative forces 
that gave the original system its spontaneity. 
While modernity is based, socially and epis- 
temologically, on the triumph of the individual, 
it 1s also rooted in a system of rigid procedures, 
valid for everyone, everywhere and in all 51

52 
circumstances—as if we were all really born 
equal, as if we were all exempt from social oblig- 
ations and competed in reasonable conditions 
of equality. Equality before the law conceals 
inequality of social conditions. The so-called 
“post-modern” mythology that relativizes and 
fragments, reducing everything to the yuppy 
nihilism of certain circles in Paris or in Berkeley, 
can only function if certain conditions are met, 
above all if a common denominator 1s attained, the 
common denominator in question being an 
almost blind obedience to the basic principles of 
a universalist rationalism that structures the whole 
system. But how can an egalitarian rationalism of 
this sort be applied to traditionalist societies 
based on the concept of difference? 
A CAPRICIOUS 
LIBERALISM 
The result, in many cases, is a mythology that 
believes in miracles, spirits and messiahs, that 
invents a capricious and particularist liberalism in 
which the laws of the market only work for the 
powerful, and in which egalitarianism has been 
wedded first to slavery, then to servility and a 
system of patronage. From this arises a state that 
is simultancously large and small, strong and 
weak, whose resources and spoils are diverted to 
make sure that the poor are kept in their place, and 
above all to increase the wealth of the rich. Itis a

delinquency founded on the morality of profit- 
secking, disculpating people and opening the 
way to irresponsibility. 
Here we have a collection of myths produced 
from a kind of moral tinkering, a Frankensteinian 
hotchpotch of institutions and practices taken 
from here, there and everywhere, of moral rules 
grouped under a double (or triple) ethic which 
declares that everyone is equal before the law, 
except for one’s relatives and friends. Any refer- 
ence to universality in this context is made in 
order to legitimize the market and profit, not to 
protect the most fundamental rights. 
But we must not disregard the generous and 
constructive side of these trans-modern mytholo- 
gies, the side that wants everyone to be equal but 
rejects the post-utilitarian equation between 
equality and consumption, that wants freedom, 
but not just to make money or to exploit the 
masses marginalized by the media. In Brazil this 
takes the form of a shrewd resistance to market 
economics through the myth of a popular hero, the 
brigand Pedro Malasarte. The stories featuring 
this emblematic figure show how it is possible to 
play the market against big money, and how the 
rule of law that legitimizes exploitation of the 
workforce canbe turned against the boss. In these 
trans-modern mythologies, morality is on the 
side of a form of delinquency that compensates for 
the inequalities resulting from the pressures of 
the international market and of soctal elites.

But the process of acculturation between the 
modern and the traditional also has perverse 
effects. In this twofold ethic, the possibility of 
appealing alternatively to one system or the other 
makes it difficult for individuals to know where 
they stand. What I cannot do as a citizen I may be 
able to do as a friend of the governor or a relative 
of someone in authority. This is the dilemma 
faced by communities in which the modern 
nation-state is subjected to all kinds of external 
and internal pressures and is confronted by social 
expectations that have no outlet. 
The mythologies of peripheral societies have 
grown out of this dilemma. Hence our difficulties 
with classic bourgeois heroes, those judicious 
individuals who are always serious and who know 
how to say yes or no... . Presented with a choice 
but unable or unwilling to decide between the two 
courses available to us, we prefer triangular situ- 
ations which blur distinctions and harmonize dif- 
ferent interests. This is why our mythology con- 
tains a certain number of truly trans-modern 
characters such as Jorge Amado’s Doiia Flor, who 
chooses not to choose, or one of the heroes of Jodo 
Guimaraes Rosa, who decides to live on a magical

### 94903: A World steeped in music

N 
  
A world steeped in music 
by Isabelle Leymarie 
é ODERNITY’, in the most usual 
sense of the word, encompasses 
the world of today. It conjures up 
a picture of a perpetually moving technolog- 
ical universe stemming from the Industrial Rev- 
olution, in which humanity is a slave to 
machinery and feels anxious and cut off from 
Nature and its own roots. W.H. Auden empha- 
sized a more positive aspect of the modern age 
when he defined it as born of “the transforma- 
tion of a closed society of tradition and inheri- 
tance into an open society of fashion and 
choice”. 
In this modern world, which is both unstable 
and alienating and makes a multitude of 
demands, there is more music about than ever 
before. In the street, in buses and on trains, 
more and more people are wearing headsets to 
enjoy their favourite type of music, turned in on 
themselves and announcing their refusal to comn- 
municate with others. A non-stop flow of music 
pours from radio and television stations, and can 
be heard in restaurants, supermarkets, airports, 
hairdressers’ and other shops, dentists’ waiting 
rooms and post offices. Music is a component 
part of films; concerts and music festivals arc 
proliferating internationally; and now some 
bars in the West are starting to import karaoke 
from Japan-—a device which enables the man in 
the street to sing familiar songs to a pre-recorded 
backing while the lyrics appear on a screen. 
Thus music is ubiquitous, and listening to it 
in its most varied forms is continually on the 
increase. “Early music and non-European music 
have never been so widespread,” writes Paul- 
Louis Simon. “Guillaume de Machaut, Mozart 
and Ravi Shankar fill our auditory world; our 
ears are flooded with jazz, pop, disco music 
and all kinds of songs; all these art forms are 
there for us to choose from, and form an integral 
part of the art of our time.” 
The musicologist Jean-Paul Holstein points 
out that music today is characterized by high 
technology, internationalism and democratiza- 
tion. High technology in this context means 
that composers use more and more complex 
forms of expression, that instrumentalists display 
increasing virtuosity, and that people listen to 
music through the intermediary of more and 
more sophisticated technology. Modern tech- 
niques such as mixing, dubbing, playback and 
clectronic distortion in the form of wawa, 
reverb, fuzz and echoplex open the way to new 
sound possibilities, but however advanced they 
may be, they climinate contact with the original 
acoustic sound. Doris Rossiaud, a finc pianist 
who performed with the Orchestre Suisse 
Romande, refused to make recordings because 
she regarded all the ways of correcting errors in 
the studio with multiple takes and mixing as 
forms of trickery. 
As for Holsteins other two points, inter- 
nationalism here refers to the proliferation of 
means of transport and communication, and to 
the creation of new professions, especially in the 
media, publishing and advertising, aimed at 
publicizing and promoting various kinds of 
music. Democratization is linked to popular- 
1zation, the market economy, the emergence of 
a wide audience and the requirements of hit- 
parades. 
CROSS-FERTILIZATION AND 
STANDARDIZATION 
On the current music scene two trends arc 
asserting themselves in tandem: on the one hand 
an urge to merge with and communicate with 
other cultures, apparent in “world music”, a 
mélange of musics from different countries, and 
on the other the increasing standardization of 
commercial music, dominated by American and 
English pop. As non-Western musics are 
absorbed by Western culture, the exotic becomes 
commonplace and loses its character, and oppor- 
tunities for escape become more limited. The 
various “cthnic” musics get cut off from their 
social and religious context and become dehu- 
manized by excessive use of synthesizers (which 
reproduce the sound of certain traditional instru- 
ments, but do not capture their subtleties) and 
clectronic “drum machines”. 
Mechanized and rendered insipid, the 
Japanese shamisen and the Mandingo balafon 
now serve only to add a semblance of tone 55

colour to these new mixes. Then there is “fla-

rhythm section, robbed of all duende, the pas- 
sion that gives Gypsy music its harsh beauty. 
North African rai merges into reggae, reggac 
into rap, and rap itself, with the “sampling” 
technique made popular by young black Amer- 
ican disc-jockeys, which involves borrowing a 
fragment from one piece and inserting it, collage- 
style, into another, leads to mangling and the 
production of rag-bag medleys. Musical 
hybridization is more fashionable than ever, 
and the media are all too ready to propagate it. 
But while musical mixtures, like all contacts 
between cultures, are positive, rewarding and 
even essential for cultural growth, they can only 
work for mutually compatible musics. A par- 
ticularly successful example is Latin jazz, a blend 
of American jazz and Afro-Latin rhythm and 
percussion that is flourishing in the United 
States. It works because jazz and the black 
musics of Latin America and the West Indies 
have the same European and African roots. Fur- 
thermore, for osmosis to take place between 
two or more musical traditions, a long ripening 
process is usually required, such as the “cre- 
olization” that, beginning in the West Indies, 
Latin America and New Orleans in the carly 
seventeenth century, gave rise to such original 
styles as jazz, rumba, mambo, calypso, the 
  
 
  
beguine, samba and bossa nova, cach with its 
own rules and instrumentation. 
The abandonment of tradition and the cul- 
tural legacy gives rise to continual changes and 
inventions. Creativity may thereby be stimu- 
lated, but most commonly, where pop music is 
concerned (now “popular” in name only, since 
it is no longer rooted in a real tradition), the con- 
sumer society requires the continual production 
of novelties which at once become outdated 
and the frantic race to make “hits”. These factors 
disturb less commercially successful artists 
unable to swim against the tide of fashion, and 
also subject listeners to the diktats of the record 
companies, for which sales considerations often 
take precedence over quality. 
The continual broadcasting of music as a 
consumer product also leads to listener lazi- 
ness. Listening becomes passive rather than 
active, and background music can even bring on 
nervous fatigue. We are reduced to hearing 
instead of listening. Many employees working 
in premises where the radio is always on end up 
by simply blanking out the background noise in 
order to escape the assault on their cars, 
Pop music, now a common denominator 
for the young, has nevertheless (despite its close 
links with the consumer society) often been bit- 
terly critical of the violence and excesses of the 
modern world. “You've never done nothing

MODERNITY 
AND 
CONTEMPORARY MUSIC 
It 1s interesting to note that though we speak of 
modern art, modern architecture and modern 
furniture, we say contemporary music. The 
latter uses a wide variety of musical techniques: 
modal, serial, contingent, polytonal and atonal 
languages, the use of stridency and of apparently 
non-musical noises (pioncered by Eric Satic’s 
Parade), of unconventional and increasingly 
graphic systems of notation, and of computers 
and other clectro-acoustic equipment 
(IRCAM—the Institut de Recherche et de 
Coordination Acoustique-Musique—in France 
and the music departments of Columbia and 
Princeton universities in the United States are 
specialists in this field). Contemporary music 
uses acoustic instruments to provide a repertoire 
of unusual sound effects (for instance, John 
Cage’s prepared piano,’ Vinko Globokar’s trom- 
bone pieces, flautists singing into their instru- 
ments, violins slapped and scraped, and the 
ways in which the human voice is used in the 
work of Giacinto Scelsi). So-called “happen- 
ings” such as Cage’s Silence also enrich the 
world of sound. 
Contemporary music is still regarded by 
many as “experimental”, and people sometimes 
find it confusing, but it has not yet been going 
long enough to allow the necessary perspective 
view. Morcover, now that patronage has ended, 
present-day composers arc increasingly isolated 
and find themselves in a precarious position. 
Few of their works now are commissioned 
pieces with a specific social function, written for 
the church, the court, ballet, opera or as pure 
divertissement, or governed by a cosmogonic or 
philosophical system. At the same time com- 
poscrs enjoy greater freedom and independence 
now that they are no longer subject to the whims 
of a patron. 
Far from being popular, contemporary music 
still attracts only a limited audience. But the 
European tradition makes a hierarchical dis- 
tinction (often artificial and pernicious) between 
so-called “art music”, which is placed on a 
pedestal, and other types of music. This is not the 
casc elsewhere. In Cuba, for instance, the various 
musical genres are closely linked—a phenom- 
enon that predates the rise of Fidel Castro— 57

thus vitalizing music in general. It is not unusual 
for a member of a symphony orchestra to play 
in an Afro-Cuban group in the evening and 
then go on to improvise late at night with a jazz 
outfit—without doing any harm to his reputa- 
tion, rather the contrary. Several Cuban com- 
posers, such as Ernesto Lecuona, Gilberto 
Valdés, Gonzalo Roig and Emilio Grenet have 
written many works for the popular repertoire 
and have taken legitimate pride in them. 
THE QUEST FOR 
AN AESTHETIC 
In the field of aesthetics the idea of modernity 
means something different. By and large, for 
most people, it suggests skyscrapers and con- 
crete buildings, the advent of black cars, the 
pure lines of 1920s dress fashions, rectilinear 
furniture, Picasso. This aesthetic, perceived as the 
obverse of classicism, romanticism, the ancient

world and other canons, 1s entirely relative. 
Indeed, it has had its day. In the visual arts 
people now talk about “post-modernism”, and 
in the world of jazz, following the excesses of 
1960s free jazz, about “neo-classicism”—cxem- 
plified by musicians such as Wynton Marsalis, 
the Harper brothers and Terence Blanchard. 
Some architects like Philip Johnson, Gwathmey 
& Siegel and Mario Buotta are now opting for 
softer, rounder shapes. Fashions in dress are 
also reverting to earlier styles. 
The idea of modernity is far from being con- 
temporary. Some composers in the carly decades 
of this century, such as Charles Ives, Henry 
Cowell, Edgard Varese, Carl Ruggles, Dane 
Rudhyar, Ruth Crawford and Adolph Weiss, 
were termed “ultra-modern” in the United 
States in their day. 
It 1s interesting to note that for these com- 
posers being modern meant, in music, following 
only one’s imperious inner drives, not outdated 
canons. “Music written in the manner of another 
century,” said Varese, “is the result of culture, 
and desirable and comfortable as culture may be, 
an artist should not lie down in it.” He added: “I 
don’t care about reaching the public as much as 
I care about reaching certain musical-acoustical 
phenomena, in other words, to disturb the 
atmosphere—because, after all, sound is only an 
atmospheric disturbance!” Whereas until the 
romantic period music was regarded as the man- 
ifestation of divine order, it later became the 
expression of the composer’s emotions and inner 
life. The composer would break free, gain his 
independence and impose his own laws, but at 
the same time he would cut himself off from the 
organic world to which he belonged. 
In literature, the idea of modernity made its 
appearance with Baudelaire, who in his essay on 
the painter in the modern world exhorted critics 
and art-lovers to discover the beauty of things 
that possess “the essential quality of being the

present”, and by due appreciation of that beauty 
to renew their links with the universal. In 
painting, 1t coincides with Manet’s Déjeuner 
sur U'herbe, exhibited at the Salon des Refusés in 
1863. With this work Manet claimed the painter’s 
prerogative of painting a picture for his own 
aesthetic delectation, without bothering about 
representation or allegory but only following his 
own personal urges, in other words of pro- 
ducing “art for art’s sake”. In this sense 
Kandinsky’s credo could be that of many twen- 
tiecth-century musicians: “The artist must be 
blind to ‘recognized’ shape, just as he must be 
deaf to the teachings and desires of his age. His 
eye must be open upon his own inner life, and 
his ear always pricked for the voice of inner 
necessity. Then he will be able to use all methods 
with impunity, even those which are forbidden.” 
Schoenberg, the precursor of contemporary 
music, also had a mystical approach. Beauty, 
according to him, stems from the search for 
truth, but a truth linked both to aesthetic 
absolutes and to the composer’s inner tempera- 
ment: “Beauty begins to appear when the non- 
creator becomes aware of its absence. It does not 
exist before, because the artist has no need of it: 
for him the truth is enough. . .. And yet beauty

gives itself to the artist even though he has not 
sought it, having endeavoured only to find the 
truth.” 
Some years later Elliott Carter opened up 
new horizons for American music, and his 
experimentation foreshadowed that of present- 
day composers. His work, wrote Martin 
Boykan, “is of importance to the postwar gen- 
cration not only because of its artistic power, but 
also because it provides a moral lesson, because 
it reminds the composer that it 1s his task— 
painful, perhaps, but inescapable—to choose his 
language freshly for each work, and to choose 
from the whole range of musical possibilities.” 
Though fashion imposes new benchmarks 
and new conventions, fashion and modernity are 
ultimately opposed, and modernity (in the 
artistic sense of the term) runs counter to 
fashion. Being modern means freeing onself 
from codes and conventions, whilst remaining 
fully of one’s time, from which there is no 
escape. As Elliott Carter said, it means “choosing 
onc’s language freshly for cach work.” As 
regards music, “modern” composers must turn 
away from traditional artistic categories and 
find their own voice; and “modern” listeners 
should stop making judgements on the basis of

outdated criteria and should greet new work 
with flexibility. 
As the car becomes more receptive, percep- 
tion becomes more acute and differing degrees 
of listening develop. As with painting, about 
which no-one talks more understandingly than 
painters, so the professional musician, attuned 
to harmonic niceties, counterpoint and phrasing 
and the subtleties of rhythm, appreciates music 
morc profoundly than the amateur whose 
instinctive understanding, however intense and 
scnsuous, operates at a more 1Impressionistic 
and superficial level. 
So many different types of music can be 
heard today that each of us must create our own 
way of listening. This profusion makes life par- 
ticularly hard for the composer, who sometimes 
gets lost in a maze of styles and methods. Butin 
the modern world, saturated as it is with sound, 
the pleasure of a true musical discovery is all the 
more wonderful in that it 1s getting rare. “I love 
what never was,” cried Odilon Redon, inviting 
us with this piece of wordplay to continue 
exploring the byways of discovery. un

Mason elected to go to the bathroom, so the 
shadow stayed where it was, lying prone on the

Anything written which is not modern should 
be done in any order. This is what I have decided, 
so that there will be no ambiguity. I have not yet 
written this story, but I am now imagining that 
I have written it. I have finished the story, cor- 
rected its mistakes and am just about to send it 
off to Unesco. Before I do so, I turn the story 
into the deck of cards I mentioned “just now” 
and shuffle the deck thoroughly. Then I put the 
deck of stories into an envelope, step out into the 
street and drop the envelope into a letter box. 
Even as I do so, I imagine the order of the cards 
changing, so that within a matter of moments my 
story has changed into something quite dif- 
ferent. 
  
It is quite possible, mused Mason Line, for an 
object to be imbued with magic: a fountain pen, 
empty of ink and useless to the hand, exquisite to 
the eye; a book, a thin volume, its pages still 
uncut, virgin thoughts awaiting the reader’

knife; or even my shadow, lying beside me on this 
foreign bed. The book contains no words, but if 
I hold it up to the light, I can see something 
inside, a voice silenced with time, the distant 
sadness of some forlorn hero. The pen is not 
empty, after all, its barrel is filled, it is just that the 
ink is invisible; and only by speaking the lan- 
guage of negatives can one hope to understand its 
message. 
The room in which Mason Line 1s seated is, of 
course, one of a chain of rooms, in a row of 
hotels dotted like stars in the universe, light 
years from one another, yet quite close from a 
distance, so that if one were to place one’s index 
finger in front of one’s eye and close the other 
tightly, one would be able, quite easily, to block 
out a dozen or so of them. Mason checks into the 
hotel at midnight, into the room I have reserved 
for him. He will leave the following midnight, as 
somebody else, another character from another 
story I have yet to invent. Some people will 
think of him as an imposter, a spy or an actor, 
perhaps, rehearsing some future impersonation. 
Others, especially the man at reception, will 
assume he is simply disguising himself so as to 
avoid paying the bill. 
At other times, should I have got out of bed on 
the wrong side, I might be more circumspect, 
investing my diurnal incarnations with qualities 
designed to deliberately hinder them through 
life’s progress, which is to say that microcosmic 
span of existence corresponding to the passage 
of the sun from east to west, or from one side of 
the hotel (Mason's side) to the other. Tam not a 
moralist, I care not one whit for conventional 
notions of good or bad, I just have my own 
way of doing things, an incontrovertible logic, 
which would shatter into a thousand pieces if 1 
ever tried to understand it. 
I am an imposter, thought Mason, a reincarna- 
tion, the ninth life, or the nine-hundredth. 1 
know I am different from everyone else. The 
mere fact that I am me sets me apart. I am like 
my shadow, I can do magical things: I can slip 
through space, I can be an inch thick or a mile 
long. When the sun moves towards the horizon, 
everyone can see me, I am stretched along the 
quat, squashed and trampled upon by passing 
tourists. At other times, in the quiet stillness of 
night, I become invisible, I can go wheresoever 
I wish, unnoticed, ignored. It is then that I feel 
my vocation, for I know that I can see without 
being seen. But I must be careful! Should there 
be a full moon, it may well be that I become con- 
spicuous again! 
I am an object, a magical object, a apher, thought 
Mason. I will not write, tap words on a screen, as 
I would were I my author, Simon Lane. Instead, 
I will simply think, and my thoughts will be 
recorded for the benefit of all, proof of the inde- 
pendence of the spirit. I do not necessarily resent 
being a fictional character, the figment of an 
alien imagination, subject to the whims and fan- 
cies of an inebriate scribbler from Albion, but I 
feel I should set some form of example for the 
others, for that cowering multitude, immortal- 
ized, frozen within the pulp of literature. 
I can invent and dispose of characters with great 
alacrity. Its, after all, my profession, or hobby, 
rather, for I see myself as an amateur, nothing 
more, nothing less. Sometimes, I am generous, 
I permit my creations to live in luxury, so that 
they never have to work. I give them credit 
cards, I allow them to sit quietly in a state of 
indolence, fed on a perpetual diet of Belon oys- 
ters and Burgundy wine. I only do this, however, 
if they succeed in evolving from the potentiali- 
ties with which I first endow them.

Today, which is the day that never ends, I invent 
Mason Line. Mason Line is a non-descript char- 
acter with a tendency towards introspection. 
. As a fictional character, he is capable of thinking 
in a linear fashion. I like Mason. I have created 
him so that I can write about him and, by writing 
about him, find out who he is. We have never 
met, but we have a relationship which is litte 
short of perfect. I know everything there is to 
know about him and he knows absolutely 
nothing whatsoever about me. We never argue. 
We keep ourselves to ourselves. Familiarity, 
which we know to cause contempt, has never 
reared its ugly head. 
The sun is setting, The day, which is Mason’s life, 
is nearly over; and the person who checked into 
the hotel has vanished. Within the room, there

is no sign of his passing. Perhaps the man never 
existed at all, perhaps it was just me? But who am 
L, if Simon Lane is someone else? I put a cigarette 
to my mouth and light its tip with a match held 
shakily in my fingers. Is that really my hand, the 
same one which, but a moment ago, grasped 
the fountain pen, filled with invisible ink? I turn 
my hand over and inspect its palm. I cannot 
now make out the lines of destiny printed upon 
it. So I cannot tell whether or not it really is my 
hand. As opposed to someone else’s, that is. 
  
Because I am a reincarnation, because I am dif- 
ferent, I can see into the ltves of others, those who 
start out by being strangers but who might, 
eventually, become me. Yesterday, I was the 
protagonist in a sordid fable, inserted into the 
pages of a paperback hidden under the bed of a 
hotel room. Today, I am Mason Line, one of a 
pair of twins, the other half of which is a mis- 
chievous shadow. And tomorrow? Tomorrow 
rarely comes, but if it does, perhaps I shall be an 
old man, eighty-five instead of thirty-five, I shall 
feel pain in my limbs and lead in my heart. I shall 
move more slowly then and my thoughts will 
move in sympathy. 
Somewhere, behind the screen of my con- 
sciousness, lies a tale, infamous and exotic. But 
all T have to go on so far are a few, unrelated clues. 
I have Mason Line in the hotel room. And I 
have his shadow, taking a bath with him. Two 
men in a bath. What else? Well, there’s nothing 
in the room, no luggage, no trivia, no revelatory 
knick-knacks, just me, the third man, watching 
and waiting for something to happen. I am the 
observer, the invisible clement. Where, then, is 
Simon Lane, if I have become the narrator of this 
tale?

Pieces of music, music of pieces 
by Leon Milo 
| 
LEON MILO 
is an American composer and 
percussionist. A graduate of 
the Juilliard School of Music 
(New York), he has been 
working in France since 1989 
after receiving grants from the 
Fulbright Foundation. His 
compositions have been 
performed by the orchestra of 
Radio France and by the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic New 
Music Group. 
CCORDING to contemporary scientific 
theory, a “Big Bang” originating from an 
infinitesimally small and dense object pro- 
jected countless atomic particles into space, and 
these fragments, regrouping into an abundance of 
elements and matter, make up the expanding and, 
perhaps, eventually contracting universe. 
In 1941, the composer Arnold Schoenberg 
viewed “the Beginning” as a vision which only an 
omniscient force could embrace and realize. “To 
understand the nature of creation,” he wrote, 
“one must acknowledge that there was no light 
before the Lord said: ‘Let there be light. . . .’ 
“There was Light’ at once and in its ultimate per- 
fection... . Alas, human creators, if they be granted 
a vision, must travel a long path between vision 
and accomplishment. ... painstakingly connecting 
details until they fuse into a kind of organism.” 
To transform a vision into an object, in this case 
via musical composition, is a step-by-step opera- 
tion. Using an enormous vocabulary of symbols, 
a composer communicates detailed musical 
instructions to the performer while constantly 
keeping in mind the desired shape of the final 
work. 
A vision of the “whole” does not, of course, 
always appear to the artist as a flash of lightning 
suddenly illuminating a landscape that needs 
only to be transcribed onto canvas, paper or 
audio tape. Even if a piece of music (oddly, the 
word “piece” is used to describe an entire musical 
composition) has been inspired by a non-musical 
object or event that suggests a musical point of 
departure, a “Big Bang” for example, it still 
remains for the composer to organize, manipu- 
late and develop purely musical fragments into a 
form which will be comprehensible to listeners. 
“Object” and “fragment”: are these modern 
concepts? Do they have a relevance to our daily 
lives that is specifically modern? Let us take the 
dictionary definition of an object as “anything 
that 1s visible or tangible and is relatively stable in 
form.” It may also be something that “can be 
apprehended intellectually”, and in this sense 
could be applicable to a musical performance. A 
fragment is “a part broken off or detached”, some- 
thing that is by definition “incomplete” or “unfin- 
ished”. 
  
One composes music by combining sound 
elements to create a musical structure: a con- 
tinuum of sounds. Listening to music, one relies 
on memory to retain the succession of sounds that 
identifies the composition as an entity. If a listener 
is preoccupied with other matters or momen- 
tarily nods off during the performance, the con- 
tinuity is lost and he or she may wake up during 
the last movement completely confused by the 
sounds coming from the stage. Even if one is 
awake throughout the performance, has one wit- 
nessed a “relatively stable” musical object? 
By modifying the elements which make up the 
object, conductors, performers and acoustic con- 
ditions all influence the outcome of the com- 
poser’s vision and the reality that the listener expe- 
riences. If a musical performance were completely 
stable we would not have a multitude of record- 
ings of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. One would 
suffice. 
FROM STABILITY 
TO 
FRAGMENTATION 
The composer’ job is to build unity within a 
composition so as to ensure that it is compre- 
hensible to the listener. This will hopefully out- 
weigh the various chance factors that occur during 
performance. 
Before the twentieth century, certain con- 
ventions of form developed that brought a degree 
of stability and comprehensibility to musical 
compositions. Before hearing the first perfor- 
mance of a piano concerto in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, an educated listener already knew many 
things about it. The concerto would probably 
have three movements—medium fast, slow, and 
fast—with a solo cadenza section leading up to the 
final chords, or coda. This cadenza was intended 
to offer the soloist some freedom of expression, 
imposing a minimum of constraints and enabling 
him to show musicianship and virtuosity. As 
time went by, even this “unstable” section of the 
piece became more controlled, until finally the 
cadenzas were entirely written out by the com- 
poser. So much “stability” and “built-in memory” 
were present in music by the end of the nine- 
teenth century that composers could not find

“superimposition” and “dissociation”. He 
describes his work in social terms, calling it “post- 
humanist” architecture that disperses the “force 
of social regulation”. 
In literature, compare the novels of Henry 
James with the “stream of consciousness” writing 
of James Joyce, or the poetry of Wordsworth 
with the fragmented style of e.c. cummings, 
which obliges the reader to reconstruct the dis- 
persed letters, words and ideas on the page. The 
cubist painter Georges Braque concisely made the 
point when he said: “I do not believe in things but 
in relations between things.” 
VOYAGING 
INSIDE SOUNDS 
Each artist now finds his or her own underlying 
system. Each work must find its own compre- 
hensible form and create its own universe. Michel 
Zbar’s Contacts for trombone (1973) is an example 


### 94905: Pieces of music, music of pieces

of how the composer can “liberate” the performer. 
The form of the piece is almost entirely decided by 
the trombonist, following his own routes while 
choosing pitches, rhythms and dynamics from 
the pallets of musical fragments provided within 
cach stopping-off point. Visually this resembles 
the screen image from the computer music pro- 
gram MAX, which allows a composer or per- 
former to enter sounds via microphone or elec- 
tronic keyboard and transform them in countless 
ways when routed to various “object” boxes that 
he or she controls via computer. 
Tristan Murail, one of the founders of “spec- 
tral” music in France, ts a composer whose 
choices of basic musical materials and method of 
construction draw on the laws of natural sci- 
ence. With the aid of computers and techniques

Coordination Acoustique-Musique (IRCAM) 
in Paris, Murail analyses the harmonic spectrum 
or overtone series present when specific tones are 
produced on various instruments. 
Overtones are frequencies higher than the 
fundamental pitch which occur whenever a note 
1s sounded. The presence or absence of over- 
tones and their balance in relation to the funda- 
mental determine the “timbre” or “tone colour” 
of a sound. This explains why we can discern 
the difference between an identical pitch played 
on a flute and an oboe. In his composition Dés- 
intégrations, for seventeen instruments and clec- 
tronic tape, it is as if Murail took a magnifying 
glass to view the minute details of the sounds 
which make up the raw material of the piece. 
The title refers to the composer’s process of “voy- 
aging inside the sounds”. The sounds are broken 
down and fragmented to display their constituent 
parts. In one part of the work, “the brilliant 
clouds of high chimes are derived from the dis- 
integration of the timbres (overtones) of flute, 
clarinet and muted trombone.” 
The contemporary German composer Karl- 
heinz Stockhausen devises specific methods of 
working, new underlying principles and con- 
straints for cach new composition. His pieces 
have often been criticized on their first perfor- 
mance but have later come to be regarded as 
accomplished works which shed light on new 
techniques of construction and new modes of 
comprehension. 
“I build a whole tree of different generations 
of inter-relating moments. . . . I control how 
much they have in common,” Stockhausen has 
written about his work Momente (1961) for four 
choirs and thirteen instrumentalists. “Instead of 
starting with something very homogencous and

then breaking the homogeneity . . . the tradi- 
tional concept of building a musical continuum 
. .. I start with completely separate instants.” 
These “moments” are fragments of musical mate- 
rial, each exhibiting a unique character (melodic, 
chordal or even rhythmic) and obeying a set of 
rules that determines how often they appear and 
how much they have in common. 
In the language of the French composer Pierre 
Boulez the term “object” takes on a special 
meaning in relation to music. For Boulez, a piece 
of musical material is not regarded as being “unfin- 
ished” or a “broken off” fragment, but rather as 
a potential musical object which is the starting 
point or model for a “structure”. It is an entity 
whose possibilities for being transformed into a 
musical object depend on the way in which its 
potentialities are unlocked and on its behaviour in 
relation to other potential musical objects. 
Let us take, for example, a chord played on the 
piano in the low register comprised of five notes. 
This objet unitaire or solitary object is the point 
of departure. It has certain characteristics which, 
when exploited and put into a context, could 
define it as part of a musical form. If this five-note

middle register, certain relationships begin to 
become comprehensible. 
A “structure” is created in which the two 
objects are linked to each other and can have a rela- 
tionship with other objects and structures that 
follow. As the American composer John Cage 
has shown, even musically “foreign” objects such 
as car horns or tin cans become musical objects 
when put into a suitable context. Objects create 
structures and form is created by the “struc- 
turing” of these local structures in their turn. 
The terms that I have attempted to define 
The moment it becomes detached from the 
larger structure it can be regarded as a new 
entity, an object made up of its own unique 
possibilities of transformation. 
But this takes us back to the “Big Bang”: 
there too one fragmented object brought forth 
numerous independent and interdependent 
objects harmonizing with each other to create a 
large object, in that case the universe. = 67

### 94906: Rimbaud's quest

Rimbaud’s quest 
by Sami Nair 
  
“fabulous opera”, radicalized and trans- 
formed the great modernist anguish which 
originated with Baudelaire. In Rimbaud and 
Baudelaire modernity found its most illustrious 
representatives and perhaps its harshest critics. 
Through their deliberate efforts to transcend 
themselves, they both experienced the feeling of 
time’s fundamental newness, of its endless accel- 
eration and of the wounds it inflicts—and 
through the brilliant success of their testimony 
they also demonstrated time’s ambiguity. 
What else do they have in common? Both 
felt that the modern age fundamentally shifts the 
boundaries of the sacred. What Baudelaire com- 
plained of was the disappearance of aura—the 
halo of spirituality that hovered over human 
beings and objects—beneath the weight of a 
growing materialism and dehumanization of the 
relations between peoples, the spirit of calculation, 
and the horrifying philosophy of positivism—the 
iron heel crushing fragile humanity. As for Rim- 
baud, he dreamed even in youth of escape from 
tedium—the anonymity and tedium of an age 
in which everything was reduced to statistics. 
Escape from his home town of Charleville to 
Paris, from Paris to the Orient, from the Orient 
to Nothingness. 
At the very start of his quest he called for 
revolt in the name of art and defined creation as 
the profanation of all the modern age holds 
sacred. “One must be absolutely modern,” he 
wrote in the collection of prose-poems entitled 
Une Saison en Enfer. 
Absolutely modern! Whatever can this mean? 
Not simply—this is the poet’s cry, let’s not forget— 
desanctifying all kinds of knowledge, power and 
belief. But also, and especially, life itself: 
Seen enough. The vision has been 
encountered in every air. 
Had enough. The noise of towns. . . . 
Known enough. The halts of life. . . 
(“Départ”, Illuminations) 
The problem of modernity is thus revealed: it 
paralyzes itself with its own complacency. All too 
often are we reminded, as though his youthful 
flashes of genius had been nothing but a kind of 
bolt from the blue, that Rimbaud was terribly 
afflicted by the evil genius of time. But by 
R IMBAUD’s quest, which he described as a

choosing flight and renouncing art, was he not 
simply, in an all-too-human fashion, running 
away from the vast abyss his vision had opened 
up before him? 
For even as a youth, already in flight “from 
every moral Jaw”, he grasped with disconcerting 
lucidity the poetic revolution he bore within 
himself. In his famous letter to Paul Demeny in 
May 1871, returning to a theme that he had 
already raised in his correspondence with Georges 
Izambard, he wrote: 
I say you have to be a visionary, make yourself 
a visionary.

standing of his visions, he will at least have seen 
them! So what if be is destroyed on his ecstatic flight 
through things unheard-of, unnameable. . . 
By disorganization of the senses, Rimbaud 
means neither decadent behaviour nor degen- 
erate values. He wants to go further: to set aside 
standards and conventions in order to perceive the 
Unknown. To penetrate the Unknown 1s to 
become Wise, to discover the duality of Being, the

principle of Good and Evil, of their felicitous 
and infinite combination. 
This passage to the other side of existence, the 
other side of a self-satisfied modernity, is made at 
the cost of a true cathartic experience governed by 
madness and disease, sacrilege and malediction. 
The poet perceives what the run-of-the-mill imag- 
ination cannot conceive of: “If,” writes Rimbaud, 
“what he brings from down there has form, he 
gives it form; if it is formless, he makes it formless.” 
Here we see the poet both as a “stealer of fire” and 
as the creator of a new “language”. Art must over- 
turn and transcend the boundaries of the known, 
the familiar, the visible—of possession and power. 
“The poet,” Rimbaud adds, “should define the 
amount of unknown awakening in his time in the 
universal soul....” 
The poet, then, is on the other side of Time. He 
is not within Time, he is ahead of it. To be 
absolutely modern is to see the world’s time from 
ahead. Poets are citizens of this new time; they 
dwell in it in their innermost selves because they 
are bringers of fire—the fire that consumes what 
exists. The poet seeks, not to annihilate, but to 
become that “not too discontented citizen of a 
metropolis considered modern because every 
known taste has been avoided. ...” (“Ville”, 1l/u- 
minations) 
While Baudelaire takes his contemporaries’ 
anguish as a starting-point the better to immure 
himself within it, Rimbaud attacks the surfeit 
oozing from every pore of society. He is on the 
side of a “ferocious philosophy” which says “let 
the rest of the world go to hell”. It is hardly sur- 
prising that the surrealists found in him a kindred 
spirit. What if one aspect of modernity should be 
the overthrow of the modern, the rejection of 
what exists at a given moment? What if being 
modern entails making a virtue of Negation, as the 
Stoics did of pain? Steering a course for the 
unknown, attempting the leap to the other side of 
the precipice: 
1 am an inventor of very different merit from 
all those who have preceded me. . . . I am dedi- 
cated to a new confusion. . . . I expect to turn into 
a very troublesome madman. 
(“Vies”, Illuminations) 
This may sound pretentious. But what should 
we expect poets to do? Recite the litany of our 
mediocrity, to glorify it? Turn their attention 
from the present towards the past? This is Hei- 
degger’s thesis: that poets, discoverers of Being, 
and therefore of the very Source, make an inquiry 
into the deepest resources of language, and hence 
that their attention is fixed on the past. 
This may well be true for the German romantic 
poets like Holderlin, and perhaps even for the 
nineteenth-century French romantics who 
regarded the return to the source—the journey to 
the Orient—as an initiation test for the conquest 
of Truth and Beauty. But nothing of this sort 
applies to Rimbaud. His revolutionary modernity 
is entirely directed towards the future: he chal- 
lenges romanticism in the name of a radically 
individualist libertarianism. This modernity of 
Rimbaud’s is no acquiescent passivity before the 
disruptive force of science and technology, but 
rather a quality of soul, a state of subjectivity, a kind 
of spirituality, what is meant by the German word 
Stimmung. Even more, it is opening towards the 
elsewhere, getting an edge on the sacred, greeting 
the breath of genius: “Let us know how to hail him 
and see him, . . . follow his vision, his breath, his 
body, his light.” (“Génie”, Illuminations) 
Perhaps we are incapable of greeting in this 
way; perhaps we are too cautious to understand 
the poet’s fire. But the artist, in moments of hap- 
piness—which is to say in the states of rapture 
which accompany true creation—greets the 
Unknown and presents it to us as an offering. The 
face of the young Rimbaud is emblematic of this 
experience. That is why it is so unforgettably, 
outrageously beautiful. 
There is a contemporary artist with the Bib- 
lical name of Luc Simon whose entire work is a 
testimony to this Rimbaldian beauty. Rimbaud on 
the walls of Paris in 1968, or astride the ruins of 
another wall, now happily destroyed, in Berlin in 
1989—Rimbaud the poet of our hopes and our 
suffering, as youthful as adolescence, novelty, 
Rimbaud eternally seeking “truthina soul and a 
body”. (“Adieu”, Une Saison en Enfer). |

A FRIEND IN NEED 
To improve water management in 
Africa's arid Sahel region, a new 
network, known as FRIEND, has been 
set up under the auspices of UNESCO's 
International Hydrological Programme. 
An acronym for Flow Regimes from 
International and Network Data Sets, 
FRIEND will collect and centralize 
hydrological data from nine countries 
of central and west Africa: Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central 
African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, 
Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali and Chad. 
Most of the region’s drainage basins 
extend across national boundaries, so 
the information available within 
individual countries is usually not 
complete. Compiling the data will help 
the countries plan their water use, 
dams and irrigation schemes on a 
more rational basis.

SAYING THE CHILDREN 
On | April, the Director-General of 
UNEesco, Mr. Federico Mayor, 
presented the Organization's gold 
medal of Dubrovnik to Helmut 
Thoma, Director-General of RTL, 
Germany's largest private television 
station. The award honoured Thoma's 
contribution to the success of 
“Children in Need”, a fund-raising 
campaign launched in Germany by 
UNesco Goodwill Ambassador Ure 
Ohoven in October 1992. More than 
$1.6 million have been raised, most of 
which will go to Bosnian refugee 
children. The rest will help fund 
educational resource centres in 
Somalia and basic education 
programmes for street children in Viet 
Nam, Mexico and Romania.

FROM THE DOUBLE HELIX 
T0 THE HUMAN GENOME 
Nearly 300 scientists, including 14 
Nobel Prize-winners, gathered at 
Unesco Headquarters in Paris in April 
for a symposium to mark the 40th 
anniversary of the discovery of the 
double helix. Among those present 
were Francis Crick and James Watson, 
who in 1953 made the discovery of 
the helical (spiral-ladder-shaped) 
structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) molecule which carries our 
genetic information, thereby opening 
the way for a new branch of science, 
molecular genetics. Discussions at the 
3-day symposium focussed on the 
“state of the art” in molecular genetics 
and the directions it is taking. More 
than fifty papers were presented, 
notably on the organization of the 
human genome, genetic diseases, and 
the ethical and legal issues raised by 
genetic experimentation.

PEOPLE AND PLANTS 
To further the conservation of plant 
species and knowledge of their use, 
UNESCO, the World Wide Fund for 
Nature (WWF) and the Royal Botanic 
Gardens Kew (UK) have launched a 
project entitled “People and Plants: 
Ethnobotany and the Sustainable Use 
of Plant Resources”. The aim of the 
project is to bring ethnobotanists and 
local people together in order to 
study traditional ways of using plant 
resources, with a view to improving 
the life of rural populations in 
developing countries. Five manuals will 
be produced, first in English and then 
in Spanish and possibly in other 
languages later. The subjects chosen 
are: invasive plants; ethnobotany and 
conservation; priority sites for plant 
conservation; the sustainable use of 
wild plants; and plant conservation 
databases. For further information,

Listing 
Pagan's monuments 
Pagan (in what is now Myanmar) 
became capital of the first unified 
Burmese kingdom (1044-1287) during 
the reign of King Anoratha. Today there 
are more than 2,000 monuments at 
Pagan—about half the number 
recorded in an inventory ordered by 
King Mohnyin in the 15th century. 
Earthquakes have since taken a heavy 
toll, but the site remains one of the 
world’s most spectacular Buddhist sites. 
The Burmese, an animist people 
originally from central Asia, were con- 
verted to Buddhism by King Anoratha 
(1044-1077), a great military leader 
who also built many temples, monas- 
teries and stupas as well as a Pitakat 
Taik (library) for the Pitaka, or scrip- 
tures, he had had brought from Thaton, 
capital of the vanquished Mén people. 
These religious edifices were con- 
structed of brick rather than the wood 
and bamboo used for domestic pur- 
poses. Among Anoratha’s most remark- 
able constructions were the temple of 
Ananda, the magnificent Shwe-Hsan- 
Daw stupa {built to house a hair of the 
Buddha), and the Shwezigon stupa, 
completed in the reign of his successor 
King Kyanzittha, which Marco Polo was 
to call the “Golden Pagoda”. 
In the wake of a devastating earth- 
quake that struck Pagan on 8 July 1975, 
a decision was taken to make, with 
UNESCO's participation, a systematic 
inventory of the monuments of Pagan. 
Started in 1982, the “Inventory Pro- 
ject” has collected data for 2,260 mon- 
uments, each one of which will be fea- 
tured, complete with line drawings, 
photographs and descriptive notes, in a 
nine-volume Inventory of Monuments at 
Pagan by Pierre Pichard. The first 
volume (ISBN | 870838 01 7), pub- 
lished jointly by Kiscadale Ltd., the Ecole 
Frangaise d'Extréme-Orient (EFEQ)

of current concern

### 94913: Commentary by Federico Mayor

‘They could have done so much, 
but dared to do so little...’ 
am convinced that in the years ahead it is going to 
be essential to be able to train fully-fledged citizens, 
who will feel that unless they are participating in 
the life of their community they do not exist. And in 
order to exist, in order to exercise their responsibilities 
as citizens, they will need access to knowledge. Edu- 
cation is not only instilling knowledge, but awakening 
the immense creative potential that lies within each of 
us, enabling all of us to develop our capacities to the full, 
the better to contribute to the societies in which we live. 
With regard to the dissemination of scientific and 
technical knowledge, it is borne in on me every day 
how sadly scientific information is lacking in the deci- 
sion-making process. Far too many decisions with 
far-reaching consequences—in the domains of energy 
and the environment, for example—are influenced by 
the emotions. It is our responsibility to provide deci- 
sion-makers with absolutely reliable data enabling 
them to reach objective conclusions. 
I also feel that there are two ideas that we should 
push as hard as we can to have accepted and applied. 
The first is linked to lifelong education: the educa- 
tional process can no longer be defined as the acquisi- 
tion of knowledge which precedes entry into the 
working world. It is—and will of necessity become 
increasingly—a protean process extending over an 
entire lifetime and covering a variety of activities. 
The second concept is that of educational partnership. 
When we think of education, we think of the state. 
However, the responsibility for education is not the 
state’s alone; it is incumbent upon civil society at all its 
levels and in all its structures. For it is only by making 
the whole of society aware of its duty to take up the chal- 
lenge of education that we will be able to lay a firm 
foundation for the training of fully-fledged citizens. 
At this point, a word about higher education. To my 
mind, this level of education has too long been con- 
sidered a luxury, and thus passed over by the developing 
countries in favour of basic education, which has 
attracted all the attention. It is true that higher educa- 
tion 1s only available to a privileged group of young 
people: 92 per cent of the world’s eighteen- to twenty- 
three-year-olds do not have access to it. All the more 
reason to be extremely demanding of those who do! 
Society should make these young elites realize that 
they are already part of the social fabric, and have 
responsibilities to shoulder. At university, they must 
learn to take the initiative, and begin to place their 
imaginations and energies in the service of the trans- 
formations that this new era is demanding of all mem- 
bers of the community. 
Finally, I should like to underscore the importance 
of education in enhancing mutual understanding and 
promoting co-operation between peoples. In a world 
where distances are shrinking and differences abound, 
there is nothing to be gained by locking the door and 
withdrawing into oneself. The best way to survive, 
and at the same time add a new dimension to one’s life, 
is to learn to live with others, and to listen to what they 
have to say. Tolerance does not mean “tolerating” 
others, but getting to know, understand, respect, and— 
why not?—admire them. 
What is needed most today, what young people— 
and particularly teenagers who are about to complete 
their secondary studies—are demanding of us more or 
less explicitly, 1s guidance to help them chart their 
course. Unless we supply them with this without delay, 
we risk witnessing major social upheavals. We must 
take action, even at the risk of making mistakes. The 
worst of all would be to do nothing in the face of the 
intolerable. 
We are not prepared to rise to all the challenges of 
the future—poverty, population, the environment, 
ethnic coexistence—because we are still working with 
the tools of the past. We must remedy this situation as 
quickly as possible, so that our grandchildren will not 
speak of us with Camus’ terrible words: “They could 
» have done so much, but dared to do so little...” =

### 94908: Santísima Trinidad: memories of slavery and sugar

Santisima Trinidad, memories of 
slavery and sugar 
south-east of Havana on Cuba's 
southern coast, a jewel of colonial 
architecture lies far from the bustle of the 
modern world. Backing onto the El Escam- 
bray massif, whose foothills, the Gua- 
muhaya, take their name from the region's 
former indigenous people, the town of 
Santisima Trinidad has not many more 
than 30,000 inhabitants. Its narrow cob- 
bled streets are flanked by eighteenth- and 
nineteenth-century churches and palaces, 
and by houses adorned with wooden- 
railed balconies and wrought-iron grilles 
through which magnificent, Andalusian- 
style garden courtyards can be glimpsed. 
Every now and then a horse-drawn cart 
with squeaking wheels emerges from a 
side-street. Further on a mule laden with 
jars of drinking water ambles along. No 
cars or motorcycles disturb the town’s 
timeless peace. 
Memories of the past of Santisima 
Trinidad, which was included on UNEsco’s 
World Heritage List in 1988, are concen- 
trated around the Plaza Mayor. Here, giant 
palm-trees adorn the square-shaped cen- 
tral garden where young and old come to 
sit as evening falls. Overlooking the Plaza 
T HREE hundred and eighty kilometres are the Convent of San Francisco, the 
church of the Santisima Trinidad and a 
number of noble houses. 
The most imposing of these houses is 
that which once belonged to Nicolas de La 
Cruz y Brunet, the owner of sugar planta- 
tions and hundreds of slaves, who in 1836 
was made a count by the King of Spain. 
The ochre-walled palace was built 
between 1740 and 1808. Its ground floor 
gives onto an inner patio considered to 
be one of the most beautiful of its kind in 
Cuba. The first floor, which now houses the 
Romantic Museum, has a cedarwood 
ceiling and furniture of precious local 
wood. Chandeliers of Bohemian glass, 
Sevres vases, Spanish and Dutch porce- 
lain and French clocks decorate the 
boudoirs and salons. There is even a 
by Edouard Bailby 
marble bath and two splendid spittoons 
that were imported from England. The 
Brunet Palace, which was restored a few 
years ago, is a monument to the wealth of 
the great families of Trinidad in the late 
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
1 
AN ARISTOCRACY OF SUGAR 
Trinidad is the third oldest town in Cuba. 
It was founded in 1514 by Diego Velazquez, 
who had just completed the conquest of 
theisland, the Caribbean's largest. He knew 
that there were gold mines in a nearby 
valley, and as a result built a small fort and 
half a dozen houses a few kilometres from 
the coast. Fifty metres from the Plaza 
Mayor stands the jigiie, a great tree planted 
the day the city was founded, on the spot 
where the first Mass was celebrated. A 
commemorative plaque honours the 
memory of Bartolomé de Las Casas, an 
ardent champion of the indigenous inhab- 
itants who were massacred or reduced to 
slavery by the conquistadors. 
After suffering on several occasions from

### 94908: Santísima Trinidad: memories of slavery and sugar

the depredations of the pirates and cor- 
sairs who scoured the Caribbean, Trinidad 
relapsed into tropical languor. Far from 
Havana, the seat of the island's governors 
and the crossroads of the main lines of 
communication, it turned away from the 
outside world and lived for two and a half 
centuries on its sparse crops and the valu- 
able timber grown nearby. In August 1762, 
it was abruptly awakened from its torpor 
when, after a two-month siege, the British 
seized the port of Havana, imposing on 
Cuba free trade with the rest of the world. 
In the eleven months during which the 
island was occupied, a thousand ships 
unloaded tons of merchandise and hun- 
* dreds of African slaves. 
After the British withdrew (accepting 
Florida in exchange), the Creoles— 
Spaniards born in Cuba—soon realized 
that free trade favoured their interests 
against those of the government in Madrid. 
The successful sugar-cane producers 
extended their estates beyond the 
provinces of Havana and Matanzas, 
forming the nucleus of the sacarocracia, 
the sugar aristocracy whose influence was 
to be crucial in shaping the island's history. 
Their ambitions were furthered by the 
arrivalin 1791 of large numbers of refugees 
from Haiti, where plantations and 
refineries had been burned down by thou- 
sands of slaves under the leadership of 
Toussaint I'Quverture. This unexpected 
influx of labour at Cuba's eastern tip and in 
the Trinidad region gave a boost to the 
economy. 
Determined to win from the British and 
French colonies the monopoly of sugar 
exports to Europe, the owners of the 
Cuban plantations began to organize 
themselves. Five leading planters, who 
between them owned dozens of refineries, 
took control of the slave trade, thereby 
enabling themselves to increase produc- 
tion. The slaves led a wretched life on the 
ingenios, vast estates that gradually spread 
over the island at the expense of the forests 
and their rare species of trees. They worked 
sixteen hours a day, with only one small 
meal around midday. The day began and 
ended with prayers signalled by the plan- 
tation bell, which was also used to sound 
the alarm if a slave escaped or a fire broke 
out. The forty-five-metre-high Iznaga 
Tower, the only surviving monument from 
this era, still marks the entrance to one of 
the great plantations of the San Luis Valley, 
outside Trinidad. It has been completely 
‘restored and is now topped by an obser- 
vation post and a belfry with fluted 
columns. 
On the estate known as the Santisima 
Trinidad-—most Cuban ingenios had 
names associated with the Christian reli- 
gion—Estebdn José Santa Cruz de Oviedo 
prided himself on possessing the largest 
criadero de criollos (literally, “negro stock- 
farm”). There, penned like cattle, the chil- 
dren of slaves were prepared for the work 
they would have to start at the age of 
twelve. Their mothers were only allowed to 
see them once every ten days. Don 
Esteban exchanged or sold them at will. 
His wife was sterile, but he had twenty- 
six mulatto children. As a good father, he 
sent his offspring to study in New York. 
The six best students were rewarded with 
a trip to Paris. 
AN ILLUSTRIOUS GUEST 
By the end of the eighteenth century, the 
wealth of the plantations enabled 
Trinidad’s planters to build themselves 
magnificent homes. The Padrén family 
residence, at the corner of Desengafio 
Street, today houses a Museum of Archae- 
ology, and the Municipal History Museum 
occupies the former home of the Justo 
German Cantero family. Trinidad’s patri- 
cian families have left traces of their 
grandeur all over the town. Devoutly 
Catholic, they contributed generously to 
the building of churches and convents. In 
the convent of St. Francis of Assisi, an 
  
unusual museum recalls memories of 
bandit-hunting and the struggle waged 
by the people of Trinidad against both 
internal and external enemies. 
Trinidad is proud to count among its 
guests Alexander von Humboldt, the cel- 
ebrated German naturalist and explorer, 
who spent forty-eight hours there on his 
first visit to Cuba, between December 1800 
and March 1801. After leaving the port of 
Batabano, on the south coast, the boat in 
which he was travelling was forced to put 
in at the mouth of the River Guaurabo, 
half a dozen kilometres from Trinidad, in 
order to take on drinking water. The gov- 
ernor of the region, a nephew of the 
astronomer Antonio Ulloa, welcomed 
Humboldt with all the respect due to such 
a distinguished figure, and the rich planter 
Antonio Padrén gave a reception in his 
honour that was attended by Trinidad high 
society. Humboldt gives a detailed account 
of his stay in his correspondence, notably 
describing an ascent of Popa hill, where an 
eighteenth-century church still stands, in

Impressed by the welcome he received 
from the leading families of Trinidad— 
and this despite his well-known distaste for 
slavery—Humboldt resumed his sea- 
journey on the night of 15 March 1801. As 
he left, a local priest and occasional poet

REFLECTIONS 
  
RADITIONS for Tomorrow is a non-gov- 
ernmental organization which is 
active in most parts of Central and 
South America, where it supports the 
struggle of the descendants of the pre- 
Columbian peoples to preserve their cul- 
tural identity. It was founded in 1986, and 
has had an official working relationship 
with UNEsco since 1992. 
Traditions for Tomorrow does not try to 
persuade the groups with which it works to 
return to their traditional ways but rather 
to take their traditions into account when 
building their future. The support that it is 
asked to provide is always the result of a 
spontaneous initiative from a local com- 
munity and is designed to increase that 
community’s awareness of the value of a 
traditional form of cultural expression in 
such fields as language, ritual, medicine, 
handicrafts, dance, music or education. 
Traditions for Tomorrow uses the word 
culture in its widest possible sense as the 
expression of a way of life. The type of 
back-up the organization provides is 
designed to supplement aid available from 
other bodies working in the fields of health 
care and material welfare. 
Our relations with those with whom we 
work—people such as the Maya peasants 
of the Guatemala highlands, the Cuna fish- 
ermen who live on the San Blas Islands 
off the coast of Panama, the Aymara shep- 
herds of the shores of Lake Titicaca—are 
based on mutual respect. Each side makes 
a contribution of equal value. The financial 
support we provide is neither more nor 
less indispensable to a given project than 
the expertise and motivation of our part- 
ners on the spot. A preliminary encounter 
takes place in the field before any com- 
mitment is made. This is an opportunity 
for us to listen, to look, and to take stock of 
the situation, not an attempt to impose 
or even to suggest a specific course of 
action. The main goal of Traditions for 
Tomorrow is to help people to realize that 
cultural identity is an asset that can serve 
development. How can there be any devel- 
opment if people do not assume respon- 
sibility for their own lives? Qur work pro- 
vides its beneficiaries with their first 
opportunity to take full charge of the 
administration of a project. 
A sense of community is one of the main

factors favouring the survival of minority 
groups in Latin America. However, as a 
result of various religious, administrative, 
educational and economic factors, the 
cement that binds communities together 
has been gradually eroded. In addition, 
many forms of aid sidetrack the sense of 
community and associate it with imported 
modes of organization that are often ill- 
adapted to the local situation. The pro- 
jects supported by Traditions for 
Tomorrow seek to strengthen traditional 
community structures within the frame- 
work of activities which have always been 
associated with the community in ques- 
tion. 
Three specific experiences, in Panama, 
Ecuador and Chile respectively, provide a 
good illustration of the organization's work. 
A CULTURAL CONGRESS IN THE 
SAN BLAS ISLANDS 
In recent decades the 40,000 Cuna Indians 
who live in the San Blas archipelago off 
These Afro-Ecuadorian children in 
San Lorenzo (Ecuador) meet every day for 
traditional dancing. 
  
the Caribbean coast of Panama have 
assimilated the Western-type structures 
of mainland Panamanian society. Because 
space is limited many of the islanders have 
migrated to Panama City, but these 
migrants have, in spite of being uprooted, 
succeeded in maintaining close links with 
their homeland, “Cuna Yala”. 
The Cuna have won an international 
reputation for having preserved a large 
degree of autonomy. However, frequent 
contact with Panamanian society has 
begun a process of acculturation, above all 
among young people, especially where 
religion and spiritual life are concerned. To 
halt this erosion, which they regard as a 
threat to their internal cohesion and to 
their eventual survival as a people, the 
Cuna created in 1972 a “General Congress 
of Cuna Culture” which meets for four or 
five days several times a year, each time in 
a different place, and is attended by all 
their religious leaders, who are the 
guardians of tradition. These meetings, 
with their prayers, festivities, dances and 
the commemoration of Cuna heroes, bring 
together people from nearby islands and 
create a bond between the Cuna people. 
The Cuna have asked Traditions for 
Tomorrow to help them to buy two motor 
boats to enable representatives of different 
communities to attend meetings of the 
Congress. They have also asked us for help 
in acquiring technical and office equip- 
ment that the young people will need to 
carry out, under the auspices of the Con- 
gress, an in-depth survey on the history 
and use of medicinal plants. The results of 
the survey will be published. 
IDERTITY AND SCHOOLING 
For some time the Saraguro Indians of the 
Tenta region of Ecuador have been 
unhappy about the schooling that the 
Quito-based educational system imposed 
on their children. From the age of four, 
their children had to leave behind in the 
school cloakroom not only their tradi- 
tional clothing, but their language 
(Quechua), the knowledge they had 
received from their parents, and their spe- 
cific ways of thinking. What they learned 
from their teachers, most of whom did

not speak Quechua, was remote from their 
way of life and pushed them to become 
school dropouts. 
In reaction to this, in the late 1980s the 
people of Tenta used local construction 
methods to build their own education 
centre where they could teach a syllabus, 
devised by themselves, which consists of 
adapted forms of the subjects taught at 
the state schools and is complemented by 
initiation in manual, cultural and pro- 
ductive activities. The five teachers are 
members of the community and were 
chosen by it. Their teaching calls for close 
collaboration with the local people. The 
results obtained since 1988 have been so 
satisfactory that the school has been given 
official status by the government. Today 
some of its pupils have finished their pri- 
mary schooling, and for the first time chil- 
dren from Tenta are going to be enrolled at 
the secondary school in the nearby town. 
Traditions for Tomorrow responded 
favourably to a request to help the school 
obtain equipment. The money has been 
used to improve the building and to buy 
equipment such as a loom, printing 
machinery, farm and woodworking tools, 
sewing machines, clothes and musical 
instruments. 
 
ANDEAN CARNIVAL 
In the last fifteen years, drought, mine clo- 
sures and overcrowding in the outskirts 
of La Paz (Bolivia), have driven the Aymara 
and Quechua Indians down from the 
Chilean and Bolivian altiplano to the fer- 
tile valleys of the Arica region in northern 
Chile. From a way oflife centred on the vil- 
lage, traditional customs and the family 
unit, hundreds of families suddenly found 
themselves in a state of economic depen- 
dence in a land that was not their own. 
The newcomers found that Chilean society 
was often difficult for them to enter. The 
younger generation, which has no experi- 
ence ofits Andean origins and which feels 
rejected by the majority society, is giving 
way to delinquency (drugs, alcohol, pros- 
titution), thereby making the gulf between 
the two societies even wider. 
During carnival week, the Indians of the 
Arica region have tried in recent years to 
recreate in the Azapa valley an event that 
 
would rekindle the spirit of the Andean 
tradition and reunite this exiled popula- 
tion. First spontaneously, then in a more 
organized fashion, the “carnaval Andino” 
(“Andean carnival”) of San Miguel has 
gradually become for the Quechua and 
Aymara a meeting point between past and 
future, an annual break during which 
young and old alike return to their roots 
and renew the links that traditionally 
bound their community together. 
Since the return of democracy, those 
involved with the carnival have created 
an association which, with the support of 
Traditions for Tomorrow, is now working to 
build a headquarters where meetings and 
cultural events can be held. Traditions for 
Tomorrow has also assembled a stock of 
costumes and traditional Andean musical 
instruments for the carnival. The organi- 
zation has received official recognition 
from the government of Chile for this pro- 
ject, which in 1992 was also recognized 
by UnEesco’s World Decade for Cultural 
Development. [|

Mahmoud Mokhtar 
(1891-1934) 
by Magdi Youssef 
the art of statuary, which had flourished to 
an outstanding degree during Antiquity, 
went into a long decline as a result of Islam's rejec- 
tion of representations of the human figure on 
the grounds that they were an insult to the divine 
privilege of creation. Bowing to this interdict, 
Muslim artists turned to experimentation with 
“abstract” forms that were simultaneously real 
and visionary, as can be seen in calligraphy, the 
arabesque and Arab-Islamic architecture. 
Egypt's contacts with Europe during the Enlight- 
enment, culminating in the invasion by Napoleon 
Bonaparte at the end of the eighteenth century, led 
to a change of attitude towards the “modern” 
plastic arts. However it was not until 1908 that 
Cairo followed the example of Western cities and 
acquired a school of fine arts and that young 
people began to show enthusiasm for sculpture as 
a creative discipline, 
One student who enrolled at the school in the 
year it opened was eighteen-year-old Mahmoud 
Mokhtar. He distinguished himself as a sculptor, 
and in 1911 won a scholarship to study in Paris, 
where Rodin and Maillol reigned as the undis- 
puted masters. 
At this period, Egyptian society was seeking to 
define a modern frame of reference for its cul- 
tural identity, as a platform for national and polit- 
“ical demands. Mokhtar was still living in Paris 
when the Egyptian revolution of 1919 broke out. 
With the clamour of Egyptian crowds echoing in 
his mind, Mokhtar conceived his most important 
work, The Renaissance of Egypt. He exhibited a 
scale model of it and dreamed of returning to 
Cairo to continue his work there. 
A T the beginning of the Muslim era in Egypt, Like his predecessors in ancient Egypt, Mokhtar 
wanted his statue to live for ever. He decided to 
execute the monumental work in Aswan granite, 
the stone that Egyptian sculptors had used at the 
time of the Pharaohs. The costs of his project were 
more than the government could afford, however, 
and so a subscription was launched. Completed in 
1928, the statue became a cultural landmark, 
inspiring a number of poets and writers, including 
Tewfik el-Hakim. 
The Renaissance of Egypt, which is four metres 
long and three metres high, depicts a lion with a 
man’s head (an allusion to the Sphinx of Giza) beside 
which stands a proud peasant woman, one of whose 
hands is placed on the lion's head as though she is 
holding the animal back; with the other she draws 
aside the veil that covers her face. Both figures are 
looking in the same direction, perhaps towards a 
new dawn, towards the rising sun, symbol of res- 
urrection for the ancient Egyptians. 
In addition to this masterpiece and a number of 
monuments that adorn the squares of Cairo and 
Alexandria, Mahmoud Mokhtar executed a large 
number of sculptures, which can be seen today in 
the museum—recently restored by the Egyptian 
Ministry of Culture—that bears his name. They 
depict peasant men and women at work and dis- 
play a masterly power of execution and a perfect 
balance of planes and volumes. At the entrance to 
the museum stands one of Mokhtar’s major works, 
The Keeper of the Secret (1926), which has the mys- 
terious density of ancient statuary. 
Mahmoud Mokhtar is a perfect example of cre- 
ative fertility shaped by training in Western tech- 
niques and used to serve an inspiration that was 
authentically Egyptian. [|

### 94912: A Voyage through European literature

A voyage through 
European 
literature 
by Edgar Reichmann 
illustrated Histoire de la littérature 
européenne (“History of European 
Literature”) is an event that marks the con- 
clusion of an ambitious enterprise. The 
editors and contributors faced a threefold 
challenge—to avoid becoming the pris- 
oners of a reductive Eurocentrism and 
neglecting to take account of what Europe 
has inherited from other parts of the world; 
to prevent their work from becoming a 
vast catalogue in which European litera- 
ture is compartmentalized into linguistic 
and national traditions; and to identify, 
on the threshold of the third millennium, 
and after the failure of the great ideolo- 
gies that have marked our century, any 
new trends that may be developing to fill 
the void these ideologies have left behind. 
T HE recent publication of a 1,025-page 
A MANY-FACETEDP LITERATURE 
The History is the work of a team of 150 
university teachers from all over Europe. It 
shows that, while Europe has many dif- 
ferent literary traditions, there is never- 
theless a single European literature. The 
editors, literary historians Annick Benoit- 
Dusausoy and Guy Fontaine, describe the 
contacts between Europe and the rest of 
the world that encouraged the circulation 
of people and ideas and the movements of 
peoples over the centuries. They rightly 
remind us that Asia and the Mediterranean 
coast of Africa, the cradles of our civiliza- 
tion, have, together with the early Greek 
myths, left an indelible imprint on Euro- 
pean literature past and present. 
Via Spain, Arab poets influenced the 
troubadours of Provence, while Asia 
bequeathed to Europe a spirit of oriental 
refinement. In the inter-war years Africa 
south of the Sahara contributed to the dis- 
covery by European avant-gardes of anew 
view of reality. India and China, the Malay 
archipelago and Oceania, mysterious 
islands and deserts of fire and ice, all exer- 
cised their fascination on writers as varied 
as Kipling, Rimbaud, Malraux, Daniel 
Defoe, Jules Verne and the Polish-born 
English novelist Joseph Conrad. More 
recently such important figures as the

BOOKS OF THE WORLD 
daunting task of relating important Euro- 
pean authors to other cultures, in some 
cases geographically and chronologically 
remote. 
While Swift, Rabelais, Moliére, Racine, 
Cervantes, Chekhov, Proust and Kafka are 
known all over the world, authors writing 
in less widely-used languages are much 
less familiar. It is true that good transla- 
tions of the Albanian Ismail Kadaré, the 
Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa and the 
Czech novelist Milan Kundera have made 
these authors well-known, and the essayist 
E.M. Cioran and the dramatist Eugéne 
Ionesco, Romanians who have long written 
in French, are equally celebrated. But the 
fine Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, the 
Polish ‘novelist Tadeusz Konwicki, who 
draws his inspiration from his Lithuanian 
ancestors, or the late Danilo Kis, a Mon- 
tenegrin Jew who wrote in Serbian and 
described metaphorically the similarity 
of all forms of totalitarianism, are little- 
read by speakers of the world’s main lan- 
guages. The extraordinary diversity of 
these literatures still remains largely unrec- 
ognized, as are their points of convergence 
amid the infinite reflections of a unique, 
multi-faceted reality. The authors of this 
splendid work have brilliantly recon- 
structed the harmonious links between 
different literatures as revealed in unex- 
pected and hidden convergences. 
Co 
UNVEILING NEW TRENDS 
What of the future of European literature? 
The debate about post-modernism 
opened in France by Jean-Francois 
Lyotard’s work La Condition post-mod- 
erne (“The Post-Modern Condition”, 1979) 
is still continuing in the universities. But 
the avant-garde and the nouveau roman 
have run out of steam, socialist realism is 
long dead, and those works that expressed 
opposition to dictatorial regimes have lost 
their raison d’étre with the collapse of the 
dictatorships, which has also put paid to 
the old “official” literatures. Meanwhile, 
the freedom suddenly accorded authors of 
the former Eastern bloc to write what they 
want has left them shell-shocked. 
In the West narrative seems to be 
coming back into vogue, and with it a 
renewal of the attractions of classic story- 
telling, blending realism, magical realism, 
folk-tale and myth. Historical novels and 
works that dramatize real-life events are 
both making something of a comeback. 
Meanwhile, poetry refuses to fit into any 
fixed category and goes its own way. Poets 
cannot breathe when confronted by 
tyrants’ rules and regulations; they can 
only flourish when they can get to grips 
with words in an atmosphere of creative 
freedom. However, it remains to be seen 
which of today’s movements and trends 
posterity will remember. |]

Ethnomusicologist Hugo 
Zemp is a specialist in 
yodelling and also, oddly 
enough, in the music of the 
Solomon Islands. On this 
compact disc he presents some 
surprising examples of zduerli 
yodelling from the Swiss 
canton of Appenzell, 
performed not as folklore but 
in a workaday context by 
mountain people while milking 
cows or leading them to 
pasture. These polyphonic 
yodels have little in common 
with the usual tourist fare. The 
sometimes untempered 
singing, with notes often 
reached by glissandi, in some 
ways recalls Mongol music, 
  
and the cowbells in the 
background contribute to the 
oriental effect, like gongs ina 
Chinese or Korean opera. 
GUINEA. 
The Nyamakalas from Futa 
Jalon 
Music from the World 
CD Buda 92530-2 
Once considered as 
miscreants by the fervent Peul 
  
Muslims of Futa Jalon because 
of their love of dance, music 
and song, the Nyamakalas have 
inherited a long musical 
tradition. The group on this 
record, however, was formed 
relatively recently, following 
the establishment of the 
Second Republic of Guinea. 
The singers are accompanied 
by various stringed 
instruments including the

consisting of a large hollow 
calabash with a neck attached;

than bowed; the kérdna, a 
small four-stringed guitar 
rather like the Wolof khalam, 
* and various flutes, drums and 
castanettes. The group 
performs delightful, lively 
melodies and songs full of 
aphorisms, such as “When the 
left hand sins, the right hand is 
not guilty” and “Life is all 
change, you win it little by 
little”. 
JAPAN, 
The Spirit of Silence 
Yoshikazu Iwamoto 
(shakuhachi flute) 
Music from the World 
CD Buda 92543-2 
The shakuhachi, a bamboo 
flute, is linked to Zen and to the 
Japanese aesthetic of silence, 
the void, the concealed, the 
unadorned. It has a limited 
range and a misty sound, and 
its music, in which the spaces 
between notes are as important 
as the notes themselves, brings 
to mind the dreamlike 
atmosphere of Japanese films 
such as Kwaidan and Onibaba 
and certain works by 
Mizoguchi and Kurosawa. 
Iwamoto, a virtuoso of the 
instrument, modulates the 
different tonal elements with 
great refinement, and does full 
justice to the poetry of the titles 
of the pieces he plays on this 
CD: “Moon of the Heart”, 
“Deep Night”, “Wind through 
Pine Trees”.

Andy Gonzalez (bass), Adam

CD Antilles 314512 768-2 
Latin Jazz has been 
bubbling in New York for the 
last ten years, and this new disc 
by the young, Bronx-born, 
Puerto-Rican trumpeter 
Charlie Sepulveda shows how 
mature the music has now 
become. Algo Nuestrois a 
marvel. It introduces two 
musicians surely soon to be 
stars on the international stage: 
Ed Simon, a Venezuelan pianist 
still not as well known as he 
deserves to be despite having 
played at various European 
festivals, and David Sanchez, 
who combines an expressive 
saxophone style with a strong 
and subtle sense of rhythm. 
Guest musicians also lend a 
hand on some tracks. 
Sepulveda and his companions 
constantly spring surprises on 
the listener, swinging on the 
upbeat numbers, playing the 
ballads poetically, and 
sounding almost bucolic on 
other tracks with a Puerto 
Rican flavour. This is a group to 
watch. 
AHMAD JAMAL. 
Live in Paris 92 
Jamal (piano), James 
Cammack (bass), David 
Bowler (drums). 
CD Birdology 849 408-2 
This record is another 
triumph for Jamal. The old 
master of harmony, who often 
starts his numbers with 
seemingly interminable solo 
preludes in which he lets his 
imagination run free, toys with 
the piano with disconcerting 
ease. His music is full of superb 
chord progressions, dizzying 
runs that never seem out of 
  
place, abrupt rhythmic breaks 
and an astonishing sense of 
phrasing. Jamal is one of those 
great jazz stylists who impress 
their personality on everything 
they play, and who can 
restructure and rework 
material apparently endlessly. 
FRANK FOSTER AND 
THE LOUD MINORITY. 
Shiny Stockings 
CD Denon DC-8545 
This disc contains a series 
of Foster compositions (the 
exception being the beautiful, 
traditional “Hills of the North 
Rejoice”) that were recorded by 
the saxophonist in 1977 and 
1978 with some of the most 
reliable and innovative— 
though not necessarily the 
best-known—New York jazz 
musicians of the era. They 
include the saxophonist Bill 
Cody, who was tragically to be 
killed by white racists, the 
trumpeter Virgil Jones, the 
drummer Charlie Persip, the 
pianist Mickey Tucker and the 
guitarist Ted Dunbar. Among 
the vibrant, well-orchestrated 
tracks is an inventive version of 
“Shiny Stockings”, named in 
honour of the legwear of 
Frank's wife Cecilia. Currently 
the director of the Count Basie 
orchestra, Foster is an 
outstanding instrumentalist 
and, with Quincy Jones and 
Slide Hampton, one of the best 
arrangers in contemporary 
jazz. 
CLASSICAL 
BEETHOVEN. 
Missa Solemnis 
Arnold Schoenberg Chor. 
The Chamber Orchestra of 
Europe, conducted by 
Nikolaus Harnoncourt 
CD Teldec 9031-74884-2 
“The entire Mass is an 
appeal for peace,” claims 
conductor Nikolaus 
Harnoncourt. The Missa 
Solemnis powerfully evokes the 
horrors of war through cries, 
anguished recitatives, clashing 
cymbals, trumpet calls and one 
passage on the strings that 
Harnoncourt aptly describes as 
“gooseflesh set to music”. Itis a 
big, majestic, lyrical work, 
occasionally riven by what the 
conductor calls “absolutely 
stark passages”, and the 
musicians, soloists and chorus 
on this recording perfectly 
capture its sombre and moving 
tone. 
HENRYK GORECKI. 
Symphony No.3, “Symphony 
of Sorrowful Songs” 
London Sinfonietta, 
conducted by David Zinman, 
with Dawn Upshaw 
(soprano) 
CD Elektra Nonesuch 7559- 
79282-2 
Composed in Katowice 
(Poland) in 1976, this religious 
symphony is elegiac in tone, 
unfurling its great waves of 
sound at a captivating and 
almost imperceptibly slow 
pace. The first movement 
incorporates a fifteenth- 
century Polish prayer, the 
“Lamentation of the Holy Cross 
Monastery”. The sweep of the 
work gradually carries the 
listener away amid a rising 
musical tension that 
culminates in the lento— 
cantabile-semplice of the third 
movement. This is a beautiful 
work, more directly accessible 
than Goérecki’s earlier 
compositions. [|

CHILDREN 
OF THE WORLD UNITE 
Last year, world leaders met in Rio de Janeiro 
to discuss global issues concerning pollu- 
tion, to no avail. We face two choices: either 
to carry on regardless, or to try to find a solu- 
tion to the problem of pollution. Do we want 
destruction or the continuity oflife on Earth? 
Above all, we must not forget the children 
who live on our planet, for surely they 
embody the balance needed for Earth's sur- . 
vival. Children are prisoners of world deci- 
sions out of their control. Itis high time that 
we listened to their views concerning the 
survival of Mother Earth. They hold the key 
to the future.

A TIME TO CARE 
For the impressive panel of intellectuals who 
contributed to your April issue (“A Time to Love 
..."), the sole interpretation given to the much- 
misused word “love” was that of (hetero)sexual 
love, romantic love if you prefer, confusing 
“loving” (durable) and “being in love” (all too 
often transient). Not one of your authors used 
the word in what seems to me its essential 
sense, that of caring. This led to the absurd sit- 
uation in which half a page of the magazine 
was devoted to Don Juan, whereas Mather 
Teresa did not get a mention. Nor was parental 
love given the pride of place it should have 
had, or the love of ordinary folk for their friends, 
or the unquestioning trust of children, or the 
touching bond that sometimes develops 
between a human being and an animal. Yet it is 
that kind of quiet affection that “makes the 
world go round”, not the glamorous Hollywood 
stuff.

TO THE EDITOR 
above all, amid so many uncertainties, to have 
a sound definition of Love. The posters of stars 
like Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Ava 
Gardner on my bedroom wall are images of 
Fullness and Emptiness—the fullness written 
in the faces, the emptiness of what one expects 
to receive from them. At our age we still attach 
faces to our adolescent illusions; at forty it is too 
late. For already the realization is dawning that 
life is not eternal and that all these faces are 
interchangeable. 
This evening I have realized that inter- 
changeability is inevitable if one loves Love 
and not “being in love”. I shall continue to 
scatter myself to the winds, but I shall kriow that 
it will be for the sake of an absolute, Love with 
a capital L.

WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
TO DUTY? 
I note that one feature of the world in which we 
live is the growing number of rights—the rights 
of the child, minority rights, the right to work, 
to health, to freedom of speech, etc. But what 
about those who are not covered by any of 
these headings? Why such a diversity of rights, 
such a profusion of categories? Are there so 
many gaps in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights? Are its provisions unsatisfac- 
torily applied? 
What about duty, the opposite pole to 
rights, and one from which they are in a sense 
indissociable? No-one talks about duty any 
more. The very word is no longer part of our 
vocabulary. Why is this? Is it because we now 
only possess rights and not duties? What can 
happen to a society that insists only on rights? 
What is life without a sense of duty? 
Why not devote an issue of the UNEsco 
Courierto the notion of duty as it has appeared 
indifferent peoples and civilizations down the 
ages—spiritual, religious, moral, and civic duty, 
duty to oneself and to others, individual, col- 
lective and professional duties? Is this concept 
specific to human beings and if so what hap- 
pens when it is neglected?
