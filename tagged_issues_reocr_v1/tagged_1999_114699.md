### 114700: Shanghai reborn

Shanghai was once a colonial gateway into China, 
then went into eclipse. Today it is a vast building 
site bidding to rise as high as New York 
Chen Danyan* 
its first explosive boom.That occurred some 80 years ago. Shanghai used to be 
a small fishing port carved into British, French,American and Japanese 
spheres of influence. While it was carved up, Shanghai grew into the largest 
metropolis in Asia. In the seventies, Shanghai lost its lustre. When night fell, the city 
was dark as the corridors and toilets in many homes which were dimly lit by the 
30-watt energy-saving bulbs then popular across the city. The river banks were 
dotted with courting couples who had no rooms of their own and no cafés or parks 
to go to. The riverside became the only place where they could meet. 
Today Shanghai, like a “prodigal son”, is working frantically to make up for 
whatever time it has wasted, harbouring an ambition to overtake Hong Kong in its 
development and to emulate New York or other big cities of the world. 
In the old parts of the city, houses can be seen on all sides with the same big 
sign: “To be demolished”. Whole neighbourhoods have been pulled down, and 
where a wall still remains one can tell by the blotches and stains on it that here 
stood a dining table and there a low bed in which someone must have sat reading » 
B In the nineties, Shanghai has exploded like a Chinese firecracker. Yet this is not

with his greasy head against the wall. Old buildings of the colonial period are 
being levelled one after another at night by blasting, to be replaced by skyscrapers 
with glass outer walls. In the downtown area, an overhead highway and a subway 
are being built simultaneously, and the whole city resounds at night with thudding 
piledrivers at work. If the weather happens to be dry for a couple of days, the trees 
along the streets will be covered with dust. Some say Shanghai is simply a giant 
construction site; others say it looks as if it had just survived an indiscriminate 
bombing. People who have been away from a particular area for a few months are 
apt to lose their way when they come back, and this has been an experience shared 
by many old dwellers of the city. People tend to complain about taxi drivers 
making detours to cheat their customers without realizing that they too are 
constantly trying to find their way. The city map of Shanghai has to be updated 
every three months. 
Huge German supermarkets have started to trade in Shanghai. So have big 
Japanese department stores, luxury shops from New York’s Fifth Avenue and 
Haagen Dazs ice-cream parlours. Many other commodities have found their way to 
Shanghai as well, such as Shell petrol, French perfume, Swiss chocolate and Philips 
electrical appliances. There are also Irish pubs, Kobe style cafés, Bordeaux wine 
shops, hard rock bars and even Tex-Mex restaurants, now very much in vogue in 
Europe. After long years of impoverishment, people in Shanghai, infused with an 
urge for material possession, are now rushing in all directions into shops, real estate 
agencies, banks and all other places where money can be made and spent. 
In the streets, pedestrians vie for passage with motor vehicles: shoddy taxis 
converted from 125cc Happiness brand motorcycles, air-conditioned coaches, 
swarms of motorized pedicabs ferrying first-grade pupils and trailing black smoke 
behind them, shaky push carts full of construction debris, and imported Cadillacs 
belonging to foreign businessmen. In the narrow streets built in the twenties, people 
and cars go busily on their way. This is Shanghai today. [|

### 114700: Shanghai reborn

A Twilight in the old city. 
   PEOPLE AND PLACES 
An economic powerhouse 
anghai is the beacon of the liberalized 
So economy and the symbol of its 
opening up to the world of international 
business. Reform has been speedier and more 
radical there than anywhere else in China, and 
more foreign capital and state-of-the-art 
technology is pouring into Shanghai than into 
any other Chinese city. 
Situated at the mouth of the Yangtze river, 
Shanghai is China’s most populous conurbation, 
with 13 million inhabitants It comprises the city 
itself (375 sg. km.) and a dozen satellite towns in 
a quadrilateral measuring 120 km (north-south) 
by 100 km (east-west). 
At the start of the 19th century, it already 
had half a million inhabitants. It then became the 
main port of entry for colonial powers seeking to 
penetrate the Chinese Empire. To some extent it 
became a backwater after the communists took 
8 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
power in 1949 and did not start prospering again 
until it was declared a “ special economic zone” 
in the early 1990s 
The city’s economy is run by a local council 
which reports directly to the central government. 
It grew by 14 per cent a year between 1992 and 
1996, easing off to 12.7 per cent in 1997. Foreign 
direct investment was running at around $10 
billion a year during the same period. The average 
wage has tripled since 1990 and annual per 
capita income is now over $3,000, compared with 
only $860 for the rest of China (1997). 
The city's pride is its heavy industry 
(steelworks, electric power stations, refineries and 
shipyards), machine-tool factories, computer 
plants, textile mills, port activity and especially 
finance— the Shanghai stock exchange, Pudong, 
is China's equivalent of Wall Street. 
But the effects of the Asian economic crisis 
 
  
     
are beginning to be felt. Annual growth has 
dropped below 10 per cent and foreign direct 
investment fell by almost half in 1997. 
Restructuring of state-owned firms, in the form of 
mergers or shutdowns, has pushed up 
unemployment, which is officially between 7 and 
8 per cent but is thought to be double that. Air 
and water pollution and poor waste disposal are 
also causing concern. [|

We must say all together: 
enough is enough! Let us

turbulent history of the 
twentieth century. Through 
non-violent rebellion, 
creative resistance and 
refusal to accept the 
unacceptable, let us take 
steps to ease the transition 
to dialogue, tolerance and 
reasoned consideration of 
that which divides us, and

The International Year for the Culture of Peace 
proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United 
Nations will begin at the end of this year. Now is 
the time to start preparing to take part 
In twelve months we enter the year 2000:what better time to chart a new course,by 
working together every day to make possible a new society of peace,a society based 
  
upon the democratic ideals enshrined in UNESco’s Constitution: liberty, justice, 
equality and solidarity? 
There can be no lasting peace without sustainable development. There can be no 
development without lifelong education, without democracy, the sharing of resources to 
avoid the immense disparities separating the developed from the less developed countries. 
Within every country, some citizens want for nothing, while others lack almost everything. 
The century that is drawing to a close has seen great discoveries and inventions, of 
which antibiotics and telecommunications are but two, but the logic of force has prevailed 
at a terrible cost—the lives of millions of human beings, many of them in the flower of their 
youth.Nothing of value has ever been achieved by violence and coercion. 
We cannot continue to be indifferent to the wasting of our resources in the production 
of weapons to be used against enemies, whether actual or potential. We cannot tolerate the 
fact that, for economic reasons, thousands of helpless children are victims of sexual abuse 
or exploitation at work. We cannot continue to allow water to be polluted, forests to be 
destroyed,the air of our planet to be contaminated. We cannot accept the predominance 
of one culture over all others; nor can we afford to lose the diversity of the physical and 
spiritual heritage that we must pass on to future generations. 
We must say all together: enough is enough! Let us draw new hope from the turbulent 
history of the twentieth century. Through non-violent rebellion, creative resistance and 
refusal to accept the unacceptable, let us take steps to ease the transition to dialogue, 
tolerance and reasoned consideration of that which divides us, and invent imaginative 
solutions. 
The Nobel Peace laureates,with UNEscoO and the United Nations,have launched an 
international appeal to transform the culture of war and violence into a culture of peace 
and reconciliation. T his initiative demands the participation of everyone, within families, 
communities, nations and regions, and offers values that can inspire young people and 
future generations to shape a world of justice,solidarity, liberty and prosperity. 
Let us all, children, young people, women and men of all ages, unite around this 
manifesto and create a global movement for a culture of peace and non-violence. Let us 
make our voices heard by decision-makers,parliamentarians,mayors. Let us make fulluse 
of the media to arouse the conscience and commitment of the world, working, giving, 
sharing, reducing the distances that have divided us,healing the wounds that have given 
us pain. 
Let us dare to take up the challenge and fashion together this new future, and start right 
away to prepare for the year 2000,the International Year for the Culture of Peace. [|

PLANET 
  
The earth’s thin coat of soil, which 
helps to feed us and is vital for 
planetary ecosystems and climatic 
balance, is becoming increasingly 
threadbare 
don’t eat soil. It feeds us only 
indirectly,” says Austrian pedologist 
(soil expert) Winfried Blum, secretary- 
general of the International Union of Soil 
Science (IUSS). Soils, he says, are the 
forgotten part of the environment. Like 
most of his colleagues, he thinks it’s high 
time the situation changed. “We have to 
make people realize we're destroying the 
basis of all our lives,” he says. 
There are no regularly updated 
statistics, and the rate and extent at which 
soils are deteriorating are a matter of 
debate. The French Scientific Research 
Institute for Development in Co-operation 
(ORSTOM) notes that estimates in any 
one region can vary as much as 100 per 
cent. 
“We drink water, we breathe air, but we 
Damaging 
human activity 
In Africa, soil deterioration statistics are 
particularly exaggerated because they are 
linked to desertification. But in countries 
south of the Sahara, the soil is not 
necessarily degraded. Desertification may 
be the result of a series of years of drought, 
says Alain Ruellan, former president of the 
IUSS. “Sometimes all it needs is some rain 
and some farmers to bring it back to life.” 
But scientists are virtually unanimous 
about one thing: human activity is 
increasingly damaging soils all over the 
world. Soils constitute a fragile living 
environment which teems with biological 
and physiochemical processes. They 
become degraded when erosion carries 
them towards rivers and the sea faster than 
they can regenerate themselves naturally. 
Soils also become exhausted when they 
cannot renew themselves, either naturally 
or as a result of external inputs such as 
manure. 
Soil erosion worldwide affects an area 
the size of the United Kingdom—more 
1 0 The Unesco Courier - anuary 1999 
than 200,000 sq. km., says Blum. “But 
erosion 1s not the main problem,” says 
Ruellan, who stresses the importance of 
compaction, which modifies soils’ 
biological activity and the circulation of 
water. Data gathered by the Netherlands- 
based International Soil Reference and 
Information Centre (ISRIC) are 
disturbing. The Centre says erosion now 
affects more than 20 million sq. km. 
According to the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), at least 12 million of 
them (an area bigger than China) have been 
damaged by human activity in the past half 
century. Overgrazing by animals is 
reckoned to have damaged 6.8 million sq. 
km. (including 2.4 million in Africa and 2 
million in Asia) and deforestation almost 6 
million sq.km. 
Overgrazing and deforestation 
impoverish the soil by destroying barriers to 
erosion and depriving it of the organic 
matter which it normally gets through 
vegetation cover. In addition, poor farming 
methods have damaged 5.5 million sq. km. 
and collecting firewood 1.4 million. 
Expanding cities and industries have 
degraded several hundred thousand sq. km. 
of good soil. In the United States, 30,000 
sq. km. of farmland were lost to 
urbanization, road construction and mining 
between 1967 and 1975. 
Water and 
wind erosion 
Things seem likely to get worse. FAO 
estimates that at the present rate of decay, 
2.5 million sq. km. of farmland could 
become barren by the year 2050. ISRIC 
says water erosion is by far the most 
common cause of soil degradation, 
affecting about 11 million sq. km. After that 
comes wind erosion (5.5 million sq. km.) 
and the action of chemical products (2.4 
million sq. km). Only 220,000 sq. km. of 
soil are thought to be damaged by

pollution, almost 90 per cent of it in 
Europe. 
In the last few decades, developing 
countries have followed the industrialized 
world by adopting more intensive farming 
methods. Brazil is a good example. Soil 
degradation began there four centuries ago, 
when Europeans arrived and deforestation 
began, says soil scientist José Pereira de 
Quieroz Neto. It gathered speed in the 19th 
century as coffee and sugar plantations 
spread, and since the 1970s the growth of 
export agro-industry has ravaged the 
environment. In just five years, between 
1975 and 1980, Brazil rose to be the world’s 
third biggest producer of soybeans after the 
United States and China. It also became 
one of the countries with the highest 
amounts of agro-toxins per hectare going 
into the soil.

### 114702: Soils in torment

What is soil? 
Soil is the skin that coats the earth’s 
surface. It may be only a few millimetres 
thick or several dozen metres. It covers two- 
thirds of the total land area but only 22 per 
cent of this (or 5.5 per cent of the earth’s total 
surface) is suitable for farming. 
Soil is formed from rocks which are 
broken down by the combined action of 
water, air, and animal and plant life. 
“In the beginning,” says French naturalist 
Yves Coineau, “there was just rock. Then 
lichens attached themselves to it, animals 
came and ate the lichens and dust 
accumulated. Then grass appeared and 
attacked part of the rock’s surface with its 
roots. The plant created organic matter, 
which then decomposed and mixed in with 
PLANET 
the debris from the rock. Gradually, very 
slowly, a small layer of earth formed.” 
A centimetre of earth may take between 
50 and 2,000 years to form, depending on 
the location. In other words it isnot a rapidly 
renewable resource. 
Soil is the least understood of the earth’s 
major environments. “99 per cent of people, 
whether they're teachers or decision-makers, 
can’t tell you what soil is,” says Alain Ruellan, 
former president of the International Union 
of Soil Science (IUSS). It is hard to see soil. 
You have to make an effort to look at it, by 
bending down or digging holes. Above all,

confusion and increased soil erosion four or 
fivefold. Today, between 200 and 250

Up to now, soils have been mainly 
regarded, quite wrongly, as a basis for other

France’s National Centre for Agronomic

is a limited resource. “It’s a resource that 
must be protected and managed, like water, 
forests and the air. Its role in the

highly.” And that role is not a small one. 
The earth’s surface is an enormous and 
fragile biological reactor which provides 
food for plants. It is also the home of most 
land animal species and ensures the quality 
of water, which is filtered as it passes 
through it.And it helps to create an overall 
climatic equilibrium.

Ozone hole 
reaches 
record size 
n 1998, the hole which forms each year in the 
Antarctic ozone layer during the southern 
hemisphere’s springtime reached an all-time 
record size for the second half of September. 
Satellite pictures taken by the US National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
showed that its area was 25 million sq. km.— 
about two and a half times the area of Europe 
(from the Atlantic to the Urals). The last biggest 
hole recorded in September was 22 million sg. km. 
in 1993. 
The ozone layer in the stratosphere protects 
humans, other living creatures and the world’s 
ecosystems from the sun’s ultra-violet radiation. 
The hole, which in September 1998 extended as 
far as the southern tip of Argentina and Chile, 
exposes people to greater risk of sunburn,skin 
cancer and cataracts. 
The situation would have been even more 
serious if 165 countries had not pledged at a 
conference in Montreal in 1987 to gradually stop 
producing and using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
These chemical compounds, which are used as 
refrigerants and aerosol propellants, are 
destroying the ozone layer and causing holes at 
the South Pole and (to a lesser extent) at the 
North Pole. The Montreal Protocol came into 
effect in 1995 for industrialized countries. Other 
nations must get in line with it by the year 2005 
but have been asked to do so earlier if possible. 
It will take at least 60 years for CFCs to disappear 
completely from the stratosphere. 
Some experts say the recent widening of the 
hole above the Antarctic may be due to the 
exceptional cold— up to minus 90° C—in the 
stratosphere during the southern hemisphere’s 
winter. The very low temperatures help form 
polar clouds which also destroy the ozone layer. 
Three researchers at the US National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s 
Goddard Institute for Space Studies say the 
unusual cold is partly due to the emission of 
greenhouse gases. These warm the lower 
reaches of the atmosphere, they say, but cool the 
stratosphere, which is between 12 and 27 km. 
above the earth. 
The 150 or so balloons which will be launched 
into the stratosphere above the Antarctic starting 
in October 2000 as part of the international 
Stratéole programme should provide more 
information about the factors involved in the 
hole’s highly complicated chemistry. |

greenhouse gases,” says Blum. Soil gives 
off large amounts of carbon dioxide. When 
human activity causes erosion or soil loss, 
the soil is no longer deep or rich enough to 
store carbon, and carbon dioxide is either 
released into the atmosphere or carried 
directly to the sea. Soil is also responsible 
for a third of all methane emissions, 
especially in rice-growing areas in the 
tropics. In addition, it produces 70 per cent 
of nitrous oxide emissions in intensively- 
farmed regions where large quantities of 
nitrous fertilizers are used. 
Soils are also a fabulous reservoir of 
greenhouse gases. They contain two and a 
half times more carbon, in organic matter 
(humus and biomass), than all the 
vegetation on the planet, says Blum. The 
amount of carbon in the soil varies widely.

The squeeze on good earth 
Is soil degradation a threat to our food 
I supply? At first glance, it doesn’t seem 
so: only half the world’s arable land is being 
farmed. But this can give a false sense of 
security. There’s no point in having good 
soils if you can’t use them, and rich soil is 
often in places where there is no water and 
where there are no people to farm it. 
In the Middle East and in south and 
east Asia, where population pressures are 
strong, there is no virgin land left to farm, 
so the danger of soil degradation is 
growing. In the Amazon,in Siberia and in 
some parts of Africa, such as Zaire, there is 
a lot of virgin land but hardly anyone to 
farm it. 
To bridge this gap between supply and 
demand, some countries have tried to 
resettle people, but such efforts have 
usually been spectacular failures. “Farmers 
have ended up begging in city streets,” says 
Algerian soil scientist Rabah Lahmar. In 
his recent book, Des sols et des hommes (“Soil 
and People”), he describes a disastrous 
experiment in Indonesia, where the 
government sent people from Java to 
Borneo to clear the land and start up farms. 
What can be done about fertile land 
where there is no water? The problem is a 
serious one:the world’s irrigated areas are 
only increasing by 1 per cent each year. In 
the 1960s and 1970s, they were growing by 
10 per cent a year. 
The cocktail of population growth and soil 
degradation could become explosive and lead 
to countless conflicts over good land. The 
demand for food is going to grow, while 
availability of farmland per capita in poor 
countries is expected to halve by the year 
2010, according to FAO—{rom 0.85 hectares 
per person to 0.4. [|

much less of it than forest soil (2-8 per cent 
organic matter) or peat bog, which is up to 
90 per cent organic matter. 
The still-unanswered question is 
whether soils absorb more greenhouse gas 
than they produce. In other words, can they 
fix and store the amount of excess carbon 
dioxide which is produced by human 
activity and is causing global warming? “It 
depends a lot on local conditions,” says 
Blum. “The best soils for this are deep ones 
beneath forests in temperate parts of 
Europe and in some tropical regions.” 
Stocks of carbon can also be renewed by 
massive reforestation, with priority going 
to regions which have been damaged and 
made unfit for agriculture. 
The effect of global warming on soils is 
also very hard to figure out. The Sahara 
Desert is undoubtedly going to spread, 
scientists say. But at the same time, huge 
land areas near the poles will thaw as ice 
melts. In a few decades time, we might be 
able to grow wheat in northern Canada and 
Siberia. [|

“Considering the centuries or

it is important not to allow valuable time

paramount importance to expand the 
Convention on Desertification into a

So the scientists got down to work. A 
preliminary text was published in July 1998 
by the founders of the Tutzing “Time 
Ecology”project, based at the Evangelical 
Academy inTutzing, a southern suburb of 
Munich (Germany). The idea had been in 
the air since the Rio conference, says 
Martin Held, leader of the 
multidisciplinary project. “Then leading 
environmental experts like David Pimentel 
of Cornell University (New York state) and 
Hartmut Grassl, head of the World Climate 
Research Programme, asked us to draft the 
text of a convention,” he says. 
At a meeting held in Tutzing from 22- 
25 November 1998, the IUSS was 
mandated to conduct extensive 
international consultations about the text, 
especially among all those who use the soil, 
such as farmers, urban planners and 
NGOs. So the process towards final United 
Nations adoption of a convention has only 
just begun.If it lasts as long as that leading

Industry asked to 
clean up 
its act 
I’ 1998, Environics International, a private 
institute in Toronto (Canada), co-ordinated 
for the second year running a worldwide survey 
examining attitudes towards environmental 
issues. The latest poll focused on the average 
citizen's expectations in regard to corporate 
and government commitment to protecting the 
environment.During the first quarter of 1998, 
34,475 people were surveyed in 30 countries’ on 
five continents representing 68 per cent of the 
world’s population. In 19 of the 30 countries 
concerned, most people polled considered that 
business and industry do not make a big effort 
to ensure a clean environment. The highest 
rates of those who believe companies are not 
doing enough to curb pollution are from Greece 
(88 per cent of those polled), Argentina (76 per 
cent), Turkey (73 per cent) and Russia (72 per 
cent). The lowest rates are in Germany and 
Indonesia (39 per cent), China (36 per cent) 
and South Africa (35 per cent). 
People want governments to do more 
about the situation.In all the countries except 
Finland, Nigeria and Indonesia, over 50 per 
cent of those polled said they believe that 
existing regulations do not go far enough or 
are extremely inadequate. 
Should other alternatives be tried to 
compel companies and industries to pollute 
less or not at all? The idea of increasing 
financial incentives for “clean” companies or 
granting them tax breaks is considered a 
good one in the United States, Canada, 
Germany and France. The Japanese, 
Colombians and Finns prefer publishing 
pollution statistics to embarrass offending 
companies into cleaning up their acts. The 
1997 survey revealed that,in the 24 countries 
where the poll was taken, sensitiveness to 
environmental issues ran very high— 70 to 90 
per cent of those polled said they were very or 
fairly concerned, including in developing 
nations. |

In a world of cut-throat competition, Denmark is a European 
leader in worker training and education. The LEGO group offers 
its employees courses that are not directly related to their jobs 
in a bid to educate ‘the whole person’ 
industries in other European 
countries when it comes to training 
and upgrading the skills of employees,” says 
Christian Braad, a consultant at the 
Educational Department of the 
Confederation of Danish Industries. 
In a labour force survey carried out in 
1996 by Eurostat, the European Union 
Statistics Office, more than 8 million 
Europeans over 30 years of age were asked 
whether they had received any kind of 
teaching or training in the four weeks 
preceding the interview. Denmark came 
out on top with around 12 per cent of 
respondees answering “yes”, more than 
three times the EU average. 
“And we are not resting on our laurels,” 
Braad continues. “Education is increasingly 
becoming a focus area for both small and 
large companies. Whereas opportunities for 
education once went mainly to employees 
in high positions and skilled workers, there 
is now a marked trend for unskilled workers 
to be offered—or even required to attend— 
various kinds of educational courses. With 
increasing globalization companies have to 
be flexible,and so does the workforce.” 
Braad adds that the flexible and 
independent, but government-subsidized,

elsewhere in Europe. 
special needs of individual companies,” 
Braad says, “and at the same time offer 
general training and education which isnot 
job- or company-specific. In the short term 
companies may complain that their 
employees are taught things that they 
cannot directly use in their present job. On 
the other hand it increases the mobility of 
the workforce, and this is important for 
Danish industries in general.” 
Two reasons are cited to explain why 
Education is a priority for small and 
large businessses— and their workforce— as they adapt to 
globalization 
Danish system of skills training centres is an 
indispensable tool to achieve this. T he system 
was introduced in the 1960s to offer short 
courses for workers as a response to 
increasing use of technology and demand for 
qualified labour. Later, other kinds of adult 
education were available, focusing more on 
“soft” issues not directly related to specific 
job skills. 
“The system can accommodate the 
1 4 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
“soft” courses which seek to educate “the 
whole person” are increasingly used by big 
Danish companies and why employees are 
encouraged to take them. One is the need 
for a more widely educated workforce as a 
result of the general trend to delegate powers 
to floor level—to replace foremen with self- 
governing groups. The other is an increased 
focus on quality control as the responsibility 
of each individual rather than of outside 
controllers. 
Right from the start the Danish 
government subsidized workers attending 
training courses. Today it pays around 70 
per cent of an employee’s salary while he or 
she is on a course; the employer pays the 
rest. In some cases the government even 
refunds the topping up of the salary. 
Education 
for unskilled workers 
Most Danish companies make use of the 
system, but some big companies have taken 
the lead in developing new kinds of courses. 
One of them is the LEGO group, a toy- 
manufacturing firm which employs close on 
10,000 people worldwide.The success of 
LEGO, a term formed from the Danish 
words “Leg Godt” (“play well”), has been 
largely built on 8-studded plastic bricks,each 
measuring just under 5 cm’, which can be 
pressed together and assembled into a wide 
range of toy constructions. Some 189 billion 
of them were moulded between 1949 and 
the end of 1997. The company has a 
workforce of 4,300 at the bustling town of 
Billund, where LEGO was founded in 1932.

educational department and increasingly 
focused on unskilled workers and soft 
courses on such subjects as “Preparing 
yourself for education”,“Improving basic 
reading and writing skills”, English, 
information technology, management and 
team building. LEGO employees are 
encouraged to take courses both during 
work-time and during their time off, that 
do not necessarily have any relevance to 
their jobs. Around 1,500 people have taken 
part in the courses since 1995. Although 
there are no statistics to prove it, LEGO 
feels sure that the courses have a positive 
impact on job satisfaction and productivity. 
“In a fast changing world what you did 
yesterday will not suffice tomorrow,” says 
Kurt Aulbjerg, head of LEGO’s human 
resource development department. 
“Traditional skills-upgrading courses are 
not sufficient. Our approach to education 
has to be much more broadminded.” 
In other words, the LEGO group 
cannot afford only to make use of the hands 
of its employees. The company wants the 
whole person.

shop steward for 150 metal workers, went

focuses on your personality rather than your 
professional skills is quite another story. All 
of a sudden you are being questioned about 
what you do when you are off the job. Do 
you have skills, experiences or talents that 
can make you perform better at work?’ 
Petersen cites the case of a young 
secretary who had to get a signature from 
her superior for every piece of expenditure 
she endorsed from her department, no 
matter how small. “During a course she 
mentioned that she was the treasurer of a 
big sports association and responsible for 
an annual budget of around $40,000.As a 
consequence she was given more 
responsibility in her daily work, thus 
relieving her superior of simple duties and 
increasing her own job satisfaction.” 
Made-to-measure 
training courses 
Petersen is in favour of a flexible approach 
whereby each employee can more or less 
design his or her own educational plan. 
“With so many people from very different 
backgrounds, you cannot make the same 
courses compulsory for everyone,” he says. 
“That would have a negative impact on 
motivation. We have to realize that people

prepared for change, to take responsibility 
and become students again.” On the other 
hand, Petersen adds, “all employees must 
prepare themselves for this. Otherwise we 
will lose out to other countries. 
Benny Petersen, a shop steward 
representing 70 unskilled workers, agrees. 
“Life—and working life in particular—has 
become a process of ongoing education,” he 
says. He joined the LEGO group 20 years 
ago, and he has lost track of the number of 
courses he has attended since then. In his 
opinion one of the best courses is the one- 
week course on “Preparing yourself for 
education”. 
“It may not look very relevant to most 
workers and I have met quite a few who were 
very sceptical beforehand,” he says. “But to 
me it shows that ‘soft issues’ like psychology 
are as relevant and important as hard skills.” 
The LEGO group makes wide use of 
local education institutions, using their 
regular courses as well as courses specially 
designed for its employees. “We are extremely 
fortunate in that Denmark has this highly 
developed system of skills training centres 
and other educational institutions that offer 
a variety of courses that are flexible to the 
needs of local business,” explains Aulbjerg. 
WORLD OF LEARNING 
“Representatives of local municipalities 
and counties sit on the boards of these 
institutions, and trade unions and employers’ 
associations are also represented. This 
ensures a very close dialogue between the 
institutions and local companies and enables 
the institutions to respond very quickly to 
local needs. If the LEGO group starts up a 
new production facility in a region, we talk 
with the local schools and can have special 
courses designed to meet our needs.” 
“This benefits both the employer and 
the employee,” Poul Erik Petersen says. “In 
fact, it can also be used as a means to 
achieve job security. The LEGO group and 
most other big companies have peak 
periods every year, but also periods with 
less work. During off-peak periods 
employees are often laid off or moved to 
other departments. With good planning 
these periods can be used for courses, 
which—again—is to the benefit of all of us.” 
But Aulbjerg emphasizes that the 
government subsidy isnot the driving force 
behind his company’s education policy. “It 
is based on our needs and priorities,” he 
says,“and in some cases we have declined 
subsidies that we were entitled to.” [|

Kills gaps 
in the workforce 
Adult education used to be a luxury, 
but today it has become an imperative, 
especially in commercial companies. 
In a “knowledge economy”, 
competitivity depends on “human 
resources” yet skills gaps are glaringly 
apparent in much of the labour force. The 
adult 
department, for example, reckons that 
US government’s education 
almost half of American workers are “at 
risk”,in the sense that they don’t have the 
necessary educational base to be trained in 
areas where jobs will be opening up in the 
next 20 years. 
But the pressure is on for short-term 
profitability. As a result, the first to be trained 
are,paradoxically, companies’best-qualified, 
most reliable workers, who also tend to be 
men. Those on temporary or part-time 
contracts are pretty much left out in the cold. 
by UNESCO’s 
International Institute for Education (UIE) in 
A study carried out 
Hamburg says a “dual learning society” is 
emerging and “the skills gap” is widening. 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
The available training facilities are clearly 
insufficient and too often inaccessible. 
According to the UIE study, carried out in 
six industrialized countries,between 14 and 
43 per cent of adults had spent at least six 
hours in training during the previous year. 
Between a third and a half of them paid for 
training out of their own pocket, despite the 
fact that big firms in industrialized countries 
spend between one and five per cent of their 
permanent wage bill on such training. 
Government aid is negligible and, according 
to the study, comprises less than 20 per cent 
of all adult training budgets. 
The second big problem is that links 
between this form of training and 
traditional education methods leave much 
to be desired and prevent the development 
of joint efforts in the field. 
In developing countries, such training 
obviously does not reach the huge informal 
sector. But, especially in big companies, 
there is more and more training. [| 
 
When schools 
fall down on the 
job 
pe school enrolment is steadily growing 
around the world, including in developing 
countries, where the number of pupils rose from 
305 million (77 per cent of all school-age 
children) in 1970 to nearly 561 million (86 per 
cent) in 1995. It is increasing faster than the 
population in most countries except in sub- 
Saharan Africa,where the number of children 
out of school grew by 12 million between 1985 
and 1995. 
The numbers speak for themselves, but what 
about the quality of education provided? The 
question is an urgent one. Going to school is 
one thing,graduating from it is another. In the 
industrialized countries, 99 per cent of children 
completed primary school in 1994-95 but only 
just over half managed to do so in the least 
developed countries. In the developing world 
asa whole, only three out of four children finish 
primary school and can read. 
What about the rest? A study done in China 
showed that nearly half the children in rural 
areas who drop out of primary school work on 
farmsand that 7.5 per cent have part-time jobs, 
a figure which rises to more than 27 per cent 
among their urban counterparts. Both in urban 
and rural areas, more than a third of children 
stay at home. 
Some 250 million children aged from five to 
14 in developing countries are forced to earn a 
living and half of them combine work, school 
and other unpaid activities. Three-fifths of all 
child workers live in Asia and a third in Africa. 
Paid work is both the cause and the result of 
dropping out of school, which remains one of 
the biggest problems of basic education. 
A new UNEesco report entitled Wasted 
Opportunities: When Schools Fail looks at the 
problem of wastage in the school system and 
gives many examples of original steps being 
taken to stop it. |

granny boom, since on average women live longer than men— is becoming a virtually universal 
phenomenon. Worldwide, the number of persons aged 65 and over will have increased fourfold 
between 1955 and 2025, and their percentage of the total population will have doubled (from 
5.3 per cent in 1965 to 10 per cent in 2025). 
In the more developed countries, where one person in five will be elderly, traditional policies 
towards aging are running out of steam, and two major social advances—the lowering of the 
retirement age and publicly financed pension schemes—are being widely contested.The problem 
is even more acute in the developing countries, where three-quarters of the world’s older people 
will be living 25 years from now. States are not providing care, traditional family structures are 
breaking down, and private mutual aid schemes are few and far between.As yet, however, no 
moves have been made in these countries to defuse this demographic time-bomb. 
There is a big risk that a kind of apartheid may develop between older people and a working 
population which would regard the elderly as an economic burden. Elderly people should not be 
segregated in this way by ageism.They must have opportunities to use their availability, their 
experience, their talents and their generosity in exchange for the solidarity they have the right 
to expect. It is through this kind of give-and-take that the world’s “greying” societies will be 
able to maintain or rediscover their unity. |

In the coming century the human life span may rise 
as high as 120 years. What are the implications of an 
aging world? 
  
* The International Longevity 
Center-USA,New York 
1 8 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
Over the past hundred years a silent and 
unprecedented revolution in longevity has 
occurred: people living in the industrialized 
world have on average gained 25 years of life, thanks 
largely to reduction of deaths at childbirth and 
infancy, and to control of diseases associated with 
old age. This is nearly equal to life expectancy 
advances over the preceding 5,000 years. In many 
countries, the 85-plus age group is the most rapidly 
growing. 
The next century may bring even more 
dramatic increases. Prevention and elimination of 
disease along with control over the aging process 
itself could push our life spans from a world 
average of 66 years today to closer to 110 or 120 
years—what scientists believe to be our “natural 
life span” because many individuals have lived that 
long. Some scientists talk of pushing the 
boundaries further by gaining control over the 
genes that determine longevity. 
But our enhanced life spans do not come 
without a price. As the demographic balance 
increasingly tips to the elderly, societies are seeing 
their cultural, political and economic orders put 
to the test. 
Among the most basic questions facing us are: 
At a time when the welfare state is coming under 
attack, who will be responsible for the financial 
support of the aged, the state or the individual Will 
the aging of societies lead to economic stagnation? 
Will the aged form a politically powerful minority 
and if so, what demands will that group make? In 
In extending our time on this 
planet, will we also be able to 
maintain quality of life? 
extending our time on this planet, will we also be 
able to maintain quality of life, or are we doomed to 
pass our later years in sickness, frailty and financial 
incertitude? Culturally, will some of the attention 
now concentrated on youth shift to the elderly? As 
women outlive men in most of the industrialized 
world, many of the challenges associated with old 
age are particularly pertinent to them.

revolution 
Our greater longevity has brought fundamental 
changes to our lives in ways that we either take for 
granted or of which we are hardly aware. For 
example, in 1920, a 10-year-old in the US only had 
a 40 per cent chance of having two of his or her 
possible four grandparents alive. Today, that figure 
is 80 per cent.T hus, despite romantic images of a 
tighter-knit family of former days, in fact,today we 
have a much greater proportion of multi- 
generational families than ever before. 
In many ways, life is improving for the aged. 
For example, in the 1950s the average age of 
admissions into nursing homes was 65. Now the 
age is closer to 81. Today, older people in 
industrialized countries also have more choices 
about how they live: assisted living, home care or 
community-based care, for example. Morbidity 
rates are falling as a result of progress against heart 
disease and stroke. 
‘Silver industries’ 
to cater for the over-50s 
One of the most fundamental issues is how to 
support the aged financially. Different societies have 
come up with different approaches. Despite its 
current economic difficulties, Japan adheres to a 
system under which the state provides for 
institutional and home care of the elderly. The 
United States is leading the way in a profit-oriented, 
managed care system, which emphasizes primary 
care, disease prevention and monitoring of 
distribution. However, the US is not going far 
enough nor moving rapidly enough given the 
trajectory of old age. Meanwhile, the former Soviet 
Union has made major cutbacks in health care 
while slashing pension benefits as well. 
So far much of our thinking about the aged has 
focused on them as a financial burden. But that 
attitude ignores fundamental facts that suggest to 
some extent that the very opposite is true. Today in 
the US pension funds amount to $2.7 trillion. T his 
is money that helps provide capital for investment 
in production of goods and services, everything 
from roads to computer software start-ups. Overall, 
in the US, pension funds account for a quarter of all 
capital formation. 
We must also remember that the aged represent 
an important group of consumers with very specific 
needs. Thus, in Japan, for example, a range of 
“silver industries” has grown up to cater to the 
housing, travel, recreation and other needs of those 
over 50.Similarly, in the United States companies 
talk increasingly about the senior or mature market. 
In recognition of the potential of this market, a 
number of publishers and electronic community 
builders have set up Internet web sites targeted at 
the aged, complete with advertisements aimed at 
And the Lord said, My 
spirit shall not always 
strive with man, for 
that he also is flesh: yet 
his days shall be an

winning their custom. Meanwhile, in attempting 
to add to their bottom lines, pharmaceuticals 
companies increasingly concentrate on needs of the 
elderly: in industrialized countries those over 65 
constitute roughly 15 per cent of the population 
but account for some 30 per cent of 
pharmaceuticals used. 
Politically, the elderly will become a more 
powerful group with whom political parties in 
democratic countries at least will have to reconcile 
their policies. In the US, for example, the “baby 
boomers,” born between 1946 and 1964 will begin 
to retire in the year 2008.In the decade beginning 
from 2020, they will constitute 20 per cent of the 
US population and as much as 30 per cent of the 
electorate. Political candidates will no doubt have to 
pay increasing attention to their needs. 
As societies struggle to address the challenges of 
aging populations, mere reorganization of the services 
to the elderly is no longer adequate. We require a

redesign of the way we approach the needs of the 
elderly. In order for redesign to take place, some of our 
basic assumptions about the nature and character of 
old age must be questioned. This is already 
happening. Beginning in the 1950s, industrialized 
society began to perceive old age not as a period of life 
that is biologically fixed, but as one that is mutable. 
The feel-good 
factor 
There are a number of reasons for these 
changing views. For one, the self-image of the aged 
has been changing. Increasingly, they now see 
themselves as vibrant and energetic and are not 
willing to let life end at retirement. Secondly, 
gerontologists now have a better understanding of 
the underlying mechanism of aging itself. This is 
leading to an appreciation of the possibility and 
reality of interventions, both preventative and 
therapeutic. 
The growing demographic weight of the elderly 
is forcing us to reevaluate many of our old views. 
Since people are living longer, should they not work 
longer as well? To that question I would give a 
qualified yes. In the US, if we do not change our 
attitudes, we may by around the year 2020 have 
some 60 million idle people in retirement not 
contributing to society. We cannot afford to have 
so many people idle. Passage of the Age 
Discrimination Act in 1988 was a step forward as it 
no longer made retirement dependent on age itself. 
The market place has already absorbed millions of 
women and minorities, so there is no reason why 
jobs should not be found for older people as well. 
Yet there are still many challenges ahead of us. 
The developing world has not generally enjoyed 
the same increase in longevity and decreased birth 
rates that have been seen in industrialized countries. 
Sixty per cent of persons over the age of 60 
currently live in the developing world and this is 
expected to increase to 80 per cent by around the 
year 2025. Thus, there will be profound social,

Life expectancy: 
two big 
exceptions 
eople are living longer in many parts of the world, 
but at least two world regions constitute an exception 
to this trend,according to a forthcoming United Nations 
publication, World Population Prospects—the 1998 
Revision. 
In sub-Saharan Africa,the Aids pandemic is raging. 
The worst-hit countries are mostly in the south— South 
Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe— except for Kenya and Rwanda. 
More than 10 per cent of the population in this 
region is infected with HIV, the virus which leads to Aids. 
This means that life expectancy at birth is falling.It has 
already dropped from 53.4 years in the period 1985-1990 
to 47.6 for 1995-2000,and is expected to fall further to 
47.1 in the period 2010-2015. Without the pandemic, 
the figures would have been respectively 54.2, 58 and 
63.4 years So Aids will have caused a drop of 16.3 years 
in life expectancy over a quarter of a century. 
A similar, though much smaller trend is developing in 
three Asian countries (Cambodia, India and Thailand), 
wherethe pandemic is expected to cut life expectancy by an 
average 1.6 years over the same period, and in two Latin 
American nations (Brazil and Haiti), where the predicted 
drop is 1.4 years. 
In the former eastern bloc countries, life expectancy 
has been growing more slowly than elsewhere and is 
now falling. The trend began in the fading years of 
communism and has since gathered speed mainly for 
economic reasons (the massive reduction in pensions) 
and because of social factors (loosening family ties). Life 
expectancy at birth in Russia, which rose from 67.6 to 
69.2 years between 1980 and 1985,fell to 66.5 in 1990 
and 64.4 in 1995. It is also dropping in Ukraine (from 
70.4 in 1985 to 68.8 in 1995),Belarus (71.3 to 69.6) and 
Bulgaria (71.6 to 71.2), though the figure is stationary in 
Romania (69.5 years). [|

Now in his seventies, no longer able to work

Like millions of other elderly in the world’s

through the gaps as the state-run cradle-to- 
cremation welfare system is being dismantled and 
a new old-age pension regime based on Western 
models is slowly being built. 
The government will have to work fast to fill 
the gaps. China is the world’s fastest aging 
developing country. Within the next 30 years, 
there will be an estimated 275 million people— 
more than the present total population of the 
United States—in China over the age of 60. That 
will mean roughly one in five people will be in 
retirement or close to it. As aresult of a one-child 
family policy aimed at stopping the country’s

Pension reform:

Traditionally, the aged could rely on the 
support of their children and grandchildren. After 
China’s 1949 communist revolution people like 
Liu were guaranteed food, clothing, medical care, 
housing and burial expenses through the collective 
farm. 
Under the free-market reforms begun in the 
late 1970s, Chinese rural families are once again 
independent farmers. While the move to private 
farming has made many parts of rural China rich, 
it has also left the aged once again dependent on 
either their families or themselves. 
So far the government is only beginning to 
introduce pension schemes in the countryside. »

The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
There has been much more progress on this front in 
the cities, but even there progress has been slow. 
Before the free-market economic reforms, state- 
owned enterprises provided for the elderly. Now 
the central government is cutting back on subsidies 
to those enterprises, forcing them to look at the 
bottom line. Recognizing that state-run enterprises 
won’t reach profitability without shedding their 
social welfare responsibilities, the government 1s 
trying to find new ways of providing social safety 
nets. Thus, pension reform is being given a high 
priority. And none too soon either: elderly people 
have recently mounted protests in a number of large 
cities to press their companies to honour pension 
commitments. 
The aim is eventually to have a national pension 
scheme with individuals, their employers and 
. With a rapidly aging population and a huge 
proportion of its elderly people opting for 
early retirement, Finland is facing the 
prospect of unprecedented labour shortage.The 
rate of greying in Finland is faster than in other 
European Union countries and the number of 
young workers replacing the retiring elders is not 
proportionate. 
The average age of the Finnish population is on 
the rise owing partly to changes in the age groups 
and partly to the increased life expectancy rate. 
Today the elderly constitute 15 per cent of the total 
population of around five million. This reflects the 
fact that Finland witnessed a higher birth rate than 
any other country during the West’s post-World War 
IT baby boom. 
Though the statutory retirement age is 65 years, 
80 per cent of the population retire before they 
reach 60 years of age.Carin Lindqvist-Virtanen, a 
senior researcher at the Ministry of Social Affairs, 
Helsinki,says that if the present trend to take early 
retirement continues “then it will cause serious 
problems for the labour market in the future as not 
many young people will be there to replace the 
retiring workers. The massive exodus [into 
retirement] could also weaken the financial position 
of the pension scheme.” 
Among Finnish men, participation in the labour 
market for the 55-59 group is among the lowest of 
the Organization of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries. One main reason 
insurance firms providing the bulk of retirement 
funds. The government is to be responsible only 
for supplements. At the moment, though, municipal 
governments are handling pension reforms in the 
best way they see fit. 
For example, in Foshan City in the southern 
province of Guangdong, a pension fund has been 
set up with employers contributing an amount 
equivalent to 10 per cent of workers’ wages. Workers 
pay four per cent of their pay to the fund. 
“The first step is always difficult to take,” said 
Zhou Xiaochuan, President of the Construction 
Bank of China, calling for further pension reform at 
the earliest possible date. “Otherwise China’s 
pension system will face serious problems in the 
decade between 2010 and 2020.” [| 
Huang Yan in Beijing 
for this development, analysts say, has been the 
government’s encouragement of early retirement 
during the economic recession of the early 1990s. 
This included favourable options like handsome 
pension and unemployment benefits allowing 
people to retire comfortably at the age of 55. 
Age discrimination has been cited by social 
scientists as another factor leading employees to 
take early retirement. According to a report by 
Finland’s National Committee on Aging policy, 
elderly people are subject to discrimination and 
receive degrading treatment.“The elderly are still 
frequently treated as economically non-productive 
people, a care burden or encumbrance and a 
medical problem,” it says. 
The government has also been discussing the 
possibility of raising the retirement age to 67 years 
to tackle the labour shortage problem. However, 
critics argue that there is little point in doing that 
until more people can be encouraged to work up to 
the statutory retirement age of 65 years. 
The Finnish government last year launched a 
five-year programme to stop age discrimination in 
the workplace. Annikki Korhonen, senior Adviser at 
the National Research and Development Centre 
for Welfare and Health, says that this National 
Programme for Aging Workers (NPAW) seeks to 
initiate a change in attitude which will help improve 
the position of aging workers and reduce the exodus 
of labour. [|

smaller proportion of the population than they 
do in developed regions, but their numbers are 
growing much faster than those of the rest of the 
population. In fact, as the World Health 
Organization’s 1998 World Health Report points 
out, “Most of the increase in older populations will 
occur in developing countries, which will face the 
most serious challenges in providing a ‘welfare 
package’of services for their older people.” 
Most low-income developing countries have 
hardly begun to face up to the aging of their 
populations, for reasons which are understandable. 
Many countries in tropical Africa, for example, are 
confronted with urgent problems including rapid 
population growth, high infant and child mortality, 
and excessive rural-urban migration. 
| In developing countries the elderly make up a 
Rampant urbanization 
According to one study, the size of the older 
population in developing countries was expected to 
increase by almost 90 per cent between 1980 and 
2000, and by over 300 per cent by 2025." T here are 
considerable regional variations in this growth. In 
Africa, for example, little change in the age structure 
of the population is expected until 2025. In East Asia, 
however, growth will be substantial, while China 
stands out as the most rapidly aging society, with a 
population structure that by 2025 will be closer to that 
of the developed regions than it is today. 
Urbanization has been an essential part of most 
countries’ development in recent decades, and in 
developed regions there is a disproportionate 
representation of older persons in urban areas and 
inner suburbs. In the developing countries the age 
structures of urban populations seem to be following 
this trend, but at the same time certain specific 
regional and national tendencies are apparent. In 
1.El-Badry, M.A.“Aging in Developing Countries: One 
more population problem?’ In Economic and Social 
Implications of Aging, United Nations,New York,1988.

Nana Apt* 
Africa, for example, older persons are more likely to 
live in rural areas than their counterparts in other 
world regions. In Asia, there has been a trend towards 
urbanization of the elderly, although a substantial 
majority still remain in rural areas. It is expected 
that by 2000 older persons in Latin America are 
more likely to live in urban than rural areas. 
Weakened family ties 
Economic and social factors are bound to have an 
adverse impact on the situation of older people during 
the process of urbanization and industrialization that 
is currently underway in the developing countries. 
That process gradually weakens traditional family 
patterns which provide social roles for older persons 
and ensure that they play a pivotal role in society 
even as they advance in age. The crucial question is 
whether cultural norms in these countries will remain 
strong enough for families to maintain their ties to the 
elderly as the dependency burden increases. 
The growth in the numbers of older people in the 
developing world is taking place in a context where 
traditional obligations are changing, and the domestic 
arrangements of the intergenerational family which 
traditionally supported older persons are under threat. 
T he indicators increasingly reveal a trend away from 
the traditional perceptions and practices of obligations 
towards respect and care for the elderly. 
Support for the growing numbers of older 
people will largely depend on informal services 
provided by their kinsfolk. However, neglect and 
isolation of the elderly are surfacing in many African 
countries, for example, where only a relatively small 
number of people in formal employment are entitled 
to social security. 
Low wages and job insecurity make it hard for 
younger Africans living in cities to support their 
elderly kin, just as their counterparts in rural areas are 
finding it hard to meet the needs of the rural elderly. 
In one study on the views of Ghanaian youth on 
aging, 81 per cent of those questioned expressed 
the opinion that it was no longer feasible for young 
families to live with their elderly relatives. 
Clearly, the domestic separation of the urban 
elderly from the traditional structure is a reflexion 
of the changing nature of the traditional family in 
Africa. There is an evident difference of loyalties 
between the newer urbanized conjugal family and »

the extended traditional family. However,it would 
be a mistake to think that this development is simply 
the outcome of the adoption of “modern” values 
and attitudes;infrastructural and structural factors 
are involved. Urban housing conditions, for 
example, go along way to explaining these changes. 
In rural Ghana, accommodation can easily be 
provided for all social categories. Shortage of land 
is not a factor and simple additional dwellings are 
constructed out of local materials as the need arises. 
Urban accommodation on the other hand usually 
has to be paid for with cash and landlords often 
impose a limit on the number of persons entitled to 
inhabit their property. These factors all bring 
pressure to bear on families, especially large families. 
Longevity creates the possibility that household 
and kinship structures will contain four or five 
generations, whereas previously three generations 
was the predominant form. In other words, the 
working generation will be called on to take care of 
its parents, grandparents and great grandparents.

### 114708: Indian elders with nowhere to go

Indian elders with 
nowhere to go 
The few old people’s homes are overcrowded and 
traditional family solidarity is breaking down 
In India, where the traditional joint family 
system is breaking down and there is a dearth 
of homes for the aged, most elderly people 
face an uncertain future. 
India, the world’s second most populous nation, 
 
Aging is the most 
unexpected event in a 
man’ life.

2 4 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
has more aged people than the entire population of 
France. Official statistics show that there were 56 
million Indians above 60 years of age in 1991, 
amounting to 6.5 per cent of the total population of 
844 million. Only 10 per cent of them have a pension 
and access to some form of health scheme. T he rest 
have no health care, insurance or assured financial 
support. More Indian elders will be in a similar 
situation as government projections indicate that the 
60-plus population could double between 1991 and 
2016. 
Traditionally, the average Indian’s life centred 
on the family. Joint families were the norm and the 
elderly stayed with their sons and relatives. Analysts 
say mass migration from the countryside to the 
cities and overseas, coupled with changing social 
values, have led to the disintegration of multi- 
generational families. As a result, many aged people 
are left to fend for themselves. 
Even today, moving into an old people’s home 
carries a social stigma because it suggests that one 
International Labour Office, Geneva, 
1997 
has been abandoned by one’s own children. But 
many elders have no choice. However, Indian old 
people’s homes are already overcrowded. 
According to a directory issued by the Centre for 
theWelfare of the Aged (CEWA), a non-governmental 
organization, in 1995 India had about 500 
government-funded homes for the aged, of which 17 
per cent were for women. Most of these homes are run 
by Christian missionaries and charitable foundations. 
These homes are the only option for those with little 
or no money. Together with some 200 private homes, 
these institutions, both government-aided and private, 
can handle only 30,000 people. 
“The waiting list is long and substantial 
numbers of elders belonging to the poor and the 
lower middle class will never find a place in 
government-funded homes,” says T. Krishnan Nair, 
secretary of the CEWA. “In the last 10 years,private 
homes have appeared which only cater to upper 
middle class and rich elders. These homes charge 
exorbitant prices which elders from the middle- 
class and poor sectors of society can’t afford.” 
Of the homes that exist, many fall far short of 
providing basic amenities like clean water and good 
food. The main problem,social workers say, is that 
there are no rules and no organization to keep tabs

the Philippines, older people are already less likely to 
be living with children than the younger old. 
As the demographic balance alters the political 
balance between youth and age, so changes in the 
labelling of the older person are to be expected. In the 
industrial world, these changes are already beginning 
to occur. In the developing countries, the process is 
likely to take longer. However, the development of a 
generational politics in the industrial world will 
influence the development of the political capacity of 
older persons in the developing world. Advocacy by the 
lobbying institutions of older persons in the industrial 
world should help to raise the profile of older people’s 
interests in the developing world. 
The emergence of the four- to five-generational 
world will necessarily result in altered social roles and 
identities for the old. The aging of society will also, unless 
existing inequalities are addressed, result in the 
accentuation of gender disparities in respect of wealth 
and quality of life. Given these considerations, steps 
must be taken to develop new bases of sociability and 
esteem for older generations. New technology can be 
harnessed to increase the political capacity and enhance 
the sociability of older persons. It can provide a technical 
bridge for linking older persons globally and enable the 
old of the developing world to gain direct assistance from 
their counterparts in the developed world. It also 
provides new opportunities for older persons to 
participate in shaping the research and policy agenda 
appropriate to an aging world. [|

most elderly people still live with their 
families,” says Abla Sebai, a member of the 
country’s National Committee for Old People, 
which was founded a year ago. In fact,83 per cent 
of over-60s still live with their relatives. But, in a 
trend which may spread throughout the Arab world, 
links between generations are more and more 
strained and there is now a growing number of 
lonely and very poor elderly people. 
Aunt Marie has tears in her eyes as she looks at 
pictures from her youth. Her only remaining 
relative is a niece, living abroad, and a nephew who 
only makes fleeting visits every fortnight.She is 75 
and lives alone in the east Beirut suburb of 
Ashrafieh in one room furnished with a bed and 
two sofas. She walks with difficulty and is part of the 
61 per cent of the population without health 
insurance. T he social security authorities cut people 
off as soon as they retire.“Less than 10 per cent of 
the working population receives an adequate 
pension,” says Sebai. 
Joseph Tautal, a founder-member of the Rifak 
al-Darb organization set up in 1994 to help the 
aged poor in Ashrafieh,says that “67 old people are 
living alone and without resources in this 
neighbourhood. Some of them beg in the streets of 
Beirut.” He says people, “especially the youth, are 
still mostly unaware of the problem but a movement 
is growing among church congregations and 
humanitarian groups because there is no system 
which helps the elderly living alone.”

Seven per cent of Lebanese are over 65, the 
highest proportion of old people in the Arab world, 
where the average is reckoned to be four per cent. 
By 2021, the Lebanese figure is expected to reach 
eight per cent and 12.8 per cent four years after 
that. “At present, there are many young Lebanese,” 
says Lebanese demographer Hala Naufal, “but 
there is a clear aging trend which is going to spread 
to the other Arab countries.” 
A long waiting list 
However there is still no government policy 
concerning the elderly, much less for people living 
alone. Even preliminary studies have not been 
done. So everything depends on charitable 
organizations. And because of a serious lack of 
money and resources, the 37 non-governmental 
organizations which are doing the government’s 
job have given priority to caring for old people who 
are ill. 
St.George’s Home, which is linked to the Greek 
Orthodox Church, has been taking in the elderly 
since 1874.“Sixty of our 133 beds are unusable,” 
says Father Demetrios Khoury, who runs the home. 
“T he state doesn’t pay its due and 68 per cent of the 
old people with no family left don’t pay anything.” 
Within two years, he hopes to have 220 beds 
available. For the time being, he is turning away 
new patients who cannot pay, even if they are ill. 
But the home still has a long waiting list. 
The situation is the same at the Dar al-Ajaza 
al-Islami Hospital, a private clinic run by the 
Muslim community. “With 3,000 beds for an over- 
65 population of 225,000, we have a real problem,” 
says the hospitals gerontologist. “There aren’t 
many people in my field. T here are only seven of us 
officially registered with the D octor’s Guild, four of 
us since 1995, and demand is growing all the time.” 
In three years, only four new institutions for the 
elderly have been opened. 
Moreover the economic crisis and the trend 
towards individualism which the war years created 
have set off developments and changes in lifestyles 
which have eaten away at family solidarity. 
“Increasingly, families say they no longer have the 
space, time or money to look after relatives,” says 
Mrs Wehbé, director of the Wehbé Home for old 
people who are ill. 
Families are getting poorer and 34 per cent of 
the population lives below the poverty line. 
“Women are the people who look after old people 
at home,” says Sebai. “But more and more of them 
have outside jobs. In 15 years time, the situation 
will be really critical.” [|

Argentina is a country where old people are 
a poor. Badly treated economically and socially, 
they are society’s cast-offs, forgotten in the 
dark recesses of memory. 
They represent 12 per cent of the total 
population, yet they are shabbily treated by the 
government, which relegates them to the sidelines 
of society. There are 4,500,000 over-60s,and only 
2,800,000 of them receive some kind of old age 
pension. More than 1,500,000 people have no 
insurance coverage whatever and live in dire 
poverty. 
Official economic adjustment policies have 
always targeted the pension system. In 1992, 
bowing to pressure from the World Bank, President 
Carlos Menem’s government reduced the benefits 
paid to most pensioners to $150 a month.The bulk 
of Argentine society is unperturbed by this state 
of affairs and looks on the fate of its elders with 
indifference. 
One quarter of the pensioners still receive $150 
a month, an absurdly small amount which is not 
even enough to pay for the medicines they need. 
Some 50 per cent of the 1,500,000 recipients of 
pensions get less than $350 a month and, at the 
top of the scale, fewer than three per cent get more 
than $1,000.

The story of the Integral Medical Care 
Programme (PAMI) illustrates the decline in 
benefits available to retired people. The 
programme was established in 1971 and in its 
early years it was an efficient medical and social 
services agency which operated on its own funds. 
Its current statutes empower it to administer its 
own resources, which come from the 
contributions made by active and retired workers 
and compulsory employer contributions. Until 
the 1980s, on an annual budget not exceeding 
$1,700,000, PAMI covered the entire country 
and opened a total of 55 new health care centres. 
At the present time, this 
welfare agency has a budget of $2,400,000 
for providing care for 4,000,000 registered 
members but it contracts the work out to service 
providers because it does not have the relevant 
infrastructure. 
Cutbacks in 
medical services 
The quality of the services provided has 
steadily declined over the past ten years, during 
which PAMI was managed by eight different 
administrators or presidents, who were suspected 
or accused of taking part in or countenancing the 
operation of parallel medical or health care 
networks. Bribery and corruption were 
commonplace and the credibility, efficiency and 
functioning of the system suffered. On more than 
one occasion, PAMI was virtually insolvent. Today, 
old people are suffering from the sudden cutback 
in services that are essential to their survival,such 
as medicines, care by family doctors and the 
postponement of surgical operations, owing to the 
failure to pay anaesthetists. 
Since the early 1990s, retired people 
demonstrate every Wednesday in front of the 
parliament building. This event, which in its heyday 
mobilized more than 10,000 demonstrators and 
brought traffic to a halt in Buenos Aires, has now 
almost become reduced to a picturesque 
happening. Since the death in 1996 of the protest 
leader, Norma P14, a pensioner who resorted to 
such unconventional tactics as chaining herself to 
the railings of the parliament building and 
organizing a popular demonstration in front of the 
law courts, it has lost its widespread appeal and 
impact. As the government rejected its every 
demand, the members of the movement lost heart. 
But penniless though they may be, the 
pensioners still enjoy one enviable bonus—they 
constitute 20 per cent of the electorate. It is a 
strange paradox that there is no nationwide 
movement to press for the rights and interests of 
retired people. [|

a Old age is as much a historical and cultural 
construct as a natural phenomenon. It is 
based on biological,demographic, economic 
and political factors, but it is also built on the image 
of old age—in some cases positive, in others less 
so—that each society shapes in conformity with its 
values and its conception of what constitutes an 
ideal human being. 
Some cultures have emphasized the positive 
side of growing old by viewing human 
development as a lifelong process in which the 
aging individual accumulates qualities and 
experiences. One example of this can be found in 
the traditional rural societies of Africa, where social 
differentiation is based on age, which establishes 
the superiority of the older over the younger 
generation. In these societies the elderly are few in 
number but they play a big role. 
Those who possess the secret 
of the sacred myth that describes

profound meaning of things and

In these systems where the oral tradition 
prevails, knowledge is the property of the very old— 
not so much technical knowledge, which anyone 
can soon absorb,as “mythical knowledge”that no 
young person can take away from them. Those who 
possess the secret of the sacred myth that describes 
the group’s origins, know the profound meaning 
of things and the Law of the Ancestors, in other 
words the principle that governs and regulates the 
social order. Myth engenders ritual,the repetition 
of the primordial gesture, making the elderly the 
officiants of the domestic cult, capable of uttering

sacred words,unleashing vital good or evil powers 
and issuing blessings and curses. 
The elderly have a vitally important 
educational role because of their mastery of 
knowledge. As well as telling young generations 
about myth, they must transmit the history of the 
group and its social rules, of which they are the 
guardians. Transmission takes place in stages, 
especially during the initiation ceremonies which 
are milestones in the education process, enabling 
the elderly to keep part of the secret knowledge as 
long as possible and guaranteeing their cultural, 
religious and political hegemony. Gerontocratic 
power is rooted in this system. “The process is 
simple,” says French anthropologist Louis Vincent 
Thomas. It consists of “confiscating basic 
knowledge, then serving it to the rising age groups 
in precisely-measured doses at well-calculated 
intervals through a language rich in symbols and 
highly emotional resonances.” 
Benefactions 
from beyond the grave 
Aging is thus a process of acquisition, and the 
image of the elderly is highly positive. An old man 
is wise. He sets an example and has cheated death 
by drawing inspiration from the group’s values. He 
doesnot fear death, which will reunite him with his 
ancestors and enable him to continue being useful 
to the community by eternally making 
benefactions to his descendants. Envisaging life as

an ongoing progression that continues after death 
leads to a conception of old age as the last stage of 
an ascension towards fullness of knowledge and 
power. 
What Western societies call loss of faculties, 
disability and degeneration are symptoms of a 
metamorphosis towards a higher stage. If an old 
person can’t keep to the point, perhaps he is talking 
with the ancestors. If he goes blind or deaf, he is 
seeing and listening to the spirits. If he shrivels up 
and finds it hard to get about, he has become a 
spirit. Accomplished, close to God and the 
ancestors, he lives as one of the elect. In such a 
society people enjoy aging and saying they are old— 
even very, very old. The term has many positive 
associations. Adding “wise” would be redundant. 
The quest 
for eternal youth 
Western societies, on the other hand, divide 
the human life span into successive periods in 
which phases of growth, maturity and climax are 
followed by decline and fall, leading to the 
inevitable, irreversible end. Faced with the 
unprecedented increase in life expectancy and the 
ever-growing number of elderly persons, these 
societies have two watchwords: individual 
resistance to aging and the solidarity of all with 
the poorest elderly people. 
Since old age is neither desirable nor enviable, 
people should try and delay its onset as long as 
possible. They have no right to squander their 
capital of youthfulness; they must resist the ravages 
In Western societies 
this time of life is dominated 
by negative images 
of time by leading healthy lives and taking 
advantage of all the remedies science has to offer— 
pills, health creams or surgery. The purpose of 
preventive action against old age is not to develop a 
person’s capacities for living but to reject this stage 
of life because it is viewed as degrading. 
This struggle is a matter of individual 
responsibility and the “losers”—those who fail to 
stay young in mind and body when they fall ill, 
suffer bereavement or have an accident—feel guilty. 
For them, life has taken a sudden, drastic turn.T hey 
have entered old age, the age of dependence.The 
criterion upon which this transition is based is not 
social or cultural but biological. It depends on an 
individual’s physical capacities rather than on his or 
her chronological age. In Western societies this time 
of life is dominated by negative images—Iloneliness, 
incapacity and social uselessness. 
Caring is the key word. When old age is 
synonymous with inadequacy and decline certain 
things have to be done.Social workers specializing 
in geriatric care use special assessment methods to 
decide what kind of assistance should be given and

aging is that you stay

[ 
what resources should be used, from geriatric 
medicine to long-term care facilities. T his process 
has a logic of its own and raises the question of the 
cost of dependence, which strengthens the 
overwhelming image of the elderly as an economic 
burden.Never,perhaps, has a society done so much 
for its oldest members. T hey benefit from economic 
and social protection, but the image society has of 
them is deeply negative. 
Segregation 
between age groups 
Historians have shown that a society’s image of 
individuals at a given stage of life has a significant 
bearing on the way they are treated. Paradoxically, 
Western societies, where there are more and more 
elderly people, organize an unprecedented form of 
segregation between the age groups. Young and old 
pursue different activities in different places at 
different times. The harmonious mingling of the 
ages in a shared setting no longer exists. 
In Africa, the transformation of the traditional 
context by such processes as urbanization, 
schooling and the development of a culture based 
on the written word, the intermingling of 
populations, the spread of new religions and the 
arrival of new, more individualistic values are 
diluting if not destroying the community system 
and gerontocracy. Knowledge and power have 
changed hands. Those societies may be witnessing 
the “twilight of the old”. However, no society 
remains frozen. And even when the age pyramid is 
turned upside down—when more people start 
appearing at the top than at the bottom, as in the 
West or in some Asian countries that have 
implemented proactive birth control policies— 
solidarity may still have a role to play—but only if 
aprocess of give-and-take between generations is 
restored to human relationships. |

women, hip-swinging to the “hot tamale” dance 
step and grinning wide to the twangs of country 
music. No, this is not a bar scene in a b-grade movie 
about lonesome cowboys. It’s 10 o’clock in the morning 
in a suburb outside of the northeastern US city of 
Philadelphia. These gals are out for fun and fitness, 
making the most of their retirement at the Four Seasons 
at Hershey’s Mill, one of the many “adult communities” 
mushrooming in affluent areas across the United States. 
At first sight, it looks like a typical middle-class 
neighbourhood, with new single-story homes and 
postage stamp lawns at a starting price of about a 
quarter of a million dollars. But on aTuesday morning 
when most of American suburbia resembles a no- 
man’s land with kids in school and adults at work, this 
area is bustling with golfers on the 18-hole course, 
joggers along wooded trails and couples congregating 
in the local restaurant for a lecture on art history. And 
a look inside the homes offers other signs that this 
community is designed for older people. There are 
very few stairs to climb and the light switches are all 
placed low on the walls to minimize any painful 
stretching of an arthritic shoulder. And in case of a 
health emergency or a burglary, two “panic buttons” in

We're catering to baby-boomers who feel they've 
worked hard and deserve a carefree life.” So social 
activities, from Yiddish classes to bingo, are organized 
between tennis games and a swim at the pool, while 
maintenance crews look after the gardening. Guard 
patrols along with wooden and concrete gates enclosing 
the community offer a sense of security and prestige. 
You won't find any teenagers blasting their stereos. At 
Hershey's Mill, as in other adult communities across the 
country, federal law stipulates that 80 per cent of 
dwellings for the elderly must be occupied by at least 
one person over the age of 55. The remaining 20 per 
cent is open to those over 43. But residence is strictly 
forbidden for anyone under the age of 18. 
“It’s like a resort here,” says Tom Carroll, a 
Hershey's Mill resident. “When you get to my age, 62, 
life’s about having fun, fun, fun. No more kids to 
support or so many things to buy.” About 80 per cent 
of residents are retired. “But that doesn’t mean we're 
not busy,” says Carroll, who proudly unveils the “Barbie 
dollhouse” he is building in the community wood-shop. 
“It’s for the grandkids. Eight of the 10 of them live within 
20 miles of here. Who needs em any closer?” 
More people like Carroll are choosing to stay in 
adult communities close to where they raised their 
families instead of moving to retirement hot-spots like 
Florida and Arizona. Already about 10 per cent of 
Americans over 55 live in these communities and more 
are springing up, particularly in northeastern states 
like Pennsylvania where about 25 per cent of the 
population falls in this age group. 
Not everyone is so charmed by the lifestyle. “We like 
diversity,” says Bill Hoffman, who has decided not to 
move in after visiting the community. “It can be 
depressing to always be around older people.” Chuck 
Hennessy just signed the mortgage for anew home at 
Hershey's Mill. “Where I live now, I have all kinds of 
neighbours—couples of all colours, singles, lesbians. I 
like that mixture”, which he won’t find in the 
overwhelmingly white new neighbourhood. “But aside 
from the occasional party, there wasn’t enough 
socializing to miss.” For Lucille Jorgenson, the lack of 
diversity is compensated by “a sense of oneness” forged 
by common interests. “My husband and I moved here 
because we felt comfortable in knowing that if one of 
us died, the other would be established in a community 
of people our age, with activities we could take part in.” 
The downside of such a tightly-knit community lies 
in the many rules to follow, covering everything from 
where kids can play to the obligatory white window 
curtains to ensure a classic look from the outside. “It’s a 
problem when our grandkids visit,” says M arthaTurney. 
“I'm allowed to rollerblade, but my six-year-old grandson 
isn’t.” As her husband Bob explains, “A lot of people have 
trouble adjusting to this group mentality but they get over 
it. There are also those who just love to argue over the 
trivial rules like where you place a flower pot. But then 
again, you'll always find people who need to argue about 
something. What else do they have to do?’ [|

African youth makes a takeover 
The upheavals that have rocked African societies in the past half-century have 
undermined the elders’ traditional power base

political, social and economic order dominated 
by the elders seems doomed to extinction. 
The elders exercised—and still do, though to 
a much lesser extent—authority in the context of 
a rural, clan-based society where technical, social 
and religious knowledge was acquired during a 
long process. Traditionally, the oldest family 
member managed the land, the main productive 
resource. He divided it up, distributed the revenues 
and decided how unconsumed products should be 
used. Management of agricultural surpluses gave 
rise to the main source of his power. He received 
and gave girls in marriage, since he alone was able 
to provide them with a dowry. The younger males 
were thus dependent on him when they took a wife. 
Marriage was a decisive step towards social 
promotion and claiming a birthright. An elder 
could use his wealth to increase the number of his 
wives and strengthen his social ties. 
The elder’s power also had a political and 
religious basis. He presided over the village’s destiny 
by taking part in the council of elders and 
administering the ancestor cult. As a member of 
secret organizations he helped enforce respect for 
the social order and sanctioned anyone who broke

the rules. The elder was the master, even though 
he consulted the younger members of the 
community, especially on family matters. He was 
treated with deep respect. Young people and women 
adopted a submissive attitude towards him. 
When individualism 
erodes clan structures 
Most African societies are patrilineal, and 
women and children live with the husband’s family. 
Women had an inferior social status. They acquired 
influence with the onset of menopause, which 
brought their condition closer to that of the men, 
but never obtained the right to represent or head 
the family. Even after reaching an advanced age, 
they were barred from taking part in official 
decision-making and enjoyed no economic or 
social power. At best, they wielded their authority 
in the private arena, especially over their daughters- 
in-law. 
In the recent past a series of events and 
developments have enabled youth to supplant 
their elders. Colonization, the arrival of 
Christianity and Islam and the implementation 
and subsequent spread of the market economy 
and the wage-earning system have placed more »

emphasis on the individual than the clan and 
taken a toll on traditional structures. But the 
decisive factors in the emancipation of young 
people have been education and urbanization. 
In the 1940s and 1950s, the small minority 
admitted to Western universities played a key role in 
transforming African societies and ousting their 
elders from positions of power. Western education 
discredited the wisdom of the elders. Now, “those 
who know” are those who have gone to school and 
are, therefore, young. Their studies, which they 
pursue in town, enable them to escape from the 
elders’control. 
During the colonial period, primary schools, 
missions and colleges of education helped train a 
group of young, skilled, “educated” Africans 
including teachers, civil servants and health 
workers. Some turned away from their fellow 
Africans and African values, while others grew 
aware of colonial oppression and became close to 
the working class forming in the cities. They were in 
the vanguard of political and labour struggles as 
well as the battle for independence. Most of the 
earliest African heads of state were young. But by 
clinging to power until an advanced age, some have 
lent credence to the idea that the African 
gerontocracy has not had its last word. 
The spread of 
Western values 
The overall development of African society 
nevertheless continues to undermine the 
gerontocracy’s foundations. Urbanization has dealt 
a blow to an essentially rural-based political 
organization. In the 1940s, economic activities 
began shifting towards the cities. Young people are 
the most mobile group, capable of adapting to city 
life, to new technology and to modern forms of 
work. They are also more receptive to the spread of 
Western values,conveyed by the school system, the 
administration and the media. Granted, young city- 
dwellers are still attached to the villages where they 
were born. But by living far from their 
communities, they are gradually adopting new 
lifestyles and becoming self-sufficient. A more 
individualistic society is taking shape in which the 
relationships of domination and allegiance between 
young people and the old generations are dying 
out.Any young man who can afford to can now get 
married. Even in the countryside, which is 
intensifying its exchanges with the cities, these 
developments are having an effect. 
But on two counts change is coming slower. 
First, gender inequality persists and women, 
including in the cities, are still subject to the 
goodwill of the men in their families. Second, most 
young Africans remain dependent on the group 
because of low urbanization and school attendance 
rates,unemployment and poverty. The question of 
whether they will be able to take over the reins from 
their parents is posed today in dramatic terms. WH

### 114715: When are we leaving?

‘When are 
we leaving? 
A husband’s moving chronicle 
of his wife’s descent into 
Alzheimer’s disease 
JB is an elderly retired professional man who 
A lives quietly in an English provincial city. Early 
in 1997 his 77-year-old wife was diagnosed as 
suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an age-related 
degenerative brain disorder which affects memory, 
thinking, behaviour and emotion. 
The first sign that something was seriously 
amiss had come two years before, when IM had 
gone to London to visit friends. She had failed to 
arrive and returned home, having completely 
forgotten where she was going.Before that,during 
a question-and-answer session at an academic 
gathering, she had been uncharacteristically lost 
for words. The couple saw their doctor who asked 
IM who the Prime Minister was. She said she had 
no idea but that surely it didn’t matter. There 
followed a series of brain scans and exhaustive 
memory and language tests, as a result of which 
she was diagnosed as being in the early stages of 
Alzheimer’s. 
Inexorable 
mental decline 
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form 
of dementia, a malady that afflicts one in 20 people 
over the age of 65. It affects all groups in society 
irrespective of social class,gender,ethnic group or 
geographical location. According to current 
estimates, by the year 2000 there will be roughly 
18 million people with dementia in the world,about 
two-thirds of them Alzheimer victims. 
Treatment is in its infancy and as yet nothing 
seems to slow the sufferer’s inexorable mental decline. 
The disorder’s first stage may seem relatively benign. 
After all, most people as they age lose mental 
sharpness, misplace things, forget people’s names 
and suffer other minor mental lapses. From then on, 
however, it’s downhill all the way. “Alzheimer’s is like 
an insidious fog,” JB says, “barely noticeable until 
everything around has disappeared. After that it is no 
longer possible to believe that a world outside the 
fog exists.” 
As the disease progresses, the patient becomes 
dependent on others for help with all aspects of daily 
life. This care is usually provided by the immediate 
family and the period of dependency can last for 
many years. “Alzheimer sufferers are not always 
gentle,” JB notes, and caring for a loved one with 
Alzheimer’s disease has been described as calling for

A few months ago JB published a beautifully written

with the decline of someone to whom they are close. 
IM’s case is particularly heart-rending in view of what 
she had done before she began,as she put it,to sail into 
the darkness. She is Iris Murdoch, one of the century’s 
most gifted novelists writing in English and an author 
with a devoted readership worldwide (her works have 
been translated into 23 languages).Her husband,JB,is 
John Bayley, a noted literary critic and former Oxford 
professor.’ 
For over forty years Iris Murdoch had been engrossed 
in writing fiction and philosophy. In 27 novels published 
between 1954 and 1995, she had created a vivid world 
peopled by intelligent and intensely human figures whose 
exceptional capacities for feeling and thinking were tested 
in situations that were often macabre, comic and 
melodramatic. She also wrote about philosophy, including

a critical study of Sartre (1953) and Metaphysics asa 
GuidetoM orals (1992). She had created and carried 
the novels entirely in her head, planning them for 
months before effortlessly writing them down.N ow 
she no longer knows their titles. 
A voyage 
into darkness 
Bayley’s memoir plunges the reader into the 
world of sufferer and carer. Today Iris Murdoch 
can no longer talk coherently or remember where 
she is or has been. T he day begins and ends with the 
tussles of dressing (“most days a happy and comic 
business”) and undressing. Around ten in the 
morning it’s time for the Teletubbies,an animated 
cartoon show on children’s television, which Iris 
watches “with something approaching glee.” She 
is equally absorbed in sports programmes,although 
she does not know the play or the scores. When she 
twitters away incomprehensibly Bayley finds 
himself sustaining the illusion of a conversation by 
uttering meaningless sentences of his own. When 
they go out of doors she absently picks up stones 
and twigs and brings them home. Her only 
coherent phrase, which she repeats again and again, 
is: “When are we leaving?’ She has a prodigious 
appetite for sleep. It’s some kind of consolation that 
she does not seem aware of what she’s lost. “I'm 
grateful that there isn’t what you might call clear- 
eyed despair going on. There is a kind of animal 
trust in the person she is with.” Bayley is quite 
devoid of self-pity; his love for Murdoch shines 
from every sentence. He gets through the days by 
keeping busy. Jokes are important, the sillier the 
better to try to get a smile which “transforms her 
face, bringing it back to what it was, and with an 
added glow that can seem almost supernatural.”. 
He tries to take the short view of things, never 
looking beyond the next meal. Once he loses 
control and explodes into anger as Iris goes on 
meaninglessly watering the house plants. 
“Like being chained to a corpse, isn’t it?’ says 
the wife of a fellow sufferer. He disagrees,refusing 
to feel that Iris Murdoch’s individuality is absorbed 
into “the common symptoms of a clinical 
condition”. He accepts that eventually he will need 
outside help, but “Like someone who knows he 
cannot for much longer avoid going out into the 
cold I still shrink from the need for professional 
care. ..even the efforts of kind friends. All that is to 
come, but let us postpone it while we can.” 
Meanwhile the disease has oddly intensified 
their togetherness. For years they had each been 
engrossed in their own work, in a kind of conjugal 
solitude.“Now we are together for the first time. . 
.. Every day we are physically closer; and Iris’s little 
‘mouse cry’,as I think of it,signifying loneliness in 
the next room, the wish to be back beside me, seems 
less and less forlorn, more simple, more natural. 
She is not sailing into the dark: the voyage is over, 
and under the dark escort of Alzheimer’s she has 
arrived somewhere.So have 1.” [|

“When I was working, I liked having apprentices 
A and passing my skills on to young people,” says 
Henri Guerinot, a French cabinet-maker who 
regards his retirement as just another kind of activity. 
At 83, he is as enthusiastic as ever and still teaching his 
craft to youngsters between the ages of nine and 14. 
His passion has proved infectious. More than a 
decade ago, in the French city of Troyes, he was the first 
retired person to get involved in an association called 
“L’Outil en main” (“Let’s Pick Up Our Worktools”), 
which was set up to encourage contact between young 
people and retired craftworkers.T hrough it, the elderly 
can stay active and continue to feel useful. 
Today more than 100 elderly people are following 
Guerinot’s example and teaching children outside 
school hours such skills as carpentry, glass-making, 
stone-cutting, construction and plumbing. The 
experience,patience and wisdom of the old workers 
go well with the inquisitiveness, talent and 
awkwardness of the young people, all making for the 
kind of tender complicity familiar to grandparents 
  
and grandchildren. 
Strengthening ties between generations is also 
the goal of another French movement, 
“Flamboyance”, whose members are retired people 
who each year stage a series of cultural and sporting 
events (known as “Le printemps des générations” or 
“The Dawn of New Generations”) all over the country. 
The proceeds go towards helping the least fortunate 
young people to get a start in life. 
The amounts raised—between 5,000 francs 
($1,000) and 50,000 francs ($10,000) from each 
event—are modest but they can work wonders. 
Examples include a 17-year-old girl who was able to 
complete her training as a personal care-provider, 
which she had had to break off due to lack of money, 
another girl who got a computer so she could do 
secretarial work at home and a young man who had 
his driving school fees paid for so he could become a 
messenger. 
Last year some 15 jobs were created in this way for 
needy young people. Not a large number, but an

Eternal students 
come to the end of their working lives, but this does 
not mean that they no longer have any urge to 
learn. According to figures from the Paris-based 
International Association of Universities of the T hird 
Age (AIUTA), there are more than 1,700 senior citizens’ 
universities worldwide catering for these eternal 
students. 
Although their structures and management methods 
differ widely from one country to another, universities 
for the elderly usually share a desire to help older people 
play a full part in cultural and social life. T hey do not 
award degrees, and they do not require their students to 
have any particular qualification when they enroll. 
One successful example of this type of institution 
was set up at Shimizu, in Japan, in 1985. During the 
last academic year, it had 2,500 students. At this 
“university for voluntary students”, which has been 
awarded a prize by the Japanese government for “the 
valuable contribution it has made as an adult education 
At the age of 60 or thereabouts, many people establishment”, there is no age-limit for either students 
or teachers. The teachers are volunteers, as well as the 
students, enrolment fees are reasonable and there is 
ample opportunity to make new friends. 
Shimizu has one male student for every four 
females and the most common age bracket ranges 
between 60 and 70, although there is an increasing 
number of older students attending classes in dancing, 
drama, the humanities or manual work. 
The aim is to give old people the opportunity to 
study by providing them with knowledge enabling 
them to lead better, healthier, richer and happier 
lives. In the opinion of Dr Tak Kwan-Kong, a specialist 
in geriatrics and editor-in-chief of The Journal of the 
Hong Kong Geriatrics Society, “T his type of institution 
is something to be encouraged, especially nowadays 
when elderly people have often been given a negative 
image. Exercising the mind can maintain mental 
fitness, just as physical exercise can maintain physical 
fitness. An appropriate life-style, rather than drugs,

SeniorsSearch company to find the world’s oldest 
Internet surfer. At 96 years of age, Jason moves about 
the Net like a fish in water. “I have seen the birth of the 
automobile, airplane, telephone, radio and television. 
Now the computer and the Internet have opened a 
whole new world for my wife Theresa and myself 
that, God willing, we will continue to explore for 
many years to come”, says Dr. Grinnell, whose interest 
in computers began when he was 89. 
A retired Texas doctor, Jason Grinnell is by no 
means the only elderly person to use the computer for 
sending or receiving e-mail, shopping online or merely 
looking through pages on which there is no shortage 
of cookery recipes or advertisements for dream cruises. 
SeniorsSearch’s aims are clear from its slogan: “the only 
search directory exclusively for the over-50 age group”. 
Anybody over 50 can become a member free of charge 
and explore the sections on offer, which include 
antiques and collections, art galleries and museums, 
books or social clubs. 
SeniorNet, a non profit-making organization 
set up in California twelve years ago with the aim of 
teaching older people to use modern technologies, 
has another of the best-known homepages most 
In September 1998, Dr. Jason Grinnell was the widely consulted by this category of the public. 
With its 27,000 members, SeniorNet receives 
500,000 visits a month, most of them from surfer 
veterans in the United States and Canada with an 
average age of 68.Its annual budget stands at $1.5 
million,one-third of which comes from members’ 
subscriptions and the remaining two-thirds from 
advertisers and donations from foundations and 
companies, which have no hesitation in funding 
this type of venture, since “in exchange, they get 
good publicity and tax breaks,” explains Ann 
Wrixon,the organization’s executive director. 
Other sites choose to foster relations between 
generations. T his is the case of the French Cyberpapy 
site on which older people help youngsters with their 
homework—something they have done all their lives 
but can now do by computer. Created and funded by 
the Boulanger corporate foundation, it consists of a 
large electronic mailbox divided into seven theme 
areas—literature, history and geography, languages, 
philosophy, composition, mathematics and the 
physical sciences—to which pupils send in their 
questions. In practice, the older people, who do not 
give their names or occupations, reply within 24 
hours. The questions and answers are constantly 
monitored by a team of professionals. [|

philosophers are wise men who devote their lives 
to learning how to die and that philosophy, 
among other things, is a long and difficult learning 
process which teaches us to grow old and face up to 
the climactic moment of our lives. T here is nothing 
melancholy about this process of “learning to die”. On 
the contrary, it means that it is only towards the end 
of our days that we are really able to profit from life and 
confront the imminence of death with fortitude and 
determination and without despondency. In the minds 
of the ancients, living to a ripe old age offered not so 
much respect from society as a reassurance that they 
would pass on gently from the world of the living to the 
kingdom of the dead. 
The culture of Antiquity suggested that two 
forms of existence were worthy of emulation:that of 
heroes like Achilles who enjoy a short and action- 
packed life, and that of venerable elders who learn to 
lead quiet and secret inner lives in accordance with 
the ideal of Stoicism. In a way, it was impossible to 
envisage these patterns of individual behaviour in 
isolation from each other, and the models for living 
they offered were highlighted when the two were 
contrasted. As a result, our cultural tradition has for 
centuries made an almost religious cult of the two 
archetypes personified by the hero and the elder. 
According to the former, the hero’s bravery is a 
quality which makes it possible to confront the risks

and vicissitudes of life and which steels the character. 
The second conjures up an image of the experience 
and peace of mind which, so the Roman philosopher 
Seneca believed, only comes with old age, in other 
words when the desires of the flesh forsake us and the 
mind becomes detached from sensuality and soars in 
flight. To cut a long story short, the ancients felt that 
it was best to die either very young or very old, since 
old age, in spite of its disadvantages, was the age of 
reason in which the mind finally triumphs. 
However, we no longer live in the age of ancient 
Greece or the Renaissance or even of old-fashioned 
bourgeois society, which also fluctuated between 
the ideal of the hero and the culture of the patriarch. 
Ours is a society which has left traditional values 
behind and is dangerously inclined to offer an 
exclusively technological solution to all life’s 
problems. It’s not so much that we disregard the 
value of the experience or tradition which used to 
form a natural part of the knowledge of very old 
people as that we have learned that no wise person, 
however retentive or sharp their memory may be, 
can remember as much as a computer, as the 
champion chess-player Gary Kasparov discovered 
(although he, incidentally, is still regarded as being 
a young man). 
Enduring suffering and solitude 
Our collective ideal is machine-like, and we know 
that when machines grow old they are taken out of 
commission and dismantled and their parts recycled, 
or else they are sent to the scrapyard to be broken up. 
We do the same with our old people so that,although 
technology has succeeded in extending the limits of 
our useful lives as never before and in balancing our 
diet, and is gradually unravelling all the secrets of our 
bodies, it does not seem to have found a satisfactory 
answer to living in old age. The religion of modernity 
only worships youthful gods. Our world has come to 
be populated by splendid young people who are 
superficial and pampered and whose impulsive 
behaviour knows no bounds, and by growing 
numbers of old people who, as the French thinker 
Jean Baudrillard has observed, inhabit a kind of T hird 
World of existence. People with no future and painful 
memories of a past in which nobody is interested, the 
denizens of this Third World are condemned to live in 
a mundane present dedicated to generating profits 
for the powerful cosmetics and mass tourism 
industries and for the pension and insurance system 
that manages workers’savings. No matter how much 
technology may have improved their lot, the status of 
old people bears no resemblance to the remedy for all 
ills preached by the ancient Stoics. The onset of old 
age not only brings the threat of sufferings that were 
not known in the past, such as Alzheimer’s disease, but 
is also compounded by such misfortunes as solitude, 
to which there is no easy answer. Only by adopting a 
new Stoicism, a rule for living which teaches us how 
to grow old and die, as it did in the past, shall we be 
able to prevent the greater life expectancy due to 
technical progress from bringing new and painful 
experiences in its wake. |

### 114718: Debt relief: a creditable solution?

Debt relief: 
a creditable solut 
Angela Travis 
The suffering caused 
by Hurricane Mitch and 
the financial tempests 
rattling the global 
economy bring new 
reasons to lighten the 
debt of the poorest 
countries 
The devastation wrought by 
| Hurricane Mitch in November was 
horrific. In three days, the hurricane 
wiped out 20 years of development in the 
region, according to UN agencies, leaving 
thousands of people dead and reportedly 
about three million homeless. 
But as governments and international 
organizations tried to mobilize funds for 
relief efforts, another debate reared its head: 
should Nicaragua and Honduras, both low 
income, heavily indebted countries badly hit 
by Hurricane Mitch, continue to pay a total 
of $2 million a day in debt repayments— 
money which could provide temporary 
housing for 800,000 people? 
The British Secretary of State for 
International Development, Clare Short, 
stated early on that debt relief was “an 
irrelevance” when the priority lay in 
avoiding cholera and “pulling people out 
of the mud”. But a few days later 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon 
Brown called on all creditors to support a 
two-year moratorium on debt service

payments. 
This shift in thinking reflects a growing 
realization as to just how bad things have 
gotten for the world’s poorest nations. Since 
at least the mid-1990s, a few developing 
countries have simply stopped servicing a 
large portion of their debts—that is paying 
the interest and principal on loans. The 
reason is simple: their governments are 
effectively bankrupt. Mozambique and 
Nicaragua are only able to pay a third of 
their scheduled debt service (the amount 
of repayments on all loans). For Nicaragua, 
this fraction amounts to $221 million a 
year—three times that which the 
government spends on health. 
Bankrupt 
states 
By 1996, it was clear even to the world’s 
major creditors that something had to be 
done. When middle or high income 
countries like Brazil, Jordan or Russia have 
run into problems managing their debts, 
the standard approach has been to 
reschedule or push back their service 
payments through agreements generally 
brokered by multilateral organizations like 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
or, in the case of commercial lending, by 
the Paris Club, an informal group of 
creditor governments with a permanent 
secretariat in the French Treasury. 
But loan rescheduling cannot solve the 
problems of the poorest countries. Their 
financial crises have been so extreme that 
they generally manage to service just half of 
their total debts. 
The World Bank proposed the HIPC 
(Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) 
Initiative in 1996 (see box). The aim was 
to enable poor countries to get a more 
secure financial footing. T his was “good 
news for the poor,” according to the bank 
president, James Wolfensohn. “This 
initiative is a breakthrough .. . It deals with 
debt in a comprehensive way to give 
countries the possibility of exiting from 
unsustainable debt.” 
Under the HIPC Initiative, creditors 
agree to share the burden of cutting debts 
including for, the first time, those 
stemming from World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
loans. The World Bank determines the 
“sustainable”level at which a country can

manage a debt and the creditors cut their 
portions respectively. A list of 41 countries 
has been drawn up, identifying when and 
how much debt relief should be expected. 
It is estimated that another 25 countries 
will eventually be added to the list. 
However, the plan looks better on paper 
than in practice. In short, the HIPC 
initiative delivers too little, too late, 
according to critics and non-governmental 
organizations campaigning for Third World 
debt relief. Only two countries, Uganda 
and Bolivia, have had their debts lightened, 
while another five are slated for assistance 
in 1999. Others like Tanzania and Ethiopia 
cannot expect anything until 2002. 
In understanding the HIPC 
shortcomings, it isimportant to remember 
that many of the poorest countries have 
long been paying less than half the 
scheduled debt service.It’s a bit like having 
two loans, but only being able to pay 
interest on the second one. If the bank 
writes off the first loan, your bank balance 
will look better, but your payments on the 
second loan continue, so you do not gain 
any additional benefits. 
Consider the case of Uganda, the first 
country to benefit from HIPC .Under the

ETHICS 
initiative, its total debt has been reduced 
by just 11 per cent. T he story is the same for 
Mozambique, due to receive relief in June 
1999. Although the country’s total debt 
(about $5.8 billion in 1996) will drop by 
$1.4 billion, much of this is 
“unrecoverable” debt—meaning debt the 
government wasn’t expected to repay 
regardless of HIPC. 
Mozambique’s debt service will only 
fall from $112 million a year to $100 
million, a saving equivalent to about 80 
cents per capita. 
While reducing total debt is important 
to keep a country’s books looking healthy, 
the key to finding new resources to invest in 
education or health services, for example, 
lies in cutting those debts that countries 
actually service and not those considered 
unrecoverable. 
For Jean-Louis Sarbib, World Bank vice 
pOresident for Africa, HIPC is “not really 
about wiping off debt . . . It’s just making 
sure that these countries can remain good 
credit risks. . . . The idea of HIPC is in fact 
to allow you to continue to be a good 
financial citizen of the world community.” 
But why not simply write off the debts 
and service payments to offer a fresh start to 
poor countries? G. Gondwe, Deputy 
Director of the IMF’s African Department 
outlined some key concerns in the Financial 
Times in August 1998: “Who would lend 
again to recipients of such cancellation? 
What guarantee is there that the money 
former Zaire were all grateful recipients of 
loans from the West. Nicaragua and 
Mozambique were equally well supported 
by the former Soviet Union. Very little 
attention was paid to how the money was 
used or abused. 
“One-fifth of all developing country 
debt consists of loans given to prop up 
compliant dictators,” insists Joseph 
Hanlon, policy officer with the Jubilee 2000 
Coalition, which regroups NGOs, 
grassroots movements and trade unions in 
40 countries to push for Third World debt 
relief. “But when the dictators fall, it is 
expected that their democratically elected 
successors should repay those debts. 
Lenders must take a much greater share of 
the responsibility and accept the losses.” 
Popular pressure 
for debt cancellation 
There is another key question: who will 
benefit from debt relief?T here is a genuine 
concern that blanket debt relief will not be 
used to reduce poverty and improve 
education or sanitation systems. 
Democracy is still young in many 
developing countries. Many don’t have 
official watchdogs or independent media 
strong enough to examine government 
policy. 
For the World Bank, the solution lies in 
linking debt relief to strict adherence to 
IMF structural adjustment policies. 
Tanzania and Ethiopia, for example, have

have had their debt burden lightened, while 
another five are slated for assistance in

saved would be put to effective use?’ 
Gondwe is referring to the familiar 
argument of moral hazard: writing off debts 
and service payments will reduce the 
incentive to better manage finances in the 
future and may worsen already poor credit 
ratings. This argument is valid when loans 
have been made for sound economic 
investments. But what about money loaned 
not primarily for investment reasons, but 
rather for political reasons to win allies or to 
increase foreign exports? 
There is no scarcity of cases of 
politically motivated lending. Presidents 
Marcos of the Philippines, Suharto of 
Indonesia and Mobutu Sese Seko of the 
suffered from delays in relief because they 
did not make the adjustments deemed 
necessary. But does such macro-economic 
adjustment ensure that the poor will 
benefit? 
Oxfam argues that additional “human” 
measures must be put in place. The British 
NGO proposes that for every dollar saved 
through debt relief, the government spends 
an equivalent amount on health, education 
and sanitation. Although criticized for 
encroaching on the decision-making power 
of governments, this approach has the 
advantage of reassuring creditors that debt 
relief will not be wasted. 
For the time being, this kind of human

### 114718: Debt relief: a creditable solution?

development perspective is essentially 
ignored by creditors. However, the World 
Bank has agreed to review the HIPC 
Initiative this year. Instead of waiting for 
any major changes, the governments of 
Norway, Finland and Japan have decided to 
begin canceling debts independently. 
Two factors help explain this 
momentum. First, popular pressure is 
growing. In May 1998, for example, 70,000 
people formed a human chain around the 
leaders attending the G8 summit in 
Birmingham (UK). Secondly, the prospect 
of global economic recession is forcing 
creditors to change their way of thinking. 
The financial crashes in East Asia and 
Russia sent shock waves around the 
international financial community. The 
frantic bailouts of South Korea, Thailand, 
ETHICS 
Indonesia and Russia have pressed the IMF 
to come to the rescue with over $140 billion 
in finance. 
The current climate of recession has 
highlighted the reasons for raising the calls 
for poor country debt relief. It is difficult to 
believe claims made by creditors that they 
cannot afford further debt relief. The HIPC 
Initiative for the poorest would cost just $8 
billion—a pittance compared to the billions 
allocated to push back the debt payments of 
middle income countries. Japan, for 
example, which is far deeper in recession 
than European or North American 
countries, has managed to cancel $500 
million worth of debts owed by developing 
countries. 
Canceling effectively unpayable debts 
owed by the poorest countries may turn out 
to be a sensible policy for all creditors. As 
well as the strong moral argument for debt 
relief, there could be sound financial 
 
A multi-speed road to rescue 
Even before Hurricane Mitch, Nicaragua 
and Honduras applied for debt relief through 
the HIPC Initiative. A decision for Nicaragua is 
expected within months, says Jeff Katz, principal 
economist for the initiative, while “Honduras’ 
qualifying track record was a little more 
ambiguous, so we will have to see.” 
Katz points out that the “special needs” of 
countries facing post-conflict situations are 
already recognized. “Post-disaster situations 
present many of the same issues. One could 
argue—even more than in a post-conflict 
situation—that the country concerned is not 
responsible for a disaster occurring,” he says. 
It can take up to six years for a country to 
receive debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. 
The relief should come only after a country 
works out a structural adjustment programme 
with the World Bank and IMF and then 
demonstrates that it can adhere to those 
policies. At the end of this period, the country 
could see its loans reduced if principal and 
interest payments exceed limits considered 
unsustainable. For example, debt service 
charges are considered unmanageable if they 
amount to more than 20 per cent of the value 
of a country’s annual exports. 
However, HIPC relief can be quicker for 
countries that demonstrate both need and 
good behaviour. For example, as of November 
1998, U ganda and Bolivia were receiving debt 
relief because of their relatively strong track 
records in adhering to structural adjustment 
policies. Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Guyana, 
Mali and Mozambique are now slated for 
assistance. T he total amount of debt reductions 
already agreed is worth about six billion dollars 
in terms of the nominal value of principal and 
interest payments originally due. 
Of course, a lot of these debts were not 
going to be paid anyway. But the beauty of 
HIPC, says Katz, is that it cleans up the 
accounting books of these countries so that 
they can continue to receive international 
assistance instead of being forced to rely on 
high interest commercial loans. “Debt relief 
is just part of the financial picture in reducing 
poverty and promoting sustainable 
development,” he says. “A larger part for 
most countries will be new grants and new 
flows of varying concessional resources.” 
Critics maintain that relatively little has 
been done to help poor countries manage 
their debts in comparison to the billions of 
dollars mobilized by the international 
community to rescue middle and high income 
countries, such as during the Asian crisis. 
“These are very different kinds of money,” says 
Katz. “At theWorld Bank, we have the capital 
base which enables us to relatively easily and 
quickly borrow money to re-lend to South 
Korea. But in the case of a poor country, the 
money that we make available to them is not 
on commercial terms. It is very highly 
concessional [minimal service charges]. T hat 
money is essentially tax-payers’ money, which 
means that it is very hard to mobilize” HH

Outlawing 
excision 
veral African countries have banned the 
Sor ritual of excision. The latest is Cote 
d’Ivoire, where a bill is expected to go before 
parliament early this year 
Women’s campaigners have welcomed the 
move. Such mutilations often involve cutting the 
clitoris, and sometimesthe labia, with dirty razor 
blades or broken glass and frequently lead to 
death. There are no figures because such deaths 
are usually hidden, or blamed on something else. 
If the law gets passed, anyone w ho excises a 
female may be jailed up to five years and fined 
$4,000.However, the legislation will be difficult 
to apply. Non-excised women are considered 
incomplete, and more likely to have lovers 
before marriage, a deterrent for prospective 
husbands. “ It’s part of the culture, and parents 
are ashamed when their little girls are not 
excised,” says Genevieve Bro-Grebe president 
of the Ivoirian Network of Women’s 
Organizations. “And it makes a lot of money for 
those who practice excision.It’s a big feast, a 
big event for society as a whole.” 
As Guei Bah Koné, a woman who used to 
excise girls but decided to stop after working 
with women’s groups, explains, “during the 
excision period in December, | could excise up to 
20 girls a day. In return their parents gave me 
sheep, cows, and money. Now | earn nothing.” 
Another stumbling block is illiteracy:68 per 
cent of Cote d’lvoire’s women can’t read 
new spapersinforming them of their new rights. 
So the task of spreading the message has been 
left to NGOs, like the Ivoirian Association for 
the Defence of Women (AIDF).Constance Yai, 
the AIDF president, has been traveling the 
country explaining the dangers of excision and 
the related HIV risks. She says many people 
mistakenly think excision is required under 
Islamic law. 
Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Guinea, and Ghana 
have all adopted law sbanning excision, but it is 
still widely carried out.As in Cote D'Ivoire, half 
the women in Guinea are excised. In Ghana, 
where about 20 per cent of women are excised, 
several women were recently tried and 
sentenced for continuing their mutilation trade.

more than half the world’s 25,000 
museums started up during the past 50 
years. Even the idea of what a museum 
should be has changed considerably and 
given rise to a broad range of variations. 
Museums were invented at the end of 
the 19th century as places to gather 
together and preserve the finest examples of 
human ingenuity and present them to the 
public. Early museums often lacked the 
resources to look after their collections

became dull, grey places which were 
cramped and increasingly dusty. 
These days greyness is rare. In fact, I 
would divide museums into seven main 
categories and associate each one with a 
colour: orange for “interpretative” 
museums, green for those with an 
ecological approach, yellow for 
community-centred museums, blue for 
those which aim to share knowledge, gold 
for museums which go in for the 
spectacular, silver for business-oriented 
museums and mauve for museums of 
remembrance. 
Interpretation—a watershed 
in museum history 
The interpretative movement began in 
the 1950s in US national parks such as the 
Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and the 
Florida Everglades and spread throughout 
the English-speaking world, from Canada 
to Australia via the United Kingdom, 
reaching as far as English-speaking 
countries in Africa. 
Interpretation marks a watershed in the 
history of museums. It gives priority to a 
subject or theme rather than the exhibits 
themselves, which are considered as 
evidence from the past and not as the 
centre of attention. Interpretation means 
stimulating and surprising people, and 
challenging accepted ideas, without turning 
the museum into a classroom. Visitors are 
encouraged to refer to their own 
experiences, not just straight scientific 
knowledge,and to relate on equal terms to 
the heritage they are learning about. 
In addition to national parks, hundreds 
of historic spots around the world have 
chosen this interpretative approach. Among 
them are Canada’s Louisbourg Fortress 
and, in the United States, the town of 
Salem and the battlefields of the War of 
Independence. Since the late 1970s, this 


### 114719: Museums hoist their new colours

René Rivard* 
trend has involved new ways of presenting 
things based on the experience of the visit 
itself. Visitors explore the ambience of a 
place steeped in history and see what they 
can learn from it and what ideas it gives 
them.Interpretation confronts people with 
questions,theories and new perceptions of 
history. The settlement of the West in the 
United States, the slave trade and 
colonialism, for example, are put in 
perspective. Armed with this kind of critical 
approach, visitors come up with their own 
interpretations of the things they are 
presented with. 
In Quebec, museums which take an 
interpretative approach have experimented 
a lot with the role of interpreter and critic 
and offer their visitors quite original places 
and experiences. T he Chateauguay Battle 
Centre (commemorating Canada’s defeat 
of an American invasion in 1812) has 
chosen to question the part played by 
heroes in our societies. The museum at 
Trois-Pistoles encourages discussion about 
the intensive whaling carried out by the 
Basques in the estuary of the St.Lawrence 
river in the 16th century. 
A green 
revolution 
In the 1970s, the popularization of 
museums was taken further with the 
development of the ecomuseum concept 
by Georges Henri Riviere, an imaginative 
French museologist who took a new look at 
the three basic components of a museum— 
the building, the collections housed in it 
and the people who come to see them.He 
favoured replacing buildings as the site of 
museums with a wider setting in which 
typologically classified collections would

be replaced by examples of the natural and 
cultural heritage which could be observed 
in their normal environment. The people 
who visited such museums, he thought, 
should be people who lived locally and were 
both users and preservers of the heritage 
that was on display. 
In Europe and North America, there 
has been extensive experimentation with 
Riviere’s concept of 
decompartmentalization. Examples 
include the cultural park in Molinos 
(Aragon), Spain, the Proud World House 
(showing labour conditions) in Montreal 
(Canada) and, in France, the ecomuseums 
of Margeride (rural life) in the Auvergne 
and on the isle of Ouessant (the marine 
environment). 
Militant 
museums 
The ecomuseum movement is mainly 
a rural one, but urban variants of 
ecomuseums sprang up as needy districts 
in big American cities awoke in the 1970s 
and 1980s. Neighbourhood museums 
were opened in poor areas of New York, 
Washington D.C., Chicago, Tucson and 
other cities. They were often in former 
public places, ordinary houses or sheds, 
and illustrated local everyday cultures, 
from an ethnic, working-class or crafts 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
standpoint. 
These new kinds of museums often 
spurred existing ones to reconsider their 
place in the city and in society at large. 
Several conventional museums, such as the 
Children’s Museum in Indianapolis and 
the New York City Museum, began 
to those of European ecomuseums, 
Mexico’s community museums and the 
neighbourhood museums of the United 
States and South Africa. 
The second trend, knowledge-sharing, 
is found particularly in natural science and 
science and technology museums which 
The last two decades have been marked by 
profound economic changes and upheavals. 
In a number of countries, budgets for 
culture and museums have been cut back 
“outreach” activities,staging exhibitions in 
streets,suburbs and poor neighbourhoods 
on themes including drugs, violence and 
sexually-transmitted diseases. 
In the same area as the closely-linked 
yellow and blue categories are two other 
trends which have developed in several 
parts of the world. The first, which 
appeared in the mid-1980s, might be 
called a “militant” trend, where the 
museum becomes an instrument of 
community development by spreading 
and sharing its resources. Several 
museums in the Sahel countries of Niger, 
Burkina Faso and Mali have chosen this 
approach involving exhibits from animist 
culture. T heir aims and actions are similar 
seek to stimulate interest in science and to 
point young people towards scientific 
careers. There are now many technology 
museums and hundreds of science centres

countries but also in India and the Far East, 
notably China, Japan and Indonesia.

for running costs and expansion by staging 
major events and adopting the profit- 
oriented approach of the 1980s and 1990s. 
Art museums have led the field, 
through large exhibitions billed as 
exclusives or “first-evers”. The trend began 
with the Tutankhamen exhibition in the 
early 1970s. All the resources of advertising 
and public relations are used to promote 
presentations of an artist’s new works, of 
rarely-seen private or museum collections, 
unique treasures or exotic or extraordinary 
objects. These blockbuster shows cost a 
fortune to organize. T heir purpose is to 
raise large amounts of cash to enable 
museums to repay their debts and put on 
new exhibitions. Nowadays museum 
curators are often hired for their ability to 
raise money or to stage shows of this kind, 
hopefully to turn a profit. 
This trend is growing as public grants 
for museums and cultural bodies diminish. 
The appearance of museum boutiques to 
boost takings is also part of this business 
strategy. 
Mourning 
and remembrance 
A museum can also be an instrument 
whereby society can mourn a lost golden 
age and at the same time look directly at 
the present and the future. Through the 
prism of collected and exhibited objects, 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
historical events and trends can be seen 
in a perspective uncluttered with morbid 
nostalgia. 
The Scandinavians have long used 
museums for this purpose.A century ago, 
the Swedes opened the first open-air 
museum (skansen) in Stockholm to 
remember their traditional farming culture. 
They and the Norwegians are now opening 
labour museums and industrial 
ecomuseums to solemnly bury their 
glorious working-class and trade union 
history, to mark the decline or death of their 
major heavy industries and promote the 
development of modern technology. 
Over the past 15 years, new museums 
of this kind have sprung up in many places 
to commemorate atrocities and major 
disasters that are engraved in the collective 
memory. Numerous institutions have 
opened in North America, Europe and 
Israel, for example, to mark the Holocaust, 
the Viet Nam war and other relatively 
recent human tragedies. 
In France, many recently opened 
museums, such as the Memorial museums 
at Caen and Péronne and a number of 
Resistance museums, attempt to come to 
terms with the terrible memories of two 
world wars. The same kind of thing is 
happening in Britain and the rest of 
Europe. Other museums have been set up 
to commemorate natural disasters, such as 
great floods, volcanic eruptions and 
earthquakes. These funerary monuments 
New York's Chinatown museum 
New York’s Chinatown History 
Museum looks at the contribution of 
Chinese and other people, including 
tourists, to the growth of this Manhattan 
neighbourhood. It is a place of 
remembrance and dialogue. 
The museum, which opened in 1990, is 
a kind of laboratory where exhibitions and 
activities are focused entirely on dialogue 
between communities. Those who run it 
keep their fingers on the pulse of 
neighbourhood problems and discuss with 
the public—Chinese, New Yorkers or 
tourists—how they might be solved. 
Interactive exhibitions are held to improve 
the lives of temporary or permanent local 
residents. The museum’s contents raise 
many questions on subjects ranging from 
housing and demographic issues to the 
principles of respect and gratitude, and 
Chinese culture. 
The museum, which is split into several 
locations, uses unorthodox methods. It acts 
as a kind of forum,stimulating discussion, 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
helping visitors in their dealings with the 
authorities, highlighting little-known 
historical facts and demolishing, with help 
from the visitors, prejudices and myths that 
die hard,e.g.that Chinese are illegal aliens 
only qualified to work in restaurants and 
laundries, and that they lead secretive and 
therefore shady lives. The museum also 
tries to act as an intermediary between 
citizens and officialdom with the aim of 
defending the poorest people. 
The Chinatown Museum keeps links 
with the past alive, but it is mainly 
concerned with the neighbourhood as it 
is today and with its future. Through 
discussion, it reckons it has carved out a 
role for itself that had hitherto been 
neglected. By its openness, it invites all 
New Yorkers and visitors to understand 
and love a living neighbourhood which is 
still growing.

30 sites added to 
World Heritage 
List 
U NEsco’s World Heritage Committee, which 
met in Kyoto from 30 November to 2 
December 1998, added 30 new sites (three 
“natural” sites and 14 “cultural” sites) to the 
World Heritage List, bringing the number of 
listed sites of “ exceptional universal value” to 
582 in 114 countries, including tw 0 newcomers, 
Belgium and the Solomon Islands 
The committee's choice confirmsits intention 
to preserve items of the relatively recent 
heritage. After Vélklingen ironworks (Germany, 
added in 1994) and Verla groundwood and 
board mill (Fnland,1996), three new industrial 
siteswere chosen: Austria’s Semmering railway; 
the four hydraulic lifts on Belgium’s Canal du 
Centre; and the D.F Wouda Steam Pumping 
Station in the Netherlands 
The other new sites, with their countries are 
as follows: Belgium: Flemish Béguinages; La 
Grand-Place, Brussels. Bolivia: the Fort of 
Samaipata. China: the Summer Palace, an 
imperial garden in Beijing; the Temple of 
Heaven,an imperial sacrificial altar in Beijing. 
Cyprus:  Choirokoitia. Czech Republic: 
Holasovice historical village reservation; 
gardens and castle at Kromeriz. France:routes 
of Santiago de Compostela; historic site of Lyon.

Can papers 
net a profit? 
CONNEXIONS 
More and more newspapers and periodicals 
are going online. How is electronic technology affecting the production 
and consumption of the printed word? 
uncertainties of the Internet, one of 
those raising the most speculation 
centres on its impact on the production, 
distribution and consumption of information 
and news. In a recent report on the future of 
the printed press in a digital world, Dutch 
media analyst Monique van Dusseldorp notes 
that “Newspapers as carriers of content have 
had to yield various functions in the past 
century to radio and television services,and 
now there are other categories of information 
that might migrate, this time to the net. . .. 
Unexpected competitors such as search 
engines and free homepage services, as well as 
the online services of television stations, now 
fight in the same arena for the user’s attention 
and the limited advertising money available.” 
The fact is that the media cannot ignore 
the fast and furious pace with which use of 
the Internet is growing. At a conference on 
the electronic press held in Lyon,France,in 
October 1998, Randy Bennet, of the 
Newspaper Association of America (NAA), 
said that “The Internet market is expected 
to increase from around 150 million users 
worldwide today to almost 300 million by 
the year 2001.” Surveys conducted by the 
American company Forrester Research 
forecast that worldwide online expenditure 
on advertising will rise from almost $2 
billion today to about $15 billion in 2003. 
“The numbers tell us that the Internet will 
continue to develop as a mass medium, 
that advertisers will increasingly shift dollars 
to this medium and that traditional media 
will have to figure out their role in this new 
space,” Bennet said. Miguel Angel 
Of all the attractions, possibilities and Bastanier, director of international relations 
with the Spanish daily El Pais, pointed out 
that “every newspaper will have to be on the 
Internet as a service to its public and as a 
means of self-promotion. It cannot run the 
risk of seeing its readers obtain this service 
from its competitors.” 
In fact, the written press has turned to the 
Internet in order to stay competitive with the 
other online media. American Journalism 
magazine stated recently that there are 3,622 
digital newspapers worldwide. A year ago, 
there were only some 900 outside the United 
States, as against 1,563 in 1998, largely as a 
result of the increasing number in Canada, the 
United Kingdom, Norway, Brazil and 
Germany. Yet, in spite of all the effort and 
investment, not a single online newspaper 
can be considered profitable. 
The Wall Street Journal: 
an eloquent exception 
One of the main dilemmas editors are 
trying to resolve lies in switching from 
newsprint to the computer screen and in 
making money without replacing the original 
medium, in other words without readers 
giving up the traditional format and changing 
over permanently to the electronic version. 
“The important thing is not so much 
going on the Internet as staying on it 
without losing money on the printed 
version,” says André Jaunin, founder and 
manager of Edicom, the Internet site of 
the Swiss group Edipresse, which publishes 
a number of newspapers and magazines 
including Le Matin, Tribune de Genéve, Bilan 
and Optima. “The idea is not to display all

the contents of the printed version,” he 
says. “We consider that it is absurd to offer 
the newspaper we are selling on the streets 
free of charge on the Web. Our electronic 
publication is different from the printed 
version. The news items it contains are brief 
and are updated every ten minutes. T hey are 
designed to be expanded in the following 
day’s printed edition.” However, hard 
information is not enough. The new 
technologies have to be used to keep 
Internet readers interested. Some of the 
approaches which the electronic press can 
offer to please the public and advertisers 
include personalized services, free e-mail, 
interactive articles and opportunities to 
swap ideas via chat forums. 
In Bennet’s view, “the key to success 
with any new medium is a commonsense 
approach to serving the needs of consumers 
and advertisers, aided by technology, but 
not driven by it.” 
Simon Waldman, the Internet editor of the 
English daily newspaper The Guardian, 
described his efforts to create new products 
of interest to its readers. “We have designed a 
space on our Web page which presents cricket 
matches in real time, for example,” he said, 
“and this has been extremely successful.” El 
Pais Digital, the leading light of the Spanish 
electronic press with 50,000 hits a day in 
October 1998, had a similar success with its 
direct transmission of chess matches, which 
are particularly popular with Spaniards. 
In terms of profitability, although there is 
no universal model or magic formula, the 
newspapers which have gone onto the Net try 
to survive primarily through subscriptions, »

advertising and electronic trading. However, 
most of them agree that surfers, who are 
nomadic by nature and are constantly 
searching, are not prepared to pay a provider 
to obtain their information, unless it is vital 
and can only be found on the Internet,which 
1s seldom the case. Perhaps one of the most 
eloquent exceptions is the authoritative 
financial newspaper The Wall Street Journal, 
which has more than 250,000 subscribers, 
two-thirds of whom pay to receive only the 
digital version of the publication which 
nevertheless does not turn a profit. A large 
number of the electronic newspapers and 
news bulletins in the United States which 
had adopted the subscription method know 
all about this. T hey are backtracking and are 
trying to attract as many visitors as possible in 
order to sell advertising space. T he free digital 
version of El Pais obtains its income basically 
from advertising, from which it hopes to 
make some $700,000 in 1998. M aril Ruiz de 
Elvira, who is in charge of the electronic 
edition, explains that plans are being made for 
new strategies involving electronic trading, 
consultation of archives and other paid 
products and services. André Jaunin points out 
that, in addition to advertising, the main 
sources of income from Edipresse’s Internet 
site are electronic sales of travel bookings, 
wine, books and music. 
Although the Internet clearly offers 
newspapers the opportunity to achieve 
immediate global reach and to compete 
with a wide range of sources, it also obliges 
them to keep on updating their content, 
thus leaving very little time for checking. 
This poses another dilemma: should they be 
the first or the most reliable purveyor of the 
news? Digital newspapers exposed to 
CONNEXIONS 
financial pressure to succeed in this hard- 
fought market may, out of the desire to be 
first, fall into the temptation of transmitting 
unchecked information, neglecting the 
accuracy they have traditionally attached to 
information-gathering. 
The virtually limitless amassing of 
information from a wide range of sources on 
the Internet may also give rise to a welter of 
confusion. This makes the traditional 
newspapers’ task of rigorous selection and 
objectivity even more valuable. Randy Bennet 
believes that consumer behaviour may change 
as new choices and capabilities emerge, but 
that the need to ensure that information is 
accurate, to give an overview of events and to 
provide ready access will remain unaffected. 
It is for this reason that newspapers will focus 
on the individual and translate online the 
trust they have acquired over the years. 
Will newsprint sink in the digital sea? 
Some of the predictions made are out of 
touch with reality. Bastenier forecasts that 
most newspapers will eventually disappear 
and that “the only survivors will be 
heavyweights with a sense of perspective, 
such as Le Monde or El Pais, or very small 
provincial papers which are close to their 
readership and largely provide information 
about and for a particular community. 
However, I would not let the computer 
screen be a substitute for the pleasure I get 
from reading news on paper, where I can go 
through the pages as I please, leaving part 
of the paper for later on.” Although the last 
word has not yet been written on the 
subject, it is quite clear that nothing will ever 
be the same in the world of information 
since the coming of the Internet. [|

tis a university but has no student body, faculty or campus in the traditional sense. The “faculty” of 
the United Nations University (UNU) is its worldwide network of scholars and its “students” are 
mainly young researchers and other professionals from developing countries who receive postgraduate 
training. 
In 1969, following a proposal by the then Secretary-General U Thant, the United Nations 
recommended that a new type of academic institution was needed to promote scholarly international 
and scientific co-operation to help solve urgent global problems. Sx years later UNU opened its doors. 
UNU’s academic work is currently carried out at its Tokyo centre and by five research and training 
centres and three programmes located in various parts of the world.Current priority areas of concern 
are development economics research, new technologies, natural resources management, biotechnology 
and the environment. A leadership academy opened in 1995 seeks to enhance the skills of young 
future leaders Soon to start is an internship programme for postgraduate students and working people

Mobile 
psychology 
t's easy to spot brand new owners of mobile 
phones from a distance. Walking down the 
street they grin like children who have just 
unwrapped the toy of their dreams. And they 
practically shout into the receiver, as if they 
have trouble imagining that their voices can be 
heard over such a tiny device. They are 
experiencing a thrilling sense of freedom. In the 
wink of an eye they can bein touch with anyone 
whenever and wherever they please. 
It took a century for the fixed telephone to 
become a commonplace feature of everyday 
life in Western societies; it took a decade for 
the mobile phone to spread throughout the 
countries of both North and South. According to 
forecasts, the number of subscribers to one or 
another of the world’s radiotelephony services 
is expected to climb from today’s 275 million 
or so to 530 million by 2003. Right now the 
Scandinavian countries are in the lead. The 
subscription rate is 53 per cent in Finland, 47 per 
cent in Sweden and 44.15 per cent in Norway, 
followed by Japan (34.5 per cent),ltaly (30 per 
cent) and the United States (24 per cent). 
Like eyeglasses and wristwatches, the mobile 
phone “ has joined the small circle of items that, 
with astonishing speed, have become an 
extension of the human body,” wrote 
sociologist Jean-Claude Kaufmann in France's 
Le Monde newspaper. The mobile 
simultaneously reflects the changes of our times 
and speeds them up. It allows users to mix the 
professional personal and social areas of their 
lives at any moment. It responds to the 
pervasive sense of urgency in modern societies, 
bestows the gift of ubiquity and, say 
sociologists and psychiatrists, reduces the 
anxiety caused by absence and loneliness. 
But the portable phone is also having an 
impact on social behaviour. The sound of its ring 
is increasingly perceived as an annoyance in 
public places such as restaurants, cinemas, 
museums and trains, which are widely regarded 
as havens of relaxation where people can enjoy 
a brief respite from the fast and furious rhythm of 
modern life. And they create new dilemmas for 
users: when should they leave the phone on or 
off and to whom should they give their number? 
Do they really want their boss, mother, boyfriend 
or girlfriend to be able to reach them anywhere, 
anytime? The opening pages of the handbook of 
mobile psychology are only now starting to be 
written. [|

### 114721: Writers bloc to defend their rights

Writers bloc to defend 
     
  
authors around the world have been 
clamouring for protection of their 
copyrights. However, this has resulted in 
an increasingly tough battle with publishers 
who want writers to sign a contract giving 
away all rights,including electronic. 
Until a few years ago, authors and 
journalists may not have bothered to scan 
through their work contracts with regard 
to copyrights. In fact,many magazines did 
not even send contracts to authors. Now 
both sides are careful about the mention of 
“copyrights” in the contract for reuse of 
articles and other creative work in Internet 
and electronic database systems. 
Authors argue that print publishing is a 
one-time event bringing in one set of 
revenues, including advertisements. On the 
other hand, materials in electronic 
publications can be used repeatedly, each 
time potentially generating new 
advertisement revenues. “So we tell authors 
that it’s a big mistake to grant permanent 
rights for a one-time fee,” says Dan 
Carlinsky, vice president of the American 
Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA), 
New York. 
While some publishers are ready to pay, 
others maintain that once authors cede 
their rights they cannot claim additional 
payments for reuse of their material. In a 
case filed in 1993, a group of freelancers in 
New York challenged publishers and 
electronic reusers of published work, 
claiming copyright infringement. The case,

s 
better known as “Tasini Vs The New York 
Times”, attracted widespread attention as 
this was the first new media copyright case 
of its sort in the United States. In 1997, a 
lower court ruled in favour of the 
publishers,saying the existing US copyright 
law allowed the publishers to reuse 
contributions “in any revision of that 
collection.” The case has now moved to the 
appeals court. 
“The present US copyright law does 
not state explicitly anything about 
electronic rights. Courts have just begun to 
consider writers’ claims and there are 
demands to include electronic rights in the 
existing law,” says Carlinsky. 
On the other side of the Atlantic, 
though there are no specific regulations as 
yet governing the use of journalistic 
material in the electronic media, journalists 
and authors in many Western European 
and Scandinavian countries have reached 
partial or full agreements with publishers 
over copyrights and the Internet. 
Copyright law 
that benefits authors 
“T he existing European authors’ rights 
law is sufficient to handle the pay dispute 
between writers and publishers in 
electronic publishing. However, the system 
is different in Anglo-Saxon law,” says 
Renate Schroeder, of the Brussels-based 
European Federation of Journalists. 
The copyright law generally followed in 
Scandinavian countries, as well as in France 
and Germany, benefits the authors. When 
material is used again in electronic 
publishing, authors have the right to be 
consulted as to where and how it is used 
and to receive extra payment. For example, 
their rights 
Print journalists are calling-usually in vain-for 
additional payment when their articles are 
reused in the electronic media 
the leading French daily Le M onde entered 
into a two-year agreement with its staff in 
1996 on electronic rights. From its annual 
earnings through electronic publications, 
it pays a percentage of its revenue from 
online editions and CD-ROM to all its staff 
members, whether or not their work has 
been used. “This agreement is the first of its 
kind in France and it is working well,” says 
Michel Colonna d’Istria, chief of Le 
M onde’s multi-media services. 
On the other hand, in the Anglo-Saxon 
copyright model used in the US and the 
UK and adapted also by the Netherlands, 
publishers can and do use their economic 
power to gain the right to reuse articles and 
other creative materials after making a one- 
off payment. Authors in these three 
countries claim that the present law denies 
the right to compensation for the reuse of 
their materials. In 1997, however, three 
Dutch journalists for the first time won a 
court case against the newspaper de 
Volkskrant over republication of their 
articles without permission on CD-ROM 
and the World-Wide W b. 
The UK-based Jane’s Information 
Group, publisher of Jane’s defence 
magazines, demands all rights from authors 
around the world for both print and 
electronic editions. T he magazine group 
maintains that its one-off fee includes all 
forms of delivery. “So far no one has 
complained,” says a Jane’s spokesperson. 
Mike Holderness, who is active in the 
campaign for electronic rights in the UK 
for the National Union of Journalists 
(NUJ), says that the Anglo-American 
copyright system gives economic ad vantage 
to publishers and denies benefit to authors. 
“There is an obvious need to harmonize 
copyright laws within the European 
Union,” he Says. January 1999 - The Unesco Courier dm

### 114722: Yordan Radichkov: the improbable Bulgarian

Yordan Radichkov: 
The ‘Kafka of Sofia’ uses 
the grotesque to expose 
the world’s absurdity in 
short stories and plays 
steeped in peasant 
wisdom 
You like to say that life is a beautiful 
sentence full of spelling mistakes. 
Human lives are sentences written with lots 
of love and inspiration but plenty of 
mistakes, and mine is no exception. 
However old and wise they are,people still 
make mistakes. 
You have said that people are the rough 
draft of God. Would you compare God to 
a writer who crosses a lot of things out? 
I would be wary of comparing God to 
anyone, especially a writer. God doesn’t 
make mistakes,and I can’t imagine myself 
playing the fool who would try and find 
them. I don’t know whether God exists. If 
he does, so much the better. If he doesn’t, 
it’s not a tragedy. 
As for people. . . . The other day, as I 
was drinking my coffee and listening to the 
radio, I looked through my window and saw 
a magpie looking after her babies in her 
nest. And I said to myself, people are like 
insects. They are capable of looking in 
different directions at the same time, 
keeping one eye on the outside, the other 
on the inside. 
How do you see the world? 
I'm convinced that disorder is the world’s 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - January 1999 
natural state.We’re the ones who make the 
mistake of trying to set things straight. 
People want to organize the universe while 
they have enough trouble putting order into 
their own lives. 
Do you take the world seriously? 
The world already takes itself seriously 
enough without my putting my oar in. 
Everything is extremely serious down 
here—the committees, foundations, 
international organizations, political 
regimes—not to mention the people who 
give themselves airs and believe in their 
own greatness. But when they ride on their 
high horse wearing a bowler hat, they forget 
that all it takes is a gust of wind to blow the 
hat away and all their greatness with it. I 
hate anything that is deadly serious. 
You have a marked taste for the absurd and 
for paradox, which are the basis of your 
approach to literature. 
That is the only sensible approach in this 
boring world. At the risk of shocking you, I 
am convinced that humanity is bored.It is 
ready to be entertained at the drop of a hat. 
The mechanism is quite simple: just look at 
the Monica Lewinsky affair in the United 
States! People all over the world feel 
concerned, have got involved, have had a 
good laugh. I tell myself that my readers 
are bored and need to be entertained.So | 
write for them what interests and amuses 
me. Don’t worry, my interests go beyond 
Lewinsky and other affairs. I am fascinated 
by the peasant wisdom hidden behind the 
apparent naivety of simple folk. It’s an 
undercurrent in all my stories. 
What do you think about current events? 
News is like the fresh water that rivers pour 
endlessly into the ocean. It doesn’t make 
the sea any less salty. 
I have a strong feeling that the world 
today is heading towards a provincialization 
of mentalities, which are not developing at 
the same pace as technology. I would even 
say that things are moving backwards. Take 
the Americans again. They went to the 
moon,much to their credit. But they have 
made such a fuss over their president’s high 
jinks that you can’t help wondering whether 
the United States, despite all its modern 
technology, is not somehow becoming one 
of the world’s remote provinces. 
The remote province is one of your 
favourite settings. Cherkaski, for example,

### 114722: Yordan Radichkov: the improbable Bulgarian

the Improbable 
Bulgarian 
Bulgarian village in the middle 
of nowhere. Where did you get 
the idea for your series of books set 
in this village? 
That was in the sixties. Bulgaria was going 
through a complex period, to say the least. 
I've always had a penchant for the 
grotesque. T he Cherkaski that appears in 
my stories is the result of this combination 
of the complex and the grotesque. But the 
village really does exist. It’s near my 
birthplace. I know it well. Many of my 
classmates came from there. They are 
incredible people. They haven’t changed. 
In 1968 the local authorities arrested me 
when I went back to Cherkaski to make a 
movie based on my short story “The 
Captive Balloon”. 
Why were you arrested? 
Because I was doing something that didn’t 
fit in with communist party ideals. My 
short story was banned almost as soon as it 
was published, and the movie, which we 
managed to finish after all sorts of trials and 
tribulations, was banned after the first 
screening. T he censors deemed my work a 
serious attack on the dignity of the 
Bulgarian people. At the time literature 
either glorified the system or it was 
censored. My work had to be “heroic” in 
order to be recognized. 
It’s not easy to find “irreproachable 
heroes” in the middle of Bulgaria— or 
anywhere else, for that matter. 
In Bulgaria, it’s not easy to survive unless 
you're a hero. Didn’t you know that all 
Bulgarians are heroes? Didn’t you know 
that we're the best?We’ve left all the vices to 
our neighbours and kept all the virtues for 
ourselves. We're very proud of that. But to 
tell the truth, I’ve noticed the same thing 
just about everywhere in the world. 
You’ve been criticized for creating 
characters impervious to ideology. 
At the time the authorities were incapable 
of such subtle analysis. One of my 
politically committed short stories is about 
a man named Gotsa Geraskov, who makes 
an imaginary trip to Paris and arrives there 
on a public holiday. Disappointed to find 
a city completely asleep, he turns around

Your work has often been compared 
with his. Are you flattered or annoyed 
by that? 
I’m not the least bit bothered by it.Critics 
often compare writers when they don’t 
know what else to say. 
But Garcia Marquez's fiction is not 
peopled with the same kind of supernatural 
beings as the tenets and verbludes that 
appear in your work. 
Did you invent these creatures or did you 
borrow them from Bulgarian folklore? 
The verblude came straight out of my 
imagination, but the tenets is a creature that

or was it a form of aesthetic 
experimentation? Would you 
have written the same way in a 
democracy? 
I don’t like to express myself directly. 
Granted, I have worked a bit like Aesop or 
La Fontaine, but I would have written the 
same thing in the same way under any 
political system. Some critics have said 
that I have drawn a great deal of 
inspiration from Bulgarian folklore. It’s 
true that all my writing bears the imprint 
of the region where I was born. But it’s 
also true that in the past what I wrote 
wasn’t always understood in Bulgaria.

actually make themselves quite useful. They 
play a positive role. One tenets is said to have

Maybe you don’t believe in them, but

the other day they were talking about them 
on the radio.” In fact, she was referring to a 
broadcast of one of my stories! 
The inhabitants of Cherkaski 
are totally cut off from the outside 
world. For them, nothing 
is more exotic than Romania, on the 
opposite bank of the Danube, 
where they have never been. Have 
their lives changed since the fall of 
the Berlin Wall? 
Very much so. Television has arrived in the 
remotest corners of the province. It has 
broadened horizons,stirred new interests 
and kindled new desires. A while ago I 
visited my cousins in a small town near 
Cherkaski. Their house was empty. As 
usual, neighbours appeared to tell me they 
weren't there. “Where’ve they gone?” I 
asked. I was surprised because my cousins 
are getting on in years and usually at least 
one old grandma was always home. “They 
all went off to the municipal reading 
room,” was the answer, “to see a strip 
show.” 
You couldn’t say the change has not 
been drastic! But that’s not all. Modernity 
has totally transformed my village. It’s 
been swallowed up and wiped off the map 
bya dam! It’s asif it was intended to give 
me ideas for my stories. The march 
Westward continues, as you might 
imagine: the names of towns were changed 
almost as soon as Zhivkov fell because, as 
everyone knows, changes of that kind are 
essential. For example, the regional

capital, Mihailovgrad, has become 
Montana, just like the American state. The 
town’s name has been changed so often 
no one knows what to call it any more. 
Once it was called Kutlovitsa. You have to 
admit, the name has a “barbarian” ring to 
it. One day at the turn of the century, a 
bearded man drove through the town in a 
car. The rumour immediately spread that 
he was King Ferdinand of Bulgaria in 
person. The village worthies called a 
meeting and wrote a petition requesting 
the National Assembly to change the 
name of the village to “Ferdinand’s 
Kutlovitsa”. It sounded much more

How has Bulgaria changed? Where do you 
think the country is heading? 
For a very long time I saw Bulgaria as a 
white bear floating on an iceberg, all alone 
in the middle of the ocean. We haven’t come 
down off the iceberg in the past few years, 
but at least we pass other bears and wave to 
each other. Soon we won’t be alone any 
more. | think we’re on the right track. We're 
no longer cut off and the world looks at us 
in a different way. I have high hopes for the 
future.

specialized in the mechanical, electronic, 
chemical and food industries. After the 
fall of communism, more than half the 
population fell below the poverty line. It 
was not until 1997 that signs of 
improvement began to appear. 
GNP: $1,140 per capita (1997), almost

economic ones. What is life like there? 
I’m going to paraphrase a line from a short 
story by Maupassant which goes something 
like this, “How lucky we are to die 
surrounded by doctors in white coats!” 
Your political commitment 
came late and seems paradoxical. 
You were invited to the “dissidents’ 
breakfast” with French President Francois 
Mitterrand in 1989, but were elected to the 
National Assembly as a socialist deputy 
during the first free elections two years 
later. 
At that time Ceausescu had just been killed 
and Bulgaria was on the same track as 
Romania. It looked as if it might drown in 
a bloodbath. I belonged to a group of 
intellectuals who thought that if we rallied 
around the socialist party, we might be able 
to channel the tension rising in the streets. 
The French socialists had something to do 
with that decision. I don’t regret the 
experience, but I do consider it a mistake. 
That said, I never set foot in parliament and 
resigned. 
Have these historic changes influenced your 
work? 
No, but they have certainly influenced 
literature in general. First of all they rid 
Bulgarian literature of the burden of 
“glorification” I mentioned earlier. Authors 
can express themselves more freely. Has the 
quality of literature improved? I'm not sure. 
Has opening up to the world given rise to 
“I am convinced that humanity is bored.” 
TALKING TO... 
new literary trends in Bulgaria? 
Yes, especially with young authors. But 
again, permit me to voice some doubts on 
the quality of the results. I'm not against 
influences that could be fruitful but, as 
Maupassant said,the best belly-dancing is 
done in the Orient. I don’t like pseudo- 
innovations. Call me old-fashioned, but I 
miss the days when 80,000 copies of a novel 
by Victor Hugo were published in Bulgaria 
and all of them sold out!That’s saying a lot 
for a country with a population of eight 
million. There was a tradition of reading 
do the same. Look at wild animals. 
Wherever they roam, they always go back to 
their lairs. Salmon swim to the Sargasso 
Sea to die. Birds return home no matter 
how far they may have migrated. Can you 
imagine that a little bird can be wiser than 
a human being? 
In view of the tragedies afflicting the 
Balkans, do you think Balkan writers have a 
special role to play? 
Writers can decide to defend a cause 
through their work, or they can do the 
Pain is the same for everyone and doesn’t 
discriminate between races and peoples. 
It makes everyone equal 
which is dying out nowadays. As I said, 
Bulgaria’s famous reading rooms, which 
have been around since the nineteenth 
century, are being turned into nightclubs. 
Many young Bulgarians have emigrated or 
are thinking of doing so because of the 
country’s severe economic and moral crisis. 
Do you have a message for them? 
I would be tempted to advise them to stay 
at home. There’s no place like home.But I 
am wary of persuading or dissuading 
anyone.l can only speak for myself. In my 
view, people must draw water from their 
own wells. The French have their wells,the 
Germans have theirs,e ven if they draw beer 
from them... . And I think everyone should 
opposite.It’s a personal choice. I don’t have 
any advice to give on that because, as we 
say back home, “if you want to do 
somebody harm, then give them advice.” 
In the end, everything depends on the 
context of space and time.T here might be 
places in the world where writers may not 
feel the need to become involved. I think 
that’s impossible in the Balkans. In 
Bulgaria, writers have always been 
associated with every social, political, 
religious and, of course, cultural 
movement. 
Is it possible to imagine Balkan writers 
getting together to re-establish the long- 
severed links between their countries?

### 114722: Yordan Radichkov: the improbable Bulgarian

Writers in the Balkans are divided by 
tradition. The peoples of the region have 
more or less conflictual relationships. Each 
writer stays in his or her camp.That doesn’t 
mean there isn’t a certain intellectual 
solidarity. For example, one of my plays 
banned in Bulgaria was first performed in 
the Republic of Macedonia in 1988. With 
few exceptions, writers have done nothing 
to aggravate conflicts but they haven’t done 
anything to alleviate them either. 
Macedonian and Greek intellectuals have 
drawn closer together in the past few 
years—which to me seems like the most 
sensible thing to do—but I don’t know of 
any other similar initiatives. I have taken 
part in a grand total of two meetings 
between Balkan writers, and I don’t 
remember them as being particularly 
cordial. 
In a way, that reflects the situation in 
Europe. 1 understand Americans who 
wonder how so many different peoples and 
languages can exist in such a small space. 
The fragmentation of Europe is even more 
marked in the Balkans. 
But the trend in Europe is towards 
unification. . .. The Portuguese writer 
Miguel Torga said, “Universality is locality 
without walls.” What do you think of 
that? 
I would say the same thing myself. You see, 
Sofia is located on the London-Calcutta 
axis. Once, it was on the Silk Route. This 
TALKING TO... 
geographic location has given the city a 
sense of openness, even though Bulgaria 
has often been isolated since the fifteenth 
century. Another route that crosses Sofia— 
and to me it’s just as important as routes 
taken by people—is the route taken by 
migrating birds. It’s known as “the grand 
route of Aristotle”. The universal core of 
Bulgaria is to be found at the crossroads of 
these two routes. 
If you had to define universality in one 
word, what would you say? 
I would say: pain. As a writer, I am very 
sensitive to human pain. It makes people 
equal. Pain is the same for everyone and 
doesn’t discriminate between races and 
peoples. It makes everyone equal. The 
English have a highly developed sense of 
humour, but that doesn’t mean they feel less 
pain than anyone else when they have their 
teeth extracted. [| 
A prolific writer 
y orden Radichkov was born in 1929 at Kalimanitsi, a village in northeastern Bulgaria 
which is today submerged beneath the waters behind a dam. 
He has been a provincial newspaper correspondent, a scriptwriter with the national 
cinema studios and a staff writer on several literary magazines. 
In 1989 he was invited to a “dissidents’ breakfast” by French President Francois 
Mitterrand, but two years later was elected as a member of the Bulgarian parliament on 
a socialist ticket (see box p. 48). Disenchanted by his experience of politics, he soon 
resigned and once again became a full-time writer. 
His literary career began in 1959 with the publication of a collection of short stories 
and since then he has written some 40 books. In 1971 he won the Dimitrov Prize for 
Literature, one of Bulgaria’s leading literary awards. He has also received many prizes from 
other countries, including, in 1984, the prestigious Grinzane Cavour Prize for the best 
foreign book published in Italy. 
He has a notable following in the Scandinavian countries and in Italy, and has published 
over a hundred titles in foreign languages.
