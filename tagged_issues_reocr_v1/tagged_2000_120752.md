Cub photographers from immigrant backgrounds 
take an unusually candid look at their troubled 
neighbourhood on the outskirts of the French city 
of Mulhouse 
    
   
   
ou gotta be niii-ce to the reporter!”says 19-year-old Romain,who likes to 
make his friends laugh. And he knows all about what behind a good image. 
e and all the enthused amateur photographers at the Balalaika workshop 
suburb of Bourtzwiller, outside Mulhouse (see box p. 8), are ready, even 
eager to answer “the reporter’s”’questions. They seem happy to talk, to be lis- 
YE 8 = to, to show off their work. They're pleased to be known and appreciated. 
a ae , Sin About 40 per cent of this suburb’s 15,000 inhabitants vote for the extreme 
am | ERE right-wing National Front and these youngsters, mostly of North African origin, 
voice in words the very things they strive to show in their pictures. 
“They have a quiet attitude to life,” says Eric Vazzoler, the photogra- 
pher who runs the workshop. “They rarely take pictures of burnt-out cars.” 
The youths insist photography hasn’t “saved” them from a so-called “sordid 
universe,” as some articles have claimed. But everyone has found something 
in it to match their needs. It has given them pleasure and self-confidence, and 
they have stopped being afraid of what other people think. It has also 
opened up a new social and cultural horizon,a new world of imagination. 
Like many youths, those in Mulhouse are anxious to meet people and 
have new experiences. But they are also hesitant, torn between family ties and 
the call of the outside world,between love of photography, which requires 
devotion and time, and love itself, which takes them elsewhere. Here is a 
sample of their thoughts. 
Samir, 16,training in car maintenance: 
“I've been taking photos for two years now. I take pictures of every- 
thing—of my family and especially my friends. It’s pure pleasure. Once you've 
done photography yourself, you don’t see other people’s photos in the same 
way any more. You look at them more carefully and search for a message.” P 
  
  
   
 
  
  
  
“1 take pictures of everything— 
of my family and especially my friends. 
It's pure pleasure.”

Samia, 22 studying management: 
“With Eric, we do printing and developing. You've got to be serious and 
learn how to do it. We’ve seen how we can do it all ourselves and on top of 
that our work’s getting recognized. 
The articles they’ve written about us say that ‘thanks to photography, 
they’ve got themselves out of a rut.’ That’s not true. Anyone can come to the 
workshop but not everybody does. You don’t need to be saved just because 
you live in a poor neighbourhood.One paper said burnt-out cars were part 
of our daily lives, but that’s not true either. They're interested in us because 
we live in a place like this. People say:‘Look at where they come from and 
yet they still manage to take photos.” Or else it’s:“That’s how those neigh- 
bourhoods are!’ So they're either trying to see through our eyes or else they 
think we’ve been saved. 
Through taking photos I've made new friends Before, I would never 
have gone to an exhibition.Nowadays, I walk in, look and talk with people 
from different social backgrounds. 
Once a photographer rang me from Germany to buy one of my pictures. 
I was proud. My parents were too and told everyone about it. Eventually I'd 
like to have my own photo lab if I have the money. But I don’t want to be a 
professional photographer. It’s too hard.” 
Nagi, 26,works with a maintenance company: 
“I came here from Tunisia four years ago and I didn’t have any friends. 
I'd already done a little photography in Tunisia, and I kept it up. It’s helped me 
to find out how people live here and to meet people. I like the atmosphere of 
the photo lab even though there are some tricky moments with Eric. Sometimes 
Idon't like what he says. But it’s taught me I have my faults, that I'm stubborn.” 
“You don’t need to be saved just because you 
live in a poor neighbourhood.”

Kamel, 19, training to service machinery and computers: 
“I've loved everything to do with pictures since I was little, when I 
dreamt of being a film producer. The photo workshop has been a godsend. 
Especially when I found out it only cost $5 a year to join. 
Photography’s classy. When you do it, you meet different people, from 
other social classes. The lab is also fun. We have a really good time there. 
Before, when I looked at a photo, it didn’t mean anything to me. Now I know 
how to criticize my own photos and other people’s. I've learned how to 
defend my perspective and my work. We don’t get much chance to exhibit 
what we do, but we can help to change the image of young people. 
When I tell people I take pictures, everyone’s amazed. Hip-hop is 
seen as normal,but photography surprises people. They think this must be 
a good guy and they’re less afraid of me. 
Once, I was stopped going into a nightclub. My face must not be the 
right shade of colour. I got out my camera and as soon as they saw I'd come 
to take pictures for free, they opened the door. Another time, I worked for 
someone who did body-painting I was paid for it and I felt recognized. 
As soon as there’s a project, 'm interested. I can see myself doing it for 
a living but not as a photo-journalist or a portrait photographer. I'd like to 
be an artistic photographer. You're freer. My goal is to develop my own style 
and make a name for myself.” 
Sandrine, 18,training in commercial management: 
“Atlast I have a passion. Before, I wasn’t doing much of anything. I was 
pretty self-absorbed. Now I have friends. The hardest part is to accept the 
criticism of Eric and the others, because I'm personally attached to the 
photos I take. For a while, I even stopped taking them. Then I started again. 
I got a bit of self-confidence.” 
Jamel, 24 studying at the Mulhouse art school: 
Neighbourhood games “I’m the one who does all the graffiti art in the neighbourhood. I go by 
the name ‘Serio’ because S, E and R are the letters I draw best and also 
because they remind me of the word ‘serious.’ I started out wanting to study 
music but the equipment’s expensive. So I got into painting. I'll need pho- 
tography at least until the end of my time at art school. I'm interested in 
images. I think about them all the time.” n

ne day, art photographer Eric Vazzoler decided that he'd had enough traipsing 
Oro Paris trying to sell his work, mainly about the former Soviet Union. So he 
agreed to take charge of a “neighbourhood cultural project”in the northern suburb 
of Mulhouse, in eastern France, and not surprisingly, gave his workshop a Russian 
name. Projects like these were started by the Ministry of Culture in 1996 to try to 
“reduce social divisions.” 
“| was going to stay seven months, but I've been here nearly four years now," says Eric, 
37.He's about to move on, but his project has lasted longer than all the others and 
been much praised. There have been exhibitions in France and other countries, generous 
press coverage and a book soon to be published. 
The youngsters credit Eric with its success. “He isn't easy and he’s demanding to work 
with,but what a pro! “they say. “We can always knock on his door at 11 o'clock at 
night to get a roll of film.” 
Eric, who lives in the neighbourhood, is more modest. “When | arrived here, there was 
nothing. | filled a gap, and | have the cream of the crop. The really disturbed kids can't 
take the studious atmosphere of the lab.” And in his gruff but kindly way, he adds: 
“Their pictures are very nicely composed.They've got a distinct style. They're refre- 
shing and generous. At their age | was busy copying the great masters. These kids 
aren't influenced by anyone” Except by Eric,of course. [|

Just how bad was the world’s 
worst nuclear disaster? The 
answer lies hidden within a 
web of politics and scientific 
uncertainty enmeshing the UN 
and eastern European 
governments   FRED PEARCE 
ENVIRONMENTALIOURNALIST AND 
CONSULTANT FORTHE BRITISHWEEKLY MAGAZINE, THE NEW 
SCIENTIST 
    
4 igh of relief ripples across Europe as 
engine prepare to shut down Cher- 
nobyl, the world’s most feared nuclear 
“power plant, on December 15th. Politi- 
cians ‘have finally brokered a deal in 
which rn donors foot the bill of 
about two billion dollars to close and 
fully entomb the Ukrainian reactors. Yet 
for many ordinary citizens, the nightmare 
continues. 
Just a few months ago, on April 26th, 
thousands marched solemnly through the 
towns of Belarus, Ukraine and eastern 
Russia to commemorate the dead from 
the nuclear disaster 14 years before. At 
1:26 am bells tolled to mark the moment 
when a Chernobyl reactor blew and a 
deadly radioactive fall-out began to 
blanket their fields and towns 
But as well as mourning, there was 
fear. Fear of the continuing radiation, 
which could claim thousands more. And 
fear of speaking out of turn. That night, 
Yuri Bandazhevsky, rector of the Gomel 
Medical Institute in Belarus until his 
arrest last year, was in forced internal 
exile in the capital of Minsk. He is one of 
many researchers who say their work has 
been suppressed or ignored by govern- 
ments anxious to play down the radia- 
tion risks their citizens still face.

REL 
After the explosion, 50,000 “liquidators” 
range from the 32 offered by UN nuclear 
scientists to the 15,000 suggested by some 
Ukrainian researchers. In June, scientists 
at the UN’s Scientific Committee on the 
Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) 
reported that “there is no evidence of a 
major public health impact attributable to 
radiation, apart from a high level of thy- 
roid cancer in children [from which] few

should die.” Yet the previous day the UN 
Secretary-General, KofiAnnan,appeared 
to disagree when he said: “The catastrophe 
is far from over. It continues to have a 
devastating effect not only on the health 
of the people, but on every aspect of 
society.” So what is the truth? And how do 
these disparities arise? 
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear

power plant reduced the Number Four 
reactor to an inferno spewing out a radio- 
active cloud for ten days. It released a 
hundred times more radioactivity than 
the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki combined. For several days 
there was total silence, before the panic 
evacuation of some 116,000 people from 
an exclusion zone that stretched up to 
30 kilometres from the plant. 
Only years after the accident did the 
public learn that a larger zone some 150 
kilometres away near the Belarus town of 
Gomel and extending into Russia suf- 
fered heavy fall-out in rain shortly after 
bedevil the task of keeping people safe, 
says Greenpeace’s Chernobyl specialist 
Tobias Muenchmeyer. Researchers inside 
the affected countries agree. “A regime of 
secrecy was accepted in our country from 
the very first second the catastrophe hap- 
pened,” says Vladimir Chernousenko, the 
Ukrainian scientist who co-ordinated the 
post-accident clean-up. 
A partial information blackout by 
governments, combined with scientific 
caution, has helped lead UN agencies into 
seriously underestimating the death toll, 
Muenchmeyer believes. Critics of the 
nuclear industry such as Rosalie Bertell,

the accident. It emerged in 1989 that a 
fifth of Belarus had been significantly 
contaminated. Some 400,000 people were 
resettled. And today around four million 
people still live in areas with some ack- 
nowledged contamination. 
Official secrecy inside the Soviet Union 
and its successor governments about the 
extent of the contamination continues to 
    
president of the International Institute 
of Concern for Public Health in Toronto, 
say there is another political reason. They 
point to a 1959 agreement between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and 
the World Health Organization, which 
said that “the 1AEA had the primary res- 
ponsibility for encouraging, assisting and 
co-ordinating research on, and the deve-

lopment and practical application of 
atomic energy.” According to Bertell, “the 
IAEA has since considered itself to be the 
watchdog over information about radia- 
tion health effects which is distributed to 
the public.” Bertell and other organiza- 
tions this year called for the WHO to 
amend the agreement. 
The most important radioactive iso- 
topes released at Chernobyl were iodine 
and caesium. Iodine-131 has a half-life 
(the time it takes for half the atoms of a 
radioactive isotope to decay) of eight 
days. It was mostly inhaled and eaten in 
contaminated food. Caesium-137 has a 
half-life of some 30 years. It is still present 
in soils and vegetation and continues to 
contaminate people through foodstuff. 
Some lesser isotopes have half-lives of 
hundreds or even thousands of years. 
Controversy over 
the casualty list 
Who suffered? In the front line were 
the “liquidators”—the estimated 600,000 
to 800,000 soldiers and public employees 
drafted in to make the reactor safe and 
bury contaminated waste. Some 50,000 of 
them worked on top of the reactor. “They 
were supposed to stay on the roof to fight 
the fire for only 90 seconds, then be 
replaced. One can easily guess this did 
not happen,” says Jean-Pierre Revel, 
senior health official at the International 
Federation of the Red Cross. As a result, 
237 liquidators were hospitalized; 32 died. 
But since then, the Soviet Union and 
its successors have been unable or 
unwilling to keep track of this most-at- 
risk group. According to Leonid Ilyin, a 
former Russian member of the Interna- 
tional Commission on Radiological Pro- 
tection, “none of these men was registered 
by name. None was checked [for subse- 
quent health] on a regular basis. They all 
went back to their homes.” This failure is 
probably the largest organizational cause 
of the disputes over Chernobyl’s death 
toll. Last April, Viacheslav Grishin, presi- 
dent of the Chernobyl League—a Kiev- 
based organization that claims to represent 
the liquidators—said 15,000 liquidators 
had died and 50,000 were handicapped. 
His source was a controversial estimate by 
Chernousenko, based on likely cancer 
rates from radiation doses that he believes 
the liquidators received. 
Cancers have been the biggest long- 
term medical fear. By 1991, doctors were 
reporting many cases of thyroid cancer 
among children under four at the time of 
the disaster. In 1992,a group of Western 
researchers, including Keith Baverstock 
of the WHO, agreed that Chernobyl was 
the likely cause. Yet it was only in 1995, 
after some 800 cases had emerged, that 
the UN system formally accepted the fin-

Lethally close to Chernobyl, the abandoned (4147 of IE ALR ET ER 
ding. This delay had serious implications 
in finding and treating the disease, which 
is not fatal if caught early enough. 
Playing politics and 
crushing dissent 
The conclusion had been initially 
controversial partly because the evidence 
from Hiroshima and Nagasaki suggested 
that there should be far fewer cases. But 
politics also entered the equation. The 
Economist magazine speculated that “if 
the health risks have been underestimated 
or understated, the American govern- 
ment could face new lawsuits on every- 
thing from the Nevada [nuclear] tests to 
the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 
1979.” 
At any rate, there are now some 1,800 
recorded cases of thyroid cancer attri- 
buted to Chernobyl. In the most conta- 
minated districts, such as Gomel, child- 
hood rates are 200 times those in western 
Europe. Estimates of the total number of 
cases expected to arise in the future range 
from a “few thousand,” suggested by the 
TAEA, to the 66,000 predicted for a single 
group—Belarusian children under four 
at the time of the disaster—by WHO scien- 
tist Elisabeth Cardis, who stressed that 
“the risk estimates are very uncertain.” 
What about other cancers which take 
longer to develop? Officially, the wHO 
stands by its assessment of 1996 that while 
“there have been some reports of 
increases in the incidence of specific mali- 
gnancies in some populations living in 
contaminated territories and in liquida- 
tors, these reports are not consistent and 
could reflect differences in the follow-up 
of exposed populations” But some of its 
scientists are sceptical. They ask not what 
can be proved, but what can be expected 
on the basis of known science. 
Based on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 
Baverstock expects an “excess” of some 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - October 2000 
6,600 fatal cancers, including 470 leu- 
kaemia cases. But a team of Belarusian 
doctors claims to have found leukaemia 
rates four times the national average 
among heavily exposed liquidators. And 
there are fears that, as with thyroid cancer, 
rates could be far higher than expected. 
But scientific uncertainty should not 
detract from the fact that there are poli- 
tical reasons why the truth about the 
disaster may remain hidden, says 
Muenchmeyer of Greenpeace. National 
governments, who act as gatekeepers for 
most of the statistics reaching UN agencies, 
have a political agenda, he says. The 
Ukraine is running 14 nuclear reactors 
with another four under construction, 
according to the IAEA. “So the Ukraine 
doesn’t want to ruin the image of nuclear 
power by stressing the harm done by 
Chernobyl,” says Muenchmeyer, “but 
they also want aid for health programmes. 
So then they are interested in showing the 
burden. Often they contradict themselves 
within a few days” 
The Belarus government has consis- 
tently downplayed the disaster, even 
though the country received an estimated 
70 per cent of the fall-out. “They decided 
that the territory and the number of 
people affected are so great, and the 
government so poor, that they cannot 
solve the problem. They decided to shut 
down dissent,” says Muenchmeyer. This 
has hampered research and apparently 
prevented findings by local scientists from 
reaching UN agencies. 
Two years ago, Rosa Goncharova of 
the Institute of Genetics and Cytology 
in Minsk reported evidence that conge- 
nital abnormalities were turning up in 
the children of those irradiated by Cher- 
nobyl. She told a conference that since 
1985, cases of cleft palate, Down’s syn- 
drome and other deformities had 
increased by 
83 per cent in the areas most heavily 
contaminated, 30 per cent in moderately 
contaminated areas and 24 per cent in 
“clean”areas. 
But two years later, when contacted 
for this article, Cardis of the WHO said 
she had “not received copies of the 
paper” by Goncharova. Nor had she 
received copies of work by the director of 
the independent Belarusian Institute of 
Radiation Safety (Belrad), Vasily Neste- 
renko. He had found that in the most 
contaminated areas, the incidence of 
diseases of the circulatory system had 
risen fourfold and deaths among children 
from respiratory diseases were up 14- 
fold (see interview). 
The dangers of the 
twilight zone 
And consider the fate of Yuri Ban- 
dazhevsky, whose case has been taken 
up by Amnesty International. As rector of 
the Gomel Medical Institute, he carried 
out autopsies at the city’s forensic 
morgue, on bodies whose deaths were 
not considered connected to Chernobyl. 
He examined their internal organs and 
compared them to the organs of rats that 
he had fed grain containing radioactive 
caesium. He was shocked by his findings: 
“The pathological modifications of the 
kidneys, heart,liver and lungs was iden- 
tical to those among the experimental 
rats.” From this he concluded, “that accu- 
mulation of radiocaesium in the organs 
played a major role in the triggering of 
pathological responses.” In other words, 
it made them ill and even killed them. 
His paper went ignored. His subse - 
quent criticism of the post-Chernobyl 
research conducted by the Ministry of 
Health brought him more enemies. And 
last summer he was arrested on unspeci- 
fied bribery charges, and locked up for six 
months. His computer and all his files 
were confiscated and he remains confined

to Minsk “under investigation.” 
People are still being exposed to 
radiation from Chernobyl. In large areas 
of Belarus in particular the environment 
is still heavily contaminated. The wHO 
says “some foods produced by private 
farmers do exceed [WHO limits].” But it 
points out that most large farms mini- 
mize take-up of radioactivity in soils by 
deep ploughing and applying fertilizers. 
“No food produced by collective farms 
now exceeds the limits.” 
But thousands of people rely on pri- 
vate farms, according to Belrad’s Neste- 
renko, who maintains that a quarter of 
the food grown inside the contaminated 
zone supersedes official radioactivity 
limits. More than 500 villages are drin- 
king contaminated milk. Moreover, many 
people rely on “wild” produce such as 
mushrooms, berries and hunted meat— 
the most risky food of all says the WHO’s 
Baverstock. 
And, of course, there are the people 
who return to live a twilight life inside 
the exclusion zone, replanting their 
contaminated gardens, gathering food 
from the forests and raiding abandoned 
food stores. Most are old women, who 
judged that the radioactivity could do 
them little harm at their age. But there are 
recent unconfirmed reports of a baby 
being born there. The tragedy, as Kofi 
    
     
Annan said, goes on. [| 
  


### 120755: The World's first radioactive reserve

The world’s first radioactive reserve 
n the weeks after the accident, coniferous trees and mammals that ate 
ground vegetation received the highest doses of radiation. Trees died and 
were buried by the liquidators. Cows grazing heavily contaminated grass 
near the reactor died. So too did most of the mice in the exclusion zone. 
Most intriguingly for scientists, the survivors were almost all female. Only 
after four generations did male numbers begin to recover. 
Mona Dreicer, a U.S. researcher who collated material for a major inter- 
national conference held on the Chernobyl aftermath in 1996 (Vienna), 
says that levels of radioactivity in surface soils had fallen by a factor of 
a hundred by the autumn of 1986, and “by 1989 the natural environment 
had begun to recover.” Badly 
damaged conifers were making 
cones again and the rodent 
population was growing fast. 
Today, the roll call of wildlife 
includes wild boar, elk, deer, 
foxes and some 200 wolves. The 
list of animals failing to return is 
relatively short: pigeons and rats, 
which rely on human leftovers to 
flourish, as well as swallows, 
which have apparently fallen 
prey to genetic disorders. 
But the region remains heavily 
contaminated, particularly soils, 
vegetation, the tree wood and 
leaf litter on the forest floors that 
cover roughly a third of the 
exclusion zone. The zone has become in effect, the world's first radioac- 
tive nature reserve. It is a fantastic laboratory to analyze the impact of 
radioactive fall-out. Yet says the head of the reserve, Nikolai Voronetsky, 
most researchers have avoided travelling there, fearing for their own per- 
sonal safety. It is not surprising, perhaps. Three out of a team of ten bota- 
nists who visited in 1986 are now dead, he says. 
Voronetsky's own researchers have shown that the internal organs of the 
wolves and most other creatures remain radioactive. The wolves are particu- 
larly worrisome as they stray outside of the reserve, hunting for sheep and 
horses. The boar tallied the highest geiger-counter readings, says Vorontesky, 
because they dig into contaminated soil in search of food. 
Rosa Goncharova of the Institute of Genetics and Cytology in Minsk says 
that she has observed increased "genetic anomalies” in rodents and fish 
in the contaminated zone. Dreicer downplays such reports. “The frequency 
of these reported defects was shown to be similar in highly contaminated 
and non-contaminated regions... Leading to the conclusion that they 
LER ERE OF ELH RET T ELL NTR TS Cd THT FL) 
were not due to increased radiation dose” she says. But critics see this 
as UN “spin.” For one thing, you would not expect a close correlation bet- 
ween defects and crude fall-out levels because, as Dreicer herself has 
pointed out, the vagaries of local soils can lead to grazing animals recei- 
ving high doses even in areas that had low fall-out. 
There are many ways that radioactivity can “leak into the wider environ- 
ment.” Earlier this year there were fears that fires raging across peat 
bogs in the contaminated zones could unleash radioactive clouds of 
smoke. The U.S. embassy sent a team to check for fall-out,but reportedly 
none was found. Water, however, has proven to be a serious conduit for 
contamination. 
During spring flooding, concen- 
trations of radioactive materials 
in local rivers increases by up to 
four times. In fact, the contami- 
nated zone had been flooded 
six times since the accident, 
each time washing radioactive 
material down river, especially 
along the banks of the Pripyat, 
which drains into the Dneiper 
and ultimately the Black Sea. 
With nine million Ukrainians 
drinking water from reservoirs 
on the Dneiper and many more 
eating food irrigated by the river 
waters, a European Commission 
report has concluded that radio- 
active water is the most important environmental threat still posed by the 
accident. 
Fourteen years after the disaster, radioactive materials are remaining mobile 
within soils and ecosystems much more than scientists had expected. Jim 
Smith of the British government's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology repor- 
ted in May this year that “the environment is not cleaning itself of the pol- 
lution at the rate we previously thought.” In places, he said caesium was 
being “re-released into the ecosystem” as the Chernobyl legacy begins a 
new cycle. [|

BELARUS: 
INTERVIEW BY GALIA ACKERMAN 
OF RADIO FRANCE INTERNATIONALE 
  
The Chernobyl nuclear disaster 
continues to threaten the 
survival of the Belarusian 
people, says Vasily Nesterenko, 
a local physicist™® 
You maintain that the effects of the Cher- 
nobyl disaster have been played down not 
just by your own country’s leaders but also 
by international organizations... 
The UN Scientific Committee on the 
Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) 
relies on the figures of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which 
represents the nuclear lobby. In evalua- 
ting the disaster, the IAEA has compared 
Chernobyl to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
But in Japan, the thermo-nuclear reac- 
tions took place entirely in the air and the 
soil was not contaminated. After the 
Chernobyl fire, neighbouring countries 
were bombarded by hundreds of tonnes 
of radionuclides (or particles). The soil of 
Belarus alone absorbed two-thirds of the 
fall-out and some of the nuclides, such as 
caesium-137, stay radioactive for more 
than 30 years. Food accounts for 80 per 
cent of the long-term contamination of 
the population. Since the disaster, my 
institute has been systematically moni- 
toring children with special spectrome- 
ters. My colleague, Prof. Yuri Bandaz- 
hevsky, was the first to link the 
accumulation of radioactivity in people’s 
bodies to their illnesses. The contami- 
nation has caused many diseases not 
recognized by international organiza- 
tions. 
What are these ailments? 
After doing thousands of autopsies, Ban- 
dazhevsky and his team showed that cae- 
sium-137 had accumulated in muscle tissue, 
beginning with the heart. Two-thirds of the

Chernobyl: the political fall-out continues 
2,000 children monitored in the highly- 
contaminated area of Gomel have heart 
problems. The concentration of caesium in 
the kidneys has also caused serious mal- 
functions from an early age. Caesium in 
the eye muscles leads to cataracts. For 
example, a 1997 study in Svetlovisy, near 
Gomel, found that a quarter of children 
between 13 and 15 had cataracts. 
During pregnancy, the placenta in 
mothers-to-be stores caesium which irra- 
diates the foetus and after the birth,the 
mother breastfeeds the baby with conta- 
minated milk. This leads to several 
diseases, such as “Chernobyl AIDS,” 
which is an immunity disorder. The radio- 
active particles also combine with lead 
(which was used in 1986 to put out the fire 
and was then absorbed into the ground) 
to cause mental retardation and stomach 
ailments. We are heading towards a 
national disaster. 
What does your country need most? 
Two million people, a quarter of them 
children, are living in contaminated areas. 
We have to set up mobile units to monitor 
these people and what they eat. My ins- 
titute doesn’t have many resources, so 
can only do very little monitoring. It’s 
also threatened with closure because the 
government doesn’t want the “distur- 
bing” news to spread. The contaminated 
children need to be sent for a month’s

FACING THE DISASTER ALONE 
On April 26,2000, crowds marched in downtown Minsk to mark the anniversary of the disaster. 
stay in clean areas at least twice a year 
and be given pectin-based pills, which are 
effective, very cheap and made in 
Ukraine, though not here. We have to set 
up centres for young mothers in areas 
where they can eat uncontaminated food 
while pregnant and breast-feeding. 
Why hasn't your government raised the 
alarm about all this? 
Belarus is facing alone a disaster it’s not 
responsible for. Neither Russia nor 
Ukraine, where Chernobyl is located, has 
helped us. Our national budget only 
allows a small amount of money to be 
spent on the victims and our government 
officials believe they know best. But they 
haven’t properly evaluated the situation. 
They've lied to tens of thousands of Rus- 
sians who have come from “hot spots” or 
crisis areas in the former Soviet Union to 
live in the contaminated region.! They're 
still lying to their own people. They have 
a head-in-the-sand attitude. Only massive 
international aid and strong logistical 
support by the government will ensure 
the survival of my people in the long run.m 
1 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 25 million 
Russians found themselves living outside the new 
borders of Russia, mainly in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus where there was and still is war. The 
Belarusian government encouraged them to settle in 
the contaminated areas by giving them housing, 
jobs and resident status.

Know how to survive. They know that

A clash of cultures 
When addressing the education of 
pastoralists, it is all too often forgotten 
that to be a “pastoralist” means being 
Turkana (Kenya),Rabari (India),Qash- 
qa’i (Iran), or from some other commu- 
nity. It is an identity these people take 
pride in, a complex and sophisticated way 
of life which,with all its harshness, they 
profoundly love. Education,however, has 
mainly been intended as an instrument to 
transform the pastoralists into something 
else. The history of mass education pro- 
grammes for nomads has been that of an 
encounter between people seeking new 
ways of adapting to an evolving context— 
monetarization of the economy, commo- 
dification of labour and privatization of 
land—and a broad set of actors, from 
policy-makers and project officers to tea- 
chers and local officials, who widely 
believe that nomads have to be “saved” 
from their way of life. It is upon this cul- 
tural clash that the “problem”of delive- 
ring mass education to nomads has been 
framed and policy solutions devised. ©

### 120757: The Bias behind nomadic education

The bias behind 
nomadic education 
All too often, education has been touted as the key to transforming nomadic identity, 
which goes a long way towards explaining its patchy record

### 120757: The Bias behind nomadic education

Nomadic herders number several tens 
of millions of people, mainly in African 
dry lands, the Middle East, and south- 
west, south and central Asia. They include 
some of the most vulnerable of all sou- 
thern populations. They often make a 
significant contribution to national food 
production. Mobility, harsh environ- 
mental conditions and remoteness have 
always stood as barriers to the provision 
of formal education, and millions of 
nomadic pastoral children remain out- 
side the system. 
Political motives 
underpin initiatives 
Mongolia, a country where the majo- 
rity of the population is nomadic, stands 
as a case apart. Compulsory state edu- 
cation for children between eight and 18 
began in 1940. The system relied on hun- 
dreds of schools with dormitory facilities 
built in all rural settlements. Education 
was free, accounting for more thanl15 per 
cent of GDP. Schools were well staffed, 
with highly motivated and comparatively 
well-paid teachers, most of whom came 
from a nomadic background. Within the 
following 20 years, Mongolia passed from 
around two to more than 90 per cent lite- 
racy and by 1990, before liberalization, the 
country had almost reached a rate of 100 
per cent. This unprecedented figure— 
unmatched ever since with a nomadic 
population—can hardly be explained in 
terms of innovative programme content. 
The standard curriculum was highly aca- 
demic and teacher-centred in nature. Ins- 
tead, the crucial factor had more to do 
with a sympathetic human environment 
and the absence of a rift between the cul- 
ture of the school and that of the nomads. 
But Mongolia is a chiefly nomadic 
country. Although scarce documentation 
and widely differing contexts make it dif- 
ficult to paint a general history of nomadic 
education, political motives always 
underpin initiatives. In Somalia,a short- 
lived rural development campaign laun- 
ched in 1974 took a bold approach: the 
government simply closed down all 
secondary schools for one year and sent 
20,000 students and teachers to the coun- 
tryside to teach literacy to the largely 
nomadic population. They used methods 
learnt in Koranic schools writing letters 
on a blackboard, reading them aloud and 
asking pupils to repeat. This was, at least 
in intention, a two-way campaign, as one 
of the slogans underlined: “What you 
know, teach; what you do not know, 
learn.” Hindered by the 1974 drought, 
the campaign was nevertheless a surpri- 
sing success: in only seven months, 910,000 
of the 1.2 million students registered sat 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - October 2000 
the final test and 800,000 passed. 
A more common reason for provi- 
ding education to nomadic pastoralists 
emerged when a number of newly inde- 
pendent African states realized that some 
of the dry lands and the livestock were 
valuable “national” resources. As such, 
pastoralists had to become more closely 
integrated into the economy, notably by 
increasing production. The task of 
“modernizing” the nomads was left to 
education. The Kenyan case is instruc- 
tive. In 1970, the Parliament amended 
the Anglo-Maasai agreement, which kept 
the reserves closed to non-Maasai, and 
launched a programme aimed at impro- 
ving enrolment by setting up low-cost 
boarding schools. But the new educa- 
tional facilities were flooded by pupils 
from non-pastoral ethnic groups and were 
disregarded by the Maasai. In the late 
1970s, when an evaluation found that the 
boarding schools were operating below 
capacity, the government decided to tem- 
porarily cut funds to the programme. 
Although governments 
may no longer 
be trying to transform 
pastoralists into 
settled farmers, they are 
still trying to 
transform them into 
“something else,” 
such as “modern” 
livestock producers 
Some analysts argued that carrying out 
education in the absence of economic 
development and related social services 
had been a mistake. The 1984-1988 Deve- 
lopment Plan concentrated on improving 
livestock resources, marketing facilities 
and banking services, assuming that 
demand for education would stem from 
increased monetary resources. Rather 
than look at the programme’s shortco- 
mings, the blame was put on pastoralists’ 
“backward” way of life. All that policy- 
makers had to do was reverse the equa- 
tion: from education as a path towards 
development, to development as a path 
towards education. 
Mainstream explanations for the fai- 
lure of education provision in pastoral 
areas usually blame the recipients. It is 
assumed that the problem stems from the 
nomads’ obsolete way of life and cultural 
conservatism, rather than from the inca- 
pacity of a national system to respond to 
the living conditions of a significant 
number of its citizens. Research is practi- 
cally inexistent on the impact of educa- 
tion. Figures on enrolment and attendance 
rely on local records that are often incom- 
plete and inaccurate, yet these figures are 
usually the main yardstick used to mea- 
sure the outcomes of education pro- 
grammes. The most profound impact of 
these programmes remains an untold 
story. Social norms, networks and rela- 
tionships of authority play a critical role in 
pastoral livelihood systems, which edu- 
cation often tends to undermine. A divide 
often sets in between educated and non- 
educated members of communities. 
Recent research underlines how projects 
of directed change are embedded into 
education programmes for nomads, ten- 
ding to antagonize local learning and 
socialization patterns. Although govern- 
ments may no longer be trying to trans- 
form pastoralists into settled farmers, they 
are still trying to transform them into 
“something else,” such as “modern”live- 
stock producers, as in Nigeria. 
Hooking nomads 
to the system 
With the push for decentralization 
and cost-sharing in education over the 
past ten years, some governments are tur- 
ning to innovative partnerships with inter- 
national development agencies rather 
than investing in mass education pro- 
grammes. Pastoral areas are particularly 
targeted, given that they have the lowest 
literacy rates. A few non-formal educa- 
tion programmes are now focusing on 
providing a service directly related to life 
in pastoral societies. By moving away from 
the emphasis on productivity, there is 
room to address crucial livelihood issues 
such as resource access, conflict manage- 
ment and local advocacy. In Senegal, trai- 
ning modules have been developed in 
local languages for pastoralists. In Kenya, 
an out-of-school programme launched in 
1992 has set up learning centres offering 
non-formal primary education to nomad 
children, with strong community invol- 
vement. 
But these alternative approaches do 
not address the structural inadequacy of 
education systems. They are often about 
getting beneficiaries “hooked” to “fit the 
system,” and are but a parallel second- 
class education. Unless the power issue 
behind the formal/non-formal divide is 
addressed, even the best education pro- 
grammes may only result into channel- 
ling out-of-school children into persis- 
tently unresponsive systems. n

to deal with their nomadic 
lifestyle. Countries in sub- 
Saharan Africa have come up 
with different solutions 
u Fo the past few years, people in all the 
settlements have supported and 
valued schooling,” says a representative 
of local school parents. “Things are chan- 
ging and our nomadic culture seems to be 
evolving.” 
The pupils at the little schoolhouse at 
Imbassassouteéne, south of Timbuktu, 
include Peul and Tuareg nomad children. 
Its six classes offer both primary and secon- 
dary education, catering to students from 
six to 18. In the evening, literacy classes 
are held there for adults. 
Not all schools in the region boast such a 
record. The school at Djebok, 40 kms east 
of Gao, counts 254 children enrolled in 
four primary classes, but only 25 in its five 
secondary grades. Mohamed ag Hama- 
dida, the headmaster, says about 15 per 
cent of the children drop out each year. The 
reasons: some settlements are far from the 
school, while tradition stipulates that loo- 
king after cattle is more noble and wor- 
thwhile than attending what is known as 
“the French school.” 
The children are taught by the “conver- 
gent”’method, which mainly relies on using 
Tamazight, the Tuareg mother tongue, 
when they start school. The first year, three 
quarters of the lessons are in Tamazight. 
French, Mali’s official language, takes on 
increasing importance to become the only 
one used by the time the children reach 
their sixth year. 
Education in its “modern” form was intro- 
duced during the French colonial era and 
coldly welcomed by the Tuaregs. The tribal 
chiefs refused to let their sons go to school, 
sending children taken from serf families 
instead. After independence, distrust 
remained towards an institution that was

The bias behind nomadic education 
foreign to the traditional culture and threa- 
tened to force nomads into adopting a 
sedentary lifestyle. 
But recent events have revolutionized the 
lives of the Tuaregs. Major droughts in 
1973 and 1984 and then armed rebellion in 
the early 1990s! and subsequent repres- 
sion caused large migrations. The peace 
agreements in Mali (1992) and Niger 
(1995) allowed the displaced people to 
return with the help of the UN High Com- 
mission for Refugees, but not until 1996. 
Many parents then changed their attitude 
and concluded that going to school could 
help their offspring find jobs away from the 
world of nomadic cattle-herding. Education 
    
  
     
   
had also proved useful during the peace 
negotiations and later to help Tuaregs 
secure government jobs. 
Many partners are involved in the educa- 
tion of Tuareg children, including the World 
Bank, the Organization of Petroleum- 
Exporting Countries (OPEP), USAID, the 
Islamic Development Bank, the French 
group Volunteers for Progress and Dutch 
and French government aid bodies. 
The host countries contribute too. Emma- 
nuel Sagara, director of basic education 
for the Gao region, held a seminar in the 
Chadian capital, Ndjamena, in January 
2000, that brought together education 
experts and officials from Burkina Faso, 
Mauritania, Niger, Chad and Mali. Poli- 
cies vary widely from country to country.

chers move with the nomads. Niger has 
opted for a mixed system, with children 
spending six months in a school and the rest 
of the year tending animals. Mali has 
chosen to set up a series of “sites” which 
include a school and a nearby well to attract 
and accommodate the nomads. 
Sagara says school attendance by 6-12- 
year-olds is 36 per cent in the Gao 
region, with girls accounting for 18 per cent 
of the total. But there are no figures on 
how many nomad children are among 
them because language and ethnic origin 
are not seen as relevant.

are raking in awards at the most prestigious festivals, such as 
those in Cannes, Venice and Locarno (pp. 20-21). The same crea- 
tive muscle is hard to find in the West, where the industry is now 
dominated by the laws of entertainment and profit (pp.22-23). 
While neo-realism seems to be a major influence, each of these 
| new waves has marked its own path. Ironically, as Iranian cinema 
grabs the intemational limelight, it is losing the official acceptance 
it won after the revolution of 1979 (pp. 26-28). In the dying days of Japan's major studios, 
young filmmakers are finding limited budgets alongside new-found freedom to focus on 
a disillusioned generation (pp.28-30). The advent of democracy in South Korea and efforts 
to defend local production have spawned a new generation of directors who are winning 
plaudits at home and abroad. At the same time, China's “sixth generation” of directors is 
flourishing despite public indifference 
and the struggle against censorship 
(p.33). 
On the other side of the world, some 
South American directors are making 
their own waves. The seventh art is 
proving to be particularly fertile in 
Argentina, where directors are tuming 
a poetic eye to life on the street (pp.34- 
36). While filmmakers in exile add to 
the ranks of this movement (pp.37-38), 
the advent of new technologies (p. 
39) may carry it to new creative 
grounds.

THE WONDERFUL WORLD 
OF FILMMAKING 
When you make films and are lucky 
enough to get one shown at a festival, you 
can then set off round the world taking 
your movie from one festival to another. 
It’s a big opportunity, not just for making 
your name-vital for those of us outside 
mainstream cinema-but also because you 
discover other independent films and 
come to realize you're not alone. 
I have followed this filmmaker’s pil- 
grimage, and have met fellow directors 
in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Iran. In 
Berlin, Nantes, Rotterdam and at Sun- 
dance, I have also witnessed a powerful 
new wave of films coming from Asia that 
has coincided with a revival of filmma- 
king in Latin America. There is no single 
theme or style. Each film is different, but 
all are intent on depicting real life and all 
are made with paltry resources. 
I shot one of my films, Rapado (Close 
Cut), with a grant from the Rotterdam 
festival to write a script outline. What pays 
for a synopsis in Europe can fund a whole 
feature film in Argentina. Having no 
money isn’t a virtue, but it does focus your 
mind and forces you to look for narra- 
tive solutions that fit your budget. Japa- 
nese filmmakers agree with us South 
Americans that film schools should be 
BY MARTIN REJTMAN 
ARGENTINE FILMMAKER, DIRECTOR OF SILVIA PRIETO (1999) 
used as a nursery for directors and tech- 
nicians, and as a way into the profession. 
Buenos Aires now has more than 15 film 
schools, a profusion that can only inspire 
people to make films. 
Has Western cinema lost its way? 
Maybe, but there are still some great direc- 
tors. Films made in developed countries 
these days tend to suffocate you with the 
same tired old plots and easy images 
drawn from ubiquitous television. In Iran, 
you can still tackle a subject in a fresh 
and innocent way and film something with 
the feeling that you are showing it on 
screen for the first time. Iranian film is 
rife with this “first-time”’element, and it’s 
what gives it special strength. Filmmakers 
in Taiwan work under different condi- 
tions, but they too have managed to get 
down to basics by delving into their coun- 
try’s past and casting light on a society 
that sometimes doubts its very existence. 
You can’t say the same for the Japa- 
nese film industry, which has a long history 
and is now rivalled by a fast-growing 
audio-visual world of TV channels and 
video games. There’s no room for inno- 
cence here, only crafty, intelligent and 
subversive use of current formats. Direc- 
tors from Japan and Hong Kong borrow 
advertising, video and other well-worn 
techniques to tell other stories and spark 
a different set of emotions. 
This upsurge of “new waves” may be 
related to the general decline or disap- 
pearance of government subsidies for 
filmmaking. Apart from the United States, 
where such help isn’t needed because of 
the captive domestic market, government 
aid to local film industries has dried up in 
most countries. The subsidies that remain 
have in any case stagnated, with money 
nearly always going to the same places. It 
would be tremendous if governments 
were to back something that has now 
begun to flower naturally in so many parts 
of the world. 
A lack of state support has perhaps 
given rise to another trend. This is the 
rise of new producers, individuals and 
institutions working without any national 
anchoring. It’s another form of globali- 
zation, aimed at specific film projects 
satisfying particular desires and needs, 
bringing together people who share a 
love for a special kind of cinema and a 
wish to see something different to the 
deathless fare served up by giant distri- 
bution chains. [|

ALAIN JALLADEAU 
   
 
inema is alive and 
well, and filmmakers 
are still surprising 
and enthusing us. 
More often than not, 
the most promising come from 
Asia, the continent at the head 
of a new cinematic move- 
ment. The quality of films 
being made in this vast 
region is improving all the 
time, and new talents are cropping 
up to compete with American and 
European directors. 
The 2000 Cannes Film Festival 
underscored this extraordinary vita- 
lity. Iran’s Samira Makhmalbaf and 
her wandering teachers in Black- 
boards pushed out some highly 
sophisticated competitors, such as 
the American Coen brothers’ 
ironic O Brother Where Art 
Thou? Danish director Lars von 
Trier may have won the Golden 
Palm for his very nordic Dancer 
in the Dark, but China’s Jiang 
Wen took the Grand Prix, Tony

for Best Director. The Locarno Film Festival 
confirmed the trend in August by awarding its 
Golden Leopard prize to Chinese director Wang 
Shuo’s Baba and the Silver Leopard to Hong Kong's 
Fruit Chan for Little Cheung. Asian films also figured 
prominently at the Venice Film Festival in Sep- 
tember, with The Circle by Iranian director Jafar 
Panahi reaping the Golden Lion. 
Such surges of new talent are nothing new in 
cinema. In the early 1960s, the “new wave” in the 
French film industry provided the paradigmatic 
example of how this could be done. Since then, 
there have seen many such creative rebellions—in 
Poland (Roman Polanski, Jerzy Skolimowski), Cze- 
choslovakia (Milos Forman, Ivan Passer), Japan 
(Nagisa Oshima, Shohei Imamura) and Brazil 
(Glauber Rocha,Ruy Guerra). 
Wherever they arise, these new waves—since the 
term has become part of our basic vocabulary— 
share common traits They reflect a protest against 
traditional concepts of filmmaking, led by artists 
calling for greater freedom of expression as a way 
of escaping from the straightjacket imposed by the 
film industry of that time. A few strong personalities 
carry others with them, a movement takes shape and 
then blossoms. 
But today one factor has changed in the equa- 
tion: the American movie business has since streng- 
thened its grip and taken over nearly all the cinemas 
around the world. Its commercial strength remains 
unrivalled, even though the quest for domination 
has badly eroded the creativity of American film.It 
would be hard to find the modern equivalent of a 
John Cassavetes, whose emblematic Shadows (1960) 
inspired a whole generation of filmmakers.

THE RAGE FOR ASIAN CINEMA 
 
  
In the face of this U.S. juggernaut, how have 
today’s new waves managed to take hold the world 
over? First of all, they have been recognized by 
international critics, who have always done the spa- 
dework when it comes to spotting new talents. One 
need only remember the pivotal role played by 
Henri Langlois, head of France’s National Film 
Library, critics like André Bazin,directors such as 
Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut and a whole 
team of “Young Turks” at the French Cahiers du 
Cinéma magazine in bringing to light a pack of 
directors from the U.S., Japan,India,the ex-Soviet 
Union,Scandinavia and elsewhere. 
Freshness and simplicity: 
the keys to Iranian success 
Film festivals, such as Cannes, Venice, Berlin, 
London and Nantes, sought out new high-quality 
work to enhance their programmes, helping impor- 
tant filmmakers get established. Obviously, neither 
critics nor festivals can create new cinematic move- 
ments. But they can give them the chance to break 
through and enable directors to continue making 
films, while sometimes even attracting support from 
authorities in their home countries. 
Taiwan's case is instructive. The Three Conti- 
nents Festival in Nantes (France) gave prizes in 
1984 and 1985 to two films by Taiwanese director 
Hou Hsiao-hsien, who went on to win international 
acclaim. The Taiwanese authorities then decided 
to back the most promising directors and help spur 
the growth of a new film industry. Unfortunately, this 
policy was soon abandoned. Hou, Yang and Tsai 
Ming-liang have enough of a reputation to raise 
backing abroad, but for younger filmmakers, things 
are much tougher (see page 33). 
Although American hegemony has had devas- 
tating effects in some Asian countries (in Indo- 
nesia, for example, American companies control 
99 per cent of distribution and have stifled local 
film-making), the continent’s overall scene is one of 
buzzing creativity. 
Iran provides the finest example of dynamic 
cinema. Modern Iranian films are enrapturing, with 
an element of surprise and a human sensitivity that 
is hard to find in American movies. A sense of fre- 
shness and simplicity explain the appeal of these 
films. The country was producing such films long 
before the ayatollahs took power in 1979 (see page 
26). In the 1970s, Abbas Kiarostami had already 
made such remarkable films as Traveller (1974) and 
The Report (1977). But it was not until the 1988 
Three Continents Festival that a Kiarostami film,in 
this case Where is the Friend's Home (1987), was 
shown outside Iran. The new government had done 
nothing to help the industry sell its films abroad, and 
few festivals were able to show the works of Iranian 
directors. It took many years for people to realize 
TO EAST 
how creative their films were, and how filmmakers 
had managed to overcome censorship with a strong, 
personal and original style. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan 
stands out as a leader in the creative arts. Beginning 
with a Hollywood-style big studio system, its golden 
age, in my opinion, has never won the recognition it 
truly deserved. In the 1950s, Japan was producing 
about 650 films a year—more than the United 
States—and could boast great directors like Kenji 
Misogushi, Yasujiro Ozu, Mikio  
Naruse, Akira Kurosawa, whose 
talents were sometimes slow to be 
recognized. As the big studios 
declined and these directors disap- 
peared, another generation arose, 
including names such as Nagisa 
Oshima and Shohei Imamura, who 
expressed themselves with greater 
freedom by tackling subjects that 
were more social and violent. Today 
the country is turning out a new wave of provoca- 
tive directors like Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinji Aoyama, 
and Shinya Tsukamoto (see page 28). 
These new film movements—and there are 
many more, such as in South Korea (page 31) and 
Argentina (page 35)—guarantee cinema’s survival. 
Critics and festivals have not invented them. They 
are simply helping such work reach audiences eager 
to support quality films. So long as this continues, 
there is reason to remain optimistic. n 
Cinema is, of course, 
the most 
international art.

Soviet film director 
(1898-1948)   
THE THREE CONTINENTS FESTIVAL  
reated in 1979 in Nantes (France) by brothers Philippe and Alain Jalladeau,who 
were both inspired by a love for cinema and travel,the Three Continents Festival 
became the very first in the world devoted to Asian, African and Latin American cinema, 
and has so far showcased over 1,000 films. By including premieres of feature films, 
retrospectives of noted directors, tributes to an actor or actress and programmes of 
films from just one country, the festival has provided a host of different ways to gauge 
the movements of world cinema. This year's event will take place from November 21- 
28. 
The selection panel chooses films that reflect the social, historical and cultural conditions 
of the three continents. From Uzbekistan to Iran, Palestine to Egypt, Mali to Niger, India 
to China, passing on the way through Korea, Brazil and Bolivia, the festival never fails 
to present radically different cinematic points of view. By discovering the first films of 
a number of directors, the festival has also helped win recognition for some of cinema's 
most distinctive new auteurs: Malis Souleymane Cissé, China's Chen Kiage, Iran's 
Abbas Kiarostami, Taiwan's Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang and Kazakhstan's 
Darezhan Omirbayev. The festival has also contributed to the renown of Indian directors 
like Satyajit Ray, Ritwick Ghatak and Guru Dutt, Japanese director Shohei Imamura, and 
Brazilian Pereira dos Santos. [|

### 120761: Breathless West: brilliant East

Breathless West, 
brilliant East 
Economic value dominates everything in the West, and cinema is no exception. Made for 
profit, moulded by television, most movies have become pure entertainment. The results 
are a big turn-off 
very film-buff in Europe knows the name 
of Paulo Branco, a renowned Portuguese 
producer who has worked with Manoel de 
Olivera, Raul Ruiz and Chantal 
Ackerman, directors whose idiosyncratic 
styles have helped keep independent cinema afloat. 
Branco’s views of current American and European 
cinema have become clouded with pessimism: Wes- 
tern cinema, he says, “has slipped into a kind of 
comfort level,while filmmakers from China,Hong 
Kong, Taiwan,and Korea have had to struggle and 
use their imagination,which gives their films edge 
and audacity.” 
The dominance of economic values and the 
search for prosperity in the West appears to have 
deprived the region’s filmmakers of creative muscle. 
In contrast, Asia’s political, economic and social 
upheavals have bred a cultural tension reflected in 
  
its flourishing, dynamic cinema. “The culture is chan- 
ging enormously, and telling stories is a way of dea- 
ling with the changes,” declares Piers Handling, 
director of the Toronto Festival. “Look at post 1917 
Russia,post-World War I Germany, post-World War 
IT Ttaly, post-1959 Cuba, post-colonial France in the 
late 50s—all started producing dynamic films. This 
energy tends to be dispersed when things are going 
well. Hollywood's Golden Age in the 30s and 40s was 
largely due to a flood of talent from Europe, people 
running away from communism or fascism and fin- 
ding themselves in a country full of immigrants.” 
New York critic Dave Kehr, who sits on the 
selection committee of the Lincoln Center’s New 
York Film Festival, feels the same. In his opinion, the 
vitality of Eastern cinema may have something to do 
with these countries’ resistance to post-modernist 
irony and self reference. “They take their stories and

their genres seriously, whereas the West has lost 
belief in the old formulas without finding anything 
viable to replace them.” 
But Gilles Jacob, president of the Cannes fes- 
tival—which this year awarded its Golden Palm to 
Danish director Lars Von Trier’s deeply northern 
Dancer in the Dark and prizes to three Chinese 
films and young Iranian director Samira Makh- 
malbaf—remains to be convinced of such a cate- 
gorical difference. “Iranian cinema is poetic, fresh. 
The consecration of Asian cinema is happening 
now, but the movement has been growing for years; 
Kiarostami is almost 60. The jury’s choice, however, 
doesn’t diminish the value of other cinemas. French 
cinema is also on the rise.” 
After years of failing to recognize filmmakers 
from the East,the West now seems only too ready 
to welcome them with open arms. “For years we pre- 
tended we could ignore anything that wasn’t Ame- 
rican, European, and sometimes Japanese,” says 
Marco Muller, who recently left his post as director 
of the Locarno festival and co-produced Makh- 
malbaf’s Blackboards and Zhang Yuan's Seventeen 
Years. “We all have a debt towards U.S. cinema 
because it’s the first syntax we were exposed to, 
but now, we're being exposed to others from Asia, 
Africa and Latin America. The Cannes and Toronto 
festivals established credibility for these films. It’s 
not just story telling, but a different film universe 
that has been shaping up in the past two decades. 
Western reality desperately needed an injection of 
something new and that has come from those who 
have been shut out by the industry.” 
In the United States, meanwhile, business values 
and the power of the studios have only served to 
squeeze diversity out of film production. “In 
Europe,” says Paulo Branco, “we’re all indepen- 
dent; in America, even Martin Scorcese, who started 
out independent, knows how to handle being recu- 
perated by the system.” 
Foreign films: the desperate 
search for distributors 
And America does notreally have auteurs, French 
producer Francesca Feder learnt in New York’s Spa- 
nish Harlem, where she made Raphael Nadjari’s The 
Shade. “In America, you have kilos of film school 
movies shown at Sundance, a festival that is like a mar- 
keting machine. They look like studio movies made 
with less money. Miramax buys a couple, and the 
fledgling director graduates to the studio.” 
Annette Insdorf, in charge of cinema studies at 
Columbia University, disagrees, remarking that des- 
pite the appetite for Asian cinema, U.S. indepen- 
dents flourish while films from other countries like 
Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Italy and Germany that 
dominated festivals in previous decades are much 
less visible. “Independent films in the U.S. are being 
produced in larger quantities, thanks partly to digital 
video and new venues like Showtime on TV. But 
foreign language films are having a harder time in 
the U.S. partly because independent American films 
are flooding the market.” 
Her view is echoed by Jacques Bidou, a Paris- 
based producer who worked with Haitian Raoul 
Peck on Lumumba and Cambodian Rithy Panh 
on Un soir apres la guerre (One evening after the 
war). Bidou acknowledges that independent Ame- 
rican films still have the advantages of language and 
a larger scope: “The volume of American films that 
invade theatres and television in Europe prevents 
distribution of those made by other nations,” he 
says. “The problem is not creativity, it’s distribution. 
We see movements in China, Taiwan, Japanese and 
Korea, countries in which national films have an 
audience. But when the market is so small, the film 
needs foreign distribution. Television doesn’t buy 
foreign language films, and distributors won’t take 
the risk.” 
The most visually 
overwhelmed generation 
Television’s strong-arm in production has cer- 
tainly cut into filmmaking ambition, dictating the 
nature of movies even down to the casting. Piers 
Handling (director of the Toronto festival) feels 
that Western cinema is now almost 
 
totally oriented towards the market- 
place and the notion of providing 
entertainment. “Western audiences 
have been devastated by the impact 
of television—they are the most 
visually overwhelmed generation in 
history, so their idea of what consti- 
tutes the moving image experience is 
a dumbed-down version of life. To 
get them to pay attention you cannot 
give them small, intimate stories about real people— 
too boring and underwhelming—you have to give 
them sensation.” As a result, Handling’s Toronto fes- 
tival, which is non-competitive, has picked up on new 
trends in world cinema and drawn films from cul- 
tures that he argues “are not yet media-saturated, 
that still have a literary or verbal culture, such as Iran 
and China, and are making the best films in the 
world.” 
Yet hope remains for the Western film industry, 
argues Gilles Jacob, insisting that there is still 
money to make more challenging movies. “Cinema 
is always in the red, globally speaking,” he says, 
“We have to put fresh money into the system and 
we need new people, like Francis Bouygues, who 
launched Ciby 2000.” Over the past few years, Ciby 
2000—a French production company—has co-pro- 
duced films by David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino 
and Pedro Almodovar. The international trend for 
French producers has developed even further: 
Humbert Balsan produces Egyptian Youssef Cha- 
hine and Yousri Nasrallah, as well as Sandrine 
Veysset; Marin Karmitz produces American inde- 
pendent Johnathan Nossiter and Austrian Michael 
Haneke; while Michel Propper produced Israeli 
Amos Gitai and Peter Brook of Britain. With 
several critical and commercial successes under 
its belt, cinema’s alternative globalization appears 
well underway. n

And cinema is truth

and 1998, the annual number of movie-goers fell to less than

### 120763: After the revolution: the cinema will carry us

After the revolution: 
the cinema will carry us 
Cinema was authorized by the Islamic Republic for propaganda purposes, but a new 
generation of directors is offering the world a very different image of Iran   MAMAD HAGHIGHAT 
26 The Unesco Courier - October 2000 
IRANIAN FILM CRITICAND HISTORIAN, AUTHOR OF HISTOIRE DU CINEMA IRANIEN, 
(“A History oF IRANIAN CINEMA"), PUBLISHEDBYTHE GEORGE Pompipou CENTRE IN 1999 
n Iran,cinema did not become legitimate (in 
the eyes of believers) until the revolution of 
February 1979. Before that political upheaval, 
which stemmed from widespread dissatisfac- 
tion with the Shah’s regime and resulted in an 
“Islamic Republic” headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, the seventh art had drawn thundering 
condemnation from the clergy. 
Movies first appeared in Iran at the start of the 
twentieth century, and Muslim clerics voiced their 
opposition to the new art form as soon as the first 
theatres opened in Tehran in 1904. Several cinemas 
were burned down, with sometimes tragic conse- 
quences:in August 1978,400 people lost their lives 
at the Rex in the city of Abadan.Mullahs believed 
the movie theatre to be a symbol of the godless 
West and a competitor to the mosque, thus making 
it a direct threat to their power. Furthermore, movies 
were considered blasphemous because they fea- 
tured images of women without veils and, later, 
scenes of dancing accompanied by music. 
Fanatical believers could not tolerate the icono- 
graphical portrayal of humans: God alone is the 
“Creator” and the “Craftsman” of living beings. 
Mosque decorations, especially in Iran, contain no 
figurative representations, and for centuries the 
power of words dominated Iranian society. Without 
any tradition of visual artistic expression (with the 
exception of miniatures in the 14th and 15th centu- 
ries), “imaginative” representation became the 
domain of writers and, above all, poets. 
Between 1930 and 1979, approximately 1,100 
feature films were shown in 420 theatres, but not one 
of them met with the ayatollahs’ approval. Rigidly 
views have been transformed by cinema.

### 120763: After the revolution: the cinema will carry us

THE RAGE FOR ASIAN CINEMA 
 
Muslim parents even beat their children for going to 
the movies. But when Khomeini took power, a 
strange reversal occurred. Overnight, the cinema 
became of interest to everybody, including the cle- 
rics. As in other areas, the new regime took control 
of everything. It confiscated images and made its own 
visual style omnipresent on television, in newspapers, 
on walls and in movie theatres. The blessed and 
purified seventh art had won its legitimacy, though 
foreign cinema, which flies in the face of Islamic 
values, was banned. As a result, the national film 
industry had no competitors on Iranian soil. 
During his exile in France, Ayatollah Khomeini 
had become aware of the image’s role as an effec 
tive political propaganda tool. Back in Tehran, he 
saw Dariush Mehrjui’s film The Cow (1969) on 
television. The film, with a style close to realism, 
focuses on the troubled lives of impoverished far- 
mers in a remote village, where one character iden- 
tifies with his dead cow, the only property he owns. 
This movie inspired the religious leader to make a 
speech on the educational role of film. 
Setting the wheels 
of dissent in motion 
As early as the first year of the revolution, all parts 
of the state worked hard to create an “Islamic 
cinema” that would move in “the right direction.” At 
the very same time, a rival style of cinema, drawing 
on the tradition of high-quality filmmaking from 
before 1979, was also born. A few filmmakers 
managed to create a language that skirted around the 
relentless censorship, drawing inspiration from eve- 
ryday life (through a fusion between documentary 
and fiction) and from Persian poetry. The freshness 
and innocence of their films struck a chord with the 
public. The film directors also learned to play one 
state body against another, especially as the various 
appoined officials changed position frequently. 
The new cinema’s leading representative, Abbas 
Kiarostami, who also co-founded the filmmaking 
department at the Institute for the Intellectual 
Development of Children and Young Adults in 
1969, uses his camera to challenge Khomeini’s cine- 
matic precepts. As Iran and Iraq braced for a par- 
ticularly murderous war (1980-1988), the new 
regime, after just a few months of nascent demo- 
cracy, took a much harder line. In this grim context, 
Abbas Kiarostami made at the end of 1979 Alter- 
native 1, Alternative 2, an indictment of informers 
that lays bare the ineptitude of various social classes, 
including the clergy. The movie was banned and 
never approved for release. But Kiarostami, who 
says that he is a secular director, had set the wheels 
in motion of a form of filmmaking that would prove 
a formidable adversary to the regime. 
Kiarostami’s films criticized the mullahs’ hold 
over society. In Homework (1990), he attacked the 
brainwashing of children. Then, with Taste of Cherry 
(1997), he focused on suicide, which is against Islamic 
law, and whose causes must be sought in people’s 
despair over Iran’s rigid social structures. Another 
barrier fell with The Wind Will Carry Us (1999), 
which casts doubt on the existence of an after-life. 
Kiarostami is not the only director to have chal- 
lenged Iranian society. In Bashu, The Little Stranger 
(1987), Bahram Beyzai condemned the terrible conse- 
quences of the holy war against Iraq. So did Mohsen 
Makhmalbaf in Marriage of the Blessed (1989). Amir 
Naderi focused on the authorities’ attitude towards 
soldiers missing-in-action at the beginning of the war, 
which he gave an alternative account of in the as yet 
unreleased Search 2. With The Runner (1985),Naderi 
became the first director since the revolution to give 
leading parts to children, who went on to become 
some of [ran’s most popular movie “actors”. 
This is noteworthy because 
Iran is undergoing a demographic 
boom. The population has nearly 
doubled in the past 20 years, and 
almost half of all Iranians are 
under 20. Film directors noticed 1999 
that the authorities were failing 
to take these figures seriously, 
and—drawing on the saying that 
words of truth come from the 
1998: 
mouths of babes—they cast chil- 50 
dren to explore facets of everyday 
life. - 
From a whimsical cinematic 
style partly based on Egyptian o0- 
and Indian B-movies, Iranian films 50 
made the transition to something 
between “Italian neo-realism” and 
“French new wave,” shattering 
taboos and washing Iran’s dirty 
laundry in public. Worst of all in 1988: 51.9 
the mullahs’ eyes, this new cinema 1998: 65.8 
captured the imagination and the NUMBER OF SCREENS 
talent of the regime’s apologists. 1988: 279 
1998: 285 The most stunning example of this 
is Mohsen Makhmalbaf. A pure 
product of the protests that 
marked the end of the Shah’s rule, 
he spent four years in jail before 
being released in 1979. He was 
fully committed to the new regime 
and directed the Islamic Artistic 
Theatre Centre, a propaganda 
organization, before gradually moving towards 
cinema. With the complete trust of the authorities, he 
then directed The Peddler (1987), which caused a 
sensation by openly criticizing the regime and 
denouncing the “lies of the mosque.” When journa- 
lists asked him, “Makhmalbaf, what have you 
become? Are you stepping out of line?” he replied, 
“I’ve discovered cinema, and it has changed the way 
I'look at the world.” 
On a trip to Europe, Makhmalbaf was so deeply 
moved by Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire that he 
made blasphemous remarks on his return to Iran. “If 
God must send a new prophet, his name will be 
Wim Wenders,” he declared. He then made a film 
available.

challenging the dogma of Islamic society, Time of 
Love (1990), about an affair between a married 
woman and her lover. Contrary to all expectations, 
the movie was shown at the Tehran film festival 
the same year, where it drew huge crowds in just a 
few screenings (though it was not cleared for general 
release). That event, in part, cost Makhmalbaf his 
position at the Ministry of Culture, which at the 
time was headed by none other than the current pre- 
sident, Mohammad Khatami. 
The 1990s marked a turning point. The West was 
surprised to discover a different Iran at film festivals, 
with Iranian movies addressing themes such as friend- 
ship, tolerance and togetherness. A time of honours 
and awards had begun. “Once, Iran exported oil, 
rugs and pistachios. Now it can add movies to the list. 
Iran exports its culture, which is a good thing,” said 
Kiarostami, who won the 1997 Golden Palm at 
Cannes for Taste of Cherry. In 2000, three Iranian 
filmmakers won prizes at Cannes, including Makh- 
malbaf’s 20-year-old daughter, Samira, the youngest 
award-winner in the festival’s history, for Black- 
boards. Bahman Ghobadi, meanwhile, won the 
Golden Camera award for A Time for Drunken 
Horses and Hassan Yektapanah for Djomeh. 
Iran is a veritable breeding ground for fresh 
cinematic talent. Today, around 20 gifted directors, 
including Kiarostami, Makhmalbaf;, Jalili, Mehrjui, 
Beyzai, Forozesh, Naderi and Panahi, make 15 per 
cent of the 60 films that the country produces each 
year. The limits of this cinema, which is shattering 
the last taboos, are still unknown. 
For the first time, a feature film, The Circle, which 
reaped the Golden Lion at the 2000 Venice Film Fes- 
tival, deals with prostitution, a topic that had pre- 
viously been totally off-limits in the Islamic republic. 
Forty-year-old Jafar Panahi, who had already won 
the Golden Camera award at Cannes in 1995 for The 
White Balloon, made this outstanding film without 
even submitting the script to Iran’s censorship com- 
mittee. A willingness to test the regime’s limits can also 
be witnessed among writers and journalists, some of 
whom were killed or imprisoned in 1999. Arrests 
have continued since the beginning of the year. 
Female directors have encountered even more 
hurdles, but they too have found a place behind 
the camera in making films about the condition of 
women. For example, Rakhshan Banni-Etemad, 
Tahminé Milani and a dozen or so others are making 
names for themselves in Iran’s “macho-Islamic” 
society. Young Iranian exiles who studied in the 
West are also going back home, bringing a different 
vision of Iran with them. For example Babak 
Payami, who directed the remarkable A Day More, 
a film about love, lived in Canada. 
Iran has adopted the modern imagery coined by 
films. Whether in documentary or fiction, Iranian 
cinema has liberated itself and become part of peo- 
ple’s day-to-day lives. All Iranians are now spell- 
bound by images “whether it is a just image or just 
an image,” to borrow the expression of French 
director Jean-Luc Godard. n 
 


### 120764: Shooting on a shoestring

Shooting on a shoestring 
Young Japanese producers are stretching tight budgets to produce a wave of often dark 
films while the big studios, fattened by prosperity, are falling on hard times 
  BRICE PEDROLETTI

FRENCH JOURNALIST BASED IN TOKYO 
he tiny bar in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district has 
barely changed over the past 50 years. Its 
owner keeps a careful eye on the rows of 
whisky bottles that line the ancient dive’s 
walls, each bottle bearing the name of a 
filmmaker from somewhere across the world. Every 
time one of these illustrious guests passes through 
Tokyo, they find their private bottle waiting, intact. 
For Masaki Tamura, a famous director of photo- 
graphy who worked with the big names in documen- 
tary and fiction films in the 1970s and 1980s, the bar is 
a favourite hangout when taking a break between 
two shoots. One day in the early 1990s, however, in the 
middle of a shoot with a famous director, Tamura’s 
patience with movie-making finally broke. “I was sick 
of the old methods The approach was too conven- 
tional. I wanted to give up film and I didn’t work for 
the next three years. I thought it was all over for me.” 
That is until he met Shinji Aoyama and did 
camera work for his first film, Helpless. “During the 
shoot, everybody knew how to do everyone else’s 
job,” he says. “You had to because the budget was so 
small. It was a miracle how we managed to make a 
three-hour film in cinemascope with so little money.” 
At 61, with a moustache, shock of grey hair, sensi- 
tive face and calm voice of a character from a Yasujiro 
Ozu film, Tomura describes his new career as a conver- 
sion. “At first, I didn’t understand the film language 
these young people used. The way they worked was 
new to me. Ideas come from all sides. Everyone has

  yi 
something to say and we discuss everything together. 
But I got used to it and now I speak that language.” For 
the past five years, Tamura has been working exclusi- 
vely with this young generation, whose creative energy 
has given new life to Japan's battered film industry. 
These filmmakers are all between 20 and 40 years 
old, and produce their films with extremely limited 
resources in the world’s most expensive city. Some of 
them have worked in television, advertising or car- 
toons, and hold down several jobs to make ends 
meet. They tend to focus on social and psycholo- 
gical themes, like delinquency and mindless crime, 
which mirror the confusion and malaise of a gene- 
ration that has rejected the old ambitions of getting 
rich, blind loyalty to one’s employer and social har- 
mony. 
Without access to major distribution networks, 
they make do in a ghetto of art cinemas where com- 
petition is fierce: this new genre can never earn much 
money. Financing the productions is also a night- 
mare, with budgets ranging from $100,000 to a million 
dollars. Most do not even have an inter-negative ver- 
sion (from which copies can be made without dama- 
ging the master)—a common sacrifice made by 
makers of short films elsewhere. 
“I often have to go into debt to get the film 
started,” says Shinya Tsukamoto. “You start shooting 
with the crew working for nothing and hoping to 
get paid later. Then I show the rushes to video editors 
to try to get them to invest in the film.” Making fan- 
tasy films in the tradition of the Frenchman Georges 
Mélies, Tsukamoto is a director, cameraman, set- 
designer, actor and producer all rolled into one. 
At 40, he has made six films independently and 
another two for the big studios. It took eight months 
to make Bullet Ballet, his seventh and second-to-last 
film, whose street scenes were largely shot clandes- 
tinely. Like his first films, Tetsuo and Tokyo First, 
Bullet Ballet conveys the vibrant energy of its director, 
| - a 
STEREO EVE THER GIT LE GT QE LET EL ECER TTB 
who depicts the fragile equilibrium of young people 
living on the brink of disaster, in a culture of violence 
from which there is no return. 
Just as in the 1970s, when major studios such as 
Nikkatsu switched to B movies and the soft porn 
works on which many filmmakers cut their teeth, 
today’s producers have made erotic films (pinku 
eiga) and gangster films on budgets even smaller 
than their elders. These video or 16mm productions 
are targetted directly at the video market. 
Kiyoshi Kurosawa continues to make film noir 
on 16mm for video, though he infuses his creations with 
a surprisingly philosophical dimension. The two major 
works of the Revenge II series, Eyes of the Spider and 
Serpent Path (1998), were shot one after the other, each 
in two weeks, with the same crew and

the same actors. The same plot of 
revenge, however, is handled very dif- 
ferently in the two cases. “I don’t mind 
shooting like this,” he says. “In fact it’s 
a luxury to be able to make two ver- 
sions of the same story.” Takashi Miike, 
king of gangster gore films, agrees. 
Takeshi Kitano, big brother to this 
new generation of filmmakers, started 
out in a similar fashion. It was too hard 
being an actor and producer at the same 
time, so he went behind the camera. 
Today his company Office Kitano turns out a steady 
stream of independent films, though he makes most of 
his money by selling to television. 
Never before has a “new wave” in Japanese 
cinema made such a virtue out of necessity. The cur- 
rent generation has set up its own makeshift net- 
work with a freedom unprecedented in the history of 
the nation’s film industry. The French “new wave” of 
the 1960s had little choice but to depend heavily on 
big studio money. So long as the films drew the 
crowds, independent filmmakers and the studio

bosses always found a way of wor- 
king together. 
But falling attendance rates 
combined with an economic down- 
turn has dealt a sharp blow to the 
Japanese industry. The major dis- 
tributors—Toho, Toei and Sho- 
chiko—have brushed aside the 
newcomers and made money by 
filling their cinemas with foreign 
films (70 per cent of total revenue), 
animation (about 20 such films were 
made in 1999) or their own pro- 
ductions. 
As a result, the “new wave” of 
the 1990s had to set up shop, physi- 
cally and figuratively, in a country 
where training had long been the 
preserve of big studios. New film 
and video schools are springing up 
like Eiga Bi Gakko, which was 
founded two years ago by pro- 
ducer Kenzo Horikoshi. Classes 
are often taught by young direc- 
tors, who submit film proposals as 
part of the school programme to 
produce two films each year. Aki- 
hiko Shiota made a couple of 
erotic films before his remarkable 
Moonlight Whispers in 1999, which 
follows three children growing up 
in a city suburb and cost less than 
$200,000. 
“The films are made without any thought of the 
30 The Unesco Courier -October 2000 
big studio network,” says Hirokazu Kore-Eda,who 
directed Wonderful Life. Because they owe favours 
to no-one, the young directors are totally free to 
experiment. For Wonderful Life, Kore-Eda, who was 
trained in documentary production, sent his assistants 
out on a five-month mission to capture on video 
“the best memories” of about 500 elderly people. 
He looked at the rushes, did the casting and then 
contacted those he had chosen to appear in the film. 
Nobuhiro Suwa, director of M/Other, developed 
in three feature-length films a very personal style 
based on improvisation and lengthy shots, some of 
which last over five minutes. H story, his third film,is 
the story of the filming of an imaginary re-make of 
Hiroshima Mon Amour, in which Béatrice Dalle 
plays the original star, Emmanuelle Riva. 
As for Aoyama, his feature film Eureka deals 
with a recurrent theme in 1990s Japanese cinema— 
that of a new life, a transition to an alternative state 
of existence following a traumatic experience. It 
shows three people, a man and two children, who 
have escaped from a bloody hostage-taking episode 
and struggle throughout the film to find their way out 
of a maze of misfortune. 
New outfits upstage 
the big studios 
The technical, stylistic and narrative maturity of 
Eureka, made in black and white cinemascope, stands 
out among other independent films which, despite all 
their energy, sometimes seem laborious productions 
overly concerned with navel-gazing and experi- 
mentation. It is perhaps no accident that the film 
was one of the first produced by Suncent Cinema 
Works, the new company of Takenori Sentoh. The 38- 
year-old producer is seen by many as a pioneer of new 
Japanese cinema. In 1992, he joined the pay-TV 
channel Wowow and gave several beginners their 
first break, including Aoyama for Helpless. Since 
then, Sentoh has produced more than 35 films for 
Wowow and others companies, including some fes- 
tival favourites of recent years. In 1999, he set up 
his own production company, Suncent. 
Distribution is still very difficult in Japan, but 
Sentoh’s success abroad and Kitano’s commercial 
breakthrough have encouraged other centres of 
independent film production, including, ironically, 
the former major distributors Daiei and Nikkatsu. 
Some previously occasional partners of the new 
Japanese cinema (video editors, advertising agen- 
cies and radio and television stations) are now more 
involved in co-production, while countless multi- 
media firms (Little More, Uplink and Gaga, for 
example) are encouraging alternative productions. 
Meanwhile the disintegration of the big-studio 
system is gathering pace. An almost-bankrupt Sho- 
chiku has sold its studios at Ofuna, near Tokyo. 
“This reminds me of the gekokujo,” says the head of 
a film school, referring to 15th and 16th century 
feudal Japan when the serfs took the place of the 
gentry. Sentoh for his part has started hiring banking 
executives and others totally alien to the film 
industry on the condition that they are true film 
fanatics. He has always wondered, he says, “if anyone 
in the mainstream Japanese movie industry even 
likes cinema.” [|

South Korea: 
freedom or love? 
The advent of democracy in South Korea and efforts to defend local film production against

who has made more than 50 films. “They know 
CTR TD SR IRR they wanton. Thats smething now round 
here.” 
WE NR ww -—————— The South Korean film industry is doing extre- 
mely well. It conquered 37 per cent of the domestic 
market in 1999 (up from 25 per cent the previous 
year and 18 per cent in 1997),a total boosted by a 
record 6.5 million people who went to see the film 
Shiri (Titanic only managed a local audience of 4.3 
million). 
With this windfall,the man who made the film, 
Kang Je-gyu, decided to join forces with young film- 
makers, revamp the distribution network and lay the 
groundwork for cooperation between Asian coun- 
tries. New film companies (Sidus, Cinema Service, 
Myung Film, East Film, Bom) are also zeroing in on 
young directors just starting out. Serious money 
from the likes of Mirae Esset, Unikorea, CJ Enter- 
tainment and National Technology Finance is filling 
the gap left by the big industrial conglomerates, 
the chaebol, which pulled out of film financing 
during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. 
It was in the midst of the economic downturn 
that the United States chose to attack the system of 
quotas in place since 1985. The main feature of 
these, one which ensured the industry’s prosperity, 
stipulated that Korean films should be shown in 
cinemas for between 100 and 146 days a year. But 
the reaction from South Korean professionals, 
backed by France, stopped the U.S. campaign in its 
tracks. 
Despite a drop in the number of productions 
caused by the economic crisis, 18 films by first-time 
directors (out of a total of 43 new films) were made 
in 1999 and seven of the year’s 10 most popular 
films were debuts. In 1999, 22 such first films and 10 
second features by new directors were made out of

2. NEW WAVES 
With a final scene that is still tremendously moving, 
the film has become an icon for young directors, ins- 
piring the landmark film of the Korean new wave, 
Lee Jang-ho’s Declaration of Fools (1983). Kil- 
jong’s film depicts a nation’s youth that is innocent 
and full of dreams but shaken by 
the political situation, a youth lon- 
ging for freedom and democracy. 
“The entire South Korean film 
industry suffered from crippling 
1999: censorship,” Lee Doo-yong says.

After filmmaking restrictions

sorship abolished in 1987,a fresh

1988. Park Kwang-su’s A Single

Neo-realism is a 
moral perspective on 
Roberto Rossellini, 
Italian film director 
The Night Before the Strike (1990) 
was just as significant for the then 
bold and militant independent 
cinema. To watch this aesthetically 
unimpressive film in the only place 
it could be seen, a university 
campus, it was best to wear trai- 
ning shoes and know how to run. 
On one occasion 1,700 police plus 
a helicopter turned up to seize a 
copy of the film.In all,a million young people saw 
it even though it was officially banned. 
The film’s producers and directors, like several 
others—such as Lee Eun, Lee Yong-bae, Chang 
Dong-hong and Jang Yun-hyun, along with the critic 
Lee Yong-kwan—advocated links between the film 
world and the working class. Today, they hold impor- 
tant posts in bodies such as the KOFIC, set up to 
encourage film creativity on the model of France’s 
National Film Centre, the CNC. 
Sopyonje set off another revolution in 1993 by 
drawing many more people to the cinema. Through 
a melancholy paean to the disappearing art of tra- 
ditional singing, veteran director Im Kwon-taek, 
who already has 90 films under his belt, took a new 
look at the nation’s painful course since the Japanese 
occupation. This journey through cultural history 
sent a shockwave through audiences. More than a 
million people went to see it, beating all records and 
overshadowing local box office interest in Steven 
Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. 
The enthusiasm for Korean-made films has 
continued. Cinema audiences keep on growing and 
films by first-time directors often draw more than a 
million people. But public interest has shifted, with 
young people between 17 and 25—who make up the 
majority of cinema-goers—becoming the key to 
commercial success. 
A landmark 
for Korean culture 
Yet the film industry’s new vitality, along with the 
growing role of big investors, has not helped all 
directors. Chunhyang, Im Kwon-taek’s latest work, 
which in 2000 became the first Korean film to be offi- 
cially presented at the Cannes festival,was a box- 
office flop. The generation of directors aged over 
50—Lee Doo-yong, who made L'Amour (1999), 
and Bae Chang-ho, director of The Heart (1998)— 
is having big problems making small-budget inde- 
pendent films. Even the granddaddy of the industry, 
75-year-old Sin Sang-ok, cannot complete his film 
The Visit, the tale of a father who discovers his 
daughter working as a bar hostess in Seoul, illus- 
trating the conflict between tradition and the thrus- 
ting materialism of today. 
The times clearly favour young filmmakers ins- 
pired by Hollywood formulas and video-game 
scripts, but independent cinema has not given up yet. 
Since the arrival of democracy, it has simply changed 
its slogans. Instead of “Freedom or death!”it now 
proclaims, as if in reference to the French surrealist 
poet Robert Desnos, “Freedom or love!” 
Films made by this school, such as Spring in My 
Hometown (1998) by Lee Kwang-mo, Peppermint 
Candy (1999) by Lee Chang-dong, Christmas in 
August (1998) by Huh Jing-ho and The Spy (1999) 
by Jang Jin, have spread abroad. The best-known 
director among them, Hong Sang-su, who made 
The Day the Pig Fell Into the Well in 1996, is opti- 
mistic. “I think Korean cinema will stay very inter- 
esting for another decade at least,” he says, pointing 
out that cinema courses in universities draw talented 
students, that many short films are getting shown and 
that movie websites are proliferating. “The cinema 
is going to become the main landmark for Korean 
culture in all its diversity,” he says. “And that’s exci- 
ting.” The release in September of young director 
Park Chan-ook’s new film Joint Security Area, with 
ticket sales of a million in its first three days, shows 
that the issue of reconciliation with North Korea has 
generated even more powerful subject matter. m

f garnering awards at major film festivals like 
Cannes is a sign of good health, then Chinese 
films, or more accurately Chinese-language 
films, are doing splendidly. Mainland China, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong each had a film that 
rage, capturing the fatalism of post-1989 society. 
Allegories based on madness, dysfunctional families 
and above all alienation are major themes. For 
these independents, the biggest headache is seeing 
their films scoop up awards on the festival circuit 
picked up honours at the last Cannes festival— 
Jiang Wen’s Devils on the Doorstep, Edward Yang's 
YiYiand Wong Kai-wai’s In the Mood of Love res- 
pectively—while Ang Lee’s out-of-competition 
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a hit among 
festival-goers. 
Unlike the more mainstream Crouching Tiger, 
however, the other three films have not been released 
on home ground. Devils on the Doorstep, which 
invited the wrath of China’s Film Bureau by travel- 
ling overseas without going through the proper chan- 
nels, probably needs to clear a few hurdles before it 
can see the light of day. In the cases of Yi Yiand In the 
Mood of Love, the reasons are commercial: neither 
film is expected to do well at the box-office, and dis- 
tributors are moving cautiously. Strangely, the soils 
that produce these films do not seem particularly 
congenial to serious cinema. Scrutiny of these movies’ 
financing in fact reveals that apart from Devils, all are 
international co-productions. 
The People’s Republic to this day keeps a tight 
rein over filmmaking and parrots the dogma 
“cinema must serve the people.” But this constraint 
has been perversely undermined by modern China’s 
obsession with its historical destiny. “Fifth Genera- 
tion” filmmakers such as Chen Kaige and Zhang 
Yimou portray China’s past, and are faithful to the 
dictums of 1930s “progressive” Chinese cinema in 
using history to dissect the failings of the present. 
But “Sixth Generation” filmmakers, who arrived 
on the scene in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen 
uprising, trumpet a very different sense of aesthe- 
tics. Working without official approval, early films 
like Zhang Yuan's Mama (1991) and He Jianjun’s 
Red Beads (1993) seethe with inwardly directed 
while remaining largely unseen in China itself. 
The two currents—historical 
and contemporary—look set to 
join in Jia Zhangke’s new film 
Platform. A richly layered work, it 
observes the lives of young people 
in a provincial music troupe as 
they fall in love and are hurtled 
into the vast unknown of China’s 
modernization. Over three hours 
long but with less than a hundred 
shots, the film is unprecedented 
in mainland Chinese cinema. 
Taiwanese films, meanwhile, 
have won international recogni- 
tion even though the island’s film 
industry has been in decline, with 
annual output dwindling to 20 
films and funding coming from 
the government or abroad. Yet 
Taiwan still manages to produce 
some of the world’s best filmma- 
kers, including Hou Hsiao-hsien, 
Edward Yang, Tsai Ming-liang 
and Ang Lee—a film-maker with 
stronger mass appeal than his 
peers and a track record in light 
comedy ( Eat Drink Man Woman), 
adaptations of classic novels 
(Sense and Sensibility) and, with 
Crouching Tiger, old-school 
swordplay. 
Similar financial concerns 
abound in Hong Kong, home to 
headline-grabbing art-house

### 120767: Don't blink now, it's Kazakhstan

2. NEW WAVES 
DON'T BLINK NOW, IT'S KAZAKHSTAN  
he Kazakh film industry was a ship in the night.It raised a few hopes, 
but now it's vanishing. 
At the end of the 1980s, cinema was the first cultural activity in Kazakhs- 
tan to feel the currents of freedom that Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of per- 
estroika had unleashed.A dozen young filmmakers who had trained at 
Moscow's prestigious VGIK film school returned home in 1987,including 
Serik Aprimov, Darezhan Omirbayev, Amir Karakulov, Talgat Temenov, all of 
whom would soon be winning prizes in major film festivals. 
The story of the country’s film industry began with Rashid Nugmanov’s 
1988 film The Needle, which was a big hit all over the then Soviet Union and 
one of the first films to break the taboo of talking about drug addiction. Next 
came Aprimov’s Terminus, a film depicting the absurdity of daily life in a 
Kazakh village. 
These films set a realist tone, and the works that followed—many of them 
autobiographical—claim to follow in the tracks of France's “new wave.” 
With their almost documentary styles and ingenuous touches, these films 
gave directors the freedom to say exactly what they felt. 
The period after perestroika and then independence in 1991 proved quite 
a good time for artists. Government continued to subsidize the film indus- 
try and more than 30 private studios sprang up. But most of these have 
since disappeared due to a lack of cash.In 1994,Kazakhstan (with its 16 
million inhabitants) turned out about a dozen films. By 2000 this had fal- 
len to only a handful. 
Working conditions are tough, with no laws to encourage private film pro- 
duction, old-fashioned studio equipment, virtually non-existent distribution 
networks and a public with little money to spend on going to the cinema. 
Filmmakers have also lost their prestige. The unity of style and subject of the 
early days has gradually faded, and local films were quickly eclipsed by 
American imports. 
Everyone has adjusted to the new situation in their own way. The luckiest 
filmmakers, such as Omirbayev and Aprimoy, have found foreign produc 
tion partners—in France and Japan—while others are making advertise- 
ments or mortgaging their apartments. [|

> directors like Fruit Chan and Stanley Kwan. The 
interdependence of mainstream and non-mains- 
tream cinema is perhaps most prominent here: 
Chan and Kwan came through the ranks of com- 
mercial cinema during the mid-and late-1980s, 
when the industry was enjoying a golden age. 
Now, however, these directors have to seek finan- 
cing elsewhere. 
With the People’s Republic unlikely to relax 
its control, and Hong Kong unlikely to support 
commercially unviable projects, Chinese-lan- 
guage cinema looks set to follow the Taiwanese 
model of international funding. How this pro- 
cess will impact on “Chinese national cinema” or 
even the idea of national cinema per se will prove 
fascinating to watch. n

A constellation of young directors is touching the “rawness of things in the street” with a

he present is an absurd legacy of the past,” 
says young Argentine filmmaker Pablo 
Trapero. “It’s crazy that a guy of 50 has to 
start from scratch like a kid. That kind of 
absurdity creates a tension [ used to tell the 
story of Rulo.” 
Rulo, the hero of Mundo Griia (Crane World, 
1999), Trapero’s first feature film, is a worker fighting 
to survive. Once, long ago, he had his 15 minutes of 
fame as a member of a rock band, but he is not too 
nostalgic and meekly accepts his daily lot. He quali- 
fies as a crane operator, but is rejected for the job he 
wants after failing a medical. Then a job in the pro- 
vinces comes up, involving driving an excavator at a 
site hundreds of kilometres from Buenos Aires, far 
from friends and family. Rulo puts up with this until 
he gets bored, then returns to Buenos Aires to face an 
uncertain future. There is something noble about this 
man who manages to keep going by clinging to what 
little he has—loyal and unshakeable friendships. 
The 28-year-old Trapero studied film at univer- 
sity,and had only made short films before directing 
Crane World. Shooting stretched out over a year 
since it could only be done when there was enough 
money for equipment and crew, though the gaps 
allowed him to put together sequences and rewrite 
the script as he went along. 
“I wanted a film that was like a hidden camera 
filming snatches of reality,” he says. The film,made 
in semi-documentary style, gives a dramatized view 
of daily life stripped of all pretence. “The crane is for 
all of us a symbol of building the future,” says Tra-

pero.“Rulo wants to have a future but he can’t get 
one.” Everyday life, familiar characters, a bare nar- 
rative and independent production—all are hall- 
marks of other recent Argentine films that have 
borrowed from the John Cassavetes tradition of 
neo-realism and the “new waves”of the 1960s. 
The nearest thing Argentina has previously had 
to this kind of cinema came from the so-called 60s 
Generation group of filmmakers, who trained in art 
cinema and short movies. They called for a break with 
tradition, with the big-studio star system and even 
with “entertainment,” just as their young descen- 
dants in the 1990s have been fighting against the 
hackneyed style of television and other media. The 
critical and public acclaim received by Crane World 
along with its festival successes have shown how 
potent this new genre of films can be. 
Glossing over a troubled 
past enthusiastic revival of Argentine cinema 
in the 1960s was fleeting, but it gave birth to two 
major filmmakers: Leonardo Favio and Hugo San- 
tiago. Several years had to pass, however, before this 
legacy could be built upon. First,the 1976 military 
coup put an end to any chance of making films. 
Then, after democracy was restored in 1983, most 
new films chose to flatter people’s good consciences. 
This soothing, opportunistic genre was epitomized 
by Luis Puenzo’s The Official Version (1984),which 
won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film and tells how 
a woman begins to suspect that her adopted 
daughter is one of the children of people killed by 
the military. The story is not about the girl or her tor- 
things,” says Sapir. “You should 
shoot in a different way and touch 
the rawness of life in the street. We 
have to change cinema by making 
real life into a poem.” 
It all began in 1995 with the 
commercial screening of Histo- 
rias Breves, a collection of short 
films that had won prizes from the 
National Institute of Film and 
Audiovisual Arts. The formula was 
repeated, and gave impetus to 
several young directors—Raul de 
la Torre, Eliseo Subiela, Juan José 
Jusid, Daniel Barone and Beda 
Docampo Feijoo—whose enthu- 
siasm had managed to break 
through a suffocating academic 
milieu. 
Argentina is now turning out 
between 20 and 30 films a year. 
But local showings are not enough 
to recuperate the one to two mil- 
lion dollars each film costs to 
make, a budget that directors are 
unwilling to trim. Rejtman attacks 
this way of thinking, saying it is 
“Important for filmmakers to stop 
thinking about sales strategies and 
start thinking about film strate- 
gies. I'm not saying there’s no 
commercial cinema but we have 
to stop thinking just about that.”

law (1994) was immediately applied in 
the wrong way. Two new taxes—on video- 
cassettes and films broadcast on televi- 
sion—on top of the existing ones (a per- 
centage on every cinema seat sold) were 
meant to help subsidize Argentine films, 
but an economic recession cut proceeds to 
a third of the envisaged amount. Financial 
aid to films on general release, meanwhile, 
was disbursed according to box-office 
receipts. As a result, the animated film 
Manuelita (1999) about a female turtle, 
seen by two million cinema-goers, 
received a much larger subsidy than either 
Crane World or Silvia Prieto, with 68,000 
and 14,000 box-office sales respectively. 
But Trapero is not alone in leading a 
cinematic charge. Martin Rejtman, 
Esteban ~~ Sapir and Adrian 
Caetano/Bruno Stagnaro are also part of 
a movement going by the name of “New 
Argentine Cinema,” which has produced 
the country’s most exciting films in recent 
years. “Films should be about everyday

money by forming co-operatives, not shooting at 
weekends, using natural backdrops and employing

Its enthusiastic reception highlighted a slowly-deve- 
loping trend that had evolved from films such as 
Fine Powder (1996) by Esteban Sapir, which com- 
bined the experimental style of Godard with novel- 
ties from video-art; Garage Olimpo (1999) by Marco 
Bechis, a lucid and painful look at detention centres 
during the military dictatorship; and Mala Epoca 
(1998) by Mariano de Rosa, Nicolas Saad, Rodrigo 
Moreno and Salvador Roseli, which linked a 
number of stories set in a hostile urban context, 
where everyone appears misplaced and unsettled. 
“We film things we’d like to see ourselves as 
film-goers,” says new director Andrés Tambornino. 
Lucrecia Martel, also shooting her first film, says that 
what annoys her about the “dinosaurs” (the previous 
generation of filmmakers) is that they became 
“indifferent and timid,and so ended up using false 
\ metaphors instead of getting out into the street 
and depicting things as they are.” 
The new wave of films cannot be called a move- 
ment. They do not fit a defined set of values and are 
not aesthetically uniform. Their vitality comes from 
— their diversity and their different approaches; they 
share what a country suffered, they share the spirit 
of a generation, the methods of production, the 
personal imprint of the author, the shunning of rhe- 
toric and the concern for identity. They give a blunt 
but impassioned account of Argentina following 
the military dictatorship, in the era of Presidents 
Raul Alfonsin and Carlos Menem. 
A film like Crane World was a hit because it is a 
sombre portrait of people who refuse to abandon 
their hopes. It is this combination of melancholy and 
resistance that connects Rulo with his audience. m

y the time Itamar Franco was elected president of Brazil in 1992, the 
country’s film industry had virtually disappeared.A year later, a new 
broadcasting and cinema law lent filmmakers a lifeline: firms that decided 
to invest in film production were given tax rebates of up to three per cent, 
and investments could be recouped at the box office. 
The Brazilian film industry at once leapt to life. Only two commercial films 
were made in Brazil in 1992.In 1999,there were 33.Subjects have also 
become more varied,and locations diversified.New talent has sprung up 
not just in Rio de Janeiro, but also Sao Paolo, the northeast and the south 
of the country, 
A number of new films, such as Tata Amaral’s A Starry Sky, Beto Brant's 
Belly Up, Bruno Barreto’s Four Days in September, Sergio Rezende's 
Lamarca and Carla Camurati’s Carlota Joaquina, have addressed violence 
and the country’s military dictatorships, while the sertao, or semi-arid nor- 
theast of Brazil—which won renown in the classic Brazilian cinema of the 
1960s through movies such as Nelson Pereira dos Santos’ Barren Lives 
and Glauber Rocha's Black God, White Devil—has been revived as a back- 
drop. 
“You can see in these new films the link between the new wave and tele- 
vision melodrama, which grew in the 1970s and 1980s during a huge 
surge in production,” says critic José Carlos Avellar. Walter Salles’ film Cen - 
tral Station, which won the Golden Bear prize at the 1998 Berlin Film Fes- 
tival, illustrates precisely this connection through the story of a boy looking 
for his father in the sertdo with the help of a female teacher. 
But economic crisis threatens this surge of creativity. “My new film didn't get 
a cent under the 1993 law,” says Salles, currently shooting in the sertao a Bra- 
zilian version of Albanian writer Ismail Kadare’s novel Broken April. 
“The 1993 law has shown itself to be shaky and inadequate,” says Paulo 
Caldas, who has just made a documentary about city life, The Little Prince's 
Rap against the Wicked Souls. Over its first five years, $184 million went on 
film production via the law and only $12.5 million on distribution and 
marketing—a tiny sum in a market dominated by American films. [|

in exile 
Rithy Panh (Cambodia), Alejandra 
Rojo (Argentina) 
and Abderrahmane Sissako 
(Mauritania) have all 
settled in France, but the 
pull of their home

artistic lives 
INTERVIEWS BY SOPHIE BOUKHARI 
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST 
  
ow did you get into film? 
Rithy Panh: It wasn’t something I chose. 
Film came to me when I went into exile 
after what I went through in Cambodia. 
If I'd stayed there, I probably would 
never have become a filmmaker. It isn’t a reco- 
gnized profession there. But I've always been aware 
of the power of images. In Cambodia, lived next 
door to a film studio, so I used to peak in on the 
shoots. 
The Khmer Rouge genocide is a genocide with 
no recorded images except for photos. As such, 
everything is photographed in people’s memories. 
What you've seen and lived through is always run- 
ning through your mind. It was this—the process of 
remembering things—that drew me into film. My 
desire to make them was born here in France. When 
I arrived in 1979, I knew my work would have to 
relate to what had happened in Cambodia. After a 
war, either you keep quiet or you try to piece toge- 
ther what's been shattered. I dabbled in painting and 
writing, and then, one day, someone lent me a 
camera for a party at a vocational college where I 
was taking a carpentry course. Some people made 
cakes for the occasion, I made a little film.I knew

then, at 20, where my vocation stood. I attended 
classes at IDHEC [a prestigious French film school] 
and made my first documentary, Site Number Two, 
about a Cambodian refugee camp. 
Alejandra Rojo: When I was a kid, wanted to 
be a painter. But I was living in a very political envi- 
ronment, not an artistic one. My father was a lawyer 
and my mother a psychoanalyst. When I was about 
15, I lost interest in painting, graduated from high 
school and began studying science. But two years 
later, I dropped all that and decided that I wanted to 
make films. So I followed classes and took the plunge. 
Abderrahmane Sissako: I was brought up in 
Mali and returned to Mauritania to finish high 
school. Right after that, I went off to the Soviet 
Union, like thousands of other African students. It 
was easier to go there than to France. I had a scho- 
larship to study film and I started making my own. 
aA 
 
How did you come to France? 
Panh: Because of the Khmer 
Rouge. I was 17 years old. Many 
members of my family were killed 
and the rest of them fled to France. 
Rojo: I came here when [ was 12, 
as an exile. My father defended poli- 
tical prisoners. The whole family had 
to leave Argentina. It was the time of 
the death squads—22,000 people 
disappeared. We were apparently on 
the target list. 
Sissako: I came in 1993 because 
my film October had been chosen for 
the Cannes Film Festival. I was 
invited to stay here and continue filmmaking. I 
spent 12 years in Russia and now I'm in France. For 
how long, I don’t know. 
  
What are the pros and cons of living outside your 
own country? Does it affect the way you make films? 
Panh: When you're an exile, you don’t really 
have an identity any more. Whether in Cambodia or 
France, I'm kind of at home everywhere and now- 
The films are a 
roadmap through 
emotional and 
intellectual terrain 
that provides a 
solution on how to 
save pain.

ere. Far and close from everything. I'm interested in 
this distance. It allows you to stand back and to see fur- 
ther, to grasp the shape of things. The lesser evil for an 
exile is managing to make use of this. I go back to 
Cambodia and then I leave it again. It’s a natural cycle. 
Coming back to a Paris film studio is somewhat like 
going on a retreat.I recharge my batteries. Cambodia

I made films so my 
mother, who didn’t 
go to school, could 
read the pictures. 
Senegalese film 
director (1943-) 
 
I had a two-week sea voyage and 
then understood what a drop in 
status meant. You were someone 
back home and suddenly you 
became nobody. In the end, that’s 
not such a bad thing. You're less at 
the mercy of your social background. 
You see things from a more personal 
standpoint. Having to work in ano- 
ther language creates a style simply 
because you're not fully in tune with 
what’s being said.I’'m always aware 
of the gap, that what’s one way here would be different 
there. Many immigrants share this feeling of living a 
double life. But as an artist, manage to go beyond this 
stage. A film,a painting, a piece of music are all coun- 
tries in themselves. You don’t need a country once you 
have that.Exile is a moderately interesting life expe- 
rience, but it’s fascinating from a cinematographic 
standpoint.It’s a source of new ideas and stories. Our 
age makes me think of some science fiction stories 
about inter-galactic peoples who move about and 
migrate on a mass scale. When I sit down to write, I 
don’t tell myself that I'm going to write stories about 
exiled people. They just come to me, from deep down 
in my sub-conscious. You don’t make the films you 
want. You make the films that have to be made. 
Sissako: Exile is always a handicap. But distance 
allows you to look at your own country, its past, its 
history from a slightly foreign viewpoint. When we 
talk about home, we tend to hesitate, to go by feel.It’s 
a delicate process that you can lose a grip on at any 
moment. Maybe we have more sensitivity. Sometimes 
you choose to be silent and allow people to interpret. 
What ties do you have with your native country? 
Panh: I've just made my first film in France, a docu- 
mentary about the Cambodian community here. I've also 
shot one film in Mali. I've made all the others in Cam- 
bodia. I'm interested in living with the people there. 
The film nearly becomes secondary. Here, I feel tired and 
stressed. There, the people who have to fight to survive 
give me strength. Survivors always feel guilty. To escape 
from this strange feeling, I need to be with other people. 
The camera lets me do that—lets me say I have words, 
dreams and thoughts to express, that I really belong to 
the world. Film has helped me restore my own dignity. 
In Cambodia, I'm also helping to train filmmakers and 
technicians, with assistance from the Ministry of Culture. 
Over the past 10 years, we've put together a good team. 
Rojo: I don’t go back to Argentina very often. The 
38 The Unesco Courier -October 2000 
last time, I felt I was living in an American colony. 
Here in France, you don’t realize how fast globali- 
zation is racing ahead. The countries of the South are 
becoming colonies, holiday camps or military camps 
of the great American empire. There’s a film to be 
made about that. I'd go back to Argentina to work, 
but that’s all. It’s to do with my family being 
rejected. I don’t see anything too exciting about 
being Argentinian and it’s very hard to feel a cultural 
identity there. It’s a sort of recent patchwork of 
which I'm a good example. My maternal grandmo- 
ther was Lithuanian and her husband was an Egyp- 
tian who spoke Yiddish.My paternal grandfather, 
who was a Spanish Catholic, married a Russian- 
German Protestant. 
Sissako: I often go to Mali and Mauritania— 
usually about twice a year, often to check film loca- 
tions. I go back and forth. Each trip enriches and 
alters the story and each casting changes the film in 
some way. 
Do you have any urge to live in your native country? 
Panh: Definitely. But there’s no movie business 
in Cambodia. It’s easier to find the money in France. 
I raise money here but I keep to small Cambodian- 
scale budgets. 
Rojo: I think there’s something in Latin America 
that’s worth really looking into, but I haven’t found 
it yet. 
Sissako: I know I'll go home one day. I'm in 
France for financial reasons. I'm starting to be 
known and I’m getting some interesting proposals 
from producers and television. It’s very hard to 
work in our countries. Filmmakers are on their own. 
There’s no money to be had,no local film industry, 
no film schools. Africa’s always had this dearth of 
production and things are just getting worse. No 
more than 10 films a year are made on the whole 
continent. You can’t have a ski champion in a 
country where there’s no snow. 
What are your plans? 
Panh: Apart from fiction and documentaries, the 
project closest to my heart is the gathering of a film 
archive on the Cambodian genocide. Over the next 
20 years, the witnesses will either die or their memo- 
ries will become distorted. We live in a society domi- 
nated by images. If we don’t make our own images, 
we won't exist any more. The countries of the South 
are going to die of that too, after already being eco- 
nomically pillaged. 
Rojo: I'm working on a story about a woman 
with a split personality. About a robot that replaces 
a woman. 
Sissako: My next film will be about exile. I'm 
going to try to tell the story of people who apply to 
emigrate, who are waiting to leave. I'd like to show 
that exile begins before the voyage itself. My films 
are often linked to my own life. At the same time, I'll 
try to tell how I got into film. [|

THE RAGE FOR ASIAN CINEMA 
 
  BY YOUSRI NASRALLAH 
EGYPTIAN FILMMAKER, WHOSE LASTFILM 
Er MEDINA WAS SHOWN AT THE LOCARNO FESTIVAL (SWITZERLAND) IN 
1999 
made my fourth and latest feature film, El 
Medina, in digital video on the streets of Cairo 
and in Paris. I was the first Egyptian director to 
make a fiction film using this new technique. 
After the talkies, colour and the advent of 
television, many people see digital video as the 
fourth revolution in the history of cinema. 
It already has talented aficionados such as Lars 
von Trier and the other Danish directors who support 
his Dogma statement of film principles. Their watch- 
words: shoot with a camera on your shoulder, use no 
artificial lighting to be as true to life as possible. Such 
a doctrine could only come from a rich country, where 
creative people need self-imposed restrictions to 
flower. We on the other hand have to cope with autho- 
ritarian regimes and the dead hand of censorship. 
I’ve given up 35mm cameras not out of principle, but 
for practical reasons. My budgets won't allow me to 
do otherwise. 
No easy images 
Pragmatism means first of all not going on about 
the film you might have made. Just do it, with every 
resource you can lay your hands on. I have only one 
rule: I must keep my independence. For my first 
feature, Vols d’Eté (Summer Flights), made in 1988, 
I wanted a star from the Egyptian big-studio system 
to play the wife of a landowner living in the 1950s 
who hated [former Egyptian president, Gamal 
Abdel] Nasser. But she just wouldn't accept the 
part. Her fans wouldn’t understand, she said. Chan- 
ging the script would be to lose my independence. 
So I shot the film with non-professionals—an archi- 
tect,a tourist guide and a journalist. 
Whether it’s amateur actors or digital video, 
once I’ve accepted the limitations that I haven’t 
chosen, have to sort out the problems they bring. 
And that’s what I like. That’s where creation starts. 
Technique is never an artist’s enemy. A painter 
will try goache, oil or wash drawing techniques. 
You and the cinematographer on a film simply want 
the most out of the camera. Unlike 35mm film, 
video doesn’t have depth of field:right close up or 
very far off, you get the same sharp image. To give 
the shots depth,we tried to add as much colour as 
possible, using painted walls and brightly-coloured 
clothing. And we established the film’s visual style 
to suit the story of these people who watch each 
other from their balconies. 


### 120771: Technology: the artist's ally

Technology, 
the artist's ally 
All filmmakers can profit from new technology, says Egyptian director Yousri Nasrallah. The 
only trouble is that it may turn distribution networks upside down 
When a new technology appears, we often start 
by asking the wrong questions. Digital video is 
cheaper, so will it lower artistic standards? Not at all. 
The invention of the pencil didn’t lead to standar- 
dized literature. Young directors have to unders- 
tand that there are no such things as easy images, 
only a less costly way to tackle problems. But the fear 
that new techniques will make things uniform is 
understandable. Digital video has given rise to a 
fashion that says because the cameras are light, you 
ought to run all over the place. But do you remember 
Julien Duvivier’s film The Great Waltz? The camera 
was big as a wardrobe, but it spun round with the 
greatest of ease because the film required it to. Like- 
wise, a video film sometimes requires fixed shots. 
Doubts about new technology tend to centre on 
distribution,because there is talk of cinemas sho- 
wing films beamed in by satellite. For big films, 
shown in thousands of cinemas, this method is jus- 
tified. But the telecommunications giants are trying 
to secure a monopoly. So what will happen then to 
all the “little” films produced in poor countries? 
The power of technology, however, always 
reaches a limit. For many years, we were cut off 
from each other by television and its production 
methods. All of us: viewers, producers and script - 
writers. But look at the credits of Fellini’s or Youssef 
Chahine’s films from the 1950s. There were many 
authors—people who wanted to meet each other 
and talk about life and films. It was wonderful. 
Today young filmmakers are rubbing shoulders, 
working together and fighting against such isolation. 
The same desire is there. And that goes for me too. 
Every film I make, I want to get as many people 
together as I can. n

-. the legal battle was arduous, Gary 
Gilmore eventually got what he had 
longed for on January 17, 1977. Tied by 
ny lon rope to an office chair, with a white 
target disc pinned to his chest, the petty

U.S. death penalty: 
victims seize 
the high ground 
On the eve of the U.S. presidential elections, the death penalty—repudiated by almost all democratic 
nations—is notable only for its absence from debate. Abolitionists are changing their tactics to ‘win 
Union, Amnesty International and other 
moral bulwarks of the West. 
The contrast with the rest of the demo- 
cratic world—of which the United States 
considers itself the leader—is more 
marked on the issue of the death penalty 
than possibly any other aspect of domestic 
policy. While U.S. foreign policy bears 
down on “rogue states,” its executioners 
keep good rhythm with the likes of Iran 
and Iraq (though remain way behind

group leader, China). When a proposed 
worldwide moratorium on the penalty 
came up for debate in the UN Human 
Right Commission in April 1999, the U.S. 
predictably voted against, along with 
Cuba, China, Sudan and nine other 
nations. Some 108 countries, on the other 
hand, have in law or in practice abolished 
the punishment, with Turkmenistan and 
Ukraine among the most recent to enlist. 
The appeal of 
tough justice 
For the average high-level U.S. politi- 
cian,however, the death penalty has only 
minor administrative defects, if any at all. 
Of the four presidential and vice-presi- 
dential candidates lining up in elections 
on November 7, all support the punish- 
ment—from Democrat candidate Al Gore 
to Republican George W Bush, who has 
ratcheted up its use in his last five years as 
Texas governor, granting only one reprieve 
and rubber-stamping 144 executions. Public 
support for the penalty, in spite of a major 
new abolitionist offensive that has helped 
cut approval ratings from a high of 80 per 
cent, still hovers over 60 per cent. 
“I call it the silver bullet, in reference 
to the Lone Ranger [a U.S. television 
series set in the Wild West],” explains 
Robert Bohm, a professor in criminology 
and death penalty expert from the Uni- 
versity of Central Florida. “A lot of people 
in this country who are very fearful of 
crime, whether rationally or not, are loo- 
king for a silver bullet to deal with it—and 
the death penalty is a very attractive 
bullet.” 
A host of arguments, used previously 
by philosophers as venerable as Thomas 
Aquinas and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 
have helped make the penalty an emblem 
of tough justice. Despite a lack of agreed 
data,defenders of capital punishment in 
the U.S. argue that the system is cheap, 
acts as a deterrent and prevents suppo- 
sedly “liberal” parole boards from relea- 
sing jailed murderers into an unsuspecting 
world—a practice that Dudley Sharp, 
from the Justice For All project,says has 
led to 10,000 killings since 1971. Above all 
else, the penalty is vaunted as the only 
true outlet for a society outraged by hei- 
nous crimes; as Rousseau wrote, “in 
killing the criminal, we destroy not so 
much a citizen as an enemy.” 
In response, a new generation of abo- 
litionists has quietly shed its moral indi- 
gnation. No longer are the lives of serial 
killers and sociopaths held to be inhe- 
rently worth preserving. Instead,press- 
friendly groups like the Death Penalty 
Information Centre stress the injustices 
of its application, from the racial inequi- 
ties that it breeds to the risk that inno- 
cents might be slaughtered. 
For the Centre’s director, Richard 
Dieter, this strategy aims to conquer 
America’s famed middle ground, that 
majority of people who seem to support 
the penalty without great conviction or 
passion. “The death penalty seems to 
have all this baggage, all these problems 
—innocent people, international oppo- 
sition, unfairness, racial problems,” he 
argues. “That’s a lot of baggage, and it 
may not be worth it.” InJanuary, to Die- 
ter’s delight, Illinois’ Republican governor 
shelved the penalty over concerns that 
innocent people might be executed. The 
governor, fittingly, had been a lifelong 
supporter of capital punishment. 
Miguel Angel Martinez is one of 
around 3,600 inmates whose life is at 
stake. In 1992, a Texan court found the 
prospective Air Force cadet guilty of mur- 
dering three men in a gang knife assault— 
an attack in which his new lawyer insists 
he was a “bit player.” He was sentenced 
to death at the age of 17, four years before 
he was legally entitled to drink beer. 
Writing from what he terms the “man- 
made hell”of Terrell Unit in Texas, Mar- 
tinez says he harbours hopes for the new 
abolition campaign. But death row has 
razed all his faiths. Religion he sees as a 
“hollow vessel,” while society is a place of 
"It's about paying for your 
sins and creating 
some sort of equilibrium: 
a life is taken, 
and therefore another 
life should be taken” 
hate: “you know, there is still an actual 
conditioning in people to accept punish- 
ment even when other options exist... We 
are all sadists and masochists to a degree.” 
For many outside the United States, it 
is precisely this unnecessary cruelty that 
taints the death penalty, even though the 
same countries that now scorn the punish- 
ment enjoyed their own illustrious 
moments with the noose, guillotine and 
hatchet man. British law—which heavily 
influenced practice in its colonies—was 
bent on execution. By the 18th century, 
for instance, 222 crimes were punishable by 
death in Britain, including robbing a rabbit 
warren and cutting down a tree. The public, 
in turn, liked nothing better than a picnic at 
the gallows. When one notorious murderer 
was hanged in 1807 in London, 40,000 
people turned up, though an ensuing mass 
frenzy killed a hundred of them. 
Following World War II and the 
spread of codified human rights, many 
nations reconsidered,then scrapped the 
penalty. But the United States proved an 
exception to the rule: even in the ten- 
year hiatus from 1967 to Gilmore's exe- 
cution, courts and states, acting on a tem- 
porary plunge in the penalty’s popularity, 
shunned what one Supreme Court justice 
termed the “machinery of death” instead 
of dismantling it outright. Indeed when 
the Supreme Court issued its Furman vs 
Georgia rulings in 1972, declaring the 
penalty to be “cruel and unusual,” furious 
southern state legislators busied them- 
selves with redrafting their statutes to 
accommodate the Court’s objections. As 
violent crime climbed steeply upwards 
in the recession-hit 1970s, a new-look 
death penalty was ready and waiting in 
several state law books. Some 38 states 
now feature the sentence in their penal 
codes, while around three per cent of the 
nation’s convicted murderers are dispat- 
ched to death row. 
Victims’ rights and the 
draw of opinion polls 
Underlying this penchant for capital 
punishment—particularly marked in 
eight southern states, home to 90 per cent 
of recent executions—appears a deep- 
rooted sense of what justice means. When 
Alan Wolfe, a Boston University politics 
professor, went to Texas to research opi- 
nions towards the 1998 execution of Karla 
Faye Tucker, he was astonished by the 
response: rather than feel pity for the 
cheery 38-year-old inmate who had 
repented and “found God,” most people 
believed death to be perfect retribution 
for her pickaxe slaying of an ex-lover. 
“I think it touched on a very basic, 
fundamental view of society that people 
have, that is pre-political and pre-religious, 
that has to do with an inherent sense of 
what justice means,” says Wolfe. “It’s about 
paying for your sins and creating some 
sort of equilibrium: a life is taken, and the- 
refore another life should be taken.” 
Retribution and scant pity for the 
murderer dominate the thinking of those 
who fervently back the penalty—espe- 
cially the victims’ relatives. The first rela- 
tive allowed under a new Texan law in 
1996 to witness the execution of the mur- 
derer recalled how “I would like to have 
seen him humiliated a bit. I think he 
should have been brought in and strapped 
down in front of us.” In radio talks shows 
across the land, callers demand that killers 
be “fried”so they can “meet Hitler.” 
The irony is that this atavistic sense of 
justice is so out of synch with other trends 
in U.S. culture. Most Christian teachings

But murder and punishment, above all in 
the south, still follow the dictates of an 
“eye for an eye.” And while violent crimes 
soared over the past two decades, clai- 
ming the lives of 500,000 Americans (with 
around 17,000 murders a year at present)

tencing phase of the murder trial, when 
bereaved relatives take the stand, or in 
state politicians’ rhetoric. “If the debate 
is just over the penalty or not the death 
penalty,” sighs Dieter, “it’s like asking 
whether you're for criminals or victims.” 
Public opinion in countries like Bri- 
tain or France, however, was hardly very 
different.In almost all cases, clear majo- 
rities supported the penalty, though poli- 
tical leaders resolved to push through 
with abolition all the same. Politicians in 
the United States, on the other hand, 
have been unwilling or unable to emulate 
these feats. The generation that was so 
closely linked to the civil rights era—the 
Kennedys, Martin Luther King—may 
have been equipped to do so, but its figu- 
rcheads were fated to die early. Mea- 
ningful debate has been further impeded 
by the penalty’s deployment at state level,

perspective, and by the absence of other 
proposals such as gun control or poverty 
programmes, ruled out by costs and lob- 
bies. But more than any other factor, itis 
what observers see as the frenetic nature 
of U.S. democracy, with its comparatively 
weak political parties, incessant elections 
and hyper-sensitivity to opinion polls, 
that has exposed candidates to constant 
courting of voters’ hunches 
The price of opposing the penalty 
became evident in the mishaps of Michael

opposition to the penalty when asked

on crime. All politicians swiftly learnt 
that support for the penalty, though it 
may not have mattered to them much as 
an issue, was a vote-securing synonym 
for “toughness” on crime. For elected dis- 
trict attorneys (local prosecutors), who 
often later become judges, exploitation of 
the issue became rife. “It’s a quick way to 
get on television and get your name in the 
paper,” says Michael Mears, from the 
Georgia Indigent Defense Council. “It’s 
a placebo for the public, like giving the 
patient a sugar-coated tablet.” 
With victims occupying the moral 
high ground and politicians unable to 
draw themselves away from the glitter 
of a poll booster, the practical tack taken 
by the new abolitionists seems sensible. 
Already they appear to have convinced 
the majority of the American public that

innocent lives may have been shed.Die- 
ter’s centre lists 87 people exonerated 
from death row since the penalty’s reins- 
tatement, while several DNA tests are 
currently underway in an effort to dis- 
cover the first scientific confirmation of an 
executed innocent. 
Racial bias in imposition of the death 
penalty has provided yet further ammu- 
nition for the punishment’s opponents. 
Although black murderers are propor- 
tionately under-represented on death 
row, there is undeniable statistical evi- 
dence showing that death penalties are 
imposed almost entirely (over 80 per- 
cent) when victims are white. In Georgia, 
meanwhile, Mears reports that only one 
out of 159 district attorneys is black. For 
many campaigners, says criminology pro- 
fessor Robert Bohm, the penalty is simply 
“a new form of social control that 
replaced slavery.” 
Calls for a moratorium 
In the case of Martinez, prejudice (he 
is Mexican-American),poverty, and the 
fact that an accomplice’s father was a 
local judge appeared to have vitiated all 
chance of leniency. Indeed his legal saga 
reads like a litany of the death penalty’s 
iniquities: his trial lasted five days, the 
alleged accomplices are free, and a large 
part of the local district attorney’s office 
has since been sacked for taking bribes. 
“It is like two people playing chess, one 
who is very good at it and another who is 
just learning how the pieces move,” he 
recalls of his trial. 
His case and others have led campai- 
gners to hope a moratorium may be 
called as the “silver bullet” is sullied by 
procedural failure, and maybe buried by 
a richer variety of crime policies. Sceptics 
for their part warn that the machinery of 
death could just be reinvented in a 
sleeker, “fairer” guise. But one thing 
seems clear: if the penalty goes, it will not 
go at the behest of an ethical revolution. 
As Wolfe argues, “if you leave out the 
morality entirely, I think Americans 
would be very sympathetic to halting or 
at least slowing capital punishment.” =

INTERVIEW BY JASMINA SOPOVA   
Hig 
a ountry’s economic and social 
de¥eipment does not depend only on 
no al and labour, as economists and 
the free-market tradition suggest. Cul- 
ture is just as important.In La société de 
confiance (“The Society of Trust”),publi- 
shed in 1995 the French academic Alain 
Peyrefitte correctly explained that the 
main theories placing economic resources 
such as raw materials, capital labour, pro- 
duction,investment,and growth rates at 
the heart of development were out of 
date. He said that cultural factors, which 
have been relegated to the rank of “by- 
standers,” should be regarded as a basic 
driving force of progress. In truth, the 
intangible, immaterial aspects of culture 
help to shape people’s mentalities. That’s 
why they are the real locomotive of any 
society. If they are neglected, if they are 
not put at the core of thinking about 
development, there is a chance they may 
turn into insurmountable obstacles. 
What cultural factors impede development 
in Africa? 
Taboos, superstition, polygamy and 
tribalism are some of them. How can a 
woman lead a fulfilling life when she is 
constantly struggling against her rivals 
to keep her husband’s affection? How 
can you bring up your children the way 
you want to when you must submit to 
your elders’ authority? How can you 
think and reflect with a calm,level head 
when 10 or 20 of you are living under the 
same roof? In my opinion,this custom is 
an abuse of the traditional values of bro- 
therhood and generosity because it stands 
in the way of personal self-fulfillment. 
You can’t save money or achieve per- 
sonal goals because you must obey the 
group’s demands. In this “gregarious” 
society, whose roots lie in traditional cul- 
ture, it 1s inconceivable for the individual 
to have an existence outside his or her 
community. But individuality is precisely 
where the source of progress lies. 
Of all these problems, the most 
serious is probably an inferiority com- 
plex, which has a tremendous hold in 
Africa. It generates a culture of depen- 
dence to the detriment of a culture of 
responsibility, paralyzes and suffocates 
the whole continent, destroys the basis of 
social cohesiveness. I'm convinced that

from Cote d'Ivoire, fashions his faith in dance’s power to push society onwards 
the main cause of under-development in 
Africa is a lack of self-confidence. 
What do you mean by that? 
Africans do not trust Africans. Whites 
enjoy more consideration and are given 
more resources than blacks. Take a per- 
sonal example. In 1987,during a lecture

my behalf. The minister immediately 
changed his tone. After a few phone calls, 
he opened doors for me to all the media 
while the most beautiful conference hall 
in the city, the place used by the country’s 
sole political party, was placed at my dis- 
posal. Similar things happen every day 
in our countries. 
This inferiority complex can also be 
seen in the relationship with traditional 
dance. Sometimes, African artists who 
have acquired a veneer of training in 
Western dance hurriedly denigrate their 
roots. Likewise, instead of developing 
their own analyses, African intellectuals 
just repeat everything that some foreign 
pseudo-specialists say and write about 
their culture. The problem is that the dis- 
course of these specialists often locks 
African dance in a ghetto and denies the 
continent the right to evolve and moder- 
nize. They see Africa as a living museum 
of past traditions. 
Can dance change that mentality? 
I’m convinced it can. The creative act 
is fundamental to the emancipation of 
the individual. Everyone knows that. But 
it 1s even more fundamental in the 
African context, where individuality, the 
source of progress, is often stifled by 
group pressure and conformity. 
That is where dance can be a factor of 
development. It can tear up the old 
stumps, destroy the causes of evil that are 
deeply rooted in the human sub-conscious,

give individuals the possibility of belon- 
ging, of finding and fulfilling themselves. 
That is how it can make society move. 
Because only a society made up of free 
and self-confident individuals can find the 
right solutions to its problems. 
Dance, a major component of African 
culture, mobilizes a vast amount of energy 
that should be more effectively channelled.

take more account of the emancipatory 
qualities of dance, and also give artists and 
researchers the means to pursue their 
work more effectively. They mustn’t forget 
that the very fact of researching our 
dances, which condition our entire lives, 
means agreeing to accepting ourselves as

we are, freeing us from our complexes, 
making us feel good about who we are 
and what we think, proving that we have 
confidence in ourselves, in all Africans and 
in the rest of the world. 
How can African dance help to establish a 
relationship with the rest of the world? 
Choreography is an “exportable” cul- 
tural product. On a large scale, it could 
become an asset for modern Africa.Since 
African dance has spread worldwide, it 
has done more to bring young people from 
the North and South closer together than 
any other policy, no matter how good and 
well-intentioned. Dance is still the shortest 
route linking one individual to another. It 
is about passion and seduction. During 
the period of colonization, Westerners 
understood this perfectly well and made it 
illegal to dance with Africans. 
In the past few decades, thanks to the 
African diaspora and to the many dance 
courses held in the North as well as the 
South, the trend has started moving in 
the opposite direction. Real exchanges 
have taken place, sincere and deep friend- 
ships have been woven in a spirit of 
mutual trust, dignity and respect. The 
rising interest in African dance calls for an 
adequate response on the part of Africans 
themselves, so that supply grows at the 
same pace as demand.Because, to para- 
phrase the French philosopher Albert 
Jacquard, on the dance floor “the only 
worthy goal is not to be better than others, 
but to be better because of others.” m

ALPHONSE TIEROU 
DIRECTOR OFTHE DOOPLERESOURCE, 
TEACHINGAND RESEARCH CENTRE FOR AFRICAN CREATION IN 
Paris 
In Africa, dance and the 
economy are intrinsically 
connected: the origins of the 
dooplé, the first of ten basic 
movements in African dance, lie 
in the motion of using 
the pestle 
he great poet and president of Senegal, 
Léopold Sédar Senghor, said that by 
using the word “step,” the Europeans had 
turned dance into an abstract game “to 
take man off the earth and project him 
into the sky.” Africans prefer the expres- 
sion “basic movement,” because it implies 
a connection between the dancer and the 
earth.A famous verse by the same poet 
perfectly expresses this symbiotic rela- 
tionship between human beings and the 
earth beneath them: “We are dancing 
people whose feet are revitalized by 
stamping them on the hard ground.” 
The first of the ten basic movements, 
which I have observed in all the regions 
and among all the peoples of Africa, is the 
dooplé. This is a composite term bor- 
rowed from Oueoulou, the secret lan- 
guage of the glaé, a community of mask 
bearers belonging to the Wéon people, 
who live in western Cote dIvoire. Gla 
(the singular of glaé¢) means mask in the 
African sense of the term, in other words 
the costume, the accessories and those 
who wear them. I have chosen the lan- 
guage of this community of wisdom 
masks (in Africa,the mask is considered 
a living entity) because it is sacred, spiri- 
tual, divine and, as a result, belongs to 
no single group of people. Furthermore, 
the Wéon (also known as the Guéré) are 
the guardians of the only glaé prayer, 
whose content clearly expresses the com- 
bined spiritual, technical and structural 
aspects of dance. 
In Oueoulou, doo means mortar and plé, 
pestle. These are cooking utensils 
common to every part of Africa and 
occupy a central place in everyday life. 
The movement of a person using a pestle 
is the basis of African dance. On the one 
hand, the pestle pounding the mortar 
produces sounds, percussion, a beat—in 
short,music. On the other hand,the up- 
and-down movement of the plé beating 
against the doo makes it shake, tremble, 
move—in other words, dance. So the doo 
becomes a musical instrument, the plé a 
dancing object and the person doing the 
pounding, a composer. 
Dance conveys our vision of the world 
and conditions our entire existence. Its 
basic movements are all symbolically 
charged. They express a person’s rela- 
tionship to the Earth, to God, to the com- 
munity of the living and that of the dead. 
Each movement also has a specific mea- 
Dance is a coded 
language that creates 
a dialogue between 
dancers and spectators 
familiar with its 
underlying symbolism 
ning: dancing in a bent-over position with 
arms folded over the chest is a symbol of 
initiation; stamping feet on the ground 
is a show of extreme joy; tapping fore- 
heads against each other is an act of com- 
munion.Dance is thus a coded language 
that creates a dialogue between dancers 
and spectators familiar with its under- 
lying symbolism, signifying that it cannot 
be measured against Western standards 
despite frequent attempts to do exactly 
that.In African dance, for example, sho- 
wing two open hands is a sign of honesty, 
clear conscience and hospitality. In 
contemporary dance, the same gesture 
symbolizes the density of the air that the 
artist embraces or pushes away. Joining 
the palms of two hands together is a gesture 
of prayer in the Christian world. For Afri- 
cans, however, it is a way of concentrating 
all the body’s energy, the right hand having 
a negative polarity and the left, a posi- 
tive polarity. The symbolism of these 
movements is rooted in an ethical, acs- 
thetic and social context that cannot be 
ignored if one wants to grasp the full 
meaning of African dance. And even less 
so if one wants to judge it. [|

digital heritage. 
Just a few years ago, digital technolo- 
gies emerged as a godsend for archivists. 
As e-mail and the Internet spread, pundits 
began taking bets on how long it would 
take for paper to disappear. Libraries

their collections. Instead of submitting

### 120775: Digital disappearances

Digital 
disappearances 
Obsolete machines and the ephemeral nature of web-based materials are just some of the hurdles 
confronting archivists as they struggle to preserve the world’s digital heritage 
new technologies, others have been a bit 
too zealous in cleaning up—throwing 
out—their ageing documents like old 
newspapers. And finally, some of the more 
prestigious institutions have fallen upon 
a double-edged sword after proudly dis- 
playing the gems of their collections on 
the Internet. The digital versions whetted 
the general public’s appetite to see the 
“real thing”which means that crowning 
documents like the Magna Carta risk 
becoming veritable attractions. 
Ironically, the supposed saviour, digi- 
tization, may be an enemy in the battle to 
build and preserve perpetual archives. 
To begin with, the 
technology is so new In the near future, those 
  
digital holdings because of obsolescence. 
Awaiting a long-term solution, archi- 
vists continue to rely on a veritable relic: 
microfilm for crumbling paper collec- 
tions. But the old stand-by does little to 
resolve the latest thorn in their side:the 
new wave of “born-digitals,” works 
created on computer-like websites and 
electronic journals. 
Consider the case of continually up- 
dated documents on the Web. Should we 
preserve all the various drafts of the docu- 
ment or only the final version? The drafts 
of great works of literature are treasure 
troves for scholars. For instance, Victor 
Hugo’s splendid 
handwriting and the

creator becomes the 
great eraser,” warns an American futurist, 
Stewart Brand. We can read a thousand- 
year-old manuscript, yet archivists cannot 
decipher some materials that are less than 
20 years old. 
Remember the old floppy discs of the 
not-so-distant past? If by some miracle a 
library finds some of those clunky 
machines, the chances of acquiring spare 
parts, the right software required and a 
trained technician are just about nil. 
Today, “backward compatible” soft- 
ware—that designed to read old ver- 
sions—generally only covers one or two 
generations of changes, which offers little 
relief when the average life cycle of hard- 
ware and software is a mere 18 months. 
Indeed, the U.S. based Research Libraries 
Group found in a 1998 survey that nearly 
half (15 of 36) of its member institutions 
reported losing access to part of their 
study literary history 
will be at a loss if all 
they have is a diskette containing the 
final “clean” version with no draft, no 
hesitation, no notes, no drawings nor 
doodles. 
The same is true of e-mail. A century 
ago, famous writers may have recorded 
their movements, discoveries and emo- 
tions to friends or family in letters which 
have often been preserved as part of our 
cultural heritage, helping to set literary 
works in the context of the writer’s life and 
thought. E-mail storage is increasingly 
seen as a burden on a computer system. 
Will the memory of today’s literary giants 
lose out to that of the computer? 
And what about all the links an elec- 
tronic publication might have to other 
websites? The exhilaration that grips us 
when we surf the Net quickly turns to 
vertigo with the thought of preserving 
that sea of information.

National libraries with the financial means have been steadily digitizing their collections. 
National libraries are testing two dif- 
ferent approaches. Given the extraordi- 
nary volume of web-based materials, 
Australian archivists are becoming “gate- 
keepers,” sifting through and selecting 
the most important materials for a 
national electronic repository. To be part 
of the depot, an item must either be 
about the country or particularly rele- 
vant to its interests. Alternatively, it can 
be the work of an Australian, recognized 
as an authority on an issue of interna- 
tional significance. While this approach 
appears to be the most practical, there is 
a danger in becoming overly selective. 
After Napoleon ransacked the Vatican 
archives and sent them back to Paris in 
1810, the French only saved the docu- 
ments of immediate and apparent 
interest. 
Alternatively, archivists might try to 
save the entire electronic domain of a 
country. Sweden has embarked on such 
an ambitious project, in collaboration 
with other Nordic states. Thanks in large 
part to a robot that takes regular “snap- 
shots” of the Internet, the Swedes have 
already amassed more than 58,000 
items—from online publications to confe- 
rence proceedings—in building a central 
electronic repository. 
Both of these routes lead to two major 
obstacles: copyright conflicts and costs. 
In some countries, publishers must 
deposit copies of every new publication in 
national libraries. These laws, however, do 
not always apply in the electronic domain. 
While some publishers voluntarily deposit 
copies of “handheld”works, like CD-ROMs, 
ephemeral works like electronic journals 
are practically untouchable for legal rea- 
sons. By subscribing to those journals, 
libraries or individuals aren’t actually 
buying a “copy,” just a license to access the 
material. 


### 120775: Digital disappearances

Taking a digital 
refresher 
Do they have the right to offer that 
access to the public? And what if a library 
stops a subscription? Then they don’t 
necessarily have the right to display or 
offer public access to back issues for 
which they paid. 
Enormous financial pressure is buil- 
ding on national libraries and publishers 
alike to iron out new business arrange- 
ments and partnerships. Publishers are 
leery of the responsibility for preserva- 
tion, yet at the same time cannot afford to 
see their collections become obsolete. 
Meanwhile, the archivists are finding it far 
more expensive to acquire an electronic 
publication than a traditional one. The 
National Library of Australia, for example, 
estimates that it takes one person a full 
working day to acquire the first version of 
an online publication—a task five times 
more labour intensive than adding a print 
item. A study by the British Library sug- 
gested that the cost of managing and pre- 
serving a digital publication over a 25-year- 
period is about 20 times greater than it is for 
print. 
A hefty chunk of the costs go to “refre- 
shing” digital documents. Every five or 
ten years, electronic collections are sup- 
posed to embark on a “migration,” in 
archival lingo, to an updated computer 
configuration.Unfortunately, the journey 
is not without its casualties. Formats and 
presentations may change and some sec- 
tions risk disappearing altogether. Does it 
matter if the look and “feel” of a website 
changes, so long as the contents remain? 
For some archivists, migration is just a 
standby for “emulation,” which would 
involve a combination of software and 
hardware capable of mimicking the beha- 
viour of obsolete platforms and operating 
systems. In short, the aim is to develop a 
kind of mini-archive to “remind” compu- 
ters of their past. But the technological 
wizards can only forge part of the key to 
preserving our digital documents. Ulti- 
mately, we must reconfigure relations bet- 
ween libraries and publishers. [|

t a time when many Thai 
people viewed the hill 
tribes’ in the north of the 
country as a security risk, 
you started working with 
them. Why? 
In the early 70s, I was a 
university student in 
Bangkok where I heard 
all kinds of stories about 
the hill tribes, many of whom had fled from 
ethnic conflicts and hardships in neigh- 
bouring Burma, Laos, China and Cam- 
bodia. The hill tribes were accused 
of drug trafficking, prostitution and de- 
stroying forests with their slash and burn 
cultivation methods. I decided to see for 
myself through a student volunteer pro- 
gramme to teach the Thai language in the 
hills. It didn’t take long to see that there was 
very little truth in those allegations. 
I first went to stay with the Lizu 
people in Chiang Rai province. Here was 
this city-girl, born in Bangkok, who had 
never before climbed mountains, stum- 
bling along trails for four hours. I'll never 
forget how refreshing it was to find the 
village and its tidy winding paths shel- 
tered by an enormous forest. Despite all 
of the negative things that I heard, to my 
great surprise, I found the hill tribes living 
in a pure environment leading a simple 
traditional life. I couldn’t understand 
their language yet I could feel the

people—they were so pure in heart. Their 
spirit inspired me.I wanted to understand 
their philosophy, their way of life in har- 
mony with nature. I was enchanted by 
the songs and folklore through which the 
elders passed on their knowledge and 
wisdom to the young. 
The headman of the first village I 
visited was like a father to me. He invited 
me to stay, and even offered to build me 
a hut, in exchange for teaching the chil- 
dren and adults the Thai language. Even 
though the Lizu and many other groups 
have lived in Thai territory for genera- 
tions, very few spoke the language. They 
were so far removed, geographically and 
culturally, from the mainstream. We made 
an agreement. Until they could speak for 
themselves, I would serve as an interme- 
diary, a bridge between the hill tribes, 
the Thai government and wider society. 
What kind of problems were the hill tribes 
facing? 
At that time, nearly half of the hill 
tribes didn’t even have Thai citizenship. 
As a result, they didn’t have any legal 
rights to the land they had been cultiva- 
ting for years. The increasing demand 
for forestland was pitting them against 
Thai authorities who were declaring a 
growing number of forest regions as 
nature reserves in order to protect the 
environment. 
There were no roads, schools, hos- 
pitals or public services in the hill regions. 
The illiteracy rate was about 90 per cent 
and the birth rate in the highlands was 
almost three times higher than that of 
the lowlands. Infant mortality was almost 
double. In short, they were the most 
disadvantaged among the disadvantaged 
in the country. And yet, even though they 
were deprived of basic amenities, the hill 
tribes never thought that they were under- 
privileged because nature provided for 
all their needs, including medicine. 
Weren't there accusations that the hill 
tribes were involved in opium cultivation? 
For generations, tribes like the Lizu, 
the Hmong and others grew opium as 
part of their cultural tradition. Elders 
would sometimes smoke during family or 
community gatherings. It was also used 
for a variety of traditional medicines. 
These people rely on their own resources. 
But I can assure you that a hill tribe never 
got rich by growing opium for outsiders. 
However, the situation changed 
when increasing Western demand for 
opium (to produce heroin) triggered 
illegal trafficking of the drug from the 
so-called Golden Triangle, the area bor- 
dering Thailand, Burma and Laos.

Individuals and groups with vested 
interests exploited the geographic advan- 
tage of the region for opium production. 
But the blame fell on the hill tribes, lca- 
ding the United Nations and the Thai 
government to massively introduce the 
cultivation of cash crops like fruits and 
vegetables. These projects have had little 
success in improving the life and dignity 
of the hill tribes and have taken a heavy 
toll on the environment. 
The Hmong tribe, for example, 
have been among the worst affected. To 
grow vegetables, they diverted more and 
more water from the rivers and began 
using fertilizers to increase their yields. 
By reducing and polluting rivers, they 
came into conflict with the Thai farmers 
living in the lowlands 
Wasn't this also linked to the problem of 
deforestation? Weren't the hill tribes 
accused of causing great damage by clea- 
ring forest for farming and then burning 
the fields after a harvest to rejuvenate 
the soil? 
Traditionally, the hill tribes used 
slash and burn tactics in a limited way— 
just to produce food for their families. 
But in trying to produce cash crops and 
satisfy the demands of the market, the 
tribes surpassed the natural capacities of 
the land, degraded by deforestation and 
erosion. The Akha tribes, for example, 
began cultivating rice in steep areas, 
which caused soil erosion. They are now 
trying alternative methods. 
However, I do not think that slash 
and burn cultivation alone caused the 
deforestation in the northern region. 
Timber companies and other commercial 
groups from the south should be held

responsible for the large-scale problem. 
I do not deny that a country like Thailand 
needs more timber and other natural 
resources for its economic development. 
But at what cost? Today, no one appears 
willing to publicly discuss this problem. 
You started out as a ‘spokesperson’ for the 
hill tribes. How has your role changed? 
By studying their language, history 
and kinship system, I gained their confi- 
dence. This enabled me to introduce some 
basic education projects which later led to 
the creation of the Hill Area Development 
Foundation (HA DF, see box). Since then, 
with the help of donor agencies, and the 
Thai government we were able to esta- 
blish schools for children as well adults in 
the hill regions. 
The general aim is to offer access to 
the formal education system. However, 
we also try to instil the children with a 
deep sense of pride in their history and cul- 
ture, so that they won’t blindly assimilate 
the ways of mainstream society but change 
in a positive way, based on their culture. 
For example, we very carefully developed 
anew syllabus integrating the knowledge 
of the ethnic tribes with that of the Thai 
curriculum for the HADF-run schools. 
We also concentrate on offering 
training in sustainable agricultural 
methods so that hill tribe farmers can 
1. According to the Hill Area Development Foun- 
dation,approximately one million hill tribe people 
live in Thailand's mountainous northern and wes- 
tern border regions. About 65 per cent of the hill 
population belong to two major ethnic groups—the 
Karen and Hmong tribes. Other tribes like the 
Lahu,Akha,Mien,H’tin, Lizu, Lawa and Khamu 
make up the rest of the population.

abandon slash and burn tactics. The new 
techniques, apart from preventing soil 
erosion, revitalizes the land. 
The environmental groups were 
right to highlight the problem of defo- 
restation. However, instead of offering 
alternatives, the government just began 
evicting the tribes from forest areas. 
Our aim isn’t simply to introduce new or 
foreign techniques but to adapt and 
revitalize traditional agricultural prac- 
tices. For example, the Karen tribes 
continue to follow an age-old rotation 
system. Instead of clearing land entirely, 
they simply cut the branches from the 
bottom of trees. They then rotate bet- 
ween swathes of land to grow a single 
crop, which gives the soil a chance to reju- 
venate. 
This kind of training project seems to be 
part of a larger struggle to strike a balance 
between various groups depending on the 
same limited resources. Can you describe 
the ongoing conflict between the hill tribes 
living in the region's watershed area and 
those in the lowlands? 
In tropical countries like Thailand, 
we depend on a delicate natural process 
whereby forests absorb rainwater and 
release it into the rivers. If you reduce the 
forest, the rain just runs off the land and is 
wasted instead of flowing into the rivers. So 
we must take immediate steps to preserve 
the remaining forestland in the watershed 
area. Apart from being the main sources 
of water, the watershed area is also very 
supportive of many ecosystems. 
Unfortunately, only the hill tribes   
living in the watershed region are 
expected to preserve the forest while 
those living downstream in the lowlands 
and cities are not showing any signs of 
changing their ways. In fact, they use 
more water than people living in the ups- 
tream areas. It is totally unfair on the part 
of the authorities to impose restrictions 
on the hill tribes and force them to relo- 
cate far away from their region in an 
effort to save forests. 
How can we expect the hill tribes 
alone to make all the sacrifices? Preser- 
ving the environment is the duty of eve- 
ryone and if we do not want the hill tribes 
to use the forest, we have to provide them 
with alternatives. That’s why I insist on a 
harmonious relationship between the 
two sides. 
In recent years, the Thai government has 
been investing in development projects 
for the northern region. What are the 
results so far? 
There are more roads, electricity 
and other basic infrastructure in the hills 
now. But far less has been invested in 
education or environmental projects 
because politicians derive few benefits 
from them. When companies bid for a 
contract to build a new road, for example, 
a commission is usually given to the poli- 
tician involved. 
As a result of the construction pro- 
jects, there is increasing contact between 
the hill tribes and lowland Thais which 
has led to a new set of problems. The 
insular life of the hills made it easier to 
create a shared vision of life in harmony 
with nature. Now the hill tribes must 
deal with the symbols of materialism. In 
a way, they face the same problems as 
many developing countries. 
Greater exposure to advertising 
creates more greed. Young people in par- 
ticular want to wear blue jeans, drive a 
motorcycle or a car, just like city people. 
They no longer want to work the land but 
simply make money. So many are migra- 
ting to big cities, which creates a lot of 
social tension. In the cities, they often 
get involved in prostitution, for example, 
and then return to the hills carrying 
diseases like AIDS. 
Little by little, cultural identity is 
eroded by materialism. If this continues, 
I am afraid that the culture of the hill 
tribes could be lost forever. So we—the 
hill tribes, NGOs and government—must 
find ways of improving living conditions 
and assuring the people similar rights to 
lowlanders while retaining their specific 
" a life in the hills ” 
cultural identity. 
You mention the need for land rights, yet 
many of these people don't even have a 
Thai passport. Why is citizenship such a 
problem? 
Due to political and economic rea- 
sons many hill tribes from neighbouring 
countries have been migrating to Thai- 
land for centuries. You must understand 
that indigenous people in general don’t 
feel bound by national borders. To begin 
with, they are often forced to move 
because of political conflicts and envi- 
ronmental needs. 
Up until 1992, it was relatively easy 
to obtain some kind of identity papers 
if you were born in Thailand. But the 
government changed the laws, after 
large-scale migration into the area for 
both political and economic reasons. 
According to new rules, applicants should 
prove that they and their parents were 
born in Thailand. But few of these people 
possess birth certificates. We must also 
consider the plight of those not born in 
the country. How can we send people 
back to Burma where there is no justice? 
It is very complicated. The Thai 
government cannot grant citizenship to 
everyone and is doing its best under the 
present circumstances. The cross-border 
migration also brings friction within the 
tribal communities. For example, Hmong 
ethnic tribes in Thailand are finding it dif- 
ficult to secure enough forest for their 
own families. So when ethnic conflict 
began driving Hmong tribes from Laos 
across the border, the Thai Hmong asso- 
ciation told them that they should go back 
to their country once the situation stabilizes. 
The hill tribes of Thailand are a major tourist 
attraction. Have they profited from this? 
Eco-tourism and cultural tourism 
should improve understanding between 
people from different parts of the world. On 
the contrary, the travel industry is exploiting 
the hill tribes in Thailand without even rea- 
lizing it. While the government earns 
revenue by promoting tourism in the north, 
hardly any of the money is invested back in 
the region. Only the tour operators and a 
few middlemen profit. 
The tourists tend to treat the 
indigenous people as some kind of exotic 
specimen. Instead of coming to the hills to 
take photos, they should learn to respect 
the local people and their culture. In nor- 
thern Thailand, boats carrying foreign 
tourists often stop at Lahu and Karen vil- 
lages along the Mekong River. Whenever 
a boat arrives, children start running in

main role of the NGO should be to offer 
a voice to the disadvantaged. By offering 
a different viewpoint, we can offer alter-

A LIFE IN THE HILLS 
  
n 1973, university students in Thailand sta- 
|e mass demonstrations calling for demo- 
cracy and an end to the country’s military dic- 
tatorship. In response, authorities closely 
monitored all student activities inside the 
country. Tuenjai Deetes’ work as a student 
volunteer teacher in the hill village of Baan 
Pangsa in northern Thailand was no excep- 
tion. Undeterred by intimidation and sur- 
veillance, Deetes pursued her mission with 
determination. 
In 1976 Deetes found herself in a similar 
situation following a left-wing inspired stu- 
dent revolt in the country, which was brutally 
repressed after the military staged a coup in 
October of that year. When authorities came 
knocking on her door, she recalls telling them: 
“| believe in peace and non-violence and wish 
to continue with my work for the hill tribes.” 
Though initially dubious, officials allowed her 
to pursue her work and Deetes went on to 
win government support for her projects 
soon after. On the other hand, she was always 
cautious not to take sides in ethnic conflicts 
or to confront directly the drug lords in the 
sensitive border region. “We had to operate 
with extreme care and tact without offen- 
ding anyone.” 
Deetes founded the Hill Area Development 
Foundation (HADF) in 1986 to assist hill tribes 
in dealing with problems ranging from envi- 
ronmental management to social develop- 
ment. Today, the HADF works in 27 hill villages 
in the watershed area of the Mae Chan and 
Mae Salong rivers on the Thai-Burmese border. 
Slightly built,the 48-year-old Deetes travels 
indefatigably from one hill village to another. 
It requires extraordinary courage and convic- 
tion for a Bangkok-born-and-raised girl to 
give up the comforts of the big city for the 
remote hill regions. Over the years, Deetes 
has won enormous respect and admiration 
from her peers, who recently elected her as a 
senator after she stood as an independent 
candidate in Chiang Rai, the capital of the 
mountainous province in northern Thailand 
where she works. 
Deetes’ dedicated and selfless service has won 
her many laurels, including the 1994 Goldman 
Environmental Prize, given annually to grass- 
roots environmental activists. During the 25th 
anniversary of the United Nations Environ- 
ment Programme in 1997, she was named as 
one of “25 Women Leaders in Action” for her 
role in protecting the planet. 
Despite her achievements, Deetes remains 
modest and down to earth. In the coming 
years she wants to train more volunteers to 
work with the hill tribes and create a network 
of organizations in the region. “I cannot 
change the governments of the world on my 
own. With small groups, we can change the 
world and steer itin a positive direction,” says 
the soft-spoken Deetes. Married with two chil- 
dren, she now lives in Chiang Rai. [| 
Action Network. From Malaysia to the 
Philippines and even Nigeria, the 
struggle is in many ways the same. People 
need the rights to their lands and 
resources—the right to earn a living with 
nature. They need protection from the 
multinationals, which plunder areas for 
resources like timber, oil and minerals. 
In the name of research, companies 
make millions by patenting the traditional 
knowledge and medicines of indigenous 
peoples. Now the tribes themselves are 
being used for genetic research. In return, 
the tribes get nothing. In Thailand, we 
have had some well-known cases of 
exploitation of tribal medicines by Western 
companies. But due to legal complications 
we could not do anything about the abuse. 
We must also question government 
policies for managing resources. For 
example, countries often declare forest 
regions as protected areas, ignoring the 
rights of indigenous peoples who have 
been living there for hundreds of years. Up 
until recently, the major environmental 
campaigns and treaties did not look into 
the problems of the indigenous people. 
In the early 1990s, the United Nations 
declared the International Decade for the 
World's Indigenous Peoples (1995-2004), 
yet so far,it has not been successful. Only 
a few countries have taken concrete steps 
to recognize their rights. 
The positive side, however, is that 
groups internationally are co-ordinating 
their efforts and learning from others’ 
experience. But the time has come to sit 
down with bodies like the World Trade 
Organization and the World Bank to 
frankly discuss the world’s future. =m
