Under the big top of Italy’s Embell Riva Circus, an equestrian act prepares to go through i its paces. The circus, owned by the Bellucci family, 
tours mainly in southern Italy. 
from the chestnut trees covered the 
road between the station and the 
square, a moment would come when I 
would open the window overlooking our 
vegetable garden and see with delight the 
tent of the little circus which had been 
pitched on the village green overnight. 
When I opened the same window in 
springtime, my surprise came from the 
cherry tree, bursting with white blossoms. 
I was a small boy then, full of excitement 
at discovering the big top which had gone 
up in front of our house. The evening air 
N- autumn began and leaves was filled with the sounds of trumpets 
and the rumble of drums. 
It was usually the same circus that 
Federico Fellini had applauded before me 
in Rimini, the chief town of the Adriatic 
Riviera, near the village where 1 was 
born—Santarcangelo di Romagna. I 
remember how Fellini and I often talked 
about it during the shooting of Amarcord, 
the film in which he remembered his 
youth in Rimini. 
By then, both of us had been living in 
Rome for many years. On Sunday mor- 
nings, Fellini would often drive me to 
Cinecittal. He just loved to be there when 
it was deserted and quiet. He would ask 
for the keys to Set no. 5 and we would 
make our way to that dank, empty place. 
Let the show begin! 
As soon as we arrived, he would say in 
a voice charged with emotion: “Let the 
show begin!” and would start to switch on 
the lights one by one. We watched the

» fuzzy glow from the dusty bulbs dotted all 
around the huge drab area, and the 
sounds and images of shows we had seen 
as children came flooding back. 
On days when the circus was in town, 
even my mother Penelope joined in the 
fun. Every morning, she would ask the 
keeper of the African animals for the 
droppings of the giraffes and the old lion, 
and would use them to work wonders on 
the flowers she grew in old saucepans. 
The beautiful photos by Massimo 
Siragusa which illustrate this scrapbook of 
golden memories take me back to those 
childhood days as well as my long visits 
with the prodigious Fellini to Set no. 5 
(one of 16) at Cinecitta. For him this set 
was the real Via Veneto, the Via Veneto of 
La Dolce Vita. Set no. 5 served as the back- 
drop when the coffin with the great direc- 
tor’s body was displayed to the public for 
the last time on November 1, 1993. 
These memories also take me back to 
Russia, one of the countries I've loved 
most, and bring to mind the time when [ 
worked for the director Andrei 
Khryanovsky. A few years ago, [ gave him 
the script of a cartoon story called The 
Grey-Bearded Lion. A film was recently 
made of it which tells the story of a little 
circus whose main attraction is an unu- 
sual lion called Amedeo, or Teo to his 
friends. As the years go by and he gets 
older, divisions grow among the small 
family of circus folk. 
The great Popov 
I also remember, like so many colou- 
red bubbles, the times when I met the 
great Russian clowns, especially 
Karandash, who was so short that when 
he stood behind a table, he seemed to be 
sitting at it. 
And Popov, the great Popov who per- 
formed his finest routine one day when he 
was in Amsterdam. He entered the ring 
and prepared to eat a meal in a small 
spotlight which lit up part of the ground. 
When he finished, he gathered up the 
light with his hands, as if it were bread- 
crumbs, a trick he’d worked out with the 
lighting technician. Just as he was leaving 
the ring, he put the light in a shopping 
bag. He received so much applause that 
he stopped and threw the bag towards the 
audience, which was then flooded with 
light. 
I can’t forget either the statues that 
[lario Fioravanti, an old sculptor from 
Cesena, shaped with hesitant child-like 
hands. In Pennabilli (the village in the 
Marches region of Italy between Pesaro 
and Urbina where I've lived for the past

POET,

AND 
SCRIPTWRITER 
Tr Rtatian poet Tonino Guerra, who was born 
in Santarcangelo di Romagna in 1928, gra- 
duated in education studies from the University 
of Urbina and is a world-famous scriptwriter. He 
has written over 100 screenplays, which have 
been made into films by directors including 
Michelangelo Antonioni (with whom he has just 
written LUAquifons, an illustrated story for the 
third millennium, published by Editoriale Delfi, 
Cassina, Milan), Andrei Tarkovsky, the Taviani 
brothers, Federico Fellini, Francesco Rosi and 
Vittorio de Sica. 
Some of his poems and short stories have 
been translated into English, French, German, 
Dutch and Spanish. Of one poem, Honey, the 
great tatian writer talo Calvino has said: “Tonino 
Guerra turns everything inte fiction and poetry— 
via the spoken word, writing er film, in italian or 
in the Emilio-RBomagna dialect. We should all 
learn his dialect so we can read these wonderful 
stories in their original language.” [|

decade), he assembled all the statues 
which reminded him of the circus and cir- 
cus life. They are still in the rooms of an 
old palazzo in the heart of the ancient vil- 
lage, the Bargello. In cells which once 
held prisoners, Fioravanti’s statues now 
stand as if waiting for a round of applau- 
se that might break out at any moment, 
applause suspended in mid-air. 
There’s something irresistible about 
this world that floods my memory with 
joy but also fills me with melancholy—the 
last notes of the music we heard in the vil- 
lage as the circus caravans prepared to 
leave and then went on their way. The 
sounds trailed away in the fog and beca- 
me a kind of poignant lament that, stan- 
ding on the tips of our toes, we strained to 
hear until the very last note. 
Afterwards, we would gather on the 
patch of ground where the circus ring had 
been. Sometimes we’d plant candles and 
create a ring of light around us. |

### 118281: Into action

INTO ACTION 
Koichiro Matsuura 
Koichiro Matsuura, who was 
born in Tokyo in 1937, 
studied law at the University 
of Tokyo and economics at 
Haverford College 
(Pennsylvania, USA). In 
1959, he began his career at 
the Japanese Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, where he has 
served as Director-General of 
the Economic Co-operation 
Bureau (1988-1990); 
Director-General of the 
North American Affairs 
Bureau (1990-1992); Deputy 
Minister for Foreign Affairs 
(1992-1994), in which post he 
oversaw Japan’s hosting of 
the First Tokyo International 
Conference on African 
Development; and since 1994 
as Ambassador to France, 
Andorra and Djibouti. He 
also served for one year, 
until November 1999, as 
chairperson of UNESCO's 
World Heritage Committee. 
On November 12, UNESCO'S 
supreme ruling body, the 
General Conference grouping 
188 Member Sates, 
confirmed the choice made 
by the Executive Board on 12 
November and appointed Mr 
Matsuura to the post of 
Director-General of UNESCO. 
UNESco is a factor of hope,because it is the one international organization which, 
through all its programmes, respects and defends what is of universal worth and dignity 
in the material and spiritual heritage of all cultures, and thereby, the absolute 
dignity of all human beings. . .. 
Globalization is accelerating with dramatic speed, presenting a global challenge which 
demands a global answer. Yet the response must be made with all due respect for cultural 
diversity and identity, for that priceless individual component that makes up the true dignity 
of our many peoples. 
But UNESCO can only go on providing the world with such hope, and such defence, 
if it proves itself to be an adequate world instrument. UNESCO is not an end in itself. UNESCO 
is a world service,a tool which is at once delicate highly complex, and precious. Huma- 
nity may all the better avail itself of such a tool if all the world’s states—and peoples—agree 
once again to make proper use of it, and so contribute to its efficiency and universality. 
UNEsco must once more represent the whole world, with no exceptions. I pledge to do 
my best,in the course of my stewardship, to persuade those who stand outside to return 
or to join. 
But criticisms,not all of them unfair,have been leveled against this great instrument: 
and failings,where verified,must be made good. The purpose of sound management is, 
again, not an end in itself, but a duty to ensure that our institution fully discharges its great 
task asa true world service, responsible and accountable to the world—and to the world’s 
taxpayers. 
Our resources are therefore not unlimited,nor should we spread ourselves too thin. I 
propose that we streamline our activities within the limits of our budgets, and closely focus 
upon those programmes which are our true mandate—not for the sake of fashionable aus- 
terity, but in order to make a real impact where best we may, and where truly we must, pro- 
vide our needed service: in our ongoing war against poverty, through education and the 
nurturing of human resources. 
I suggest pursuit of our most practically conceived programmes, in co-operation with 
leading institutions, scientists and scholars around the world, in terms of our four great 
directives, on behalf of education,science,culture,and communication. 
UNESCO is a challenging paradox. It cannot lapse into a mere club for intellectuals, but 
it must serve as a forum for international intellectual exchange.It cannot pretend to be 
a research institution but must keep abreast of and stimulate research.It is not an opera- 
tional agency, yet it must see that global ethics for peace, justice and solidarity, through 
international co-operation in education, science, culture and communication, are both 
morally observed and tangibly applied. Finally, UNESCO is not a funding agency, although 
it must provide catalytic funds to generate further funding: in order to demonstrate that 
ideals only take shape through action... . 
In the whirl of this changing age, let us stand firm and faithful to our enduring pur- 
pose: building peace in the minds of men. [|

sion of his investiture as Director-General of UNESCO.)

### 118282: Forests: a hot deal for a cooler world

FORESTS: A HOT DEAL 
FOR A COOLER WORLD 
  
DP Sophie Boukhari 
Forests can play a key role in combating the greenhouse effect but current proposals for using 
them raise a thicket of thorny issues 
Why are industrialists so keen on 
A trees these days? After the Japanese 
vehicle-maker Toyota (see page 13) 
and others, the French car firm Peugeot 
launched a huge reforestation project in 
late 1999. The result will be 10 million 
trees growing on 12,000 deforested hec- 
tares in the heart of the Brazilian 
Amazon. 
The aim of the $10 million project, 
says Peugeot chief Jean-Martin Folz, is to 
“make the idea of a carbon sink a reality.” 
In other words, to show that reducing 
consumption of fossil fuels—gas, oil and 
coal—is not the only way to fight global 
warming. By using the ability of vegeta- 
tion to absorb and store carbon dioxide 
(CO,), the main greenhouse gas, the 
amount of CO, in the atmosphere can be 
reduced. 
Tropical forests: 
a controversial role 
Through the process of photosynthe- 
sis a growing tree gives off oxygen and 
absorbs water, light and CO,, which is 
why expanding forests are what is known 
as “carbon sinks”. Full-grown forests on 
the other hand cease to be carbon sinks 
and become carbon reservoirs. They store 
huge amounts of carbon above and below 
ground and play a neutral role in the CO, 
equation. The carbon dioxide given off 
when old trees decompose can be offset 
by that which is absorbed when young 
trees grow in their place. And when 
forests burn, they give off CO, and beco- 
me sources of carbon.That is the theory. 
In practice, however, very little is known 
about the global carbon cycle and the role 
of forests in it. 
It is also unclear how forests will react 
to global warming. “There are uncertain - 
ties regarding the implications of increa- 
sed CO, concentration in the atmosphere 
for photosynthesis, forest growth rates 
D Unesco Courier journalist 
10 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
and changes in carbon stocks in forests,” 
says Indian scientist N.H. Ravindranath, 
one of the three co-ordinators of a special 
report on forests produced by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). Today’s carbon sink can 
become a source of CO, tomorrow. 
According to currently available data, 
the world’s main forest carbon sinks are in 
the countries of the North (the United 
States, Canada, Europe and Russia). 
After centuries of deforestation, mainly to 
create farmland, these regions have been 
gaining trees again in the past 100 years 
or so. As a result of the revolution in 
intensive agriculture, less land is needed 
for farming. 
On the other hand, large-scale defo- 
restation is still taking place in tropical 
countries where land hunger is constantly 
increasing (see box opposite page). This 
contributes to the increased concentra- 
tion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphe- 
re. The role of tropical forests in this 
context is highly controversial. In theory, 
as mature forests they should absorb as 
much CO, as they give out. But recent 
studies suggest they actually absorb more 
CO, than was thought. In fact, says Youba 
Sokona, deputy director of Enda Tiers 
Monde, a non-governmental organiza- 
tion,“ “we have no clear idea of the state of 
forest resources or the way they behave in 
developing countries.” Forest sur veys are 
very expensive, and not many have been 
done in the countries of the South. The 
estimates of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) have sometimes been questioned. 
Carbon 
credits 
Despite all these unknown factors, the 
notion of carbon sinks has become highly 
topical—for political rather than scientific 
reasons. It came of age in 1997, when it 
was introduced into articles 3.3 and 3.4 
of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate 
Change. 
Under the protocol, which was the 
Many reforestation projects are underway in Brazil, but deforestation is still gaining ground.

PLANET 
- >» 
Dts o Wh)  
result of tough negotiations in the wake of 
the 1992 United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, the 
industrialized countries promised to redu- 
ce their annual net emissions of greenhou- 
se gases by an average 5 per cent a year 
until 2008-2012, using the 1990 level as a 
base. To do this, some countries, notably 
the United States, insisted on the esta- 
blishment of three “flexibility mecha- 
nisms”. 
The first involves setting up a market 
where the rich countries will bargain with 
each other to buy and sell emission per- 
mits. The second is a “joint implementa- 
tion” (JI) arrangement under which they 
will earn carbon credits in exchange for 
funding reduction of emissions in former- 
ly communist eastern Europe through, 
for example, industrial cleanup projects. 
The third is a “clean development mecha- 
nism” (CDM), which is like JI but ope- 
rates between industrialized and develo- 
ping countries. Many environmentalists 
have sharply criticized this “international 
trading in hot air” and accuse the coun- 
tries that are the worst polluters of see- 
king to shirk their obligation to thorough- 
ly revamp their own energy consumption 
practices. 
Including the carbon sink idea in the 
Kyoto Protocol is another way of making 
the Protocol’s application more “flexible”. 
Article 3.3 says that “direct human-indu- 
ced land use change and forestry activi- 
ties, limited to afforestation, reforestation 
and deforestation since 1990” can be 
used by states parties to meet their com- 
mitments. For example, a company may 
fund a reforestation project in its own 
country, or else a country like The 
Netherlands,say, could sponsor tree plan- 
tations in Poland. In 2008-2012, the 
amount of CO, these trees have absorbed 
or “sequestrated” will be calculated and 
counted as part of such countries’ reduc- 
tion in their own greenhouse gases. 
Article 3.4 adds, without going into 
specifics, that other human activities rela- 
ting to carbon sources and sinks can be 
taken into account. “These articles are 
last-minute compromises,” says Michel 
Raquet of Greenpeace Europe. “They 
were drafted without much idea of their 
implications or whether everyone agreed 
on the meaning of the terms used. In fact, 
they vary from one institute or country to 
DEFORESTATION GATHERS SPEED 
ver the last 150 years, says the World 
Resources Institute (WRI), deforestation and 
changes in land use have been responsible for 30 
per cent of the increase in greenhouse gas emis- 
sionsinto the atmosphere. 
At present, according to FAO, CO, emissions 
from these sources, especially in the tropics, 
represent a fifth of the world’s carbon dioxide 
emissions resulting from human activity. Forest 
clearance to create farmland or pasture is a big 
part of this. In the 1990s, Brazil emitted 27 times 
more CO, because of deforestation than from 
fossil fuel combustion, according to Biomass 
Users Network, a non-governmental organiza- 
tion.   
“Wood is usually burned on the spot because 
it's not worth keeping it,” says French forestry 
expert Arthur Riedacker. “It’s also too expensive 
to move. In Congo, it costs $130 a cubic metre to 
bring timber out of the forest to the coast, while 
pine wood or spruce only fetches $50 a cubic 
metre in France.” 
The WRI says that if nothing isdone, deforesta- 
tion could account for 15 per cent of the CO, in the 
atmosphere by 2050, with the rest mainly due to 
industrial pollution. Most of it will come from the 
Amazon region. After 2050, deforestation will decline 
because there will not be many forests left. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calcu- 
lates that 73 per cent of the world’s tropical forests

another.” Future negotiations will sort 
this out. 
These talks will also try to decide— 
this will be a far-reaching debate—whe- 
ther or not to include carbon sinks in the 
CDM. If they are included, rich countries 
will be able to fund afforestation or anti- 
deforestation projects in poor countries as 
a way of obtaining carbon credits, instead 
of carrying out often more costly schemes 
at home to curb emissions from industry 
or transport. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC), the scientific 
organ of the 1992 Convention,thinks that 
carbon sinks can play an important role. 
As the FAO report notes, “IPCC has esti- 
mated, with a medium level of confiden- 
ce, that globally, carbon sequestration 
from reduced deforestation, forest rege- 
neration and increased development of 
plantations and agro-forestry between 
1995 and 2050 could amount to 12 to 15 
per cent of fossil fuel carbon emissions 
over the same period.” 
Arthur Riedacker, a French expert 
involved in the IPCC’s work, also points 
out that such schemes produce biomass 
and timber, so reducing fossil fuel 
consumption. Biomass is a renewable 
energy source. Wood can replace plastic 
or concrete, whose manufacture uses 
hydrocarbons. But Ashley Mattoon of the 
Worldwatch Institute says the trade-off in 
12 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
carbon sinks may be “a major loophole 
[in the Protocol] which admits vast quan- 
tities of fossil carbon into the skies” and 
“encourages types of forestry that aren’t 
very good for forests.” 
Questionable 
gains 
To head off these dangers, everyone 
agrees the carbon sink idea should be very 
closely examined and tightly regulated. 
The IPCC, which will report back in 
2000, will have to be more precise about 
the meaning of the terms “afforestation”, 
“reforestation” and “deforestation” in 
article 3.3 so as to prevent abusive prac- 
tices developing. For example, the text 
currently says a country can chop down 
an old forest and replace it by one of fast- 
growing trees, notes Greenpeace expert 
Bill Hare.The felling would not be coun- 
ted in the country’s emissions but the 
reforestation would earn carbon credits. 
So the country involved would gain, but 
not the atmosphere or the environment, 
because an old forest and its soil contain 
more carbon, which would be released by 
the felling, than a managed forest ever 
will. Biodiversity would also suffer. 
Another problem would arise if Japan, 
say, were to fund a forest protection pro- 
ject in Malaysia. In return, it would ask 
for carbon credits equal to the emissions 
which the felling of the forest would have 
produced. But how can we be sure that 
the protection project is actually respon- 
sible for preventing the forest from being 
destroyed? And what is the point of pro- 
tecting, say, a stretch of African savannah 
if the local population can simply chop 
down trees further away? 
For the moment, the world is roughly 
divided into three camps about the issue 
of carbon sinks. One consists of several 
rich countries (including the U.S., New 
Zealand and Australia) that want a broad 
definition and flexible use of carbon cre- 
dits. In some countries, like New 
Zealand, carbon sequestration from tree 
plantations covers a very high percentage 
of their greenhouse gas emissions. If they 
are unrestrictedly taken into account in 
2008-2015, they will allow such countries 
to meet their commitments without 
taking any steps in areas such as industry, 
transport and human settlements. 
In the U.S., which has pledged to cut 
its emissions by 7 per cent over the next 
10 years, the carbon sink mechanism is 
being used to persuade Congress to drop 
its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, 
says Mattoon. The Clinton administra- 
tion argues that the sinks “could compri- 
se a significant portion of the country’s 
total required emissions reductions.” 
A recent article in New Scientist maga- 
zine said Washington is even pressing for 
article 3.4 to be amended to include

waste from wood products in the defini- 
tion of a carbon sink. It is certainly better 
to bury paper and wood waste in the 
ground than to burn it and release more 
CO, into the atmosphere. But how far is 
this going to go? “The spirit of Kyoto 
demands that we should focus on things 
that produce fewer greenhouse gases, 
which means encouraging energy-saving, 
transport reform and improved industrial 
processes and housing, with improve- 
ments in forestry practices as an extra,” 
says Riedacker. 
Conflicting 
interests 
A second group includes European 
countries which take a cautious stand and 
are waiting for the IPCC report before 
making up their minds. The third group is 
mostly made up of poor countries, which 
are divided on the issue, says 
Ravindranath. “They're interested in 
development, not so much in carbon,” 
says END A’s Sokona, who is a member of 
the IPCC working party. 
Everyone has different wishes and 
constraints as far as development goes. 
India, China and the countries of sou- 
theast Asia, which have competitive 
industries, seem opposed to introducing 
forestry projects into the CDM. They 
would prefer the rich countries to invest 
in them via industrial projects, which 
would include more technology transfers. 
But some Latin American countries,such 
as Costa Rica, are basing their develop- 
ment on eco-tourism, so they have an 
interest in improving their forests. 
Africa, where half of all greenhouse 
gas emissions are caused by deforestation, 
is hesitating because in a continent where 
food security is still the top priority, 
people fear farmland will be lost if trees 
are planted. But Africa’s weak industrial 
base means it will probably not benefit 
much from the CDM if forestry projects 
are not included in it. So some experts are 
in favour of it under certain conditions. 
“Protected parks don’t interest us,” 
says Sokona. “They mean moving people 
off land without giving them anything in 
return. It’s too easy for rich countries to 
come and plant trees in our countries,put 
a fence round them and earn carbon cre- 
dits. However, I'm in favour of agrofores- 
try, which meets our needs.” 
Few countries have taken a clear stand 
so far. Others are still making their calcu - 
lations and trying to work out their posi- 
tion. The real battle over the world’s 
forests will come after May 2000, when 
the IPCC will make its report. |

ndustrialists can no longer ignore the effects of 
their activity on the environment. In a world 
which is more and more polluted and threate- 
ned by global warming, their reputation and 
future depend on doing something about it. 
The Japanese vehicle-maker Toyota has 
understood this since the end of the 1980s. It 
launched its “Toyota Forest” programme in 
1992, the year of the Rio Earth Summit, with the 
goal of using biotechnology to turn trees into 
anti-pollution agents. 
Today Toyota is proud of its experimental 
forests, including Foresta Hills, half an hour by 
car from the company's headquarters. The firm 
is trying to revive satoyama, which are ancient 
protected hills on the edge of populated areas. 
They are a source of wood and prized items like 
matsutake mushrooms and urushi, Japanese 
lacquer. 
“In this forest, we're developing the same 
activities our ancestors did in the 19th century,” 
says Yasuhiko Komatsu, the project's chief. “We 
want to create satoyama for the 21st century.” 
The giant company’s engineers say they are 
trying to reduce vehicle emissions but cannot get 
rid of them completely. So other solutions have 
to be found—by using trees. 
At Foresta Hills, the effect of different kinds of 
trees on the level of carbon dioxide in the air can 
be measured. In some places it is 10 to 20 times 
lower than in others. The most “effective” trees 
are those which grow quickly, stand up to diffi- 
cult surroundings and resist diseases and 
insects, so these are the ones biologists want to 
learn how to cultivate. Increasing the number of 
chromosomes of some trees has boosted their 
ability to absorb toxic gases by a third. 
Toyota is also researching into how to speed 
up the growth of trees in very acidic soil with a 
view to the reforestation of southeast Asia, 
which has been devastated by deforestation. 
Recently, the company began organizing refo- 
restation activities outside Japan, and in August 
1998 joined with paper manufacturers to set up 
the firm of Australian Afforestation Pty. Over the 
next decade, 5,000 fast-growing, drought-resis- 
tant eucalyptus trees will be planted in Australia, 
later to be chopped down and made into paper. 
Toyota's work has drawn criticism however. 
Environmentalists are worried about the effects 
on the environment of genetically-modified spe- 
cies. Others argue that the main priority in figh- 
ting the greenhouse effect is to reduce emissions 
of pollutants and cut back on motor traffic. 
“The car-makers are planting trees to give 
themselves a nice green image while hoping 
their vehicle sales don’t drop,” says Michel 
Raquet of Greenpeace Europe. “What will they 
get in return? Carbon credits, even though there 
is no scientific guarantee that their forestry pro- 
jects will have any effect on the atmosphere.” 
“One of these days,” says Ashley Mattoon of 
Worldwatch Institute, “we will have to ask our- 
selves how much more time, energy and money 
should be spent on tinkering with nature and 
satisfying our dependence on fossil fuels.” HW

### 118284: Spare the rod, save the child

SPARE THE ROD, 
SAVE THE CHILD 
  
D Ethirajan Anbarasan 
The widespread use of corporal punishment in Kenyan schools has led to increasing dropout 
rates and in a few cases, to death 
student at Mobamba Secondary 
School in Kenya's Kisii district, repea- 
tedly denied allegations that he had brought 
a girl into the school compound one night 
last August, his teachers became furious. 
Four of the teachers kicked, hit and beat 
Omanga so hard with a huge stick that the 
boy fell unconscious. A month later he died 
in hospital as a result of severe damage to 
his kidneys and other internal injuries, 
according to family members. 
Omanga’s case is not isolated. Accor- 
ding to the Kenyan media corporal punish- 
ment has led to the deaths of at least six 
students in the last four years. While caning 
is a regular feature in schools, some stu- 
dents have suffered serious injuries which 
include “bruises and cuts, broken bones, 
knocked-out teeth and internal bleeding,” 
says a recent report from the New York- 
based non-governmental organization 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) titled Spare 
the Child: Corporal Punishment in Kenyan 
Schools. 
7 When Justus Omanga, a fourth grade 
An incentive to violence 
and revenge 
Kenya is not the only country in the 
world that still practises corporal punish- 
ment.Indeed, only 70 countries,beginning 
with Sweden in 1979, have banned the 
practice. But experts say Kenya is one of 
the worst offenders when it comes to vio- 
lence stemming from corporal punishment. 
“In Kenya corporal punishment against 
children in schools has reached dange- 
rously high levels,” says Yodon T honden, a 
Tibetan-American who led the five-mem- 
ber research team which prepared the 
HRW report. 
Apart from the brutality which is often, 
in Kenya at least,associated with the prac- 
tice, corporal punishment in itself can 
provoke anger in its victims, leading to 
resentment and low-self esteem. It can also

encourage violence and revenge as solu- 
tions to problems,experts say. 
Moreover, child rights activists contend 
that corporal punishment goes against the 
1989 United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, which affirms the chil- 
d’s need for care and protection. Article 19 
of the convention, which has been ratified 
by 191 countries including Kenya, speci- 
fies that states must take appropriate mea- 
sures to protect children from “all forms of 
physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, 
neglect or negligent treatment, maltreat- 
ment or exploitation.” 
The HRW report, based on a field 
study, including scores of interviews with 
students, teachers, parents and officials, 
says that Kenyan children are often puni- 
‘Some students told us that 
they dropped out of school 
because of severe beating by 
their teachers. This isin clear 
violation of children’s right to 
education’ 
shed for petty offences like coming late to 
school or wearing a torn uniform. 
The problem has dire implications for 
basic education. A recent study shows that 
the enrolment rate in primary schools is 
fast declining and only 42 per cent of those 
enrolled in first grade complete the pri- 
mary school cycle.The decline is, among 
other reasons,due to poverty and a hostile 
learning environment,say analysts. 
“Some students told us that they drop- 
ped out of school because of severe beating 
by their teachers. T his is in clear violation of 
children’s right to education,” says Thon- 
den. 
“So far no teacher has been convicted 
for these deaths,” says Jemimah Mwakisha, 
a journalist who has written extensively on 
the subject in Kenya’s leading newspaper 
Daily Nation. 
Neither are teachers commonly sen- 
tenced for inflicting serious injuries. Vic- 
tims often come from rural areas, where 
people don’t have the finances to hire a 
lawyer and where legal aid is poor. In some 
instances where teachers have been taken to 
court, they have gone unpunished, as it has 
been difficult to prove a motive in the killing 
as required under the criminal law, Mwa- 
kisha says. 
Parents scared 
to speak out 
Excessively harsh corporal punishment 
tends to be particularly common in the 
countryside.“In rural areas,parents don’t 
formally object to their children being bea- 
ten for fear they [the children] might be 
victimized further,” says M wakisha. 
In public, Kenyan education ministry 
officials have strongly denied the HRW alle- 
gations,stating that some isolated incidents 
in rural schools have been exaggerated. 
However, in private, a senior education 
ministry official admits that the report was 
“more or less correct.” He says teachers 
“brutally beat children in many schools 
without any proper reason. This is a prac- 
tice that can only be stopped by abolishing 
corporal punishment altogether.” 
Nevertheless the recent deaths and the 
report have triggered a debate in Kenya on 
banning corporal punishment, as other 
African countries including Namibia, Bur- 
kina Faso, South Africa and Ethiopia have 
done in recent years. 
According to government regulations, 
corporal punishment may be inflicted only 
in cases of continued or grave neglect of 
work, lying, bullying and gross insubordi- 
nation. The beating, with a cane no more 
than half an inch thick, can be given only by 
or in the presence of a head teacher. Regu- 
lations state that boys should be hit on the 
backside and girls on the palm of the hand. 
Students are not supposed to get more than 
six strokes as punishment and a written

“The rules are hardly followed. Tea- 
chers use clubs, bamboo canes, sometimes 
even a rubber whip to beat the students,” 
says Thonden. 
For many teachers, a tool to cope 
with big classes 
A strong constituency of Kenyan tea- 
chers is in favour of retaining corporal 
punishment, even though they concede 
more restrictions are required. A few years 
ago when the Director of Education tried to 
make the practice illegal, the teachers’union 
said it would not recognize such a ban. 
Many teachers argue that without cor- 
poral punishment the schools would des- 
cend into chaos and that children would 
become even more unruly by the time they 
reached high school. In fact, they believe 
that in the long run corporal punishment 
means less rather than more violence. 
“Western countries give excessive freedom 
to their children. Look at the violent inci- 
dents in many schools in the United 
States,” says Lawrence Kahindi Majali, 
Assistant Secretary General of the Kenya 
National Union of Teachers (KNUT). 
Many Kenyan teachers also contend 
that corporal punishment is one of the few 
disciplinary tools available given large class 
sizes. According to a government report 
there are 5,718,700 students and 192,000 
teachers at primary school level, giving a 
teacher-pupil ratio of 1:31. In many schools 
classes of 50-60 students are common. 
‘When we were under British 
rule, those who refused to pay 
taxes or those who did not 
obey the rules were caned in 
public. The use of the cane was 
a symbol of authority and the 
legacy continues 
The burden is heaviest in rural areas 
where retired and transferred teachers’ 
posts are often left vacant. As a result, 
authorities frequently combine two or three 
schools in a region, putting additional pres- 
sure on the existing teaching staff. 
Teachers also try to justify corporal 
punishment by citing Kenya’s long tradi- 
tion. “When we were under British rule, 
those who refused to pay taxes or those who 
did not obey the rules were caned in public. 
The use of the cane was a symbol of autho- 
rity and the legacy continues,” says M ajali. 
Many teachers admit that they often 
carry out corporal punishment without the 
presence of the headmaster. In violation of 
the rules,the students are sometimes bea- 
ten all over the body, and often records of 
corporal punishment are not kept in 
schools. 
Stephen P, a fifth grade student in Moi 
primary school in Nairobi, says teachers 
cane him or slap him regularly. His offences 
include coming late to school and not 
paying school fees on time. Elizabeth Z, 
who isin the fourth standard, says teachers 
slap her and pinch her on the cheeks for 
not doing homework. 
“My children were not treated well by 
the teachers after I complained about 
caning by their class teacher,” says Deborah 
N,a mother of two living in Nairobi. 
Teachers are also afraid. They quote a 
growing number of instances in which tea- 
chers have been attacked by students. In

WORLD OF LEARNING 
one extreme case,a class prefect was killed 
by students in the town of N yeri, near Nai- 
robi, early this year for being too strict with 
them. 
The fact that corporal punishment 
leads so often to brutality may be sympto- 
matic of the pressures facing the whole tea- 
ching profession. Teachers’ salaries—ran- 
ging from 4,000 Kenyan shillings ($60) to 
about 15,000 ($200) a month—are among 
the lowest in the civil service. Teachers seem 
to take their frustrations out on their stu- 
dents, say experts. “Low salaries reduce 
teacher morale, and many of the lowest- 
paid teachers are forced to find housing in 
slum areas,” says the HRW report. 
Mounting tension 
Education ministry officials say gui- 
dance counsellors in secondary schools 
encourage teachers to adopt methods to 
deal with depressed or problem students 
and thus avoid tensions leading to corporal 
punishment. 
The counsellor discusses with the 
concerned student why he or she commit- 
 
‘Low salaries reduce 
teacher morale, and many 
of the lowest-paid teachers 
are forced to find housing 
in slum areas’ 
ted an offence and tries to find solutions. 
But officials admit that there are not 
enough counsellors in schools due to finan- 
cial constraints and even those who have 
been posted as counsellors undertake other 
responsibilities due to shortage of staff. 
Teachers in favour of reducing corporal 
punishment feel that the best place for 
introducing alternative disciplinary 
methods is the Teacher Training Pro- 
grammes. At present teachers say that they 
hardly spend more than four to five hours 
on classroom management during their ini- 
tial two-year training period for primary 
school. 
Realizing the gravity of the problem, 
many non-governmental organizations 
have now joined the campaign to abolish 
HEAVY HANDED TREATMENT 
 
orporal punishment is legal notonly in Kenya, 
but also in a number of other east African 
countries, including Tanzania, Sudan and Somalia. 
Governments complain that there are not enough 
resources and trained personnel to reduce the size 
of big classes, which some teachers find difficult to 
manage without corporal punishment. 
In Tanzania, a few students have reportedly 
died after severe corporal punishment in schools. 
Many teachers do not like using this form of 
punishment but they “think it is the easiest way to 
manage big classes,” says Dale Chandler, Executive 
Director of Kuleana, a Centre for Children’s Rights 
based in Tanzania. 
Kuleana works with other NGOs in the region to 
raise awareness among teachers and parents of 
the negative aspects of corporal punishment. 
Chandler says the campaign aims to drive home the 
point that if you mistreat children they tend to 
disobey rules when they become adults. 
A legal ban on corporal punishment in schools 
has not improved matters in Ethiopia. “Students 
continue to be beaten by teachers despite the ban 
enforced in 1988,” says Tibebu Bogaie, programme 
co-ordinator of “Swedish Save the Children”, an 
NGO based in Addis Ababa. The organization, 
which published a report on corporal punishment 
in Ethiopia early this year, is campaigning against 
the practice in schools aswell asin homes. 
In Sudan, teachers say schools run by   
missionaries in the south organize guidance and 
counselling programmes for students to identify rea- 
sons for their misbehaviour. But they warn that 
ever growing classes might force them to switch to 
corporal punishment to deal with indiscipline. 
However, experts disagree with the view that 
indiscipline can be tackled only by corporal punish- 
ment. Peter Newell, co-ordinator of EPOCH-World- 
wide, an NGO campaigning against corporal 
punishment, says that in countries where the prac- 
tice wasbanned decades ago “schools are not fal- 
ling apart due to indiscipline. Beating can’t be an 
excuse for lack of resources. It is a fundamental 
breach of human rights.” [|

corporal punishment and have started wor- 
king with teachers to minimize its use until 
the law is changed. 
“Until a legal sanction is obtained, we 
decided it would be better to work with the 
teachers,” says Jacqueline Anam-Mogeni, 
child rights adviser at the Netherlands 
Development Organization (NDO). 
The Nairobi-based NDO organizes 
workshops and training programmes to 
help teachers to get to grips with their pro- 
blems and encourage them to use counsel- 
ling methods and other forms of punish- 
ment,such as manual work. 
Alternative 
solutions 
NDO selects a group of teachers and 
volunteers from other non-governmental 
organizations from a particular region 
where corporal punishment incidents are 
high, and organizes workshops exposing 
them to human rights and child rights 
issues. After a week's training, the teachers 
go back to their schools and return for eva- 
luation every three months. 
“We first ask the participants how they 
treat their own children at home. Once they 
realize there is a problem they themselves 
come up with alternative solutions,” says 
Mogeni. 
The first session attracted 24 partici- 
pants from different parts of Kenya.Some 
teachers say their attitude towards children 
has changed after participating in the 
course. 
“Before I went for the child rights trai- 
ning, I always viewed the punishment as 
part of the learning process. Now I work 
with the pupils almost at a level of part- 
nership,” says Esther Nyakio Ngugi, a tea- 
cher at Kirigiti Girls Approved school in 
Kiambu. 
Teachers who participated in the pro- 
gramme say they have realized that they 
were basically driving away students from 
schools due to constant beatings. 
“This is only a beginning. We need 
more government and public support till 
we finally abolish corporal punishment,” 
says Mogeni. [|

at the turn of the millennium, on the 
future, this Focus section, in contrast, 
looks back at the past. How, it asks, have 
nations that endured atrocities in the 
second half of this century come to terms 
with their ordeal? What obstacles have lain 
in their path? Between remembrance and 
forgetting, how can they make peace with 
the past and build the foundations for a 
better future? 
In a scene-setting article, Tzvetan 
Todorov explains why we ought to 
remember the past but not endlessly rake 
over it. Rosalina Tuyuc from Guatemala 
develops this idea and insists that the first 
step to reconciliation involves knowing who 
to forgive. 
The ways in which societies react to 
terrible experiences are shaped by their 
history, the forces that propel them forward 
or hold them back. Post-apartheid South 
Africa made a new departure, as Njabulo 
Ndebele points out, when it brokered a deal 
offering amnesty in return for truth. But 
although this may have helped to ease the 
reconciliation process, some victims protest 
that freedom should not be bought by 
confessing to a crime. In Chile, Oscar Godoy 
notes that amnesty for crimes committed 
under the dictatorship has smoothed the 
transition to democracy, but, say Fabiola 
Letelier and Victor Espinoza, it has not 
softened grim memories. 
In Russia, the work of memory is 
incomplete. In Cambodia it is to a large 
extent blocked, laments film-maker Rithy 
Panh, and in Rwanda it is impossible, 
according to Benjamin Sehene. A similar 
situation exists in Bosnia. 
Finally, Canadian jurist Louise Arbour 
hopes that the increasingly long arm of 
international law, by establishing 
irrefutable facts, can at least prevent the 
past from being mythologized and may 
even prevent crimes against humanity.

The evil that men do... 
 
D Tzvetan Todorov 
The collective memory must be free to come to terms with grief and shape a better future 
It seems unjust to 
ask victims to protect 
those who tormented 
them yesterday, and 
yet this is the 
responsibility they 
must now shoulder.

United Nations Special 
Representative for Kosovo

D wr Todorov, who was born in 
Bulgaria and has lived in 
France since 1963, is a director 
of studies at the French 
National Scientific Research 
Institute (CNRS). His books 
translated into English include 
Morals of History (University of 
Minnesota Press, 1995), French

the Present (Harvard 
University Press, 1993). 
18 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
¢ e must draw a veil over all the horrors 
W- the past,” said Winston Churchill not 
long after the end of the Second World 
War. Around the same time, the American philoso- 
pher George Santayana issued a warning, often 
repeated since, to the effect that “those who forget 
the past are condemned to repeat it.” For those of 
us who have experienced the painful history of the 
20th century, which of these two injunctions is the 
most useful? What should we do—forget or 
remember? 
The two operations are contradictory in 
appearance only. Remembering is always, by defi- 
nition, an interaction between forgetting (erasu- 
re) and complete preservation of the past—some- 
thing that is virtually impossible. The Argentine 
writer Jorge Luis Borges creates a character in his 
short story Funes el memorioso (Funes the 
M emorious) who remembers every detail of his 
life. It is a terrifying experience. 
Memory selects from the past what seems 
important for the individual or for the communi- 
ty. It organizes this selection and imprints its 
values on it. Peoples prefer to remember the glo- 
rious pages of their history rather than shameful 
episodes, and individuals often try unsuccessfully 
to free themselves from the memory of a trauma- 
tic event. 
How to live with painful memories 
Why do we need to remember? Because the 
past is the very core of our individual or collecti- 
ve identity. If we do not have a sense of our own 
identity and the confirmation of our existence 
that it provides, we feel threatened and paralyzed. 
The need for an identity is thus quite legitimate. 
We have to know who we are and what group we 
belong to. But people, like groups, live among 
other people and other groups. And so it is not 
enough simply to say that everyone has the right 
to exist. We also have to consider how our exerci- 
se of this right affects the existence of others. In 
the public arena, not all reminders of the past are 
worthy ones, and those that encourage revenge 
are always suspect. 
The victims of evil may, in their personal lives, 
be tempted to try to forget the experience com- 
pletely, blotting out painful or humiliating memo- 
ries. To a woman who has been raped, for 
example, or a child who has been the victim of 
incest, might it not be better to act as if these 
traumatic events never happened? We know from 
people’s reactions that this is unwise, because 
such a blanket refusal to remember is dangerous. 
Repressed memories remain more alive than ever 
and give rise to severe neuroses. It is better to 
accept a distressing past than to deny or repress 
it. The important thing is not to go to the other 
extreme and endlessly brood over it, but to gra- 
dually distance oneself from it and neutralize it— 
in a sense to tame it. 
This is how mourning functions in our lives. 
First we refuse to accept the loss we have expe- 
rienced and we suffer terribly from the sudden 
absence of a loved one. Later,while never ceasing 
to love them, we give them a special status—they 
are neither absent nor present as they were befo- 
re. A distancing process develops, and eases the 
pain. 
An act of faith in the future 
Communities are rarely tempted to try to for- 
get completely evil events that have befallen 
them.Afro-Americans today do not seek to forget 
the trauma of slavery their ancestors suffered. The 
descendants of the people who were shot and 
burned to death in Oradour-sur-Glane! in 1944, 
do not want the crime to be forgotten.In fact they 
want to preserve the ruins of the village left by the 
event. 
Here too, as in the case of individuals, it might 
be hoped that the barren alternatives of totally 
erasing the past or endlessly poring over it could 
be avoided.The suffering should be inscribed in 
the collective memory, but only so that it can 
increase our capacity to face the future. This is 
what pardons and amnesties are for. They are jus- 
tified when crimes have been publicly admitted, 
not to make sure they are forgotten but to let 
bygones be bygones and give the present a new 
chance. Were Israelis and Palestinians not right 
when they met in Brussels in March 1998 and 
noted that “just to start talking to each other, we 
have to leave the past in the past”? 
When Churchill called for for a veil to be 
drawn over past horrors, he was right in a sense, 
but his injunction must be qualified by all kinds 
of conditions. No one should prevent memory 
from being regained. Before we turn the page, 
said future Bulgarian president Jeliu Jelev after 
the fall of communism, we should first read it. 
And forgetting means very different things to evil- 
doers and to their victims. For the latter, it is an 
act of generosity and faith in the future; for the 
1.A French village where the SS massacred 642 persons as 
a reprisal for attacks by the Resistance.

Memory: making peace with a violent past 
 
Portraits of people who disappeared under the Pinochet regime look out from a wall in Santiago de Chiles Humachuco Renca neighbourhood. 
former it results from cowardice and refusal to 
accept responsibility. 
Yet is remembering the past enough to prevent 
it from repeating itself, as Santayana seems to say? 
Far from it. In fact, the opposite usually happens. 
Today’s aggressor finds justification for his actions 
in a past in which he was a victim. Serb nationalists 
have sought justification by looking very far 
back—to their military defeat by the Turks in 
Kosovo in the 14th century. 
The French justified their belligerence in 1914 
by referring to the injustice they had suffered in 
1871. Hitler found reasons in the humiliating 
Treaty of Versailles at the end of the First World 
War to convince Germans to embark on the 
Second. And after the Second World War, the fact 
that the French had been victims of Nazi brutality 
did not prevent them—in many cases the same 
people who had joined the army after fighting in 
the resistance—from attacking and torturing civi- 
lians in Indochina and Algeria. Those who do not 
forget the past also run the risk of repeating it by 
reversing their role: there is nothing to stop a vic- 
tim from later becoming an aggressor. The memo- 
ry of the genocide which the Jews suffered is vivid 
in Israel, yet the Palestinians have in turn been vic- 
tims of injustice. 
Remember to forget! 
Immanuel Kant, 
German philosopher 
(1724-1804) 
EE 
A person or a community may need to appro- 
priate the memory of a past hero or—more sur- 
prisingly—a victim as a way of asserting their 
right to exist. This serves their interests, but does 
not make them any more virtuous. It can in fact 
blind them to injustices they are responsible for in 
the present. 
The limits of this kind of remembering, which 
emphasizes the roles of the hero and the victim, 
were illustrated during the ceremonies held in 
1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the bom- 
bing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the United 
States,people were only interested in recalling the 
heroic role of the U.S. in defeating Japanese mili- 
tarism. In Japan, attention focused on the victims 
of the atomic bombs. 
But there is a lot to be said for rising above 
one’s own suffering and that of one’s relatives and 
opening up to the suffering of others, and not 
claiming an exclusive right to the status of former 
victim. By the same token, accepting the wrongs 
we have done ourselves—even if they were not as 
serious as the wrongs done to us—can change us 
for the better. 
The past has no rights of its own. It must 
serve the present, just as the duty to remember 
must serve the cause of justice. [|

### 118286: Building blocks of international justice

Building blocks 
of international justice 
War crimes presuppose combat between nations. Genocide and crimes against humanity, on 
the other hand, may be committed during conflicts within states. An international criminal 
court to try these offences is in the works. 
There, at Auschwitz, 
something happened 
that could not 
previously have been 
imagined. There 
people touched the 
profound layer of 
solidarity between all 
those who have a 
human face, the 
essence of the 
relationship between 
man and man. ... 
Auschwitz 
transformed the 
conditions of 
permanence in 
relations between 
human beings. 
J rgen Habermas, 
German sociologist (1929- ) 
1
20 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
Crimes against 
humanity 
The first definition of these crimes was given 
in the Charter of the International Military 
Tribunal set up by the Allies to prosecute the 
major Nazi war criminals (the Nuremberg 
Tribunal) in 1945. It runs as follows: “murder, 
extermination, enslavement, deportation, and 
other inhumane acts committed against any civi- 
lian population, before or during the war, or per- 
secutions on political, racial or religious grounds 
in execution of or in connection with any crime 
within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,whether or 
not in violation of the domestic law of the coun- 
try where perpetrated.” 
The United Nations Convention on the Non- 
Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War 
Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 1968 
added the following provision:“eviction by armed 
attack or occupation and inhuman acts resulting 
from the policy of apartheid, and the crime of 
genocide.” 
Genocide 
This term coined by Raphael Lemkin, a 
Polish-born American scholar, comes from the 
Greek word genos (race or tribe) and the Latin 
suffix cide (from caedere, to kill). 
Regarded as the most serious crime against 
humanity, it was legally defined by the 
Convention for the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide, which was unani- 
mously adopted by the United Nations General 
Assembly on December 9, 1948, entered into 
force in 1951, and has so far been ratified by 130 
states. Three major conditions for the identifica- 
tion of genocide (article 2) are: 
1) The victims must belong to a national, ethni- 
cal, racial or religious group, as such. Political, 
economic or cultural groups (e.g. the victims of 
the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia) are thus 
excluded. 
2) The members of this group are killed or perse- 
cuted because of their membership of the group. 
3) Genocide is a planned collective crime com- 
mitted by those who hold state power, on their 
behalf or with their express or tacit consent. 
Article 3 defines as punishable acts: genocide; 
conspiracy to commit genocide;direct and public 
incitement to commit genocide; an attempt to 
commit genocide; and complicity in genocide. 
Article 4 stipulates that all persons commit- 
ting genocide shall be punished, whether they are 
constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials 
or private individuals. 
The International 
Criminal Court (ICC) 
The notion of an international penal tribunal 
is mentioned in the 1948 Genocide Convention. 
But it was not until 1998 that 120 countries (out 
of 160 participants) meeting in Rome adopted a 
statute for a permanent International Criminal 
Court (ICC) to sit in The Hague (Netherlands). 
The Court will be created when 60 states have 
ratified the treaty on its statutes, a process which 
should take two or three years. 
The ICC will have (non-retroactive) jurisdic- 
tion over war crimes, crimes against humanity, 
and genocide, under certain conditions. 
Signatories have the opportunity not to recognize 
its jurisdiction over war crimes. 
Ad hoc 
War Crimes Tribunals 
The War Crimes Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia was set up by a resolution of the UN 
Security Council in May 1993. Based in The 
Hague, it is empowered to prosecute those char- 
ged with serious violations of international law on 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia, including 
war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genoci- 
de. 
So far 91 persons have been charged (inclu- 
ding Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic), 31 
of whom are in custody. Sentences ranging from 
seven days to 20 years have been handed down to 
eight defendants. Four trials are currently being 
held. 
The Tribunal for Rwanda, based in Arusha, 
Tanzania, was set up by the UN Security Council 
in November 1994. It has jurisdiction over the 
same crimes as the above, committed in Rwanda 
or neighbouring countries between January and 
December 1994. 
So far, 48 persons have been charged, 38 of 
whom are in custody. Five defendants have been 
sentenced, including three to life imprisonment 
for genocide. Three trials are currently being 
held. [|

### 118287: We can't forgive until we have justice

We can t forgive until 
  
One night in June 1982, the Guatemalan army 
came and took her father away. “FranciscoTuyuc is 
dead,” she was later told by the military, who never returned 
his body. Another night, in May 1985, they took away her 
husband, a peasant leader: 
But Rosalina, a 43-year-old K akchiquel M ayan 
Indian, was not deterred and in 1988 she founded the 
N ational A ssociation of Guatemalan Widows ( Conavi- 
gua), whose 15,000 members are today fighting to ensure 
the victims of the country’s civil war are not forgotten. In 
1995, Rosalina was elected to parliament as a deputy for the 
coalition of left-wing parties. 
Can time ease the pain for those who have lost 
a loved one? 
No, you never find peace from that. My children 
still ask me what’s happened to their father and if 
he’s coming home. We relatives of people who've 
disappeared are looking for our loved ones, and 
we don’t find them,either dead or alive.Now that 
the state has admitted that abuses occurred, it has 
a moral duty to tell us where our dead are buried. 
Many of them were executed at military bases. In 
the name of reconciliation, the army must say 
where they are. Most people just want to give 
their spouses or children a Christian burial. 
Have the aims of Conavigua changed since the 
peace agreement was signed in 1996 and the 
Historical Clarification Commission s report 
was published in February 1999? 
The report confirmed we'd been right about the extent 
of the repression. Now we're fighting to get the peace 
accords applied and for Indian rights to be recogni- 
zed. But we’ll continue to seek compensation for vic- 
tims of the war, to be told where the mass graves are 
and to bring impunity to an end. 
What kind of compensation? 
The government has launched a plan to compen- 
sate communities—by introducing electrification 
and building schools, roads and bridges—but it’s 
forgotten the widows. We want direct individual 
compensation for the women themselves,including 
a psychological support programme, scholarships 
for their children and help in recovering their rela- 
tives’bodies from unmarked graves. 
Can anything more be done to fight impunity? 
Keep on trying those responsible. We don’t want 
revenge, we want justice. We’d like to take matters 
to an international court because it’s very hard in 
Guatemala to obtain justice.The trials are costly, 
they drag on for years and the results are not very 
credible. But we're going to bring to court at least 
a few of the 80,000 cases we’ve listed. 
How do you balance the demands of the vic- 
tims families and political reality, which 
Ro Tuyuc has spent the past 17 years waiting.

22 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
African journalist Allister Sparks describes how 
Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress 
(ANC), and the apartheid government of South 
Africa were forced to recognize the need for a nego- 
tiated settlement. In a crucial meeting between the 
ANC and the right-wing generals of the South Afri- 
can armed forces,Mandela declared: 
“ “If you want to go to war, I must be honest 
and admit that we cannot stand up to you on the 
battlefield. We don’t have the resources. It will be a 
long and bitter struggle, many people will die and 
the country may be reduced to ashes. But you must 
remember two things. You cannot win because of 
our numbers: you cannot kill us all. And you cannot 
win because of the international community. They 
will rally to our support and they will stand with 
us.” General Viljoen was forced to agree. The two 
men looked at each other... [and] faced the truth 
of their mutual dependency.” 
This declaration, and its acceptance by everyone 
at that meeting, illustrates one of the major factors that 
led to the foundation of theTruth and Reconciliation 
Commission (TRC) in 1995 (see box). The basis of 
any compromise is that contending parties display a 
willingness to give up irreconcilable goals, and then 
enter into an agreement that yields substantial bene- 
fits to all parties. T he apartheid government of South 
Africa desired to continue to hold on to the reins of 
power, but was willing to allow for increased political 
participation by blacks. The liberation movement,on 
the other hand, desired the complete removal of white 
power. Neither of these goals seemed achievable 
without an all-out war. It seemed in the best interest 
of all to avoid such a situation. 
One of the demands of the beleaguered apar- 
theid government was that in exchange for loss of 
power there should be a blanket amnesty for all the 
agents of apartheid,particularly the police and the 
armed forces. But while such an outcome would be 
beneficial to whites, it would not enjoy the support of 
those who were victims of apartheid. They would 
rightly feel that the beneficiaries and enforcers of 
apartheid were getting away too easily. The worst 
outcome of such a solution would be that black 
South Africans, victims of apartheid, would lose 
confidence in any of their leaders who could accept 
such a solution. 
The flaw in this equation 1s that it does not offer 
n his book Tomorrow is Another Country, South a substantial benefit for both sides, and therefore 
does not inspire universal confidence. What was 
finally agreed upon was conditional amnesty. 
Firstly, the victims of apartheid should have the 
opportunity to tell what happened to them, and for 
their sufferings to be publicly acknowledged. 
Secondly, the perpetrators of political crimes should 
account for their deeds by making full and truthful 
disclosure of their actions. Lastly, reparations 
should be made to the victims. 
An important aspect of the amnesty process is the 
stipulation that the life of the TRC be prescribed, 
on the grounds that a time frame would provide an 
incentive for perpetrators wishing to come forward 
and, after making full disclosure, to be amnistied. 
Failure to take advantage of the process within the 
prescribed time would open perpetrators to prose- 
cution in the ordinary courts of law. 
The shame of public exposure 
During the hearings held by the TRC, harro- 
wing stories of suffering and cruelty were heard. 
Did the process result in reconciliation? 
One strong criticism of the amnesty process is 
that it frustrates justice and the desire for punish- 
ment. This does not take into account the fact that 
many of the recipients of amnesty experience a kind 
of punishment they never anticipated: the shame 
of being publicly exposed. The exposure of their 
participation in despicable acts of cruelty has in 
some cases resulted in broken families,disorienta- 
tion and loss of self-esteem—a form of punishment 
that can arguably be far more devastating than that 
exacted by an ordinary jail sentence. Equally, the 
contrition leading to a plea for forgiveness,as part 
of a quest for reacceptance in society, can be far 
more restorative than the hoped-for rehabilitative 
effects of an ordinary prison term. The cure in the 
method of the TRC is located within social practice 
rather than in the artificiality of punitive isolation. 
This experience raises legitimate questions about 
traditional methods of retributive justice. 
It can be said that as a result of the TRC ,South 
Africa has become a more sensitive and a more com- 
plex society. South Africans have been forced to 
confront the complex contradictions of the human 
condition, and the need to devise adequate social 
arrangements to deal with them. The healing that 
results will not be instant. It will come from the

new tendency for South Africans to be willing to 
negotiate their way through social, intellectual, reli- 
gious, political and cultural diversity. In sum, it will 
come from the progressive accumulation of ethical 
and moral insights. 
Certainly, some objectives have been achieved. 
No South African,particularly white South Africans, 
can ever claim ignorance of how apartheid disrupted 
and destroyed the lives of millions of black people in 
the name of the white electorate. All South Africans 
can now claim to have a common base of knowledge 
about where they have come from, particularly in 
the last 50 years, and this is an essential foundation 
for the emergence of a new national value system. 
Public acknowledgment of South Africa’s history of 
racism represents a form of reconciliation. 
Moving towards social justice 
The TRC has not by any means been a smooth 
process. Many whites, particularly among Afrika- 
ners, felt that the TRC was a punitive witch-hunt, 
targeting them as a community. This criticism did 
not take into account the fact that the TRC also 
addressed gross human rights violations perpetra- 
ted by the liberation movements themselves. The 
even-handedness of the TRC in this regard is very 
clear in its report,and could itself be regarded as a 
significant contribution to reconciliation. 
There are people who are not happy with the 
amnesty mechanism and strongly feel that justice has 
been compromised (see next page). Fortunately, a 
negotiated transition ensured there were functioning 
institutions in place for citizens to exercise their rights. 
Reconciliation is not a single event. It is a process. 
The TRC was a mechanism to deal with enormous 
human tensions which could have exploded with 
devastating consequences. It enabled South Africans 
to navigate successfully through very rough seas. The 
question is whether after its second democratic elec- 
tions South Africa has the will and resourcefulness to 
take full advantage of the foundation it has inherited. 
Continuing disparities in wealth,housing, education, 
and health between blacks and whites indicate that the 
process of reconciliation must move to a second stage: 
the achievement of social justice. In this regard, the 
definitive test of a new democratic society is underway. 
But the disintegration of the South African state 
through racial conflict is unlikely in the foreseeable 
future. This outcome is a highly significant measure of

    hy should victims of apartheid accept that the 
Ws African Truth and Reconciliation C om- 
mission (TRC) gave amnesty to assassins and 
mass killers of the former apartheid regime?T his is 
just one of the questions asked by critics of the TRC 
process inside the country. At the heart of all criticism 
is the legal power given to the commission to grant 
amnesty, under certain conditions to people who com- 
mitted politically motivated crimes between 1960 and 
1994. Amnesty means a person can never be crimi- 
nally charged with that crime, nor can he be sued in 
a civil court for damages resulting from that act. 
More than 7,000 people applied for amnesty, 
including two former cabinet ministers of Prime 
Minister P.W. Botha’s government and several of 
his police generals. Most have been granted amnesty, 
although several cases are still under consideration. 
Very often, the families of the victims murdered 
by former policemen and soldiers, and in a few cases 
by members of the two liberation armies, have rejected 
the entire notion of amnesty. The most prominent 
include the widow and son of Black Consciousness 
leader Steve Biko, who was beaten to death in a cell 
by policemen, and the family of Griffiths Mxenge, a 
black lawyer whose throat was cut by three policemen 
because he represented anti-apartheid activists. 
They argue that the provision for amnesty robs 
them of any sense of justice. In their view, murderers 
should face a criminal trial and be jailed—failing to 
do so cheapens the lives of their victims. Simply confes- 
sing to these brutal acts should not be enough to buy 
the perpetrators complete freedom, they argue. T hey 
are also against the provision that no civil claims may 
be made against the killers once they receive amnesty, 
arguing that it cuts out the chance of obtaining com- 
pensation for the death of a breadwinner to their fami- 
lies as well as for pain and suffering. 
The counter-argument, stated many times by 
Commission chairperson Desmond Tutu, is that it 
would not be in the interest of national reconciliation 
to send hundreds of former policemen, soldiers and 
even politicians to jail. Nonetheless,two of the worst 
killers in the apartheid police force, Eugene de Kock 
(whose request for amnesty is pending) and Ferdi Bar- 
nard (who did not ask for it), were prosecuted and 
given life sentences. Wouter Basson, the head of the 
former government’s Chemical and Biological War- 
fare programme, is currently on trial. T here isno evi- 
dence to suggest that these cases undermined the 
reconciliation process in any way. 
Another argument often put forward in favour of 
amnesty is that much, if not most, of the information 
the TRC obtained about the evils committed by the 
apartheid governments was disclosed to them through 
the amnesty applications of perpetrators of gross human 
rights violations. If it were not for these statements, the 
truth about a large number of unexplained events and 
unsolved murders would not have come out. And for 
the nation asa whole, if there had to be a tradeoff, truth 
was considered more important than justice. 
New heroes 
The amnesty applications of Phila Ndwandwe’s 
murderers is a case in point. The young mother of a 
babyboy and a unit commander of the African Natio- 
nal Congress army, Ndwandwe was stationed with 
her unit in neighbouring Swaziland when she crossed 
the border one day, never to be seen again. For many 
years the rumours dogged her family that she could 
possibly have been a collaborator of the apartheid 
government. Then the story came out in the amnesty 
application of four policemen. T hey had lured her over 
the border with a false message, and then kept her in a 
desolate house. There they assaulted and tortured her 
in an effort to get her to join the apartheid police or 
tell them her unit’s secrets. According to the police- 
men’s statements, she told them she would prefer to 
die. T hey shot her in the head and buried her. 
Phila Ndwandwe’s remains were dug up and 
reburied at a huge public funeral, where her nine- 
year-old son received a medal for exceptional bra- 
very on behalf of his dead mother. Instead of Phila 
Ndwandwe being remembered as an apartheid col- 
laborator,South Africa gained a new hero. [|

officials during the military dictatorship is not 
a priority in the current political debate.Chi- 
leans have been saying this since 1990 in political 
speeches, in the media and through public opinion 
polls. Yet at regular intervals, this serious issue flares 
up in the national debate.When it does, political 
figures feel obliged to make amends, but as a rule 
they prefer to let time do its work. Is this passivity 
or a laissez faire attitude that should be legally 
condemned? 
“Justice as far as possible,” was the line taken by 
Patricio Aylwin while he was president. The work of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (see box 
page 27) formed part of this approach. Its aim was 
to compile a list of victims of human rights violations 
under the military regime and identify the guilty par- 
ties. The idea was to establish the truth, award 
material and moral compensation to the victims, and 
lay the foundations of national reconciliation.But 
the Commission’s work has been limited by an 
amnesty law passed under the military regime. In 
other words, its role has been largely symbolic: to 
T: question of human rights violations by state preserve the history of the repression in the collec- 
tive memory. 
The Commission’s report has nevertheless had 
a considerable impact. T he truth began to come out, 
opening up new opportunities for “justice as far as 
possible”. Under the current president, Eduardo 
Frei, the courts have handed out prison sentences 
to the former head of the DIN A, the dictatorship’s 
secret police,and to other military and police offi- 
cers involved in the repression. 
But two big issues have been put on the back 
burner—the crimes covered by the amnesty law 
(committed between 1973 and 1978) and the res- 
ponsibility of General Augusto Pinochet. Many

sentenced in Chile for the murder in Washington of 
Orlando Letelier, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Allende 
government,because Chile’s amnesty law does not cover 
crimes committed abroad. In July 1999, in a decision 
described as “historic”, Chile’s Supreme Court confirmed 
the indictment of high-ranking officers on the grounds that 
when victims’ bodies could not be found, the crimes 
involved were “permanent and not subject to limitation” 
and therefore not covered by the amnesty law. Editor

### 118290: Chile: doing a deal with memory

Chileans and foreigners wonder why a democratic 
government has not managed to repeal a law which 
seems a disgrace and was passed in undemocratic 
circumstances. 
How is it that Pinochet has remained beyond the 
reach of the law and that his political and criminal 
responsibility has not been established ?T he answers 
to these questions are connected to the special 
nature of Chile’s transition to democracy, which 
includes an unspoken agreement to keep the 
amnesty law on the books and guarantee immunity 
for Pinochet. The transition is the result of a pact, 
whose effects have been strengthened by the exis- 
tence of a right-wing electorate comprising up to 40 
per cent of voters and an electoral system that pre- 
vents a majority from dominating parliament. Agree- 
ments have been made; there has been neither pas- 
sivity nor laxity. 
Reawakened memories 
The society’s collective memory is stronger than 
this, however. Whenever a debate arises about the 
political heritage of the military regime or someone 
tries to amend the constitution, memories are rea- 
wakened of prisoners who vanished, executions 
with or without trial and the torture inflicted on 
thousands of Chileans. There is no collective 
amnesia: the wickedness of the crimes has left an 
indelible mark. 
For nearly nine years, there was a tug-of-war bet- 
ween collective memory and political determination 
to forget. On the one hand, several legal actions were 
started against Pinochet and members of his regime. 
On the other, one could point to a certain sluggi- 
shness in the legal system, a veto by the armed 
forces, and the feeling that drawn-out legal pro- 
ceedings against Pinochet would not catch up with 
him and that he would die a natural death before 
coming to trial. This was the situation when he was 
arrested in London. 
Pinochet enjoys immunity because he has a 
diplomatic passport and is a senator for life, and 
the Chilean government has accepted this. The 
government maintains that it cannot accept foreign 
jurisdiction over him that it has neither recognized 
by treaty nor through ratification of an internatio- 
nal legal instrument. 
I approve of this approach because states are 
subject to international law even if it conflicts with 
my ideals. I also approve of it because I think the 
democratic transition is our business. I would like 
to see,in my lifetime,Chilean courts put Pinochet 
on trial for what he did and remove him from par- 
liament. I would like to see the armed forces quietly 
accept and respect court decisions and see the pro- 
Pinochet right accept the requirements of the rule 
of law and representative democracy. In sum, I 
would like to see judicial sovereignty in Chile fully 
deployed,as part of the rule of law in a strong and 
established democracy. 
Pinochet’s detention has moved the Chilean 
Justice system forward. Politicians have turned a 
spotlight on the crimes of the dictatorship, and 
public opinion is starting to accept that globaliza- 
tion doesn’t only involve trade. This is a process 
which is taking us towards a cosmopolitan society 
equipped with supra-national bodies based on 
freedom and the defence of human rights. [|

Pinochet dictatorship in Chile should not be 
punished because pouring salt into this open 
wound, establishing the truth and obtaining justice 
would destabilize democracy and endanger so- 
called social peace. 
But all efforts to stifle memory have failed. The 
arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London on October 
16, 1998 revealed how fragile the Chilean demo- 
cratic system is and showed the true face of a 
country which cannot face up to a period of its 
history which continues to divide Chileans into 
two irreconcilable camps. 
The systematic cover-up of the dictatorship’s 
crimes began on the day of the military coup d’état 
against President Salvador Allende in 1973. But 
S ome people have alleged that the crimes of the from the start of the repression, human rights orga- 
nizations and groups of victims’ families tried to find 
out the truth. They all worked together to build 
this collective memory of the past. After a while, the 
action of a band of mothers who denounced the 
crimes committed against their loved ones became 
the mainspring of the struggle to restore demo- 
cracy. The main theme of the campaign was “never 
again”—only the establishment of a nationwide 
culture of respect for human rights, a complete 
account of what went on and full rights to justice 
could ensure that history would not repeat itself. 
We were critical of the National Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission set up at the begin- 
ning of the transition process (see box). Why, we 
asked, did its brief only cover those who disap-

peared and leave aside those who were tortured, 
forced to flee abroad, arbitrarily arrested or sent into 
internal exile? 
Most of all, we objected to its decision not to 
name those responsible for the crimes, which would 
have at least been symbolic justice. And the truth 
that the Commission established was only the ver- 
sion presented by the victims, their families and 
human rights organizations, since the main cul- 
prits, the armed forces, refused to have anything to 
do with it. So it was only half the truth. A page of our 
history is still unwritten. 
International solidarity 
Yet through the Commission’s brief, the govern- 
ment recognized that the dictatorship had syste- 
matically violated human rights on a massive scale. 
This organized remembrance of the recent past 
was really an appeal for people to face the future bol- 
stered by a determination that such crimes must 
never happen again.

Britain ratified the international convention against torture. In May, the High Court

he can be extradited to Spain. If the general loses an appeal against this decision, 
the British home secretary will make the final decision on his extradition. [| 
the ethical, political, judicial and social dimensions 
of the problem, they reduced it to a search for the 
remains of those who disappeared, with the result 
that the nation’s ordeal was revived. 
Pinochet’s arrest means the country cannot avoid 
facing the events whose memory, however painful it 
may be, we have been fighting to keep alive.Indeed, 
over 40 complaints have been made against Pinochet 
before a judge which have so far led to the arrest and 
trial of a dozen military officers (see note page 25). 
The determination of the complainants, along 
with international solidarity, made possible an act 
of justice none of us had imagined: the imprison- 
ment of Pinochet in a gilded cage. As the former 
head of state, he is the chief perpetrator of what we 
regard as crimes against humanity committed under 
his rule inside and outside the country. T hese crimes 
should be tried by an international tribunal. Since 
such a tribunal is still not functioning, Pinochet 
ought to be tried in his own country. 
But Chile has neither adequate institutions nor the 
political will for that. So far there has been no real move 
to repeal the 1978 amnesty law or end the system of 
appointed senators. All this means that Chile is a par- 
tial and hesitant democracy, unable to guarantee a fair 
trial for Pinochet. Also, because he is a senator for life, 
his parliamentary immunity would have to be lifted 
before he could be tried. But since he is still a military 
officer, an examining magistrate could declare himself 
incompetent to handle the case and might send it to 
a military court, which obviously would not be inde- 
pendent enough. So Pinochet should be tried in 
Spain. T his would be a big step towards ending impu- 
nity, and an exemplary act against the treachery and 
tyranny of all dictatorships. 
Building a collective memory implies know- 
ledge of the past and all its consequences. As long 
as it is shrouded in the veil of pardon without jus- 
tice, we cannot plan a future of peace in a society 
reconciled with itself. [|

During the thaw years,between 1956 and 1964, 
Soviet society was confronted with its past for the 
first time when Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s 
crimes. But the denunciation only went part of the 
way, and a thoroughgoing reappraisal of Stalinism 
was not possible. From the mid-1960s on, all refe- 
rences to Stalin were censored. During the Brezhnev 
years, the dictator was quietly rehabilitated as the 
architect of the victory over Nazi Germany. 
But while the Soviet establishment officially 
tried to play down or make people forget about 
Stalinism, the most radical wing of the liberal 
intelligentsia, the dissidents, continued their scru- 
tiny of the Stalinist era. The high point of this 
struggle to remember came in 1974 with the 
publication in the West of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s 
The Gulag Archipelago. 
In the grip of 
a reading frenzy 
When perestroika allowed people to speak freely, 
from 1985 on, the first thing the intelligentsia did 
was to turn to the past and try to make sense of it. 
In 1986 and 1987, historical novels which had 
been written decades earlier and had either been 
unpublished in the Soviet Union or published only 
in the West turned the spotlight back onto Stalinism. 
Nearly 10 million copies were printed of the most 
popular of these novels, Anatoly Rybakov’s Children 
of the Arbat. All the key moments and events of the 
Stalinist era were now dealt with—the 1930s,col- 
lectivization, the Second World War and state-spon- 
sored anti-semitism. 
In 1988, Vassili Grossman’s great novel Life 
and Destiny, which had been published in the West 
in 1980, appeared in Russia, followed in 1990 by 
The Gulag Archipelago. The circulation of the maga- 
zine Novy Mirin which these works appeared rea- 
ched two million. The whole country was gripped 
with a reading frenzy. 
When the Soviet people discovered the scale 
of the disaster it came as a terrible shock. A sense of 
shared responsibility spread throughout the country. 
People wondered whether the whole society should 
repent,and there was a call for a Nuremberg-type 
trial of Stalinism. It was no longer just a matter of 
contrasting an evil Stalin with good communists and 
comrades of Lenin, as had been done during the 
1987 rehabilitation of the victims of the Stalinist 
show trials, but of asking what it was in Russian 
society that had made Stalinism possible. Essays and 
articles by historians took over from literature. 
Most authors belonging to the liberal intelligentsia 
looked for the causes in Russian history—in 
serfdom, the absence of a civil society and demo- 
cratic practices, and the huge size of the state sector. 
Essays and articles by historians took over where lite- 
rature left off. 
Waning interest 
in the past 
The duty of remembrance was performed by 
groups which painstakingly sought out the names of 
the victims, as the young historian DimitriYurasov 
did,or looked for mass graves. 
This movement led to the founding in 1987- 
1988 of a Moscow-based human rights associa- 
tion called Memorial, with member groups all over 
the Soviet Union. It drew a map of the labour 
camps,set up a museum and compiled lists of vic- 
tims. In 1989, the Leningrad newspaper Vecherny 
published day after day the names of people who had 
been shot. 
At first Memorial was a mass organization 
which planned to put up a monument to the vic- 
tims. But which victims?The victims of Stalinism 
or everyone who had been persecuted by the Soviet 
regime? From 1988 on, criticism was levelled not 
only at the Stalinist period but at the entire socia- 
list regime, and this encouraged the adoption of the 
second definition. 
But just as the monument project was being 
discussed,public opinion began to lose interest in 
the past. In 1996, the inauguration of a memorial 
called The Mask of Sorrow in the Kolyma region, 
where the most terrible labour camps had been, 
passed largely unnoticed. 
There seem to have been several reasons for 
this public loss of interest. First the economic 
disaster and its social consequences are leading 
Russians to give priority to the present. T hey are also 
making people question the very validity of the 
democratic project. Many Russians feel nostalgic for

Memory: making peace with a violent past 
  
the Soviet era and about a quarter of them hanker 
after what they call the most “glorious” era, when 
the USSR was feared and respected, during Stalin’s 
rule. 
The sense of national humiliation Russians have 
felt in the 1990s has weakened their desire to delve 
into the darkest years. Opinion polls show more and 
more people think there is too much talk about 
Stalinist crimes. For some Russians,as the French 
historian Maria Ferretti has shown, the desire to 
forget this period of the past has sprung from a 
rejection of the whole Soviet period as an unfortu- 
nate interlude in Russian history and from the glo- 
rification of pre-1917 Russia. Today’s Russia is 
coming to be seen as the direct heir of Tsarist 
Russia, passing over the black hole of socialist rule. 
So the Stalinist experience has now been erased. 
The dictator remains the least popular figure in 
Russian history—though those with favourable opi- 
nions of him rose from eight per cent in 1990 to 15 
per cent in 1997, while his disapproval rating fell 
from 48 per cent to 36 per cent in the same period. 
The proportion of the population which listed the 
mass repression of the 1930s among the main events 
of the 20th century fell from 38 per cent in 1989 to 
no more than 18 per cent in 1994. 
This new situation has not stopped investigations 
into Stalinism and its crimes, but it has greatly 
changed their nature.During perestroika, research 
was a joint effort and a central part of daily life, but 
now it is confined to professional scholars. Memo- 
rial has became mainly a research centre. Historians

wound I knew would never heal. I had survi- 
ved the terrible ordeal of the Khmer Rouge 
genocide, which killed a quarter of the country’s 
population. I didn’t understand how such a mas- 
sacre had been possible. Even now, I hardly do. 
As soon as [ reached the camp at Mairut, in Thai- 
land, I stopped fearing for my life, but I felt a pro- 
found sadness, whereas I should have been happy. I 
felt my whole life was already behind me, that it 
belonged to those years of struggle for survival. 
I wanted to forget. Go somewhere else, where 
I’d have no memory and no recollections, where 
nobody would know what I'd been through. I'd 
seen and heard my relatives suffer. Our family 
had been deported from Phnom Penh to Chrey, a 
village in the middle of nowhere. One of my sis- 
ters was brought back to my parents, physically 
and psychologically exhausted after building 
dikes and digging canals. Soon afterwards, my 
father died. He was a peasant’s son who had 
become a teacher and then a primary school ins- 
pector. He decided to stop eating.He chose to die 
as an act of rebellion, a last act of freedom. Then, 
one after another, my mother, my sisters and my 
nephews died of hunger or exhaustion. 
left Cambodia when I was 15 with a spiritual 
Survivor s guilt 
I didn’t want to talk about any of that. I had 
made it part of myself, and it became almost the 
mainspring of my survival. When I was living as an 
exile in France, there was a long period when I refu- 
sed to speak my native language and rejected any 
link with Cambodia. I had been uprooted and I felt 
somehow incomplete, torn between forgetting and 
remembering, between past and present, always ill 
at ease. | lived with memories of my relatives, with 
the anxiety—the certainty—that the same tragic 
story would repeat itself. It was burned into my 
flesh forever, as if with a branding iron, that this is 
what the world is like: a place where there’s a lot of 
indifference and hypocrisy and little compassion. 
When you come out of a war, you're not sure that 
you’ve left violence behind you. You are locked in a 
culture of survival. And when you’ve survived geno- 
cidel, you always feel guilty about being a survivor. 
1. The author use this word in its broader sense; contrast 
UN’s stricter definition, see page 20. 
When the Italian writer Primo Levi came back 
from the Nazi death camps, he said that “you feel 
others have died in your place, that we're alive 
because of a privilege we haven’t deserved,becau- 
se of an injustice done to the dead. It isn’t wrong 
to be alive, but we feel it is.” 
Long afterwards, I learned to speak again and 
to accept what had happened to me. Then I redis- 
covered my memories, my ability to imagine, to 
laugh, to dream, to rebuild my life. In Cambodia, 
they say people who've died a violent death can’t 
be reincarnated, that the souls of dead people who 
haven’t had a religious funeral and burial wander 
the earth forever, haunting the living. There are 
bones all over the place in the countryside. People 
find them whenever they start building. 
A machine to destroy memory 
If you can’t grieve, the violence continues. The 
Cambodian mother of a model family, well inte- 
grated in France, cut off her child’s head just as 
the Khmer Rouge killers had chopped off her 
father’s. Similar cases have occurred in 
Cambodia. At Preah Sihanouk Hospital in 
Phnom Penh, the only department that provides 
psychiatric treatment takes patients from all over 
the country. Sometimes there are 250 of them 
waiting in the corridor. You only have to see how 
many are depressive and destitute to realize that 
something must be done. There is a massive col- 
lective wound. 
The terrible thing about past wars and about 
the Cambodian genocide is not only the millions 
of dead, the widows, the orphans, the amputees 
and the depressed, it’s also our shattered identity, 
the ruins of our social cohesion. 
The first political decisions of the Khmer 
Rouge, after they won power on April 17, 1975, 
were unutterably violent. They emptied towns 
and hospitals, closed schools, abolished money, 
deported people en masse to the countryside, 
defrocked monks and looted old houses.2 
“Absolutely everything belongs to Angkar [the 
communist party],” they said. “If the party tells 
you to do something you must do it! Anyone who

two categories: the “old” people living in rural areas and 
the “new” people in the cities who were “tainted” by 
culture and knowledge.

objects is an enemy, anyone who opposes is a 
corpse.” People had to dress in black, change the 
way they spoke, use certain words and exclude 
others from their vocabulary. It was forbidden to 
sing, dance, say prayers and even talk to other 
people. My father, who had spent all his life 
trying to improve Cambodia’s public education 
system, was particularly worried about the deci- 
sion to ban teaching.“The spade is your pen, the 
rice-paddy is your paper,” was the message 
Angkar drove home. 
All social classes were affected to varying 
degrees by mass deportations to the countryside, 
forced labour, summary executions and famine. 
Paradoxically, all these absurd sacrifices were 
made in the name of restoring the glory of the 
Angkor era.All the roots of our culture and iden- 
tity, the basic social relationships and symbolic 
links which attached Cambodians to their world 
were methodically and deliberately attacked and 
destroyed. 
Most of the detention centres were set up in 
pagodas, places of prayer and compassion, or in 
schools, places of knowledge. Angkar was a 
machine for destroying identity and wiping out 
memory. 
Before they executed their victims, the killers 
tortured them and made them write hundreds of 
pages of false confessions dictated by Khmer 
Rouge officials. After being forced to denounce 
their families and friends, the prisoners were exe- 
cuted. “By eliminating you,” Angkar said, “we 
don’t lose anything. It’s better to wrongly arrest 
somebody than to wrongly let somebody go.” 
One of the executioners at Camp S-21, in 
Tuol Sleng—Pol Pot’s main torture centre— 
today only expresses his “regrets”; he doesn’t feel 
guilty. He destroyed non-persons, people the 
Khmer Rouge had stripped of all humanity. 
This genocide was “silent”. The Khmer 
Rouge imposed a reign of terror, and most execu- 
tions were carried out without witnesses and 
without noise.T he world let Cambodians die and 
didn’t seem to care. Not many people denounced 
the massacres. 
When I arrived in France in 1979, I was ama- 
zed to find that the Khmer Rouge still occupied 
Cambodia’s seat at the United Nations. A few 
years later, I took the absence of the word “geno- 
cide” from the Paris peace accords as a refusal to 
allow the survivors to remember, as an insult to 
the victims’ dignity.

Film director Rithy Panh in Cambodia in March 1999 
during the shooting of a documentary film about the 
installation of a trans-Cambodian optic fibre cable. 
Human bones were discovered when trenches for the 
cable were dug. 
I went back to Cambodia in 1990 after 11 years 
in exile. I wanted to find the survivors of my family 
and recover the remains of the dead and give them 
a proper burial, so their souls would stop wande- 
ring the earth and could be reincarnated in the cycle 
of life and death. I wanted at least to confirm they 
had died,so I could start to mourn properly. 
I went toTuol Sleng camp, which has been tur- 
ned into a “genocide museum”. I wanted to try to 
find a photo of my uncle among the hundreds of 
pictures of the dead pinned on the walls. But I 
couldn’t bring myself to go in.I went back in 1991 
to film the few survivors of the camp (only seven out 
of some 15,000 people who passed through it). I 
wanted to understand the banalization of evil and 
the dehumanizing machinery of the Khmer Rouge. 
But we're afraid of this recent past. Cambodians 
who dare to talk about it are divided. Some think we 
should forget and look to the future, that there’s no 
point in inflicting another ordeal on ourselves by trying 
to bring back memories and pick over old wounds. 
They fear that if trials are held they will revive serious 
political quarrels which might set off another civil war. 
Or else they generalize about Cambodians and say 
most of them are “fatalistic” and accept a history of 
war and genocide as their “karma”. 
This approach was dismissed by a 30-year-old 
peasant called Torng, who was typical of many 
people 1 spoke to while I was filming. “The 
Khmer Rouge didn’t just kill people,” he said. 
“They turned our generation into ignoramuses, 
animals, idiots, who don’t know where they're 
going. We didn’t study. All we know is how to use 
our physical strength. So we can only get jobs as 
32 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
peasants or labourers. The Khmer Rouge should 
be put on trial. If they aren’t, people like me will 
be tempted to take revenge.” 
I believe, and so do others, that we should face up 
to our history, so that our relatives and friends didn’t 
die in vain.M ourning won’t be possible unless moral 
and political responsibility for the Cambodian geno- 
cide is established. A trial of the Khmer Rouge, befo- 
re the Cambodian people, is absolutely essential. We 
have to give meaning to basic ideas of law and justi- 
ce in this country. In a democratic society, you can’t 
kill without being punished. 
We must give our memory a fair and dignified 
trial in order to understand the past. I'm not bothe- 
red about the sentences that would be handed down. 
Only the truth can free us—the whole truth,howe- 
ver horrific. T he other point of such a trial, which is 
just as important, would be to restore our identity. 
The Khmer Rouge have plunged generations of Cam- 
bodians into a vicious circle of cultural loss. 
Not many Cambodians tell their children about 
the genocide, which is a fuzzy corner of their 
memory. But we can’t build our future by forget- 
ting. T he survivors must tell their stories and ensure 
that the memory of what happened is handed down 
from the past to the present. We owe a debt to the 
dead and we have an obligation to our children. 
We shan’t be able to get rid of this 30-year 
culture of violence, cast out the monster that is 
fear and put behind us the collective guilt we feel 
as survivors unless we manage to understand our 
history. u

### 118294: Rwanda's collective amnesia

Rwandas collective amnesia 
Christianity tried to destroy the collective memory of Rwandans. 
After independence, ethnicity became the yardstick of identity and the Tutsis were 
demonized. Then came the horrors of genocide. 
Bringing the truth to 
light is already a 
start, as a victory for 
justice and a form of 
relief for the victims.

Le piege ethnique (Dagorno 
publishers, Paris, 1999) 
living dead. They are the hundreds of thousands 
of survivors of genocide who have psychological 
problems. In September 1994, I met one of them— 
a little girl called Elise, the only member of her 
family who had survived. She was just under five 
years old,the same age as the civil war in Rwanda, 
which went on from 1990 to 1994. 
Elise suffered from loss of memory and had a very 
low attention span. She could never remember my 
first name. She had no recollection of anything that 
had happened more than 20 minutes before—it was 
as if she was trying to protect herself. One evening I 
found a way of getting her to remember my name. 
She wore oversized pyjamas and I said, “Think of the 
word ‘pyjama’every time you see me—pyjama-Ben- 
jamin.” Whenever she saw me after that, she would 
happily shout: “Hey, wait, it’s pyjama-Benjamin!” 
Like that little girl clinging to an image,Rwan- 
dans should perhaps look for a common symbol 
which could unite them around their lost memory. 
For centuries,Rwandan civilization rested on a 
pyramidal power structure which was rooted in 
myths. It shaped the economy and conditioned 
social relations. It built (and still builds) a tyranny 
based on hierarchy, but a hierarchy imbued with a 
sense of restraint.In an atmosphere of self-censor- 
ship and silence, things are left unsaid—between 
parents and children, husbands and wives, shebujas 
(bosses) and their bagaragu (servants) and between 
Tutsis, with their sense of superiority, and Hutus, 
who feel inferior. 
n Kigali, they are known as bafuye bahagaze—the 
Severing links with the past 
But the establishment of Christianity, which 
began with the arrival of missionaries in 1900, des- 
troyed Rwanda’s collective memory. In 1931, the 
Church deposed Musinga, the Tutsis’ last divine-right 
monarch, when he refused to be converted.Conver- 
sion to Christianity would have undermined his legi- 
timacy and destroyed the meaning of the magical and 
religious functions of the monarchy, the pillar of 
Rwandan society. All the traditions which made up the 
country’s social and spiritual fabric were dubbed 
pagan rites and banned, despite the fact that they fos- 
tered social cohesion by bringing together the three 
ethnic groups—Hutus, Tutsis and Twas. 
The abolition of the A birus, the royal committee 
of wise men that was the official guardian of the 
society’s collective memory and its esoteric rites, 
marked the end of the only high-level institution 
that acted as a counterweight because it was made 
up mostly of Hutus. A proverb in the Kinyarwanda 
language was coined to describe this break with the 
esoteric past: Kerezia ya kuyeho kizira (the Church 
has forbidden the forbidden). 
After independence in 1962, the new republic of 
Rwanda tried to overturn the traditional pyramid- 
shaped power structure,destroyed even more of the 
traditional sense of national identity and wiped out 
the nation’s collective memory. The republic defined 
its identity by abolishing the old order, which it regar- 
ded as being too strongly marked by centuries of Tutsi 
monarchs, and by basing its legitimacy on the majo- 
rity ethnic group, the Hutus. 
Everything with a Tutsi connotation was ban- 
ned. Thousands of words rooted in Rwanda’s his- 
The country lived for 35 years in a 
state of growing amnesia, 
dominated by the law of silence,

tory and social organization were struck out of the 
language. The ethnicization of the state,supposedly 
to create a “social balance”, led to a quota system 
which limited the proportion of Tutsis in higher edu- 
cation and the civil service to nine per cent.It was 
based solely on numbers. People’s ethnic affiliation 
could be checked from their identity documents. 
The new rulers said they were redressing the social 
balance after centuries of feudal domination. 
In the vacuum left by the collapse of the tra- 
ditional collective memory, ethnicity became the 
only point of reference.This eventually led to the 
demonization of the Tutsis in order to justify their 
exclusion from society. The Tutsis were dehuma- 
nized and dubbed inyenzi (cockroaches), just as 
the Nazis had called German Jews “vermin”. 
Many terms of abuse were used to indicate they 
were unwanted parasites. It is easier to crush a 
cockroach underfoot than to kill a person. 
The “social revolution” which gave birth to the 
new Rwandan republic began in 1959 with a 
bloody revolt by the Hutus, involving the terrible 
massacre of 20,000 Tutsis and the flight of thou- 
sands of others into Burundi and Uganda. T his irre- 
parable act was the first step towards the descent 
into amnesia.But a past that is forgotten is bound 
to repeat itself because forgetting involves a refusal 
to admit wrongdoing. In Rwanda, amnesia led to »

» successive pogroms against the Tutsis which began 
in the 1960s and ended in the genocide. T he coun- 
try lived for 35 years in a state of growing amnesia, 
dominated by the law of silence, of the unspoken, of 
memories collectively repressed. Silence inevitably 
gave rise to impunity and impunity made amnesia 
acceptable. 
I had a hard job interviewing Tutsi survivors in 
1994 because the genocide divided Rwandans into 
two camps—Hutus and Tutsis,the perpetrators of 
genocide and the rest. In Rwanda today, you are 
forced to be on one side or the other; there is no 
halfway house. Just after the genocide, the Tutsis 
who returned were suspicious of Tutsis who had 
escaped, presuming they had collaborated with the 
enemy to save their skins. 
If you were a Hutu, you were automatically guilty 
of genocide, just as the Tutsis were from 1959 to 1994 
considered guilty just because they happened to be 
Tutsi. The genocide was a crime committed bet- 
ween neighbours;killers and survivors of the atroci- 
ties still live side by side today. T he extermination of 
a million people in 100 days with crude weapons like 
machetes,clubs,axes and hoes, could not have taken 
place without the participation of a massive number 
of people. A third of all Hutus are thought to have par- 
ticipated in one way or another. 
Fear of reprisals 
About 135,000 people suspected of involvement 
in genocide are languishing in overcrowded jails, and 
the legal system, which was destroyed in the pro- 
vinces, is finding it hard to get the trials underway. T he 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (the 
Arusha Tribunal), which has scant resources, is not get- 
ting very far either. All this is keeping Rwandans from 
the task of remembering their past, especially since 
state-endorsed ethnic attitudes still condition the 
Hutu killers to think they killed their historic neigh- 
bours to ensure the survival of their own ethnic group. 
Today, the guilty flatly deny there was any genocide. 
So in one of Africa’s most densely populated 
countries, the survivors see their tormentors returning 
to live peacefully on the hillsides because there is not 
enough evidence to bring charges against them. In the 
first months after the genocide witnesses spoke freely, 
but they have become tight-lipped since a number of 
survivors have been murdered by unknown killers. 
“What’s the use of giving evidence?’ one victim 
asked me. “They’re not being punished anyway.” 
All Rwandans live in an atmosphere of ethnic mis- 
trust. Fear of reprisals is still rife. 
The new Rwandan authorities may want to curb 
individual score-settling and encourage national 
reconciliation, but the ragtag soldiers who carried out 
the 1994 massacres are still lurking in the forests of 
neighbouring Congo and have not given up their 
plans to exterminate the Tutsis. As long as the threat 
of a new genocide hangs over Rwanda, the present 
regime’s priority will be to defend national frontiers, 
as shown by the on-going war in Congo. 
The present is still barring the way to memory.

Timeline 
1959: Hutus carry out a “social revolution”, killing members of Rwanda’s Tutsi mino- 
rity and overthrowing the Tutsi monarchy. Many Tutsis flee the country. Formerly 
German colonies, Rwanda and Burundi have been administered by Belgium since 1924. 
1962: Rwanda gains independence. Massacres of Tutsis increase and an ethnic 
Hutu regime is gradually established in Kigali. 
1990: The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Tutsi-dominated organization, launches 
an offensive against the regime of General Juvenal Habyarimana, in power since 1973. 
In October, intervention by Zaire, Belgium and France. French troops remain in the 
country. 
1993: An accord signed in August at Arusha (Tanzania) provides for power-sharing 
with the RPF. It is stalled by President Habyarimana and his political allies. The UN 
sends in an international peace-keeping force, UNAMIR. 
1994: President Habyarimana is assassinated, setting off a wave of killings aimed at 
Tutsis and moderate Hutus. UNAMIR withdraws. Three months later, the French 
establish a “protection zone” in the southwest. The RPF forms a government of 
national union. In November, the UN creates an International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda, which sits at Arusha. 
According to the Red Cross, the victims of genocide number more than a million 
dead, mostly Tutsis, and over two million refugees. 
1999: The RPF government extends its term of office by four years, promising elec- 
tions and a new constitution. [|

Bosnia and Herzegovina: 
an impossible reconciliation?

A once ethnically diverse population lives in a climate of fear and distrust 
fuelled by nationalists 
  
D Director of the International 
Crisis Group (ICG) project in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. This 
private, multinational 
organization, which aims to 
strengthen the capacity of the 
international community to 
understand and respond to 
crises, produces analytical 
reports targeted at key 
decision-makers. 
(http://www.crisisweb.org) 
Timeline 
the Dayton Peace Accords, a document designed 
to create a new unified state comprised of two multi- 
ethnic entities. It would have a functioning central 
government, hold democratic elections and adhere to 
international human rights standards. Displaced per- 
sons were to be allowed to return to their homes and 
indicted war criminals were to be arrested and turned 
over to the International Tribunal of The Hague. 
Today's reality is dramatically different. The coun- 
try consists of three de facto mono-ethnic entities, three 
separate armies, three separate police forces, and a 
national government that exists mostly on paper. Most 
indicted war criminals remain at large. Nationalist poli- 
tical parties, including many of the ethnic cleansers 
who were responsible for the war in the first place, 
remain securely in power. Nationalist extremists— 
often backed by the ruling political parties—still bomb 
and torch the homes of returning refugees in certain 
areas. 
Contrary to the pronouncements of local nationa- 
list politicians or international officials wishing to avoid 
taking responsibility, the Serbs, Croats and Muslims 
lived together relatively peacefully in Bosnia and Her- 
zegovina for hundreds of years. All three groups res- 
pected each others’religious customs and holidays and 
intermarriage was common. But something changed 
when all sides committed grievous atrocities during 
the war. These crimes were not an accidental by-pro- 
n November 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina signed 
1991: Slovenia and Croatia, two of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation, 
declare their independence. 
1992: In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Croat and Muslim communities press for the 
independence of their republic. They are opposed by Bosnian Serbs who lay siege to 
Sarajevo and seize 70% of the country. Massive “ethnic cleansing” begins, mostly 
conducted by Bosnian Serb forces. 
1993-1994: After the rejection of a peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs, the UN declares 
six “safe areas”, but ground hostilities persist. Formerly allies, Croats and Muslims 
clash before signing an accord in March 1994. The UN Security Council creates an 
International War Crimes Tribunal for former Yugoslavia based at The Hague (Nether- 
lands). NATO goes into action against the Serbs. 
1995: In July, Bosnian Serbs take over Srebrenica and Zepa “safe areas”. In August, 
NATO bombs their positions around Sarajevo. The Dayton (USA) peace agreement in 
November ends hostilities. The republic is divided into two associated entities, the 
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (51% of the land area, including Sarajevo) 
and the Serb Republic. A NATO force monitors application. 
In this conflict some 200,000 people were killed and almost 200,000 were dis- 
placed. Around 600,000 refugees have returned to their homes. [| 
duct of the war. Rather, they were a tool to achieve its 
primary aim: ethnic separatism or domination of one 
ethnic group over another. By the war’s end in early 
1996, all three sides had retreated into ethnically pure 
areas, controlled by their respective armies. 
Today, the Croat and Serb politicians insist on 
remaining separate. In fact, it is those very groups res- 
ponsible for the worst crimes who insist most vehe- 
mently on ethnic separation. The lack of consensus 
on a multiethnic society plays into the hands of M us- 
lim extremists, who also practice a more subtle policy 
of ethnic exclusion. All three groups have formed their 
own school curricula, which reinforce ethnic hatred, 
blame the other groups, and glorify their own mytho- 
logy. Each has begun religious instruction in the 
schools, which often takes the most primitive form of 
ethnic indoctrination. All this only serves to cement 
the wartime ethnic cleansing. 
The sad truth is that four years after Dayton (see 
box), neither side is any closer to reconciliation than 
in late 1995. Many Bosnians of all nationalities will 
state openly that they can stop hating, but that they 
will neither forgive nor forget what happened during 
the war. And many add that they wish to be left alone 
with their own ethnic group. After what the other 
groups did to them, they no longer wish to live with 
them anyway. In a political climate that works against 
the emergence of any reliable non-nationalist refe- 
rence point, members of all communities still fear first 
and foremost for the survival of their ethnic identity 
and place group interests above all else. 
Rather than work toward calming nationalist pas- 
sions and anger, local politicians use these fears to fur- 
ther their own political agendas. This is seen particu- 
larly in the cases of the Serb and Croat populations, 
both of whom look toward a mother country outside 
the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and dream of 
eventually seceding and uniting their region with it. 
From Belgrade and Zagreb, politicians continue to fan 
the flames of nationalist desire. T he continued insis- 
tence of nationalist parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
urged on by nationalists outside, on creating ethni-cally 
pure territories stands as the greatest obstacle to recon- 
ciliation. Until the outside forces live up to their obli- 
gations under Dayton and stop pushing for “greater” 
national programmes, little progress will be made in 
the reconciliation of the country’s pre-war ethnically 
diverse population. And until that time, its citizens will 
live in an environment of fear of the other ethnic groups.

### 118296: Can we prevent crimes against humanity?

an we prevent crimes 
against humanity? 
Canadian judge Louise Arbour, former chief prosecutor with the 
International Criminal Tribunals (ICT) for ex- Yugoslavia and Rwanda, 
believes international law is making great strides in violence prevention 
How has setting up ICTs helped the groups of 
people directly concerned to turn the page on 
atrocities they have experienced? 
These tribunals have been a spectacular innovation. 
For the first time, the international community has 
shown its concern not only with the short term— 
stopping armed conflict—but also with the long 
term. It has noted that in the Balkans and Africa’s 
Great Lakes region there was very little hope of 
achieving lasting peace based on reconciliation and 
social reconstruction unless the truth about past 
events was established. The recording by interna- 
tional investigators of irrefutable evidence of crimes 
prevents history from being falsified and the past 
from being distorted. 
When the truth is told, the need to dispense jus- 
tice becomes obvious. It’s very important to pin cri- 
minal responsibility for any crimes that have been 
committed not only on those who actually committed 
them but also on political and military leaders. In so 
doing, the law at least recognizes that the victims 
have a legal status and to some extent restores their 
dignity. It also stops them from setting themselves on 
a course for revenge, an agenda which can be handed 
down from generation to generation. 
Do you feel the ICTfor the former Yugoslavia 
has helped victims to come to terms with the 
burden of memory, a process which is crucial to 
reconciliation? In Bosnia, there s a kind of 
apartheid between communities. 
The ICT has not yet contributed to reconciliation 
in Bosnia because it has not been given the neces- 
sary resources. Justice cannot be fully done part- 
ly because of the refusal of some governments to 
gather evidence and arrest people who've already 
been indicted. 
The existence of an ICTfor the former 
Yugoslavia doesn t seem to have prevented the 
events in Kosovo. 
The ICT did not have an immediate deterrent 
effect because the UN Security Council didn’t use 
its resources to oblige Serbia (the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia) to carry out the arrest warrants the 
ICT had issued.This encouraged the criminals to 
feel that in practical terms they were going to enjoy 
impunity and immunity. Throughout the Kosovo 
conflict, from January to June 1999, I repeatedly 
urged the international forces there to arrest people 
36 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
under indictment. I think this was the right deter- 
rent message to send to the parties in Kosovo. 
It’s clear that those who committed crimes in 
Kosovo were more aware of the risk of being 
indicted and that this influenced their methods. 
The common graves in Kosovo dug up by ICT 
investigators have provided a lot of evidence, cer- 
tainly enough to make the authors of these crimes 
realize that the law can always find such evidence, 
whatever lengths the criminals may go to in order 
to cover up their crimes. 
How has the ICT helped to promote reconcilia- 
tion in Rwanda, where people are afraid of the 
massacres starting again? 
Military leaders, people accused of very serious 
responsibilities for the genocide, ministers and even 
the former prime minister (who has confessed his 
guilt) are awaiting trial in prison in Arusha, in Tan- 
zania. They are no longer in a position to fan the 
flames of tension, so the risk of violence has been to 
some extent reduced. In Rwanda,even more than 
in Bosnia, the culture of impunity has existed for 
decades. Violence goes in cycles, but responsibility 
for it has not been proven.The ICT represents a 
change of direction in this respect but it won’t have 
an immediate impact. 
What can we expect from the proposed 
International Criminal Court (ICC), which will 
be the first permanent institution of its kind? 
Setting up the ICC is a huge and irreversible step 
for the world.When it’s up and running it will be 
able to respond fairly quickly to events and to indict 
suspected criminals before they can commit further 
massacres. ICTs were set up after crimes were com- 
mitted in Bosnia, Croatia and Rwanda. But in 
Kosovo, indictments were made at the highest level 
at the beginning of June 1999 for crimes com- 
mitted between January and May. Such speed was 
possible because the ICT and its infrastructure 
were already in place. 
So an ICC, if it has the necessary muscle, will be 
able to act and intervene in real time, which is an enor- 
mous step forward. If there’s the political will to arrest 
people who’ve been indicted, effective prevention of 
crimes against humanity can be envisaged. |

### 118297: Police against racism

POLICE AGAINST RACISM 
  
D Asbel Lopez 
Training schemes in several European countries are getting to grips with the stereotyping and 
prejudice that all too often influence police behaviour 
In a vast salon in Monceau Castle 
(Belgium), 13 policemen from 
Charleroi,a town in the centre of the 
country, have been divided into teams 
and are absorbed in a boisterous card 
game. The officers, unarmed and wearing 
civilian clothes, are all men in their for- 
ties. Today, in early October, they are 
taking part in the fourth session of a 
workshop against racism and xenophobia 
run by the Centre for Equal Opportunity 
and the Fight Against Racism, a Brussels- 
based public institution founded in 1993. 
Laughter erupts from the policemen 
and the Centre’s two instructors when the 
winners of each game go on to the next 
round of the contest. This time they will be 
playing a game according to rules none of 
them will know. 
A game with unknown rules 
Jean,who has spent half his 42 years in 
the police force, says this is what happens to 
immigrants when “they arrive in a country 
without knowing the rules and when the 
rules they have back home are no use 
because they don’t work in the new society.” 
For example,he says, rules for women 
in Islamic countries are very different from 
those in the West.Later on, during a review 
of the session, Jean says he has never had the 
chance to talk about such things or discuss 
the relationship he has with immigrants in 
the course of his work. 
The workshop is one of 11 projects that 
nine European countries are carrying out 
under an international programme called 
NGOs and Police Against Prejudice 
(NAPAP), set up by the European Com- 
mission in 1997 to fight racism and xeno- 
phobia through workshops for members of 
the police. 
Each country has its own priorities and 
methods. As part of the British project 
members of minority ethnic groups are 
invited to take part in the training courses.

The Catalans hold day courses for their 
police run by local immigrant groups. 
France stresses the social integration of 
immigrants. In Germany emphasis is laid on 
making police more aware of the problems 
that arise in a multicultural society. 
In recent years racism and xenophobia 
have increased in many European coun- 
tries, especially because of economic crisis, 
unemployment, a rise in the immigrant 
population and anti-foreigner propaganda 
by extreme right-wing parties who are get- 
ting more and more votes'. In this situation, 
police forces are in a particularly exposed 
position. 
The Centre, which records and pur- 
sues cases of racist behaviour, says that in 
Belgium more complaints about discrimi- 
nation based on the origin of an individual 
are laid against the police than against any 
other group. T he situation is also troubling 
1.The recent electoral successes of the extreme 
right in Austria and Switzerland illustrate this 
process.

in other European countries. In Britain, a 
report by a former High Court judge, Sir 
William Macpherson, said in early 1999 
that there was “institutionalized racism” in 
London’s Metropolitan police force. In 
Germany, an official survey showed that 
police violence against foreigners was “not 
just a matter of isolated cases”. Amnesty 
International’s 1999 report detailed abuses 
by the police in France, Spain, Greece and 
Switzerland against immigrants and mem- 
bers of ethnic minorities. 
In a democratic system, such things 
should not happen and the police should 
respect the principle of equal rights for all 
citizens. To ensure such respect, the first 
thing to be done is to see that stereotyping 
and prejudice do not affect the professional 
behaviour of the police. This is not easy 
because police opinions and attitudes are 
developed at first hand in the front line of 
social conflict, and are usually the result of 
an accumulation of personal experiences, 
frustrations and misunderstandings. 
The workshops run by the Belgian 
centre are special because they feature group 
work drawing on personal experience and 
incidents the policemen agree to talk about. »

ETHICS 
The starting point of the six-day course is 
not a lecture on tolerance or study of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but 
contributions from the policemen during 
activities including card games, role- 
playing, and looking at photos and film 
extracts. 
Marisa Fella, an instructor at the 
Centre, says these “apparently simple” 
exercises encourage serious reflection by the 
policemen about their professional beha- 
viour. She remembers one occasion when 
solving a puzzle opened up the subject of 
communication and aggressivity and even- 
tually turned into a debate about police 
brutality. “T hey discussed their own violent 
behaviour as policemen, when and why 
they had been violent or not violent, and 
how they dealt with violence by officers 
under their orders.” A “forum for talking 
and thinking” was opened and allowed 
them to distance themselves from their 
jobs, something which can be hard to do 
when you are in the thick of things. 
A forum for talking and thinking 
Bit by bit,as confidence is built up, the 
participants stop using official jargon and 
begin to recognize nuances. For example, 
when one policeman said he could not 
accept the position of women in Islam, this 
was already a step forward, because he was 
beginning to distinguish between whole- 
sale rejection of Muslims and his disap- 
proval of one aspect of their culture. 
Fella says the most heartening aspect of 
her work is to see that “behind the uni- 
forms there are human beings who ask 
themselves questions about their profes- 
sion and about how they do their jobs.” 
Just speaking freely and openly about these 
issues is already a big step, she says,because 
“putting things into words and talking about 
them allows you to be more objective about 
them, to realize their seriousness and impor- 
tance and to start thinking about them.” 
This was not happening when she 
started the Centre’s workshops six years 
ago. At that time, training focused on the 
immigrant, not the police. The aim was to 
‘Behind the uniforms 
there are human beings 
who ask themselves 
questions about their 
profession and 
about how they do 
their jobs’ 
throw light on the culture of immigrants’ 
countries of origin, how they had come to 
Belgium,population statistics and the signi- 
ficance of religious festivals like Ramadan or 
practices like wearing the chador, the shawl 
or veil worn by Muslim women. 
But the Centre’s officials soon noticed 
that this kind of information session not 
only failed to make the police aware of cul- 
tural diversity but was even counter-pro- 
ductive. The policemen got the impression 
that by explaining how immigrants lived, the 
instructors were trying to justify behaviour 
that to them was unacceptable. They felt 
they were being made fun of and this gene- 
rated great hostility towards the course 
organizers. 
Their comments were brutal. “The ins- 
Sensitive issues are discussed in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. 
- 
38 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
 
tructors think we’re ignorant and therefore 
racist. .. . They give us nice little talks about 
immigrants, as if theyre all nice and 
friendly, but they’ve never patrolled the 
streets like we have.” 
These days, such resistance has disap- 
peared or at least has subsided. The door to 
change has opened. But problems still exist. 
The police say they do not know exactly 
how to put into practice what they have 
learned in the workshops about conflict 
management, non-verbal communication 
and handling aggression when they are back 
doing their job, which nearly always involves 
speed, stress and confusion. 
Another big problem is the programme’s 
lack of resources. The Centre has just five 
instructors, three of them full-time. Only 
about 300 of Belgium's 36,200 police and 
gendarmes attended workshops like these 
between 1994 and 1998. A medium-term 
proposal to overcome this is to have the 
current instructors train new ones. 
Another weak point is that it’s senior 
officers who ask for courses to be held for 
their men, who are not necessarily stationed 
in places where the incidence of racial dis- 
crimination is high. What’s more, the entire 
staff of a police station rarely attends the 
course, and this causes friction when they 
go back to work. 
But despite everything, those who take 
part agree that the process of exchange and 
discussion between instructors and police is 
encouraging. 
Long-term effects 
One instructor tells a group that five 
volunteers are needed for a role-playing 
game in which three policemen will play the 
part of young immigrants and two others 
will be the police. The first volunteers are 
those who want to play the immigrants. 
When the two policemen pass the group 
of “immigrants”, the policeman playing the 
part of Fabio, an 18-year-old Belgian citizen 
of Mediterranean origin, calls them “poulets” 
(chickens) a French slang word meaning 
“cops”. The two policemen immediately 
turn round to arrest the youths, while their 
friends laugh at a nickname that, as police, 
they have all been called at one time or 
another. 
When this episode is discussed after- 
wards, some of the policemen say they 
would have just kept on walking and not 
arrested anyone for “such a trivial matter”. 
Another notes that a few years ago, the 
youths would have had their ears boxed. 
The instructor uses the episode to show 
how the idea of what constitutes an insult 
can change over the years, pointing out that 
this is not just a subjective matter and that

the students gradually come to see the 
connection between what they learn in the 
classroom and real-life situations. 
Before continuing, one of the instructors 
explains to the police that they were called 
“chickens” because Paris police headquar- 
ters is built on the site of an old chicken 
farm.“Really?”’ murmurs one of them who 
had no idea of this, while his colleagues 
laugh. 
Francois Delor, a psychiatrist and ins- 
tructor at the Centre, thinks this reaction is 
important from a methodological stand- 
point.“Laughter,” he says, “is a way of avoi- 
ding confrontation. Laughing together is 
sharing a kind of intimacy and that makes 
it possible to work together in a climate of 
trust.” 
The instructor’s job is to monitor eve- 
rything that is said and done during the 
sessions and also to spot certain expres- 
sions, put them in a broader context and use 
that to break down prejudices. 
Fred,who has spent 17 of his 40 years 
as a policeman, tells how he was once given 
what he thought was a “stupid” order to 
arrest all the Gypsies in the market in Char- 
leroi. But a colleague supported the order, 
saying that “regular checks, especially of 
Gypsies, will curb crime.” Fred retorted 
that “my job isn’t to arrest Gypsies just 
because they're Gypsies” and said it would 
be better to deploy plainclothes police 
who could catch thieves red-handed, whe- 
ther they were foreigners or Belgians. 
Fred’s story about the clearly xenophobic 
aspect of an order is more effective in 
combating racist attitudes than any speech 
because it does not come from one of the 
instructors but from a fellow policeman. 
Amid jokes and friendly chat in a convi- 
vial atmosphere,sensitive and serious sub- 
jects are raised quite easily. But how can we 
be sure these policemen will incorporate 
‘Laughter is a way of avoiding 
confrontation. Laughing 
together is sharing a kind of 
intimacy which makes it 
possible to work together in a 
climate of trust’ 
into their professional lives some of the 
things they have seen and heard in these 
workshops and behave more fairly towards 
immigrants in general? 
Delor is firmly convinced that exchanges 
like these have positive effects which may 
some day influence the minds of these men 
and change the way they act. “Words and 
exchanges which seem unimportant some- 
times have surprising effects in the long 
term.” He adds that people tend to absorb 
as a “potential cognitive resource” scattered 
elements whose utility may not be obvious 
at the time. 
This seems to be confirmed by Christian 
Raes, an assistant police commissioner in 
Brussels. In an interview in the Belgian 
daily newspaper Le Matin in July 1999, he 
said that during the training at the Centre 
“bonds were forged between members of 
the group and something of that has 
remained. I haven’t changed dramatically, 
but sometimes I look at things in a different 
way and also try to spend a bit more time lis- 
tening to my men.” 
The Centre’s workshops are undoubtedly 
helping the fight against racism and xeno- 
phobia. But changing behaviour patterns that 
are deeply rooted in a society is a long-haul 
Job whch depends, as ever, on the enthusiasm 
and determination of everyone. |

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 


### 118298: The Year 2000: who's coming to the party?

THE YEAR 2000: WHO'S 
COMING TO THE PARTY? 
  
D Jasmina Sopova 
From Osaka to San Francisco, from Beijing to Moscow and Pretoria, millennium fever seems to 
have gripped most—but not all—ef the planet 
world will enter the year 2000. For 
months, sometimes years, plans have 
been made to celebrate this special New 
Year’s Eve, especially in the Christian 
world.But what,if anything, does the date 
mean to non-Christians? 
“December 31 may herald a new year, 
a new century and a new millennium, but 
for me it’ll just be a normal day,” says an 
amused P. Balasubramanian, the chief 
accountant of a large firm in the Indian city 
of Madras. 
For a large part of humanity, the arrival 
of the year 2000 will pass completely unno- 
ticed. But because globalization means fol- 
lowing trends or simply because there is 
money to be made, many people have yielded 
to the temptation to join the festivities. 
At midnight on December 31, the 
Marketing 
the millennium 
In India, advertising razzmatazz orches- 
trated by millennium marketeers has rea- 
ched most of the population, thanks to 
satellite television. New Delhi is staging a 
“Millennium Night Celebration”. Railway 
stationmasters will blow their whistles to 
send trains off on prestigious trips around 
the sub-continent. In most of India’s major 
tourist centres,from Agra, Khajuraho and 
Jaipur,all the hotels are booked up. Yet for 
many Indians, mostly Hindus, there is 
really little to get worked up about. 
According to the Vikram Samvat, the 
calendar of the Hindus and Sikhs of nor- 
thern and western India, we are already in 
the year 2055, while the Shaka, the coun- 
try’s most widely used Hindu calendar, 
only clocks up 1920. As Indian Catholics 
mark the end of 1999, Buddhists will be 
enjoying the year 2542 and Muslims the 
year 1420 of the Hegira.A hundred years 
ago, according to another ancient Hindu 
calendar, the sixth millennium of the 
Kaliyuga era began, supposedly the worl- 
d’s last (see box). 
D Unesco Courier journalist 
40 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
When all’s said and done, only the weal- 
thiest and most westernized Indians really 
feel concerned by the millennium celebra- 
tions. “It’s a legacy of colonial times and a 
product of marketing,” says Bhupinder 
Singh, a practising Sikh who has retired 
from the higher civil service and become a 
businessman. But he admits he has gone 
along with it all. He is promoting Pakistan’s 
most famous classical singer, Shafqat Ali 
Khan, in India with the slogan “T he Star of 
the Millennium”. 
Another “star” is the island of Katchall, 
one of the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of 
Bengal, which will be the first place in India 
to see the sunrise on New Year’s Day 2000. 
CALENDARS 
FOR ALL: 
We are in the year: 
® 11 of the Heisei era, which corresponds to the 
reign of Japanese Emperor Akihito. 
® 1420 of the Hegira, the Muslim era, which 
begins on the day when the prophet Muhammad 
left Mecca and went to Medina. 
® 1999 of the Gregorian calendar. Used all over 
the world, it is named after Pope Gregory XI, 
who reformed the Jllian calendar in 1582. The 
Julian calendar was itself a reform of the Roman 
calendar (starting from the date of the foundation 
of Rome) instituted by Julius Caesar. The Julian 
calendar began to be observed by Chrigtiansin the 
year 532, when the Church fixed the start of the 
Christian era asthe presumed day of Christ's birth. 
® 5100 of the Kaliyuga era, the “age of 
conflicts”. According to Brahman cosmogony this 
is the last cosmic phase of human history. It is 
considered to have begun in 3102 B.C. at the 
end of the Great War which is the main topic of 
the Mahabharata epic. The era is supposed to 
end in the year 428,999. 
® 5543 of the Buddhist era, which commemo- 
rates the death of Buddha. 
® 5760 of the Jewish calendar, which is based 
on the Babylonian calendar, that starts from the 
supposed date of the creation of the world. WH 
 
    
The ministry of culture is cashing in on the 
event (as well as making up for India’s lack 
of infrastructure) by inviting seven luxury 
ships from all over the world to anchor off 
the Nicobar Islands for the big moment. 
Other ships are being encouraged to 
go to Tonga, in the middle of the Pacific 
near the international dateline. To attract 
them, Tongan King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV 
has decreed a switch to summer daylight 
saving time on October 3, thereby gaining 
14 hours over Greenwich Mean Time 
(GMT) and making the archipelago the 
first place on earth to enter the “third mil- 
lennium”. This kind of thing has been 
done in the past. When Pope Gregory 
XIII shortened the year 1582 by 10 days 
as part of his reform of the Julian calen- 
dar, it meant that St Teresa of Avila died 
during the night of the 4th to the ... 15th 
of October. 
Weddings and marathons 
The U.S. Marine Observatory in Thai- 
land has put forward the controversial theory 
that the sun will rise at 7 a.m. on January 1 
above the frontier between Myanmar 
(Burma) and Thailand and that this will be 
“the best place in the world to see in the mil- 
lennium.” But while the Thais have a front 
seat for the big show, they may be giving it a 
miss. Like Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and 
Sri Lanka, Thailand is a country where T he- 
ravada Buddhism is practised; it celebrated 
its third millennium 543 years ago. What's 
more, Thailand marks the new year in mid- 
April, during Songkran, the water festival. 
All the same, some attempts are being 
made to stir up enthusiasm for the year 
2000.The Tourism Authority of Thailand 
(TAT) is organizing events with a “new mil- 
lennium” tag—millennium weddings for 
2,000 couples, a millennium marathon and 
a big seaside concert. But in Southeast 
Asia, which is struggling to recover from a 
two-year economic crisis, the “new millen- 
nium”is on the whole generating little real 
interest or extravagant projects. TAT says 
there has been a 30 per cent increase in

hotel reservations for December compared 
with December 1998, but nearly all of them 
have been by foreigners. 
Japan has followed the Western calendar 
since 1873, as part of the modernization 
process it embarked on during the Meiji 
Era. Until then, the country had used the 
lunar-solar Taiintaiyoreki calendar dating 
from the Nara Era (645-794), Japanese 
civilization’s golden age. For nearly a cen- 
tury, though, the Japanese, especially those 
living in the countryside, went on celebra- 
ting the “old”New Year as well as the new 
one. And since tradition demands that time 
is measured again from zero whenever a 
new emperor comes to the throne, the Japa- 
nese followed three different calendars at 
the same time. 
These days the Taiintaiyoreki is only 
observed by a few sentimental folk and 
New Year is celebrated on December 31. 
But though calendars come and go, tradi- 
tions remain. And so the Japanese will be 
marking the New Year as their ancestors 
did, with ancient games and decorations, 
formal clothes and special “lucky” food 
dishes. 
One well-known restaurateur has 
announced grandly he will make a Tale of 
Genji meal, referring to a famous 1,000- 
year-old classic novel. On the menu will be 
35 dishes for four gourmets. All for a mere 
$8,000. More accessible will be the wildly 
popular television programme Kohaku Uta 
Gassen, a contest between the year’s best 
male and female singers,which most Japa- 
nese watch every December 3 1—especially 
this year when the Y2K computer bug will 
encourage people to stay at home. 
To the west of the Land of the Rising 
Sun, the new Gregorian year will be greeted 
with typical panache in China.Beijing city 
council has gone to great expense, helped 
by generous donors in Hong Kong, to build 
a “Chinese Altar of the Century”. T he buil- 
ding complex, which includes several exhi- 
bition halls,has cost some $24 million and 
mobilized some 200 architects and art his- 
torians. The rotating altar, 47 metres across, 
has a huge stage which can accommodate 
more than a thousand singers and dancers. 
You enter it through a 300-metre-long 
“Tunnel of Time”, decorated inside with 
bronze reliefs showing scenes from the 
country’s 5,000-year history. 
But the older generation prefer to wait 
until February to celebrate the start of the 
Year of the Dragon, and remote provinces 
will mostly ignore the fuss about the third 
millennium. Young people however can’t 
wait for New Year’s Eve, and brush aside 
the rebukes of the ardent defenders of the 
Chinese calendar who publicly oppose this 
“biblical” anniversary, as well as the insis- 
tence of astronomers, who have taken the 
matter seriously and are trying to explain 
that the new millennium will not in fact 
arrive until a year later.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
In Shanghai, a young couple watch the Bell of the Century. 
the year 1, a new century does not strictly 
begin until the year 101, and so on until 
2001. The Gregorian calendar in its pre- 
sent form has only existed for 418 years, 
and it isreally 2,044 years old when seen as 
a direct descendant of the Julian calendar. 
What’s more, Christ was actually born a 
few years before the official Christian date 
of his birth. So perhaps it’s not surprising 
that young Confucians, Buddhists, Taoists, 
Muslims, Christians and atheists have 
concluded that the year 2000 just repre- 
sents a worldwide desire to enter the new 
millennium as quickly as possible—cele- 
brating and making money at the same 
time—and are keen to take part. 
The same enthusiasm can be found in 
the Jordan valley. On the Israeli side there 1s 
“Nazareth 2000” and on the Palestinian side 
“Bethlehem 2000”. Luckily the share-out of 
the holy places 1s fair to the two peoples 
which, despite the small number of Chris- 
tians among them, are doing up these sites, 
which date back to the dawn of Christianity. 
In a region with so many celebrations, 
there are countless welcoming banners. After 
celebrations to mark the 3,000th anniver- 
sary of Jerusalem and 50 years of Israeli his- 
tory have been played down because of the 
stalled peace process, Israel’s Lod mterna- 
tional airport is building an extension cal- 
led “Ben Gurion 2000” (after the country’s 
first prime minister) to welcome the pilgrims

who, between this Christmas and Easter 
2001, will climb the Via Dolorosa which 
symbolizes the life of Christ. 
Will there be six million of them,as the 
Vatican predicts, or three to four million as 
Israel has provided for, or the 2.5 million 
foreseen by the pessimists, who are prepa- 
ring for only a 20 per cent increase in tou- 
rist numbers? 
Storm in a wine-glass? 
For Bethlehem, the year 2000 1s an eco- 
nomically important one.Experts forecast 
that the influx of tourists will boost the 
income of the Palestinian population by 
$100 per capita during the year. The World 
Bank has asked donor countries to beat the 
Three Wise Men to it in Bethlehem, by pro- 
viding $85 million to do up the town.The 
private sector has also come up with funds 
to build 6,000 extra hotel rooms. 
But the millennium has also produced 
some inappropriate tidings. A world away 
from the rosaries, the merchants of the 
Temple have had the ultimate bad taste to 
offer a “Jerusalem 2000” Cabernet wine. 
Its label shows the Dome of the Rock, 
Islam’s third most holy place (after Mecca 
and Medina) despite the fact that Islam 
prohibits consumption of alcohol. A storm 
in a wine-glass? The matter has been taken 
up with the Arab League. 
In the Arab world, Egypt has decided 
to be the champion celebrant of the mil- 
lennium, and 1s avoiding any religious over- 
tones. T he occasion coincides with the start 
of ancient Egypt’s seventh millennium, so 
the celebrations will naturally take place at 
the foot of the Giza pyramids. More than a 
thousand performers will gather on a 
20,000-square-metre stage and join Jean- 
Michel Jarre,a French composer who spe- 
cializes in mega-events, to present The [2 
Dreams of the Sun. 
The producers are happy, as the $9.5 
million spent on the project will be recove- 
red from some 50,000 people expected to 
attend with tickets ranging from $150 to 
$400 apiece. Such sums are beyond the 
reach of most young Egyptians, who will 
be able to have a “place in the sun” for a 
more modest amount. 
The concert will begin at dusk on the 
last day of 1999 and continue until dawn on 
the first day of 2000.When the first ray of 
the sun appears in the Egyptian sky, a nine- 
metre-high golden pyramid will be placed 
on the Cheops pyramid to mark the birth of 
the “new millennium”.

### 118299: International radio makes new waves

INTERNATIONAL 
RADIO MAKES 
NEW WAVES 
  
DP Cynthia Guttman 
    CONNEXIONS 
Once the sole source of outside news for many countries, international public broadcasters 
have had to adapt to a new competitive environment 
and German public radio broadcasters 
are making a joint bid to open an FM 
station in 2000. The venture is emblematic of 
the new world in which international radios 
are navigating. Almost overnight, the fall of 
the Iron Curtain radically called into question 
the traditional mission of these broadcas- 
ters—to send an oxygen balloon of informa- 
tion to citizens living in one-party states or 
under repressive regimes. 
Not that this mission has lost its rele- 
vance. Afghanistan and China are among 
Voice of America’s top five markets, and in 
the latter jamming is standard practice, a 
measure of the broadcaster’s undesirable 
influence, at least by Chinese government 
standards. In times of crisis such as the recent 
Kosovo conflict, audiences surge. Faced with 
the most drastic budget cuts in the history of 
German public broadcasting in 1999, 
Deutsche Welle’s director general Dieter Wei- 
rich remained adamant about the mission of 
an international service: “Two thirds of 
humanity live in countries without freedom of 
the press or information. We regard it as our 
particular duty to provide them with unin- 
terrupted objective information from credible 
sources.” 
| In Budapest (Hungary), British, French 
A buoy for freedom 
But in many parts of the world, the end of 
the Cold War has taken a time-old ideological 
edge off the equation, forcing international 
broadcasters to adjust rapidly to a radically 
new, more fragmented environment. No lon- 
ger can they claim to be the sole alternative to 
censored government broadcasts; no longer 
are they viewed as a freedom buoy to some, a 
subversive force to others. Furthermore, in 
numerous developing countries, newly elec- 
ted governments have yielded control over 
D Unesco Courier journalist, with additional reporting 
from Canada by Anne Pelouas  
the airwaves, often opening the way for a plu- 
rality of opinions to be expressed on new FM 
(frequency modulation) stations. 
“Because of a different political context, 
radios whose main goal was to provide infor- 
mation to countries that didn’t have access 
to any outside news sources have had to 
change their tune and develop on trans- 
mission mediums other than short wave,” 
explains Hugues Salord, director of inter- 
national affairs at Radio France Interna- 
tionale. In a sense, they have had to learn 
to “sell themselves” on markets with enti- 
rely different cultures and expectations,be 
it in Europe, Africa, Asia or Latin America. 
In short,external broadcasters have had to 
become both local and international. 
The process of adapting to open markets 
has been tantamount to an intensive im mer- 
sion course for external broadcasters. In a 
deregulated audiovisual landscape, the first 
move for all broadcasters was to strike up 
partnerships with FM stations around the 
world for rebroadcast of their programmes, or 
to acquire FM transmitters to set up local fre- 
quencies, a more expensive option. As a 
medium, FM represents a quantum quality 
leap over crackly short wave,allowing broad- 
casters to speak faster and insert music into 
programmes. 
The BBC, according to the World Servi- 
ce’s European news and current affairs edi- 
tor Mark Brayne, was “streets ahead of almost 
anybody else” in building up FM networks, 
starting with Finland in 1987. In 1990, the 
World Service was in Romania just after the 
fall of the Communist regime signing deals 
with emerging radio stations and has built up 
a network of 97 local rebroadcasters. A recent 
study shows that the British broadaster has 
captured 17 per cent of the Romanian radio 
audience: “We have become a national broad- 
caster in a sense. We cover Romanian news in 
quite some detail but with BBC journalistic

values embedded into a solid analytical fare 
ofinternational news,’ says Brayne. 
Africa, where broadcast markets deregu- 
lated faster than in Asia, is a particularly cove- 
ted zone. Wherever an external broadcaster 
can get onto FM, audiences shoot up. The 
BBC and RFI pullin huge audiences in their 
former African colonies while Ethiopia ranks 
among VOA’s top five markets. RFI has star- 
ted to open up FM relays outside West Afti- 
can capitals, in the second and third largest 
cities, and is introducing locally produced pro- 
grammes in the Bambara language in Mali. 
“RFI is practically perceived as a full-fled- 
ged national radio service, with audience 
scores of up to 30 to 40 per cent of the 
French-speaking population,” says Erlends 
Calabuig, director of foreign languages. The 
French broadcaster is now trying to make 
inroads outside the francophone zone, with 
the recent opening of an FM station in Ghana 
and one to follow in Lagos. “There is a clear 
desire for countries in the region to break 
away from their zone of traditonal cultural 
influence,” says Salord. “I think anglophone 
Africaistaking a growing interest in the fran- 
cophone world, not only in a linguistic sense, 
but also from a political, economic and cul- 
tural standpoint.” 
Demand for accurate information 
Clearly, there is a strong demand for 
external broadcasters, and not only as pro- 
viders of international news. “There is far 
greater competition on a large number of 
markets, but not always for accurate and 
impartial news,” says Caroline Thomson, 
deputy chief executive of the BBC World 
Service. “In many countries, a lot of music 
stations have come on the air as a result of 
dergulation, but news is quite heavily regu- 
lated or of very poor quality and subject to 
considerable local interference.” 
Voice of America’s director Sandy Unger 
concurs that there is a strong demand in emer- 
ging democracies for balanced and accurate 
information. “Where media are not fully deve- 
loped, where there are criminal libel laws and 
all sorts of constraints on free flow of infor- 
mation, reliable information very often has to 
come from the outside,” he affirms. Evidence 
seems to speak for itself. Pointing to VOA’s 
400 affiliate FM stations in Latin America, 
he asks: “Why are they signing up for this if 
there is no need, if they were confident that 
information is being provided in their socie- 
ties?’ 
While all the major broadcasters are pre- 
sent on local FMs, they each have a mission 
to uphold. The BBC World Service stands by 
its reputation for trust and quality, repeatedly 
singled out in its audience surveys. Voice of 
America, which became an independent 
44 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
federal entity in October, upholds its man- 
date to report on world news and on Ameri- 
can politics, society and culture. RFI prides 
itself on presenting a French reading of the 
news that reflects the diversity of opinion in 
the country. DW's director Dieter Weirich 
underlines the broadcaster’s role in “forming 
an international awareness about the new 
modern Germany.” But how this mission is 
carried out has changed, because FM calls 
for a more upbeat,interactive style of pro- 
gramming than short-wave broadcasting. And 
because FM stations are locally based, broad- 
casters have to understand and cultivate their 
niche audiences. 
“It 1s really a matter of zooming in,” 
explains RFI’s Calabuig.“ We have moved 
away from reaching an indiscriminate mass of 
listeners via one means of transmission span- 
ning the whole globe to a focus on proximity, 
which means catering to the expectations of 
listeners.” While international news remains 
the backbone of all the broadcasters’ pro- 
gramming and has been significantly expan- 
ded over the past few years to provide round- 
the-clock coverage, menus have also become 
more eclectic, mixing music and features adap- 
ted to different regions. Local production has 
taken on a heightened importance. 
From 1989 onwards, the BBC started 
recruiting younger people in the former Eas- 
tern bloc who were familiar with the target 
area. In Bucharest and Sofia, RFI’s subsidiaries 
broadcast a mix of locally produced pro- 
grammes along with others from Paris offe-

There is a strong conviction, voiced by all 
European external broadcasters, that they have 
arole to play in “accompanying a dialogue bet- 
ween Central and Eastern European coun- 
tries, to offer an opening onto Europe,” as 
Calabuig puts in. And there is also a common 
responsibility towards building a unified 
Europe: Radio E, a current events programme, 
is put together with contributions from several 
public European broadcasters, giving listeners 
aricher reading of regional issues. 
Local language broadcasting 
Broadcasting in local languages is one of 
the keys to reaching new audiences. RFI’s 
efforts to break into anglophone Africa will 
be stalled until the broadcaster can afford to 
move into local languages, namely Swahili 
and Hausa, asVOA, BBC and DW have all 
done.The BBC has introduced several lan- 
guages spoken in the newly independent repu- 
blics of the former Soviet Union, notably 
Uzbek,Azeri, Ukrainian, Kazakh and Kyr- 
gyz. At the same time, it has shut down other 
language services—mostly vernacular lan- 
guages in Western Europe—which doesn’t 
necessarily mean loss of influence. 
The BBC's strategy is to target elites, 
and more often than not this can be done in 
English. “When we have cut languages, it’s 
tended to be because we thought that they 
were no longer effective rather than because 
our budget had been slashed,” says Thom- 
son. The BBC’s most recent decision to pull 
out of German was taken after studies sho- 
wed that most of the broadcaster’s audience 
in the German-speaking world listened to 
its programmes in English. In the U.S. the 
World Service’s audience has even recor- 
ded growth in recent years. 
Faced with cutbacks, DW is ending its 
programmes in Japanese and Spanish, and is 
in the process of closing several other language 
services, including Czech, Slovak and Hun- 
garian,judging that the countries where these 
languages are spoken are now “established 
democracies with a great variety of media avai- 
lable”. It is however expanding its Russian 
and English-language programmes, and aims 
to make headway in the Asian market via the 
AsiaSat 2 satellite. Regardless of budget 
constraints, all the major players have intro- 
duced broadcasts in Albanian and Macedo- 
nian, reflecting the priority they put on being 
on air as fast as possible when political cir- 
cumstances warrant. 
Introducing new languages may be at the 
heart of broadcasters’strategies in emerging 
democracies and developing countries, but it 
costs money. While all broadcasters underline 
their editorial independence from govern- 
ment, they all rely on them for funding, and

none has been graced with a generous influx 
over the past decade. VOA’s director Sandy 
Unger fears “dramatic cuts” if Congress only 
grants the service a straightline budget for fis- 
cal 2000, which would mean absorbing a 4.8 
per cent cost of living increase. The World Ser- 
vice’s budget has declined in real terms over 
the past eight years. RFI’s has been stable. 
DW's budget for 1999 was reduced by DM 
30 million ($16.6 million/4.7 per cent), and 
will be slashed by a further 10 per cent to DM 
546 million ($302.3 million), up to the year 
2003—seemingly a turnabout from last year, 
when the newly elected government promi- 
sed “an improvement in the way the country 
represents itself to the outside world ’accor- 
ding toWeirich. Besides six language closures, 
over 700 jobs are to be cut. 
In the early 1990s, Radio Canada Inter- 
nationale (RCI), a smaller player on the world 
stage, cut seven of its 15 languages and 
shrunk its staff, and nearly went off the air in 
1996 when it was was saved at the eleventh 
hour by a federal government grant.Florian 
Sauvageau, a professor at Laval University 
(Canada), argues that the crisis reflected the 
government’s lack of interest in internatio- 
nal culural relations. RCI now aims to put 
forward the country’s economic strength and 
cultural diversity, and is boosting broadcas- 
ting to China and Africa. 
In this belt-tightening environment,one 
of the dilemmas is how to be present on all 
fronts. In politically sensitive zones, exter- 
nal radios have to maintain a short-wave pre- 
sence in addition to their FM frequencies 
and satellite broadcasting. Then comes 
investment in new technologies. The Inter- 
net is top priority for all public broadcasters. 
“It’s the short wave of the future,’ affirms 
Thomson. “The trouble with FM is that you 
are very susceptible to local pressures,” she 
continues, noting that at any one time, the 
World Service has a couple of FM stations 
off the air because an item has offended the 
powers in place. “If you are looking at how to 
maintain vibrant international broadcasting 
in 20 years time, you've got to invest in the 
Internet now. It’s a much freer medium.” 
Digitalizing short wave 
Thanks to the net, Indian and Pakistani 
communities in Britain can, for example, 
access programmes in Hindiand Urdu. Viet- 
namese can do the same in their own language, 
whether they are in the U.S. or Vietnam. All 
broadcasters are also keeping a close watch on 
World space—direct reception via satellite on 
individual dishes allowing for an exceptional 
quality—and the imminent digitalization of 
short wave, which is likely to give this medium 
anew lease on life. Digitalized shortwave will 
not only ensure higher listening quality, but 
also reduce production costs, allowing for a 
burst of new stations to go on air and cater to 
increasingly specific audience segments. 
Many of the countries where deregu- 
lation is underway inherited state broad- 
casting services from their former impe- 
rial powers. Now, the latter are helping 
the liberalization process along, often by 
providing training courses and technical 
assistance. RFI recalls that its launch of 
the first FM station in Dakar (Senegal) in 
1991 played a significant role in “opening 
up and enriching the radio landscape and 
reinvigorating national public radio.” For 
VOA’s Unger, in a number of developing 
countries, “international broadcasters are 
serving as an example of what can be 
developed.” Whichever technology wins 
out—and colossal investments are at 
stake—only contents can give external 
broadcasters the cutting edge. Their grea- 
test asset, for Salord, lies in their exper- 
tise, know-how and worldwide network 
of correspondents. “International radio 
broadcasters have a role to play in decryp- 
ting the complexity of the world we live 
in. This is our job, not to give value judg- 
ments or lessons but to provide facts and 
elements that help the listener in forming 
his or her own opinion.” [|

### 118300: Wangari Muta Maathai: Kenya's green militant

WANGARI MUTA MAATHAI: 
KENYA'S GREEN MILITANT 
A noted environmental and pro-democracy activist hopes the next millennium will see a new 
African leadership that puts people first 
You once said that the quality of the 
environment cannot be improved unless and 
until the living conditions of ordinary people 
are improved. Could you enlarge on this? 
If you want to save the environment 
you should protect the people first, 
because human beings are part of biologi- 
cal diversity. And if we can’t protect our 
own species, what’s the point of protec- 
ting tree species? 
It sometimes looks as if poor people are 
destroying the environment. But they are 
so preoccupied with their survival that they 
are not concerned about the long-term 
damage they are doing to the environment 
simply to meet their most basic needs. 
So it is ironic that the poor people 
who depend on the environment are also 
partly responsible for its destruction. 
That’s why I insist that the living condi- 
tions of the poor must be improved if we 
really want to save our environment. 
For example, in certain regions of 
Kenya, women walk for miles to get fire- 
wood from the forests, as there are no 
trees left nearby. When fuel is in short 
supply, women have to walk further and 
further to find it. Hot meals are served 
less frequently, nutrition suffers,and hun- 
ger increases. If these women had enough 
resources they would not be depleting 
valuable forest. 
What is at stake in the forests of Kenya and 
East Africa today? 
Since the beginning of this century, 
there has been a clear tendency to cut 
down indigenous forests and to replace 
them with exotic species for commercial 
exploitation. We’ve now become more 
aware of what this involves and have reali- 
zed that it was wrong to cut down indige- 
nous forests, thereby destroying our rich 
biological diversity. But much damage has 
already been done. 
When the Green Belt Movement (see 
box page 47) started its campaign in 1977 
to plant trees, Kenya had about 2.9 per 
cent of forest cover. Today the forested 
area has further dwindled to around two 
46 The Unesco Courier - December 1999 
per cent. We are losing more trees than we 
are planting. 
The other important issue is that the 
East African environment is very vulne- 
rable. We are very close to the Sahara 
desert, and experts have been warning 
that the desert could expand southwards 
like a flood if we keep on felling trees 
indiscriminately, since trees prevent soil 
erosion caused by rain and wind. By clea- 
ring remaining patches of forests we are in 
essence creating many micro-Sahara 
deserts. We can already see evidence of 
this phenomenon. 
‘The act of planting trees 
conveys a simple message. 
It suggests that at the very 
least you can plant a tree and 
improve your habitat. 
It increases people’s awareness 
that they can take control of 
their environment, which is 
the first step toward greater 
participation in society’ 
We hold civic education seminars for 
rural people, especially farmers, as part of 
campaigns to raise public awareness 
about environmental issues. If you were to 
ask a hundred farmers how many of them 
remember a spring or a stream that has 
dried up in their lifetime, almost 30 of 
them would raise their hands. 
What has your Green Belt Movement (GBM) 
achieved and in particular to what extent has 
it prevented environmental degradation in 
Kenya? 
The most notable achievement of the 
GBM in my view has been in raising envi- 
ronmental awareness among ordinary 
citizens, especially rural people. Different 
groups of people now realize that the 
environment is a concern for everybody 
and not simply a concern for the 
government. It is partly because of this 
awareness that we are now able to reach 
out to decision-makers in the govern- 
ment. Ordinary citizens are challenging 
them to protect the environment. 
Secondly, the GBM introduced the 
idea of environmental conservation 
through trees because trees meet many 
basic needs of rural communities. We 
started out by planting seven trees in a 
small park in Nairobi in 1977. At that 
time we had no tree nursery, no staff and 
no funds, only a conviction that ordinary 
country people had a role to play in sol- 
ving environmental problems. We went on 
from there and now we have planted over 
20 million trees all over Kenya. 
The act of planting trees conveys a 
simple message. It suggests that at the 
very least you can plant a tree and impro- 
ve your habitat. It increases people’s awa- 
reness that they can take control of their 
environment, which is the first step 
toward greater participation in society. 
Since the trees we have planted are 
visible, they are the greatest ambassadors 
for our movement. 
Despite the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 and the 
Kyoto Climate summit in 1997, there has been 
no significant progress in environmental 
protection programmes and campaigns at a 
global level. Why? 
Unfortunately, for many world leaders 
development still means extensive far- 
ming of cash crops, expensive hydroelec- 
tric dams,hotels,supermarkets,and luxu- 
ry items, which plunder human and 
natural resources. This is short-sighted 
and does not meet people’s basic needs— 
for adequate food, clean water, shelter, 
local clinics, information and freedom. 
As a result of this craze for so-called 
development, environmental protection 
has taken a back seat. The problem is that 
the people who are responsible for much 
of the destruction of the environment are 
precisely those who should be providing 
leadership in environmental protection 
campaigns. But they are not doing so.

Also, political power now is wielded 
by those who have business interests and 
close links with multinational corpora- 
tions (MNCs). The only aim of these 
MNCs is to make profit at the expense of 
the environment and people. 
We also know that many world political 
leaders are persuaded by MN Cs not to pay 
attention to declarations made in interna- 
tional environmental conferences. I stron- 
gly believe that as citizens we should refu- 
se to be at the mercy of these corporations. 
Corporations can be extremely merciless, 
as they have no human face. 
You started your career as an academic. Later 
you became an environmentalist, and now you 
are called a pro-democracy activist. How would 
you describe your evolution in the last 25 years? 
Few environmentalists today are wor- 
ried about the welfare of bees, butterflies 
and trees alone. They know that it is not 
possible to keep the environment pure if 
you have a government that does not 
control polluting industries and deforesta- 
tion. 
In Kenya, for example, real estate deve- 
lopers have been allowed to go into the 
middle of indigenous forests and build 
expensive houses. As concerned indivi- 
duals we should oppose that. When you 
start intervening at that level, you find 
yourself in direct confrontation with poli- 
cy-makers and you start to be called an 
activist. 
I was teaching at the University of 
Nairobi in the 1970s, when I felt that the 
academic rights of women professors 
were not being respected because they 
were women. I became an activist at the 
university, insisting that I wanted my 
rights as an academic. 
TALKING TO... 
A 20-MILLION-TREE 
GREEN BELT 
na country where women play a marginal role 
in political and social affairs, 59-year-old Wan- 
gari Muta Maathai’s achievements stand out as an 
exception. A biologist, she was the first woman 
from East Africa to receive a doctorate, to become 
a professor and chair a department—all at the Uni- 
versity of Nairobi. 
Maathai began to be active in the National 
Council of Women of Kenya in 1976 and it was 
through the Council that she launched a tree-plan- 
ting project called “Save the Land Harambee’ (a 
Swahili word meaning let's all pull together). The 
project was renamed the Green Belt Movement 
(GBM) in 1977. 
The GBM initiated programmes to promote 
and protect biodiversity, to protect the soil, to 
create jobs especially in rural areas, to give 
women a positive image in the community and to 
assert their leadership qualities. 
The overall aim of the GBM hasbeen to create 
public awareness of the need to protect the envi- 
ronment through tree planting and sustainable 
management. Nearly 80 per cent of the 20 million 
trees planted by the GBM have survived. At pre- 
sent the GBM has over 3,000 nurseries, giving job 
opportunities to about 80,000 people, most of 
them rural women. 
In 1986 the GBM established a Pan-African 
Green Belt Network and has organized work- 
shops and training programmes on environ- 
mental awareness for scores of individuals from 
other African countries. This has led to the adop- 
tion of Green Belt methods in Tanzania, Uganda, 
Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe. 
Maathai, who is a member of the UN Secre- 
tary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament, 
has won 14 international awards, including the 
prestigious Right Livelihood Award. She won the 
award, presented by a Swedish foundation and 
often referred to as an Alternative Nobel Prize, in 
recognition of her “contributions to the well- 
being of humankind”. 
In a country where single-party rule prevailed 
for decades, Maathai has been teargassed and 
severely beaten by police during demonstrations 
to protect Kenya's forests. 
“The government thinks that by threatening 
me and bashing me they can silence me,” says 
Maathai. “But | have an elephant’s skin. And 
somebody must raise their voice.” 
Maathai, a mother of three children, is cur- 
rently involved in a struggle to save the 2,500-acre 
Karura forests, northwest of Nairobi, where the 
government wants to build housing complexes.

TALKING TO... 
Meanwhile,I found myself confronted 
by other issues that were directly related 
to my work but were not clear to me at 
the outset, like human rights. This direct- 
ly led me to another area, governance. As 
a result I was drafted into the pro-demo- 
cracy campaign. 
I realized in the 1970s that in a young 
democracy like ours it was very easy for 
leaders to become dictators. As this hap- 
pened they started using national 
resources as though they were their per- 
sonal property. I realized that the consti- 
tution had given them powers to misuse 
official machinery. 
‘At one time Members of 
Parliament accused me and 
ridiculed me for being a 
divorced woman. | have felt 
that deep inside they were 
hoping that by calling into 
question my womanhood | 
would be subdued. Later they 
realized they were wrong’ 
So I became involved in the pro- 
democracy movement and pressed for 
constitutional reforms and political space 
to ensure freedom of thought and expres- 
sion. We cannot live with a political sys- 
tem that kills creativity and produces 
cowardly people. 
With your academic qualifications you could 
have lived a comfortable life in the U.S or 
elsewhere in the West. But you decided to 
come back and settle down in Kenya. In the 
last 25 years, you have been verbally abused, 
threatened, beaten, put behind bars and on 
many occasions forbidden to leave the 
country. Have you ever regretted returning to 
Kenya and becoming an activist? 
I did not deliberately decide to beco- 
me an activist, but I have never regretted 
the fact that I decided to stay here and to 
contribute to the development of this 
country and my region. I know that I have 
made a little difference. 
Many people come up to me and tell 
me that my work has inspired them.T his 
gives me great satisfaction because in the 
earlier days, especially during the dicta- 
torship, it was difficult to speak. 
Until a few years ago, people used to 
come up to me in the street and whisper 
“I am with you and I am praying for you.“ 
They were so scared of being identified 
with me that they did not want to be 
heard. I know a lot of people were afraid 
of talking to me and being seen with me 
because they might be punished. 
I have been a greater positive force by 
staying here and going through trials and 
tribulations than if I had gone to other 
countries. It would have been very diffe- 
rent to live in the West and say my coun- 
try should do this and that. By being here 
I encourage many more people. 
Do you think you were subjected to virulent 
attacks and abuses because you questioned 
men’s decisions? 
Our men think African women should 
be dependent and submissive, definitely 
not better than their husbands. There is no 
doubt that at first many people opposed 
me because I am a woman and resented 
the idea that I had strong opinions. 
In Madagascar, a woman plants rice in the ashes of a felled area of forest, home to the last survivors 
of a lemur species.

I know that at times men in positions

I have felt that deep inside they were

In 1989, for example, we had a big

we were fighting to save Uhuru Park in 
Nairobi. I argued that it would be ridicu-

centre of the city and replace it with a 
multi-storeyed complex. 
Uhuru Park was the only place in 
Nairobi where people could spend time 
with their families outdoors. The park was 
a wonderful place for people to go becau- 
se it was a place where no one bothered 
them.

the first time, I tried very hard with other 
political groups to unite the opposition, 
but in vain.When there were many oppo- 
sition candidates running for the presi-

on a 
TALKING TO... 
opposition in 1992. This is exactly what 
they are now clamouring for. 
In the 1997 general elections, my idea was 
to persuade the opposition to unite and field 
a strong candidate from one ethnic commu- 
nity against the ruling Kenya African Natio- 
nal Union (KANU).1 But I was called a tri- 
balist by some opposition groups for 
proposing that idea. When all my efforts to 
unite the opposition failed, I decided to run 
for president. 
But during the campaign I also came to 
realize that in this country it is very difficult 
to get elected without money. I didn’t have 
money. I realized that it doesn’t matter how 
good you are, how honest you are and how 
pro-democratic you are, if you don’t have 
money to give to the voter you won’t get 
elected.So I lost. 
All this gave me a new experience. 
Now I can speak as an insider. I also rea- 
lized that people here are not yet ready for 
democracy and we need a lot of civic edu- 
cation and political consciousness. People 
here are still controlled by ethnicity and 
vote along ethnic lines. The ethnic ques- 
tion became a very important issue 
during the last elections. 
Despite having enormous natural resources 
Africa still lags behind other continents in terms 
of development and growth. Why is this? 
Poor leadership, without any doubt. This 
generation of African leaders will go down in 
history as a very irresponsible one that has 
brought Africa to its knees. During the past 
1.The Kenya African National Union (KANU) 
was formed in 1960, won the country’s first post- 
independence election in 1963, and has been in 
power ever since. 
 
“This generation of African 
leaders will go down 
in history as a very 
irresponsible one that has 
brought Africa to its knees. 
During the past three decades, 
Africa has suffered from 
a lack of visionary and 
altruistic leaders committed 
to the welfare of their people’ 
three decades, Africa has suffered from a 
lack of visionary and altruistic leaders com- 
mitted to the welfare of their people. 
There are historical reasons for this. 
Just before independence was granted to 
many African countries, young Africans 
were promoted by colonial rulers to posi- 
tions until then unoccupied by the local 
people and were trained to take over 
power from the colonial administration. 
The new black administrators and 
burgeoning elites enjoyed the same eco- 
nomic and social life-styles and privileges 
that the imperial administrators enjoyed. 
The only difference between the two in 
terms of the objectives for the country 
was the colour of their skin. 
In the process, the African leaders aban- 
doned their people, and in order to maintain 
their hold on power they did exactly what 
the colonial system was doing, namely to pit 
one community against another. This 
internal conflict continued for decades in 
many African countries, draining their 
scarce resources. 
So what we need is to improve our lea- 
dership. If we don’t there is no hope, because 
history teaches us that if you cannot protect 
what is your own somebody will come and 
take it. If our people cannot protect them- 
selves they will continue to be exploited. T heir 
resources will continue to be exploited. 
It is also true that Western powers, 
especially the former colonial masters of 
this region, have continued to exploit 
Africa and have continued to work very 
closely with these dictators and irrespon- 
sible leaders. That is why we are now deep 
in debt, which we cannot repay. 
Africa also needs assistance from inter- 
national governments to improve its eco- 
nomic standing. For example, most foreign 
aid to Africa comes in the form of curative 
social welfare programmes such as famine 
relief, food aid, population control pro- 
grammes, refugee camps, peace-keeping 
forces and humanitarian missions. 
At the same time, hardly any resources 
are available for sustainable human deve- 
lopment programmes such as functional 
education and training, development of 
infrastructure, food production and pro- 
motion of entrepreneurship. There are no 
funds for the development of cultural and 
social programmes which would empower 
people and release their creative energy. 
I am hoping that in the new millennium 
anew leadership will emerge in Africa,and 
I hope this new leadership will show more 
concern for the people and utilize the conti- 
nent’s resources to help Africans get out of 
poverty. [|
