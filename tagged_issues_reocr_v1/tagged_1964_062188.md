The International Hydrological Decade 
A WORLD-WIDE PROGRAMME 
OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
by Michel Batisse 
  
O- nced for water is constantly increasing, whether we arc 
turning a tap in our own home, irrigating our fields or 
running the cooling equipment in our nation’s electric power stations and 
industries. 
‘There is an automatic increase due to population growth. Beeause of this 
increase alone, in 20 years time we are likely to be needing more than three 
cubic metres of water where twa suffice today. The overall 
improvement of living standards to which all men aspire, the fight against 
hunger through the irrigation of more land for food growing, the creation and 
expansion of new industries all foretell the need for even greater water supplies 
throughout the world. Though it is difficult to calculate the exact amount, 
it is safe to say that in 20 years’ time the demand for water will roughly 
double. 
Such a rapid increase in water consumption can only he met through water- 
works programmes of tremendous scope and diversity. In many places we 
shall be obliged to turn to increasingly remote and inaccessible sources for 
our water, or obtain it through the costly processes which purify polluted 
water for further use or remove the salt from sea-water. 
In any case, whether we are concerned with transporting water over great 
distances, storing it in reservoirs or maintaining its quality, the installation and 
construction work involved in doubling our water supply within the next two 
decades will cost a fabulous amount—possibly several millions of millions of 
dollars for the world as a whole. x 
4 Faced with such a situation it is obvious that we should scarch as widely as 
ee. 3 possible and with every available means for those sourccs of fresh water that 
He 3 seem to be tbe least costly. But where do these sources exist? Only a 
| sustained and co-ordinated programme of scientific observation and research

HYDROLOGICAL DECADE (Cont'd) 
can only be estimated through quantitative studies of the water “balance sheet” 
of the river basins. As with any balance sheet, we first have to add up the 
entries on the “credit” side, that js, the quantities of water that are received 
in the form of rain or snow. Then we have to total up the “debit” side: what 
happens to this rain, how much of it runs off to the rivers, how much eeeps 
underground, how much evaporates into the atmosphere, how much is absorbed 
by plant life and then discharged into the atmosphere by the process of trans- 
piration, Other studies relating to changes in the quality of water or the 
impact of man’s actions on the hydrologic eycle are also needed. 
All this work and all these aspects of research are the domain of hydrology— 
the science of the world’s waters, the different forms in which they exist, their 
circulation and distribution over the globe, their physical and chemical pro- 
perties, their interactions with the environment, including their responses to 
human activity. 
As everyone realizes, there is always a period between the discovery of 
scientific facts and their practical application. In hydrology, however, we still 
know too little about many aspects of the subject to be able to produce rational 
solutions to water supply problems that will be facing us tomorrow. There are 
plenty of examples to support this view. 
The chief problem for the hydrologist, for instance, is that he has to deal 
with a most unreliable element. During certain months or years, the river 
levels are low and wells run dry. Agriculture and hydro-electric production 
arc hampered by shortages of water. Conversely, some periods are too wet and 
disastrous floods are unleashed. 
If hydrology is really a science, it should enable us to forecast the behaviour 
of the natural plienomena with which it deals. The hydrologist should be 
able to tell the dam builder what the maximum flood level is likely to be over 
the next 100 years. Ile should be able to forecast how much water will be 
available during a dry summer. Unfortunately, in the field of hydrological 
forecasting we have still no reliable means of finding out these things, since 
we lack records of observations carried out over a sufficiently long period, and 
because we still know too little about the laws governing fluctuations in elimate 
and the movement of water. 
LJomoroum water reserves are much larger than those on the 
surfaee, but as they are unseen we tend to underestimate them. 
It is vitally important that we niake use of these underground reserves, but 
never blindly or haphazardly. For example, where does the water come from 
which we find in one or another of the underground water bearing layers (the 
“aquifers”) ? Ilow does it move? How is it renewed? The age of an under- 
ground aquifer—the time the water has been there—may vary from a few 
weeks to several thousand years. The aquifer may even be completely 
“fossile” and never be renewed at all. And if tliis water is used, what effect 
will it have on the discharge and future level of the water table? What are 
the laws of hydrogeology? Despite the immense progress of recent years, all 
these questions have still not been fully answered. 
Water storage in a natural reservoir under the earth, free from evaporation 
and sedimentation which plague surface dams, the pumping of these sources 
and even replenishing them should their supply become exhiausted—all these 
offer the engineer a vast field full of remarkable possibilities. But here too his 
action must be based on accurate knowledge of the phenomena he is using or 
creating, and so far we are only just beginning to glimpse this knowledge. 
A similar need for scientific research exists in the branch of hydrology that 
deals with the quality of water. In nature there is no water like the pure water 
defined by chemists, made up only of hydrogen and oxygen. River water, 
ground-water and even rainwater always contain other dissolved or suspended 
clements, and these, even when present in small quantities, play an important 
role. In the case of irrigation farming, for instance, every drop of water brings 
with it a little salt: the water evaporates but the salt remains and gradually 
poisons the soil and plants. In general we now know how to remedy this 
problem: of salinity with the help of leaching and drainage. But many ques-

tions remain unanswered regarding the effect of irrigation and drainage on the 
quality of ground-water and the possibility of maintaining the ground-water 
level below the zone of plant roots while bringing to the surface the water 
necessary for irrigation. 
What happens exactly in this thin layer of soil which preserves the moisture 
necessary to plant life? What form, liquid or vapour, does the water take in 
this zone? What forces act on the water, depending on the kind of soil pre- 
sent? How long will this life-giving moisture last? Evaporation from the soil 
and transpiration of vegetation are responsible for the direct return to the 
atmosphere of more than half of the water which falls on the land. 
How exactly do these phenomena, which represent an enormous loss of 
resources, occur? What part does a forest play in the water halance-shect 
of a given area? Does it act merely as a water-consuming mechanism operating 
through the absorption and transpiration of trees, therchby reducing the 
quantity of runofl which reaches the rivers or, on the contrary, does it result 
in a slow seepage into the earth which ean later be recovered in the form of 
ground-water, while at thie same time avoiding erosion? These are the kinds 
of problems which have still to be resolved in relation to all known yardsticks 
and all the different cases which arise in nature; the answers will only he 
found through a vast programme of scientific research. 
S has never progressed in isolation. To inercase interna- 
tional contacts between hydrologists is already an effective 
way of promoting hydrology, just as international co-operation among physicists 
helps to promote physics. 
However, in the case of hydrology the subject itself has an international 
character. Rivers and ground-water reserves know no frontiers. No country, 
however large, can hope to have within its borders all the possible kinds of 
hydrological situations which must be studied and compared so that hasic 
conclusions can be drawn. The presence and distribution of water on a 
continent or in any arca of the globe is the result of water circulation on the 
earth as a whole; in other words, hydrology’s laboratory is the world at large. 
There are still other reasons to justify an international programme. Every 
country, whether economically developed or not, is facing problems created by 
the rapid development of hydraulic resources. But everywhere there is a 
shortage of top specialists and technicians in hydrology. While more have 
to be trained the best use must be made of those we already have, in order 
to help the many countries which are still inadequately equipped in this field. 
Finally, more students must be encouraged to take up hydrology; public and 
official interest in water problems must be aroused, before even more difficult 
situations arise; and every appropriate scientific resource should be put at the 
service of hydrology, We shall only achieve these goals by creating a strong 
force of public opinion, which will only make its full impact if internationally 
based. 
The variability of hydrological phenomena from year to year mitigates 
against the concentration on an international programme over a short period 
—during one year for instance—as has been the case in other fields of science. 
This is why the idea of a decade was proposed. From the hydrologist’s view- 
point a 10-year study is not a very long one. Hydrologists prefer wherever 
possible to work from observations made over much longer periods. But a

The general programme of the International Hydrological Decade was 
worked out by an intergovernmental meeting of specialists held at UNEsco’s

hydrology. The meeting also singled out plans for action during the first

HYDROLOGICAL DECADE (Cont'd) 
A unique stocktaking of our resources 
are based on the contributions for the general programme proposed by nearly 
60 nations, 
An initial group of activities covers the collection of basic data. Thanks 
to the Decade, observation of hydrological events—the quantities of rain and 
snow that fall, the discharge of rivers and underground sources, the amount 
of sediment that is moved, etc—should be given a major boost, especially in 
the developing countries. 
Basic data of this kind are not only the raw material of hydrological 
research; in many cases they will be of practical use to engineers for tlie 
simple reason that if in 20 years time water works are to be constructed on 
a river about which little is known at present, now is the time to start making 
hydrological observations, 
Comparisons can only the made at the international level and a general 
pattern of rules deduced on the basis of uniform and reliable measurements. 
This is why hydrological stations in each country will be designated as Decade 
Stations. In the well-equipped countries, this simply means that some existing 
stations will be chosen and given special tasks. But in other countries Decade 
Stations will have to be built, so as to create an international network that is 
sufficiently dense and representative. 
A second group of activities will deal with inventories and water balance 
sheets, starting with those of the small basins and working up to the large 
rivers, to continents and even to a world scale level. Research of this kind 
assumes that sufficient basic data already exist to bring out a pattern which 
alone can give an overall picture of the basin concerned. For a better under- 
standing of the hydrologic cycle as it operates in various natural, characteristic 
areas, corresponding for instance to different climates, many countries will 
set up “representative basins” which may cover a surface area of several 
hundred square kilometres. These areas will include at least one Decade 
Station, and comprehensive observation facilities. “Experimental basins,” 
which will be smaller than the representative basins, will also be set up. Here, 
the natural conditions will be deliberately modified—the vegetation will be 
changed for instance—so that the effect of these modifications on the hydro- 
logic cycle can be studied. 
A final group of projects will investigate a broad range of prob- 
lems involving scientific research in its strictest sense. 
Scientists will be looking for answers to the kind of problems that have already 
been mentioned. Every branch of hydrology—runoff, soil moisture, evapora- 
tion, movement of ground-water, the dynamies of lakes, estuaries and deltas, 
the evolution of glaciers or the geochemistry of water—raises a whole series of 
fascinating problems of immense theoretical and practical significance. 
The International Hydrological Decade is planned as an international ven- 
ture in scientifie co-operation. It is up to individual countries to make 
whatever contribution they can to the programme. Since hydrology concerns 
many different sectors in every State, National Decade Committees are being 
set up to co-ordinate national activities. Some forty such committees have 
already been formed. To provide overall direction at the international level, it 
is planned to set up, during UNEsco’s General Conference in November, a 
Decade Co-ordinating Council comprising representatives from 18 countries. 
Unesco plans to make a major contribution towards the suecess of the 
Decade, by arranging for the exchange of scientific information, the organi- 
zation of working groups and, in particular, the training of hydrologists in 
countries where they are most needed. Other U.N. organizations, above all, 
Electric generating stations use 
enormous amounts of water. To 
overcome the problem of obtaining 
water on this scale, ways have been 
devised to make use of the same 
water again and again by pumping 
it through cooling towers, like 
the one shown below at Etiwanda, 
in California. The hot water 
evacuated from the generating plant 
is taken to the top of the tower. As 
it drops to the bottom it is broken 
into droplets by millions of wooden 
slats and crosspieces inside the 
tower and cooled by huge fans.

About 97 9%, of the world’s water

of the fresh water reserves are 
frozen up in glaciers and, above 
all, in the polar icecaps. If the 
Antarctic icecap melted it would 
produce enough water to feed all 
the world’s rivers for about 800

“THE WORLD 
by Luna B. Leopold 
T= earth, Including its oceans and atmo- 
sphere, Is a glant distiilation system whose 
operation brings about the distribution of fresh water 
throughout the world, from the frozen wastes of polar 
regions to the burning--quatorial deserts. Stated in the 
simplest terms, distillation, condensation and liquid flow 
are the elemental processes which, on a grand scale, 
distribute and circulate throughout the world the water 
which is essential for all life. 
Water In liquid form absorbs heat energy, chlefly from 
the sun, and the absorbed energy changes the water from 
liquid to gaseous form. Transported in the atmosphere, 
the vapour later meets cooler conditions and condenses 
as precipitation, some of which replenishes the water in 
land areas. 
Because water Is continually being transformed from 
liquid to vapour and back to liquid again, the whole 
sequence of events ends where It began. That is, the 
condensed moisture in the form of precipitation runs 
into or off the surface of the earth, and a part of it 
collects in rivers which flow to the ocean. The events 
together form what is called the hydrological cycle. 
The cycle cannot be stopped, fortunately, owing to 
the fact that the energy which streams constantly to the 
earth from the sun is {nexhaustible. I say fortunately 
because, were this cycle to stop, there would no longer be 
that essential renewal of water as rain and snow to 
maintain rivers and soll moisture and to grow the plants 
and sustain animals on the continents. Indeed, were the 
cycle to be stopped for some cosmic reason, all water 
would finally come to rest In the oceans, and life could 
continue only in the marine realm. 
Though man is not able to alter the global cycle mat- 
erially, he may interrupt it locally by managing water to 
serve his needs. That part of the cycle from which man 
may take water contains but a small part of the world's 
total. Of the water which is precipitated as rain or snow 
in the land areas, somewhat more than two-thirds is 
returned to the atmosphere as water vapour through

WATER IN THE WORLD (Cont'd) 
Antarctic ice = world's 
river flow for 800 years: 
evaporation and transpiration by plants. These processes, 
then, have first call on precipitated water and their 
demands must be met before any runoff can occur in 
rivers. 
Considering how Important is the water in rivers, 
lakes and ground-water reservoirs, it ls surprising how 
little of the total water of the world Is In forms and 
places from which man may draw it with relative ease 
to meet his needs. In the present state of technology 
and water economics, the amount of water which can be 
drawn from salty sources such as the ocean ls Inslgni- 
flcant compared with man's total need. Yet the reservoir 
of salty water constituting the oceans Is by far the major 
portion of water on the earth. The oceans of the world 
contain 97% of all the water In the globe. The next 
largest item In the water budget 1s also essentially 
unusable by man: more than two per cent of the world’s 
water frozen up in glaciers and icecaps (see chart below). 
The amount of water In the icecaps is large compared 
with that in rivers. If the Antarctic icecap were melted, 
the amount of water freed would, if supplied at a uni- ° 
form rate, feed the Mississippi River for 50,000 years. 
It could provide the flow of all the rivers In the world | 
for about 800 years. 
Rivers constitute for mankind as a whole the principal 
source of water. Yet, surprisingly enough, this principal 
source contains at any one moment only about one 
hundredth of one percent of the water on the globe. 
Being such a small percentage, it 1s therefore under- 
standable that the surface water varies In avallability 
owing to the exigencles of day-to-day and month-to- 
month weather and the large differences in climatic 
character from place to place on the continents. 
Because water is essential for man’s existence, ways of 
providing him with what he needs have been discovered 
and rediscovered by successive generations and under a 
great variety of environmental conditions. Many civili- 
zations and certainly many cultures have derived their 
particular stamp and character from the conditions of 
life within which local water supplies had to be derived. 
Man has shown great versatility in finding ways of

making use of water as it occurred in its great circle 
through the hydrologic ring. 
Modern water problems, in fact, seem to be merely 
variants of the age-old difficulties that mankind has 
faced again and agaln. The water problems In the 
modern world are largely problems in learning fo manage 
a variable resource. This Is exactly the problem faced 
by anclent civilizatlons when man first began to bulld 
small dams for the diversion of water In surface channels, 
when he learned to dig wells, and more recently when he 
developed the centrifugal pump and iron pipe. 
Consider again the statement that the water most 
easily available to man is an extremely small part of 
the total water on the earth. The ease of withdrawal is 
of course Influenced by the amounts from which with- 
drawal is to be made, and these amounts are highly 
varlable. The resource would be much more varlable 
than It actually is were it not for the effect of the porous 
soll which acts as a simple but universal natural regu- 
lating reservoir. 
Storage of any commodity tends to even out the varia- 
tions of supply and to provide a more uniform. output. 
Winter storage of water Is one way to reduce seasonal 
variations and to make the supply sufficiently uniform 
to last during perlods of deficient rainfall. Storage, there- 
fore, 1s the key both in the natural environment and in 
man’s hydraulic works, to decrease the varlability of the 
inflow. Outflow from a storage reservoir can be uniform 
even though Inflow to the reservolr is very erratic. 
Water flows in river channels even during long rainless 
periods because the precipitation from previous storms 
has been temporarily stored in the ground and Is now 
being slowly released. Thus streamflow 1s less erratic 
than precipitation because of the storage provided by 
the porous earth.

But .man still has much to learn about using the natu- 
ral storage provided by nature. An example of how large 
Is one part of this natural storage is the amount of 
water in the ground. Water stored naturally in the 
ground within the upper half mile of the earth’s surface 
amounts to about a million cubic miles of water. This 
is some 3,000 times larger than the amount of water in 
the rivers of the world at any given moment in time. 
It is also 20 times larger than the amount of water in 
all the fresh water and saline lakes and Inland seas in 
the world. 
By far the largest amount of usable water at present 
not used by man is underground. Compared with this 
stored ground water, the amount which can be stored by 
dams on rivers is small indeed. The difficulty is that 
ground water, lying unseen, is not as easily surveyed or 
estimated, and usually requires considerable technical 
knowledge and modern equipment to exploit on a large 
scale. 
Moreover, because ground water is a stored reserve, its 
exploitation may under certain circumstances lead to its 
exhaustion. Or exploitation may lead to lowerihg of the 
ground water levels to such a depth that further exploi- 
tation becomes too costly. This might be described as 
economic exhaustion. 
One of the great needs, therefore, is to learn how to 
put water underground into the natural storage reser- 
volrs provided by porous rocks and gravel, in large quan- 
tity and economically. If this were done, one could with- 
draw the water agaln by pumping during times of shor- 
tage and would avoid the losses by evaporation which 
may be important in surface reservoirs. 
Furthermore, the storage space available underground 
in porous materials 1s nearly everywhere very much lar- 


### 62140: Water in the world

 
~~ THE WATER 
oa. 
All water comes from the 
ocean and is returned to it 
in a continuous hydrolo- 
gical cycle. Subcycles, or 
short circuits, occur on land 
where water evaporates or 
is transpired by vegetation. 
The water vapour contained 
in the atmosphere amounts 
to less than a one hundred 
thousandth part of the 
waters of the globe. A 
single cabbage may with- 
draw and transpire one 
quart of water daily, and a 
quite ordinary tree as much 
as 50 gallons. The immense 
reserve of underground 
water (3,600 times the 
volume of the water flow- 
ing in all the world's 
rivers) in the first half mile 
of the earth's crust shares 
in this cycle of water 
movement by flowing into 
rivers, lakes and the sea.

ger than the space even in the largest man-made surface 
reservoir. But we have not yet learned how to use the 
underground storage in the most practical ways. 
In summary, there is much more water on the earth 
than man can use, but most of it is salty and relatively 
little is actually avallable for human use. The small 
amount avallable Is variable in time and space and these 
variabilities are the cause of water problems. 
The principal approach to eliminating variability is 
storage and the natural storage provided by rocks and 
unconsolidated materials just beneath the earth’s surface 
exceed by far the surface storage facilities man has built 
or could build even in the most advanced countries. 
Advanced technologies allow withdrawal of ground 
water faster than it can be replenished by natural 
recharge. Overdraft on water in one place relative to 
another may worsen water problems by Increasing the 
geographic variability of usable water, as is described in 
other articles in this issue of The Unesco Courler. The 
International Hydrological Decade Is an attempt by 
Unesco to attract world attention to the importance of 
learning more about water on the earth. It is hoped 
that the results of such Improved knowledge on the 
occurrence of water and the processes involved will 
improve man’s ability generally to utilize this resource 
better and more efficiently for the good of mankind.

LTHOUGH the tremendous world increase in the use 
of water has taken scientists by surprise, they are 
“confident that future water needs can be fully met. With wider

should have no difficulty in quickly making up for lost time. 
Apart from the water reserves in the world's rivers, lakes and

Tools of today's water detective:

removed from the deserts; they are “strangers” to the 
places where they bring the greatest benefit. By using 
local water man has also farmed desert and semi-arid 
areas In places far beyond the areas watered by these 
“stranger rivers. I am sure that if a proper study 
were made of all the traditional methods employed by 
the desert peoples to obtaln and make use of water, and 
if modern science and engineering were applied to per- 
fect these methods, many water supply difficulties would 
be overcome. This would give temporary rellef until 
such times as cheap ways of pumping underground water 
and of demineralizing and purifying surface waters (and 
of using them several times over) are Introduced. 
The underground waters In some of the Transcaspian 
deserts for Instance are all highly mineralized; yet from 
far-off times man has successfully bred livestock In these 
deserts. He solved his problem In two ways: by artificially 
creating fresh subsoil water and by glving cattle and 
sheep saline water to drink. 
‘PIPELINES’ 
FROM 
THE PAST 
Fresh subsoil water formed by the Infiltration of rain 
from the catchment basin has been utilized since anclent 
days. At the end of the nineteenth century engineers 
began to use a method of regulating water resources by 
the artificial replenishment of subsoil waters. Desert 
peoples, however, had actually been using similar methods 
for centuries. 
Such techniques, of course, are only practicable when 
there are sufficient rains, an extensive catchment basin, 
a high run-off from the surface and suitable geological 
conditions for the accumulation of subsoil waters. An 
annual rainfall of 80 mm. of which half should be 
concentrated in two or three months, has been found 
sufficient. 
Even In a desert with claylsh soil the run-off only 
accounts for: between 1/10th and 1/5th of the 
of the total rainfall. However, the use of synthetic 
substances to form artificlal drainage areas should pro- 
duce a higher rate of run-off. Other methods to assist 
Long lines of giant “mole hills” running cross the countryside in Iran (below) mark the route 
of underground galleries called “kanats” (also spelt “ganat” and “ghanat”). Pockets of water 
that collect underground at the foot of the mountains are tapped and flow along these tunnels, 
sometimes for many miles, to crop-growing areas. The “mole hills” mark the site of vertical 
shafts through which earth was excavated during tunnelling operations, and which now provide 
ventilation. Kanats were first developed in Iran some 3,000 years ago and their immense net- 
work made possible the economic prosperity on which the power of the Persian Empires of 
antiquity was founded. Without the kanats, cities like Teheran, Tabriz and Chiraz would probably 
never have existed. Today more than 30,000 kanats are still used in Iran, mostly for irrigation.

Beneath most land areas of the world there is a zone where the pores 
of rocks and sediments are completely saturated with water. Hydrologists 
call this “ground water”, and the upper limit of the saturated zone is called 
the “water table”. They are now studying how to detect and make 
use of the deep layers of water and also how to avoid exhausting them.

LEGENDS OF THE SPRINGS 
The peoples of the ancient world 
saw no particular relationship be- 
tween rain or storms and the under- 
ground water in wells and hill-side 
springs. “The waters of the ocean 
penetrate deep into the earth under 
wind-pressure and rise to feed the 
springs thanks to gravity, which com- 
presses the rocks”, said the Greek 
philosopher and astronomer, Thales 
of Miletus, in the 7th century B.C. 
Plato also thought that water reaching 
the surface came originally from the 
ocean, through a deep abyss descend- 
ing to the centre of the earth. “My 
observations”, said Seneca, “show that 
rainfall cannot explain the formation 
of springs, for it can penetrate only a 
little way into the ground whereas 
it is evident that springs sometimes 
originate at great depths... rain is never 
sufficiently strong or continuous to 
sink more than ten feet into the 
ground.” It was only in the 16th cen- 
tury that science began to offer expla- 
nations moreakinto present-day views. 
the replenishment of subsoil waters will also have to be 
used until anti-evaporation substances that effectively 
retain fresh water have been devised. These substances 
will be most effective if used In small basins where there 
is no disturbance of the water. 
Because rainwater provides only a minimum water 
supply the desert herdsmen have had to train their stock 
to drink salt water. Some valuable animals—camels and 
caracul sheep, for Instance—drink water with a salt 
content of from 10 to 12 or even from 15 to.16 grammes 
per litre, gain weight regularly and breed normally. 
There is no reason why similar uses should not be made 
of such water in other areas. 
ECENTLY much has been written about the 
use of heavily saline water for Irrigation; and 
many international symposia have been devoted to this 
important problem. It is even proposed to use water with 
as much salinity as seawater (35 grammes per litre) to irri- 
gate farmlands. In my opinion, attention should first 
be paid to the development of reliable methods for the 
irrigation of a variety of crops using water with a salt 
content of 10 to 15 grammes per litre. This would be of 
great economic value and would bring new life to very 
extensive regions. 
Desert dwellers get water from great depths by digging 
wells. I once saw a well 880 feet deep made by a man 
who could nelther read nor write. In the desert and 
arid regions wells over 300 feet deep are not a rarity. 
One of the most remarkable devices for getting water In 
the desert is the underground tunnel or gallery known by 
different names—klariz, kanat, fogghza, etc.—in different 
lands. But whatever the name, the principle is always 
the same, 
Iran offers the best examples of the kanat technique. 
It is hardly likely that anybody has ever counted all the 
existing tunnels, but there are sald to be some 30,000, 
Many thousands of communities, large and small, in an 
area stretching from North-West Africa to the eastern 
extremes of Central Asia, rely on kanat water for all 
their needs, expecially for irrigation. The total length 
of these tunnels Is probably over 300,000 miles. Even 
if this flgure 1s not entirely accurate, the wealth of 
tunnels shows what a gigantic and laborious task was 
performed by the people of these arid regions in their 
search for water. 
In the kanat or kiariz technique the water is collected 
underground in hilly areas and is brought through long 
tunnels by the force of gravity until it reaches ground 
level In lower-lying areas. The extensive networks of 
kanat tunnels in places where nothing on the surface 
reveals the presence of ground water are a trlbute to 
the creative genius of the desert peoples. Today, in 
regions where electricity 1s too scarce to be used for 
raising water, the kanat would certainly prove its worth. 
Kanats can also be combined with drilled wells to 
Increase the water intake. 
HE search for fresh ground water in the 
deserts 1s of first-rate Importance and 
although initial prospecting costs are high they are usually 
justified by the results. Western Turkmenistan for ins- 
tance, a big Industrial area with oll wells, railways, towns 
and ports, relies entirely on subsoil water drawn from the 
“waterless desert”. This still-developing area will continue 
its economic expansion with the help of underground 
water. 
In the desert regions of the U.S.S.R. a new method of 
locating fresh water has been developed. This is a

of the lower depths 
variation of the already widely-employed radlo-pros- 
pecting technique of geophysics. Radio waves reflected 
from the surface of the underground water (the angle of 
reflection varying according to its salinity) are picked 
up by an alrcraft flying overhead. Engineers are thus 
able to find concentrations of underground water and 
assess the water resources of wide areas rapidly and 
effectively. There are great possibilities for further deve- 
lopment in thls technique. 
It is obvious that economical ways of assessing the 
amount of underground water contained In such aquifers 
must now be found. The various electrical prospecting 
methods now being used reduce well drilling to a minli- 
mum, but these methods can only be used to locate 
water concentrations relatively close to the surface. 
Desert geographical conditions have a direct influence 
on many characteristics of the upper layers of under- 
ground waters, especially their high salinity; but they 
probably have no effect at greater depths. Thus in the 
desert, as elsewhere, there may be both fresh and mine- 
ralized waters at great depths. 
If the desert is close to a mountainous region in which 
rainfall Is plentiful in an otherwise arld zone, the moun- 
tains with their bare slopes and sparse vegetation will 
supply water to replenish the underground waters of the 
desert lowlands. Some examples are the huge artesian 
basins adjoining the Tian Shan mountains in Central 
Asla, the Altal mountains of southern Siberia and Mon- 
golia, and the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. 
F local water resources are to be used for the 
further reclamatlon of the deserts, their 
development will depend on our learning far more about 
the lower geological strata than we know today. 
Until 1940, engineers considered that detalled topo- 
graphical and geological charts were Indispensable as 
guides to the test drilling that precedes more compre- 
hensive studies and the actual construction of water- 
raising installations. To produce such charts takes a 
great deal of time and money and today simpler methods 
may be used. 
Aerial photographs enable sclentists to divide the 
earth's surface into its natural divisions and determine 
the most likely distribution of the upper layers of under- 
ground water. The general distribution pattern of deeper 
waters may be gauged from geological structure charts 
similar to those used by oll prospectors. 
The ollman first looks for geological structures where 
oil Is likely to accumulate and when he has found them 
he begins looking for the oil itself. Using the same 
technique the water prospector will probably meet with 
greater success, for there is water In all permeable rocks. 
Charts of this type can be compiled from regional selsmlic 
and gravimetric data. More precise information can 
then be obtained by any of the various electrical

A.P.N. 
Water galore — if we're wise 
prospecting methods; if this plan is used the amount of 
test drilling is greatly reduced and the data obtained 
shows the filtration properties of the area selected and 
the degree of salinity of the water. 
Some major problems, however, still remain. How 
much water Is available ? What indications are there to 
warrant further large-scale prospecting and an assess- 
ment of quality? This aspect of the work is the most 
dif’lcult and the most expensive; it is here that science 
must provide new methods of investigation that will 
radically change the situation. 
We possess simple and cheap methods of estimating 
atmospheric precipitation and surface run-off. It Is 
not difficult, for instance, to calculate the approximate 
rainfall over an area with a given geological structure, 
and to assess the amount of water that has escaped 
beyond the boundaries of that area. We cannot, however, 
say how much of the water has gone to replenish under- 
ground water because we have no cheap and reliable 
methods of measuring Infiltration and evaporation over 
large (or even small) areas. 
HE present gap between scientific knowledge 
and the needs of man should soon be closed. 
We shall then be able to use the balance method (the 
ratio of water runoff to rainfall) to assess the amount 
of water in each geological zone that goes to replenish 
underground water. Thus we shall have more precise 
knowledge about the water resources on which prospect- 
ing and other search methods should be used. Scientists 
maintain that the water-balance method can become a 
universal technique of assessing water resources. But this

### 62166: The Thirstless camel

### 62141: Underground water, a wasted treasure

S everyone knows, there are two 
living species of camels: the larger, 
one-humped dromedary of North Africa 
and Arabia; and the two-humped, hairier 
Bactrian camel of central Asia. These 
are geographically widely separated from 
their nearest relatives, the llamas of 
South America. Many kinds of fossil 
animals of the camel type, however, are 
known from Europe and North America, 
showing that at one time they were a 
common and widely distributed group of 
grazing animals. . Our present camels 
and llamas, then, are relics surviving 
from the geological past. Why they sur- 
vived, or why all of the others became 
extinct, is anyone's guess. 
0: can argue as to whether any of 
the present-day camels are truly 
wild. Or on the contrary, one can main- 
tain that no camels are truly domesticated. 
The latter line of reasoning, used by many 
people experienced with camels, is that 
camels are simply stupid enough to allow 
men to use them—up to certain limits. 
The stories of camel stupidity and obsti- 
nacy are endless enough, and maybe it 
was this low 1.Q. that led to their extinc- 
tion in all parts of the world where no 
one bothered to look after them. There 
are, to be sure, herds of two-humped 
Bactrian camels wandering over the 
. plains of central Asia, but these wild 
animals look no different from those 
raised by men, and the two interbreed 
freely. In the case of the African dro- 
medaries, any apparently wild animals are 
supposed simply to have wandered off 
from some camp or caravan. 
Stupid or not, camels have been very 
useful to the peoples of the Old World 
desert areas, carrying considerable loads 
for days across waterless terrain. How 
if an extensive network of observation stations is set up, 
well equipped with automatic apparatus. The forth- 
large a load they can carry, and how 
many days they can go without water, 
depend on who is telling the story—and 
probably also on the camel and on the 
weather conditions. Camel facts are 
scarce, which is what led Knut Schmidt- 
Nielsen to study their physiology. 
Schmidt-Nielsen [a Norwegian scientist, 
working with a subvention from Unesco— 
see “The Camel, Facts and Fables”, 
Unesco Courier, N° 8-9, 1955] found that 
in the cool winter months in North Africa, 
grazing camels were not watered at all; 
they got all of the water they needed from 
the plants they ate. He decided to see 
what would happen if a camel were put 
on a very dry diet; for this purpose he 
tried thoroughly dried dates stuffed with 
peanuts. Camels, it developed, do not 
take to new food easily, but he finally 
got one animal to eat this diet, until the 
oasis where he was conducting the 
experiment ran out of peanuts. It turned 
out that in cool weather a camel could go 
for several weeks without drinking even 
on this dry food, but it steadily lost 
weight. Camels, Schmidt-Nielsen disco- 
vered, could lose up to 25 per cent of 
their body weight without apparent ill 
effect. When offered water, however, 
they would rapidly drink enough to bring 
their weight back to normal: one animal 
drank twenty-seven gallons of water in 
ten minutes. 
The water is not stored in any parti- 
cular place—not in the hump, which is 
pure fat, nor in the stomach, though this 
always has digestive juices. Like the 
kangaroo rat, the camel manages by 
being very economical in its use of 
water. The urine is highly concentrated, 
and sweating is greatly reduced. Camels

maintain a steady body temperature. On

is needed to ensure practically unlimited supplies of water 
starts; during the cold night body tempe- 
rature drops, so that it may be as low 
as 93 degrees F. at dawn, which gives 
the animal a head start in meeting the 
heat problems of the day. Body tempe- 
rature fluctuations, however, are much 
smaller in the case of animals with free 
access to water, The camel's hairy coat 
also serves as insulation against the 
heat of the day, an animal that was 
shaved produced 60 per cent more sweat 
to control body temperature than animals 
with normal protective hair covering. 
ONKEYS are also fairly successful 
animals in dry country, and Schmidt- 
Nielsen decided to compare them with 
camels. He found that under similar 
conditions, a camel could go for seven- 
teen days without drinking, a donkey for 
only four days. The donkey maintained 
a much more constant body temperature 
and had to use sweat for this. Both 
could lose up to 25 per cent of the body 
weight, but the donkey could get it back 
much faster by drinking—in two minutes 
instead of the camel's ten. It would 
take a man several hours to drink an 
amount of water equivalent to a quarter 
of his body weight. Marston Bates

All that 
~ coming International Hydrological Decade should help 
solve this problem. 
There is a saying “Great oaks from little acorns grow”. 
Care of water is one of the little things that can prevent 
a great disaster; in the arid areas the upper level of 
underground water is often polluted through the wells, 
and if the flow of water from artesian wells Is not regu- 
lated by stopcocks much of the water is wasted. 
In terms of waste, the chief water user, irrigation, is 
also the chief water waster. In many countries a huge 
amount of water from main canals and irrigation systems 
is used unproductively; more is wasted in the fields and 
reservoirs. The greater part of this lost water flows to 
the underground waters and raises their level, producing 
secondary mineralization and bogs. Thus, not only is 
fresh water lost; it reappears as an enemy. The uni- 
versal introduction of scientific principles and technical 
improvements into irrigation are an essential condition 
for the conservation of surface and underground waters 
in those areas where water is scarce. 
is a wise and rational approach to the problem and to 
the use of all types of water resources. The long-term 
prospects for water seem promising. They undoubt- 
edly will be if we are able to use most of the water 
circulating in the land part of the globe and to reduce 
the amount of fresh water flowing into the ocean. The 
evaporation from the surface of the ocean will not be 
noticeably reduced and the total rainfall on the land 
surface will remain at approximately its present level 
Fresh-water resources will thus be considerably increased.

Detergents have become one of the chief agents of water pollution. At locks and weirs where water is troubled, the 
detergents are whipped up into masses of foaming suds like those above, near the locks on the River Seine at Mericourt, 
between Rouen and Paris. Below, waters of the Rhine polluted with oil wastes. Even one thirtieth of an ounce of 
oil products can make 200 gallons of water sufficiently poisonous to kill aquatic life and also unfit for domestic uses. 
Sarvice de la Navigation

A NEW CULPRIT : DETERGENT SOAPS 
24 
Studies have shown that the worst 
agents of pollution are the world's 
big cities with their huge output of 
sewage water. The greatest offenders 
are of course those capital cities 
which have been built on the banks 
of rivers. 
* 
In recent years the use of detergents 
in the home and in factories has in- 
creased tremendously, and the results 
can be seen in rivers and lakes in 
which the presence of detergent pro- 
ducts is revealed by masses of foam. 
This is formed when even a minute 
quantity of detergent is present in the 
water. 
The products which make dishwash- 
ing and the laundry so easy are 
poisonous for aquatic animal and 
plant life. Water plants turn brown 
and lose their leaves when water is 
invaded by even a microscopic 
amount of detergent. Slightly higher 
concentrations kill off the tiny water 
animals which form the foodstocks for 
many fishes, and even tiny fish them- 
selves. 
Detergent manufacturers are trying 
to reduce the amount of foam produced 
which inconveniences industry just as 
much as the housewife with her wash- 
ing machine. 
But sanitary engineers are worried 
by the appearance on the market of 
detergents which produce little or no 
foam. Though the evidence of pollution 
will be reduced, the toxic effect of the 
detergents will in no way be lowered. 
* 
The water in lakes and rivers is 
only renewed very gradually by the 
cycle of nature and this is an im- 
portant reason for stepping up the 
battle against pollution. 
The waters of Lake Constance, on 
the frontiers of Germany, Switzerland 
and Austria, are renewed every four 
and a half years. But as water does 
not flow into the Rhine from every 
part of the lake the complete renewal 
of the waters may take even longer. 
x 
Water pollution costs the United 
States over one thousand million 
dollars every year. An effective 
campaign against water pollution 
might cost as much as 600 million 
dollars, but this would still leave an 
overall saving of 400 million dollars.

RIVER POLLUTION (Cont'd) 
Waters that die a slow death 
the Seine were crystal clear and from the bridges a passer-by could see the fish 
swimming between the stones and the green plants carpeting the river bed. 
In London, at the turn of the 17th century it is reported that between sessions of 
Parliament, one of the pastimes of the honorable members was to fish for salmon In the 
Thames. 
Gradually, the waste disposal networks expanded, and at the same time as towns organized 
the collection of domestic garbage they also arranged for the systematic discharge of 
waste and cess waters into rivers. 
The spread of the “sewage system”, combined with the progressive use of sanitary equip- 
ment—lavatories, bathrooms, washing machines, etc—has consequently sent all waste 
waters into the rivers where, thanks to the Introduction of refuse-grinding devices in the 
home, they may soon be joined by much of our domestic garbage. 
Any increase in urban population causes a corresponding rise In Industrial production. 
And, as industry develops and production processes grow more complex, water consumption 
increases at an even faster rate than population growth itself. 
While, in the developing countries, the total annual consumption of water per head is 
between 200 and 260 cubic yards, nations with industrialized economies are already using 
- between 650 and 800 cubic yards of water for all purposes and today the annual per 
capita consumption in the United States Is nearly 2,000 cubic yards—a figure which Is 
expected to rise to over 2,600 cubic yards within the next 40 years. 
Much, if not all, of this water is discharged with all kinds of polluting elements In it: viruses, 
microbes, organic matter, floating particles. 
Once the mass of pollution discharged into a river exceeds a certain amount the river Is 
no longer able to destroy it. All animal and vegetable life disappears. The river is trans- 
formed into an open sewer: it dies. 
] HIS has been the case just outside Paris where, in certain years, the Seine 
has flowed downstream as a mixture of half water, half sewage. 
So, when we add up all the possible sources of pollution—industrial waste in the form 
of chemical products, toxic elements, particles that give water an unpleasant taste, oil 
discharged by shipping and the increasing quantity of detergents—it Is easy to understand 
how river water becomes unsafe, not only for drinking but even for industrial use. This 
situation has coincided with an increase in demands for good quality water, and when towns, 
finding underground water sources insufficient to meet these demands, have been compelled 
to turn to rivers for their drinking water. 
The case of Paris is typical of many large cities. During the 19th century, spring water was 
brought into the capital via aqueducts which, for the time, were models of hydrological 
design and engineering. Until the early part of the 20th century, Paris managed with the 
water that came through these ducts from 60 and even 120 miles away. But the day came 
when Paris was obliged to introduce into its supply network water from the Seine, which 
up to then had been used only by industry. Full precautions were taken by slow filtering 
and then sterilizing. This was originally intended to be merely a reserve supply for the 
summer, a time when water sources diminished while consumption increased. But the needs 
of the capital quickly grew; buildings were modernized, new urban areas were being 
developed and the suburban population was increasing all the time. 
Since there was no room to extend the filters or build new ones, the only way to treat the 
increased supply was by introducing stronger purification techniques: chlorination and ozonli- 
zation. The quantity of water from the Seine and the Marne supplied to Parisian homes thus 
gradually increased, while that of spring water remained virtually the same. 
A few years ago the low-water period of the Seine coincided with a marked drop in the 
spring supply. This created a critical situation and almost caused a breakdown in the Paris 
water supply. In the suburbs water was distributed by water tankers and In some places 
was sold in large bottles and even by the litre. 
On one occasion Parisians complained bitterly about the Seine water they were drinking 
because of traces of chlorophenol which were produced by the combined effect of chlorine 
used for purification and phenol discharged into the river by a factory. This problem was 
overcome by using chlorine dioxide and by stopping the factory from discharging any more 
phenol into the Seine.

Six million tons of filth 
On another occasion an abundance of microscopic water plants in a tributary of the Marne 
again affected the taste of the water and also seriously hindered the fuctioning of the filters. 
Though in every case purification measures were taken, the people of Paris lost confi- 
dence In their water supply and the sales of mineral water and bottled table waters soared. 
At the recent Congress on Hygiene held at the Pasteur Institute in Paris the quality of the 
city's drinking water was again strongly criticized and plans were put forward for the 
construction of a new supply network to provide drinking water of exceptionally high quality. 
This would meet a daily need of five or six litres per person and would provide for other 
purposes water free from harmful bacteria but possibly unpleasant to drink. 
Quite understandably, these proposals were considered Utopian by the specialists at the 
Congress, who finally voted for a system that would provide a single quality of water— 
the best. Such examples illustrate the water supply difficulties which all towns are up against 
today. 
Q ovens situations become so critical that towns have to consider regene- 
rating part of their used water so that it can be reintroduced into the supply 
network after being treated or purified naturally. : 
This recycling is already practised in some industries whose water supply is inadequate 
and in some cases such water is recycled nearly 100%. In industry as in public utilities, 
however, this technique is limited by the increase in the amount of dissolved salts. Care 
must be taken to ensure that the limits laid down in nearly every country regarding the salt 
content of drinking water are not overstepped, and that strict standards of water cleanliness 
are maintained. 
It is here that new methods currently being studied and applied for removing salt from 
sea water and brackish water so as to help supply arid regions can be used. The use of integral 
regeneration processes contemplated for space travel is also being studied. 
We know that some underground water sources have still to be prospected and a better 
distribution of water resources, with dams and intercommunicating channels between river 
basins, would satisfy growing needs for some time to come. 
Few people realize, for instance, that water flowing in all French rivers totals over 
220,000 million cubic yards a year, of which only between 26,000 and 32,000 million cubic 
yards are actually used by man? From the Loire basin alone about 13,000 million cubic 
yards flow unused to the sea each year. 
But obviously the battle against pollution ‘is still a vital and urgent task. Some countries 
have already realized this and have introduced regulations and taken firm action to combat the 
disastrous effects of pollution. 
T HERE are, for instance, institutions in the Federal Republic of Germany which 
contro! the water administration in the Ruhr : “Emscher Genossenschaft,” 
“Ruhrverband”, etc. The work of the English “River Boards” has quite recently been taken 
over by the newly-formed “Water Authorities.” In Belgium, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. rivers 
have been surveyed and classed according to their state of pollution and in France a bill has 
been presented to Parliament, which provides not only for the classification of surface waters 
according to their degree of pollution but also for the setting up of public boards, which, in the 
worst zones, will help solve the overall problems of water supply and assist in combating 
pollution. 
In the meantime the French Water Commission (founded in 1959) which actually drew up 
the Parliamentary bill, has established administrative machinery which will help all regions in 
France to carry out the enormous task of meeting the demands of a rapidly growing population 
and industry. : 
More than 20 million French town dwellers—and many people in rural areas—discard their 
waste directly into rivers without any purification process. The annual flow of French rivers 
carries with it 7,000 million cubic yards of filthy water containing polluted matter which would 
fill 10,000 trains carrying 600 tons each. 
To this must be added the drainage from farm lands which have been treated with chemical 
26 fertilizers and insecticides, the hydrocarbons from boats and oil tankers which add to river 
pollution, the detergents, the rise in river temperatures caused by the discharge of cooling 
water from factories, and the growth of minute aquatic plants due to an increase of “nutritive

At a time when ever greater use is being made of rivers and lakes for sailing, bathing, water ski-ing (above) and other aquatic 
sports, our waterways are also becoming increasingly polluted with the waste products of densely populated and industrialized 
areas. It is neither pleasant nor beneficial to go sailing or swimming in polluted water or to walk on river banks that are 
clogged with dirt and silt. And there are growing complaints from anglers in many places that their sport is being ruined.

salts" of phosphorus and nitrogen found in the water. The final picture of pollution is 
one which, at some periods and in some areas, has well nigh reached saturation point. 
Similar situations are found in other countries, even where regulations have been introduced 
and public works carried out. Despite such measures these countries are losing the battle 
against pollution because the costs are more than they can afford. 
To “clean up” river water in France and comply with current regulations would cost 
between £ 576 million and £1,152 million. And to maintain a satisfactory quality of water the 
annuel cost of water purification and protection would probably be between £14 million and 
£28 million that is, between 0.15% and 0.3% of the French national revenue. 
In most countries the price paid for water by the consumer is much lower than its real 
value. The revenue from water charges often fails to cover the cost of supply, let alone to 
finance research into new resources or to promote purification of used water. 
The time has now come to apply moderate increases to water supply rates and taxes and 
thereby maintain the quality of what is, after all, a precious element of wealth and prosperity. 
Perhaps too the moment has come to affirm that water is an asset belonging to all men 
which no individual has any longer the right to use as he pleases, and that it must be protected 
as the most vital of our natural bounties.

### 62145: Where we stand with water desalting

WHERE WE STAND WITH 
WATER DESALTING 
by Ronald S. Fenton 
W = water everywhere, nor any drop to 
drink.” The words of the Ancient Mariner 
in Coleridge's famous poem evoke the feelings of many 
a shipwrecked seafarer, adrift in the immensity of the 
ocean, but unable to slake hls thirst. 
Covering three-quarters of the surface of the globe, 
the oceans contain practically all the world’s water 
supply, but In a form so heavily impregnated with all the 
minerals that have been washed out of the land that it 
would be fatal to drink it in anything like the quantities 
normally required by the human body. Human beings 
only survive because a very small fraction of ocean water 
dally changes its form by natural processes and moves 
to places where men, animals and plants can use it. 
If only ocean water could cheaply be separated from 
its salts and brought to places where fresh water Is 
desperately needed, some of man’s most pressing prob- 
lems would be solved. Arid lands would be relieved 
from the fear of drought and in economically-developed 
lands the threat of water shortages due to population and 
Industrial growth would be a thing of the past. 
Conversion of sea or brackish water to fresh is not a 
new idea. For many centuries man has known how to 
do it; just boll the sea water and condense the resulting 
vapour. The basic method Is as old as history. Starting 
with the Anclent Greeks, sailors have been distilling sea- 
water in this way for over 2,000 years. Even primitive 
man desalted water, but in this case by evaporating the 
water to obtain the salt. 
Wider application of distillation came with the advent 
of the steamship and its requirement of fresh water for 
bollers. Since then shipping owners have found that 
distilling sea-water is generally much cheaper than 
setting aside cargo or passenger space to store it; the 
difference In costs can amount to $45,000 a year for a 
medium-sized tanker. 
Diu ocean water is thus no longer a 
problem on board ships and Is now common 
practice. Its real significance today is for the relief of 
water shortages on land. That is why scientists and 
engineers are searching for more efficient and economical 
ways of converting water from the world’s greatest, 
cheapest natural resource—the oceans—and from vast 
reserves of inland brackish water, into water fit for use 
in the home and by industry. 
The technique of desalting ls already well advanced. 
Widely-scattered land based plants now in operation have 
a total estimated daily production capacity of about 
40 million gallons. But this is still only a “drop in the 
ocean” —it is no more than would satisfy the water needs 
of an American industrial city of 350,000 people. 
The reason is that only special economic and geogra- 
phical situations have so far justified the setting up of 
large desalting plants. One example is Kuwait, on the 
Persian Gulf, where vast petroleum resources began to be 
developed on a glant scale about 15 years ago. At that 
time water had to be Imported by tanker at exorbitant 
cost. Since then a series of large-scale water distilleries 
has been built, fueled by natural gas and oil. Today 
these plants produce well over 10 million gallons a day. 
Yet although the fuel is virtually free, the water is not 
cheap compared with the cost of supplylng water in 
many other parts of the world. But for Kuwalt desalting 
water was cheaper than importing it. 
Normally, the costs of providing water—In areas lucky 
enough to be endowed with a good, natural supply—are 
much lower than for any other commodity on earth, 
Thus, water supplled by desalting processes will only 
become competitive with water from conventional sources 
when technological improvements have Increased the 
efficiency of these processes and brought down the baslc 
costs of production. 
1 HE stumbling block in the use of distillation 
to make the oceans supply the water needs 
of Industry Is the cost of providing the large amounts 
of energy needed for the conversion processes. 
There are already encouraging signs, however, that the 
gap between the cost of water produced by desalting and 
water from conventional sources Is closing up. Since 
1951 intensive research and development in the United 
States have brought down desalting production costs, 
even in pllot demonstration plants, from $5.00 per 1,000 
gallons to between $1.40 and $1.00, as compared with an 
average cost of $0.40 for municipal water delivered to the 
public. At the same time conventional water costs have 
been climbing slowly, thus further closing the gap. Some 
specialists maintain that within the next decade or so 
further technological improvements may reduce the cost 
of desalted water to between £0.40 and ¥%0.60 per 1,000 
gallons. 
The important programme of research and develop- 
ment in the United States which produced these lower 
cost conversion results was Initiated in 1952 by the 
Office of Saline Water. This U.S. agency was establish- 
ed by the Department of the Interior to “develop new 
or Improved conversion processes . . , conduct research 
and technical development . . to make engineering 
studies to ascertain the lowest Investment and operat- 
ing costs and to determine the best plant designs and 
conditions of operations.” 
Since then it has been attacking these problems with 
the help of demonstration plants erected in Freeport, 
Texas and San Diego, California (both with a dally pro- 
" duction capacity of one million gallons) and at Webster, 
South Dakota. Other demonstration plants are being 
built in North Carolina and New Mexico. All five employ 
different techniques for desalting water. The U.S. saline 
water conversion programme Is certainly the most exten- 
sive In operation today. 
Another achlevement in the campaign to reduce produc- 
tion costs comes from the Island of Aruba in the Carib- 
bean. Here, a large distilling plant has been combined 
with a thermal power station. Steam passes through 
the turbines to generate electricity and Is then used 
to heat the sea water. About half the water produced 
on Aruba is used by an oll refinery, and the remainder 
is the sole source of supply for some 54,000 people on 
this completely waterless island. 
Another place where it has been found worthwhile to 
set up a sea-water distillation plant is Guernsey, an 
island in the English Channel. Ordinarily Guernsey gets 
enough rain to produce a bumper crop of tomatoes on

Squeezing molecules 
which its economy largely depends. But about once In 
every eight years a drought occurs at a critical time and 
the tomato crop falls. When the Islanders found that 
for the price of crop insurance premiums they could have 
a desalting plant, they built one with a capacity of 
500,000 gallons a day. Though it will not be used very 
often, It represents an investment in a cheap form of 
crop insurance. 
Until recent times seagoing distillation plants were 
simple contraptions in which sait water was boiled in a 
kettle atop which was attached a colled metal tube that 
trapped the steam and condensed It to a trickle of tresh 
water. Modern water stills are vastly more complex— 
and more efficient. Most of the heat applied to water at 
one stage is recaptured and transferred to the next stage 
to vaporize more water. 
But the chief problem is still the high cost of power. 
Can atomic energy offer a solution? Some scientists 
now maintain that with further research it will be 
possible to combine the production of electricity and the 
conversion of ocean water in giant atomic power plants 
and thereby produce both electric power and fresh water 
at costs well below today's figures. 
These sclentists have calculated that water can be pro- 
duced for about $0.25 per 1,000 gallons in plants delivering 
1,000 million gallons of fresh water dally. They main- 
taln that even this low cost could be further reduced 
through the use of breeder reactors which differ from 
present conventional atomic reactors in that they 
Herally breed or create addltional fuel supplies as a by- 
product. 
Distillation, of course, is only one of many methods 
now known for desalting water and, in terms of present 
knowledge and experience, it is so far the most efficlent 
and widely-used process. Distillation plants produce 
very pure water: less than ten parts of salts for one 
million parts of water. It makes little difference in cost 
whether the process starts with sea-water (35,000 parts 
per, million) or brackish water (1,000 to 10,000 parts per 
million). 
The costs of an entirely different type of desalting 
process known as electrodialysis, however, vary with the 
salt content of water. In electrodialysis the energy 
consumed is proportional to the amount of salts remov- 
ed. Thus, where the need is to make brackish water fit 
for human needs it has a basic advantage over distllla- 
tion, Little energy is needed to purify brackish water 
(typically about 2,000 parts of salts per million) to a level 
rT RRR RK Ge TT SERRE TRA Re 
  
  
through plastic pores 
that meets public health standards for drinking water 
(500 parts per million in the U.S.A). 
Electrodialysis depends on plastic membranes that act 
somewhat like chemical sieves. This is how they work 
in the case of the common salt found in sea-water. Each 
molecule of salt is composed of one atom of sodium and 
one of chloride. When salt 1s dissolved in water it splits 
into two particles called ions—one a negatively charged. 
atom of chloride and the other a positively charged 
atom of sodium. In electrodialysis the electric current 
causes the two kinds of ions to flow in opposite direc- 
tions through banks of plastic membranes forming a 
serles of compartments. The process leaves less salty, 
though not entirely purified, water in one compartment 
and more salty in the next, and so on down the entire 
bank of membranes. 
The amount of salts retained in the water can be 
adjusted as required—to the level needed in drinking 
water, for instance. (Water produced by distillation is 
unpalatable because nearly all the salts have been re- 
moved.) Many commercial plants use electrodialysis and 
countries which have set up such plants include Israel, 
Japa, the Netherlands, the Soviet Unlon and South 
Africa. 
A ore promising method on which research 
is now being pursued is the desalting of sea- 
water by freezing. The first ice that forms when sea- 
water freezes contains practically no salt and can be 
melted down into fresh water. Freezing has two big 
advantages over distillation: less energy is required: to 
freeze water than to vaporize it; there is no formation 
of mineral deposits on equipment as is the case when high 
temperatures are used. Offsetting these advantages are 
the need for expensive mechanical equipment to handle 
ice by the carload and the difficulty of eliminating the 
salt water and brine which tend to cling to the crystals 
of frozen fresh water. A good deal of the fresh water 
produced has to be used for washing the crystals. But 
the stage has now been reached where demonstration 
plants have been built and are operating on an experi- 
‘mental basis. 
Among all the methods of desalting the simplest is 
distillation by the heat of the sun. Its chief attraction 
is” that it makes use of energy supplied absolutely free 
of charge. The apparatus used is simple and relatively 
inexpensive to build. The typlcal solar still consists of 
a trough of salt water beneath a slanting roof of glass 
or clear plastic. The water slowly evaporates, condenses 
‘HARD’ WATER IN 
THE FAR NORTH 
In the Far North Eskimo wives keep their 
stocks of drinking water as blocks of 
solid ice piled up in the open air (left). 
When only sea water is available this 
can be frozen to remove the salt—a 
method employed in the Arctic seaboard 
areas of several regions. Shallow basins 
are filled with six inches of sea- 
water and when the salty water has 
frozen to a depth of just over half an 
inch, the ice is collected and the brine 
beneath poured away (the first ice that 
forms when sea-water freezes contains 
practically no salt). Plants which desalt 
sea-water by freezing are now being 
used experimentally in several countries.

BONNEVILLE SALT 
FLATS in the United 
States stretch for miles 
acrossthe northwestcor- 
ner of the state of Utah. 
Today, an unbroken 
line of telegraph poles

and roaring motor cars 
set world speed records 
on this natural race 
course. Bonneville Salt

vast fresh-water lake 
that covered over 20,000 
square miles in this 
area between 10,000

mer lake bottom, and

ly dissolving salts from 
rocks, have left evapo-

on the under side of the roof, and trickles down into.a 
gutter. Solar distillation plants are naturally of the 
greatest value to areas that are not only rich in sunshine 
and poor in other fuels, but also where land space 1s not 
_ at a premium. They take up a-lot of space if used for 
large-scale desalting and U.S. engineers have estimated 
that an installation covering 40 acres would be needed 
. to irrigate 120 acres of farm land. 
While electrodialysis and distillation have already 
proved their worth and freezing shows progressively en- 
couraging results, scientists and engineers are investigat- 
ing at least a dozen other desalting processes. One new 
line of research concerns the use of plastic membranes 
of a somewhat different type from those used in electro- 
dialysis. In this process the membranes simply strain 
salt lons from sea-water. The pressure of a powerful 
pump squeezes the water molecules through the mem- 
brane pores, leaving the salt behind. 
Those working on desalting research do not anticipate 
anything approaching an immediate major advance that 
would revolutionize development in their field. They are 
up against the hard fact that taking salt out of water 
has much In common wlth oll-refining: both involve 
chemical separations that demand much energy and 
expensive equipment. 
Nevertheless, present research promises to lead to 
significant economies that will expand the potential use 
of desalted water. Development of cheaper or long- 
lasting membranes would cut the cost of electrodialysis. 
New methods for controlling boller scale—the hard 
coating of mineral deposits that tends to be deposited on 
hot metal surfaces by sea or brackish water—would lead 
to Increased efficlency in all distillation processes. 
Engineers are also trying to galn more efficiency oy In- 
genlous combinations of different processes. 
Each new Installation results in some improvement and 
paves the way for more efficlent operation. The expe- 
rlences with new and larger plants coupled with continu- 
ed research efforts should hasten the day when more 
of the world's people with no reasonable source of tresh 
water may have access to the benefits of high-quality 
water produced by desalting plants.

### 62147: Rivers of international concord

  
RIVERS OF 
  
INTERNATIONAL 
CONCORD 
UU: fifty years ago man tended to manage 
streams, great and small, for a single purpose 
affecting only a small area. True, a few ancient river 
structures in China and Iran served the joint purposes 
of mechanical water power and Irrigation or of flood 
control and navigation, but by and large construction 
was for a single purpose. 
Shortly after the turn of the century the idea of inter- 
grated development of streams found currency in plans 
for individual water basins. The technology of moving 
carth cheaply in great quantities, of building with 
concrete, and of transmitting electricity long distances 
made this possible. 
One aspect of the idea was to manage water for several 
purposes at the same place. The thirteen new dams on 
the Volga River, for example, serve not only to store water 
for navigation and for urban water supply, but generate 
huge blocks of hydro-electric power. The great new 
dam rising on the Lower Volta River in Ghana will not 
only provide for navigation facilities downstream but will 
generate power on which an alumium industry will be 
based. 
by Gilbert F. White 
A second aspect of this idea is that river basins in- 
creasingly have been treated as units. Instead of design- 
ing projects for solely one reach of a stream, projects 
for water control now are seen as fitting into a broader 
network throughout the drainage basin. This is the case 
with the Damoder Valley and other basin projects in 
India, in the Snowy Mountains of Australia, with most of 
the newer river schemes in the Soviet Union and the 
United States, and with the planning that is going on in 
a number of the basins of Latin America under the 
sponsorship of the Economic Commission for Latin 
America. 
Still a third aim that has become prominent in the last 
twenty-five years is the vision of using large-scale water 
control works to affect basic changes in the life of the 
people of the entire region. This was the goal of the 
Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States which 
used a system of dams to generate power, control floods, 
and provide navigation in such fashion that soil and 
forest resources would be Improved and the people's 
income and employment pattern would be bettered.

ON THE INDUS 
Down the River Indus and its five tri-

double that of the Nile. Some 40 mil- 
lion people in West Pakistan and ten 
million more in India rely on the Indus 
to irrigate 30 million acres of farm land. 
In September 1960 a long-standing dis- 
pute over the use of the Indus waters 
was settled by India and Pakistan which 
agreed to share them through a vast 
. international river development plan. Eight 
countries including India and Pakistan, 
and the International Bank are helping 
to pay the cost of dams, artificial lakes 
and an irrigation system. lrrigation will 
no longer be at the mercy of seasonal 
climatic changes or fluctuations in river- 
flow. The project will also increase 
hydro-electric resources and give better 
flood protection to both India and Pak- 
istan. Right, a mighty dam wall on

### 62148: The New Nile

THE 
NEW 
NILE 
he first stage in the building of Egypt's 
High Dam at Aswan was completed on 
May 14 by the opening of a huge diversion 
canal. Here, courage and ingenuity combine to 
meet problems created by today’s population 
“explosion”. Two centuries ago Egypt's popu- 
lation numbered two and a half millions. To- 
day it is 27 millions and by 1972 will have grown 
to 36 millions. For thousands of years the peo- 
ples of the Nile Valley were at the mercy of the 
river's whims; starvation or prosperity were 
entirely dependent on the vagaries of rainfall 
in the highlands of Ethiopia. The building of the 
first Aswan dam at the turn of the century and 
its enlargement in 1912 and 1933 were really 
no more than provisional measures. Now, for 
the first time in its history, the Nile is being 
completely harnessed for man’s use. When 
completed the dam will span a distance of over 
3,900 yards. and its waters will create the world’s 
second largest man-made lake (after the Kariba 
Dam in Rhodesia) some 300 miles in length. The 
new dam will make possible a 30 % increase 
in agricultural production, ‘the production of 
10,000 million kilowatt hours of electricity 
per year to give new impulse to industry, and 
will ensure complete protection against serious 
flooding. The dam is due to be completed 
by 1967 and the hydro-electric equipment should 
be functioning by 1969. Egypt has undertaken 
this huge task with financial aid amounting 
to 1,300 million roubles from the Soviet Unlon 
which also supplied equipment and 1,800 en- 
gineers and technicians. Newly-built villages 
are now replacing those due to disappear under 
the waters of the new dam. Thanks to aninter- 
national campaign launched by Unesco, funds 
have been collected for the biggest archaclo- 
gical operation of all time including the safe- 
guarding of the temples, at Abu Simbel. The 
progress of this campaign and the rescue of 
Nubia’s monuments have been described in The 
Unesco Courier, particularly in two special 
issues (Feb. 1960 and Oct. 1961). Another spe- 
cial number devoted to Nubia is being planned.

### 62147: Rivers of international concord

INTERNATIONAL CONCORD (Cont'd) 
The tricky art 
of taming nature 
The idea of Integrated river development now Is 
widespread. It 1s applled to management of small 
mountain valleys as well as to huge basins reaching to 
the ocean. It is carried out with great care in a number 
of the streams of the Soviet Union, notably the Volga- 
Kama, Don, Dnieper, and Syr-Darya. 
The United States has used this concept In plans not 
only for the Tennessee but for the whole upper Ohio, 
the Missouri, the Colorado, and perhaps most notably 
for the Columbia and central Californian basins. In 
only a few places, such as parts of the arid Colorado 
basin in the U.S.A. and the Iii basin in central Asia has 
development reached what might be considered maxi- 
mum. In most basins water still flows to the sea unregu- 
lated and the power of its fall remains unharnessed. 
Each year, however, sees additional water regulated and 
additional stream reaches captured by construction of 
dams. 
The great Integrated developments have taken place 
chiefly on streams which lle wholly within one country 
or In a single nation’s portion of a stream. Thus, the 
developments on the Rhone have been planned solely 
within France in the first instance and those on the 
- Tigris-Euphrates were designed wholly for Iraq. Only 
a few international streams have received integrated 
treatment although the International streams account 
for a large proportion of the drainage areas of the world. 
So: of the mighty rivers of the world—the 
Nile, the Amazon, the Congo, the Ganges- 
Brahmaputra, La Plata, the Amur and others—are dis- 
tinctively International streams. 
Until recent years only -a few of these had received 
unified, co-operative treatment from the countries which 
contribute the water and share in the opportunity to 
use it. The Danube has been the subject of collaboration 
in hydrologic data collection and navigation regulation 
for a long time (see photo story p. 38). Agreements for 
the maintenance of navigation works and, more recently, 
the management of polluting wastes have developed in 
the Rhine In Western Europe. International accords 
affect much of the water of the Nile. 
On the North American continent after many years 
of negotiation Canada and the United States have 
agreed on related plans for the Columbia basin. On the 
southern border, long-standing treaties affecting the 
regulation of the Rio Grande and Colorado are operated 
by Mexico and the United States, but. revisions must be 
considered as new conditions arise. 
Perhaps the outstanding case of direct investment In 
an international stream is on the Indus River where 
under the leadership of the International Bank for Recon- 
struction and Development a special programme of river 
development has been planned by India and Pakistan 
with a condominium of other interested countries (see 
page 33). 
The most elaborate collaboration in planning of inter- 
national river development before actual construction 
has taken place is in the Lower Mekong where four coun- 
tries, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam have jolned 
in carrying out basic scientific and engineering studies 
(see page 46). In this work they have been joined by 
eighteen other countries and several foundations and 
international agencies.

It now is possible to find teams of French and Indian 
engineers who are designing water management works 
in Cambodia using maps based on Canadian air photo- 
graphs, geology from an Australian study, hydrologic 
data from a United States programme, and reconnalis- 
sance survey work from Japan. A co-operative inter- 
national study currently is in the organizational stage 
for Senegal drainages In West Africa, also with the spon- 
sorship of the United Nations. 
Integrated river programmes place special demands on 
the Interlocking of scientific, technological, educational, 
and cultural activities. A great river basin is an ex- 
tremely complex web of relationships which show them- 
selves not only in the hydrologic cycle of water but in 
the movements of cilt and in the movements of people 
and thelr products. 
Governments have learned that when a dam is built it 
is more than a single structure which stores water from 
the flood season to be used In the dry season. It alters 
the regimen of the river downstream and thereby affects 
the flow and quality of water and the river channel. It 
changes the fish and plant population of the water. It 
may have a profound Impact upon the peoples way of 
_ earning a living, and it may disturb roads, market faci- 
litles and the channels of government. 
Quite aside from such instances as, for example, above 
the high Aswan dam on the Nile, where valuable archzo-

logical remains are threatened by reservoir construction, 
water management brings into play new forces that 
may profoundly alter the society which they are intended 
to ald. It does not always follow that a huge concrete 
dam, however appeallng it may be as a symbol of eco- 
nomic development and mastery of Western technology, 
will yield net benefits to the .area where it is built. The 
cost it imposes upon soclety may exceed the gains which 
flow from it. 
If agricultural extension, credit and marketing facili- 
ties do not shift to help farmers use the new opportu- 
nities effectively, an irrigation structure may fail to 
improve their output. Moreover, it may carry the hazards 
of disease. Today more than 100 million people in the 
world are suffering from the debilitating disease bilhar- 
ziasls whose spread has been largely encouraged by 
construction of irrigation projects which were intended 
to build up the economy of the very population which fis 
debilitated by the disease. 
It would be preferable before a river management pro- 
ject were undertaken to forecast with a fair degree of 
accuracy what its effects would be upon flows of water, 
silt, people, and income in a given culture area. Today, 
however, only a part of these impacts can be foreseen. 
The best that can be done is to marshal as much special 
study and judgment as can be obtained before fateful 
decisions are made as to further harnessing of the 
~ earth’s waters. 
BAIKAL 
World's 
deepest 
fresh-water 
lake 
With its volume of 5,300 cubic miles, 
of water, Lake Baikal in southern 
Siberia is the greatest fresh-water 
lake in the world. [tis also the deepest 
(5.400 feet) and has a length of 330 
miles. The animals and plants found 
at Baikal are one of its most remark- 
able features. About 1,200 spocies 
and varieties of animals and about 
700 plants have been found thero. 
Some of the animals are quite unique. 
Baikal is fed by 336 rivers, but only 
one flows from the lake—the Angara 
River. The rain and snow that fall 
each year on the lake total 2.2 cubic 
miles—enough water to fill Lake 
Zurich in Switzerland twice over.

It 1s not enough simply to develop engineering designs. 
These must be based as far as possible on accurate scien- 
tific knowledge of the phenomena of water and ecological 
relationships which will be changed. These effects must 
be measured not only In the direct «costs of construction 
and operation, but in the broader benefits and costs of 
changes in productivity and culture which will result 
from them. 
But even gains in productivity cannot be assured unless 
there is knowledgeable effort to assure the cultural and 
social conditions in which change may take place. Often 
this revolves upon education. Thus science, technology. 
social science, and education are mutually dependent In 
arriving at fruitful management of the earth's rivers.

DROPS IN THE HYDROLOGIST'S BUCKET 
BH WHEN WATER 
GROWS OLD 
The idea of water “growing old” Is one 
that never occurs to most people. In the 
popular sense water begins to “age” from 
the moment It is collected in a receptacle. 
However water is actually “born” the 
moment It condenses from a cloud and falls 
to the earth as rain, snow or hail. Water, 
in fact, starts to “age” the moment it begins 
to run over the surface of the ground and 
starts from watercourse to watercourse on 
its way to the sea. 
If it starts to infiltrate into the ground, 
where it will circulate and be stored, Its 
chances of "survival" increase considerably. 
Today, the dating of waters that have 
BM FRESH WATER 
SPRINGS IN THE SEA 
What could be more surprising than to 
watch a fishing boat leave the Greek coast 
at Corinth, or the Moroccan coast at Agadir, 
and make for a predetermined spot in the 
open sea to take aboard a supply of fresh 
water? 
Yet these Greek and Moroccan fishermen 
have long been doing this thanks to the 
knowledge, handed down from generation 
to generation, that at certain points fresh 
water springs in the relatively shallow sea- 
bed send water to the surface that Is 
practically uncontaminated by salt. 
These springs are generally fissured beds 
of limestone that drain surface water from 
the land and release great quantities of 
fresh water through faults or fractures on 
the sea-bed. Detailed studies of sub- 
marine springs have recently been made 
in Greece with a view to recovering these 
wasted water supplies for the benefit of 
the nearby land which is in dire need of 
them. The. presence of the sea-water 
from which they emerge, the instability 
of the water-mass pressures and, finally, 
their relative Inaccessibility, all complicate 
the task of recovery. 
Geological research of the kind used to 
locate oil deposits on the shore or under 
the sea has led to the catchment of artesian 
pockets of fresh water beneath the sea- 
shore at Istanbul In Turkey and at Recife 
in Brazil at depths of between 500 and 
650 feet. Here the techniques of the 
geologist have joined hands with age-old 
experience and knowledge of Greek and 
Moroccan fisherman, 
been stocked in the water-bearing rocks of 
the earth's crust for thousands of years—or 
perhaps only for a few centuries—has 
assumed great importance. 
When the "water capital” of a given area 
is being exploited It is important for water 
engineers to know how far this “capital” 
has already been drawn upon when catch- 
ment or pumping begins. This means they 
must find out the ratio between the volume 
of water which each year reaches the water- 
bearing terrain—the aquifer—and the 
volume of water extracted from it. This 
gives an idea of how long the stock will 
last. 
Nowadays underground water is looked 
on less and less as a fully-renewable 
natural resource. It tends more and more 
to be “mined” like ores, whose eventual 
exhaustion can be predicted. This calls 
for a change in the outlook of the user, 
and so greater efforts are being made to 
recharge the aquifer, that is, to build up 
its reserves by injecting water into the 
ground so that this can subsequently be 
recuperated for man’s use. 
Research into the dating of water enables 
us to follow the effect of these restocking 
operations on the evolution of underground 
reserves. Use is made of radioisotopes, 
such as tritium or carbon 14, to determine 
the age of an underground water supply. 
Isotope tests have shown that large 
underground stocks of water may well have 
been deposited (especially in arid lands) 
during the rainy periods of the Quaternary 
Age when, long before the present desert 
climate, forests grew in the Sahara.

BH WATER WITH 
A CUTTING EDGE 
The many uses of water, from its role as 
a basic necessity for men, plants and 
animals to the part it plays alongside coal 
and oil in supplying energy, are well known. 
Less well known is the fact that the power 
of water may be used In factories and 
HN CITY BUILT 
ON A ‘JELLY’ 
The centre of Mexico City, and in 
particular Alameda Square and the Fine 
Arts Theatre, is subsiding at the alarming 
rate of nearly 12 inches a year. 
Mexican engineers blame the continuous 
pumping operations that go on near the 
city for this subsidence. The explanation 
is as follows: 
At the beginning of the Quaternary Age, 
the area of Mexico City had been a large 
and very deep valley which was closed 
  
workshops like a cutting tool, with the 
simple difference that it will never get 
worn or need sharpening. 
In September 1961 the Bulletin of the 
Water Information Center in the United 
States reported that a big machine-tool 
factory at Los Angeles had designed and 
built a machine In which a fine stream of 
water with a pressure of over 14,000 Ibs 
per square inch is used to cut cement, 
abruptly- by a flow of lava from Mount 
Popocatepetl, Mexico's largest volcano. 
Once sealed off, the valley rapidly 
became a lake between 2,000 and 2,600 feet 
deep. This in turn was gradually filled with 
volcanic ash from subsequent eruptions. 
Finally, only a shallow depth of water was 
left while deep down the ash instead of 
settling formed a glutinous mixture with 
the water until the land became rather like 
a jelly in consistence. 
The present site of Mexico's capital was 
still a lake when the Spanish conquistadores 
arrived in the country, and when the Aztecs 
established their capital there they were 
thinking of its natural defensive advantages.

that now remains of the once vast lake on 
which the Aztec rulers built their capital. 
This situation, coupled with one of a 
more geographical kind, namely that the 
town Is situated in an enclosed inland 
basin, has created a serlous problem of 
waste-water disposal for the municipal 
authorities. Since the basin is completely 
closed, the water can neither be returned 
into the ground nor evacuated Into a canal 
or river, Furthermore the roads leaving 
Mexico City—situated at an altitude of 
7.870 feet—climb up to 9,190 feet and to 
even higher levels before they are free to 
turn down the Atlantic slopes on one side 
or the Pacific slopes on the other. 
Thus the only possible way to dispose of 
sewage water Is to pump it out of the 
enclosed basin and into the Atlantic basin. 
How Important this pumping has become 
can be gauged from the fact that over four 
million people live In the area. 
The public health services and the 
government Itself keep constant watch on 
the multitude of pumps used for this 
operation for a general breakdown would 
allow Invading sewage waters to flood the 
city to first floor level within 24 hours. 
  
lM DEW MOUNDS AND 
‘LILY RESERVOIRS’ 
The ancient peoples living in desert areas 
built “dew mounds” of large flint pebbles 
around each fruit tree and vine to attract 
the dew and convey It quickly to the roots 
of the plants. 
Today, people still find ways of collecting 
dew which condenses naturally in some 
local areas. An ingenious method of dew 
collection has been devised by a farmer on 
the island of Brava in the Cape Verde 
archipelago. There is little rainfall In the 
Cape Verde Islands and It never rains 
during the long dry season. But the land 
is generally shrouded by heavy mists or 
fogs and this produces much natural 
condensation on to the leaves of plants and 
directly on to the soil. This moisture is 
often sufficient to carry crops through the 
dry season. But drinking water is in short 
supply and the farmer In question had to 
transport water for some distance. 
However, he noticed that dew was 
condensing so heavily on the leaves of a 
giant lily that it dripped on to the soil. So 
he tied the leaves in such a way that the 
dew dripped from leaf to leaf and down to 
the ground. He then planted 60 of these 
lilies in a row down a slope and made a 
gutter from the highest to the lowest by 
placing the large boat-shaped leaves of 
other lily-plants on the ground. At the end 
of the gutter he constructed a small 
reservoir, from which he has since collected 
an average of 200 litres of fresh water 
daily. When the fog Is dense his row of 
plants collects 600 litres in a day.

A 
PEOPLES OF THE DELTAS . 
A see-saw hattle LF

by Adriaan Volker 
T= delta of a rlver ls the last gift to man of 
the watercourse on Its way to the sea The 
classic example, of course, Is Lower Egypt, but the des- 
cription also applies to many other delta areas which 
range among the most productive and most densely 
populated parts of the world. 
In the delta the river drops the sediments, silt and 
sand—the products of erosion—that it has been carrying 
all along Its course from the mountains to the sea or to 
the lake Into which It flows. The slope that provides 
the driving force for the flow of the water and the sedi- 
ments flattens out when approaching the coastal area, 
the river's velocity decreases and to carry the flow from 
upstream still further, it must split up into a number 
of branches or distributaries. 
At the point where this happens, the apex, the deltale 
and final reach of the river begins. In this reach the 
velocity decreases still further and the flow is finally 
backed up by the sea water. Unable to carry the sedi- 
ments any further, the river starts building up land. 
Thus, as the land area expands at the expense of the 
sea’s domain some of the soll lost by erosion Is recovered 
and restored to man. 
But the sea fights back. Tidal currents and storm 
surges remove some of the sediments deposited in the 
delta and carry them to great depths. 
A continuous struggle goes on in a delta between the 
river and the sea, and when Man intervenes to utilize 
the land, he too must face the destructive power of the 
tidal waters. 
Not all rivers build up deltas on reaching the sea. 
When the forces of the sea prevall because of strong 
tides, great depths and the Impact of the waves, or 
when the delta area is rapidly subsiding, a single 
estuary is formed over which the sea is master. 
Although favourable conditions for delta formation are 
found in shallow lakes without tides and waves, the 
largest deltas have been formed along the coast of 
oceans, seas and inland seas for it is here that the 
largest rivers emerge. 
When a river reaches its delta the scenery changes, 
the horizon widens, land and water mingle, the river 
becomes less turbulent and near.the sea it is dominated 
by the slow breathing rhythm of the tides. The Greek 
astronomer and geographer, Pytheas, who visited nor- 
thern Europe in the 4th century B.C. described the 
delta of the River Rhine as the “Sea-Lung,” which he 
sald was “somewhere in the north where ice, water and 
air mingle—without doubt the end of the earth.” And 
(as a man from the Mediterranean), he was struck by 
the much greater rise and fall of the North Sea tides. 
Even the atmosphere changes in the delta; the light 
which is flitered and reflected from all sides becomes 
more diffuse. The special qualities of light found in 
deltas Inspired and influenced the Dutch school of 
painters.

Delta areas are blessed with many natural advanta- 
ges which encourage man to make use of them. All the 
water from the river basin reaches the delta situated 
at its lowest point, and water is therefore relatively 
abundant. The fine-grained soils are fertile and deep 
and floods bring a constant supply of new sediments. 
The high underground-water table provides a natural 
supply for crops. 
Only in arid climates may the underground-water table 
not be high enough during the whole year. The 
remedy, irrigation, is relatively easy to apply because 
of the flatness of the land and its low elevation with 
respect to river water levels. The dense network of 
river branches and creeks provides an excellent and 
safe communication system. 
In the early stages of human settlement men made 
thelr homes on the natural ridges or levees along the 
river branches and creeks where the land is higher 
than in the central part of the delta areas and 
affords a certain degree of natural protection against 
floods. In some deltas this stage was followed by the 
dredging of a network of canals to open up the area. 
Once again farm houses were built along these new 
watercourses and thus the characteristic type of settle- 
ment in the deltas Is one of ribbon development. 
Soon the need was felt to control the flood waters 
from the river. Embankments were thrown up along 
certain reaches of the river branches, thus providing

partial flood protection and leaving other areas open 
as ways of escape and release for the highest floods. 
To extend the flood protection system, dikes were 
built encircling the low-lying areas so as to exclude the 
flood waters completely. As this hampered the natural 
drainage of excess rainwater, It became necessary to 
install a drainage system with sluices equipped with 
movable gates, drainage canals, ditches, etc. 
In the deltas in semi-arid zones, irrigation was in- 
troduced at an early stage. Classic examples are the 
delta of the Nile and the internal deltas of the Euphra- 
tes and Tigris and the Indus which became sites of 
early civilizations. 
The natural advantages of deltas were recognized in 
an early stage of history but it was soon reallzed that 
to gain the full benefit of these advantages certaln 
technical problems would have to be solved. 
First there is the problem of floods. Deltas are in- 
vaded by floods from two sides: from the rivers and 
from the sea. To a certain extent the river floods are 
beneficial. They supply the land with fresh sediments 
thereby improving the soil structure and ralsing the 
land elevation. The river flood is the main agent in 
building up the delta. The flooding of the land does 
not necessarily preclude use of the land for farming. 
All depends on the nature of the floods, the climate and 
the adaptability of man “to live with the floods.” 
The large and densely populated deltas of the River 
Mekong in Viet-Nam, the River Chao Phya in Thalland 
and, to a certain extent, the River Irrawaddy in Burma, 
which are flooded annually, show that the land can 
be used for agriculture and human settlement. 
But two conditions must be met. Firstly, the floods 
must be gentle ones, i.e. where the water level rises 
slowly, remains at about its maximum for ‘quite a long 
period, and then slowly recedes. Secondly, the climate 
should allow a crop of rice to be raised during the 
flood season. 
Rice Is the only profitable crop that can grow in 
rising water, providing that the rate of rise is small. 
Rice still grows in water several metres deep and is 
salt tolerant. Hence it is the most sultable crop for 
deltas in the humid troplcal zone which, lacking flood 
protection works, are exposed to inundation. 
The most Interesting example of intensive use being 
made of a deltaic area which Is flooded regularly is 
the delta of the River Chao Phya. Here a crop of 
rice is raised during the wet monsoon from May until 
November. Since rainfall during that period Is not 
usually adequate to meet the crop needs the additional 
water supply by flooding is an absolute necessity. The 
gently rising flood waters are beneficlal and if they

HARNESSING THE MEKONG 
the world, descends from the snows 
of the High Tibet plateau and flows 
for 2,500 miles before reaching the South 
China Sea. During its journey it crosses 
six countries—Mainland China, Burma, 
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Viet-Nam. 
A few small dams have been built on its 
tributaries in Thailand and some channels 
cut for irrigation, drainage or navigation, 
but nowhere is the main channel crossed 
by a bridge; nowhere is it curbed by a 
dam. Most of the water flows from source 
to sea without being used by man. Today 
the Mekong is the scene of a historic inter- 
national project in river development. 
Under the auspices of the United Nations, 
14 countries have begun to help the peo- 
ples of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Viet- 
Nam to make use of the abundant waters 
of the lower Mekong. Because none of 
the four countries nor even all of them 
T HE Mekong, seventh longest river in together have the technical or financial 
resources for such a huge project, the 
United Nations helped them to set up a 
committee to study the Lower Mekong 
Basin, whose present population of 20 mil- 
lion is expected to double within 25 years. 
Two major cities of southeast Asia—Sai- 
gon-Cholon and Bangkok, each with a 
population of one million—are outside the 
basin. Except for the 500,000 people in 
the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, and 
the 100,000 in the Laotian capital, Vien- 
tiane, the population of the basin is largely 
rural. Rice-growing, the basic activity of 
the majority, is dependent on the monsoon 
cycle. The water management plan will 
make possible flood control and increased 
irrigation, and thus the cultivation of a 
second annual rice crop over large areas. 
A number of dams are planned: in the 
Pamong gorges, 20 miles from Vientiane; 
at Khemarat, near the confluence with the 
  
Unations 
River Mune; at the falls of Khone and at 
Sambor. Finally, a dam built on the Tonle 
Sap river between Cambodia's Great Lake 
and the Mekong will increase the lake's 
capacity as a flood reservoir. The Mekong 
will become a year-round deep water 
channel right up to Vientiane—1,000 miles 
from the sea. Unesco is supervising the 
preparation of a mathematical model show- 
ing the Basin's present hydraulic charac- 
teristics and how they will be modified. 
DELTA BASIN (Cont'd) 
Floods that bring fertility 
fail to occur the crop suffers damage by drought. 
People in the Chao Phya delta have got accustomed to 
the cycle of the floods and have learned how to live 
with it. 
Things are very different when the floods are of the 
flash type or when the climate is unsuitable for rice- 
growing. Flash floods, appearing suddenly and causing 
rapld varlations of the water level, are destructive. 
In such cases little use can be made of the land areas 
in the delta unless a system of flood protection works, 
such as embankments, has been made. Thus in the 
delta of the Red River in North Viet-Nam, where flash 
floods occur, dikes have been built to protect the land. 
This system of flood protection may be more than two 
thousand years old. However, in the delta of the Rlver 
Mekong in Viet-Nam, where the flood waters rise and 
fall slowly, there are no dikes. 
Although a good crop of rice can be raised under 
conditions of natural flooding, the yields remain rela- 
tively modest. To obtain the high productivity level 
of the paddy flelds in Japan, China, Spain, and Italy, 
for example, adequate water control is an absolute 
necessity, and this naturally entails flood protection, 
drainage and irrigation. 
The menace of floods from the sea Is even more 
serious than that from rivers. During storm surges 
the sea level may raise several metres above the 
normal, and if the dikes fall vast areas become deeply 
inundated with salt water. Sea floods are unpredictable 
and always destructive. Thousands of casualties were 
reported during storm surges or typhoons which hit the 
coastal and deltaic areas of Holland In 1953, Japan in 
1959, Germany in 1962 and East Pakistan in 1960 and 
in 1963. Considerable damage by loss of property, loss 
of crops and salinization of the soil occurred. 
The history of the deltas is marked by a succession of 
flood disasters. Man however has not abandoned his 
land but has fought back, strengthening his systems of 
defence against {he possible return of similar or even 
greater floods. Thus the storm flood disaster of 1933 
in the Netherlands led to the execution of the Delta 
Plan aiming at the enclosure of tidal estuaries of the 
River Rhine (see page 48). Similar works were carried 
out in Japan in the area of Nagoya after the 1959 floods. 
Not all deltas are exposed to storm surges from the 
sea. In the deltas of the River Irrawaddy in Burma 
and the River Chao Phya in Thalland flooding of the 
coastal strip only occurs during exceptionally high tides 
and few protective works are needed. 
Even if the land is well protected against direct inva- 
sion by the sea a secondary problem may arise through 
the infiltration of salt water into the river branches and 
the land areas of the delta. The sea water penetrates 
into the open estuaries and, being heavier than fresh 
water, it creeps over the bottom of the river in an 
upstream direction. It mixes to some extent with the 
fresh water on top, making the river water brackish 
over a considerable distance from its mouth and thus 
unsuitable for irrigation or drinking. 
This happens especially in the dry season when the 
river flow which normally halts the saline water is at 
its weakest. The saline water also enters the subsoil 
and even at shallow depths the underground water may 
become quite brackish. This underground water may seep 
out and ooze to the surface, contaminating water in the 
ditches and canals. In developed delta areas consi- 
derable amounts of salt are admitted when ships 
coming from the sea enter locks. Another source of 
salt pollution is the waste water from mining and 
chemical industries. 
Thus the protection of fresh water supplies In the 
coastal zone of a delta is nowadays a major problem. 
It is a latent menace, less spectacular but no less serious 
than the more obvious and direct attacks of the sea. 
Early settlements in deltas were usually above the 
limits of the salt water intrusion, but with increasing 
population pressure and need for more arable land and 
with the construction of harbours close to the coastline, 
use has to be made of areas exposed to penetration by 
salty waters.

Project. Right, flood 
level markers on the

The most drastic and effective measure to halt the 
salt water invasion Is to dam off the estuaries and tidal 
inlets. In the enclosing dam, sluices with movable gates 
are provided. These remain closed during high tides 
and storm surges and are opened to evacuate the flood 
waters of the river, Projects of this type have been 
carried out on a large scale in Japan and in the 
Netherlands. The enclosed water areas of the estuaries 
turn into fresh water reservoirs, the coastline is shor- 
tened, the dralnage and irrigation facilities of the 
adjacent areas are improved, etc. 
Thus deltas offer a never-ending challenge to thelr 
inhabitants: each interference with the natural process 
of flooding and sedimentation provokes repercussions 
leading to further action by man. 
Many deltas have undergone considerable develop- 
ment. The most ancient example is that of the River 
Nile. The deltas of the River Po in Italy, the Red River 
in northern Viet-Nam and the Yellow River in the 
mainland of China are other examples of highly pro- 
ductive regions.

The delta areas of many smaller rivers in Japan‘and 
the delta area of the River Rhine in the Netherlands 
have become Industrialized areas where the largest ports 
of the world are found. Other deltas are relatively pro- 
ductive, but still In the first stage of technical develop- 
ment. 
Thelr further development calls for the use of specia- 
list knowledge of problems in the flelds of hydraulic 
and agricultural engineering, soll science, agronomy, 
coastal engineering, geo-hydrology, ete. The problems 
of the deltas are of a rather special nature and there 
are still too few experts In these ficlds.

tive at a conference in 1960 to promote the technical and 
economic development of the many large deltas In that 
region. A general inventory of the area and a survey of 
the many problems involved were made by a misslon 
of experts from Japan and the Netherlands who had on- 
the-spot discussions with the local authorities. The 
results of this study were discussed during a symposium 
at Bangkok in 1963 which was focused on the “flood 
control, reclamation, utilization and development” of 
delta areas In the ECAFE region. 
The general scientific aspects of deltas In the huml!d 
tropical zone were discussed In a symposium organized 
by UnEsco In March 1964 and held at Dacca (East Pa- 
kistan). This symposium covered a wider field than 
the ECAFE meeting without entering into the technical 
questions of engineering and economics which were the 
main toples of the Bangkok meeting. 
Research into the varlous hydrological problems of 
delta, estuarine and coastal areas ls also one of the 
items of UNEsco’s Hydrological Decade for international 
collaboration in the fleld of hydrology.

carry out a gigantic engineering project thanks 
to the progress of modern technology and the efforts of 
a people who over the centuries have literally wrested 
their land from the sea. 
The Netherlands is a country that has challenged the 
sea and won a resounding victory. With much of its 
territory situated at lower levels than the high tides of 
the powerful North Sea, the Netherlands has not only 
defended itself, but has expanded its land area thanks 
to a remarkable system of pumping stations and coast 
defences running for over 1,000 miles. For over seven 
centurles its people have multiplied the sea dikes, greatly 
reducing the coast line in the north. One simple dike, 
the Barrier Dam, 20 miles In length, has pushed back 
g the North Sea 50 miles and shortened the coastline by 
nearly 200 miles. Behind its massive walls, the former 
Zuyder Zee has become a fresh water lake called the

The great Haringvliet dam is one of the most 
remarkable engineering projects ever devised 
to overcome a double threat from sea and river. 
It has been provided with 17 large sluices 
(each 62 yards long) through which excess 
water and ice from the Meuse and Rhine rivers 
can be allowed to reach the sea. This group 
of sluices in the open sea will have an overall

rivers—the Rhine, the Meuse and the Scheldt—run into 
the sea. 
Thus was born the Delta Project—a complex of 
engineering works to give new control over the sea. The 
work will take 25 years to complete and will bring a 
physical and economic transformation to a large part of 
the country. 
Under the Delta Project four major sea-arms will be 
dammed off (see map) and secondary dykes will be 
constructed. This will give protection against the sea to 
the entire south west of the country. Two of these sea- 
arms, the Niewe Westerweg and the Wester Schelde, the 
approach routes to the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, 
will be left open, but their dykes will be raised and 
strengthened. To allow the discharge of excess waters 
or blocks of ice coming down the Meuse and the two lower 
Rhine arms—the Waal and the Lek—a block of 17 sluices 
is being built in the dam enclosing the Haringvliet 
estuary. To make this possible a giant construction pit 
was made which, when the enclosed waters had been 
pumped out, formed a man-made island. The 17 sluices 
built here will have a total length of over half a mile. 
Not all the landscape of 
the Netherlands has the 
checkerboard appearance 
of these fields divided by 
drainage canals. But if 
all the country’s ditches 
and canals were laid end 
to end they would still 
cover two-thirds the 
distance to the moon.

The Delta Project is more than a weapon to defeat the 
sea. It will have a tremendous effect on the fresh water 
economy of the Netherlands. Today salt water penetrates 
canals and drainage channels and infiltrates to the land 
on the islands and in the coastal areas of the mainland, 
harming the soil by salt impregnation. When the new 
dams are bullt, fresh water from the rivers will be used 
to desalt canals and land alike. An immense reservoir of 
fresh water will be built up behind the dams in cxactly 
the same way that the immense Ijselmeer lake was filled 
by the River Rhine when the Zuyder Zee was closed ofl. 
Three dams will be bullt on the lower Rhine to allow 
part of its waters to flow to the Ijselmeer Instead of 
directly to the sea, Similarly, water from the Meuse and 
the Waal will be diverted via Rotterdam. 
The Delta Project will also give an important boost to 
the Netherlands’ economy. An interconnecting system of 
roads will be built along the dams, linking hitherto 
isolated islands with the mainland. The broad beaches 
of Zeeland will also become more accessible. And the vast 
new expanses of fresh water will become a paradise for 
devotees of water sports and salllng.

POWER FROM 
In the Netherlands, the windmill is still a familiar 
part of the landscape. There are fewer today, 
of course, than in the 18th century when they 
numbered some 9,000. But of the 1,750 that 
still exist, some 1,300 are still doing a job of 
work—grinding corn, sawing wood, pumping 
water from the canals. Despite the development 
of more powerful pumping apparatus many of 
the windmills are still doing the work they were 
built for many years ago. Some have been 
kept in a perfect state of repair for centuries. 
Symbols of a long history of hard work and 
ingenuity, the windmills of the Netherlands are 
classed as historic monuments. There is even 
a “Windmills Association” whose efforts are 
‘deployed to preserve and restore these graceful 
and picturesque buildings and, when possible, 
to extend their working life. Left, a windmill

this man depends the efficiency ‘with which the

### 62154: Floods, floods, floods

FLOODS ! 
FLOODS !! 
FLOODS 
by Maurice Pardé 
| HE sight of a large river in flood is a memor- 
able experience. As the flow of water suddenly 
increases, rising by as much as 20 or 30 feet in a few 
hours, it sweeps all before it, tumbling bridges, uprooting 
and carrying away trees, tearing down houses and 
covering the countryside with mud, sand and rocks. This 
is Nature revealed in a mood of wild rage and devastating 
power, 
Equally Impressive, though less savagely spectacular, 
is the type of flood that sometimes spreads out from the 
lower reaches of large rivers. Stretching further than 
the eye can see, the floodwaters are sometimes 30 to 60 
miles in width and extend along the river for 300 to 
~ 600 miles or more. 
Long before men began to spread over the earth, floods 
ravaged its surface. At the very dawn of history we 
find man afflicted by them. Stories of flood tragedies, 
like the epic of Noah and the Ark, are woven into the 
traditions and folklore of many ancient peoples. - And 
sometimes, traces of the floods recounted in these stories 
have actually been found by modern archeologists, 
Once floods were accepted as accldents—unpredictable 
and unavoidable. But men have learned more about the 
part rivers play in the great “hydrologic cycle” and are 
now using this knowledge to predict floods, in some cases 
to control the damage done by them and in others to 
prevent them from happening. 
To find the most .effective ways of combatting floods, 
science has set out to learn as much as possible about 
the major ones: thelr basic causes, the levels they reach, 
their maximum discharges, the total volume of water 
produced and the speeds of thelr rise and fall. Each 
river network has its own distinctive features, or perhaps 
it would be truer to say that many rivers can be placed 
in distinctive categories. One of the basic alms of 
Potamology (the scientific study of rivers) is the identifi- 
cation of these “river species.” 
The River Ardéche, a western tributary of the Rhone 
River in France, is a typlcal example of the kind of river 
  
The Ardéche quickly swells 
to its greatest size when it recelves between seven and. 
elght inches of rain in a matter of hours from its 730 
square miles of catchment upstream from Vallon. Many 
other Mediterranean rivers in France, Spain and Italy 
are just as easily aroused and are sometimes equally 
redoubtable. 
where sudden floods occur. 
In many subtropical and tropical regions the effects 
of rapid flood rises on the rivers are even more alarming. 
In such reglons great downpours of four to eight inches 
of rain may fall within an hour over a surface of from - 
20 to 70 square miles or over an even greater area. River 
levels rise with terrifying speed; sometimes within hours 
the flood has reached its peak. 
In contrast, on very long and gently sloping rivers like 
the Mississippl and the lower Yangtse-Kiang, the peak 
is reached only after the waters have been rising for 
four or six weeks. They sometimes take even longer to 
arrive if the floods are caused by successive downpours 
whose effect is continuous and cumulative. 
The amounts of water involved seem slight when cal- 
culated in relation to each square mile of the receiving 
area. But when we look at the gross figures of the 
volumes of water flowing they are seen to be enormous:-— 
nearly 3,000,000 cubic feet in August 1954 for 540,000 square 
miles on the Yangtse-Kiang at Hankow; more than 
300,000 cublc feet—including the water overflowing the 
banks—for 1,200,000 square miles on the Mississippl at 
Vicksburg in May 1917. 
The rainfall which causes major floods of this kind 
covers a huge area—700,000 square miles or more—and 
is thus well below the average intensity of the downpours 
on the Ardéche and still less so the deluges of places like 
Texas, the Philippines or Japan, all of which are confined 
to small areas. For instance, in 1931, the Yangtse-Kiang 
above Hankow received about 18 inches of rain, but over 
a period of two months. 
The essential cause of the unprecedented floods on the 
Volga, 2,400,000 cubic feet in the Kubyshev region for

### 62154: Floods, floods, floods

470,000 square miles, Is the melting snow, whose water 
equivalent, Including additional river inflows, totals some 
12 inches within a single month. And the glant floods 
of the Yenesei and the Lena In the U.S.S.R.—possibly 
totalling respectively 1,040,000 and 960,000 cubic feet— 
which are the highest In the world after those of the 
Amazon, are no doubt due to thawing snow which, added 
to the rainfall, amounts to seven to eight inches in a 
month, as far as can be estimated. 
Floods which are from twenty to a hundred times 
slower In rising and falllng than the ultra-rapid ones 
nevertheless attain colossal proportions because of the 
enormous amount of water flowing and the immensity of 
the area they cover. Between these two extremes nature 
produces a wide range of floods of intermediate size and 
varying characteristics. 
Hoe major river floods are not caused 
exclusively by excessive rainfall or abnormal 
thaws or a combination of the two. They may also occur 
without any exceptional increase in water flow when the 
river bed is blocked, usually for only a period, by obstacles 
of a solid and bulky kind. 
Sometimes the river itself is responsible. Blocks of 
ice may pile up in narrower or shallower sections of the 
river channel. Blockages are formed across slow rivers 
subjected to intense cold, either when the surface is 
frozen or much more frequently, when the thaw drives 
the frozen debris downstream. 
One example of this kind is the disastrous flood on the 
Rhine at Coblenz and Cologne in January 1784. In 
Cologne the levels of the waters were at least 10 feet 
higher than in any earlier known “iceless” floods. Ice 
too played a part in the flooding of Budapest when in 
March 1838 the Danube rose six feet above any previous 
(or subsequent) recorded level. At the time of the Hun- 
garian catastrophe, a storm wind drove the waters and-

ice before it and more than half the bulldings in Pest 
were destroyed. 
Even higher and more watertight obstacles can be bullt 
up in deep and narrow mountain reaches by the arrival 
of inflowing glaciers. 
Spectacular examples occur in the Indus system behind 
the Himalayas or as it passes through the wild gorges 
several thousand metres below the peaks. In 1840, a lake 
820 feet deep was formed by an obstacle In the Indus at 
the toe of Nanga Parbat, and one 196 feet deep was creat- 
ed In the Chayog, a tributary of the same river, upstream 
of the Chang-Kumdan glacier in the Karakoram in 1939. 
The worst feature of these obstructions is that sooner 
or later they break up and waves of swirling and roaring 
ice and debris plunge into the valleys where they sweep 
away and crush everything in their path. 
Glaciers can also be the cause of other disasters that 
are not always predictable. In the night of July 12-13, 
1892, the Téte Rousse glacier to the south of Mont Blanc 
suddenly released 7,000,000 cubic feet of water enclosed 
in a pocket at a height of more than 10,000 feet. 
Rushing down the mountain side this mass of water 
scooped up rocks and earth from the slopes until it In- 
creased five-fold, forming a terrifying stream of “lava” 
—the term used for floods which contaln more mud, sand, 
pebbles and rock than water. There were 175 victims, 
most of them In the little town ot Saint-Gervalis. 
Flood disasters occur above all where river-beds have 
been made too narrow by Nature or have been restricted 
by man-made works, or ‘where the slope is too small 
to carry away the high discharges that can occur on 
these rivers. In Canada, for example the memorable 
April-May 1950 flood on the North Red River coming 
from the United States caused unbelievable damage In 
Winnlpeg and nearby, despite the fact that its discharge 
at the tlme was not consldered dangerous by speclalists.

FLOODS (Cont'd) 
The river mouth wandered 300 miles 
As on many other sites, the riverside populations had 
increased the already dangerous narrowness of the river 
by constructing far too many buildings, including many 
factories and warehouses, in the flood plain. 
Yet even allowing for the results of man’s thoughtless- 
ness and rashness in siting homes in valleys subject to 
flooding, it is clear that materlal damage is In fact 
directly proportional to the power and the nature of 
the floods in any given river sector. 
In the tragic disaster of the Riera de las Arenas and of 
other small and very steep Catalan rivers in the hilly 
country behind Barcelona at Tarrasa, Rubu, Sabadell, and 
other villages, there were a number of causes for the 
flood which killed more than 700 people in the night of 
September 25-26 1962. 
Firstly, furious discharges of ‘water, occuring in an area 
of a few dozen square miles, were produced by storm 
rainfall of short but crushing intensity—more than four 
inches in three-quarters of an hour. A second reason was 
the irregularity of the river beds, whose width and depth 
were far too small to contain the discharges. The crown- 
ing misfortune was lack of foresight In choosing locations 
for residential and industrial buildings. At places where 
the bridges were too small and too low, wreckage piled up 
before “exploding” and sweeping all before it. Buildings 
were shattered and carried away. The roaring masses of 
water unleashed in these Catalan streams were as deadly 
as the torrential “lava” already described. 
R:=s of all sizes draining vast, subarid 
regions, - ‘which are virtually unprotected 
against erosive runoff by their scant vegetation, may 
Increase thelr volume by 20% t¢ 30% or more through 
the addition of mud. 
Towards its entry into the vast deltaic plain, the Yellow - 
River, the Hwang Ho, has been known to carry down more 
than 500 kgs. of sediment per cublc metre of water, In 
spite of its relatively gentle slope. Although these minute 
particles do not slow down the discharge as would bulkier 
fragments, the river-bed still cannot contain the water 
during heavy floods. The water level Is swiftly raised by 
the dropping of the extra solld load—especlally of fine 
sand—and the river flows over what is actually a flat yet 
still protruding embankment covering an area of more 
than 58,000 square miles. 
When the river has broken through one of its dykes, 
its murky waters engulf the land and In some places leave 
layers of mud, several yards thick, around the surviving 
houses. The waters are unable to return to their former 
course and several times have flowed to the sea on first 
one and then the other side of the Shantung Peninsula, 
250 to 300 miles from thelr former mouth. 
On September 29, 1887, the Hwang Ho flood waters 
rushed through a breach in the southern dyke upstream 
of Kaifeng. Within a few days they had reached the 
Hwal, itself a dangerous river, and then flowed on to the 
Yangtse-Kiang. A million Chinese are said to have 
perished during this catastrophe. 
On the Yangtse-Klang, floods can threaten as many 
as 25 to 30 million people. An International enquiry 
showed that in the floods of July and August 1931, some 
140,000 people were drowned or were crushed beneath the 
wreckage of their homes. Many more died of pneumonia, 
typhoid or hunger. 
On the North American continent, and in past times 
(In 1882, for example), the inadequately banked and 
dammed Mississippi invaded vast areas, but they were 
then far less populated. In April and May 1927, when 
the Mississippi transformed 35,000 square miles into a sea 
of muddy water, there were 214 victims. 
The Ohio is another U.S. river subject to major floods. 
Its swollen waters are often partially or even entirely 
responsible for the great Mississippi floods. In February 
1937, it surpassed its previous highest level by nine feet 
at Cincinnati and by ten feet at Louisville. In March 
1036, the disastrous flood on the upper Ohlo alone rose

above the highest flood level ever recorded by nearly 
five feet at Pittsburgh, where 110,000 people were left 
homeless and some forty lost their lives. 
Another memorable U.S. flood, but this time further 
West, devastated the Kansas River valley and the valleys 
of the neighbouring Neosho and Osage rivers in July 1951, 
vet caused only 19 deaths. Records show that a previous. 
but smaller flood in this area in May-June 1903 claimed 
over 100 victims. The low casualty list in the recent 
flood points to remarkable progress made in flood warning 
and rescue arrangements. 
Another U.S. flood, almost as disastrous, occurred in- 
New England in August 1955. Violent currents, flowing 
down steeper slopes than those in Kansas, made these 
waters even more sudden and violently erosive. Fed by 
the torrential rainfall from cyclone Diana, and following 
a super saturation of the ground by cyclone Connle a few 
days earlier, the flood raised the River Delaware to greater 
heights than anyone could recall. But even more as- 
tounding and terrifying were the increases on modest 
coastal rivers like the Naugatuck and the Quinebaug, 
or small rivers like the Farmington and Westfield which 
run into the Connecticut. Almost 180 people dled in 
this flood.

discharges of water during cloudbursts can make a host

of streams In at least one half of the United States 
irresistible and devastating. 
Of the ultra-rapid type of flood in France, those in the 
Cévennes, Languedoc and Roussillon, although nothing 
like as powerful as the Texan floods, often have disastrous 
results. 
On September 22, 1890, some 40 people were drowned 
by the Ardéche and its tributaries. Nearly 70 years later, 
on September 30, 1958, the Ardéche flood was less terrible, 
but the Gardon and the Céze, which always rise at the 
same time, reached record helghts and claimed 36 victims. 
Other floods which France experiences are less swift 
but even more striking because of the size of the area 
inundated, the rivers responsible being very large ones. 
Two notable floods of this kind occurred between June 
23-25, 1875 and March 3-6, 1930 in the basin of the River 
Garonne. 
The first, in which quite exceptional floods swept down 
the Pyrenean rivers, the Ariége and the upper Garonne, 
caused an unprecedented disaster. Five hundred people 
perished, including more than 200 in Toulouse. The 
water was 10 to 15 feet deep in the streets of Agen. 
In March 1930, flood levels once agaln rose almost as 
high in Agen. This time the water came not from the 
upper Garonne, but from the Tarn, the Aveyron and the 
Agout whose maximum flows were perhaps such as occur 
only once in a thousand years. There were 200 deaths, 
including 120 at Molssac. 
In May and June 1858, flood water swept over the 
smiling and fertile Loire Valley from the Bec d'Alller down 
to Nantes at the river's mouth as the dykes gave way in 
160 places. Water covered more than 400 square miles. 
For many centuries, man has endeavoured to protect 
towns and rich and populated valleys by bullding earth 
dikes along one or both banks of rivers. 
An area of 20,000 square miles of land towards the 
mouth of the Mississippi and its tributaries, are safe- 
guarded In thls way agalnst flood risks by 2,800 miles of 
dikes.

FLOODS (Cont'd) 
Hundreds of square miles of land disappeared under the waters. Over 1,000 people 
Above, salvaging a stranded bus. 
Curbing an angry torrent 
throughout the past century have similarly been offset by 
an obvious rise in the water level—three feet or more in 
certaln sections where the bed had not been deepened 
at all. 
This has led to the extra expense of raising the crest 
and thickening out the body of the dikes to enable them 
to hold in the higher water levels that they have them- 
selves made more dangerous. Then, on short stretches 
which have to be safeguarded at all costs, the earth 
embankments are replaced by narrow verticle concrete 
floodwalls. 
In very critical situations, dikes are gradually ralsed 
with sacks of sand and cement to form a makeshift 
barrier which prevents them from being overtopped and 
thus inevitably destroyed. In August 1954, during one 
of the greatest of all floods on the Yangtse-Kiang, as 
many as 280,000 workers at a time laboured for weeks, 
progressively raising the crest of the dikes for a dis- 
tance of 85 miles. Their efforts saved three large towns— 
Hankow, Wuchang and Hanyang—from inundation. 
| EE of raising the banks with dikes, it is 
sometimes considered more advisable to deep- 
en the bed by dredging. However, it has often been found 
that the level and surface relief of the bottom conforms 
to a certain natural balance governed by the slopes and 
the solld and liquid discharges of the river. Thus, even 
after dredging the waterway eventually restores the 
former levels by depositing gravel or sand. 
In other cases, one or several river bends are lopped 
off by digging a straight channel which soon takes all 
the flow. Shortening the course Increases the slope, 
often sufficiently for the accelerated current to carve out 
a deeper bed at the bottom. This lowers the flood levels. 
as it did on the Mississippi where, after 13 bends had 
been cut off the drop was from five to ten feet between 
the confluences with the Arkansas River and the Red 
River. 
When topographical conditions allow and relatively 
limited damage is likely to be caused to existing property, 
" new beds, by-passes or diversions can be made to switch 
excessive surplus discharges away. from areas to be pro- 
tected. For example, the Sutter by-pass on one side of 
the city of Sacramento in the United States, and the 
Yolo by-pass on the other, are used during flood level 
conditions to relieve the normal bed which passes through 
the city. Again, upstream of New Orleans, the Bonnet 
Carré floodway on the right bank of the Mississippi di- 
verts substantial discharges—nearly 200,000 cubic feet 
in 1937—towards Lake Pontchartrain and the sea. 
Another flood antidote which has captured popular 
imagination is re-afforestation. However, certain aspects 
of its effects are still not sufficiently well-known, and in 
the main, the results so far obtained have been irregular 
and somewhat unpredictable. 
In one important respect, the function of re-afforesta- 
tion cannot be questioned. A good forest overburden 
will always reduce erosion and: hence the carrying away 
of solid matter. This helps to prevent the possible silting 
up of reservoirs and above all the silting of river beds 
and the rise in their level following floods. However the 
quantitative effects of re-afforestation differ immensely 
from one basin to another, depending on the interplay 
of the different factors involved, 
In the vast majority of small basins and in almost 
every situation, the effect of re-afforestation is favour- 
able, not so much on the total flood volume but on the 
maximum discharges of water. Woodland has several 
properties which tend to reduce these discharges: the 
interception of the water by branches and especlally by 
leaves and needles, the usual permeability of the soll, 
disturbed and worked over by the roots, the curbing of 
runoff by undergrowth or by wood debris. 
Woodland is sometimes completely successful in pre- 
venting rivers from becoming swollen. However its pro- 
perties are obviously most effective when dealing with 
moderate downpours, when temperatures are high and

after long periods without raln. Against heavy rain 
falling on vegetation and ground that has already been 
"soaked a forest Is virtually ineffective. 
Even when the full Impact of afforestation on floods is 
known, It should be remembered that these effects are 
more or less proportional to the percentage of wooded 
area In a particular basin. Many people, tend to forget 
that increasing the wood area from 10 to 20% or even in 
certain cases 50% wlll hardly alter the flood situation. 
And in most heavily populated and modern countries, the 
practical possibilities for retimhbering are no greater than 
these. 
A sure remedy, for floods, provided it can be applied, 
is to build dams big enough to intercept the dangerous 
discharges for as many hours or days as may be needed. 
This is the water which, if it were to flow off naturally 
beyond the reservoirs, would flood the places in need of 
protection. 
The Chinese have recently completed dams which pro- 
mise to tame the floods of the Hwai River. They have 
built an even more elaborate structure across the Yellow 
River at Sanmen, In a rocky narrows not far from the 
entry to the delta plain. The dam is 300 feet high 
with a storage capacity of 2,275,000,000,000 cubic feet. The 
most formidable maximum discharge that could be 
expected will be reduced to a fifth by the reservoir. 
In Texas, the Travis reservoir on the Colorado Rlver 
can cope 'with 84,000 million cublc feet of water which is 
more than the total volume of the worst sudden but brief 
floods which are let loose in this river basin. 
D 0ZENS and even hundreds of other examples 
could be given of Isolated or Interrelated 
reservoirs now In service which are designed to reduce the 
maximum flood discharges either permanently or In 
emergencies. Many such reservoirs exist In the Massif 
Central, in France, in the Harz Mountains and the high- 
lying areas of the Rhineland in the Federal Republic of 
. Germany and in the mountains of Bohemia. There are 
many more in Japan and in the United States. In the 
Tennessee valley network, for example, there are 27 
dams storing as much as 945,000 miillon cublc feet of 
water. And on the middle Missouri, three dams alone 
—Fort Peck, Oahe and Garrlson—would be capable of 
stopping, if necessary, more than 2,800,000,000,000 cubic 
feet which is more than the total annual discharge of 
the river. 
On many rivers quite excellent results are obtained by 
combining several methods: reservolrs, dikes, improved 
bed-lines, removal of bends, diversions and so on. In 
addition roads and rallway- tracks are moved away from 
river courses and ralsed on embankments. 
When a project for any river basin is drawn up, the 
hydrologist first has to calculate the maximum discharges 
that are likely to occur, the total volumes of water that 
may flow and the duration of the longest anticipated 
floods. He is, in fact, trying to determine the charac- 
THE DELUGE. An 11th 
century mural painting in 
the church or St. Savin-sur- 
Gartempe, France, depicts 
Noah's Ark afloat on the 
waters of the Flood. This 
deluge is described in the 
Bible, which relates that the 
the rain “was upon the 
earth for forty days and 
forty nights”, and the story 
is also told in some texts 
written in cuneiform. Tales 
of great floods are woven 
into the traditions and le- 
gends of many ancient 
peoples. Sometimes traces 
of such floods have been 
found by archaeologists. 
Archives Photographiques, Paris 
teristics of floods that are only likely to occur once every 
100, 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years or more. 
Probability computations are used for drawing up these 
forecasts based on all the past river and rainfall data 
recorded in the basin. 
Much shorter-term forecasts with precise data are 
needed by people living close to rivers that have not been 
effectively protected agalnst flooding. The inhabitants 
must be glven enough time to remove themselves and 
thelr possessions to safety. The ability to produce these 
forecasts depends on various factors: the anticipated 
time-lapse between the flood warning and the arrival 
of the flood waters; and whether the floods are caused 
by rainfall or snow or to something happening on the 
river itself. 
In the present state of scientific knowledge, it Is Im- 
possible to predict with certainty several months or weeks 
in advance that there will be a rainstorm on a given 
day or even within a given week. 
However, reasonably accurate predictions are often 
made 24 or 36 hours In advance as to whether a rainstorm 
of a certaln intensity will fall on a glven basin or not. 
But in general, it 1s not possible to say with great preci- 
slon how long the rainfall will last or what Its total 
volume and varying Intensities will be. 
The element of doubt In working out temperatures is 
much smaller and thus It is easler to know how much 
snow will melt on the next day and the following one. 
When a rainstorm has already produced flows of water 
that are liable to swell the rivers, an efficlent communica- 
tions system enables a good tentative assessment to be 
made of likely flood levels. 
The most rellable short-term {forecasts are above all 
hydrometrical. They are based on accurate Information 
from stations upstream where the discharges or levels 
have been sucessively recorded. 
In basins where extensive experience of observations 
has removed some uncertainty factors effective and even 
remarkably forecasts can be made, as In the case of the 
very heavy floods on the middle and lower Mississippi, 
where peaks of 40 to 60 feet can be predicted to within 
about four inches a fortnight or a month ahead. 
However, for places that are Invaded and devastated 
by floods within an hour or so after the end of torrentlal 
downpours of the type that occur In Texas or even In 
the Cévennes, it will still be very difflcult and sometimes 
impossible to glve warning in time In spite of Improved 
telecommunications.

HYDRAULIC 
CIVILIZATIONS

GODDESS OF THE WATERS. This 
kneeling statue is Chalchiuhtlicue, Aztec 
goddess of the waters, and a feminine 
counterpart of Tlaloc, god of the rains. 
She wears a breast-plate composed of 
four rows of green stones and a head- 
dress of sea shells—symbols of water. 
    
HE oldest civilizations of the world—ancient Egyptian, 
Sumerian, and Harappan—arose on arld lands made 
productive by great rivers whose floods moistened the parched 
ground and enriched the soil with deposits of silt; these centres of 
higher culture were situated in the Nile River valley, the alluvial 
lands between the lower courses of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and 
the area watered by the Indus River and its tributaries in Punjab 
and Sind. 
Other old, Independent growths of civilization took place either in 
desert zones—where conditions made the collection of underground 
moisture or irrigation by diversion of surface streams a prerequisite 
for agriculture—or in areas where the vagaries of rainfall—extreme 
variabllity from year to year, frequent droughts or delays in the start 
of the rainy season—brought the threat of crop fallure and 
consequent disaster to the people. : 
An example of the first of these cases is the ancient Peruvian 
civilization which, long before the Incas, attained its zenith on the 
riverine oases scattered along the Pacific coast; the second conditions 
prevall over most of China, and especially in the Huangho basin 
where Chinese civilization first blossomed, and also over the central 
Mexican Plateau which was the homeland of a civilization already 
old when the Aztecs arose to imperial power. : 
The evolution of civilization is marked by profound changes in 
economic relations and the structure of soclety, which in their turn 
have created new forms of political organization. 
Our knowledge of the early stages of development of the ancient 
civilizations is admittedly very sketchy. Recorded history—the 
keeping of annals and writing of chronicles—is one of the con- 
sequences of the expansion of intellectual horizons that goes hand- 
in-hand with the birth of civilization. Thus, the beginnings of the 
social processes that led to the transformation.can only be dimly 
perceived in the twilight of the past or else must be inferred from 
archaeological discoveries. 
N EVERTHELESS, In the examples we are concerned with here, 
in some cases these social processes certainly were, and 
in others, may well have been, closely linked with the wide-scale use 
of labour for. land improvement (land reclamation and soll conserva- 
tion) and increased food-production through intensive cultivation. 
Any doubts about this are due to lack of knowledge concerning the 
early stages of civilization in the Indus River Valley and in central 
Mexico. 
In arid lands or in areas afflicted by recurrent droughts or subject 
to catastrophic floods by the same rivers that brought them life, 
people were forced to undertake two kinds of water-works: 
productive (reservoirs, irrigation canals) and protective (dikes). 
They did so to produce sufficient food for large and stable populations, 
to obtain the surpluses needed to support the superstructure of 
civilization, and also to avert the calamity of a total loss of harvests. 
Potentially fertile but swampy alluvial lands were also reclaimed 
by means of drainage ditches or artificial gardens floating on shallow 
waters (chinampas in the lakes of central Mexico and gardens of the 
same type in the Vale of Kashmir). All this has been done since 
remote times to enlarge the areas avallable for farming. 
Although small-scale irrigation does not necessarily produce radical 
changes in farming communities—as evidenced, for example, by the

archeological record on irrigation and soclety among the prehistoric 
Hohokam people of southern Arizona (although here the failure to 
grow can be explained by the very limited water supply)—it certainly 
has potential effects on social and political development. 
Firstly, it creates landholdings with different levels of productivity, 
and thus tends to promote private ownership of improved land and 
the accumulation of wealth. Secondly, when a number of com- 
munities become dependent on the flow of the same stream, inter- 
communal competition eventually requires the establishment of 
supra-communal’ authority to allocate water-rights and to mediate 
In conflicts. 
An agricultural economy depending on small irrigation works may 
lead to the establishment of feudal societies, as happened In China 
during the Chou Dynasty (from 1100 to 250 B.C.) or in ancient Japan. 
Large scale water-works, on the other hand, require mass- 
mobilization of the labour force; hence, such projects presuppose the 
existence of a political machine with power to demand service from 
the people. 
The building of extensive canal networks In ancient Sumer 
(southern Mesopotamia) certainly post-dates the establishment of 
dynastic states and may well have taken place no earlier than the 
rise of empires. There is no available evidence that state hydraulic 
enterprises existed in Pharaonic Egypt during the Old Kingdom

INCA WATER-WORKS. In the steep 
valleys near the ancient Inca capital at 
Cuzco, in Peru, many sections of massive 
aqueducts, 50 to 70 feet high, still exist. 
The Incas built them to carry away water 
from a network of drainage canals, often 
bundreds of miles long, in a region 
.where it rains heavily for half the year. 
ROMAN AQUEDUCT. No fewer than 
30 cities of Roman Gaul were supplied 
by aqueducts. The most massive of 
all, (below) which carried water to Nimes, 
still stands astride the River Gard, a 
tributary of the Rhone, in southern 
France. It was built in 20 B.C. (the 
time of Augustus Caesar). It is 880 feet 
long and rises 157 feet above the valley.

period; the first recorded undertaking of this kind was the linkage of 
the Nlle to the Fayum depression, so as to use Lake Moerls as a 
reservoir to regulate the floods, under the Twelfth Dynasty. In 
ancient China, historians agree that construction of large-scale 
water-works did not begin until the Perlod of the Warring States 
(481-255 B.C.), when Chinese civilization was already one thousand 
years old. 
" To understand the processes involved in the growth of hydraulic 
socleties it 1s worthwhile to note that the development of water- 
control in China at that time is linked to the technical revolution 
brought about by the appearance of iron tools, the use of oxen to pull 
the plough, and the Increasing practice of manuring the fields to 
sustain fertility. 
The greater productivity of agricultural labour led to the dis- 
integration of the feudal system and stimulated the growth of private 
land ownership; the breakdown of feudal bonds left a mass of former 
peasant-serfs liable to be drafted for the construction of public 
works. At the end of this period of development, the opening of the 
Chengkuo Canal in 246 B.C. brought prosperity to central Shensi and 
gave the King of Ch'in power to subjugate the rival feudal states, 
thus achieving imperial unification of the country. 
Goyeee management of large scale water-works led to 
the development of a bureaucracy and the dependence of 
the subject classes upon it. The term “hydraulic clvillzations” 
refers specifically to those states whose social structures were shaped 
by these forces. 
The Increase of water-control and the development of hydraulic 
socleties appear to be reciprocal processes and the fact has long been 
recognized. The connexion between farmers' dependence on water- 
works and the structure of society was remarked on by Pedro de 
Cleza de Leon, one of the Spanish conquistadores of the northern 
Andean region of South America. Cleza noted the contrast, on the 
one hand, between the submissiveness of the clvillzed Peruvian 
Indians, long used to obeying masters and paying taxes, and the easy 
downfall of the powerful Inca Empire and on the other, the rebellious 
character of the uncivilized tribes of Colombia who long resisted 
colonization. The reason for this, writes Cieza in his description 
of these peoples (first printed at Seville in 1553) is that the Colombian 
tribes never had centralized political organization, were unused to. 
servitude and depended on rainfarming. When harried by the 
Spaniards, they easily escaped to the bush where new clearings 
allowed them to raise their crops and live free from outside inter- 
ference. 
On the desert Peruvian coast, the chronicler continues, men were 
bound by nature. to the riverine oases, and agriculture depended on 
the state-controlled Irrigation systems. Restrictive geographical 
conditions also prevalled In the Andean highlands, where the crops 
grown on terraced mountainsides relled on water conveyed by 
elaborate systems of aqueducts; hence, the Indians could not rebel 
without risking their means of livelihood. - 
Another example is anclent China where public hydraulic enter- 
prises undertaken at the closing of the feudal era played a paramount 
role in creating economic bases for political domination. These in 
turn led to imperial unification. Chinese historians of the ensuing 
period (Han dynasty) ‘were thus well aware of the relationships 
between state-power and water-control. Some perceptive observations 
on this subject are found in the Book of the Earlier Han (Ch’ien-han 
Shu) which was given its final form by the Chinese historian, Pan 
Ku, who lived from 32 A.D. to 92 A.D. 
Modern theoretical analysis of hydraulic civilizations owes its 
beginning to students of society and culture, and since the early 
1930's, some distinguished researchers have produced studies 
analyzing the structure of these communities, describing the 
processes of their development, and explaining their role in social 
evolution. 
  
PEDRO ARMILLAS, Mexican historian, archeologist and ethnologist, is a 
leading specialist in the pre-Columbian history of the Americas. He 
is now working for the Anthropological Museum of Michigan, U.S.A., 
for whom he has carried out numerous archeological excavations in 
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

Letters to the Editor 
COLOUR FOR THE UNESCO COURIER 
 
Sir, 
Congratulations on your excellent issue 
of May 1964 with its articles on juvenile 
delinquency and on Galileo. I hope that 
the lives and work of other great men 
will be given an equally fine presentation 
in future numbers. 
There is something else I have been 
thinking about for some time. You have 
covered subjects such as the stained glass 
of Rheims cathedral and the art treasures 
of Nubia in past issues as well as astro- 
nomy in your May issue. I feel sure 
that all these first-rate numbers would have 
been greatly enriched by the inclusion of 
a full colour plate. 
In view of your large circulation I am 
sure that the cost of such an innovation 
would not call for a very large increase 
in your subscription rate. Many people, 
like myself, would welcome this added 
feature. THE UNEsco COURIER, a magazine 
of world standing, would be even more 
appreciated and treasured by its readers. 
Georges Forcinal 
Bron, France 
Ed. Note: The Unesco Courier will 
introduce full colour pages on a regular 
basis with the January 1965 issue. See 
announcement back cover. 
CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY 
  
Sir, 
I greatly enjoyed your issue on “The Art 
of Writing” (March 1964). However, I 
feel that such a vast subject deserved an 
additional half-page or so devoted to bib- 
liographical sources. Do you know of 
any works dealing especially with Chinese 
and Japanese ideograms and Chinese, Japa- 
nese and Arabic calligraphy and particularly 
from an aesthetic point of view? I have 
already read Etiemble's book, “Writing”, 
published by Editions Delpierre, Paris. 
Paul Robert 
Sceaux, France 
Ed. Note : The general bibliography pub- 
lished in our March issue listed several 
works of interest to the general reader. 
These, in turn, furnished a much more 
comprehensive and varied bibliography on 
the subject of writing. For Chinese writing 
we recommend “Chinese Calligraphy” by 
Chiang Yee, published by Methuen and 
Co., London. There are many other books 
on these subjets, but most of them have 
been published in China or Japan and are 
in the languages of these countries. 
CALLING ALL SCHOOLS 
 
Sir, 
I am one of a small group of teachers 
in Liege who have been carrying out a 
programme of their own creation for the 
past year, Though in no way inspired by 
official directives, it is none the less closely 
and vitally linked with our vocation as 
teachers. Broadly its purpose could be 
summed up as “fellowship with all men”. 
Each month we choose a subject from the 
pages of THE UNEsco COURIER to introduce 
in our classes. Several of these themes— 
racism, hunger in the world, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights—have been 
of the greatest value to the children we 
teach. 
This year we are concentrating on 
another aspect: international correspon- 
dence between schools. We wish to make 
contact with a network or correspondents 
from schools in all parts of the world. 
Can you help us ? "We can cover postage 
costs from the resources of our school 
co-operative and take care of the problem 
of translations—at least in three main 
languages of world communication: 
English, Spanish and German. Our children 
are aged from 11 to 14 and all come from 
working class homes. Our address is 44 
Avenue Reine Elizabeth, Liége, Belgium.

WHEN SPORT GETS OF FOCUS . 
Sir, 
M. Maheu’s timely address “Sport is 
Education” has created a great deal of 
interest in New Zealand. Apparently, only 
extracts of it appeared in THE UNESCO 
Courier (Jan. 1964) and in commenting 
on parts of it, one runs the risk of quoting 
out of context. However, the topic is 
of such importance that the risk must be 
taken. 
Most people will agree that Pierre de 
Coubertin went too far in claiming that 
the modern Olympics should be considered 
a religion. Fortunately, this has not 
happened yet at Olympic level, but in 
some countries, enthusiasm for certain 
sports bears the hallmarks of religious 
fervour. Often, the hold on the human 
personality is such that one particular 
game, and the competition that supports 
it, is almost the sole topic of conversation 
all year round. This commitment to a 
sport is very close to fanaticism. Once 
having, as it were, stepped on the sports’ 
stage, some people are psychologically 
incapable of stepping off it again. Surely 
this is sport out of focus? ’ 
Sport is important, and has been so 
since homo sapiens freed himself from 
the burden of unremitting toil. The 
individual's biological need for physical 
activity must be met, and sport is a 
superlative way of doing this. Nevertheless, 
it is not as important as feeding hungry 
people, promoting better human relation- 
ships, eliminating war, curing cancer or 
any one of a hundred other pressing 
human needs. Too often, it seems, skill 
and success in sport are elevated above 
attitudes. To me the latter include not 
only the conventional postures about sports- 
manship, but also a true evaluation of 
sport as play and recreation—something 
apart, bound by special rules, truly 
significant and meaningful to the par- 
ticipant—but part of the world of play, 
of make-believe, not to be confused with 
the larger world of reality. 
Except with children, this play-world 
can never be as real or as important as 
the larger world outside the arena. When 
it is so regarded, the image is distorted. 
The article mentions the element of 
truce. As far as we know, the truce of 
Ophites and Lycurgus was honoured by 
athlete and spectator alike and the only 
criterion was athletic ability. But in recent 
years we have seen, in some international 
competition, something very near the 
substitution of one kind of conflict for 
another. When this happens, sport divides 
people instead of uniting them. In 
expounding the ideal we should not close 
our eyes to the reality. 
In Malaya, where there is difficulty in 
uniting four peoples—English, Chinese, 
Malays and Tamils—into one nation, sport 
is being used as a universal medium of 
education. In the schools this is showing 
great promise. Children learn quickly to 
appreciate good performance and conduct, 
regardless of race and language. It will 
be interesting to see if sport exercises the 
same influence at adult level, where 
ideals are not so important when emotions 
   
run hot. Even so, the simple fact that 
sport is being used deliberately to bring 
different peoples closer together is further 
recognition of the validity of de Cou- 
bertin’s philosophy. 
Sport is character education. This part 
of the talk must have. been severely 
condensed for, without explanation, it 
appears trite and overworked. In this 
context, character and sportsmanship are 
rarely defined. We seem to be on 
reasonably sure ground when we discuss the 
play of children for it is play that does 
most to develop group and social 
consciousness in them. ~~ This happens 
because fairness and obedience to rules 
are not just verbal concepts to children. 
They become a kind of living, organic 
morality. 
Even so, there is an element of self- 
ishness in this. The group interest 
gradually becomes the child’s interest and 
a social being is created. Whatever changes 
may have been effected in the child's 
attitudes and character during this process, 
it is still his own interest that is being 
served. He has, however, adapted it to 
the group. 
When adolescence is reached, attitudes 
to rules, fairness and appropriate conduct 
become more particularized and may vary 
between one sport and another. The codes 
are not all equally observed. It is here

that we begin to have doubts about sport 
and character with some participants. If 
the code serves their interests (e.g. winning) 
then it is obeyed. If it does not serve their 
interests, it may still be obeyed because 
of the social pressures of team maics, 
opponents and spectators, but if it can be 
broken without censure, this often happens. 
Is it a virtue to observe a code of 
behaviour under pressure? 
My contention here is that it is too 
easy and often erroneous to generalize 
about sport and character, especially among 
adults. Perhaps its greatest contribution 
in adult life is self-discovery, the sometimes 
shattering revelation of one's true status. 
This still leaves wide open the whole 
question of whether sportsmen generalize 
what they learn on the sports field. Some 
do. Others don’t. And in any case, games 
are worth playing for their own sake, 
regardless of moral, public or character 
values. 
It is difficult for some educators to 
appreciate the importance of sport as 
culture. Some intellectuals believe that 
attending a Shakespearean drama is a 
cultural experience whereas attending a 
game is beneath the notice of an intelligent 
person. Is the mime of the sports field 
any less cultural than the sound of the 
stage? Is the drama any less intense? 
Roles in both circumstances have been 
created externally——the one by an author, 
the other by an authority. In some ways 
the stage is much more circumscribed 
than the field, the action more severely 
restricted and with less creative oppor- 
tunity. Many sports events outdo ballet 
in complexity and beauty of action. Top 
levels in both require dedication of a high 
order. Does the mass appeal of one 
cultural form degrade it? 
Movement was a universal language 
long before the first word was spoken and 
it speaks even more eloquently in the 
trained and refined action of the modern 
athlete. It is hard to understand why 
seeing the young Hamlet carelessly killing 
Polonius should be a cultural experience 
and seeing Valerie Brumel clearing seven 
feet should not. Motive and plot are 
deeper and more devious in the former 
and elemental passions are more acutely 
involved. Does treason, murder and 
revenge make Hamlet a cultural drama? 
Does simplicity of purpose and absence of 
passion make the drama of the high jump 
any. less cultural ? Many believe that 
skill and perfection of controlled bodily 
movement are among the most beautiful 
of human accomplishments. 
Culture is not the sovereign right of any 
group of disciplines. In this context it is 
surely the complete mastery of some skill, 
whether this be the perfect manipulation 
of a musical instrument, the vocal facility 
of a prima donna, the histrionic ability 
of the actor, the craft of an accomplished 
writer or the kinesthetic intelligence of the 
pole vaulter. And if it is “cultural” to 
watch the one, it is surely “cultural” to 
watch the other. Much so-called “cultural” 
experience comes from watching, provided 
always that there is real understanding at 
the same time, 
The vexed question of amateurism is a 
difficult one and many would wish to 
have ideas as clear cut and definite as 
these in the UNEsco COURIER article. 
Undoubtedly, it is time the practical issues 
of the situation were faced. Practices vary 
so much from one sport to another. What 
is condoned in one is condemned in 
another and this needs tidying up. But 
we should be aware, as far as possible, 
of all the implications of paying athletes 
and games players. Immediately, the sports 
concept of Plato “for nothing but the 
sheer pleasure of doing it”, is at an end. 
Payment removes sport from the play 
element in culture and turns it into work. 
If players must be paid, so be it, but this 
will, in turn, alter the whole nature of 
sport and some other name may have to 
be found for it. 
M. Maheu says that the concepts of 
Pierre de Coubertin related to a social 
situation and a stage in the technical 
development of sport which are now out 
of date and that the new conditions must 
be faced. It might be salutary to remind 
ourselves that sportsmen are under no 
compulsion to enter expensive and time- 
consuming activities, nor to provide large- 
scale spectacles for public amusement. 
There are many interesting and worth- 
while sports which cost very little in 
either time or money. Might it not turn 
out that the Olympic Games itself has 
become too large, too unwieldy, too 
expensive and too closely allied with 
national prestige and that this is the major 
factor to be faced, not a fundamental 
alteration In the rules of amateur sport. 
Can it be that the Games are not worth 
the toil, sweat, trouble and expense and 
that much more good could be accomplish- 
ed by small exchanges of sportsmen 
between different countries? 
No student. of history can fail to have 
some misgivings at the suggested intro- 
duction of professionalism into the Olympic 
arena. It seems inevitable if the Games 
are to continue, but it will certainly spell 
the end of sport as we have known it 
for the past fifty years.

THE NEW NATIONS 
Sir, 
May I compliment you on the excellent 
presentation and contents of THE UNESCO 
Courier. However, I should like to support 
one of your Soviet correspondents, 
Anatoly Chetverikov, in asking you to 
publish articles on the nations which have 
come into being in recent years and parti- 
cularly those in Africa. The daily press 
tells us very little about them, and I for 
one would like to know more about their 
ways of life, their resources, their state 
of civilization and what UNEsco is doing to 
help their development.

GUIDE FOR READERS 
 
Sir, 
A collection of issues of THE UNEsco 
COURIER is a veritable encyclopaedia which 
presents to its readers a panorama of the 
work, the resources and the problems of 
the world, particularly in the context of 
modern times. But this fine source of 
documentary material and cultural know- 
ledge should be made into a still more 
handy tool. One should be able to trace 
immediately any article it publishes or any 
subject it deals with without having to 
thumb through a pile of back numbers. 
A list published annually of the contents of 
each issue would solve this problem and 
would also provide a classification of 
contents by subject. With this innovation 
Tue Unesco Courier would add to its 
reputation and far greater and more fruitful 
use would be made of the rich store of 
facts which it offers readers. 
René Barb 
Montpellier, France 
Ed. note : The possibility of publishing 
an index for THE UNESCO COURIER covering 
the years 1957-1963 is at present being 
studied, Readers will be informed as soon 
as this project has been completed. We 
would remind our correspondent that an 
index of contents published in 1963 
appeared in our December 1963 issue. 
MARTIN-LUTHER UNIVERSITY 
Sir, 
The credit for the photograph with the 
article “A Family of Asian Scripts” (March 
1964 issue, page 18) of a plaque found in 
the Indus Valley reads *Archaeological 
Seminary of the University of Halle, Federal 
Republic of Germany.” The city of Halle, 
however, is in Eastern Germany, not the 
Federal Republic of Germany. The uni- 
versity's full name is *“‘Martin-Luther-Uni- 
versitat, Halle-Wittenberg, in Halle (Saale).”

WORLD SOIL SURVEY 
 
Sir, 
In THE UN~Eesco Courier, (April 1964) 
there are extremely interesting articles on 
bacilli and the successful fight against the 
many ills man is heir to. Consequently 
world populace grows apace. What about 
food? 
Astronomical sums of money are spent 
on defence by East and West. What is 
done to halt the ever diminishing area (by 
erosion) of cultivatable soil on which human 
life depends? This problem needs greater 
attention than ever before. 
Could a world survey on this very urgent 
problem be a subject for a future number ? 
Shortage of food increases tuberculosis and 
halts the progress of man in many peaceful 
directions.

From the Unesco News 
JB COKS FOR ALL: The world's book 
production is today concentrated in - 
ten countries and 70% of all translations 
are made from only four languages— 
English, Russian, French and German— 
declared M. René Maheu, Director-General 
of UNEsco, addressing the Second Inter- 
national Congress of Booksellers, which met 
in Unesco House, in June, M, Maheu added 
that the technical revolution which had 
made possible low-cost book production on 
a mass scale must now be extended to 
developing countries. 
ALINGA PRIZE FOR INDIAN 
WRITER: Jagjit Singh, science wri- 
ter and adviser on operational research to 
the Indian Government, has been selected 
as the 12th winner of the international 
Kalinga Prize for the popularization of 
science. Awarded by an international jury 
appointed by Unesco, the Kalinga Prize is 
a personal donation of Bijoyanand Patnaik, 
an Indian industrialist who is a director of 
the Kalinga Foundation in India. Jagjit

KIERKEGAARD CENTENARY 
Young people crowd the aisles in 
the packed conference hall at Unesco 
House, Paris, during the international 
colloquy marking the close of the 
Kierkegaard Centenary celebrations 
in April. The debt which modern 
philosophy owes to the great Danish 
thinker was underlined by Mr. René 
Maheu, Director-General of Unesco 
in his opening address and by inter- 
nationally-known philosophers such 
as Jean Paul Sartre, Jean Wahl, Enzo 
Pace and Gabriel Marcel who spoke 
at these meetings. The work of 
Kierkegaard, the centenary of whose 
birth was celebrated during 1963, 
and its impact on contemporary think- 
Ing were also evoked during a 
series of round table discussions.     
  
Singh was awarded the prize for his scien- 
tific writings, and in particular for those 
dealing with fundamental theories of cos- 
mology, relativity and space time and 
astrophysics. 
UPPETERS’ RENDEZ-VOUS: Twenty 
amateur puppet theatre companies 
from different countries met in Karl- 
ovy Vary Spa, Czechoslovakia, recent- 
ly for an International Puppet Festival. 
Groups from Great Britain, Australia, 
Bulgaria, France, Yugoslavia, Hungary, the 
Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet 
Union and Czechoslovakia, among others, 
gave performances and took part in dis- 
cussions on the art of the puppeteer during 
a four-day festival conference. 
ROBING THE BLACK CURRENT: 
A new venture in co-operative re- 
search at sea has been launched by the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commis- 
sion. Meeting at UNesco House in June 
the Commission approved plans for the 
study of the Kuroshio Current (its name 
is Japanese and means “black current”) 
in the northwest Pacific. Vessels from 
six or seven nations will investigate this 
current, whose variations are believed to 
influence fishing conditions and the weather 
in this part of the Pacific. 
‘MOOTHING TV'S ROAD: Efforts to 
pave the way for systematic devel- 
opment of television services in Africa will 
be reviewed at a UNESCO meeting in Lagos, 
Nigeria, in September. Directors of na- 
tional TV and broadcasting organizations 
and other specialists will examine the prob- 
lems of organization, technology and 
finance which are posed by the launching 
of TV in Africa and will discuss how TV 
can contribute to social, educational and 
cultural development. 
NESCO’S MONUMENTS CAM- 
PAIGN: One June 2, Unesco launched 
a six-months’ international campaign for the 
preservation of historical monuments. Hail- 
ing UNESCO's campaign as “an outstanding 
contribution to the preservation of the 
world’s cultural legacy,” President Johnson 
of the U.S.A. pledged his country’s 
wholehearted support for it. 
TEACHER'S CHARTER: Since 1963 
UnEsco and the International Labour 
Organization have made a joint study of 
the status of teachers, a problem that 
affects all educational planning. A further 
step towards the elaboration of a charter 
for teachers was taken recently when an 
international committee of specialists, meet- 
ing at Unesco House, drew up recommen- 
dations concerning its scope and content. 
These referred to the appointment and 
working conditions of teachers, their rela- 
tions with education services and their 
rights and duties. The draft charter will 
be submitted to an intergovernmental 
conference in 1966. 
NESCO PLANS FOR 1965-66: 
UxEesco’s proposed programme for 
1965-66 calls for a budget of $47,460,000. 
  
This draft programme, presented to the 
Unesco Executive Board when it met 
during May and June by M. René Maheu, 
UNESCO'S Director-General, maintains 
UNESCO's priority ‘on education but also 
calls for a substantial increase in scientific 
activities, The programme and budget will 
be submitted to UNnesco’s General Con- 
ference which meets in Paris in October 
and November. 
ACE RELATIONS IN AFRICA: For 
the first time in UNEsco’s history, 
a specialist in race relations has been sent 
into the field at the request of a member 
state—in this case the United Kingdom. The 
specialist chosen is Mr. Kenneth Kirkwood, 
since 1955 Rhodes Professor of Race Rela- 
tions at Oxford University, who will occupy 
the newly-created chair of race relations at 
University College, Salisbury, Southern 
Rhodesia. In this post he will study and 
do research work into the entire problem 
of race relationships in Africa. 
ROTECTING CULTURAL PRO- 
PERTY: Measures to prohibit and 
prevent illicit export, import and sale of 
cultural property have been proposed by 
a committee of specialists from 30 countries 
which met recently in UNEsco House. The 
action proposed includes the drawing up of 
national inventories of cultural property, 
protection measures, international agree- 
ments for the restitution of illegally expor- 
ted objects, and provisions for a bona fide 
purchaser of illegally exported property to 
obtain damages or compensation. These 
recommendations will be presented to 
UNesco’s General Conference in October.

bility,” at Unesco’'s H. Q. in Paris. 
BW Through the intermediary of Unesco, the 
International Development Association has 
extended a credit equivalent to $4.6 million 
to enable Tanganyika to build two sec- 
ondary schools and extend and equip 
53 others. 
B Under an agreement between the 
Moroccan Government and Unesco an 
administrative training and research centre 
for African development will be opened in 
Tangiers at the end of this year. 
BM During recent oceanographic research in
