Two months ago the Unesco Courier devoted a 
special issue to Australia, ayoung nation celebrating 
its bicentennial. This issue is given over to a country 
which is heir to one of the world’s oldest 
civilizations. 
The second most populous nation on Earth, India 
is a vast and multifarious land which encompasses 
desert and fertile soil, the towering Himalayas and 
tropical lowlands, mighty rivers, great cities and 
villages without number. Over 800 million 
people—perhaps one sixth of humanity—speak 
some 180 languages including 14 major ones. 
For many readers India will evoke images of 
ancient customs and omnipresent religions: Hindus 
bathing en masse in a sacred river, ascetic holy men 
praying by the roadside, caparisoned elephants 
joining in temple festivals, villages where the gods 
are worshipped as familiars. But side by side with 
these timeless scenes a modern India is growing. 
Industrialization has made great strides in a country 
which today manufactures ber own cars and has her 
own steel mills, fertilizer plants, atomic power 
stations and heavy engineering industry. To sustain 
her economic development she has one of the 
world’s largest networks of scientists and 
technicians. Yet today, like many nations, India 
faces difficult problems, especially perhaps the risk 
that the benefits from her considerable economic 
achievements in industry and food production will 
be spread more and more thinly because of 
demographic growth—the population is estimated 
to have increased by 18 million in 1986 alone. 
In the four decades since Independence India has 
made unsparing efforts to improve living standards 
and become a modern democratic nation while 
preserving her linguistic, cultural and ethnic wealth 
and diversity. Within the limited editorial space at 
our disposal, this issue attempts to reflect the many 
facets of this situation and bring to readers a glimpse 
of what is happening in this vast and dynamic 
subcontinent. 
The Editors of the Unesco Courier wish to thank the Indian writer and 
journalist Vaiju Mahindroo for her help in the preparation of this issue.

BY VISHWANATH S. NARAVANE 
HE development of Indian cul- 
ture can be compared to the 
progress of a river from its 
Himalayan home, through forests and 
wastelands, orchards and farms, villages 
and cities. The river assimilates the waters 
of many tributaries, its environment 
changes, yet it remains the same. Indian 
culture shows a similar combination of 
unity and diversity, continuity and 
change. In the course of her long histo- 
ry, India has witnessed many changes, 
made many adjustments, and assimilated 
elements from many sources, without 
breaking the continuity. 
India is a land of varied landscapes and 
climates, of many races, religions, lan- 
guages and cultures. But they all have an 
unmistakably Indian flavour. The source 
of this unity is elusive. It can be felt, but 
it defies analysis. In his famous book, Dis- 
covery of India, Jawaharlal Nehru gave a 
sensitive and fascinating account of his 
search for the unity at the root of India’s 
amazing diversity. 
The Indus Valley civilization 
(3000-1800 BC) shows anticipations of 
ideas and art-forms later regarded as typi- 
cally Indian. This is clear from the ar- 
tefacts yielded during excavations at 
Harappa and Mohenjodaro. A statue of 
a man in meditation suggests the practice 
of Yoga. The smooth surfaces of a male 
torso in stone suggests, by its absence of 
muscular tension, the classical Indian con- 
cept of inward energy. A deity depicted 
on a clay seal is very similar to some later 
images of Shiva. And a little copper 
dancing-girl wears bangles of a kind that 
can be purchased today at a wayside 
bazaar in India. Recent research has 
shown that the influence of this culture

extended to distant regions of northern 
and western India, and that the Indus Val- 
ley people had close contacts with the 
Dravidian civilization which flourished in 
southern India long before the coming of 
the Aryans. 
Some time between 2000 and 1600 
BC, a branch of the vast Aryan family, 
usually referred to as Indo-Aryans, 
migrated to India. They brought with 
them the Sanskrit language, and a religion 
based on sacrificial ritual honouring dei- 
ties symbolizing elemental forces of Na- 
ture, such as Indra, god of rain and 
thunder, Agni (Fire) and Varuna, lord of 
the seas, rivers and seasons. Hymns ad- 
dressed to these and other deities were 
collected in the four Vedas. The oldest of 
the Vedas is the Rigveda (1500-1200 BC) 
in which there is a quest for the Supreme 
Reality underlying all multiplicity. This 
trend was strengthened in the dialogues 
of the Upanishads (900-600 BC). Vedic 
poetry is marked by lofty ideas, literary 
beauty and a movement from external 
ritual to inward experience. 
Two religions outside the Vedic tra- 
dition emerged in the sixth century BC. 
The Buddha’s personality, and his emz ha- 
sis on love, compassion and harmony, 
profoundly influenced Indian thought 
and culture, though Buddhism as an or- 
ganized religion struck deeper roots out- 
side India. Jainism, founded by Mahavira, 
stressed truth and non-violence, and made 
significant contributions to Indian art and 
philosophy. 
In 326 BC, Alexander of Macedon 
crossed the Indus and won a decisive bat- 
tle. Although he soon turned back, his 
invasion influenced Indian culture by in- 
itiating contacts with the Graeco-Roman 
world. Six years later, Chandragupta 
Maurya tried to unite the scattered 
kingdoms and republics of India in a cen- 
tralized empire, with the capital at 
Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar). His 
grandson, Ashoka (reigned 273-237 BC), 
recoiling from the horrors of war, be- 
came an ardent Buddhist. The message of 
compassion and gentleness was inscribed 
on rocks and highly polished stone 
columns. The capitals surmounting the 
columns are fine pieces of sculpture. 
Kings of the Shunga dynasty (185-149 
BC) were orthodox Hindus, but there 
was a strong Buddhist revival under 
Kanishka, the Kushan king who ruled in 
north-western India (78-101 AD). The 
Gandhara style of Buddhist sculpture,

strongly influenced by Graeco-Roman 
art, developed under the Kushans. 
Another centre of Buddhist art was 
Mathura (south of Delhi). 
Pataliputra again became the centre of 
political and cultural activity during the 
Gupta Empire (319-540 AD), which has 
been described as the golden age of 
ancient Indian culture. Some of the 
Gupta kings, such as Chandragupta and 
Skandagupta, were poets and musicians. 
Kalidasa, greatest among Sanskrit poets 
and dramatists, lived during the reign of 
Chandragupta. The Buddha images of 
Sarnath, and the frescoes painted in the 
caves of Ajanta in western India, are 
among the artistic masterpieces of this 
age. The decline of the Gupta Empire was 
followed by political fragmentation. King 
Harsha of Kannauyj tried to stem this 
process, but after his death in 648 AD in- 
dependent kingdoms arose in Kashmir, 
Bengal, Orissa and many other regions of 
southern as well as northern India. 
Culturally, this was a very rich peri- 
od. The Cholas, Pallavas and Rashtraku- 
tas of south India built the superb temples 
at Tanjore, Mamallapuram and Ellora. 
The Sun Temple of Konarak in Orissa 
and the Shiva Temple at Khajuraho in 
Central India were built in the eleventh 
century. In all these temples, sculpture is 
an integral part of the architecture. In 
literature, Sanskrit was gradually being 
replaced by regional languages such as 
Bengali, Marathi, Hindi and Punjabi. In 
the south, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada 
had developed their literary traditions. 
The Vedanta philosophies of Shankara 
(eighth century) and Ramanuja (twelfth 
century) exerted a deep influence. There

was, however, a conservative trend in so- 
cial and religious life. The caste system, 
originally based on differences of apti- 
tude, became rigid and oppressive. 
The establishment of Muslim rule at 
the end of the twelfth century was a turn- 
ing point in India’s cultural history. An 
initial period of conflict was inevitable be- 
cause of the radical differences between 
Hinduism and Islam. But a process of ac- 
commodation soon started. Sufi mysti- 
cism, philosophically close to Vedanta, 
was one of the meeting points. Many 
Muslim kings, at Delhi and in regional 
kingdoms, were patrons of Indian litera- 
ture and music, and participated in Hin- 
du festivals. After the foundation of the 
Mughal Empire (1526 AD) the trend 
towards integration was strengthened. 
Under the wise and tolerant rule of Ak- 
bar (1556-1605) the foundation of a na- 
tional culture was firmly laid. The Hindu 
and Muslim traditions, while retaining 
their distinct identities, influenced each 
other deeply. 
Islamic architecture in India was at 
first austere and simple. But the builders

Greek presence in India led to the 
development of the famous Gandhara school 
of art. This Gandhara head dates back to the 
Kushan period between AD 78 and 144, 
  
soon started adopting decorative ele- 
ments, including the lotus motif, from 
Hindu temples. Conversely, many tem- 
ples built in medieval India have Islamic 
features, such as the dome, the arch and 
screens carved of stone and marble. Indi- 
an architecture reached its apex during 
the reign of Shah Jahan (1627-1658), who 
built such masterpieces as the Pearl 
Mosque at Agra and the Taj Mahal, “the 
dream in-marble”. 
In painting, too, there was a blend of 
the two traditions. Inspired by Bihzad 
and other great Persian artists, painters 
at the Mughal court created a new style 
of miniature painting. Combining the 
technique and subtlety of this style with 
the religious and aesthetic spirit of India, 
painters of the Rajput School made their 
own distinctive contribution. 
One of the greatest geniuses of 
medieval India was Amir Khusrau: poet, 
musician, linguist. He invented several in- 
struments played in classical Indian 
music. His poetical experiments led to the 
emergence of Urdu, one of the major 
Indian languages. The sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries were exceptional- 
ly rich in devotional poetry in regional 
languages. Nanak, the founder of 
Sikhism, Tulsidas, whose Hindi version 
of the Ramayana epic is recited and read 
by millions even today, Kabir, whose 
poetry transcended all sectarian 
differences—these and other saint-poets 
preached a universal religion based on 
tolerance and love. 
The Mughal Empire declined rapidly 
during the first quarter of the eighteenth 
century. Meanwhile, Europeans were 
making inroads into India: the Por- 
tuguese, the Dutch, the French, and final- 
ly the British who emerged victorious. By 
the end of the eighteenth century, Brit- 
ish authority was firmly established. The 
introduction of English education and the 
work of Christian missionaries had a deep 
impact on the cultural and religious life 
of India. Calcutta, the new capital, be- 
came the centre of Western thought, fol- 
lowed by Bombay and Madras. Some 
educated Indians, in their excessive zeal 
for European culture, turned away from 
their own heritage. But a reform move-

ushered in a spiritual and cultural renais- 
sance. The leaders of this movement, 
known as the Brahmo Samaj, stressed the 
deeper truths of Hindu and Muslim scrip- 
tures, while accepting progressive ele- 
ments from Western thought. Another 
source of inspiration was Shri Rama- 
krishna (1836-1886), who regarded differ- 
ent religions as paths leading to the same 
goal, and his famous disciple, Swami 
Vivekananda (1863-1902), who is remem- 
bered as India’s first spiritual and cultur- 
a] ambassador to Europe and America. 
Though politically subjugated, Indian 
culture retained its dynamism. In the lat- 
ter half of the nineteenth century, politi- 
cal, historical and social themes were 
taken up by novelists and dramatists. 
Ghalib, the great Urdu poet, and Bankim 
Chatterji, the Bengali novelist, made rich 
contributions to Indian literature. Out- 
standing musicians, many of whom were 
Muslims, kept alive the tradition of clas- 
sical Indian music. The kathak school of 
dance was developed at Lucknow and Jai- 
pur. Later, there was a renaissance in In-

was gaining strength. The sense of patri- 
otism thus aroused was reflected in the 
literature of that age. When Mahatma 
Gandhi returned to India, after his heroic 
struggle against racism in South Africa, 
a new chapter was opened in India’s life.

the greatest writers of that period—

Indian culture in the twentieth centu-

of Rabindranath Tagore, one of the 
greatest poet-philosophers in world his- 
tory. Tagore left the stamp of his perso- 
nality and work on every field of 
creativity: poetry, music, drama, novel 
and short story, even painting. He was 
the first non-Western writer to be award- 
ed the Nobel Prize for Literature. He 
founded the international university, 
Vishwa-Bharati, and anticipated many 
modern concepts in education. An entire 
generation of Indian writers and artists 
was influenced by Tagore. Gandhi and 
Tagore are rightly regarded as the mak- 
ers of modern India.

On 15 August 1947, India became an 
independent nation. Thus, in Jawaharlal 
Nehru’s words, India had “kept her tryst 
with destiny” after a century of struggle. 
The partition of the country on the ba- 
sis of religion, the bloodshed that fol- 
lowed, and then the assassination of 
Mahatma Gandhi, were painful shocks. 
But the trauma was soon overcome and 
India began building her future as a sover- 
eign country taking her rightful place in 
the community of nations. 
Since independence, India has made 
significant progress in many areas of cul- 
ture. In almost all the fourteen major lan- 
guages of India (fifteen including English), 
creative literature of the highest order has 
been produced. Satyajit Ray is recognized 
as one of the greatest film directors in the 
world. In classical music, Ravi Shankar 
and Ali Akbar Khan; in painting Jamini 
Ray and M.F. Hussain; in classical dance, 
Balasarasvati—these are only a few among 
the outstanding artists who have enriched 
Indian culture in recent decades. 
Selectivity, assimilation and adjust- 
ment have characterized Indian culture 
throughout its long history. It has con- 
fronted and overcome many periods of 
crisis and uncertainty. Today there are 
new challenges, demanding new adjust- 
ments. Ours is the age of science and tech- 
nology. How to preserve whatever is of 
enduring worth in the spiritual and aes- 
thetic tradition that has stood the test of 
fifty centuries, and how to reinterpret 
that tradition in the contemporary con- 
text: that is the question which the 
thinkers, artists and writers of India have 
to deal with. Their ability to handle this 
task in a balanced and imaginative man- 
ner will determine the future course of 
Indian culture. [|

### 82209: Makers of modern India

MAKERS OF 
MODERN INDIA 
  
Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869-1948), 
the architect of India’s struggle for 
independence through non-violent 
disobedience to British rule. 
AHATMA Gandhi was the 
foremost leader of the Indian 
independence movement; and 
one of his great qualities was to secure and 
retain the devotion of persons of differ- 
ing temperaments but all of very great 
distinction. Of these, three leading figures 
were Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarvepalli Rad- 
hakrishnan and Maulana Abul Kalam 
Azad. 
Educated in Britain, Nehru was drawn 
to Gandhi because he felt that while 
others talked Gandhi was primarily a 
man of action who was making a dent on 
British rule. Nehru accepted Gandhi’s 
method of non-violence, first as a useful 
weapon against the British and then, af- 
ter the atom bombs of 1945, as 2a means 
without an alternative. He saw the valid- 
ity of Marx’s analysis of historical change 
but did not believe that such change can 
only be brought about by force. The class 
war could not be denied but it could be 
resolved by persuasion. In the freedom 
movement, Nehru realized that, while 
Gandhi had brought the peasants into the 
political campaign, to retain their interest 
and support the Indian National Con- 
gress should have an economic 
programme. In this sense he is a pioneer 
of modern, twentieth-century na- 
tionalism. 
Once Gandhi had brought other class- 
es into the independence movement, it 
became Nehru’s task to hold the various 
classes together by taking account of the 
basic economic needs of the vast majori- 
ty of the Indian people. So Nehru 
promised that, when freedom had been 
won, the free government of India would 
give priority to economic development 
and the promotion of social justice. Even 
before the departure of the British, Nehru 
made the Indian people conscious of the 
importance of planning. 
Nehru’s other great contribution to 
the independence movement was that he 
gave it an international perspective. He 
saw that fascism, militarism and imperi- 
BY SARVEPALLI GOPAL 
alism were partners and against them were 
ranged popular and national movements 
all over the world. So the independence 
movement in India was part of a univer- 
sal struggle and its allies were the peoples 
fighting for freedom and dignity in Eu- 
rope, Asia and Africa. 
Nehru’s policies as India’s first prime 
minister from 1947 till his death in 1964 
continued to be influenced by these 
ideals. An emphasis on civil liberties and 
a search for a socialist pattern of society 
inspired all his efforts within India, while 
abroad he followed an active policy of 
support for anti-colonialism and anti- 
racism. He was particularly committed to 
Africa which he regarded as India’s neigh- 
bour. He supported the national move- 
ments in Kenya, Algeria, Ghana and 
Nigeria and never compromised in his 
resistance to apartheid. Above all he was 
a supporter of the United Nations and its 
agencies, sent Indian troops as part of 
United Nations contingents to Gaza, 
Suez and the Congo and worked to pro- 
mote total disarmament.

hakrishnan to the independence move-

minister of independent India

ment was of a different order. 
Imperialism damaged the identity of the 
Indian people by assuming that Western 
civilization was superior. In reply Rad- 
hakrishnan turned to the sources and, in 
his writings on Indian philosophy, 
showed that the thought of his people 
was second to none in logic and rational- 
ity. This enabled them to hold up their 
heads. But Radhakrishnan did more. He 
argued that philosophy was related to life 
and, while interpreting Indian thinkers at 
their best, also called on Indians to dis- 
card what was outmoded and to rid them- 
selves of obscurantism and superstition. 
Their long and rich tradition had been ar- 
rested and required innovation and fur- 
ther evolution. Truth should not be 
allowed to be smothered by the dead past. 
The speculative and scientific thought of 
the West should be incorporated into the 
Indian heritage. 
Moreover, by expounding Indian 
thought in terms which related to the 
Western tradition, Radhakrishnan made 
Indian culture a part of world civilization. 
He, like Nehru, accepted a nationalism 
which was a brick in the structure of 
internationalism and his philosophical 
efforts were intended to build under- 
standing between East and West. A mem- 
ber before the Second World War of the 
International Committee for Intellec- 
tual Co-operation, he was active in 
Unesco from its foundation in 1945. He 
was a member of Unesco’s Executive 
Board, served as its chairman, was elect- 
ed president of the General Conference 
in 1952, and was associated with the 
opening of Unesco’s Paris Headquarters 
in the Place de Fontenoy in 1958. To him 
Unesco was, as he described it, “the

priesthood of the spirit”. 
Radhakrishnan’s main activity, after 
India became free, was to help in the 
reconciliation of mankind on the basis of 
the common ground among all the 
religions of the world. He believed that 
a global community was emerging and 
that humanity should be educated to 
recognize its purpose and destiny. Ap- 
pointed by Nehru as India’s ambassador 
to the Soviet Union, Radhakrishnan 
stood nearly thirty years ago for negoti- 
ations and peaceful settlements between 
the two sides in the cold war. In 1952 he 
came back to India and for the next 
fifteen years in Delhi, first as Vice- 
President for ten years and then for five 
years as President, he gave the lead in

improving the quality of life and promot- 
ing character. Even while holding these 
high offices and carrying out his duty to 
his own people, Radhakrishnan con- 
tinued to travel round the world, advocat- 
ing the emergence of a new civilization 
based on the unity of mankind and 
common truths of the spirit and animat- 
ed by a religion founded not on dogma 
but on the deepening of the individual’s 
awareness and compassion for all fellow 
beings. 
If Radhakrishnan was by birth a Hin- 
du, Abul Kalam Azad was born in Mec- 
ca of pious Muslim parents; but they both 
had a strong sense of religion based on 
rationalism and the common values of all 
humanity transcending creeds and 
denominations. Fluent in Arabic and Per- 
sian and a scholar in Islamic studies, Azad 
gave a broad and liberal interpretation of 
the Qur'an. To him religion was a guide 
to proper action and his scholarship led 
him into public life. From 1912 his 
primary objective was to draw the Mus- 
lims in India into the struggle for free- 
dom. A steadfast follower of Gandhi, he 
was elected a number of times President 
of the Indian National Corigress and 
suffered long terms of internment and im- 
prisonment. From 1920 political differ- 
ences between Hindu and Muslim 
organizations increased; but the Congress 
insisted that nationalism had no connec- 
tion with religion and the presence of 
Maulana Azad in the ranks of the nation- 
alist leadership was the highest testimo- 
ny of this. Azad’s pride in being an Indian 
was strengthened by his commitment to 
what he termed the Islamic spirit, and he 
never accepted that a good Muslim could 
not be a good Indian. 
From 1947 ull his death in 1958 he 
served as India’s first minister for educa- 
tion and was a key figure in the formula- 
tion of national policies in all fields. With 
his belief that true religion brings all peo- 
ples together, Azad also took much in- 
terest in the promotion of international 
understanding and was the president of 
the General Conference of Unesco at its 
session in Delhi in 1956.

CLOSE-UP ON 
INDIAN CINEMA 
INEMA in India is a ticket to a 
world of fantasy, providing an 
escape from the harsh reality of 
everyday life. Three-quarters of a century 
old, it is still eagerly wooing its faithful 
audience with stories of virtuous people 
battling against the odds and emerging 
victorious. At various stages in its history, 
Indian cinema has borrowed themes, 
ideas and even entire plots from foreign 
sources. It has always been heavily 
influenced by Hollywood, and costume

there are a mother figure, a comedian to

who will appeal to the young people in 
the audience, and a Muslim or a Chris- 
tian character. This is the framework 
devised by the Bombay movie moguls 
and it is followed by other film-producing 
centres in Madras, Calcutta and the 
Punjab. 
The father of Indian cinema was 
Dhundiraj Govind Phalke (1870-1944). 
Born into a priestly family in Nasik dis- 
trict, not far from Bombay, Phalke was 
trained to be a Sanskrit scholar, but his 
interests lay more in the direction of 
painting, theatre and magic. When he saw 
a film about the life of Christ, he was 
excited by the possibilities of the new 
medium. The outcome was India’s first 
feature film, Raja Harishchandra (1913), 
whose plot, drawn from Indian mytho- 
logy, was a celebration of the deeds of the 
monarch who sacrificed his wealth, king- 
dom and family in his quest for truth. 
Phalke became a prolific film produ- 
cer whose work was popular throughout 
the country. Other stalwarts of the Indian 
silent cinema included Dhiren Ganguly, 
who made the satirical comedy England 
Returned (1921); Debaki Kumar Bose, 
who directed the adventure movie Kana- 
mar Aagun (Flames of Flesh; 1928); and 
Chandulal Shah who made Typist Girl 
(1926) and Gun Sundari (Why Husbands 
Go Astray; 1927), both of which evoke 
the strength and dignity of the Indian 
woman. 
Film making became big business as 
well as a medium for artistic expression. 
Studios and production groups such as 
New Theatres of Calcutta, the Prabhat 
Film Company of Pune (near Bombay) 
and Bombay Talkies were formed by 
entrepreneurs and dictated taste during 
the 1930s, the first decade of sound. One 
particularly active studio, the Imperial 
Film Company, produced India’s first 
talking feature, Alam Ara (Beauty of the 
World; 1931, in Hindi), which included 
a dozen songs. 
By 1940, 100 films a year were being 
made in India, a figure which doubled by 
1950. Today, India ranks third in the total 
number of films produced after the Uni- 
ted States and Japan, but since 1976 has 
led the world in annual film output. In 
1983, 763 Indian films were made, most 
of them in Bombay and Madras. Current 
output is over 900 films a year, and des- 
pite keen competition from television and 
video, cinema is still India’s best-loved 
form of entertainment. 
Yet Indian cinema has not confined 
itself to entertainment. It has made 
genuine efforts to portray the Indian 
mind and emotions. It has advanced the 
theory that the good must triumph over 
evil, taken the side of the downtrodden, 
stressed the need for respect for one’s 
elders, and portrayed the quality of 
honesty in a largely corrupt world. The 
best examples of such cinema date from 
the 1950s, which is generally acknow- 
ledged to have been a golden decade when 
film makers were not entirely dominat- 
ed by box office considerations and the 
national] mood was one of optimism and 
hope. 
The films made in the 1950s by direc- 
tors V. Shantaram, Raj Kapoor, Guru 
Dutt and Bimal Roy are today widely 
regarded as masterpieces. Plots were then

often taken from indigenous literary 
sources and were rooted in Indian soil. 
The intention was to combine social 
conscience with entertainment, a difficult 
blend to achieve. There was also a drive 
to use more advanced technology. 
After the 1950s, with the advent of 
colour, the cinema became more light- 
hearted and escapist. The tendency was 
to produce sugary love stories set in 
Kashmir or picturesque hill-towns such 
as Darjeeling. From this background 
emerged India’s best-known film maker, 
Satyajit Ray. 
Born in 1921 into a cultivated Bengal 
family, Ray was influenced in early life 
by the great poet Rabindranath Tagore, 
and by his own father Sukumar, a noted 
Bengali writer. He became acquainted 
with the French director Jean Renoir 
when Renoir was making his film Zhe 
River in Calcutta. Encouraged by Renoir, 
Ray started work on Pather Panchali 
(Song of the Road; 1955). This film, the

contemporary, Satyajit Ray, and Sen is often

by the Bengali writer Bibhuti Bhushan 
Banerji, was completed on a shoestring 
budget. At the 1956 Cannes film festival 
it was voted the “best human document” 
shown. 
Ray’s work has brought world status 
to Indian cinema. The Apu trilogy, Maba- 
nagar (The Big City; 1963) and Charulata 
(1964) are recognized as masterpieces. 
Another Bengal film maker, the late Rit- 
wik Ghatak, is also widely considered as 
a director of genius. His Ajantrik (The 
Mechanical Man; 1958), a fable about a 
taxi-driver’s relationship with his dilapi- 
dated taxi, and Meghe Dhaka Tara (The 
Hidden Star; 1960) are brilliant depictions 
of harsh east Bengal reality. 
Mrinal Sen, like Ray, is a product of 
the Calcutta film society movement. 
Inspired by the international classics he 
had seen, he made Raat Bhore (Night's 
End; 1956) and Neel Akasher Neechey 
(Under the Blue Sky; 1958). His Baishey 
Shravana (The Wedding Day; 1960) was 
well received at the Venice Film Festival. 
Changes swept through Indian cinema 
in the late 1960s and the 1970s after 
Indian film makers had come into in- 
creasing contact with the work of foreign 
artists and directors. Both Ray and Bimal 
Roy, for example, had been impressed 
and influenced by Italian neo-realism. 
— 14 __ 
There was also a growing awareness 
of the need to set up an institution where 
students could learn the art of film 
making, and in response to this the Film 
Institute of India was founded in Pune in 
1961. Its graduates were taught not to 
pander to accepted formulas but to strike 
out in new directions. The new move- 
ment in the cinema was supported by the 
Film Finance Corporation, later incorpo- 
rated into the National Film Develop- 
ment Corporation (NFDC), which had

of the most original talents in Indian 
cinema are graduates of the Pune Film 
Institute. Both Mani Kaul (Usk: Roti; A 
Day’s Bread, 1970) and Kumar Shahani 
(Maya Darpan; *“The Mirror of Illusion”, 
1972) have refused to compromise with 
the dictates of the market, and despite 
being criticized for not being “‘accessi- 
ble”, they have worked towards the deve- 
lopment of new narrative techniques in 
their films. 
A trend commonly known as “middle 
of the road” cinema has also emerged 
through films treating subjects such as 
rural oppression and political chicanery. 
The leading figures in this movement are

Shyam Benegal (Ankur; The Seedling,

Among the promising younger film 
makers are Ketan Mehta (Bbavni Bbavai; 
A Folk Tale, 1980), Saeed Mirza (Albert 
Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai; What 
Makes Albert Pinto Angry, 1980), and 
Kundan Shah (Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro). Eclec- 
tic, dynamic and inventive, their work 
deals with issues ranging from housing 
problems and casteism to the lust for 
money in the corridors of power. 
In recent years a vigorous, individua- 
listic movement, led by G. Aravindan and 
Adoor Gopalakrishnan, has developed in 
the region of Kerala in southern India. 
Aravindan’s Thampu (The Circus Tent; 
1978) Chidambaram and Oridath, and 
Gopalakrishnan’s Swayamvaram (One’s 
Own Choice; 1972), Kodiyettam (Ascent; 
1977) and Mukbamukbam, made during 
the 1970s and 1980s, have established the 
reputation of these directors and reflect 
their sensitivity to social conditions in

### 82211: A New policy for education

A NEW POLICY 
FOR EDUCATION 
DUCATION was given high 
E priority after India gained in- 
dependence in 1947. The new 
Constitution called on the State to pro- 
vide free and compulsory primary edu- 
cation and gave the federal government 
the responsibility for maintaining stan- 
dards in higher and technical education. 
By a subsequent amendment to the Con- 
stitution, education was also declared to 
be a concern of the provincial govern- 
ments. India opted for a planned econo-

my, and each five-year plan indicates the 
directions for educational development. 
Dramatic expansion of education has 
taken place since independence. The 
number of primary (including upper 
primary) schools has tripled and enrol- 
ment has increased from about 30 per 
cent to 80 per cent. The increase in the 
enrolment of girls at primary level has 
BY ANIL BORDIA 
been particularly impressive, from 17.7 
per cent in 1950-1951 to 64.6 per cent in 
1986-1987. 
Increase in enrolments has been even 
more spectacular in secondary education, 
and the number of schoolteachers has ris- 
en from 750,000 to 3.7 million. In higher 
and professional education, the number 
of institutions and enrolments has in- 
creased eightfold, and in technical educa- 
tion about tenfold. 
In 1964, the Government of India ap-

## [Page 17](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/082219engo.pdf#page=17) 0

### 82211: A New policy for education

pointed a commission to advise on the na- 
tional pattern of education and on the 
general principles and policies for educa- 
tional development. Four years later, an 
education policy formulated on the ba- 
sis of the commission’s recommendations 
called for a transformation of the educa- 
tion system which would relate it more 
closely to the life of the people; a con- 
tinuous effort to expand educational op- 
portunity; a sustained and intensive effort 
to raise the quality of education at all 
stages; an emphasis on the development 
of science and technology; and the culti- 
vation of moral and social values. 
The most remarkable change which 
took place after the adoption of the 1968 
Education Policy was the establishment 
of a common structure of education. This 
consisted of ten years of common school- 
ing for all children, followed by two years 
of higher secondary education and a 
three-year degree course. 
In 1985, the Central Government 
again reviewed the educational situation 
and decided to initiate a new National 
Policy on Education, which was debated 
extensively by students, teachers and peo- 
ple in all walks of life before it was passed 
by the two Houses of Parliament in 
February 1986. A detailed Programme of 
Action was completed a few months later 
to ensure that the policy would be im- 
plemented without delay. 
The 1986 education policy envisages 
a national system which will take deter- 
mined action to bring about universal 
primary education and promote the 
spread of adult literacy, thereby helping

to reduce inequalities. The education sys- 
tem will be based on a national curricu- 
lar framework which contains a common 
core as well as components specific to 
each region. The core will cut across sub- 
ject areas and will be designed to promote 
such values as India’s common cultural 
heritage, egalitarianism, democracy and 
secularism, equality of the sexes, protec- 
tion of the environment, observance of 
the small family norm, and the scientific 
approach. Pace-setting schools called 
Navodaya Vidyalayas will provide quali- 
ty education to particularly gifted chil- 
dren, irrespective of their families’ means, 
and will promote excellence as well as

equity and social justice. The 1986 policy 
also emphasizes the need to raise the level 
of investment in education from about 
4 per cent of national income in 1986 to 
6 per cent by 1990 and even higher 
thereafter. 
Soon after assuming office in 1984, 
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced 
his decision to launch a National Litera- 
cy Mission (NLM) to bring functional 
literacy to some 80 million illiterate peo- 
ple in the 15 to 35 age group. The teach- 
ing of functional literacy is designed to 
achieve a variety of goals, including self- 
reliance in literacy and numeracy; the de- 
velopment of awareness among the poor 
and the illiterate of the causes of their 
deprivation; the acquisition of skills to 
improve economic status and general 
well-being; understanding of the values of 
national integration; conservation of the 
environment; women’s equality; and the 
small family norm. NLM also stresses the 
importance of post-literacy and continu- 
ing education. 
A number of important initiatives 
have been taken as a result of the new na- 
tional policy on education: 
* A nationwide programme for the 
improvement of primary education facil- 
ities, including reorganization of teacher 
training, is now under way. 
* New curricula have been written for 
primary and secondary education and 
new textbooks and teaching materials 
have been prepared. 
* Special programmes have been 
launched to improve science teaching, in- 
troduce computer literacy and promote 
awareness of environmental issues.

NDIA waits for the monsoon each 
year the way a child waits for its 
mother’s breast. But unlike the child 
that comes of age and stops waiting, more 
than half of India depends on the mon- 
soon for its survival. When it fails the 
land broods. 
To awaken the monsoon, the peasants 
in my mother’s village would come sing- 
ing through the dust-filled tracks carry- 
ing a huge basket poised on a wooden 
pole. A large bull frog would be seated 
in the basket that was padded with neem 
leaves. The cry of Hassana Hossana nyalo 
would rend the still hot air. Children 
would run out of sun-baked huts and 
pour drops of precious water on the frog. 
And by evening the clouds would roll in, 
the heavens would thunder and there 
would be rain. 
Customs such as these have been part 
of every Indian child’s heritage. But now 
the age of miracles seems to be over. One 
child in Rajasthan I met a year ago had 
not seen rain. He was six years old. His 
mother, a young woman of thirty, had 
begun to look like an older woman. She 
had lost the lilt of her limbs, walking five 
kilometres each day to fetch water for 
drinking. Her well was dry, like all the 
wells in her area.

The peacock is India’s national bird and is 
often depicted in the company of 
Lord Krishna. 
The monsoons had failed Rajasthan 
for several years. The grass was brown. 
All crops had been lost. Dead guava trees 
were being cut for fuel. Even in the city 
of Ajmer the taps would come to life only 
once every four days, and then only for 
a few hours. The Anasager lake looked 
like a burning bowl of sand. The washer- 
women had disappeared from its shores. 
The beating of their clothes had been si- 
lenced. On the edges of the city, in relief 
camps, lean cattle stood with vacant eyes. 
The animal most prized by the farmer 
had been anointed with kum kum, the 
auspicious red powder, and had been 
abandoned. There was no fodder. 
“We want food not money”, said the 
women who were hired to work in the 
drought relief work programmes. Lack of 
rain had killed the crops, aggravated in- 
flation, spiralled prices across the parched 
land. In Madras, there were fist fights in 
the lines of people waiting at communi- 
ty taps for water. Hordes of elephants 
ambled away from the parched forests of 
Tamil Nadu into neighbouring Karnata- 
ka. In the unrelenting sun farmers in the 
country beseeched gods, priests chanted 
mantras in good faith, scientists wondered 
why their sound vibrations were not stir- 
ring the atmosphere, seeding the clouds 
and sending rain. Meteorologists scanned 
the skies and put out intricate weather 
charts. On the whims of the monsoon 
rested major economic decisions. Politi- 
cal fortunes were staked on its success and 
failure. On the promise of the monsoon 
rested the survival of a vast land. 
The Indian monsoon is not just 
another word for rain. It is neither a 
typhoon nor a spell of roaring winds. It 
is a season whose name stems from the 
Arabic word mausem. It is not rainfall 
that determines and defines the monsoons 
but the seasonal winds that shift direction 
twice a year. If the wind is from another 
direction there is no rain. There is a sum- 
mer monsoon and a winter monsoon. 
But it is only the nimbus southwest winds 
of summer that make a mausem—the

season of rains. It is preceded by the Joo, 
hot dry winds, days of intense heat and 
a scorching sun. 
When the pied-crested African cuck- 
oos fly back and the shrill cries of pea- 
cocks fill the air, people know that the 
monsoon 1s days away. Peasants across 
the land have their own ways of predict- 
ing the monsoon. The more intense the 
heat, the more rain there will be, they 
say. The coming of the rains is also 
celebrated with intensity. People run out 
and soak themselves in the rain like chil- 
dren. In the words of the famous fifth- 
century poet Kalidasa, the clouds advance 
“like rutting elephants, enormous and 
full of rain. They come forward as kings 
among tumultuous armies; their flags are 
lightning, the thunder is the drum”. It is 
as great an event for the farmer as it is 
for the singer, the poet. The heavy dark 
clouds fill the canvases of miniature 
painters. And for the poet, the dark tress- 
es of his beloved are like the waves of the 
monsoon clouds. As long ago as the sixth 
century the poet Subandhu in his 
Vasavadatta welcomed the monsoons in 
these words: 
“The rainy season had arrived. Rivers 
overflowed their banks. Peacocks danced 
at eventide. The rain quelled the expanse 
of dust as a great ascetic quells the tide 
of passion. The chataka birds were hap- 
py. Lightning shone like a bejewelled 
boat of love in the pleasure pool of the 
sky; it was like a garland for the gate of 
the place of paradise; like a lustrous git- 
dle for some heavenly beauty; like a row 
of nail marks left upon the cloud by its 
lover, the departing day ... the rain was 
like a chess player while yellow and green 
frogs were like chessmen jumping in the 
enclosures of the irrigated fields. Hail- 
stones flashed like pearls from the neck- 
laces of heavenly birds”. 
Some of the best evocations of the 
monsoons are found in the baramasa

composed by the poets of north India, in 
which feelings are expressed in harmony 
with the seasons. In all Indian languages 
innumerable proverbs stress the impor- 
tance of rains. Some proverbs instruct 
farmers, others warn them of the nature 
of rain. Ghagh, the learned Brahmin poet- 
astrologer who composed many 
proverbs, had this to say: “When water 
in the pitcher does not cool, when spar- 
rows bathe in dust and ants take their eggs 
to a safer place, you can be sure of a heavy

lips of every peasant in the Hindi 
speaking belt of Uttar Pradesh and 
Haryana. “Scarcity 1s only a missed mon- 
soon away”, Is a saying that lurks in the 
mind of every Indian. For the Indian 
monsoon remains unpredictable. It can 
skip a region, flood another, tease a third. 
It can, as the ancient proverb says, “fall 
on one horn of a buffalo and not on 
another”. It can bless a land, but also 
deny and destroy. It wears a new face 
every season.

VILLAGE WISDOM 
An unsung resource for rural development 
BY SANJIT BUNKER ROY 
HEN I began working in the 
villages in 1967 I used to think 
that India needed trained ur- 
ban professionals to develop the rural 
areas. I used to think with the arrogance 
that young people acquire in public 
schools that rural India had nothing to 
offer and that its people needed us. Now, 
after twenty years of interaction with 
needy villagers, I have totally changed my 
position. 
I respect the skill of the traditional 
midwife and believe she is much more im- 
portant to rural India than the alienated 
urban-trained Auxiliary Nurse Midwife. 
I value the wisdom and knowledge of the 
village priest and marvel at his patience 
as a teacher.

kilometres. These schools attract over 
1,500 children who have dropped out 
from the regular school system. Among 
those who train the teachers in charge of 
these schools is a village priest. Another 
priest installs and maintains the sophisti- 
cated solar panel systems that provide 
three hours of light in many of the 
schools. Neither of them holds a teacher’s 
diploma and would never obtain a 
government teaching post. When a 
professor from the Indian Institute of

to learn that there was no electronics en-

HILOSOPHY is an integral part 
of the Indian tradition, and reflects 
vividly one of the main features of 
that tradition: unity underlying diversi- 
ty. When Prince Siddhartha, the histori- 
cal founder of Buddhism, renounced his 
palace in search of wisdom in the sixth 
century BC, he learnt that there were 
forty-eight philosophical schools, from 
naturalism and realism at one end to real- 
ism and mysticism at the other. The San-

skrit term for philosophy is darshana, 
literally “viewing” or “seeing”. Truth is 
one, but it is multi-faceted and can be 
“seen” from different perspectives. 
Diverse darshanas or philosophical 
schools complement rather than con- 
tradict each other. This implies intellec- 
tual tolerance. 
One of the unifying factors underly- 
ing divergent schools is the conviction 
that philosophical knowledge is not an

end in itself but a means to inner trans- 
formation leading to liberation (mukti or 
Nirvana). Even those who created high- 
ly specialized and technical philosophical 
systems accepted the common goal of 
liberation. It was assumed that 
philosophical insight is only one aspect 
of the highest wisdom which includes the 
moral purity of the sage and the sensitiv- 
ity of the poet and the artist. A further 
point of agreement among philosophers 
(except materialists) is the view that liber- 
ation, the goal of wisdom, cannot come 
through an external force, such as “Des- 
tiny”, but through our own deeds and 
thoughts (karmas) spread over a succes- 
sion of lifetimes. 
The Jaina philosophical school accepts 
the existence of many types of substances 
(dravya), the main distinction being that 
between inanimate substances (pudgala) 
and living substances (jiva). All living be- 
ings are souls, ranging from the lowest 
forms of life to the highest, the perfected 
beings (tirthankaras) who transcend finite 
attributes and attain absolute knowledge 
(kaivalya). The tirthankaras represent the 
highest reality, and there is no place for 
God in Jaina philosophy. 
Buddhist thought, in its early phase, 
was mainly ethical, since the Buddha had 
avoided metaphysical issues, devoting his 
attention to the problem of Suffering. 
However, the Buddha’s emphasis on the 
universality of the law of causation and 
the impermanence of all phenomenal 
things opened the way for metaphysics, 
particularly after the emergence of the 
Mahayana school. Nagarjuna (c.150-250 
AD), the greatest among Buddhist 
philosophers, founded Shunyavada (The 
Doctrine of Emptiness). If Reality 1s to 
be grasped in its essential nature, all finite 
concepts and attributes must be “emptied 
out”. 
Turning to the Hindu tradition, in the 
earliest Vedic hymns (c. 1500-1200 BC) 
we already find the monistic trend that 
has subsequently dominated Indian 
thought. There must be, behind all mul-

tiplicity, a single reality which is called 
by different names. In the Upanishads, 
sacred texts composed many centuries 
later, the vision is turned inward and the 
one Universal Spirit dwelling in each in- 
dividual (the Atman) is declared to be the 
same as the Supreme Reality (Brahman) 
at the root of the universe. Still later, in 
the Bhagavadgita (“Song of the Lord”, 
¢.200 BC) an attempt was made to syn- 
thesize different philosophical and reli- 
gious perspectives into the Six 
Doctrines”. 
These six systems of Hindu philo- 
sophy are traditionally grouped in three 
pairs: Samkhya and Yoga; Nyaya and

Prakriti (Nature). The former is pure

very nearness of Purusha stirs Prakriti. 
The balance between the three main in- 
gredients of Prakriti is disturbed, and the 
universe evolves. Yoga accepts the 
philosophical foundation of Samkhya and 
  
applies it to the practical side of Self- 
realization. The aim of Yoga is to undo 
the distorsions caused by the mind, so 
that the true nature of Spirit may be real- 
ized. This can be achieved through medi- 
tation, for which one has to equip oneself 
through bodily and mental control. 
The Nyaya (“Analysis”) school deals 
with logical propositions and fallacies, 
and examines the sources of human 
knowledge. Vaisheshika discusses differ- 
ent categories of substances. It asserts that 
all substances are composed of four types 
of atoms which are eternal and in- 
divisible. 
The Mimansa (“Enquiry”) school 
deals with causality and offers a 
philosophical justification for the authori 
ty of the Vedas and Vedic ritual. Vedan- 
ta (“the End of the Vedas”) represents the 
crowning glory of classical Indian 
philosophy, the culmination of the Ved- 
ic tradition. Vedanta has many schools, 
the most influential being Monism, or 
“Non-dualism” (Advaita) Ramanuja (d. 
1137) asserts that the world, and the hu- 
man individual, though not identical with 
God, are within the Divine Whole. The 
great philosopher Shankara (c. 788-820) 
offers a more complete and absolute 
Monism. Brahman or the Absolute is the 
only true reality. The human self (jiva) is 
identical with Brahman, while the world 
(Jagat) is a mere appearance. The self and 
the world are seen as separate because of 
a mysterious, cosmic power (Maya, “illu- 
sion’’) which causes ignorance. 
Shankara’s Advaita Vedanta doctrine has 
dominated Indian thought for twelve cen- 
turies. Its prestige can be judged by the 
popular saying that no other philosophy 
can challenge Advaita, “just as all living 
beings in the forest are silent when the 
lion roars”. V.S.N.

ISITORS who come to India with the 
\ / notion that the Indian outlook on life 
is austere and pessimistic are surprised 
to see the zest for life which Indians display. 
This enthusiasm is seen in a vivid and pic- 
turesque light during the fairs and festivals that 
have been held since remote Antiquity. 
Festivals afford glimpses of the continuity 
and diversity of Indian life. People of differ- 
ent regions, speaking different languages, can 
be seen wearing a variety of costumes. There 
are farmers and aristocrats, mendicants and 
astrologers, poets, preachers and wandering 
singers. There is colour and pageantry, faith 
and devotion. And, amidst all this diversity, 
we feel the living presence of India. 
Most of the festivals have a strong religious 
basis. There are discourses, hymns, chants, and 
readings from scriptures. Many festivals are 
associated with specific deities. Rama Navami 
(March or April), Shiva Ratri (February or 
March) and Krishna Janmashtami (August) are 
celebrated in honour of Rama, Shiva and 
Krishna respectively. The festival of the god- 
dess Durga comes in October, while Sarasvati, 
goddess of learning and the arts, is worshipped 
in early spring. 
The Indian calendar is lunar. Special sanc- 
tity attaches to festivals held on nights of full 
moon or new moon. Apart from the moon, 
other phenomena of Nature are commemo- 
rated with affection and reverence. A day is 
set aside for expressing gratitude to the banyan 
tree, another is devoted to the nagas (serpents). 
Seasons are welcomed with festivities. Vasant 
Panchmi (early February) is the festival of 
spring. The autumn is greeted on the brightest 
moonlit night of the year, Sharad Purnima 
(usually in late October). Many fairs and 
festivals are held on the banks of sacred rivers. 
At the confluence of the Ganges and the 
Yamuna rivers at Allahabad, a festival is held 
throughout the month of Magha (January- 
February). Every twelfth year, this religious 
fair is known as the Khumba Mela. During the 
Kumbba, sometimes more than five million 
people come to bathe at the holy confluence 
on the day of amavasya (new moon).

### 82215: High days and holidays

The most important Muslim festival is 
Id al-Fitr, at the end of the month-long fast 
of Ramadan. People wear new clothes and 
offer special prayers at mosques. This is fol- 
lowed by a feast. The Parsi new year (Nauroz), 
and the Christian festivals of Christmas and 
Easter, are celebrated with great enthusiasm. 
The birthdays of Buddha, Mahavira and Guru 
Nanak (founders of Buddhism, Jainism and 
Sikhism respectively) are national holidays. 
The majority of festivals, however, belong to 
the Hindu tradition. 
On these occasions, the religious and secu- 
lar aspects of life are happily blended. Reli- 
gious ritual is combined with cultural 
programmes: folk dances, concerts, popular 
plays, puppet shows, poetic symposia. Way- 
side shops spring up, and bargaining is a popu- 
lar diversion. In recent years, even politicians 
have started addressing the crowds that gather 
at festivals. 
Dussehra, Diwali and Holi are the three 
major Hindu festivals. The ten-day Dussehra 
festival commemorates the victory of Rama, 
an incarnation of the Divine, over Ravana, 
king of the demons. Episodes from the ancient 
epic, Ramayana, are enacted on the stage. 
Three weeks after Dussehra, which usual- 
ly occurs in October, comes Diwali, the Fes- 
tival of Light. Houses are cleaned and 
illuminated in order to welcome Lakshmi, the 
goddess of well-being and prosperity. There 
is a display of fireworks, and traditional sweets 
are served after the ceremonial worship of 
Lakshmi. An interesting feature of Diwali is 
the honour paid to the materials used in 
various vocations. Goldsmiths and carpenters 
polish their tools and place flowers upon 
them. Merchants honour their account books. 
Artists and writers express their gratitude to 
their brushes, pens, pencils and inkpots!

While Diwali is celebrated on a night of 
new moon, Holi, the festival of colour, begins 
on the night of the full moon in the month 
of Phalgun (March-April). Bonfires are kindled 
at street corners, symbolically cleansing the 
atmosphere of all that is evil. The following 
morning, people are on the streets, spurting 
coloured water over each other. Like the bac- 
chanalia of ancient Greece, Holi is a folk fes- 
tival at which inhibitions are shed, women 
come out of their seclusion, and caste barriers 
are set aside. At mid-day, the shouting, sing- 
ing and colour-pelting all stop. Then, after a 
bath, people embrace each other and partake 
of sweets. 
It is said that Hol; was the favourite festival 
of the divine Krishna, the pastoral hero whose 
beauty enchanted all the cowherd girls of the 
village. On the day of Holi, Krishna danced 
with them—especially with his beloved 
Radha—and drenched them with coloured 
water. That is why even today Holi is celebrat- 
ed with special joy and zest at Vrindavan, the 
home of Krishna. V.S.N.

Indian mathematics go back to the 
Vedic age, when the construction of are- 
nas for sacrificial ritual demanded ac- 
curate measurements. Pride of place in 
Indian mathematics goes to Aryabhatta 
(late fifth century AD) who elaborated 
the decimal system which had been de- 
vised by his predecessors. Other famous 
names are those of Brahmagupta, Ma- 
havira and Bhaskara (of the seventh, 
ninth and twelfth centuries respectively). 
They understood the significance of posi- 
tive and negative quantities, solved many 
complex equations, and evolved methods 
of extracting square roots and cube roots.

They showed profound insight into the 
implications of zero (shunya) and of in- 
finity. Bhaskara proved mathematically 
that infinity, however divided, remains 
infinite—a truth which had been accept- 
ed on the metaphysical plane as early as 
the 6th century BC in the Upanishads. 
The Arabs are widely believed to have 
adopted from the Indians the decimal sys- 
tem using the zero, and passed it on to 
European scientists. India thus provided 
indirectly the mathematical foundation 
without which many important advances 
in Western science and technology would 
not have been possible.

remarkably close to the modern estimate. 
He asserted that the Earth rotates on its 
axis and revolves round the Sun, a view 
for which Galileo was persecuted by the 
Catholic Church a thousand years later. 
Another great astronomer was Varahami- 
hira, a contemporary of Aryabhatta. He 
was thoroughly familiar with Greek and 
Roman astronomy, from which he adopt- 
ed many features including the signs of 
the zodiac. Indian astronomers described 
the procession of equinoxes, forecast 
eclipses, and made amazingly accurate cal- 
culations of planetary movements 
without the aid of telescopes. 
While astronomy and mathematics 
grew together, the progress of medicine 
involved considerable knowledge of 
chemistry and botany. The origin of 
Ayurveda (“Science of Longevity”) goes 
back to the Samaveda. In the writings of 
Charaka and Sushruta (first and fourth 
centuries AD respectively) almost every 
aspect of diagnosis and treatment was dis- 
cussed. The properties of herbs, seeds, 
minerals and salts were studied carefully; 
the importance of fresh air and water was 
stressed; a code of medical conduct was 
evolved; surgical instruments and tech- 
niques were developed. Yoga had an im- 
portant therapeutic side and yielded 
valuable knowledge about respiration, the 
circulation of the blood and the nervous 
system, and about the physiological ef- 
fects of emotional and mystical states. 
Indian medicine is based on the con- 
cepts of doshas (“humours”) and gunas 
(“ingredients of Nature”). The first in- 
volves the study of the three vital fluids— 
wind, gall and mucus—which must be 
balanced for good health. The second 
concept presupposes three basic gunas: 
sattva, rajas and tamas, associated with pu- 
rity, passion and apathy respectively. For 
perfect health, sattva must dominate the 
other elements. The physician tries to en- 
sure this by regulating diet, exercise and 
medication. 
The doctor has always occupied a 
prestigious position in Indian society. A 
spiritual preceptor or guru was also 
looked upon as a healer. The idea of the 
sanctity of all life also encouraged the de- 
velopment of veterinary medicine. Many 
specialized treatises were written about 
the treatment of horses, elephants and

### 82217: Project Tiger

    
BY RAHUL SINGH 
tiger in its natural habitat is one 
of Nature’s most marvellous and 
unforgettable sights. Around 
3 metres long and weighing about 230 ki- 
los, the adult animal with its beautifully 
coloured coat of golden-orange and black 
stripes is swift, ferocious and powerful, 
yet languid and graceful in its move- 
ments. It is an unmatched hunting 
machine. No other animal arouses such 
fear, excitement and awe; no other animal 
is surrounded with such an air of mys- 
tery. ) 
The tiger, which is afraid of no wild 
creature, has one mortal enemy—man, 
who can not only destroy this magnifi- 
cent animal with guns, poison and traps 
but can also destroy its surroundings with 
axe and chain-saw. 
Half a century ago, there were at least 
60,000 tigers in Asia. In Indonesia, the last 
known tiger was killed just before the Se- 
cond World War and the Caspian tiger 
followed it into oblivion three decades 
later. (Attempts are now being made to 
re-introduce the tiger to these areas.) 
India has become the tiger’s last major 
haunt in Asia, but here too the species has 
been devastated on 4 monumental scale. 
At the turn of the century there were 
40,000 tigers in India. By 1972 there were 
just 2,000 left. For the maharajahs of In- 
dia, with their lavish privy purses, tiger 
shooting was a status symbol. One ma- 
harajah proudly claimed to have shot 
1,150 tigers during his lifetime. Bags of 
500 were quite commonplace. 
Tiger tracks in the sands of the Sundarbans, 
West Bengal. A vigorous conservation policy 
has given the tiger a new lease of life. ~

But even the abolition of the prince- 
ly order did not improve matters. 
Poachers moved in for the valuable tiger 
skins, which two decades ago were worth 
$4,000 each. Meanwhile, India’s popula- 
tion explosion from 450 million at in- 
dependence in 1947 to over 800 million 
today meant that people moved inexora- 
bly into the tiger’s habitat.

Forests, particularly in the Terai 
region bordering India and Nepal, were 
cut down to provide land for foodcrops. 
Its cover and that of its prey destroyed, 
the tiger disappeared from many parts of 
India where it had earlier flourished in 
large numbers. In other areas tigers 
retreated further and further into such 
forests as were left, often killing domes- 
tic cattle in their desperate hunger. By the 
time alarm bells started to ring in the late 
1960s, the tiger was on the verge of ex- 
tinction in India. 
The 1969 world congress of the Inter- 
national Union for the Conservation of 
Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), 
held in New Delhi, signalled an impor- 
tant turning point. The IUCN put the 
tiger on its list of endangered species and 
called for a ban on tiger hunting world- 
wide, to which India quickly reacted by 
forbidding tiger-shoots. On 1 April 1973 
an ambitious “Project Tiger” was official- 
ly launched by the Indian Government 
in Corbett National Park (Uttar 
Pradesh), named after the legendary Brit- 
ish hunter turned conservationist, 
36 
Jim Corbett. Eight tiger reserves were in- 
itially created as part of Project Tiger, to 
which the World Wildlife F:2nd donated 
$1 million. 
According to Bittu Sehgal, the 
founder-editor of India’s leading wildlife 
magazine, Sanctuary, the idea behind 
Project Tiger is basically very simple. 
“Each reserve is demarcated into a core 
AAT A 
TAA Sd hy 
SIN NI h) =. 
zone and a buffer zone. In the core, no 
human activity other than forest protec- 
tion is allowed; here Nature is allowed to 
administer itself. In the buffer, human ac- 
tivity is minimized, restricted to the ex- 
ploitation of ‘minor’ forest produce such 
as grass, fruit, seeds, honey, and fallen 
wood. The logic is that the core area, left 
to its own devices, will quickly become 
super-productive and that this productivi- 
ty will spill over to the buffer zone.” 
The results of the new strategy were 
extremely encouraging. Slowly but sure- 
ly, the tiger started to make a comeback 
in India. At Corbett Park, there were 
only forty-four tigers left sixteen years 
ago; today there are nearly 100. At Ran- 
thambhor, a forest once owned by the 
Maharajah of Jaipur and protected main- 
ly for tiger hunting, the number of tigers 
remaining at the start of Project Tiger has 
increased from fourteen to forty. 
Thanks to Project Tiger, the tiger has 
even made a remarkable recovery in the 
Sundarbans, the 10,000-square-kilometre 
delta partly in Bangladesh and partly in 
India, where the Ganges, the Brah- 
maputra and the Meghna flow into the 
Bay of Bengal. Here, in one of the world’s 
largest tracts of mangroves, an area where 
the ecosystem was seriously threatened, 
more and more woodcutters, fishermen 
and honey-gatherers were being attacked 
by tigers, who in the process of evolution 
have become excellent swimmers and 
whose diet now includes fish. 
In 1973 Project Tiger was launched 
over an area of 2,500 square kilometres 
of the Sundarbans. At first, the authori- 
ties tried to exclude people entirely from 
the core reserve, but this proved imprac- 
tical, and fishermen and honey-gatherers 
continued to go there despite the risks. 
So, in 1981, a new strategy was devised. 
Electrified human dummies were placed 
at selected points in order to condition 
the tigers to fear man. When the dummies 
were attacked by the tigers, the latter 
received a shock powerful enough to 
cause them pain. 
The ploy seems to have worked. Since 
then, the number of people killed by the 
tigers has dropped considerably. At the 
same time, since the inner core has been 
protected, honey collection and fish har- 
vesting have increased by 300 per cent in 
fifteen years. 
As Sehgal says, Project Tiger is con- 
cerned not only with saving the tiger but 
with ecology, the environment, and “sav- 
ing mankind itself”. Today, the number 
of tigers in India has risen to 4,000 and, 
in the process, other creatures which 
were on the verge of extinction in India, 
such as the elephant, the stag, the one- 
horned rhino and the wild buffalo, have 
been given a new lease of life. 
Above all, the Indian public is now far 
more aware of how man’s future on this 
planet is closely linked with Nature. 
Deforestation has certainly threatened the 
tiger, but it has also been a cause of the 
floods that recently ravaged much of 
north and eastern India. The connection 
would not have been made twenty years 
ago, but it is being made now. That is a 
step in the right direction.

### 82218: Anger of the sea-goddess

ANGER OF THE SEA-GODDESS 
Inits 14 major languages and several 
hundred other languages or dialects, 
modern India has many thriving 
literatures. One of them isthat of 
Malayalam, the official language of 
Kerala State in southwestern India. The 
leading living novelist in Malayalam is 
- Thakazhi Stvasankara Pillai (born 
1914), whose most famous novel, 
Chemmeen, has been translated into all 
the main languages of India, where it 
became a phenomenal best-seller, and 
into many other languages as well. 
Chemmeen tells the story of the 
relationship between Karuthamma, the 
daughter of a Hindu fisherman, and 
Pareekutti, the son of a Muslim fish 
wholesaler. We publish below an extract 
fromthe final pages of Pillai’s novel. It 
opens as Karuthamma and Pareekutt: 
meet on the seashore while 
Karuthamma’s husband, Palani the 
fisherman, is out at sea. The events 
described are inspired by the belief of the 
Hindu people that Karuthamma’s 
defiant behaviour will anger the sea- 
goddess Kadalamma. The extract has 
been taken from an English translation 
of Chemmeen by Narayana Menon 
which has been included inthe Unesco 
Collection of Representative Works 
(Gollancz publishers, London/Harper 
and Brothers, New York). 
HEN Palani was away at sea, was 
\ X / it right that she should stand talk- 
ing to a stranger? Karuthamma, 
however, was not afraid. She had met him be- 
fore alone in the darkness of night. If she could 
give a man whose life she had crushed at least 
a moment’s happiness, shouldn’t she grant it? 
They stood face to face looking at each 
other. The man that she had ruined stood be- 
fore her. She knew for certain that he would 
love her forever. He would always understand 
her and forgive her. She could do anything to 
him. He would put up with anything from 
her. 
In those few seconds Karuthamma forgot 
all the sorrows of her life. She felt she had not 
been vanquished. She had the strength few 
had. She was under the protection of a strong 
man, life was secure. Palani would see to it 
that the world outside wouldn’t dare touch 
2 
her or hurt her. And she also had something 
else which gave her spirit sustenance. A man 
loved her as no man had loved a woman. Be- 
tween these two, her life was full. Now the 
man who loved her stood in front of her. 
She entered his extended arms and her 
body became one with his. Their faces met. 
He whispered in her ears. 
“My Karuthamma” 
“Yes!” 
He stroked her all over and his hands slow- 
ly moved to where he and the rude young 
boatmen of the seafront used to stare. 
“Karuthamma” 
Again she answered him obediently in that 
semiconscious state of ecstasy. 
“Yes—" 
“What am I to you?” 
She took his face in both her hands and 
looking at him with half-closed eyes, she said, 
“Everything. My pot of gold”. 
Again they became one. And in that state 
he whispered gently in her ears. 
She could not break herself away from that 
embrace. 
Far out at sea Palani baited a shark, a real- 
ly big shark. Until that day so huge a shark 
had never swallowed any bait of his or of any- 
one else’s. No fisherman had ever caught as 
big a fish in that sea. 
The moment it was baited, the shark struck 
hard. The sea churned and the water splashed 
upward into the sky. Then it came charging 
up. Palani saw it come above the water. He 
could see the line coming out of its mouth. 
Palani realized that he had caught the big- 
gest fish of that seacoast. He shouted forth his 
happiness at the catch. He must make a quick 
BY THAKAZHI S. PILLAI 
  
oe gl 
decision. Should he hold fast to the line and 
stop the fish or should he let it go for some 
time? If the bait had gone right into its throat, 
one pull of the line would be sufficient to stop 
that dangerous beast. But it might charge at 
the boat and smash it. But if he let it go, the 
boat would speed after it. And it was difficult 
to say how far the boat would be dragged 
along with it. 
Palani couldn’t see the shore. He had no 
idea in which direction the coast lay. He held 
the line with one hand and with the other 
guided the boat, and looked toward the sky 
to find his bearing by the stars. He couldn’t 
find the star he looked for. Stray clouds had 
covered the sky. The boat was being drawn 
along at an unimaginable speed. It furrowed 
through the water. There were no waves. The 
sea was calm. But the sea had darkened and 
assumed an ominous character. He looked 
carefully at the water to find the direction of 
the current. But he couldn’t judge it, however 
hard he tried. 
The shark was pulling the boat with the 
speed of wind. Where was it going? How far 
had he gone? 
Palani cried out. 
“Stop, stop there. Stop before you drag me 
to the palace of the sea goddess”. 
He pulled hard at the line. Suddenly the 
boat stopped. Then Palani laughed wildly. 
“Ha ha ha—stop there like that”. 
A short distance away from the boat the 
fish was charging in its death throes. Once 
more Palani, excited, pulled the line. The fish 
jumped up and fell into the sea again. Though 
the boat seemed motionless, Palani realized 
that it had been caught up in a current and 
was drawing a pattern on the expansive sea.

### 82218: Anger of the sea-goddess

The current was going round and round in 
circles. Again Palani watched it carefully. Was 
he caught in a whirlpool? He was sure now 
that he was going round in a wide circle. But 
he held the line firmly. Palani looked up at 
the sky. There wasn’t a single star to be seen. 
He stood in his boat and looked all round 
him. He could only see the sea round him. 
But now the water was assuming a different 
contour. Now it seemed that all around him 
was a mountain, a circular mountain of water. 
He and his boat were in a depression. The 
head of the boat seemed to rise. 
The palace of the goddess of the sea was 
at the bottom of the deep sea. There the sea 
goddess was enshrined. Palani had heard 
descriptions of that palace. He had to get there 
through a whirlpool, a whirlpool which made 
the whole sea churn round in circles, knock- 
ing at the gates of the sea goddess’ abode. Pala- 
ni thought that the mountains encircling him 
were getting taller and taller. He loosened the 
line a little. Again the boat speeded forward. 
From somewhere Palani heard a terrifying 
roar. He had never heard a noise like that. It 
-was a storm rising. 
The waves rose as high as a mountain. 
Close on one after the other the waves rose. 
Palani had never seen the like of such waves. 
Those waves were not moving in lines, They 
were rising all round him in a circle, the two 
ends joining and making a pattern. Palani 
looked round him and studied in 2 moment 
the nature of that spectacular angry sea. He 
knew how to ride his boat over the waves. 
And he knew too how to join forces with a 
storm. He had sailed a boat on the darkest of 
dark nights. 
There was a bright flash of lightning, fol- 
lowed by terrifying thunder. Palani let loose 
the line. If he held fast the line and the boat 
stopped, the boat would be smashed. He let 
the fish pull the boat as it liked. 
When the head of the boat mounted the 
crest of the high waves, he balanced himself 
with the aid of his oar and jumped upward 
so as to lighten the weight of the boat. When 
he reached the top, the boat again suddenly 
came down. The boat became almost vertical. 
Then there was another huge wave ready to 
swallow up the boat with its gaping mouth. 
The sea roared. It roared with its anger 
against that poor fisherman. The storm 
provided a drone for that roar. The thunder 
provided the rhythm. What a terrible devil- 
ish dance it was. A minute human being. 
Should the goddess of the sea unleash such a 
fury to smash him? How quickly could she 
drag him to her depths if she wanted. 
Perhaps these huge waves were making 
their way to the shore. Perhaps they were rid- 
ing over the houses on the beach. Perhaps 
poisonous sea snakes were crawling over the 
beach. In the distance something rose very 
high. Was it the crest of some spectacular high 
wave, or was it some sea monster raising his 
head with gaping mouth like a cave? Was it 
that poor fisherman's spirit being broken? 
Palani tried to jump over the wave. But he 
couldn’t rise high. That huge gaping wave 
went right over him and his boat. 
38 ___ 
Not only had the clouds covered the sky 
with thunder and lightning, the very sky 
seemed to split. All the water in the sea seemed 
to have gathered in one spot. The storm 
roared as if it was going to smash all. Yet the 
head of the boat could be seen over the crest 
of still another wave. When that had passed, 
Palani was clinging to the boat, now turned 
upside down. In a second he found his breath 
and shouted. 
“Karuthamma!”’ 
Palani’s cry rose above the roar of the 
storm. 
Why did he cry out for Karuthamma? The 
guardian angel of the fisherman at sea is his 
wife at home. He was begging her to pray for 
his safety. Didn’t the first fisherman come safe- 
ly home in spite of the storm because of the 
power of a fisherwoman’s prayer? Palani, too, 
believed he could be saved. He had a wife. She 
would pray for him. Hadn't she given him her 
word even the night before? 
The fury of the storm increased. Palani 
fought it. But it joined forces with the waves. 
Another huge wave came rolling. By the time 
he could say “Karu—"" the wave had rolled on. 
There was nothing to be seen. The storm 
and the thunder and the lightning joined 
together in the destruction. 
The water churned devilishly and blew up 
to the skies. 
The whole sea became a kind of cave. The 
storm became an entity. The boat reappeared 
on top of the waves. Palani was lying on top 
of it. He was clinging to it. 
Wouldnt that merciless slaughter ever end? 
The boat then got caught up in a whirl- 
pool and sank like a stone. 
One single star came out and shone. It was 
the fisherman’s Arundhati®, the star which 
showed them their way, but that night the star 
seemed to lack in lustre. 
The next morning day dawned on the calm 
sea as if nothing had happened. Some of the 
fishermen said that there had been a great 
storm in mid-ocean during the night, The 
waves came right up to the front of some of 
the houses. And there were sea snakes to be 
seen on the white sands. Panchami stood on 
the seashore, the tears running down her 
cheeks. The baby in her arms was crying bit- 
terly for her father and mother. Palani, who 
had gone out fishing the evening before, had 
not come home. Karuthamma was not to be 
seen, 
Panchami wept and as she wept she tried 
to comfort the baby. 
Two days later the bodies of a man and 
woman locked in embrace were washed on the 
shore. They were the bodies of Pareekutti and 
Karuthamma. 
And at the Cheriyazhikkil seafront a dead 
shark that had been baited was also cast on 
the shore. [|
