InAugust 1947 Unesco began to publish a news bulletin about its activ- 
ities. Its title was the Unesco Monitor, and it was the forerunner of 
the Unesco Courier, which began publication in February 1948. 
That was half a century ago. Today, leafing through the fifty volumes 
of the Courierthat stand on our shelves, we can retrace, page by page, 
a unique journey through the intellectual history of our time. This 
body of reading probably has no equivalent in the international press. 
How many magazines can claim to have opened their columns to so many 
notable figures from so many of the world’s cultures, gradually build- 
ing up over the years a kind of encylopaedia of the age’s intellectual 
life and its achievements in the sciences and the arts? 
All those who have lent a hand are justly proud of their association 
with this long and painstaking enterprise. One thing that none of 
them can forget is that the Couriers odyssey is first and foremost 
Unesco’s. If the Courier has been able to capture and harness the fair 
winds of intelligence, itis because they have blown into Unesco’s sails. 
What is Unesco’s ultimate purpose? Torn between dreams of utopia 
and the obligations of an intergovernmental organization, reconciling 
the day-to-day demands of hundreds of field projects worldwide with 
the principles laid down for it by its founders, does it exist to serve a 
thousand different goals or a single one? In this issue we have asked 
Alteau, a talented young cartoonist, and Doxuan, story-teller and 
humorist, to answer this question in a form that we hope you will find 
both visually and intellectually entertaining. 
A year ago we gave twenty young cartoonists carte blanche to 
draw the image of Unesco as they saw it. In the present issue we 
invite readers on a journey of investigation that will take them to the 
heart of Unesco and reveal the coherence of the ideals that are its 
lifeblood. ||

THE UNESCO Courier W JULY AUGUST 1997 
BY AKIKO SUEYOSHI 
RoJvaudine 
Japanese children’s literature came into 
being in the second decade of this cen- 
tury. The first literary review to be entirely 
devoted to it, Akai tori (“The Bluebird”), 
appeared in 1918. The country was then enjoy- 
ing a period of prosperity, and the liberal cur- 
rent of opinion known as “Taish6 democracy” 
was in the ascendant. In education, efforts were 
being made to develop children’s characters and 
creativity by introducing them to artistic activ- 
ities, and the emergence of books written specif- 
ically for children seems to have reflected soci- 
cty’s sudden upsurge of interest in them. To 
begin with, however, the authors were exclu- 
sively male, and women did not play any of 
the leading roles in their stories. 
Kenji Miyazawa, for instance, ignored 
women almost completely. In “Matasaburd 
the Wind” (1939), the predominance of male 
characters is flagrant. The main character is a 
little boy who has just started primary school 
in his village. His father features in the story 
but his mother never appears, and although the 
teacher is notidentified, it is evident from the 
language he uses that he is a man, while nearly 
all the schoolchildren who are named are boys. 
There is a similar preponderance of male char- 
acters in “Night Train in the Milky Way”, 
which tells the story of a young boy’s encoun- 
ters aboard a night train, and in “The Life 
Story of Gusukd Budori” (1941). This imbal- 
ance is understandable in view of the fact that, 
at the time, Japanese women had neither real 
social position nor employment. 
Watardsan to ushi (“Mr Watard and the 
Cow”, 1942), the only one of Nankichi

### 109294: Japan: breaking the stereotype

“ The emergence of books 
written specifically for 
children reflected Japanese 
society's sudden upsurge of 
interest in them.” 
  
Niimi’s highly popular children’s stories to 
feature a female character, is particularly illu- 
minating about this situation. The main char- 
acter, who lives with his aged mother and an 
cqually aged cow, is a good sort, but his fond- 
ness for the bottle all too often leads him 
astray. Fortunately, his cow knows its way 
home and always brings him back when he is 
in his cups, acting in this respect like a prop- 
erly dutiful wife. For that reason, Mr Watard 
has no need of a wife, but the reader learns in 
the course of the story that when he was 
young he had a beautiful, hard-working wife. 
At one point, however, he had by force of cir- 
cumstances to choose between his wife and 
his old mother, and he unhesitatingly chose to 
separate from his wife, whom he sent back to 
her family, and look after his mother. 
One of Kusurd Makimoto’s children’s sto- 
rics, Haha no hi (“Mothers’ Day”, 1937), is 
probably the first to have taken the mother’s 
role as its central theme. On Mothers’ Day, 
three children prepare the meal in place of their 
mother. She is at first delighted but at the same 
time confused, since it is traditionally the 
woman’s role to do all the household jobs, 
and with nothing left to do she soon becomes 
bored. The next day, things return to normal 
and the mother goes about her work, unques- 
tioningly and in silence. The idea that she could 
have had a hobby or outside interest seems 
never to have crossed the author’s mind. 
Women take up the pen 
It was not until after the war that things began 
to change, when women turned to writing 
themselves. The image of motherhood became 
more substantial butstill remained within the 
bounds of the role assigned to mothers by 
society. 
In Momoko Ishii’s Non-chan kumo ni 
nora (“Non-chan goes up in the clouds”, 
1947), for example, a little girl who thinks 
that her mother has betrayed her over some 
trivial matter runs away from home in tears 
and falls in a pond on the surface of which 
the clouds are reflected. When she comes: 
round, she finds herself on a cloud, where she 
meets the old “guardian of the clouds”. The 
story gives the author a chance to describe a 
typical Japanese middle-class family of the »

» time. Non-chan’s father is a white-collar 
worker and her mother, though a housewife, 
1s an educated woman and a talented singer. It 
later transpires that she would have liked to go 
to a school of music, no doubtin the hope of 
turning professional, but she 1s quite happy in 
her role of mistress of the house and mother, 
and harbours no dreams of venturing outside 
the home. 
In the 1960s, there was an unprecedented 
boom in children’s literature. More and more 
books were written by women and they con- 
tained more and more female characters—the 
portrayal of women by women who were 
attempting to make young children aware of 
what adult life could be like, involving such 
unthinkable and absurd events as divorce and 
death. 
One example of this trend 1s Chiisa: 
Momo-chan (“Little Momo-chan”, 1964), 
whichis also the first story to feature a work- 
ing woman. Momo-chan’s mother has cho- 
sen to go out to work and has to put her 
daughter in a creche—thus proving her to be 
a determined woman, since at that time only 
the children of single-parent or poor familics 
were sent to such institutions. Momo-chan’s 
adventures have remained popular with chil- 
dren and women ever since. 
The main character in Toshiko Kanzawa’s 
Harapeko onabe (“The empty-bellied stew-

pot”, 1969) is an old cooking pot who has 
had enough of feeding other people and 
decides to go off and cat lots of delicious 
things, despite the efforts of the other kitchen 
utensils to try and stop her. Ina postscript, the 
author, who 1s a woman, explains that her aim 
in telling this story was to describe the “heart’s 
never-satisfied yearning” and the “sudden feel- 
ing of emptiness that may come over a house- 
wife who spends all her time working for her 
husband and children”. The fact that Hara- 
peko onabe is not a work of realism no doubt 
made it casier for Toshiko Kanzawa to express 
a housewife’s dreams and longings. 
Career women and 
bluestockings 
In the 1970s, it was still difficult for women 
to combine housckeeping and a carcer, and 
people still looked askance upon single career 
women. Yoshiko Okkotsu’s J#sansai no natsu 
(“The summer of my thirteenth year”, 1974) 
shows the stercotyped image of the unmarried 
woman as a frigid bluestocking. 
Little Rie’s mother dies in childbirth, and 
her father, a feckless drunkard, starts wom- 
anizing. Rie is taken in by her old aunt, an 
unmarried teacher of English, who spends her 
time reading weighty tomes in a foreign lan- 
guage and never has a kind word for her. 
Finally, Rie canno longer bear the icy atmos- 
phere she lives in and runs away to live with her 
father’s current mistress, a fat, vulgar, unedu- 
cated hairdresser in a working-class suburb 
who nevertheless welcomes her with open 
arms. 
From the 1980s onwards, it became normal 
for women to go out to work and they no 
longer had to make the choice between their 
job and their home. The fathers who appear in 
children’s books of this period all fit the 
stercotype of the carcer-obsessed man who 
devotes all his time to his work and his busi- 
ness relationships and has no time for his- 
home and family. More and more stories about 
divorce—paralleling what was happening in 
socicty—appeared at this time. 
In Mama no kiiroi kozé (“Mummy's little 
yellow elephant”, 1985), I told the story of a 
divorce from the children’s viewpoint. The 
couple split up because of the husband’s infi- 
delity. The mother then passes her driving test 
and buys an old car to broaden her horizons.

She does her best to get along without her 
husband, but it’s not casy. She gets into several 
scrapes and even causes a road accident. Her 
adventures are presented as comedy, but she 1s 
nevertheless shown as trying to win her inde- 
pendence. 
Some authors still write about the woman 
who is victimized by her husband and family 
but whose life revolves around her home. In

1989), Keiko Takada gives a good description 
of such a woman, tormented by doubts about 
the validity of the life she is leading. She is a 
conscientious mother who dutifully runs the 
household and brings up the children. She has 
followed her husband as he was posted from 
one place to another, taking charge of the 
removal cach time and making great efforts to 
adapt to cach new environment. Her husband 
gives her no help around the house. They had 
two children, but the younger has died of an 
illness brought on by pollution and she feels 
guilty about the child’s death. 
Her only rebellious reaction is to drink

Miyoko Matsutani's Chiisai

Japanese children’s book in 
which the heroine, a working 
mother, leaves her child at a

heavily and engage in recriminations—until 
the day when she walks out, leaving a note 
explaining to her husband that she wants to be 
on her own for three months to try and sort 
herself out. The husband, finding himself 
alone and incapable of looking after the 
domestic arrangements, calls in his mother- 
in-law. Three months later, the wife returns 
as promised. As a result of this escapade, the 
husband finally realizes the importance of 
family life, and the marriage gets off to a fresh 
start. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, nearly all the chil- 
dren’s books that dealt with the problems fac- 
ing women in society were written by women, 
but the situation has changed since the carly 
1990s, when some male authors started to take 
an interest in women’s issues. One of them 1s 
Hiko Tanaka, whose Kalenda (“Calendar?, 
1992) contrasts the women of his grandpar- 
ents’ generation, whose lives were only the 
lives of “daughters, wives and mothers”, with 
those of the younger generation, for whom “a 
different life exists”. [|

EAST AFRICA 
Silent partners 
B elow {from left to right), 
3 children’s books from East 
Africa: Okot p'Bitek’s Song of 
Lawino and Song of Ocol, a 
study of the conflict between 
traditional African cultures 
and Western ways; Hare and 
Hornbill, an anthology of 
stories inspired by the oral 
tradition; A Son of Kabira, a 
best-seller by Ugandan novelist 
Davis Sebukima. 
For centuries, children in East African 
countries gathered around the fire, usu- 
ally after their evening meal, to listen to sto- 
rics told by their grandparents. Boys learned 
about the exploits of brave men and legendary 
hunters, while girls learned the scerets of a 
successful marriage. 
Today this tradition is disappearing. “Mod- 
ernized” stories for children are told in class- 
rooms, libraries and clubs by teachers and 
librarians. Many parents and grandparents no 
longer have the time to sit around the fire 
telling stories, and even if they did, the 
extended family is contracting. Most children 
no longer live in villages with their grandpar- 
ents but with their parents in cities and towns. 
One consequence of these changes is that 
traditional stories are being passed down to the 
next generation through a growing body of 
children’s books and the children’s sections of 
daily newspapers such as the Kampala (Uganda) 
New Vision. Most of the books are published 
in English, but quite a number arc being writ- 
ten in the major African languages, especially 
Kiswahili. The stories arc mainly based on 
myths, folklore and legends, although some 
of them contain sharp social commentary. 
The authors tend to use their writing to send 
a message—to teach, criticize, or try to correcta 
social injustice. Most try to help children to 
learn about themselves and their community,

explaining how they are expected to behave now 
and when they become adults. Their books are 
based on strong moral precepts. 
My daughter is my fortune 
The image of women as a commodity is perva- - 
sive. A Son of Kabira, a popular book by Ugan- 
dan author Davis Sebukima, tells the story of a 
preacher, Nanziri, who says of his daughter, “I 
shall make a fortune out of her.” His attitude is 
in line with traditional practice, especially in 
rural areas, where daughters may be sold in mar- 
riages that make their parents a fortune. 
In the same book, the author describes an 
argument between two co-wives about the 
best way to celebrate the homecoming of their 
husband’s son. When the husband intervenes, 
hesays, “Don’t start shouting now, you will 
disturb my head. It is as if you were beating a 
drum in it.” The women immediately stop 
arguing and go away because they know their 
husband has no interest in what they have to 
say. He alone will decide what is to be done. 
Solomon E.K. Mpalanyi’s Ndikumma 
Okolya also shows women meekly accepting 
their subordinate role. When one of the char- 
acters tells her friends that her husband mis- 
treats her and probably has a lover, they are 
unsympathetic and laugh at her predicament. 
They agree that her husband’s behaviour is

wrong, but tell her that she must put up with 
itas a normal part of married life. In the local 
language in which the book was written, they 
say, “Takecare, friend, your husband can beat 
you up with your own stick.” 
Another image offered to child readers is 
that of woman as a family servant. In one story 
by Davis Sebukima, a carpenter with two wives 
receives a visit from the village chief, whereupon 
he calls his first wife and asks her to bring some 
beer. The first wife is preparing lunch and so 
the carpenter orders his second wife to serve the 
beer. She is busy with the housework, but she 
stops what she is doing, does as she is asked 
and, as tradition demands, kneels down, fills 
the glasses and serves the men. She remains seated 
and refills the glasses when the men empty them 
until her co-wife brings in the lunch. 
The message is that the woman must serve 
the man. When the chief arrived, the carpenter’s 
wives were busy. He was doing nothing and 
could easily have fetched the beer himself. But 
this is not a husband’s job, and so he ordered 
his subservient wives to do it for him. 
In Fixions, first published in Nairobi in 
1969, Taban lo Liyong writes about an old 
man so rich that he had married sixty-five 
wives who had cost him 8,000 head of cattle in 
bride price. Here the author is telling young 
readers that a man’s wealth, status, prestige 
  
  
M other and son at a book 
fair in Nairobi {Kenya). 
and social respectability are judged by the 
number of wives he has. This reflects the tra- 
ditional linkage in this part of Africa between 
a man’s wealth and the number of his wives. In 
a predominantly peasant economy, this is 
hardly surprising. The more wives a man has, 
the more hands he has at his disposal to labour 
in the fields and create wealth for him. 
A recent book of tales for young and adult 
readers, Ijuka Kabumba’s The Wedding Ring 
and Other Stories (Kampala, 1992) describes a 
conflict about land ownership between two 
co-wives, Buyanjaand Buhesi. Their husband, 
Gyenda, arbitrarily decides that all the land 
is his alone and that neither of the wives has 
any claim to it. They are to use the land to 
produce food and crops to sell, but nothing 
must be sold without his permission and any 
money they make must be handed over to 
him. He is also in charge of their recreation. 
“I shall use my discretion to decide which of 
you will accompany me to parties,” he says. 
Another story tells how Buyanja decides to 
leave Gyenda and go back to her parents. How- 
ever, her father immediately decides to pack 
her off back to her husband, without listen- 
ing to her or consulting his wife. 
Both of these episodes underline one of 
the dominant male attitudes in Uganda and in 
Africa in general: wives, daughters, sisters and

women are not usually seen as decision mak- 
crs. This belief is formed at an carly age, and 
backed up by stories such as these. 
African traditionalist or 
Western copycat? 
The main character in Okot p’Bitck’s Song of 
Lawino (Nairobi, 1972) is a young woman 
named Lawino whosc husband, Ocol, has had 
a Western education. Their home is the scence of 
a clash between traditional African culture rep- 
resented by Lawino and modern culture rep- 
resented by Ocol. Ocol recites a litany of com- 
plaints against his wife. She can’t dance foreign 
dances like the rumba and the samba; she has 
an old-fashioned hair-do; she still cooks with 
firewood instead of a Primus stove; she doesn’t 
know the names of the months; she doesn’t 
have a Christian name and is ignorant of the 
word of God contained in the “Clean Book” 
(the Bible). 
Lawino begs her husband to understand 
her and to respect their African culture. She 
tries to get him to appreciate the beauty of 
traditional dances and her Acholi hairstyle. 
She tells him that the clay pots she uses for 
cooking millet cannot be used on Primus 
stoves, and adds that she knows the names of 
the calendar months perfectly well, but only 
in her people’s Acholi language. Acholi names 
like hers, she says, are full of significance 
because they convey messages, commemorate 
events and bestow honour and recognition 
for service to society. Christian names lack this 
kind of significance. 
The Song of Lawino is apowerful defence 
of African culture, especially the culture and 
respectability of the African woman, who is 
depicted as a conservative traditionalist. 
A very different image is presented In 
Joseph Buruga’s book, The Abandoned Hut 
  
  
A Ugandan schoolteacher 
marks her pupils’ exercises. 
 
THE UNESCO Gounier W JULY-AUGUST 1997 
(Nairobi, 1972), which portrays the African 
woman as a copycat of European cultures, val- 
ues and life-styles. 
Buruga tells the story of a man who asks a 
woman named Basia why she has rejected him. 
Without waiting for an answer he tells her 
how he prefers his own culture and hates it 
being adulterated by alien values like those 
that have “spoilt” her. “Oh, Basia,” he laments, 
“you rejected me because I do not like your 
ways. . .. You want us to go to the houses 
[nightclubs] where people gather to drink 
colourless liquids which at times look like 
blood [red wine].” He cxplains that he is 
against indoor drinking and dancing places 
because the dancing keeps people up until the 
carly hours of the morning and because the 
dancers arc not involved in making music 
(singing, drumming, etc.) but merely dance 
to music produced by others. For him, this is 
like being visited by spirits or attending the 
funcral of a dead friend or relative. 
“The Kakwa (African) people drink in the 
open under the shade of trees or house veran- 
dahs,” he says. “They drink when the sun is 
still up in the sky. When night comes, the 
drinking party closes until the following day. 
The night is the time for night-dancers 
(witches) to roam through the villages like 
lost bulls.” } 
Here the author is trying to tell his young 
readers how important it is to take pride in tra- 
ditional African culture, while also describ- 
ing a widespread social phenomenon ata time 
when many young African women frequented 
nightclubs, bleached their skin to make it 
lighter and wore wigs so that they seemed to 
have long hair like European girls. 
Social change 
This image of women is to a large extent a true 
reflection of reality. Society, not the authors, 
are to blame for this. In recent times, how- 
ever, great strides have been made by women’s 
organizations and government policies to pro- 
vide greater opportunities for women. In 
Uganda, for example, women are involved in 
national development at all levels. There is a 
fully fledged Ministry of Women in Devel- 
opment and more than forty women parlia- 
mentarians in a House of some 280 members. 
The principle of including women in public 
decision-making is replicated in political orga- 
nizations right down to village level. In sum, 
the role of women in socicty is improving 
rapidly and spectacularly. 
The authors of children’s books cannot 
fail to be aware of these developments, and it 
is to be hoped that they will soon be offering 
their readers far more positive images of 
women than they have until now. [|

### 109297: Former USSR: from ideology to love

FORMER USSR 
From ideology to love 
The picture of women in Russian chil- 
* dren’s literature before the October 
Revolution of 1917 is similar to that found in 
Western Europe. At the same time it has its 
roots in Russian history, culture and Ortho- 
dox Christianity. 
After the Revolution critics rejected this 
image almost totally on the grounds of its 
extreme sentimentality, and in the 1920s and 
1930s made attempts to put children’s litera- 
ture on a new footing, using stories inspired 
by traditional folklore and classical Russian 
literature. 
These critics, who were themselves out- 
standing writers, had very firm ideas about 
the range of themes and styles and the acs- 
thetic and cthical criteria that should be used 
BY JULIA PROSALKOVA EE 
in children’s books. Writers such as Kornei 
Chukovsky dismissed pre-October children’s 
literature as “commonplace and bourgeois”, 
objected to the image of women it projected, 
and blackballed the themes of family, parents, 
motherhood and love. 
These guidelines were dictated by a strong 
msistence on a culture dominated by political 
and social considerations. The Soviet state 
regarded children’s books as a powerful instru- 
ment in the ideological education of the rising 
generations. “The purpose of Soviet children’s 
literature is to shape a communist personality,” 
wrote I. Motyashov. This was the drawback: 
authors had to follow an ideological and e¢du- 
cational line and were obliged to write within 
the official framework.

A AL Cl lV dR mothers 
Until the 1960s female characters were por- 
trayed in children’s books with a complete 
absence of psychological realism, as revealed 
in a classic poem by the talented Soviet poet 
Sergei Mihalkov, And what about you? A 
group of childrenare sitting in the strect ona 
summer evening. They arc ata loose end, and 
to pass the time they start making all kinds of 
boasts. Onc of them brags that his mother is 
a pilot. This does not faze the other children, 
who in their turn start boasting about their 
own mothers’ jobs. The mother of one child 
is a doctor, another’s is a policewoman, a 
third’s an engineer, a fourth’sa teacher, and so 
on. Finally the children agree that “We need 
all kinds of mothers, they are all important”. 
But nothing is said in the conversation about 
mothers as such, only about their work and 
their jobs. 
This is not surprising. The new ideology 
had liberated women from some of their tra- 
ditional tasks by making the community 
responsible for the upbringing of children, 
in nurseries, kindergartens, youth clubs and 
other institutions. The collectivist mind-set 
imposed a pattern of behaviour exemplified 
in heroines whose lives were dominated by 
their sense of social duty.

to this model and succeed in bringing their 
characters to life. Among the schoolteachers, 
youth leaders, and two-dimensional mothers 
and grandmothers the reader sometimes comes 
across a girl or young woman of noble birth, 
who experiences all kinds of trials and tribula- 
tions before finding a niche in the new society. 
But the critics usually gave this type of heroine 
a frosty reception. 
From the 1920s to the 1950s women tended 
to be portrayed as conventional, insignificant fig- 
ures. There were very few exceptions, the most 
remarkable being Arkadi Gaidar’s novel Timur 
and his Squad. Even today children still love 
Timur and his girl-friend Zhenka, a tomboy 
who hides the depth of her feelings for Timur. 
Heroic figures 
Faithful to the poet Mayakovsky’s famous dic- 
tum, “Build life by example”, the critics wanted 
women revolutionaries and heroines who had 
distinguished themselves during the Civil War 
or the Second World War, or by “constructive 
labour”, to be displayed as models for the 
younger generation. Authors wrote fictional 
versions of the biographies of girls from rich 
aristocratic families who had chosen to throw in 
their lot with the people and the Revolution. 
In the real world, these women led tragic 
lives, but in children’s books they were 
depicted as cardboard figures. Their portraits 
were drawn superficially and conformed to a 
physical and psychological stereotype. In 
appearance they are round-faced, short-haired 
and clear-cyed, with resolute chins. In charac- 
ter they are bold, courageous and obstinate. 
Little is said about the stirrings of love. 
The most notable exception is Ruvim Fraer- 
man’s The Dingo: A Story of First Love, a 
picture of everyday life in the Soviet Union 
presented through the story of a teenage girl 
and her mother, who is divorced from a hus- 
band whom she still loves. One day the hus- 
band arrives with his new family in the town 
where the mother has settled with her daugh- 
ter, who falls in love with her father’s step- 
son. The author convincingly shows how 
envy, jealousy and the girl’s initial hostility 
towards the young man gradually turninto a 
shy and touching first love. 
Lyubov Voronkova, Valentina Osceva and 
Maria Prilezhaeva arc among the few women 
writers who tried to create female characters 
that would be credible to the younger genera- 
tion, only to be accused by the critics of senti- 
mentality, antisocial tendencies and philistinism. 
The thaw 
More realistic portraits of women began to 
reappear in the 1960s, the years of the “thaw”. 
Female characters started to ask themselves ques- 
tions, to have feelings and to act unpredictably. 
From now on their image obeyed a creative 
logic and was drawn with greater literary skill. 
Authors became more responsive to their per- 
sonal inspiration rather than to the official line. 
Women ceased to be merely iron-willed crea- 
tures faithfully performing their social duty 
and began to be depicted as tender, homely and 
absorbed in their children’s affairs. Women 
teachers became more feminine and Young Pio- 
neer leaders stopped speaking in slogans. 
The change was largely due to the arrival on 
the scence of a new generation of young writers 
born after the Revolution. They kept official 
ideology and the educative conception of chil- 
dren’s literature atarm’s length, and introduced 
anew style and new subject-matter. Their por- 
traits of women were closer to everyday life, 
more profound and more authentic. 
In “The Thirteenth Year of Life”, Sergei 
Ivanov created two original female characters, 
a good-hearted and pretty thirtecen-year-old 
girl and her mother, an intelligent woman. 
The mother, who has married for the second 
time, loves “the free life” more than anything 
clse, and thinks of herself as an attractive young 
woman absolved from family obligations. The 
selfishness of the mother is contrasted with her 
daughter’s attachment to the family home. 
Neglected children 
In the 1970s and 1980s, the completeness of 
women’s involvement in working life gave rise

to psychological stories in which women and

Union is here seen in a bitter light. 
In the 1980s women’s personal problems 
and their relations with the world around 
them come to centre stage. Girl heroines are 
portrayed with greater physical realism and 
psychological complexity. 
The awakening of adolescent feelings is the 
theme of R. Pogodin’s The Oak Grove. In 
this story whose gawky young heroine is not 
yet a worhan, but has ceased to be a child, the 
author describes all the complexities and con- 
flicts of a teenager who is at once lighthearted 
and frank, lyrical and lucid. 
One of the best children’s books published 
in the late 1980s, Yuri Koval’s Wormwood 
Tales was inspired by the author’s memories of 
his mother and grandmothers. Written in sim- 
ple, poetic language, it vividly evokes the hap- 
piness of childhood, when mother and her 
love arc always there. 
Grandma's return 
The symbolic popular figures of Russian folk- 
lore have also made a comeback, notably the 
grandmotherly figures who are called “babas” 
in our villages. In Russia, the “baba” has always 
been associated in children’s minds with the 
idea of stability, and sercnity, warmth and 
patience, generosity and kindness. 
One of the characters in Pogodin’s novel 
“Where the Goblin Lives”, a lonely old 
woman named Vera, would have been incon- 
ceivable in a book written between the 1930s 
and the 1960s. She spends her life looking after 
other people’s children, wherever they come 
from, as if they were her own. Her last act, 
when she is almost blind and is starting to 
lose her mind, is to save the novels young 
heroes, who are on the verge of starvation, by 
sacrificing for them her beloved rooster, the 
only living creature in her dilapidated home. 
With great generosity and love, an old peas- 
ant woman in Pogodin’s story “Where do the 
rainclouds come from?” rescues a city boy 
from the solitude of orphanhood. She shares 
with him her sense of the oneness of human- 
ity and nature. “I have killed a toad,” the boy 
tells her one day. “How can it live when itis so 
ugly?” She does not scold the child, but goes 
out of the cottage, returns with a big stone 
and puts it on the bench in front of him. 
When he asks what it is for, she says: “You 
might need it. I too am ugly.” |

### 109298: North America: mothers and daughters

NORTH AMERICA 
Mothers and daughters 
There is no such thing as the archetypal 
North American woman. She is as 
many-sided as the continent itself, a vast 
fusion of races and religions. All the same, 
books for children and adolescents provide 
an interesting overview of the expectations, 
projected desires and anxieties of young peo- 
ple as they confront the older generation. 
These books featuring parents and children 
offer insights into what is considered socially 
representative and generally acceptable or unac- 
ceptable. 
However, the realism of this type of liter- 
ature 1s limited. It is a setting for encounters

between many-faceted realities, where con- 
flicts arise and solutions are sometimes found. 
Above all these situations stiinulate us to 
think about our own identity and that of 
others, about cultural differences and shared 
values. 
A lust for life 
These shared values might be generally defined 
as “lust for happiness” or “lust for life”. We 
even find the theme of lust for survival in Vera 
and Bill Cleaver’s book, Where the Lilies 
Bloom (1969). This 1s the story of a fourteen- 
year-old girl who, after the death of her 
mother and father, makes superhuman cfforts 
to bring up and hold together a large family, 
thereby fulfilling a promise that she has made 
to her dying father. The strength of character 
that she deploys in the process would honour 
an adult woman—Dbut it also consigns her to 
great solitude. 
The ideal in this book is that of the family, 
whose life-giving and life-supporting func- 
tion is made abundantly clear. Led by the ener- 
getic Mary, the children collect rare medicinal 
herbs which they sell to make a living. The 
story ends when Marys sister starts a family 
of her own. The two girls have very different 
characters and ideals. Mary is brave and has 
disciplined herself to be so hard and unselfish 
that childhood and youth pass her by. Her 
very virtues deprive her of what she most 
nceds—the love of others. Her sister is gen- 
tle, pretty, conciliatory and indecisive in all 
matters except for her decision to marry. 
The fact that the roles of the sisters arc 
reversed at the end of the novel raises the ques- 
tion as to whether these two images of woman 
are mutually exclusive in the author’s mind. 
They certainly provide a striking demonstra- 
tion of the psychologist Erich Fromm’s the- 
ory that a person must first learn to love him- 
or herself (and accept the love of others) before 
becoming capable of loving others. The same 
principle applies to the family. This story deals 
with two kinds of survival—physical and

twelve-year-old Annie lives alone with her 
father and an extremely wilful black house- 
keeper until the housckeeper’s nephew, who 
was born out of wedlock, moves in with them. 
Annic’s hatred of the intruder is expressed in 
cloquent fantasies, as when she writes a “novel” 
aboutan illegitimate child being thrown into 
a dustbin. Unlike Mary, Annic is able to sub- 
limate her fantasies of violence and eventually 
she saves the life of the once-hated new fam- 
ily member by shooting a bull that is threat- 
ening him. Through this symbolic act, she 
liberates herself from the constricting world of 
her prejudices and doubts. The little nephew,

who is exceptionally gifted and far more 
mature than she is, has long since won her 
over and passed on to her his own love of 
reading. She comes to understand that the 
word “family” does not necessarily only 
describe a blood-relationship. 
Keep your cool is the rule 
Awakening sexuality is another common 
theme in literature for adolescents. At first it 
is surprising to sce how naturally twelve- to 
fourteen-year-old girls use an erotic vocabulary 
which still, absurdly, sometimes makes their 
mothers blush. But this linguistic ease hides a 
lack of real experience. In most cases, the greater 
their skill with words, the greater their fear 
of what lies behind them. But that fear must 
on no account be admitted. Keep your cool is 
the rule. So all these girls dream of the kind of 
great love affair they have seen on television and 
are bitterly disappointed when they have their 
own firstemotional experience. What’s more, 
they can expect little help from their mothers. 
We often come across the stercotype of parents 
who are desperately worried if their fourteen- 
year-old daughter has not yet dated any boys 
but are dismayed when she falls in love. 
Patty Dann’s book, Mermaids (1986), for 


### 109298: North America: mothers and daughters

example, which has been turned into a highly 
successful film, seems to me symptomatic of 
this conflictual situation that many American 
mothers imposc on their daughters. Fourteen- 
year-old Charlotte is familiar with her mother’s 
many relationships with men and makes ironic 
comments about them. As a psychological 
defence, she goes ona purity trip and decides she 
wants to become a nun. Unfortunately, she is 
also her mother’s daughter and is constantly 
falling in love. Despite her “experience”, she 
thinks she is pregnant after her first real kiss. 
Erotic and religious fanaticism culminate in a 
scene where she bares her breasts to the crucifix. 
As George Bernard Shaw said about his Saint 
Joan, she is “in love with religion”. 
Adolescents still occasionally go through 
such phases today. But the situation in this 
story becomes implausible when mother and 
daughter both develop a crush on the same 
man; when the mother’s concern for her 
daughter’s welfare is confined to cynical com- 
ment; when she takes a malicious delight in 
stealing her daughter’s first love (making Char- 
lotte weep for the first time in her life); and »

» when she does not even want to come into 
the house with the father whom her children 
long to sec on his only visit, an incident which 
verges on disaster. 
The real message of this contradictory 
book remains somewhat obscure. What we are 
shown is a distorted picture of emancipation, 
psychological neglect and sarcasm which pre- 
vents us from experiencing clear feelings. Just 
three sentences are devoted to fourteen-year- 
old Charlotte’s first physical experience with 
a much older man. 
Fortunately, families aren’t always so 
neglectful in adolescent literature. In Lois 
Lowry’s short story, Anastasia Krupnik 
(1979), Anastasia is treated with understand- 
ing by her educated and sensitive parents (her 
father is a professor and her mother an artist) 
when she rebels against the arrival of her baby 
brother, whom she hates. Arguments between 
the parents are worked out with humour and 
mutual respect, even in the presence of their 
ten-year-old daughter. 
In one particularly moving scence, the daugh- 
ter questions her mother in great detail about her 
first experience of love. This conversation is 
coloured with a striking mixture of timidity 
and frankness. Love, pain, disappointment, 
death, weakness and strength are discussed in 
simple language that evena little girl can under- 
stand. This story makes a pleasant contrast with 
many others in which children and adolescents 
arc ignored when they ask questions and are 
told that they should know the answers to all 
their problems by the time they are fourteen. 
~ Down-and-out in Boston 
Poverty is another subject which increasingly 
appears in adolescent literature. In Lois 
Lowry’s Taking Care of Terrific (1983) the 
heroine and her girlfriends decide to bring a lit- 
tle happiness into the lives of a group of poor 
old women by taking them boating in one of 
Boston's parks. 
In other stories the protagonists are them- 
selves confronted with poverty. In Norma 
Fox Mazer’s novel Silver (1988), a fourteen- 
year-old girl lives in a mobile home with her 
mother, who works as a cleaner and has a 
younger boyfriend. The general atmosphere 
1s one of mutual understanding and frank- 
ness. Then the daughter starts working secretly 
as a house-cleaner to help her mother make

ends meet. She gets to know other girls and 
finds out that life always holds problems, 
sometimes big ones. One of the girls is forced 
to endure sexual abuse in her rich uncle’s house. 
Her moral shame contrasts sharply with the 
modest pride of the mobile home dwellers. 
Here romanticism mingles with blunt social 
criticism in a way that is neither utopian nor 
convincingly realistic. Yet the story does cap- 
ture a slice of life that faithfully reflects what 
is happening in America today. 
Another theme is the experience of Jewish 
immigrants in the United States, as it was 
shaped partly by poverty and the ghetto and 
partly by the events of the Second World War. 
Judie Angell’s book One Way to Ansonia 
(1985), which opens in 1899, contains a num- 
ber of fascinating portaits of women of dif- 
ferent ages. They have a hard time adapting to 
their new culture and face problems that are 
duc to the weight of their own culture’s patri- 
archal traditions and customs. Once again, the 
women demonstrate remarkable resourceful- 
ness. The main character displays boundless 
energy in her battle to acquire education and 
assert her identity. With her child in tow, she

leaves her family, returning later as an indepen- 
dent woman who is now capable of experienc- 
ing happiness. 
Getting their man 
After reading a number of books for young 
people it is surprising to see how many girls 
and women believe that they must attract a 
boy or a man, not from a position of inde- 
pendence and emancipation, but in order to 
catch him and get him under their thuinb. 
The reader may well be surprised by the 
extent to which these women depend on accep- 
tance by men. To keep the man they love, they 
are apparently prepared to put up with arro- 
gance, rudeness and boredom, as well as being 
lectured to and told how to behave. Hilda Col- 
man’s Not for Love (1983) dishes up all the tired 
stereotypes of American girlhood: a pseudo- 
harmonious parental marriage bascd on indif- 
ference; interest in clothes, parties, sports and 
boys, and anxiety at the emptiness of vacations. 
It takes the political commitment of a man 
friend—extremely handsome of course—to lead 
the main character, Jill, in a different direction

### 109298: North America: mothers and daughters

Desperate (1975), is more subtle. In her capac- 
ity as the university newspaper's “Miss Lonely 
Hearts”, a female student gradually comes to 
understand the differences between superfi- 
cial and deeper feelings, conflicts and solu- 
tions. In the process she learns about herself 
and her own contradictions. 
The mothers portrayed in these two books 
are another striking example of the clear-cut 
contrasts that still typify the image of the aver- 
rage woman. They are either helpless and resigned 
or thoroughly self-assured, hard-working and 
co-operative. They show respect and under- 
standing (or indifference) to their grown-up 
daughters. When it comes to love affairs, the 
daughters hardly ever turn to their mothers, as 
if they fear incomprehension or rivalry. 
But for the most part these women of all 
ages arc imaginative, energetic and determined 
to make sense of their lives. In the final analy- 
sis, all the stories discussed here convey a sim- 
ple message: never give up the search. |

between is working to improve the status of 
men and women worldwide, Its action, which 
women. a explores many different fields, calls for 
’ i ol 
ior standard-setting instruments, training, 
p on y ior supervising studies and research, 
literacy campaigns (60 per cent of the 
130 million children with no access to 
schooling are girls), pilot projects, 
conferences, seminars, symposia, 
study grants, the compilation of 
statistics, and publications.   
 
Sexist schoolbooks 
  
A teaching guide entitled Down with 
Stereotypes! shows how sexist models 
which belittle women are transmitted 
from generation to generation. Most of 
the messages conveyed to pupils, 
students and children by school 
textbooks and children’s literature do 
not take into full account the fact that 
women’s life patterns have changed 
significantly in recent decades. 
Women from different cultural, 
social and traditional backgrounds have 
proved that they can not only follow roles 
and careers which have been traditionally 
reserved for men, but that they can 
contribute new outlooks and methods to 
them. However, this change has not been 
fully reflected as yet in school textbooks 
and children’s literature; nor has men's 
increasing participation in roles and 
careers which have been traditionally 
regarded as reserved for women. 
Some school textbooks and 
children’s hooks still convey messages 
which are largely false and out-of-date. 
They do not encourage or consolidate 
the changes that are taking place and are 
not adjusted to the new situations. The 
goals of the United Nations Decade for 
Women (1976-1985) were to promote 
equality between men and women; 
women’s participation in development; 
and women’s contribution to the 
strengthening of peace. 
THE UNESCO Cousier B JULY-AUGUST 1997 
Down with stereotypes 
it has thus become urgent to eliminate sex stereotyping in school education and 
to see that schools endeavour to promote positive and egalitarian attitudes 
between the sexes. This idea has been reaffirmed on several occasions, notably 
at the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women (Copenhagen, 
July 1980), which urged governments “to take all necessary measures to 
eliminate stereotypes on the basis of sex from educational material of all 
levels”. When strategies for the advancement of women were adopted at the 
World Conference to review the Decade (Nairobi, July 1985), it was 
recommended that “studies on women's contribution to all aspects of 
development” be included in school curricula. The Report of the Fourth World 
Conference on Women (Beijing, September 1995) identified as a critical area of 
concem “stereotyping of women and inequality in women’s access to and 
participation in all communication systems, especially in the media”. 
The Report stresses that “the continued projection of 
negative and degrading images of women in media 
communications—electronic, print, visual and audio—must 
be changed. Print and electronic media in most countries do 
not provide a balanced picture of women's diverse lives and 
contributions to society in a changing world. In addition, 
violent and degrading or pornographic media products are 
also negatively affecting women and their participation in 
society. Programming that reinforces women's traditional 
roles can be equally limiting.” 
Changes can only occur when those responsible for the 
conception, writing, illustrating, editing and interpretation of 
school textbooks and children’s literature are convinced that 
the perpetuation of stereotyped sex roles and images does 
have negative effects on society as a whole.

### 109300: Declaration by Federico Mayor: the human right to peace

THE HUMAN RIGHT 
  TO PEACE 
: “The purpose of the Organization is to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among 
! " the nations through education, science and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, for the 
; rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the 
world, without distinction of race, sex, language or religion, by the Charter of the United Nations.” 
3d * (ConsTIiTETION OF UNESCO, ARTICLE 1) 
Lasting peace is a prerequisite for the exercise of all human 
rights and duties. Tt is not the peace of silence, of men and 
women who by choice or constraint remain silent. It is the 
peace of freedom—and therefore of just laws—ol happiness, 
equality, and solidarity, in which all citizens count, live together 
and share. 
Peace, development and democraey form au interactive tri- 
angle. They are mutually reinforcing. Without democracy, 
there is no sustainable development: disparities become nnsus- 
tainable and cad to imposition and domination. 
In 1995, the fifticth anniversary of the United Nations and 
Unesco and the United Nations Year for Tolerance, we stressed 
that it was only through a daily effort to know others better and 
respect them that we would he able to tackle at source the 
problems of marginalization, indifference, resentment and 
hatred. This is the only way to break the vicious cirele that 
leads (rom insults to confrontation and the use of foree. 
We must identify the roots of global problems and strive, 
with imagination and determination, to cheek eonlfliets in their 
carly stages. Better still prevent them. Prevention is the vietory 
that gives the measure of our distinctively human faculties. 
We must know in order to foresee. Foresee in order to prevent. 
We must act in a timely, decisive and courageous manner, know- 
ing that prevention engages the attention only when it fails. 
Peace, health and normality do not make the news. We shall 
lave to try to give greater prominence to these intangibles, 
these unheralded triumphs. 
A universal renunciation of violenee requires the commit- 
ment of the whole of society. These are not matters of govern- 
ment but matters of State; not only matters for the authorities, 
but for soeiety in its entirety (including civilian, military, and 
religious bodies). The mobilization which is urgently needed to 
elfect the transition within two er three years (rom a enlture 
of war to a culture of peace demands co-operation from every- 
one. In order to change, the world needs everyone. A new 
approach to security is required at world, regional and national 
levels. The armed forees must be the guarantors of dewiocera- 
tic stability and the protection of the eitizen, heeause we can- 
not move (row systems of complete security and no freedom to 
systems of complete freedom and no security. Ministries of war 
and defenee must gradually be turned into ministries of peace. 
Decision-making procedures and measures to deal witli emer- 
gencies must be specially designed to ensure speed, eo-ordina- 
tion and effectiveness. We are prepared for improbable wars 
involving the large-scale deployment of inordinately costly equip- 
ment, hut we are not equipped to detect and mitigate the nat- 
ural orman-provoked disasters that oecur repeatedly. We are vul- 
nerable to the inelemeney of the weather, to the vicissitudes of 
nature. The protection of the eitizen must he seen as one of the 
major tasks of society as a whole if we really wish to eonsoli- 
date a framework for genntinely democratic living. Investing in 
emergency help and relief measures and—above all—in preven- 
tion and the long term (for example, in continent-wide water dis- 
tribution and storage networks) is to be prepared for peaee, to 
he prepared to live in peace. Currently, we are prepared for 
possible war, but find eurselves surprised and defenecless in our 
daily lives in the [ace of mishaps of all kinds. 
The United Nations system must likewise equip itself with 
the necessary response capacity to prevent the reeurrenee of 
atrocities and instanees of genocide such as those which today 
allliet our collective conscience—Cambodia, Bosnia and Ilerze- 
govina, Liberia, Somalia and Rwanda... 
There is today a general desire for peace, and we must applaud 
the clear thinking and strength of mind displayed by all the war- 
ring parties in the accords that have been reached in E1 Salvador, 
Namibia, Mozambique, Angola, South Afriea, Guatemala and the 
Philippines. These agreements fill us with hope but also sad- 
ness, when we think of the lives sacrificed on the long road to 
the cease-fire, and of the open wounds, so difficult to heal. Thus, 
as we revive the coneept of the “construction of peaee in the »

### 109300: Declaration by Federico Mayor: the human right to peace

» minds of men”, we now call on all adversaries who still put their 
trust in weapous to lay down their arms and seek reconciliation. 
Condemnation will not suffice. It is time for action. It is 
not enough to feel outrage when we learn of the number of 
children exploited sexnally or at work, of refugees or of those 
suffering from hunger. We mnust react, each of us to the best 
of our abilities. tis not just a matter of looking at what the gov- 
ernment is doing. We must part with something of “our own”. 
We must give, give of ourselves. We must stop imposing mod- 
els of development, models [or living. The right to peace, to live 
in peace, implies jettisoning the belief that some are virtuous 
and correct while others are wrong, and that some are always 
giving while others are always in need. 
It is clear that we cannot simultaneously pay the price of war 
and the priee of peace. Guaranteeing lifelong education for 
all would enables to: control population growth, improve the 
quality of life, increase civic participation, reduce migratory 
flows, level out differences in income, assert cultural identity 
and prevent the destruction of the environment through sub- 
stantial changes in energy use patterns and urban transport; pro- 
mote endogenous development and the transfer of knowledge; 
foster the swift and effective operation of justice, with appro- 
priate machinery {or international co-operation; provide the 
United Nations system with appropriate facilities to tackle 
transnational problems in time. None of this ean be achieved in 
a context of war. What is needed, then, is to reduce the invest- 
ment in arms and destruction ir order to increase investment in 
the construction of peace. 
Education by example 
The distillation of traditions, thoughts, languages, forms of 
expression, memories, things forgotten, wishes, dreams, exper- 
iments, rejections, culture finds its supreme expression in our 
everyday behaviour. Infinite cultural diversity is our great 
resource, which is underpinned—this is our strength—Dby uni- 
versal cultural values that must be passed on from the cradle to 
  the grave. Family members—especially mothers—teachers, the 
media, everyone must help to spread the ethical principles, the 
universal guidelines that are so necessary today for haves and 
have-nots alike: the latter because they have a right to the basie 
minimum standards that human dignity denrands; the more for- 
tunate because material goods fail to deliver the expected plea- 
sure. Where there is no longing, possession brings no enjoyment. 
In education, tools are useful. But nothing ean replace the 
friendly words of a teacher, or the caresses and smiles of parents. 
The only real education is education by example . . . and love. 
Learning without fronticrs—whether geographical, or {ron- 
tiers of age or language—can help to change the world, by 
eliminating or reducing the many barriers that today impede 
universal access to knowledge and education. Education must 
help to strengthen, reclaim and develop the culture and iden- 
tity of peoples. 
Globalization carries with it a danger of uniformity and 
increases the temptation to turn inwards and take refuge in all 
kinds of convictions—religious, ideological, cultural, or nation- 
- A

alistic. Confronted with this threat, we must “emphasize the 
forms of learning and critical thinking that enable individuals to 
understand changing environments, create new knowledge and 
shape their own destinies”. Indigenous peoples must be placed 
on an equal footing with other cultures, participating fully in the 
drafting and application of laws, Peace ineans diversity, a blend- 
ing—of “hybrid, wandering cultures” as Carlos Fuentes put it; 
it means multi-ethnic and multilingual societies. Peace is not 
an abstract idea but one rooted firmly in cultural, political, 
social and economic contexts. 
Eliminating violence 
Above all, this profound transformation from oppression and con- 
{inement to openness and generosity, this change based on the 
daily use by all of us of the verh “to share” —which is the key to 
a new futnre—cannot be achieved without our young people, 
and certainly not behind their backs. We must tell them—they 
who represent our hope, who ave calling for our help and who seek 
in us and in external authorities the answers to their uneertaintics 
and preoecupations—that it is in themselves that they must dis- 
cover the answers, that the motivations and glimpses of light that 
they are seeking can be found within themselves. Although at 
times it may be difficult, given both their consternation and our 
own, to present the situation to them in those terns, our position 
as lifelong teachers and learners obliges us to say to young people, 
as Cavafy putitin a poem: “Ithaca gave you the journey. . . . She 
has nothing left to give you now”. Each according to his own plan. 
Each according to his own way of thinking. Free from self-serving 
outside interferenee, especially when it robs the young of their own 
“core”, the intellect, talent and resourcefulness which are the most 
precious individual and collective treasure of humankind. Sects 
and the escape provided by drug addiction are the clearest symp- 
toms of this pathological state of mind that is our great problem 
today. Indeed, education means activating this immense potential 
and using it to its fullest so that cach may become the master and 
architect of his or her own destiny. We cannot give to youth what 
we no longer possess in youthful vitality but instead we can offer 
what we have learned through experience, the frnit of our failures 
and successes, of the burdens, joys, pain, and perplexity and the 
renewed inspiration of each new moment. 
Let youth hold high the banner of peace and justice! So con- 
vinced am I of the relevance of this goal to the proper fulfilment 
of our mission that T have proposed to the General Conference that 
it designate “UNESCO and youth” as a central topic for discussion 
atits next session. That will be an appropriate moment since the 
General Conference will be considering for adoption the “Decla- 
ration on the Safeguarding of Future Generations”. 
At all the United Nations conferences, regardless of the sub- 
ject under consideration (environment, population, social devel- 
opment, human rights and democracy, women, housing), there 
has heen a consensus that education is the key to the urgently 
needed change in the direction pursued by today’s world, which 
is increasing disparities in the possession of material goods and 
knowledge, instead of reducing them. To invest in education is not 
only to respect a fundamental right but also to build peace and

progress for the world’s peoples. Education for all, by all, through- 
out life: thisis the great challenge. One whicli allows of no delay. 
Eaeh child is the most important heritage to be preserved. UNESCO 
may at times give the impression that it is only interested in pre- 
serving stone monuments or natural landseapes. That is not true. 
Those efforts are the most visible. And the heritage thus safe- 
guarded the least vulnerable. But we must protect our entire 
heritage: the spiritual, the intangible, the genetie heritage— 
and, especially, cthies. These are the basic, universal values that 
our Constitntion sets forth with inspired elarity. If we sincerely 
believe that eacli ehild is our child, then we must radically change 
the parameters of the “globalization” currently under way. And 
the human being must become the beneficiary and main actor of 
all our policies and strategies. 
A system collapsed in 1989 heeanse, concentrating on equal- 
ity, it forgot liberty. The present system focused on liberty, will 
know the same fate if it forgets equality—and solidarity. The 
din made as the “Iron Curtain” eollapsed drowned out the 
tremor that ran through the foundations of the “winning” side 
in the Cold War. We mnst, then, for the sake of hoth principle 
and self-interest, redouble in every field the fight against exelu- 
sion and marginalization. We must all feel involved. We must all 
work to ease the great transition from the logic of force to the 
force of reason; from oppression to dialogue; from isolation to 
interaction and peaceful coexistence. But first we nrust live, and 
give meaning to life. Eliminating violence: that is our resolve, 
Preventing violence and compulsion hy going, as I said before, 
to the very sources of resentment, extremism, dogmatism and 
fatalism. Poverty, ignorance, discrimination and exelusion are 
forms of violence which can cause—although they can never jus- 
tify—aggression, the use of force and fratrieidal conflict. 
Swords into ploughshares 
A peace eonsciousness—in the interests of living together, of sei- 
enee and its applications—does not appear overnight, nor ean 
it be imposed by deeree. First comes disillusionment with 
materialism and enslavement to the market, and then a return 
to freedom of thought and action, sincerity, austerity, the 
indomitable force of the mind, the key to peace and to war, as 
affirmed by the founders of UNESCO. 
Science is always positive, but the same cannot always be 
said of its applications. Advancesin technology and knowledge 
can be used to enrich or to impoverish the lives of human 
beings; they can help to develop their identity and enhanee 
their capacities or, on the contrary, they can he nsed to under- 
mine the personality and eoarsen human talent. Only conscience, 
whiel is responsibility—and thus ethical and moral—can make 
good use of the artefacts of reason. Conscience must workin tan- 
dem with reason. To the ethics of responsibility we must add 
an ethies of conviction and will. The former springs from knowl- 
edge, and the latter from passion, compassion and wisdom. 
We are now approaching the end of a century of amazing sei- 
entific and technological progress: we ean diagnose and treat 
any diseases which cause suffering and death; we communi- 
cate with extraordinary clarity and speed; we have at our dis- 
posal instant, limitless information. However, antibioties and 
telecommuuications do not eompensate for the bloody eon- 
{licts whieh have ent down nillions of lives in their prime and 
mflicted indeseribable suffering on so many innocent people. All 
the obscenities of war, brought liome to us nowadays by audio- 
visual equipment, do not seem able to halt the advanee of the 
huge war machine set up and maintained over many centuries. 
Present generations have the almost impossible, biblical task 
of “beating their swords into ploughshares” and making the 
transition from an instinet for war—developed sinee tine 
immemorial—to a feeling for peace. To achieve this would be 
the best and most noble act that the “global village” could 
accomplish, and the best legacy to our descendants. With what 
satisfaction and relief should we be able to look into the eyes 
of our ehildren! It would he also the best way to celebrate the 
fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of lluman 
Rights, in 1998. 
Other “rights” have heen added since 1948. These should 
all be taken into acconnt, and to them should be added the right 
whieh underlies them all: the right to peace—the right to live 
in peace! The right to our own “personal sovereignty”, to respect 
for life and dignity. 
Constructing the defences 
of peace 
Human rights! At the dawn of the new millennium, our ideal 
must he to put them into pracetiee, to add to them, to live and 
breathe them, to relive them, to vevive them with every new day! 
No one nation, institution or person should feel entitled to lay 
sole elaint to hunran rights, still less to determine others’ ere- 
dentials in this regard. Human rights ean neither be owned nor 
given, but nist be won and deserved afresh with every passing 
day. Nov should they be regarded as an abstraction, but rather 
as practical guidelines for action which should be part of the 
lives of all men and women and enshrined in the laws of every 
country. Let us translate the Declaration into all languages; 
letit be studied in every classroom and every ome, all over the 
world! Today’s ideal may thus become the happy reality of 
tomorrow! Learning to know, to do, to he and to live together! 
Fappeal to all families, educators, religious figures, parlia- 
mentarians, politicians, artists, intellectuals, seientists, eraft- 
workers and journalists, to all humanitarian, sporting and cultural 
organizations and to the media to spread a message of toler- 
ance, non-violence, peace and justice. Our aim must be to foster 
understanding, generosity and solidarity, so that with our minds 
move focused on the future than on the past, we may be able to 
look alicad together and build, however diffieult the conditions 
or inhospitable the setting, a future of peace, which is a fun- 
damental vight and prerequisite. Thus, “We, the people” will 
have fulfilled the promise we made in 1945, onr eyes still scared 
by the most abominable images of the terrible conflict that had 
justended—"to save suceeeding generations from the sconrge of 
war,“

### 109301: Sarajevo's battered soul

Sarajevo’s battered 
~ “The day the Sarajevo Library 
“burned down, in 1992, and 
the ashes rained gently down over 
the city,” says Maja Barlich, a staff 
member of Bosnia and Herzegov- 
ina’s Institute for the Protection of 
the Heritage, with sadness in her 
voice, “everyone was crying, as if 
they had lost someone dear to 
them.” 
The magnificent Viennese-style 
building which stood on the cdge 
of the Ottoman quarter, grandly 
embodying the city’s cultural iden- 
tity, spirit and history, was 
destroyed by the fury and accurate 
shelling of fighting men. The ruins 
did not, however, remain silent for 
long. Music soon took possession 
of the shell of the building, herald-

ing a kind of cultural resistance 
movement. “We still went to the 
ruined library during the war,” Maja 
Barlich recalls. “Several concerts were 
given there—I remember hearing 
Mozart’s Requiem.” Ruined build- 
ings nearby were made the venue 
for film festivals and other cultural 
events. Despite the shelling and 
bombing, Sarajevo’s pulse went on 
beating regularly. 
Unlike its illustrious neigh- 
bours such as Dubrovnik or 
Budapest, Sarajevo never enjoyed 
the reputation of being an impor- 
tant cultural centre. Built in a nar- 
row valley, the city and its five cen- 
turies of history are strung out for 
seven kilometres along the notori- 
ous “Sniper Alley” and beside the

rushing waters of the Miljacka, now 
flowing clear once more. 
Leaving behind the seriously 
shell-damaged high-rise blocks of 
flats of the Tito period, the.trav- 
eller arrives in the city centre, where 
the strictly classical architecture and 
the ochre and pink mansions, now 
windowless or unsafe, serve as a 
reminder that this was part of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire until 
early in the century. Then comes the 
fifteenth-century Ottoman quar- 
ter, Bascarsija with its maze of 
medieval lanes and the oriental 
charms of Slatilo coe, the “Sweet 
corner”, so called because of its 
many pastry shops. This old neigh- 
bourhood was relatively little dam- 
aged and soon came back to life. Its 
shops reopened quickly, and the 
imposing Begova Disrinja mosque 
is being rebuilt. 
“Sarajevo was very badly dam- 
aged,” emphasizes Colin Kaiser, head 
of UNESCO’s Sarajevo office. “They 
wanted to smash the city’s identity.

savagery of ethnic cleansing

the library, the National Museum 
and the Oriental Institute. A whole 
segment of Bosnia and Herzegov-

Thesselection of targets and the accu- 
racy of fire produced terrible results: 
universities, schools, research estab- 
lishments, museums and the finest 
of the Austro-Hungarian mansions 
were systematically targeted. The dif- 
ference in the amount of damage 
done to religious buildings is no 
coincidence: the Orthodox church 
and cathedral seem to have survived 
unscathed but some of the mosques 
in the Ottoman quarter were heavily 
bombarded. Some of the old resi- 
dential neighbourhoods also suf- 
fered badly; many houses that were 
thought to have been spared were in 
fact hit by shells. 
Piecemeal

wasteland. “The city has been chang-

ing very rapidly of late,” explains 
Francis Bueb, the founder of the 
André Malraux Cultural Centre, 
which was set up while the war was 
still raging. “The streets have been 
cleaned up, the rubble cleared, the 
burned-out cars removed and the 
broken windows replaced.” The 
reconstruction of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina has begun, albeit ona 
modest scale. 
The rebuilding of the cultural 
heritage may seem to be of sec- 
ondary importance to the major 
institutions which are hard at work 
finding funds for urgent small-scale 
projects, but for the people who 
live here, the return to normality 
also involves the rebuilding of their 
cultural identity. “Destroying our 
heritage was a way of denying our 
existence”, says Maja Barlich. “The 
cultural monuments and sites have 
to be restored in order for us to 
recover our national traditions and 
identity.” 
Lack of co-ordination 
Urgent action is needed. Winds can 
be very violent in Sarajevo and can 
hasten the collapse of weakened 
buildings, while the lack of co-ordi- 
nation in international reconstruc- 
tion efforts is hampering opera- 
tions. Since the Dayton agreement 
was signed, such cfforts have 
increased in number but there has 
not been enough co-ordination, 
some countries financing operations 
without knowing whether or not 
other countries have already drawn 
up estimates for the same project. 
This lack of co-ordination is pre- 
venting full realization of the objec- 
tives: Austria, for example, with the 
help of European Union funding, 
has undertaken the cleaning and 
protection of the library, but no- 
one knows who will be responsi- 
ble for the next stage of the opera- 
tion (the total cost of which has 
been reckoned at around $14 mil- 
lion). Discussion has begun as to 
whether the library will recover the 
literary, cultural and historical func- 
tions it had before the war or be 
assigned other functions of a more 
administrative nature, such as ithad »

» in its early days. The debate is sure 
to be lively, in view of the build- 
ing’s symbolic importance. 
The political make-up of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina is scarcely con- 
ducive to making the country’s cul- 
tural reconstruction any simpler: 
cach of the ten districts composing 
the Muslim-Croat Federation, for 
instance, has responsibilities in the 
field of culture, but some districts 
have no suitable structure to dis- 
charge these responsibilities. 
On the road to 
reconstruction 


### 109301: Sarajevo's battered soul

“At present there is no interna- 
tional-level order of priorities,” says 
Colin Kaiser. “The precise extent of 
damage to cultural property in the 
Muslim-Croat Federation is 
unknown and, apart from exten- 
sive damage to religious buildings— 
mosques and Catholic churches— 
little is known about the situation 
in the Serb Republic. This is why 
we want to set up a forward-look- 
ing programme for the reconstruc- 
tion of the country’s cultural her- 
itage.” UNESCO is due to send a 
mission to Sarajevo in the near 
future for that purpose. 
For the time being, the main 
project is for the rehabilitation of 
the old town of Mostar, a pro- 
gramme financed by the Italian gov- 
ernment, and for the restoration of 
a mosque, also in Mostar, funded 
by Saudi Arabia. 
In October 1996 UNESCO, 
which has already been playing a 
part in the refurbishment of the 
National Museum, organized a sem- 
inar on the reconstruction of the 
cultural heritage, enabling interna- 
tional experts to work alongside 
Bosnian student architects and local 
engineers. “There were 35 local par- 
ticipants and experts from all over 
the world,” explains Sibyl Renaud, 
administrative officer in UNESCO's 
Sarajevo office. “They worked on 
two cases in Sarajevo—the library 
and the old Ottoman quarter—and 
three building sites in Mostar.” 
According to Frencharchitect].- 
L. Taupin, a historic monuments spe- 
cialist who took part in the seminar, 
“coexistence is working well. We can- 
not imagine the reconstruction of 
Sarajevo without the city’s history 
being taken into consideration.” HW

Affairs, talksto 
Jasmina Sopova. 
Hl The pictures coming out of 
Albania since March 1997 show a 
country in turmoil. The media 
report army barracks being 
sacked, automatic rifles heing 
freely toted around, curfews 
being imposed, European soldiers 
being landed for Operation Alba, 
snap elections being called and so 
aon, but not a word about culture. 
Ylljet Alicka: In times of trouble, 
unfortunately, culture is not 
regarded as a priority inside the 
country any more than it is out- 
side. The damage that is being 
inflicted on Albania’s culture is per- 
haps less serious than the economic 
harm it is suffering, but it is 
irreparable: in time the economy 
will recover, but artefacts bearing 
witness to centuries of culture will 
have disappeared forever. 
Hl What is the bill for the damage? 
Y. A. [tis hard to say with any cer- 
tainty at present, just as itis hard to 
say what is the motivation behind 
it: 1sit wanton destruction or delib- 
erate looting? The estimated cost of 
damage to cultural property amounts 
to around $800,000. Many municipal 
buildings, cinemas and muscums 
Albania’s 
 
have been wrecked. The Tirana Fac- 
ulty of Agriculture, which was par- 
ticularly well computerized, has been 
plundered, and some 400,000 books 
have gone up in flames. 
Hl Is there a parallel here with 
what happened to the Sarajevo 
library? 
Y. A.: No, the books were not 
burned for the same reasons. In Sara- 
jevo the aim was to destroy a cen- 
turies-old heritage that was shared 
by the different communities, to 
wipe the slate of history clean. In 
Albania, where the different ethnic 
groups have historically lived 
together in harmony, I would say 
the burning of the books led on 
from the street fighting. The books

### 109309: Forests: a breathing space for the planet

Greenwatch 
| orests: 
a breathing 
space for 
the planet 
by France Bequette 
  
 
Forests are the earth’s most 
complex and elaborate natural 
ecosystems, They cover about 10 
per cent of the planet’s surface and 
26 per cent of the eontinental sur- 
face area (excluding Greenland and 
Antarctica). The globe’s biggest pro- 
ducers of biomass, they exercise 
great influence on energy exchanges 
between the atmosphere and the 
ground, intercepting solar radiation, 
acting as a windbreak, fixing carbon 
dioxide and returning a great deal 
of water vapour to the atmosphere 
via evapotranspiration. They are 
directly dependent on the climate 
and also one of its main regulators. 
THE PRIMEVAL FOREST 
Some 300 million years ago forests 
of tree ferns and giant horsetail cov- 
ered the earth. Traces of them ean be 
found in coal deposits. Then the 
oceans submerged the continents. 
When the water retreated about 260 
million years ago, conifers appeared, 
followed some 130 million years later 
by broad-leaved trees. 
In the Tertiavy era, about 50 mil- 
lion years ago, the northern hemi- 
sphere had a mild elimate that was 
propitious for the development of 
THE UNESCO Courier W JULY-AUGUST 1997 
plant life and was brought to an end 
by the onset of an Ice age. The fate 
of vegetation was strongly influenced 
by the location of mountain chains. 
Europe’s east-west mountain mas- 
sifs prevented the migration of 
plants, and tropical and sub-tropi- 
cal species died from the cold. In 
the Anmiericas on the other hand the 
mountains run on a north-south axis 
and presented no such obstacle. East 
Asiahadnolece age and a large num- 
ber of species survived there and 
later successfully reacelimatized to 
places where they had once pros- 
pered. This explains why the parks 
and gardens of Europe contain maid- 
enhair, magnolia, maple and cherry 
trees imported from Asia. 
There are four major types of 
forest (boreal-conifler, temperate- 
broad leaf, scrubland and rain for- 
est). Conifers are dominant in the 
boreal forest, from Alaska to 
    
Olive trees in 
Andalusia 
{Spain).

Siberia and Kamchatka, interining-

The dark foliage of pines contrasts 
with the white trunks of birches, 
and the grass between the trees is 
splashed with the colours of a thou-

of the Northern hemisphere—it is 
too hot in the Southern hemi- 
sphere—the appearance of the for-

Their leaves change colour from

chaparral. Intropical areas the lux- 
uriant forest demands an even heat 
and plenty of rain throughout the 
year. The trees reach for the sky in 
search of sunlight, sometimes climh- 
ing to 50 or 60 metres amidst a tan- 
ole of lianas and epiphytes, 
ACARBON RESERVOIR 
We know more than we did about 
the interactions between forest and 
climate, but they still give rise to 
debate among specialists. Gilbert 
Aussenac of the Freneh National 
Institute of Agronomic Research 
(INRA) believes that the forest is a 
more effective sunlight trap than 
any other plant formation. Heat 
stocked in the morning is restored 
to the atmosphere in the evening. 
When it comes into contact with 
humid air hovering above the for- 
est, 1t causes rainstorms. 
Inorder to show that the rainfall 
regime is strongly inllueneed by the 
forest cover, scientists have made a 
model of the total deforestation of 
the 5-niillion-km? Amazon basin, In 
this hypothesis the temperature of 
the air would rise by from 1° to 3°C 
because of the fall in evapotranspi- 
ration, which would also result in a 26 
per cent decrease in rainfall! 
Less well known, but vital for the 
future of the earth’s climate, is the 
relationship between the forest and 
the increase in atmospheric carbon 
dioxide (CO,). The concentration of 
CO, in the carth’s atmosphere has 
risen from 280 volumes per million 
Tropical rain 
forest in 
Cameroon. 
{vpm) at the beginning of the indns- 
trial era to 360 volumes today. This 
is a staggering increase when eom- 
pared with the 80-vpm rise that 
took place in the 200,000 preceding 
years, as calculated from measure- 
ments made in microbubbles eon- 
tained in polar ice. The figure may 
well double by the middle of the 
next century. 
Forests play a dual role in the 
carth’s earbon eyele by absorbing a 
large amount of the CO, contained 
in the atmosphere and also by emit- 
ting CO,. The biosphere and the 
atmosphere annually exchange enor- 
mous amounts of earbon. The annual 
flow of atmospheric CO, fixed in 
plants by photosynthesis amounts to 
some 100 billion tons, but this 1s 
almost entirely connterbalanced by a 
reverse [low cansed by the breathing 
of plants and micro-organisms in the 
soil such as bacteria and fungi, which

decompose ground litter and organic 
matter. If, for the moment, forest 
ecosystems are fairly good sponges 
for absorbing the CO, which we pro- 
dee and which helps thent to grow, 
they will no longer be able to do so if 
emissions continue to increase and 
deforestation is not halted. 
DEFORESTATION 
According to the Food and Agrienl- 
ture Organization of the United 
Nations (FAQ), whichis carrying ont 
a Forest Resources Assessment Pro- 
gramme, forests covered some 3,451 
million hectares world-wide in 1995, 
somewhat more than half of which 
were locatedin developing countries. 
Between 1990 and 1995 the world’s 
forests nnderwent an estimated net 
loss of 56.3 million hectares, com- 
prising a loss of 65.1 million hectares 
in developing countries partly offset 
hy aninerease of 8.8 million hectares 
in the industrialized countries. For- 
est loss was not, however, as great as 
predicted and has decreased overall. 
Some communities have no 
choice but to contribute to defor- 
estation, In dryland and upland areas 
exposed to erosion, for example, 
needy eommunities chop down the 
sparse trees to provide fuel, food 
and a meagre source of income. 
Other contributory factors are over- 
grazing, extensive farming and fire— 
the seourge of dry forests of the 
Mediterrancan variety.

PLASTIC PLANTS 
Plastic exists naturally, albeit 
inminute amonnts, in the leaves 
of many plants, including cotton 
or mustard, but is far more 
expensive to extract than pro- 
duce synthetically. Ilowever, 
scientists now hope to increase 
the plastic production capac- 
ity of certain plants through 
genetic engineering, so that 
some commercially grown 
species such as sweet corn 
could become veritable “plastic 
factories”. But there are still 
many imponderables, and so far 
cultivated biodegradable plas- 
tic remains a pipedream. Wl 
A BREATH 
OF FRESH AIR 
Air pollution is having increas- 
ingly damaging effects on health 
in the world’s big cities. In Bom- 
bay, for example, where the lev- 
els of lead in the air are esti- 
mated to have donbled between 
1980 and 1987, it is thought to 
be responsible [or a steep rise 
in respiratory ailments, heart 
disease and skin allergies. The 
World Bank and the United 
Natious Development Pro- 
gramue have launched an urban 
air quality management pro- 
sramme as part of their hroader 
programme to help five Asian 
urban areas (Beijing, Bombay, 
Colombo, Jakarta, Kathmandu 
and greater Manila) solve their

main measures proposed, Hl 
LIGHTENING 
THE PRESSURE 
ON CORK 
Cork, an impermeable protec- 
tive material that grows as the 
inner bark of certain trees, 
forms a partienlarly thick layer 
in cork oak trees, which are 
grown on a conmunereial basis. 
Bat it takes a 25-year growth 
period before the tree pro- 
dnces its first yield, followed 
by a 10-year wait between each 
harvest. In order to meet grow- 
ing demand, cork is now being 
harvested too frequently, weak- 
ening trees whieh have also 
been threatened by a llarmful 
fungus since 1992, In 1996 a 
Belgian organization called Le 
Petit Liege (The Little Cork) 
launched an operation to col- 
leet all discarded cork objects 
for recyeling. Cork is a good 
lieat and sound insnlator, and 
alter being ground is used in the 
building industry. Recycling of 
this kind could help take the 
pressure off cork oaks in 
France, Spain and Portugal. B 
ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY 
CHEWING GUM 
Fed up with finding picees of 
chewed gum stnek on chairs, 
desks and even statues in puh- 
lic places, an American inven- 
tor has patented a new kind of 
chewing gum that turns brittle 
when discarded and can he cas 
ily removed from surfaces. The 
gum will also dissolve in the 
month alter a period of chew- 
ing and can even be swallowed 
withont disagreeable alter- 
elleets, | 
HEAVY 
EATERS 
In the United States a number 
of sites contaminated by heavy 
metals are awaiting cleanup 
nicasures. But traditional soil- 
washing technology is costly and 
impoverishes the soil, and as a 
result there is growing interest in 
plant-based soil-cleansing tech- 
niques. Two scientists are exper- 
imenting with plants called 
hyperacenmnlators, which may 
do the job less quickly but are 
far more economical, environ- 
ment-friendly and effective. 
Iyperacenmulators ean absorb 
metallic and other pollutants in 
concentrations from 10 to 100 
times the accumulation of a 
metal tolerated by ordinary 
crops. A small shrub called 
Alpine pennyeress (Thlaspi 
caerulescens), for example, 
digests zine, cadmium and 
nickel; and carrots absorh DDT 
(see “Initiatives” in the UNESCO 
Courier, November 1996). The 
scientists even wonder whether 
some hyperaccumulators eonld 
be used to farm metals as an 
alternative to mining! | 
POLLUTION 
HITS CASPIAN 
FISHERIES 
Serious pollution and heavy 
overfishing are endangering the 
marine resonrces of the Caspian 
Sea. In Iran, for example, stur- 
econ catches are 75 per cent 
down on 1984. After cutting its 
quotas by half, Iran has drawn 
up a sturgeon hatcheries devel- 
opment plan designed to boost 
caviare production. It has also 
concluded agreements with 
neighbouring countries to 
deterinine catch shares and 
control poaching. Certain types 
of net are being outlawed, and 
the potential of some fish 
speeies for human eonsnmption 
is being reassessed. | 
TROPICAL FOREST 
CORNUCOPIA 
An expanded and updated two- 
volume edition of Tropical 
Forests, People and Food has 
been published in French by 
UNESCO’ Man and the Bios- 
phere Programme. The original 
I-volume English edition was 
first published in 1993. The 
study examines food resources, 
food production and consump- 
tion and the cultural founda- 
tions for [ood choices and devel- 
opment strategies, The English 
edition contains 74 scientific 
articles about the daily lives of 
people living in tropical areas, 
their habits, their beliefs and 
their understanding of the lor- 
est’s resources. This richly doe- 
umented volume is a must for 
anyone interested in tropical 
development. | 
EARTHWORM FERTILIZER 
The French Institute of Seien- 
tific Research for Developnient 
in Co-operation (ORSTOM), the 
University of Sambalpur (India) 
and an Indian farming company 
have pioneered the nse of earth- 
worms to replace lertilizer on tea 
plantations. The carthworm is a 
useful ally because it enriclies 
the soil by its droppings which 
are richin minerals (nitrogen and 
phosphates) and lmmus. By 
making tunnels it improves soil 
drainage and aeration. It also 
stimulates the fungi that live in 
symbiosis with tea-bnsh roots 
and promotes water, nitrogen and 
phosphorns absorption. The 
selected worms, which belong to 
a particularly active local vari- 
ety, are raised on the plantations. 
The results speak for themselves: 
tea production has risen by 35 
to 240 per eent depending on the 
site, and consumption of chemi- 
cal fertilizer has heen halved Hl

HERITAGE 
by Cécile Romane 
After a century of archaeological 
investigation, the remains of the city-state of 
Teotihuacan (Mexico) still guard many of their 
secrets. This pre-hispanic site, the largest in 
Mesoamerica, was included on Unesco's World 
  
Heritage List in 1987. 
THE UNESCO Gourisr WB [ULY-AUGUST 1997

EOTIHUACAN El 
et i a : 
 
Lh — pi, 
In the absence of written 
records, the history of 
Teotihuacan, the former capital 
of the greatest pre-Columbian 
urban civilization in the Valley of 
Mexico (2nd to 7th eenturies), 
lying forty kilometres north of 
Mexico City, is still shrouded in 
mystery. 
It was founded late in the first 
century A.D. although the date 
cannot be definitively confirmed 
in the present state of archaco- 
logical excavations. [t extended 
over 40 square kilometres and 
housed a sizeable population. The 
number of inhabitants is esti- 
mated to have ranged from 
100,000 to 160,000, depending 
on the period. 
After reaching its apogee 
between the fourth and fifth cen- 
turies, 
according to recent datings (1996), 
it suddenly faded away,

tnry. We do not know the exact 
reason why this culture died ont, 
but its decline is thought to have 
been hastened by changes in the 
ground water level and hence in 
the availability of water supplies. 
The oviginal name of the city is 
unknown. The Aztees called it 
“city of the 
gods”) when they discovered its vast 
r. It scemed to 
them so imposing that only the gods 
could have built it and that they 
had ereated the Fifth Sun there 
(see the Unesco Courier, “The sun, 
ancient myths, new technologies”, 
January 1995, p. 12).

THE CEREMONIAL CENTRE 
A straight 40-metre-wide high- 
way, known as the Avenue of the 
Dead, runs for more than two kilo- 
metres in a clearly visible sueces- 
sion of rectangular squares, al on 
the same level with access stair- 
ways. [It then continues for 
another three kilometres, still 
straight as a die, but with less for- 
mally structured adjoining arehi- 
teeture. This grandiose prospect

2,000 residential properties 
divided into many “apartments”, 
forerunners of the modern housing 
block. 
Most of the ntonuments in 
Teotihuaedn’s ceremonial centre 
which, vast though it is, represents 
only 10 per cent of the eity’s total 
arca, stood on this Avenue. The 
most imposing of all, the Pyramid 
of the Sun (225 x 222 metres at 
the base), is the world’s third 
tallest pyramid. Located on the 
cast side of the Avenue, it now 
rises to a height of aronnd 63 
metres (it was originally 75 metres 
tall) and has a volume of one mil- 
lion enbie metres. 
The less colossal hat equally 
massive Pyramid of the Moon (150 
x 110 metres at the hase and 42 
metres high) stands at the northern 
end of the Avenue of the Dead and 
consists of four superimposed plat- 
forms, cach set haek from the oth- 
ers. The palace of Quetzalpapalotl, 
the mythical Bird-Butterily, lies 
on a square precinet in front of 
this pyramid. The bird-butterfly 
is represented in bas-reliefs on the 
patio pillars. This edifice, one of

South of the Avenue of the 
Dead rises the immense ¢gnadran- 
cular strueture of the “Citadel” 
with a side length of around 100 
metres and a total surface area of 
just under seven hectares, The 
square which it forms is delimited 
by four platforms (mistakenly 
believed hy the Spaniards to be the 
walls of a fortress). Te could easily 
accommodate 100,000 persons. 
Here stands the Pyramid of 
Quetzaledatl, or the Plumed Ser- 
pent. The monumental steps of 
its Western facade have heen pre- 
served in exeellent condition. The 
typical feature of Teotihuacdn 
architecture is clearly visible 
here. This is known as the “talud- 
tablero” (slope-and-pauel) system, 
i.e. an alternation of inelined 
embankments and vertical panels, 
sencrally adorned with has-reliefs. 
On its four sides, the pyramid 
bears 360 heads of Quetzaledatl, 
These take the shape of eircular 
projeetions with impressive gap- 
ing jaws. 
AN INFLUENTIAL CIVILIZATION 
The city was designed to harmo-

countryside. From the centre of 
the Avenue of the Dead, the siun-

Cerro Gordo, ean be seen tower-

Avenue of the Dead. The adminis- 
trative centre, the market and the 
“citadel” lic on an East-West axis.

which coincides with the sun’s rise 
to its zenith, respects an astro-

have been of very great importance 
to Teotihuacan society. 
This rigidly hierarchical soei- 
ety, which lived from trade, was 
headed by a theoeratic govern- 
ment. The city derived its wealth 
from vast deposits of obsidian and 
fertile soil. The social classes were 
elearly separated according to 
their profession: potters, painters, 
gemstone polishers, farmers, fish- 
ermen, ete. Teotihuaean was a cos- 
mopolitan centre, its population 
consisting of different cthnic 
groups living in different districts. 
The most important economic, 
religious and political centre of 
all Mesoamerica, tt reveals a 
sophisticated knowledge of geom- 
etry, architecture, astronomy and 
art. The mythological scenes fig- 
uring in the paintings which adorn 
the palace walls, the layout of the 
buildings, refleeting astronomical 
rather than military concerns, lead 
us to suppose that this civiliza- 
tion, founded on the cult of ter- 
restrial and agrarian deities, was a 
peaceful one. 
Its influence was felt through- 
out Mesoameriea: two-thirds of 
Mexico as we now know it, 
Guatemala, ITonduras and Belize. 
The art of pottery and eeramie 
ware, in particular, left a lasting 
mark on the cultures of the Mayas 
and Oaxaca. This influence lasted 
for a long time. For centuries, 
other populations continued to 
adore the gods of Teotihuacan: 
Quetzaleoatl, the Plumed ser- 
pent, god of humidity and fertil- 
  
ity, and Tlaloe, the raingod. HW

Excavation and restoration 
The first excavations began in 1884. In 1905-1910, some monuments were restored, e.g. the Pyra- 
mid of the Sun to which the architect, Leopoldo Batres, arbitrarily added a fifth level. The 
“citadel” was discovered and restored in 1917-1920, 
Since 1962, archaeological research has been co-ordinated by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de 
Antropologia e Historia (INAH). More systematic exploration of the site led to the discovery of 
the Palace of the Quetzal Bird-Butterfly and other edifices. Inthe early 1970s, a natural cave orga- 
nized into rooms joined by tunnels was discovered beneath the Pyramid of the Sun. This was a cer- 
emonial setting, but the symbolic function of the edifice, which played a central role in the reli- 
gion of Teotihuacdn, is still unknown, Perhaps it symbolized the mythical centre of creation. 
In 1980 Mexico began a far-reaching excavation and consolidation campaign, the Teotihuacan 
Archaeological Project, in which 600 people worked for two years under the direction of Ruben 
Cabrera of the Mexican National Institute of History and Anthropology. The project, concentrated 
mainly on the south of the Avenue of the Dead, revealed vestiges of later strata than the Teoti- 
huacan civilization, 
Excavations confined to the Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent (1917, 1925, 1939 and 1982) led 
to the discovery of tombs containing skeletons and offerings—obsidian objects, figurines in hard 
stone and sculpted shells. In 1988-1989 the Quetzalcdatl Temple project, a joint venture involv- 
ing Mexican and American archaeologists, explored previously unstudied parts of the citadel. Then 
in 1994-1995 strata subsequent to the Teotihuacdn period were removed during a new Mexican 
campaign. About 200 tombs were discovered in the pyramid itself, at its exact centre, in graves 
under the floor and at the corners. 
In 1973 René Millon of the University of Rochester (United States) began mapping the 
entire site as part of the Teotihuacdn Mapping Project. In his opinion the Pyramid of the Moon 
may contain an inner structure, but the monument has not yet been decoded. ECR, 
Alternating slopes and vertical panels are typical features of 
Teotihuacan’s monuments. Above, the Pyramid of the Sun.

The Fifth International Conference 
on Adult Education 
“Adult learning: a key for the 21st century” is the motto of Unesco’s Fifth 
International Conference on Adult Education (COFINTEA), which is taking place 
from 14 to 18 July in Hamburg (Germany). The Conference, organized by Unesco 
with a number of international partners, is continuing the work of four earlier 
Unesco adult education conferences: Elsinore (Denmark, 1949), Montreal (Canada, 
1960), Tokyo (Japan, 1972) and Paris (France, 1985). 
A major part of the discussions at Hamburg will focus on the theme of 
democracy, i.e. making access to education more democratic and promoting 
democracy through education. This theme links with that of promoting a culture

LITERACY 
Approximately one billion adults 
worldwide are unable to read and 
write. A recent survey revealed 
that even some of the world’s rich-

of adults whose literacy is below 
the level of a primary school leaver: 
approximately 20 per cent in the 
United States, 16 per cent in 
Canada, I5 per cent in Germany 
and 10 per cent in the Nether- 
lands. This means that many adults

Namibia. “Often it is caster to do 
this in non-verbal ways, such as 
through music, dancing, theatre and 
crafts. In our programmes we try to 
combine edueation and culture.” 
At the same time it is neces- 
sary to question the nature and pur- 
pose of education itself. This

includes having respect for cultural 
and linguistic rights instead of using 
education to impose dontinant cul- 
tures and languages on those who 
come {rom a different background. 
MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGIES 
FOR EDUCATION 
Radio and television have long 
heen used in distance learning. 
Now videos, interactive compact 
discs and the Internet are proving 
to be immensely valuable eduea- 
tional tools. The Internet has also 
opened up vast possibilities for 
education, and its potential has 
only just begun to be exploited. 
With an Internet link it should 
eventually be possible for some- 
one to take anything from a liter- 
acy course to a study programme 
in advanced engineering. Already 
there arc courses where stndents 
link up via the Net to hold regutar 
“virtual reality seminars” and to 
carry out joint study projects. 
However, there are serious 
drawbacks to the Internet. For 
vastareas of the developing world 
access to it is either non-existent 
or limited, and where it exists itis 
often too costly for most citizens, 
On the other hand, if the Inter- 
net becomes more widely used, 
there is a real danger that it will 
be an instrument for transferring 
the values, languages and cultural 
norms of the industrialized North, 
Sven with a {ull connection, it is 
difficult to use the Net system- 
atically for edueational purposes. 
Those who attempt to do so are 
often overwhelmed by the sheer 
chaotic multiplieity of informa- 
tion that surges back and forth 
over the information highway. 
In the twenty-first century the 
publie must learn to become 
active, eritical and diseriminating 
users of the media. In this way 
they will resist political and com- 
mercial manipulation and be able 
to use the media intelligently for 
educational purposes. |

### 109321: Letters from Asia

Letters from Asia 
by Denis Sinor 
o communicate by means of 
the written word, two con- 
ditions have to be fulfilled: 
the sender and the recipient of the 
communication must be familiar 
with the same language and the same 
script. In carly and medieval Inner 
Asia circumstances did not favour 
the simultaneous existence of both 
conditions. 
In the past, there were far more 
languages than thereare today. This is 
a worldwide phenomenon, the rea- 
sonfor which lies in a steady increase 
in populations which brings closer to 
one another peoples once separated 
by greatdistances. In the process, the 
languages of the smaller peoples tend 
to disappear; their speakers are 
absorbed by a majority population 
using another tongue. There is rea- 
son to believe that in Eurasia alone in 
historical times hundreds of lan- 
guages disappeared, many of them 
without leaving any written trace. 
Others have survived in documents 
now extremely difficult to decipher. 
At the beginning of this century in 
the relatively small area of what is 
today the Chinese province of Xin- 
jlang, texts written in seventeen dif- 
ferent languages were discovered. 
Most of these ceased to be used many 
centuries ago. 
Yet in the past, though less than 
today, people of differing languages 
had to communicate, and the only 
way to do this was, for some of 
them at least, to have command of 
more than one language. While it 
has always been possible for indi- 
viduals to acquire several languages 
through learning, in carlier epochs 
multilingualism was usually a by- 
product of a child’s family circum- 
stances. In Inner Asia and elsewhere 
such individuals often came to serve 
as interpreters or translators. 
The function of interpreters is 
aural and oral: what they hear in one 
language, they transpose into 
- 
another. The function of transla- 
tors is similar, but they use visual 
and manual means. They read a text 
in one language and write it down in 
another. The need to communicate 
by vision—as opposed to audi- 
tion—requires the simultaneous 
command of more than one lan- 
guage and, in many cases, more than 
one script. [t was on competence in 
such skills that cross-cultural com- 
munications depended. 
WRITING FOR A MULTILINGUAL 
READERSHIP 
Few people were literate in the 
period and in the lands with which 
we are concerned, hence correspon- 
dence between them must have been 
sporadic and, as might be expected, 
very few specimens of writing have 
survived. 
It often happened that several 
scripts were used within one lin- 
guistic community. Old Turkic, 
Uighur texts have survived ina num- 
ber of scripts and it is by no means 
certain that even literate speakers 
within that same group could read all 
of them. Further complications arose 
when people using different lan- 
guages and different scripts wished 
to communicate with cach other. 
tt may happen that onc sender 
wishes to communicate with a 
number of recipients. Before the 
invention of printing, texts destined 
for a wider public were often 
engraved in stelae or on mountain- 
sides, to be seen and read by all. In 
Inner Asia such inscriptions were 
very often multilingual. The inscrip- 
tion of Karabalgasun in present-day 
Mongolia provides a good example. 
Made in the middle of the eighth 
century A.D. to glorify the deeds 
of an Uighur ruler, it uses three 
scripts and three languages. The 
Uighur text (an Old-Turkic dialect} 
was engraved inan original runiform 
script; the Sogdian version used the »

Letter from the Mongol Khan

the adversaries, I wonder at you, king of Hungary, that, whenIhad 
already sent three times ambassadors to you; why did you not

you rule alone a big kingdom, Therefore it may be difficult to

submit yourself spontaneously to me. I understand moreover that 
you keep under your protection the Cumans, my servants. I thus 
enjoin you not to keep them with you, and for their sake have me

There are good reasons why 
most of the still extant letters of 
Inner Asian origin were written by 
rulers to rulers. Though illiterate 
themselves, they had at their dis- 
posal scribes who could write on 
their behalf, and their writings had 
a fair chance of being preserved in 
the archives of the recipient. 
The first problem that must have

script in which it had been written. 
Thus the credentials presented to the 
Emperor Justin IT by the Turkish 
ambassador Maniakh, who reached 
Byzantium in 568, were said to have 
been written in the “Scythian script” 
(a general Greek term used to desig- 
nate peoples of the steppe). Unfor- 
tunately, we have no further infor- 
mation on this script. 
On occasion there must have 
been difficulties in finding a trans- 
lator. Such was the casein 1267 when 
Pope Clement IV could find no one 
to translate the Mongol letter sent 
to him by the il-khan Abagha, the 
Mongol ruler of Iran. It appears 
from the Pope’s letter to Abagha 
that previous correspondence had 
been conducted in Latin, a reference 
  
which would suggest that Euro- 
peans, perhaps missionaries, were 
active in the il-khan’s chancery. 
THE TORTUOUS WAYS OF 
TRANSLATION

century the Mongol empire 
expanded well into eastern Europe 
and it became necessary for those 
concerned to establish some rela- 
tions with cach other, to exchange

some letters. The finest picces of 
medieval diplomatic correspondence 
emanating from Inner Asia are the 
letters sent-by the Mongol rulers 
to the Pope and to various western 
princes. 
The carliest known example of 
sucha correspondence 1s embedded in 
a Latin report written by a Domini- 
can Friar called Julian in which he 
described the information he had 
gathered in eastern Europe about the 
Mongols. The letter, addressed to 
King Béla IV of Hungary, had been 
written by a Mongol ruler, proba- 
bly the Great Khan Giyiik, some 
time before Julian's return to Hun- 
gary in December 1237. 
Only the Latin translation of 
the letter has survived. According 
to Julian: “The letter was written 
in pagan characters but in the Tartar 
[i.e. Mongol] tongue, so that the 
king [of Hungary] found many 
who could decipher it but none 
who could understand it. But we, as 
we crossed pagan Cumania, found 
someone who interpreted it for us.” 
Of course the Hungarians them- 
sclves used the Latin script, but they 
had recently offered asylum to the 
Cumans who spoke a Turkic lan-

not enough to understand its con-

something like an ultimatum. 
The laborious process of mul- 
tiple translations is well illustrated 
in observations by the Franciscan 
Friar John of Plano Carpini, who 
was sent as an emissary to the Mon- 
gols by Pope Innocent IV in 1245. 
When the Great Khan Giiytk was 
about to send a letter to the Pope, 
Plano Carpini was asked whether 
there were any people in the Pope’s 
entourage who could read Russian,

gol and to have the text translated, 
there and then, word for word, into 
Latin. The accuracy of this Latin 
translation was then carefully 
checked and the letter was taken to 
Rome, where, in the course of time, 
it was lost. Fortunately, a copy of 
the text is incorporated in the 
chronicle of Carpini’s contempo- 
rary, the monk Salimbene. The 
notaries and scribes working in the 
Great Khan’s court thought it wise, 
for variety’s sake, to prepare a Per- 
sian translation of the Mongol text. 
It was discovered in 1920 in the 
papal archives, and provides us with 
a splendid example of the multilin- 
gual nature of the Mongol chancery. 
The letter has a preamble, writ- 
ten in Uighur, clearly the adminis- 
trative language if not of the Mon- 
gol court, at least of the Uighur 
scribes who manned it. This pre- 
amble was probably the standard 
formula with which letters by the 
 
Great Khans began. It reads: “By 
the strength of Eternal Heaven, 
powerful ruler of the great coun- 
try and of the sca: our command- 
ment.” The preamble is followed 
by a red scal written in Mongol (in 
Uighur script) with a similarly 
worded injunction. 
Giiyik’s letter was meant as an 
answer to onc written by Pope 
Innocent IV and transmitted by 
Carpini himself. It constitutes an 
ultimatum to the Pope and other 
princes of the West who are 
enjoined to appear in person in the 
Mongol court, to pay homage to 
the Great Khan and to listen to his 
orders. Were they to disobey these 
orders, the Great Khan would view 
them as enemies. Gliytk also cate- 
gorically rejects the Pope’s repri- 
mands for Mongol atrocities com- 
mitted in Hungary and elsewhere. 
Such acts, writes the Khan, were

defends his past actions with the 
following reasoning. “From where 
the sun rises to where it goes down, 
all the lands belong to us. Were it 
not for the will of God, how could 
that have happened?” 
In stark contrast with the tone 
and content of this letter is that writ- 
ten in Mongol and sent in 1305 by 
the Mongol il-khan of Persia Oljeitii 
to Philip IV the Fair, king of France. 
By that time old feuds were forgot- 
ten, and the hope of an alliance 
against the Egyptian Mameluks 
seemed desirable to both parties. The 
letter had two aims: to inform the 
king of France that the fratricidal 
struggle between the descendants of 
Chinggis khan had been satisfacto- 
rily settled and that the il-khan was 
ready to follow the friendly poli- 
cies towards France initiated by his 
ancestors. 
The likelihood of anyone's 
being able to read a Mongol letter in 
the French court was dim indeed, 
and Oljeitii acted wisely by choos- 
ing as one of the bearers of his mes- 
sage a2 man who probably spoke 
Mongol as well as French. This was 
the Italian Thomas Ugi of Siena and 
it may be assumed that it was he 
who, on the back of the letter, 
penned an Italian paraphrase of its 
content. (See box this page.)

commercial writings penned by

doned while being carried from cast 
to west. Their exact date cannot be 
established but it seems certain that 
they were written not later than the 
carly fourth century A.D. 
One of them is particularly inter- 
esting, and because of its historical 
references and its moving, one might 
say, tragic content, it stands alone in 
the corpus of medieval Inner Asian 
letters. Written by a certain Nanai- 
vandak, a Sogdian merchant living at 
the castern end of the great trade 
route, it was addressed to his princi- 
pal in Samarkand, some 3,200 kilo- 
metres away. 
“Sir,” writes Nanai-vandak, “if I 
wrote you all the details of how 
China fared, it would be a story of 
debts and woe. ... And, Sir, the last 
emperor [of Chinal—so they say—

ably wanted me to perpetuate the tradition. He 
realized that I was very gifted musically, I was 
already composing at the age of four. 
BW Do you still compose?

five years. When she stopped singing, other 
famous singers asked me to accompany them. 
But my wile put her foot down. “You're already

you cut it off while he’s asleep?” Gala replied: 
“Because he’d drop dead when he woke up and 
saw it gone!” 
BM Do you enjoy conducting an orchestra as much as 
playing? 
M. R.: Yes, the happiness and joy are just as 
intense. Perhaps even more extraordinary 
because the music I condnetis better than what 
I play myself.

### 109322: Interview with Mstislav Rostropovich

‘I regard my interpretation of a work as a 
kind of improvisation. I put myself in the 
composers place.’ 
» HM Andyet you do not have the same physical, 
sensual contact with an instrument. 
M. R.: That's true, but when I eonduet sym- 
phonies by Beethoven, Mahler or Shostakovich, 
I'min heaven. 
HB Do an ear for music and musical tastes become 
more refined over the years? 
M.R.: Yes. Musieal tastes develop, but gradually 
and impereeptibly. Treeently heard a recording 
of the Dvorak coneerto that I made as a young 
man. Today 1 don’t like it. 
HM How do you approach a new musical work? 
M. R.: First of all by reading through the seore 
without an instrument. I hear all the music in 
my head, the phrasing, the nuances, all the 
details. Of course, when I pick np my ecllo, 
ehanges may ocenr, but T always have a clear 
idea in my head of what I’m going to do. 
HM Improvisation has practically disappeared from 
the classical repertory. Do you miss creating your 
own music? 
M. R.: Don’t forget that interpretation to some 
extent involy es improvisation, 
HB And yet when Chopin or Liszt sat down at the 
piano they created impromptu music at the drop of a 
hat. 
M.R.: But they were composers of genius! In their 
day there were also pianists who were incapable 
of improvising even on two notes. I regard my 
interpretation of a work as a kind of improvisa- 
tion. It’s as though I myself were composing it. 
I put myself in the composer’ place. 
HM So we're talking about a re-creation. 
M. R.: Exactly. 
BM What qualities are needed to playwell? 
M. Rat First of all a tremendous love of music. 
This is the only thing that can overcome the pre- 
concert emotional stress, the nerves, the stage 
fright. 1{ you don’t love music, you feel naked on 
the stage and just want to run away. 
HB Despite your love of music, have you ever 
suffered from stage fright? 
M. Rt Yes, at a veeital given by my wife in New 
THE UNESCO urer W JULY-AUGUST 1907 
York. I sat down at the piano without having 
been able to practise beforehand. Twas terribly 
uncomfortable. Sitting there at the keyboard | 
thought: “There are lots of erities out there in 
the audienee, waiting to pounce like a pack of 
wolves. They’ d just love to ehew me up and spit 
me out.” I made mistakes right from the start 
and played the first two love songs terribly badly. 
Then I thought: “What the heek! I've already 
made some terrible mistakes, they can tear me to 
picees if they want to, so now I might as well 
play for my own pleasure.” Then | started to 
play really well, 
HB In any case, you don’t make music for the critics, 
many of whom aren't musicians anyway! You play for 
the love of it, because it responds to an inner need. 
M. R.: That was the problem; IT had been dis- 
tracted. If you think of something else instead of 
concentrating fully on the musie, you won’t play 
well. That's what I was driving at. T forgot the 
pleasnre I should have been feeling while I was 
playing and my performance was affected. I can 
only play well if I am totally possessed by my 
love of the music. 
HB At the concert yesterday evening, when you were 
playing Brahms’s Quartet for Piano and Strings opus 
25 with Isaac Stern, Eugene Istomin and Yuri 
Bashmet, I was struck by your concentration. While 
your partners often exchanged glances or signalled 
discreetly to each other, you were completely 
absorbed by your cello and your score, although you 
heard everything. 
M. R.: Yes, my ears were particularly sharp yes- 
terday. 
HB Ifelt that you were putting all your soul into the 
beauty of the sound and that your relationship with 
your instrument was one of love, 
M. Ri: Alt! Love, love, tra lala la! (Rostropovich 
starts singing). 
HB Afew years ago, you played Bach's suites for 
unaccompanied cello in the church of La Madeleine 
at Vézelay in France. How did you come to do that? 
M.R.: By ehance. I had always thought that il 
were to reeord Bach, it would have to be in a 
beautiful chureh. Not heeause it’s religious 
music: for me the important thing was to play 
‘I can only play well if I am totally possessed 
.. 'y by my love of the music.

### 109322: Interview with Mstislav Rostropovich

‘When the orchestra plays the last chord, 
I slowly go down to Romeo and Juliet and 
join their hands.” 
Baclin an empty room and in a place that would 
encourage concentration and spirituality. A lot 
goes on in an empty church, Subeonsciously, 1 
was looking for a church that would meet my 
criteria, and until then I hadn’t found one. Then 
I visited the restaurant of a noted chef, Mare 
Mencan, in Vézelay. My wife and I iad a feast. 
We were due 10 leave on the Monday morning, 
but Mare said to me: “You mustn’t leave the 
area until you've seen this church I want to show 
you,” I told him that I was in a hurry, that I 
didn’t have a minute to spare. He insisted that 1 
should see it that very day. When I entered the 
chnreh of La Madeleine § crossed myself from the 
sheer joy of discovering it. And 1 began prepar- 
ing to record there. 
BM Romanesque churches are magical. They are 
round, like Bach's music. 
M.R.: Yes, and what’s more, the columns in this 
church are rhythmical. 
BM You are going to close these Musical Encounters 
in Evian by playing Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet 
with the Ballet of Lithuania and the Orchestra of the 
Nations, which you will also conduct. What made you 
choose this work? 
M.R.: When 1 was a student at the Moscow Con- 
servatory, | attended all the performances of 
Romeo and Juliet at the Bolshoi. | knew how to 
play all the music on the piano, from beginning 
to end. It’s wonderful music, an absolutely fan- 
tastic ballet. I have dreamt of conducting it for 
years, But to do that I needed special choreog- 
raphy. I didn’t want the dancers dictating the 
tempo to me with their feet. I wanted there to be 
arcal give-and-take and L also wanted to set the 
rhythm. So Vladimir Wassiliev, who started at 
the Bolshoi, produced a new choreography spe- 
cially for me. 
It’s exciting becanse the scenography is 
highly inventive: the orchestra is on stage, notin 
the pit, and so the music itself is the heart of all 
the action. The orchestra is placed so that 1 can 
conduct it while facing the audience. Ta front 
of the orchestra is a stage on which all the street 
activities go on. Above the orchestra is a kind of 
bridge on which Juliet’s bedroom is placed, and 
on which all the inside scenes are set, It’s an 
excellent idea. 
In Wassiliev’s latest production it’s impossi- 
ble to restrain one’s tears, When Juliet is dying, 
she holds out her hands to Romeo, who is already 
dead, without being able to touch him, When the 
orchestra plays the last chord, I slowly go down 
to them and join their hands. Ts wonderful! 
Wonderful! When I conduct the scene with Friar 
Laurence, when the two young lovers go to the 
church, the music is in lour-four time. And so 1 
make the arm movement for 4/4 time, from lelt 
to right and from up to down, identical to the sign 
tl 
of the eross. Romeo and Juliet come to me as if 
I were a priest, and appear to be blessing them. ’ Pi 5 
Bl So you become Rostro-pope-vich! 
M.R.: The production is full of original ideas and 
the scores admicable. 
MB In spite of your cosmopolitan existence, do you 
have a special affection for Russian music? 
M.R.: Yes, of course. Above all for Shostakovich 
because he was my great friend. 1 play his music 
with intense feeling. 
BM Is the musical scene in Russia still as lively as 
ever? 
M.R.: Yes, very much so. There are many yonng 
composers. There are older ones too, who are 
still relatively unknown, whieli is a pity because 
they are great musicians. 
MB Do you intend to record their works? 
M.R.: Yes, I’ve been thinking about it for a long 
time. For example, there is a woman named Sofia 
Bubaidulina, who is composing a piece {or me. 
She lives in Germany at present and she is mak- 
ing a name for herself in the West. In Paris, Radio 
France devoted a major {festival to her. Galina 
Utsvolskaya, another woman composer, lives in 
Russia. She is immensely talented. She has a 
considerable vepotation, especially in the 
Netherlands. The Duteh are wild about her. 
BW You are a citizen of the world and travel without 
a passport. How wonderful it must be to do away 
with frontiers like that! But where do you live most 
of the time? 
M. R.: In planes. 
BW Apart from music and your family, what are your 
other passions? 
M. R.: I seek beauty everywhere and in every- 
thing. The beauty of nature, like Lake Geneva 
down there beneath us. Magnificent! The beanty 
of women, magnificent! The beauty of musie, 
magnificent! [

LETTERS TO 
DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY 
| am seventeen years old and have been a Courier 
subscriber for a year. | like the articles very 
much—especially since they often coincide with 
my own ideas. In a world full of cruelty and 
hypocrisy, your magazine shows us that all is not 
lost. 
| know that this century's most important 
themes are diversity and complexity. | feel great 
respect for all the world’s cultures, and | enjoy 
discovering their best features. In this respect | 
think | am very lucky since | live between two cul- 
tures: my parents were born in the Republic of 
Korea and | was born in Argentina. | have assim- 
ilated my parents’ culture and that of my coun- 
try. Your October 1996 issue (“Exiles”) helped 
me understand that there are cther pecple who 
live and feel as [ do. On this subject, as cn so many 
others, the Courier is a companion that is help- 
ing me to grow up.

NEW PRIORITIES FOR PEACE 
Your magazine contains much thought-provoking 
reading, and | was particularly interested by Fed- 
erico Mayor's article in the November 1995 issue 
(“Peace, a new beginning"). 
Peace, which once depended on two empires, 
seems to have become everyody’s business since 
the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union. 
In order to preserve it, we may need to define a 
new order of priorities and show new vigilance. In 
short, prevention and not cure should be the order 
of the day; we should cultivate the idea of peace 
within us. 
The idea of peace is on the agenda and is 
making its way in people's minds. So much the 
better. But what can be done to combat the indi- 
vidualism and egecentricity of Western societies? 
What can be done to encourage a new spirit of 
sharing and fulfil this promise of peace?

A CALL 
FOR DISARMAMENT 
We have read a mass of documents produced by 
Unesco and other United Nations bodies. These 
studies and reports are the outcome of enormous 
effort and put forward some magnificent ideas. 
After discussing them in depth, however, we 
started to have some doubts. All these fine words, 
spoken and written, have had no effect. The same 
problems are still with us, and new ones have 
even been added. 
We have reached the following conclusion: 
While diplomats work to maintain or restore 
peace, the arms industries are flourishing and 
delivering weapons to those who will one day 
THE EDITOR 
ignite conflicts and massacre populations. The 
danger is now ubiquitous because international 
gangsters can get their hands on highly sophist)- 
cated and destructive weapons. 
THERE ARE TOO MANY UNSCRUPULOUS, 
COWARDLY AND GREEDY COUNTRIES. TO SALVE 
THEIR CONSCIENCE, THEY ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES 
WITH CULTURAL AND HUMANITARIAN GOALS AND 
CREATE ORGANIZATIONS TO ACHIEVE THESE 
GOALS. 
Nevertheless we still believe in the ideals . 
defended by Unesco. In order to make a modest 
contribution to specific action to promote disar- 
mament and a thorough overhaul of our way of 
life, we have written a six-page document in which 
we set forth our ideas and proposals in the 
plainest possible terms. We offer it to anyone who 
may be interested.

NO PLACE FOR COLONIAL LANGUAGE 
The May 1997 issue of the Unesco Courier, (“Land- 
scape with figures, the dialogue between people 
and places”) is beautifully illustrated, and 1 espe- 
cially enjoyed France Bequette's article, “Gar- 
dens of the Far East”. But “Far East” in the title ? 
This reminds me of the old saw, “Far from where, 
and East of what?" Colonial language has no place 
in the atlas of the year 2000. | think that “East 
Asia” is the proper term,

READERS TO THE RESCUE 
The cover of the November 1996 issue (“The mar- 
ket place, past and present”) shows a painting 
entitled Market Scene in Mexico (1987). You 
Invited readers to try to decipher the signature 
on the painting. it seems to me that what is writ- 
ten in the lower right-hand corner is “Nicolas de 
Jess 87”. The name has a strong autochthonous 
flavour, like the subject of the painting, which | 
think is magnificent in its composition, its light 
and its movement, 
| have been a devoted reader of the Courier 
since 1976, and always find in it subjects for 
thought and discussion. For me and my friends 
and students, it 1s a source of information about 
ways of life all over the world.

Isla de la Juventud (Cuba) 
| believe that the name of the painter of Market 
Scene in Mexico is clearly “Nicolas de Jesis”.

gratulate you on the excellent quality of your mag- 
azine.
