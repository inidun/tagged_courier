COUNTRY HOME OF 
A ROMAN EMPEROR 
 
© Angelo Frontoni, Rome 
Recent excavations have revealed fabulously beautiful artistic treasures with which the Roman emperor 
Hadrian adorned the great villa and gardens he constructed near Tivoli, some 18 miles to the east of Rome. 
Here, where Hadrian planned to spend his last years, an army of artists, sculptors, architects and builders 
recreated in miniature many of the monuments and places which had impressed the emperor during his journey- 
ing through the provinces of his empire. The mighty wall 30 feet high, shown here, which was built to enclose 
the gardens, was decorated with pillars and porticos. At the far end are remains of the Hall of the Philosophers.

### 66097: The Ocean depths, terra incognita

THE OCEAN DEPTHS, 
TERRA INCOGNITA 
by Dr. Gerald Wendt 
To man, the seas are a challenge which in magnitude 
approaches that of space. He has at least been able to 
observe the moon, planets and stars directly with tele- 
scopes and has sent rockets curving out into space as far 
as and far past the moon. Yet the ocean depths, shrouded 
in darkness, have been obscured from his view. 
Man’s knowledge of the oceans is meagre indeed when 
compared to their importance to him. Yef he has learned 
enough to know the major features of the ocean floor— 
trenches 33,000 feet deep, flat-topped undersea mountains, 
2,000 mile long fracture zones and deepest plains as flat 
as a calm sea—features which are uniquely different from 
anything either on the surface of the moon or on the 
earth’s land surfaces. 
4 
He knows too that the more than 300 million cubic miles 
of waters which cover nearly three-quarters of the 
earth’s surface conceal a myriad of wonders, from a fan- 
tastic variety of living matter to detailed records of earth 
—and life—history which are hidden in the sediment of 
the ocean deeps. 
Oceanography, the science of the oceans which groups 
many sciences and encompasses the study of all aspects 
of the cceans, their boundaries and their contents, has 
made more rapid progress in recent years as it has come 
in for a greater—yet still inadequate—share of the re- 
sources with which man searches for greater under- 
Sanding of himself, his origins and the universe in which 
e lives

quarters, New York. The rift averages 20 miles in width and 7,500 feet 
in depth. It is bordered by mountain ridges that average 6,000 feet 
in height and about 75 miles in width. Largest task for oceanograph- 
HE demonstration that oceanography has passed from 
blind exploration and accidental discovery into 
a full-fledged science bent on a systematic investi- 
gation of the last great frontier of this planet, came with 
the first International Oceanographic Congress, held at 
United Nations Headquarters in New York, this year. 
The Congress drew over 1,100 scientists from some 
45 nations, included more than 500 scientific papers in 
its programme, and during its two-week session seven 
oceanographic research vessels, the Mikhail Lomonosov 
of the Soviet Union, the Calypso of France and five 
American ships, the Atlantis, Chain, Pathfinder, Maury 
and Gibbs, were anchored close by in New York harbour. 
The Congress was convened by the American Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Science, with the United 
Nations as host, and was co-sponsored by Unesco for its 
International Advisory Committee on Marine Sciences and 
by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) 
through its Special Committee on Oceanic Research. The 
President of the Congress was Dr. Roger Revelle, Director 
of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the Univer- 
sity of California, 'who is a member of the UNEsco 
committee and Chairman of the ICSU committee. 
At the Congress the marine sciences and oceanic 
research 'were publicly launched as a major world-wide 
international scientific endeavour, comparable with ato- 
mic energy, the International Geophysical Year and the 
exploration of space, but of direct interest to more nations 
and involving more individual sciences. Almost from the

ers is to map the geography of the entire sea bottom~70 per cent 
of the earth’s surface. The New York Congress marked the start of 
an all-out investigation of the earth’s last great unexplored frontier. 
start, the Congress was referred to as the “first” one on 
the ocean, in the assurance that others will follow and 
that this marks the beginning of a concerted attack on 
the problems and resources of the nearly three-fourths 
of the earth’s surface that is the common property of all 
mankind and therefore the proper province of the United 
Nations and its various Agencies. 
During the meeting, the Special Committee on Oceanic 
Research announced a major international research pro- 
ject for the years 1960 to 1564, somewhat on the model 
of the International Geophysical Year, for a thorough, 
co-ordinated study of the Indian Ocean by twelve research 
vessels that will be provided by Australia, France, India, 
Japan, South Africa, the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom 
and the United States and perhaps by the German Federal 
Republic and Norway. 
The Indian Ocean, reaching from Indonesia to South 
Africa, touches many lands whose present need of food 
‘will increase with growing populations and can probably 
best be met from the sea. Yet it is the least explored 
of all the oceans and its resources are unknown. It is of 
special scientific interest because twice each year the 
monsoons reverse its ocean currents and thus shift the 
locations of the up-swelling waters from below that are 
rich in the basic materials for the nutrition of fish. 
In addition, the ocean is thought to be crossed by a 
submerged mountain ridge that curves from below the 
tip of Africa to the Pacific, passing between Australia and 
Antarctica but branching to send a ridge northward

towards the Red Sea. Every oceanic science will benefit 
from this study, but the practical hope is that a solution 
will be found for the puzzling fluctuation in the popula- 
tions of food fish like mackerel and tuna. 
The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Nation- 
al Research Council told the Congress that they consi- 
dered completely feasible a project for boring a four or 
five inch hole all the way through the crust of the earth 
where is is thinnest at the sea bottom, about 18,000 feet 
below sea level, down to a depth of 31,000 feet where the 
lighter crustal rocks end and the earth’s “mantle” begins. 
The deepest oil well yet drilled goes down about 24,300 
feet and preliminary studies indicate that a much 
deeper hole can be drilled even from the deck of a ship. 
Two years will be required for the experimental drilling 
of more shallow holes and for the development of special 
equipment. Then a new deep-drilling vessel ‘will be built. 
and at least two more years will be needed to reach the 
dense hot rock of the mantle that comprises the main mass 
of the earth. This project may help to answer questions 
on the age of the earth's crust and the original forma- 
tion of the oceans. Adequate funds for it are, however, 
not yet assured. 
Radioactive ‘rulers’ measure 
the age of the ocean bottom 
third iraportant project was revealed at the Congress 
by Dr. Y. Miyake of Tokyo in a report for a working 
party of the Special Committee on Oceanic Research 
of ICSU with recommendations for a world-wide study of 
the radioactivity of the ocean waters in order to determine 
the effect of the submarine disposal of radio-waste pro- 
ducts from nuclear reactors and laboratories. The report 
recommended that the International Union of Geodesy 
and Geophysics develop standard methods for the radio- 
active analysis of sea water and prepare a manual for 
uniform and standard procedures by all nations. 
The report also asked for the establishment of a world 
wide network of testing stations on the shores of maritime 
countries and on weather ships and whaling ships at sea 
which would make a continuous record of the radio- 
activity and its changes at a large number of points on 
all the oceans. A further recommendation was that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna should 
make a study of the maximum permissible concentration 
of oceanic radioactivity. There is no notable contamina- 
tion of the ocean as yet but the increasing number of 
nuclear power plants make these preparations advisable, 
in the opinion of the committee. 
From the scientific point of view, two aspects of the 
Congress were of especial significance. One was the reve- 
lation to many scientific workers of the large amount of 
research in progress in other countries that had pre- 
viously been unknown to them even in their own {field 
of study. Another was a fresh realization of the value, 
as cross-fertilization, of ‘work in different fields. The 
Congress included geologists, paleontologists, hydrogra- 
phers, geophysicists and geochemists, meteorologists, 
nuclear physicists, physical chemists, biochemists, bota- 
nists, zoologists and many others. 
Discoveries or new methods in one field repeatedly 
proved to be of great value in others. For instance, the 
highly specialized methods of determining the age of the 
radioactive isotopes of carbon, hydrogen, beryllium, silicon 
and ionium have made it possible to develop a reliable 
time-scale for determining the age of ocean-bottom sedi- 
ments, fossils and organic materials, the sequence of che- 
mical and biological processes, and flow of ocean currents. 
Thus oceanography is not a science but the focus of 
many sciences. Indeed, there was informal discussion at 
the Congress of referring to it as oceanology instead of 
oceanography. The latter term refers primarily to 
charting and mapping, as in geography, and is two- 
dimensional while oceanic research today is in depth, 
both literally and metaphorically, and the third dimen- 
6 
Continents of Europe & America 
are found to be drifting apart 
sion—vertically—is as important as it is in the exploration 
of outer space. 
The programme of the Congress was arranged in five 
major divisions; the structure of the ocean basins and the 
history of the oceans; the geophysics and geochemistry 
of the deep sea, including the currents and sedimenta- 
tion; the relation of the sea to its boundaries on the 
bottom, at the land surface, and with the atmosphere; 
the populations of the sea, including plants, animals, 
plankton, deep-sea fishes, evolution, ethology and ecology; 
and the cycles of inorganic and organic substances in 
e sea. : 
Topics that aroused special interest at the Congress, in 
addition to those already mentioned, included the 
following: 
® Continents on the move. It is possible that there is an 
increasing separation of the American continent from 
the European and African, at the rate of about one yard 
per thousand years as a result of the continued bulging 
of the crust and a further uplift of the mid-Atlantic 
mountain ridge. 
® Where life began. It is probable that life did not ori- 
ginate in the sea itself but on the under-water clay sur- 
faces in estuaries and shallow bays where “chemical 
evolution” took place for hundreds of millions of years at 
a time when the atmosphere was poor in oxygen but rich 
in hydrocarbons and perhaps ammonia. Increasingly 
complex organic molecules were formed by contact in the 
concentrated layers absorbed on the clay until amino- 
acids resulted which then combined to give proteins 
which were able to duplicate their own molecules. After 
that, organization of the proteins into cells became possi- 
ble and biological evolution could begin. The oxygen 
in today's atmosphere would prevent such chemical evo- 
lution but the same process may well occur on the astro- 
nomical number of possible planets belonging to stars 
other than the sun. 
@® Older than fessils. The earliest fossils found anywhere 
show that evolution must already have been going on for 
long periods of time ‘without leaving a trace. The expla- 
nation of this is that the earliest animals were plant- 
eaters with soft bodies; it was the much later appearance 
of carnivorous animals that forced the protective develop- 
ment of shells and skeletons which form fossils. 
® Equator stays put. It has been discovered that the rela- 
tively rich life in the ocean near the equator, where the 
upward currents bring nutrients, has laid down a conti- 
nucus band of sediments around the earth which indicates 
that the equator has been where it is now for some 
500 million years. Consequently, the poles have not 
wandered about and some other explanation is needed 
for glacial periods. : 
® World map of fish foods. The value of a map of the 
distribution of plankton, the microscopic plants and ani- 
mals that are the basic food for all higher sea animals, 
in locating fishing grounds has been demonstrated. Such" 
a map has been prepared for the North Sea by the 
Scottish Oceanographic Laboratory and has permitted the 
transplantation of food fishes to better feeding grounds. 
The preparation of a world plankton map to increase the 
fish harvest was recommended since there are large areas 
in the sea that are virtually “deserts”. 
® Grunt of love. The study of the social habits of codfish 
has revealed a grunting noise made by the male during 
courtship which can be picked up by hydrophones and 
used to locate schools of cod. 
@® Strange forms of life. The evolution of queer and even 
fantastic varieties of fish in the deep sea is explained by 
the absolute and enduring uniformity of the environment 
which permits mutation to proceed for milions of years 
with no change in the weather, nutrients, or other condi- 
tions which might serve to eliminate forms that are 
unable to adapt. 
® Giant eels 100 ft. long? The discovery has been made 
in the tropics of giant eel larvae, six inches long instead 
of the usual fraction of an inch. This may mean that 
mature giant eels 100 feet long may actually exist and

account for the legend of “sea serpents”. A large number 
of species, including “living fossils”, may yet be found 
because the larger, swifter or more intelligent ones may 
escape present methods of bringing them to the surface. 
They may even be sensitive to the sound waves used by 
trawlers to locate schools of fish and thus evade capture. 
@® Ocean level rising. Sea level is now at least 300 feet 
below where it was before the first glacial age some 
400,000 years ago, perhaps because of the accumulation 
of ice on the Antarctic continent. But at the peak of the 
last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, the level of the sea 
was about 300 feet below its present mark. Then 
a sudden warming and rise in the ocean level occurred 
and is still going on. If all the ice in the Antarctic 
should melt by continued warming the level of the ocean 
would rise at least 180 feet more to drown most present 
coastal plains. This could happen within the next 
10,000 years. 
@® Blocd typing of fish. In whales, seals, salmon, herring 
and sardines different blood types can be detected that 
distinguish various ethnic groups from others of the same 
species. They can be tested with rabbit serum just as 
human beings are. This permits the identification of 
individual “populations”, or schools, from others and 
could be used to follow their migrations and perhaps to 
explain their mysterious disappearance from fishing 
grounds. 
® Fish chemistry. Sea plants and animals produce a 
wide variety of special chemical substances such as vita- 
SEA-BOTTOM WORLD 
Rocks of a sea-mountain photographed at 
a depth of 1,094 fathoms (well over a 
mile down) are found to be covered with 
many minute animals and creatures. 
Rocks shown here slope off to a yawning 
abyss. Typical underwater “eye” used by 
oceanographers to obtain records of life 
in the depths is shown in photo right, 
slung aboard U.S. research vessel Vema. 
  
Blood types in fish distinguish 
different groups of same species 
mins, antibiotics, growth stimulants and hormones which 
may themselves be valuable to man and which, with fur- 
ther study, could explain the occasional explosive growth 
of some varieties and also the catastrophic death of 
millions of tons of fish, apparently by disease, at some 
times and places. 
® The restless depths. Deep sea waters are not stagnant. 
They are in motion with currents that have a speed of 
about half a mile per hour in some cases and are accom- 
panied by turbulence. Objects dropped to the bottom 
(including radioactive waste) are certainly not dropped 
into a stagnant, unchanging resting place. Academician 
L.A. Zenkevitch of the Institute of Oceanoclogy of the 
U.SS.R. confirmed this picture of restless depths of the 
sea. His ten-year study of the hundreds of species of 
tiny sea animals showed a constant vertical mixing of 
ocean waters so that species that normally live at depths 
below four miles can be found at all levels, even up to 
the surface. Strong currents can he detected even in 
the very deep trenches near the Kuriles and Marianna 
island chains that sink a mile or two beneath the great 
plains of the sea bottom. 
Dr. Columbus O’D. Iselin of Harvard University, until 
recently Director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Insti- 
tution in Massachusetts, U.S.A., reviewed the large num- 
ber of unsolved problems that the Congress had revealed 
and predicted that, with the upsurge of oceanic research 
that the Congress had certainly stimulated, vast new food 
supplies would become available for the ever-growing 
population of the earth. The present “hunting” of fish 
will be replaced by “farming” when effective fences can 
be devised to retain them, when “weed” plants and ani- 
mals can be eliminated in favour of valuable varieties, 
and when the growth of fish, both in size and in numbers, 
can be stimulated by the effective fertilization of sea 
water, probably by bringing up nutrients from deep 
waters by control of the ocean currents. 
He also predicted control of weather and climate 
through an understanding and control of the ocean cur- 
rents. The economic, social and political problems raised 
by such developments will be a challenge to international 
law. The future of the oceans, he said, is a prime concern 
to the United Nations and its Agencies, properly sym- 
bolized by the fact that this first international oceano- 
graphic congress was also the first scientific meeting 
ever to be held in the headquarters of the United Nations.

### 66100: Danger: iceberg ahead

the world that they once were, although they still form 
a very real and difficult-to-overcome danger to safe sea 
voyages in the North Atlantic. A floating iceberg is a 
natural climatic hazard which man, with all his ingenuity and 
resourcefulness, cannot control or entirely avoid. Progress 
in the war against the iceberg threat to safety at sea has been 
made possible only by using many of the resources of modern 
science. 
I CEBERGS are no longer the menace to the shipping of 
Whilst it is true that the peril of earlier days when icebergs 
might inflict a sudden and terrible toll on ships of all kinds, 
epitomized by the ghastly Titanic disaster of 1912, is much 
reduced, these great seaborne mountains of polar ice are just 
as numerous and as threatening as ever. 
The vastly improved methods of marine radar and other 
techniques of iceberg detection, now fortunately carried out 
on an international basis, make the chances of collision very 
much smaller than they were even twenty years ago. But 
the price of this safety continues to be constant vigilance 
backed by up-to-date scientific skill. 
The North Atlantic and the sub-polar regions produce a 
regular crop of icebergs that eventually move southwards. 
They break off from the massive Greenland glaciers in large 
numbers, some as long as several blocks of buildings and half 
as high above the surface of the water. Some may break away 
with the action of slightly warmer water from the vast 
floating polar ice-cap, but most are really the tail-ends of 
glaciers that have slowly but inexorably worked their way 
down to the sea. 
Three years adrift, 
ranging [800 miles 
N reaching the water, the glacier ends disintegrate into 
many fragments, -each of which is a potential iceberg 
with a travelling range of several hundred miles. Every 
year some 7,500 sizable bergs break off in this fashion, of 
which roughly between 400 and 500 find their way south of 
latitude 48° N. (Newfoundland). These are nearly all plotted 
on their wayward courses, even though from the time of their 
initial “calving” to their appearance in the steamer lanes three - 
years may elapse. In fact, many of the bigger bergs plotted 
by the ice patrols are three-year-old specimens. 
There are approximately 100 tidewater glaciers along the 
west coast of Greenland, yet most of the annual iceberg crop 
emanates from only 20 concentrated together. Few survive 
further south than the Grand Banks, but those that do form 
the greatest danger, carried along fairly swiftly by the Labrador 
current. Whatever their origin, these fragments of Arctic ice 
cannot be melted, held back, diverted or in any way destroyed 
by man. : 
Many of the smaller specimens, camparative fragments 
perhaps under 20 yards in length, are rarely seen by man at 
all, for they ‘melt before they drift down into the shipping 
channels. But the bigger, true bergs contain such an 
enormous volume of hard-ice that they can survive -for up 
to three years before succumbing to the warmer currents into 
which they move all the time, covering distances as great as 
1,800 miles. The enormous annual crop of bergs is thus 
considerably reduced by about June of each year, but in a 
bad season, such as 1939, they may remain a menace to 
shipping as late as August.

BIRTH OF AN ICEBERG 
Coastguard cameraman flying up Sondrestrom Fjord, Green- 
land, finds a glacier inching its tortuous way through the moun- 
tains. Forced along by the pressure of the tremendous Green- 
land icecap, glaciers move as much as 50 feet a day. During 
the 1949 Iceberg Census Operation when this photo was taken, 
40,232 icebergs were counted. Below, ice air patrol catches 
Jacobshavn Glacier (Greenland) in the act of depositing a giant 
iceberg (arrow) into Baffin Bay fjord. This glacier Is five miles 
wide at its mouth and the iceberg which has broken off is judged 
to be a mile across at the “break-off” point. Some of the other 
bergs in the water are as large as several blocks of city buildings.

ICEBERG 
(Continued)     
1860, and was really a vast chunk of the polar ice-cap. It 
was 53 miles long in one direction of its marked L-shape, and 
30 miles along its other arm. Another one spotted in 1893 
was over 50 miles long. Such monsters are literally ice- 
islands and do not usually remain so large for long, breaking 
up swiftly into numerous small pieces. 
It is well-known that the visible portion of any iceberg is 
only a small fraction of its total bulk, most of which lies 
submerged, and various proportions for the amount of visible 
ice are often given. Only recently has any scientific 
experiment been made to ascertain the exact proportion of 
visible to hidden ice, and for that the credit must go to the 
Russian geomorphologist Andrei Kapitsa, working at Mirny, 
in Antarctica. 
Kapitsa had long been interested in the measuring of 
icebergs and their underwater displacement, for he was not 
entirely satisfied with the theoretical proportions generally 
Six-sevenths of the 'mountains 
of ice’ are hidden under water 
quoted. He was finally able to make a practical test in 1957, 
when an air pilot discovered a large triangular berg with a 
flat top instead of the usual rugged, fissure-covered surface. 
It looked like a vast truncated triangle, about three-quarters 
of a mile long and about 200 yards wide at its centre. 
Water-level ‘growlers’ 
most dangerous of all 
APITSA’s idea was to land on the surface of the berg by 
helicopter, and then make measurements by seismic 
soundings. With several assistants he was able to 
achieve this, after a narrow escape from a deep, snow-covered 
fissure, on top of which the aircraft almost came to rest. 
One member of the team, Boris Vtyurin, was lowered over 
the precipice edge of the berg, and with a measuring-tape 
established its height above the sea as 86 feet 3% inches. 
HOW BIG IS AN ICEBERG? The visible portion of any iceberg is only a small fraction (one seventh) of its total bulk, most of 
which lies submerged. Only recently have scientific experiments been made to confirm the exact proportion of visible to hidden ice. 
r The Russian scientist, An ei Kapitsa, working from the research station set up at Mirny, in Antarctica, during the International 
Geophysical Year (1957-1958), solved the problem conclusively by taking seismic soundings from the giant iceberg shown below.

Seven holes were then made in the surface of the ice ana 
filled with small charges of TNT, while other cavities were 
made to house the seismic receivers. All the party except 
Kapitsa then returned to the helicopter which took off before 
he detonated the charges. An oscillograph film record of the 
resultant explosion was made from the helicopter, and on it 
a clear curve showed the boundaries at which the waves were 
reflected from the bottom of the ice and also from the sea-bed. 
From these it was a simple matter to ascertain the exact 
measurements of the berg, which proved to be 636 feet 6 
inches from top to toe. Therefore, approximately six- 
sevenths of it were submerged, and from this experiment this 
proportion may be taken as a fair guide to the volume of 
invisible ice in any berg. - This strange construction, by the 
way, explains why no iceberg shows any signs of a sea roll, 
even in the worst gale, 
Most bergs continually split and break up, losing great 
fragments from their ends, cracking and thundering ominously

in the process. Sometimes parts + capsize and float 
independently at varying angles in the water. Frequently 
large areas of the sea may be filled with vast packs of small 
bergs, known as “brash.” These may subsequently be frozen 
together again into a large floe. 
As they weather away ordinary icebergs adopt the most 
fantastic shapes, ebbing and veering, travelling now swiftly, 
now slowly. At this stage, when about the size of a small 
house, they are known as “bergy bits,” and when further 
melted away so as to be almost awash, as “growlers”—the 
greatest menace of all, These still have the large underwater 
portion, usually in the form, at least in part, of a protruding 
arm of ice hidden beneath the waves and extending beyond the 
small area visible above the surface. This is known as the 
“foot,” and collisions with this invisible portion are the cause 
of most disasters when ships encounter icebergs.

ICEBERG. 
(Continued),       
Almost all bergs are objects of great beauty and of no 
little scientific interest. The largest may project 300 feet or 
more out of the water, and almost all rise to some kind of 
a peak. Their ice is often age-old, dense and amazingly hard, 
not translucent and. clear like manufactured ice, but full of 
minute air-bubbles which impart a shiny; intense whiteness, 
not unlike glistening porcelain enamel. The amount of this 
imprisoned air may reduce the total unit weight of ice, but 
hundreds of moderately-sized bergs contain at least 30 million 
tons of ice. 
Parry and Ross, the famous Arctic explorers, once calculat- 
ed that a long berg they encountered 23% miles by 150 feet 
high, contained some 1,500 million tons of ice. With some 
realization of this bulk and solidity, it is easy to see why even 
the largest steel ship stands little chance in a head-on collision. 
Furthermore, a berg’s large underwater portion renders it 
more liable to drift with the current than with the prevailing 
wind. Hence the uncanny and frightening way a great berg 
may bear down on an approaching ship even when the wind 
is against it. 
‘Titanic’ disaster leads 
to international action 
oR centuries North Atlantic look-outs have been trained 
to spot bergs under all conditions. At a look-out height 
of say 70 feet a man can see a berg on a clear day at 
a distance of 18 miles. A low-lying haze on a clear day 
reduces this to 8 or 9 miles. In light fog or drizzle 1 to 3 miles 
visibility is a good average. At night, a look-out can see a 
berg up to 3 miles away with a full moon, and only 400 yards 
away with no moon. In dense fog, of course, a ship relying 
upon visual spotting only may be within yards of a big berg 
without seeing it. 
Fortunately, much of the responsibility of iceberg spotting 
and plotting is now in the hands of the International Ice 
Patrol, which came into being in 1914 after the Titanic 
disaster as a result of universal demand. By various inter- 
national agreements since then the Patrol is administered for 
the ‘universal good by the United States Government and 
carried out by the U.S. Coast Guard (founded in 1790). Many 
marine nations contribute towards its upkeep on a “pay-as- 
you-benefit” basis, among them Canada, France, Italy, Greece, 
Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, as 
well as the United States and Great Britain. 
Fast cutters keep 
a vigilant patrol 
HE Coast Guard commences its ice observation and 
patrol service immediately the presence of bergs 
threatens shipping safety, usually in February, and 
covers an area roughly the size of Pennsylvania and in the 
general region of the Newfoundland Grand Banks. During 
much of the ice season, from April to July, this region is 
blanketed by dense fog caused by the confluence of the warm 
Gulf Stream and the cold Labrador current. Yet through it 
passes the world’s heaviest seaborne traffic. 
The Unesco Courier. — December 1959 
World's heaviest sea traffic 
crosses an ice-ridden zone 
- Aircraft, radar and loran (Long Range Radio Aid to 
Navigation) are now all used for the most efficient detection 
of these icebergs, but the two latter, excellent aids though 
they are, remain supplemental and do not replace the need 
for visual ice surveys. A vigilant and constant patrol by 
aeroplanes and fast cutters is essential, and these are based 
at Argentia, Newfoundland, where the International Ice Patrol 
Commander has his H.Q. The aerial surveys are mostly 
undertaken by Coast Guard-manned converted Douglas DC- 
4s (4-engined land planes). 
The specially-equipped cutters, like the USCGC Acushnet, 
keep up a constant surface patrol. Information about ice, 
growlers and bergs is collected by these patrol vessels, by the 
aircraft and from sightings reported by civil ships and planes 
operating in or crossing the danger area. All ships au- 
tomatically report every four hours their position, course, 
speed, visibility, weather conditions and the sea temperature 
to the IIP office, and so, from a mass of assorted data, a clear, 
hour-by-hour picture of iceberg movement is built up. 
Aerial reconnaissance augments poor surface visibility, and 
vice versa, thé Ice Patrol constructs isotherm charts to estimate 
the melting rates of all known bergs, and wind and sea current 
data is used to forecast probable drifts of dangerous ice. 
Summarized data is broadcast by the IIP twice daily to all 
shipping, which is then expected to plot its course well clear 
of known bergs, to allow for possible inaccuracies and shifts 
of wind or current. . Although 10 miles per day is the average 
speed of drift, bergs have been known to shift 30-40 miles per 
day for a week or more, so no chances can be taken. 
A 20-foot cube of ice 
sinks a fair-sized ship 
ADAR assists in locating large icebergs in poor visibility, 
but smaller bergy bits and growlers may escape radar 
detection if a heavy sea is running, and even a 20-foot 
cube of ice can sink a fair-sized ship. Actually, the growler 
menace today is not a great one, but is still exists. The use of 
loran now offers the best way of checking the exact location 
of all bergs and ice after they have been visually spotted, also 
their daily movements. With the development of loran, fog 
can no longer interfere with the work of the patrol vessels, as 
was formerly the case. 
In addition to its direct locating and reporting work, the Ice 
Patrol Service constantly studies the overall ice and sea current 
situation, the physical properties of sea ice, its drift, erosion 
and melting, temperature and atmospheric conditions in ice- 
ridden areas, the habits of seals and birds in relation to ice, 
and so on—all information designed to help the navigator and 
bring him to terms of familiarity with every possible danger 
from icebergs. 
New ideas and discoveries for combating the sea ice menace 
are constantly being employed. To safeguard shipping the 
International Ice Patrol couples its unrelenting vigilance with 
a desire to keep abreast of the latest scientific developments 
and to use the latest equipment after it has been checked and 
found suitable for this vital and humane work.

### 66105: The Blue scar

THEBLUE 
SCAR 
wo men were standing outside the local pub in a 
T small Yorkshire village. Inside could be heard the 
clinking of glasses and a calling of toasts in broad, 
Yorkshire dialect, interspersed with voices speaking some 
foreign tongue. The two men stood there smiling in an 
embarrassed manner at each other. Suddenly one of 
them—an elderly Yorkshireman of stocky appearance— 
rolled up his sleeve and pointed to a spattering of tiny 
blue scars on his forearm. A warm grin of comprehension 
slid over the younger man’s face as he promptly pushed up - 
his own sleeve and displayed identical scars. A second 
later both hands had met in a hearty clasp. 
“Don’t matter if they can’t talk each other’s language,” 
grunted an old chap looking on. “Yon blue scar—that’s 
coal dust—the miner’s mark the world over,” By this time 
the younger of the two had taken a small badge off his 
coat and was pinning it to the coat lapel of the 
Yorkshireman. He was a member of a group of Polish 
miners paying a visit to British mines and mining 
establishments at the invitation of the National Union of 
Mineworkers (NUM), and the tiny badge—a copper pin of 
two crossed hammers—was the emblem of the Polish 
miners’ union. 
Such exchanges of miners, railwaymen and other trade 
union groups between different countries have been going 
on for some time. “We had a French party down our pit 
last week-end,” said one of the Yorkshire miners, “and 
early last week a German group came round.” He might 
have added that this type of group exchange has also been 
organized by UNEsco since 1952, with the help of workers’ 
organizations, as part of its work for international 
understanding and co-operation. The Polish group was 
one of many which have taken part in study tours abroad 
with the aid of a Unesco grant. In this case the Polish 
miners were the guests of the NUM during the whole of 
their stay in Britain, the Unesco grant covering return 
travel from Warsaw to London. (See page 33 for news of 
UNESscO’s workers study tours in 1959.) 
By the time the fifteen members of the Polish group 
had arrived in Yorkshire their heads and their notebooks 
’ were full of the things 
they had seen and done. 
They had been taken on 
a swift whirl of London 
sights the day after 
their arrival, ending with 
a concert at London's 
newest concert hall, and 
followed the next day by 
an expedition to the 
National Coal Board's 
Research Establishment 
at Isleworth and a dis- 
cussion with the Presi- 
dent of the NUM, be- 
tore they all set off on a 
four day tour of Scot- 
land which included a 
visit to a colliery, to 
local industries and to 
miners’ welfare homes, 
with a days tour of 
Edinburgh thrown in. 
One of them, a Pole 
born and brought up in 
France, who had return- 
ed to Poland with his 
wife and children seven 
years before, remarked

Photos: Polish Information Office, Paris, taken in the mines of Upper Silesia 
seen in Yorkshire and the rather primitive mine they had 
visited in Lanarkshire. “But theytold us it was a very old 
mine, and will be closed in some years’ time.” 
They were all, of course, interested in the differences 
between British mines and their own, and between one 
British mine and another. “There’s so much to see and 
learn,” said Wladyslaw Pelczynski, the leader of the group, 
with a sigh, “a fortnight’s far too short.” “Don’t ask us 
our impressions,” added another. “We’ve had to make 
notes of so many things—on, people, and sights, and little 
habits, and the way ordinary things are done—they’re 
going to ask us all sorts of things when we get home, and 
we simply haven't had any time to sort them out.” 
“What did I find most exciting?” said Jozef Mikolajczyk. 
“On one of our journeys in Scotland we were driving by 
the Firth of Forth and we saw as we passed the new 
experimental drilling tower for undersea mining, sticking 
up out of the water. It’s the first of its kind, you know, 
and I had read about it in our papers back home, but 
never in my life had I expected to see it—and here I was, 
actually looking at it!” 
“Back home” to these men meant the Polish mining 
districts of Upper Silesia, Lower Silesia and Cracow. With 
the exception of Wladyslaw Peleczynski, formerly in the 
pits and now a trade union official, and another who was 
a mining engineer, all the others were working miners, 
straight from the pit face, and proud of their mining 
ancestry. ' 
Jozef Mikolajezyk had followed in the footsteps of his 
father and grandparents in the pits of Upper Silesia. 
Jozef Mikula, the Pole from France, who had been a miner 
in the Pas-de-Calais," had gone back to the Polish 
mines where his father and grandfather had worked 
before him. But his son, he said, was planning to be a

doctor. “Must break tradition sometimes, mustn't we?” 
he said with a smile. A young man spoke with pride of 
his father: “Fifty years in the pits—could retire any day 
he liked—with the maximum pension but no, says he's 
still good for a day's work.” 
Part of the tour laid on for them by the Yorkshire area 
of the NUM was a day’s trip to Blackpool, the famous 
holiday resort for the north of England. The day’s events 
included a presentation of gifts from the NUM, an English 
shirt for each man, a luncheon party at one of the big 
hotels, a visit to the Lytham Convalescent Home for 
Miners, run by the NUM—where the whole party sat down 
firmly to watch television—and an evening at the circus. 
The way to the convalescent home led down Blackpool's 
famous Golden Mile of esplanade, elaborately decorated 
for the summer season with Chinese ship and dragon 
motifs. The Polish interpreter, Henryk Ostrowski, who 
had come with the party from Poland, was kept busy 
translating and explaining as the charabance drove past 
the gypsy booths, waxworks, fun fairs and whelk stalls 
that lined the route, and the two enormous piers 
stretching out to sea. Suddenly his face lit up, and he 
pointed: “There’s the old windmill!” he cried delightedly— 
“Still there!” 
Interpreting from Yorkshire dialect 
or Henryk Ostrowski it was a return trip. England 
had been home to him in those years {from 1940 to 
1945 when so many Poles had no home. The “Virtuti 
Militari” medal which he wore proudly displayed on his 
breast had been awarded for the six German:planes shot 
down when a pilot in a Polish night fighter squadron in 
England during the war. “I was stationed here in Black- 
pool part of the time,” he said, “and in Bath and Exeter. 
There’s a family in Bath who ‘adopted’ me, just like a son, 
during the war. I'm hoping I shall be able to stay an 
extra week or so to go and see them again, and all the old 
friends from war days. I was in Yorkshire, too, in Church 
" Fenton,” he added. “That’s why Yorkshire dialect doesn’t 
baffle me.” 
His familiarity with the Yorkshire speech was more than 
put to the test the following morning, when the group 
were present at a meeting of the local NUM branch of 
Wombwell Main, the second oldest pit in Yorkshire. It

was held, according to common practice in England, in 
an upper room of the local pub, and the fifteen Poles, 
ranged along one side of the room, were welcomed in a 
short speech by the chairman before the business of the 
meeting began. It was the usual trade union meeting 
known all over England, and beyond—minutes, corres- 
pondence, executive report, branch business, local pit 
questions, national questions of wages and policy, vigorous 
debate from the floor, friendly interjections, hands raised 
for voting—for or against—all in the broadest Yorkshire, 
and the Polish miners shifted their chairs nearer and 
nearer to the interpreter, anxious to follow as closely as 
possible. 
‘English’ Poles meet Polish counterparts 
. O NE particularly intent on missing nothing was young 
Janusz Malecki, from the Ludwik pit at Zabrze, who 
was full of questions when the meeting ended and 
Yorkshire and Polish miners adjourned to the bar below 
for exchanges over glasses of beer. “Your trade union 
meetings are run quite differently from ours,” he said. 
“For instance, I noticed that a decision on various current 
demands was taken on a delegate basis. Now we would 
‘have had a popular meeting in the pit first to discuss it. 
One of the last items on the agenda in Yorkshire was 
- another meeting—but a meeting of a different kind. This 
time it was not with Scots or English miners, but with 
former countrymen of their own, some of the Poles who 
had stayed on in England after the war and were now 
working in English mines. A fair number of them still 
lived in the hostel—a disused army camp—not far from 
Barnsley where the meeting took place; but most of them 
were settled in homes of their own by now, many with 
English wives and children, and several of them came 
from six or seven miles away to meet their compatriots. 
The group had brought with them a fine vellum-bound 
edition of the famous Polish classic “Pan Tadeusz" by 
Adam Mickiewicz which was presented to the Polish 
miners in Barnsley as a gift from the Polish miners’ 
union; in no time at all small groups were scattered all 
over the big living room, exchanging information and 
asking question—with the interpreter this time taking a 
well-earned rest from his duties. The “English” Poles 
were eager to know about conditions and life in Poland 
to-day, and quick to answer similar questions about Eng- 
land asked in turn by members of the 
visiting party. 
Two men suddenly smiled with 
joyful. recognition at each other. 
“He's from my village”, cried the 
“English” Pole, a burly laughing 
fellow. “No, we never met, but you 
know how it is in a small place, we've 
passed each other in the streets a 
thousand times when we were boys, 
we both knew each other's face. He's 
been telling me all the news—the sort 
of things one wants to know-—what 
happened to old Teresa, and that the 
shop at the corner has changed hands 
—you know.” : 
As the talk slackened, someone 
began to sing—a mournful, haunting 
melody. Another voice joined him, 
then another, and soon the whole 
room was singing together. “It’s the 
‘Song of the Mountain Dweller,” 
explained one of them, “one of the 
best known and best loved songs of 
the mining district.” 
The sound of the motor coach 
starting up outside brought the sing- 
ing to an end, It was time to go. 
There were hearty handshakes, last 
minute messages called aloud, and 
the coach drove away, rounded the 
corner, and disappeared—the begin- 
ning of the road back to Barnsley, to 
London, to Poland—a coachload of 
miners going home to tell their pit 
mates of things seen and heard, of 
new ideas and experiences, and of the 
friends and fellow miners they had 
found over the sea.

PARIS MODEL 
Photo left, shows part of a preparatory model 
which was used by the designers and cons- 
tructors of the Lilliput Paris which is to tour 
the world. A careful study of perspective 
was made so that visitors will get a truly

To obtain this effect, buildings have been 
given different scales according to their 
distance from viewers. Monuments in the 
front of the model, such as the Eiffel Tower, 
the Institut de France, and the Bastille Column 
(not seen here) are reduced to 1/100 of 
their true size. Those in the middle distance, 
are 1/250 life-size and the Church of the

Chamber of Commerce some $25,000 
to produce. So as to be able to repro- 
duce the most famous buildings on a 
sufficiently large scale, the designers 
have limited their work to the central 
Paris area—a triangle running north 
from the Eiffel Tower towards the 
Church of the Sacred Heart on the 
hilltop of Montmartre and from there 
southeast to the former site of the 
Bastille. 
The model, built under the direc- 
tion of designer René Poirot from 
plans by architect Jean Leblanc, will 
show both the daytime and night- 
time faces of Paris. Lighting has been 
installed so that the famous build- 
ings can be illuminated just as they 
are in reality. 
From the centre of the model ‘will 
sprout a steel column, some 12 feet 
high. On it will be mounted a large 
disk acting as the revolving stage of 
a theatre in miniature. The stage will 
be divided into 18 scenes depicting a 
day in the life of Paris. It begins by 
showing the bustling early morning 
activity of the Halles, the central 
food markets, takes the audience 
through the highlights of the Paris 
scene, and ends the following morn- 
ing with a ride on the last Metro 
train. One scene will show celebra- 
tions of the 4th of July. Four hun- 
dred spectators will be able to see 
each of these ten-minute shows. 
Sweden will be the first country to 
welcome Lilliput Paris in the city of 
Gothenburg. After several weeks in 
Sweden, Paris will go to London and 
frcm there it will leave on an exten- 
sive world tour lasting several years.

Replicas in miniature fill the workshop (above) 
as Lilliput Paris takes form. The Cathedral 
of Notre-Dame (centre) is just over 3 feet 
high. This building and others such as the 
Institut de France and the dome of the Inva- 
lides, where Napoleon is buried, have been 
given 1/100 their true size. “Model for 
the model” of Paris is placed on trestles to 
the right. Houses in photo on opposite page, 
looking like some Paris version of the Tower 
of Pisa, will form part of the Montmartre 
Hill. Their bases have thus been given an 
inclined angle. Left, a coat of paint for the 
Genius of Liberty (scale: |:100) surmounting 
the Bastille Column. Lilliput Paris is built of 
plywood, lime and poplar wood, the separate 
pieces being glued, nailed or fitted into place.

UNICEF GREETING CARDS 
ARE NOW AVAILABLE 
his year's Unicef Greeting Cards are now available. Since 1950 
when the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) first intro- 
duced its yearly greeting cards, millions of people have made 
use of this pleasant and easy way to remember their friends while 
helping sick and hungry children throughout the world. For each 
penny profit on the cards UNICEF can provide enough vaccine to 
protect one child against tuberculosis. Profits from a box of ten mean 
that 35 children will get a glass of milk every day for a week...; ten 
boxes will provide enough sulphone tablets to cure six leprosy victims. 
Many world-famous artists have contributed their paintings as designs 
for the cards, among them Dufy, Matisse and Miro. This year UNICEF 
has put on sale ten different cards, all in colour, two of which are repro- 
duced here. Above, Dong Kingman’s “Fountain of Peace”, surrounded 
by the flags of U.N. Security Council Members; below, “Children 
and Birds” designed by Joan Miro. A box of ten cards costs $1.25;

### 66110: Zamenhof, father of Esperanto

LAMENHOF 
Father of Esperanto 
by Francoise Niederhausen 
  
Universala Esperanto-Asocio .~ 
Lazarus Ludovic Zamenhof 
N the streets of the unhappy town of my birth, savage 
men with axes and iron bars fell like wild beasts upon 
peaceful citizens, whose only crime was that they 
spoke another language and held another creed than 
those savages.” 
The man who wrote these lines was named Lazarus 
Ludovic Zamenhof. You may not know his name, but 
you certainly know his life’s work, for Zamenhof was the 
creator of Esperanto, an international language of 
communication between peoples. 
He was born a hundred years ago on December 15, 1859, 
in Bialystok, a frontier city near the borders of Lithuania, 
Poland and Byelorussia, where communities speaking 
different languages and practising different religions lived . 
together, although not very happily. 
Young Zamenhof was deeply affected by the prejudices 
and the antagonisms stirring this minor tower of Babel. 
Local officials .were of the Orthodox faith and spoke 
Russian; the nobility were generally Roman Catholics and 
spoke Polish; the peasants talked to each other in Lithua- 
nian or Byelorussian, while the Jewish shopkeepers spoke

### 66110: Zamenhof, father of Esperanto

Yiddish and lived in a section apart. Hostile prejudices, 
diverse languages, customs and religions all pitted the 
inhabitants of Bialystok against each other. 
To a sensitive boy belonging to a group which could 
express itself only in a dead language or in an adopted 
one, these conflicts seemed very tragic. At a very early 
age, young Ludovic developed the idea that a common 
tongue would help to break down at least part of the 
barriers separating people from one another. 
This idea haunted him throughout his childhood and 
adolescence: first in Warsaw where his parents moved in 
1873 and where Ludovic attended high school, then in 
Moscow where he studied medicine, in Vienna where he 
took a course in opthalmology and in Warsaw again 'where 
he set up a practice as an oculist. 
Doktoro Esperanto 
or ‘he who hopes’ 
roM his schoolmaster father, he had inherited a gift 
for languages. He spoke three fluently: Russian, 
Polish and German, and could read three others 
freely: Latin, Hebrew and French (to say nothing of 
Yiddish). He had a more cursory and theoretical know- 
ledge of English, Italian and several other tongues. 
His knowledge of English and French convinced him 
that a language could get along without the complicated 
declensions and conjugations of the Slavonic tongues. 
A careful study of Russian and German convinced him 
that a wise choice of suffixes and prefixes could reduce 
the size of the vocabulary considerably, while French and 
German proved the usefulness of the definite article which 
the Slavonic languages do not have. 
His work led to the publication in 1887 of a textbook on 
the “Lingvo Internacia”—the international language— 
for which he used the pen-name, Doktoro Esperanto (“he 
who hopes”). The book, whose publication was financed 
by his future father-in-law as a ‘wedding present, 
explained the main characteristics of the “lingvo”: a 
vocabulary with its roots drawn mainly from the Romance 
and Germanic languages; detachable prefixes and suffixes 
added to these roots and serving for all grammatical 
distinctions; and a very simple grammar consisting of 
16 short rules. The language, moreover, was fully inde- 
pendent and had its owm individuality. 
In the following years, other textbooks were puklishzsd 
as well as a dictionary and translations into Esperanto. 
At the same time, the first supporters came on the scene: 
first in Poland, then in Germany, Bulgaria, Russia, etc. 
Soon, groups were forming everywhere. In 1894. an 
important event occurred—the support of Leon Tolstoy 
'who wrote in “Posrednik”: “After only two hours of study 
I was able, if not to write Esperanto, at any rate to read 
it freely.” He urged everyone to learn this language 
“because the sacrifice is so small and the eventual benefits 
so great that no one should refuse to try it.” 
A common ground for 
agreement among men 
HE movement was growing steadily. In Scandinavia, 
England, France and elsewhere scholars were becom- 
ing interested in the experiment. In 1905, the first 
Esperanto Congress “was held at Boulogne-sur-Mer in 
France. To attend it, Zamenhof and his wife travelled all 
the way from Warsaw in a third-class railway carriage. 
Zamenhof 'was awed and somewhat overwhelmed by his 
stay in Paris: he was given an official reception at the 
City Hall and decorated with the Legion of Honour, and 
he dined on the Eiffel Tower with a group of world 
famous scholars. 
But even greater satisfactions were awaiting him at 
Boulogne. Eight hundred men and ‘women from thirty 
The Unesco Courier, — December 
countries had assembled there and all of them, whether 
in their official statements or their private conversations, 
were speaking Esperanto. The “lingvo internacia” had 
become a reality—and no one was more surprised than 
Zamenhof himself. 
The Boulogne congress gave him the opportunity of 
stressing the moral and social importance of his work: 
Esperanto was not an end in itself, but a means of contri- 
buting to a better understanding between peoples. It was 
a step towards the unity of mankind. 
The following year, he developed this idea at the 
Esperanto congress in Geneva, stating his conviction that 
- the international language was a means of bringing men 
together by breaking down the barriers between them, 
He exalted the brotherhood of man which seemed to him 
the only creed acceptable to all peoples and to all faiths. 
Year after year, at Esperanto congresses, he explained his 
ideas on tolerance and human rights, 
This role of guide seemed so important to him that, in 
1912, he renounced all honours and turned the linguistic 
problems of Esperanto over to its Language Committee 
whose job it was to survey the evolution of the language 
and to give official approval to new 'words introduced 
into it. 
At the Congress of Races in London, in 1911, he pre- 
sented a report stressing that physical differences were 
less important than those of language and customs. “Dis- 
cord among men”, he said, ““will never cease until they 
grow accustomed to giving more importance to the word 
‘man’ than to the words ‘people’ and ‘race’.” In his mind, 
the peoples of the world were separated mainly by lan- 
guage and religious customs. To bring them together, 
he suggested a neutral language and a neutral ethical 
basis which would provide a common ground for agree- 
ment between all men of goodwill. } 
A ‘lingvo internacia’ 
with 80,000 words 
E meant to discuss this idea at the tenth Universal 
Esperanto Congress in Paris when war broke out in 
1914. To Zamenhof, this 'was a terrible blow, but he 
continued to fight for his ideals. Back in Warsaw in 1915 
he drafted a “Letter to Diplomats” in which he emphasiz- 
ed that the main duty of any future peace treaty would 
be to guarantee to all races and minorities equality and 
freedom in the countries in which they lived. This was 
his last public act: he died on April 14, 1917. 
Zamenhof had foreseen that Esperanto 'would evolve 
and grow like any other living language. From a voca- 
bulary of 904 roots which could be used to form about 
10,000 words (1887), it has grown to more than 80,000 words 
based upon some 7,800 root words. Zamenhof himself 
contributed greatly to enriching the language, not only 
by his poems, speeches and articles, but also through his 
translations into Esperanto of works by Gogol, Shakes- 
peare, Dickens, Moliére, Hans Andersen, Goethe, Schiller, 
Heine and Sholem Aleichem. His version of the Old Testa- 
ment ‘which he translated in full was published after his 
death in 1926. 
Two world ‘wars destroyed many Esperanto libraries and 
organizations in Europe, but they were unable to stomp 
out the language and the ideal which inspired Zamenhof. 
Today, there are several million Esperanto speakers in the 
world and its literature, both original or translated, 
amounts to more than 50,000 volumes. There are chairs 
or.courses in Esperanto in some thirty universities. The 
language is taught in schools in twenty-two countries, to 
say nothing of countless evening classes. Twenty radio 
stations broadcast programmes regularly in the language. 
“Esperanto,” Zamenhof once said, “knows neither weak 
nor strong nations, privileged nor inferior peoples... All 
of us equal on neutral ground, should consider ourselves 
members of the same human family.” To pay tribute to 
this great vision, Esperantists from all over the world 
met in Warsaw last August for their Universal Congress.

Letters to the Editor 
GREAT PURSUIT OF SCIENCE 
Sir, 
That there be shortcomings in THE 
Unesco COURIER is to be expected; they 
occur in all things. They can be cor- 
rected. Recent articles, for example, on 
Gandhi, Old Age and Mental Illness, 
were one-sided and very weak because 
they neglected some of the most pro- 
found and extensive research done In 
the fields of bio-physics, bio-chemistry, 
especially the cerebral cortex, and the 
experiences of social development. 
However, let no shortsighted criticism 
and snobbery deter the outstanding role 
of our CourlER. Particularly indispen- 
sable is the worldwide scientific know- 
ledge written in popular language. 
And at this time of the Darwin Cen- 
tennial, THE Unesco COURIER can hold 
its banner high as it carries on the great 
pursuit of scientific thought. Our family 
of six, our relatives and many friends 
consider this magazine a necessary aid 
to life in this era.

RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL 
Sir, 
It surprised me that Professor Gorsky 
(Is the Ocean in Danger? July/August 
1959 issue) did not make the least men- 
tion as to how his own country, the 
Soviet Union, disposes of its radioactive 
waste products.

STORY OF SCOUTING 
Sir, 
Would it be possible for you to devote 
a part or whole of one of the issues to 
the Boy Scout Movement? This organi- 
zation as you know appeals to youth the 
world over. I am sure your magazine 
will not miss a chance of showing the 
world how a boy scout helps in its 
work.

LANGAGE BARRIER TO AMITY 
Sir, 
Just recently I had the pleasure of 
learning about your publication, THE 
UNEsco Courier, and about the broad 
humanitarian programme which you are 
promoting. In a world which is so tra- 
gically split apart by suspicion and 
hatred and conflicting ‘interests, it is 
encouraging to know that a programme 
based on conciliation and co-operative 
endeavour is bring promoted. 
Along with my good friend, Mr. Har- 
din, of the International Language 
Review and with others who are active 
in the newly organized International 
Language Association, I am convinced 
that the language barrier is one of the 
most serious hazards to cultural co-op- 
eration throughout the world and it is 
my sincere hope that you will give some 
thought to this aspect of the problem. 
If we are to prevent a more deep- 
seated deterioration of the world pic-- 
ture, then we must seek the broadest sort 
of approach to the present crisis.

HOW TO WIN READERS 
Sir, 
I found THE UNEsco COURIER S50 
interesting that I showed it to other 
members of the Medical Physics Depart- 
ment at my university, expecting that it 
would interest one or two of them at 
least, The result was quite staggering, 
and I can now forward 12 names, includ- 
ing my own, to you as people who 
would like a year’s supply of the maga- 
zine, starting if possible with the next 
issue.

TRULY BRAVE NEW WORLD 
Sir, 
One of the lovely aspects of your 
magazine is the way it liberates one 
from a childishly egoistic and rather 
messy world, by showing its immensity, 
the tremendous amount that has to be 
done, that can be done, and that one 
can do. In other words it is not such a 
stinkingly pessimistic, aimless and 
crushing place, but an exquisitely, pre- 
cariously balanced one, in which vou 
feel needed and wanted, giving it a won- 
derful tinge of hope and meaning for 
one and all. 
I believe you should include in “The 
Unesco Newsroom” more notes on the 
needs of peoples in different parts of the 
world, such as: doctor needed in Tim- 
buctoo: school teacher in Oman; assis- 
tant required in...

BRIDGE OF CREATIVE WRITING 
Sir, 
As a regular reader of THE UNESCO 
Courier and as a writer I must voice 
my appreciation of the interesting arti- 
cles found within its pages. But I 
would also like to voice my dismay at. 
seeing no space provided for creative 
work such as short stories and poems. 
It seems to me that if the scope of 
your publication were expanded to 
"Janeiro, 
include creative writing, it would give 
the people of the world a wonderful 
opportunity for sensing their funda- 
mental kinship, despite difference in 
customs, colour or creed. Through 
reading writers as far apart as Rio de 
Moscow, Tokyo, Saigon, 
London, Sydney or Delhi, perhaps many 
of the popular concepts of the Westerner 
about the East could be more correctly 
aligned. The reverse would be true of 
your Eastern readers. 
L. Mark Bartholomeusz 
Radio Ceylon, Colombo 
Editor's note : Short stories and poetry are 
not published in THE TUNEsco COURIER. 
However, the possibility of publishing transla- 
tions from the Unesco Collection of Represen- 
tative Works is now being examined. 
PROBLEMS OF ALCOHOLISM 
Sir, 
On several occasions you have dedi- 
cated a number of THE UNEsco COURIER 
almost entirely to a special theme, e.g. 
“Are Women Inferior Beings”, “Science 
Versus Old Age”, “Mental Health”, 
“QOrient/Occident”, etc. Each time it is 
a pleasure to see how thoroughly you 
treat the subject. 
Would it not be possible in a future 
issue to throw some light on the problem 
of Alcoholism? This topical and extre- 
-mely important theme would easily 
form a varied number which would 
undoubtedly be received by your readers 
with great interest. 
As I am closely connected with 
problems of alcoholism here in Switzer- 
land, TI should be very glad to hear 
about conditions in other countries. 
" Hans-Peter Kadhli 
Richterswil, Switzerland 
YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE 
Sir, 
We have read with great satisfaction 
and growing interest THE UNESCO 
COURIER since we became subscribers in 
May 1958. Nevertheless we cannot 
find any explainable reason for the fact 
that in the Letters to the Editor column 
most people are divided over the same 
point: Are the articles of THE UNEsSco 
COURIER interesting or not? 
We sincerely believe that there are so 
many topics to be treated and so many 
likes to be pleased that your task would 
be never-ending. We must thank you 
for having afforded us the opportunity 
to know the world, its beauties and its 
inhabitants much better than before 
and the creative work of scientists 
directed to all the fields in which huma- 
nity has developed.

### 189526: How many possible hands in Bridge?

HOW MANY POSSIBLE HANDS IN BRIDGE? 
a3,644,134,400,000,000,000,000,000,000 
One of our readers, Mr. K. Geisen- 
berger of Tunis (Tunisia) writes: “Your 
February issue described the prodigious 
powers of a new electronic calculator, 
the ‘flying brain’. This prompts me to 
request that you ask the machine the 
following question: How many possible 
hands are there in the game of Bridge 
played with a 52-card deck? By 
‘hands’ 1 mean (1) the possible distri- 
bution of cards to the four players; 
(2) the possible distribution of 13 cards 
to one player.” 
THE UNEscOo COURIER has asked 
M. Jean Besse of Switzerland to answer 
this question. M. Besse is a noted 
mathematician working with UNESCO's 
International Computation Centre lo- 
cated in Rome. He is also a well- 
known bridge champion of international 
standing. Here is his answer: 
* 
HE amazing results achieved thus 
far by the great modern calcula- 
tors, and the staggering possibi- 
- lities that the machines promise for 
tomorrow have aroused the enthusiasm 
of not only the scientist. As a result 
of the many articles (more or less docu- 
- mented) which have appeared in the 
popular press, these new machines have 
captured the imagination of the general 
public as well. But this is one of the 
subjects on’ which some of the most 
fantastic and often erroneous notions are 
in circulation as far as the ordinary 
layman is concerned. 
The fantasies of science fiction, the 
exaggerated deluge of publicity, the 
highly suggestive but questionable term’ 
“Electronic  Brain”—all these have 
brewed a fog of confusion which has 
engendered the layman's notion of a = 
Robot, part demi-god, part superman. 
Though no less wonderful, the reality 
is closer to the human measure. 
Let us, as our reader suggests, ask an 
electronic calculating machine how many 
possible hands there are in Bridge. It 
will be stone deaf to the question. First, 
because the machine does not know 
what you are talking about. Second, 
since it has no intelligence of its own 
(and that is why the term “brain” is a 
misnomer) it is quite incapable of posing 
a problem, much less of studying one. 
To pose a problem and elaborate a 
method leading to a solution—these for 
the moment, remain the exclusive do- 
main of the human brain. 
On the other hand you can very well 
ask a mathematician how many possible 
“hands there are in Bridge. After a few 
moments’ thought, he will tell you that 
the problem is one of calculating the 
permutations of 52 objects (the cards) 
distributed in four groups (the “hands”) 
of ‘13 objects, the permutation of the 
by Jean Besse 
~ 
objects within each group being imma- 
terial. 
In mathematics, the notation 3! 
(known as factorial three) is the result 
of multiplying 1 % 2 x 3. Likewise 
4! = 1 Xx 2 X 3 X 4; and 5! = 
1 xX2X%X 3X 4X35, and so on. The 
mathematician will tell you that the per- 
mutations of 52 objects is equivalent to 
52! (that is, the product of multiplying 
1 X 2 X 3 up to 52). But we must 
also divide this number by the permu- 
tations within each of the four groups 
of 13 cards, that is 13!, since the per- 
mutations within each group are imma- 
terial. The number we are looking for 
is therefore: 
52 
N = 
13! x 13! x 13! x 13! 
The mathematician is now satisfied. 
He will add, perhaps (if he is in a good 
mood) that since 52! is of the order of 
10% and 13! of the order of 10" the 
number N is of the order of 10%, that is, 
it would be a number of about 25 digits. 
As the precise cdlculation of this .number . 
would be a tedious job, the mathemati- 
cian would not go to the trouble of 
doing it (mathematicians. do not like 
tedious jobs). 
At this point, and at this point only, 
one could turn to the Electronic Calcu- 
lator. There are a hundred tedious 
operations to be done. 
The machine is there just for that. 
But it is necessary to tell the machine: 
precisely what is expected of it. For 
this a detailed “programme” must be 
worked out and recorded (assimilated) 
by the machine. * After that you simply 
press a button and the result comes out 
a few seconds later. That is the mira- 
cle. There is nothing supernatural 
about it, but it is a sensational accom- 
plishment of technology. 
For the problem we are considering, 
I prepared a “programme” for the new 
Computer, Gamma Tabbour Bury, built 
in France (See THe UNESCO COURIER 
February 1959, p. 13), which took me . 
one hour to work out (1). The printed 
answer emerged about a second after the 
button had been pressed. The number 
of possible hands in Bridge: 
53,644 quadrillion 
Spelled out, this figure (precise only for 
the first nine digits) is written: 
53,644,734,400,000,000,000,000,000,000. 
As for the second question, “the possi- 
ble distribution of 13 cards to one 
player”, the calculation is simple and

WONDERLAND OF SOUVENIRS 
FOR A ROYAL ROMAN TOURIST 
Photo story by Angelo Frontoni. 
ome, the Eternal City, has 
R recently revealed to the world 
new splendours of its past at 
the magnificent villa of the emperor 
Hadrian near Tivoli. It is a sur- 
prising thing that the Roman histori- 
ans recorded and handed down to 
us only sparse information about this 
vast and splendid edifice, the villa 
Tiburtina built by Hadrian, for the 
excavations which led to its discovery 
have since shown this monument, 
with its majestic architecture, en- 
trancing site and striking works of 
art, to be one of the most beautiful 
of its kind in the world. 
The . Emperor Hadrian was by na- 
ture an artist and a great traveller 
(the record of his journeys through 
all parts of the empire forms the 
chief authority for the events of his 
life down to his final settlement in 
Rome). He built the villa near Tivoli 
as a place to spend his last years. 
Here, in a setting both peaceful and 
sumptuous, he could devote himself 
28 
to painting, music, poetry, literature 
and other pleasures of his choice. 
Thus on his return from his first 
journey through the eastern pro- 
vinces of the empire he ordered work 
to be started on the villa in 126 A.D. 
Ambitious, and sensitive to his 
surroundings, he planned the great 
villa and its gardens as a kind of 
epitome of the world he had visited, 
one which would ever recall for him 
the places and the buildings which 
had left their impression on his 
artistic imagination during many 
long journeys. These included the 
Academus near Athens, the Pryta- 
neum, 'where the highest officers of 
state met in Athens, the canal of the 
ancient port of Canopus on the Nile 
Delta, the famous vale of Tempe, set 
between the mountains of Olympus 
- and Ossa in Thessaly, and even the 
nether regions ‘which, poets declared 
they had observed, and then 
described in lyric ‘works. To these 
miniatures of celebrated places he 
© Reproduction prohibited 
added an imperial palace and its 
annexes, baths, a library, a theatre 
and a judgement hall. 
Today, as the remains of these 
buildings are brought to light, their 
size and diversity suggest that they 
once belonged to a city rather than 
a villa. The villa Tiburtina, or 
“Adriana” as it is also known, was 
built on a plain, protected to the 
north by a line of hills. It extends 
from the right of the ancient Tibur- 
tina Way as far as the slopes of 
mount Ripoli on ‘which stands the 
town of Tivoli, the remains of its 
buildings and monuments covering 
some two square miles. 
After the death of Hadrian the his- 
tory of his wonderful home seems to 
have become shrouded in mystery. 
Since 1480, however ‘when Pope 
Alexander VI ordered the first exca- 
vations, great efforts have been made 
to uncover the vestiges of the villa 
which was once the pride of the 
Roman Empire. The most recent

digging has uncovered a large area of 
the villa and in particular the Cano- 
pus, ‘whose remains, now replaced on 
their original site, give some idea of 
their former splendour. Water again 
flows in the canal and exact copies of 
statues, caryatids and columns have 
been made to evoke the sumptuous 
festivities and entertainments ‘which 
Hadrian and his successors provided 
for their guests. 
preserved inside the villa and will 
eventually be visible to the public in 
one of the museums of Rome. 
‘While visiting Egypt Hadrian had 
been greatly impressed by the sacred 
places of Canopus, a prosperous city 
and port to the east of Alexandria, to 
which it was linked by a canal fed 
from one of the branches of the Nile. 
This city took its name from Cano- 
pus, the pilot of Menelaus, ‘who on 
his return from Troy was said to 
have died and to have been cremated 
there. From all parts of Egypt the 
faithful came to the city to visit the 
temple of Serapis, to consult its ora- 
cle and to implore favours. 
The villa Tiburtina ‘with its statues, 
columns, canal and the ruins of what 
was once the perfect copy of a distant 
temple, offers an impression of the 
greatness and prestige of Rome and 
of its rulers who were able to per- 
petuate for their own time and for 
posterity the renown of the Eternal 
ity.

EPITOME OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. The Emperor Hadrian planned his great villa and 
its gardens near Tivoli, | 8 miles east of Rome, as a kind of epitome of the world he had visited during 
his many travels through the Roman Empire. Here he reconstructed in miniature the places and 
buildings which had most impressed him. One of these was the canal (opposite page) of the ancient 
port of Canopus (named for the pilot of Menelaus, King of Sparta) in the Nile Delta. At the far 
end of the canal is the Temple of Serapis. Above, among the graceful columns and arches at one 
end of the canal are a crocodile carved in green stone, a now headless Amazon, Mars, the god of 
war, and a warrior. Below, a view of the canal of Canopus as seen from the Temple of Serapis.

Statues, caryatids and columns along the Canopus Canal evoke the sumptuous entertain- 
ments given by the Emperor Hadrian. Hadrian erected many magnificent buildings in 
Italy, but Athens was actually the favourite site of his architectural labours, and his pre- 
occupation with- classical Hellenic art caused certain writers to name him the “Greek- 
ling”. Above left, caryatids, female figures used as columns: right, wounded Amazon and 
the helmeted figure of Mars. Below, a marine divinity reclining on a wolf which recalls 
the legend of Romulus (founder of Rome) and Remus, who were suckled by a wolf.

From the Unesco Newsroom... 
Tue 100,000TH VISITOR: Unesco 
House, a leading tourist attraction in Paris 
. within a year of its completion, recently 
received its 100,000th visitor, fourteen- 
year-old Michéle Menguy, who was 
welcomed by Unesco’s Director-General, 
Dr. Vittorino Veronese. Michele, who is 
vice-chairman of the Unesco Club of Bois- 
Colombes, near Paris, founded by the 
parent’s association of her school, saw 
Unesco House on one of the regular group 
tours conducted by four guides who 
together speak a total of eight languages. 
HW FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Passengers 
aboard some U.S. steamship lines 
celebrated U.N. Day this year by eating 
a “UN. Day Family Meal”. Menus 
were composed of different national 
dishes so that a typical meal offered on 
that day could have included an Indian 
Mulligatawny soup, Mexican rice, a 
French meat dish, Greek pastry and 
Turkish coffee. These international 
meals were part of the campaign being 
organized in the United States for wider 
observation of United Nations Day.

OBBEAUHEHHDLIE HALLUA 
U.N. STAMP HONOURS 
WORLD REFUGEE YEAR 
A new United Nations Stamp—the 
fourth commemorative stamp for 
1959—honouring World Refugee 
Year, is being issued on December 
10—Human Rights Day. The issue 
replaces Human Rights Day stamps 
which have been issued each year 
since 1952. World Refugee Year— 
June 1959 to June 1960—was des- 
ignated by the U.N. General As- 
sembly as a year of special effort 
on behalf of the ‘world’s refugees. It 
is hoped to resolve completely the 
problem of some groups of refugees 
and to improve the situation of 
others as a result of additional funds 
from governments and public contri- 
bution, additional immigration and 
other kinds of assistance. The stamp 
which depicts hands held protectively 
over a refugee, is the emblem adopt- 
ed by the U.N. for World Refugee 
Year. It is being issued in two col- 
ours, the 4-cent denomination in red 
with olive-gold lettering in the bor- 
der, and the 8-cent in blue with 
olive-gold lettering.

MORE TRAVEL ABROAD 
FOR EUROPE'S WORKERS 
Some 860 workers from 21 European countries are this year taking part in study 
tours abroad sponsored by Unesco. They include agricultural workers, miners, 
postal employees, workers in the transport and building trades, civil servants, shop 
assistants, masterbakers, co-operators and, for the first time, a group of theatre 
workers. 
The groups, usually numbering about 15 people, visit one country or more 
and are able to meet, both at work and in their homes, men and women who earn 
their living in the same way. 
For instance, last June women from Austrian co-operatives made a tour of Den- 
mark, Sweden and Germany and visited a cocoa and chocolate factory in Hamburg 
and various otber co-operative enterprises in Copenhagen and Stockholm. They 
were also shown something of the social services available to workers in these cities. 
One of the more unusual tours which took place early in June was that of 
members of workers’ amateur dramatic groups from Finland who visited Copen- 
hagen, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna where they were able to study the technical 
side of theatrical production such as lighting, scene shifting, etc. 
Finland is one of the countries which is taking an active part in the Workers’ 
Study Tour programme. Twelve masterbakers from Finnish co-operatives have 
been to Germany and Switzerland where they studied production methods, working 
conditions and legislation in their field. And Fiuland has been host to a group 
of women municipal workers from Norway, and to workers from Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary and Rumania. 
Sometimes an international organization plans a tour for a group of workers 
doing the same job from a number of different countries. For example, earlier 
this year 19 agricultural co-operative employees from Belgium, Finland, Italy, 
Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden went to the United Kingdom to study 
farms and farmer’s co-operatives on a tour organized by the International Fed- 
eration of Agricultural Producers. i. 
Under the Unesco scheme, the cost of travel from ore country to another 
is borne by Unesco and all expenses in the host countries are paid for by 
Workers’ organizations, employers or the workers themselves. This year, Unesco 
will have contributed $50,000 to the study tours, whilst the organizations and their 
members will have spent approximately $150,000. 
Countries which have sent or received parties of workers this year are Austria, 
Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of 
Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Ruinania, 
Sweden, Switzerland, Ukrainian S.S.R., United Kingdom, U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia. 
Since the Unesco European study tours started in 1952, 7,220 workers from 
European countries have benefited by them..   
the Asia Society Incorporated of New 
York, for use in U.S. secondary schools. 
In a handy sized folder entitled “Teachers’ 
South Asia Packet”, the Society offers 
photos, maps, pamphlets and reprints 
providing an objective and up-to-date 
introduction to these countries and a 
supplement to textbooks and other 
materials available to teachers. The Asia 
Society is a non-profit educational and 
cultural organization helping to bring the 
peoples of American and Asia closer 
together by mutual appreciation of each 
other’s culture and way of life. 
HW SOVIET MINERLESS MINE : 4 
machine which performs all the tasks nor- 
mally carried out by miners in the pit 
has been installed in the Dombass coal 
region of the Soviet Union. A man at 
the control panel guides the machine 
through all the operations; from the . 
extraction of coal to its removal on the 
conveyor belt which raises it to the 
surface. As the machine advances, 
pitprops are automatically moved along 
the gallery. The machine is said to 
extract as much coal in three hours as 
a normal team of miners working with 
ordinary equipment does in twelve. 
R IGHT TO INFORMATION: Every 
day some 293 million copies of daily 
newspapers, 335 million radio receivers and 
73 million television sets bring news and 
information to the world’s peoples, while 
over 140,000 cinemas provide them with 
entertainment. But these facilities are very 
unequally shared by countries and conti- 
nents. As a first step towards greater 
international action in helping some 
countries develop their information media, 
the United Nations has asked UNEsco to 
make a world-wide survey of the problems 
"involved. UNEsco will conduct the survey 
through a series of regional meetings, 
beginning with one in Bangkok in January 
to draw up a programme for South-East 
‘Asia. Later meetings will be held in Africa 
and Latin America. .
