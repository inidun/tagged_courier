BERLIN: BIRTH 
AND REBIRTH 
y European standards, Berlin is a relatively young 
city, with its first records dating from 1234. Located 
at the crossroads of a medieval trading route, the city 
| ; * rapidly prospered and became the residence of the 
Pr powerful Hohenzollern dynasty that reigned for over 
- ) 
  
500 years. The sprawling capital, which Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder referred to asthe “Berlin Republic” 
upon taking up office there on August 23, stretches 
: over 800 sq. km and islocated 80 km from the Polish 
Wath border. The move of the century took place over the 
1 ie } summer, with the transfer of parliament, ministries 
z and 12,000 employees from Bonn (involving no less 
than 120,000 pieces of furniture, 38,000 metres of files, 
carried for the most part by rail, with special road 
convoys for confidential defence files and art works). 
Powerful symbols of the past remain: the finance 
ministry will move into the building from which Luft- 
waffe chief Herman Goering commanded the air 
war, whilethe Ministry of Labour will be housed in the 
former headquarters of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph 
Goebbels.

Reclaiming its former status marks a rebirth for 
Berlin, a city at the heart of the German enlighten- 
ment in the 18th century when it was capital of the 
kingdom of Prussia, before being proclaimed capital 
of the German Empire in 1871. During the 1920s, 
Berlin was one of Europe’s foremost cultural and 
scientific centres, associated with such names as 
Bertolt Brecht, Walter Gropius and Albert Einstein. But 
the 1920s were also marked by rising unemployment 
and merciless inflation, facilitating Hitler's rise to 
power. In 1945, the devastated city wasdivided into 
four zones of occupation, then partitioned into East 
and West Berlin in 1949. The wall was builtin August 
1961. When the city celebrated its 750th anniver- 
sary in 1987 on separate sides, few could have pre- 
dicted that the country—and Berlin—would be reu- 
nified two years later. In 1991, the Bundestag chose 
Berlin as capital by a narrow 18-vote majority. The city 
isnow one of superlatives, with three opera houses, 
160 museums and an ultra-modern cinema complex 
that will be ready for the next Berlin Film Festivalin 
February 2000. The capital is placing hope in its 
new status to shore up its economy and become a 
major transportation hub, with Europe’s largest 
railway station under construction. [|

A visitor takes to the air during the annual big breakfast event outside the Olympic Stadium. 
  
  
red to a metropolis like London or Paris, 
Berlin was laid-back, quiet, almost sleepy 
like a country village. 
Bird’s eye view 
of a burgeoning city 
It was only by heading east in the city 
that you started to feel uneasy—the contrast 
couldn’t have been greater. After passing 
the rigorous border checks and changing 
the obligatory amount of currency, you step- 
ped through the Iron Curtain—yet suppo- 
sedly you were still in the same city. The 
people all seemed so similar, with closed 
expressions on their faces. The pubs were

usually empty and you had the impression, 
especially after 11 at night when the theatres 
closed,that the capital of the GDR had rol- 
led up its sidewalks—but as it turned out, 
this was only on the surface. 
So much for the past. It’s now been almost 
ten years since the Wall was pulled down.Ger- 
many is reunited and so is Berlin, which is 
now the country’s capital with the Bundestag 
(parliament) and government having moved 
from Bonn this summer. It’s been seven years 
since I moved to the Mitte District on the bor- 
der of Prenzlauer Berg in East Berlin. At first, 
curiosity drew me here, the wish to discover 
this “other” city inside my own. We were lucky 
enough to get hold of a wasteland whose 
owners had not been clearly identified. Young 
people transformed empty halls, factories and 
ballrooms into art associations,theatre work- 
shops and “in”pubs. As these new venues 
became more established, the arts scene shif- 
ted from West to East. Just a casual stroll will 
lead you to marvel at an array of converted 
buildings and spaces that I doubt you would 
find in any other city. 
Right in the centre, just about 500 metres 
north of the Reichstag, teenagers have car- 
ted sand up to the demolished Weltjugend 
(“World Youth”) stadium on Chaussestrasse 
and set up a “beach volleyball”pitch.Right

next to the pitch—remember this is bang slap 
in the city centre, surrounded by office blocks 
and shopping malls—there’s a huge golf trai- 
ning course for sports students and other 
amateurs. T hese initiatives aren’t motivated 
by profit but by the simple desire to play vol- 
leyball or golf right downtown. But has 
anyone on the city council considered that 
this area is going to be one of the most invest- 
ment-attractive construction sites in the city 
once the government, the Bundestag and 
their administrations have moved in? 
Potsdamer Platz, about 500 metres south 
of the Reichstag, tells a completely different 
story. Just after reunification, the Berlin 
Senate thoughtlessly sold it off to Daimler 
Benz and Sony. In the last few years, the 
area, which was the largest construction site 
in Europe, has turned into an artificial com- 
mercial district with new residential streets. 
There used to be an insular tranquillity in 
West Berlin, while a state-coerced calm pre- 
vailed over East Berlin. Today both have fal-

bird’s-eye view, from a good distance, of this 
city in full transformation. If you look 
towards the west across the city centre’s 
large park, the Tiergarten, little seems to 
have changed. Early into a summer’s eve, 
you can see curls of smoke rising from 
countless Berlin barbecues, most often

up for the absence of a garden. A midday

dings dating from the GDR era which are 
not protected as historical monuments — 
from hotels built in the 1960s to the Foreign 
Office—are being demolished to make way 
for new construction. The redistribution of 
former GDR properties, which usually hap- 
pens by selling off land and buildings to pri- 
vate mvestors, has provoked a veritable reno- 
vation hysteria. You can only guess at the 
facades of homes hidden behind the scaf- 
folding lining nearly every street in East Ber- 
lin. Where I live, houses are being renova- 
ted one after the other, the facades painted 
8 The Unesco Courier - October 1999 
in pastel hues, with balconies added, apart- 
ments built into the roofs—and steadily 
rising rents. 
Given all the buzz and activity of the 
construction, you look forward to an eve- 
ning’s refuge in one of the “alternative” 
enclaves I mentioned earlier. “Acud”, for ins- 
tance, has such a special feel. T he building, 
which used to house squatters, is set back 
from a busy street in the Mitte District, just 
around the corner from my place. Acud is a 
world of its own.Banners draping the several 
stories of the building announce a smorgas- 
bord of cultural events. In the attic, you can 
sit back in old car seats and discarded rows 
of cinema seats to enjoy films rarely scree- 
ned elsewhere. One floor down you will find 
a small gallery, beneath that a concert hall 
and an African restaurant. T he courtyard has 
been taken over by fringe theatre groups 
who’ve created a performance space with an 
improvised nature reminiscent of the “Globe 
Theatre”. Daily life unwinds in places like 
Acud, which reflects the events and the meta- 
morphosis of the New City. These are islands 
in a sprawling city which only ten years ago 
was an island itself. [|

### 117421: Four challenges for a new world

FOUR CHALLENGES 
FORA NEW WORLD 
  
Federico Mayor 
The issues and proposals 
outlined in this editorial are 
developed by Federico Mayor 
in his recently published book 
Un Monde Nouveau. 
Federico Mayor has served 
as Director-General of UNEsco 
for twelve years. His second 
mandate at the head of the 
Organization comes to an end 
in November 1999. 
The nomination of his 
successor is a key item on the 
agenda of UNesoo’s forthcoming 
General Conference 
(October 26-November 17). 
Each member state has a vote 
within this sovereign body 
of UNESCO. 
 
1. Un Monde nouveau by Federico 
Mayor, in collaboration with Jréme 
Bindé of Unesco’s Analysis and 
Forecasting Office (Editions Odile 
Jacob, Paris). The English version, 
“The World Ahead: our Future in the 
Making” is forthcoming. 
“We can’t predict the future, but we can prepare it,” chemistry Nobel laureate Ilya 
A Prigogine once observed. For the most part, the future will be what we make of it, even 
if by definition and through circumstance its fabric consists of uncertainty, change 
and unpredictable creation. 
Two major upheavals have profoundly changed our vision of the world. First, the scien- 
tific revolution has taken us from an age of certainty and dogmatism and plunged us in 
an ocean of uncertainty and doubt. We believed in the predictability of phenomena 
governed by the imperious certainties of science:now the paradigms of determinism are 
yielding to a concept of nature and history whose hallmark is uncertainty. Secondly, the 
third industrial revolution, based on the information age and the rapid introduction of new 
technology into all facets of human life, is changing the world into a global one. 
Paradoxically, this globalization, far from creating a homogeneous global society, 
whether desired or deplored, is subjecting societies to a logic of disintegration. It is a logic 
of selective pairings, of exclusive groupings, of separation, rifts and disaffiliation. The highly 
asymmetric economic success of a system which is based on the concept of liberty but has 
forgotten equality and solidarity is a virtual political failure: it is coupled with an ethical 
vacuum and with a complete lack of purpose. The power of globalization is devoid of mea- 
ning. 
In the face of these fractures and this vacuum, four challenges must be faced. The first 
is that of peace, which is the precondition for successfully tackling all the others. Since the 
end of the Cold War, a fourth category of countries has appeared on the international stage, 
in addition to the industrialized and developing countries and those in transition. It 
comprises countries at war or emerging from conflict in which the state has often foun- 
dered in genocide and intercommunal massacres. 
The second challenge: will the coming century witness the onset of a new kind of poverty 
whose victims will live side by side with unprecedented wealth? According to the United 
Nations Development Programme, in 1960 the 20 per cent of the world’s people who live 
in the richest countries had 30 times the income of the poorest 20 per cent—by 1995 they 
had 82 times as much income. 
Sustainable development and the wise management of the global environment pose 
the third great challenge. Everywhere humanity is draining the resources which could have 
fed tomorrow’s generation. We have to find our way towards another type of development, 
one that is more economic, more intelligent, more caring. Because humanity has acquired 
the technical capacity to commit collective suicide, it has to learn to assume the “mastery 
of mastery”,in the words of French philosopher Michel Serres. 
The fourth challenge is that of the “erratic boat”syndrome.As a result of globaliza- 
tion,many states appear to have mislaid their maps, compasses and direction-finding ins- 
truments,even the will to set a course. They are tossed about by the waves, as though his- 
tory had fallen into the hands of “anonymous masters” who can no longer be 
controlled—financial markets,raw materials markets, statistics of all kinds 
But awareness of these problems has sharpened and solutions exist:hope remains. If 
only we can find a way to give millions and millions of silent people a real opportunity to 
use their freedom of thought and of speech, we would see the decisions of the mighty bow 
to the only power that counts: that of the people. 
Globalization must never remain confined to only the networks, telecommunica- 
tions, computers, the media world or markets. It will have to be based on the consolida- 
tion of a public democratic space worldwide.It is only on this condition that we will suc- 
ceed in rendering globalization humane, making it a project with truly universal promise, 
and giving it a meaning. 
This is the course we must plot for the twenty-first century. u

### 117422: The Kakadu affair shakes the heritage world

THE KAKADU AFFAIR SHAKES 
THE HERITAGE WORLD 
  
+ Sophie Boukhari 
The opening of a mine in Australia’s Kakadu Park has revived international debate about the 
protection of the world heritage 
How far should world heritage be 
I protected and who should judge? 
Nearly 30 years after UNEsco adop- 
ted its 1972 Convention on protecting 
natural and cultural heritage sites “of 
outstanding universal value”, the ques- 
tion is still stirring passions. The much- 
publicized row over Kakadu, which was 
put on the World Heritage List in 1981, is 
the most recent example. 
Supporters and opponents of extrac- 
ting uranium from the Jabiluka mine, 
which is an enclave in the park but not 
officially part of it, have been fighting it 
out for the past few years. Battles between 
experts, flights of rhetoric, clashes bet- 
ween police and militants, press campai- 
gns, special meetings of UNESCO units 
and diplomatic horse-trading have all 
been part of this stormy episode of world 
heritage. 
Kakadu is in Australia’s Northern 
Territory and includes a wide range of 
wetland and woodland ecosystems. The 
area contains many rare species and 
numerous places where ancient rock dra- 
wings can be seen. Cultural traditions 
there go back more than 50,000 years, 
making it the continent’s oldest known 
human settlement. This long history 
makes its “cultural landscape” a unique 
showcase of the relationship between 
humans and their environment. 
Dreamtime 
The scenery, plants and animals of the 
region feature strongly in the religion and 
traditions of the 550 or so Aborigines who 
live in Kakadu.They keep a close spiritual 
link to their lands, of which they are “tra- 
ditional owners” under Australian law. 
They believe they were put there by “spi- 
rit beings” such as the rainbow serpent, 
which they say appeared at the time of the 
world’s creation to give the planet its 
shape and existence.

Once their work was done, the 
Aborigines say, these supernatural crea- 
tures—which still have influence over the 
inhabitants and the fertility of the land— 
spread out over the countryside, pausing 
to fight or to rest, and established a num- 
ber of sacred places: the so-called places 
and trails of “Dreamtime”. 
But the dream stops right there. 
Today, the Kakadu region is seen as the 
site of one of the world’s richest deposits 
of uranium. The park, the biggest in 
Australia and the size of Belgium, 
contains an explosive mix—the familiar 
tug-of-war between conservation and 
economic development, the tricky pro- 
blem of radioactive waste and the asser- 
tion of indigenous peoples’ rights. 
‘We are telling the truth. 
Non-Aborigine people often 
doubt the sincerity 
of our cultures. But this sacred 
site belongs to the Mirrars.’ 
Three mining enclaves (Ranger, 
Jabiluka and Koongarra) were mapped 
out in the early 1970s, before the park 
was created in 1979, Australian officials 
point out. The Ranger mine has been ope- 
rating since 1981. The Northern Land 
Council (NLC), which officially repre- 
sents the 16 local Aborigine tribes in the 
running of the park, gave the go-ahead in 
1982 for the Jabiluka mine. 
A year later, things changed. A new 
government was elected which curbed 
uranium production and put the Jabiluka 
project on hold. But “with the agreement 
of the NLC and consent of the Aboriginal 
traditional owners,” according to an April 
1999 Australian government report, the 
Jabiluka lease was transferred in August 
1991 to the firm Energy Resources of 
Australia (ERA), although the deposit 
was still not being mined. 
There was another U-turn in March 
1996, when the Liberal Party won natio- 
nal elections and said it favoured opening 
new uranium mines, including the one at 
Jabiluka.After environmental surveys, the 
government gave a green light to ERA, 
which started digging in early 1998. It 
reckons the project, which will create 
jobs, could earn up to $2.5 billion in 
export earnings and produce $140 mil- 
lion in royalties for the Aborigines. But 
the 27 members of the Mirrar tribe are 
dead against the project. 
A “dangerous” site 
The Mirrars are the traditional 
owners of the Jabiluka enclave. They say 
the mine is dangerous for them and they 
no longer feel bound by the agreement 
the NLC signed in 1982. Their new lea- 
der,Yvonne Margarula, has proved very 
tough. They say the Aborigine leaders, 
including her late father, were pushed 
into the agreement by the mining compa- 
nies at a time when Aborigine rights were 
still little enforced and their leaders unu- 
sed to “modern” negotiations. 
The Mirrars also consider the expe- 
rience of the Ranger mine inconclusive. 
Although the Aborigines have received 
royalties, “the social situation in the 
region has not improved since the 1980s,” 
according to a 1997 survey commissioned 
by several of the parties involved in run- 
ning Kakadu, including ERA. Unlike 
other Aborigine tribes who favour the 
mining, the Mirrars say it will turn their 
lives upside down and threaten their tra- 
ditional subsistence economy based on 
hunting and gathering. They also stress 
that the site of the mine is a very sacred 
spot, one of the “Dreaming” places that 
are “dangerous” because disturbing them 
will have terrible consequences. “We are 
telling the truth,” says Margarula. “Non- 
Aborigine people often doubt the sinceri-

belongs to the Mirrars.” 
The tribe teamed up with ecology 
activists to form the Jabiluka Blockade in 
1996 to halt the project, and militants 
have clashed with police at the site several 
times. Almost two-thirds of Australians 
say they are against opening the mine. An 
aggressive international campaign has 
been launched and has spread around the 
world. 
The dispute soon landed on the desk 
of UNEsc0’s World Heritage Committee, 
on which sit representatives of 21 coun- 
tries each elected for six years. They have 
been inundated by hundreds of letters 
denouncing the mine’s threat to the envi- 
ronment and the cultural rights of the 
Mirrars. The World Conser vation Union, 
one of the Committee’s three advisory 
bodies, confirms that the danger is real. 
The Committee decided to send 
experts to Kakadu in June 1998.The mis- 
sion reported that there were “severe 
ascertained and potential dangers to the 
cultural and natural values” of the park.It 
noted the scientific uncertainty about the 
impact of the mining on water supplies 
and aquatic wildlife and about the long- 
term effect of stored radioactive tailings. 
It was also concerned about the mine’s 
“visual impact” on the site and the dama- 
ge it might cause to the daily culture and 
religion of the Mirrars. 
The International Council of 
Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and 
the International Centre for the Study of

the Preservation and Restoration of 
Cultural Property (ICCROM)—two 
advisory bodies of the World Heritage 
Committee—emphasized the fragility of 
the intangible heritage of the Aborigines. 
“We respect Mecca and Jerusalem, so we 
should respect these holy places too,” says 
Henry Cleere of ICOMOS. “The pro- 
blem is that nobody has ever defined their 
exact area. That’s just known to a few 
sages. Theyre supposed to keep this 
secret but now they're ready to reveal it to 
defend themselves.” 
Cleere, along with the Mirrars and 
many experts, says the Jabiluka enclave 
cannot be dissociated from the park’s huge 
network of “Dreaming” trails and places 
even if legally it is not part of the heritage 
site. To disturb the enclave, they say, would 
threaten the whole sacred network. 
Cultural rights 
The mission criticized the fact that the 
building of the mine was presented to the 
World Heritage Committee as a “fait 
accompli” when the Committee should 
have been told about it before work 
began, according to the terms of the 1972 
Convention. It called on the Australian 
government to revise the 1982 and 1991 
agreements so as to protect the Mirrars’ 
cultural rights. 
In December 1998, the Committee, 
meeting in Kyoto (Japan), urged the 
Australian government to stop building 
the mine and scheduled a special session

### 117422: The Kakadu affair shakes the heritage world

PLANET 
for July 1999 to decide whether to classi- 
fy Kakadu as an endangered heritage site. 
The NGOs were very pleased and the 
Australian government launched a coun- 
ter-attack. 
The Kakadu dispute has many 
domestic political implications and has 
set off fierce arguments with the opposi- 
tion Labor Party and the Greens, who 
challenge the government’s environmen- 
tal policies and accuse it of jeopardizing 
the process of reconciliation with the 
Aborigines, which was stepped up in the 
early 1990s. 
The environment minister, Sen. 
Robert Hill, led a strong delegation to 
Paris to stress several points. First, that 
Australia had no lessons to learn from 
anyone.lt had been among the first coun- 
tries to sign the Convention in 1974 and 
had changed its laws accordingly. The 
mission said Australia had the biggest 
expanse of world heritage sites of all the 
signatory countries and that it spent $30 
million a year on maintaining them. 
Alcohol and Western food 
Hill emphasized that the mining 
enclaves were already there when the site 
was put on the World Heritage List and 
that Australia had said at the time it reser- 
ved the right to start operations at 
Jabiluka. The Ranger mine had not cau- 
sed any environmental damage, the 
Australian delegates said, pointing to 
their country’s long experience in mining 
and very strict regulation of it on ecologi- 
cal and health grounds. Citing a number 
of experts, they said environmental risk 
was small and the way the radioactive tai- 
lings were stored was very safe. The mine 
was also hidden by hills and hardly visible 
from the park. It could only really be seen 
from the air and only 10 per cent of visi- 
tors to Kakadu flew over the park. 
Recalling that the Aborigines had ini- 
tially agreed to mining at Jabiluka, the 
officials said the mine did not directly 
threaten the sacred sites, which were pro- 
tected under Australian law. They in effect 
accused the Mirrars of using their religion 
as an argument to derail the project. The 
April 1999 government report said it was 
not until 1997 that there was a call to 
extend Boyweg, one of the sacred sites, 
possibly to cover the whole mining valley. 
“These revisions upgraded the site from 
‘sacred’ to ‘sacred and dangerous’, it 
said, adding that the new call was “not 
consistent with anthropological records 
or previous statements.” 
The delegation also said the govern- 
ment was not responsible for the slow

social and economic development of the 
Aborigines and the breaking down of 
their culture. “We can’t stop them using 
royalties to buy alcohol and Western 
food,” one delegation member told the 
Committee. The Australians promised 
however to revise ERA’s mining plans and 
resume talks with the Mirrars to establish 
their cultural rights more clearly. 
Then, on July 12, 1999, Hill sprung a 
surprise: the Jabiluka mine would start 
operations in 2001 but just slowly, only 
reaching full capacity when the Ranger 
mine had virtually closed in about 10 
years’ time. The government would ear- 
mark $1.8 million to beef up the park’s 
infrastructure and would step up efforts 
to improve housing, water supply, educa- 
tion, health and the job situation for the 
Aborigines. 
“There will be an enquiry in coming 
months to assess the danger to the cultu- 
ral property of the Aborigines,” he said. 
“We intend to appoint a mediator bet- 
ween the traditional owners and ERA. 
We're going to take a break. We recognize 
the problems of mining in this environ- 
ment, even if the mine is not strictly part 
of the park.” 
The World Heritage Committee deci- 
ded not to classify Kakadu as an endan- 
gered heritage site. But the Committee 
said it was still “gravely concerned”by the 
mine’s impact on the living cultures of 
Kakadu and by the lack of dialogue and 
progress in jointly managing the Mirrar 
people’s cultural heritage. It said it had 
significant reservations concerning the 
“scientific uncertainties” relating to the 
project and asked the Australian govern- 
ment to present new reports before April 
15, 2000. 
The many NGO representatives who 
came to UNESCO headquarters at the 
same time as the delegation strongly pro- 
tested. The Wilderness Society called the 
Committee’s decision “a dramatic capitu- 
lation to intense pressure from the 
Australian government.” It and other 
NGOs said the decision damaged the 
Kakadu park has many prehistoric rock art sites portraying mythological heroes, animals 
and objects familiar to the Aborigines.

1972 Convention’s credibility and was the 
outcome of a “dirty tricks campaign” by 
Australia to win over the countries repre- 
sented on the Committee. 
The government had announced in 
early 1999 a $600,000 lobbying campaign 
to prevent Kakadu being classified as an 
endangered site. It also said in June 1999 
it would back the candidacy of Australia’s 
former foreign minister Gareth Evans to 
succeed Federico Mayor as Director- 
General of UNEsco. The Wilderness 
Society said it hoped such backing was 
not simply “a way of pressuring” the cur- 
rent chair of the World Heritage 
Committee, Japan’s Koichiro Matsuura, 
who is also a candidate to replace Mayor. 
Apart from its many political dimen- 
sions, the Kakadu affair has shown how 
vulnerable world heritage is. How far must 
preservation go, when exceptional land- 
 
‘Now we recognize cultures 
which aren't monuments 
but where the landscape

and Oceania. They have

of humanity.’ 
scapes and monuments are increasingly 
under threat, as evidenced by the lengthe- 
ning list of endangered sites, which now 
total 23? Can mining or other economic 
projects be blocked when they endanger 
sites but when the need for jobs and deve- 
lopment is more and more urgent? And 
who should decide the importance of a site 
and how it should be preserved? 
“In the beginning, world heritage was 
defined in the light of Western artistic cul- 
tural traditions,” says Cleere. “But that’s 
changed. Now we recognize cultures 
which aren’t monuments but where the 
landscape has a very great cultural value, 
especially in Africa and Oceania. They 
have to be protected in the name of huma- 
nity.” 
But what should be done when their 
importance is not fully appreciated, inclu- 
ding in their own country? How far can 
the international community go to pro- 
tect them? T he jury is still out. Under the 
1972 Convention,countries which ask for 
sites to be put on the World Heritage List 
must recognize them as “a world heritage 
for whose protection it is the duty of the 
international community to co-operate”. 
But they can also interpret it as meaning 
PLANET 
 
At the White House in April 1999, Hillary Clinton welcomes Yvonne Margarula, one of the 27 Mirrar 
“traditional owners” of the Jabiluka enclave who had recently received the Goldman Environmental Prize 
along with Jacqui Katona, (in background) for the campaign against the uranium mine. 
their sovereignty will be “totally respec- 
ted”. 
With Kakadu, the Australian govern- 
ment has stuck to a very narrow interpre- 
tation of the Convention regarding inter- 
national co-operation,as embodied by the 
Committee. It has refused to recognize 
the Committee’s right to list the site as 
endangered without its prior agreement. 
Sen. Hill has also challenged the way the 
Committee works by questioning the legi- 
timacy of its advisory bodies, saying “the 
role of so-called independent experts and 
advisers is up for scrutiny in the future.” 
Eco-imperialism 
He has thereby given comfort to those 
who oppose joint management of world 
heritage. Forty members of the U.S. 
Congress have backed Australia over 
Kakadu, denouncing UNESCO’s supposed 
“eco-imperialism”. 
In a petition to President Bill Clinton 
on July 1, 1999, they said any dispute over 
an Australian mine should be settled by 
Australians “working with their elected 
leaders, not at some obscure World 
Heritage Committee.” They urged Clinton 
to ensure that the Committee did not 
“meddle” in the Jabiluka issue. The pres- 
sure group also wants world heritage sites 
in the United States to be controlled by the 
U.S. Congress. It said this demand was “a 
response to the Committee’s meddling in a 
dispute regarding a proposed gold mine 
located on private property outside the 
boundary of Yellowstone National Park”. 
The U.S. government forced the abandon- 
ment of the mining project there in 1996, 
after Yellowstone was declared an endange- 
red world heritage site. 
These and many other examples show 
that joint management of world heritage 
is nevertheless gaining ground. The 
Jabiluka affair was not part of this trend, 
but it has illustrated the astonishing orga- 
nizational power of supporters of world 
governance. NGOs, politicians (the 
European Parliament voted against the 
mine in January 1999) and ordinary citi- 
zens all over the world were inspired to 
campaign to “save Kakadu”. 
“We’ve never seen anything like this,” 
says Sarah Titchen, who is in charge of 
the case at UNEsco’s World Heritage 
Centre.“Now everyone around the world 
involved in world heritage knows about 
Kakadu.” 
Meanwhile the saga continues. The 
Mirrars are now opposing, quite legally, 
the building of a 15-km road through their 
territory. The road would allow ERA to 
take uranium mined at Jabiluka to be trea- 
ted at the Ranger mining complex, which 
would be less environmentally harmful but 
most of all, much cheaper. ERA has even 
hinted it will leave the Kakadu region by 
2006 if the Mirrars do not give way. It 
shouldn’t count on the rainbow serpent to 
advise them to do so. u

### 117423: Questioning the ABCs of women's literacy

QUESTIONING 
THE ABCs OF WOMEN’S 
LITERACY 
  
+ Anna Robinson-Pant 
By sharing the day-to-day village life of Nepalese women who made the move to attend 
literacy classes, an inquisitive researcher takes a critical look at what is being taught, and why 
Asweslipped along the muddy paths, Laxmi 
took her sandals off and said she was such a 
green cucumber she should not be going to all 
this trouble —I blame my parents, she said. 1 
Laxmi was on her way to an adult literacy class, 
held at night in Arutar, her village in Western 
Nepal. Like almost all the local middle-aged 
women, she had not been allowed to attend 
school as a youngster—though her brothers 
had—but she now saw a chance to catch up 
on reading and writing. By calling herself 
“green cucumber”, she referred to the com- 
mon Nepalese saying, “Why eat green cucum- 
ber at the time of dying?’ Becoming literate— 
like eating cucumber in this area—is both a 
luxury and a challenge at this late stage of life. 
I had been chatting to Laxmi as a friend, but 
also as part of my research into the links bet- 
ween literacy and development. For eight 
months, I lived in Arutar to try to find out why 
women like Laxmi go to such trouble to learn 
to read and write, and what they feel they have 
gained from the classes. This period was very 
much a two-way learning process, since Laxmi 
and her friends were equally intrigued as to 
why aWestern woman with her four-year-old 
son should want to live in a village eight hours’ 
walk from aroad! 
Rejecting the functional approach 
In many developing countries,including 
Nepal, where only 14 per cent of adult 
women are literate, literacy is often heralded 
as the entry point for involving women in 
income-generating activities and improving 
their health practices. Planners and policy- 
makers in aid agencies repeatedly underline 
that better educated mothers have fewer,

healthier and better educated children, and 
are more “productive”. However, | had also 
begun to realize over the years that women 
attending and running literacy classes don’t 
always share these views. T he aid agencies 
intent on finding linkages between women’s 
literacy rates and development indicators 
such as child mortality, fertility and nutrition 
tended to use the words “education”and 
“literacy” interchangeably. On a micro level, 
they often evaluated literacy programmes 
through calculating the percentage of women 
who went on to join savings and credit groups 
or the number of families who built latrines. 
My own impression was that these women 
attending classes (as well as their teachers) 
were less convinced about the development 
outcomes associated with literacy and made 
more distinction between “literacy”’and “edu- 
cation”. Whereas the latter took place in 
schools and enabled their children to gain 
good jobs and status, the women regarded 
“the adult class” as a poor substitute. I heard 
them say that the certificate given at the end of 
the course was no use in getting a job—"it’s 
just for ourselves”.Observing classes, I was 
aware of this tension between what the women 
wanted and the programme’s contents. Often 
this resulted in many dropping out but it was 
also clear that some were directly challenging 
what the aid agencies had on offer. In parti- 
cular, they rejected the “functional literacy” 
approach to convey messages and skills 
directly relevant to development activities. To 
me, the picture was very different from the 
passive stereotype often presented of the poor 
third world woman grateful to learn to read 
information about improving her family life. 
These women already knew about family 
planning and nutrition and if they did not use 
this knowlege, it was because either they had 
no physical access to health facilities or they 
disagreed with the new ideas. They had not 
joined the literacy class to discuss health, fores-

try or credit facilities, but to learn to read and 
write—sometimes for practical purposes such 
as account keeping or writing letters, but often 
just to feel educated like their husbands and 
children. 
Ironic joking 
It was the desire to reflect these women’s 
perspectives that led me to conduct more 
in-depth research. I chose to focus on two 
contrasting programmes in differing areas 
of Nepal. The classes in Western Nepal 
(Arutar) were run by an international aid 
agency which used the literacy class as a way 
of forming women’s micro-credit groups. 
The programme near Kathmandu (in Lalit- 
pur district) was organized by a small local 
NGO which developed its own lesson sheets 
linking literacy skills to health awareness. 
In both courses, which were run by local 
staff, the lessons were designed to give 
health messages through stories about vil- 
lage women who did or did not follow 
recommended practices. Several of the older 
women challenged the messages and ironi- 
cally countered the images of ignorant vil- 
lage women portrayed in the stories: Nani 
[literacy trainer] was explaining that a certain 
type of worm was on “sag” (a kind of spinach) 
and that if one eats it raw, one gets infected. T he 
women laughed “W hat can you do if you're in 
thefields all day cutting paddy and you see some 
 
‘What can | do—eat or study? 
How can | cut paddy, dry it all 
day and then come to study? 
nice sag growing. No time to cook it— just eat 
it and get worm”. Then N ani talked about hook 
worms and said you catch this worm if you go to 
the toilet with no shoes on. The woman laughed 
and joked, “We don’t have to worry about that 
one—we don’t have any toilets to go to any- 
way! We just go in the stream.” T he group of 
older women cackled away and then the joker 
turned her attention to me: “W hat can I do— 
eat or study ? How can I cut paddy, dry it all 
day and then come to study? My arms are 
aching, I'm tired out.” 
As Nani was an older experienced faci- 
litator, she could handle the women’s sar- 
casm,sympathizing with those who were too 
tired to study. But the younger girls who ran 
classes found the discussion style daunting 
and resorted to chanting of alphabet letters 
instead. A further issue was around language: 
the course was written in Nepali, partly in 
response to the younger women who saw 
fluency in the latter as opening more doors 
to them than their local tongue, Newari. 
However the older women insisted that the

facilitators conduct the class in Newari,so 
in practice there was a mixture of both. 
Hierarchical relationships 
In Arutar, the literacy course was a direct 
entry point into women’s group activities 
around savings, credit and income genera- 
tion. The women were expected to use the 
literacy skills to keep accounts, minutes of 
meetings and write reports. Although the 
women recognized that the development 
agency presented a rare opportunity for secu- 
ring a loan, they disputed many of its ideas 
indirectly—even the assumed link between 
literacy and income generation. When I inter- 
viewed Sansara, the treasurer of the Arutar 
women’s group (also mother of seven),she 
explained that her role was to look after the 
record books: I asked her what was in them and 
she said she had no idea. Other people write in it 
and she just has to carry them to the meetings. 
H erdaughter said, you won't have to carry them 
up the hill for the big meeting of six women’s groups 
will you? They explained that each group had to 
appoint a leader and that person had to attend a 
meeting of all the local women’s groups.... San- 
sara wanted to send her daughter in her place as 
she could read and write, but this was not allo- 
wed. I later discovered that Sansara had a good 
mental record of all the loans taken by group 
members, repayment schedules and interest 
owed, but that these details were not written 
down. The group members preferred their 
traditional oral practices or to rely on youn- 
ger family members, but the agency was keen 
that they should adopt new practices of writ- 
ten account keeping and agenda setting, even 
if in reality these were less accurate. 
In both, the Arutar and Lalitpur classes, 
the women encouraged the teachers to spend 
time on chanting the texts in unison and 
copying out words, rather than the more crea- 
tive discussion approach in which they had 
been trained. Though the women disputed »

tated the kind of education they had seen in 
local schools. Alina, the Arutar facilitator, 
responded by treating the women (who were 
much older than she) as school children, even 
though she knew well the constraints women 
faced as they were her neighbours: 
Alina: Did you understand it? I said so 
much myself I don’t know if you understood. 
Tomorrow don’t bring any children. A nd study 
at home. 
All the women laugh—no time. 
Alina: If you can’t study, how can I teach? 
Go home and study in any free moment you 
have, here and there. 
So what did women gain from literacy 
classes? Although many women challenged 
the teaching methods, language of instruc- 
tion or course content, their very presence at 
the classes suggested that they still saw some- 
thing to be gained from literacy. As time went 
on, I realized that what they valued in the 
experience was less tangible than the skills of 
keeping written accounts or reading about 
worms. When I talked to Sansara, the 
women’s group treasurer, she was keen to 
show me the part of the records book where 
the women had signed their names. I noticed 
on another page that there were only thumb 
prints—these were the marks of their hus- 
bands who had attended in their place one 
day. The fact that a wife could sign in place of 
a thumb print, when her husband could not, 
indicated some important changes taking 
place.Surprisingly, most men did not see this 
as a threat to their authority, as they regarded 
writing as just one skill which one member of 
the family needed. For the women however, 
signing their name constituted a new identity 
as a “literate” woman. When I attended the 
annual parents’ meeting at Arutar school, I 
discovered that the few women who came did 
so partly to assert their identity in a public 
arena through signing the register. 
A private space 
An incident that I observed at the Arutar 
literacy class made me realize that some 
women were beginning to use literacy for their 
own purposes: I sat next to Misra and glanced 
at her book— she had written something about 
herself. S he covered it with her hand when she saw 
me looking. A lina [teacher] asked her what she 
had written— something that was in my mind, 
she answered. But still she refused to show it. 1 was 
intrigued to think that Misra—the husband 
who refused to let her come to the literacy class 
regularly—was now perhaps expressing her- 
self through writing. It seemed that writing 
(and reading) might provide a private space

for women to reflect on their experiences. Fur- 
ther proof of this are some of the articles and 
stories written by women published as a fol- 
low-up to the literacy course (see box). 
So whose agenda should determine the 
kind of programmes on offer?T he link being 
made between literacy and information on 
health, nutrition or income generating through 
the “functional” approach seemed to result 
primarily from the aid agencies’ need to pro- 
duce quantifiable results from literacy pro- 
grammes. My experiences in Nepal show that 
we, the “developers”, have not taken time to 
understand where women are starting from, 
and more importantly, where they want to go. 
They may already have knowledge about 
nutrition and skills in chicken-rearing and

they may not want to learn to write agendas 
for meetings or accounts. Is the desire to write 
about your feelings as a low-caste woman or to 
read religious books as justifiable as the more 
concrete development aims? If women want to 
imitate a style of education provided in tradi- 
tional village schools, should the aid agencies 
be supporting this? 
Gainsin self-confidence 
The illustrations from Nepalese classrooms 
demonstrate that if women are not getting the 
kind of literacy that they want, they either drop 
out or put pressure on class facilitators to focus 
on what they enjoy. Aid agencies need to 
respond to this challenge and give women 
more direct control over what they learn and 
how. This can be done by conducting initial 
research into women’s specific needs and inter- 
ests: not everyone wants to write about their 
lives, just as some women may prefer to learn 
how to write accounts. 
Literacy programmes can be based on 
women’s own interests and an understanding 
of the local context, rather than a universal ste- 
reotype of an “illiterate” woman.Education 
around issues such as family planning can 
begin from a more critical approach that 
encourages women to analyse their problems 
and find ways to address them. Literacy-focu- 
sed programmes are only beginning to draw 
on such participatory planning approaches in 
an attempt to provide support for women’s 
existing (rather than imagined or projected) 
literacy needs. T he development outcomes of 
such programmes might be more difficult to 
evaluate than the numbers of savings groups 
formed or scores on a health knowledge test. 
But the gains in women’s self-confidence and 
changes in social relationships should be long 
lasting and eventually improve their quality of 
life. [| 
A LOW-CASTE LIFE 
|! the following story from Sangalo, a collec- 
tion published by Save the Children (USA) for 
neo-literates, Sushila Uparkoti from Arutar 
explains her position as a low-caste woman. 
“Nepal’s thirty-six castes are like one com- 
mon flower garden.” Low castes are oppressed. 
Women are not allowed to go to places like 
water holes, inns, temples. Our fathers and 
mothers used to say that our caste was not to 
study. What's the point of studying? Can’t get a 
proper job, they used to say. When they wanted 
to write letters they had to go the upper castes. 
They had to work all morning for others in order 
to have one letter written. Seeing our own condi-   
tion, we feel very worried. Even at the adult class 
we had to sit apart from upper caste friends. But 
after studying, we realized that one of the rea- 
sons for being backward was our lack of educa- 
tion. Nowadays after studying in the adult class, 
we can say and write some of the things in our 
minds. Nowadays, mother and father are very 
pleased that we can read and write letters. They 
have started sending younger brothers and sis- 
ters to school. The number of low castes at 
school has increased. It seems for lack of educa- 
tion we were dominated and suppressed. u 
1. This saying is attributed to King Prithvi Narayan Shah, 
who unified Nepal in the 18th century.

Ids Crisis 
e industrialized world stands out as an excep- 
tion onthe global Aids map: it has managed to 
stabilize the rate of new infections and to shar- 
ply reduce the number of Aids deaths through new 
combinations of anti-HIV drugs. But everywhere else, 
the pandemics spreading, while the sick are trea- 
ted poorly if at all. This is notably the case in South 
and East Asia,and, most dramatically, sub-Saharan 
Africa where the epidemic rages out of control in 
several countries. Six million people were infected 
with HIV in 1998. Four million of them live in sub- 
Saharan Africa. Of the two and a half million people 
who died last year of Aids, two million were African 
(pp. 20-21). 
There is no vaccine to prevent the disease, and 
new combinations of drug therapies are too costly 
forthe South. The only available weapon is preven- 
tion, which is becoming ever more vital since about 
half of new HIV infections are in young people. Youth 
also tend to be more open than adultsto learning 
about safer sexual behaviour. 
But for preventive education to be effective, it 
must be a priority for everyone. “We've preferred to 
keep our eyes shut,” states Peter Piot, executive 
director of UNAIDS (pp. 18-19). Aids bears a heavy 
symbolic burden which helpsto explain why it isall 
too often treated asa taboo, especially in sub-Saha- 
ran Africa (pp. 22-24). Schools are only just begin- 
ning to focus on Aids education (pp. 30-21), which is 
further complicated by the stigma surrounding 
people living with the disease (pp. 35-36). 
Nonetheless, new approaches can bear fruit. The 
results are seen clearly in Southeast Asia (pp. 27-28), 
specifically in Thailand with the “100 per cent Condom 
Campaign” (p. 29),as well asin sub-Saharan Africa by 
way of films (p. 25), traditional healers 
(p- 26), Koranic schools (p. 33) and school teachers (p. 
32). South America also offers positive signs, as seen 
with a programme tailored for street children in Mexico 
(p. 34). Most importantly, stresses Piot, politicians no 
longer need to be convinced of the value and neces- 
sity of prevention.

Fighting Aids involves no less than changing our whole sexual culture. Peter Piot, Executive 
Director of UNAIDS, stresses the impact of preventive education on young people’s behaviour

Aids, the epidemic will 
become a soft nuclear 
bomb on human life.

former president of Zambia

1 8 The Unesco Courier - October 1999 
Around half of all new cases of HIV infection 
in the world involve young people between 
15 and 24. Why? 
Because that’s the age when you begin experi- 
menting with sex and change partners most 
often, which multiplies the risk of infection. Our 
studies in Kenya and Zambia show 15, even 23 
per cent of girls between 15 and 19 are HIV-posi- 
tive, compared with only three to four per cent of 
boys. Girls are more vulnerable for both biologi- 
cal reasons (the female genitals are more suscep- 
tible to infection than those of males and are par- 
ticularly vulnerable in the case of girls because 
they have not yet developed) as well as socio-cul- 
tural ones (whether they are won over by gifts or 
are the victims of force, they often have as part- 
ners adult men who because of their age are more 
likely to be HIV-positive than boys). 
The roots of the problem lie mainly in pover- 
ty and male chauvinism.Hence the importance of 
educating boys, who have to be taught that their 
worth doesn’t depend on the number of women 
they've seduced. We have to change the whole 
“sexual culture” as it were. But we have to be 
humble: we’re not going to change the world in 
the space of a few years. 
What’s the impact of preventive education on 
young people’s sexual behaviour? 
Youth are more receptive to prevention mes- 
sages and go on to adopt a more responsible atti- 
tude to sexuality than adults. In countries where 
there’s been a good response to prevention cam- 
paigns, we’ve seen a very marked drop in the rate 
of infection among the 15 to 24-year-olds. In the 
past eight years, the rate in Ugandan urban areas 
has fallen 40 per cent. In Zambia, it has dropped 
most markedly among schoolchildren. 
All this shows that education has an impor- 
tant role to play. Even though it’s true that many 
children in developing countries don’t go to 
school, the majority nevertheless pass through 
school. The opportunity must be seized to give 
them an education about Aids adapted to their 
age-group, right from the start of primary school. 
Some people still fear this will encourage children 
to have sexual relationships, but has anyone ever 
waited for lessons before starting their sexual life? 
It’s been statistically proven that preventive edu- 
cation makes people much more sexually respon- 
sible, namely by having sexual relationships later 
and using protection. 
Is Aids education given the attention it deserves in 
schools? 
Quite honestly, no, and not even in industria - 
lized countries. But extraordinary work is being 
done in some places. Brazil, for example, has a 
very good programme, which begins in primary 
schools and is backed by UNEsco. Zimbabwe too, 
where UNICEF is helping. Ugandan schools have 
introduced a new curriculum subject called 
“straight talk” in which pupils comment on daily 
newspaper sections written specifically for young 
people. The experiment is spreading in Kenya 
and a few other countries, but there’s a long way 
to go before it becomes general practice. 
I myself plan to strengthen my contacts with 
education officials, government ministries and 
teachers’ unions. Curricula which include the 
Aids question have been designed, tested and 
then not applied, like many good intentions. It’s 
no longer a question of developing teaching mate- 
rials, but of making use of them. 
Has anyone ever waited for 
lessons before starting their 
sexual life? It’s been statistically 
proven that preventive education 
makes people much more 
sexually responsible, namely by 
having sexual relationships later 
and using protection 
The United Nations General Assembly recently 
declared its goal to cut the rate of new infection 
among young people by a quarter in the countries 
hardest hit by the epidemic. Isn't this overly 
ambitious? 
Ambitious yes, but not unrealistic. Experience 
has shown it can be done if you get all sectors of 
society involved, starting with youth. UNAIDS 
works a lot with young people. We design aware- 
ness campaigns not just with young staff mem- 
bers in their early 20s but also after consulting 
teenagers whose ideas are always, I must say, 
quite refreshing. 
Since 1997, we’ve had an annual World Aids 
Campaign which targets young people. This year, 
the young Brazilian footballer Ronaldo has 
agreed to be involved. His words carry much 
more weight than mine among the youth of poor 
communities like those where he grew up. The 
popular Ugandan singer Philly Lutaaya also wor- 
ked with us before he died of Aids. If all the 
famous people who are HIV-positive admitted the

fact, as Lutaaya did,it would have a great impact. 
But they often keep quiet and I understand their 
fear of being rejected if they admit it. Aids is 
Janus-faced, and each side is just as terrifying as 
the other—one is the virus that kills and the other 
1s the society, which also kills. 
How can the stigma be fought? 
That’s my latest priority, in fact. To be prag- 
matic, we send volunteers who are open about 
having HIV to work in schools, hospitals, govern- 
ment ministries and other key places. This 
“public” approach to Aids has a much greater 
effect than any speech about respecting the indi- 
vidual. These volunteers are already working in 
Malawi, Zambia, Thailand, South Africa and 
Burundi and soon in Burkina Faso. I'd like to 
spread this strategy all over the world, but we 
don’t have the resources and it’s very hard to find 
people willing to take on such a mission. 
Why do you think Aids is still largely cloaked in 
silence 20 years after it appeared? 
The taboo surrounding Aids is a universal 
phenomenon. In most societies, talking about 
sexuality isn’t easy, even between two partners. 
Also, the impact of Aids on societies wasn’t felt as 
strongly 15 years ago as today. People also go into 
denial, which is an instinctive reaction to danger. 
Read The Plague by Albert Camus again.Another 
natural reaction is to say that it’s only something 
that happens to others. So for 20 years, we’ve pre- 
ferred to keep our eyes shut. Uganda, Senegal 
and Thailand are among the very few countries 
whose political leaders have reacted in a timely 
manner. It isn’t just a matter of poor countries 
either: U.S. President Ronald Reagan never pro- 
nounced the word “Aids” in public. 
But this year,the dialogue has started going in 
the other direction. Until now, I had to convince 
political leaders that the situation was serious in 
Getting youth through the Aids crisis 
their countries. Now it’s they who are taking the 
initiative. That’s a big step forward. 
How do you explain this turn-around? 
First,the impact of Aids on societies has beco- 
me so great it can’t be ignored any longer, despi- 
te the tremendous human capacity for denial. 
Then, without boasting, I have to say that the 
concerted action of the United Nations has hel- 
ped a lot. We're seizing every opportunity to 
spread the message about Aids by going all out to 
increase the number of sectors we work with— 
groups like boy scouts, women’s movements,pea- 
sants and others. I myself meet heads of state, 
mayors of big cities, ministers of finance, business 
leaders, army generals, musicians, footballers, 
bishops and imams—anyone who can influence 
members of a society. Religious leaders can be a 
big obstacle to a prevention campaign but I most- 
ly consider them to be allies. 
Are they really allies? 
I’ve noticed that those religious leaders in 
close contact with the population—the parish 
priest, the village imam—are the most receptive 
to prevention campaigns, including encouraging 
the use of condoms, which 1s the most delicate 
aspect. The further you go up the hierarchy, the 
harder dialogue becomes. Nevertheless, a Vatican 
envoy attended our March 1999 conference in 
Buenos Aires about involving priests in the fight 
against Aids. The message of the conference was 
clear: sex education at school is vital. Only a few 
years ago, this was inconceivable. u

Youth, in particular girls, and developing countries bear the brunt of Aids’ virulent spread 
2 0 The UNesco Courier - October 1999 
ome two decades after the virus started to 
Spe HIV/Aids is a growing crisis dispro- 
ortionately weighing on youth and on the 
developing world. About a third of the 33.4 million 
people world-wide living with HIV are aged 15-24, 
and half of all new HIV infections occur among this 
group. Five young people are infected every minute. 
Furthermore, studies in Africa show girls have four 
or more times the infection rate of boys. 
The developing world accounted for 95% ,and 
Sub-Saharan Africa alone for 70% of new HIV 
infections in 1998. Aids is now the biggest killer in 
Africa. Nine out of ten HIV infections among chil- 
dren under 15 last year occurred in Africa.Infant 
mortality in some African countries rose as much 
as 150% in 1998 alone. Life expectancy is falling 
by as much as 20 years as a result of Aids. The crisis 
1s also having an impact on economic development, 
with many African companies saying Aids illness 
and death costs sometimes total more than corpo- 
rate profits. Elsewhere too the crisis is gaining 
ground. In Asia, of the 7.2 million people living with 
Aids, a fifth were infected last year. 
What is perhaps most startling is that HIV is 
expected to gather force as a killer. In 1990 it 
accounted for 8.6% of adult deaths from infectious 
diseases in the developing world. By 2020, that figure 
is expected to rise to 37.1%. u 
Facts about Aids 
J aeauted immunodeficiency syndrome—is 
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), which weakens the body's immune system. 
Once they have an established HIV infection, indivi- 
duals are infected for life and will probably succumb to 
serious opportunistic infections caused by the weake- 
ning of their immune system. Treatment with antiretro- 
viral drugs can slow the progression of HIV infection 
but these expensive medications are not available to 
most people in the developing world, who often lack 
access even to drugs that combat opportunistic infec- 
tions. In individuals who do not get antiretroviral the- 
rapy, the time between infection with HIV and the 
development of the serious illnesses that define Aids is 
around eight years, and most patients do not survive 
much more than two years after their onset.

HIV is a slow-acting virus. The majority of infected indi- 
viduals look healthy and feel well for many years after 
infection; they may not even suspect they harbour the 
virus, though they can transmit it to others. Conservative 
UNAIDS estimates are that 90% of all HIV-infected people 
worldwide do not know they have the virus A laboratory 
blood or saliva test is the only certain way to determine 
whether an individual is HIV-positive. [|

In the eye of the global Aids epidemic, Africa has no choice but to 
organize a massive, multi-pronged prevention campaign which mobilizes 
the broadest range of players 
is one of the worst plagues of recent centuries. 
The region has only a tenth of the world’s 
population, but is home to two-thirds of the total 
number of people with HIV/Aids. Two-thirds of 
those infected in 1998 live in the region and the 
situation is “out of control” in some countries,accor- 
ding to UNAIDS. 
Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest region of the 
planet, a fact which deepens the crisis. In this 
context,prevention is the only way out and to date, 
it has been glaringly inadequate .H owever, the qua- 
lified success of preventive measures in some African 
countries demonstrates that actions can be as effec- 
tive in stemming the crisis there as anywhere else. 
The main problem lies in cultural attitudes to 
illness, pain and death. Africans tend to regard 
disease not as something physiological but as the 
result of social or religious factors, such as a curse, 
poisoning or divine punishment. 
More than any other disease, Aids is associa- 
ted with death and sex. With sperm and vaginal 
fluids. It is passed on by blood and a mother’s 
milk. All this gives it powerful symbolism while 
making it a veritable taboo leading people to go 
so far as to deny its existence. Out of derision, 
some young people in francophone countries say 
that Sida, the French acronym for the disease, 
stands for Syndrome Invented to Discourage 
Lovers (in French). They are not convinced by 
scientific explanations of the disease especially 
after the bogus reasons trumpeted at the begin- 
ning of the epidemic: namely that Africans were 
responsible for spreading the disease because they 
“had sex with green monkeys”. Africans responded 
in kind, claiming that “Aids comes from white 
people, especially white women who kiss their dogs 
and sleep in the same bed with them”. 
The main goal of preventive education is to 
fight such ignorance and fantasies. The second 
goal—to explain how to protect against it—runs 
T Aids epidemic raging in sub-Saharan Africa 
i 
up against a similar problem of perception: 
condoms are a “white people’s thing”. Moreover, 
they are so expensive that sometimes a person has 
to choose between buying something to eat or 
having safe sex. For an African earning about $50 
a month,paying nearly 20 cents for four condoms 
is out of the question. 
The effectiveness of preventive education has 
to take into account these cultural perceptions and 
misunderstandings and respect social structures. In 
Africa, even in cities, adolescents just cannot talk 
to their parents about sex. Such discussion is limited 
to people of their own age and sex.So Aids educa- 
tion must follow suit: women, men and teenagers 
each have to be approached in different ways. 
Adults have to drastically change acquired 
habits. Teenagers have to be persuaded to adopt safe 
sexual habits, a much easier task. Yet this is a long- 
term job operating on three levels—awareness,infor- 
mation and education. 
Despite meagre resources, African countries 
have made great efforts to raise awareness and 
spread information. Posters and radio are the favou- 
red methods. Performing arts presentations and 
advertising are also often used. Experience shows 
that condom sales increase in the ten days following 
an awareness campaign. But these campaigns must 
happen more frequently to be effective because repe- 
tition is the key. 
Reaching young people 
in hierarchical societies 
Educating young people is still the main chal- 
lenge because they are the chief victims of Aids. 
Around half of the newly-infected people worldwide 
are between the ages of 15 and 24. In 1998, 90 per 
cent of the world’s infected people under 15 lived in 
sub-Saharan Africa where there is a tendency to 
engage in sexual relations at a relatively young age. 
T hese relations are often forced, with 12 and 13- 
year-old girls often the victims of sexual abuse.

The world spends $1.5 
billion each year on 
Aids prevention. 
Paradoxically, only 
$200 million a year are 
spent in sub-Saharan 
Africa, which has the 
highest concentration 
of HIV carriers. African 
states provide 10 per 
cent of this amount. 
This is a mark of their 
poverty, but also a 
mark of their 
insufficient 
commitment to a 
prevention policy

Schools would seem to be the ideal place to 
reach youth and most countries have at last inclu- 
ded preventive education in the school curriculum 
(see pp. 30-31). But in sub-Saharan Africa,about 
two-thirds of all primary school-age children and 
80 per cent of secondary school-age children do not 
go to school.So while schools must be part of pre- 
vention, it will take some time before they have a 
real impact. In Africa, more than any other region, 
the only way to attack the epidemic is to mobilize 
all the major actors in society at every level—the 
government, civil society, local communities and 
Getting youth through the Aids crisis 
foreign aid sources. T he higher placed they are, the 
greater impact they will have given the fact that Afri- 
can societies are so hierarchical. 
At the top are those with political power. They 
bear considerable responsibility for the spread of 
the pandemic.T heir only excuse for inaction is that 
the continent is beset with terrible problems. In 
countries at war, Aids is hardly a priority. And when 
there’s no war,poverty is people’s main concern— 
not Aids. After all, the disease has never come up 
as an issue at election time. 
The self-criticism of the continent’s heavy- 
weight, South Africa, has had quite an impact. Pre- 
sident Thabo Mbeki publicly admitted when he 
launched the Partnership Against Aids project on 
October 9, 1998, that “for too long we have closed 
our eyes as a nation, hoping that it was not really 
true”, while “every day another 1,500 South Afri- 
cans were infected in South Africa.” He appealed to 
young people and to the population at large to use 
condoms. 
A campaign will obviously not work unless the 
battle against Aids is a top priority for governments 
and given ongoing attention. This has happened 
in Uganda which has been the most successful Afri- 
can country in terms of Aids prevention. The ini- 
tiative for the all-out battle came from President 
Yoweri Museweni, who understood the extent of 
the disease from the day he came to power in 1986: 
out of about 60 army officers sent for military trai- 
ning in Cuba, where Aids tests are compulsory, 20 
were HIV-positive. Without further ado, he ear- 
marked funds for a large-scale national prevention 
campaign. Uganda has since made considerable 
gains. For example, between 1989 and 1995, the 
proportion of teenage girls (between 15 and 19) 
who remained virgins increased from 26 per cent 
to 46 per cent. They had the courage to refuse sexual 
relations. 
In Senegal, prevention has also been boosted by »

top-level political decisions, with clear results. In 
1998, the government of Cote d'Ivoire earmarked 
$1.6 million for a prevention campaign and recently 
the president set up a nationwide fund,containing 
an equal sum for taking care of the ill.T his repre- 
sents a huge amount of money in Africa. 
Bilateral and multilateral aid agencies are more 
likely to help countries which make their own finan- 
cial commitments to prevention.Beyond that,inter- 
national organizations like UN AIDS, WHO and 
UNESCO can and must convince African leaders of 
the extent of the problem. In 1996, the countries of 
Africa as a whole, except for Botswana, Kenya, 
Malawi and Uganda, spent less than $1 million each 
on Aids prevention. 
Spiritual leaders and traditional chiefs, widely 
respected and obeyed across the continent, repre- 
sent another key set of actors. Since the epidemic 
started, religion has hindered rather than helped 
the fight against Aids. A devout Catholic will not 
use a condom if he is told it is a sin,any more than 
a Muslim will if the imam does not even deign to 
talk to him about Aids. 
The lessons learned from a conference on 
Aids held in Dakar (Senegal) in 1997 are revea- 
ling. About 300 participants from Africa, Europe 
and the Middle East, represented the two main 
religions of those regions—Islam and 
Christianity. Just getting people together to talk 
about such a delicate topic was an achievement. 
After some stormy discussions, everyone agreed 
that Aids was a disease and had to be viewed in 
strictly medical terms. If it did not remove all the 
obstacles to prevention campaigns, the conferen- 
ce at least managed to persuade participants to 
stop opposing the mere idea of them. Across the 
continent, religious leaders are now starting to 
join the fight against Aids—for example, Caritas 
2 4 The Unesco Courier - October 1999 
International, one of the world’s biggest networks 
of NGOs, as well as the group Christians and 
Aids and Uganda’s Islamic Medical Association 
(see p. 33) have become involved. 
With doctors powerless to cure or effectively 
treat the disease, people are turning to the sym- 
bolic authority of the ancestors, embodied by tra- 
ditional chiefs. They are directly concerned by 
preventive education because some customs run 
the risk of spreading Aids—such as marrying the 
sister of one’s late wife or the brother of one’s 
dead husband and taking part in certain ceremo- 
nies which involve washing the dead. There 1s an 
alternative to every custom, as long as the head of 
the family accepts it. If the traditional chiefs were 
to decide to do more to help prevention, they 
could speed up the process of changing certain 
practices. 
Risky customs 
Equally formidable are the traditional healers 
and practitioners, who have a leading part to play 
since most Africans consult them. Nigeria has 
700,000 such healers but only 20,000 doctors for 
120 million mhabitants. Involving the healers in the 
fight against Aids not only draws on their prestige 
but also lessens the harm they can do: namely by 
admitting the disease exists and claiming they can 
heal it. Various projects have targeted healers by pro- 
viding them with training and mstilling them with 
a greater sense of responsibility. For example, in 
1995-96 the Aids Foundation of South Africa was in 
contact with about half a million healers and 650 
associations, all of which admitted that even if they 
could sometimes treat the symptoms, they could 
not cure the disease. Before that, 75 per cent of 
them said the opposite. 
The Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers 
Association, with 50,000 members, has over the 
past decade run about 500 workshops which deal 
with all social groups (teenagers, polygamous 
families, healers, traditional chiefs) as well as 
members of parliament. The aim 1s to make 
people aware of the dangers involved in traditio- 
nal rites such as circumcision, female excision 
and cures involving incision. 
Preventive education m Africa remains the 
only way of combating Aids, but prevention must 
not exclude medical treatment.Africans cannot be 
told forever that “medicine 1s for others but 
condoms are for you”. There 1s no underestima- 
ting the importance of a French initiative in May 
1998, which was favourably received by the G8 
(Group of Eight Industrialized Nations), and led 
to the creation of the International Therapeutic 
Solidarity Fund. Supported by rich countries, the 
fund aims to make anti-Aids drug treatments 
more available mm developing countries. Better 
access to treatment will not only help save patients 
but reinforce prevention efforts. Experience has 
shown that infected people with no hope of treat- 
ment are more likely to have unprotected sex than 
those with medical support. u 
It’s an object of our 
times...

auxiliary of amorous 
encounters. A 
cumbersome 
companion of passing 
pleasures. Banal and 
necessary: the condom.

group, 7.17% are HIV-

has so far claimed a total 
of 250,000 lives.

(Burkina Faso) about the dangers of catching 
Aids, one of Konaté’s two wives asked him to 
wear a condom. The dismayed Konaté told his 
friends about the request and they made fun of him. 
His pride was so wounded that he became impotent 
and even his mistress couldn’t solve the problem. 
Eventually the village witch-doctor intervened 
and told Konaté his only hope was to say a prayer at 
the foot of the tree on which the “thing” (the 
condom) supposedly grew. So Konaté went off to 
look for the tree. 
The film Konaté’s Thing, which came out this 
year, tackles Aids prevention in a light-hearted way, 
by laughing at male sexual pride and odd customs. 
Fanta Regina Nacro, the film’s 36-year-old 
Burkinabé director,explains her approach: 
A fter she heard from a cousin in Ouagadougou 
Why did you use humour to handle such a 
distressing topic? 
Being alarmist about Aids wouldn’t have helped 
much. People run away from painful images. But 
we all like recalling funny episodes. 
As an African woman, I’m particularly concer- 
ned about Aids. I wanted to use the wonderful means 
of communication I had—film—to help prevent the 
disease. [ know how my people think and it wouldn’t 
have worked to say to them in a moving or peremp- 
tory way “Wear a condom!” T he whole weight of tra- 
dition would have come down on me. So I took ano- 
 
ther tack. Through laughter, you can fight prejudice 
more easily. 
You raise a number of questions yet you don’t deal 
directly with young people even though they have 
been hit the hardest by the epidemic. 
I'm the first to admit this. But try and tell that to the 
National Centre for Aids Prevention. I was told that 
it would be “dragging them down into debauchery.” 
T hey were so insistent that I gave up. The issue reeks 
of hypocrisy. Health officials, community organiza- 
tions,everyone involved in the fight against Aids,they 
all avoid talking about and to young people. Fortuna- 
tely children are present during awareness campaigns 
in the villages and no one chases them away. So they

learn how to use condoms, just as they can if they see 
my film. 
We don’t have the right to leave children in the 
dark about Aids. Right now, I'm trying to get the 
film more widely distributed so most young people 
in Burkina Faso can see it. It’s been shown on natio- 
nal television but not everyone’s got aT V set. A tra- 
velling cinema is in the works, along with public pre- 
sentations and discussions to be held in provincial 
towns and villages. 
How do you gauge your success? 
In African countries, where there aren’t any ven- 
ding machines for contraceptives,people—especially 
young people—don’t dare to go and buy them. We 
decided, as part of a promotion campaign, to either 
hand out a free box of contraceptives or the equiva- 
lent of one dollar. When a farm-worker was handed a 
box of condoms, he was visibly delighted. When he 
was given money, he was grateful but nothing more. 
With a dollar, he could buy five boxes but he wouldn't 
dare do so. 
Since the film has been shown in Burkina Faso, 
kids have been asking in the market simply for 
“Konaté’s thing” and that’s what they get. T his 
achievement is much more important to me than 
any prize the film has won.

when I decided to see the malango healers. M alango 
means ‘what is needed and is suitable.” came back 
feeling better. Since then, I have recovered my sight 
and gained weight.” While Sow is a “miraculous” 50 
years or so old,he knows that he is not completely 
cured of Aids. 
In Senegal’s Fatick region, 150 kilometres 
from the capital,Dakar,the Malango Association, 
founded in 1983, has 450 members who are tra- 
ditional healers (a fifth of them women) and work 
in 264 villages. Starting from the belief that natu- 
re has a cure for every ailment, they use mainly 
powders, potions and plant extracts. But invoking 
the spirits is also part of traditional therapy. In the 
animist view of the world,humans are considered 
a link in the cosmic chain who summon the lower 
orders (minerals, plants and animals) to join the 
higher ones (spirits, ancestors and gods). All of 
them must be called on in the hope of finding 
cures. 
Unlike many of their counterparts in other 
countries, the association’s healers don’t promise 
their patients they will be cured of Aids. They suc- 
cessfully treat some of the symptoms (diarrhoea, 
vomiting and leukaemia) and ease suffering. When 
the treatment is ineffective, they steer their patients 
towards health practitioners who work with them. 
So far they have treated more than 10,000 people 
from Africa (including Senegal), Europe and the 
United States.

The first stop 
on the road 
Three quarters of all Senegalese go to traditio- 
nal healers. “In some areas, there’s one doctor for 
every 100,000 people and one traditional healer 
for every 1,000,” says Dr. Erick Gbodoussou, head 
of the Malango Association’s experimental centre. 
Gbodoussou trained in Western medical schools 
but is convinced traditional healers can not only 
effectively fight some diseases, but can also play a 
useful role in prevention.“When I treat someone 
with Aids,I discourage them from having sex with 
their partners,” says one of the association’s healers, 
a man in his 70s. “I tell them they can infect their 
partners if they don’t do what I say.” 
In Dakar’s Tilene market, traditional healers 
have been interested in helping to raise awareness 
about the disease.“ Aids exists and we have to dis- 
cuss it with young people who are sexually acti- 
ve,” says Ibra Niokhobaye Diouf. Do the ill 
people dare talk about their sex lives? “Ten out of 
the average 15 patients I see each day raise the 
subject openly,” he says. “I use each occasion to 
make them understand they have to protect 
themselves from this disease that everyone talks 
about so much.” With more healers like Diouf, 
the message about Aids reaches the whole popu- 
lation by word of mouth. 
In the village of Sambé, in the Diourbel 
region,healers attended seminars on Aids in 1998 
organized by the NGOs Enda Tiers-Monde and 
‘In some areas, 
there’s one doctor 
for every 100,000 people 
and one traditional healer 
for every 1,000’ 
Ndef Leng (“act together”). The seminars featu- 
red information workshops, debates and docu- 
mentary films which convinced them of the pre- 
vention campaign’s worth. Unfortunately, there 
were only 35 healers present.“Healers aren’t very 
efficiently used in awareness campaigns, yet 
they're our first stop on the road,” says Dr. 
Moustapha Gueye, of Enda Tiers-Monde. In our 
talks, African traditional structures always have 
pride of place. It’s time to make use of them.” 
The international conference on traditional 
medicine and HIV/Aids, held in Dakar in March 
1999, confirmed the key role of the healers. The 
conference, organized by Prometra (a Senegalese 
NGO which promotes traditional medicine) and 
sponsored by a dozen international organizations, 
attracted about 200 healers and 250 doctors and 
scientists, as well as political decision-makers,jour- 
nalists and people living with HIV and Aids from 
about 30 countries around the globe. At the end of 
the discussions, the traditional healers were invited 
to take part in UNAIDS programmes and attend 
the next world conference on Aids, in Durban 
(South Africa) in July 2000. nu

Getting youth through the Aids crisis 


### 117429: Slowly getting bolder

Southeast Asia 
Slowly getting bolder 
+ Pawana Wienrawee and Carol Livingstone 
  
 
  
While the region increasingly taps the media’s potential to spread the message on 
Aids prevention, traditional taboos continue to hamper the educational programmes 
  
TV Asia is currently broadcasting an excel- 
M lent HIV-prevention campaign. Savvy and 
modern,MT V’s commercial efforts reach 
affluent youth in major cities. The music lovers who 
see MT V's HIV education spots have the means to 
afford condoms and protect themselves. T hese young 
people include many of the future leaders of Asia’s 
next generation. 
But the majority of youth in the Mekong region 
—young agricultural workers in rural areas, newly arri- 
ved factory workers in big cities, day labourers on 
construction sites and others—don’t have access to 
MT V’s message. Much of the HIV and Aids educa- 
tion aimed at youth takes place in schools, but it usually 
only begins after the sixth grade. A large number of 
young people have already left school by this age. In 
Cambodia, for instance, only 40 per cent of children 
continue their education after their sixth year. 
A Vietnamese poster. 
   
  
Throughout the region, traditions still act as a 
sizeable obstacle to effective HIV/Aids prevention pro- 
grammes. Sexual education is not considered a part 
of the natural process of growing up. Parents still greatly 
influence their children’s choice of marriage partners. 
In countries like Cambodia and M yanmar,arranged 
marriage is often practiced. Pre-marital sex for “good” 
women is considered scandalous. Couples often do 
not date, and thus, sexual negotiation doesn’t begin 
until well into the marital relationship, if ever. 
Scare tactics 
As in many countries, teachers and students in the 
region often have trouble discussing sexual issues in 
the classroom. Teacher trainers, who help teachers 
learn to discuss sex with their students, often find that 
these adults have never touched a condom before and 
are frequently embarrassed while giving the lessons. 
Most grew up in an environment in which sex was 
never discussed. Often, the task of conducting sessions 
on condom education is left up to NGOs. Partly 
because of the traditional difficulty of talking openly 
about sexual issues, many of the education pro- 
grammes have focused on scare tactics: if you have sex 
or inject drugs you will get Aids and die. Youth can 
often list what is considered appropriate and inap- 
propriate behaviour, but this knowledge doesn’t always 
change how they act. Traditional taboos have filtered 
into the formal and non-formal health education sys- 
tems, and affect how governments and societies at 
large perceive sexuality and HIV. For instance, 
condoms were illegal in Myanmar until 1992. In some 
countries, a woman carrying one would be conside- 
red a prostitute by many members of her community, 
including the police. 
Effective youth education programmes need to 
equip young people with the skills and knowledge 
to effectively negotiate their sexual behaviour. Such 
programmes must start out by listening to the stu- 
dents, finding out about the reality of their sexual 
lives, and helping them to deal with these situations. 
The reality is that throughout Southeast Asia there 
  have been fairly profound changes in sexual morals 
a A and social behaviour: for instance, young couples 
pe : | \ Faas are now more likely to hold hands than 20 years ago.

### 117429: Slowly getting bolder

» now often left to the young themselves. Advertise- 
ments show a life in which an acknowledgment of 
sexuality is the social norm. 
Still, many traditional attitudes towards sexuality 
prevail and some have a particularly high cost. Because 
female virginity is highly prized in some countries, it 
is considered acceptable for young men to visit pros- 
titutes. The sex trade has been a major cause of the 
spread of Aids in the region. In Thailand, there are 
now more men infected with HIV than women, but 
the ratio is expected to be even by 2005. Forty-four 
per cent of the prostitutes in the northern region of 
Thailand are thought to be HIV-positive. In Cambo- 
dia,that figure is over 60 per cent in some areas. 
Dealing with prostitution 
In Cambodia, they start at 13, or even younger. 
Many sex customers delude themselves by thinking 
that they are less likely to contract HIV from the young. 
By UN standards, 80 per cent of the sex workers in 
Cambodia are youth. In other countries,many young 
hill tribe women have ended up in the sex industry. 
And this trade continues to grow. 
Many governments have tried to deal realisti- 
cally with the prostitution issue. For example, Cam- 
bodia and Thailand have supplied condoms in bro- 
thels. This is an important measure, when you 
consider that the young, less well-off men who drop 
out of school before being taught about HIV-pre- 
vention and reproductive health, are among those 
who may feel they can’t afford a condom. But not 
all condoms are free. Poverty, especially among 
youth,plays a major role in the spread of the virus. 
What appears to be a cheap price for acondom to an 
office worker in Bangkok, may be prohibitively 
expensive to a bicycle tire repairman in a village. As 
many African programmes have shown, money for 
education and prevention in all forms, from all sec- 
tors, is a key factor in fighting the spread of the virus. 
Because so many young people in Southeast Asia

are beyond the reach of traditional HIV/Aids educa- 
tion programmes, many of the most successful ones 
have involved peer group talks. T hese might take place 
in the workplace,informally at someone’s home, 
during youth festivals, vocational training pro- 
grammes or via other community activities. Peer-to- 
peer education involves not just discussing Aids and 
the peer pressures involving sex, but includes talking 
about everything, helping young people gain life skills 
to negotiate all the issues in their lives. 
The local media that may reach the majority of 
the less-educated population make an important 
contribution to forming people’s attitudes to HIV. 
Soap operas have been a successful medium for 
spreading the HIV message in Viet Nam. A non- 
governmental organization in Cambodia sponso- 
red a boat tour along the Mekong to produce a video 
about an HIV-positive Cambodian soldier retur- 
ning home. Because it was well-made and captured 
the audience’s interest, the video was an extremely 
effective education tool and was seen by over 
100,000 in the space of three months. 
To counter given the many negative represen- 
tations of Aids victims in Thailand, a group of NGOs 
has commissioned a series of portraits of young 
people with HIV. Professional photographers,many 
of whom have worked with fashion magazines, have 
donated their services to help young people see that 
these individuals are as beautiful, and as full of life, 
as everyone else. 
The epidemic, which disproportionately affects 
young people, must be seen as a socio-economic 
and a development problem by governments and 
society at large. Unless there is a rapid and effective 
response, it is foreseeable that Aids will curb the 
economic growth of the region in the years to come. 
It is imperative that development plans incorporate 
an HIV/Aids perspective, and all the more so when 
dealing specifically with programmes targeting the 
region’s youth. nu

contraceptive firm Durex, published in 
December 1998, showed that 60 per cent of 
those questioned used condoms. Polls taken by 
UNAIDS among 21-year-old Thai men found that use 
of condoms in brothels in northern Thailand rose 
from 61 per cent to 93 per cent between 1991 and 
1995, while the number of customers fell by half. 
Such changes in sexual behaviour are two solid 
results of Thailand’s large-scale effort to fight Aids. 
Even before the first case was detected in Thailand in 
1984, Mechai Viravaidya (“Mr. Condom”), a family 
planning pioneer and founder of the Population and 
Community Development Association, was publicly 
singing the praises of condoms. At first he was accused 
of tarnishing the country’s image, but then he was 
congratulated for his major contribution to halting the 
spread of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) and 
Aids. 
Non-governmental organizations were the first to 
support his work but were quickly overwhelmed.The 
rapid spread of such diseases spurred the government 
to launch a broad mobilization campaign. In 1992, it 
announced a three-year plan to monitor and fight Aids. 
By 1996,the plan’s budget had risen to $82.3 million, 
an initiative unmatched in any other country. 
Coordinated by the ministry of health, preventive 
education was gradually taken over by civil society as a 
whole. By 1990, even before the plan was launched, 
A survey conducted in Thailand for the British

television had become the chief source of information, 
with the broadcasting of expensive advertising spots. 
Rural communities set up solidarity funds and Bud- 
dhist monks opened their temples to ill people 
rejected by their families. T he religious association 
Sangha Metta, based at the Buddhist University of 
Mahamakut, at Chiang M ai, has so far trained more 
than 500 monks and nuns to work in prevention 
and treatment. 
In most towns, people with Aids or HIV took 
action. The New Life Friends association, set up 
in 1993, has several hundred members and is doing 
an impressive job of raising awareness, especially 
in schools. Many members are now teaching classes 
about the disease. 
Complacency 
and budget cuts 
From the early 1990s, clinics specializing in 
treating STD's, whose patients were mostly wor- 
king in the sex industry, generously handed out free 
condoms and pushed brothel owners to encourage 
their use. This programme,launched on a national 
scale in 1991 and known as the “100 per cent 
Condom Campaign” is the key to Thailand’s suc- 
cess, according to Wiwat Rochapichayakhon, the 
UNaIDs director for the Asia-Pacific region. 
But prevention has flagged for the past two 
years for several reasons. Rochapichayakhon says 
people have taken for granted the progress and 
have become complacent. The head of the 
European Union’s Aids programme in Thailand, 
Alessio Panza, blames a new policy of targeting 
specific groups rather than conducting a mass 
campaign. The chief of the Aids department in 
the Thai health ministry, Chaiyos Kunanusont, 
claims that the economic and financial crisis that 
erupted in 1997 is responsible. The budget to 
prevent the disease has been cut by a quarter, he 
complains. 
The effect of the economic crisis on the epide- 
mic is unclear. Will the newly-unemployed end up 
working in the brothels of Patpong and Pattaya? Or 
will the falling standard of living mean fewer cus- 
tomers and so less demand for new sex workers? 
One thing is certain: the thousands of people retur- 
ning to the countryside after losing their jobs in the 
towns are already causing sexual health problems in 
the north and northeast of Thailand. nu

thing very recent in developing countries— 
hen it happens at all. Many politicians, school 
principals and teachers are trapped by sexual taboos 
and believe Aids education encourages young people 
to have sex. Only in 1997 did a report by UNAIDS 
(entitled Effects of sex education on young people’s 
sexual behaviour) come out showing there was no 
such danger at all. 
The situation is finally beginning to change. 
Many developing countries have now taken the 
plunge and Aids education is part of their school 
curricula.Sometimes, subterfuges have to be used. 
Indonesia, a Muslim country, has chosen to talk 
about “reproductive health education” instead of 
sex education.Many countries have followed suit. 
Eee g schoolchildren about Aids is some- 
Senegal’s pioneering 
programmes 
In West and Central Africa,the subject is tack- 
led in “family life and population education” pro- 
grammes which offer a multi-disciplinary mix of 
biology, home economics and health, civic and 
moral education.However, difficulties lie not just in 
devising programmes but also in teaching them 
effectively. In most countries, the programmes have 
not yet been endorsed by the government. 
Senegal is a pioneer in the field and family educa- 
tion is even taught in primary schools there. Since 
1994, a Senegalese NGO, Group for Research and 
Development on Population and Education (GEEP) 
has set up 140 family education clubs, involving 52 
per cent of the country’s secondary schools. In 1997, 
three such clubs were started at D akar University. 
So far more than 2,000 pupils, a third of them 
girls, have completed training as group leaders. 
Their job is to make their fellow students, as well as 
young people not in school, aware of Aids through 
cultural days, fairs and holiday camp activities. Tea- 
chers help them by looking after administrative 
matters. During the 1997-98 school year, their work 
involved about 45,000 young people,representing 
32 per cent of all secondary school students. 
In Asia, the situation varies widely from coun- 
try to country. Thailand,Cambodia,Laos, Viet Nam 
and SriLanka have well-established prevention pro- 
grammes which are part of formal education, while 
Nepal, Pakistan,Bangladesh and the Maldives are 
only just getting started. In India, an Aids aware- 
ness campaign is supposed to be part of physical 
education and courses in “social useful productive 
work”. But often teachers do not even know such 
programmes exist, so they have to make do by them- 
selves. In the most remote parts of India and elsew- 
here, teachers with little knowledge of Aids are 
expected to initiate an open discussion about sexua- 
lity with classes of 50 to 80 pupils without the help 
of books on the subject. T his is asking too much. 
Teachers: overcoming 
their own inhibitions 
“One of my students asked me a question about 
Aids which I just didn’t know how to answer, so I said 
it wasn’t the subject we were dealing with,” admitted 
a history teacher in Africa during a seminar in Lomé 
(Togo) in April 1999. “But I had the feeling it was 
the first time the child had dared to ask the question 
and I fear he won’t dare ask it again.” 
The teachers, themselves inhibited, do not 
know how to tackle the subject. In West Africa,only 
Guinea has arranged for Aids education at the 
National Teachers’College, while Burkina Faso and

The other countries have made little headway. 
Teachers also need to have access to interactive 
teaching methods so they can create an atmosphere 
of confidence to encourage young people to voice their 
concerns and learn to protect themselves. But tea- 
ching materials are seriously lacking. At the beginning 
of the 1990s, UNEsco and the World Health Organi- 
zation (WHO) published some manuals for school 
curriculum planners suggesting activities for pupils 
and how teachers might approach the subject (see 
box).Several thousand of these well-produced guides 
were printed, but there are 55 million teachers in the 
world. More recently, Togo put out a brochure for 
schoolchildren, but it was distributed only privately. 
Reach children 
when they’re young 
Even when appropriate tools are available, tea- 
chers do not always make use of them.Experience 
shows that young teachers,who adapt much more 
easily to new approaches, are the ones to rely on. 
As a rule, nobody is really prepared to talk to young 
people about sex. Parents do not feel up to the job 
and pass it on to the teachers who in turn pass it 
back to the family or the church. This is especially 
so in majority-Catholic countries, mainly in Latin 
America, where condoms are still sometimes regar- 
ded as “an instrument of the devil.” Surveys by 
UNAIDS show that when young people are well- 
informed about the disease, they protect themselves 
more effectively than adults. In Chile, Brazil and 
Mexico, boys between 15 and 18 are the most fre- 
quent users of condoms. 
But education authorities still balk at prevention 
programmes and do not like to recognize that young 
people are sexually active .E ven though premarital 
sex is frowned upon, it is common among teenagers,

Getting youth through the Aids crisis 
who change partners more often than adults. This is 
why about half the new cases of infection are found 
among people between 15 and 24. So they must be 
warned about Aids as early as possible. 
The ideal age to start preventive education is 
about seven, according to experts. Children of that 
age do not have inhibitions, express themselves 
openly at school and freely pass on what they learn 
to the rest of their family and are thus excellent 
agents of communication. It is too late to begin 
introducing this education in secondary school 
because between a quarter and a half of all school- 
children in developing countries drop out of school 
after five years. Programmes outside school are the- 
refore vital to combat Aids. There are some, but 
not enough programmes, which mainly reach chil- 
dren in big towns. 
So there is a great deal of work to be done.But 
people are clearly becoming aware of the problem. 
After two decades of silence, the issue of Aids has 
finally reached the horizon of the classroom. ®

Se up in 1987, UNEsco’s Section for Preventive Edu- 
cation aims to develop responsible attitudes and 
behaviour at individual and community levels using edu- 
cational strategies. The goal is to enhance national capa- 
cities to implement effective educational programmes. This 
can mean implementing pilot projects providing exper- 
tise, and organizing conferences and teacher training 
workshops. It assists in launching international cam- 
paigns aimed at youth in collaboration with civil society, 
promoting peer education,creative teaching and publi- 
shing guides for teachers and educational materials. 
The Unit of Cultural Research and Management's 
project originated in the Unaips Coordinated Appeal for 
1998-1999.lts basic concern is to understand and take 
into account people’s cultures in the broadest sense 
when developing preventive actions against HIV/Aids. 
The World Foundation for Aids Research and Preven- 
tion was established in 1993 by UNesco Director-General 
Federico Mayor and Professor Luc Montagnier, co-disco- 
verer of the HIV virus. The goal of the foundation is to 
mobilize all kinds of private initiatives, to create new 
partnerships and find novel forms of co-operation, espe- 
cially in research and prevention, in order to support and 
continue actions against Aids taken by public authorities.

A from the Rwandan capital of Kigali, the 
teachers have gathered for a day of instruc- 
tion about Aids organized by the NGO Enfants réfu- 
giés du monde. T hey all admit to being confused: 
what can we do? they ask. Their pupils start having 
sex quite early on—around 16 for boys, but much 
earlier, from about 12 and up for girls, who are often 
pestered and harassed by adults. T he teachers all 
agree that the school 1s ideally situated to reach 
young people in efforts to prevent the spread of the 
disease. But how exactly can they get the message 
across to their pupils? 
T he curriculum officially includes lessons about 
Aids and sexually transmitted diseases (ST Ds), but 
teachers have not been taught how to tackle these sub- 
jects. They don’t have books or other written mate- 
rial, their own knowledge 1s limited and mainly obtai- 
ned from the radio. Their mother tongue lacks 
euphemisms for sexual matters. And even the most 
energetic teachers shy away from the subject for fear 
of being accused by parents of corrupting the minds of 
their children. 
  
An ‘internal army’ 
“Asaresult,” says a primary school inspector, “most 
of them just don’t teach the classes theyre supposed 
to.” According to one female teacher, “it’s impossible in 
Rwanda to talk about sex with children under 12.” 
A team from the Rwandan Child to Child pro- 
gramme gives a one-day crash course on a teaching 
method by which children learn to be more concer- 
ned about their own health and that of others. The 
training aims to equip the teachers with information 
about Aids and techniques for tackling the subject. 
Right from the start,the team reminds partici- 
pants that Aids, unlike any other sexually transmit- 
ted disease, 1s a blood disease, not one directly affec- 
ting sexual organs. From this angle, teachers can 
handle the matter more calmly, like any other infec- 
tion. The problem is that many teachers are unclear 
about the various functions of blood. With malaria 
widespread in the region, they know that red blood 
cells carry oxygen, but they are less familiar with 
white ones or with problems of the immune system. 
Basic information about blood 1s conveyed with 
the help of games and very brief talks. The immune 
system, for example, 1s presented as a professionally 
organized “internal army” which attracts their atten- 
tion. They overcome their shyness and join in acting

out how the virus attacks the body and how the various 
parts of the immune system fight back. A“Mr. HIV” 
and a “Mr. Malaria” give talks about the virus and 
how 1t spreads. 
Before looking at how the virus enters the human 
body, the teachers are asked to draw the male and 
female genitals. Very few are comfortable doing so. 
But making a life-size model of the female genitals, 
using whatever 1s at hand (an avocado pear for the 
uterus, for example) 1s met with enthusiasm. A pre- 
sentation about the different stages of Aids gives the 
teachers a chance to talk at length about the disease, 
which 1s so present in their everyday life and yet 
remains mvisible.

made, the question of prevention 1s tackled. The

Aids 1s presented as a kind of Biblical flood and the 
class “embarks” on one of three “arks”’—abstinence, 
fidelity or condom—to escape drowning. 
An evaluation of the training shows that teachers 
feel it 1s vital to improve their scientific knowledge. 
But thisisn’t enough for them. Students in higher 
grades are asking them all sorts of questions about 
sexuality, which they are at a loss to answer. _

### 117433: Uganda: a jihad against AIDS

Uganda: a jihad against Aids 
In informal schools tied to mosques, Muslim religious leaders have taken on a pivotal role in 
teaching youth the basics of prevention 
ohammed Mubiru admits that Aids is a 
M topic he has never discussed with his 
parents. “They would think I was being dis- 
respectful,” he says. So where did Mubiru, a teena- 
ger, learn about the disease? 
In an innovative project launched by the Isla- 
mic Medical Association of Uganda (IM AU), youth 
in Mpigi (50 km southwest of Kampala) and Kamuli 
Districts (140 km northeast of the capital) are lear- 
ning about Aids at Madarasa schools associated with 
the mosques in their villages. These schools are open 
on weekends to teach Muslim children the Arabic 
language and principles of Islamic culture and beha- 
viour. Muslims account for about 16 per cent of 
Uganda’s 20 million people. In 1989, the country’s 
highest Muslim authority declared a jihad (holy 
war) on Aids,paving the way for the Madarasa Aids 
Education and Prevention project. 
In a 36-lesson curriculum developed by the 
Ugandan Ministry of Health and the United 
‘She needs to know 
how to say no and mean no’ 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), youth in the 
Madarasa schools learn about HIV/Aids transmis- 
sion,prevention and control during 40-minute ses- 
sions. The curriculum was recently enriched with a 
life skills component to equip youth with some of 
the tools they need for building self-esteem and 
coping with various challenges of growing up. Topics 
include resisting peer pressure, communication skills 
and being assertive: “If a girl is asked by a man to 
have sex, she needs to know how to say no and mean 
no,” insists Neema Nakyanjo, IM AU's project offi- 
cer. He helps to train county sheikhs, imams and 
their assistants to use the curriculum. T hese trai- 
nees, in-turn, supervise the training of volunteer 
Madarasa teachers at mosques in their area. Since its 
launch in 1995, the programme has reached more 
than 36,000 children in 350 schools. 
“It is challenging to introduce the topic of Aids, 
but children need to know,” says Imam Hassan 
Magola from Bukulube Mosque. The project under- 
lines that certain traditional Muslim practices 
can increase the risk of exposure to the HIV 
virus, namely male circumcision with unsterile

instruments and ablution of the dead without pro- 
tective gloves. Introducing the topic of condoms 
however proved to be the single greatest hurdle. In 
the first year, the issue was removed from the cur- 
riculum after some religious leaders argued that 
recommending use of condoms would promote sex 
outside marriage. Over a year, IMAU held a dia- 
logue with Islamic leaders to work through their 
concerns, stressing that the condom was only being 
promoted as protection after the failure of the first 
two lines of defence: abstaining from sex and having 
sex only within marriage. As IM AU argued, girls 
do become pregnant before marriage and there are 
many cases of sexually transmitted disease among 
the unmarried. Islamic leaders eventually agreed 
that education on the responsible use of condoms 
was acceptable and the topic was reinserted in the 
curriculum in the second year. 
Now, the project’s main struggle is with funding. 
UNICEF has contributed $35,000 to the project 
since its launch while parents are encouraged to give 
the Madarasa teacher 100 Ugandan shillings per 
session (less than 10 cents) and have repeatedly 
expressed their support for the project. Growing 
numbers of non-Muslim parents are seeking to enrol 
their children in the Madarasa Aids classes. What's 
clear is that students feel able to talk more openly 
about the subject. “When I see someone with Aids, 
I know what they are going through and I sympa- 
thize,” says one student. “I have learned that Aids 
is a reality and I live in fear of it.” u

e street 1s their home. For several thousand 
T g Mexicans, it is the place where they play, 
eat, sleep and when they can, work. For many, 
the sex trade is the only way of earning a few pesos. 
It is also the most likely way that they will become 
infected with HIV. In a few years time, many of them 
will succumb to Aids. 
Finding suitable ways to prevent Aids is no 
simple task, and even less so when street children 
are concerned. “They are anxious, unstable and 
sometimes aggressive,” says psychologist Gualberto 
Gatica. To help tackle the problem, the NGO Casa 
Alianza, which has been working in Mexico since 
1986, launched its Luna (“Moon”) programme two 
years ago. It is the only Aids prevention campaign 
in Latin America designed especially for homeless 
children. 
Distorted 
knowledge 
Luna, a name the infected children conjured 
up to evoke light amid darkness, is currently 
monitoring 6,180 children and teenagers. Besides 
being present on the preventive front, the pro- 
gramme also keeps a close check on HIV-positive 
children, provides medical treatment for youth 
with Aids and psychological counselling for their 
friends. 
“Since 1997, the number of infected children 
has risen, so were focusing on prevention,” 
explains Nicasio Garcia Lopez, the programme’s 
coordinator. “Street children usually know about 
sex and Aids, but it’s often distorted knowledge. 
Hence the importance of effective prevention.” 
Volunteers and teachers from Casa Alianza 
comb the capital’s neighbourhoods every day to 
persuade boys and girls to go to the organization’s 
“shelter” where they can attend an hour-long 
workshop twice a week called “HIV/Aids—What 
is it?’. With the help of simple, colourful teaching 
materials, they learn how the disease spreads and 
how to protect themselves against it. Many chil- 
dren are also reached directly on their home 
ground—the street. When they go around the city, 
Casa Alianza’s teachers carry games with them 
that can be set up anywhere, all based on ques- 
tions and answers. A game of darts for example. 
Depending on where the children land the darts

on the board, they must answer different ques- 
tions. Another, called Marathon, is based on an 
athletics race. The most popular game, Lunoca,is 
like snakes and ladders and provides information 
about HIV, the immune system and ways to pre- 
vent Aids. Such teaching material is easy to use 
and entirely based on linking ideas and pictures. 
A 1996 joint survey by the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Mexico City 
officials found that 13,373 young people under 
18 lived and/or worked in the streets of the capi- 
tal. Their number grew by 20 per cent between 
1992 and 1995—more than 6 per cent a year. 
Casa Alianza is also present in the United 
States, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa 
Rica and Nicaragua and is setting up a Luna net- 
work in Latin America, based on the methods, 
equipment and learning games used in Mexico. 
“The idea is to copy the material and come up 
with a manual which can be used all over Latin 
America to assess the results,” says the program- 
me coordinator. 
The Mexican headquarters of Casa Alianza 
also plans to devise new materials and games, 
such as colouring books, picture slides and 
puzzles which contain information about HIV. 
The organization also responds to frequent 
requests to give talks to schools, parishes and 
Mexican institutions which care for disadvanta- 
ged children. This is perhaps the best evidence 
that the Luna programme is shining brightly. =

The stigma of Aids

Discrimination against people with Aids 
is a major obstacle to fighting the epidemic. 
The solution lies in education

dressed, | do the same 
things as everyone else. 
Is there a difference 
between me and them? 
Is there something on

danger to anyone.

* Member of the the Canadian 
HIV/Aids Legal Network 
province hardest hit by the Aids epidemic, Gugu 
Dlaminidied because of the disease. But it wasn’t 
the virus per se that killed her. She was accused by fel- 
low-villagers of having brought shame on the com- 
munity by talking publicly about being HIV-positive. 
When she was beaten by a neighbour who advised her 
to keep quiet, she went to the police but they did 
nothing to protect her. T he next night, villagers attac- 
ked her house before stoning her and beating her to 
death. 
While this story has gone round the world, there 
are other less bloody but just as revealing tales that 
receive no attention. HIV-positive children are the 
targets of other children’s angry parents who do 
their utmost to have them expelled from the nur- 
sery or school or excluded from sports activities. 
Some doctors and dentists refuse to treat people 
with Aids. Community help projects regularly come 
up against the refusal of local inhabitants to have 
such “plague-stricken” people living in their neigh- 
bourhood.Even dead, these people continue to ins- 
til fear, with some funeral parlours refusing to accept 
their remains. 
Victims of such discrimination are often poor 
and isolated. They do not dare complain about how 
they are treated for fear of making things worse. The 
few statistics about them hardly reflect the extent 
of the phenomenon.The number of known cases is 
just the tip of the iceberg.

As well as being frequently ostracized by ordi- 
nary folk, HIV-positive people are sometimes also 
hit by discriminatory laws. Using prevention as a 
pretext,governments adopt laws which violate the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Official 
public health programmes are sometimes the source 
of violations. There are plenty of examples. 
Blood tests have been made compulsory for cer- 
tain “target populations” such as newborn babies 
in New York state,prison inmates in at least 18 U.S. 
states and foreigners wishing to stay more than 30 
days in such countries as Egypt, Bulgaria and Geor- 
gia. In some U.S.states,doctors are obliged to pass 
on to the authorities the names of patients who have 
tested positive for HIV. As a rule, HIV-positive 
people are refused entry to the United States.

out that “if one were to read the Universal Decla- 
ration of Human Rights with the aim of finding out 
which human rights have been affected by various 
responses to Aids, one would see that most, if not 
all, basic human rights and freedoms, laid down as 
the common standard of achievement for humanity 
more than 40 years ago, have been challenged, vio- 
lated, or denied in the context of HIV/Aids.” Experts 
have pointed out in vain that no medical or public 
health reason justifies measures restricting the rights 
of HIV-positive people. These measures are usually 
ineffective and even counterproductive. And yet, 
discrimination continues. 
Most ill people evoke compassion but Aids trig- 
gers the opposite reaction. T he stigma of HIV is tied 
to powerful social symbols, sources of prejudice and 
intolerance towards groups which may vary from 
one country to the next but all share a common trait: 
they are people who were marginalized even before 
the emergence of Aids. They include immigrants, 
refugees, people in prison, male and female prosti- 
tutes,native peoples, drug addicts and homosexuals. 
It is sometimes enough just to belong to one of these 
so-called “risk” groups to be considered a “threat” 
and thus presumed guilty of spreading the epide- 
mic. People who help them are often regarded as 
their “accomplices”. 
The world appears to be divided in two. On one 
side are people with Aids and those who help them

» and on the other, those who imagine they are safe 
from the disease and do not feel concerned. Some in 
the first group avoid health and social services 
because of the stigma to which they are subjected 
and their fear of discrimination. T hose who most 
need help, information and education are thus for- 
ced underground which makes them even more vul- 
nerable. Some people refuse to be tested for Aids, 
preferring not to know. Others keep their infection 
secret or else deny it. 
People in the second group may be sticking their 
head in the sand like ostriches, but they are not for 
that matter spared by the epidemic. Their self-defence 
mechanisms feed their ignorance and create illusions 
that give them a false sense of security. They think HIV 
only strikes at “risk” groups—sealed communities 
with which they have no contact. Believing that HIV 
respects social frontiers makes them vulnerable in 
turn. At an institutional level, such a belief slows down 
awareness programmes and helps to reduce the fun- 
ding they attract. So the stigma and discrimination 
that accompany Aids are not only consequences of 
the epidemic but also contribute to its spread. 
The late Jonathan Mann, who was head of the 
World Health Organization’s Special Programme 
on Aids and of Harvard University’s Francois- Xavier 
Bagnoud Center, insisted that human rights feature 
prominently in the campaign against HIV. Arguing 
that such protection of ill or HIV-infected people 
was vital for ethical, judicial and practical reasons, he 
stressed that a community could not deal effecti- 
vely with the disease if it failed to respect the basic 
right of people to have a say in decisions concerning 
their own future. 
Protecting the victims 
Although the stigma of HIV/Aids is tied to igno- 
rance,informing people about the virus and the risk 
of catching it 1s not enough to eradicate it.Preven- 
tive education has to be accompanied by serious 
education about discrimination, but this is still at 
an embryonic stage. 
At the international level,health, legal and ethics 
experts,representatives of communities affected by 
the disease and study groups have been insisting for 
several years on the need to ensure that policies to 
reduce the spread of Aids and care for its victims 
respect their rights and their dignity, whether they 
have the disease or are just at risk. But the appeals of 
the experts will remain a dead letter without broad 
public understanding and sufficient will, especially 
on the part of political decision-makers. 
The UN High Commission for Human Rights 
and UNAIDS in 1998 published 12 guidelines for 
states on the rights of individuals concerning 
HIV/Aids. One of them recommended laws to pro- 
tect victims of discrimination in private and public 
sectors while guaranteeing respect for privacy and 
confidentiality. Another focused on one of the 
sources of discrimination and called on states to 
“promote the wide and ongoing distribution of crea- 
tive education, training and media programmes 
explicitly designed to change attitudes of discrimi-

nation and stigmatization associated with HIV/Aids 
to understanding and acceptance.” 
The current gap between the quantity of recom- 
mendations and a sluggish bureaucracy is glaring. 
In Aids prevention campaigns, the issue of discri- 
mination often falls by the wayside and 1s rarely dis- 
cussed in schools. The odd educational film attacks 
the stigma but no-one can boast of a broad aware- 
ness campaign that has an important impact on 
society. 
T he main features of education against discri- 
mination must be worked out in each country accor- 
ding to the social context and the evolution of the 
disease. After the targets and participants have been 
chosen, steps must be taken to create a friendlier 
atmosphere for people who have Aids and who face 
rejection and indifference. T his must also be done 
for their families and friends as well as all those invol- 
ved in the fight against the epidemic. We must not 
forget that the disease is the enemy, not the people 
who have it. u

### 117436: The Death penalty: abolition gains ground

THE DEATH PENALTY: 
ABOLITION GAINS GROUND 
  
+ Martine Jacot 
Countries that have abolished capital punishment now outnumber those applying it. 
But four countries still account for 80 per cent of all executions. 
In the teeming jumble of daily news, 
one important human rights event 
passed almost unnoticed recently: on 
June 2, 1999, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin commuted the death sentences of 
716 people to life imprisonment. The 
death penalty was thereby effectively abo- 
lished in Russia, in line with its commit- 
ment upon joining the Council of 
Europe! in 1996. In that year, Russia exe- 
cuted 40 death row prisoners, sadly 
almost a dark world record. 
Russian Justice Minister Pavel 
Krasheninnikov said the presidential 
decree was “a historic day” for his coun- 
try. The decision may encourage the for- 
mer Soviet bloc countries wishing to 
become members of the Council of 
Europe to follow suit or risk being barred 
in the future. 
Tipping 
the balance 
The Council was the first body to sign 
(in 1983) an international agreement 
obliging the signatories to abolish the 
death penalty in peacetime. The treaty 
(Protocol 6 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights) came into effect in 
1985. Since the Berlin Wall came down, 
22 former or new European countries 
have dropped capital punishment, at least 
for “ordinary” crimes. The most recent 
were this year: Latvia, Cyprus and 
Northern Ireland. In 1998, Azerbaijan, 
Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania took the 
same step for all categories of offences 
and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan decla- 
red moratoriums on executions. 
Europe is not the only continent 
1 Set up in 1949, the Council of Europe, based in 
Strasbourg (France), aims to strengthen 
democracy, human rights and rule of law in its 
member-states, which have grown from 23 before 
the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to 40 today.

where the abolitionist cause has made 
headway. Amnesty International notes 
that the number of countries that have 
totally abolished the death penalty has tri- 
pled over the past 20 years—from 19 in 
1979 to 68 by April 1999. To this list can

prisoners over the past 20 years. Today 
countries opposing the death penalty out- 
number those applying it. The “balance” 
tipped only recently, between 1997 and 
1998. When you look at the picture over 
the whole century, progress is even more 
impressive: in 1899 only Venezuela, Costa 
Rica and the tiny republic of San Marino, 
in Italy, had decided to abolish the death 
penalty. 
Such progress is clearly linked with 
the growth of local and international 
human rights movements. The death 
penalty is increasingly thought of as a 
cruel and inhuman punishment. Its irre- 
versibility always touches people’s 
consciences in cases where it turns out 
that innocent people have been victims of 
arbitrary or unfair trials, cases which 
receive more and more publicity these 
days. International pressure has also 
increased. 1999 saw the tenth anniversary 
of the UN General Assembly’s adoption 
of its first protocol calling for the aboli- 
tion of the death penalty. 
Many countries decided to abolish 
capital punishment as a way of turning 
over a new leaf following long periods of 
political repression. This is what happe- 
ned not only in the former communist 
countries of Eastern Europe but also in 
South Africa (1997) and before that in 
Latin America—in Argentina, Brazil, 
Peru, Nicaragua and El Salvador. 
A cradle 
of human rights 
Elsewhere, action by courageous poli- 
tical leaders has been needed to overcome 
local public opinion that has remained 
mostly in favour of the death penalty. The 
French socialist government,for example, 
abolished the death penalty in 1981 soon 
after taking office. But opinion polls sho- 
wed it was not until 18 years later, in 
1999, that a majority of the public polled 
finally turned against the death penalty, 
despite France’s reputation as the “cradle 
of human rights”. In other countries, the 
process has sometimes been a very long 
one. Belgium and Greece repealed the 
death penalty in 1996 and 1993 respecti- 
vely, more than 20 years after carrying out 
their last executions. 
Despite this progress, Amnesty 
International reminds us that at least 
1,625 prisoners were executed in 1998 in 
37 countries, four of which—China, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 
United States and Iran—accounted for 
80 per cent of the total. 
In China, for want of official figures, 
Amnesty estimates that in 1998 at least

and 66 in Iran. In the United States (see 
p.- 39), 68 prisoners were executed, most 
by lethal injection. Three of the U.S. pri- 
soners were under 17 when they commit- 
ted their crimes. Since 1990, only six 
countries—the United States, Iran, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and 
Yemen—have continued imposing death 
sentences on people who were minors at 
the time of their offence. But in Yemen, a 
presidential decree has just put an end to 
this practice. The UN Convention on the 
Rights of the Child forbids the death sen- 
tence in the case of minors and has been 
ratified by all UN member-states except 
for Somalia and the United States. 
A contagious effect 
on neighbouring nations 
Is the United States—regarded, like 
France, as a “cradle of human rights”— 
having a contagious effect on some of its 
neighbours? In the Caribbean, rampant 
crime has fired support for capital 
punishment among governments and 
public opinion. Nine prisoners were exe- 
cuted by hanging in early June 1999 in 
Port-of-Spain, capital of the Caribbean 
state of Trinidad and Tobago, five years 
after the last execution took place there. 
The Bahamas used the gallows again 
twice in 1998, after a two-year pause. 
While the last execution by hanging in 
Jamaica took place in 1988, there’s a high 
risk that the practice could be resumed: 
there are 40 people on death row there, 
several of whom have almost exhausted 
all legal recourse. 
The myth 
of deterrence 
Rampant crime was also used by the 
authorities in the Philippines to justify 
restoring the death penalty in December 
1993, with the first execution being car- 
ried out in February 1999. Yet this coun - 
try was the first in Asia to abolish capital 
punishment, in 1987, after the fall of 
President Ferdinand Marcos. The current 
head of state, Joseph Estrada,has stressed 
his determination to attack poverty—the 
“compost-heap of crime”—but without 
abolishing the death penalty. Recent opi- 
nion polls show about 80 per cent of 
Filipinos are in favour of it. Over the past 
six years, 914 people have been sentenced 
to death in the Philippines. 
But so far no study has shown clearly 
that capital punishment is a deterrent.On 
the contrary, the murder rate has fallen in 
several countries that have abolished it, 
such as Canada, a neighbour of the 
United States. Amnesty International and 
other human rights organizations hope 
the U.S., among others, will at least abo- 
lish the death penalty for people who were 
minors when they committed their crime, 
as well as for the mentally ill and the 
elderly. u

### 117437: The American exception

THE AMERICAN EXCEPTION 
  
+ Vicky Hliott 
In a climate influenced by the religious right, a public stand against the death penalty 
is regarded as nothing short of political suicide 
In a nation where the death penalty is in 
force in 38 out of 51 states, roughly 
3,500 prisoners are waiting on death 
row, 47 per cent of them white and 42 per 
cent black.* Executions are on the rise, with 
68 carried out in 1998. In addition to impo- 
sing the death penalty for crimes committed 
by juveniles, the U.S. is also unusual in 
making no exceptions for the mentally retar- 
ded. 
What explains the endorsement of the 
death penalty by four out of every five Ame- 
ricans? In the civil rights period of the1960s, 
the percentage of those in its favour briefly 
dipped as low as 42 per cent.But since the 
Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976,after 
a moratorium of about a decade, support 
has been little short of monolithic. It is true 
that the figures drop (to about 60 per cent) 
if those surveyed are presented the alterna- 
tive of keeping serious offenders in jail 
without possibility of parole. 
The ‘death belt’ 
However, fear of crime persists and a puni- 
tive climate remains. Lawmakers are conti- 
nually introducing bills to expand the list of 
“aggravating factors” presented to the jury in 
many states in the sentencing phase of a capi- 
tal case. 
The so-called “Death Belt” of the Sou- 
thern states, with their history of lynch law, 
accounts for a hefty percentage of death row 
inmates, and half of the executions in 1997 
were carried out in Texas alone. But Cali- 
fornia,which pays out more for its prisons 
than its universities, now has the largest 
number of inmates on death row. New York, 
whose Governor Mario Cuomo was one of 
the few American politicians in recent his- 
tory willing to risk a public stand for aboli- 
tion, has brought the death penalty back. 
And in Arizona,officials intend to accele- 
rate the pace of executions. 
Built on Puritanical foundations, human 
relations in this gun-toting culture are still 
viewed in Manichean terms, validating the 
frontiersman’s call for the bad guy to be 
strung up. In a climate heavily influenced 
by the religious right, a public stand against

In Texas, the cross marking the grave of an executed prisoner bears his number, not his name. 
capital punishment is regarded as nothing 
short of political suicide. Executive cle- 
mency, which was used to commute many 
death sentences to life imprisonment during 
the heyday of the gangsters in the 1930s and 
1940s, is rarely exercised. Witness Gover- 
nor Bill Clinton,who approved the execu- 
tion of a mentally retarded convict in Arkan- 
sas just after winning the presidential 
elections in 1992,and California’s Demo- 
cratic Governor Gray Davis, who has pas- 
sed up the possibility of staying two execu- 
tions this year. 
Moreover, the criminal justice system is 
inextricably intertwined with electoral poli- 
tics. District attorneys, who make the deci- 
sion whether to seek the death penalty in a 
given case, are elected. State judges, once 
appointed, face a retention vote at the next 
general elections. While federal judges are 
appointed for life, they face a grueling congres- 
sional confirmation battle. Public perception 
is that capital cases, which can cost a state in 
the region of $1.2 million to prosecute, are 
subject to unduly lengthy scrutiny. In fact, 
legislatures around the country have made it 
increasingly difficult to bring appeals. 
Meanwhile, despite a 1984 Supreme 
Court ruling intended to correct racial bias 
in jury selection, the operation of the death 
penalty remains racially skewed. Of the 1,838 
District Attorneys in death penalty states as 
of May this year, only 22 were Hispanic and 
22 black. Although roughly equal numbers 
of blacks and whites are homicide victims, of 
the 500 people put to death between 1977 
and 1998, 81.8 per cent were convicted of 
killing a white person. Setting aside cases 
involving particularly egregious crimes such as 
serial killings, the death penalty falls dispro- 
portionately, for crimes of equal severity, upon 
poor blacks who cannot afford adequate legal 
representation. 
There are some signs of movement in 
public opinion. A cluster of miscarriages of 
justice on death row and the reversal of seve- 
ral convictions have helped to rally support 
both for a new moratorium on executions and 
for a plan to divert spending on death penalty 
cases into a fund for the families of homicide 
victims. It is also conceivable that if a Demo- 
crat comes to power at the next elections and 
appoints two new justices of a less than 
extreme conservative persuasion, the Supreme 
Court might turn the situation around. 
Between now and then, prisoners wait 
on death row. In the words of one juvenile 
offender in Oklahoma, “To condemn me to 
death ... is to say my life has no positive 
value, I'm beyond correction or rehabilita- 
tion.” It is strange that a nation that puts such 
store in the perfectibility of the individual is 
willing to discard so many lives. u

### 117438: The Melting pot of modern dance

THE MELTING POT 
OF MODERN DANCE 
  
+ Jean-Marc Adolphe and Martine Jacot 
More than ever before, modern dance is synonymous with buzzing cultural exchange—from 
North to South, East to West, and vice-versa 
The scene is set in Soweto, one of Johan- 
nesburg’s notoriously poor townships, 
soon after Nelson Mandela’s election in 
April 1994 as president of South Africa.lt 
was here in Soweto, during riots in 1976, that 
the apartheid government’s police shot dead 
more than 500 young people. 
Jean-Francois Duroure, a white French 
dancer trained in Angers (France) and at 
the schools of German choreographer Pina 
Bausch and Americans Merce Cunningham 
and Viola Faber, is trying to explain his pro- 
ject to a group of young street dancers. He 
speaks in broken English which his listeners 
do not fully understand. The look on their 
faces seems to say: ‘Just what does this white 
man want of us and why is he here? 
Duroure talks about his great curiosity, his 
wish to exchange experiences and to cho- 
reograph them. No reaction from the 
audience. His words don’t seem to get 
through. Suddenly, Duroure gets up and 
starts to dance. The youths join in one by 
one and the impromptu performance lasts 
five hours. 
Communicating 
without words 
“This is how we finally started to com- 
municate—without any words,” Duroure 
says. “This is how I learned to find my phy- 
sical spontaneity with them, people without 
formal training as dancers but who had dan- 
ced since birth. This is how I brought them 
what I could and how we established mutual 
confidence and respect which enabled us 
to create together.” 
The result was What AreYou Doing Here, 
a “choreographed report” of sketches blen- 
ding dance, music and song with street 
scenes and township ceremonies. French 
and South African cultural officials were 
sceptical at first about this project by a white

dancer but the final result was warmly recei- 
ved by the public in South Africa and 
Europe in 1997 and 1998.T he choreogra- 
pher is currently repeating the experience 
in the city of Durban in Kwazulu-Natal. 
Unlike Duroure, who dances mainly to 
“inspire encounters and complicity”, Ea 
Sola seeks through her work to delve into 
unknown dimensions of the inner self. “It’s 
something from very deep down inside 
which you then have to pass on to others,” 
she says. Sola is Vietnamese and when she 
was barely a teenager, she was forced into 
exile in the West,and felt at a loss. 
She returned to Viet Nam to delve into 
her country’s rich culture,mainly through 
the northern Vietnamese traditional art form 
known as hat chéo which dates back to the 
13th century and combines song, drama, 
dance and percussion. With 15 Vietnamese

peasants, she produced a modern work, 
which breaks through communication bar- 
riers, about remembering pain. Sécheresse et 
pluie (“Drought and rain”) was a lean, strip- 
ped-down performance in which the pea- 
sants at one point waved pictures of dead 
relatives. T he work was followed by Il a été 
une fois (“Once upon a time”) and Voila 
voila, which was performed at the Lincoln 
Center in New York. Travelling through Ger- 
many, France,Denmark,Sweden,Belgium, 
Britain and Portugal with her Vietnamese 
dancers and musicians, Sola noticed “with 
the same surprise”’that at each destination 
the “private language of the body” conveyed 
feelings beyond words. So there was no need 
for any translations. 
A nomadic art 
José Navas 1s from Venezuela, with 
Indian and Spanish blood from his mother 
and Italian and African blood through his 
father. He has been based for the last few 
years in Montreal (Canada) after studying 
in New York, and dances and choreographs 
regularly in both Europe and North Ame- 
rica. By “talking about his Venezuelan 
culture” through his body, he has found a 
way of breaking down language barriers. 
Modern dance has clearly become a 
major vehicle for cultural exchange around 
the world. It does more than simply 
transcend spoken words: it seems to repre- 
sent a common experience of humanity. “We 
are all human beings—a link that comes 
before national or ethnic ties,” says Duroure. 
“A child who cries conveys the same mes- 
sage everywhere.” Dance also involves a dif- 
ferent view of things, appealing to the ima- 
gination, just like music, and often with 
music.

‘| was trained in African 
styles by the older men 
in the village but | never 
imagined | could make 
a career of it or that | could 
dance in silence, without 
music. Abroad, | discovered 
the music inside me.’ 
All these factors partly explain the 
upsurge of modern dance, a worldwide phe- 
nomenon. In 1998, 442 choreographers from 
52 countries attended the prestigious Inter- 
national Choreography Festival in Seine 
Saint-Denis (a suburb of Paris,France). For 
the past decade, more and more festivals 
giving pride of place to modern dance have 
been held all over the world—in Prague 
(Tanec Praha, every June), Brazil (Festival 
Internacional de Danca, in Belo Horizonte 
in November), Tokyo (the Yokohama Festi- 
val), Stockholm (Dansen Hus), Vilnius 
(Lithuania) and Adelaide (Australia). Festi- 
vals are also spreading across the Mediter- 
ranean region. A modern dance gathering 
was held in Tunis in early 1999, with dan- 
cers from Egypt, Lebanon, Algeria, 
Morocco, Jordan and Syria.Others will soon 
take place in Casablanca and Beirut. 
Dance often accompanies openings and 
growth in other domains. In 1995, the first 
Luanda Festival in Angola symbolized 
attempts to revive the country after 20 years 
of civil war. The second one,held in 1998, 
claimed the title of the Festival of African 
Choreographic Creation and showcased the 
blossoming of modern dance across the 
continent. Some of the prizewinning 
troupes—from Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, 
Kenya, South Africa,Nigeria,Madagascar, 
Ghana and Mozambique—went to the Fes- 
tival of New Dance in Montreal (Canada) in 
September 1999. 
Dance—the art of movement—has 
always been, in essence, nomadic in cha- 
racter (see box). Yet the past few years have 
seen a tremendous mingling of different tra- 
ditions, with artists who are increasingly 
mobile in time and space. Two French cho- »

### 117441: Shedding straitjackets

SHEDDING STRAITJACKETS  
ance, like other art-forms, hasbeen alive since 
Dime immemorial, never ceasing to gain new 
ground. At the temple of Palaiokastro, in Crete, 
dance was offered to Zeus to make the vines and 
farm animals fertile. Ceremonies like this were to 
be found from India to pre-Columbia America. Is it 
possible to draw the line at which dance evolved 
from a communal rite to a form of self-expres- 
sion? What about the period in India, for example, 
when dance forms originally derived from martial 
arts became “performances” in their own right? 
With a touch of humour, the anthropologist 
Johann Kealiinohomoku refers to classical ballet as 
“a kind of ethnic dance”. Ballet became popular in 
France under Louis XIV, who set up the first royal 
dance academy in the West. Indeed the king him- 
self danced in public until 1670. The matrix of 
artistic dance, ballet also opened a new vista for cul- 
tural exchange, with Italian opera troupes visiting 
France in the 17th century. But it was not until the 
start of the 20th century, with the break ushered in 
by the birth of modern dance, that this art form 
espoused influences from much farther afield. 
An insatiable curiosity for universal and spiritual 
forms of expression inspired the work of American 
choreographer and dancer Ruth Saint-Denis whose 
passion for Oriental dance was first sparked by a 
cigarette poster of an Egyptian goddess. Her famous 
Egypt, Greece and India which she performed 
across the United States in 1916 was a mix of pyr- 
rhic dances, scenes from the banks of the Nile and 
the Ganges and evocations of nirvana. Another of 
her famous compatriots, Isadora Duncan, the high 
priestess of “barefoot dance”, sought to liberate the 
body from the straitjackets of the past by conjuring 
up an imaginary version of ancient Greece. 
4 2 The UNesco Courier - October 1999 
This search for “truth” of the body continued 
to grow throughout the 20th century, with constant 
exchanges between “here” and “elsewhere” in a 
dialogue first between the United States and 
Europe and then with the Orient. In London in 
1916, the Japanese dancer Michio Ito created a 
modern version of a traditional Japanese nd 
drama, At the Hawk’s Well, with the Irish poet 
W.B.Yeats. Another Japanese dancer, Takaya 
Eguchi, came to Germany to learn from the legen- 
dary Mary Wigman and then returned to his 
homeland to add a new dimension to modern 
expressive dance. 
In Paris, colonial exhibitions introduced the 
publicto Javanese, Kurdish, Persian and Armenian 
dancers. After World War 11, this cultural exchange 
and intermingling resumed with a new dynamic. 
From the late 1970s, the spectacular rise of modern 
dance owed much to the seeds sown by German, 
American and Japanese dancers and teachers. 
France was a meeting point. Some of the lea- 
ding figures in the French dance world were 
foreign—among them Americans Susan Buirge 
and Mark Tompkins, Hideyuki Yano of Japan, 
Hungarian Joseph Nadj, the Afro-American Elsa 
Wolliaston and Angelin Preljocaj of Albanian 
origin. The impact of the movement was felt to 
varying degrees all over Europe. 
Today Europe and North America have lost 
their choreography monopoly as enthusiastic 
young audiences around the world throng to see 
new forms of artistic expression. Dance is increa- 
singly nomadic in character. The dancer travels yet 
works within his or her own space, while some 
choreographers go so far asto see the stage as a 
“fragment of mental space”. JM.A m 
» reographers, Jean-Claude Gallotta and 
Hervé Robbe, went to set up a troupe in 
Japan, where the American Susan Buirge 
joined with a Shinto priest and an expert in 
gagaku music to create a four-part produc- 
tion based on the agricultural seasons. Clara 
Andermatt from Lisbon works with Cape 
Verdean dancers, and Susane Linke from 
Germany is putting together a show with 
Senegalese dancers. There is no shortage of 
other examples. 
Miniature multinationals 
Dance companies are miniature multi- 
nationals. The Tanztheater of Wuppertal 
(Germany) run by Pina Bausch includes 
people from ten countries, whose national 
traits find pride of place in her productions. 
TheTanztheater creates pieces all over the 
world these days. Two Burkinabé dancers 
joined the Choreography Centre in Mont- 
pellier (southern France) while retaining 
links with their country. One of them, Salia 
Sanou,had just completed his law studies 
and passed the exam to become a police 
inspector when he was invited to 
France.“In 1991, you couldn’t make a 
living from dance in Ouagadougou,” he 
said of Burkina Faso’s capital. “I was trai- 
ned in African styles by the older men in 
the village but I never imagined I could 
make a career of it or that I could dance in 
silence, without music. Abroad, I discove- 
red the music inside me.” 
In Burkina Faso, Sanou and his col- 
league Seydou Boro created a piece called 
Signinto, which won a prize at the 1998 
Luanda Festival. Both dream of opening 
together a choreography centre in Ouaga- 
dougou, where studios but not dancers are 
lacking. 
“The challenge for me is how to bring 
my culture and my experiences to other 
people so they resonate even more with 
their cultures without making modern 
dance too cerebral,” says Deroure in Dur- 
ban.He would like to move towards a kind 
of language encompassing these different 
cultures. 
“Everywhere,especially in Latin Ame- 
rica, our generation is more and more of 
mixed background and the next will be even 
more so,” says Navas in Montreal. “We're 
opening up to the world and exchanging 
things more than ever before.” 
Yet does this mixing process risk homo- 
genizing or watering down creativity?“ Abso- 
lutely not,” says Sola. “Tradition without crea- 
tion is sterile. In dance as in other artistic 
fields, transplanting one country’s traditions 
to another doesn’t work, except for a few eth- 
nology enthusiasts. Modern dance can only 
be creation and innovation.” u

PHOTOJOURNALISM: 
THE LAST LAP? 
+ Edgar Roskis 
  
Supply of photo reports outstrips demand, competition from television is intense. 
Can photojournalism survive? 
Il T he famous picture of the distraught 
woman in Algiers being comforted by 
a friend (left) may well be the last 
still photograph to have been printed on 
front pages all over the world. On the 
day it was taken, September 23, 1997,the 
Agence France Presse photographer 
Hocine was the only photographer or 
cameraman on the scene. Another equally 
celebrated and fairly recent agency photo 
(below) shows a young man singlehan- 
dedly blocking an advancing column of 
tanks in Beijing on June 4, 1989 during 
the Chinese student movement. It was 
taken in quite different circumstances. 
The top photo, taken by a press photo- 
grapher working for an agency, is unique. 
The Chinese protester, on the other hand, 
was photographed in virtually identical 
shots taken by three photographers working 
for three leading agencies (Associated Press, 
Magnum and Sipa-Presse) as well as by a 
cameraman from Britain’s Independent 
Television News (ITN).

may ask, since the impact of both photos is 
strong? The answer is that an exclusive 
photo, what journalists call “a scoop”, can be 
hawked around to the highest bidder world- 
wide and earn many thousands of dollars. 
This can’t happen when similar photos have 
been taken by several photographers. If the

than on a picture-by-picture basis (see box

capture a moment have encapsulated infor- 
mation and symbolism in a single aesthetic 
object? Perhaps not. In 1967, Frenchman 
Raymond Depardon and British photo- 
grapher Don McCullin were the only mem- 
bers of their profession covering the war in 
Biafra.l In 1994, several hundred photo- 
graphers descended on Rwanda in aircraft 
chartered for military-humanitarian pur- 
poses. Good-bye to the exclusive photo. 
What’s more, these photographers arrived 
three months after the genocide began on 
April 6 and could only send back depres- 
singly similar pictures of the aftermath of the 
tragedy—the exodus and the epidemics, 
not the event that sparked them off. 
Exponential growth 
Photography is widely considered to 
have been invented in 1839. Since then the 
number of photographic images has grown 
exponentially. It is increasingly hard, des- 
pite photographers’skills, to come up with 
a picture that doesn’t echo an earlier one. 
Because of the laws of supply and demand 
this has led to the situation in which increa- 
sing output of news pictures goes hand in 
hand with a decrease in the price they fetch. 
Does a photo—a silent image, with a 
brief caption or no caption at all—have 
any intrinsic meaning? Imagine a shot of a 
horseman who is caught by the camera 
whipping his horse. Is he a coward fleeing 
the enemy or is he charging bravely forward? 
It all depends, of course, on the caption that 
goes with the picture and its credibility. 
Take the example of the photos that

4 4 The Unesco Courier - October 1999 
 
PHOTOJOURNALISM: HOW IT WORKS 
ere are three kinds of photojournalism. The 
Ti and oldest kind relies on individual free- 
lance photographers who come up with ideas, 
shoot a feature and then offer it to various media, 
mostly magazines and sometimes daily papers, 
for publication. In some cases the media will com- 
mission them to produce a report in line with their 
special interest or skills. 
The second kind comprises groups of photo- 
graphersworking in an agency. The oldest and most 
prestigious agency is Magnum, which wasfounded 
in 1945 and is the only agency run as a photogra- 
phers’ co-operative. Gamma, set up in 1967 by Ray- 
mond Depardon and his associates, is another 
famous agency. Sygma and Sipa-Presse were 
founded later. All these agenciesare based in Paris. 
Their way of paying photographers and hence their 
working methods are radically changing. The agency 
and the photographer consult with the editors of a 
client publication before a job, and usually split the   
cost of the assignment as well as the potential pro- 
fits originating from publications which negotiate 
reproduction fees on a case-by-case basis. They 
keep the copyright to all their photos. This 50-50 
agreement has revolutionized major assignments. 
The third kind of photojournalism is done by the 
big news agencies—Associated Press (American), 
Reuters (British) and Agence France Presse (French) 
—which are often known as wire services. The 
media pay subscriptions to the agencies for unli- 
mited use of agency photos and news. 
News agency photographers are on a regular 
salary, and like most agency journalists their names 
are not widely known. They are paid at a fixed rate 
irrespective of the sales of their photos. Recently, 
international photofeature agencies such as 
Gamma, Sygma and Sipa-Presse have also put 
some of their photographers on fixed salaries. The 
turnover of each of these three international agen- 
cies is nearly $20 million a year. [|   
were long thought to show the “Vel’d’'Hiv” 
stadium in Paris at the time when French 
Jews were held there for deportation in July 
1942.2 Now we know that they show a mee- 
ting held two years later. And what should 
we make of the photo analysed by French 
philosopher Régis Debray in his book L'Oeil 
najf (“The Naive Eye”) showing a group of 
Parisian strollers looking nonchalantly at a 
bus with an open rear platform ?T he scene 
appears banal, except when we know that 
the packed bus was taking Jews to the inter- 
nment camp at Drancy, outside Paris. 
Herein lies one of the overriding weak- 
nesses of photojournalism and of photo- 
graphy in general, described by the Ger- 
many philosopher Walter Benjamin as 
“The image in an age when it can be tech- 
nically reproduced”. “I'm just an image, 
nothing more,” is all it says to us. 
Despite this drawback, a number of pho- 
tos have had a decisive effect on public opi- 
nion and changed the course of history. One 
notable example is the photo of the naked 
girl running away from the Vietnamese vil- 
lage of Trang Bang which had just been 
bombed by mistake with napalm by South 
Vietnamese aircraft on June 8, 1972. It was 
taken by a Vietnamese AP photographer, 
Nick Ut. Another,dating from four years 
earlier and showing Saigon police chief 
2. More than 12,000 French Jews were rounded 
up on July 16 and 17, 1942,and taken to the 
Vélodrome d’Hiver stadium (the Vel’ d’Hiv’) in 
Paris. From there, most of them were taken to a 
transit camp in the suburb of Drancy, and then 
sent to German concentration camps. 
Nguyen Loan shooting dead a “suspect” at 
point-blank range, was taken by Eddie 
Adams, an American working for AP.3 A 
third shows the naked body of an Ameri- 
can soldier being dragged through the 
streets of Mogadishu. It humiliated the Uni- 
ted States and turned U.S. public opinion 
against the presence of American troops in 
Somalia. 
The strength and the weakness of pho- 
tojournalism stem from its capacity to 
trigger a sudden earthquake in public 
opinion—provided that the world’s maga- 
zines and daily newspapers get hold of the 
photo and circulate it. But this key role 
has now been taken over by television. 
Even if screened images are often less 
sharp than many famous still photos, 
television gives them added weight and 
viewer interest via sound, commentary 
and in some cases on-the-spot reporting. 
‘Telepresence’ 
From an aesthetic viewpoint, photo- 
graphy is every bit as good as television

again and again, whereas the televised

good television report has a didactic advan-

events. Since the 1960s, television sets

are fine craftsmanship, the courage of the 
photographer and the high level of skill 
required to capture a unique moment, not 
a second too late or too early. 
What French writer Jean-Louis Weiss- 
berg calls “telepresence” has swept away the 
era of printed magazines. Even the most 
prestigious magazines no longer shape 
public opinion, except on very rare occa- 
sions. What Debray calls the “videosphere” 
has taken over “hot news”, leaving photo- 
journalism to a few independent photo- 
graphers who have a hard time getting their 
work published. 
So is photojournalism on its last legs? 
Perhaps not, but to use a metaphor from 
athletics maybe it’s on the last lap. The big 
photo agencies such as Gamma, Sygma 
and Sipa-Presse (see box on facing page) 
have been forced to turn to areas out- 
side journalism, like illustrating books, 
dictionaries and encyclopaedias, working 
for the communications departments of 
public and semi-public institutions, pho- 
tographing the tempestuous lives of cele- 
brities, or even doing plain laboratory 
work.Celebrity photos accounted for 60 
per cent of Sygma’s turnover before it 
was taken over two years ago, while news 
photos earned less than 10 per cent. 
These agencies are now so economi- 
cally weakened that they are easy prey for 
outside investors. A major investment group 
looking to break into the field can buy out 
a famous photo agency and gain far more 
than a network of photographers and a 
stock of photos. It can also acquire a pres- 
tigious name which is worth far more than 
the financial costs of the takeover. 
Banks took a sizeable stake in Gamma 
in 1997. More importantly, mega-compa- 
nies such as Bill Gates’ Microsoft and its 
databank Corbis have been especially active 
in trying to get their hands on major photo 
archives. In June 1999, Corbis bought 
Sygma, whose photos by its salaried staff are 
all free of copyright. These photos can be 
reproduced ad infinitum, without bringing 
any royalties to the photographers who took 
them.T hese companies can draw freely on 
such huge archives to obtain low-cost illus- 
trations for their multimedia activities or else 
re-sell these pictures far more cheaply than 
others on the market, even if they are dated. 
Wire services 
“It’s hard to tell the difference these 
days between a fresh news picture taken 
at great expense and a much cheaper 
photo that has come from an archive,” 
says Roger Thérond,former head of the 
French weekly magazine Paris-M atch. In 
fact too much photojournalism is killing 
photojournalism, just as too many taxes 
kill taxation. The fact remains,however, 
that the death of the written press has 
been predicted for the past twenty years 
yet it is still alive—and abundantly illus- 
trated.So how do things really stand? 
Perhaps the past has caught up with us. 
The gatekeepers of photojournalism did 
not emerge overnight. In 1903, French 
engineer Edouard Belin invented a machine 
which could transmit photos by telephone 
from one place to another, like sending a 
fax today. T he machine enabled all the worl- 
d’s daily newspapers to receive pictures in 
“real time” for publication the next day. 
“Wire services” such as Associated Press, 
Reuters and Agence France Presse were set 
up to serve as communications networks 
and feed the media pictures via this pro- 
cess. 
These agencies, now virtually the sole 
players in news photography, continue to 
cover world events alongside the big tele- 
vision networks. The hundreds of workers 
on their staff would claim to be simply 
“doing a job”. Most newspapers are satis- 
fied with what they produce. Meanwhile, 
photojournalism in the strict sense—tel- 
ling a story with still photos—is now the pre- 
serve of a handful of talented artists. ®

### 117440: Manuel Castells: the citizen versus the machine

MANUEL CASTELLS: 
THE CITIZEN VERSUS 
THE MACHINE 
As the technological revolution revolutionizes economic life and communications and shakes 
industrial society to its foundations, a noted Spanish sociologist asks where the citizen stands 
in the emerging ‘information society’ 
The most recent meeting of the G8 group 
(the world’s eight leading industrial powers) 
decided for the first time that globalization 
needed to be “humanized”. Does that mean 
it's inhuman right now? 
It’s very human and very creative in 
the eyes of the strong and very inhuman 
for the weak. It creates unprecedented 
polarization. 
A third of the world’s population has 
substantially raised its standard of living 
and expanded its cultural and technologi- 
cal resources. The other side of the coin is 
that the latest UNDP Human Development 
Report showed a massive growth in both 
inequality and poverty as well as social 
exclusion and marginalization all over the 
world, with a few big exceptions including 
India, China and Chile. 
Forty per cent of the planet’s popula- 
tion lives in misery on less than two dol- 
lars a day. Within this category, a growing 
number live in extreme poverty, especial- 
ly cultural poverty. No one in this plight 
can make any use of the emerging infor- 
mation society. So “humanizing” globali- 
zation means harnessing all the enormous 
creative might of the new technologies, of 
new economic productivities and of 
worldwide communication through the 
Internet so that it benefits people outside 
the most advanced, educated and sophis- 
ticated sectors of the most powerful coun- 
tries. But for the moment, this is just a 
pipe dream. We're told we have to do 
things differently, but the effects of such 
discrimination are still not being correc- 
ted. In fact quite the opposite is happe- 
ning. 
Does this discrimination match the divide 
between so-called “generic labour” and “self- 
programmable labour”? 
Not entirely. Self-programmable

labour has enough information, educa- 
tion and culture to adapt to constantly 
changing technological and professional 
conditions. But in a system which has 
become purely based on the individual, 
without any social safety net or solidarity, 
belonging to this category doesn’t mean 
you're invulnerable: if a major incident 
occurs, such as a physical or psychologi-

of a job on the grounds that he 
or she isn’t productive enough. 
cal illness or a family crisis, you find your- 
self on the other side of the fence. Many 
middle-class children, for example, start 
taking drugs between the age of 18 and 
20 and end up in prison, thus heading 
right down the path to social exclusion. 
Generic labour refers to workers who, 
because they don’t have a specific qualifi- 
cation and an adequate level of education 
and culture, cannot fit into the predomi- 
nant system of production—machines 
can or could replace them. Within this 
category, there are two groups. There are 
those who are still relatively protected, 
who keep their jobs because they work in 
institutions or live in countries that help 
and protect them, and guarantee a decent 
standard of living. There are also those 
who live either in run-down city suburbs 
in rich countries or in poverty-stricken 
regions and nations without the infra- 
structure or companies that make pos- 
sible and guarantee a transition towards 
the information society. Such people are 
totally excluded. That social exclusion 
comes from lack of work. 
Why do you say capitalism is much more 
brutal today than it was in the past? 
Because it’s broken the social 
contract. These days, networks mean you 
can connect everything that carries value 
for this dominant system, thus making 
those connected to it extremely dynamic. 
But this structure also means that any- 
thing for which it has little regard—indi- 
viduals, regions, sectors and companies— 
don’t get connected and are thereby 
condemned.And since it manages to take 
control of anything which could be of 
value to it, capitalism can afford to be 
extremely choosy and to impose its own 
rules. This is helped by the fact that states 
and institutions, political or para-politi- 
cal, which acted as a counterweight 
during the Industrial Revolution, have 
very little influence over worldwide com- 
munications, capital movements, techno- 
logical development and production. 
Might is right, a purely Darwinian logic. 
Is anyone exempt from this logic? 
In a way, it takes root independently of 
a company’s will and those who resist are 
crushed by competition because the net- 
works consist only of the strong. And it 
takes root inside the firms themselves, 
independent of managers or outside share- 
holders. Look at advanced capitalism in 
Silicon Valley which, incidentally, embo- 
dies in a sense the 1960s Marxist ideal of 
workers’ management. The people who 
work in Silicon Valley are paid to a large 
extent in shares rather than a regular sala-

ry. So it’s in their interest to push their way 
up in the firm, even if it means kicking a 
colleague out of a job on the grounds that 
he or she isn’t productive enough. 
Does this illustrate a trend which you 
emphasize, namely the extraordinary 
individualization of people’s destinies? 
Setting aside current myths about the 
impact of the new techno-economic sys- 
tem on jobs, usually measured in terms of 
falling unemployment, the fundamental 
change lies in the greater flexibility of 
labour relations. The way companies ope- 
rate in networks—both internal and 
external—is destroying the notion of a 
stable, reliable job which dates from the 
Industrial Revolution. 
In Britain, the birthplace of that revo- 
lution, 55 per cent of the workforce is 
involved in various kinds of temporary, 
part-time or freelance work. The traditio- 
nal model of organized labour is no longer 
the rule. The same thing is happening in 
cities in poor countries, which are beco- 
ming more and more urbanized. T here the 
so-called informal economy holds sway 
and labour relations revolve round the 
long-term lack of stable and regular work. 
Economic activity in such countries can be 
quite primitive but some of it is very 
advanced. 
Whether we like it or not, job flexibili- 
ty is so much more efficient than previous 
arrangements that firms which still opera- 
te with a mainly salaried workforce and 
stable and established working methods 
are doomed to failure by the laws of com- 
petition. Firms are also relying more and 
more on a core of skilled workers they

want to keep (and to whom they give 
stable jobs) and on a huge mass of tempo- 
rary and sub-contracted workers. What we 
have is an individualization of the relation- 
ship between salaried workers and firms 
on one side and among self-employed wor- 
kers on the other. Everybody sub- 
contracts with everybody else. 
But this trend introduces a totally unequal 
balance of power between workers and 
companies. . . . 
Yes, but also between workers them- 
selves. The strongest have real bargaining 
power in the market, depending on what 
they can contribute to their own or any

think international organizations like UNESCO 
have a really important part to play. They can 
be a link between governments which are still, 
after all, political instruments, and demands based 
on people’sideals, especially in the fields of deve- 
lopment and peace. 
So they must be meeting-places but, increa- 
singly, also forums which give rise to practical 
projects. For example, everyone agrees education 
isthe key to reducing inequality and exclusion. But 
what exactly does education mean? What must be 
done on a world scale so the kind of education 
needed reaches the two-thirds of humanity who 
currently have no access to it? The response must 
indeed come from governments. But UNESCO is 
the very kind of organization within which a world 
education strategy can be drawn up. 
Bodies like the International Monetary Fund, 
the World Bank or the G8 group of countries are 
managing systems of worldwide exchanges but 
they concentrate on technological innovation, 
economic productivity and growth of informa- 
tion. Their power must be balanced by interna- 
tional organizations like UNEscO , the World Health 
Organization and the International Labour Orga- 
nisation, which could draw up a new world social 
and cultural contract, asthe other bodies did for 
economics and technology. But they will only 
succeed in this if they acquire similar legitimacy 
and authority by using the might of the networks.

other firm. The unskilled don’t have such 
power or any real power of collective bar- 
gaining through trade unions. In the now- 
dominant private sector, unions these 
days have only a meagre role and union 
membership is steadily falling. This is why 
we must resist shrinking the social securi- 
ty safety-net and support a transition 
from protecting individuals who work 
(the situation in most countries) to pro- 
tecting people whether they work or not. 
You paint a very gloomy picture. . . . 
Saying that these changes only lead to 
social exclusion isn’t the whole story. 
They are extremely useful for very many 
people—the worldwide image- and opi- 
nion-makers. This is not a small elite or

cent of the population in countries like 
the United States and France belong to it.

only for economic but also social, intel- 
lectual and cultural creativity. As well as 
generating social exclusion, the technolo- 
gical revolution has creative and libera- 
ting aspects that we should not ignore. 
Such as? 
The Internet has reduced the power 
of governments and the big media mono- 
polies to control people. One result is 
more openness, especially where political 
corruption is concerned. The powerful 
are used to spying on ordinary citizens, 
but now citizens can spy on the powerful. 
Work can be more independent and pro- 
fessional advancement more varied. We 
don’t have to stay stuck for life in the 
same bureaucracy and only advance 
through seniority. The educational level of 
women 1s rising to an extraordinary 
extent (most university graduates in the 
U.S. are now women, for example).Their 
professional advance is continuing. 
Discrimination is still there, but it’s 
dwindling. It’s better than being shut 
away at home. 
One of the main points of your work 
is that the information society seems 
to harbour the seeds of opposition to itself. 
How is that? 
The process is very complex. The 
modern state—whether liberal, socialist 
or Marxist—has been built on a denial of 
basic and historical identities. The state 
made the nation, not the other way 
round. But it also managed to fuse these 
original identities into a new abstract 
4 8 The Unesco Courier - October 1999 
identity which it called citizenship. And it 
protected its citizens. But globalization 
means the state can no longer guarantee 
such protection or provide the meaning 
necessary to foster citizenship. 
Two reactions are possible to the buil- 
ding of an information society which 
gives pride of place to competition. For 
the strongest, those with money and 
power, competition can give purpose to 
their lives if they develop a totally indivi- 
dualistic, even narcissistic and consume- 
rist identity, becoming big earners and big 
spenders. All networked societies are basi- 
cally individualistic. It’s the liberal and 
libertarian ideology of the dominant tech- 
nical and economic elite. 
But all around them, a whole mass of 
people either lack the resources to 
connect to this individualism or else reject 
it. They give meaning to their lives by 
building community identities. They 
build them on cultural practices which 
express simple, sturdy values, such as 
God, country, ethnic identity, land and 
family. This makes them feel protected in 
some way against the worldwide changes 
over which they have lost all control. 
But these identities are ambivalent. . . . 
They can be open because they're 
engaged in dialogue with people who have 
other identities. But they can be dogmatic 
when expressed in a rigid, inward-looking 
way which shuts out all other identities. 
That’s the crux of the problem: everybo- 
dy can’t be Argentine or Serb, Catholic or 
Muslim, female or homosexual, so the 
strong affirmation of a unique identity as 
A MONUMENTAL WORK 
he publication of Manuel Castells’ monumental 
Tor, about information technology and the 
global economy, The Information Age: Economy, 
Society and Culture, attracted wide attention and 
superlatives from reviewers impressed by the eru- 
dition and breadth of this “encyclopaedic work”. 
Castells’ aims might indeed seem grandiose. He 
says he wants to “understand our world” —all of it—to 
try to “give meaning to what appears to us today as 
terrible chaos.” In the last quarter of a century, he says, 
“a technological revolution—inform ation technology— 
has transformed our ways of thinking, consuming, 
buying and selling, running businesses, communi- 
cating, living, dying, making war and making love.” 
He explains why and how these processes have 
come about in three volumes of over 300 pages 
each, the result of 12 years’ interdisciplinary 
research which took him all over the world. He 
says the structure of industrial society—its econo- 
mies, political units, industrial complexes and cul- 
tural identities—always revolved round central 
points but that these are now disappearing. In 
what he calls the “informational society,” a system 
of networks develops in every sector. “The power 
of flows overwhelms the flows of power,” he says.   
Such iconoclasm is the product of an unusual 
intellectual journey. In 1962, the 20-year-old Cas- 
tells, “a shade Marxist but not Leninist” and to a far 
greater extent “anarchist and libertarian”, left his 
native Spain to study in France. He was expelled 
from France in May 1968 but returned two years 
later. 
By chance, he gravitated towards urban socio- 
logy and became one of its leading exponents. His 
La Question urbaine (1972) was translated into 10 
languages, and The City and the Grassrootswon the 
C. Wright Mills Prize in 1983 for the best social 
science book published in the United Sates. Today 
he is professor of sociology and city and regional 
planning at the Center for Western European Stu- 
dies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
A friendly and persuasive man, with an impish 
sense of irony, Castells refuses to act the guru and 
points out that his work has limits. “Every time an 
intellectual has tried to answer the question ‘what 
should we do? it's led to disaster,” he says. = 
1. The 3 volumes, published by Blackwell, Oxford, UK, 
are: The Rise of the Network Society (1996), The Power of 
Identity (1997) and End of Millennium (1998).

the only way to give meaning to one’s life 
leads to fragmentation into tribes, to a 
sort of collective atomization. 
The only answer to this major threat is 
to build bridges between these very diffe- 
rent identities. The main challenge for the 
state is to establish not only a political 
contract between citizens but a cultural 
contract so that all these cultural codes 
and multiple identities can communicate 
with each other. Only with such a 
contract can a state guarantee the coexis- 
tence of these identities while recognizing 
their individual expression. But in view of 
the state’s historical mode of construc- 
tion, it is ill equipped to do this. 
In view of this dual threat of exclusion and 
fragmentation, how can a shared awareness 
develop and lead to global political action? 
This is the key question and I don’t 
have an answer. I've based my work on 
observation, which isn’t forecasting. What 
I see is a lot of resistance to the grip of the 
network system. Some of these networks 
no longer obey any human logic whatsoe- 
ver: they have become what I would des-

cribe as automata. 
The best example is the world finan- 
cial market. It controls everything and no 
one controls it, not even governments. 
First, it pools together money from all 
kinds of origins, not just financiers’ 
money but everyone’s, including our own 
(in the form of savings or pension funds). 
Computer programmes and electrical cir- 
cuits then keep it constantly moving 
around. Finally, and above all, it obeys 
rules which are only partly economic, 
because what I call information turbulen- 
ce plays a crucial part. Various players, 
including political players, send messages 
and create images which lead a multitude 
of other players to react in the financial 
market. But they don’t act in concert and 
no one can say for sure how the market 
  
I ou

will react. Many players, some more 
powerful than others, can thus influence 
the world in which these financial tran- 
sactions take place.They can follow stra- 
tegies, but nobody can control the process 
or the outcome of the game. An automa- 
ton has been created. 
So what happens to politics? 
Today politics are not defined by the 
media but within media space, which is 
occupied by the countless and ever more 
varied television stations and, increasin- 
gly, the Internet.So what comes into poli- 
tical existence—in other words what 
forms into a political opinion in people’s 
minds—depends solely on what appears 
in the media. Traditional political stake- 
holders are adapting to this new media 
context. But they don’t play leading roles 
in it at all. They’ve been joined by a mass 
of lobbies, interest groups and professio- 
nal organizations which specialize in crea- 
ting and manipulating messages and 
images. T hese groups create new informa- 
tion turbulence, which stems from their 
determined strategies and how indepen- »

dent the media are. But the final political 
result—the impact on decisions citizens 
take—has no relation to the wishes of each 
of the players. It’s the “automatic” result of 
interactions that nobody can control. 
How do people react to this “automatism”? 
I’ve noticed they do two things. First, 
they vote to express their opposition.The 
main changes brought about by elec- 
tions—caused by shifts of mood among 
only 5-10 per cent of voters—are the 
result of opposition to a past event or 
decision, not of support for a future poli- 
cy. Such protest votes show that citizens 
feel on the defensive to wards the political 
system. Secondly, they rate the system’s 
players right at the bottom of the league 
table of what they respect in society. They 
think they're corrupt, expensive and inef- 
ficient.As a result, more and more people 
are ceasing to see politics as a way of 
changing their lives. 
What about those who do want to change 
things? 
Our generation has been convinced 
that the state is the main instrument for 
 
applying a political programme which 
meets the expectations and needs of civil 
society. But what can the state do today 
faced with the financial machine and the 
media machine? It has extremely limited 
room for manoeuvre. People who want to 
change things or do more in life than just 
earn money are developing a new way of 
conducting politics, this time without any 
mediation from the state. They have come 
to act politically by taking pragmatic ethi- 
cal action, working to bring about real 
change in a small geographical area, at a 
specific time or in a limited field. Of cour- 
se such an approach only brings about very 
small changes in comparison with all the 
changes that are necessary, but at least it’s 
effective. It’s a practical policy designed to 
bring immediate results. Successful 
examples of this approach include NGOs 
like Doctors of the World and the Jubilee 
2000 movement, which has achieved sub- 
stantial results in its campaign to alleviate 
the debt burden on the poorest countries. 
Can such a piecemeal policy make a dent in 
this big issue? 
My bet is that all these piecemeal and

isolated activities,which involve hundreds 
of thousands of people, will gradually 
come together to form networks. I hope 
the growth of networks will eventually 
include those which want to fight the 
harmful effects of other networks. That 
alongside the networks of money, techno- 
logy and information, alternative but just 
as powerful (and so just as efficient) net- 
works will develop and convey alternative 
values that will steadily build new global 
political strategies. 
But some fundamental trends are 
emerging even before we reach this final 
stage. Look at the women’s movement. It

revolution in human history without 
using traditional political means. 
However, the changes in cultural prac-

minds, were so far-reaching that they've 
now been incorporated into political sys- 
tems, at least where those systems are 
dynamic and democratic. L
