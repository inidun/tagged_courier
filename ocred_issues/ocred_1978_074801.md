The German painter Albrecht Durer (born in Nuremberg in 1471) had already won international 
renown by the beginning of the 16th century, when great Renaissance artists throughout Europe 
acclaimed his originality and genius. A prolific engraver and draughtsman, Direr was also a 
passionate observer of the natural world. “Verily art is embedded in nature,’’ he wrote, ‘and he who 
can extract it is an artist.” This watercolour of a jay’s wing is one of many studies that reveal Diirer's 
astonishing skill at turning nature into art.

### 45895: Flight without frontiers: 75 years after the Wright brothers, the International Civil Aviation Organization celebrates its 30th anniversary

Flight 
without frontiers 
75 years after the Wright brothers, 
the International Civil Aviation Organization 
celebrates its 30th anniversary 
by Yves Lambert 
Secretary-General of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization 
N 17 December 1903 in North Caro- 
O lina, U.S.A., a frail structure of 
metal, wood and fabric struggled 
into the air and precariously managed to 
remain airborne for 260 metres. Thanks to 
the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, 
man had succeeded for the first time in 
flying a heavier-than-air, engine-powered 
machine. 
The date is generally considered Year | in 
the history of aviation. From the beginning, 
however, the conquest of the air was inter- 
national and exploits were scored simulta- 
neously all over the world. 
 
YVES LAMBERT, French civil aviation engi 
neer, has been Secretary-General of the Interna- 
tional Civil Aviation Organization (ICAQ) since 
1976. He formerly represented France on the 
ICAQ Council. 
 
EE tr] 
     
The Frenchman Clément Ader and the 
Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont were 
experimenting with flying machines at the 
same time as the Wright brothers. The first 
international flights were by the Frenchman 
Louis Blériot who crossed the Channel in 
1909 and the Dutchman Wijnmalen who 
managed a Paris-Brussels round trip in 
1910. 
Their single seater planes flying at less 
than 100 km. per hour were the not-so- 
distant ancestors of today's jets which are 
so much a part of our daily life that they no 
longer evoke interest, much less wonder, 
on the part of the public. 
During the last 30 years, the transatlantic 
flight has been cut from 17 to 3 hours, 
thanks to Concorde. The number of pas-

sengers using scheduled carriers has 
grown from 24,343,000 in 1947 to 620 mil- 
lion (including the U.S.S.R.) in 1977, 
without counting the millions of holiday- 
makers who travel all over the world on 
chartered flights. 
The ocean liners which in 1947 still car- 
ried two-thirds of the passengers across 
the North Atlantic have virtually disappear- 
ed. Aviation has become one of the major 
-means for international exchange, shatter- 
ing man's concept of time and distance and 
causing him not only to reassess his con- 
cept of geography but also to re-evaluate 
his social traditions and cultural patterns. 
No other achievement of our century has 
made such a profound impact on the lives 
of peoples everywhere as aviation. 
Yet travellers see only one facet of avia- |p 
Historic photo (left) was taken 
on 17 December 1903 at Kitty 
Hawk, North Carolina (U.S.A.) 
. when the Wright brothers, 
Wilbur and Orville, achieved the 
first powered, sustained and 
controlled flight of a heavier- 
than-air machine. {ln the 1890s, 
the French engineer Clément 
Ader succeeded in making a 
short hop in a powered plane he 
had built, but the machine was 
not capable of sustained or 
controlled flight.) Orville, lying 
prone in the middle of the lower 
wing beside the 12 HP engine, is 
at the controls of the plane 
which the Wrights designed and 
built after experimenting with . 
kites and gliders. Wilbur has 
just released the wing. The first 
flight lasted 12 seconds. On the 
4th, the machine was airborne 
for 59 secs. Today, 75 years 
later, civil aviation is a vast 
industry employing over 10 
million persons. Right, bird's

1 q 0 6 On 12 November in Paris, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont became 
the first holder of a world air speed record: 41 km. per hour. Three years 
later, Santos-Dumont produced his famous series of “Demoiselle” or 
“Grasshopper” monoplanes (above). These lightweight craft (wing span 5.10 m,; 
length 8 m.) were among the first to be used for pleasure flying. 
E

tiny monoplane (wingspan and length 8 m.) crosses the English coast 
near the end of its 37-minute Channel crossing on 25 July. A rival French aviator, 
Hubert Latham, had attempted a crossing 6 days before but engine trouble forced 
him down in mid-Channel. Below, two eras of travel and transport caught by a 
photographer on 27 July 1909 as Latham made a second gallant but unsuccessful 
attempt to fly the Channel.

tion and hardly notice all those who work 
behind the scenes to make their flight pos- 
sible. They can hardly imagine the complex 
co-ordination required to make the interna- 
tional airline network operate efficiently. 
An essential link in this chain is the Interna- 
tional Civil Aviation Organization (ICAQ), a 
United Nations specialized agency with 
headquarters in Montreal (Canada), which 
has just celebrated its 30th anniversary. 
In spite of setbacks at the beginning of 
the jet age and the changing economic 
situation, remarkable progress has been 
made, far exceeding the hopes of those 
who more than 30 years ago drafted the 
1944 Chicago Convention to ensure the 
“safe and orderly’ growth of international 
civil aviation. 
The Convention, the birth certificate of 
ICAO, has now been ratified by 141 
governments, and is the legal basis which 
made possible the multilateral agreements 
governing international air transport. The 
rapid development of international air 
transport, the opening of new routes, the 
search for new structures by carriers, 
charterers, airports and, of course, national 
administrations are the living and con- 
stantly renewed embodiments of the Chi- 
cago Convention. 
ICAO is also a technical organization, 
Aviation requires international standardiza- 
tion, for international flights would be 
unthinkable if flight procedures and equip- 
ment were not the same throughout the 
world. ICAQ acts as the international regu- 
latory agency which sets the Standards 
and Recommended, Practices for the pre- 
cise and detailed characteristics and 
performances of both airborne and ground 
equipment. 
To be effective, these Standards and 
Recommended Practices must be imple- 
mented. This is why ICAO establishes 
regional air navigation plans which define 
all the essential international air navigation 
facilities and services in the various regions 
of the world. 
Thus, when taking a plane, whether for 
the longest scheduled -non-stop flight 
—10,876 km. from Tokyo to New York --or 
for one of the shortest hops—27 km. bet- 
ween Copenhagen and Malmo—the pas- 
senger boards an aircraft which has a certi- 
ficate of airworthiness issued in accor- 
dance with ICAQ regulations. 
During the flight the aircraft crew suc- 
cessively contacts various area contro! cen- 
tres, using ICAQ radio procedures. Finally, 
the aircraft will be guided by an ICAO ins- 
trument landing system, whether touching 
down in London or Bujumbura in the heart 
of Africa. 
The aeroplane has overcome many natu- 
ral obstacles, such as mountains, oceans 
and deserts. In recent years, however, air 
passengers have become concerned about

### 45895: Flight without frontiers: 75 years after the Wright brothers, the International Civil Aviation Organization celebrates its 30th anniversary

a new threat. Faced with the rising number 
of unlawful seizures of aircraft and with 
acts of terrorism against passengers, air- 
craft and aviation facilities, the internatio- 
nal community has reacted in two ways. A 
complete international legal system has 
been worked out in the form of three con- 
ventions signed in Tokyo, The Hague and 
Montreal. ICAO has strengthened these 
legal instruments with technical measures 
that have been circulated to all contracting 
states. (See page 22}. 
ICAO is not only concerned with the 
interests of air transport users. For some 
years now, it has also been active in the 
field of environment by introducing mea- 
sures to limit aircraft noise. In 1971, the 
ICAO Council adopted a set of standards 
on aircraft noise which were incorporated 
in Annex 16 of the Chicago Convention. 
These standards are becoming progres- 
sively more stringent for the latest aircraft. 
(See page 9). 
Today the world is also concerned with 
pollution caused by exhaust fumes from 
cars, trucks and aircraft. Although it is 
generally agreed that aircraft are little to 
blame, it is nevertheless essential to es- 
tablish the facts. 
A first step in this direction involves 
drawing up international specifications for 
measuring polluting agents from all 
sources, including aviation. For this pur- 
pose ICAO is co-operating with other inter- 
national organizations, such as the 
World Health Organization and the World 
Meteorological Organization. 
Air law is a new branch of international 
law compared with maritime law, which 
enjoys a long tradition. ICAQ’s task is to 
codify international air law, taking into 
account different legal concepts and 
systems of jurisprudence, to draft conven- 
tions on various aspects of international air 
law, and to try to obtain their ratification. 
So far, ICAO has prepared eight conven- 
tions covering such widely different areas 
as international recognition of the right of 
ownership of aircraft, damage caused to 
third parties on the ground, the liability of 
the air carrier towards passengers, offen- 
ces committed on board aircraft and acts of 
unlawful interference with civil aviation. 
While ICAO does not set fares and does 
not apportion air routes to the different air- 
lines, its role is neverthless essential in the 
development of air transport. 
There has been much talk about disorder 
in the air transport market and about 
unbridled competition on certain air routes. 
However, this market is governed by bilat- 
eral agreements and the price of tickets is 
fixed by the airline tariff conferences, sub- 
ject to government approval. ICAQO’s role 
with regard to the economic aspects of air 
transport has so far been limited to collec- 
ting and publishing statistical information 
and economic studies which can be used

1919 An era of pioneering long-distance flights began on 15 June 
when British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown 
landed in Ireland (above) after the first nonstop transatlantic flight (16 
hours 27 minutes from St. John’s, Newfoundland). Later that year the 
world community showed its concern to promote international co- 
operation in civil aviation: the International Air Traffic Association 
(IATA) was founded at The Hague; the League of Nations took steps to 
draw up regulations for air traffic; and on 19 October the first 
international convention on air navigation met in Paris.

Nagaoka, welcomes French aviators Costes and Le Brix to Tokyo 
during the round-the-world trip (10 October 1927-14 April 1928) on which 
they made the first nonstop flight across the South Atlantic. In the 
same year (1927) the American Charles Lindbergh made his epic solo 
flight from New York to Paris {in a machine only a little larger than the 
Wrights’ first plane). Aviation continued to make rapid advances during 
the next decade, which saw many pioneering exploits including {in June 
1937) the first nonstop flight over the North Pole from the U.S.S.R. to 
the United States. Soviet pilot Valeri Chkalov did the 9,130-km. trip in 
63 hours aboard a single-engine Tupolev aircraft.

Some of the most legendary figures of the “heroic age” of flight in the 1920s and 1930s were 
women pilots who amazed the world with their flying skills and endurance. First great 
performance by a woman aviator was due to Adrienne Bolland of France (1) shown here in 
the single-engine craft in which she crossed the Andes on 1 April 1921 in spite of strong

adverse winds and bitter cold. Many men in more powerful machines had failed to perform 
this feat. Amelia Earhart of the U.S.A. (2) was the first woman to fly the Atlantic, both asa 
passenger (1928) and as a solo pilot {on 20-21 May 1932). She played an active part in efforts 
to open aviation to women before disappearing in the Pacific in 1937 while attempt- 
ing a round-the-world flight. (3) 24-year-old New Zealander Jean Batten at Calcutta during

4 by Member States for the preparation of 
development plans. 
These activities, as well as the role of 
ICAO in co-ordinating air policies among its 
Contracting States, are far from negligible. 
They may have an even greater impact as 
the result of a special Air Transport Con- 
ference held in April 1977, the first such 
gathering in more than 30 years. {CAO is 
now entrusted with new tasks concerning 
the application of rates and fares, policy on 
chartered or non-scheduled flights, the 
regulation of capacity on international 
flights and the machinery for fixing interna- 
tional air tariffs. (1) 
ICAO is active in many other fields, in- 
cluding aviation medicine, telecommunica- 
tions, search and rescue, training films and 
manuals, and smoothing out cumbersome 
customs, immigration and public health 
formalities which impede the movement of 
people and goods. 
But among the many activities of ICAQ, 
technical assistance to developing coun- 
tries has a particularly important place. 
{See page 12). A recent study carried out in 
Africa by ICAO and the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) has 
shown how aviation can contribute to eco- 
nomic development in the Third World, 
bringing an inflow of foreign currency, 
~ creating new jobs and opening up export 
markets, 
In a world of increasingly rapid change, 
aviation is destined to become the key form 
of medium- and long-range transport. And 
as aviation expands, its problems too are 
bound to multiply. ICAO has already amply 
proved its determination to solve them. 
MH Yves Lambert 
  
(1) As an intergovernmental organization, ICAQ works 
closely with a number of non-governmental bodies 
representing various interests in international civil avia- 
tion. Among these is the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA), with headquarters both in Montreal 
and Geneva, which groups 109 scheduled airlines. Be- 
sides dealing with uniformity in fares, ticketing, hand- 
ling of baggage and freight, and with technical and legal 
matters, IATA represents the scheduled airlines at ICAO 
meetings. A major feature of IATA’s work is its clearing 
house which permits member airlines to settle pay- 
ments made all over the world in different currencies.

T rs is nothing like noise to make a 
noise. While most people don’t care 
a decibel about aircraft nuisances as 
long as they are not bothered themselves, 
the roar of planes at many airports is real 
enough for those living close by. Distant 
echoes are also heard by airline executives u [] 
and international aviation bodies concern- 
ed with safe and efficient air transport. WV : ( : - ¢ \ 
Consider these facts : || 
* Not long ago, stores, office buildings, 
schools and homes around Los Angeles 
International Airport occupied what is how 
a large swathe of open space laid bare as if 
by a giant lawn mower. These 2,800 build- by Eugene Sochor 
ings have been destroyed in the most dras- 
tic step yet taken in the United States to 
deal with the thunder and whine of jets. )

Public Information at the International Civil Avia- 
tion Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, was for 12 
years a staff member of Unesco’s press division.

) Since it was impossible to move the air- 
port, city officials decided —after more 
than $4 billion in damage suits over aircraft 
noise—to move the people instead at a 
cost of $300 million. 
* A survey of U.S. airports conducted 
recently by the Airport Operators Council 
International found $245 million in pending 
noise-related lawsuits filed against airport 
authorities in the U.S. In addition, over the 
past five years, airports have spent some 
$200 million in land acquisition program- 
mes because of noise. 
* In some schools, jets disrupt teaching. 
One junior high school near Los Angeles 
Airport had to be closed because of cons- 
tant interruption. The Airport agreed to 
pay $21 million to five local school districts 
for sound proofing. 
¢ Usual complaints of residents near air- 
ports are interrupted sleep, bad television 
reception and houses that shudder every 
few minutes. A survey indicates that peo- 
ple living close to airports suffer a higher 
incidence of nervous breakdowns than 
people living further away. 
In response to public outcry, many air- 
ports have had to cut operations at night as 
part of a growing pattern of resistance to 
aircraft noise. Wellington Airport in New 
Zealand is a good example. It is closed to 
traffic from 11 P.M. to 6 A.M. except for 
emergencies, delayed international flights 
and meteorological conditions. 
A list of major cities with some sort of 
night curfews includes: West Berlin, Bre- 
men, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, 
Geneva, Hamburg, Hong Kong, London, 
Manchester, Malmo, Montreal (Dorval), 
Munich, Nice, Oslo, Paris (Orly), Sydney, 
Stockholm, Tokyo, Toronto and Zurich. 
Internationally, the growth of local shut- 
downs has caused air carriers to alter flight 
plans and schedules, with resulting traffic 
peaks and strain on air traffic control, and 
on airport and customs facilities immedia- 
tely before or after curfews. Some interna- 
tional airports must handle as many as 500 
flights and 70,000 or more travellers a day. 
The chain reaction is also felt on stop- 
overs. Bombay International Airport, for 
instance, is completely saturated with traf- 
fic at night and deserted during the day. 
The reason is Bombay's strategic location 
between Europe and Tokyo. Most interna- 
tional flights arrive at night since they take 
off comparatively early to avoid the cur- 
fews on departure in Europe and at their 
destination points. It has been pointed out 
that if a night curfew were imposed at 
John F, Kennedy International Airport in 
New York and the summer night curfew at 
London Airport were made year round, jets 
would have only 3 hours a day to cross the 
Atlantic. 
The noise issue has also affected the 
development of new airports. As an execu- 
tive of the Airport Operators Council Inter- 
national noted recently : “No new major 
airport has been started in the U.S. since 
| 
1970. "Even relatively minor projects like 
runway extensions are being delayed, often 
for years, as citizens fight to ward off more 
noise”. 
ICAO experts who have been working on 
the problem of airport curfews in relation to 
traffic peaks think that the most that may 
be expected is some easing of the situation 
through prudent, well considered and wor- 
kable measures, These measures should 
be applied both nationally and internatio- 
nally and will require a co-ordinated inter- 
national approach. 
Action taken at airports in one country 
may affect operations half-way round the 
world. A variety of differing and inconsis- 
tent restrictions applied at random at dif- 
ferent airports in the network may prove 
disruptive to airlines and their passengers, 
to air traffic control, and to airport opera- 
tions generally. 
Responding to public concern, the last 
ICAO Assembly clearly recognized its res- 
ponsibility and that of member govern- 
ments to achieve maximum compatibility 
between the safe and orderly development 
of civil aviation and the quality of the 
human environment, 
It noted that with most jets now in ser- 
vice exceeding the noise limits set by ICAO 
for new aircraft, the noise problem in cer- 
tain areas, including many busy internatio- 
nal airports, had led to curfews and genera- 
ted strong opposition to the expansion of 
existing airports or the construction of new 
ones. The Assembly called on all states to 
recognize the role of ICAO in “aggressively 
pursuing a comprehensive programme” to 
reduce aircraft noise at its source and to 
develop effective noise abatement 
strategies. 
The whole question of aviation and envi- 
ronment is in fact one of ICAO’s major con-

cerns. It is resulting in ever-tightening 
noise limitations on aircraft, which, accor- 
ding to the ICAO Constitution, are binding 
on all contracting states. These standards 
{which are part of Annex 16 of the Chicago 
Convention on International Civil Aviation) 
aim at reducing the noise at source through 
certification of the aircraft, starting with 
future subsonic jets through production of 
current jets, propeller-driven planes, super- 
sonic transport planes and STOL (short. 
take-off and landing} aeroplanes. 
ICAO is also studying noise reduction 
requirements for existing first generation 
subsonic jets which do not meet the Annex 
16 requirements. It must, however, be 
recognized that the cost of ““hushing” or 
“retrofitting” such jets— the noisiest in the 
world’s aircraft fleet— would be exorbitant 
for most airlines. 
Airline executives also question the use- 
fulness of modifying engines with sound 
absorbing material when in fact these older 
jets are due to be replaced by the newer 
wide-body jets which do meet ICAO noise 
standards. Also, the cost of “retrofitting” 
the older planes would be passed on inevi- 
tably to the travelling public. 
Airlines have readily co-operated in 
working out procedures and route patterns 
which generate the minimum noise distur- 
bance and meet the needs of a particular 
airport. Some approach and landing pro- 
cedures to ease the noise over residential 
areas are being steadfastly opposed by 
pilot organizations as being too dangerous. 
Instead, the International Federation of Air 
Line Pilots’ Associations (IFALPA) has 
always maintained that aircraft noise abate- 
ment should be achieved by control of 
noise at its source, rather than by 
modifying aircraft operating procedures 
which may impinge on safety of opera- 
tions. 
  
The ICAO Assembly is also concerned 
with another aspect of the situation: better 
airport planning and zoning. Land in many 
countries has become a rare commodity 
keenly disputed by people and planes. A 
dramatic case in point is what a newspaper 
called: “The carrot patch standing in the 
way of Tokyo's shiny new airport”. This 
massive airport at Narita was built to ease 
congestion at Haneda airport. Its opening 
has been postponed 12 times since 1972 by 
the violent opposition of squatters, inclu- 
ding a farmer who refused to move his car- 
rot patch from under the shadow of the 
control tower, 
Quite a different story is the new Naga- 
saki Airport on Kyushu Island, the first 
“floating’’ airport in the world. It resembles 
a huge aircraft carrier. Japanese officials 
are so enthusiastic about this novel 
approach that they are also planning to 
locate the new Osaka Airport off the main- 
land in the bay of Osaka. Few countries, 
however, can be as fortunate in selecting a 
site and financing its airports as the 
sparsely-settled and oil-rich United Arab 
Emirates, which boast four international 
airports within short distances of one an- 
other. Even so, a new airport is under con- 
struction in Abu Dhabi. 
Land requirements for older airports took 
into account only the needs of the airline 
operators to move people the fastest, 
safest and most economical way. Few 
people lived around the airports anyway. 
People came to watch the new jets take off 
in a roar of excitement. But as traffic 
increased and housing developments 
moved closer to the airports, the novelty 
wore off and the problems piled up. 
The land required for airport develop- 
ment has increased dramatically as a result 
of increased numbers of flights and pas- 
sengers, volume of cargo and operating

This presentation of the noise levels caused by various means of 
transport was prepared on the basis of a diagram published by

Aviation Organization, in February 1975. Above, giant silencers

requirements of aircraft. Whereas 1,600 
hectares may have been adequate 20 years 
ago for a major international airport, some 
airports being constructed now require 
areas as large as 6,000 hectares merely to 
satisfy direct operational needs. Mirabel 
Airport servicing Montreal occupies the lar- 
gest such area in the world—7,000 hec- 
tares in its final phase and a protective 
cocoon of 27,700 hectares. The price for 
such seclusion is distance—in this case 55 
km. from the city. 
The fartner away the airport from the city 
centre, as common sense would dictate, 
the louder the outcry of travellers who 
stand to lose the time gained in air travel. 
Hence the need for fast and improved city 
to airport transportation, if necessary by 
rail or even helicopter. 
The'location, size and configuration of 
the airport must be co-ordinated with the 
patterns of residential development and 
other major land uses in the area. An ICAO 
Airport Master Planning Manual states that 
in long-range planning of airports, inclu- 
ding the expansion of existing airports, 
planners should assess the impact on the 
airport's - surrounding community. This 
necessarily involves a close relationship 
with the authorities that control the land 
around the airport. 
Like so many of man’s other machines, 
the aircraft is both a blessing and a curse. 
Its nuisances cannot be wished away. 
Perhaps the patient outlook of the writer 
and flyer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is to the 
point. If, as he wrote, we feel that the 
machine is destroying man, it is that we 
lack the hindsight to assess all the sudden 
changes which it has brought about.

development 
ODERN air transport can drama- 
M tically improve the economic 
development prospects of Third 
World countries. 
Investment in aviation is usually consid- 
ered a costly and risky business, but there 
is now abundant evidence to show that a 
well-organized national and international 
air transport system can substantially boost 
the foreign-exchange earnings of develo- 
ping countries, as well as creating thou- 
sands of new jobs and millions of dollars of 
revenue, 
These are the unexpected and welcome 
conclusions of a two-year International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) study of 
the contribution civil aviation can make to 
the economic development of African 
states. The study, funded by the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
following a resolution of the African Civil 
Aviation Commission (AFCAC} involved 37 
countries south of the Sahara, from Mauri- 
tania in the north to Lesotho in the south. 
These countries have a total population of 
250 million people; twelve of them are land- 
locked. 
While countless studies have been made 
of African economies and many of civil 
aviation, this was the first attempt to link 
the two fields in a “cause and effect” rela- 
tionship. ICAO worked closely with other 
U.N. agencies to cover a multitude of acti- 
vities, but attention was focussed primarily 
on agriculture, industry, commerce and 
civil aviation itself. At first project members 
doubted whether aviation could make 
much of a contribution to economic

growth in Africa and provide anything 
more than luxury transport for the privi- 
leged few. After studying the question for 
two years, the governments involved are 
convinced that aviation is indeed a vital 
force in Africa. 
Its contribution to exports is already 
significant: airlines carried over $30 million 
worth of fresh horticultural products to 
Europe in 1974 and could carry much more, 
if production and marketing were better 
organized. While only seven of the 37 
countries visited contributed to these 
exports, the study revealed that most of 
the others could create employment and 
earn valuable foreign exchange by growing 
fruit and vegetables for overseas markets. 
As a result, a recommendation was made 
to 27 governments that they request assis- 
tance from the Food and Agriculture Orga- 
nization of the United Nations (FAO) so as 
to get a larger slice of this lucrative market. 
Project members were often amazed by 
the opportunities civil aviation offers to 
increase Africa's earnings. Most of them 
were aware that cut flowers represent a 
potential export, but hardly imagined that 
the retail market for flowers in Western 
Europe is worth $3 billion a year, and that 
African countries are so well-placed to take 
an increasing share of it. All states were, 
therefore, encouraged to become active in 
this area and at the same time to 
increase —wherever appropriate — h ir par- 
Aviation can contribute to 
the economic development 
of Third World countries by 
providing speedy transport 
for perishable goods and by 
opening up hitherto 
inaccessible regions. Above

Andes from the Pacific coast

(Peru). As part of its 
livestock improvement 
programme, Peru has 
airlifted thousands of cattle 
to breeding centres in its 
Amazon region. Right, 100-

flown from Nicosia (Cyprus) 
to London, arriving 10 days 
ahead of grapes sent by sea 
and fetching premium prices

Industry is still in an embryonic stage in 
Africa. Most activity is in light manufactu- 
ring, designed to reduce imports by pro- 
viding local populations with foodstuffs, 
beverages, textiles, bicycles and the like. 
The study found, however, that better use 
could be made of the plentiful supply of 
low-cost labour to produce a wide range of 
goods, from fashion garments to electronic 
equipment. Many of these goods would 
still be competitive even with the added 
cost of air transport. 
While tourism is highly developed in a 
few African countries, many others would 
like to enter the field. Tourism in Africa is 
almost entirely dependent on aviation, but 
here the experts expressed caution. 
Though the continent as a whole is rich in 
tourist attractions, few countries have 
enough to offer individually to draw signifi- 
cant numbers of visitors. 
The study warned that tourism can be a 
risky venture, with no assurance that 
returns will cover the large investments 
required. In order to avoid costly errors, 
governments were advised to seek expert 
advice before launching tourist develop- 
ment programmes. 
Though it can bring high financial 
returns in a short period, tourism does little 
to stabilize national economies, and there is 
little doubt that in the long run air com- 
 
merce geared to the exporting of perishable 
merchandise represents a sounder invest- 
ment for most African states. 
A rapid survey of the actual and potential 
markets for perishable goods reveals that 
handsome profits could be made by Afri- 
can countries willing to make a modest 
investment and to exploit the available 
capacity of air-transport carriers to Europe. 
During the winter. of 1975-76 Western 
Europe imported 105,000 tonnes of fruit 
and vegetables from Africa south of the 
Sahara, but only 20,000 tonnes were car- 
ried by air. Given normal rates of expan- 
sion, the latter figure should double by 
1980. . 
But if further efforts are made along the 
lines suggested by the ICAO study, there is 
no reason why air exports should not reach 
60,000 tonnes, worth $90 million or more 
by 1980. 
The possibilities offered by the cut 
flower market are even more impressive. In 
1974, flower imports to Europe, worth $45 
million in all, were dominated by Israel, 
Colombia and South Africa. Only two Afri- 
can countries (Kenya and the Ivory Coast) 
had a share in this market (to the tune of 
$3.3 million), and yet the climate and soil 
throughout most of Africa are ideal for 
growing flowers and aircraft are available 
to transport them. 
‘Experts predict that European flower 
imports will treble by 1980 to $135 million, 
and provided a sufficient number of states 
respond to the challenge, Africa could well 
capture half of this market. 
Another export field where rewards are 
high is that of fresh fish. Shipped by air, 
fresh fish command very high prices and 
bring exporters between 50 per cent and 
100 per cent profit, But Africa has done 
almost nothing to capitalize on this oppor- 
tunity. Only 1,300 tonnes of fish (worth 
$4.5 million) were air-freighted to Europe 
from Africa in 1975, yet Africa's exports 
could easily total $25 million in two years’ 
time. 
One tangible proof that the ICAO survey 
results are being taken seriously is the 
recent purchase by a group of West Afri- 
can states of ten turbo-prop cargo planes 
from the U.K.'s Royal Air Force. The 
planes, which can carry a maximum pay- 
load of 35 tonnes, are designed for both 
long- and short-haul operations from the 
most difficult terrain and do not need 
sophisticated ground support equipment. 
As this example shows, developing 
countries are already making decisions in 
the field of air transport which are bound to 
affect their rate of economic growth. Not 
all of these choices concern the develop- 
ment of exports; many have to do with 
regional and internal problems and pros- 
pects. 
Preliminary findings of ICAO studies in 
five East Asian countries show that while 
the level of aviation development is more 
advanced there than in Africa, the potential 
of air transport is not fully utilized and 
should be better integrated into the social 
and economic growth of the region. This 
group of countries, which includes Indone- 
sia and the Philippines, consists of more 
than 10,000 island archipelagos. 1t would

) be a big and costly process to develop sur- 
face transport to link up the isolated com- 
munities living in this difficult terrain. 
Another preliminary study indicates that 
better air transport between the islands in 
the South Pacific {including Fiji, Papua- 
New-Guinea and Western Samoa) and 
Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the 
U.S.A. might benefit tourism, light 
industry, agriculture and trade. 
In Latin America, air transport is already 
playing an important role in the develop- 
ment of several countries. Itis not generally 
known, for example, that Brazil has the 
world’s largest general aviation fleet, after 
Canada and the U.S.A. The development 
of Brazil's interior provinces in the last 20 
years would have been much slower 
without the intensive and intelligent use of 
aircraft. The same goes for the rest of 
South America. 
Brazil uses aircraft in numerous develop- 
ment programmes, including construction 
of the Trans-Amazon Highway, while 
Venezuela has pressed them into service to 
prospect for oil and mineral resources in 
Amazonia. In Peru, the Ministry of Fishery 
employs C-130 cargo-planes to airlift 20- 
tonne loads of frozen fish from Lima to 
Aycucho in the interior. The aircraft cross- 
es the Andes in one hour, while a truck 
with only a 4-tonne load takes 22 hours to 
circle the mountains. 
Taking advantage of airfreight develop- 
ment, Peru is now building freezer plants in 
the towns of the Andes to improve the 
local diet. [t has also flown in thousands of 
pure-bred cattle from Brazil, Argentina, 
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama. 
Across the Andes, Argentina uses a 
large cargo fleet to airlift machinery, vehi- 
cles, fruit, meat and other products to 
various countries in Latin America and 
even to Africa. Bolivia too is now using two 
-new C-13 Hercules to airlift farm produce 
from its Amazon basin area to La Paz. The 
aircraft will also be used to promote 
exports and to prospect for oil and gas. 
Mineral ‘prospecting and oil and gas 
exploration can be made easier and quicker 
with the help of a well-organized air trans- 
port system. Inaccessibility is no longer the 
obstacle it was, thanks to shuttle services 
capable of airlifting personnel and equip-

14 
ment to a desired location in a matter of 
hours. 
In Alaska’s North Slope, for example, 
aircraft ranging from heavyweights to light 
helicopters are used to prospect for oil, 
moving men and supplies in a quick and 
efficient manner. 
Again, if a preliminary geological survey 
shows that a region contains enough mine- 
rals and ore to justify exploitation, vehicles 
and equipment can be airlifted to the site 
either by conventional air-transport or by 
specially adapted STOL (short take-off and 
landing) aircraft. These aircraft can then 
make the return journey with a cargo of ore 
refined on the spot. This might prove a 
solution, for instance, to Egypt's difficul- 
ties in exploiting the inaccessible, yet ore- 
rich regions between the Nile and the Red 
Sea. 
These specialized uses of air transport 
offer new hope to countries unable to 
exploit their natural resources because of 
the exorbitant cost of constructing related 
road or rail networks. But the most imme- 
diately productive use of aircraft in Third 
World countries, at least in Africa, is for 
exporting perishable goods to overseas 
markets. 
Europe and the United States are the tra- 
ditional markets for such goods, but there 
is also a growing demand for rare fruits and 
exotic seafood in the oil-rich countries of 
the Middle East, where shrimps from 
Ghana, Brazilian limes, and Senegalese 
beans are beginning to make their appear- 
ance. 
The term “perishables’”’, however, 
covers a whole range of commodities other 
than food and cut flowers, which develo- 
ping countries can export by air. Such 
items include fashion garments, short-life 
radioactive substances, gold, gems, bank- 
notes and valuables of all kinds, antiques, 
newspapers and magazines. ' 
In the highly competitive world of 
modern business, developing countries can 
reap enormous benefits from air-freighting 
perishable goods. Contrary to general 
belief, air freight is no longer a means of 
transport to be used only in emergencies or 
when cost is not a prime factor. In many 
cases, air freight is the most economical 
way of shipping and marketing goods. 
According to an IATA (International Air 
Transport Association) study, the compari- 
son between air and surface costs only 
makes sense as part of an overall export 
drive. In terms of packing and crating, insu- 
rance premiums, transport charges, transit 
warehousing and wharfage and interest on 
capital invested in shipments en route, air 
freight comes out better. There are also the 
invisible benefits such as speed, punctua- 
lity, dependability and flexibility in adapting 
to changing market demand —all of which 
help to ensure the overall success of the 
operation. 
At the national level, any developing 
country must sooner or later face the ques- 
tion : what form of transport is the most 
productive investment? Compared to road 
transport, transport by air is relatively 
cheap to develop, but somewhat expensive 
to run. 
This leads to the surprising conclusion 
that in a majority of cases the least expen- 
sive and most satisfactory way of develo- 
ping a national transport system seems to 
be to start with air transport, then cons- 
truct railways, and finally to build roads to 
link outlying villages with the railway 
stations.

### 45906: The Sky's the limit; the endless possibilities of special purpose flying

  
The aeroplane, along with other types of 
aircraft such as the helicopter, the glider 
and lighter-than-air craft, have become 
tools of economic development, sources of 
recreation, and special aids to communica- 
tion and humanitarian effort throughout 
the world. 
In the field of air cargo, for example, air- 
craft such as the L-100 Hercules now travel 
the skies like the “tramp ships’ of an earlier 
era, picking up and dropping off loads of 
cattle, drilling equipment, road-building 
machinery and life-saving supplies. 
Large cargo aircraft have played a vital 
role in such major projects as the Trans- 
Amazon highway in Brazil, the Trans- 
Gabon railway in Africa, and the Alaskan 
oil pipeline. 
Other, “general aviation’ aircraft of 
various sizes and designs are used through- 
out the world in such tasks as hurricane 
hunting, the location of dangerous ice- 
bergs, and forest fire fighting. 
But these spectacular uses are only part 
of the story. General aviation in all of its 
forms now contributes thousands of inte- 
resting and highly skilled jobs to the econo- 
mies of the nations, with a growing num- 
ber of small airports providing new trade 
and communication networks. 
One of the major roles of general aviation 
is in business and commuter-type flying. In 
fact, business flying has become one of the 
world’s fastest growing industries in recent 
years. 
Forecasters say that business flying will 
continue to grow despite the energy and 
fuel shortages in many areas. On a seat- 
mile basis, small aircraft use less fuel than 
big airliners. And as airlines continue to 
cut back on flights to smaller communities 
because of light and uneconomic loads,

businessmen will continue to turn to com- 
pany planes to get them to the right place 
at the right time. 
In many countries, business planes are 
no longer used only for top company offi- 
cials. They now transport managers, engi- 
neers, accountants and other specnlists 
who must be constantly on the move, 
Busy people are also becoming used to 
the idea of hiring planes or taking small 
commuter aircraft to get them to their des- 
tination quickly. In fact, such services fre- 
quently connect with the major airlines. 
The result is a complex network of air com- 
munications similar to that which develo- 
ped in earlier eras in land and sea transport. 
Personal transportation is probably the 
most high profile category of general avia- 
tion. It means flying for fun, learning new 
skills, and perhaps the opportunity to move 
into the professional side of the aviation 
world. 
In the broad category of special purpose 
flying, there are so many uses of general 
aviation that it would be impossible to list 
them all, However, some of the more 
diverse uses include: 
* Flying health services. In Australia, 
there is a flying doctor service, which is 
designed to provide quick aid to persons 
living in lonely, isolated areas of the ‘‘out- 
back” 
* Forest and crop spraying. In Canada 
and the U.S., aircraft are used regularly to 
spray forests in the northeast where spruce 
budworm is infesting thousands of acres of 
conifers. For crops, special low-flying air- 
craft have been developed for spraying, 
and farmers are now also seeding their 
fields from the air, 
* Disease control. In the Volta River basin 
in West Africa, the World Health Organiza- 
tion is involved in a major spray programme 
 
to kill the larvae of the blackfly, which 
transmit the blinding disease of onchocer- 
ciasis. 
e Livestock airlifts. In Peru, cargo aircraft 
were used to transport 35,000 head of 
purebred cattle over the Andes to Amazon 
villages in the interior. 
* Forest fire fighting. Both planes and 
helicopters have proved successful in keep- 
ing these outbreaks under control. So- 
called “water-bombers” drop both water 
and special fire-fighting chemicals on hot 
spots in the forests. 
* Plant airlifts. In the Philippine islands, 
cargo aircraft were pressed into duty to 
move seedlings and plants as part of the 
government's green revolution pro- 
gramme. 
* Pipeline and utility line patrol. Heli- 
copters and light aircraft are used all over 
the world to fly up and down pipeline 
routes and remote power and telephone 
lines to check for possible problems. 
* Aerial photography. Map makers use 
aerial photos that can be employed with 
special viewing equipment to produce 
three-dimensional effects. - 
* Aerial archaeology. Aerial photography 
has become widely used by archaeologists 
in recent years as a means of discovering 
hidden or partly destroyed ancient sites 
that could not be found on the ground. 
Aerial photos also help archaeologists to 
plan digs by providing an overall view of 
sites and their topography. 
¢ Urban planning. Air photos can provide 
developers and city officials with an up-to- 
date look at urban growth or creeping 
blight. 
¢ Environmental and wildlife protec- 
tion. Helicopters and light aircraft can be 
particularly effective in tracking down the 
sources of water and air pollution. Conser- 
vationists in many countries use aircraft to

take inventories and assess the state of

¢ Aerial logging. Planes can be used to 
identify patches of valuable types of wood. 
In the western part of the U.S., helicopters 
are used to fly deep into forest areas and 
remove small logs for the roof shingle 
market. 
e Search and Rescue. This is one of the 
better known uses of general aviation. 
Many a hiker, mountain climber or wilder- 
ness traveller owes his life to airborne res- 
cue teams and spotters. 
¢ Cargo drops. Cargo can sometimes be 
dropped by parachute in areas where there 
are no airfields. Non-fragile supplies can be 
allowed to free fall from a low altitude, if 
necessary. During severe winters or 
drought, an aeroplane or helicopter can be 
used to drop hay and other forage to keep 
animals alive until the weather improves. 
*¢ Mail delivery. This is no doubt the 
oldest form of general aviation. Early airline 
passenger routes were pioneered by the 
pilots who flew the mail. 
* Prospecting for natural resources. 
Mining firms use aircraft to carry special 
detection instruments over land that has 
good mining prospects. Water resources 
can also be surveyed easily by aircraft. 
¢ Disaster relief. Following major floods 
and earthquakes, the aircraft is usually the 
quickest way to bring clothing, food, medi- 
cine and blood into a disaster area, as well 
as to evacuate the injured. 
* Recreation. Perhaps the most fascina- 
ting development in sport aviation in recent 
years is the increased interest in gliding, 
manpowered flight and the most basic type 
of flight of all—hang gliding. 
The recent development of the short 
take-off and landing aircraft (STOL)} has 
been a boon to general aviation. It paves

the way to flights to many areas that have 
only makeshift or short runways. 
Another general aviation trend is the 
renewed interest in lighter-than-air craft. 
Experiments have already been conducted 
in North America on the use of balloons for 
logging; several firms have plans to build a 
new generation of lighter-than-air craft. 
But spectacular as these experiments 
and sports may be, it is in the area of busi- 
ness and special purpose aviation that 
general aviation will make its economic 
impact during the next few decades. 
The aircraft has joined the computer as 
one of the great new tools of our time. And 
both can be of benefit to developed and 
developing countries. 
The small community with an industrial 
airport can now compete on a more equal 
basis with big cities in bidding to attract 
industries. In fact, some observers see the 
growth of general aviation as a handmaid 
of industrial decentralization. 
Companies can be attracted to smaller 
population centres by their proximity to 
raw materials, by their lower land and ope- 
rating costs, and by better living conditions 
for employees. General aviation makes 
remote communities accessible to the 
larger market centres. 
If the past is any guide, men will con- 
tinue to find ‘new special uses for the 
aeroplane.

human race, born to fly upward, 
wherefore at a little wind dost thou 
so fall?”’. 
Wind shear was not exactly what Dante 
had in mind in his poetic outburst 600 years 
ago. Yet he couldn't have been more to the 
point about this weather hazard which, 
along with birds and wake vortices, the 
ICAO Council has called one of the three 
major technical problems facing aviation 
today. 
Wind shear—the sudden change in wind 
with height and distance—is not the worst 
thing in an aviator's atmosphere, but it 
rates high because of the element of sur- 
prise. Under certain circumstances it can 
turn a smooth take-off or a final approach 
into a sickening roll if not a dive at the end 
of the runway. 
For over 10 years, ICAO has been trying 
to establish requirements for measuring 
low-level wind shears and turbulence at 
international airports, and to develop inter- 
national procedures for warning pilots 
about them. It recently studied replies from 
42 states and three international organiza- 
tions to three inquiries on the subject and 
especially on the kind of information 
needed to avoid these dangers. 
These replies show that less than half of 
the ICAO states are studying wind shear. 
Several of them mentioned that studies 
were difficult because of the complexity of 
the problem and the need for sophisticated 
equipment and facilities. 
A few states, however, are carrying out 
studies using instrument towers, experi- 
mental ground-based measuring devices 
and data obtained by aircraft. Some of 
these studies concentrate on wind data 
provided by masts or towers in the vicinity 
of aerodromes or, as in the United States, 
on a variety of aspects, including manned 
flight simulation, wind shear hazard defini- 
tions and digital simulation, wind shear 
forecasts and the development of airborne 
. and’ ground-based detection and , mea- 
suring systems. 
The United States reply noted that since 
five of the last six air carrier wind shear 
accidents in the U.S. were associated with

ICAQ’s Accident Investigation and Prevention 
‘Section. He is also Vice-President of the Cana- 
dian Society of Air Safety Investigators. 
thunderstorms, a major portion of their 
research deals with measures to prevent 
thunderstorm-related wind shear acci- 
dents. 
ICAO is cautiously optimistic about the 
progress of studies now under way. Some 
useful results may be expected within one 
to two years, mainly in respect of wind 
shear effects on aircraft, aircraft instrumen- 
tation and pilot training. The development 
of effective ground-based wind shear mea- 
suring equipment, however, is likely to take 
longer. 
The increasing use of wide-bodied jets 
has highlighted a phenomenon which 
exists to a certain extent with all aeroplanes 
but which has now become a matter of 
great importance. This is wake turbulence. 
It is a simple enough phenomenon but 
one with serious implications for aircraft 
operations and airports. Every aeroplane in 
flight generates wake vortices, pairs of 
counter-rotating masses of air extending 
backwards from the aircraft's wing tips and 
flaps when extended. 
The violent, fast-spinning but invisible air 
masses trail for several kilometres behind 
the aircraft. The greater the lift being pro- 
duced by the wing and the bigger the aero- 
plane, the more violent and long-lived the 
vortices and the greater the danger for any 
light aircraft which follow too closely 
behind during take-off or landing. 
The U.S. National Transportation Safety 
Board has cited wake vortices as a contri- 
butory factor in 147 accidents in the United 
States between 1963 and 1974. While most 
involved light aircraft, one fatal accident 
involved a DC-9 behind a DC-10. In the 
United Kingdom, where the proportion of 
light aircraft is small, especially at busy air- 
ports, there has so far been no accident 
caused by wake vortices, but a number of 
near accidents have been reported. 
Vortex encounters occur most frequently 
when aircraft are approaching an airport 
since it is in this phase of flight that succes- 
sive aircraft are most likely to follow similar 
flight paths. These types of encounters are 
especially hazardous since the aircraft may 
be close to the ground and the crew's 
workload is high in this phase of flight. 
At the time the B-747 entered service, 
authorities in the U.K. imposed a distance 
of 10 nautical miles or four minutes be- 
tween it and any following smaller aircraft 
as a precaution during landing. This sepa- 
ration was later reduced to five nautical 
miles or two minutes on the basis of results 
of trials in the United Kingdom and the Uni- 
ted States. In the U.K., the five-minute 
separation was maintained for small aircraft 
following big planes, including Concorde. 
In the U.S., the five-minute separation was 
applied behind aircraft having a take-off 
weight in excess of 135 tonnes. This inclu- 
des the heavier B-707's, DC-8's and 
VC-10's. 
Extensive theoretical and experimental 
research on wake vortices has been carried 
out in recent years by private industry and 
government agencies in the U.S. and the 
U.K. In May 1974, a joint agreement bet- 
ween the U.S. Department of Transporta- 
tion and the British Civil Aviation Authority 
established a test site at Heathrow Interna- 
tional Airport in London which recorded 
12,950 landings through June 1975. 
A vortex test site is also in operation at 
John F. Kennedy International Airport in 
New York while a joint U.S.-Canadian pro- 
gramme to collect data on departing air- 
craft has been set up at Toronto Interna- 
tional Airport. 
It is hoped that further developments in 
ground sensors and comprehensive data 
collection will enable experts to find ways 
to reduce and dissipate the vortices. 
Meanwhile, separation standards remain 
the best possible way of coping with the 
problem. 
While man gets craftier, birds also 
become smarter. Scaring them away from 
aircraft is not an easy task even if modern 
techniques are better than the farmer's 
scarecrow. 
There exists no “Convention on Air Traf- 
fic Control” to regulate whether birds or 
aircraft have the right of way. Although 
most people in aviation are aware of a “bird 
problem”, few realize its magnitude. As 
reported in the ICAO Bulletin, eight aircraft 
crashes have been attributed to birds since 
1973. In 1976, two executive jets were 
‘downed by birds. It is estimated that each 
year there are 2,400 significant bird strikes 
to civil aircraft, and repairs to damaged air- 
craft were said to run into millions of dol- 
lars. 
Since civil jet aircraft spend most of their 
flying time at altitudes not normally occu- 
pied by birds, the hazard exists mainly at, 
and near, airports. It is during the critical 
take-off and landing phases that aircraft 
and birds occupy the same airspace. 
Simply stated, the bird strike prevention 
programme aims at keeping birds from 
coming to the airport, driving away those 
that do come, and reporting on those that 
stay too long. 
Birds may live at an airport, but, just as 
often, they may only be visitors and, like 
any visitor, look for a place to eat, drink or 
21

rest. The airport can be made unattractive 
to them by draining wet areas and cutting 
down trees. Other countermeasures, such 
'as changing the ground cover or extermi- 
nating earthworms, are more complex. 
Each airport requires its own study and 
improvement plan." 
However, these measures will not elimi- 
nate all birds from an airport. Like any tou- 
rist, different birds are looking for different 
things. What may be unattractive to one 
may be inviting to another. Airports offer 
large areas which, except for aircraft, are 
relatively undisturbed by man. 
In one reported case birds had built a 
nest in the engine intake of a turbo-prop 
plane in only one and a half hours while the 
aircraft was idle on the ground. An- 
other report noted that a group of jack- 
daws had hidden 72 pieces of metal in a 
plane while it was in a hangar. The largest 
piece was a wrench. With resourcefulness 
like this, the only solution is to remove all 
birds to other nesting places far away from 
the airport. 
The most common techniques currently 
being used to drive birds away are loud noi- 
ses produced by shells or gas explosions, 
flashes of light, flares and recorded bird 
distress calls. These calls, played back 
through sound systems, have been found 
most effective. 
Many airports now employ patrol teams 
equipped with vehicles and dispersal equip- 
ment. The noise of guns usually keeps the 
‘birds away for a short while, but they may 
soon come back or be replaced by new- 
comers. It doesn’t take a bird long to figure 
out that the noise below is produced by 
man. . 
it is also important, therefore, to have a 
reporting system that will inform pilots 
when they may expect competition for the 
same airspace. The control tower, assisted 
by ground staff, can provide such informa- 
tion. 
Radar is also used to detect flocks of 
birds flying in the vicinity of airports. This is 
particularly useful during bird migration 
periods when extremely hazardous condi- 
tions may occur. Besides reporting on birds 
near airports, charts have been published 
that show the migration routes of birds. 
Improvements in aircraft design have not 
been ignored. Agreement has been 
reached in ICAO that aircraft structures 
should be designed so that aircraft can 
continue to fly safely after impact with a 
1.81-kilogramme bird.

CTS of unlawful interference today 
A pose a serious threat to civil avia- 
tion. Like other major forms of 
transportation in the past, aviation has in 
recent years become a target for criminal 
acts. The media usually describe this new 
form of crime as “hijacking” or “air 
piracy”, using terms which evoke similar 
offences on land and on the high seas. 
All states must deal inexorably with 
crime, and to protect their national inte- 
rests must take steps to combat these acts 
of unlawful interference. 
The President of the Council of ICAO, Dr 
Assad Kotaite, drew attention to this issue 
on 15 September 1977 during his address 
to the 22nd session of the ICAO Assembly: 
“Unfortunately, acts of unlawful inter- 
ference with international civil aviation and 
its facilities continue to have a serious 
adverse effect on the safety, regularity and 
efficiency of international air transport. Itis 
imperative that all states take measures to 
safeguard international civil air transport. 
“The number of parties to the three 
Conventions— Tokyo (1963), The Hague 
(1970} and Montreal (1971)—is steadily 
increasing. Our aim at ICAO is to achieve 
universal acceptance of these instruments 
and their full application to prevent the 
occurrence of any acts endangering the 
safety of international civil aviation.” 
The international community has expres- 
sed its concern about this form of crime 
through a number of resolutions of the 
United Nations, the most recent of which 
-was adopted on 3 November 1977, and 
through resolutions adopted by other inter- 
national organizations. 
The Aviation Security Programme spon- 
sored by ICAO was drawn up in response 
to this concern. It may be divided into two 
complementary parts, legal and technical. 
Three conventions dealing with the legal 
aspects of the problem have been adopted 
so far. 
The Tokyo Convention, adopted as early 
as 1963, was the first concrete action by 
  
JOHN MARRETT of Jamaica joined the Inter- 
national Civil Aviation Organization in 1970 to 
prepare its Security Manual and is now the 
Organization's Aviation Security Officer. 


### 45911: World alert against hijacking: a decade of violence

World 
against 
the international community to draw up 
legislation on the unlawful seizure of air- 
craft. It deals with offences, committed on 
board aircraft registered in a Contracting 
State while that aircraft is in flight.- At pre- 
sent, 88 states are parties to the Tokyo 
Convention. 
The Convention of The Hague, signed: 
on 16 December 1970, defines the act of 
unlawful seizure of an aircraft. It contains 
detailed provisions on states’ jurisdiction 
over an offence, on taking offenders into 
custody, and on questions of prosecution 
and extradition. The Convention has so far 
been ratified by 79 states. 
A year later, in September 1971, another 
conference convened at Montreal under 
the auspices of ICAO adopted a Conven- 
tion for the “suppression of unlawful acts 
against the safety of civil aviation.” The 
Montreal Convention defines a wide spec- 
trum of unlawful acts and is concerned, 
broadly speaking, with acts of sabotage. 
The Contracting States have undertaken to 
make these offences punishable by severe 
penalties. So far, 75 states have become 
parties to this Convention. 
On the technical side, the primary goal of 
the ICAQ aviation security programme is 
the prevention of unlawful acts, but it also 
deals extensively with measures to be 
taken if preventive action fails. To help 
states implement their own security pro- 
grammes, ICAO convenes informal regio- 
nal seminars, and in 1971 published a 
manual on aviation security. The manual, 
which provides detailed procedures and 
guidance, is kept up to date by regularly 
issued amendments. 
Some states that have requested more 
detailed technical assistance have been 
provided with the services of an itinerant 
aviation security expert. Funds have been 
provided for this by the United Nations 
Development Programme {UNDP). 
Other aviation security programmes have 
been developed by such international orga- 
nizations as the International Criminal 
Police Organization (IPCO-Interpol); the 
Universal Postal Union (UPU); the Interna- 
tional Air Transport Association (IATA); 
the Airport Association Co-ordinating 
Council (AACC); and the International 
Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations 
(IFALPA). 
The travelling public may therefore be 
assured that the resources of the entire 
world community have been and still are 
being mobilized to promote the safe, 
orderly and efficient development and use 
of civil aviation in the interests of all the 
peoples of the world.

Flying 
for thrills 
by Oleg K. Antonov 
Several types of Soviet aircraft 
flying with internal and 
international airlines bear the 
markings “A N”, indicating that 
they were designed by Oleg 
Konstantinovich Antonov, the 
noted Soviet aeronautical 
engineer. The designer and 
constructor of aircraft ranging 
from small Red Cross planes to a 
big 80-tonne transport, Antonov is 
a Member of the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences, a Hero of 
Soviet Labour, and a Lenin Prize- 
winner. Since 1946 he has been 
head of a major U.S.S.R. 
Aeronautical Research and 
Development Bureau. In the 
following text, an extract from 
his memoirs Ten Times Over 
(“Desiat’ raz snachala”), he looks 
back to the year 1932 when he 
was beginning his career as a 
glider constructor.

every bolt has been driven in place to func-

made for it; every lever stamped, bent,

So simple, in fact, that in medieval Rus- 
sia and in ancient Greece and even earlier, 
in ancient India, craftsmen and materials 
could have been found to build a glider 
capable of flying hundreds of kilometres 
and soaring for hours aloft. But there was 
just one little thing missing—the know- 
how. 
It would take man two or three thousand 
years to solve an apparently simple prob- 
lem: fitting together pieces of wood, fabric 
and a few metal elements to fashion what 
goes nowadays by the unassuming name 
of glider. 
For a glider pilot there is no such thing as 
an engine. He accustoms himself to the 
discipline of gliding from the very first jerk 
on the shock-cord. 
The glider pilot has a golden rule which 
he must never forget: “keep up speed.” 
There is no engine, no propeller thrust, so 
forget about stepping on the gas and puli- 
ing the stick back to gain height. Keep 
going, forward and down; forward and 
down. If you lose concentration you lose 
speed and down you go. A good glider will

go into a half-spin, or even a spin, and if 
there's enough altitude, you'll come out of 
it. But if there's not, say just 50 or 100 
metres, you'd better not dawdle. 
The minute you have an inkling you're 
losing gliding speed, your hand automati- 
cally eases the stick. If you're flying in an 
open cockpit, you feel the speed with your 
whole being. With your face, with your 
eyebrows, with your ears, from the slope 
angle of the glider, from the pressure on 
the stick, from the singing of the struts, 
from the hissing of the air stream, from the 
vibration of the cabin. Forward and down,

chute? Safety belts were also frowned 
upon.

HAT shall we see in civil aviation 
Wy after the turn of the century? 
Thousand-tonne flying wings 
carrying 1,000 or more passengers? Hyper- 
sonic transports with unlimited range? 
Spacecraft regularly winging their way to 
and from Earth orbital missions? 
Some of these craft will be operational 
early in the 21st century; others may not 
reach fruition before the year 2025; yet 
others may never see service at all. But 
they all exist today, either as concepts in 
the minds of aircraft designers and engi- 
neers or at some stage of development. A 
few are already with us as experimental 
vehicles. 
The problem with crystal-balling in the 
aviation field, as in others, is that major 
technological advances do not always 
occur when the world is ready for them. 
During the period between the conception 
of an experimental aircraft and its success- 
ful demonstration, non-technical obstacles 
may crop up to prevent the normal progres- 
sion from testing and evaluation to opera- 
tional use. The opposite may also happen: 
prototypes at an advanced stage of deve- 
lopment may become obsolete because of 
a major technological breakthrough. 
The consensus today in the civil aviation 
industry is that between now and the year 
2000 there will be no major design changes 
in the world’s commercial aircraft. Both the 
airframe manufacturers and the airlines

### 45916: The Shape of things to come

Tomorrow's aircraft are already on 
the drawing board and in some cases 
models are being tested in wind or 
hydraulic tunnels where various 
flying conditions are simulated. 
Special optical instruments are used 
to record the movement of air or 
water as they flow around the model, 
sometimes producing surprising 
visual effects. Turbulent flow round a 
cylindrical fuselage (left) in hydraulic 
test tunnel at Chatillon (France) 
shows up as a haunting owl-eyed 
mask. Below, model of a supersonic

decades to be derivatives of today's 
designs. 
stretched. They will have more or fewer 
engines, and passenger craft will be modi- 
fied so that they can be more easily con- 
verted to carry freight. Engines will be 
quieter and produce less pollutants. Range 
may be extended, and take-off and landing 
runs may be shortened. But for those of us 
on the ground, the narrow-body transports 
will look about the same as today’s. So will 
the large, wide-body aircraft, though they 
“may possibly be bigger. 
The reasons for this are largely econo- 
mic. The cost of new aircraft continues to 
escalate. The air transport industry is still 
growing, but at a much slower rate than 
anticipated. The cost of fuel is still moun- 
ting as available world supplies diminish. 
In the longer term, however, the picture 
may not be so bleak. In all the industrial- 
ized countries, intensive research has been 
going on for years in key areas that would 
permit radical changes in aircraft design. 
Research into advanced materials alone 
They will be shortened or’ 
is already producing structures which com- 
bine enormously increased strength - with 
significant reductions in weight. New 
engine designs, backed up by sophisticated 
research in acoustics, may prove so effec- 
tive in the not-too-distant future that the 
next major step in reducing aircraft noise 
will have to come from the airframe itself. 
Fuel research is introducing an entirely 
new factor into the equation. Synthetic 
fossil fuels, liquid hydrogen and nuclear 
power are all being studied today as poten- 
tial power alternatives. However, given 
today’s technology and the lack of interna- 
tional commitment, the practical use of 
either liquid hydrogen or nuclear energy for 
aircraft propulsion is a long way off. 
Advanced wing configuration is another 
area of research that is already paying off. 
Some models, now in an advanced stage 
of development, have been shown to com- 
bine enormous lift for heavy payloads with 
short take-off and landing (STOL) capabili- 
ties. As a result, we may see vastly differ- 
ent wing structures coming into use in the 
next century, as well as the possibility of a )

There are two major 
trends in aeronautical 
research today. One is 
the result of a quest for’ 
higher speed; the other’ 
stems from a search for 
greater economy. 
Designs for future high- 
speed planes : 
incorporate wings that 
are smaller and 
increasingly tucked into 
the fuselage. The 
search for economy, on 
the other hand, 
produces wings that are 
stretched, have less

The fuselage tends to

trends in aircraft design.

) transonic transport operating at slightly 
over the speed of sound. 
Let us look at some of the research now 
in progress. 
The use of composite materials for the 
manufacture of aircraft structural parts is a 
relatively recent field, although the devel- 
opment of bonded glass fibre began as far 
back as 1940. This technology consists of 
producing structures of virtually any shape 
by stacking and moulding layers of diffe- 
rently oriented fibres contained in a plastic 
base. 
The so-called advanced reinforced com- 
posites which emerged in the mid-1960s 
incorporate boron filaments whose 
strength and high performance instantly 
appealed to aeronautic engineers. Today 
composites are replacing more and more 
metal structures because of the weight and 
cost savings and greater fuel economy that 
can be achieved. 
The really important thing about compo- 
sites is that the selection of fibre material 
and the lamination of layers with fibres run- 
ning in different directions for each layer 
permit an end product that fits specific 
structural needs. For example, composites 
can guarantee good bending strength for 
one piece and keep costs down in another 
which is only subjected to low stress. It 
has been estimated that, compared with 
metals, advanced composites can bring 
energy savings of up to 33 per cent and

weight savings approaching 30 per cent. 
A relatively new material has been pro- 
duced by what is called “whisker” techno- 
logy, in which nearly perfect crystalline 
structures of carbon provide a specific 
strength approximately 50 times that of 
steel. 
One major U.S. airframe manufacturer 
estimates that up to 75 per cent of an air- 
craft could be made from composites, pri- 
marily graphite epoxy, and that the overall 
cost would be 21 per cent less than that of 
its metal counterpart. As the airframe 
would be much lighter, fuel consumption 
would be reduced by about 30 per cent. 
With today’s technology, such an aircraft 
could be built by the 1980s or early 1990s, 
and operational soon after. 
What kind of fuel will be used in the early 
2000s? Most experts believe that conven- 
tional kerosene jet fuel will be the basic civil 
aviation source well into the next century. 
As we approach the year 2000, however, 
alternative fuels may have to be intro- 
duced. 
Synthetic kerosene, obtained from coal 
and shale, could be mixed directly with 
petroleum-based fuels, giving an end- 
product whose properties would be similar 
to those of today’s jet fuel. Coal and shale 
supplies appear to be large, and such a fuel 
would require few changes in storage and 
ground handling and could readily be used 
in conventional aircraft. However, some 
specialists feel strongly that a major com- 
mitment should now be made to devel 
oping the use of liquid methane or liquid 
hydrogen as a fuel. In either case, a new 
aircraft design would be required. 
For the same weight of fuel, liquid 
methane can provide 20 per cent more heat 
than kerosene. Its density is about half and 
its cost about the same as kerosene fuels. 
But liquid methane only exists at very low 
temperatures (—161 °C at atmospheric 
pressure), like liquid hydrogen {—253 °C), 
and thus creates storage and handling pro- 
blems. Although its higher heating value 
reduces the total fuel needed to carry a 
load over a given distance, the improve- 
ment is only modest. Because it is lighter, 
bigger fuel tanks are required. 
More interest has been shown in an air- 
craft fuelled by liquid hydrogen because of 
its even higher heating value: 280 per cent 
that of kerosene for the same weight of 
fuel. The trouble is that its density is only 
one-twelfth that of kerosene. Thus the 
liquid hydrogen needed to produce the 
same energy as kerosene fuel, while weigh- 
ing only 35 per cent as much, requires a 
volume four times as great. 
Obviously, then, an aircraft using liquid 
hydrogen would require a larger, heavier 
fuselage with greater aerodynamic drag 
and consequently reduced efficiency. At 
the same time it would have a lower gross 
weight at take-off, thus requiring less

launched from a specially 
adapted carrier (here shown taking

leave Earth powered by its twin 
rockets, go into orbit, perform a

Swinging wings 
One proposed design for tomorrow's 
aircraft is the oblique-wing plane 
which would fly at slightly over the 
speed of sound. The wing, located 
atop the fuselage, is rotated as the 
aircraft gathers speed. (In wind 
tunnel testing it has already been 
turned as much as 50°.) If maximum 
speed is carefully controlled no sonic 
boom is created.

) energy per kilometre than conventional air- 
craft. On a long flight the energy economy 
would be significant. Nevertheless, cost is 
a serious hurdle. 
Another problem that cannot be taken 
lightly is the storage and handling of liquid 
hydrogen. One expert estimates that the 
complex required at a major international 
airport for the storage and handling of 
liquid hydrogen for wide-body jets would 
be 30 times the size of the gigantic U.S. 
Apollo Space Programme installations near 
New Orleans. 
The proponents of liquid hydrogen, 
however, stress a number of advantages of 
this fuel. There would be a dramatic reduc- 
tion in the noxious exhaust fumes from 
commercial transport aircraft. The major 
exhaust product of liquid hydrogen is water 
vapour, with minute amounts of oxides of 
hydrogen. With careful design, they 
assert, the latter could be reduced far 
below that of equivalent kerosene-fuelled 
jet engines. 
Furthermore, hydrogen-fuelled superso- 
nic transport aircraft of the future would 
generate a lighter supersonic boom, and 
these second- or third-generation superso- 
nic transports will require 40 per cent less 
energy than if synthetic jet fuel is used. 
As we near the end of the century, new 
aircraft, particularly those operating in the 
subsonic and transonic ranges, may benefit 
from current developments in wing aerody- 
namics and even from entirely new con- 
cepts in the use of wing structures. 
Some of these changes may not even be 
noticed by the casual observer. For exam- 
ple, by increasing wing thickness or redu- 
cing sweep, we may significantly reduce 
the weight of. wings and greatly improve 
aerodynamic efficiency. The result would 
be lower fuel consumption or much smaller 
engine sizes to carry the same payload over 
a given distance. Another by-product 
could be reduced noise on the approach to 
airports. 
Other, even more sophisticated changes 
in wing design involve controlling the air- 
flow around the wings in order to reduce 
turbulent flow and thereby reduce drag. 
This could result in fuel savings of as much 
as 50 per cent. 
An even stranger-looking design is the 
proposed oblique-wing aircraft, which 
would fly at speeds slightly over that of 
sound. A relatively long, narrow, straight 
wing is located atop the fuselage, forming 
a shape which turns out to be ideal for both 
low-speed and high-speed flight. As the 
aircraft picks up speed, the wing is rotated. 
In wind-tunnel testing it has been turned as 
much as 50°. The remarkable thing is that 
at low supersonic speeds (up to Mach 1.5) 
in the wind tunnel such asymmetrical 
models have been found to be more stable 
than models of conventional aircraft. Also, 
if the maximum speed is carefully control- 
led, no sonic boom is created. 
Because of new developments in shield- 
ing nuclear reactors and successful tests 
which have shown that there would be no 
release of radioactive material in the event 
of a crash, we may see nuclear power 
coming to the fore for aircraft propulsion. 
The temperatures generated are suffi- 
cient to drive a turbofan engine suitable for 
powering subsonic transports. However, 
because of the concentrated weight of the 
reactor and its shielding, very large aircraft 
would be required, probably weighing in’ at 
500 tonnes or more. A nuclear-powered 
transport aircraft could provide a range 
equal to some 10,000 continuous flight 
hours without refuelling. 
In the same weight range or larger is the 
“flying wing’’ that many designers have 
dreamed of for years. Some feel that the 
flying wing, unencumbered as it is with the 
long body structure of conventional air-p

On 23 August 1977 the first successful man-powered flight took place in California (U.S.A.}. At the 
controls of the flimsy-looking Gossamer Condor was a young hang-glider pilot and bicycle racer, 
Bryan Allen, who triumphantly walked off with an $86,000 prize awarded by British industrialist Henry 
Kremer. Competitors had been trying to win it for 18 years. Propelling the craft with a bicycle-pedal 
mechanism, he flew the figure-eight course around two pylons 800 metres apart in seven minutes. 
The craft, designed by aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready, was made of piano wires, aluminium 
tubing and see-through plastic. With a wingspan of 28 metres, it weighed only 32 kilos.

craft, is the most efficient design obtain- 
able. Others believe it to be inherently 
unstable. 
The wing required for take-off and lan- 
ding would have to be deep enough to pro- 
vide lift, and would thus have enough room 
for the payload— possibly 1,500 to 2,000 
passengers and 300 tonnes of car- 
go—which could be distributed over the 
entire span. A first-generation vehicle 
could use conventional engines, while 
second-generation flying wings might have 
a fusion reactor. The later version would 
have an unlimited range; its cruising speed 
would be some 1,000 km. per hour. 
Looking further ahead, we may even- 
tually see an even more revolutionary air- 
craft, capable of travelling at Mach 6—i.e. 
six times the speed of sound. The fuel, 
liquid hydrogen, would also be used to cool 
the aircraft's skin, compensating for the 
enormous heat generated at such a high 
speed. Researchers look on the Mach 6 
hypersonic transport as the logical succes- 
sor of the March 3-4 class supersonic trans- 
ports of the nearer future, which will pro- 
bably also be powered by liquid hydrogen. 
Why Mach 6? The answer is that this 
seems to be the upper speed limit that fits 
the practical journey times for long-range 
flights of from 8,000 to 10,000 km. Such a 
hypersonic plane, carrying between 300 
and 400 passengers and looking not much 
different from today’s Anglo-French delta- 
wing Concorde, except in size, would make 
the non-stop trip from Los Angeles to Paris 
in less than three hours. 
Although there seems little doubt in the 
minds of many scientists today that such a 
craft could be built some time early in the 
21st century, there certainly is some doubt 
as to its practicality, Nevertheless, experi- 
mental versions of ramjet engines neces- 
sary for powering the hypersonic transport 
are already in research and development. 
Much closer on the horizon, however, is 
a vehicle that represents an equally radical 
departure from the norm: the U.S. Space 
Shuttle. It is the first offspring of the mar- 
riage between aerodynamics (it is a glider) 
and space technology (it uses rocket con- 
trol when in space). This large aerospace 
transport vehicle is now well ahead in deve- 
lopment. 
The first re-usable space transport 
system, the shuttle will leave Earth boosted 
by immense twin solid propellant rockets, 
go into orbit, manoeuvre in space as re- 
quired to perform its mission, then return 
and land without power—something like a 
conventional jet transport aircraft, except 
that the pilot will have to control it like a gli- 
der during a lengthy landing approach. 
After refuelling, it should be ready for its 
next flight and could be used for hundreds 
of missions. 
The first fully operational flight of the 
Space Shuttle is expected in 1980, 
and the life of the programme as pre- 
sently conceived could carry it up to the 
turn of the century. And if these missions 
are successful, one can expect that at 
some point during the next 20 years a 
follow-up programme for an even more 
versatile Shuttle might evolve. For this is 
just the beginning.

A new landing system using laser beams was perfected in late 1977 by Soviet 
scientist Igor Berezhnoi. Known as Glissada, the system reduces the pilot's 
reliance on his instrument panel in conditions of poor visibility or at night. Five 
powerful red beams (left), which présent no danger to vision, are visible 20 km. 
away. Three of them indicate the edges and centre line of the runway; the other 
two show the glide path. Schematic representations above show what the pilot 
sees on his glide path as he comes in to land: 1.} plane is left of course; (2.) on 
course; (3.) right of course. Shown below, plane touching down at night with the

Thai airport plan takes off 
With the help of the United Nations Develop- 
ment Programme (UNDP) Thailand has laun- 
ched an airport development plan to bring its 
domestic air services into the jet age. A master 
plan will be drawn up incorporating the develop- 
ment needs of the country’s 31 domestic air- 
ports, many of them in remote areas which can 
only be reached by air. 
Apartheid and sickness 
On the occaston of the International Day for the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (21 March 
1978), which coincided with the faunching of 
International Anti-Apartheid Year, Dr. Halfdan 
Mahler. Director-General of the World Health 
Organization, reaffirmed WHO's condemnation 
of apartheid in these terms: “The destructive 
invasion of apartheid into all spheres of human 
existence has not spared one of the most cher- 
ished human values: health. There is an enor- 
mous gap between the state of health of the 
white minority and that of the black majority. 
The patterns and levels of nutrition, sickness 
and mortality of whites and blacks are so diffe- 
rent that it would be difficult to believe that they 
refer to populations which have been living 
within the same country for centuries.” 
Cape Verde— 
Unesco’s 
144th Member State 
The Republic of Cape Verde signed the constitu- 
tion of Unesco on 15 February 1978, bringing the 
total number of Unesco Member States to 144. 
The Cape Verde Islands (capital Praia on San- 
tiago island), a former Portuguese colony situa- 
ted in the Atlantic 500 km. from the African 
coast, is a major stopping-off point for transat- 
lantic shipping. 
Blind dolphins of the Indus 
In 1974 only 50-odd fresh-water dolphins were 
alive in the Indus river, and this rare species 
faced extinction. Today numbers have risen 
(198, including some 30 babies, were recently 
counted) thanks to conservation measures taken 
by the Pakistani authorities with the aid of the 
World Wildlife Fund based in Morges (Switzer- 
land). The Indus dolphin, which lives in muddy 
waters, has lost the use of its eyes and relies on 
a highly developed sonar system to move about 
and find food. 
Clean air 
for the Acropolis 
For the first time since the World Health Organi- 
zation (WHO) began its environmental pollution 
control project in Athens there has been a dra- 
matic drop (50% for the period mid-Nov. 1977 to 
mid-Jan. 1978) in the level of sulphur dioxide 
which causes much of the Greek capital's air 
pollution. A regulation issued by the Greek 
government, on the recommendation of WHO, 
has prohibited the use of heavy high sulphur oils 
for heating in the Athens area. This measure, 
which has not only improved health conditions 
in Athens but also removed a major cause of the 
deterioration of the Acropolis monuments, fol- 
lows a series of studies carried out with the aid 
of Unesco specialists. 
                                                           
  
  
New Unesco records 
Two new titles have been released in the 
Unesco-sponsored “Musical Atlas" record col- 
lection (Odeon/EMI): Music of the Baka 
Pygmies of Cameroon (3C 064-18265) and Tradi- 
tional Arab Music from Morocco (3C 
064-18264). Forthcoming recordings in the 
Unesco-sponsored - "Musical Sources” collec- 
tion (Philips) include Australian Aboriginal 
Music, Religious Songs from Corsica, and 
Osawa Daiko Japanese Drums. (The Unesco 
record collections are edited for the International 
Music Council by the International Institute for 
Comparative Music Studies.) Please do not send 
orders to Unesco. Order through your local 
record dealer. 
Drought and hunger 
in the Sahel 
The food situation in the African Sahel following 
last year's drought is worse than at first expec- 
ted, reports Mr. Edouard Saouma, Director- 
General of the Food and Agriculture Organiza- 
tion of the United Nations (FAO). Upper Volta, 
Mali and Chad have joined Mauritania, Senegal 
and Gambia on the list of stricken countries. Aid 
operations, co-ordinated by the World Food 
Programme, have been going on since the 
beginning of the crisis in September 1977. 
Cultural co-operation 
“in Europe 
A new plan for cultural co-operation involving 22 
European countries has been adopted by the 
Council of Europe in Strasbourg. The plan inclu- 
des six major projects on the following themes: 
secondary education and preparation for life; 
innovations in higher education; the develop- 
ment of adult education; modern languages tea- 
ching; cultural development policies; and culture 
and the media. 
 
“Human Rights: 
_signed but not yet ratified 
In our November 1977 issue, we indica- 
ted in footnotes (pages 29 and 32) that 
69 Member States had ratified or acce- 
ded to the International Covenant on 
, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
and that 68 States had ratified or acce- 
ded to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. We also listed 
28 countries as having ratified or acce- 
ded to the Optional Protocol relating to 
the Covenant on Civil and political 
Rights. In point of fact, these figures did 
not represent ratifications or accessions 
to the Covenants and to the Protocol but 
more broadly to the number of States 
which had merely signed them, Not all 
the States which have signed these ins- 
truménts have formally ratified or acce- 
- ded to_them. We ask readers to excuse 
this confusion of terms which do not 
have the same legal‘'weight. As of April 
1978 49 States had ratified or acceded to 
the first of these Covenants, 47 the 
second, and 18 the Protocol.

Letters 
to the editor 
A YOUTHFUL VOICE 
ON WORLD PROBLEMS 
Sir, 
for education and information. Population is 
increasing at an immense rate, and feeding 
For the moment, the U.S.A., the 
U.S.S.R. and Europe have enough surplus 
food to supply the poor countries. But in- 
stead of doing this we live on a mountain of 
products that we can hardly consume. We 
waste and eat far too much rich and fat 
health, 
Why is this waste and over-consumption 
so dangerous? Consumption needs produc- 
tion, and production needs energy, lots of 
energy, and energy comes mostly from oil, 
which will be used up by 1995-2000. It is the 
poor countries that need oil in order to deve- 
lop technologically advanced agriculture to 
supply their starving people.- 
Why is nuclear energy not a solution? 
Nuclear energy needs -uranium and 
plutonium—and they will be used up in 
about 50 years. 
The fact that $43 million are spent every 
hour on military purposes throughout the 
world, day and night, does not make the 
situation easier. Isn't it ridiculous to spend so 
much money on weapons that are only used 
to kill? All the weapons in the world today 
could kill the Earth's population about 20 
times over.   
Several critical problems face the world 
today and increasingly menace its future. 
The main problem is overpopulation, mainly 
in the poor countries where there is a need , 
all these people is becoming a big problem. 
food, and in so doing we threaten our own 
Pollution in water, air and soil have ecolo- 
gical! effects and bring about climatic 
changes. These effects could destroy agri- 
culture and drastically cut down the produc- 
tion of food. 
| could go on listing problems for ever, but 
these are the most important, They are pro- 
bably too big for an individual to cope with 
but they are certainly not insoluble if we all 
work together. For many people who are not 
young and do not have their whole lives in 
front of them find it hard to see what they 
could do. 
Educating and informing your children and 
grandchildren is very, very important, giving 
them love and respect so that they will go 
out into the world with high moral values 
and a determination to solve problems. 
For young people it is best to choose to 
educate yourselves as much as possible and 
choose a job that can help the world; for 
example as doctors, engineers, agricultural 
economists, politicians, missionaries, etc. 
| hope that we can together make a decent 
future for ourselves and for posterity, 
although the future is full of big problems.

SHOULD HUMAN RIGHTS 
BE COMPULSORY? 
Sir, 
| should like to draw your attention to arti- 
cle 26 (1) of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the full text of which you 
published in your November 1977 issue. 
This article declares that everyone has the 
right to education and that in the elementary 
and fundamental stages it shall be free. No 
one could quarrel with this. Why then does 
the article continue by saying that ‘’elemen- 
tary education shall be compulsory’’? Is the 
Declaration excluding the rights of children - expression. 
{or their parents) not to be compelled if they 
so choose? 
| know the argument that where education 
is not compulsory poor communities have no 
choice but to put their children to work 
rather than sending them to school, but who 
is to say that they are wrong in so doing? | 
think a clause insisting on compulsion has no 
place in a document dealing with human 
rights. 
Sheila M.S. Thomson 
London, U.K. 
Editor's note. Prof. K. Vasak, Director of 
Unesco’s Division of Human Rights and 
Peace, replies: 
. The problem of negative human rights is a 
formidable one. If we have the right to live, 
should we not also have the right to die? If 
we have the right to marry, do we not also 
have the right not to marry? 
But if we all have the right to freedom and 
personal security, we certainly do not have 
the right to renounce this right and opt for 
slavery. 
What this boils down to is that the interna- 
tional community, rightly or wrongly, consi- 
ders that certain human rights involve not 
only individuals but also the society at large. 
Consequently, the international community 
insists that such rights be exercised (or not 
be exercised) in a certain way. The right to 
education is one of these. The international 
community is convinced that, to be a human 
being worthy of the name, a person must 
benefit from primary education: hence pri- 
mary education should be compulsory. The 
problem is similar to that posed above with 
respect to freedom and security of the per- 
son, and their negation— slavery. 
Obviously, one does not have to agree 
with the international community. In disa- 
greeing, Miss Thomson is exercising her 
human right to freedom of opinion and   


### 45917: Sadriddin Ayni, a great Central Asian poet of freedom

Sadriddin Ayni 
A great Central Asian poet of freedom 
PRIL 1978 marks the centenary of the 
birth of Sadriddin Ayni, a great and 
original writer who wrote in two 
languages—Tadzhik and Uzbek—hoth of 
which are spoken in his native region of 
Bukhara (in what is today Soviet Central 
Asia). The works of Sadriddin Ayni, who 
died in 1954, are widely read in the U.S.S.R., 
where they have been translated into 36 lan- 
guages. But even outside the U.S.S.R., 
there had been 300 publications of his 
works by 1970. 
The son of a craftsman, he was orphaned 
at 11 years of age, and in order to continue 
his studies in a madrasah (a, Muslim reli- 
gious school) he worked as a street swee- 
per and a porter, and took a number of 
other jobs. When he was 18, he began to 
write poems, many of which were inspired 
by popular festivals and fairs. 
An educator as well as a poet, Sadriddin 
Ayni developed a critical attitude towards 
the feudal regime in Bukhara which altered 
the course of his life, In 1905 he headed a 
pioneering school in Bukhara which prac- 
tised new teaching methods, and when the 
schoo! was closed down by the clergy, he 
and his supporters organized clandestine

Sadriddin Ayni in 1925 
lessons for illiterate adults. Ten years later 
he was forced to flee from his native city 
because of his opposition to the regime. 
On his return to Bukhara in Spring 1917, 
he was arrested, brutally beaten and 
‘thrown into jail where he stayed until his 
release by the soldiers of the Revolution. 
But it was only after 1920 and the fall of the 
Emir of Bukhara that Sadriddin began to 
express himself fully and freely as a writer 
and an educator, taking an active part in the 
creation of the country’s first Soviet 
schools and writing a number of handbooks 
for teachers. 
But although Sadriddin Ayni was a poet, 
he was above all a writer of prose. His rich 
experience of life, his profound knowledge 
of the customs and traditions of Tadzhikis- 
tan and Uzbekistan and his constant stri- 
ving for freedom permeate all his work, 
from the stories in The Hangman of Buk- 
hara (1922) to his epic novel Slaves (1934- 
1935) and his four volumes of Memoirs 
(1948-1954), 
A humanist of encyclopaedic range 
Sadriddin Ayni unflaggingly pursued his 
work as an educator and writer until the 
end of his life. The first President of the 
Tadzhikistan S.S.R.’s Academy of Sciences, 
founded in 1951, he was also an honorary 
member of the Uzbekistan Academy of 
Sciences. B

In 1911, when this group posed on a French Farman plane for a 
souvenir photo, only eight years had elapsed since the first powered 
plane flight, but aviation had already made great progress. In that 
~ year, more than 1,350 planes were built around the world; piopeering
