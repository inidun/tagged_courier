In recent years a new expression 
—"“peace research”— has enter- 
ed the language. Peace re- 
search is a pioneer effort being 
made in different countries to 
analyse, scientifically, the vast 
complex of factors which influen- 
ce the stability of world order 
and the relationships between 
nations. It deals with all types 
of war: intentional, uninten- 
tional (war as a traffic accident) 
and civil wars. (See page 22)

MESSAGES 
TO THE STARS 
by D. M. A. Mercer 
I we woke up one morning to find, hovering 
over our city, a space-ship from a distant galaxy, 
we would no doubt view it with very mixed feelings. But 
after the initial surprise had subsided, the very practical 
question would arise how could we get in touch with its 
crew? If we did not, at best the ship might simply consider 
that there was nothing of interest in the vicinity and go 
away—and we would have lost an almost unique opportunity 
of immense potentiality. But at worst, the ship might have 
the means of destroying our whole planet. For a variety 
of reasons, we would find it imperative to communicate 
with the crew (or with the ship if, as may well be the case, 
it is an unmanned robot). 
But how should we start to communicate? Obviously there 
is no point in flashing English messages in the Morse code. 
What means should we use? Clearly this needs a good 
deal of thinking through, and it is this subject which | want 
to deal with—the basis of communication with alien 
intelligent beings (I use the word “alien” in the science- 
fiction sense; the inhabitant of another part of the physical 
universe who may have no necessary common physical 
traits with us). 
All we know about these people is that they are intelligent 
—they must be so, or they could never have built a space- 
ship. Any communication must be on the basis of our 
.common intelligence. This puts the problem in the best 
way—what is the basis, the lowest common multiple, if 
you like, of intelligence: something which is common no 
matter how much its physical vehicle changes. If we can 
understand this, we can understand how to communicate: 
in fact the two problems are bound up with each other. 
To start with our case of the space-ship which has 
appeared in our vicinity, we assume that its builders are 
(1) Intelligent; (2) At least as far advanced scientifically 
as we are, and probably much more so; (3) Interested in 
finding other intelligences. (This is probably a fair assump- 
tion, as they have apparently sent an exploring spaceship 
although it is not impossible that races who are completely 
withdrawn and introverted exist.) (4) Ready to communicate

Southampton (United Kingdom} is a specialist in acoustics.

and to receive signals, and also to try to interpret them. 
This last point is important, and it needs some discussing. 
The probe will obviously not expect communication in 
its own language. In fact, we must both seek a common 
language. This is rather like the problem set up in certain 
branches of game theory. You are to meet someone in 
London on a particular day, but neither of you has any 
knowledge of the time or place; you must choose not 
what seems obvious to you, but what you think he thinks 
you will choose in the situation in which you both are, etc. 
(You might in this case choose Piccadilly Circus at 12 noon, 
for instance.) 
To follow this thought up, we should ask what signals 
would show that we are intelligent, and would be so 
understood by the probe. Any signals we send must look 
artificial—space is full of light and radio waves, and our 
signals must clearly look as if they have not arisen from 
a natural source. 
| don’t want to spend time discussing the mechanics of 
signalling, except to say that we are limited, over long 
distances, virtually to two means: short-wave radio, and 
“laser” light beams. For most purposes it appears that 
radio is preferable. | might also remind you that such waves 
travel at the speed of light; so to communicate with a 
planet 10 light-years away, the round-trip signal would 
take 20 years! Clearly there is little scope for rapidly 
changing one's mind while conversing. 
In many cases, we are limited to sending a series of 
identical signals in time——i.e. a train of pulses of elec- 
tromagnetic energy, either radio beams or light beams. 
One such series which has been suggested is a series 
of prime numbers (numbers which have no factors, but 
are divisible only by themselves and 1). If we send pulses 
in groups of 1, 2, 3, 5 7, 11, 13, 17.. etc, they will 
clearly come from intelligent beings. No radio storms 
in the galaxy, or any other natural process, will produce 
prime numbers.

They might be indicated as in Fig. 1, in which we choose 
a fixed spacing in time for the pulses, indicated by the 
space between symbols. A-dot means the absence of a 
pulse, and a circle means a pulse.

How to devise an interplanetary signal 
We might also try a series of squares, 1, 4, 9, 16... or 
the digits of mw, the ratio of the circumference of a circle

Fig. 2 
to its diameter, 3.141.592... (Fig. 2). This, being a ratio, 
is independent of the units of measurement. It does however 
raise the sort of point which we will be considering again— 
can we assume that the circle is such a fundamental idea 
that any intelligent being, however alien, will know it? 
| think we can make this assumption; any being with any 
knowledge of working materials, such as constructing 
radio transmitters, must be familiar with the circle. 
At this stage it might be pointed out that we could 
make pictures. It has been suggested in the past that we 
should build an enormous chain of beacons over a large 
land-area, showing, for instance, Pythagoras’ theorem 
Fig. 3 
  
(Fig. 3). If a space-ship were hovering overhead, this 
would certainly be possible; although we might well want 
to indicate that we had progressed further than the ancient 
Greeks, and some more sophisticated diagram, of the sort 
to be discussed later, might be more appropriate. 
Such beacons however would be visible only to some- 
thing close at hand—an alien space-ship orbiting the 
earth, as | mentioned earlier. What if we tried to send 
signals to a distant planet? Is there any way in which 
we can send pictures to them? 
Before discussing this, perhaps we should consider 
two further fundamental points. One is that we assume 
other alien races have eyes, or at any rate some corres- 
ponding sense organs. The other is that they can understand 
pictures, which are two-dimensional representations of 
three-dimensional objects. 
Here again, we feel that a sense of vision must be 
essential to anyone with an advanced technology. Secondly, 
we feel that such an advanced technology must deal in 
pictures and diagrams. We may be wrong over this; there 
may be races dependent entirely on tactile senses dealing 
directly with three-dimensional objects. All we can say 
is that it seems unlikely: this is the sort of thinking we 
must however attend to if we are to establish a basis for 
a universal intelligence. 
While on this point, we ought to consider a little further 
the modes which intelligence can take. There may be 
some intelligent races which are completely withdrawn 
and introspective, wishing to have no contact with anyone 
outside. There may be others who are uninterested: they 
may have solved all their political and economic problems, 
and spend their time watching television. 
There are two other cases which may raise problems; 
one is the case of beings whose processes are very slow 
compared to ours. Although they may be intelligent, it 
would be virtually. impossible to communicate with them. 
The other is the case of a civilization well versed in the 
abstract virtues of goodness, truth and beauty, but without 
any technology. 
These would be difficult to communicate with—as a 
superior alien community would have found the classical 
Greeks—but | do not think there is an absolute bar. 
| don't consider that any entirely abstract philosophy can 
exist in isolation from the real world: even on this earth, 
our most idealist philosophers slip in ideas of material 
things—counting, for example—which they could not do 
if in fact mind were the only thing which existed. (And 
it is worth noting that the ancient civilizations have led, 
in time, to our technological one.) 
Returning to the problem of sending pictures, in fact it 
is not too difficult to do so by a series of pulses. Suppose 
we send a series as in Fig. 4. By itself it is not very

Alien races may not have the same sort of television 
of course—their sets may scan in a spiral—but we would 
think that they would be intelligent enough to try various 
ways of superimposing traces until they hit on a “meaning- 
ful” one. (Here again | am assuming that “meaningful” 
has the same connotation to any intelligent being—i.e. 
that the ideas of “random” and “ordered” are universal.)

CAN YOU DECIPHER 
THIS 
INTERPLANETARY 
MESSAGE ? 
In 1960, Ivan Bell, an English language teacher 
in Tokyo, heard about Project Ozma, a scien- 
tific plan for listening in for radio messages 
from outer space. To amuse his friends he 
_ devised a simple interplanetary message of 
24 symbols. It was printed in The Japan 
Times of January 22, 1960. and readers were 
asked to decipher it. The newspaper received 
four complete solutions, including one from 
a U.S. reader who wrote her answer in the 
same code, adding that she lived (by Jove!) 
on Jupiter. Here we reproduce Ivan Bell's 
lighthearted exercise in coding an interplane- 
tary message. The message is extremely 
simple to decipher; far far simpler than it 
looks. All readers are urged to try their hand 
at it—and if they fail, let them ask their 
children to help. Three words of advice: 
(1) Don’t be afraid to use paper and pencil. 
(2) When you've found the solution you won't 
have to ask, “Is. this it?" ; you'll know you have 
the answer. (3) The key to the solution is to 
be found in paragraphs 2 and 3. Paragraph 1 
simply lists the alphabet (minus letters O and 
X). Answers will be published next month. 
Punctuation marks are not part of the 
message but indicate time lapses. 
repeating this series many times. If you count the total 
number of symbols, (i.e. circles + dots) it comes to 203. 
This is a number which can be decomposed in only one 
way, 7 xX 29. If we do split it up in this way, in a rectan- 
gular array 7 xX 29 we arrive at Fig. 7.

Fig. 7 
Of course this expression 1 + 2 = 3 would mean 
nothing as it stands, but | am simply indicating that it is 
possible to send pictures using a train of pulses; and the 
pictures could of course be much more complex than 
this. What in fact should we send? | mentioned that we 
wanted something more advanced than Pythagoras’ theo- 
rem. One subject we do know about is the way in which 
atomic nuclei can be split up in reactions taking place in 
stars. One such reaction, believed to be correct, is when 
lithium and hydrogen combine to form carbon and helium.

If we indicate this as shown in Fig. 8, in which the 
single and double circles represent two different types of 
elementary particles in the nuclei, it is probable that it 
will be recognised. (Of course we would use predeter- 
mined signs for the plus and equals.) The alien races 
will then know that we understand stellar reactions. We 
could send diagrams of the carbon cycle, indicating that 
we live on the basis of carbohydrate chemistry. We 
should perhaps send diagrams of our local constellation 
and solar system. 
Apart from all this, once one can send pictures the 
problems become standard ones of education and logic. 
It is however a fascinating idea to compile an educational 
series on “All about us and our world—for someone who 
has never seen any of it." Think of putting together the 
whole sum of human experience and existence in a series 
of programmes. | would like to see some television series’ 
experts try it. 
Quite apart from the problem of sending information, 
however, there is the problem of listening. Suppose other 
advanced galactic communities are trying to beam infor- 
mation at us? What should we be listening for? 
Once again we are considering intelligent signals, differ- 
ing from the natural signals in the universe. There is one 
way in which perhaps detection can be made easier,

without examining every one in detail. Fig. 9 shows the 
forms of two types of signal: (a) is noise, (b) is man-made. 
The time spent by each near its zero line is quite different: 
(a) spends a large proportion of its time near its zero-line, 
the proportion becoming less the further away it gets:

line. The test, in other words, to distinguish between

MONG the rugged green hills 
near Arecibo, Puerto Rico, 
scientists and engineers have built the 
world’s largest radio-radar telescope. Its 
bowl-shaped reflector, which lines a vast 
natural hollow in the hills, is a taut ex- 
panse of steel mesh covering over 18 
acres. Five hundred feet above it, sus- 
pended from cables supported by three 
tall towers, is a 550-ton complex of gir- 
ders, wires and machinery. This is the 
telescope’s focusing device. A 96-ft (30 
metre) metal finger points downwards to 
send radio waves to the mesh which then 
reflects them into outer space. When 
these reflected waves strike something 
they bounce back. Scientists analyze the 
returning signals for information about 
the object encountered in space. The 
equipment operates as a radio telescope 
when only the reflector (antenna) and 
receiver are used; as a radar telescope 
when short pulses of radio waves from 
a transmitter are distributed over the 
reflector. A beam of pulses is directed 
to a target in space, and when they 
bounce back the reflector is used a 
second time to receive them. The tele- 
scope was originally designed for studies 
of the ionosphere, the rarefied outer 
atmosphere of the earth, but is now being 
used also for radar exploration of the 
solar system and for receiving radio sig- 
nals from some of the most distant 
objects known to astronomers. The great 
potentialities of radio astronomy for 
revealing the large-scale structure of the 
universe became fully appreciated in the 
1950s, when it was discovered that some 
of the most intense celestial radio 
emitters, hitherto known as “radio stars” 
were, in fact, galaxies so distant as to be 
on the verge of detectability with the 
largest optical telescopes. As Sir Ber- 
nard Lovell, director of the Jodrell Bank 
Radio Astronomy Laboratories in Eng- 
land, points out in the December, 1965 
issue of Science Journal, published in 
England, for nearly 20 years the combined 
work of the optical and radio astronomers 
has. been revealing a cosmos of ever 
increasing fantasy. The penetration into 
space had increased so rapidly that 
already in 1960 it became possible 
to identify a radio galaxy (3C295) 4,500 
million light years distant from the earth, 
  
Left, general view of the Arecibo 
radio-radar telescope. 
Its giant bowl-shaped 
reflector, covering 
over 18 acres (7 hectares), 
Is made up of some 
11,000 sections of 3 In. 
(1.25 em.) thick wire mesh. 
Suspended above the centre 
is the focusing device 
weighing 500 tons 
(close-up photo right) 
which can be moved about 
to allow the telescope 
to scan a large area of sky. 
The telescope's position,

enables it to reach 
all the planets, 
for at that latitude 
they pass high overhead.

natural and artificial is a statistical one, and can readily 
and quickly be applied, without studying each signal in 
detail. 
| might point out that we could learn a good deal about 
the other planet just by the character of the radio signals, 
quite apart from their information content. If the signals 
appear at more or less fixed intervals, we might assume 
that this represents the length of their day. The basic 
frequency of their radio signal will slowly change, due to 
the transmitter moving towards and away from us, due 
to the rotations of the planet on its axis and about its star 
(this is the well-known Doppler effect) From a study of 
this frequency, we could deduce these quantities, and 
hence find something about their planet's behaviour. We 
might even, from this, be able to identify their star. 
It is necessary to digress to consider just how many 
advanced communities there may be, as the type of signal 
received (or the type we send) does depend on it. 
As far as we know, a small fraction of stars have 
planets. For any planet to be able to support 
life, it must be neither too hot nor too cold because life 
depends on chemical reactions, which will proceed too 
slowly at low temperatures, and will not proceed at high 
temperatures because substances decompose. (We know 
that the whole universe is made of the same materials we 
are familiar with, and the same general laws of chemistry 
apply.) 
Thus only a fraction of planets will be at the appropriate 
distance from their stars. Further, only certain types of 
star are suitable; they must give a constant energy output 
over the biological time-scale. 
When all this has been worked out, the next problem is 
how long may technologically advanced communities exist, 
compared with the whole time life has existed on their 
planet? This is a matter for speculation: perhaps by 
sociologists. In our own case, for instance, we have had 
radio for only some 60 years, while life has existed over 
the vastly longer biological life-time scale. 
If we can imagine advanced communities existing for 
much longer than our 60 years, we arrive at the quite 
speculative figure that there may be some hundred million 
advanced communities throughout our universe (taking the 
number of stars in the universe to be denoted by a 1 fol- 
lowed by 21 zeros, i.e. one thousand million million million). 
The general thinking in this section will be seen to stem 
from one aspect of the “cosmological principle”— namely, 
that there is no reason to assume that we on this earth 
are unique, or specially privileged in any way. 
This is not a very useful figure, because many of those 
communities will be immense distances away. But to come 
nearer, within 15 light-years of us there are seven “suit- 
able” stars; within 50 light-years there are 100 “suitable” 
stars. That is, there is a small probability that some 
advanced communities are within hailing distance. 
There is another conclusion to be drawn, however. The 
lifetime of a technological community is probably so much 
longer than the time we have had modern technology, 
that nearly all the galactic communities are far more 
advanced than we are. They may already be in a “galac- 
tic" club, busy communicating; and they may maintain a 
small subdepartment who are beaming messages at other 
likely stars in the hope that they may discover some novice 
community, just on the threshold of interstellar communi- 
cation, to whom they can send their kindergarten messages 
and gradually educate to their standards. It is a humbling 
thought. 
What all this means in practice is that we might find 
that any other community could pay very little attention 
to us. They may have thousands of likely stars to send 
signals to; as they would not have vast numbers of trans- 
mitters, we might receive signals only 1 day in 100 years 
(and they might have been doing this for thousands of 
years, of course without result). 
This situation is perhaps rather pessimistic, because in 
fact a much better way for any community to explore is 
not to send signals, but to send unmanned space-ships, 
or “probes”. These would be loaded with computers and 
recorded material, ready to give us information about them 
and to record the information we send them. A superior 
community might be able to spray thousands of such 
probes into the galaxy with pre-programmed instructions 
to listen for any radio waves, and “home” on any planet 
sending them out. 
What would such a probe do? It would circle a planet, 
picking up radio waves. How would it make itself known? 
This raises another basic problem; how you get people to 
perceive the unexpected, and not to dismiss it just as 
interference? 
One suggestion which has been made is that the probe 
would send back a replica of any message it received. 
This is good technology, because the senders of the signal 
would probably also be listening on this frequency. There 
is in fact a case of some long-delayed echoes in a radio 
transmission investigation about 30 years ago, which have 
never been explained. 
It is entertaining to speculate that they might have been 
picked up by an exploring probe, which has relayed the 
information back to its planet, many light-years distant; 
a further message may be even now on its way to us. 
(The delay is because, as pointed out earlier, no signal 
can travel faster than light: so that if a planet is 20 light- 
years away, it would be 40 years before a response to 
the first signal was heard.) 
I is worth closing with the question, assuming 
that the sort of exploring probe | have discussed 
may come to us one day, should we learn to listen or 
learn to send? There is already a listening station in the 
U.S.A. which has searched—without result so far—for 
intelligible radio waves from some nearby stars. 
Listening is exciting work: it has an appeal. Sending 
information is not so appealing: you can do it for a long 
time with nothing to show for it. But it seems to me that 
it might be far more important. It is unlikely that a probe 
will yield up its stored information unless we interrogate 
it properly; and we should surely, besides giving informa- 
tion about ourselves, want to ask questions of the advanced 
communities—such as how to conquer cancer. (For it is 
worth noting that the interchange of information in this 
way is an entirely benign activity.) 
| think we should spend time and energy on studying 
how to send, and what to send—to be ready for the 
opportunity when it comes. For although the probability 
of success in communicating with alien communities is 
very small indeed, the probability of success if we do 
nothing about it is precisely zero. 
The above article is the text of an address delivered by Dr. Mercer 
at the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of 
Science, held in Southampton, England, last year.

### 12625: New patterns of transport for Africa

  
NEW PATTERNS 
OF TRANSPORT 
FOR AFRICA 
by W. H. Owens 
i N recent years an entirely new pattern of trans- 
port has emerged in Africa and Asia where, 
the development of modern communications is a matter of 
vital concern to the young independent nations. (See “The 
Great Asian Highway", Unesco Courier, June 1965.) 
Future progress and prosperity in these countries will 
depend primarily on the exchange of materials, goods and 
services both with their neighbours and with peoples over- 
- seas. This means that they must be served by good inter- 
national road networks, linking the main cities, ports and 
production areas, and by deep water harbours capable

of accommodating large ships and handling all types of 
cargo with speed and economy. 
In the past, the African and Asian transport systems 
were based principally on the routing of export produce 
and minerals as directly as possible from their source to 
shipping points on the coasts. The railways and roads 
constructed in the days of colonial rule were designed 
first and foremost for this purpose. Consequently there 
were no transport links across frontiers between the 
main centres of neighbouring territories, except where they 
happened to be provided by natural waterways.

A big industrial complex is now growing up around Accra, capital of Ghana, 
thanks to the nearby new port of Tema with its ultra-modern installations, 
and also to the completion of a great dam across the Volta River. 
The first two turbines of the Volta hydroelectric installations,

which began to operate in August 1965, are now supplying electricity to a wide area. 
Here, a surveyor signals to his partner on one of Ghana's 
new construction sites near the Volta River. 
NEW PATTERNS OF TRANSPORT (Contd) 
Through jungles and desert wastes 
Today the development of new means of transport is 
strikingly evident in such a region as West Africa, where 
a large number of former colonial territories have achieved 
independance since World War Il. 
Modern industrial plants have been established to process 
the crops and raw materials from farms, mines and forests, 
and the various countries are eager to develop reciprocal 
trade with their neighbours. Such trade can grow and 
prosper only if there are modern inter-territorial communi- 
cations. 
Over the past four years successive conferences have 
been convened by the U.N. Economic Commission for 
Africa (ECA) to discuss proposals for building international 
highway systems to serve the main geographical regions 
of the continent and provide easy access between them. 
At the first meeting of West African Transport and Works 
Ministers, held at Monrovia (Liberia) in 1961, agreement 
was reached on the basic routes for a regional highway net- 
work of some 14,000 miles. This will link the capital cities and 
major centres of all territories, reaching east to the Sudan 
frontier and south to the Congo. Since then, ECA experts 
have made detailed studies of West African transport 
problems and the special transport needs of the land- 
locked countries of the region. 
In 1962 ECA sponsored the first East African transport 
conference at which an international road system for this 
region, including all countries from Sudan in the north to 
Mozambique in the south, was agreed to. Economic and 
technical surveys of alternative routes, particularly over the 
main existing gap between Khartoum and Nairobi, are now 
under way. 
Both East and West networks will link up at many points, 
so that eventually it will be possible to drive the width of 
the continent on continuous metalled roads. Construction 
of some of the new inter-territorial routes are already 
under way—for example, the first all-weather highway 
between the Ivory Coast and Ghana was started early in 
1964—but the task is an immense one that will keep highway 
engineers busy in Africa for a long time ahead. 
With the major oil developments in the Sahara, the linking 
of this vast and potentially rich region to the rest of Africa 
has assumed growing importance. Desert highway cons- 
truction has so far been limited to the essential transport 
needs of the oil and natural gas bases. But a considerable

mileage of these modern oil roads—the first ever to be 
built across the barren desert wastes—uwill be incorporated 
in the proposed trans-Saharan Highway which will link the 
Mediterranean ports of Africa to the interior, and especially 
the land-locked south Saharan states of Mali, Niger, Chad 
and Upper Volta. 
The trans-Saharan Highway project was discussed by 
transport specialists from ten African countries at an ECA 
conference held at Algiers in May, 1964. Agreement was 
reached on a north-south route through the heart of the 
desert to join up with the road network of West Africa. 
This would take the form of an inverted letter Y on the 
map, stretching south from the Mediterranean coast at 
Algiers, via El Golea and In Salah, to Tamanrasset in the 
Hoggar mountains. : 
From Tamanrasset there would be two branches; one 
to Gao, in Mali, which could be extended through Upper 
Volta to Ghana; the other to Agades, in Niger, which would 
join up with the trunk road system of Nigeria. There 
would also be two feeder roads at the Mediterranean end, 
one from Morocco and one from Tunisia, both joining 
the main trans-Saharan route at Tamanrasset. 
A four-nation committee, consisting of Algeria, Tunisia, 
Mali and Niger, is now studying the plans for this great

by on a metalled highway which crosses an ancient trail 
near the Awash River in Ethiopia. 
highway project which, at a conservative estimate, will 
cost in the region of $126 million. 
Delegates to all recent African transport conferences 
“have stressed the need for standardization, not only as 
regards road and bridge design but in such matters as vehi- 
cle legislation, traffic signalling and safety devices, and the 
classification of through highway routes. 
Another problem being studied is the simplification of 
existing frontier formalities—or where possible, their aboli- 
tion. Without such reforms the immense value of the 
international roads to future trade and tourism in Africa 
could be seriously jeopardized. 
Both African and Asian countries alike are too poor to 
finance these urgently needed highways from their own 
resources. So help is being provided on a generous scale 
through agencies such as the U.N. Special Development 
Fund and the World Bank. The World Bank has already 
produced loans of well over a thousand million dollars for 
highway development in nearly thirty countries, and most 
of this vast sum has been invested over the past five 
years. It has also sponsored transport surveys in India, 
Burma, Nigeria and other countries. 
Several important African highway projects are included 
in the twelfth annual programme of the U.N. Special Fund,

NEW PATTERNS OF TRANSPORT (Cont'd) 
Latest innovation: 
the ‘portless port’ 
which was approved by its governing council in January, 
1965. Among these projects are a study of highway 
development in Western Nigeria, the development of the 
highway system in Somalia, and a transport survey of the 
southern regions of the Central African Republic and 
Cameroon. The Special Fund provides for the services 
of consulting firms, experts, technicians and whatever 
equipment is required. 
Modern ports must also play a key role in the economic 
development of the emergent countries. Significantly, 
routes between ports and land-locked countries have 
high priority in the international highway programmes both 
of Africa and Southern Asia. 
Until quite recently there were very few modern deep- 
water harbours able to accommodate ocean-going ships 
around the African coastline. Apart from the ports of South 
Africa and the Mediterranean coast, most of the maritime 
trade was handled at the numerous surf ports which had 
served the African peoples for centuries, 
Overseas vessels which called at these surf ports had 
to anchor out in the roadstead while fleets of the traditional 
paddle craft carried the goods in relays between ship and 
shore. Quite obviously such an out-of date method has 
proved increasingly uneconomic in modern times, and as 
trade grew so did the delays to shipping. 
| N the years following World War Il, queues of 
ocean-going ships might be seen off the African 
surf ports awaiting their turn to discharge or load cargoes. 
Since then, however, the principal harbours on the east 
and west coasts have been dredged and deepened. Con- 
crete wharves with modern cargo transit sheds have been 
constructed to allow the direct berthing of deep-draft 
vessels, and electric cranes and other mechanized handling 
appliances have been progressively installed. As a result 
of the greatly improved rate of ship turn-round, overseas 
trade at these harbours has increased rapidly. 
The most important single maritime development in Africa 
during the past decade is Ghana's great new port of Tema, 
which has replaced the surf port of Accra a few miles away. 
Tema was officially opened in February, 1962, by President 
Kwame Nkrumah, who described the 80 million-dollar pro- 
ject as “a signpost to the future” for his country. 
Eastern Ghana now has a first-class modern seaport 
for handling large ships and all types of cargo—a facility 
which will assist the country’s development. Without it, 
the famous Volta River Project—Ghana’s largest single 
economic undertaking—could never have been started at 
all. 
Tema Harbour is nearly one mile in circumference and, 
with a water area of about 500 acres, is the largest man- 
made harbour around the African coastline. Eventually 
there will be twenty deep water berths for shipping and 
the port can handle up to a million tons of dry cargoes 
annually. There is a separate oil berth for ocean super- 
tankers of up to 35,000 tons. 
The benefits of this new African port are not to be 
confined to Ghana alone. Through the developing inter- 
national highways, other states in the region will be able 
to share its advantages and thereby develop overseas 
trade for the good of all. The extensive river systems of

These are capable

the communities of the hinterland a long way from the 
coast. 
West Africa will play their part too. 
One of the real handicaps to maritime development in 
the poorer countries of the world are the high costs both 
of building and operating a modern deep-water harbour. 
There is also an acute shortage of the various skills required 
to run a complex enterprise of this kind. 
These and other problems would suggest, perhaps, that 
the conventional type of seaport may not after all be the 
one best suited to the future needs of the emergent nations. 
The new trend of carrying cargo in bulk, and the ocean 
transport of goods in pre-packed containers, is already

making some of the long established operations at the 
world's docksides obsolete. In other words, many activities 
which are at present carried on in the vicinity of a ship's 
berthing place could be done with much greater economy 
in the areas to which most of the cargo is consigned or 
where it originated. 
One of the most interesting developments which could 
perhaps help to solve port problems in many developing 
countries is the offshore berthing platform, or loading 
tower—a conception which has been described, paradoxi- 
cally, as the “portless port”. Linking a ship with the store, 
and so to the connecting roads or railways, in the simplest 
possible way gives such installations great flexibility. 
For example, they can be set up as a shipping point as 
close as possible to newly exploited sources of raw mate- 
rials, and so reduce the cost of building long stretches of 
link roads or railways and of transport operations along 
these. Offshore platforms can be adapted for handling all 
types of ships and cargoes. 
Although the emergent nations of Africa and the Far 
East have many obstacles to overcome as they developed 
their land and sea communications, they do also have the 
advantages of an age of unprecedented technical and scien- 
tific progress and international co-operation. All the latest 
technical advances in every field of transportation, together 
with the means of financing them, are being made available 
to these young and advancing countries through the various 
specialist agencies of the United Nations.

### 13327: Dante: the primacy of poetry

  
The seventh centenary of the birth of Dante in 1265 was marked last year by celebrations the 
world over. In Paris, at the end of two sessions of round table discussions led by Profes- 
sor Vittore Branca of the University of Padua, Unesco organized a special commemorative 
ceremony on the evening of October 28 to honour the great poet. In the presence of the Minis- 
ter of Education of Italy, Mr. Luigi Gui, leading personalities of the world of letters paid tribute to 
the work of Dante and his continuing influence across the ages: Marcel Brion of the Académie 
Francaise spoke of four famous illustrators of Dante (Botticelli, Blake, Doré and Dali); the 
Italian poet Eugenio Montale spoke on “Dante, Yesterday and Today”; llya Ehrenburg on 
“The Poet's Universality”. and Mary McCarthy on “Dante’s Paradise and the New World". 
“If Dante seems so close to us today,” Unesco's Director-General, René Maheu, said in 
an introductory address, “it is partly perhaps because like our own generation, he lived in 
a time of wars, fratricidal strife and persecution. What we particularly admire in Dante is 
that amid the upheavals he lived through he maintained an unswerving faith in man, and suc- 
ceeded, misfortunes and calamities notwithstanding, in upholding the universal values 
which all men at heart hold dear.” And as Eugenio Montale pointed out: "Dante is the only 
great European poet of medieval times whose words have remained alive and meaningful even to 
those without special literary training.” It is precisely this universality of Dante’s writings and 
his relevance to our times that llya Ehrenburg stressed in his address, the most salient pass- 
ages of which are reproduced below.

DANTE 
by llya Ehrenburg 
| he greatness of Dante is 
evident, if only from the 
enthusiasm his work arouses in 
every part of our disunited world, 
whether among the inhabitants of 
inferno, real or imaginary, among those 
who do not regard themselves as 
living in purgatory, or among the illu- 
sory shades of paradise. 
Reading is an act of creation: every 
reader of the Divine Comedy brings 
to Dante's text something of himself 
—a fragment, as it were, of his cen- 
tury. There are thousands of commen- 
taries lined up on the library shelves. 
Dante is transformed into the hero of 
his own Comedy and is written 
about as freely as Hamlet is, or Don 
Quixote. Some represent him as a 
gloomy Scholastic, others as an im- 
passioned subversive figure bent on 
the demolition of various dogmas, 
others again as a visionary sage 
whom the Popes, by some oversight, 
failed to admit to the company of the 
saints. 
Dante Alighieri dreamed of posthu- 
mous fame, nor was he mistaken. 
Never has he been forgotten, except 
during a period which considered poe- 
try in bad taste; and in 1757, when the 
Italian Bottinelli wrote slightingly of the 
Divine Comedy, Voltaire declared 
that he admired his daring in calling 
Dante a madman, and his poem a 
monstrosity. 
With the advent of romanticism the 
curtain rose anew on poetry, and 
Dante's Comedy was "re-discovered”. 
Goethe, Novalis, Byron, Shelley and 
Pushkin, found it an inspiration. 
A torrent of commentaries poured 
forth. One book in particular, publish- 
ed in the middle of the 19th century, 
and dedicated to Pope Pius VI, 
intrigues me. The author, a devout 
Catholic, was a certain Eugéne Aroux, 
and the very title—“Dante, heretic, 
revolutionary and socialist™—bears 
witness to the exuberance of his 
imagination. But this is an exception. 
Most commentators, while disputing

Soviet writer and poet whose works have 
been translated in 60 languages. Among 
his works in English are “The Fall of Paris” 
(1942); “The Thaw" (1956) and “People 
and Life™ (1962). 
amongst themselves, endeavoured to 
claim Dante for their own faction; 
Catholics, atheists, royalists and 
republicans alike proclaimed him one 
of themselves. 
The controversy did not die. Those 
engaged in it were not, for the most 
part, lovers of poetry, but Scholastics 
of all persuasions. The end of the 
13th century and the beginning of the 
14th was a period of transition, which 
can be called either the late Middle 
Ages or else the dawn of the Renais- 
sance; thus it is easy to represent 
Dante looking to the past or to the 
future. 
The French historian, Jacques Le 
Goff, in his recent book “La Civilisa- 
tion de I'Occident médiéval” (medieval 
western civilization), calls the Divine 
Comedy a sublime poetical summing 
up of medieval learning and mentality, 
but one turned wholly towards the 
past; a magnificent monument of 
“reaction”. At the same time, dozens

of poetry 
Goff, describe Dante as a “human- 
ist”, a “philosopher of the Renais- 
sance” and “the father of individual- 
istic poetry”. 
In Soviet literature, we find similar 
polemics going on. In the 1920s, 
Vladimir Fritshe, one of the popular 
exponents of Marxism, flatly called 
Dante “an imperialist in the medieval 
sense of the term”—a judgement which 
was contested by Anatole Lunacharsky, 
who considered Dante “the greatest 
poet of the early Rendissance.” In 
1965, a literary critic and poet wrote 
that students of Dante in the Soviet 
Union are interested in him mainly as 
a “political thinker and a moralist”; 
yet a young Soviet political thinker and 
moralist has written an essay on the 
complexity, profundity and power of 
Dante—as a poet. 
If | have noted all these disputes, 
past and present, it is not because | 
myself intend to stick a new label on 
his portrait, or classify him in any par- 
ticular category. (Although Giotto, who 
knew him, has left us a portrait of 
Dante, | do not believe it is a true 
likeness: Giotto doubtless protrayed 
Dante in the same arbitrary terms as 
Dante described Beatrice... All that 
remains is Raphael's conventional 
profile of Dante, and the same des- 
cription of him occurs again and again 
even in Alexander Blok's poem—*the 
shade of Dante, with the aquiline 
profile.” Not a word about his face, 
only the nose resembling an eagle's 
beak: a convention. Pushkin speaks of 
“austere Dante”; Valery Bryusov 
calls him a “sombre hero of bygone 
years”.) 
| have referred to the thousands of 
commentaries, the controversies, past 
and present, simply as a pretext for 
speaking about Dante, not as a spe- 
cialist but merely as a reader and a 
writer of the mid-20th century. Need 
| say that | am drawn to Dante as a 
poet, and as a poet alone? We look 
at the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci 
for the aesthetic experience and visual 
pleasure, without reference to his work 
on engineering or anatomy: as we read 
Faust, we do not think of Goethe's 
studies on colour.

it unlikely his work could be translated, 
and he was no doubt right. 
Each generation has its own 
approach, and each reads Dante's 
Comedy in its own way. | would like 
to speak of what our generation finds 
most remarkable in the work of the 
great Florentine, as corresponding to 
our own excursions into inferno, pur- 
gatory and paradise. 
The first point | shall make is that 
he was not impartial; for this 
is something for which we Soviet 
writers have all too often been criti- 
cized. The term “committed” is applied 
to our poets with just a suggestion of 
mockery, and it is alleged to account 
for the failure of Soviet literature in 
the past forty years or so to attain the 
heights reached by the great Russian 
writers of the last century. But this 
explanation is not valid. 
| have had occasion to quote many 
writers who far from being hampered 
by their lack of impartiality, on the 
contrary found it an inspiration—as in 
the case of Stendhal, Dostoevsky and 
many others. 
But the best example of this is Dante 
himself. Not only did he not eschew 
politics: for long years of his life, 
indeed, he lived for politics, and it was 
on this account that he suffered exile: 
“Thou shalt make trial of how 
salt doth taste another's bread, 
and how hard the path to 
descend and mount upon 
another's stair” (Paradise, XVII 
58-61). 
It was during the years of struggle 
that the Divine Comedy was begun. 
Alighieri still continued to negotiate 
with other émigrés, the White Guelphs 
but, disillusioned, he turned increas-

DANTE (Cont'd) 
‘Masterpieces 
are born eternal’ 
ingly towards the Ghibellines, hoping 
for the intervention of Henry VII. In 
short, he never turned his back on 
politics, and the Divine Comedy is 
suffused with political passion. 
And Dante's partiality not only 
helped him to write the Comedy; it 
infused many a canto with passion and 
vitality. But who nowadays is really 
interested in the struggle between the 
Guelphs and the Ghibellines, except 
perhaps the Dante specialists who, 
though they have devoted their entire 
lives to studies of the poet, neverthe- 
less miss the very essence of his 
poetry? 
What degrades art is not tenden- 
tiousness, but the tendency to adulter- 
ate the essence of art. It is often 
salutary to recall the old adage that 
there is no point in using a violin for 
knocking in nails with, if only because 
it is better to use a hammer and 
because violins may come in useful on 
other occasions. Stendhal, who was 
as committed as any man could be, 
scribbled the following note in the 
margin of his manuscript of Lucien 
Leuwen: “ | must be careful not to let 
the man of politics eclipse the man of 
passion. The man of politics will be 
gone fifty years from now. All we 
need of him is what history finally 
judges interesting.” 
Dante succeeded in writing a poem 
which still" stirs the hearts of its 
readers not merely fifty, but six 
hundred and fifty years afterwards. 
What interests us are not the causes 
of the feuds, but the passions involved. 
| wanted to make this point because 
there are many purists whose criti- 
cism, just or unjust, of modern writers 
labelled “committed”, is based on 
these grounds alone. Yet the fact of 
expounding a cause has not prevented 
my contemporarles Mayakovsky, 
Eluard, Brecht, Aragon and Pablo 
Neruda from becoming great poets. 
One of the questions of interest to 
us today is that of the realism of 
Dante, the poet. The word “realism” 
may sometimes sound a trifle abstract, 
like the use of numbers in the Divine 
Comedy; it is disparaged or lauded, 
anathematized or sanctified, by turn.

### 13327: Dante: the primacy of poetry

As Beatrice leads 
Dante towards Paradise, 
he contemplates the souls 
of the blessed—a drawing by 
the ltalian painter, 
Sandro Botticelli (1444-1510). 
At Unesco’s commemoration 
of the seventh centenary 
of Dante's birth, 
Marcel Brion, the French author, 
analyzed the different ways 
in which great artists 
have illustrated the “Divine Comedy." 
Botticelli, in his view, was 
Dante's most faithful interpreter, 
and conceived his drawings 
“like the schema for a moving picture, 
five centuries before 
that art form was invented.” 
Guidottl, Rome 
| would like first of all to point out 
the error of certain historians who 
treat changes in artistic forms in the 
same way as if they were dealing 
with social progress or developments 
in the exact sciences. 
Stendhal, in his book on Italian 
painting, describes Giotto as a clumsy 
precursor of the great art of the 
Renaissance. Such was the generally 
accepted view during the first decades 
of the 18th century. Then came the 
time when the merits of the Quattro- 
cento were recognized. First, people 
became enamoured of Botticelli; then 
later Masaccio was “discovered” and 
it is now claimed that the work of 
this artist, who died young, contains 
all the seeds of modern painting. The 
same cannot, | think, be said of 
Raphael But does this make his 
frescoes any the less perfect? 
THe attitude to the painters 
of the past varies accord- 
ing to the particular tastes and aspi- 
rations of every epoch. Is Giotto to 
be labelled primitive because he lack- 
ed the eclectic academic skill of Guido 
Reni? What Giotto had to express 
was very different from the learning 
and the canons of the 17th century. 
Can the simplified forms of Picasso 
and Braque be attributed to inability to 
depict the universe in terms of a series 
of colour photographs? 
The Western world was evolving, 
the knowledge of geography, physics 
and astronomy expanding. In the 
13th century, the sculptors working on 
the Gothic cathedrals produced an 
encyclopedia, in plastic form, of the 
learning of their age, so that some 
of the figures in their bas reliefs may 
make us smile. For all that, these 
sculptors were no less skilled, indeed 
they were more so, than many of those 
working in the second half of the 
present century. 
Victor Hugo once wrote that science 
progresses constantly by a felicitous 
process of self-cancellation. Science, 
he said, is a ladder; poetry a winged 
flight... Masterpieces are born eternal. 
Dante does not cance! out Homer. 
 
Hugo knew that the Earth revolves. 
Our contemporaries have learned that 
infinity is not an abstract conception, 
but a reality. This invalidates Dante's 
cosmogony and cosmography, but 
detracts nothing from his poetry. 
Realism in art stems from the feeling 
of real life, nature and man; and in 
this sense Dante, like all true artists, 
was certainly a realist. We read his 
Divine Comedy with supreme interest 
even though the symbolism of 
numbers, the sanctity of the divers 
dogmas and Dante's dreams of a 
peaceful and just monarchy leave us 
cold. 
The picture Dante draws not only 
of inferno and purgatory but of 
paradise as well is based on the 
image of the Earth, on all that he 
himself has seen and lived through. 
It is true that the scenes he describes 
are drawn from fantasy, but is not 
fantasy, after all, part and parcel of 
the real world of man? Are not 
Gogol's "The Overcoat* and Kafka's 
"The Trial" in their way realistic? 
Dante's vision, permeating both the 
spiritual nature of the poet and the 
purpose of the Divine Comedy, may 
be described as realistic fantasy. Goya 
was endowed with stupendous fantasy, 
and his war scenes have nothing in 
common with the battle pictures 
painted by his contemporaries. But 
Picasso, in his "Guernica" gave us 
something different—a foreboding of 
Hiroshima. Dante, wandering through 
the world beyond the grave, has 
constantly before his eyes familiar 
scenes from life on Earth. He is a 
living person among the shades of 
the dead... 
Dante is a humanist and a realist; 
but he is, first and foremost, a great 
poet capable of transcending the 
bounds of both Christian dogma and 
naive realism. We have perforce to 
forgive him the incident of the 
discovery of a second, unknown world, 
for which Ulysses was so cruelly 
punished; and must accept the fact 
that Dante spent his life straying not 
only through the streets of ltaly, but 
also through the subterranean maze of 
obscure emotions. 
In purgatory, Dante meets the sing- 
er Casellz, whom he knew and loved 
on Earth; and begs him timidly: 
“If a new law take not from 
thee 
memory or skill in that song of 
love 
which was wont to calm my 
every desire, 
may it please thee therewith 
to solace awhile my soul...” 
(Purgatory II, 106-109). 
Whereupon Casella sings the love 
song from Dante's Convivio and the 
dwellers in purgatory, together with 
Dante and even the wise Virgil, listen 
enchanted until the guardian of the 
lost souls, Cato of Utica, the Stoic, 
who slew himself with his own sword 
after the defeat of the republican 
party, hustles up to chide the shades 
entranced by the sweet strains... 
“What is this, ye laggard spirits?... 
Haste to the mount”. And drives them 
back to their task. 
Wi now remains of the 
feud between Guelphs and 
Ghibellines, the religious dogmas, and 
the doctrines of Aristotle or Plato? 
Dante's Divine Comedy itself, the 
power and the music of his poetry 
—with all due deference to Cato of 
Utica and his like. 
Historians have indeed a difficult 
task. We feast on the miraculous 
apples, while they have to analyse the 
soil from which the apple-trees sprang. 
The Divine. Comedy ends with the 
famous line: 
“..The Love that moves the 
Sun and the other stars”. 
Every child now knows that Dante 
was wrong in thinking that the Sun and 
the other heavenly bodies revolve 
round the Earth; but every modern 
man with a spark of humanity in him 
knows in his heart that Dante was 
right, and that love indeed moves the 
Sun and the other heavenly bodies, 
including this planet, not very large 
it is true, but important none the less, 
the one which we call the Earth.

THE ROOTS 
OF PEACE 
by Bert V. A. Rolling 
A new expression has entered the language in recent years: “peace research”. 
Peace research deals not only with intentional war, but also with unintentional war 
(war as a traffic accident) and civil war. The growing interest in this new activity 
is conditioned by the nuclear arms situation which calls for a fundamental change 
in the traditional organization of international relations Unesco is helping to pro- 
mote the peace research movement, and gave its support to the first international 
conference of the International Peace Research Association, which took place in 
Groningen (Netherlands) in July 1965. This year, Unesco is sponsoring a series 
of studies on the economic and legal aspects of disarmament. Three inquiries 
into the social and economic consequences of disarmament will later be carried 
out under Unesco auspices in the Federal Republic of Germany, U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. 
Readers’ attention is drawn to a recent issue of Unesco’s quarterly, International 
Social Science Journal, devoted to Peace Research (Vol. XVII, No. 3, 1965) The 
complete text of the article below can be found in that issue.

T re term “peace research” is comparatively 
recent, as is the scientific interest in questions 
of war and peace which is emerging all over the world. 
This new interest is not surprising. It is linked up with 
the changes in the nature and dangerousness of war. 
Through these changes it has become possible, as is now 
realized, for our technically highly developed culture to be 
brought to ruin by its technology, through war. 
There has always been war. An historian has calculated 
that in 3,400 years of known history there have been 234 
years without a known war. A French sociologist, Gaston 
Bouthoul, has written a book entitled “8,000 Peace Treaties.” 
It is understandable enough that people should think that 
war is unavoidable in view of what human nature is. 
This idea of the inevitability of war has been expressed 
through the ages in the “cycle of war,” and is still alive 
in wide circles of the population. In 1696 “The Beehive,” 
by Francis Daniel Pastorious, described the cycle of war 
in rhyme: “War begets Poverty, Poverty Peace, then 
people will traffic and Riches increase. Riches produceth 
Pride, Pride is War's ground. War begets Poverty, So we 
go round.” It is also understandable that people should have 
made a virtue of necessity and have come to regard war 
as a good thing, as the supreme manifestation of humanity, 
as a cause of progress. 
BERT V. A. ROLING is secretary general of the International 
Peace Research Association. From 1950 to 1957 he was a mem- 
ber of the Netherlands Delegation to the United Nations General 
Assembly; he is now professor of international law and director 
of the Polemological Institute at the University of Groningen 
(Netherlands). 
This may be surprising, in view of the misery caused 
by war. But the dead are in their graves, and the cripples 
are kept more or less in the background when the war is 
over. The survivors usually regain their prosperity before 
long. That mankind has been able to thrive and prosper, 
despite our continual attempts on one another's lives, is 
not due to the wisdom of our ancestors, but to their ignor- 
ance of the possibilities of destruction. We no longer live 
in such ignorance. Technological evolution has now made 
total destruction of the adversary possible. 
War has changed its character primarily as a result 
of social changes in the last few centuries. There were 
times when it was waged with mercenary armies, later with 
national professional armies. The Napoleonic period saw 
the development of popular armies: the democratization of 
war. This also had its effect upon the nature of war; 
the limited war as waged by professionals had left open 
the possibility of a certain chivalrousness and a military 
code of honour. With the advent of the popular armies 
all this was changed. Churchill rightly asserted: “From 
the moment Democracy was admitted to, or rather forced 
itself upon the battlefield, War ceased to be a gentleman's 
game.” It came to be the total war, in which people 
stood facing each other. 
The technical evolution in armaments made this total war 
totally intolerable. There were revolutionary developments 
in explosive power, in range and in speed. The destructive 
power of weapons has become a million times intensified, 
their range spans the earth, their speed makes defence, 
effective protection against them, impossible. 
From a means of pitting one's strength against another, 
armaments have become a means of unrestricted mutual

THE ROOTS OF PEACE (Contd) 
Military strength and foreign policy 
destruction. This makes the total nuclear war an intolerable 
catastrophe. 
But will not this consequence tend to prevent war? 
The power of the state is political power, and “political 
power is not a power over nature, or material, or oneself, 
but over the minds and actions of other men.” Will not 
the result of this enormous military strength be that the 
adversary will no longer risk war? That is the doctrine of 
the “deterrent,” in which peace is sought through the threat 
of intolerable destruction. Through the “balance of terror” 
the intentional thermo-nuclear war certainly is excluded. 
Von Clausewitz described war as the continuation of 
foreign policy by other means: an attempt to achieve through 
military power what had proved impossible without use of 
force. Such views are no longer reasonably possible. The 
thermo-nuclear war is no longer a reasonable means of 
national policy. Possibly a smaller-scale war could still be 
considered as such; the “limited war” of nuclear powers 
or a war waged by ill-armed non-nuclear States. But in 
both cases there is the danger of “escalation,” of intensi- 
fication because the losing side resorts to ever bigger 
weapons (military escalation), or because nuclear powers 
become involved in the struggle for power between smaller 
states (political escalation). 
The thermo-nuclear war, in which the existence of peoples 
and their cultures is at stake, is only conceivable as a 
result of accident, miscalculation or escalation, as an unin- 
tentional war, as an accident in the hazards of interna- 
tional traffic. 
Military strength by its very nature has a great in- 
fluence on a country's foreign policy. Military strength 
opens up the possibility of a provocative, reckless foreign 
policy, of brinkmanship, in the confidence that the opposing 
side will not respond to the provocative policy with violence. 
Only if interests that are considered really vital are affect- 
ed can the inflexibility be expected which makes a country 
prepared to protect these interests by all means. But when 
is inflexibility certain? On this point there is uncertainty. 
N ATIONAL nuclear armament is already a risky 
foreign policy. Nuclear armament does prevent 
an intentional nuclear war, and is as such a factor of peace. 
But it also leads to reckless international policy, and—in the 
case of reliable “arms control"—enables a country to 
engage in “limited war.” Because of this it increases the 
risk of unintentional thermo-nuclear war, and does not 
ensure the lasting peace which is the vital interest of 
technically highly developed countries. National armaments 
do not provide the required national security, since they 
cannot prevent unintentional war, and cannot protect the 
civilian population in case of war, 
The increasing realization of the danger into which tech- 
nically highly developed cultures—and possibly all mankind 
—are being led by their technology is the chief motive for 
the present interest in peace research, 
There is yet another motive. That is the moral aspect 
of the present military situation. We have to do with 
weapons of wholesale destruction, and today some -of 
these weapons are aimed at the civilian population, at the 
great cities. “Counter-city strategy” is an official compo- 
nent of this strategy. 
The civilian population as a military target is a compa- 
ratively recent phenomenon. It seems that the practices 
of actual warfare have changed the traditional law of 
nations, and modern laws of war apparently sanction the 
destruction of open cities. But such methods of warfare 
are incompatible with what used to be regarded as the 
military code of honour: war was fought against soldiers, 
not against civilians, 
T HE “counter-city strategy” marks a lowering of 
this level of warfare. It is clear proof that the 
world wars did not only destroy material goods, but also 
spiritual values. But this lowering of moral standards hardly 
fits in with the great emphasis on human dignity in our 
culture. This recognition of human dignity is the most 
characteristic trait of our times, a recognition of dignity 
“without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion” 
(Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations). Weapons 
of wholesale destruction can hardly be reconciled with such 
recognition. One may readily concede that they work 
“without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.” 
But they are hardly compatible with respect for man and 
for human life. 
In other respects, too, the “counter-city strategy” runs 
counter to prevalent views and positive international law. 
In 1949, the Red Cross conventions, which re-formulated 
the laws of warfare, were concluded; under these conven- 
tions the taking of hostages was expressly forbidden 
(Article 34, Geneva conventions relative to the protection 
of civilian persons in time of war). But in the "counter-city 
strategy” the civilian population as a whole is a hostage 
for the good conduct of its government. “Hostageship” 
has not disappeared: indeed it has been extended and 
democratized! 
This paradoxical situation is cited to demonstrate that 
the arms situation has become morally intolerable, and 
degrading for the cuiture in which it appears. The “coun- 
ter-city strategy” undermines the cultural values which 
it is supposed to defend. 
Many writers have been most outspoken in their condemn- 
ation of the weapons of wholesale destruction. The ques- 
tion is, what consequences follow from this condemnation? 
Unilateral disarmament? Some draw this conclusion. It 
is the emotionally understandable answer to a situation 
which is felt to be morally unjustifiable. But it is an 
extremely unwise answer. It should be realized that the 
arms situation has grown to what it is now through a 
process lasting over many centuries. 
We must take as our starting-point the situation in which 
history has placed us: a world grown accustomed to think- 
ing in terms of the balance of power. A sudden disturb- 
ance of this pattern might have disastrous effects. The 
non-disarmed adversary—now unassailable in his power— 
would no longer be held in check in his foreign policy by 
the power of his opponent, and would resort to a reckless 
foreign policy which would be felt as intolerable by the 
other side. This would very soon result in a tendency 
towards rearmament. But this again might lead to pre- 
ventive action. Thus unilateral disarmament might pro- 
mote war, and encourage the use of nuclear weapons. 
The realization that our armaments provide no security, 
and that they morally undermine our culture, can only lead 
us to strive for collective disarmament.

Unesco-Dominique Roger 
PEACE IN JAPANESE 
This Japanese character engraved 
on the huge fountain-rock 
in the garden at Unesco's H.Q. 
signifies “peace”. 
It is derived from an ancient 
Chinese character depicting 
a grain stalk (on right) 
and a mouth (lower left). 
General disarmament is no small problem. It can only 
be achieved very gradually and with great caution. But 
it is only through this approach that it will be possible to 
attain lasting peace; and this will involve great changes 
in the position of the national state and a great strength- 
ening of the world organization which must largely take 
over its security function. 
Complete disarmament under international control, with 
appropriate provisions to take over the earlier function of 
threat and violence, confronts the world with unprece- 
dented problems, It will strike at the root of a pattern of 
life as old as humanity itself. This change cannot be 
achieved by activity based on intuition. Up to the present 
day existing peace movements—and how popular they    
were, especially between the two world warsl—have 
shown no practical results whatever. 
Good intentions are not enough. The catch-phrases 
of 19th-century peace movements—disarmament and de- 
colonization—as they were given expression in the resolu- 
tions of the conferences organized by the Bureau de la 
Paix were correct. But the question of how such a result 
could be attained was scarcely put. It would probably have 
been unattainable then, too. 
The Covenant of the League of Nations (Article 8) stated 
that “the maintenance of peace required disarmament”, 
but this only implied a “reduction of national armaments 
to the lowest point consistent with national safety”. Consid- 
ering that the preservation of the colonial system was 
impossible without arms this was an empty phrase, an 
official truth which came distressingly near common 
deception. 
The nuclear weapons have opened our eyes to the neces- 
sity of disarmament. The Charter of the United Nations 
hardly concerned itself with disarmament. It refers primar- 
ily to collective security. But then the Charter dates from 
the pre-atomic age. Nuclear technology necessitates nation- 
al disarmament, makes it imperative to change the present 
system, under which military power is the hard core of 
relations between States. 
This may be required by the actual situation, but how 
can it be realized? The more one occupies oneself with 
the problem of disarmament, the more strongly one is 
impressed by its unprecedented complexity. One is driven 
to the conclusion that today a good deal of “official 
truth” is expressed in statements about general complete 
disarmament, which is not always sincerely meant, and 
which sometimes serves to mislead the masses. 
T HE effects of disarmament will be extremely far- 
reaching. It follows that disarmament can only 
be achieved very gradually. What are the appropriate first 
steps? How is the process to proceed? What constructive 
measures will have to accompany each stage of the 
breaking-up of the national military machinery? 
These are technical, military questions, economic and 
social problems. But the greatest problems at this point 
are political ones. They concern the attitudes of govern- 
ments and of the masses. For the solution of these 
problems scientific research is indispensable. 
The moral rejection of the arms situation, which is prima- 
rily based on the existing weapons of mass destruction— 
but which strikes at the root of the whole traditional military 
organization—is another motive for the present interest in 
peace research. 
A third motive may be mentioned. History shows us 
that the size of the political unit in which man seeks pro- 
tection against enemies from outside has been more or 
less dependent upon the range and penetration of the 
existing weapons. The fortress, the town, the county, had 
to disappear as distinct political units because they could 
no longer be defended. The range and penetration of 
modern rockets make the state a unit which can no 
longer be defended. Even regional groups are no longer 
capable of such defence. Modern weapons with their 
world-wide capacity necessitate some form of world-wide 
organization, which takes over the security function of 
the states. 
The age of nuclear weapons and rockets—an age in 
which the national state has a greater military potential 
at its disposal than ever before, but can no longer guar-

THE ROOTS OF PEACE (Cont'd) 
The science of waging peace 
antee security—is also an age in which far-reaching 
changes must be effected in the current international organ- 
ization. This is a task which cannot possibly be achieved 
by statesmen with a short-term policy based on conven- 
tional wisdom. The task requires extensive scientific 
preparation, not only with regard to the system that would 
eventually have to be established, but also with regard 
to everything that would be needed to make populations 
prepared to accept the ultimate goal. 
In earlier times, many studies on war were published. 
Indeed there exist a great many books about the causes 
of war. They are worth while. But it should be borne in 
mind that most of these earlier works deal with war as it 
was understood by Von Clausewitz, that is to say inten- 
tional war, and pay little attention to unintentional war, 
war as a traffic accident. 
The old theories often lay the responsibility for war at 
the door of small groups, such as ambitious kings, war- 
like generals or profit-seeking arms manufacturers. If 
one asks after the cause of the unintentional war—and 
this implies asking after the cause of risky foreign policy 
—one is more likely to find it in very general factors, 
current habits of thought and action. It then becomes 
clear how fatal traditional habits and attitudes can be. 
The cause of war is closely linked with the existing general 
situation. All this indicates the democratization of the 
cause of war. 
If this is so, it makes the problem even more difficult. 
So long as the fault lies with small élite groups, it is pos- 
sible to attempt to counteract their influence. But if we 
have to do with attitudes and views which are deeply 
embedded in the people as a whole, it is so much more 
difficult to find ways of bringing about conditions for a 
lasting peace. 
It should also be recognized that as yet we know only 
very little about the factors which lead to risky foreign 
policies. Here too—as in the problem of the cause of 
the intentional war—we have to do with a combination 
of factors originating with the individual, with the state 
and with the world. Is war unavoidable because man is 
by nature aggressive? What gives rise to this aggressive- 
ness? Is it an essential component of human life, or a 
reaction against frustration, or a cultural phenomenon, 
acquired by imitation and adaptation to an existing pattern? 
What is the effect of pornography intermingled with 
violence, of films featuring violence? 
And what about the factors in the state? What part is

A ND what factors govern the relations between 
states? Are these primarily determined geo- 
politically? Is overpopulation the all-important factor, as 
Bouthoul thinks? What part is played by history here? What 
are the origins of the stereotyped notions that peoples have 
about one another? Is a disappearance of the general 
distrust of foreign states possible? Is competition still more 
profitable than co-operation? And if not, how can the 
current pattern of competition be modified?

mented with hundreds of others. 
simply to show that many disciplines will have to co- 
operate to yield some insight: psychology, history, econo- 
mics, sociology, legal science, and even theology and art 
history, for the Church and the arts play an important 
part in attitudes and views held by individuals and groups. 
These attitudes and views are of the greatest importance 
with respect to war and peace. Here, too, it is essential 
to emphasize, besides the concept of “intentional war”, 
the importance of the “unintentional war.” Gradually, 
there is developing a general feeling against war; there is 
a growing aversion to war. But this is not yet the case 
with “risky foreign policies.” In the matter of foreign policy, 
many things are still as they always were: security through 
national or regional power, and occasional provocation if 
the other party can be expected to give in out of fear. 
It is an attitude which gives insufficient attention to the 
concept of “unintentional war.” 
| N this context | would briefly note that as war 
recedes into the background as a result of the 
arms situation, world organization and war prohibition, civil 
war acquires greater importance. A civil war is often a 
limited “war by proxy,” in which it is the outsiders who give 
an originally purely domestic conflict its international 
aspect, and contribute to its prolongation and intensification. 
Civil war, too, falls within the scope of the science of war 
and peace. 
What system of world order would have to be set up 
to prevent (total) war? 
What are the requirements that would have to be met by 
an effective peace policy? What is needed to ensure the 
safety of international traffic? It stands to reason that 
sacrifices will have to be made for peace, both in the 
material and in the spiritual sphere. In the long run 
war is inevitable if the gap between rich and poor countries 
continues to widen, as it is now doing. Hence the need 
for intensive activity to raise the standard of living in 
the developing countries. It cannot be denied, however, 
that economic changes in these countries will also entail 
great social changes, with ali the unrest and aggressiveness 
that go with them. 
It is important to arrive gradually at a clear idea of 
the nature of a disarmed world. It goes without saying 
that material sacrifices will be necessary. It is easily said 
that of course peace has its price. But it is not only a 
matter of material “sacrifices.” Concessions will also have 
to be made in spiritual matters. There will be opposition 
to overcome for the very reason that the spiritual climate 
in a disarmed world will necessarily differ from the present 
climate. This will not tend to make things easier. 
The traditional attitude is a facile one which is deter- 
mined only by the views current in one's own circle, which 
takes a black-and-white view of’ right and wrong accord- 
ing to the views prevalent there, and is prepared to 
risk war for what is felt to be right. A world-wide security 
system involves entering into a larger whole, a recog- 
nition of the right of “foreign” views to "exist, an atti- 
tude of tolerance towards others, of give-and-take, a willing- 
ness to act reasonably and to compromise. 
To form an idea of what is needed for maintaining peace 
is important also because by so doing we make it clear to

THE WHITE BIRD, an etching and aquatint 
by the French painter, Georges Braque, 
one of 12 works executed 
by the artist when he was 80 (in 1962) 
for a remarkable art book, 
“The Order of Birds”. 
To accompany the engravings, 
the French poet and Nobel 
prizewinner, St. John Perse, 
wrote a poetical meditation on birds, which 
he said, “preserve among 
us like a very pure echo 
something of the song of creation.” 


### 15029: Beauty and the beast: man through his art

by Pauline Bentley 
Man through his art 
BEAUTY AND 
THE BEAST 
T Hrouarour every de- 
gree of civilization and 
beyond the division of time and envir- 
onment, race or culture, man has al- 
ways known one perennial link of 
common experience: his world has 
been the dwelling place also of ani- 
mals. 
Since his earliest’ beginnings he has 
used these sharers of his planet to 
help him on the long haul of human 
progress. They have provided him 
with food and warmth and weapons. 
He has domesticated them and put 
them to work for him in peace and 
war; he has used them in his quest 
for knowledge and mastery; he has 
formed societies to protect and hunt 
them, to study and worship them; 
there is no facet of his endeavours 
whether for sport, magic, sustenance 
or learning that has not been affected 
by the existence of animals. 
During this long and ancient part- 
nership man the artist has also fed 
his imagination and sought inspiration 
from the same source. He has taken 
whatever implement lay to his hand to 
depict the animals around him and in 
so doing he has interpreted them not 
only to himself and us, but left behind 
a unique personal testimonial. 
“It is the achievements in the visual 
arts that have survived,” writes Miss 
Jacquetta Hawkes, the celebrated 
archaeologist, “which brings us the 
first insights into the imaginative lives 
of our primitive forebears.” Miss 
Hawkes is writing here on the Palaeo- 
lithic cave paintings in the Dordogne, 
France, in the opening chapters of

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (Cont'd) 
Imagery 
of beliefs 
myths and ideals 
as discussed by Professor Frangois 
Chamoux of the Sorbonne in Paris in 
this book, is very distant in every 
aspect except as subject matter, from 
the Horse of Commarque, a seven foot 
long relief made some 13,000 years be- 
fore the Christian era. 
Here, an artist largely using the na- 
tural indentation of the rock, created 
what Professor Giedion calls "a well- 
nigh breathing image, yet one which 
eludes our grasp. A horse which 
blooms out of the rock in absolute 
freedom, a horse before its enslave- 
ment to man.” 
Though Greek classicism saw the 
apotheosis of man over animal, the 
artist continued to draw from the ani- 
mal world his illustrations for his 
beliefs and history, his myths and 
ideals. Sixth century Chinese wall 
paintings in the Tum Huang caves 
depict the Buddha legend with ani- 
mals; Coptic weavers of the third to 
fifth centuries A.D. used the birds and 
fishes of their familiar river Nile as a 
theme for decoration. The animal ima- 
gery of the middle ages was both 
extraordinarily powerful and full of 
humour; the animal in Mexican and 
African art has a peculiarly potent 
place. 
In the 19th century the French paint- 
er, Eugéne Delacroix, described in his 
diary a visit to the Natural History Mu- 
seum and the Jardin des Plantes in 
Paris. "What an immense variety of 
animals and species of different shapes 
and functions. And at every turn | saw 
what we call deformity side by side with 
what seems to us to be beauty and 
grace of form. Why is it that these 
things have stirred me so much? | had 
a feeling of happiness as soon as | 
entered the place. . . Can it be because 
| have gone outside the everyday 
thoughts that are my world; away from 
the street that is my entire universe? 
How necessary it is to stick one’s head 
out of daors and try to read from the 
book of life that has nothing in common 
with cities and the works of man...” 
For now there has arisen what Pro- 
fessor Otto von Simson of Die Frei 
Universitat, Berlin, in his introduction 
to this book calls “the second aliena- 
tion from nature—the replacement of 
the animal by science, by the machine.” 
The importance of the animal to an 
artist working in a world where animals 
are becoming rarer needs no stressing, 
but scientific progress is no Indication 
that this age-old communion between 
man and animal need deteriorate. It 
seems significant that the last creature 
chosen in the book should be Braque's 
“White Bird,” that winged master of the 
airs whose flight in man's imagination 
can bring him within the reaches of 
new worlds.

THE BEAR TAMER. Bronze statuette from China (5th-4th century B.C.) Since 
ancient times the Chinese have been fond of acrobatic 
performances by men and animals. Looking at this bear 
and its youthful tamer, we can easily Imagine the delight of an audience at the 
dexterity of an animal which can be taught to juggle, walk a tight-rope, ride a rolling sphere 
and also, as the statuette shows, balance itself on top of a pole.

THE ROOTS OF PEACE (Continued from page 26) 
ourselves how far we are still removed from what is 
vitally necessary. 
Yet even when we have ascertained what is necessary, 
“necessary for survival,” we have still not touched the 
question whether the necessary will also be attainable. 
Every community and every generation has only a narrow 
range of action. Only gradual, small steps can be taken. 
This leads to a fourth complex of questions: can the 
necessary be made possible? The time available is not 
unlimited. There is a certain urgency. The problem is 
whether individuals and peoples can be induced—by edu- 
cation and other means—to make “the necessary” possible. 
Is the "human way" of change through reason and common 
sense possible? Man is also “irrational man,” who in his 
opinions and actions is primarily swayed by instinct, 
emotion and tradition. Reason, especially in the human 
group, has but little influence, and the influence of what 
is emotionally felt, direct, and immediate, dominates. It 
has been said that if one wishes to influence the masses, 
one cannot afford to fly in the face of the “basic attitudes” 
of nationalism, or freedom, or of security sought through 
power. 
The prevalent pattern of international relations is a 
pattern of distrust and fear. Can this possibly be changed? 
Certain fundamental human attitudes “have become so 
much a part of the mind, and lie so far back, that (men) 
are never really conscious of them at all. They do not see 
them, but other things through them.” The important ques- 
tion is how far ways can be found to make individuals and 
peoples prepared to accept what the “long-term interest” 
of ensuring peace demands. 
This ends our brief survey of some questions which 
determine peace research. To answer them thorough 
scientific investigation is required in which almost all 
scientific disciplines must be involved. Close co-operation 
between these various disciplines will be indispensable. 
The problem is a social one, one of individuals and 
groups, and of contacts between individuals and groups. 
In such an investigation the starting-point will have to be 
the present situation, as a product of historical evolution, 
hardened and intensified by the ideas and interests rooted 
in it. The historical evolution of each group, which distin- 
guishes it from other groups through the deep-seated 
memory of shared joys and sufferings, makes it desirable 
that peace research should primarily be cultivated in each 
individual political collectivity. Each collectivity has its 
characteristic peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, each collec- 
tivity may have its own ways and possibilities of change. 
P EACE research in each state is important also 
because there is a tendency towards spiritual 
insulation on certain points, to protect the national pattern 
of thought. 
Peace research in each country will be able to help 
counteract this nationalization of truth. Research in the 
social sciences will recognize such nationalization as a 
fact, but may through this very recognition be able to 
prevent its worst excesses. 
There is another important aspect. If it is true that our 
world is not organized in such a way as to be equal to 
the dangers that technological evolution has brought about, 
then it is imperative that changes should take place. 
That this is so is beyond doubt, although for the moment 
we can leave aside the question of what these changes 
would have to encompass. There is a predominant school 
of thought which maintains that these changes will have 
to run on lines of general and complete disarmament, and 
the ensuring of security through world organization, 
This means that the changes will have to be realized 
everywhere. Security cannot be achieved by unilateral 
measures, of whatever kind, but only through combined 
efforts and concerted action. Changes at home will only 
be possible as adequate steps are taken elsewhere, 
prompted by a recognition of common long-term interests. 
Now if it is true that for the realization of the changes 
required for lasting peace scientific research is indispen- 
sable, then it is essential that such research should be 
carried out everywhere. If peace research is to be effec- 
tive, the understanding it provides will have to become 
public property everywhere. This will be promoted by the 
existence of peace research institutes in every country. 
WwW E have here a consequence of interdependence, 
which is even more evident than that which led 
to the establishment of the International Labour Office. 
Improvements in the social conditions of the labouring class 
could not be effected nationally without simultaneous 
implementation elsewhere. Hence the attempt at inter- 
nationalization of labour legislation in 1919. International 
security through disarmament can naturally only be attained 
if the pattern of security through national armament is 
universally abandoned, and appropriate measures are 
universally accepted. 
The first requirement, therefore, is that peace research 
should be cultivated in all countries and nations: peace 
research which can then start from the pecularities of 
each, historically conditioned, national situation; peace 
research which can express itself in the specific national 
pattern of thought, enjoy national confidence, and thus 
influence national patterns of thought. 
The possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that the 
nationalization of truth will also set its mark on nationally- 
conducted peace research. Here is a first special reason 
for the desirability of international contact and co-operation 
in the science of war and peace. 
Another special reason is that peace research deals 
with matters which affect the whole world, so that it is 
important to be informed of “the situation” everywhere. 
It is only through the co-operation of scholars that an 
understanding may grow of what is thought and felt in 
various parts of the world, and of what—in a concerted 
effort to effect changes—represents action possibilities. 
In addition to these special reasons for international 
scientific co-operation there are the general reasons—of 
mutual stimulation and supplementation—favourable results 
of which in different fields we can daily see before us. 
The need for international contact and co-operation has 
led to the establishment of the International Peace Research 
Association. The Association aims to make a substantial 
contribution to world and international peace research in 
order to promote world order, peace and security. This will 
be possible if many are prepared to lend their active 
support.

LAKE BAIKAL POLLUTION 
Sir, 
Lake Baikal, as you are certainly 
aware, is a body of water with unique 
qualities. It contains one tenth of the 
total volume of our planet's reserves 
of fresh water, and its signifiance, for 
science and for the future of man 
alike, is immense. Two other unique 
features of the lake are the physical 
and chemical qualities of its water 
and its fauna which comprises over 
100 species. Thus it can be consi- 
dered as part of man's heritage from 
nature. But a threat hangs over Lake 
Baikal—its possible pollution by in- 
dustrial waste waters from the pro- 
jected pulp and cardboard works at 
Baikaisk and Selenga that are being 
built despite protests from scientific 
circles in the Soviet Union. Several 
Soviet newspapers have campaigned 
to warn against the danger of this 
pollution which could happen within 
30 years, thus destroying this pearl 
of nature together with its fauna. 
Means must be found to prevent this 
senseless act. 
Vladimir V. Eichwald 
P. Lavachov 
Tallinn, U.S.S.R 
Ed note : According to recent Soviet 
press reports the Lake Baikal area 
is to become a huge national park 
administered by a special body to 
supervise the use of its immense na- 
tural resources while developing it 
as a holiday and tourist centre. Spe- 
cial precautions would be taken 
against possible pollution by indus- 
trial wastes. Two plans are being 
discussed, one for a park with an 
area of nearly 5,000 square miles 
(13,000 sq. kms.) and another for a 
park nearly three times as large. 
YOUTH WITH A PURPOSE 
 
Sir, 
In the July-August 1965 issue on 
youth your staff has come up with 
another unique journalistic success, 
not so much dependent on the pic- 
tures or the prose or the lay-out, 
but on the humanity of the whole. 
Some particular gems of information 
and understanding are the facts given 
about Unesco clubs, the art essay, 
with its colour pages, much of the 
part on science, the fascinating essay 
from the Soviet Union, and—naturally 
—the concentration on the developing 
countries. Something which the whole 
panorama seems to have in common 
is its rejection of any limitations on 
man.

was placed there on the initiative of

Fifteen thousand electric bulbs were 
used to compose a scene showing the

THE REVOLUTION IN BOOKS 
Sir, 
Congratulations on devoting your 
September 1965 issue to today's 
revolution in books. After reading 
about Unesco's latest guide to world 
translations (Index Translationum} | 
wish to pass on some figures con- 
cerning Bible translations as given in 
the September 1965 issue of Ecclesia. 
According to this review: “In 1964, 
sixteen new languages were added 
to those in which at least one com- 
plete book of the scriptures has been 
translated. Ten of these new lan- 
guages are spoken by South Ame- 
rican Indian tribes, four by African 
peoples and two by Asian. The 
complete Bible now exists in 235 lan- 
guages; the New Testament in 290 
and a gospel or another complete 
book of the scriptures in 707 lan- 
guages—altogether 1,232 languages. 
In 1964, the world distribution of the 
scriptures by bible societies (in millions 
of copies) was as follows: Bibles 4; 
New Testaments 4; Gospels 30; Se- 
lections 32—a total of 70 million 
copies.” 
Abbé Jean-Frangois Pinard 
Charleville, France 
KORZYBSKI & MARY EDDY 
Sir, 
As a professional linguist, | have 
throughout the years noted many mis- 
translations, some of them rather 
startling. But never have | come 
across such a fantastic, unbelievable 
whopper as in Prof. Zvegintsev's letter 
in your issue of September 1965. 
| have not seen your Russian edi- 
tion, but | presume that Prof. Zvegint- 
sev wrote in Russian. Accordingly 
the error must be attributed to your 
translator. 
To confuse “Science and Sanity” 
by Alfred Korzybski (note the correct 
spelling of his name) with “Science 
and Health™ by Mary B. Eddy is a 
monumental blunder. Both Korzybski 
and Mrs. Eddy must be whirling in 
their graves.

in your December issue from a Viet 
Nam reader who deprived himself of 
breakfasts in order to subscribe to 
a magazine which has so much to 
offer him culturally. | am a school- 
girl, aged 17, and | realize what

to send him some reading material

From the Unesco New I 
Nobel Peace Prize 
for Unicef 
On December 10—Human Rights Day— 
the United Nations Children's Fund rec- 
eived the Nobel Peace Prize for 1965, an 
award made in recognition of Unicef's work 
for the world's children. Since it began 
with emergency relief work for children in 
war-stricken countries in 1946, Unicef has 
extended its activities to include all depriv- 
ed children, especially in the developing 
countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
Today, 571 assistance projects are operat- 
Ing in 118 nations. Since 1961, when Unicef 
decided to extend its aid to education, joint 
Unicef-Unesco projects have been started 
in 55 countries. They run from the educa- 
tion of handicapped children to community 
development schemes, and from textbook 
publishing to teacher training. 
Unesco books reprinted 
in 35 languages 
Hundreds of books published by 
Unesco have been reprinted by commercial 
publishers throughout the world. In the 
last quarter of 1965 alone, 90 Unesco books 
were being reprinted in 35 languages. 
Early publication of 70 more titles is fore- 
seen. Two main types of books are being 
reproduced: Unesco publications dealing 
with education, science, social sciences, 
cultural activities and mass communica- 
tion; prose and poetry classics of different 
nations, including folk tales and antholo- 
gies which Unesco translates and distribu- 
tes to make them better known in other 
countries, Most translated book to date is 
Unesco’s “Source Book for Science Teach- 
ing”, a "do-it yourself” science book which 
explains how to do simple experiments with 
“home-made” equipment; it has already

Asia’s educators look ahead 
Educators from 15 Asian countries and 
the Soviet Union reviewed problems of 
Asia's future educational growth at the 
recent conference convened in Bangkok by 
Unesco and the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Asia and the Far East. 
Discussions brought out the need to work 
for a balanced educational growth at all 
levels, to expand technical education and 
launch literacy campaigns, to keep in view 
the varying levels of educational develop- 
ment in Asian countries and to bring edu- 
cational development into the economic and 
social planning of each country. Delegates 
recommended the introduction of an ex- 
panded programme of science teaching at 
all levels. 
Pollution problems 
of Europe’s rivers 
The Rhine waters upstream from Lake 
Constance contain only 30 to 100 microbes   
     
per cubic centimetre, but the bacterial 
count is between 100,000 and 200,000 
where the Rhine reaches the sea. Above 
Paris the Seine contains only 15 pathogenic 
organisms per cubic centimetre; down- 
stream the figure is roughly 1,500,000. 
These figures are taken from a report re- 
cently presented to the Council of Europe. 
The Council plans to set up a convention 
to fight water pollution and also to publish 
a Water Charter to publicize the problem. 
Economic effects 
of disarmament 
“The Economic Effects of Disarmament”, 
a detailed study of the effect of disarma- 
ment on the British economy, first published 
in 1963, is now available in a special paper- 
back edition, price 12/6. Published by The 
Economist Intelligence Unit, 27 St. James 
Place, London SW.1., the study shows 
the types of industrial capacity and man- 
power which are now absorbed by defence, 
the policies needed. for their conversion, 
and the type of peaceful expenditure that 
might replace military expenditure. 
Versatile isotopes 
Jobs now being done by radioisotope 
instruments range from sorting the mail to 
helping in the salvage of the Abu Simbel 
temples in Nubia. A recent symposium of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency 
held in Warsaw was told that in France zinc 
is added to the paper used for making 
stamps so that X.rays can detect the 
stamp’s position on a letter. This enables 
the first phase of mail sorting—straighten- 
ing out envelopes and turning them face 
up—to be done at the rate of 400,000 let- 
ters an hour. At Abu Simbel, isotopes 
trace the injection of resin as a reinforce- 
ment into the rock walls of the temples 
before they are cut into blocks for remo- 
val. When the injected resin approaches 
the surface of the rock to the point where 
it might mar it, isotopes sound a warning. 
Stop using the sea 
as a junk yard and sewer 
Man can no longer consider the sea as 
a convenient and apparently limitless com- 
bination of junkyard and sewer. If this pro- 
cess continues, unplanned and uncontrolled, 
man may pollute and destroy large areas 
of the sea and its resources just as he has 
polluted and destroyed land. Domestic 
sewage is rapidly broken down by micro- 
organisms in the sea, but crude oil, radio- 
active wastes, heavy metals and chlorinat- 
ed hydrocarbons used as insecticides are 
not disposed of by biological processes. 
DDT has been found in tunny fish caught 
400 miles offshore and other pesticides 
in penguins in the Antarctic. This warn- 
Ing against pollution was given by the 
Unesco-sponsored Intergovernmental Ocea- 
nographic Commission at its recent meeting 
in Paris. The Commission urged its 50 mem-

Dynamic museum 
The Neuchatel Museum of Ethnography 
in Switzerland often seems to be doing its 
best to look as little like a museum as pos- 
sible. At its recent exhibition of “The 
World's Children at Play”, the visitor's eye 
was greeted by 1,000 feet of wall space 
where children had painted their own choice 
of subjects on this theme, and his ear 
by recordings of children playing street 
games. The museum uses walls, furniture 
and light to create an atmosphere that ena- 
bles visitors to see beyond the exhibits and 
the bounds of this ultra-modern museum 
building.  Unesco's quarterly, “Museum”, 
devoted an entire issue (VolXVIll, No 1, 
1965; $2.00, 10/-stg) to the Neuchatel 
Museum, which celebrated its tenth anni- 
versary in November 1965. 
Balkan soil studies 
A group of 15 soil scientists recently 
made a study tour of five Balkan countries, 
under the sponsorship of FAO, the United 
Nations and Unesco, to exchange informa- 
tion on the classification and land use of 
the major soil groups in Thrace (Turkey), 
Bulgaria, southern Rumania, eastern Yugo- 
slavia and eastern Greece. Similar study 
tours have been made in the U.S.SR, 
Brazil, Rumania, Mexico, lapan and India to 
collect information for the Soil Map of the 
World Project being carried out by FAO 
and Unesco.

THE INNER NATURE OF SCIENCE 
by Warren Weaver 
The Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science was awarded 
by Unesco in 1965 to Dr. Warren Weaver of the United States. 
Dr. Weaver, a distinguished science writer, science consultant and 
a former president of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science, was presented with his award by the Director- 
General of Unesco at a ceremony in Unesco House on October 14. 
In his address, Dr. Weaver discussed four aspects of the problem 
of the interpretation and diffusion of science: the importance of 
science, the difficulty of interpreting science, the special need 
today for this interpretation, and why the interpretation by the 
science writer, however difficult it may be, “must be carried for- 
ward continuously, interestingly but never trivially, accurately but 
clearly, humbly yet enthusiastically, ardently yet patiently.” In 
his conclusion, Dr. Weaver declared: 
“T, live, in the modern world, 
without some reasonable knowledge 
of science is to be critically handi- 
capped in any attempt to understand 
many of the major forces which are 
shaping our present society. It is to 
have all the senses dulled, and not 
only dulled to what is going on in the 
world but to be dulled to the beauty 
and to the spiritual significance of 
science, unaware of the incredible but 
lovely way in which our universe Is 
put together, unconscious of the Ins- 
piring unity which binds together all 
life and all that is at the moment 
not alive, uninspired by the vision of 
man’s new capacities to contro] his 
environment and to liberate himself for 
new and more noble destinies. 
“it is a sad pity that so many per- 
sons think of science exclusively in 
terms of the hardware—the devices 
that it makes possible. It is unfortu- 
nate that those with a slightly clearer 
vision see science chiefly as the heal- 
er and the feeder. In the long run 
it will, however, be worst of all If 
men cannot be made to understand 
the essential inner nature of science. 
“There are some so misled as to 
view science as a sort of mechanical 
monster, grinding ever forward, pro- 
ducing terrible engines of destruction, 
forcing everything into dull conformity 
with inexorable and soulless logic, 
reducing everything to baffling but all- 
powerful equations, 
“To correct those false views | view 
to be a major duty of those who in- 
terpret science to the public. For 
those false views separate science 
from the rest of life. 
“From the time of Roger Bacon there 
have been those who consider that 
the business of science is simply to 
collect a lot of “facts” (hard facts, 
we often say, implying necessary per- 
manency, accuracy and objectivity) 
and then construct a theory to explain 
them. That theory then is true; and 
all must bow before it. 
“But we now fully recognize what 
we should always have realized—first 
that we obtain so-called facts only 
through observation, and that the 
observer is himself an essential part 
of the fact system, thus at one stroke 
destroying both ultimate precision and 
ultimate objectivity; and second, we 
know that elements of choice, presup- 
positions which have neither a factual 
nor a logical analytical basis but do 
have both a personal and a cultural 
basis, enter into the structure of all 
theories and into the selection of the 
group of facts to be dealt with, 
“That our scientific knowledge pro- 
gresses by unjustified (and unjustifia- 
ble} anticipations, by guesses, by ten- 
tative solutions to our problems, by 
conjectures and that these conjectures, 
although they are controlled and refin- 
ed by criticism, can never be posi- 
tively justified Is a viewpoint massively 
and convincingly defended by the 
great logician and philosopher Karl R. 
Popper. Science proceeds, Popper 
says, not by proving that certain 
statements are correct, but rather by 
showing that certain statements are 
incorrect. If this explodes the myth, 
apparently comforting to some but 
basically frightening, that science is 
the austere custodian of unassailable 
truth, note that at the same time it 
forces sclence to join hands with all 
other human endeavours—for we all 
learn by our mistakes. 
“You must not misunderstand why ! 
have made these comments about the 
essential nature of science. 1 have 
not done so to detract In any way 
from the practical value of science, 
nor to depreciate the magnificent 
successes of science. But these very 
successes, when viewed superficially 
and when over-valued as they can so 
easily be, tend to separate science 
from the rest of men's lives. Where- 
as the great need, as science marches 
forward, is to assure that science 
be merged into a mutually advanta- 
geous companionship with all of the 
humane arts, with philosophy and 
with religion.”   im

Of all school subjects, geography is perhaps the 
best suited to promote mutual understanding 
between peoples. Geography can show not 
only how peoples have lived and are living, but 
also what they have contributed to the common 
heritage of mankind. Unesco's aim in publish- 
ing this book is to aid and guide all who teach 
or study in the world's schools. Practical 
advice is given on how to improve teaching 
methods and provide the proper materials for 
effective geography teaching at primary and 
secondary levels.
