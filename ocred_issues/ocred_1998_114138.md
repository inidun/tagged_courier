### 114139: Russia's angry miners

Russia's angry 
miners 
Half of Russia’s 900,000 miners have been sacked 
over the past seven years and the other half are 
struggling to make ends meet because they are 
being paid months, even years late. Their anger 
exploded last January 
The legendary patience of Russia’s 
miners came to an end last January 
when they suddenly revolted at 
Kuznetskaya and nearby places in the pine- 
forests of the Siberian taiga. For five days, 
in the half-light of the winter, the manager 
of the local coal mine was held hostage by 
a group of miners driven to desperation. 
Helped by their wives and children, they 
kept him prisoner in his office by 
barricading the door with tables and 
chairs. They had not been paid for three 
years, they said. They had no running 
water, no telephones. T heir children could 
no longer go to school, which was fifteen 
kilometres away. 
Their remote village, located in the 
Kuzbass region, the heart of Russia’s coal 
industry, is a Soviet-style mining settlement 
like many others in the country’s coalfields. 
The privileged status that all manual 
workers, especially miners, enjoyed in the 
Soviet Union was in fact only relative and 
partial. They may have been paid twice as 
much as teachers or doctors but they were 
often housed in insanitary wooden shacks, 
usually consisting of a single room and a 
tiny kitchen. 
These hovels are still there, rows of 
them along muddy tracks which are either 
frozen or dusty according to the season. 
‘Kidnapping the mine 
manager in January got us 
nowhere. We're the real 
hostages here, the miners 
and their families’ 
They date back to the time of the gulags, 
when mines were dug by prisoners in 
remote Arctic regions without any regard 
for profitability. When the market economy 
arrived, keeping them going became a 
tricky afair. 
Many miners still live in such barrack 
blocks because almost no new low-cost 
housing has been built since the collapse 
of the Soviet Union.But the end of the old 
Soviet empire has had plenty of other 
consequences. In Siberia, safety conditions 
in the mines quickly deteriorated as 
equipment wore out. T he huge expanses of 
cheap housing which began to replace the 
old mining villages in the 1950s are no 
longer maintained. 
In Kuznetskaya, thirty-two-year-old 
Maria Petrovna lives in one room with her 
husband and their two children, aged six 
and eleven.An ancient coal stove, a child’s

In the Kuzbass, a desolate and icy region of 
western Siberia more than 3,000 km east of 
Moscow, coal miners have been on strike

How has this family survived without

have been stored in the cellar and as many 
things as possible have been pickled.

debts of Russia’s banks neared $200 billion 
by the time they almost collapsed this 
summer. 
The miners also survive by stealing, by 
dismantling abandoned factories and other 
facilities bit by bit. Barter is becoming 
routine. The lone shop in Kuznetskaya no 
longer has any cash. At the beginning of the 
year, the manager “sold” basic food items 
to the miners, hoping to be paid when they 
received their wages. 
He also distributed goods which he got 
through complicated barter negotiations 
involving coal from the mine. Sometimes 
the families have to try to sell by themselves 
tyres or nails obtained this way. Many 
miners have sunk into alcoholism, whose 
ravages are still on the increase in Russia, 
sending many to a premature death or 
disability.

take no more of this. They were tired of 
living off their wits, while the mine manager 
was living high off the hog. He had moved to 
a new area outside the village, where 
mansions have been built behind high walls. 
In the West, mine closures in the past 
few decades have been isolated dramas, 
resisted by groups of workers. In Russia, 
such closures are happening at a time when 
the country itself is breaking up and 
PEOPLE AND PLACES 
plunging into a crisis whose outcome is 
uncertain. T he first seven years of transition 
from communism to capitalism have ended 
in failure. The fate of the miners is no 
longer a major factor in the tragedy being 
experienced by the vast majority of people, 
including the middle class which was just 
starting to emerge, and the intellectuals, 
who are having a hard time playing their 
role as observers and chroniclers of this 
Unpalatable options 
n 1996, the World Bank made an initial loan of $500 million for the reconversion of Russia’s coal mines, 
which were considered uneconomic. Some of this money was hijacked by real or bogus middlemen. Before 
making a second loan of $800 million, the bank is demanding that half the 200 mines still operating be shut 
down and that all state subsidies be abolished by the year 2000. The subsidies are used to pay around 17% 
of the miners’ wages, the rest coming from the mining companies, which have been partly privatized since 
last year. 
Retraining the dismissed miners is very difficult. In the Tula Basin, for example, only 1,700 of the 
20,000 miners dismissed there a few years ago have found new jobs. Russian coal production has slumped, 
from 400 million tonnes in 1980 to 240 million tonnesin 1997. [|]

tormented society. 
Half of Russia’s 900,000 miners have 
been sacked since 1991. Only very few of 
them have managed to find other work. 
More dismissals are expected during the 
next few months,along with the sacking of 
other workers traditionally less well- 
organized,in Russia as elsewhere, than the 
miners. But most Russian trade unions 
have been discredited by their past 
collaboration either with the communist 
authorities,or with the present regime.So 
they cannot mobilize large numbers of 
people to support the miners, workers and 
others who continue to toil without pay for 
months or even years. 
In Kuznetskaya,M aria Petrovna is bitter. 
“Kidnapping the mine manager in January 
got us nowhere. We're the real hostages here, 
the miners and their families. We’ve got too 
many thieves and scoundrels.” 
All the miners in Russia have come to 
the same conclusion, whether they live in 
the Kuzbass region, in the Far East, in 
Rostov-on-Don or in Vorkuta, above the 
Arctic Circle. Everywhere, each day is 
pretty much like living in hell. u

Will there be a 
21st century? 
Soe 60 leading figures from 40 countries— 
ientists, economists, inventors, 
demographers, sociologists, historians, NGO 
officials and political leaders— met to discuss 
this question at UNEsco’s Paris Headquarters 
from 16 to 19 September. 
They were neither fatalistic nor blindly 
optimistic. The inter-disciplinary dialogues about 
the future in which they took part highlighted 
many uncertainties and one major certainty, 
namely that our preparations for the 21st 
century must take account of instability and 
complexity and be guided by the principles of 
justice and sharing. 
The papers given at this gathering can be 
found at the website www.unesco.org/aforum

year.

UNESCO's activities are based on the conviction that it is possible to influence the 
  
course of world events and that tomorrow’s world is being constructed today. And the 
structure will be all the more solid if it rests on clear ethical principles and a sharp 
awareness of the gap between what exists and what should exist. 
The future of humankind is threatened by real dangers. In too many parts of the 
world, human dignity is still being abused by war and by exclusion of the most vulnerable 
and needy. Inequality and poverty are growing. T he walls of urban segregation are rising. 
The education of women is being forgotten. And people’s violence towards each other is 
matched by the violence they inflict on nature,thereby jeopardizing their own future. 
Lack of foresight and the race for quick profit have led to intensive exploitation of 
natural resources, ecological disasters, ever more serious problems of water supply and 
desertification as well as pollution of every kind.Who can say for sure if scientific and 
technological progress will bring more solutions than new perils? 
The rapid growth of biotechnology and the possibilities of human genetic engineering 
are even leading people to reconsider the very definition of what constitutes a human 
being. We risk being enslaved by our own inventions and becoming prisoners in a maze of 
our own creation unless we are very vigilant and take a clear ethical stand. 
We should all be concerned about what lies ahead. The future must not be left to the 
ravages of blind and cynical forces. Ethical deficits seem to me to be more serious in the long 
term than budget deficits. T he ethics of the future is sustained by the belief that there is no 
contradiction between solidarity with the present generation and solidarity with future 
generations. Both embody the same rejection of exclusion and injustice, the same reminder 
of the bond that unites all people on earth. This ethics does not make vain prescriptions for 
a future which never arrives. It starts here and now, with care for others and the 
determination to pass on to future generations a heritage which is not irretrievably damaged. 
One sometimes hears it said that “the future is too complicated and too uncertain,so 
let’s make the best of the present”.My answer is that it is too easy to wait for problems to 
arise before tackling them and to take action only in emergencies. Such short-sighted 
reasoning leaves only the choice of yielding or adapting to events. If we are not to be at their 
mercy, if we are to regain control of our own future, if we are to escape routine and 
obsolescence, we must start thinking again in the long term by looking as far ahead as 
possible and anticipating developments. 
Only by adopting this kind of perspective can we counter uncertainty about the future and 
create room for action now. And it is action we need. Anticipating means fighting apathy and 
indifference, awakening people’s consciences, opening their eyes to tomorrow’s dangers and 
readjusting, if need be, today’s decisions. Foresight is the basis of effective action. 
Foresight calls for two qualities: comprehension and imagination. Comprehension 
because the future does not come out of the blue. It leads back to earlier states of awareness, 
to rules or an absence of rules whose reasons must be understood. The effort of linking the 
present and the future in this way will unite the world and turn it into a whole,producing 
the overall grasp which is precisely the meaning of the verb “to comprehend.” This effort 
would remain an abstract one if it was not enriched and illuminated by imagination. 
Thinking about the twenty-first century means dreaming, conjuring up models which 
are perhaps contradictory, imagining new worlds and utopias. Allowing ourselves to 
understand reality and to imagine the possible, to achieve the possible and to attempt the 
impossible. [|

### 114141: Nuclear watch in the Far North

Nuclear watch in 
The fate of the unparalleled concentration of nuclear material on Russia’s 
Kola peninsula is alarming neighbouring Scandinavian countries 
The strike only lasted an hour, but it was 
enough to set alarm bells ringing in 
Moscow. Organized by Russia’s nuclear 
defence workers in September this year, it 
caused such concern in Moscow that despite 
the severe financial crisis the government 
allotted about $16 million for the defence 
employees who had not been paid for 
months. Even the latest deal gave the workers 
only half of the wages owed to them by the 
government. “People are really hungry. How 
can you ask them to look after our security?” 
said Yury Bersenyev, a scientist from the 
closed nuclear city Snezhinsk, in an interview 
to a local daily. 
Corroding equipment 
and dissatisfied servicemen 
The Russian Union of Nuclear Industry 
Workers says that hungry nuclear workers 
and lack of funding could lead to serious 
trouble in the Russian nuclear sector, 
including defence establishments. In addition 
to corroding submarines,dissatisfied military 
personnel now add more complications for 
the Russian authorities. In September this 
year a disgruntled armed conscript killed 
eight of his fellow servicemen and threatened 
to blow up the Akula-class submarine at the 
Skalisty naval base in the Kola peninsula. 
Finally he killed himself in the torpedo 
compartment. Though Russian officials 
assured that the sailor could not have 
damaged the torpedoes,any explosion in the 
compartment was strong enough to damage 
the submarine’s single nuclear reactor. This 
incident alarmed Norwegian officials, as it 
happened just 120 km from the border in the 
country’s north. The unstable situation in the 
Russian nuclear sector has aggravated the 
worries of the neighbouring Scandinavian 
nations who will be the first to be affected in 
case of a nuclear disaster in Russia’s north- 
west. 
The gravest environmental hazard in the 
Arctic Circle stems from nuclear activity on 
the Russian side, especially in and around the 
northern Kola peninsula. Nowhere else on 
earth is there such a concentration of civilian 
and naval nuclear reactors. According to the 
Yablokov report’, an official Russian

document, there were a total of 270 nuclear 
reactors in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk 
counties in 1990. Nuclear activity in and 
around the Kola peninsula includes power 
plants, nuclear submarines, huge piles of 
nuclear waste and the effects of nuclear tests 
conducted by the former Soviet Union. 
Russia’s immediate neighbour Finland 
is the only European Union country to 
share a 1,200-kilometre border with Russia 
and faces constant environmental threats 
from the former superpower. Finland’s 
Arctic Circle would be the first and worst 
hit region in the event of a Russian 
environmental disaster. With memories of 
Chernobyl still haunting them, the Finns 
are constantly monitoring air, water, soil, 
plants and meat to make sure nothing is 
amiss on the Russian side. 
Despite the presence of so many old- 
fashioned nuclear reactors and unprotected 
piles of nuclear waste so close to the border, 
Kristina Rissanen, head of the Regional 
Laboratory of the Finnish Centre for 
Radiation and Nuclear Safety (CRN S),in 
Rovaniemi, tries to keep a sense of 
perspective. “The radiation levels across 
the border at present are not alarming. 
Moreover the Russians in recent years have 
started showing a more open approach, and 
that itself is a positive factor.” 
Rissanen’s laboratory, eighteen metres 
underground, is designed to withstand a 
nuclear holocaust. The enthusiastic team of 
chemists in CRNS analyse hundreds of 
samples every day, from reindeer meat to 
industrial products. Kristina makes frequent 
trips to northwestern Russia on joint 
expeditions to find out the fate of submerged 
nuclear reactors and the operational 
reactors. 
TheYablokovreport noted that only 15 
per cent of the dry-docked submarines had 
been properly decommissioned by the 
removal of reactor fuels and the reactor 
section. A state of the Arctic Environment 
Report® says that along with nuclear waste, 
the Soviet Union dumped six nuclear 
submarine reactors and a shielding 
assembly from an icebreaker reactor, 
containing spent fuel, between the years 
1959 and 1991.

Rissanen, whose team often searches 
the Barents Sea for the nuclear reactors 
from sunken Russian nuclear submarines, 
takes a different view. “There is no doubt 
many of the submerged reactors could pose 
a serious threat to the environment of the 
Arctic region in the future. I am more 
worried about the Kola nuclear power plant 
than those reactors lying under the sea. The 
nuclear reactors in Kola are very old and 
similar to Chernobyl-type reactors.”

### 114141: Nuclear watch in the Far North

the Far North 
The Northern Fleet and naval shipyards 
include nuclear-powered submarines and 
battle cruisers based at nine ports along the 
northern coast of the Kola peninsula and at 
two bases on the Archangelsk region’s coast. 
There are about ninety vessels in operation 
and more than seventy out of operation and 
laid up, containing about 170 reactors in 
operation and 130 out of operation.About 
5,000 tons of solid waste are generated 
annually at the Northern Fleet’s nuclear 
vessels and at shipyards in the two regions. 
Rissanen cautions that new storage 
facilities have to be built in the Russian 
Federation to ensure the safety of the 
nuclear waste. “During one of the 
expeditions we found excessive radioactive 
caesium in the sediments of Dvina River 
could turn into a catastrophe,” RIA 
Novosty news agency quoted Yegorov as 
saying in July this year. 
Shannon Kile, a research assistant at the 
Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute (SIPRI) voices concern over the 
fate of the nuclear missiles and fuel in the 
decommissioned submarines and 
dismantled missiles. He says “as per the 
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START- 
I) the Russian Federation dismantled 
hundreds of nuclear delivery vehicles. Both 
in START-I and the ongoing START-II (to 
be ratified by Russian parliament) the 
status of the nuclear warheads fixed in 
those missiles is unspecified and future 
arms reduction agreements should take 
care of the warheads also.” 
About 5,000 tons of solid nuclear waste 
are generated annually by the Northern Fleet’s nuclear 
vessels and at shipyards in the region 
estuary, which is most probably transported 
from the large catchment area of the river. 
Radioactive materials were also found near 
Atomflot in Murmansk.H owever, these are 
not above the normal levels. It may be 
originating from nuclear storage sites other 
than those known. In certain areas in the 
Barents Sea, where old reactors have been 
dropped, the radiation level is higher. But 
Russian officials do not allow us to go near 
the precise spot.As long as these are not at 
threatening levels it can be managed.” 
Western nuclear experts who have 
visited Russia say that the formal 
requirements, regulations and control in 
the Russian Federation today still do not 
meet modern standards. To complicate 
matters,the enterprises are subordinate to 
many different authorities, federal and 
local, which make the regulatory system 
complex.The amount of waste and spent 
fuel greatly exceeds the capacity of storage 
and reprocessing. Most importantly, there 
is no money to fully maintain, restore or 
replace equipment and facilities for 
radioactive waste and spent fuel 
conditioning, handling, transport and 
storage. According to former Russian 
Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Nikolay 
Yegorov the cleanup projects in the 
Northern Fleet would require some $1.5 
billion. “Matters worsen every year. . . . and 
Novaya Zemlya (New Earth) was the 
main Soviet nuclear test site between 1955 
and 1990. In total, 132 nuclear explosions 
were conducted, 87 of which were 
atmospheric (above ground), three were 
underwater and 42 underground. More than 
90 per cent of the total power of all the 
nuclear weapons tests performed by the 
former Soviet Union were made in Novaya 
Zemlya.” According to scientists at the 
Institute of Radiation Hygiene, St. 
Petersburg’, the highest levels of radioactive 
fallout in the entire Russian arctic and 
subarctic area were found in the Kola 
peninsula. They say the sources of 
contamination were atmospheric nuclear 
weapons tests up to 1963, when the 
maximum fallout concentrations of 
radioactive caesium and strontium were 
found, and the accident at Chernobyl in 
1986. 
Despite pressure from Scandinavian 
and other European countries it is not 
realistic to expect the Russians to wholly 
abandon their nuclear energy projects, 
which are badly required for the power- 
starved northwest region of the country. 
Irrespective of advances in other forms of 
electricity generation, Russia will probably 
continue to use and develop nuclear 
technology because of its huge 
infrastructure and enormous manpower.

Russia, in this regard, needs help from 
Western countries to find a solution to the 
problem. 
Though Norway has taken the lead in 
co-operating with the Russians in working 
out solutions, Western experts say the 
intransigent nature of Russian bureaucracy 
blocks rapid progress in co-operation. 
During Norwegian King Harald V’s visit to 
Moscow in May 1998, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin said Russia would dismantle 
all its old nuclear submarines in the Barents 
Sea region if Norway provided the 
necessary financial assistance. An 
agreement signed between the two 
countries in May 1998 cleared the hurdles 
that have delayed Norwegian efforts to 
participate in the cleanup of the Russian 
Northern Fleet’s leaking storage facilities 
for spent nuclear fuel in Andreeva Bay at 
the Kola peninsula. Norway has granted 
$60 million for the first projects and more 
could be found if the programme is 
successful. 
“Though the Norwegian side is willing 
to help the Russian side there is no co- 
operation from Russian authorities. The 
Ministry of Defence does not want to give 
any access into their leaking facilities. T hey 
say they would give video clips describing 
the sites. You cannot make plans and give 
money just by looking at the video clips. 
We hope the situation improves in the 
coming months,” said Igor Kudrik, a 
researcher at the Bellona Foundation in 
Oslo. [|

a national catastrophe 
The floods that ravaged the Chang 
= Jiang (Yangtze-Kiang, literally the 
“Long River”) basin this year were the 
most serious since 1954, and flooding in 
northeast China was the worst in recorded 
history. 
However, compared to the situation in 
1954, the volume of water in this year’s 
Yangtze flooding “was not very great”, 
says Lu Qinkan, a former official in 
China’s Ministry of Water Resources who 
has been monitoring the river since the 
1940s. And yet the damage is more 
serious. Atmospheric physicist Tao 
Shiyan, a member of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, concludes that 
unfavourable weather conditions “were 
not fully responsible” for a disaster which, 
according to official sources, claimed 
more than 3,000 lives between June and 
August this year, affected 223 million 
persons and almost a quarter of the 
country’s arable land, destroyed nearly 
five million dwellings, and caused damage 
costing 166 billion yuan (around $21 
billion). 
A hefty price tag 
for neglect 
How could such catastrophic flooding 
have occurred? Lu attributes the problem 
to the river’s inability to release its 
floodwater efficiently. “The key factor in 
controlling the Yangtze’s floods is overall 
planning for storage and above all for 
discharge of floodwaters,” he says. “Laid 
down in the 1950s, it remains a good 
principle today. Unfortunately the balance 
has always been skewed in favour of storage 
behind dams.” Now many sections of the 
dikes and embankments which total 3,570 
km in length along the lower and middle 
reaches of the Yangtze and “are essential to 
enchance the river’s capacity to discharge 
floodwater” are badly in need of repair. T his 
summer, seepage, cracks, and collapses 
occurred at thousands of points, showing 
that the dikes were weak. 
Given the length and width of the 
Yangtze, Lu explains, if the height of the 
dikes was raised by an average of one metre,

an additional 7,500 cubic metres of water 
could be discharged per second (20 billion 
cubic metres per month). However, a ten- 
year plan drawn up in 1980 to heighten and 
reinforce the Yangtze’s dikes has never been 
fully carried out, Lu adds. If it had, “this 
year’s disaster would have been 
considerably alleviated.” 
The water authorities explain that the 
delay is due to shortage of funds. Whereas 
4.8 billion yuan ($1.6 billion at the then 
rate) were needed to finance 34 projects in 
1980, only 399 million yuan had been 
invested by 1987, and only 12 projects had 
been launched. One exception is Jiangxi 
province, the final stage of the river’s course 
before it enters the East China Sea. 
Authorities there have spent around 7 
billion yuan on flood defence work since 
the early 1990s,about one seventh of it on 
dikes along the Yangtze. 
But the price of neglect elsewhere has 
been high. Damage caused by Yangtze 
flooding in 1995, 1996 and this year has 
cost at least 200 billion yuan ($25 billion). 
This sum represents nearly 40 times the 
budget for the 1980 plan and amounts to 
two-thirds of the total investment needed 
for the controversial Three Gorges Dam 
project. Many engineers believe that this 
dam, when completed, could help tame the 
Yangtze floods, but others, including Lu, 
are sceptical. As an adviser to the expert 
panel on flood control during the feasibility 
study carried out in the 1980s, he maintains 
that the dam’s flood control capacity “will 
only be limited”. 
Located near Yichang, where the 
Yangtze emerges from narrow gorges 
before entering its flatter middle reaches, 
the dam may help to control upstream 
floods. But this year’s deadly floods were

With a total storage capacity of 39.3

Reservoir will have a flood control capacity 
of 22.2 billion cubic metres, Lu says, a 
figure “that is far exceeded by the river’s 
gross flood volume.” He maintains that the

investment at the expense of basic local

More than 200 million Chinese were affected by this year’s floods. 
and Natural Resources, predicts that the 
dam will result in more downstream 
sedimentation, which will affect the river’s 
capacity to discharge floodwater. 
Hundreds of 
lost lakes 
In fact, says Yu Xiaogan, a senior 
geographer with the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, the river bed in a number of 
stretches has already risen by 5 to 14 metres 
above surrounding field levels as a result of 
sedimentation. “In those sections the 
Yangtze has already become a hanging 
river,” he says. “And that is very 
dangerous.” 
He believes that misuse of riverside land 
and adjoining lakes have also aggravated 
the problem. As a result of population 
pressure, the surface areas of Dongting and 
Boyang lakes, two of the major detention 
basins for Yangtze floods, have shrunk by 
46 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in 
the past forty years. Their storage capacity 
has decreased from more than 30 billion to 
around 17 billion cubic metres. Hubei, 
once known as “the province of a thousand 
lakes”, had 1,066 lakes in the late 1950s. 
Now there are only 182. Consequently, 
floodwaters that might have been stored in 
lakes are now inundating cities,towns and 
fields that occupy dried out land. Whereas 
the region had 100,000 inhabitants in 
1954, 20,000 of whom had to move out 
when danger threatened, today there are 
half a million, 330,000 of whom have to be 
removed when the waters rise. 
Deforestation and land erosion in the 
upper reaches of the Yangtze have also 
aggravated the floods. Between 1977 and 
1997, according to the National 
Environmental Protection Agency, 14 
million cubic metres of wood were 
destroyed annually in southwest China. 
Between 1957 and 1997, the area scarred 
by soil erosion in the Yangtze basin 
expanded from 363,800 to 569,700 square 
kilometres, or from 20.2 per cent to 31.5 
per cent of the basin’s area. “Falling on 
thick forest, 50 mm of rainfall won’t have 
any bad effect because all of it is absorbed,” 
says Jin Jianming, an adviser to the 
National Environmental Protection 
Agency. “But on exposed ground, just 30 
mm of rainfall will run off and cause 
floods.” 
“Nature’s revenge on China’s neglect 
of ecology over the years”, is Yu Xiaogan’s 
verdict on this year’s floods. “We used to 
consider ourselves ‘masters of nature’and 
tried to conquer it,” says Liu Shukun, a 
hydrologist with the Ministry of Water 
Resources. “Now we must learn to respect 
nature like a good host.” u

Two cheers for 
industry 
Er industry’s contribution to climate 
ange by producing acid rain, eating away at 
the ozone layer and polluting water has decreased 
since 1995,according to a recent survey carried 
out by the European Environment Agency (EEA). 
“In Western Europe, environmental objectives are 
becoming integrated into industrial decision- 
making, resulting in falling total industrial 
emissions to air and water,” a report on the survey 
says. 
However, there are two bits of bad news First, 
this attitude is as yet “not common in Eastern 
Europe”, and second, small and medium-sized 
firms are far less green-oriented than bigger ones 
and are reluctant to take “ effective environmental 
measures’ . 
If industry could do more, the three other“ key 
sectoral driving forces” affecting Europe’s 
environment— transport, energy and 
agriculture— also still have some way to go. 
Transport of goods by road has increased by 54 
per cent since 1980 and car-borne passenger 
transport by 46 per cent since 1985. Road 
congestion and atmospheric and noise pollution 
are getting worse. And the future looks bleak 
because of the huge influence of political habit, 
which encourages the growth of infrastructures 
and the decline of public in favour of private 
transport. 
In agriculture, the use of non-organic fertilizers 
and pesticides has levelled off, but water 
consumption continues to increase while rivers are 
threatened by excessive plant growth 
(eutrophication). “ Environmental considerations 
are still only a small part” of the European Union’s 
Common Agricultural Policy, the report says 
Europe also has little to boast about when it 
comes to energy consumption. This has fallen by 
23 per cent in the former communist countries 
since 1990 because of the economic crisis there. 
But emission of pollutants is expected to rise 
quickly when economic recovery takes place. 
Western Europe is only increasing its energy 
efficiency by about one per cent a year, while its 
gross domestic product (GDP) is growing by 
between 2 and 3 per cent. 
It is hard to see how the European Union 
countries will be able to meet their commitment 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent 
by the year 2010. [|

Efforts to provide them with vocational training, formally or

and dressmaking. 
Despite satisfactory results, Millicent 
had to break off her education during 
secondary school when her parents, who 
had little money, decided that her brother 
should be the one to be educated. But they 
offered to send her to a Catholic missionary 
school which taught girls dressmaking. She 
did not complete the course there either, 
once again for lack of money. “However I 
did learn how to make simple clothes for 
women and children,” she said, “but I really 
wanted to complete the training so I could 
be fully qualified.” 
So she went off to Nairobi and with 
help from her uncle found an 
apprenticeship in a dressmaking shop. 
There, she worked alongside other girls, 
some of whom had not been able to finish 
their schooling because of unwanted 
pregnancies. This problem affects nearly 
10,000 Kenyan girls every year, reducing 
their chances of getting an education and 
adding to the list of disadvantages— 
regional, economic and social—that they 
have to cope with.

John was born in Mathare,a poor part

who was unable to provide for the family. 
When he was eight years old,he became a 
“parking boy”, or street child. After 
spending three years at a community centre 
which cares for such children,he returned 
to wandering the streets of the capital and 
was eventually arrested by the police, who 
threw him in jail for a few weeks. “They

were taken in by the Undugu Society,” a

children, provides them with a basic 
education and finds them jobs with 
craftsmen who give them a technical 
training paid for by the Society. “I saw kids 
learn to be carpenters that way, so I decided 
to do that too,” said John, who was then 
apprenticed to a woodworker. 
“This kind of rehabilitation aims to help 
young people do productive work by 
placing them in a workshop run by a 
craftsman respected for his ability to train 
people,” said a teacher at the Undugu 
Society. Social workers advise the children 
on the choice of a trade and visit them each 
week in their workshops to see how they 
are getting on and to organize on a step-

Qualified 
but jobless 
Despite the government’s efforts to 
encourage technical education, the network 
of some 2,000 public and private vocational 
training centres absorbs little more than 
one per cent of the school-age population. 
These institutions attract young people 
with a good school record whose poorly- 
educated parents have the means to pay the 
fees. But the centres have serious financial 
problems, despite the support of 
development aid organizations. 
Some centres, like the “youth 
polytechnics”, do not always have enough 
funds to equip their workshops and raise 
cash from the local community and from 
selling items made by the young 
apprentices. All the same, the apprentices 
manage to acquire some qualifications, but 
many surveys show that in spite of their 
technical education only a few of them find 
a job when they leave.Good qualifications 
seem to be less important than knowing the 
right person when looking for a job 
commensurate with the training they have 
received. 
In recent years, vocational training 
centres have been criticized because of their 
high running costs, the relatively few places 
‘After my apprenticeship, | want to take courses at a 
technical school and then set up as a carpenter’ 
  
available in them and the lack of results as 
regards placing apprentices in jobs. 
In view of this problem and a situation 
in which more than half the country’s 
children drop out of school every year after 
primary education, the Kenyan authorities 
have begun to reform the educational 
system (see box). The length of primary 
schooling has been extended from seven 
years to eight and now includes some 
technical education.T he goal is to give the 
children some practical skills so they can 
move on to some kind of training or 
professional activity in the jua kali sector. 
At the same time, the government has 
launched a major initiative to support and 
boost the prestige of these kinds of jobs. It »

### 114144: A Two speed reform

A two-speed reform 
The Kenyan government began an 
I educational reform programme in 1985 
which substantially altered syllabus content 
and educational structures, putting more 
emphasis on pre-vocational training that 
would be useful to pupils as soon as they 
finished their schooling. The programme aims 
to adapt the educational system to the 
country’s needs, reduce inequalities by 
building new schools in poorer regions and, 
especially, to solve the problem of those who 
find themselves looking for a job without any 
vocational training. 
Such schooling must instil techniques and 
knowledge which will be useful for the 
country’s development and prepare young 
people to hone their skills in vocational 
training institutes or set themselves up as 
craftspeople. 
Technical, farming and artistic subjects 
have been added to the primary school 
curriculum, which was previously limited to 
subjects like English, mathematics and 
history. An arts and crafts course teaches 
design, painting, decoration, pottery and 
working with leather, wood and metal. It 
enables those who drop out of school early to 
make use of these practical skills in their 
communities, producing tables, chairs, 
baskets and kitchen utensils. 
For the past three years,surveys have been 
measuring the impact of the teaching of these 
technical subjects. They show that the least- 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
equipped schools offer little choice of courses 
and that the pupils are divided up according to 
social origins and gender. The methods of the 
teachers have also not changed despite the 
reforms, because of their slender knowledge of 
the specialist subjects. 
The new educational system is presently 
coming in for a lot of criticism. The 
complaints include the hastiness of the 
reforms—Iess than a third of the schools have 
workshops—overloaded courses and poor 
calculation of costs, especially for families 
which are sometimes forced to sell several 
head of cattle to pay for a child’s schooling. 
The schools ask parents to supply their 
children with all the materials they need to 
make the craft items. So education is far from 
being free and equal. State schools, especially 
secondary schools, sometimes demand 
registration fees which are double or even 
treble the amount set by the ministry of 
education. So good students from poor 
families sometimes cannot sign on at the best 
schools, while those from wealthier families 
but with only average results can. 
This double standard is the main criticism 
of the new educational system.T he result is 
that many pupils and their parents are now 
A.R nm waiting for a reform of the reforms.

Schools and 
sponsors for 
Cambodia’s 
children 
en-year-old Chev lives in Mondulkiri province, 
T in the highlands of southeastern Cambodia, 
and belongs to the Phnong ethnic minority. He 
and his family are a long way from the regional 
capital, Sem Monorum,and for six months of the 
year he cannot get to school because bad weather 
makes the roads impassable. 
The provindal governor has appealed for help 
to the Association for Sponsoring Cambodian 
Children (ASPECA), a French non-governmental 
organization set up in 1991 which runs sixty 
centres around the country housing more than 
5,000 orphans or street children. The governor’s 
request comes because of the very difficult living 
conditionsin thisremote and sparsely-populated 
region. 
ASPECA does two things. It builds schools in 
the countryside and has put up a reception centre 
in Sem Monorum for orphans. It also arranges the 
sponsoring of the very poorest children. 
Chev is “ looked after” by a woman living in 
France who has agreed to pay for his food, health 
care, school fees and clothing for as long as he 
needs. He writes regular letters to her promising 
to make good use of his opportunities and to work 
hard. 
Most of the 4,200 sponsors are men and 
women in Western Europe and Canada.ASPECA 
has already built a dozen traditional wooden 
houses with thatched roofs in Sem Monorum to 
house the children who live furthest away from 
school. 
Last February, UNESCO signed a co-operation 
agreement with ASPECA. Under it, the children 
have received basic school materials and schools 
have been equipped with libraries. The initiative is 
part of a bigger programme to expand primary 
and secondary education in a country where 
nearly half the population is under fifteen and 
more than 150,000 children are orphans or down 
on their luck. [|

International migrations 
have never taken place to 
such a massive extent—on a 
scale that is even higher 
between countries of the 
South than between South 
and North. But while 
numbers seem to be growing 
inexorably, more and more 
obstacles are being put in 
place to keep them down. 
And while the motives for 
migration continue to be 
poverty, oppression and war, 
receiving countries are 
offering a cooler welcome to 
immigrant workers. Frontiers 
are closing, police 
intervention is being 
stepped up. One often-heard 
argument for this is that 
there are fewer and fewer 
jobs. The fact is, however, 
that immigration gives rise 
to many prejudices because 
of a reflex that is as perverse 
asit is ancient: fear of 
change fuels a search for 
scapegoats, and immigrants, 
the “foreigners” on the 
doorstep, are tailor-made for 
this role because of their 
“difference” and their 
vulnerability. 
Statistics on immigration quoted in

from article to article, reflecting the

### 114145: Myths and realities

Myths and realities 
Demetrios G. Papademetriou* 
The globalization of international migration makes it more 
important than ever for receiving countries to grasp its 
complexities rather than retreat into a siege mentality 
The complex effects of international migration 
today touch the lives of more people and loom 
politically and economically larger in more 
countries and more world regions than ever before. 
The phenomenon’s causes, however, have remained 
largely the same: economic and personal insecurity, 
intolerance, economic and political exclusion, 
oppression, various forms of chaos and catastrophe, 
conflict and war. 
Most of these conditions, however, are typically 
not sufficient to start or suddenly expand a 
migration flow to a substantial degree. For that to 
happen, certain preconditions must already be in 
place. Most notable among them are the pre- 
existence of a long-term political and economic 
relationship; the presence of an anchor ethnic 
community in the country of destination that can 
advocate the admission of an immigrant group and 
assist with its transportation and integration; a 
loosely regulated labour market that values and 
can absorb newcomers effectively; and an overall 
philosophical opposition to the circumstances 
migrants are attempting to leave by key 
constituencies in the prospective destination 
country. 
Moving towards 
control and exclusion 
These preconditions have become easier to 
meet over the last two decades, and as a result 
international migration’s reach is now global. 
Hence, it is more important than ever to take stock 
of its dimensions and significance, particularly 
because interest and reliance on it by the South are 
intensifying while responses to it by the North 
(increasingly geared toward control and exclusion) 
are converging more than ever before. 
The universalization of international migration 
and the realization that most forms of it are highly 
likely to continue and expand require that we 
understand it better than we do now. This need is 
also urgent because the North is in the throes of a 
fundamental intellectual reappraisal of the value of 
most migration. I propose that we think of 
international migration as a system,rather than as 
a series of events. Doing so allows the analysis to 
encompass migration processes regardless of the 
causes and characteristics of a specific flow, of 
whether it is organized or spontaneous, 
“permanent” or “temporary”, legally sanctioned 
or “irregular.” It also allows the analyst to move 
beyond the dichotomies that classify states as either 
“sending” or “receiving”, reasons for leaving as 
either to improve one’s economic circumstances or 
to protect oneself from persecution, and people 
who move as either permanent settlers or 
temporary residents. 
A two-way system 
of arrivals and departures 
Today, most states simultaneously send and 
receive immigrants. Similarly, most people move 
for complex combinations of economic, social, 
cultural and political reasons. T he ideal categories 
on which legal classifications of prospective 
immigrants are based are increasingly unable to 
accommodate this complex mix of motives. The 
resulting confusion makes the fit between theory 
and reality tenuous and undermines popular 
support for a country’s entire admissions system. 
Furthermore, “permanent” immigrants often 
move to yet another destination or return to their 
homes (as many as half the members of most 
immigrant groups that came to the United States 
in the first half of the twentieth century had 
returned to their homes by the 1950s). Finally, 
large proportions of “temporary” migrants stay 
abroad for long periods of time with or without 
the authorization to do so, or convert to permanent 
status. 
Understanding international migration properly 
is important for another reason. The quality (and 
effectiveness) of policies cannot be better than the 
analysis that helps policy makers understand an 
Today, most states simultaneously send and receive immigrants. 
Similarly, most people move for complex combinations of economic, 
social, cultural and political reasons

issue and supports the response. Hence, it should 
be no surprise when a poorly-conceived policy fails 
to “solve” the problem. And when politics enters 
the mix, the prescription may be even further off the 
mark. 
The following example demonstrates both 
points vividly. When the United States either 
misunderstands or disregards the motivations of 
many irregular Mexican migrants—who may prefer 
to have a “sojourner”relationship to the US—and 
ignores the social and economic fundamentals that 
make such workers attractive to US employers, its 
policy responses of tighter border controls and the 
equivocal prohibition of unauthorized employment

will not address effectively the complex challenge of 
irregular migration from Mexico. In fact,the most 
predictable consequences of such policies are as 
follows: a) that they would turn short-term 
migrants into long-term immigrants; b) that they 
would fuel the growth of increasingly fraudulent 
documents and organized trafficking industries; 
and c) that they would undermine the quality of 
working conditions for all workers active in the 
same sectors as irregular workers (whose 
increasingly tenuous status makes them accept 
virtually any conditions of work). This is precisely 
what has happened. 
If the scope of the issue is so broad and the 
politics surrounding it so complex—and 
deteriorating—what about migration’s magnitude? 
Roughly 120 million persons may live outside their 
countries of origin. Most of them enter other 
states, especially those in the North, through highly 
regulated channels. Excluding refugees, who at any 
point comprise about 20 per cent of that total,

family reunification migrants and legal temporary 
workers are the two largest components of the total 
number. 
It is important to note that total immigration 
has grown at an evolutionary, rather than 
revolutionary rate and that the magnitude of some 
of its components (such as legal temporary 
workers) has in fact decreased over the last decade 
or so. What has increased (way out of proportion 
with the evidence) is the popular impression that 
the North is in a state of siege by the citizens of 
the South. 
About three out of five international immigrants 
are found in the North. The overwhelming majority 
All world regions now 
have significant numbers 
of foreign-born persons 
in their midst 
of them have gotten there through legal channels or 
otherwise hold legal statuses. Many of the rest are in 
the North at the implicit “invitation” of some of 
the receiving societies’ most powerful sectors (such 
as employers) and with at least some forbearance 
from the authorities. And even those in irregular 
situations tend to be among the most energetic and 
motivated young persons the South has available, 
that is, persons who are least likely to be a burden 
to the receiving society. 
All world regions now have significant numbers 
of foreign-born persons in their midst, but origins 
and density vary widely both within and across 
regions. Oceania 1s the most “immigrant-dense” 
region, with about five million foreign-born persons 
(about one in five persons.) Next in immigrant 
density is the area in the Americas occupied by 
Canada and the United States, with about one 
immigrant in nine or ten persons (including 
irregulars). 
Perhaps surprisingly for many Europeans, the 
European Union (EU )-cum-Switzerland now have 
a foreign-born population whose size is comparable 
to that of US/Canada, although the larger 
population of those 16 countries makes them less 
immigrant-dense as a whole—about one in eleven 
or twelve persons (including irregulars,again). 
Inconvenient 
truths 
Immigration to the remaining two world regions 
is overwhelmingly intra-regional. Asia has about 
one third or more of all international migrants. 
While the most immigrant-dense part of Asia by 
far is the Middle East, western and parts of 
southern Asia are teeming with refugees while south 
and southeast Asia are heavily engaged in most 
forms of international migration. 
Finally, Africa, with about 10 per cent of all 
international migrants,may be the region with the 
greatest fluctuations in the size of that population. »

This is partly because it is in Africa that most 
refugee-generating events have occurred in the last u - 
two decades, but also where some recent successful Wo Y | d m | rat | 0 Nn 
large-scale repatriations have taken place.Equally 
important,perhaps, are the traditions of temporary 
movements among neighbouring populations and 
the role of post-apartheid South Africa as a hy 
powerful magnet for citizens from throughout sub- 
Saharan Africa. 
: J) Considering the topic’s political salience, it ww 
might be a good idea to close this essay with some 
“inconvenient” truths. The most important of these 
may be that notwithstanding the wishful thinking of 
some politicians and nationalist zealots in the 
North, the progress of their countries’ formal 
economy toward the age of information makes self- ; 
sufficiency in many types of workers unrealistic— 
particularly when considering most of the North’s 
demographic deficits and their attendant aging and 
social security solvency issues.

Furthermore, the North’s march toward a high 
technology future will not eliminate the large 
complement of low-wage, difficult, seasonal, and 
socially undesirable jobs. Nor is the North likely to 
find the political courage either to compel its un- 
and under-employed to take these jobs or simply to 
surrender these jobs to the South. As a result, it 
might be better for the North to acknowledge that 
immigration provides its societies with prospective 
members who are eager to use such jobs as entry 
points to the North’s economies and as access ; 
South America 
routes to the full rewards of its social and political 500,000

And as this process results in more diverse 
populations, the next chapter in human progress—

Low wages, 
big transfers 
Ithough they usually earn low wages, collectively 
A manage to send substantial sums of money 
to their countries of origin. In fact, these countries generally 
receive more money from their citizens working abroad 
than they do in official development assistance (ODA). 
Since the early 1990s, immigrants have been sending 
about $70 billion a year to their countries of origin by official 
channels, according to the International Monetary Fund, 
whereas official development assistance in 1996, for 
example, amounted to an estimated $58 billion. If it is 
calculated that each migrant helps five or six people at 
home, between 200 and 240 million people around the 
world depend on the support of friends or family members 
working abroad. 
According to the Organization for Economic Co- 
operation and Development (OECD), immigrants’ 
remittances represent an important source of foreign 
exchange for many developing countries. In Egypt, for 
example, financial transfers were the leading source of 
external revenue in the 1980s, bringing in as much money 
as tourism receipts and tolls paid on the Suez Canal. In 
Tunisia, they now represent about five per cent of gross 
domestic product, 50 per cent of payments to service the 
national debt and 10 per cent of the balance of payments. 
In Yemen, official transfers from migrants amount to 150 per 
cent of export revenue, while the sums sent to Haiti account 
for six per cent of gross national product. 
It isimportant to bear in mind that these calculations 
are based on official transactions— money sent through 
banks or post offices, as well as “institutional” transfers 
like retirement benefits sent to immigrants’ home countries 
through governmental agreements It is extremely difficult 
to make an accurate assessment of amounts sent through 
informal networks 
Immigrants also invest considerable sums on making 
purchases abroad and then sending them by various means 
to their countries of origin. These “ exports”, ranging from 
photocopy and fax machines bought to set up a business, to 
antibiotics and clothing— may equal or even surpass 
financial transfers. Migrants often also bring back from host 
countries managerial or technical skills, whose value is more 
difficult to calculate, along with new perspectives on issues 
like education and democracy, particularly with regard to 
women’srights and status. u

### 114147: Who goes where?

Who goes where? 
Gildas Smon* 
A world-wide overview of immigration— host countries, numbers, 
ways and means, goals and traditions 
  
* University of Poitiers, France 
The very word “hosting” is ambiguous when 
applied to immigrants, so many and varied are 
the ways of devising, practising and approaching 
the operation it purports to describe. A very wide 
range of situations and behaviour exists in the space 
between the formal opening of borders to foreigners 
and offering them a warm welcome, between official 
speeches and the attitude of the bureaucrat at the 
guichet, and between cultures and eras. How should 
we categorize the different “host countries”, in the 
broadest sense of the term—that is, countries that 
receive immigrants? 
The most obvious yardstick is numbers. This means 
either the annual number of legal entries into a country 
or the number of immigrants who have been there for 
some time. By this criterion, two countries stand out. 
First is the United States (720,000 entriesin 1995, but 
1.8 million in 1991, including 1.1 million whose status 
was regularized by a law passed in 1986). Germany 
comes a close second (800,000 in 1995, 1.2 million in 
1991), and easily leads the European field where 
immigration is concerned. Next comes a group of 
countries (Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, 
France, Australia and Israel), which take in an 
average of between 100,000 and 200,000 legal 
immigrants every year. 
In terms of the number of resident aliens, the 
United States is again top of the list, with 24.6 million 
foreigners living in the country in 1996 (9.3% ofthe 
total population), just ahead of India (8.6 million in 
1990, or 1% ofits population), Pakistan (7.2 million 
or 6%) and Germany (7.1 million, 8.8%). 
Another group ishome to between two and four 
million immigrants—Australia (3.7 million in 1991, 
22.3% of its population), Canada (4.3 million in 
1991,16.1%), France (3.6 million in 1990, 6.3%), 
the United Kingdom (2 million in 1995, 3.4%), 
Saudi Arabia (4 million, 25.7% in 1990), Cdte 
d’Ivoire (3.4 million, 29.7%) and Hong Kong (2.2 
million,39.9%). 
These percentages already show the wide 
variation in the proportion of foreigners to the local 
population. In some other countries, this proportion 
is very high. Top of the list are sparsely-populated,oil- »

rich countries where immigrants are actually in the 
majority—Qatar (63.7%), Kuwait (71.6%) and the 
United Arab Emirates (90.1% in 1990). The figures 
for Saudi Arabia,Bahrein,Oman,Brunei and Libya 
ranged from 25% to 35% in 1990. 
A second group of countries with a high 
proportion of immigrants consists of very small 
countries, mainly Caribbean or Pacific islands or 
small states which often have some special status, 
such as being a tax haven. They include Luxembourg 
(37.8% foreigners), Macao (44.7%) and Monaco 
(67%). 
A third category comprises very large but still 
sparsely populated “new countries”, such as 
Canada and Australia (16% to 22%). Other 
possible members of this category are the countries 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
A fourth group is made up of Western industrial 
democracies where the proportion of immigrants 
(much lower than generally supposed) is between 
Few states, including some of the 
major receiving countries, have 
ratified the international 
conventions dealing with the 
treatment of immigrants 
 
three and 10%.This includes most member states 
of the European Union (those mentioned above 
plus Austria and Belgium: 9%, and Sweden and 
The Netherlands: 5%). The United States could 
also be added to this group. Switzerland, with 
18.9% in 1995, stands out here, but its geographical 
position, history and fiscal policy perhaps suggest 
that it should belong to the second group. 
The existence of a tradition of receiving 
immigrants creates another set of categories, with 
important implications for demography (age 
structure, fertility rate), administrative and legal status 
and economic, social and cultural integration. T he list 
includes countries with both long-established and 
more recent pro-immigration policies, but also those 
states which have changed their policies in the past 
few years. 
In the developed world, only a few countries 
have had pro-immigration policies for more than a 
century now. They are Germany, France, 
Switzerland and the so-called “new” countries 
“settled” by Europeans—countries such as 
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United 
States. 
But some countries in the South have well- 
established pro-immigration policies too. 
Merchants and workers from India have long been 
received by the Sultanate of Oman, and people of 
the Sahel by Cote d’Ivoire. For the last century or 
more all Asian countries have taken in Chinese and 
Indian immigrants. On the other hand, there are 
the new host countries which have in many cases 
been surprised and alarmed to find themselves a 
2 4 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
magnet for immigration. Spain, Greece and Italy, as 
well as the oil states of the Gulf, the Republic of Korea 
and Thailand are undergoing this new experience, 
which partly explains why they find it hard to decide 
where they stand on this issue. 
“Old” immigration countries which are today 
grappling with serious development problems have 
virtually shut the door on immigrants. T hey include 
Brazil, which has taken in several million from all over 
the world, and Argentina. Both of these countries even 
became, in the 1980s, notable sources of emigration to 
the United States or Europe. 
Why do countries receive immigrants? This is one 
of the key questions which determines the attitude of 
governments and one of the things dividing them—at 
least in theory, since daily reality is much less clear 
cut. Advertising immigration policies is not really a 
government priority, and in the major immigration 
countries the job of receiving immigrants takes many 
different forms and involves complex and sometimes 
contradictory alliances. 
However, three kinds of countries can be 
identified—those which mainly see immigrants as an 
extra or major source of labour, those which openly or 
implicitly allow immigrants to stay permanently, and 
those which take in immigrants for mainly 
humanitarian reasons. 
The first group is easily the biggest:South Africa, 
the Gulf states, Gabon, the emerging economies of 
Asia and Japan until the recent financial crisis and 
most of Western Europe until the first oil crisis, in 
1973-75. 
The second group contains the “old immigration 
countries listed earlier, plus Israel, for which the arrival 
of immigrants (in the sense understood by the Israelis) 
or the return of people who had left is of the greatest 
strategic importance. In this group, in contrast to the 
 
Afghan refugees arrive in 
Moscow. 
Blood and fears 
0 ne major problem facing long-term immigrants is that of acquiring the nationality of the 
country to which they emigrate and all the rights deriving from that status. When 
governments decide whether or not to grant such people citizenship, they apply two doctrines 
which have their origin in Roman law, one based on place of birth,the other on descent. 
The first,known by its Latin name jus soli (literally “ right of the soil” ) is applied by countries 
that are traditionally favourable to immigration. They regard all people born on their territory as 
citizens, whatever their parents’ nationality. This model, of which Sweden, the United States, 
Canada and France are examples, is based on the conviction that cultural diversity is not an 
obstacle to integration. 
The second model, which goes by the name of jus sanguinis, or “blood right”, grants 
nationality in accordance with the principle of descent.A child of immigrants who is born in the 
country where his or her parents live does not enjoy the new nationality but has to take their 
nationality. This principle binds the family to its country of origin and seeks to maintain this link 
from one generation to the next. The blood right principle operates in Japan,for example, and is 
also applied by countries which have traditionally sent large numbers of people abroad, wish to 
avoid a sharp drop in population and,in some cases, want to make it easier for people to return. 
The two principles are not mutually exclusive. For example, a country trying to restrict the 
inflow of immigrants will endeavour to set aside jus soli in favour of jus sanguinis and thus deter 
immigrants from gaining the impression that, on arriving in the country, they are automatically 
guaranteed nationality both for themselves and for their descendants. Obviously care has to be 
taken when such changes in direction are made, because enjoyment of a country’s nationality 
clearly offers political, economic and social advantages, and attempts to restrict them may 
trigger protest. [|

### 114147: Who goes where?

  
first one,the place of immigrants in the society, their 
legal status and their acquisition of nationality are 
issues of central importance and have given rise to 
extensive legislation. 
The countries acting for humanitarian reasons have 
agreed to open their borders to large numbers of 
refugees who have been forced to leave their own 
country either by a natural disaster or more often 
because of war. More than a million Mozambicans 
caught up in a civil war and plagued with famine found 
refuge in neighbouring Malawi, one of the world’s 
poorest countries, between 1975 and 1992. There are 
still five million Afghans in Pakistan and Iran. And 
despite the present closing of most borders, many 
countries have fulfilled this humanitarian role one way 
or another at some time in their recent history. 
A cold 
reception 
As for the yardstick of quality, the handling of 
immigration and treatment of immigrants are extremely 
sensitive matters. They can be measured against the 
words of the Bible: “I was a stranger and you took me 
in.” These words ring in the moral conscience of many 
countries both North and South, but they do not seem 
to be really understood and put into practice. Few states, 
including some of the major receiving countries,have 
ratified the international conventions dealing with the 
treatment of im migrants. 
Without knowing the exact legal situation of 
immigrants in every country, we can still draw a rough 
picture of how things are. A first group contains those 
countries which say openly that they welcome 
immigrants and back up this commitment with a 
sizeable array of laws and other measures to facilitate 
the long-term or permanent settlement of new arrivals. 
These are Australia, Canada and Sweden. In some 
ways, Israel belongs to this group too, but it chooses 
immigrants on a religious or cultural basis. 
A second group consists of those countries which 
in practice receive immigrants but where the reception 
is tempered by frequent displays of mistrust or 
Immigrants on the borderline 
  
discrimination, especially towards the most recent 
arrivals. This happens in most immigration countries 
in the West. Their geographical position, and very 
often their colonial past, the attraction of their 
economic and cultural vitality and the power of their 
media, the quality of their social and educational 
systems—all these factors draw to them the migrants 
of an increasingly nomadic and interconnected 
planet. 
But such a trend causes confusion and sparks 
resistance by a section of society. Most countries 
do not want to admit, much less advertise, their 
openness to immigration, so in practice they find it 
very difficult to come up with clear and coherent 
policies where immigration and integration are 
concerned.So their laws on the matter are wobbly 
: and sometimes contradictory. 
Subject to the whims 
of the authorities 
A foreigner who arrives legally often gets 
greeted, in effect, with folded arms. However,even 
though immigrants may not find themselves in the 
El Dorado or paradise they dreamed of, they do 
get some social and legal protection which enables 
them to plan a future for themselves and their 
children. The situation of illegal immigrants is 
much tougher however. 
Immigrants in the main receiving countries of 
the South (Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the 
Gulf) experience even more precarious conditions. 
T heir status is uncertain, they are totally dependent 
on their employers and are subject to the whims of 
the authorities and the absence of legal recourse. 
This often results in large-scale summary 
deportations of undocumented aliens. Those in this 
third group are much more vulnerable because of 
the economic crisis,especially in Africa and Asia. 
This world overview, inevitably a schematic one, 
passes no judgment on the validity of this or that 
country’s policies, each one of which may have its 
own rationale and justification. But it shows the 
very wide variety of situations immigrants find 
themselves in and also the broad range of attitudes 
of those receiving them. 
As globalization of movement and trade 
advances, along with increasing links everywhere 
which facilitate international mobility, and with the 
arrival in a growing number of countries of new and 
culturally different populations, the age-old question 
of how to “welcome the stranger”, which has so many 
implications and such symbolic meaning, has 
become more urgent than ever. |

Indonesian immigrants look out through the port-holes of a ship on their way back to their country after being deported from Malaysia. 
Vulnerable and ‘different’, immigrants are easy targets when their host 
countries experience hard times 
  
* Editor-in-chief, Migration 
News Sheet 
2 6 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
No major industrialized country can in good faith 
deny the contribution of immigrant labour to its 
prosperity, not even “impenetrable” Japan with its 
some 300,000 clandestine workers. Hardly any of their 
construction projects could have materialized without 
immigrant labour. Nevertheless, despite today’s fast pace 
of globalization, increasing migration movements and 
the accelerating tendency towards cosmopolitan 
societies, immigrant workers are still perpetual and 
universal scapegoats, no more shielded in this respect 
than their predecessors a century ago. 
The intensity of exploitation and rejection may have 
diminished in certain countries, but as always the 
immigrant worker is only admitted to so-called “host 
countries” in order to satisfy labour demand and later 
discarded, very often like a paper handkerchief which has 
served its purpose.E ven people of immigrant origin may 
take part in this rejection; those who have once been 
exploited can themselves become formidable exploiters. 
The human reality of immigration continues to be 
neglected. The migrant worker is seen as nothing more 
than “human capital”, and more as “capital” than 
“human”. T his is so both in developing countries,largely 
because of the present economic crisis, and in the 
industrialized countries, including former sending 
countries, because of the upsurge of nationalism. 
Since the economic turmoil in Southeast Asia began 
in mid-1997, Thailand has expelled some 250,000 
immigrant workers, South Korea has “leniently” allowed 
50,000 illegal immigrants to leave the country instead of 
fining or imprisoning them, and Malaysia has already 
deported some 50,000 Indonesian workers, granting a 
two-month amnesty as from 1 September 1998 for 
illegal workers to leave the country voluntarily or face 
sanctions. These numbers do not include those who 
migrated internally, from the rural areas to the cities, 
and have now been forced to return to their villages. 
Immigrant workers in Africa have not been 
spared.One of the more recent examples is that of 
South Africa, which after having succeeded in 
putting an end to the apartheid regime,intensified 
its fight against clandestine immigrants whose 
labour was no longer required.Between 1992 and 
1995, South Africa expelled almost 400,000 
African workers, mainly Mozambicans whose 
government had played such an active role against 
apartheid.(See pages 28-29). 
Contributing more 
than they receive 
In industrialized countries, globalization has 
provoked, inter alia, the development of 
nationalism, supported largely by those who have 
become marginalized, unable to keep up with 
increasing competitiveness. Faced with an 
increasing mass of discontented citizens, politicians 
in search of electoral themes choose the easy way 
out. It is more difficult to get across to the public 
complicated explanations of economic theory, 
global trade and financial markets than it is to to 
attack new arrivals, depriving them of access to 
social security programmes so that “savings” thus 
made may be used to aid the poor nationals. 
Meanwhile, in all the industrialized countries, 
immigrants’ contributions to social protection 
systems are higher than the benefits they receive. 
Once considered to be the exclusive capital of 
the far right, the use of immigrants as scapegoats is 
now tempting other parties across the spectrum, 
from the right to the left. The United States, the 
world’s most powerful industrialized nation, which 
owes its prosperity and very existence to the arrival of 
waves of immigrants, is not exempt. T he situation is 
even more absurd in Australia, a continent of   
caddie

immigration located in the Asia-Pacific region, where 
the immigrant scapegoat is designated by his or her 
colour and ethnicity. Pauline Hanson’s anti- 
immigrant party does not point the finger at 
European immigrants, mostly of modest 
background, but rather at Asians who have generally 
poured substantial investment into the country and 
at Aborigines whose ancestors lived in Australia well 
before the arrival of immigrant settlers, including 
the ancestors of M's Hanson's supporters. (See article 
page 33). However, the target may not only not bea 
foreigner, but be of the same “colour” and “ethnic 
group” as his or her attackers: in June 1989 a 
southern Italian was beaten to death in Verona by a 
group of northerners. Very often, in Africa for 
example, there is nothing physical or cultural to 
distinguish an attacked immigrant from his or her 
attackers. 
The mechanism is immutable and implacable: 
In all the industrialized countries, 
immigrants’ contributions to 
social protection systems 
are higher than the benefits 
they receive 
a culprit—even an imaginary one—for the 
difficulties afflicting a country must always be 
found. When there is no foreigner to fit the bill,the 
mechanism acts against those who are considered 
different (see the history of Jewish communities) 
or vulnerable (women). But immigrants are easy 
targets because they are particularly vulnerable as 
well as being “different”. They are generally not 
allowed to vote. In developing countries, shifting 
the blame on immigrants is easy because of the 
weakness or absence of democratic institutions to 
uphold their rights. In industrialized countries it is 
no more difficult to incite public opinion against 
immigrants by invoking the right of freedom of 
expression, despite the fact that exercise of this right 
may jeopardize their fundamental rights. 
Steps towards progress in the social field and 
in fundamental and legal rights of immigrants now 
seem to have come to a halt, and the timid 
achievements realized so far are threatened. After 
ten years of arduous negotiations within the United 
Nations,its General Assembly finally approved on 
18 December 1990 the new International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of their Families 
(Resolution 45/158). This is the first-ever 
international instrument with a broad definition of 
the rights of migrant workers which offers some 
means to ensure compliance with the provisions by 
contracting states. 
Twenty states must ratify the convention before it 
can come into force. Almost eight years later, only 
nine states have done so (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Cape Verde, Colombia, Egypt, Morocco, the 
Immigrants on the borderline 
 
Philippines, Seychelles,Sri Lanka and Uganda) and 
two (Chile and the initiating state, Mexico) have only 
signed it. Not one “host country” is on the list. In the 
meantime, migrant workers may rely essentially on 
two limited instruments of the International Labour 
Organisation, namely the Migration for Employment 
Convention (Revised) of 1949, ratified by forty-one 
states, and its supplementary provisions approved in 
1975, which have been ratified by eighteen states. 
A return ticket 
for the baker 
A well-known cartoon shows a Frenchman who 
accused foreign workers of “stealing the bread” of 
French people and was unable to buy bread one 
morning because his baker, of immigrant origin, 
had returned to his home country. This once 
actually happened in the French city of 
Montbéliard. 
In 1979-1980,about 35 per cent of the foreign 
workers living in Montbéliard’s twenty-three 
satellite towns, affected by the declining automobile 
industry, accepted the French Government’s offer 
of a “return premium”. Nowhere else in France 
was the acceptance rate so high and the 
consequences were disastrous: schools had to close 
down because of insufficient pupils, and many 
shops, restaurants and other businesses had to stop 
trading for lack of clients. This example clearly 
shows that foreign workers are not merely providers 
of labour. They and their familities are also 
indispensable components of the society in which 
they live and have their own role to play. u 
Racism always

Xenophobic voices 
‘Or people first!” (Belgium),“ Out with the filth!” (Austria),“ Hungarians are like Aids!” 
(Romania), France for the French!” (France). 
With only slight variations, all far right-wing political parties hammer away with the same 
slogan: expel immigrants and everything will be better. The message, which has the merit of 
simplicity, have proved attractive to many Such ideas have contaminated a sizeable number of 
voters in Austria, Italy, France, the Aemish part of Belgium, Denmark and the Czech Republic, where 
nationalist parties are doing better and better at the polls. At recent elections, they have been 
getting between 10 and 20 per cent of the vote, often entering government, at least at the local 
level. They are also gaining ground in the former communist countries, including what was once 
East Germany. For the moment, however, they have made no headway in Spain or the United 
Kingdom. 
Europe may be the world’s current stronghold of the organized far right,but sadly— as the 
case of Australia shows— it has no monopoly on xenophobic ideologies. Racist ideas seem to be 
among the world’s most widely-shared, manifesting themselves in a multitude of ways. 
In the United States, which has taken in more than 55 million immigrants since 1820,there 
isa growing number of organizations which, like the Ku Klux Klan, campaign for white supremacy; 
nearly 150 of them are thought to exist today. And the mainstream Republican Party sometimes 
takes an anti-immigrant line worthy of some nationalist parties in Europe. An example was Bob 
Dole’s presidential campaign in California in 1996. 
Elsewhere in the world— in some African and Asian countries, for example— governments 
have no problem adopting extreme right-wing policies deporting thousands of people at times 
of economic crisis. Meanwhile, it is a remarkable fact that three Latin American countries— Peru, 
Ecuador and Argentina— have in recent years elected presidents of immigrant origin. |

indivisible through time in South Africa.Songs 
and lore feature the trains which brought the 
first migrant workers to South Africa in the early 
twentieth century from the neighbouring countries 
of Namibia, Zambia,Zimbabwe, Mozambique and 
Lesotho. 
Millions of miners have come to dig gold from 
the mines which burrow deep into the earth, and 
many other migrants have tilled and coaxed fruit 
from the soil in South Africa’s northern provinces. 
For decades, South Africa’s wealth has relied on the 
labour it imports from other African countries. 
Under apartheid, migration policy was used to 
encourage white immigrants to come to the country 
to shore up the numbers of the ruling minority. 
They were given incentives to locate here and many 
non-governmental organizations were established 
to help them settle. Most white South Africans 
carry dual citizenship. 
On the other hand, black labourers were 
brought in on contract to keep the mines and the 
farms going—the mining and agricultural sectors 
are two of the biggest contributors to the gross 
domestic product. But with the demand for gold 
drying up, the lacklustre sales figures have meant 
that hundreds of thousands of miners from across 
the region have been retrenched. 
There is a surfeit of local unskilled labour in South 
a The train and the migrant have become Africa, yet thousands still flock in from the region 
every day in search of a living. The country is far 
wealthier than other countries in the region—it is 
responsible for 83 per cent of the regional gross 
national product. On top of this, many believe that 
South Africa has a political responsibility to contribute 
to the development of southern Africa because of past 
policies to destabilize neighbouring countries. 
Xenophobia in needy districts 
These immigrants show that South Africa has 
joined the heaving global movement of humanity in 
search of a better life. It is a receiver nation: from 
Somalia and Morocco, car-loads of immigrants make 
the hostile twenty-day trip loaded down with goods 
to sell. Ghanaians have entered the retail business 
with flair, introducing new fashions to the tip of the 
continent. Nigerians have set up cocaine cartels, 
joining an Italian and Eastern European mafia long- 
established on these shores. Taiwanese run the 
poaching businesses in the fishing industry and 
women from nearby Mozambique and faraway 
Manila sell their bodies in the city streets. 
These people have become an easy target for 
South Africans who toil in a country of grinding 
poverty, growing joblessness and a declining 
economy. As with many countries in the world, the 
xenophobia is worse in poor, working-class areas.

hawkers chase and confiscate the goods of African 
and Asian hawkers have grown in the past four years. 
Vigilantes attack migrants in the inner cities and in the 
shack lands. 
The derogatory term makwerekwere—a crude 
onomatopoeic imitation of how foreigners speak— 
is used to describe foreigners as “those we don’t 
understand”, and newspapers abound with the fiery 
rhetoric of xenophobes. “These people carry 
diseases which they spread around and they infect 
us,” said a young shop-owner in Alexandra 
township, a poor area near Johannesburg. Others 
complain that “They take our jobs” and “are willing 
to work for less than us.” The xenophobia has 
become so dangerous that some describe it as an 
epidemic which has become endemic. 
Yet studies show that many foreigners are here on 
legal visitors’ permits, others are employing South 
Africans in street and formal businesses and most 
don’t want to make this country their permanent 
home. Still the myths persist. A local survey found 
that about four in five respondents thought the South 
African government is too soft on foreigners. South 
Africa’s different ethnic groups were at one in their 
belief that government should batten down the 
hatches and get tough with foreigners. 
A conundrum for government 
T his populist push is fueling government action. 
Many immigrants try to enter the country illegally 
through the vast Kruger National Park in the north. 
In the past six years, an army unit which only polices 
illegal immigrants has caught 17,000 people trying to 
enter the country. Most are from South Africa’s 
neighbouring states, although the statistics show that 
Taiwanese, Pakistani and Eastern Europeans have 
also been arrested. Existing immigration laws have 
criminalized between two and five million people 
thought to be living in the country illegally. 
South African Home Affairs Minister 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is responsible for 
migration, would like to receive a much greater slice 
of the nation’s budget for policing the borders, and is 
on record as saying that the country is at risk from 
foreigners who run criminal syndicates, prostitution 
rings and deal in contraband. But his policy papers 
have been fine tuned and written in the knowledge 
that South Africa cannot win a place in the global 
economy by adhering to the “fortress South Africa” 
school of migration policy. In fact, establishing a new 
migration policy for the country presents 
government with a conundrum: the middle path lies 
somewhere between open borders and “fortress 
South Africa” and defining that path is still very 
much a work in progress. 
The government is looking toward a special 
arrangement with the other countries in southern 
Africa and moving eventually toward open borders. 
But this is a long way off. A 1995 draft agreement 
to throw open borders was given the thumbs-down 
by government. Instead, a more cautious version 
Immigrants on the borderline 
 
The Gulf: a private contract 
hen a businessman in the Gulf wants some workers or a family wants a maid,the routine 
is always the same. One of the many specialized agencies with contacts in countries of 
emigration will organize everything in exchange for a commission. The agency will interview the 
candidates have them sign a contract whose terms have been agreed with their future employer, 
obtain all the necessary documents from the country of origin and the country they are going to, 
and make all the travel arrangements 
Since the employer has advanced the entire cost of bringing the immigrant worker to the Gulf, 
he wants to be sure of recuperating his investment.So as soon as new employees arrive, they 
usually hand over their passport to their employer. This means they can neither return home 
before the end of their contract nor legally get a job with another employer who might offer better 
pay or conditions 
This sums up the agreement between employer and immigrant worker. Its terms and how it is 
respected are a private matter and the two sides are clearly not on an equal footing. The international 
press has often reported on abuses of this dependence. 
The percentage of immigrant workers in the total population is also the highest in the world 
in the Gulf— at least 60 per cent everywhere and as much as 90 per cent in the United Arab 
Emirates The first wave of immigrants consisted mainly of other Arabs— Egyptians, Lebanese, 
Palestinians and Yemenis— who worked as civil servants, especially in the education and health 
sectors. 
With the oil boom in the 1970s, a second wave of immigrants— legal and illegal— came from Asia 
and to a lesser extent from North Africa. Much less qualified, they mostly became domestic servants 
small traders and unskilled or partly skilled workers. 
The original inhabitants of the Gulf were meanwhile gaining educational qualifications and 
pushing for jobs to go with their new status. The collapse in oil prices hit the private sector and 
government jobs very hard, and some of the region’s security services saw the situation as a 
time tomb. So the Gulf states began to fill jobs with their own citizens and to “regulate” 
immigration. 
This affected first the illegal immigrants, who had been tolerated until then.Now they were 
either given legal documents or expelled. The data on this are both fragmentary and contested. 
Official sources say 160,000 foreign workers have left the Gulf states since 1996,but observers 
put the figure as high as half a million. 
Some 24,000 officially left Oman between January and April this year. Qatar reportsa little over 
14,000 “regularizations” and nearly 4,000 repatriations over nine months. Neighbouring Saudi 
Arabia announced last July that it had deported more than 800,000 illegal immigrants since 
October 1997,most of whom had slipped into the country at the time of the annual pilgrimage 
to Mecca. [| 
In the meantime,the migrant and the train are 
still indivisible. Except that now the trains are used 
to deport illegal immigrants out of South Africa. 
They shunt the desperate and the destitute back to 
their home countries in dingy carriages, dumping 
them like unwanted surplus at the borders from 
whence they came. 
South Africa has a new refugee policy in line 
with United Nations standards; its migration 
policies for citizens from the rest of the world will 
move increasingly toward letting in only those the 
country needs. It is suffering a brain drain with the 
loss of key skills like those of doctors, dentists, 
engineers and information technology specialists. 
New policies will seek to create instead a brain gain 
by “headhunting”talent to come to South Africa. 
In the meantime, the tide of xenophobia is 
swelling. It is a violent tide but one which appears 
impotent in the face of the thousands of new 
residents (legal and illegal) who arrive here every 
day. They have turned the country into a veritable 
salad of nationalities. Together with older 
immigrant communities, they ensure that this is a

### 114150: The Italian exception

The Italian 
exception 
Italy, once a notable source of emigrants, 
has become a magnet for immigrants in 
the last 20 years 
I have a dream that 
my four little 
children will one 
day live in a nation 
where they will not 
be judged by the 
colour of their skin 
but by the content of 
their character. 
Martin Luther King 
(1929-1968,United States) 
Speech in Washington, D.C, 
1963 
| 
A few months ago Italy’s Minister of the 
I Interior, Giorgio Napolitano, told parliament 
that “Italy has a vocation as a country of 
immigration.” This is an ironic twist of history. For 
over a century Italians emigrated on a massive scale, 
but during the last twenty years the situation has 
been reversed as hundreds of thousands of people 
have come to Italy in search of a job and a new life. 
They started to arrive in the early 1980s. 
Women came from Eritrea, where a war was on, 
and Cape Verde, looking for work as domestic 
servants. Then the smiling faces of North African 
café waiters and cooks began to appear in cities like 
Rome and Milan. Egyptian workers could be 
spotted in the foundries of Emilia Romagna. In 
1986, when the Italian parliament passed for the 
first time a law protecting the rights of workers from 
outside the European Community, the number of 
these workers was put at 500,000, out of a total 
population of 57 million Italians. 
The arrival of these newcomers signaled the 
start of a new trend in a country which had, 
regional disparities notwithstanding, become 
prosperous. In the mid-1970s,the other European 
nations closed their doors to immigration, whereas 
Italy adopted no specific measures to regulate a 
phenomenon that was still new. The country also 
looked with a different eye at its informal 
“underground”economy in which family members 
sometimes employed one another, taxes were 
avoided and black market labour was often used. 
Immigrant workers—flexible and easily-exploited 
labour—found a place in that market. T hey worked 
m homes, restaurants,stores,services,construction, 
farming and, little by little, small- and medium- 
sized companies. 
Immigration became a socially recognized 
phenomenon. At the same time it stirred 
controversy and in some cases triggered xenophobic 
reactions. On the one hand, associations were set up

to defend immigrants’ rights; on the other, there 
were outbursts of racism, as in 1989 when a gang of 
young delinquents near Naples murdered an 
African farm labourer. The killing galvanized public 
opinion and the government decided to draft a new 
bill concerning immigration, the status of foreigners 
and their social rights. The bill became law in 1990 
and enabled some 200,000 foreigners to obtain 
residence permits. 
A country to which 
people come 
Italy now has around one million officially 
registered immigrant workers. A government report 
published in June 1998 put the number of 
undocumented aliens at between 200,000 and 
300,000.The immigrants hail from an increasing 
number and variety of places, including the 
Mediterranean basin, China and the Indian sub- 
continent. In decreasing order, the largest 
communities are from Morocco, the Philippines, 
Tunisia, the People’s Republic of China, Senegal, 
Sri Lanka, Poland, Romania and other East 
European countries. Recent years have seen an 
increase in the number of undocumented aliens 
from the former Yugoslavia and Albania, a direct 
consequence of war and unrest in the Balkans. The 
report also says that “some communities have 
stabilized considerably”, citing the growing number 
of children and the increasing rate of family re- 
unification. 
Italy is still adapting to its new situation as a 
country to which people come rather than leave. 
For years informal networks made up of the foreign 
communities themselves, private support groups, 
organizations and a few local authorities organized 
the reception of immigrants. Today the initiatives 
they launched are often being taken up by 
government agencies. In the field of health care, for 
example,a new figure has emerged—the “cultural

mediator”, who speaks the language and is familiar 
with the culture of the individual concerned, and 
offers his or her services as a go-between to facilitate 
access to health care. There have also been attempts 
to integrate foreign pupils through multicultural 
education.In 1996 a little over 50,000 children,or 
six per cent of the resident foreign population, were 
enrolled in Italy’s elementary and middle schools. 
School is the most effective tool for successful 
integration and the key to peaceful co-existence. 
An immigration law passed by the Italian 
parliament in March 1998 established for the first 
time a coherent legal framework governing ad mission 
to Italy and the renewal of expired residence permits. 
Extremely complicated, if not entirely inapplicable, 
laws had previously encouraged immigrants not to 
apply for papers. Anyone who has legally lived in Italy 
for five years or more is now eligible for a residence 
permit, which is valid for an unlimited length of time 
and frees its bearer from eternal “guest” status as well 
as from the trouble of renewing a permit that has 
expired. The government is requested to set annual 
admissions quotas in consultation with the regions 
and government agencies concerned. In early 1998 
the quota was set at approximately 20,000 people but 
by June the Ministry of Labour had already recorded 
34,000 requests. 
At the same time, as a member of the European 
Union’s Schengen group Italy must apply strict 
rules concerning expulsion, turning back foreigners 
at the border and fighting illegal immigration.Last 
summer around 200 clandestine immigrants who 
had paid an unscrupulous trafficker a high price 
for the trip over in a boat landed on the Sicilian 
coast, giving rise to talk about an “illegal alien 
emergency’. It was as if, at the sight of these 
bewildered travelers, baggage in hand and hearts 
full of hope,Italians had forgotten their old family

Disneyland and movie stars—this has been the 
popular conception of the names and symbols 
associated with the US’s largest state for the better 
part of this century. Yet there is another California 
which co-exists alongside this glamorous and 
popular image. Cities like Monterey Park, 
Huntington Park and areas like East Los Angeles are 
the new ports of entry for immigrants from Mexico, 
Central America, Asia and the rest of the world. This 
less glamorous aspect of California is not as well 
known. Nonetheless, the ways in which California 
adapts and adjusts to being the first home of new 
immigrants will be critical in the twenty-first century 
for the state’s future, and perhaps for the future of the 
United States. Most notably, California will give the 
country a glimpse of the future as it moves from a bi- 
racial (black/white) understanding of minority issues 
to a multi-cultural perspective that encompasses 
predominantly Latinos as well as Asian Americans 
and African Americans. 
Historically, the United States has defined 
minority group concerns in terms of a black and 
white dynamic. Yet in California the black 
community is actually the smallest of the minority 
populations. Latinos and Asians,both native-born 
and immigrant, are the largest minorities in the 
state. And this trend will continue. The Latino 
population’ in California is growing ten times as

fast as the African American community and twice 
as fast as the Asian American community. 
Consider these additional facts. California, with 
27 million inhabitants, is the USA’s most populous 
state and has the world’s seventh largest economy. It 
1s also a state with incredible ethnic diversity: in 1990 
there were over six million foreign-born immigrants 
living there. The number of Mexican immigrants 
living in Los Angeles County could make it the third 
largest Mexican metropolitan area outside of 
Mexico. Moreover, there are over half a million 
Salvadorians and Guatemalans also living in 
southern California. According to the US Census, 
there are also over two million immigrants from 
Asian countries living in the state, the largest of them, 
the Chinese and Korean, numbering over 200,000 
each. 
Kosher burritos, pupuserias 
and Chinese seafood 
These immigrants and native-born Americans 
provide a richness of cultures that are blending and 
coalescing in ways that are not yet fully clear. For 
example, you can eat “kosher burritos” in downtown 
Los Angeles and Salvadorian restaurants featuring 
“pupuserias’” co-exist alongside Chinese seafood 
eateries. Los Angeles city schools teach bilingual 
classes in Armenian as well as Spanish. In Los Angeles 
there are two Asian language and three Spanish »

initiatives that would deny schooling and other 
social services to children of undocumented 
immigrants. Most recently, the state passed an 
initiative that would eliminate bilingual education 
for immigrant children. 
The basis for these initiatives has been largely 
driven by the negative stereotypes surrounding 
immigrants from Mexico and Central America. 
According to these stereotypes, Mexican and Central 
American immigrants are predominantly illegal, do 
not fully participate in the labour force and are not 
adapting to American culture by not learning English. 
The facts present a different picture. According 
to the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
immigrants from Latin America have constituted 
over 30 per cent of the entire number of immigrants 
to the United States in the past three decades. The 
primary destination of these legal immigrants from 
Mexico and Central America has been California. 
For example, close to 50 per cent of all Mexican 
immigrants list California as their destination. 
When one looks at the percentage of immigrants 
participating in the labour force, the facts also 
contradict the stereotypes. Mexican and Central 
American immigrants have labour force 
participation (62 per cent) that equals, if not 
exceeds,that of the white non-Hispanic labour force 
and far exceeds that of native African Americans. A 
number of other facts help explain the Latino 
immigrant community in California. 
Firstly, it is a complex community. The city of 
Los Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spain. Some 
Latinos, albeit a small minority in California, can 
trace their ancestry in the United States back over 
many generations. Most of California’s Latinos are 
recent immigrants, however. Over half of the state’s 
Latino adult population is foreign-born. 
Secondly, Latino communities are composed of 
both native-born and immigrants, but outside 
observers tend to confuse the two groups. 
Specifically, outside observers look at an ethnic 
enclave like East Los Angeles and see a profusion 
of both written and spoken Spanish. Some conclude 
from their observations that Latino immigrants 
don’t want to learn English.Again,the facts show a 
different picture. The English language acquisition 
rate among Hispanic immigrants is roughly the same 
as those of other US immigrant groups. Among 
Mexican Americans born in the United States, 94 
per cent are English proficient; amongst the foreign- 
born only 51 per cent are English proficient. In fact, 
one out of every three Latino immigrants is 
monolingual in English. 
Putting down 
roots 
The explanation for this is simple. Many legal 
immigrants come to the US as children, and 
although they speak Spanish in the home, they speak 
English in school and at work. As time goes on, they 
gradually lose proficiency in their native language 
and come to rely on their acquired language. T he 
other two-thirds of the immigrants list their language 
proficiencies in the following ways: one-third were 
monolingual in Spanish and one-third were 
bilingual. By the third generation, Hispanic 
immigrants are overwhelmingly fluent in English. 
Outsiders often tend to think that Mexican and 
Central American immigrants are only interested in 
saving enough money to go back home. Once again, 
the facts dispute this popular perception. When legal 
immigrants were asked in a national survey if they 
planned to stay in the US, an overwhelming nine 
out of ten said yes; 98 per cent of Latino immigrants 
feel life 1s better in the US than it is back in their 
home country." Of course, some do return home; 
some also send back money orders to their relatives. 
But as time goes by, the roots become deeper, their 
attachments more firm. In short, they follow the 
same patterns as earlier European immigrants. 
The future of Mexican, Central American and 
other Latin Americans in California is clear. Given 
their numbers, and the larger family sizes of Latin 
immigrants, this population will continue to increase 
dramatically. One generation from now, in the year 
2020, there will be as many Californians of Latino 
descent (25 million) as there are Latinos living in 
the entire US at present. California’s future is 
inextricably linked with that of its large Latino

### 114152: The Threatened dream

The threatened dream 
Australia’s policy of migration diversity has hecome 
a political hot potato 
Zero immigration—the call of Pauline 
Hanson’s One Nation party—is threatening 
the dreams of thousands of potential settlers 
to Australia, a country that once opened its arms 
wide to people seeking a new way of life. 
The threat took shape with Hanson’s message 
that “We are in danger of being swamped by Asians”, 
delivered in her maiden speech to Australia’s Federal 
Parliament two years ago. Since then it has escalated 
to the point where the party she leads won a quarter 
of the votes in a recent state election and threatens 
the strongholds of the existing parties. 
Australia has been proud of its population 
diversity over the last 25 years since it changed its 
restrictive immigration policy (the White Australia 
policy) to one that is non-discriminatory. The 
country now draws on people from 150 countries 
as settlers. 
Subject to a yearly quota, the policy allows 
anyone from any country to apply to migrate 
regardless of their ethnic origin, sex, colour or 
religion. Whether or not an applicant is accepted as 
a settler depends on a points score that takes into 
account English language ability, skills and family 
links and support. 
Today about one in four Australians was born 
overseas. About five per cent of them were born in 
Asian countries, 6.2 per cent in the United 
Kingdom, 6.8 per cent elsewhere in Europe and 
1.2 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa. 
Since the Second World War a total of 5.6 
million people have migrated to Australia. Under 
prevailing policies migration is projected to help 
increase Australia’s population from the present 
18.5 million to 23 million in 50 years time. 
The government has responded to the One 
Nation Party with a major national campaign to sell 
its immigration policy. T he Minister for Immigration 
and Ethnic Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has travelled the 
nation making it clear there is “no place for racism in 
Australia”. The question, he says, is “not how do we 
stop migration, but how do we manage it to gain the 
best outcomes for Australia.” 
Opposition to Pauline Hanson's policies has 
been loud and vocal, and community support for 
migration diversity has come strongly from diverse 
and influential sources. A joint statement by the 
employer, labour, religious and social welfare 
groups spelt it out: “We Australians should be 
proud of the way in which migrants have 
transformed, strengthened, and enriched our nation 
economically, socially and culturally.” 
The One Nation party draws on the growing 
resentment of some Australians who see newcomers 
 - FS | CA 
taking “their” jobs in a contracting workforce in an 
economy increasingly affected by the Asian downturn, 
taking “their” places at the overcrowded universities 
and defrauding the government benefits system. 
Environmental groups and the political parties 
that represent them are also calling for reduced 
immigration. They want Australia to determine its 
“carrying capacity”’—just how many people the 
country can continue to sustain without further 
polluting its land, beaches, rivers and waterways 
and endangering its rare plants, birds and animals. 
In response to some of these criticisms the 
government has begun to tighten up the conditions 
under which migration applicants will be successful by 
allocating 50 per cent of places to skilled people, and 
by clamping down on those who overstay their visas, 
work illegally and exploit the appeal procedures to 
prolong their illegal residence or abuse the welfare 
system. 
The chairman of the Federation of Ethnic 
Affairs Council of Australia, Randolph Alwis, is 
critical of the government’s “pandering to extreme 
elements” in Australia. By accenting skills and 
English language ability, Australia is in effect 
applying indirect discrimination, he says,thereby 
excluding highly desirable migrants. Some of 
Australia’s business leaders of today arrived in 
Australia without a word of English, he points out. 
“T here are a lot of cases of highly skilled people, 
who because of systemic prejudices, are unable to 
get jobs straight away. T hey are going through a lot 
of hardships because, under government policies, 
they get no social benefits for two years,” he says. 
“Other countries are paying a lot of attention to 
our immigration policy,” he warns. “People who have 
a choice, who have the skill and knowledge will

### 114153: Immigration policy in a global economy

Immigration policy In 
Economic globalization may encourage— or even force—the states of the North 
to get together and frame enlightened multilateral immigration policies 
  
* University of Chicago 
The author has given a 
fuller treatment of the 
subject of this article in 
chapters 2, 3 and 4 of her 
book Globalization and its 
Discontents (New Press, 
New York, 1998). 
3 4 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
Immigration is increasingly seen in terms of threats. 
The prevalent image of this threat in the developed 
countries of the North is one of mass invasion by 
hundreds of millions of poor from around the world. The 
overarching response in these countries is to militarize 
their borders and to maximize policing inside them. 
Immigration thus becomes suffused in a mentality of 
national crisis, and unilateral sovereign action emerges as 
the only effective response. 
This is of course not the first time in the history of 
the twentieth century that immigration has been 
portrayed as threatening and that there has been a 
clamour for strong unilateral state action. But today 
the context has radically changed. States have been 
forced by major economic trends to approach more 
and more matters multilaterally. Unilateral strongman 
tactics in military operations are less acceptable in 
international fora and are generally seen as less effective 
than multilateral approaches. For the first time 
innovations in international law have subjected national 
states to supranational authorities. 
The context is also radically different when it comes 
to the use of policing as a key approach to more effective 
immigrant regulation. Today far more civil rights 
instruments are available to judges and there is a 
growing trend towards the constitutionalizing of civil 
rights in both the United States and in Europe. T here 
are also far more human rights instruments available 
to judges and they are much more likely to be used 
than was the case even ten years ago. 
Finally, there is a sharpening sense of the concept 
of civil society. Strategic sectors of the citizenry, 
especially in the United States, have asserted their 
right to criticize and even take to court various 
government agencies, most particularly police 
agencies. These conditions contrast sharply with the 
call for stronger police action vis a vis immigrants. 
When the object of stronger police action is a broad 
spectrum of people—immigrant women, men and 
children—sooner or later it will get caught in the 
expanding web of civil and human rights, it will violate 
those rights and interfere with the functioning of civil 
society. 
In the United States, for example, the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) can 
now excercise its police authority on individuals

merely suspected of being unauthorized immigrants. 
If my son decided to go write the great American 
novel by spending time with farm workers or in 
garment sweatshops, and there was an INS raid, he 
could well be one of the suspects, because I know 
he would not be carrying his US passport with him. 
Many of these INS actions can escape accountability 
in front of a judge if the persecuted are merely 
suspected of being undocumented. Sooner or later 
stronger policing and the weakening of judicial 
review of such police actions will interfere with the 
aspiration towards the rule of law that is such a deep 
part of our inheritance and our lived reality. Sooner 
or later, this type of police action will touch us, the 
documented. 
Defending 
the rule of law 
Acting on immigration as if it were a national crisis 
istoday both unsustainable and undesirable for states 
under the rule of law. Precarious and partial as the 
concept of the rule of law may be, and imperfect as its 
implementation is, it is nonetheless an impressive tool 
in the struggle for a better and more democratic 
society. Aspiration to it strongly conditions political 
and civic order in the highly developed countries. The 
rule of law in good part means the right of citizens to 
be free from abuses by the state and is not enhanced

only de facto, in some low-level, close-to-the-ground 
operational sense, but also de jure through the 
formalization of these changes in national and 
international law. Yet in the realm of immigration 
policy we see the continuation, and even 
strengthening, of unilateral state action, the 
invocation of absolute and undiminished state 
sovereignty. 
This raises several questions concerning the 
viability, effectiveness and desirability of such a 
framework for policy. Can such an immigration 
regime be viable when most other cross-border 
flows are increasingly centred in multilateralism 
and diminished state sovereignty? Even if it is viable 
1sit the most effective way of proceeding? Similarly 
with the expansion of a policing approach. Is it 
viable or effective in the context of a strengthening 
civil society and human rights? When it comes to 
desirability, the issues around immigration are 
probably more ambiguous than in the case of trade 
and capital flows, and become entangled in a variety 
of well-founded rationales along with ill-guided 
political passions. 
I believe that multilateralism is a better way to 
proceed in a broad range of matters, including 
immigration, because it is essential to create—and 
invent—policies that have receiving and sending 
countries working together. I also consider the

by the expanded use of policing as an instrument to 
maintain control over immigration. 
Since it is likely that cross-border migration will 
continue as the world becomes increasingly 
globalized, it is urgent that we rethink and innovate 
on the policy front. As we develop the cross-border 
integration of markets for goods and services, for 
capital, for information, and for communications, 
I would argue that the flow of people will continue 
apace. This will be especially the case among the top 
level professionals whose mobility is an essential 
part of the integration of markets,and among low- 
wage workers for whom cross-border mobility is 
often the only option. 
The powerful actors in the new economic order, 
such as global corporations and global markets 
often more powerful than many a government,are 
already hard at work setting up, albeit a mostly 
private, system of rule that protects the rights of 
these actors no matter what country they choose for 
their operations. And states, many enormously 
reluctant,have joined in the multiplying multilateral 
efforts that the new economic order demands. More 
and more of them have relinquished capacities and 
competences, and even bits and pieces of their 
sovereignty, in the name of a more effective 
multilateral economic order.T hey have done so not

expansion of policing undesirable and not the way for 
enlightened societies to proceed. Whatever the control 
achieved, the trade-offs are too costly both for the 
immigrants themselves but also especially for the 
receiving societies in terms of violations of civil and 
human rights and the threats to the fabric of civil 
society.

Regulation is necessary but achieving it does 
not necessitate militarizing borders and maximizing 
internal policing. Why? Because of a combination of 
three factors. First, far from being a mass invasion, 
immigration is patterned and bounded in time and 
space. Second, national states are acquiring greater 
competence in multilateral management because of 
economic globalization and hence may be more 
competent to develop multilateral co-operation 
mechanisms with sending countries. Third, again 
because of economic globalization national states have 
had to learn to accommodate a growing number of 
conditions and norms coming from international fora. 
This combination of factors signals the possibility of 
new approaches to regulating immigration. 
The key to a more enlightened and less crisis- 
oriented approach is the fact that migrations are 
patterned. The evidence about international 
migrations in the United States, in Western Europe 
and in Japan shows that international migrations 
are patterned,bounded in scale and duration,and 
conditioned by other processes. They are not simply 
an indiscriminate flow from poverty to prosperity as 
is suggested by the imagery of “mass invasions” .If 
poverty were enough to produce emigration,then 
the developed countries would indeed be 
threatened with massive invasions. But it is only a 
very tiny fraction of all the poor who emigrate and 
they do so from very specific areas and towards 
equally specific destinations. 
Furthermore, most migrations end. They do not 
go on for centuries. Fifty years seems to be a fairly 
lengthy duration for most cross-border migrations in 
the United States and Western Europe—that is to 
say, specific migration processes of a given nationality 
group to a particular location.Indeed, twenty years 
is probably more common in Europe. One of the 
reasons for this is that such migrations tend to be 
embedded in the cycles and phases of the receiving

areas. Dramatic examples of this include the migrations 
of hundreds of thousands of Italian and Spanish workers 
to northern Europe that were in full swing in the 1960s 
and basically ended in the 1970s. Today, when Italians 
and Spaniards are free to move within Europe, there is 
almost no new migration. That particular phase of 
labour migration, embedded as it was in the post-war 
reconstruction of Europe and then in the expansion of 
the 1960s, came to an end when these conditions no 
longer held, and Spain and Italy became prosperous. 
Ifinternational migrations are conditioned, patterned 
and bounded processes, the policy response need not be 
confined to maximizing border control. We can move 
away from a mentality of national crisis to one of 
management. This may be a good time for such a change. 
There is some consensus about the existence of a 
widening gap between immigration policy intent and 
immigration reality in the major developed receiving 
countries. An important nine-country study published in 
1994" found that the gap between the goals of national 
immigration policy (laws,regulations,executive actions, 
etc.) and the actual results is wide and growing wider in 
all major industrialized countries. It also found that 
immigration officials in all nine countries were less 
confident about the effectiveness of policy than their 
predecessors fifteen years before.

matter. Certainly the implementation of a new 
economic order required an enormous amount of 
problem solving and innovation. It is not evident to me 
that the last round of negotiations on the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the so-called 
Uruguay Round, was any less complex than 
immigration regulation. It took years of work, but it got 
done. I am convinced that we need a radical rethinking 
of key aspects of the regulation of immigration and an 
enormous amount of innovation if we are to have a 
more effective and enlightened set of immigration 
policies. Some of this work is under way in the 
European Union,which has seen considerable and at 
times radical innovations in the last ten years on the 
subject of immigration. 
Finally, there is now a so-called “concerted 
consensus” among a growing number of national 
states around the shared objective of furthering 
economic globalization and the major policy 
orientations that come with it—deregulation, 
privatization, anti-inflation policies, and foreign- 
exchange parity with the leading currencies. T hese are 
all fundamental conditions for the implementation of 
global capital markets. Along with the World Trade 
Organization and the environmental agenda, they have 
forced states to develop new competences to act 
multilaterally. They may suggest that national states 
can be led—or forced—to adopt a more international 
understanding of subjects such as immigration that 
used to be regarded in purely domestic terms. u

### 114154: Small arms, many hands

Small arms, 
many hands 
An unusual mix of groups and governments 
braves a political minefield to curb the spread 
of light weapons 
Lying in a hospital bed with chest and 
shoulder wounds, a sergeant in the 
Soviet Army began designing in 1941 
what is now the world’s most widely used 
weapon. Michael T. Kalashnikov had a 
simple objective: he wanted a sturdy gun 
that would combine the rapid rate of fire 
of a machine pistol with the greater 
accuracy of a rifle. And perhaps most 
important, he wanted a gun that could be 
mass produced to spare his compatriots the 
suffering he experienced in defending the 
homeland. Six years later, Kalashnikov’s 
brainchild arrived in the form of the AK-47. 
With 16 parts that even a child can assemble, 
the gun has such notable look alikes as the 
Israeli Galil and the Western made M-16. 
The Kalashnikov family counts about 70 
million guns, most of which are still in 
operation. 
From Yemen to Sri Lanka,the world is 
awash in small arms and light weapons 
which are generally defined as those that 
can be carried by an individual or fired by 
a small crew. Small arms range from 
revolvers to sub-machine guns while light 
weapons include small mortars,hand-held 
or mounted grenade launchers, portable 
anti-aircraft guns and portable launchers 
of anti-tank and aircraft missiles. 
500 million light weapons

Easy to conceal, these arms travel. 
Looting in Albania unleashed a wave of 
about three-quarters of a million weapons, 
the bulk of which has gone to Kosovo, 
according to Chris Smith, a light weapons 
specialist at King’s College in London. 
Along the Namibia-Angola border, he has 
found an unusual group of gun traffickers,

chain of buyers reaching South Africa’s 
Western Cape where the guns can be bought 
for as little as $20, down from the several 
hundreds they cost about four years ago. 
Meanwhile, Russia is “haemorrhaging” with 
weapons flowing throughout Europe. 
Further east, theTamil Tigers have their own 
shipping fleet to assure supply from Burma 
and transit ports like Singapore, says Smith. 
And Kashmir and Karachi are reeling, he 
says, from the effects of the Afghan 
“pipeline” set up in the 1980s by the CIA to 
pump guns, missiles and ammunition to 
mujahideen battling the Soviet army. 
An estimated 500 million light weapons 
are now in circulation world-wide. And 
another injection is likely, as states joining 
Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) 
are obligated to buy advanced weapons 
systems to meet the organization’s military 
standards. Many are expected to pay for 
these purchases by selling off their old 
systems which include light weapons. 
Light weapons have been largely 
ignored during disarmament talks. While

treaties concerning nuclear, chemical and 
conventional weapons,they have not even 
agreed on international standards for 
classifying or registering small arms and 
light weapons, let alone a UN convention 
concerning their transfer. And yet, they are 
the primary or sole tools of violence in 
virtually all the armed conflicts currently 
dealt with by the United Nations, 
according to Jayantha Dhanapala, UN 
Under Secretary General for 
Disarmament. Over 90 per cent of the 
victims of small arms are civilians, with 
women and children accounting for 80 per 
cent of casualties. 
However, the political tides may be 
changing. An international campaign is 
now underway with non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) of all stripes and 
colours—disarmament and gun control 
groups along with development and human 
rights associations in the North and 
South—>building common ground with the 
active support of governments like Mali, 
Canada, Norway and Japan. Buoyed by 
success in banning landmines, they are 
setting their sights on small arms and light 
weapons, despite the major differences 
between them. The networks for producing 
and procuring light weapons are far more 
diverse and widespread than that for 
ETHICS 
the fact that these weapons don’t have the 
same dollar value as the big ticket items like 
jets and tanks. Light weapons initiatives 
take attention away from the big weapons 
industry.” O’Callaghan also points to the 
links between guns, drugs and organized 
crime, which rank high on domestic 
agendas. By focusing on efforts to curb this 
illicit trade, governments can score points 
with voters. 
Estimates of the black market are 
sketchy at best. International trade in small 
arms reportedly runs at between three and 
five billion dollars a year. According to a 
UN study, the black market amounts to 
about 40 per cent of the legal trade, 
although some experts maintain that it 
could equal or surpass it.And even less is 
known about the “grey market” of covert 
sales between governments and to non- 
state actors. 
The National Rifle Association’s 
political clout 
Despite the lack of data, the past year 
has seen a wave of initiatives to curb the 
illicit trade. The Organization of American 
States (OAS) brokered a convention 
outlining practical measures to notably 
strengthen import/export controls and 
increase information exchange between 
‘Focusing on the illicit arms trade does not address 
the problem of arms manufactured legally which go 
through several chains of supply before entering the black 
or grey market’ 
landmines. Small arms, unlike the mines, 
are also culturally embedded in many 
societies. Uprooting the myriad of gun 
cultures will take far more than a 
convention regulating their manufacture, 
use or export. 
But before dismissing the campaign as 
just another liberal wave of good intentions, 
there seems to be growing interest on the 
part of some major political powers which 
just happen to be major arms suppliers. 
While developing countries have borne the 
brunt of the casualties, European and 
North American countries are now 
increasingly concerned as these weapons 
fuel the fires of ethnic and intra-state 
conflicts raging in their backyards, 
particularly in the Balkans. 
“We are suddenly finding the doors 
widening from all kinds of governments,” 
says Geraldine O’Callaghan of the British 
American Security Information Council 
(BASIC), an independent research 
organization. “The interest is also linked to 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
states. In short, states agreed that guns 
would be marked with the time and place of 
manufacture along with the name of the 
importer should they cross a border. 
Mexico turned the screws on the United 
States government, for whom anything 
resembling gun control is taboo given the 
political weight of the National Rifle 
Association (NRA), aUN accredited NGO 
which ferociously defends the individual’s 
right to bear weapons. The Mexicans 
maintained that it was impossible to stop 
drugs streaming north so long as US guns 
inundated states south of the border. 
Looking to the OAS convention as a 
model, the UN Economic and Social 
Council is now working to incorporate 
similar measures in the form of a “Firearms 
Protocol” which would fall within the 
Transnational Organized Crime 
Convention. The proposed protocol won 
the official support of the G-8 (Group of 
Eight Industrialized States) during a 
meeting in April 1998. And just a month

later, foreign ministers of the European 
Union signed an ethical code of conduct 
essentially calling on states to refrain from 
transferring weapons to conflict zones or 
states likely to use them to commit serious 
human rights abuses. While a step forward, 
there are serious loopholes, notably in the 
lack of provisions for parliamentary or 
public scrutiny over arms exports. 
With the possible exception of the EU 
code, these initiatives represent a law 
enforcement approach, the success of 
which depends on governments adopting 
and enforcing strict legal controls on 
weapons licenses. For some experts, it 
marks an important shift away from the 
traditional view in which guns are seen as a 
commodity to be traded like any other 
which exonerates the suppliers from 
responsibility over their end use. 
“The focus on the illicit trade is 
basically an uncontroversial way of getting 
into the debate surrounding light 
weapons,” says Elizabeth Clegg of 
Saferworld, an NGO. “While states like the 
United States have traditionally blocked 
any moves to restrict the production and 
sale of light weapons because there could 
be domestic implications,they could have 
little to say on attempts to curb illicit 
transactions. 
“However, this approach does not 
address the problem of all the arms 
manufactured legally but which have gone 
through several chains of supply and are 
now in the grey and black market,” says 
Clegg. 
“It’s dangerous,” says Joost Hiltermann 
of Human Rights Watch,an NGO. “It lets 
governments off the hook by not holding 
them responsible for covert trade in the 
grey market. If governments have an 
interest in selling weapons, they will do so 
legally when they can and illegally if they

must. You cannot get rid of the illegal trade 
without monitoring the legal trade. And to 
do that, you need to focus on government 
policy,” says Hiltermann, who points to 
such classic tactics by which governments 
sell to second parties which then transfer 
the weapons to a third state, possibly in 
defiance of a UN embargo, or to a non- 
state actor. 
Distinguishing between the legal and 
illegal trade has proven to be a political 
minefield. Alarms began ringing in August 
when Canada’s Foreign Minister Lloyd 
Axworthy, a key player in the campaign 
after his involvement in brokering the ban 
on landmines, began asking foreign 
ministers to consider a global convention to 
prohibit the transfer of military- 
specification small arms and light weapons 
to non-state actors. According to a 
discussion paper by the Canadian foreign 
ministry, “these non-state actors are 
variously termed: terrorists, gangsters, 
bandits, warlords, hooligans and 
narcotraffickers.” While recognizing that 
the proposed convention “would deny arms 
to non-state actors opposing repressive 
regimes,” the ministry maintains “that non- 
violent means are the best way to effect 
political change.” 
Arms to defend 
human rights 
“This is a very controversial issue, 
especially in the South,” says Alejandro 
Bendaiia of the Center for International 
Studies in Managua, Nicaragua. “This 
proposal would have banned giving 
weapons to the African National Congress 
during apartheid or to any other liberation 
movement.” 
Mr Axworthy seems to have taken a 
step back from his proposal. During a 
September meeting at the UN on the subject, 
he highlighted the links between the legal and 
illegal trade in supporting the idea of a UN 
conference on the subject, possibly in the year 
2000. 
Confusion of the issues is expected given 
the complicated nature of the subject and the 
diversity of the actors involved. In private 
conversations, law enforcement officials 
express concern, for example, in dealings with 
some disarmament and gun-control groups. 
By openly calling for changes to domestic gun 
laws, these groups may be offering the NRA 
the political ammunition needed to drag the 
US administration away from the negotiating 
table. As NRA spokesperson Tom Mason 
explains, “we are like an 800-pound gorilla 
sitting on the US administration.” 
Other experts are concerned that in trying 
to convince the public, particularly in the 
North, that disarmament is possible, there 
will be a hasty rush to set up gun buy-back 
projects and strategies concerning gun 
tagging, for example, without the technical 
expertise required. And given the politics 
involved, mistakes can prove costly—which 
raises the question of the campaign’s finances. 
“The funds should not be diverted from 
development budgets,” says Bendafa, “nor 
should they be diluted by going towards 
television commercials in the North and 
professional lobbying. Countries just coming 
out of conflicts need demilitarizing—not just 
taking away mines but depolarizing divisions 
within society. This is very delicate. . . . We 
shouldn’t build up expectations about the 
possible political success of this campaign. 
Conventions won’t eliminate the demand for 
guns or the roots of violence because the 
economic violence will continue. . .. This is 
just one step in a long process.” |

Asia’s booming 
sex business 
he sex industry is assuming massive 
Torin in Southeast Asia. The findings 
of a study carried out by the International 
Labour Organisation (ILO) in four countries of 
the region (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia 
and Thailand) 
prostitution is generating millions of dollars, 
speak for themselves: 
currently amounting to between 2 per cent and 
14 per cent of gross national product (GNP). 
The ILO study, entitled The Sex Sector: The 
economic and social bases of prostitution in 
Southeast Asia, states that “ although the exact 
number of working prostitutes in these 
countriesisimpossible to calculate due to the 
illegal or clandestine nature of the work, 
anywhere between 0.25 per cent and 1.5 per 
cent of the total female population are 
engaged in prostitution” .Even more serious, 
the industry also includes thousands of 
children, who are forced to prostitute 
themselves and are victims of threats or 
violence, “which always leave them with a 
series of after-effects”. 
In 1993, an estimate for Thailand spoke 
of between 30,000 and 50,000 child 
prostitutes while, in the case of the Philippines, 
the ILO states that “a 1997 report put the 
number of child victims of prostitution at 
75,000”. It stresses that “International 
conventions all treat child prostitution as an 
unacceptable form of child labour:the goal is 
its total elimination” — and, at the same time, 
also the elimination of adult prostitution. 
In practical terms, responsible travellers 
can contribute to a campaign known as“ End 
Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism” (ECPAT) 
which is being conducted by a number of non- 
governmental organizations by reporting to 
the police on any suspicious activities at the 
places they visit and in their own countries 
when they return home nu

### 114155: Africa's video alternative

Africa’s video 
Movie-makers in English-speaking Africa who cannot afford 
to produce classic celluloid films are winning popular acclaim 
with low-cost video productions 
In the Third World and among urban 
ghetto dwellers in advanced countries, 
some technological inventions are used 
in ways that were never imagined or 
intended by their originators. They open 
up new areas of endeavour that can be 
independently ~~ pursued by the 
underprivileged. To take one example,the 
availability of low-cost samplers and four- 
track sound recording equipment has 
triggered a formidable explosion of ghetto- 
based rap music in the United States by 
making it possible for relatively 
unsophisticated young people with very 
little money to record high-quality music 
tracks in their own homes. 
In the same vein, the emergence and 
proliferation of inexpensive VHS video tape 
recorders have led to the growth of video- 
based movie production in several African 
countries, especially Nigeria and Ghana.To 
understand the importance of this

phenomenon, it must be borne in mind that 
film production in most African countries 
originated primarily as a result of external 
assistance, rather than truly indigenous 
efforts. It was essentially because of the 
availability of technical and financial 
assistance from the French Co-operation 
Ministry that countries of francophone 
Africa such as Senegal and Burkina Faso 
made considerable progress in film 
production. 
Prohibitive 
production costs 
In the English-speaking countries, on the 
other hand, where assistance of this kind was 
not readily available, film production 
generally lagged behind in the absence of 
meaningful cultural policies designed to 
support indigenous film-makers. Non- 
subsidized film production was possible for 
a time in the 1970s and 1980s because the 
  
  
economy was buoyant enough to recoup the 
high costs of using rented equipment from 
overseas and paying for processing and 
printing in European laboratories. 
In the late 1980s, the local economy 
virtually collapsed, robbing the middle 
classes and the population at large of the 
means to pay consistently for leisure 
entertainment. T he cost of film production 
became prohibitive .E v n a low-budget film 
costing only $50,000 could not pay for itself 
on the local market. As a result no one 
ventured into film production. Hence the 
drought of Nigerian-made films, a 
seemingly incomprehensible paradox in 
view of the growing number of films made 
in relatively small and economically less 
well endowed countries of francophone 
Africa. 
Another major obstacle to film 
production in most African countries has 
been that there are no true television

### 114155: Africa's video alternative

There can be no doubt that video movie production in 
countries like Nigeria and Ghana represents an African 
response to the existence of today’s information jungle 
the tune. 
The content and style of foreign-assisted 
films are often dictated by Western movie 
critics or civil servants in the French Co- 
operation Ministry. The success of the films 
depends on the reception they receive in 
festivals and art house circuits in Europe, 
rather than on their popularity with African 
audiences. T he contents and style of video 
movies, on the other hand, are necessarily 
dependent on mass audience tastes in Africa 
and are totally unsuitable for film festivals 
and art house audiences. Hopefully, 
however, there will be a meeting point some 
day between the need for quality and depth 
and the quest for mass market appeal. 
With the growing development of 
digital television technology and the 
concomitant fall in costs, it will soon be 
possible for African video products to be 
remastered on 16 mm or 35 mm without 
great loss of quality and so become 
available for cinema distribution. Meanwhile, 
the availability of video projectors is beginning 
to make possible a new type of distribution in 
relatively small viewing centres. These movies 
are also remarkably popular with Nigerians 
and Ghanaians in Europe and the United 
States, suggesting that in the not-too-distant 
future a market might emerge for distribution 
by cable or satellite to these expatriate 
communities. 
There can be no doubt that video movie 
production in countries like Nigeria and 
Ghana represents an African response 
to today’s information jungle. It is the response 
of people who have chosen to car ve out their 
own path,rather than wait for the ambiguous 
benefits of travelling along glistening 
information highways in a manner scripted by 
the powerful forces that currently dominate 
the world political and economic scene. nu

Attempts to describe today’s global 
A communications landscape often 
include glib references to information 
highways along which all humanity is 
supposed to travel, following in the 
footprints of the technologically advanced 
nations. Time and again we are told that 
the future lies in advanced technology per 
se, and not in the content of the products of 
communication. 
According to this viewpoint, everyone 
should hook up to the Internet without 
delay and be inundated with messages 
emanating from web sites in the world’s 
major nations. It is also thought unseemly 
for a country to try to protect its airspace 
from being bombarded by satellite 
television broadcasts from powerful 
transnational commercial conglomerates 
and state-funded television concerns in 
parts of the world that share the same basic 
cultural, political and economic outlook. 
Some African governments have been 
unwise enough to sign agreements allowing 
foreign state-funded radios to broadcast on 
FM in their countries, thus unwittingly 
creating unfair competition for their own 
local radio stations. Similarly, most Third 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
World television stations believe they are making 
good use of the information highway by accepting 
virtually free satellite news coverage transmitted 
worldwide by powerful overseas broadcasters. 
Since they do not own satellites themselves and 
often lack the financial means to send television 
crews to cover events even in neighbouring 
countries, the executives of these television 
stations are often only too willing to overlook the 
political and cultural implications of continuously 
relying on overseas sources. It may well be that 
by agreeing to travel along the information 
highway in a manner scripted in advance by 
others, T hird World decision-makers are exposing 
the citizens of their countries to a new and 
insidious form of colonization. From this 
perspective, gifts of free television programmes 
have a heavy cost. 
The key to Third World participation in the 
so-called information highway lies in making 
imaginative use of new forms of technology that 
fall within their reach for the express goal of 
serving their interests and needs. Against this 
background, the rapid growth of indigenous 
movie production on video tape over the past 
few years in a number of African countries may 
be a step in the right direction. O0.Bm 
  
Romance 
African style 
‘A nd then they got married and lived 
happily ever after and were blessed 
with lots of children. ...” What could be 
more universal than the denouement of 
romantic novels, tales of love and luxury, 
passionate affairs between tough guys and 
tender women leading up to the inevitable 
happy ending. 
One need only browse through the 
book section of any supermarket in the 
Western world to get an idea of the fictional 
settings favoured by successful exponents 
of this kind of literature such as Barbara 
Cartland and the Spanish writer Corin 
Tellado: tropical paradises, Alpine ski resorts, 
Loire valley chateaux, mansionsin European 
principalities and beaches in California. 
But in Adores, a series of novels with 
an African background which has recently 
been launched by the Cote d'Ivoire 
publishing house Nouvelles Editions 
Ivoiriennes (NEI), the characters eat manioc 
or fried banana instead of caviar, drink 
ginger juice instead of champagne, and 
instead of waltzing throw themselves into 
the mapouka, a dance that is all the rage in 
Abidjan. 
Series editor Méliane Boguifo, who is 
also an official with the Cote d'Ivoire 
ministry of education, explains that “the 
idea came from the observation that the 
women of our country and African women 
in general adore love stories from the West 
and are as partial to them in book form as 
in the cinema.We are now giving them an 
opportunity to recognize themselves in an 
African setting.” 
Six books have been published so far, 
including such evocative titles as Coeurs 
piégés (“ Trapped Hearts”), Cache-cache 
d'amour (“ Hide-and-Seek Love”) and Un 
bonheur  inattendu (“Unexpected 
Happiness”). As a result of several book- 
signing sessions and a promotional 
campaign on television and radio and in 
the press, 36,000 copies were sold in two 
months in Cote d'Ivoire and neighbouring 
countries like Senegal and Benin. Published 
in French, the novels in the Adores series 
cost 1,500 CFA francs ($2.5) at newsstands 
and in bookshops. Their authors are well- 
known writers who prefer to use 
pseudonyms, or law and literature students 
such as Guet Lydie and Koné Fibla. If the 
example catches on in Asia,Latin America 
and elsewhere, Barbara Cartland will have 
to look to her laurels. u

### 114157: Crossed wires in global telecoms

Crossed wires ..... 
In global telecoms 
Deregulation of the telecommunications market may inflict crippling costs on 
some of the world’s poorest countries 
If you have a friend in Sydney, 
Johannesburg or Beijing and you haven't 
spoken to them for a while, you will soon 
have to think of a better excuse than “it costs 
too much”. Prices of international telephone 
calls are plummeting. Before long, making a 
call to the other side of the planet will cost as 
much as it currently costs to call your 
neighbour. 
We are moving towards a distanceless, 
A repair crew at work in Mexico City. 
Fear tlle - oe ait ae re, me 
borderless world where you will be able to 
call anyone, almost anywhere for a few cents 
or pennies. “The death of distance as a 
determinant of the cost of communicating 
will probably be the single most important 
force shaping society in the first half of the 
next century,” argues The Economist 
magazine. 
There is a problem, though. Amidst the 
excitement and glamour generated by the 
  
prospects of cheap calls, mobile phones and 
the Internet, a quiet, poorly understood but 
increasingly desperate struggle is being waged 
by some countries to adapt to the new 
realities. The process of change threatens to 
cripple the economies of these countries, 
mainly the poorest on the planet. Their 
problem is made worse by the fact that this 
issue is mired in the tedious technicalities of 
how telephone calls are charged and 
accounted for. 
When poverty 
pays dividends 
One reason why international calls have 
been so expensive is that many countries 
have traditionally charged high prices for 
completing the calls. Make a call from 
Washington to Jamaica, for example, and 
the American telephone company has to 
pay the telephone company in Jamaica to 
connect the call,and that cost is passed on 
to the person making the call. The system 
which defines how much each company 
pays each other company is known as the 
international accounting rate system. It is 
the result of bilateral agreements which 
determine the price of the connexion and 
the amount (usually 50 per cent of this 
price) that a telephone company in country 
X pays to its opposite number in countryY 
for connecting the call (the settlement rate). 
In an ideal world, every country would 
originate as many telephone calls as it 
receives. However, we live in an unequal 
world and because most of their citizens are 
poorer and have less developed telephone 
systems, nearly all developing countries 
receive more calls than they originate. 
Perhaps uniquely, in this instance poverty 
pays. Most developing countries receive 
much more money from international 
telephone traffic than they pay out. 
In 1996, developing countries as a whole

netted around $10 billion in foreign 
exchange through this system. For some 
least developed countries, revenue from 
international calls is their biggest “export” 
industry and their largest source of foreign 
exchange. “To put that into perspective,” 
says Pekka Tarjanne, Director-General of the 
International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU), the United Nations body responsible 
for telecommunications, “if you add together 
all the lending programmes in 
telecommunications of all the development 
banks around the world, the total sum they 
invested during the first half of the 1990s 
would still amount to less than is generated 
in just one year [by the developing countries] 
The least developed 
countries and other 
low-income small 
economies with, say, less 
than one million 
inhabitants, are likely 
to be hardest hit 
under the accounting rate system.” 
Many developing countries have used the 
system to charge high prices for completing 
calls, arguing that they need the foreign 
exchange to develop their own domestic 
telephone systems. But now a combination of 
technology, power politics and the harsh 
competitive disciplines ushered in by the 
global liberalized telecommunications 
market place is likely to lead to a sudden and 
potentially catastrophic fall in these revenues, 
with unknown consequences for some 
developing economies and possibly for some 
richer countries as well. 
“If we don’t succeed in reaching an 
agreement [on international accounting 
rates], in the next few years we will see 
chaos and anarchy in telecommunications 
and many people in the developing 
countries will suffer tremendously,” argues 
Pekka Tarjanne.“And so will customers in 
the developed world.” 
But the poorest countries are likely to 
suffer most. “The least developed countries 
and other low-income small economies with, 
say, less than one million inhabitants, are 
likely to be hardest hit,” by reform of the 
system according to the International 
Telecommunication Union. Jamaica, for 
example earns around $150 million a year 
from international telephone calls. 
“Reduction in . . . rates will reduce this 
inflow, affecting the country’s foreign 
exchange and balance of trade,” says Cezley 
Sampson of the Mona Institute of Business 
4 4 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
  
CONNEXIONS 
Studies at the University of the West Indies. 
It will also lead to a worse telephone service 
in the country, according to Jamaican 
Ambassador Anthony Hill. “Too rapid a 
reduction in settlement rates will lead to 
substantial increases in local telephone 
charges leading to significant service 
disconnections,” he says. 
Why is the system falling apart? A major 
reason is technology. The technical costs of 
international telecommunications are 
plummeting. A single pair of optical fibres, 
each the thickness of a human hair, can 
now carry all of North America’s long 
distance communications traffic. The 
capacity of networks built with these fibres 
1s ten times that of networks built just a few 
years ago. That means much lower 
operating costs for companies—and thus 
the opportunity to charge much lower 
prices. 
Technological costs have fallen so 
much, according to the ITU, that “the cost 
of an international link is effectively close to 
zero, [and] it could almost be dismissed as 
having no bearing on the cost of an 
international call.” But while the cost of 
calls placed through satellites or undersea 
cables has been falling by as much as 30 
per cent per year since the early 1990s, 
according to the ITU, international 
accounting rates have been falling by only 9 
per cent. 
Technology is not the only factor, 
however. Most people complain that 
international telephone calls still cost too 
much—but international conglomerates and 
multinationals don’t just complain, they 
demand. Telecommunications is at the heart 
of the modern global economy with trillions

behind the increasing liberalization of 
telecommunications—and with it intense

Opening markets

In February this year, 72 countries, which 
between them control 93 per cent of global 
telecommunications traffic, began to 
implement a World Trade Organization 
agreement to open up their 
telecommunications markets to foreign 
competition. This has led to an orgy of 
mergers between giant telecommunications 
companies. With countries now opening their

impossible for developing countries to 
continue to charge the prices they want. 
One country, however, has decided that 
it can wait no longer for reform. The United 
States is the big loser under the old 
system—its companies run a deficit of 
almost $6 billion a year in accounting rate 
payments. The US has thus decided to 
introduce its own pricing system which will 
only allow US companies to pay companies 
in other countries very reduced prices to 
complete international calls. “[The existing 
system] is an ancient, outmoded, pro- 
monopoly system of settlement payments 
between countries that has propped up 
overly high charges to consumers for 
international calls and led to a huge outflow 
of money from the US to foreign 
companies,” said Reed Hundt, the then 
chairman of the US government’s Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) 
when he announced the move in 1996. 
Although the FCC system, which comes 
into force next year, allows the poorest 
countries up to five years before they have 
to pay the new prices, the US move has 
infuriated many countries. 
“The settlement rate in Colombia is 
around 50 cents per minute—more than 
twice that of rates proposed by the FCC,” 
argues David Townsend, a consultant who 
CONNEXIONS 
has made a special study for the ITU on the 
impact of accounting rate reductions on 
Colombia. “Accounting rates set at the FCC 
benchmarks would have very severe negative 
impact on the Colombian telecommunications 
sector—in fact Colombian operators would lose 
money on every call,” he says. The FCC disagrees 
with his analysis. 
Some have even accused the US ofa new form 
of colonialism in its accounting rate policy. 
“Historically, the US has refused to be regulated 
by the ITU and when not able to get its own way 
within the ITU has resorted to internationalizing 
its own domestic law,” says Professor Jill Hills of 
the International Institute of Telecoms Regulators 
in London. “The FCC's threat to withdraw from 
the ITU’s system of accounting rates follows this 
tradition,” she argues. 
However, it is widely accepted that the 
current system needs radical reform. In 1992, 
for example, the ITU adopted a resolution 
calling for settlement payments to reflect the real 
costs of completing calls. 
The technological and economic changes 
sweeping the telecommunications industry offer 
huge new opportunities for many developing 
countries to “leapfrog” the older industrial powers. 
Instead of having to invest billions in digging 
trenches to bury cables, as the industrial powers 
have done, liberalization can potentially help 
mobilize massive foreign investment to create 
nation-wide, state of the art, digital networks based 
on mobile telecommunications and optic fibres. 
The bottom line, though,is that at a critical 
moment in their economic development, some 
of the world’s poorest countries find themselves 
with a huge economic handicap in the 
telecommunications race. If nothing is done to 
help them, this handicap could last for a 
generation. nu

Between 1993 and 1997, sales of

countries of the European Union, according 
to the World Newspaper Association 
(WNA). A report presented at the 
association’s 51st congressin Kobe (Japan) 
last June said daily circulation in the United 
States dropped by 5.2%.In Russia,which 
had the highest newspaper circulation in 
the world— 96 million copies a day at the 
end of the communist era— sales of dailies 
have fallen by 54.4% since 1993. 
The decline in these countries contrasts 
with the vitality of daily newspapers in some 
Southern despite 
censorship, economic crisis and problems 
of getting raw materials, sales have risen 
over the same five-year period. Sales in 
India have gone up by 47.2% and in Brazil 
by 9%. 
Other sources confirm the trend. The 
latest UNESCO figures show that the 
penetration of the daily press has increased 
in almost every African country in this 
period. In Algeria, the number of daily 
papers available per 1,000 inhabitants rose 
from 115 to 122 copies, in Nigeria from 
1,700 to 1,950,in Cote d'Ivoire from 90 to 
128 and in Ghana from 200 to 310. 
Various surveys, including one by the 
American firm Market Facts, attribute the 
drop in sales to the growth of the Internet, 
but its direct impact has not yet been 
demonstrated. The WNA says, for example, 
that in the United Kingdom,the Internet is 
more an extra than a replacement for the 
written press. The same goes for the United 
States, where regular readers of on-line 
news also consult other sources, such as 
newspapers, radio and television, to 
supplement their information. 
The main concern of editors right now 
is how to attract young readers, who are 
more drawn to a mouse and a screen than 
to the printed word. nu

You were born in India, studied in the

Where is home? 
I left India when I was eighteen years 
old and then divided my time between the 
United States and India for about ten years 
before meeting my husband in Kampala, 
Uganda, during the shooting of M ississippi

husband and child are. 
Why did you decide to go into cinema? 
Your films seem fired by a strong sense of 
social justice. 
I was not one of those people who knew 
they would be making films from the age of 
eight. I fell into cinema, and then became 
possessed by it. I started as an actor, 
committed to fairly radical experimental 
theatre, street protest theatre and related 
things. I was also a good student, and 
suffered under the illusion I might have 
become an academic. I received a full 
scholarship to study at Harvard University 
when I was eighteen and went to pursue 
my interest in theatre. But once there, I felt

with the lack of control one has an actor. 
Actors are always at the mercy of directors 
and their vision of the world. I wanted to be 
the one in control—telling the story, 
controling the light, the gesture and the 
frame. Creative freedom is imperative for 
me.

Mira Nair: 
One of India’s most celebrated and controversial 
film-makers is driven by an obsession with creative 
freedom 
script, finding finance, casting, shooting 
and editing. Then comes the big struggle 
to make sure the film is distributed 
throughout the world. All of this could 
easily take one or two years. In order to live 
with a project every day for two years I have 
to be obsessed by it.I can only make films 
about subjects that get under my skin and 
make my heart beat faster. I am not in the 
business of producing films which offer a 
pleasant way of filling a Sunday afternoon. 
That is for others to do, and I don’t dismiss 
it. But I am attracted to ideas that will 
provoke people and make them look at the 
world a little differently—stories that come 
from my part of the world. 
I do have a private agenda, I suppose, to 
resist the cultural imperialism of 
Hollywood by putting people like ourselves 
on screen. It is an enormous validation to 
see people on screen who look like us in 
India or elsewhere in the South. We must 
tell our own stories, because nobody else 
1s going to do it for us. I must say I enjoy the 
responsibility of exploring and portraying 
these stories through film-making. After all, 
film, unlike academia, reaches millions. 
This is another dimension of my work 
which I really enjoy—the ability to reach 
so many people. Yet at the same time, I 
don’t forget or underestimate the individual 
viewer in the audience. 
Why focus on communities and individuals 
living in exile and what have you learned 
about cultural identity and racism? Why do 
Indian communities in exile, for example, 
feel the need to keep to the fringes of 
society? 
I seem to be getting some sort of 
reputation for making films about exile. I 
didn’t choose this, it chose me. Distance 
from a community is something which used 
to confuse me but now I use it as a tool for 
my films. 
I suppose I understand that state of 
being, and know what it feels like to look 
outside a motel window in Mississippi and 
see my garden in Kampala. You can find 
yourself on the other side of the world and 
yet still find a reminder or link to home. Yet 
I don’t suffer from nostalgia or 
homesickness. I think of myself as someone 
with a huge appetite for the world and as a 
great lover of people. I find this great 
commonality between people. Yet ignorance 
and fear—the two hallmarks of racism— 
blind us to it. 
What was especially moving about 
being in Mississippi to shoot my film was 
that I found black families—with their 
closeness and church and singing and 
barbecues—were actually so much like the 
Indian families that seemed so removed 
from that community even though they 
lived just across the highway. The Indian 
community was doing the same things, 
believing in similar values to those of the 
black community. Yet the Indians imagined 
the blacks to be not quite as human or the 
same as them. 
Indian communities living abroad form 
their own circle, perhaps to maintain a 
certain cultural and sometimes religious 
purity. In the process, they become more 
frozen in their “Indianness” than those 
living in India. By doing so, they also 
systematically exclude themselves from 
integration with the local communities. 
When I went to Kampala to make 
Mississippi Masala, some Indians were 
surprised to see that I am not as “Indian” as 
they expected. 
Your films explore paradoxes by 
showing how, for example, the slave 
becomes the master. Where does this 
insight come from? Do you draw on your 
observation skills as a documentary 
film-maker or on your intuition? 
I have an eye and ear for paradox.T hat 
is life. T he grey area where no one person is 
less or more virtuous than the other. For 
me the truth is far more interesting, far 
more strange,than fiction. 
This is where cultural specificity comes 
in. You do extensive research about a 
theme, feel it and then create a story that

could become universal. Tyranny is the 
absence of complexity, as Gide said. And 
complexity is interesting to explore in film 
instead of constantly looking for the lowest 
common denominator. I believe in 
intuition. I follow my intuition absolutely in 
finding and developing stories to tell. For 
me, there are subjects which just seem 
The censorship problems 
aside, | do believe that 
women film-makers have 
access to some people and 
subjects which men do not 
 
obvious to explore. For example, I once 
made a documentary called Children of 
Desired Sex, an Indian euphemism for 
people wanting only male children, the 
desired sex. The documentary set out to 
explore how amniocentesis,the procedure 
invented to test the genetic balance of a 
child, was being abused in a horrific 
manner in India as a test for women to 
ascertain the sex of their unborn child. If 
the foetus was female,they would abort. 
But finding a subject is not enough. The 
trick is to create a work situation in which 
intuition is allowed to reign. 
Many people who spend years abroad 
benefit from a certain distance when 
returning to their countries of origin. 
They are able to critically observe their 
native societies, without necessarily 
passing judgment. Perhaps this distance 
helps to explain the clarity in films like 
Salaam Bombay! Yet it may also bring you 
opposition. How do you respond to 
accusations that you are trying to sell 
India’s poverty? 
I choose subjects which touch me. I am 
not the first one to be accused of selling 
India’s poverty. The government accused 
even the renowned film-maker Satyajit Ray 
of the same thing. After seeing Salaam 
Bombay! 1 don’t think anybody can say that 
it 1s a film that gratuitously shows the 
depression and misery in India. The movie 
celebrates the survival of the human being in 
the face of all the odds. In day to day life, an 
individual does not notice such things. Also, 
many of us in our lives—instead of coping 
with the inequities of existence here— 
become blind and numb. Yet looking away 
Mississippi Masala: an Indian family migrates to the United States. 
 
from reality does not make it disappear. 
The same thing happened with Kama 
Sutra. 1didn’t hide sexuality behind veils or 
dances. Indian commercial films are always 
filled with sexual innuendoes and obscene 
songs about “what is under the blouse”. In 
fact, sexuality in Indian cinema is cloaked 
in rape and violence. In my film, I wasn’t 
trying to shock but tell the story straight, 
without hiding behind illusions or pretence. 
The irony is that we come from a culture 
which had regarded love and sexuality as a 
link to the divine. It was an art to be learned 
and yet to be treated as a matter of fact. 
Do you think Kama Sutra generated 
even more controversy because 
it was made by a woman? What 
possibilities or pitfalls face a female 
film-maker? 
Films portraying sexual subjects are 
bound to attract problems with the censors. 
But you cannot imagine the troubles that lie 
in wait if a woman director attempts to 
focus on them. Before making the film, 
everyone told me that I would have 
problems but I never imagined that I would 
be dragged through the courts for almost 
two years! After going through all kinds of 
legal battles with the Indian censorship 
board and government, I knew that the 
attacks were particularly vehement because 
I am a woman. 
The censorship problems aside, I do 
believe that women film-makers have 
access to some people and subjects which 
men do not. For example while making my 
film India Cabaret which dealt with the lives 
of female stripteasers in Bombay, I could 
enter their lives in a rather comprehensive 
way. | even managed to visit the houses of 
the men who frequented these cabaret 
joints and talk to their wives. 
Kama Sutra felt like an experiment. Was it 
an attempt to shift from being a 
documentary film-maker to being an art 
film-maker?

civil servant, Nair was born in 1957 in the 
city of Bhubaneshwar in eastern India. 
Although watching movies at the local 
cinema was one of her early interests she was 
particularly captivated by theatre, which she 
studied (along with sociology) at the 
University of Delhi. In Delhi she became 
involved in political street theatre and 
performed for three years in an amateur 
drama company before setting out for the 
United States on a fellowship in 1976 to 
study drama. 
Disillusioned with the conservative 
theatre programme at Harvard University, 
she was soon drawn to documentary film- 
making. Her decision gave her the 
opportunity to work with three leading 
film-makers, Alfred Guzzeti, Richard 
4 8 The Unesco Courier - November 1998 
Leacock and D.A.Pennebaker. Seven years 
after graduating she had made four 
documentaries exploring “the culture and 
traditions of India and their impact on the 
lives of ordinary people.” 
Greatest recognition came with Salaam 
Bombay! a film which, she says, “portrayed 
the reality of children who are denied a 
childhood, children who survive on the 
streets with resilience, humour, flamboyance 
and dignity.” Before shooting, Nair and her 
scriptwriter, Sooni Taraporevala, a college 
friend and a native of Bombay, conducted a 
three-month workshop with 30 street 
children, all of whom then performed in the 
feature film. Salaam Bombay! won 23 
international awards including the Caméra 
d’Or and the Prix du Public at the 1989 
Cannes Film Festival. In the same year it 
received an Academy award nomination as 
Best Foreign Language Film. Nair is proud 
of it. “Especially for our children and for 
India, since it’s the first nomination we’ve 
had since 1957, the year I was born.” 
The “Kuskoo Didi” (tough sister), as 
the street children called her, made sure 
they get long-term benefit from Salaam 
Bombay! She put the bulk of their salaries in 
a bank account, and with some of the film’s 
profits she and her colleagues established 
“Salaam Balak Trust”, 
that 
a non-profit 
organization provides homeless 
children with educational, medical and 
vocational services. 
After making Kama Sutra:A Tale of Love 
(1997), she battled with the Indian censors 
for eighteen months before it could be 
released and shown in cinema halls across 
the country. “The censor board wanted to 
cut out everything vaguely sexual, cut it 
beyond recognition.I had to go all the way 
to the Supreme Court of India to release 
my film.” 
Nair now lives in Cape Town (South 
Africa) with her husband Mahmood 
Mamdani, a political scientist, and their 
young son Zohran. Her interest in the 
themes of identity, culture and exile 
continues. Faithful to her own personal 
tradition she is currently preparing for yet 
another trans-continental move. [|

### 114158: Mira Nair: an eye for paradox

often became impatient when I had to wait 
for something to happen and then not 
having it happen like I hoped it would. I 
wanted to have a lot more control over 
gesture and drama. So I shifted to feature 
films. The challenge in a feature film is to 
capture the sense of the instantaneous 
moment of a documentary. Documentaries 
have a certain edge as events seem to unroll 
before the camera. This is difficult to 
convey in the controlled environment of a 
feature film. 
My greatest challenge in Kama Sutra 
was to be faithful to myself and to make a 
film about strong women who are not afraid 
to celebrate their sexuality and have found a 
way to love fully. Another challenge was to 
create a world that felt real. Not to create 
one mired in exotica and anthropology, but 
one that felt so local that it became universal. 
I wanted to address the lack of 
understanding or thought about what is 
genuinely Eros and how we should be 
prepared to handle Love. I think I succeeded 
in showing how Eros permeates everyday 
life. 
The film is not targeted at any 
particular audience. It’s for the world. 
Perhaps this ambitious goal proved to be a 
problem for me, but it was a good lesson. 
Although I achieved what I wanted to in 
the visual and sensual qualities of Kama 
Sutra, 1 felt that the story suffered. 
Film-making is a journey, like any other 
work of art. You make films and hope that 
the end product is what you wanted. 
Sometimes you achieve that and sometimes 
you end up with something different. 
How did Indian women viewers respond to 
Kama Sutra? 
When the movie was released in India 
last year I made contractual obligations 
with the distributors that there should be 
matinee screenings thrice a week for 
women only. In Indian cinemas, 90 per cent 
ofthe audience are men. I did not want my 
female audience to be harassed or 
intimidated by men’s presence, so I insisted 
on these all-women screenings. It made 
women feel safer and made it easier to see 
my message. 
It is a myth that Indian women do not 
want to know about intimate love. In fact, 
the film was a great hit and women 
frequented the theatres all over the country. 
It was among the top three commercially 
successful movies in India last year. 
How do you find finance in a developing 
country where there is hardly any support 
for art movies? 
I am lucky that my films actually make 
TALKING TO... 
money for those who invest in them. For me the 
most important thing is to have complete 
independence while making a movie. Yet it is 
very difficult to find finance for my kind of work 
in India. That’s why I rely on a mix of 
international distributors, mostly from Japan, 
Europe and some in India. I don’t take the whole 
sum from one person or company because that 
would involve a lot of constraints and 
dependence. I would have to make a movie 
according to the needs and interests of the 
financier instead of making a film that is mine. I 
think you have much more freedom with $6 
million raised independently than $50 million 
from a single studio. 
Do you consider film-making to be a cultural 
industry or an art form justifying and requiring 
state support? 
As an art form, films do need support. For 
example, it would not have been possible for me 
to make my first feature film without support 
from India’s National Film Development 
Corporation. We get to see lots of good movies 
from Australia where the state supports the 
industry. Ideally speaking, a movie should be able 
to support itself, but I still believe in some form of 
assistance or subsidies, especially for first films. 
India produces the largest number of commercial 
films in the world, with 
its own version of Hollywood referred 
to as Bollywood (Bombay). Yet the 
country fails to produce good art film directors. 
Why? 
I wouldn’t say that Indian directors lack 
talent. It is simply that they lack opportunities. 
Basically you have to struggle for yourself to find 
finance for your movies in India. Unless the 
financier is sure about making profits, he will 
not support the project. Second, there is a big 
problem in distributing films. I know many cases 
where movies are made but never seen because 
there aren’t any distributors for art films. It’s not 
that Indian audiences aren’t interested in seeing 
independent films. The problem lies in the lack 
of theatres committed to showing them. 
What next? 
I am now working on a movie called Bombay 
2000, which I suppose I could call my first 
Bollywood film, but on my own terms. It’s about 
a city going global, about the relationship 
between a mother and daughter and an 
American hustler who enters their lives. The 
mother was a legendary film actress in the old 
Bollywood and now dubs Baywatch [an 
American television series] into Hindi.And her 
daughter is a starlet in current super-slick 
Bollywood films. u

2Good reading! 
We place the Courier in our Library. It is 
one of the favourite publications of our 
library users. The new Courier has attracted 
many positive comments. We appreciate the 
new format and the broad coverage. 
The Rector,

What about the 
heritage? 
Personally I am very satisfied with the new 
UNEsco Courier. . . . However,l regret the 
disappearance of the feature on world 
heritage sites which appeared in the old 
format. It added a cultural tourism 
dimension and complemented the World 
Heritage Review, to which I am a subscriber.

Maori treasures 
My mother, who is ninety-three years of 
age, has been subscribing to the Courier for 
decades. She passes copies of the magazine 
to me,and I have a shelf full of them. They 
are taonga, the Maori word for spiritual 
treasures. . . . 
Examples of successful initiatives 
elsewhere on the planet are always 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
inspirational. We need those to be covered 
by our media sources with an urgency never 
before seen in human history, and whatever 
the Courier can contribute to progress in 
that area is both very welcome and 
essential.

No more change, 
please 
The Courierhas been a great help to me and 
my students. . . I suggest that the magazine 
should not change its present content and 
presentation, because it has a universal 
approach enabling it to handle topics in a 
wide range of fields in a clear and simple way, 
backed up by photos and facts and figures. 
Bechane Manage 
Harar, Ethiopia 
From words to action 
In my country it is not easy to get hold of 
the UNEsco Courier, and consequently I 
hand on my copies to my local library. 
I would like to suggest that you launch 
a feature covering UNESCO’s work and ways 
in which people can take part init... .I 
think it is essential for young people to be 
involved in the Organization’s work. 
Mauricio Codina.

What’sin a name? 
When I received the new Courier I didn’t 
notice any radical change. The only thing 
that surprised me at first is that the order of 
words in the title has changed. Instead of 
The UNEsco Courier it seems to have 
become UNESCO, the Courier. 
Kheira Brahim 
Oran,Algeria 
 
Recycled paper 
I like the new format of the UNEsco 
Courier. The magazine is very informative. 
Since UNESCO is focused on environmental 
issues, do you use recycled paper to 
produce the magazine? 
Kim Burnham 
ngwillia@ix.netcom.com 
In spite of the high cost and inferior 
quality of printing on recycled paper, we 
hope to be using it as soon as possible.
