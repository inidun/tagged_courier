### 113616: Kabul: women in the shadows

Kabul: women 
In the shadows 
abul, March 1998. It has been raining 
for two days in the rubble-strewn 
capital of Afghanistan, a country at 
war since 1979. The streets of the central 
bazaar have turned to mud. Wrapped in thin 
blankets they use as coats, Kabul’s residents 
shuffle through the city. There are men but few 
women, who today live under harsh laws that 
seem to date back to the Middle Ages. In a few 
months a series of prohibitive measures has 
targeted the frightened, bereft female 
population. Forbidden to walk in the streets 
alone, like shadows they hug the walls of sun- 
dried brick in groups of two or three. Wrapped 
Since September 1996, 
the new masters 
of Kabul have imposed 
apartheid on 80 per 
cent of Afghanistan. 
This time, segregation is 
not based on skin colour 
but on gender 
  
in the chadri, a veil that covers every inch of 
their bodies, they peer out from behind fabric 
screens. Women are forbidden to work or 
study. Worse yet, they are not allowed to seek 
out care in public hospitals. Since 1997 they 
have only been allowed to visit private clinics— 
which few can afford—or a run-down hospital 
without water,electricity, heat or an operating 
room. In other words, it is just a place to die. 
In the Afghanistan of the Taliban, or 
“religion students”, only male doctors can 
work in hospitals—but they are not allowed 
to treat or operate on women. Dr. Shams,

asked what she was afraid of, she replied that 
neighbours could have seen us enter the

Noticing Shamira’s dread, I asked her, “What

Federico Mayor 
  
Each of us is 
responsible for 
replacing the 
logic of force 
with the logic of 
reason and 
respect for the 
views of others 
 
responsability 
n the threshold of a new millennium, the issue of responsibility is taking on a new 
dimension.Humankind is still beset by war and violence.It also faces new global 
  
challenges. The impact of human activity on our planet is so great that for the first 
time in recorded history, we may be approaching the point of no return. The widening 
asymmetry within and between countries,environmental destruction and flourishing arms 
sales raise doubts about many of civilization’s values and standards. How can we handle 
new global threats? History shows that no situation is hopeless if risks are identified early 
enough. 
The conflicts that have arisen since the end of the Cold War have erupted not as a 
consequence of new freedoms but in reaction to earlier oppression or repression. Suspicion, 
intolerance and hatred built up over decades,even centuries. But alongside the armed strife 
of recent years, humankind has begun to demonstrate a new skill in resolving conflicts. 
Mozambique, El Salvador, the Philippines, the changes in South Africa that would have 
been inconceivable just a few years ago, the efforts for peace in the Middle East and, finally, 
the beginnings of a settlement in Northern Ireland are all examples proving that conflict is 
not inevitable. They demonstrate that breakthroughs to peace can be made by dialogue, 
mediation,negotiation and imagination—not force. 
That is why the transition from a culture of war to a culture of peace is the foremost 
challenge as the twentieth century draws to a close. To succeed we—all of us,day in and day 
out—must not only do away with approaches based on force and imposition, but profoundly 
change cultural attitudes and daily behaviour. 
We must use imagination and resolution to go to the roots of world problems and nip 
conflicts in the bud or,better still,prevent them.Learning to live together means daring to 
share,daring to do things differently, daring to dream of a better, safer, more just and humane 
world.It also means having the resolve and courage to transform our dreams into reality. 
Here I wish to underline the pivotal role of education in promoting a culture of peace. By 
education, mean not only formal instruction in schools but also informal training within a 
whole range of cultural institutions, including in the very first place the family and the media. 
Who will be responsible for changing the culture of war into a culture of peace? 
Governments,parliaments,intergovernmental organizations, we might reply. The answer is 
correct, but it is not the only one. The transformation cannot be achieved without the active 
involvement of those with financial resources and influence. T his answer would also be true, 
though only partly so. For in the final analysis, replacing the logic of force and confrontation 
with the logic of reason and respect for the views of others is a responsibility that belongs to 
all nations and all citizens, to each of us no matter how great or small the scope of our 
individual responsibility. T he challenge of promoting a culture of peace is so broad and far- 
reaching that it can only be accomplished if it becomes a priority for the entire United 
Nations system. The dream of achieving a world without strife and violence is what led the 
founders of UNESCO to make saving future generations from the scourge of war the 
organization’s prime goal. 
The Mahatma Gandhi said, “In the midst of darkness, light prevails.” It is that light 
which is spread by the democratic values enshrined in UNESCO’s constitution: justice, freedom, 
equality and solidarity. [|

### 113618: The Greenhouse gas trade

Climate change: 
Judging by the number of unresolved 
disagreements, the next round of negotiations to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions looks like it 
will be poisonous. Despite the initial consensus 
formalized by the Kyoto Protocol signed in Japan 
last December, major divisions remain. The 
United States wants to postpone any reductions 
in domestic energy consumption. Europe, 
although dragging its feet, has shown greater 
willingness to respect commitments made under 
the Protocol. And the developing countries refuse 
to sacrifice economic growth to reduce a global 
threat for which they do not feel responsible   
The greenhouse gastrade 
he Kyoto Protocol to cut carbon 
emissions in industrialized countries 
isincreasingly understood not as an 
environmental agreement but perhaps as 
one of the most significant trade 
agreements of the century. Given the 
enormous stakes involved, it is in the 
interest of developing countries, like India 
and China, to fully explore the implications 
of the Protocol instead of succumbing to 
Western pressure to accept it. 
It is important to recognize that the 
Protocol, signed in December 1997, still 
marks a step forward in the world’s resolve to 
arrest the problem ofhuman-induced climate 
change. This is of particular concern for 
developing countries, which are twice as 
vulnerable to the resulting damage as 
industrialized nations, according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), set up by the United Nations in 
10 The Unesco Courier - October 1998 
1988. Several commentators, especially in 
the West, have pointed out the Protocol’s 
possible ineffectiveness. But it also neglects 
the long-term interests of the current and 
future generations of developing countries. 
Under the Protocol, industrialized 
countries are expected to cut their overall 
emissions by at least five percent below 1990 
levels between 2008 and 2012.T he problem 
is that compliance has been reduced to a 
numbers game in which countries promising 
a higher “percentage reduction”are seen as 
good players and those arguing for lower 
percentages are the difficult ones. This is a 
smokescreen drawing attention away from 
the real issue at stake: the heaviest emitters of 
greenhouse gases, namely industrialized 
countries, can continue polluting through 
an accounting system which allows them to 
meet their promised emissions reductions 
targets without actually reducing emissions. 
The key to this accounting lies in the 
base-year calculations which help to 
determine the “assigned amount ” of 
greenhouse gases each country can emit. Ifa 
country does not fully use its assigned 
amount, it can then sell the remaining portion 
to another country. High calculations could 
give countries a head start in meeting their 
“percentage requirements” later because they 
simply phase out industries which were 
grinding to a halt regardless of the Protocol. 
This system offers a perverse incentive 
for developing countries to actually increase 
their emissions as fast as possible so that if and 
when they do set their base-year calculations, 
they too will have a head start in meeting 
their percentage reductions. This is perhaps 
the worst aspect of the Protocol:developing 
countries which move towards energy 
efficiency in a big way today will find it harder 
and more expensive to meet high percentage

reductions later when base year emissions 
are set. On the other hand, those countries 
which continue using high-emission 
technologies and fuels will find it relatively 
easy to accept high percentage reductions 
and as a result will look good in front of the 
world. 
“Meaningful 
participation” 
Yet despite this fatal weakness, the North is 
putting tremendous pressure on developing 
countries to take part in the Protocol. United 
States Vice President Al Gore could not have 
been more direct when speaking to a press 
conference in Kyoto on 8 December 1997: 
“In order to sign an agreement, or in order to 
send an agreement to the Senate, we must 
have meaningful participation by key 
developing countries.” 
“Meaningful participation” has proven 
to be a vague and perhaps misleading 
concept in the Protocol. For example, 
Article 12 ostensibly promotes North-South 
cooperation by setting up a Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) to 
encourage industrialized countries to invest 
in carbon-efficient technology in the South. 
However, the purpose of the CDM isnot to 
help the South but to explicitly “assist” 
industrialized countries to meet their 
commitments to reduce emissions. Under 
the plan, developing countries sell “certified 
reduction” units to industrialized countries 
and private corporations in exchange for 
investment in carbon-efficient programmes. 
The units can be used as credits in the 
“balance sheets” of the Protocol’s carbon 
accounting system. 
The CDM is riddled with moral and 
economic loopholes. One can begin by asking

is 
if there is no other role for developing countries 
in combating climate change than just helping 
industrialized countries meet their 
commitments. It is important to realize that 
under the scheme, industrialized countries 
need not change anything domestically by 
investing in projects in the South. 
At the same time, the CDM offers the 
North a way of buying the participation of 
the South.But at what price? It is clearly in 
the interest of the North to keep the prices of 
“emission reduction” units as low as possible. 
The US administration, for example, plans on 
buying as many emission units as possible at 
the cheapest cost. So it is not altogether 
surprising to find American authorities 
offering as little as $14 to $23 per tonne for 
emissions credits. In contrast, a domestic 
emission reduction programme is estimated 
to run $125 per tonne. 
The CDM is designed to ensure that the 
North has the cheapest array of projects to 
choose from in the South. Under the CDM, 
numerous certification agencies will assess 
internal compliance and reporting 
mechanisms of countries selling emission 
reduction units. This will force developing 
countries to compete with each other in 
providing the North with the cheapest, most 
efficient portfolios of projects to invest in. 
One thing is clear. Climate change has 
been taken out of the world of the 
environmental lobby and placed in the world 
of money. The goal is now to trade this 
commodity (emissions) without limits and 
without the interference of prickly issues like 
the property rights of the poor. 
The cheap deal 
may be the most expensive 
Now let us assume that this brokering system 
works in the short term and developing 
countries do move towards more energy- 
efficient technologies. A longer-term 
perspective raises important questions. The 
more efficient these countries become the 
less economic incentive there is for the 
industrialized countries to invest in them.It 
will eventually be cheaper for the North to 
invest in its own countries. And if global 
warming is still a threat—as it would be 
because industrialized countries had not

Down with 
POP! 
A’ anti-POP movement is gaining strength 
around the world. Nothing much to do with 
music,though.lt’sa trend involving a hundred or 
so countries which are negotiating over the 
reduction or elimination of persistent organic 
pollutants (POP), substances which are 
considered to be some of the most dangerous 
ever produced by humankind. 
They include insecticides like DDT and 
industrial by-products such as dioxin, huge 
quantities of which are produced by waste 
incinerators, and furane, which is used as a 
solvent in plastics or resinous material. Exposure 
to POPs can cause cancer, damage the nervous 
system and interfere with the immune system. 
The United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), which is co-ordinating the inter- 
governmental talks, points out that there isnow 
broad agreement on the need to cut down on the 
use of such toxic materials. But this surface 
consensus cannot hide the disagreement 
between rich and poor countries on the subject. 
The industrialized nations have already banned 
or restricted the use of various POPs, such as 
DDT and several chlorine compounds. 
Thirty-two countries in Europe and North 
America even signed, at the end of June, two 
memorandums on air pollution aimed at 
strengthening these measures. The intention was 
to step up the international anti-pollution 
movement to avoid the consequences of the 
“ grasshopper effect,” whereby pollutantstravel 
from one side of the globe to the other through 
the air or in the sea.Only world-wide measures 
can curb the effects of this on local populations. 
Against this approach stand the poorer 
countries, which continue, for example, to use 
DDT to fight malaria,which kills more than two 
million people every year. They want the rich 
countries to dip into their pockets to help them 
use less harmful but often more costly 
alternatives. 
In short, the anti-POP campaign doesnot have 
its song ready yet. The negotiating countries met 
in Montreal, Canada, in July and gave themselves 
until the end of the century to finish writing the 
score. [|

taken any action at home—then there would 
be pressure on developing countries to cut 
back yet again on carbon dioxide emissions, 
this time on their own and at a higher price. 
So what form of institutional co-operation 
will be available then? 
The CDM does not answer this question. 
It leaves the future of North-South co- 
operation on climate change up in the air. 
Even worse, it allows current generations in 
developing countries to sell off cheaper 
emissions-control options today, leaving an

he Kyoto Protocol was endorsed at 
the eleventh hour on 10 December 
1998 by representatives of some 150 
governments after adding a final point. 
Since they failed to reach a consensus on 
several key issues, they would negotiate 
them later, in particular at the fourth 
conference of the signatories to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change in Buenos Aires from 2 to 13 
November, 1998. But as the conference 
nears, those countries are still far from 
heated 
discussions during a preparatory meeting in 
agreement, judging by the 
Bonn last June. 
Under the 
industrialized countries (called the Appendix 
Kyoto Protocol, the 
One states) will have to cut their overall 
greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent, 
generally below 1990 levels, between now 
and the period 2008-2012. However, this 
objective masks a wide range of different 
commitments. The United States has agreed 
to cut its emissions by eight per cent, the 
European Union (with different targets for 
different member states), Switzerland and 
most central and eastern European countries 
by eight per cent and Japan and Canada by 
six per cent. Russia, Ukraine and New Zealand 
will be allowed to maintain their current

emissions levels. Some countries will be 
permitted to increase them, including Norway 
by one per cent, Australia by eight per cent and 
Iceland by as much as ten per cent. 
But the United States, which accounts for 
approximately one-fifth of the world’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, has repeatedly said 
it will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol unless 
certain conditions are met. Washington insists 
on the “meaningful participation” of 
developing countries (see preceding article) 
as well as on the swift establishment of an 
international market to trade “emissions 
permits”. 
T his system, the details of which have not 
yet been ironed out,is intended to encourage 
some countries to cut their emissions below the 
assigned levels so that they can then “sell”’the 
difference. T hat would entitle major energy 
consumers such as the United States and 
countries which would find it very expensive 
to cut emissions, like Japan, to “buy” the right 
to continue polluting at home from other 
countries. 
Their aim is to safeguard industrial 
competitiveness by avoiding costly outlays to 
reduce emissions and, in some cases, to 
preserve an energy-guzzling lifestyle.

Clinton administration is hoping to meet

even heavier financial burden for future 
generations. 
The principles of this emissions trade will 
be further elaborated at November's 
Conference of Parties in Buenos Aires. This 
is the occasion, however, to go a step further 
in recognizing and building upon the 
principle of “equal per capita entitlements” 
in which all individuals have the right to emit 
the same amount of greenhouse gases. T his 
strategy would be used to calculate emissions 
entitlements based on each country’s 
population. Not only would such a step be 
globally just, but it would offer the best way 
to move towards the ultimate objective of the 
Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(the origins of the Kyoto Protocol), namely 
the stabilization of the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases. This 
equitable approach is far more effective 
than the creative accounting strategy of the 
Protocol. 
Discussions in Buenos Aires must also 
take into account the rapid rate at which 
developing countries are growing. If they did 
CH 
PLANET 
accept the Protocol, they would have “assigned 
amounts” of emissions. However, it is unlikely 
they could make full use of these entitlements 
in the near future. Instead, an equitable and 
environmental solution lies in letting them 
trade this unused entitlement later as their 
economies develop. This provision would 
immediately give them the incentive to trade— 
not merely to help industrialized countries 
meet their targets—as well as to move towards 
a low-emissions development path in which the 
trading benefits and options stay open as long 
as possible. 
T his economic environment would help 
create a global market for Western solar 
energy technologies—first in developing 
countries and then in industrialized nations— 
to help kick-start the global transition towards 
zero-emissions technologies. T he faster these 
technologies invade the energy sector, the 
quicker the world would be able to avert the 
threat of climate change. In this way, 
developing countries would, to use the US 
phrase, enter the most meaningful form of 
participation. u

A new name 
for El Nino 
t originates in the tropical waters of the 
Pacific. In itswake it leaves a trail of flattened 
crops and homes, torrential downpours, 
drought, flooding, bursts of cold weather and 
hurricane-force winds. . . . In recent times, 
there has scarcely been a natural disaster for 
which it has not been blamed. In Latin America 
alone, it has been the cause of at least 900 
deaths and of economic losses amounting to 
more than $20 billion. 
It is known as El Niio— “ the little one” . This 
was the name given by Peruvian fishermen 
because its effects were felt over the Christmas 
period w hen, according to the Christian religion, 
the infant Jesus was born. 
Worried by such headlinesin the pressas“ H 
Nifio:Beware!” or“ We are being threatened 
by El Nifio” , the Colombian Red Cross has 
launched a campaign calling for this disastrous 
phenomenon to be given another name. 
And there was even greater anxiety with 
the arrival of La Nifia,a current related to H 
Nifio with equally devastating effects. 
At the initiative of Colombia,the national 
Red Cross societies of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, 
Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru,Uruguay and 
Venezuela have signed joint petitions stating, 
“it has been observed that the children of 
Latin American countries are being upset by 
the fact that the word by which they are known 
has come to be associated with destruction 
and death.” For this reason they hoped that 
“the public and the specialized agencies will 
realize the harmful consequences of this 
misuse of language” 
Roberto Liévano Perdomo, vice-president 
of the Colombian Red Cross, isthe leader of 
the movement aimed at having the term “ El 
Nifio” replaced by“ Pacific phenomenon” , after 
the ocean in which it occurs. 
However, somepeople claim— and they are 
not entirely wrong— that the term “ Pacific 
phenomenon” could also give rise to 
misunderstanding, since it is a destructive 
phenomenon that is not exactly “ pacific” . 
Even so, outside Latin America and 
Colombia in particular, where the new term 
isalready starting to be used, it isso far only 
a declaration of intent, since the World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) has not 
officially recorded any petition to that effect.

www.$5$ @online. 
The construction boom in “virtual classrooms” is leading universitites to find 
new partners and competitors in the corporate world 
he sleek towers and domed halls of 
Singapore’s Temasek Polytechnic 
offer the services students dream 
of—state-of-the-art libraries and data 
bases, easy course registration, tutorials, 
study guides, financial ad vice for tuition and 
more—all without hours or energy wasted 
waiting in line. If seeing is believing, why 
not wander over to the students’ centre for 
a quick visit? A few keystrokes on the 
Internet and you are there. 
Welcome to the world of online 
education. Students around the globe can 
enrol in classes like Temasek’s, which cover 
everything from engineering to tourism and 
even an introduction to Japanese Katakana 
characters. Time and distance are no longer 
an obstacle to learning, as students download 
specially designed courses according to their 
own schedules, with tutorials and extra 
materials available via e-mail, CD-roms and 
electronic libraries open around the clock. 
Exams,papers and even private consultations 
with professors or other students are all done 
within the comfort of home. 
In the last year, virtual classrooms of all 
shapes and sizes have been under 
construction around the world, offering very 
real solutions for universities and training 
institutes threatened by dwindling public 
resources and students needing more flexible 
course materials and schedules to compete in 
today’s job market. Mexico’s Monterey 
Institute of Technology, for example, is 
developing online courses and importing 
them from universities north of the border. 
Even the World Bank is getting involved with 
plans for a virtual university in Africa.And 
while it is natural to find traditional distance 
education providers such as UK Open 
University breaking into this new field, 
prestigious brand-name schools are also 
investing. Duke University of the United 
States has proudly opened its “Global 
Executive MBA” to a hand-picked class of 
mostly international businesspeople with 
tuiton at $85,000. 
This new distance education is a far cry 
from the lowly correspondence courses of 
14 The Unesco Courier - October 1998 
the past, seen as a “second-chance” for those 
who couldn’t make it in or have access to 
regular educational channels. It also 
represents not just another learning 
opportunity but a promising new market for 
telecommunications and computer 
corporations, vying to provide the “piping” —
satellite systems, computer platforms for 
administration or “smart cards” offering 
access to electronic libraries—to deliver 
services far and wide. From Germany to 
Malaysia, telecommunications and computer 
giants are negotiating “wiring” costs with 
public and private learning institutions, now 
seen as new partners for computer companies 
like Microsoft and Apple. 
Consider the case of Western Governors 
University (WGU) formed in 1997 by a 
group of governors from the western United 
‘Globalization is a term 
that gets used a lot, but 
just like trade and 
commerce, education is 
becoming more and 
more integrated across 
national borders’ 
 
States. Convinced that education was failing 
to meet the needs of employers and students 
alike,they created a virtual university which 
distributes services (courses) developed by 
associated universities and corporate training 
programmes. T he real surprise lies in its 
National Advisory Board,a powerful mix of 
state representatives and business leaders 
from companies like Microsoft,Apple,Sun 
Microsystems, IBM and above all AT &T, 
(one of the world’s largest 
telecommunications companies), which has 
donated more than $750,000. With backing 
like this,the governors are broadening their 
horizons, moving beyond the local market 
by brokering co-operative agreements with 
overseas “suppliers”—universities and 
telecom companies—in Japan, the United 
Kingdom,Canada,Mexico and China. 
“Globalization is a term that gets used a 
lot, but just like trade and commerce, 
education is becoming more and more 
integrated across national borders,” says 
Reidar Roll of the non-profit International 
Council for Distance Education (ICDE), 
which includes learning institutes and 
corporations in more than 130 countries. 
“We are beginning to see a more global 
education market.” 
Roll doesn’t seem to question the rise of 
this “market” —a battle cry for those who see 
education as a public responsibility and not 
a commodity. Yet in this new electronic age of 
distance education, the fine line between the 
private and public sectors has been blurred 
from the start. While universities did much of 
the research and development making online 
learning technologically possible—often with 
corporate support—it is the private sector 
which supplies the pieces needed to build 
the virtual campus. 
Even the course content is market-based. 
Online students are for the most part not 
looking for philosophy or art history classes 
but professional training in areas like business 
management, financial services, English, 
information technologies, teaching and health 
sciences. 
In short, the incredible potential for 
online learning lies in the insecurity of today’s 
job market as the ever-shortening shelf-life of 
knowledge forces the “professionally fit” to 
continually upgrade their skills. In Finland, 
for example, 45% of employed adults 
between the ages of 25 to 64 take part in 
some form of career-related continuing 
education and training during a year, 
according to a 1997 survey by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD). Even Canada’s 
low rate of 28 per cent still represents 
considerable demand. 
“People want to acquire the skills that 
are applicable and enhance their mobility,” 
says John Mallea, a Canadian expert in the 
field and consultant for the OECD. “In 
Eastern and Central Europe, professionals

English in numbers we haven't seen before. 
Until last year’s currency crisis, Asia was a

At the same time, regional trade 
agreements in North America,Europe and 
Southeast Asia are opening the door to free 
trade in educational services,particularly in 
professional training, which is considered 
less sensitive than primary or secondary 
schooling in terms of national autonomy. 
“Education is considered a service like any 
other,” says a legal officer of the World Trade 
Organization, who points out that 30

For better or worse, free trade in online

of barriers or buffers—depending on your 
point of view—is firmly in place. To begin

the preserve of national authorities and so 
vary greatly from one country to the next. 
The lack of technological standards is another 
obstacle in delivering education from one 
country or region to another.

While it is too soon for any accurate 
forecasts of the online education market— 
estimates vary from one to four billion dollars 
for the year 2000—there are growing fears 
that companies will eventually take over the 
role of learning institutes. “If Microsoft 
wanted to, they could create a university to 
compete,” says Roll of ICDE. “Or if Harvard 
wanted to, they could enter alliances to offer 
them (the companies) a brand name on the 
international market. I think the plans are 
there.” 
Not so fast, says Jim Kuhr, manager of 
Microsoft’s worldwide education activities. 
“We don’t see ourselves as an educational 
company—we are not experts in curriculum 
or pedagogy. Our focus has been to work with 
partners who are specialists

am not sure that any corporation will tell you 
their strategy,” says Tony Bates, director of 
the Distance Education and Technology unit 
of Canada’s University of British Columbia. 
“And if they did, that strategy may change. 
For instance, we are actually m aking a profit 
on some of our online courses. Who knows 
what will happen once that gets out.” 
The secret to the university’s success lies 
in cherry-picking and niche-marketing.“To 
offer a basic microbiology course, we would 
need some competitive advantage over the 
rest of the world, like a Nobel Prize winner, 
which we don’t have.But with our contacts 
in the forestry department, we are offering 
courses in wood science, for example, in 
Indonesia and Australia, where there is an 
emerging regional market 
in that.But we do have an 
interest in providing the 
infrastructure pieces—Ilike 
network operating systems, 
share files and e-mail— 
needed to make distance 
learning successful.” 
While Kuhr recognizes 
brand-name universities as 
obvious marketing targets, 
the real heavyweights may 
It is difficult 
to justify tax dollars 
spent on education 
if the private sector 
can do the job 
aswell as 
the public sector 
in secondary wood 
products. 
“All of this sounds like 
someone trying to run a 
business, and I am 
surprised to find myself 
liking this role,” says Bates. 
“This is in response to a 
government which tells us 
to be less dependent on 
taxes. This is not an 
lie in developing countries 
in Asia and Latin America. 
“The enrolment potential is going up so 
dramatically that the governments cannot 
afford to build the brick and mortar 
campuses to meet the demand. These 
governments see online learning and other 
opportunities in the information society as a 
way to radically move their countries ahead— 
that is, if they find the initial investment for 
infrastructure.” 
In fact, “wiring” is becoming less of a 
financial burden as telecom prices fall with 
deregulation. And with the current spate of 
mergers transforming the industry, new 
markets like online education are becoming 
all the more competitive. 
AT &T’s interest in online education is 
“multi-layered”, according to Marilyn Reznick 
of the telecom giant’s philanthropic 
foundation.“We have a responsibility to make 
sure that people can understand the 
technologies we develop. It is also in our 
interest to send our philanthropic dollars to 
universities where we do business, recruit 
people, train our employees and do our R&D.” 
“We might also go to a university with 
which we have relations and ask, ‘are you 
going to provide the workers we need? If 
not, we will help provide the resources to 
develop that training. But we would never 
dream of telling them how to teach. We are 
not competing with them.” 
A sigh of relief from the ivory towers? “I

inevitable result of market 
forces but a political 
decision.” 
However, there is a fine line between 
profit-making and becoming profit-driven. 
“You have to ask, ‘what is the role of a publicly 
funded college 7” says Bates. “It is difficult to 
justify tax dollars spent on education if the 
private sector can do the job as well as the 
public sector. But I think the public needs 
some independent critique and analysis of 
the government and private sector policies. 
Somebody has to have the independence to 
ask who is benefiting in a society.” 
There is also a question of equity. “There 
are areas that you just cannot make money 
on, like education for the handicapped or 
social work courses. That is where the 
government has to step in to ensure that all 
sectors of society are served as much as 
possible.” u

Spanish 
yous Brazilians can no longer be content 
with learning only English; they have to learn 
Spanish aswell. This view, advocated by Senator 
José Forgaca of the Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party (PMDB), has been supported 
by the upper chamber of Congress, which 
approved a draft law that will make it mandatory 
to teach Spanish in all the country’s government 
secondary schools 
According to the ministry of education, the 
project will enrol some 6.5 million pupils and 
require at least 200,000 teachers. That is why 
the bill,originally drafted by a former president 
and current senator, Itamar Franco, will be 
introduced only gradually over a five-year period. 
The idea of making it compulsory to learn 
Spanish, which is still awaiting final congressional 
approval, has been evolving. Senator Pedro 
Simén, also a member of the PMDB, proposed in 
1995 that learning Spanish should be made 
obligatory, although only in the states bordering 
Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina which, like 
Brazil, are members of the Southern Common 
Market (MERCOSUR). 
In fact,ever since Brazil joined MERCOSUR, 
Spanish has clearly gained ground.Classes are 
in demand in the private schools that have been 
sprouting like mushroomsin the country’s main 
cities. Meanwhile, portufial, a hybrid of 
Portuguese and Spanish, hasbecome a working 
language commonly used in diplomatic circlesin 
Brasilia and business spheres of Sao Paulo. 
The project is not merely a question of 
education but involves considerable economic 
interests. According to Senator Fogaga, the new 
law “ will be instrumental in forming a true Latin 
American community” which will more than ever 
integrate Brazil, the only Portuguese-speaking 
giant in an otherwise Spanish-speaking region. 
Spanish, the official language of 21 countries 
and spoken by 413 million people, is the world’s 
fourth most widely spoken tongue after Chinese, 
English and Hindi.lt is also gaining ground as a 
second language in the United States. u

Respect for human rights has come a long way, some say. 
Others argue that they are still flouted almost everywhere, 
and that the return of unbridled market forces around the 
globe threatens the strides made in the past half-century. 
Progress here, setbacks there, new demands everywhere. As 
the world changes, who is fighting to defend human dignity 
and fulfil the universal aspiration to a better life? And how? 
What are states, citizens and international bodies doing to 
promote rights that too many people still do not enjoy? Is 
globalization making the struggle easier or more difficult? 
One thing is sure: the long battle for “all rights for 
everyone” is far from over.

As the world changes, so does the defense of human rights. 
International civil society is mobilizing in reaction to new 
threats to the gains already made 
he world is going through a period of far- 
reaching upheaval. Armed conflicts, flagrant 
and systematic violations of human rights and 
the denial of fundamental freedoms continue to make 
headlines in various parts of the globe. 
What parameters would help us take stock of the 
current situation regarding these rights and freedoms? 
Let us deliberately leave aside the quantitative view of 
things, which sets out to put a figure on the violations 
and outrages committed every day. This sort of 
guesswork is misleading, for there can be no doubt that 
there are countless situations midway between the 
absence of killing, abduction and arbitrary detention 
and the wholesale application of human rights— 
situations where the fact that no crime has been 
committed does not necessarily mean that justice 
prevails. Intimidation and blackmail can also create 
a semblance of order. 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its 
Covenants and other international instruments and

mechanisms are the normative and theoretical 
framework of tangible results and a systematic 
broadening of the concept of human rights over the 
past 50 years. Approved in 1948 by the international 
community as acommon set of rules recognizing the 
inherent dignity and inalienable rights of all people in 
all countries, the Universal Declaration was, in its 
day, a response to the global clamour for an end to the 
horrors of world war. Subsequently, the struggle for 
human rights was also a powerful weapon in the 
demise of totalitarian regimes such as those in Eastern 
Europe and of bloody military dictatorships on every 
continent. It also served to curb the authoritarian 
behaviour of governments formally considered 
democratic. At times, this struggle has borne the seeds 
of democracy, not just in terms of a system of 
government but of a forum for exercising fundamental 
freedoms. We all remember how international public 
opinion, with its insistent demands for human rights, 
contributed to the fall of regimes like those of Marcos 
in the Philippines, Somoza in Nicaragua, Pinochet in 
Chile, Pol Pot in Cambodia and apartheid in South 
Africa.

Universal Declaration which continues to be the 
source of inspiration and the standard by which we 
measure our successes. T here is not a single country 
that denies its validity and all countries have 
subscribed to it.Yet,does this signify anything more 
than mere formal recognition?When countries ratify 
the Universal Declaration,they agree to implement 
the rights explicitly set forth in its articles,to ensure 
that they are applied and to sanction those who violate 
them. There is a tendency all over the world to 
incorporate these international legal instruments into 
national law. But the weakness of national judicial 
systems and the widespread corruption of political 
authorities are such that the effective application of 
these international instruments is nothing more than 
amere aspiration. T hus, it is not so much the existence 
of constitutional texts which defines democracy but 
the establishment of the rule of law, with authorities and 
means of recourse, which guarantee their application 
for the benefit of citizens. 
Even so, in the face of critical and vigilant public 
opinion no country, government or political, military 
or judicial authority would now go so far as to deny 
the existence of these fundamental rights. Indeed, 
the most significant progress made in recent years 
lies in the level of awareness attained by millions of 
individuals all over the world. As we have seen in 
many peasant communities in the Andean region of 
Latin America, citizens of the most far-flung corners 
of the earth who have never heard of the Universal 
Declaration still demand “human rights”. 
The existence, drive and combative spirit of 
thousands of associations—ranging from the relatives 
of victims of violations to organizations with an 
international scope of activity—have led to victory 
in battles which seemed doomed. We are witnessing 
the emergence of a global human rights culture based 
on implicit recognition of the fact that citizens’ 
organizations exercise the right to keep watch over the 
behaviour of states. 
This increasingly keen awareness on the part of 
civil society is bound to have an impact on government 
policies and lays the groundwork for advancing 
international legal machinery and instruments. One 
obvious example is women’s struggle to overcome 
discrimination. T he United Nations’ adoption in 
1967 of a special declaration on women’s 
rights, as well as the Beijing Conference 
and the implementation of the measures 
resulting from it, are some of the Pe Sst 
international milestones in the las 
social advancement of women. “i ERE: Ni : 3

to observe the international rules on human 
rights enacted since the 1948 Universal 
Declaration, their citizens would be protected from 
the vagaries of arbitrary power. Tens of conventions, 
covenants and declarations aimed at protecting 
individualsand groups from political and economic 
violence have been signed and ratified in the last 
half-century. 
Yet living conditions are deteriorating for much 
of the world’s population. Contrary to what that 
might suggest, since the early 1950s the United 
Nations has undertaken efforts to strengthen 
international legislation with regard to economic 
and social rights. Those are the areas covered by the 
first treaties including the Freedom of Association and 
Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 
(1948), which was soon followed by the Equal 
Remuneration Convention (1951) and the 
Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labour (1957). 
Civil rights have not been left out. The Geneva 
Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of 
War was signed in 1949 and the International 
Convention on the Himination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination adopted in 1965. International texts 
also upheld women’srights very early on. They include 
the 1952 Convention on the Political Rights of 
Women and the 1962 Convention on Consent to 
Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and 
Registration of Marriages. 
But it took the United Nations until 1966 to 
adopt two crucial texts, the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
Since then, international normative action on 
human rights has continued making headway, 
from the Convention on the Himination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women (1979) to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
(1984) and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, which was unanimously adopted in 1989. In 
addition to the 1948 Universal Declaration, the 
two covenants of 1966 and countless non-binding 
declarations, over 30 conventions have been 
adopted since 1968. 
Most states have signed and ratified these texts, 
which they are bound to observe. But that does 
not mean they do, especially since they may exercise 
their right to opt out of certain clauses while 
agreeing to others. For example, almost all the 
Muslim countries have expressed reservations on 
the conventions relative to women, effectively 
making those texts meaningless. Very few states 
have agreed to conventions in their entirety and 
incorporated their provisions into national 
legislation. The rest have reluctantly signed on and 
use all the international procedures at their disposal 
to make them null and void at home. nu

the planet’s political and economic landscape. Some 
of the most blatant features include the stepped-up 
pace of globalization, the prominence given to market 
forces at the expense of their social and governmental 
regulation, the superiority of productivity and 
competitiveness over equity, the weakening of the 
nation-state and the creation of new economic blocs. 
For the moment, globalization has not meant that 
everybody has access to common universal values. 
While exacerbating social exclusion and division, itis 
also fostering a context conducive to the strengthening 
of international mechanisms for 
individuals and humanity. Impunity has come to be 
granted by law, so that military authorities are 
exonerated from responsibility. In most cases, the 
granting of impunity has been the outcome of 
negotiations between democratically elected 
governments and soldiers surrendering power, or 
between rebel military organizations and transition 
governments after periods of domestic violence. T his 
was the case between the guerrillas of El Salvador and 
Guatemala and their respective governments and 
armed forces. Practical steps must be taken to do 
away with the problem of impunity, 
 protecting human rights. That is one of 
the main ambiguities of the present 
situation which will have to be borne in 
mind in the future, since it is changing

The question arises,then, whether provides an order, since the mechanisms of 
basic freedoms and rights have made 
any significant progress in the past ten 
years of liberal crusading. Generally 
speaking, the answer is “no”, among 
other things because the strong state is

impunity and arbitrariness also act at 
the international level. The major 
powers often change the rules according 
to their political interests or economic 
imperatives by condemning or 
being replaced not so much by a small 
and efficient state as by a weak one,which tends to 
govern on the basis of political corruption and 
cronyism. 
In this new context, it is necessary to highlight 
two aspects essential to the progress of human rights 
in the world: the struggle to prevent human rights 
violations from going unpunished and the recognition 
of the indivisible nature of those rights. 
It is common to find judicial and propaganda 
manoeuvres, often illegal and violent, aimed at 
protecting the intellectual, physical or political 
authors of dreadful crimes committed against

20 The Unesco Courier - October 1998 
pardoning the crimes committed by 
countries, depending on whether they are “enemies” 
or potential “allies”. 
The principle of indivisibility implies,in the first 
place, rejection of a ranking order of human rights,as 
well as recognition of the give-and-take relationship 
between individual freedoms and the conditions 
essential for exercising them. In this sense, one ofthe 
most disturbing new trends is the loss of economic, 
social and cultural rights affecting workers in almost 
every country. The decline in earning levels,deplorable 
working conditions, instability and the loss of welfare 
benefits by millions of people, all of which are reflected 
in growing social exclusion, are a significant step 
backwards. Underdevelopment creates a climate 
conducive to violations of fundamental rights and 
inhibits the emergence of a civil society capable of 
entering into dialogue with the state.Not only does 
this foster individualism or an “every man for himself” 
attitude, but it hinders the development of legal 
protection existing for civil and political rights. 
The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration on 10 December 1998 affords an 
opportunity to consider the gains made and to renew 
the pledge of the international community and 
citizens to engage in the enormous task before us. 
Newspapersand television remind us that there isno 
reason for complacency or self-satisfaction. There 
are, however, grounds for hope in the effective and 
increasingly forceful mobilization of human rights 
activists in national leagues or international 
organizations, often at the risk of their lives. This 
confirms that people are no longer prepared to leave 
the fulfilment of their aspirations for a more just, 
fraternal and caring world to governments or 
international authorities. u

hat kind of world are we living in today? 
The start of the 1990s saw the collapse 
of a global system divided into two spheres 
of influence, whose only merit was that it managed to 
circumscribe conflicts geographically for almost half 
a century. But the world of the 1945 Yalta Agreement 
was rooted in terror. 
In 1989 and 1990, the geopolitical system 
changed, but no new planetary vision emerged to fill 
the resulting gap.T hose who thou ght at the time that 
communism would automatically be replaced 
everywhere by democracy were wrong. Instead it was 
nationalism,containing the seeds of ethnic tension, 
which thrived in the ruins of the old system. The 
result has been an increase in the number of conflicts 
whose perpetrators escape unpunished if their actions 
happen to fit the interests of the main forces at work. 
For the old practice of double standards—a 
modulated assessment of how basic human rights 
are respected in different countries—has hardly been 
affected by the upheavals of the late 1980s. The 1990s 
have marked a geopolitical transition, but nobody 
has been able to respond to the new imbalances by 
replacing, as far as possible,the force of arms by the 
force of law. 
So human rights and democracy have not advanced 
very far as aresult of the change of scene. Despite more 
and more declarations and seminars on the subject, they 
are still not an important factor in the conduct of 
international relations. You still do not have to be a 
democrat to be have friends in the West. Before 1990, 
it was enough to be anti-communist to be one of our 
allies. T his meant that when communism collapsed, we 
were landed with a number of “friends” who were both 
useless and unpresentable. 
Then there was the “anti-terrorist” label. Terrorism 
exists, of course, and it is dangerous, but it was enough 
to proclaim oneself anti-terrorist to become one of our 
friends. Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, backed beyond all 
logic because he was fighting a “terrorist” country 
(Iran), symbolized this new blindness in the 1980s. 
T hese days, to be a friend of the West, you just 
need to apply the rules of good governance and the

market economy. The problem is that in each case 
the condition for winning Western support may be 
just,and even necessary, but it is never sufficient. 
At the same time, we have come up with more 
and more excuses for democracy supposedly not 
being possible. T his is seen, for example, by claiming 
that Africa is too poor to be democratic or by giving 
a stamp of approval,especially in Asia,to the alibi of 
cultural relativism—something which is totally 
contradicted by the facts. As soon as they are given a 
choice, Asians behave like everyone else. In 1992, 
the people of Myanmar voted overwhelmingly for 
Aung San Suu Kyi and against the military regime. 
The ultimate altar on which we are ready to 
sacrifice whatever necessary is that of stability, a much 
more presentable notion than a straightforward 
defense of our economic interests. T here again, the 
West is prepared to hand out good conduct certificates 
to those who look as if they can guarantee this. War is 
obviously a big obstacle to development, but beware 
of the stability of graveyards. 
So we go on making sacrifices to “realpolitik”. »

In Baghdad,families wait outside 
a humanitarian centre for aid. 
  
An international 
policy based on 
respect for laws, 
agreements and 
rules is the only 
possible course 
 
22 The Unesco Courier - October 1998 
Only the excuses we make for it have changed— 
yesterday it was anti-communism, today it is good 
governance. But is this truly realpolitik? Are we not in 
reality yielding to an authoritarian illusion by being 
more attracted to strong leaders than to solid 
institutions? 
The best example of this perversion is found in the 
attitudes we have long had towards the Asian “tiger” 
countries and which are based exclusively on their 
economic performance. It is wrong to insist, as people 
do, that economic growth automatically leads to 
democracy. In many Asian countries, the kind of 
growth policies chosen have not only undermined 
the chances for sustainable development but have 
also reduced the possibilities of a non-violent and 
legal transition to democracy. 
But we do not learn the lessons of history. We had 
barely stopped fooling ourselves about the Asian 
“tigers” when we came up with African “lions” — 
countries where nobody says a word about the fact 
that these new friends of ours ban political parties 
or that some of them have even developed the quaint 
notion of “democracy without parties”. 
Double standards are a vital tool in this conception 
of realpolitik. Yesterday’s enemy can become today’s 
best friend, as our priorities change. But to my mind 
true realpolitik cannot be reduced to these kinds of 
contortions. Only a diplomacybased on simple values 
recognized by everyone—including democracy and 
respect for basic human rights—can be conducted 
in the long term and defended with any dignity before 
the whole world. 
“Realists” are wrong when they say we must 
choose between realpolitik and idealism. If a policy 
is to be sustainable, it must based on an ideal. 
Taking into account the extent of our economic 
and political interests, I am convinced that it is in 
our interest to promote democracy. Development 
of economic relations calls for stability. And 
democratic institutions are infinitely more stable 
than dictatorships. 
So we have to come up with new ways of coping 
with geopolitical and economic constraints. What we 
in the European Union call critical dialogue allows us 
to use a panoply of diplomatic tools without resorting 
systematically to sanctions and isolation in a vain 
attempt to bring certain dictatorships to heel. An 
embargo on technology can be effective, but no

dictator has ever been troubled by an embargo on 
food or medical supplies. Such drastic embargoes 
can in fact stir up nationalist resentment among the 
people who suffer under them. 
Sanctions are certainly an instrument in 
international relations and should be used when all 
attempts at dialogue have been exhausted, but only as 
one of the last resorts,when a display of firmness is 
needed as part of a dialogue. 
Europe has withdrawn from Afghanistan because 
any talks with the Taliban are fruitless right now. Our 
presence there was just an alibi for them from the 
moment when humanitarian organizations were 
prevented from working in the country. Elsewhere, it 
is not yet time to slam the door. Leaving a country 
should be the very last step in our policy. 
Such a process can get bad press because it can 
never be straightforward. It is a method which 
uses gradual steps and needs to be explained 
thoroughly to be clearly understood. The other 
party or adversary, along with public opinion,has 
to be kept continually informed as to what stage 
discussions are at. 
This is the only way we can avoid being accused 
of once again using a double standard by imposing 
sanctions on some and not on others. The problem is 
that our diplomatic practices and the absence of a 
common European foreign policy means we have no 
clear and effective positions on these matters. 
The big challenge as the end of the century 
approaches is therefore to change the meaning we 
have given to realpolitik. This would be a real 
cultural revolution. We shall not be able to do it 
overnight. If we were to break off relations with every 
country which violated human rights, we would no 
longer have links with about three-quarters of the 
world’s governments. We could even find reasons 
to break off relations with some European 
countries. 
Respect for human rights is something which 
grows one day at a time.Unfortunately, the political 
establishment in developed countries hardly considers 
it a priority and major political parties are deafeningly 
silent on such issues. Their silence weakens democracy 
everywhere, including in our own countries. It is time 
for us to make a bigger place for the rule of law in 
politics. 
An international policy based on respect for laws, 
agreements and rules is the only one possible. We 
must know its intricacies so we can promote it with 
every passing day. The journey is a slow one, but 
progress is being made. 
The two ad hoc tribunals on former Yugoslavia and 
Rwanda have chalked up modest successes, but 
successes all the same. Perpetrators of genocide and 
other war criminals can no longer mock the 
international community. As human rights activists, 
we must draw strength from these achievements so we 
can prove wrong those who favour a short-sighted 
realpolitik. I am convinced there is no other way 
forward. [|

Na Vihe world seemed to have undergone a 
fundamental change. A global society was said to 
be emerging with a “new international 
humanitarian order”. The United Nations General 
Assembly adopted its earliest resolutions on 
humanitarian assistance just a few days before 
the first intervention of this kind on Soviet soil after 
the deadly tremor in Armenia. The following year 
opened a new era, with the fall of the Berlin wall, 
the rising number of pro-democracy movements 
in Africa and Security Council resolutions 
imposing the help of humanitarian organizations 
to save the Kurds of Iraq. T he end of the Cold War 
was supposed to usher in an epoch of peace and 
democracy made possible and strengthened by 
the information revolution. 
The possibility of “seeing” world events unfold 
live on television fulfilled the dream ofboth post- 
war periods. As in 1918 and in 1945, the cry 
“never again” rang out in the 1990s. But it did 
happen again. Even as international organizations 
were celebrating the advent of a world re-united, 
fascistic militias began dismembering Yugoslavia 
along ethnic lines while a racist government in 
Rwanda unleashed death squads, setting off a 
frenzy of genocidal killing. Then there were the 
deadly implosion of Somali society, civil strife in 
post-Soviet Afghanistan and the war that has 
ravaged southern Sudan for 15 years, to mention 
just a few of the most devastating conflicts. 
Could the new world order prevent these crimes 
from reoccurring—crimes against humanity which 
the international community had long thought 
banished at Nuremberg after the Second World War? 
enocide 
Rony Brauman* 
Certainly not, unless we assume that they were just 
consequences of the East-West conflict or the results 
of obscure misunderstandings. These assumptions 
ignore the central importance of local political factors. 
And yet this is precisely the illusion maintained by a 
Western conception of the world which is constantly 
presented as universal. 
This same denial of politics continued,although 
in different forms, in the crises of Bosnia and Rwanda. 
These conflicts were not a local stage for a global 
power struggle. T hey were about battling tribes driven 
by obscure ethnic impulses that seemed to date from 
another age. They were no longer represented as 
geopolitical conflicts in which peoples were held 
hostage in a rivalry that had nothing to do with them. 
Instead, they were presented by images of chaos and 
furor, in which tribes in the grip of primitive passions 
slaughter each other for enigmatic gains. 
However, this perspective forgets that the world 
wars started as fires ignited and stoked by Europe to 
the point of suicide. Other people’s wars,like those 
raging today, are always considered insane. It also 
forgets that technology, including communication 
technology, is morally neutral.In other words,it can 
be used for high-minded as well as evil purposes. 
Lastly, it also disregards the fact that while Western 
countries, and more broadly the international powers, 
cannot be held accountable for all the horrors of the 
world, they bear part of the responsibility—one that 
this metaphysical and moralizing vision conveniently 
avoids. 
We live in virtual and widespread proximity due 
to technological progress that has supposedly 
turned the world into a “global village”. Everyone 
is everyone else’s neighbour. But the possibility of 
learning about our contemporaries’ misfortunes 
astheyhappen seems to be more overwhelming than 
stimulating, probably because it insidiously 
undermines our capacity for indignation. Perhaps 
most importantly, it underscores our weakness 
all the more cruelly. We are simultaneously “giants” 
in terms of information and “dwarfs” in terms of 
action. 
The utopian dream of a world made transparent 
by technology as well as the pseudo-realism 
underlining the political actions and reasons of 
states represent two symmetrical ways of denying 
politics. We need to move beyond these two tactics 
used to retreat from the world. Every day, we must 
re-invent politics in constructing a common world 
and a forum for deliberation. This is by no means a 
recipe for overcoming destructive impulses, but the 
only way we can predict and prepare for them. It 
may also be called responsibility. NN

Globalization: 
Fifty years after the 1948 Universal Declaration, is there a 
new generation of human rights? If so, how does it relate to 
the rights enshrined half a century ago? 
he international situation in the late 1990s 
demonstrates more than ever the indivisibility 
ofall rights—economic, social,civil,political 
and cultural—in the broadest sense. We have reached 
a critical juncture where the number of rights is 
increasing while their wording and practical 
application are changing. The ideals which inspired 
the Universal Declaration may be 
devalued and the principlesit has tried 
to protect used to serve special interests 
relating to how they have emerged. For they must be 
defended without dividing up the issues and diverting 
attention from the political and social relationships 
that lead to violations. 
We can tell if we are really looking at the 
emergence of new rights or whether we are just seeing 
an updating of the 1948 Universal Declaration by 
forms studying the various 
globalization takes and current 
strategies of economic growth. More

institutions, strategies and interests Since the 1980s, 
specifically, we must focus on the new 
forms of exclusion and marginalization 
that characterize a whole chain of involved in defending them. pl anetary } . ) . Since the 1980s, the planetary | relationships from the international to 
interdependence stemming from interdependence the regional, national and grassroots 
globalization has increased debate and 
media coverage of human rights in 
many arenas. The recommendations

conceptions of globalization and 
economic growth to try and 
understand the complexity of the 
during the present decade—Rio de 
Janeiro, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing 
and Istanbul—have usually been based 
on an affirmation of rights: rights to a clean 
environment, socio-economic rights, the rights of 
women and the right to housing. 
A growing number of people and organizations are 
involved in these issues, which is helping to raise 
awareness of human rights and to spread more 
information about them in specific areas of concern. 
But these sometimes powerful, sometimes weak 
players have conflicting positions and interests and 
advocate strategies that do not always coincide. 
Interdependence does not necessarily mean 
establishing symmetrical relationships and equal 
opportunities. The various forms that globalization is 
taking and their destabilizing effects on social 
relationships may even explain the growing concern 
with human rights. 
These “new rights” are appearing in a particular 
context,which explains why there is an urgent need 
to defend them and accounts for certain problems 
current process and the emergence of 
new human rights demands. 
Most economists argue that 
globalization is the outcome of unavoidable 
adjustments to the new rules of international 
competition and to the laws of the market-place which 
supposedly ensure the optimum distribution of 
resources around the world. But globalization should 
be seen more as an eminently political process 
involving negotiations and struggles for influence 
and power engineered and institutionalized by players 
such as governments, transnational corporations and 
multilateral financial institutions. 
What is more, the globalization of financial 
markets and that of goods and services has different 
social, economic and political implications depending 
on the region. Even though they are all part of the 
same worldwide process, these different situations 
have their own special features, which must be taken 
into account when it comes to questioning human 
rights and the necessity of defending them.

with a programmed withdrawal by the state 
from certain areas such as planning, 
production and social reform and a re- 
orientation of its involvement in others, like 
redistribution,regulation and mediation.T he 
aim is to encourage special economic growth 
strategies based on the promotion of private 
interests. That has helped to undermine the 
legitimacy of states already beset by fiscal 
crisis—especially in the South, where countries 
are struggling with “structural adjustment”. 
T hat has special im plications for human rights. 
The growing politicization of the 
globalization process, and especially the 
politicization of how the crisis is managed in 
the developing countries undergoing structural 
adjustment, has led to a redefinition of the 
state’s role. But in both the North and the 
South, economic recovery based on the private sector 
involves special forms of integration with global 
markets and new relationships with transnational 
corporations. 
Domestically, reform programmes that seek to 
create a set of economic and social relationships in 
accordance with international norms of productivity, 
capital returns and competitiveness are directly or 
indirectly attacking long-held rights, 
where they exist, such as employment 
and social security benefits. T he aim

women, old people, children and the handicapped. 
Special measures were adopted in their favour, but 
without questioning the economic programmes which 
had helped to worsen their situation in the first place. 
More recently, the World Bank’s 1997 World 
Development Report’, which focuses on the 
redefinition of the state’s role, contains a chart 
showing the different functions the 
bank thinks the state should fulfill. 
The role of “ensuring social equity”

is 
for the redistribution of power—an eminently political 
matter. By presenting economic, and now institutional 
reforms from a purely technical point of view, the 
multilateral and national institutions are dodging key 
questions with regard to the control of the 
development process. Who controls it? What is their 
aim? In whose interests? It seems illusory to redefine 
measures for promoting social and economic rights, 
including the aspiration to broaden their scope, before 
the content and purpose of the growth those 
institutions recommend is made clear. 
The increasingly aggressive and multi-faceted 
intervention by multilateral and bilateral aid 
institutions in social and political matters is an attempt 
to reduce political processes to technical management. 
Those institutions and their officials say there are 
certain “non-negotiable” norms dictated by economic 
theory alone. The result is an attempt to take politics 
out of the process, denying the legitimacy of political 
goals. That is the context in which human rights must 
now be placed and in which the growing role of 
transnational companies—with their freedom of 
action, influence on public policy-making and thus 
their power—can be understood. 
But the social,political and economic impact of 
outside players varies depending on many factors, 
including domestic political situations. They range 
from a state of law in which legally-recognized bodies 
may publicly challenge rules about basic employment, 
health and environmental standards, to countries 
where state structures have been weakened, their 
legitimacy undermined,and where there are few, if 
any, fora for public discussion. 
In this context the major transnational 
corporations, especially those that sell consumer goods 
in wealthy countries,have been busy promoting the 
establishment of codes of conduct or ethics to avoid the 
kind of boycotts that have occurred in Europe and 
the United States. But most codes, when they exist, 
have major loopholes, including a lack of means to 
enforce them, of effective oversight and of sanctions in 
the event of violations. Consequently, the adoption 
of such codes can actually be a smokescreen for human 
rights abuses by large corporations. 
At the same time, the process of globalization and 
the questions raised about the state’s role in 
redistributing resources, along with its withdrawal 
from many areas of political and social responsibility, 
has underscored the emergence of new players making 
their voices heard for the first time. They are 
mobilizing and organizing to demand new rights in 
new ways, including rights for the homeless, young 
people, the elderly and the handicapped, the right to 
breath clean air, to drink uncontaminated water and 
to eat food that is not poisoned by pesticides. In some

North American cities, car windscreen washers have

In many respects,these demands update several 
articles in the 1948 Universal Declaration.Some of 
them—the right to access personal data, to a healthy 
life without genetic engineering and to a clean 
environment—reflect technological and scientific 
advances. But again, the question

those rights or the endorsement of a new and unjust

interests, methods and strategies in the name of human

of the power needed to defend them. u

### 113625: Pandora's box

Pandora’s box 
  
Eo agrees that the 1948 Universal 
eclaration of Human Rights isa sacred cow and 
no one would dream— officially, at least— of replacing 
it with a new version that is more in step with the 
times But the semblance of agreement on a founding 
text does not by any stretch of the imagination mean 
it meets with unanimous acceptance. On the contrary, 
the Declaration has come under fierce attack, and 
the criticisms have become more pointed in the past 
few years As if to relativize the document’s value, 
several regions of the world have drawn up human 
rights charters based on their own principles which 
do not appear in the United Nations text. The African 
Charter on Human and People’s Rights and the Islamic 
Charter of Human Rights reflect a conception of 
human rights espoused by leaders of countries in 
those regionsand by at least some of the people who 
live in them. 
Between the United Nations human rights 
conferencesin Teheran in 1968 and Vienna in 1993, 
aswell asin other international fora, the organization's 
Declaration came under fierce criticism. At times some 
have even publicly asked whether the 1948 document 
could be “touched up” since it cannot be replaced 
altogether. They argue in favour of including the 
concerns of cultures overlooked by the text’s original 
authors, blinded as they were by a Western world 
view. It would be the height of irony if the 1948 
Declaration were made universal at last by taking 
into account specific cutural features of individual 
countries. 
Two sides soon confronted each other. The 
advocates of universality, who consider it dangerous 
to renegotiate the Declaration, have clashed with 
those who would introduce clauses relating to their 
specific cultures, some of which have only a distant 
kinship with respect for rights of the individual. The 
stand-off came to a head in the first half of the 
nineties. In Vienna and elsewhere, several Asian 
countries that challenged the Declaration’s universal 
character in the name of Asian values joined forces 
with the most conservative Muslim states to oppose 
the West's efforts to have the document accepted as 
universal. 
Each side actually used human rights to justify its own 
political transgressions The West has invoked them to 
officially carry out international police operations since 
the end of the Cold War, while the opposing camp 
casually violated them for the sake of “ values” that 
are often their negation. Such instrumentalization has 
hardly served the cause of human rights. But it has 
driven home the point that a discussion on updating the 
Declaration would open up a Pandora’sbox of unknown 
demons. The most recent international texts 
acknowledge the legitmacy of “ cultural and religious 
specificity” , often to the great displeasure of many 
human rights groups. However, the universal character 
of individual rights has been solemnly upheld. 
The relative lull in the confrontation between 
advocates of universality and partisans of cultural 
relativism is cause for celebration but, regrettably, 
political exploitation of the human rights issue has 
overshadowed the real debate. Many activists, in the 
North and the South, believe it would be useful to 
consolidate human rightsby involving all the world’s 
cultures in legitimizing them. By exploring all the 
various facets of human rights, a common vision 
might emerge of the human condition and the 
necessary respect it is due that would bring peoples 
together instead of drive them apart. That is the 
foundation, those advocates argue, on which to build 
the universal human rights of tomorrow. nu

Tightening the bolts on economic and social rights. 
As the gap between rich and poor widens, the 
have-nots are demanding more respect for 
economic and social rights, which are often 
given short shrift 
he international community must treat 
human rights globally in a fair and equal 
manner, on the same footing and with the 
same emphasis.” The June 1993 United N ations World 
Conference in Vienna added one more resolution to the 
long list adopted over the years when 


### 113626: Poor relations

Poor relations 
and Cultural Rights stipulates that “each State... 
undertakes to take steps... to the maximum of its 
available resources, with a view to achieving progressively 
the full realization of the rights recognized....” 
Governments, especially in the developing world, often 
take advantage of the ambiguous wording to justify 
their non-observance of the treaty, says Philippe Texier, 
the French expert on the United Nations Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights set up in 
1985. Most countries ignore it, he adds. 
Texier, a legal expert, recommends an optional 
protocol that,like the one on political rights, would 
empower the committee to review complaints from 
individuals or groups. But he admits that “respect 
for political rights,such as a ban on torture,is easier 
to verify than, for example, respect for the right to 
be decently housed.” 
Committee chairman Philip Alston of Australia 
says, “it is essential that such a procedure be created 
in order to provide the opportunity for the 
development of some jurisprudence relating to 
economic, social and cultural rights. In the continuing 
absence of such jurisprudence, the second-class status 
of those rights will inevitably be maintained.” 
Maribel Wolf, the United Nations representative 
of the French non-governmental organization Terre des 
Hommes, says that “the purpose of being able to 
process such complaints is not so much to possibly 
impose sanctions but to have the opportunity to 
publicly expose violations of economic rights.” 
“Governments don’t like that,” she says, and indeed 
they seem to show scant interest in the proposal. So far 
only six countries have responded to the draft protocol 
produced by the committee. Four 
it reminded the signatory states of 
the Universal Declaration of their 
duty to guarantee economic, social 
and cultural rights—food, shelter, 
work, health and education—just as 
much as civil and political rights— 
freedom, security and justice. The 
‘It is the job of civil 
society to defend 
economic and 
social rights’ 
of them—Cyprus, Syria, Finland 
and Ecuador—are fairly or very 
much in favour, while two— 
Germany and Canada—have 
expressed doubts. 
“Since the governments of the rich 
countries have abdicated their 
initiative was critical because economic, social and 
cultural rights have always been sidelined for historical 
and ideological reasons. 
In the 1950s the debate raged over drafting a 
covenant that would give the Declaration legal force. 
René Cassin of France favoured a single document, 
but the Western and Communist blocs were opposed. 
TheWestern countries emphasized political rights while 
the Eastern bloc, backed by several developing nations, 
gave priority to economic rights. 
A compromise was reached in 1966, when two 
covenants were drawn up—one on civil and political 
rights, to go into effect immediately, another on 
economic, social and cultural rights, which would 
gradually enter into force and has so far been ratified 
by 137 countries. 
T he International Covenant on Economic, Social 
responsibilities and hidden behind the excuse of the 
market economy, and elites in the developing 
countries refuse to redistribute wealth, it’s the job of 
civil society to defend these rights,” says Wolf. 
She is cheered by Amnesty Internationals recent 
though small shift in that direction. Untilnow the human 
rights watchdog has primarily focused on individual 
freedoms. Weary of feeling “looked down upon” by 
political rights experts, Wolf claims the label “human 
rights activist” just as strongly as they do. 
“We must stop thinking of political rights as an 
entitlement while economic and social rights are a 
mere premise or a utopian dream,” says Colombian 
lawyer and human rights expert Alirio Uribe Munoz. 
The fate of every individual's economic, social and 
cultural rights depends on it. L

Bm Who will bring casesto the ICC and how will the 
prosecutor initiate investigations? 
W.P.: Investigations can be initiated by state party 
complaints,by referrals from the Security Council, 
and by the ICC prosecutor, who would be able to 
initiate a criminal investigation subject to appropriate 
judicial scrutiny. Testaments from victims could be the 
qualifications,representation of the world’s major legal 
systems, and equitable geographical representation 
are all mandated in the treaty. 
Bm There isa possibility that countries which have 
signed the treaty can refuse to accept the war crimes 
clause for seven years. Do you think thisis a serious 
limitation to the treaty? 
W. P.:1 believe very few countries will opt out for 
the seven years. In the long run—no—this is not a 
serious limitation to the treaty—presuming this 
exception is not changed or extended by the 
Conference of States Parties to the statute. 
HB What role can NGOs and pro-ICC human rights 
groups play in their own countries and in nations 
which have not signed the treaty? 
W. P.: Our roles will be to continue to fight for 
peace and international justice. Our focus at the 
national level will be to work more closely with 
parliamentarians,national bar associations and others 
to advance the ratification process. Over time as the 
ICC comes into being our efforts will be to support 
the court and to monitor violations of international 
humanitarian law wherever they occur, to provide »

In the rough stages 
espitethe long list of difficulties facing the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the 
formerYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), there is 
no denying their critical role in laying the 
groundwork for the ICG 
“There is an ethical dimension to bringing 
justice tothe vi tims and to fulfilling a duty to the 
collective memory,” said Claude Jorda, a French 
judge on the ICTY, in a public discussion on the 
tribunal’s importance, which equally applies to 
the ICTR. Established by the United Nations 
Security Council in 1993 and 1994 respectively, 
the tribunals prosecute serious violations of 
international humanitarian law. 
Based in The Hague (The Netherlands),the 
ICTY indicted 59 individuals, and 27 were in 
custody asof August 1998. Two men have been 
26 of them along with five suspects, as of 
September 1998. The accused include Jean 
Kambanda,prime minister of Rwanda during 
the genocide, along with senior government 
officials, media and business leaders Located 
in Arusha (Tanzania), the tribunal handed down 
the first judgement on crime of genocide in 
September. 
A lack of financial means, experience and 
international support partially explains the 
tribunals’ weaknesses and the slow place of 
trials, particularly in Rwanda. Yet as many point 
out, the courts are like laboratories offering 
essential but painful lessons such asthe need to 
adequately involve victims. Most importantly, 
these tribunals cannot prevent war crimes as 
seen with the Srebenica massacres of 1994, 
committed one year after the ICTY began its 
sentenced to five and 20 years of imprisonment. 
The ICTR has indicted 35 men and detained   work. [|

information,research and assistance to victims,and 
to demand that national courts and the ICC 
investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes 
against humanity. 
Bm During the negotiations, some countries expressed 
apprehensions that the ICC may undermine national 
sovereignty. What do you think about this? 
W. P.: A fundamental principle enshrined in the 
ICC statute is complementarity. The new court will 
not replace, but will complement national courts and 
legal systems which will remain primarily responsible. 
Also, extraordinary judicial and procedural 
safeguards—more than NGOs would have liked— 
have been built into the statute. They protect national 
sovereignty and guarantee against any kind of frivolous 
prosecution. 
® Do you think the United States, which voted 
against the treaty will try to sabotage it? 
W.P.: It is a great danger and it would be a great 
tragedy if the United States were to adopt policies 
and laws to sabotage the ICC. Most experts and 
diplomats hope that the US will support the ICC 
once US leaders better understand the adopted 
 
statute, see what a great new instrument of 
international justice the ICC will be for the Security 
Council and the world community, and realize how 
nations with functioning civil and military legal 
systems which investigate alleged crimes against 
humanity committed by their nationals have nothing 
to fear from the ICC. 
Bm |sthere any possibility of countries which voted 
against the establishment of the ICC, signing the 
treaty in future? 
W. P.: Of course there is. South Africa played an 
indispensable leadership role in this historic treaty 
and five years ago South Africa was still a pariah 
nation. Scores of nations from Eastern Europe, Africa 
and Latin America which were ruled by brutal political 
and military regimes in the recent past provided 
essential support and leadership in Rome. The 
integrity and determination of these nations, in 
particular those of sub-Saharan Africa, in rejecting 
great pressures from France, and the US and other 
countries to sell out the ICC, is a remarkable story of 
political courage. 
Bm During the negotiations India said the use of 
nuclear weapons should be considered a war crime. 
What do you think about this? 
W. P.: The list of tantalizing proposals made by 
India and some other countries was irresistible, and 
it seemed impossible that nations would reject them. 
But governments knew that India’s goal was not to 
outlaw nuclear weapons but to wreck the ICC treaty. 
The nuclear powers heard the shot across their 
bows in Rome, and this issue will come up at every 
review conference of the ICC. But it may be even more 
important to understand that, as the International 
Court of Justice stated in 1996 in its advisory opinion 
on the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, it is 
nearly impossible for nations to use nuclear or other 
weapons of mass destruction without committing 
crimes against humanity as they are defined. 
Bm How would you react to the apprehensions of 
certain countries that excesses by their military 
forces during peacekeeping missions could also be 
subjected to prosecution by the ICC? 
W.P.: The overwhelming majority of nations which 
contribute peacekeeping troops did not share the 
concerns about this issue expressed by France and the 
US. First, most of us expressed outrage that any 
government would argue that peacekeeping troops 
should be allowed to commit war crimes or crimes 
against humanity with impunity or else they might not 
agree to participate in these operations. Second ,again, 
national military tribunals would have primary 
jurisdiction. Thus,apprehension about the problem 
of “excesses” is not that serious. 
Bm When ICC becomes fully operational,do you 
think it will become a supranational body and 
interfere with the Security Council’s work? 
W. P.: The danger is that the Security Council will 
interfere with the ICC, not the other way around. What 
has been done is to adopt a statute creating a court to 
enforce violations of the Geneva Conventions on the

## [Page 31](113615eng.pdf#page=31) 0

### 113627: A Decisive victory

Laws of War and the Genocide Convention of 1948. 
One can only say that the new world court will be 
supranational to the extent that these laws and the ICC 
statute are universally ratified and are customary 
international law, and that the ICC’s universal 
jurisdiction is supported by the Security Council. In 
fact, the ICC complements national jurisdiction so the 
answer 1s that it will be a mixture—sometimes 
international, sometimes, when activated by the Security 
Council,supranational. 
It certainly will not interfere with, but assist the 
Security Council. One of the controversial provisions 
allows the Council to delay or suspend a matter before 
the court for twelve months if the pursuit of 
international justice and the maintenance of 
international peace and security come into conflict. 
BW If the Security Council blocks a case against a 
country or a group for one year and keepsrenewing it 
every year, will this affect the credibility of the ICC? 
W. P.: Yes, but it will undermine the credibility 
and authority of the Security Council even more. 
I know it is heresy amongst NGOs for me to say so, 
but I believe the Singapore-Canada formulation * is 
one of the most important achievements of the ICC 
treaty. I believe there may be times when a serious 
legal and political conflict could arise between the 
ICC and the Security Council warranting a temporary 
suspension. I believe that the human rights NGOs 
greatly underestimate the difficulty in getting all the 
five permanent members and two-thirds of the elected 
members of the Security Council to adopt such a 
resolution,much less renew it. 
HB Any closing thoughts? 
W. P.: We have much work before us. With the 
achievement ofthe ICC statute we have demonstrated 
another example of the extraordinary development of 
the “new diplomacy” characteristic of the post-C old- 
War period which offers the hope of better global 
governance in the next century. Too much of history is 
the story of wars won and peace lost. T his summer in 
Rome peace won and war lost. L

hile the universality of human rights is 
increasingly challenged, a growing 
number of activists is formally rejecting 
any attempt to water down the principle with claims 
of cultural relativism. T he battle for human rights 
has become universal. 
“The United Nations conference in Vienna in 
June 1993 shed light on a movement that had been 
gathering momentum since the late 1980s and 
confirmed the emergence of local players,” says 
Antoine Bernard, executive director of the 
International Federation of Human Rights, whose 
membership rose from 66 in 1991 to 105 in 1997. 
The gatherings held by non-governmental 
organizations (NGO) on the fringes of five United 
Nations conferences between 1992 and 1995 brought 
to light another major trend: the proliferation of 
  
women’s movements. T hey argue that women account 
for half the world’s population and must have the 
same rights as men. T heir priority is fighting the 
discrimination and violence women endure 
everywhere in the world. So the community of human 
rights activists has integrated new, previously 
marginalized players at the same time that the 
movement has become global. 
In Africa, Latin America, Europe and, most 
recently, Asia, the collapse or weakening of repressive 
regimes has been fertile ground for a new crop of 
human rights organizations. At first they were national 
human rights groups and local branches of Amnesty 
International. Today they are more than just offshoots 
of large organizations based in the countries of the 
North. An often impressive number of home-grown 
groups has taken up where international organizations »

left off as economic and social changes spawn the 
need for new forms of solidarity. 
Ayo Obe,the Nigerian chairwoman of the Civil 
Liberties Organisation, says foreign aid and cash 
helped launch such groups. But today activists, many 
of them volunteers, are legion. Their primary 
objectives are to “improve society,” to make up for the 
lack of government action and to fight discrimination, 
damage to the environment and state-inspired 
violence. Those goals are shared by most African 
countries which have seen the most spectacular 
growth of human rights organizations. 
Previously underground and exiled activists laid 
the groundwork for the proliferation of human rights 
groups in the late 1980s. “The human rights movement 
in Latin America was already quite advanced before 
the dictatorships fell, but it was politically confrontational 
and centred on large organizations,” says Bernard. 
“Today groups are highly diverse and do a lot of in- 
depth work, especially to raise awareness of the law.” 
In the former communist countries, the human 
rights movement has also grown by leaps and bounds 
since the Berlin wall fell in 1989. “As soon as the Soviet 
empire showed the first evident signs of collapse, 
numerous NGOs sprang up all over the USSR,” says 
Boris Pustintsev, chairman of Citizens Watch. 
While the first generation of human rights groups 
“resisted government’s attempts to curb the 
democratization process,” says Pustintsev, the second 
wave has focused mainly on limiting the damage caused 
by the ensuing social crisis. In Eastern 
  
  
must move ahead by trial and error. In North Africa 
they started out by imitating the European model. But 
today, says Moroccan historian Driss el- Yazami, the 
movement has “a historically new mission: to limit the 
clashes between Islamic fundamentalists and the state.” 
He says that members of human rights groups, women’s 
rights activists and journalists who side with the 
authorities in the fight against religious fundamentalism 
are missing the chance to establish unquestionable 
legitimacy in their societies. To achieve that goal, he says, 
“they must try to play the role of pacifiers and 
mediators.” 
Europe, as yesterday’s dissidents moved 
into positions of power, civil society was 
left without its best defenders. Grassroots 
initiatives did not pick up again until two 
or three years ago.T he still-fragile groups 
concentrate on burning issues such as 
the defence of minorities. 
The human 
rights movement 
still has a long 
way to go 
The upheavals of the 1990s have 
affected the countries of the North as 
well. Older organizations have 
struggled for a new lease of life while a 
new, younger and more aggressive 
form of activism has appeared. 
The battle for human rights came later to Asia, 
where dictatorships die harder. Asian activists took 
advantage of the opportunities opened up by the 
transition to democracy, especially in the Philippines 
in 1986 and South Korea in 1987. Since then they 
have stepped up their efforts. They are highly 
organized, use state-of-the-art communication 
technology and have formed regional federations. 
One of their priorities is the dismantling of the 
“national security” laws which governments use to 
justify their cruellest acts of violence. 
The human rights movement may be global and 
relatively well-organized, but it still has a long way 
to go. Every day, activists must cope with a lack of 
skill and funding as well as with repression that is 
increasingly multi-faceted. They must also learn how 
to co-operate with the authorities while maintaining 
a critical distance from them. 
The Russian government may be weak and 
unreliable, but it has taken several steps in the right 
direction, says Pustintsev. Independent NGOs must 
help and advise the government and act as a link to 
ordinary citizens. “But it’shard to play thisnewrole,” 
Pustintsev says, because the government’s old reflex of 
taking control of any initiative by civil society is still 
alive and well. 
Faced with new problems, human rights activists

As inequality has increased, 
“radical activity has moved to the social arena,” says 
Martine Bartélémy, an expert on NGOs at France's 
National Political Science Foundation.British lawyer 
Michael Ellman adds that NGOs are becoming highly 
specialized and increasingly resorting to direct action. 
He cites organizations defending the rights of women, 
homosexuals, children and the homeless. “People are 
no longer taking action because they have some overall 
project to change society,” says Bartélémy, “but 
because they have a specific goal and want to achieve 
it immediately.” 
Non-governmental organizations are highly diverse 
but moving in the same direction. North and South, 
economic and social issues are taking precedence. 
Even human rights groups are campaigning against 
social exclusion. “Our biggest need is to make the 
connection between civil and political rights and 
economic and social rights,” says Jaribu Hills, US co-

are a universal ideal. Now they want to prove that 
they are indivisible. LJ

orking women in South Korea have never 
enjoyed the same rights as their male 
counterparts. In the 1960s, when men 
were struggling for improved working conditions and 
higher wages, women were busy defending their basic 
human rights. 
South Korea’s population of 45 million includes 
22 million in the work force, of whom nearly nine 
million are women. Yet the country’s male trade union 
leaders rarely think of the specific problems of women 
in the workplace.What’s more, men are reluctant to 
acknowledge the important contribution women 
make in the struggle to improve working conditions. 
Founded in 1992, the Korean Women Workers 
Association United (KWWAU) is a network of six 
regional women’s organizations. Its main task is to 
educate and organize women and to develop 
campaigns and policies designed to improve mother- 
and-child health care and to ensure equality and 
stability in labour contracts and on-the-job training. 
One of the services offered is the “Equality Line” 
counselling centre, which advises women on how to 
deal with occupational problems and unfair 
treatment. Of all the women who called on this service 
last year, 56.6 per cent complained of delays in being 
paid, job insecurity and unwarranted dismissal, while 
14.6 per cent reported cases of sexual harassment and 
violence at the workplace. Some 13.7 per cent said 
that working conditions failed to take their role as 
mothers into account. Sexual discrimination 
accounted for 8.7 per cent of all complaints and 
work-related ailments amounted to 6.4 per cent. 
In addition to these counselling services,Equality 
Line also organizes conferences and educational 
programmes. The group has recently published a 
book containing a list of all the cases it handled from 
September 1996 to August 1997, with the aim of 
acquainting other women workers with the most 
commonly encountered labour problems and ways of 
dealing with them. 
KWWAU is run by a team of six graduate 
professionals with several years’ experience in 
organizations concerned with the legal rights of female 
workers. Its activities include investigating work 
situations where women are unfairly treated, 
questioning government policies which do not provide 
for the rights of working women,organizing forums 
and setting up action plans to promote awareness 
among regional groups and other associations working 
to ensure that women have a fair deal on the labour 
market. 
The organization’s budget for the current year is 
some $90,000.The bulk of that amount comes from 
members’contributions and from assistance provided 
by other national and international organizations. A

The activities of KWWAU are starting to have a 
perceptible impact. Following several meetings 
between the group’s regional chapters and the 
country’s trade unions, an agreement was reached 
to build day-care centres near workplaces. In 1993 a 
collective convention was signed to open day-care 
centres hospitals,banks and businesses. N

### 113630: To live with dignity in the United Kingdom

To live with dignity 
in the United Kingdom 
hile most people in the United Kingdom 
enjoy an adequate if not high standard of 
living, many do not have a decent place 
to live—or anywhere at all. 
Though suffering from mental illness, Gordon 
(not his real name) is responsible for looking after 
his three-year old daughter. They lived in a damp, 
cold, run-down rented room riddled with woodworm. 
Their lives changed when the local social services 
agency turned for help to Shelter, a British non- 
governmental organization that defends the right to 
housing. The group negotiated with 
social services to have Gordon

million. T he bulk of the funds comes from individual 
donations,private companies, schools and religious 
groups. Shelter also raises moneyby conducting used 
clothes drives and runs a network of shops that sells 
the group’s publications and garments bearing its 
logo. 
Homelessness undermines the dignity of the 
individual, but Shelter points out that it also entails 
considerable social and financial costs. On the basis 
of statistical evidence, the organization repeatedly 
says that the life expectancy of a person 
living on the streets is 42, compared

home. 
Shelter estimates that an average 
of 470 families lose their homes in the 
United Kingdom every day, finding 
Every day, 470 
families in the 
United Kingdom 
become homeless 
with the national average of 74 for men 
and 79 for women. 
Mindful that a roof is not the be- 
all and end-all, Shelter is also interested 
in people who have homes but live in 
poor conditions. Carrie, a 10-year-old 
themselves forced to wander the streets 
in search of somewhere to live, if only temporarily. In 
March 1998, at least one million people were living 
in these appalling conditions. 
Chris Holmes, the director of Shelter, the largest 
non-governmental organization of its kind in the 
country, said it “exists for people facing these kinds 
of situations. In our view, everybody in society is 
entitled to enjoy a proper, decent and safe home.” 
Since 1996, Shelter has been working to help and 
support anyone living in dread ful conditions or on the 
streets. 
Shelter assists people in distress free of charge 
through a network of 52 centres spread out over 
almost the entire country. It also organizes frequent 
campaigns to pressure the authorities into changing 
the law and coming up with practical and financially 
viable solutions. The group’s 900 volunteers 
participate in specific projects, field missions, 
information processing and administrative work. 
The results are plain to see. Holmes says, “through 
our action in 1997, 100,000 families and individuals 
were given advice and assistance and, in other cases, 
were saved from eviction.” The different centres 
provide services ranging from informing people of 
their rights to accompanying families when they move 
into their new homes.

apartment with her parents and baby sister. Her 
mother and father purchased the room before Carrie 
was born.When they wanted to move to something 
bigger, housing prices had increased so much they 
could not rent or buy anything else. Carrie suffers 
from serious asthma and has nowhere to play or do her 
homework, which is affecting her performance at 
school. Her mother says, “There is just nowhere to put 
anything. I am seeing a doctor for stress. I feel 
constantly stressed out and that all I want to do is 
murder somebody.” 
Human tragedies like these inspired Shelter’s 
latest campaign, “Behind Closed Doors”, which was 
launched last March. The goal was to highlight the 
seriousness of such situations and raise the authorities’ 
awareness,thus encouraging them to treat cases like 
Carrie’s as priorities. Louise Casey, the deputy director 
of Shelter, says, “a house is not a home if it is 
dangerous and unhealthy and makes life a misery. 
Having a roof over your head does not mean you have 
somewhere decent to live, and it should certainly not 
disqualify people from getting help.” u

X it possible when a handful of non-governmental 
NWorganizations (NG Os) came together in 1992 
to take landmines out of the world’s arsenals. Because 
the lowly landmine has been in widespread use by 
most fighting forces in the world throughout this 
century, the possibility of banning the weapon looked 
far from achievable.H owever, the situation changed 
dramatically in five years. “The campaign started a 
process which in the 
space of a few years 
changed a ban on 
antipersonnel mines 
from a vision to a feasible 
reality,” explained the 
committee awarding the 
1997 Nobel Prize for 
Peace to the 
International Campaign 
to Ban Landmines 
(ICBL). 
The ICBL made 
wishful thinking a reality when 121 governments 
came to Ottawa,Canada in December 1997 to sign 
the Mine BanTreaty (MBT).The numbers continue 
to grow as does the momentum towards a total 
elimination of landmines. The Nobel Committee 
concluded that “as a model for similar processes in the 
future, the campaign could prove of decisive 
importance to the international effort for disarmament 
and peace.” 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, NGOs began to 
seriously think about trying to deal with a global 
humanitarian crisis—the tens of millions of landmines 
claiming hundreds of lives every year all over the world. 
It became very clear that to eliminate the problem, it 
would be necessary to eliminate the weapon—to ban 
the production and use of land mines. 
In October 1992, Handicap International, Human 
Rights Watch, Medico International, Mines Advisory 
Group, Physicians for Human Rights and Vietnam 
Veterans of America Foundation formally launched 
the ICBL with a “joint call to ban antipersonnel 
landmines.” These organizations,which became the 
steering committee of the ICBL, called for an end to 
the use,production,trade and stockpiling of mines. 
The call also pressed governments to increase 
resources for humanitarian mine clearance and for

victim assistance. 
The international campaign has become an 
unprecedented coalition of over 1,000 organizations 
working together in 60 countries to achieve a ban. 
And as the campaign grew, the steering committee 
expanded to represent its diversity. The Afghan and 
Cambodian campaigns and Radda Barnen were 
added in 1996; the South African campaign and 
Kenya Coalition in 1997; and the Association to Aid 
Refugees, Japan, Lutheran World Federation, the 
Colombia Campaign Against Landmines, Inter 
African Union of Human Rights and Norwegian 
People’s Aid joined early this year. 
The core strength of the campaign, has always 
been its loose structure. There has never been a central 
secretariat or headquarters. T here has never been an 
overreaching, bureaucratic structure. ICBL members 
always meet regularly to plot out overall strategies 
and plan joint actions, but beyond that each NGO and 
each national campaign is free to develop its own 
work best suited to its mandate, culture and 
circumstances. 
T he overall strategy of the international campaign 
has always been to press for national, regional and 
international measures to ban landmines. Initially an 
attempt was made to persuade the nations to review 
the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons 
(CCW), which attempted to control the use of 
antipersonnel mines and to ban the weapon by 
amending the convention. While the revised CCW 
did not ban them, pressure by the ICBL made many 
governments take the issue seriously. 
During the last phase of the CCW review, the 
campaign called on individual governments to come 
together in a pro-ban group. A series of meetings 
between pro-ban governments and the ICBL was held 
in Geneva during the final sessions of the review 
conference. After the conference in May 1996, the 
Canadian government offered to host a governmental 
meeting in October. The hectic negotiations in the 
subsequent months paved the way for the historic 
December 1997 meeting in Ottawa for the Mine Ban 
Treaty. 
At the time of writing, twenty-eight states—more 
than half the number necessary for entry into force— 
have deposited their instruments of ratification at the 
United Nations. Six other governments have finalized 
and just have to deposit the ratification. 
The ICBL, and its partnership with governments, 
has launched a truly remarkable and historic process. 
It has clearly demonstrated that civil society and 
governments do not have to see themselves as 
adversaries. It also shows that small and middle powers 
can work together with civil society and address 
humanitarian concerns with breathtaking speed. =

### 113632: Keeping up with science

Keeping up with 
science 
“Science, by itself, cannot supply us with an 
ethic. It can show us how to achieve a given 
end, and it may show us that some ends 
cannot be achieved. But among ends that can 
be achieved our choice must be decided by 
other than purely scientific considerations.” 
  
* Health Law Institute, 
University of Alberta,Canada 
36 The Unesco Courier - October 1998 
Bertrand Russell, 1950 
ertrand Russell’s caution on the ethic of 
science is more pertinent today than ever 
before. But we still seem far from developing 
an effective human rights framework to guide the 
choices we, asa world community, make about the use 
of emerging technologies. T he sheer momentum of 
science,spurred on by the commercial entities funding 
research,continues to dominate our decisions. Can 
human rights instruments give us the direction we 
need? Perhaps not. 
The response of legislators to the ongoing “genetic 
revolution” illustrates the shortcomings of current 
regulatory approaches. The Human Genome Project, 
an international effort to sequence and map all the 
human genes, is probably the most scrutinized scientific 
endeavour in history. Most of the participating nations 
have set aside part of their science budgets to address 
the ethical, legal and social issues involved. Yet this 
analysis has resulted in only a few formal genetic policies 
with any real legal teeth. 
Domestic law has always struggled to keep pace 
with the advance of technology. The problems are 
amplified in the arena of international human rights 
law with its plurality of cultures, beliefs and values. 
Only the most basic principles are likely to survive the 
polarized debates. As exemplified by the UNESCO 
Declaration on the Protection of the Human Genome, 
the substance of many of the final documents seems 
to hinge on the interpretation of amorphous terms like 
“human dignity”. 
There are also more specific reasons why it is 
difficult to create effective human rights “rules” 
including:the daunting task of writing scientifically 
meaningful regulations and the fact that the social 
norms which compel the implementation of 
safeguards evolve almost as quickly as the technology 
(consider in vitro fertilization). 
The regulatory issues raised by Dolly, the first 
cloned mammal, highlight these challenges. For 
example, a number of the pre-Dolly laws prohibiting 
Timothy Caulfield” 
human cloning, such as Great Britain’s, addressed 
embryo splitting technology. As a result, a rigid 
application of such provisions would miss the nuclear 
transfer technique used to create Dolly. 
More importantly, Dolly highlights the need for 
meticulous policy analysis. Unfortunately, an ill- 
informed polemic seems to drive far too much of the 
“biopolicy”’dialogue. One could argue that both the 
eugenic laws of the early twentieth century and the 
recent commentary on human cloning are based on an 
inaccurate view of genetic determinism. T hat is an 
ironic conclusion, since state-imposed eugenic policies 
obviously offend human dignity while cloning 
regulations explicitly seek to protect it. Nevertheless, 
if one scrutinizes the proposals to ban human cloning 
it is difficult to find a satisfactory critique of this paradox. 
A worrisome trend given that a deterministic ethos is 
arguably more threatening to human dignity than an 
undeveloped cloning technology. 
But let us consider a possibly more troubling 
controversy. Many have argued that the marriage 
between commerce and human genetics will usher in 
an era of laissez faire eugenics in which the social 
definitions of disease, disability and normalcy are 
dictated by market forces. 
How can traditional human rights instruments 
address such a concern? It may be impossible. First, 
the commercialization of genetics is part of a growing, 
multi-billion dollar industry viewed by many 
governments as a vital part of the economy. 
Second, because the notion of autonomy remains 
a fundamental human right, any policy seen as 
curtailing the ability to choose will meet resistance. 
Furthermore, in many Western countries individual 
freedom is indistinguishable from a perceived right to 
be an unrestrained consumer. In health care, 
autonomy has metamorphosed from a right to 
determine what is done to your body into a right of 
access. State imposed eugenic policies are relatively 
easy to condemn, but how do you get at the aggregate 
effect of consumer decisions? 
Finally, the subtle attitudinal changes associated 
with the genetic revolution are the result of social 
forces, not state policies. As such they may easily pass 
unnoticed. 
Though I am not a “Luddite,” some form of social 
control isneeded. However,many concerns associated 
with the genetic revolution maybe beyond the reach 
of human rights instruments. T he genetech industry 
will be propelled forward by social forces imbedded 
in the fabric of Western culture. It seems certain that 
the cumulative pressure of these forces will prove too 
much for the most sharply crafted declaration. ®

or punishment? Philippe Bordes” 
Should drugs be tolerated, legalized or prohibited? The debate takes on 
new proportions with the growing use of illicit substances 
he war on drugs is a failure.D eclared 
by the United States in 1983 and 
taken up by the international 
community in 1989, the objective was to cut 
off the consumer countries of the North from 
the producers of illicit drugs in the South, 
which are the targets of an increasingly 
expensive crackdown. The United States 
alone increased funding for this war from 
$4.7 billion in 1988 to $12.3 billion in 1993. 
Yet the participants in the United Nations 
General Assembly Special Session on the 
World Drug Problem, which took place in 
NewYork from 8 to 10 June 1998, came to the 
conclusion that never before have such vast 
amounts of illicit substances been on the 
market at such low prices, which are reliable 
indicators of overproduction. Repression that 
focuses exclusively on supply—cultivation, 
production and trafficking—is a continuation 
of a Cold War mind-set that viewed the world 
as divided into “good guys” and “bad guys”. 
The blatant failure of that approach has led 
to the search for new strategies. Nowadays 
everyone more or less agrees that drug users 
are at the heart of the problem, but solutions 
remain to be found. 
The special session in New York was an 
opportunity for renewed debate between 
advocates of prohibition and supporters of 
liberalization. Such discussions among 
experts are often difficult for the public at 
large to fathom, especially because of the 
confusion between the two major concepts 
involved:decriminalization of drug use and 
legalization of drugs themselves. 
The three United Nations conventions on 
narcotics, which provide a framework for the 
international prohibition system, leave room 
for interpretation. The authors of these accords 
have always contended that, unlike measures 
that target drug supply, steps to curb drug 
consumption—designated by the term

“use”—fall within the sovereignty of each 
member state. The 1997 World Drug Report 
produced by the United Nations Drug Control 
Programme (UND CP) stated that, “None of 
the Conventions requires a party to convict 
or punish those who commit such offences 
[acquiring, possessing or consuming drugs], 
even when they have been established as 
punishable; alternative measures may also 
substitute for criminal prosecution.” In line 
with this, signatory countries to the convention 
have developed a wide array of responses to 
druguse. In some countries of the European 
Union such as France and Luxembourg, for 
example,personal druguse is against the law, 
while others, such as Spain, only prosecute 
druguse in public places and possession with 
intent to sell. Drug abuse or addiction should 
increasingly be dealt with not by putting users 
behind bars but by court-ordered rehabilitation 
(what might be called a therapeutic injunction) 
within the framework of treatment 
programmes. But major differences persist 
between drug rehabilitation systems. At the 
same time, law enforcement officials 
overwhelmed by the scope and increasing 
sophistication of drug trafficking are often 
tempted to crack down on casual users in order 
to achieve tangible results, thus filling prisons 
without disrupting the illicit trade. 
This is the context in which the advocates 
ofdecriminalization are increasingly making 
their voices heard. They recommend 
legalizing, instead of prosecuting, the 
possession of small

the words of Dutch specialist Henk Jan Van 
Vliet, “the final objective in a hierarchy of 
objectives.” The highest priority is to implement 
a policy that would help users kick the habit 
when they decided to, not just when a judge 
ordered them to. Such an approach, supporters 
argue, would minimize the marginalization 
and health hazards stemming from drug taking. 
The emergence of Aids and the spread of HIV 
infection among heroin addicts, who inject the 
drug, is a major argument in favour of this 
approach.Many governments with repressive 
policies have been compelled to allow over- 
the-counter sales of needle kits before setting 
up drug substitution 
amounts of drugs 
intended for personal 
use. The idea is gaining 
ground in the European 
Union, but in the rest of 
the world the trend is

programmes. Switzerland 
and the Netherlands are 
even experimenting with 
the distribution of heroin 
itself, as a way of keeping 
adulterated and dubious 
towards a harder line on 
possession and use to try and stem the rising 
tide of drug addiction, especially in the South 
where it is a recent phenomenon. Sometimes 
users are even sentenced to death for the 
possession of a few grams. Its supporters say 
that decriminalization is just one part of an 
overall risk reduction policy. They argue that 
it would be futile to try to eliminate the use 
of illegal drugs, which is inherent in our 
societies, without getting at the roots of such 
problems of the modern world as loneliness, 
unemployment and other forms of economic 
and emotional distress. 
Abstinence, which isthe aim of prohibition, 
must therefore not be the main goal but, in

products off the market 
while breaking up the relationship between 
user and dealer. 
Another basic argument in favour of risk 
reduction is the distinction between soft and 
hard drugs. The former, primarily the 
cannabis derivatives hashish and marijuana, 
are not considered very harmful. The latter, 
including heroin, cocaine, amphetamines 
and other synthetic drugs, carry 
“unacceptable” risks. At present, The 
Netherlands is the only country with 
legislation based on that distinction, although 
a scientific report handed in to France’s junior 
minister of health in June 1998 made 
headlines by asserting that “cannabis hasno 
  
neurotoxicity” and “from that point of view, 
is completely different from alcohol, cocaine, 
ecstasy and psychostimulants.” 
The Dutch exception is a model for risk 
reduction advocates. Contrary to popular 
belief, the possession of drugs for personal 
use is against the law in The Netherlands. But 
the possession and sale of less than 30 grams 
of cannabis derivatives has been tolerated since 
1972. That has given rise to the 200 or so 
coffee shops where users can legally purchase 
and consume hashish or marijuana. The last 
point is exactly where the risk reduction 
principle encounters the fiercest opposition. 
The UNDCP stresses that “most of the 
arguments advanced in the name of risk 
reduction are compatible with a flexible 
interpretation of the prohibition policy.” But 
in the case of The Netherlands, the step 
towards de facto legalization of cannabis seems 
to have been taken. This is a step the United 
Nations refuses to recommend. 
The legalization of drugs would simply 
consist of allowing substances that are today 
illicit to be freely sold. Actually, it would be 
difficult to find an anti-prohibitionist who 
would advocate such a radical solution. A more 
accurate term to describe what they favour 
would be controlled legalization. In other 
words, narcotics production and distribution 
would come under state control along lines 
that could be compared to the way opium was 
produced and distributed in the former 
European colonies. T he pro-legalization camp 
includes figures as varied as liberal economists, 
legal experts, doctors, psychologists and

ProDUCTION 
* Heroin: the poppy fields of the 
Golden Triangle (Burma, Laos, 
Thailand) produce annually some 
2,500 tons of opium likely to yield 
250 tons of heroin. A similar 
amount is produced in the Golden 
Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan). 
Poppy cultivation is on the rise in 
Latin America (100 or so tons of 
opium annually or 10 tons of 
heroin) and Central Asia. 
* Cocaine: according to Interpol, 
coca plantations in the Andean 
countries (Peru, Bolivia, Colombia) 
supply 700 to 1,300 tons of 
cocaine chlorhydrate a year. 
* Cannabis: cannabis resin, or 
hashish, is produced in Morocco 
(2,000 to 2,500 tons) and 
Pakistan/Afghanistan (over 2,000 
tons). Cannabis herb, or marijuana, 
is produced worldwide. The World 
Customs Organization reportsthe 
seizure of 513 tonsin 1997. 
CONSUMPTION 
Thereisno truly reliable estimate of 
worldwide consumption of illicit 
substances. The United Nations 
puts forward the figures of eight 
million heroin addicts, 13.3 million 
cocaine addicts, 141.2 million users 
of cannabis derivatives and over 
280 million consumers of synthetic 
drugs (hallucinogens, 
amphetamines) and variousdrugs 
that are used for other than 
therapeutic purposes (sedatives). 
ILLICIT REVENUES 
The annual global turnover of the 
illicit drug trade is put at 
approximately $400 billion, or 
around 8% of the total value of 
international trade. Profit margins 
vary depending on the product. 
They range from 100% for heroin 
to 300% for wholesale crack, a 
form of cocaine that can be 
smoked. [|     
The hard 
truth 
st how far should doctors go in making 
1 realize that they have only a few 
months to live? Many physicians avoid the hard 
truth, fearing that they risk depriving patients 
of their last chance— the hope and the will— 
to survive. But they may be doing more harm 
than good, according to a recent study 
published in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association (JAMA, 3 June 1998). 
Studying the cases of 917 adults hospitalized 
with the final stages of lung or colon cancer, the 
found that 
overestimated their chances to live six months, 
research patients greatly 
even though their physicians’ less optimistic 
prognoses w ere far more accurate. While 59 per 
cent of the patients estimated that they had at 
least a 90 per cent chance of surviving six months, 
the data found that only 45 per cent actually 
lived that long. 
This over-optimism heavily influenced patients’ 
treatment decisions. Convinced that they would 
survive for at least six months, patientstended to 
opt for aggressive life-prolonging treatment 
instead of care designed to relieve their pain 
and discomfort.It is important to note that the 
more optimistic patients, regardless of their 
treatment, lived longer than the more pragmatic. 
However, the patients who sought to extend life 
had exactly the same median survival as those 
who privileged their quality of life. In fact, the 
former were 1.6 times more likely to suffer 
adverse events like re-admission to the hospital, 
attempted resuscitation or death while attached 
to a ventilator 
“We've got to ask: If patients better 
understood their prognoses, would they choose 
the same kind of treatment?” said the study’s 
leading author, Dr Jane Weeks of the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute (Boston,US) in a JAMA press 
release. As the study concludes, “ to achieve the 
goalsof making care at the end of life consistent 
with patient values and minimizing futile therapy, 
we may need to change what physicians tell 
patients about their prognosesand be sure that 
patients hear and understand what their 
physicians have said’ u

A 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
u turally 
In Central Asia, cultural heritage policies have a single objective: to shore up 
fragile national identities 
s the former Soviet republics of 
Central Asia get down to post- 
independence nation-building, a 
major cultural issue has crystallized around 
their attitudes to their past, which until 
recently was designed and organized by 
Moscow. The end of the Soviet system has 
not taken the politics out of national 
heritage—far from it. It has actually led to 
an excess of politicization as new relationships 
with the past have entrenched old ways of 
thinking. 
In the 1970s, intellectual elites in the 
Central Asian republics were able to revive a 
few selected aspects of their respective 
national heritages. They were trying to do 
two thin gs: provide historical justification for 
the political borders established by Stalin 
and prove the historical need for a deliberate 
fusion of the region’s peoples with their 
Russian big brother. 
Today, this framework is still the basis of 
the new interpretation of national history on 
the fringes of the former Soviet Union. The 
emergence of autonomous political 
organizations in the late 1980s and the 
declarations of independence in 1991 
simply reinforced the first aim and turned 
the second upside down. Legitimizing 
Russia. At the same time, this recent 
development incorporates a wide range of 
attitudes which vary according to the specific 
features of each national heritage and arise 
from the political situation of five new states 
with sometimes divergent interests. 
The main purpose of places of 
remembrance is to provide focal points for 
consensus. But the societies of Central Asia 
are scarred by internal divisions inherited 
  
Places of

focal points for

from a modern history riven with a host of 
conflicts. So it would seem hard to promote 
a sense of unity by referring to political figures 
of the recent past. 
For this reason,earlier history has been 
brought into play, and those grey areas of 
memory where the unwritten history of the 
more recent past is stored have been pushed 
aside. The wealth of recent history was, 
celebrations held to mark the twentieth 
anniversary of the death of Ali Khan Tura 
Saghuni, who led a resistance movement 
against the Red Army in the 1920s and then 
twenty years later headed a short-lived 
Muslim republic in eastern Turkestan. 
Great figures from medieval history serve 
to recall the independent past of each former 
Soviet republic, especially in relation to 
Russia, and its capacity to have its own healthy 
political institutions. Uzbekistan, for example, 
which has gone far along the road to de- 
Russification,has rehabilitated Amir Timur 
(the Tamerlaine of medieval European 
chroniclers), who is presented not so much as 
a conqueror as an epitome of the just ruler, 
intent on maintaining social harmony. 
Moves of this kind are sometimes frowned 
upon by neighbouring states, which do not 
always have fond memories of the “iron 
conqueror”. Some even see Uzbekistan’s 
action as a bid for hegemony. One such case 
is Tajikistan, which was invented from scratch 
in the late 1920s and is a largely Persian- 
speaking country whose national history is 
based on glorifying resistance to the 
inexorable spread of Turkish influence in 
Central Asia.

commemoration of great national figures of the 
past began to revive all along the southern 
edge of the Soviet Union. This pointed up the 
uniqueness of each national culture, while at 
the same time stressing the need to be united 
with the Russian world. Because these great 
figures had to be apolitical and non-religious, 
they were sought in literary history and oral 
tradition. 
The Middle Ages again came in very 
handy for this, but the modern period could 
also be re-injected into official histories 
through the use of “civilizing” figures (known 
as prosvetiteli in Russian) drawn from 
eighteenth-century Russian cultural history 
and from the years of Russian populism 
between 1860 and 1870. In this way, the 
reform movements which emerged in Central 
Asia until the area was sovietized in the 1920s, 
could be presented as the triumph of 
enlightenment inspired by the Russian 
example.

traditionally opposed to fundamentalist

authorities’ current interest in the tomb of

in Bukhara,and the government’s tolerance 
of the posthumous cult which has grown up 
around Ali Khan Tura, who until his death in 
1976 even had many followers inside the 
Uzbek communist party. 
So the politicization of the cultural heritage

including the delicate question of borders. A

of the Tajik

Tower of 
discord 
Wer began this summer on a new scheme 
to reduce the inclination of Italy's leaning 
tower of Pisa, probably the world’s only 
architectural masterpiece famed for a 
construction defect. The 8-storey, 56-metre high 
white marble tower, which was built between 
1173 and 1350, began to lean when its 
foundations shifted during construction of the 
third storey, but the builders pressed on 
regardless. Its overhang was used by Galileo, 
who dropped metal balls from the top storey to 
prove the theory of gravity. The tower, which 
today leans about 5 metres out of true, was 
closed to tourists in 1990 because of fears that 
it might topple 
Remedies for the tower's plight have been 
proposed for centuries. Some of them come from 
the wilder reaches of the imagination. One 
proposal advocated attaching a helium balloon 
to the top of the tower; another favoured 
reshaping the surrounding meadow so that it 
would slope in the same direction as the tower 
leans and make it look upright. 
The latest project seeks to raise the tower by 
half a degree or 40 cm. Soil will be extracted 
from beneath the high, northern side of the 
foundations, thereby, says Professor John 
Burland, a member of the Pisa Commission which 
is in charge of restoration, “reducing the 
inclination in a gentle and controlled manner by 
an amount that is imperceptible to the eye.” 
Temporary steel cables are being used to hold the 
tower “in the very unlikely event of unforeseen 
detrimental movements” 
Like other schemes before it, the current 
engineering operation has aroused vociferous 
criticism, causing the monument to be dubbed 
the “ Tower of Discord” in the Italian press. An 
organization called ArtWatch International, which 
monitorsart restoration projects, says that repair 
work has made the structure more unstable than 
before. Professor Piero Pierotti, a Pisan art historian 
who has published a book entitled Una Torre Da 
Non Salvare (“ How not to save the Tower of Pisa” ), 
was quoted assaying that this work of “ soaring 
imagination and symbolic beauty’ is also 
“unquestionably a phallic symbol” and that 
“ perhaps the attempt to pull it erect is another 
aspect of the age of Viagra.” [|

tomorrow’s world 
The media’s simplistic 
vision of the next 
century alternates 
between gloom and 
euphoria 
e have been spinning fantasies 
about the third millennium for a 
long time. But the closer we get to 
the year 2000, the more harmless it seems, 
the more artificial the break with the past. 
The future is already here, for the media 
have been swamping us with pictures and 
stories about what may lie in store. T he Italian 
communications group Mediaset 
commissioned the Explorer-Ipsos research 
and marketing institute to conduct a study of 
how they view the years to come. Entitled 
“The Media and the Millennium”, it was 
carried out in seven countries regarded as the 
leading trend-setters—Germany, Spain, the 
United States, France, Japan, Italy and the 
United Kingdom—where the media are 
powerful enough to influence a global public. 
“We tried to understand how the next 
millennium was being depicted in the press, on 
television, on the Internet and in fashion, 
design, advertising and art,” says Giulia 
Ceriani, who is in charge of semiotic studies at 
Explorer and presented the survey’s main 
findings at Candido Mendes University in Rio 
de Janeiro (Brazil) last May. 
If the media are to be believed, life in the 
twenty-first century will be no bed of roses. 
They are predicting “chaos”, says Ceriani, 
citing as evidence cartoons and television series 
showing the end of the real world and invasion 
by alien rulers, the increasing number of 
Internet chat forums on the end of history and 
art and fashion trends reflecting ideas of change 
and hybridization. That bleak picture is 
symptomatic of a total loss of bearings in “a 
world of contradictions and ‘contamination’ 
characterized by the disappearance of 
boundaries between objects, identities and 
values that have long been clearly distinct, such 
as masculine and feminine, the self and the 
other, the natural and the artificial. 
Fear of the future is fueled in large part 
by lightning-fast, uncontrolled developments 
in science and technology such as genetic 
manipulations that make it possible to “free” 
an individual’s identity from his or her genome, 
the high-speed circulation of information 
which shakes cultural certainties, and artificial 
intelligence which seems to abolish the 
boundary between humans and machines. 
“The print and broadcast media echo rising 
anxiety about the impact of scientific advances, 
which have much less support and raise many 
more questions than they did fifteen or twenty 
years ago,” says Suzanne de Cheveigné, a 
media expert at France’s National Centre for 
Scientific Research (CNRS).

gloom, the media, especially television, offer an 
almost idyllic vision of the future as an era of 
tremendous advances for humankind, 
including gene therapy, the emergence of a 
global citizenry through Internet and the 
development of clean energy sources. The 
media’s discourse “oscillates between a 
‘euphoric’ and a ‘dysphoric’view,” says Brian 
Trench of the University of Dublin, adding 
that articles and television programmes on 
science are often “superficial”. Pierre 
Chevalier, of the French-German public 
television network La Sept/Arte,acknowled ges 
that journalists have a poor command of the 
“very specific language” required by science 
reporting, which is difficult to illustrate with 
pictures. Moreover, most television executives 
are more interested in high audience shares 
than programme quality. And to capture the 
attention of a large number of viewers,shock 
is often more effective than rational inquiry. 
“By and large, the bigger and less educated 
the audience, the gloomier the message,” says 
de Cheveigné. 
Media coverage of science also varies 
depending on the cultural context. Americans 
have a mostly upbeat,“pragmatic” vision of 
technological advances and cloning, whereas 
ethical concerns come to the fore in Europe’s 
Latin countries. American media “present 
only ‘facts’ and less speculation about what 
the implications of the facts might be,” says 
Bruce V. Lewenstein of Cornell University. 
Trench stresses another facet of the problem. 
He says the media’s rosy outlook on new 
information technology, for example, reflects 
a desire to treat computer companies, which 
are major advertisers, with kid gloves. “The 
media increasingly belong to corporate 
interests,” says New York broadcast specialist 
Charles B. Potter, adding that the image they 
provide of the future has no inherent value 
but is merely one more “product” on the 
market. 
Still, polls conducted by Explorer-Ipsos 
reveal that the public has had its fill of simplistic 
discourse. They would like to see more subtle, 
hopeful messages about the possibility of taking 
back control of their destiny. “People are aware 
they are living through a period of transition 
and want order,” says Ceriani. “They want 
more rational, less sensationalist 
communication. They are fed up with the 
bizarre and the alien. Hence the return in 
design to simpler, reassuring shapes associated 
with technology that’s under control.” The 
media would do well to fall into step with the 
trend towards reassurance and a shift in focus 
back to everyday life. By continuing to stress 
the inability to find a way out of the crisis,they 
probably help to increase the public’s anxiety 
and the appeal of New Age movements, forms 
of immanent spirituality considered capable of 
exorcising the demons of uncertainty. u

### 113637: When the kitchen does the cooking

When the 
Microchips may soon be in your shoes, monitoring 
your body temperature. But how long before they 
take you for a walk? 
ook, you're a doughnut.” Professor 
Michael Hawley is stating his case for 
mbedded technology. “You're a 
roundish little thing with a hole in the top 
and you pour food in and it comes out a hole 
in the bottom and you roll around a little 
during the day, but topologically speaking 
you're just a doughnut.And that’s about all 
you know about the nature of what you eat 
and what comes out.” 
Hawley, a principal investigator for the 
Things That Think (TTT) consortium, a 
research group at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, is 
trying to make commonplace, everyday 
objects smarter to better understand and 
monitor our bodies. “We are incredibly 
naive about how our bodies work day to day. 
because we don’t have any way to 
measure it or sense it.” 
For too long we have been forced to adapt 
to technology—to make our bodies and lives 
conform to clunky desktop computers, for 
example. We memorize long strings of web 
addresses to find cheap airfares but have 
trouble remembering where we left our keys. 
The solution to these problems, at least in 
the United States, is more technology. 
Embedded technology that is smaller, smarter 
and, most importantly, everywhere. 
Embedded technology—fitting out objects 
with computational enhancements that 
integrate digital and physical worlds—will 
move in two directions: out into our 
environment and closer to our bodies. 
According to Professor Mitchel Resnick, 
anotherTTT member, the growth of research 
in this field, which has substantial corporate 
support, can be tied to three developments: 
smaller and cheaper processors, better sensors, 
and continued advances in communication 
and networking technologies. 
Hawley says, “It’s becoming miniaturized 
so quickly that what used to be as big as a 
house and then as big as a file cabinet now sits 
on your desk,and then it’s in your lap, then 
it’s in your pockets and then it might as well 
be your pockets.” 
Back to the doughnut. One of Hawley’s 
many research interests is body monitoring 
technology. His team has attached new body 
sensing technology to marathon runners and 
Mount Everest climbers. Subjects even 
swallowed a pill that measured body core 
temperature. Hawley foresees a time when 
we will monitor our health with a wristwatch 
And it’s all free.

device or a processor in the heels of our shoes, 
where there is room for chips. According to 
Hawley, health monitoring, for those who 
can afford it,will be “one of those really big 
inventions that is an indispensable part of 
everyday life.So that your shoes know more 
about you every day than the doctor has ever 
known before.” 
Making this technology more intuitive and 
comfortable is MIT graduate student 
Margaret Orth, who is developing electronic 
fabric. While she can imagine the practical 
uses of fabrics embedded with computational 
components,Orth is driven by expressive and 
emotional goals: to create clothing which can 
not only monitor heart rates but also 
emotions—or act as an interface for creative 
expression. She has already designed a musical 
jacket with a sewn-in keyboard, and believes 
that “by creating computational devices that 
are intimate with us physically, we begin to 
think about technology differently. We begin to 
think that it is accessible, reachable, creative 
and ultimately human.” 
The key to many embedded technologies 
is the communication between objects. Media 
Lab researchers have proposed giving every 
single object on the planet a unique Universal 
Binary Identification Code (UBIC), a series 
of numbers that identifies it to any 
other object or network that has a 
need to know. 
Imagine a smart box of corn 
flakes. A sensor collects data 
about how much cereal is in the 
box. The processor “knows” when 
the box is almost empty and then 
communicates the information to 
the house network, which 
places an online order for a 
new box.Hold up a bottle of aspirin to your 
networked bathroom screen and the 
manufacturer’s web site or information about 
drug interactions will appear. The goal is to 
make mundane tasks as easy and automatic 
as possible, freeing time for more entertaining 
or thoughtful pursuits. 
Place a can of mushroom soup, an old 
bag of carrots and other food on your kitchen 
counter and the kitchen will suggest several 
recipes, then recite the instructions as you

advertisements to offset their cost, and will 
they make shopping so easy that you purchase 
more than you need? 
As with many new technologies, we will

your mileage they will also know when to 
send you advertisements for a new car. 
Yet beyond these commercial interests, 
there is a wider concern lurking in the 
background of this smart new 
world. Media scholar and MIT 
literature professor Henry 
Jenkins reminds us that the 
history of technology has always 
been coupled with fear of the 
new tools. “What is basic to 
these fears is the sense that we 
are giving over too much 
control over our lives to 
technology.” At the 
  
same time, “We have too long a history of 
watching technology fail in our daily lives.” 
As Jenkins explains, “Trusting the 
machine means not simply trusting the 
technology itself, which seems alien and 
unreliable, but also trusting the companies 
which made it,which are often perceived as 
out for quick profit, planning for 
obsolescence, disinterested in consumers’ 
real needs and sloppy in their workmanship.

is 
literature and you will find that the subject 
matter either deals with an investigation into 
the violation of a taboo, in short a crime, 
or else is a love story. 
Detective novels,as originally invented, 
with a fixed imaginative world, are a very 
run-of-the-mill and predictable genre. 
However,the modern detective novel of the 
past thirty or forty years shouldn’t be properly 
described as such. They're novels like any 
others in which, basically, an investigation is 
conducted into the meaning of a social crime. 
As for how the subject is handled, in my 
opinion there’s no difference compared with 
anovel that’s not in the “detective” category. 
I regard John Le Carré and Graham Greene 
as being as ambitious in their literary aims 
as VirginiaWoolf. I know that sounds heretical 
but I firmly believe it. What interests me is that 
it’s possible to start out from a set character 
and turn the story almost into a saga about 
the evolution of a society. 
Bm How do you explain the success of 
Carvalho, the private detective who is 
the main character in your novels? 
M.V. M.: IT think he’s an international 
success for one reason: he’s been a mirror 
not only of the transition that’s taken place 
in Spain but transition in a broader sense. 
He’s a man who recreates the atmosphere 
of the 1960s, a time which held out great 
hopes of ecological change and saw the 
arrival of hippies, the birth control pill, 
freedom in every form and gentle, lyrical 
revolutions. There’s also a kind of fin-de-siecle 
despair, in which people are scared oflosing 
their jobs and catching Aids and afraid of 
freedom, a fear that the Pope in Rome and 
the manipulators of labour markets, among 
others,have succeeded in instilling in them 
through a sort of repressive mechanism. 
Carvalho has mirrored all these things in 
the novels and that’s why I think that what 
he has to say can be heard in so many 
places. 
m Why does cooking occupy so 
important a place in your books, 
to the extent that it is almost like 
a character? 
M.V.M.: In the first place, it’s because the 
only thing I can do, apart from write, is cook. 
Second, because it is a necessary 
ingredient, especially in the Carvalho 
series; cooking is hardly ever mentioned in 
my other novels. A set character has to have 
two or three recognizable quirks. There 
isn’t a single character who doesn’t have them. 
Everybody who reads Georges Simenon’s 
Maigret novels knows he’s waiting for the 
first seasonal dishes, the first spring peas 
in the brasserie, no matter how they're 
prepared, and draught beer the way they 
only serve it in a particular bar. Readers wait 
for that to happen; they wait for Sherlock 
Holmes to play the violin or start sniffing. 
I gave Carvalho one or two of those traits 
and I’ve had to respect them from one 
novel to the next. 
I believe, moreover, that cooking is 
also a metaphor for one’s own culture. 
I’ve sometimes stressed this. Cooking is the 
death mask. In order to eat we have to 
kill, whether it be a head of lettuce or an 
animal. If the act is a direct one, in other 
words if you kill and then eat, it is an act 
of barbarism. On the other hand, if you kill, 
cook and then eat, the cultural aspect 
appears; this involves applying to the act 
of killing a skill or technology that adds 
dignity and turns it into culture. 
Bm What about book-burning, your hero’s 
other quirk? 
M.V.M.: On several occasions Carvalho says 
he burns books because literature has not 
taught him how to live. T hat’s a meaningless 
exaggeration, but it’s a ritual the character 
has to perform. 
Wm In literary terms, is Carvalho ever going 
to die?

### 113638: Manuel Vázquez Montalbán: writing is an act of free choice

Montalban: 
act of free choice’ 
M.V.M.: This poses a serious credibility 
problem for me. Carvalho is a man I 
originally shut myself up with and I 
reckoned on giving him more or less a 
certain age, but I kept on forgetting. 
However, the character’s psychological 
development corresponds to his physical 
development, and that makes it very hard 
for Carvalho to survive as a private 
detective because aggressiveness,physical 
strength and a whole gamut of facial 
expressions are involved, and frankly he 
cannot afford such luxuries. So in the 
millennium novel, which I hope will come 
out in the year 2000, either I can pension 
him off and get rid of him after he’s 
returned to the world with Biscuter (a 
former convict who is the detective’s 
assistant), or I can turn him into something 
else. 
I once thought of turning Carvalho into 
a spy, what might be called a post-modern spy 
working for new powers that never had any 
spies before, like autonomous regional 
authorities, or a municipal, environmental, 
industrial or ethnic spy. That sort of thing is 
going to be big business in the future.In the 
present-day division of conflicts in the world, 
as essayists like Alvin Toffler and Hans 
Magnus Enzensberger have actually 
predicted, information services will be needed 
in the new climate of conflict that is liable to 
trigger future civil wars. So why not turn 
Carvalho into a spy for the Generalitat,the 
provincial government of Catalonia, with all 
the overtones of irony and symbolism of 
setting that could imply? I’m thinkin g about 
it as a possibility, but I don’t know yet whether 
I shall go ahead or not. 
Hm How do you go about creating your 
books? 
M.V. M.:T use a very conventional system in 
which I accumulate facts and ideas. The poet 
T.S. Eliot describes this creative process very 
clearly. One stage consists of gathering the 
materials, whether consciously or 
unconsciously. Sometimes you accumulate 
things you initially don’t think will end up 
as a book, a novel or a poem. Even so, you 
keep on building them up asa reserve, a sort 
of storehouse. When these materials are dense 
enough, they look for a way out. It’s rather like 
the moraine of a glacier which goes on piling 
up debris until the time comes for it to seek 
an outlet, when a current emerges. That’s 
how I see the creative process. 
® |n your writing, how do you manage to 
identify with places like Argentina or 
Bangkok so closely it’s as though you 
had lived there? 
M. V. M.: First, there’s the information- 
gathering process I just mentioned. Then 
there’s the fact that people’s ideological and 
emotional patterns are coming increasingly 
to resemble each other because we consume 
the same food and the same cultural and 
media products. Our living patterns and 
production relations are becoming more and 
more alike. That means we can understand 
much more about how we ourselves behave 
and how other people behave. 
Aristotle is supposed to have said “you 
are what you eat.” It’s a fact that,in cultural 
terms,all of us eat virtually the same things. 
The closest we can come to living in a 
Barcelona suburb and watching television is 
living in a Bangkok suburb and watching 
television, because all of us watch the same 
American programmes in any case. 
BH |s that why Barcelona is almost like 
another character in most of your 
novels? 
M.V.M.: Yes. Barcelona is a port and a city of 
transit. It’s also a place where many memories 
exist side-by-side.All that makes it a multi- 
faceted city in every sense. Such cities tend to 
be very interesting from the literary point of 
view. Many cities have literary associations 
and others do not. A considerable amount 
of writing has been devoted to Barcelona, as 
it has to Buenos Aires and many other cities. 
In the United States, for example, a whole 
imaginary world has been created by books 
and films on San Francisco and New York, yet 
that hardly exists in the case of Washington. 
Bm What does Barcelona mean to you 
personally? 
M.V.M.: It’s my homeland,in the true sense 
of the word. It is the place where you were 
born, where your reflexes were shaped, where 
you learnt that other people exist and how 
much they are threatening or well-disposed 
towards you.It’s the place where you learnt 
codes of conduct—all kinds, not only having 
to do with language—and where you also 
learnt to pick up a system of signals that make 
you feel you belong to that particular parcel 
of territory more than to any other. 
As you rationalize all this, you come to 
agree with Saint-Exupéry that you're from the 
country of your childhood, since childhood 
is a piece of physical and emotional territory. 
That’s what Barcelona means to me. 
More specifically, I'd say I'm not so much 
from Barcelona as from a particular 
neighbourhood of the city. That’s what marks 
you in the first place,although then you try 
to generalize and absorb other cultural 
features and patterns. That’s what Barcelona 
basically represents for me. Moreover, 
because ofits layout and history, it’s not just 
one conventional city but a diversity of cities 
because it’s an amalgam of different 
archaeological periods. They're not only 
monumental,such as the Romanesque city, 
the Gothic city, the neo-classical city, the city 
of modemismo and of Gaudi, but represent 
different periods of archaeology as they relate 
to human beings. Barcelona is a city that 
attracted various migratory movements which 
gave rise to the incorporation of new strands 
and to a degree of cross-fertilization following 
the clash with the culture that came before. 
Moreover, Barcelona was largely shaped 
at the end of the last century by the influx of 
Catalans from the countryside, working-class 
people who flocked there to join the industrial 
revolution.Hence, it was a gathering-place for 
people from the grassroots all over the 
country. 
Bm You've always had a sense of political 
commitment. Do you think writers are 
bound to be militants? 
M.V.M.: Absolutely. Writing is an act of free 
choice. Some writers need to get involved in 
social and political issues and others donot. 
All we ask of a writer is that he or she should 
write well. I subscribe to the theory, which is 
in fact quite widespread, that there is always 
something ideological in what all writers have 
to offer, although they may seem to be »

completely impervious to that sort of thing. 
They can always be read in terms ofideology, 
of taking a stand in the eyes of the world and 
in our own eyes. Yet we must respect the free 
choice writers make,the fact that they want 
to feel they're in touch with real-life causes 
and with their inner selves. 
® You recently went to Cuba and reported 
on the visit of Pope John Paul Il. Was 
that your decision or the idea of the 
editors of El Pais, the newspaper you 
write for? 
M.V.M.:I went to Cuba to collect material for 
my next book and when the newspaper found 
out I was going there they asked me to write 
some articles. Everything you see before you 
comes from Cuba—all the folders, the 
documents, the books—everything on the 
tables has to do with Cuba, because I'm in full 
creative gear. That’s why it looks like a 
battlefield. 
Bm What was the significance of that visit, 
as you see it? 
M.V.M.: I feel that the Pope’s visit to Cuba was 
fundamental, because it’s astonishing that, 
at the end of the twentieth century, no lesser 
a personage than the Pope should purport 
to be the saviour ofa Marxist revolution. I see 
it as something midway between a caricature 
and a miracle. 
Bm What do you think the future holds in 
TALKING TO... 
store for Europe? What role can a 
united Europe play in a globalized 
world? 
M.V. M.:1 think that whatever idea one may 
have of Europe,it cannot be separated from 
the idea of globalization. When the idea of a 
united Europe was put forward, people were 
thinking more in terms of power blocs. They 
thought Europe could be a third way. The 
first instinct was to prevent the recurrence 
of conflicting interests that had arisen in the 
struggle for the European market, which had 
triggered two world wars. That gave rise to the 
image of Europe as a bloc which could 
compete with the American and Asian blocs. 
Now we're faced with the broader issue of 
globalization. I think the idea of a united 
Europe is still attractive because it includes 
one distinctive feature:the fact that Europe 
has a cultural substratum that’s different from 
all other possible blocs. This cultural 
substratum still weighs heavily in all the 
struggles for emancipation, equality and 
freedom that have formed part of the history 
of Europe. A European interpretation of the 
globalization of capital is bound to differ from 
that of a culture like that of the United States, 
where policy is geared to achieving results or 
to making the system run more efficiently. 
On the other hand, in European policy, 
everything depends on the people conducting 
it. Even so, there’s still a background, a 
substratum that remembers the struggle for 
emancipation and social gains. This 
interpretation differs from that of capitalistic 
development.That’s how I see things. 
Bm What if things don’t turn out like that? 
M.V.M.: If things werent like that, I think I'd 
lose interest in the whole project.But if the 
Europe taking shape were to have a domestic 
and foreign policy and a more committed 
policy towards North-South relations, it 
would be the kind of Europe I could take an 
interest in. On the other hand, ifit’s going to 
be just another bloc adopting the same policy 
as other blocs,there would obviously be no 
other course than to accept it as it is, but in 
that case I wouldn’t be interested in it. I 
believe the aim and purpose of a united 
Europe will largely depend on the relationship 
between the forces existing within it. If the 
hard-line neo-liberal sectors of unbridled 
capitalism end up imposing their will, Europe 
will become an uncontrolled capitalist bloc. 
® How do you feel about the new 
electronic communication media? Do 
you think audio-visual culture will 
replace the culture of writing? 
M.V.M.: Until now, every innovation that has 
appeared in the media has led to arguments 
over whether it was going to spell the demise 
of books. All the gloomiest predictions have 
been off the mark.Each medium has had its 
own territory and its own basic function. 
Perhaps it will be easier for the younger 
generations, who are already used to 
A non-stop novelist 
  
ike his hero, the detective Pepe 
arvalho, Manuel Vazquez Montalban 
(born Barcelona, 1939) looks upon 
himself as taking a walk through history. 
Considering his wide-ranging and varied 
literary output, a journalist was not 
entirely wrong when he jokingly said, 
“With Vazquez Montalban, no sooner 
have you finished reviewing hislast novel 
than the next one is already in the 
bookshops.” Montalban readily admits 
that he is a workaholic and that he has 
written more than he haslived.” One day 
| shall have to stop writing in order to 
remember how to live” he once told an 
interviewer. 
His style, with its peculiar mix of 
criticism, humour and ingenuity, is an 
outstanding feature of his writing.Such 
books as Cronica sentimental de Espafa 
(“ A Sentimental Chronicle of Spain”), Mis 
almuerzos con gente inquietante (“My 
Lunches with Disturbing People”), El 
escriba sentado (“ The Seated Scribe”), 
Manifiesto subnormal (“ The Sub-normal 
Manifesto” ) or Un polaco en la Corte del 
Rey Juan Carlos (“ A Pole at the Court of 
King Juan Carlos” ) reflect his penetrating 
vision of present-day reality. 
A novelist, essayist and poet, Vazquez 
Montalban has never stopped working as 
a journalist. In hisweeklycolumnin Spain's 
newspaper El Pais, aswell asin Italy's La 
Repubblica and France’s Le Monde 
Diplomatique, he comments on the world 
scene by analysing the political and social 
situation or everyday events. 
The sequence of novels featuring 
Carvalho began in 1972 with Yo Mate a 
Kennedy (“I Killed Kennedy”), which 
brought the author international success. 
The Galician detective, “a former CIA 
agent, a former member of the Communist 
Party, a capricious, self-taught and life- 
enhancing figure, prone to violence in 
many of his attitudes and reactions’ , has 
over 25 years of fictional life behind him 
and commands the allegiance of a host of 
fans who have set up clubs and e-mail 
discussion groups and even opened bars 
named after him. The hero of over twenty 
novels, including Southern Seas (which 
won Spain’s prestigious Planeta Prize in 
1979 and the Prix International de 
Littérature Policiérein 1981), La Soledad 
del Manager (The Angst-Ridden 
Executive), La Rosa de Alejandria (“ The 
Rose of Alexandria”), El Premio (“ The 
Prize”) and Quinteto de Buenos Aires 
(“ Buenos Aires Quintet”), Carvalho has 
made several more or less successful 
foraysinto film, television and even comic 
strips. 
Vazquez Montalban has also written 
semi-fictional books based on historical 
figures, including the prize-winning 
Autbiografia del General Franco 
(“ Autobiography of General Franco”), 
Pasionaria y los siete enanitos (“La 
Pasionaria and the Seven Dwarfs’ ),and 
hislatest work, O César 0 nada (“ Caesar 
or Nothing” ), which is set in the Rome of 
the Borgias 
His poetic worksinclude Liquidacion de 
restos de serie (“ Sales of Last Season’s 
Clothes”), Movimientos sin éxito 
(“ Unsuccessful Movements” ), Coplasa la 
muerte de mi tia Daniela (* Verses on the 
Death of My Aunt Daniela”), A la sombra 
de las muchachas en flor (“ Within a 
Budding Grove”), Praga (“ Prague”) and 
Pero el viajero que huye (“ But the Traveller 
Who Fees’). 
A fine gourmet, a magnificent cook 
and a fan of football, which he regards 
as a “secular religion”, Vazquez 
Montalban has always upheld the 
ideological tenets of the left, which iswhy 
he spent time in Franco’s prisons when 
he was a young man. 
A writer who describes himself as 
“ Sanish-Catalan and perhaps European or 
Eurafrican” , in 1995 he was awarded the 
National Prize of Spanish Letters for his 
body of work. He isa graduate in philosophy 
and literature, and the Universidad 
Autonoma de Barcelona conferred an 
honorary doctorate on him in 1997. 
Modest and unassuming,he is known to 
his colleagues and friends simply as 
Manolo. [|

computers as working tools. But I don’t think 
it’ll ever be possible to read a literary text on 
a computer screen. It may be possible to 
create new forms of literary expression via 
the screen, but they won’t have the novel’s 
substance,time-span or length. New forms 
that are somehow connected with computers 
may well emerge, but I think that the 
traditional forms are very closely bound up 
with the formal shape of books, with the 
operation that makes it possible to re-read 
them and go back and forth in them, and 
with the tactile sensation of the object, the 
vehicle of literature epitomized by books. 
Bm You've received an honorary doctorate 
from the Universidad Autonoma de 
Barcelona. What did that mean to you? 
M.V.M.: It wasn’t a great symbolic ceremony, 
since nobody wore gowns or that sort of thing. 
It was just as my Italian publisher described 
it when she said it was like a “happening” 
from May 1968. Everybody was very relaxed 
and informal. I hardly noticed the ritual side, 
but obviously I was deeply moved. In a sense, 
the work I published on the history of 
communication had borne fruit. 
I have very special memories of that 
university. When I was in prison I wrote a 
book entitled Informe sobre la informacion 
( Report on Information), which 1 published 
in 1963. All the material I used came from 
UNESCO, since that was the only source I was 
allowed to read in prison. That’s why my book 
is so much like the MacBride Report, 
although if I may say so myself my work was 
published first, since I based it on UNESCO’s 
reports on the inequality of newsprint 
distribution,the unequal distribution of the 
main news agencies,and so on.In Spain the 
book was like the one-eyed man in the land 
of the blind, although I wrote it when I was 
twenty-two using materials that were far from 
adequate. At a time when access to all the 
literature on communication was restricted 
by the Franco regime or by the social doctrine 
of the Church, which wasn’t much better, 
the book was a sort of healing balm. It was 
used in secret by journalism schools and 
scholars. 
I strengthened this link with the university 
by later becoming a lecturer in 
communication, conducting a number of 
seminars and publishing some books. All that 
forms part of my life’s substrata, and my 
admission to the university implies that this 
aspect of my work has been recognized. 
Bm Do you think young people can look to 
the twenty-first century with hope? 
M.V. M.: One should never give advice to 
anybody, or messages of hope for that 
matter. If we look at things in a fairly 
cynical light, in the best sense of the word, 
young people are going to need hope, 
although that implies self-deception. If 
you do not have a modicum of hope or 
confidence in the future, even though you 
have to deceive yourself, you would reach 
such a pitch of lucidity that the most 
advisable course would be to commit 
individual and collective suicide. To have 
hope you have to have a certain capacity 
for self-deception—or such extraordinary 
faith in your future plans, whether they have 
to do with religion, love, society or ideology, 
that you overcome everything in your path. 
That’s not easy in this day and age because 
it’s very hard to believe in great professions 
of faith after seeing what’s happened in 
history. As a result, we must come to the 
conclusion that hope is necessary for 
pursuing the mechanical game of existence. 
What we do have to abide by, what I convey 
in everything I write, is the fact that we're 
standing at a rather ominous point in time 
as far as culture is concerned. What the 
dominant culture is now instilling in us 
above all is that historical knowledge and the 
search for the past are pointless, and that 
imagining utopias and thinking that things 
could be different are likewise pointless. 
By trying to analyse why these two 
cultural trends should have cropped up at 
the same time, we find that they dovetail 
perfectly and make you attentive only to the 
present. You never pass judgment on the 
spectacle of social or economic disorder, nor 
do you seek to find out where that disorder 
originates. Since they've deprived you of the 
right to find out who in the past is to be 
blamed for the present, history is also left 
without anybody to blame. That’s what 
interests them. 
Second, when you say we should organize 
things differently, they tell you you're a 
dangerous utopian and don’t realize where 
the utopian dreams of the twentieth century 
have led us, that nothing forces you to accept 
what they're offering you, whether it be order, 
the labour market, North-South relations or 
relations between the centre and the 
periphery. If you say things can be done 
differently, it’s almost as if you're branded 
with the stigma of post-revolutionary 
nostalgia. 
So if you're to believe in the future, first 
you have to think of retrieving the past and of 
knowing the causes behind the life you're 
now leading, and to exercise the right to 
change what you find, which is inherent in any 
new venture. u

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Your replies to our letter 
[4 llus what you really think” about 
our new format, we asked readers 
in our July-August double issue. 
The question elicited so many replies that 
unfortunately we are unable to answer 
each one personally. And here there is only 
enough space to focus on the recurring 
themes the comments and 
suggestions you made. 
In short, nearly all of you want us to 
among 
continue in the new direction the Courierhas 
taken. “The project seems interesting,” one 
reader, whose name was illegible, wrote 
cautiously. Everyone else was more categorical. 
“Thanks. My 
compliments,” C. Bachelier commented 
most sincere 
laconically. “I like the new format. The 
magazine is very informative,” said Kim 
Burnham. “The new layout will be much 
useful for us,” noted Krishna Mani 
Bhandary, a librarian.“The new format is a 
success,” wrote Francois Patrice Ferron. 
From Argentina, Mario E. Sisti sent 
“congratulations on the new design as well 
as the fascinating content.” Malaysia’s 
permanent delegate to UNESCO thinks “the 
new Courier 1s very attractive with its new 
cover design and varied, quality articles.” 
Jacqueline Dupuis sent us a cheque to take 
out a subscription in the name of any reader 
we choose because, she wrote, “I increasingly 
enjoy the Courier and its relevant analysis of 
the issues it deals with.” 
One reader,Martine Bonnaud,strongly 
disagreed. She “regretted” that the Courier 
had turned into “just a good run-of-the-mill 
magazine. Journalists, she said, were gradually 
taking over from “top-ranking” scientists, 
writers and artists. 
Her criticism prompts us to make three 
points. First, we want to give our readers a 
theoretical overview of today’s major issues 
as well as report on the grassroots realities. In 
order to do that, we must necessarily ask 
qualified journalists to write feature stories. 
Second, we pay close attention to ensuring 
that articles by top-ranking experts from 
around the world continue to figure 
prominently in the Courier. That isone of the 
main reasons we exist. Finally, you will notice 
that leading specialists also have an indirect 
voice in the articles written by our journalists, 
because they go straight to the source for 
facts and analysis. 
Three recurring themes emerged from 
your suggestions. Guy Langlais, who has been 
a subscriber “since the 1950s,” wrote, “Fifty 
years have gone by and the same problems are 
still besetting and eating away at most of the 
world’s societies. There has been some 
progress, but in most places conditions have 
deteriorated, often seriously and sometimes 
irreversibly.” He concludes, “we must 
denounce... the illusions, the evils, the 
distortions, the empty innovations, the throw- 
away society... and support resistance, which 
is vital. It’s up to you to wake us up. Otherwise 
you will serve no purpose.” 
In what areas? Mainly, sustainable 
development in a broad sense—equitable 
and co-operative development, primarily 
between the North and the South, rich and 
poor—and the environment. But the Courier 
isnot in the business of painting the gloomiest 
possible picture. The magazine also 
highlights, in the words of Francis Dubois, 
“the successful experiments...that encourage 
us to keep on trying”. 
Many readers also asked us to bring back 
the letters page.So that’s just what we did.
