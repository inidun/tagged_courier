This countenance of an apsara, or heavenly nymph, is a detail of a sculpture on the facade 
of Vamana Temple at Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh, Central India. Vamana is one of a splen- 
did group of Hindu temples built for tha Chandel kings of Bundelkhand between 
950 and 1050 A.D. and dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and the Jain patriarchs. Of the 85 original 
temples, only about 20 survive, richly adorned with graceful sculptures wrought in sandstone. 
The apsaras carved on Vamana Temple form part of a reconstruction of the heaven of Indra,

This double issue of the “Unesco Courier” is a follow-up of 
our May 1974 number and is devoted to the impact of popu- 
lation growth on food, the environment, and social and 
economic development. Between 19 and 30 August, 1974, 
the World Population Conference organized by the United 
Nations will be held in Bucharest (Romania). Leading 
authorities on demographic problems have prepared various 
studies for this conference, which was preceded by a series 
of U.N. symposiums held in Cairo, Honolulu, Stockholm and 
Amsterdam. Several articles in this issue are based on studies 
prepared for these meetings. The Editors have also been 
inspired in the preparation of this number by the consid- 
erations on population set forth in a special Unesco study 
on 12 major world problems of today, to be submitted to 
Unesco’s General Conference next October.

wherever they are, whatever they do, they share 
alike in this need. 
The stark truth is that man’s ability to produce 


### 50329: We the undersigned, address this Declaration on food and population to governments and men and women everywhere

food is not keeping pace with his need. 
Despite efforts by governments and the 
international community to solve world food 
problems, more people are hungry today than 
ever before. 
Hundreds of millions of the world’s people 
are undernourished. Population growth is 
adding 75 to 80 million more people each year, 
200,000 each day. Within the next 25 years or 
so our present numbers of nearly 4 billion 
will be nearly 7 billion.* They must 
all be fed. 
  
We publish here a "Declaration on Food and Population’, signed 
by more than 1,500 prominent citizens of nearly 100 countries, 
which was presented to the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations, Kurt Waldheim, on 25 April 1974. The signatories 
include 16 Nobel Prize-winners as well as distinguished scien- 
tists and scholars, artists, statesmen, economists, and govern- 
ment and non-governmental officials. 
he world food situation took a sharp turn 
for the worse in 1972 and 1973: 
1. Stocks of grain have hit an all-time low 
since the end of World War II. Surplus stocks 
formerly held in reserve have nearly been 
exhausted and no longer offer security 
against widespread hunger and starvation. 
2. Food prices have reached new highs. 
Last year, despite a record world harvest, 
escalating demand nearly doubled grain prices. 
The increasing cost of food threatens to cause 
serious hardship for many people already 
spending most of what they have on food. 
3. Less of the cheaper protein foods, which 
normally supplement grain diets, is 
available. The world’s fish catch and per caput 
production of protein-rich legumes, the staple 
diet in many countries, have declined. 
4. Food shortages have created serious social 
unrest in many parts of the world and are 
particularly severe in countries where hunger 
and the diseases that thrive on under-nourished 
bodies are prevalent. This scarcity 
has been aggravated by the consumption 
of more and more grain to produce meat, 
eggs and milk. 
5. Mounting fertilizer and energy shortages are 
reducing food production in certain areas and 
increasing food prices. 
In this new and threatening situation, a bad 
monsoon in Asia (which could occur in any 
vear), or a drought in North America (like 
those in the 1980’s and 1950’s), could mean 
severe malnutrition for hundreds of millions 
and death for many millions.

address this declaration 
on food and population 
to governments 
and men and women everywhere 
UNDERSIGNED... 
  
his dangerously unstable world food picture, 
when seen against an unprecedented 
population increase, has created an 
immediate sense of urgency. The dangers of 
food shortages could remain a threat for the 
rest of this century—even if, hopefully, 
bumper crops in some years create temporary 
surpluses and even if the trend toward reduced 
birth rates becomes general throughout the 
world. 
World food production in the years ahead 
must rise at least 2 per cent a year to keep pace 
with the present rate of population growth. But 
it must rise a good deal more if the world’s 
people are to be provided with an adequate 
diet. This required annual increase in food 
production is considerably greater than that 
which occurred during recent decades—and 
seems to be increasingly harder to achieve each 
year. But unless there is this necessary and 
continuous increase in food production, there 
will be even more hunger and malnutrition and 
soaring food prices. 
The need to seek solutions is pressing. The 
nature of the problem, the precarious state of 
world food production made critical by 
predicted expectations of continued 
population growth, calls for concerted action by 
the world community. There is only one cure 
for hunger and that is food. No palliatives or 
panaceas in the form of reports or resolutions 
can alleviate the pain of empty stomachs that 
must be filled. International resolutions, 
however high-minded, are a mockery if they 
do not have a tangible impact on the human 
condition. 
he United Nations is now providing 
leadership on both these problems. In 
August the United Nations will convene the 
World Population Conference in Bucharest. In 
November it will convene the World Food 
Conference in Rome. These are the first 
occasions when governments have agreed to 
meet to consider these crucial questions and 
to consider taking action on them. 
With these two conferences only a few 
months away, we urge governments, acting 
before, at and after these two global 
conferences, to consider realistic and purposeful 
measures such as the following: 
1. Give high priority to programmes in each 
country which will increase the production of 
grains, legumes and other staple food crops; 
ensure the availability of protein-rich foods, 
particularly to the more vulnerable population 
groups; expand the production of fertilizer; 
and improve the opportunities for small 
farmers to make a reasonable living. Develop a 
comprehensive and constructive World Food 
Plan for adoption at the World Food Conference. 
2. Support sound population policies relevant 
to national needs which respect national 
sovereignty and the diversity of social, 
economic and cultural conditions; accept and 
assure the human right of each couple to decide 
for themselves the spacing and size of their 
families; ** and recognize the corresponding 
responsibility of governments to provide their 
peoples the information and the means to

p exercise this right effectively. *** Embody these

to be agreed upon by governments at the 
World Population Conference. 
3. Recognize that the interdependence of the 
world community creates an obligation to assist 
in the necessary funding of food and population 
programmes by both developing and developed 
countries. This calls for the elaboration and 
implementation of a global strategy by the 
United Nations and its family of agencies, 
including the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations and the 
United Nations Fund for Population Activities. 
4. Establish sufficient food reserves through 
national and international efforts to provide 
continuing vital insurance against food 
shortages. 
5. Recognize that, in our finite world where 
resources are limited, the family of man 
must one day, and hopefully fairly soon, bring 
birth-rates into reasonable balance with the 
lowered death-rates that have been achieved. 
Many governments see the need to guide 
national policy toward this objective. 
 
#x* Resolution 1672 of the United Nations Economic and Social 
Council, 1969. 
solution to the present world food crisis 
must be found within the next few years. 
The social transformation which can lead 
to a reduction in the world rate of fertility, 
along with lowering the rate of mortality, will 
take decades to accomplish. But a start must be 
made now because the millions of people being 
born each year place a heavy burden on the 
resources available to many nations for 
education, health, employment and the 
maintenance of environmental quality. 
A reduction in population growth could help 
alleviate this burden. Effective measures toward 
resolving both the world food and population 
problems must come within a total strategy of 
development. Not only is social and economic 
development desirable in itself, but also it 
contributes to moderating population growth. 
All these measures are designed to improve the 
quality of life. 
In this Declaration, we focus on food because 
it is the most critical of the pressures on the 
world today. It is the greatest manifestation 
of world poverty, which has many aspects. 
The absolute numbers of desperately poor are 
far greater today than ever before in history. 
The need to eradicate acute poverty is being 
recognized more than ever as a collective 
responsibility. It is a task which global 
partnership and the demands of social justice 
make imperative. 
We repeat, food is crucial because literally 
tens of millions of lives are suspended in the 
delicate balance between world population and 
world food supplies. Growing populations, 
denied sufficient food needed for survival, resist 
all efforts to secure a peaceful world. With 
increased production and more equitable 
distribution of food, the future could provide a 
prospect of less misery and more hope for 
countless people now deprived of the basic 
necessities that are their right. 
The World Food Conference represents a unique 
opportunity. This opportunity must not 
be missed. Comprehensive international 
agreements must be reached to assure at least 
minimal food supplies, with sufficient annual 
carry-over stocks. Disastrous breakdowns in the 
world food supply can thus be avoided. All 
nations may then rest secure in the knowledge 
thas this, the most critical of their immediate 
problems, is being attacked with wisdom, vigour 
and unity of purpose. 
In the name of humanity we call upon all 
governments and peoples everywhere, rich and 
poor, regardless of political and social systems, 
to act—to act together—and to act in time. n

H... beings use both 
water and land for food production; 
that is, the transformation of matter and 
energy—principally solar energy— 
into a form that can be utilized for 
the growth and replacement of human 
tissue and to supply energy for human 
metabolism. With a high level of agri- 
cultural technology, such as that ap- 
plied to corn growing in lowa, this 
process is about 0.4 per cent efficient. 
in other words, the food energy 
contained in the portion of the crop 
edible by humans is about 0.4 per cent 
of the solar energy received on the 
planted area in the growing season. 
A nearly minimum subsistence diet 
for human beings averages about 
2,500 kilocalories per person per day 
(a kilocalorie being the amount of heat 
required to raise the temperature of 
one kilogramme of water one degree 
centigrade).* From the amount of solar 
energy received by an lowa cornfield, 
it can be calculated that the food 
energy required by 24 human beings 
can be provided from one hectare at 
the level of agricultural technology 
employed in that region. 
To provide an adequate diet, in- 
cluding high quality protein and pro- 
tective foods such as fruit and vege- 
tables, the equivalent of 4,000 to 5,000 
kilocalories per person is desirable. At 
the lowa level of technology, therefore, 
every hectare of land might be 
expected to sustain, in principle, 12 to 
15 persons on an adequate diet. These 
figures are for a typical human, an 
* The prefix kilo 1s commonly omitted 
from the term kilocalorie, and the “calories” 
counted by dieters are in fact kilocalories.

average for men, women and children. 
In the world as a whole at the pre- 
sent time, there is one hectare of 
farm land for every 2.5 living persons, 
or nearly ten times the hypothetical 
minimum required for a subsistence 
diet. Several reasons explain this 
apparent excess. Allowing for fallow 
periods, the land actually harvested 
uuring any particular year is only about 
a half to two-thirds the total cultivated 
area. About ten per cent is devoted 
to non-food crops such as - cotton, 
tobacco, rubber, coffee, tea, jute, etc. 
Another large fraction is needed to 
produce food for livestock, which 
from our standpoint are only 10 to 
15 per cent efficient; that is, they use 
seven to ten times as much food 
energy as the energy contained in their 
edible products. Also, from 10 to 
20 per cent of food crops are destroyed 
by pests. 
The principal cause, however, is the 
low level of agricultural technology in 
most parts of the world. Instead of 
the 6.4 metric tons grown on a hectare 
in lowa, the average Indian or Pakis- 
tani farmer produces only a little more 
than one ton of wheat or rice. 
Large parts of the earth's surface 
are not now cultivated. The land sur- 
face of the earth outside the ice-cov- 
ered areas of Antarctica and Green- 
land contains about 13 billion hectares. 
Climatic and other conditions limit the 
potentially arable land to 2.9 billion 
hectares, or 22 per cent of the land 
surface of the earth, but this is still 
more than twice the present cultivated 
area, and more than three times the 
area actually harvested in any year.

had - al 
Without irrigation, three crops, in 
principle, could be grown each year 
in the humid tropics, and two crops in 
sub-humid regions. Elsewhere only 
one crop can be grown without irriga- 
tion. in all, the potential gross cropped 
area per year (the cultivated area times 
the number of crops), without irrigation, 
is 4.5 billion hectares. With irrigation, 
the gross cropped area could be 
considerably expanded. 
At present, irrigation takes little of 
the available supply. Less than four 
per cent of the total river flow in fact 
is used, to irrigate about one per cent 
of the land area of the earth. Most 
river waters flow to the sea almost 
unused by man, and more than half 
the water evaporating from the cont- 
inents plays little part in human life. 
The potential for irrigation is thus

very large, but it is limited by the 
uneven distribution of river runoff 
between the different regions. About 
a third of the total comes from South 
America with less than 15 per cent of 
the earth's land, while Africa, which 
contains 23 per cent of the land, yields 
only 12 per cent of the runoff. Runoff 
from south-west Asia, North Africa, 
Mexico, the south-western United 
States, temperate South America and 
Australia is less than five per cent of 
the total, yet these regions contain 
25 per cent of the land area. As a 
result, only 30 per cent of the potential 
can actually be irrigated, or about 
1.1 billion hectares. This would raise 
the potential gross cropped area to 
5.6 billion hectares. 
If all this land were cultivated, how 
many people could the earth feed?

About 10 per cent of the gross 
cropped area would still be needed to 
grow non-food crops. With appropriate 
technology and inputs of production 
equivalent to those used in lowa 
(irrigation water, fertilizer, high-yield- 
ing seeds, plant protection, farm tools, 
farm machinery and scientific farm 
practices), it can be simply calculated 
that the remaining hectares could 
provide a minimum subsistence diet of 
2,500 kilocalories a day for 100 billion 
people. That is after allowing 10 per 
cent for unavoidable losses and 
another three per cent for seed. To 
provide an adequate diet equivalent 
to 4,000 to 5,000 kilocalories, the po- 
tential gross cropped area would be 
sufficient for 50 to 60 billion people, or 
about 15 times the present human 
population of the earth. 
Setting aside the question of 
whether such a large population would 
be desirable or even possible from 
other points of view, we may ask what 
the obstacles are to such an expansion 
of the earth’s cultivated area. These 
are of several kinds. 
Firstly, some 1.5 billion hectares of 
the potential gross cropped area lie 
in regions where rainfall is more or 
less continuous throughout the year 
—the humid tropics. No technology 
exists today for intensive cultivation of 
these lands for food production. With 
few exceptions, farmers must still 
practise the ancient technique of 
“slash and burn” agriculture. 
The available evidence, however, 
supports the belief that with appro- 
priate technology the humid tropics 
could have a tremendous potential for 
food production. In the Congo (as it 
then was), an oil palm was developed 
which when properly grown yielded 
about 4,000 kilogrammes per hectare, 
whereas the ordinary palm yielded 
about 500 kilos. In the Amazon Valley 
peppers have been grown successfully 
by Japanese immigrants for at least 
20 years. ) 
Secondly, much potentially arable 
land is of poor quality. The savannas 4

### 50331: Can the earth feed the growing multitudes? Here is the biggest challenge facing mankind in our time

Right, the geometry of farming. The extraordinary 
pattern of fields seen here is formed by different 
crops grown in narrow strips so as to check wind 
or water erosion. Wider use of such techniques 
would enable millions of hectares of the world’s 
wasted land to be used for growing food. Bottom 
of page, where every morsel counts—an Asian 
  
p of South America, and the broad belt 
that extends across Africa just south 
of the Sahara, contain large areas of 
some of the most severely weathered 
and leached soils in the world. Their 
meagre supply of nutrients is barely 
enough to support cropping for two to 
four years, after which six to 12 years 
or more of fallow are needed. 
On the other hand, many of these 
soils are permeable to both air and 
water, easily penetrated by roots to 
great depth, easy to keep in good 
tilth and have at least-moderate water 
holding capacity. With adequate irri- 
gation, chemical fertilizers and soil 
conditioners, they could be made 
highly productive of a wide variety of 
food crops. 
Thirdly, large capital investment is 
required. Any major extension of the 
earth's cultivated area, even for sub- 
sistence farming, would require a huge 
capital input, of the order of $500 to 
$1,000 per hectare. The cost of putting 
all the potentially arable land outside 
the humid tropics into cultivation would 
thus be 500 to 1,000 billion dollars. 
The latter figure is about equal to the 
annual gross national product of the 
United States and twice that of all the 
less developed countries combined. 
Finally, population and potentially 
arable land are unevenly distributed. 
Most of the uncultivated but arable 
land outside the humid tropics is in 
the more sparsely populated cont- 
inents. In Europe, 88 per cent of the 
potential is already cultivated, in North 
America 53 per cent and in the 
U.S.S.R. 66 per cent. In Asia the 
figure is close to 100 per cent. On the 
other hand, only 16 per cent is as yet 
under the plough in thinly populated 
Australia and New Zealand, 21 per 
cent in South America and 32 per cent 
in Africa. 
10 These are the lands designated by 
the UN. Food and Agriculture Orga-’ 
nization (FAO) as “ arable land and 
land under permanent crops... includ- 
woman receives a carefully-weighed-out ration 
of oil cake to feed her livestock. 
ing land under crops, temporary fallow, 
temporary meadows for mowing and 
pastures, market and kitchen gardens, 
fruit trees, vines, shrubs and rubber 
plantations ". 
If one sets the areas cultivated 
against the number of mouths to feed, 
these disparities take on a grim sig- 
nificance. In Australia and New Zea- 
land, 1.4 hectares are farmed for 
every person; in Asia, only 0.3 of a 
hectare. In between come the U.S.S.R. 
with one hectare per person, North 
and South America with 0.9 and 04, 
respectively, Africa with 0.5 and Europe 
with 0.3. That is the position today, 
or rather in 1965. Twenty years later, 
anticipated population growth will have 
reduced the cultivated area per person 
in Asia to 0.2 of a hectare, even if 
every potential square inch is cropped. 
And the population will still be growing. 
This anticipated squeeze in Asia 
reflects the heavy population density 
of a continent containing more than 
half the world’s people and the already 
high percentage of the land under 
crops. If the Asian peoples are to 
obtain enough food, it will be necess- 
ary therefore to increase yields and 
wherever possible to grow two or 
three crops per year on each cultivated 
hectare, a development that will entail 
extensive irrigation. In Europe, too, 
the spare land is not there to counter 
the projected population increase, but 
here demographic growth is relatively 
fow and the population in any event 
is less than a quarter of Asia's. 
In other regions, the mobilization of 
unused land could more than offset 
population growth over the 20 year 
period. Australia and New Zealand, 
for example, could have 4.8 hectares 
per person cultivated by 1985 if all 
available land was put to use. Africa 
could have one hectare, North America 
1.4 hectares, South America 0.9 hec- 
tares, and the U.S.S.R. 1.2 hectares. 
These figures allow for projected popu- 
lation growth and do not include the 
humid tropics, but again, it should be

remembered, the population will not 
stop expanding in 1985. 
The largest areas of potentially 
arable land are in Africa and South 
America. Outside the humid tropics, 
630 million hectares with adequate 
water remain uncultivated in these 
continents. The limiting factors are 
not natural resources but economic, 
institutional and social-political prob- 
lems. In addition, over 300 million 
potentially arable but as yet uncultiva- 
ted hectares exist in North America 
and Australia. 
Higher technology depends on the 
ability of the farmers and the food 
industry to purchase many “inputs” 
or factors of production from outside 
the farm. At the lowa level of tech- 
nology, energy must be used from 
fossil fuels equal to about three-quar- 
ters of the food energy in the crops, 
about half of this energy consumption 
being represented by irrigation water 
and chemical fertilizers. At present, 
the less developed countries use, for

all purposes, an average of about 
400 kilogrammes of coal equivalent 
per person per year, corresponding to 
an annual use of three million kilo- 
calories per person. 
We have already seen that the aver- 
age human requires the equivalent of 
4,000 to 5,000 kilocalories a day for 
adequate nourishment. Hence, to meet 
his dietary needs adequately with high 
agricultural technology, a citizen in a 
less developed country would need 
to use for food production about a 
third of all the energy now available to 
him. The average person in developed 
countries already uses 14 times the 
fossil fuel energy required to meet his 
agricultural needs. 
For the next 20 to 30 years, a 
combined three-pronged strategy for 
the less developed countries of in- 
creasing multiple cropping, total culti- 
vated areas and yields from each crop, 
has been proposed by the FAO. It is 
estimated that with a total expenditure 
of 48 billion (1970) dollars, the gross 
value of crop production could be 
increased overall by 124 per cent 
between 1962 and 1985 in four devel- 
oping regions: Africa south of the 
Sahara, the Near East and north-west 
Africa, Asia and the Far East, and 
Latin America. 
The People’s Republic of China and 
other centrally planned economies 
were omitted from the FAQ study, but 
even so it covered 44 per cent of the 
world's 1962 population. This popula- 
tion was estimated to rise by 80 per 
cent through the plan period. Thus the 
projected increase in food production 
could forge well ahead of population 
growth during the 20 years, 
During the first eight years of the 
FAQ plan period, between 1963 and 
1971, total production of wheat, rice 
and maize in Asia, including 
People’s Republic of China, and Latin 
America did indeed increase at an 
annual rate of 3.5 per cent, or exactly 
the rate projected by the FAO for the 
23 year period 1962 to 1985. (The 
figures for Africa are incomplete). The 
corresponding annual rate of popu- 
lation growth in these regions was 
2.25 per cent. 
The per capita increase in cereal 
production in Asia and Latin America 
worked out at 15 per cent between 
1963 and 1971. Thus, average diets 
in those countries, although they are 
still close to subsistence level, are 
slowly improving. 
In the final analysis, we must 
recognize that not all land and water 
available for human use can be 
allocated to agriculture. Cities and 
their industries are also consumers of 
water. In India, for example, the 
Irrigation Commission estimates that 
17 per cent of the usable water will 
be needed for industrial and municipal 
use. The Commission's estimate of a 
total water use of 616 billion cubic 
metres for irrigating some 80 million 
gross cropped hectares is probably 
low and there may ultimately be a 
the

serious conflict for water between 
agricultural and industrial and muni- 
cipal users. 
To give another example, an intrinsic 
feature of the Aswan High Dam is that 
the water can be used for another 
principal purpose beside irrigation— 
hydro-electric power. For electric 
energy to be used effectively for 
industrial production, it must be gen- 
erated at a [sirly steady rate throughout 
the year. In cuntrast, agricultural needs 
for water vary widely from one season 
to another. Hence, if water is released 
from the Dam in such a way as to 
provide optimum economic benefits for 
agriculture, the large fluctuations would 
be far from optimum for industry. On 
the other hand, if the water is 
released in accordance with industrial 
demand, there would be toe much for 
agriculture in winter and not enough 
in summer, 
In this case, the Dam appears to be 
well adapted to satisfy a relatively 
high proportion of both needs. In 
Lower Egypt, there is an enormous 
reservoir of fresh underground water, 
equal in volume to several years flow 
of the Nile. Some part of this great 
underground store could be used for 
irrigation to supplement the water 
coming from Lake Nasser. 
Conflicts in land use must also be 
taken into account. In regions of tra- 
ditional nomad grazing such as the 
northwest frontier of Pakistan and the 
sub-Saharan savanna belt of Africa, 
establishment of modern high-intensity 
agriculture encounters serious difficult- 
ies, both from the cultural patterns of 
the people and the conflicting needs 
of cattlemen and farmers. 
Timber industries and agriculture 
also conflict in ways that may have 
serious economic consequences. A 
large fraction of present uncultivated 
land is now covered by forests, the 
clearing of which for low-yielding 
subsistence agriculture may represent 
a serious economic loss.

Many major irrigation projects, again, 
involve the construction of large dams 
and reservoirs, which often flood 
valuable lands with a high actual and 
potential agricultural value, apart from 
creating grave problems of resettling 
the agricultural peoples displaced. 
The growth of cities also commonly 
utilizes prime agricultural land. Fortu- 
nately, the total area of cities is usually 
under five per cent of the land area 
of even a highly urbanized country. 
Finally, the social consequences of 
an agricultural revolution cannot be 
ignored. National farm prices generally 
will almost certainly fall because of 
greatly expanded production in the 
regions in which the new technology 
has been successfully applied. The 
farmers in other regions may then be 
unable to obtain prices sufficient to

and other inputs needed for high- 
productivity agriculture. In these 
circumstances, they could be forced

would be insufficient to provide for

If that happens, large numbers of 
unskilled countrymen will migrate 
either to the towns or to the more 
favoured agricultural regions, where 
most of them will become landless 
labourers. Already, there is mass 
unemployment in the towns and no 
developing country has solved the 
problem of raising employment in the 
industrial sector as fast as the growing 
labour force. The challenge to policy- 
makers, either to develop new agri- 
cultural technologies for non-irrigated 
land, or to provide employment and a 
new way of life for these people, will 
have to be faced. n

RENE DUMONT is internationally known for 
his hard-hitting studies on the phght of rural 
populations in developing countries and what 
he considers the chaos of the world's econ- 
omic, social and agricultural situations. An 
agronomist by profession, he is professor of 
agriculture at the National Institute of Agron- 
omy in Paris. His books have appeared in 
many languages. “False Start in Africa” and 
“The Hungry Future” are published by Praeger, 
New York. His latest book, “L'Utopie ou la 
Mort” (Utopia or Death), published last year 
in French and Greek, will shortly appear in 
English. In May 1974, René Dumont was a 
candidate for the French presidency, and 
based his electoral campaign on the ecologi- 
cal issue. 
Te of millions of children 
in the poorer countries are being 
deprived of normal brain development 
as a result of a serious lack of 
essential proteins in their diet, This 
is perhaps the most heart-rending 
crime of our time, though it may not 
be the most spectacular or the best 
known. [f present inequalities in food 
distribution continue, untold millions of 
children will suffer cerebral under- 
development in the decades ahead. 
Those who for a long time have 
opposed any kind of contraception, 
and who still reject certain forms such 
as abortions in the early stages of 
pregnancy, unwittingly bear a large 
share of responsibility for this intol- 
erable situation. But they are not 
alone. The blame must be shared by 
all who help to perpetuate an increas- 
ingly inadmissible social situation. 
The tragedy is that there would be 
  
a 
u ER Ee] 
more than enough protein sources in 
the world to satisfy the minimum needs 
of all today's children if these sub- 
stances were distributed rationally and 
equally. What happens is that they are 
shared out almost solely in proportion 
to financial resources, and this leads 
to appalling waste. 
Powdered milk, for example, is one 
of the best sources of protein, but 
much of it goes to animals, Over 
30 per cent of the world fish catch is 
transformed into flour—and the per- 
centage is rising—and most of it is 
used for animal fodder. A good milk 
cow consumes six grammes of veg- 
etable protein for every gramme of 
milk protein it produces. The wastage 
is even higher for beef cattle. 
Thus, like mineral and petroleum 
reserves, which are also limited, the 
semi-rare protein resources of the 
world are being woefully squandered

by wealthy countries at the expense 
of poor ones. 
If proteins were distributed more 
fairly there would be enough to go 
round, but this would mean a certain 
amount of austerity in the eating 
habits of the rich, which in turn would 
presuppose a social revolution pat- 
terned to some degree on that of China. 
A Food and Agriculture Organization 
nutrition expert has shown that if we 
tried to combat undernourishment 
simply by increasing production without 
altering distribution, we should have to 
increase the food production of the 
so-called developing countries sixfold 
between 1970 and the year 2000, a 
task which is obviously impossible. 
The first conclusion to be drawn is 
this: if we really wish to overcome 
malnutrition, it is absolutely essential 
to improve food distribution by making 
it no longer depend on the buying

power of the individual. it has been 
calculated that present world food 
production would only satisfy—or 
should we say gorge—a billion persons 
if they were all to eat as much as most 
people in the United States do. And 
the world’s population is almost four 
billion alreadyl Current industrial 
output, moreover, could only satisfy 
600 million such avid consumers, 
Our world has gone mad. It has 
lost all control, both over its population 
growth and its production techniques. 
In some places people are over- 
worked, while more and more young 
people in the Third World are un- 
employed. Above all there is the 
unbridled rise of the consumer society, 
most blatantly exemplified by the cult 
of the private motor car. 
Attempts to boost food production 
alone are therefore not enough, though 
they remain none the less an absolute 
must. This, of course, is the specific 
task of agronomists like myself, 
When the FAO completed its Indica- 
tive World Plan in 1969-1970, it esti- 
mated that the “backward” countries 
would have to achieve an agricultural 
growth rate of 3.8 per cent per year 
in order to eliminate most of their 
malnutrition by 1985, the end of the 
period under consideration. 
Twelve years have now gone by 
since the beginning of the base year, 
1962, and in those twelve years these 
countries have fallen further behind. 
Although it is difficult to make a 
precise assessment, it seems more 
than likely that the poor countries are, 
on average, as undernourished as they 
were before the Second World War. 
It even seems quite probable that the 
poorer classes in India, Bangladesh 
and most of the Andean mountain 
regions are less well nourished than 
they were in the eighteenth century, 
periods of famine apart. 
In 1970, which marked the beginning 
of the Second Development Decade, 
it was foreseen that an annual growth 
rate of 4 per cent in food production 
would be necessary in order to make 
up for the accumulated deficit. But 
at the end of November 1972, Mr. A. H. 
Boerma, Director-General of FAQ, 
pointed out that in the first two years 
of the decade the increase in food 
production had barely exceeded 1 per 
cent a year whereas population in the 
countries concerned had increased by 
over 2.5 per cent. 
Unless an extraordinary effort was 
made, he concluded, unless a miracle 
took place, the Second Development 
Decade was already doomed to fail in 
agriculture. Miracles, alas, are not the 
agronomist's speciality; he is much too 
realistic and down to earth to envisage 
such possibilities. 
He can only issue a serious warning 
to any demographers who still think 
it impossible to bring about a rapid 
reduction in population growth and 
who consider the ageing of society 
more ominous than over-population. 
He may also address a timely word to 
governments responsible for civic 
education, a tool of which far more 
use could be made. 
if the experts are unable to work 
out a co-ordinated programme designed 
to halt population increase, then we 
face the prospect of a series of 
catastrophes, whose precise nature no 
one can predict at this stage. Everyone 
has a responsibility in this matter, 
The Green Revolution, it is true, gave 
promise of miracles, and it would be 
wrong to underestimate its achieve- 
ments. New tropical cereal seeds, 
including wheat, rice and maize, now 
have a potential comparable to those 
of their counterparts in the temperate 
zones—a dramatic change from the 
situation twenty years ago. 
From Mexico to Pakistan and north- 
west India, the so-called Mexican 
wheat, cultivated in irrigated fields, 
often on a large scale, by farmers 
who have financial backing and new 
techniques at their disposal, has been 
a great success. In India alone wheat 
production jumped from 12 to 26 million 
tons in a six-year period. 
The picture is more mixed in the 
rice fields. In the Philippines the rate 
of growth of the new miracle rice is 
still erratic. In Java, Sri Lanka (Ceylon), 
Bangladesh and India the yields of the 
seeds developed at the International 
Rice Research Institute at Los Barfios 
(Philippines) have so far been ex- 
tremely disappointing. 
Too many rice fields in these 
countries are still only rain-fed, un- 
levelled and dependent on the irregu- 
larities of the monsoon. When the 
government builds an irrigation net- 
work, it sometimes leaves the farmers 
to install the final channels to connect 
their land to the water mains, and 
this they usually fail to do. 
In Sri Lanka, on the other hand, p 
“Every car you buy—usually long before you have worn out the one 
you ‘ve got—means that farmers in the tropics will have so much less 
steel for the ploughs they desperately need to lighten their burden 
and increase their productivity”.

irrigation water is provided free of 
charge, or virtually so, and hence it 
is distressingly wasted. Each hectare 
receives three or four times as much 
water as it needs, and this means that 
three or four fewer harvests are being 
irrigated. Employment is consequently 
on the down grade. 
The existence of 800,000 unemployed 
in this little country caused its young 
“intellectuals™ to revolt. In point of 
fact, they are more interested in a 
steady office job than standing bare- 
foot in the mud of the rice paddies, 
like their Chinese counterparts. 
In Bangladesh only 320,000 hectares, 
out of a total of nine million under 
cultivation, are irrigated in the dry 
season, yet this is the most favourable 
period for watering. If all the pumps 
and tubed wells that are available 
were fully used, it would be possible 
to irrigate three times as much land, 
but these facilities are rented to 
farmers for a tenth of their cost and 
only a third of their capacity is used. 
To cap all, a number of them are 
completely out of order and those in 
charge of them have little incentive to 
repair them, since they know that they 
will receive their wages in any event. 
There are also 250,000 hectares 
of ponds and reservoirs in Bangla- 
desh, but three-quarters of their 
area—190,000 hectares—have gradu- 
ally become choked with earth. If 
they were excavated to an average 
depth of two metres or more, 4,000 
million cubic metres of food-producing 
water would immediately collect, since 
these pools could be stocked with 
fish or used as irrigation reservoirs. 
This project would provide 2,000 
million man-days, or in other words, 
100 extra days of work over a period 
of five years for four million landless 
men—who at present are unemployed 
for just such a period every year. 
The increase In the irrigation po- 
tential thus achieved would then bring 
about full employment—provided, of 
course, that the population explosion 
was halted. The cost could easily be 
met by levying a property tax on the 
rice fields and on disused reservoirs, 
and allowing for a moderate rate of 
inflation (as in Germany in 1933). 
A report by the World Bank, 
however, states that “reasonable 
expectations” for Bangladesh are a 
population that will amount to 140- 
170 million inhabitants by the year 2000, 
with “a total percentage of rural un- 
employment remaining constant at 
30 per cent, in the 30 years between 
1970 and 2000." The report takes no 
account of the possible mobilization 
of the labour of the rural population, 
and all the extensions to the irrigation 
system it foresees will be provided 
by external aid. Similarly, increased 
output will be the result of using 
chemical fertilizers and insecticides, 
with little effort being made to utilize 
organic fertilizers and other means. 
As early as 1960 a vast co-operative’ 
experiment was made in Bangladesh— 
then East Pakistan—by grouping small 
farmers who owned at least one acre 
of land into village co-operatives 
where they could deposit their savings, 
borrow money and find an organized 
community framework. 
A meeting was held each week at 
which everyone deposited a quarter 
of a rupee—about $0.13 at the current 
official rate of exchange—in his sav- 
ings account, listened to the advice 
which the “model-farmer” of the village 
had obtained from the technicians of 
the district, etc. Substantial loans 
were soon granted to try to spread 
the Green Revolution more quickly. 
But repayment began to lag in 1967 
and a number of village co-operatives 
are now in a state of actual or virtual 
bankruptcy. The production of IR 8 
rice and vegetables has considerably 
increased, but most of the farmers 
even in the vicinity of Comilla, which 
was the hub of this experiment and 
gave it its name, were still in debt 
to private money-lenders when | visited 
them in January 1973. 
The landless 20 per cent of the 
population and the 25 per.cent who 
own less than one acre are not ad- 
mitted to the co-operatives and are 
sometimes excluded from other advan- 
tages. Tenant farmers are still obliged 
to turn over half of the harvest to a 
landowner who usually does not con- 
tribute to cultivation costs. Landless 
persons can find work as hired hands 
for only eight months a year; during 
the other four, they say, “we eat one 
meal a day instead of three.” 
How is it possible to turn the unem- 
ployment of this half of the population 
to account so long as most of their 
earnings continue to go to the land- 
owners, the money-lenders and trades- 
men? Women are traditionally confined 
to the house and its precincts because 
they would be disgraced if they went 
out to the fields, yet in China, Vietnam 
and India, women take part in replant- 
ing, weeding and harvesting. 
In the northern part of Senegal, in 
the region around Louga, when tradi- 
tional methods of cultivation were 
used, the land was allowed to lie 
fallow for long periods of time and 
this kept the soil structure in good 
condition. With the unchecked in- 
crease in population and in the acreage 
which had to be devoted to the ground- 
nut crop, fallow land has been reduced 
—indeed, in the already overpopulated 
area inhabited by the Serer people, 
sometimes even totally eliminated— 
and thus the amount of humus in the 
soil has been reduced. 
As a result, the less solid compo- 
nents, such as fine sand and loam, 
are not held firmly in the soil, but get 
blown away by the wind. What remains 
is mostly coarse sand which does not 
retain the water from the all too irre- 
gular and infrequent rainfalls. A simi- 
lar situation is found in the semi-arid 
belt that stretches across Africa from 
Mauritania to Chad and the Sudan, 
and south to Tanzania.

"The top-priority task for our gen- 
eration ought to be to triple food 
production between now and the 
year 2000... To speed up agricultural 
development is now a basic aim for 
all the nations in the Third World".

1972 caused a wholesale loss of 
cattle. Over-pasturing has destroyed 
all vegetation in the proximity of wells. 
Farther away some dry grass still 
grows but there is no water to drink. 
Some cattle are therefore doomed to 
die either from hunger or thirst. Mean- 
while the inhabitants of these regions 
are suffering great privations and are 
dying in increasing numbers. 
The vast agricultural expanses of the 
Soviet Union—one hectare per inhab- 
itant plus extensive pasture-land and 
forests—can, of course, be greatly 
affected by cold and drought. Never- 
theless, the country should have been 
able to accumulate enough grain 
reserves, after the excellent harvests 
in 1970 and 1971, to avoid the necessity 
of buying so much wheat in 1972- 
1973. What it did purchase, mainly 
because it feeds its cattle on grain, 
is no longer available for famine- 
stricken areas elsewhere, and these 
areas can no longer pay the high prices 
caused by world shortages. 
The well-to-do countries eat too 
much meat produced from cereals and 
are therefore unable to give proper 
aid to the poorer countries. A world 
sugar shortage is also impending, and 
the scarcity of beef is going to make 
the inequalities between rich and poor 
even more glaring. 
Since 1960 some effort has been 
made in Central America to raise cattle 
production on the latifundia where the 
pastos naturales (natural pasture- 
lands) had an incredibly low output. 
In the western part of the Venezuelan 
state of Guarico which lies within the 
llanos of the Orinoco River, | estimated 
in 1959 that one hectare yielded 5 kg. 
of meat (live weight) per yearl 
The large estates in Guatemala, par- 
ticularly, have since improved their 
pastos and installed slaughter-houses 
so that they can export their beef, 
boned and refrigerated, to the United 
States where consumption by the well- 
off, who form the greater part of the 
population, is constantly rising. 
Increased exportation has naturally 
driven the price of meat up at home 
and this has led to a drop in con- 
sumption, to between 11 and 15 kg. a 
year per person in many places, in a 
country where the great majority are 
already poor enough. The disparity in 
protein nourishment between the pri- 
vileged few and the many who remain 
poor, or who are becoming poorer, is 
therefore constantly widening. 
These new resources thus do not by 
any means constitute, as was hoped, 
a springboard for agricultural develop- 
ment and thus for the national economy 
as a whole. Where land is so unevenly 
distributed, the great majority of the 
holdings are inevitably too small to 
be able to feed the livestock they are 
required to support. Small farmers 
have 15 per cent of the country's 
cattle, but they own only 3 per cent 
of the grazing lands and are without 
the means to improve them.

lands of “Indian” (as opposed to 
“Latin") America is thus largely left 
dormant and unproductive, The Brazil- 
ian “miracle”, like the Green Revolu- 
tion in India, is only making the rich 
richer and the poor poorer. 
It does not leave the small producers 
the minimum buying power that would 
stimulate a widespread development of 
vegetable gardening and hence a more 
general revitalization of agriculture. 
Central and South America, which are 
so rich in potential resources, are not 
even able to make their food produc- 
tion keep pace with their population 
growth. The agrarian reform in Peru 
is an attempt to redress this situation, 
so far without brilliant results. 
It was thought in 1950 that educa- 
tion was the key factor in all develop- 
ment, even more Important than the 
accumulation of capital. It is indeed 
true that capital, to be used to good 
effect, requires a wealth of knowledge. 
The crime of crimes was com- 
mitted, however, when the schools 
began teaching—or at any rate ins- 
tilling in students—a disdain for ma- 
nual labour, especially that of the 
farmer, who was “soiled” with mud 
or dust, depending on the season. In 
a traditionally stratified society, work 
on the land was already generally 
considered sufficiently “degrading”. 
The farmer's children, anxious for 
social advancement, consequently— 
and in a sense, rightly—wished to rise 
above such “degradation” and this led 
them to see in school a means of 
escaping from their dependence on 
the land. As a result, schools in the 
tropics have been swelling the num-- 
bers of the unemployable. 
The Chinese model is more interest- 
ing. In China all children begin their 
education in an environment where 
work and study are constantly blended, 
and this, together with their civic train- 
ing, helps inculcate in them a respect 
for work—and for workers. 
Wage differences are kept to a 
minimum, which prevents the import- 
ing of luxury items. “Relying on its 
own strength” and "walking on its own 
two feet”, China is modernizing its 
technology only to the extent that 
this does not cause unemployment or 
require too much buying abroad. Out 
of necessity all by-products are used 
and therefore it wastes much less than 
richer countries. 
This is not to say that | consider 
China to be politically and econo- 
mically perfect. Its rate of agricultural 
development seems low to me, and 
even somewhat lower than | thought 
might be expected from the total re- 
organization of the agrarian structure 
and the wide extension of irrigation. 
More than two-thirds of Chinese 
fields are irrigated, compared with 
only slightly over a quarter of the 
fields in India, yet China's harvest 
was only twice that of India, even in a 
dry year (1972), for something like 750 
million inhabitants. China, however, 
is developing its agriculture without 
unemployment and without foreign aid. 
Admittedly an exact duplication of the 
Chinese model elsewhere would be 
ill-advised. Fundamental differences, 
such as historical heritage, traditional 
outlook, social structure, and espe- 
cially recent political history, must all 
be taken into account. 
Fo He

China is not a country or a nation 
in the Western sense of those terms. 
It is a continent, very much larger and 
more populous than the whole of 
Europe. [It has abundant natural 
resources—which it has skilfully 
located and learned to exploit—and 
lives largely cut off from outside 
influences. 
None the less, many of the princi- 
ples followed in China deserve to be 
studied, to see whether, and to what 
extent, they can be adapted else- 
where. Let there be no mistake on 
one point, however: they will often 
require as an inescapable condition 
the abolition of privileges, and conse- 
quently a genuine social revolution. 
Even without a revolution on the 
Chinese model, there are many ways 
in which education might be comple- 
tely transformed, as it must be if there 
is to be the kind of general change 
in outlook that would lead to a more 
egalitarian society. Hu

Te dangerous fallacies 
appear to be widespread with regard 
to population growth, environmental 
deterioration and resource depletion. 
The first is that the absolute size 
and rate of growth of the human popu- 
lation has little or no relationship to 
the rapidly escalating ecological prob- 
lems facing mankind. 
The second is that environmental 
deterioration consists primarily of 
“ pollution ”, which is perceived as a 
locai and reversible phenomenon of 
concern mainly for its effects on 
human health. 
The third fallacy is that science and 
technology can overcome all prob- 
lems arising from the scale and rate" 
of growth. 
Environmental problems can be 
classified according to the direct or 
indirect nature of the damage to 
human beings. 
Direct assaults include obvious

damage to health, damage to goods 
and services, social disruption (for 
example, displacement of people by 
mining operations or hydroelectric pro- 
jectsy-and effects on what people per- 
ceive as their “quality of life”, such as 
congestion, noise and litter. 
Indirect harm is caused by interfer- 
ence with the services provided for 
society by natural biological systems. 
Examples are diminution of ocean pro- 
ductivity by pollution of coastal waters 
and acceleration of erosion by logging 
or overgrazing. 
Most of the attention devoted to 
environmental matters has been 
focused on the direct effects. This is 
only natural, It would be wrong, 
however, to interpret limited legislative 
and technical progress toward amelio- 
rating the direct symptoms of environ- 
mental damage as evidence that so- 
ciety is on its way to an orderly reso- 
lution of its environmental problems. 
The most serious threats of all may 
well prove to be the indirect ones 
generated by man's disruption of the 
functioning of the natural environment. 
The most obvious services provided 
for humanity by the natural environ- 
ment have to do with food production. 
The fertility of the soil is maintained 
by the plants, animals, and micro- 
organisms that participate in the great 
nutrient cycles, and soil itself is pro- 
duced by the joint action of bacteria, 
fungi, worms, soil mites, and insects. 
The best protection against erosion of 
soil and flooding is natural vegetation. 
Insects pollinate most vegetables, 
fruits, and berries. Most fish—the 
source of 10 to 15 per cent of the ani- 
mal protein consumed by mankind— 
are produced in the natural environ- 
ment, unregulated by man. Most 
potential crop pests—one competent 
estimate is 99 per cent—are held in 
check not by man but by their natural

Insecticides and pesticides are 
beneficial in many respects, not 
only helping to reduce the ravages 
of malaria and other insect-borne 
diseases in many parts of the world, 
but also by increasing food production 
output, However, the excessive use 
of pesticides, herbicides and 
chemical fertilizers in recent years, 
in the face of over-exploitation of land 
as a result of population growth, 
is Impoverishing the soil, poliuting 
water and seriously threatening 
the world's ecological balance.

enemies and by the environment (tem- 
perature, moisture, availability of 
breeding sites). Some agents of human 
disease also are controlled principally 
not by medical technology but by 
environmental conditions. 
At many stages of the nutrient cy- 
cles, organisms accomplish what hu- 
mans have not yet learned to do 
—the complete conversion of wastes 
into resources. Human society de- 
pends on these natural processes to 
recycle many of its own wastes, such 
as sewage, detergents and industrial 
effluents. The environmental concen- 
trations of ammonia, nitrites and hy- 
drogen sulphide—all poisonous—are 
biologically controlled. 
These public-service functions of the . 
global environment cannot be replaced 
by technology now or in the foresee- 
able future. The sheer size of the task 
dwarfs civilization's capacity to finance, 
produce and deploy new technology. 
The day is far away when food for 
billions will be grown on synthetic 
nutrients in greenhouses free of pests 
and plant diseases, when the wastes 
of civilization will be recycled entirely

by technological means, and when all 
mankind will live in surroundings as 
sterile and as thoroughly managed 
as those of an Apollo space capsule. 
Until that improbable future arrives 
—and it may never come—the ser- 
vices provided by the orderly operation 
of natural biological processes will 
continue to be irreplaceable as well 
as indispensable. 
Ecological disruption on a large 
scale by human beings is not a new 
phenomenon. One of the best known 
early examples is the conversion to 
desert of the lush Tigris and Euphrates 
valleys, through erosion and salt accu- . 
mulation resulting from faulty irrigation 
practices. Overgrazing and poor culti- 
vation practices have contributed over 
the millenia to the expansion of the 
Sahara Desert, a process that con- 
tinues today. 
Much of Europe and Asia were 
deforested by pre-industrial men, 
beginning in the Stone Age; heavy 
erosion, recurrent flooding and the 
nearly permanent loss of a valuable 
resource were the result. Overgrazing 
by the Navajo has destroyed large 
tracts of once prime pastureland in 
the American southwest. 
Attempts to cultivate too intensively 
the fragile soils of tropical rainforest 
areas are suspected of being at least 
in part responsible for the collapse of 
the Mayan civilization in Central 
America and that of the Khmers in 
what today is Cambodia. 
Agriculture is a simplifier of ecosys- 
tems, replacing complex natural bio- 
logical communities with relatively 
simple man-made ones based on a 
few strains of crops. Being less com- 
plex, agricultural communities tend to 
be less stable than their natural coun- 
terparts; they are vulnerable to inva- 
sions by weeds, insect pests and plant 
diseases, and they are particularly 
sensitive to variations of climate. 
The Irish potato famine of the last 
century is perhaps the best known 
example of the collapse of a single 
agricultural ecosystem. The heavy 
reliance on a single crop led to 
1.5 million deaths when the potato 
monoculture fell victim to a fungus.

in the last hundred years have aggra- 
vated the ecological dilemma. The 
dilemma can be summarized thus: civi- 
lization tries to maximize productivity, 
while nature operates in a way that 
maximizes stability, and the two goals 
are incompatible. 
Ecological research has shown that 
the most complex and therefore most 
stable ecosystems have the smallest 
net productivity. In short, productivity 
is achieved at the expense of stability. 
Yet mankind must practise agriculture. 
A tendency toward instability must be 
accepted and, where possible, com- 
pensated for by technology. But the 
trends in modern agriculture are espe- 
cially worrisome ecologically. 
There are four major liabilities. 
® As larger and larger areas are 
given over to farming, the areas left to 
carry out the public-service functions 
of natural ecosystems become smaller 
and fewer. 
@® Pressure to expand the area under 
agriculture is leading to attempts to 
cultivate land that is unsuitable for 
cultivation with the technologies at 
hand. To give but one example among 
many, attempts to apply the techniques 
of temperate-zone agriculture to the 
tropical soils of Brazil and southern 
Sudan have led to erosion, loss of 
nutrients, and degradation into the 
rock-like material called laterite. 
@ Attempts to maximize yields have 
led to dramatic increases in the use 
of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers. 
@® These attempts have led also to 
the replacement of a wide variety of 
traditional crop varieties all over the 
world with a few, specially bred 
strains. Unprecedented areas are now 
planted with a single variety of wheat 
or rice. This has increased both the 
probability and the potential magnitude

havoc with life in lakes and rivers

asphyxiating aquatic plants. Chemists 
are trying to develop new kinds of 
non-harmful detergents. The damage 
caused by industrial waste Is 
another formidable problem facing 
modern society today.

2 of epidemic crop failure from insects 
or from disease. 
A continuing industrial revolution 
has multiplied many times over both 
the magnitude and variety of the 
substances introduced into the bio- 
logical environment by man. These 
may be classified as qualitative pollu- 
tants (synthetic substances produced 
and released only by man) and quanti- 
tative pollutants (natural substances 
released by man in significant addi- 
tional amounts). 
Well known qualitative pollutants 
are the chlorinated hydrocarbon pesti- 
cides, such as DDT, and some herbi- 
cides. These substances are biologi- 
cally active, but since natural orga- 
nisms have had no experience with 
them over evolutionary time they are 
usually not easily biodegradable. 
Their potential for disruption of eco- 
systems is enormous. 
There are three criteria by which 
quantitative pollutants may be judged 
significant. 
@® Man can perturb a natural cycle 
with a large amount of a substance 
ordinarily considered innocuous, as we 
do when we over-fertilize. 
® A relatively small amount of a 
substance can cause great damage if 
released in a sensitive spot, over a 
small area, or suddenly—for example, 
the destruction of coral reefs in 
Hawaii by silt from construction sites. 
@® Any addition of a substance that 
can be harmful at its natural concen- 
tration must be considered significant. 
Some radioactive substances fall in 
this category. 
The effects on the public-service 
functions performed by ecosystems 
are varied and serious. Food chains, 
for example, are shortened by the 
selective loss of the predators at the 
top. This is so because predators are

more sensitive to environmental stres- 
ses of all kinds than are herbivores. 
In marine ecosystems the top pre- 
dators are generally precisely the food 
fishes most highly prized by man. On 
land the loss of predators releases 
checks on herbivorous pests that 
compete with man for his supply of 
staple crops, a good example being 
the increase of cotton pests in parts 
of Peru. The loss of structure also in- 
creases the load on the process of 
decay, already heavily stressed by 
man’s domestic and agricultural wastes. 
The ocean, indispensable as a 
source of animal protein, may be the 
most vulnerable ecosystem of all. Its 
vast bulk is deceiving. Over 99 per 
cent of the ocean's productivity takes 
place beneath 10 per cent of its sur- 
face area, and half of the productiv- 
ity is concentrated in coastal up- 
wellings amounting to only 0.1 per 
cent of the surface. 
The reason is that productivity 
requires nutrients, which are most 
abundant near the bottom, and sun- 
light, available only near the top. 
Only in shallow waters are both avail- 
able in the same place. The coastal 
regions also receive most of the oil 
spills, fallout from atmospheric pollu- 
tants and river outflow bearing pesti- 
cide and fertilizer residues, heavy 
metals and industrial chemicals. 
Overfishing is almost certainly also 
taking a heavy toll in the ocean. 
Since World War Il, the catches of the 
East Asian sardine, the California sar- 
dine, the north-west Pacific salmon, 
the Scandinavian herring and the Ba- 
rents Sea cod, among others, have 
entered declines from which there has 
been no sign of recovery. Present 
world fisheries production of somewhat 
over 60 million metric tons per year 
is already approaching the 100 million 
that some marine biologists consider 
to be the maximum sustainable yield.

### 50337: Man is courting ecological disaster; 'if population growth proceeds unabated, averting catastrophe will be impossible'

Many people still imagine that 
mankind is a puny force in the global 
scale of things. This is not so. As a 
geological and biological force, man- 
kind is today becoming comparable to 
and even exceeding many natural 
processes. 
Qil added to the oceans in 1969 
from tanker spills, offshore production, 
routine shipping operations and refin- 
ery wastes exceeded natural seepage 
by an estimated 20 times. 
Man is now contributing half as 
much as nature to the atmospheric 
sulphur burden and will be contribut- 
ing as much as nature by the year 
2000. In industrial areas, the input 
of sulphur dioxide so overwhelms 
natural removal processes that in- 
creased concentrations are being 
found hundreds to thousands of 
kilometres downwind. 
Combustion of fossil fuels has in- 
creased the global atmospheric con- 
centration of carbon dioxide by 10 per 
cent since the turn of the century. 
Such figures do not prove that 
disaster is upon us, but they are 
cause for uneasiness. Mankind is for 
the first time operating on a level at 
which global balances could hinge on 
our mistakes. 
At least one environmental problem 
is absolutely intractable, and that is 
the discharge of waste heat which 
accompanies consumption of energy. 
All the energy we use—as well as that 
we waste in. generating electricity— 
ultimately enters the environment as 
waste heat. Obvious examples are 
the heat from a light bulb and the heat 
from an automobile engine. 
The heat production resulting from 
man’s use of energy is not yet a 
significant fraction of the solar energy 
at the earth's surface over the world 
as a whole. Even if the present five 
per cent per annum rate of increase

persists, it will take another century 
before civilization is discharging heat 
equivalent to one per cent of solar 
radiation. Considerably sooner, how- 
ever, it could become a significant 
influence on regional and continental 
climate. 
Human heat production already 
exceeds 5 per cent of solar radiation 
over local areas of tens of thousands 
of square kilometres, and could exceed 
this level over areas of millions of 
square kilometres by the year 2000. 
Such figures could imply substantial 
climatic disruptions. 
Man also has the potential to dis- 
rupt climate through additions of 
various pollutants to the atmosphere. 
The consequences of climatic altera- 
tion reside not in any direct sensi- 
tivity of humans to moderate changes 
in temperature or moisture, but rather 
in the great sensitivity of food pro- 
duction to such changes.

### 50337: Man is courting ecological disaster; 'if population growth proceeds unabated, averting catastrophe will be impossible'

) The effect of climate on agriculture 
24 
was once again being dramatically 
demonstrated in early 1973. Famine 
was widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, 
and was starting in India. South-east 
Asia had small rice harvests, parts of 
Latin America were short of food. 
Crops were threatened in the United 
States and the Soviet Union. Over- 
population is dramatically demon- 
strated in mankind's inability to store 
sufficient carry-over food supplies in 
anticipation of the climatic events 
which are a regular feature of the 
planet Earth, 
How and how much do population 
variables themselves contribute to 
ecological problems? The most ele- 
mentary relation is that population size 
acts as a multiplier of the environ- 
mental damage caused by each indi- 
vidual. The important point here is 
that slowly growing factors, when they 
multiply each other, lead to rapidly 
growing products. 
A simple example is the emission 
of lead into the atmosphere by auto- 
mobiles in the United States. Vehicle- 
miles per person doubled between 
1946 and 1967, while emissions of lead 
per vehicle-mile increased 83 per cent. 
The United States population increased 
41 per cent. The result was that more 
than five times as much lead was 
being discharged into the atmosphere 
as 20 years before, and this dramatic 
increase arose from rather moderate 
but simultaneous 
contributing factors. 
There is however a. more difficult 
and perhaps more important question 
than this arithmetical one. A small 
increase in population may generate a 
large increase in environmental dis- 
ruption. These effects fall into two 
classes. First, population change may 
itself cause changes in consumption 
per person. Second, a small increase 
in impact upon the environment 
—generated in part by population 
change and in part by changes in the 
other multiplicative factors—may sti- 
mulate a disproportionately large en- 
vironmental change. 
An obvious example is the growth 
of suburbs in the United States, which 
has had the effect of increasing the 
use of the automobile. Another is 
that of diminishing returns in agri- 
culture, in which the increases in 
yield needed to feed new mouths can 
be achieved only by disproportionate 
increases in inputs such as fertilizer 
and pesticides. In each case, the 
contributing factors can no longer be 
considered to be independent. It is 
what the mathematicians call a non-

response of individual organisms to 
poisons and other forms of stress. 
Fish may be able to tolerate a 10-de- 
gree rise in water temperature without 
ill effect, whereas a 12-degree rise 
would be fatal. 
Another non-linear phenomenon is 
the simultaneous action of two or more 
inputs. A disturbing example is the 
combined effect of DDT and oil spills 
in coastal waters. DDT is not very 
soluble in sea water, so the concen- 
trations to which marine organisms 
are ordinarily exposed are small. 
However, DDT is very soluble in oil. 
Oil spills therefore have the effect of 
concentrating DDT in the surface layer 
of the ocean where much of the oil 
remains, and where many marine 
organisms spend part of their time. 
As a result, the combined effect of 
oil and DDT probably far exceeds 
their individual effects. 
Some forms of non-linearity would 
occur eventually whether population 
grew or not, For example, a constant

demand for copper that persisted for 
a long time would lead eventually to 
substitution of other metals in some 
applications. In such instances, popu- 
lation growth accelerates the onset of 
diminishing returns, so leaving less 
time to deal with the problems and 
increasing the chances of mistakes. 
In other cases, such as the effects of 
population concentration on certain 
forms of consumption, population 
change is clearly the sole and direct 
cause of the non-linear response. 
All rational observers agree that no 
physical quantity can grow forever. 
This is true of population, the produc- 
tion of energy and other raw materials 
and the generation of wastes. But is 
there anything about the 1970s—as 
opposed, say to the 1920s or 1870s— 
to make this the decade in which 
limits to growth become apparent? 
When limits do appear, they will 
appear suddenly. Such behaviour is 
typical of exponential growth; that is, 
where the quantity multiplies at a 
  
more or less constant rate—with 
compound interest, so to speak. If a 
quantity can double 20 times before 
a limit is reached, the system will be 
less than half loaded for the first 
nineteen doublings, or for 95 per cent 
of the time between initiation of growth 
and exceeding the limit. Clearly, then, 
a long history of exponential growth 
does not imply a long future. 
The human population is growing at 
a rate that would double our numbers 
in 35 years, and ecological impact is 
growing even faster. The 1970 Study 
of Critical Environmental Problems, 
sponsored by the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, estimated that 
man's demands upon the biological 
environment are increasing at about 
five per cent per year, corresponding 
to a doubling time of 14 years. Con- 
tinuation of this rate implies that, if 
the environment could absorb, say, as 
much as 32 times the 1970 level of 
damaging inputs, the limit would be 
reached by the year 2040. 
The likelihood of overshooting the 
limit is increased by the momentum 
of population growth, by time-delays 
between cause and effect in many 
environmental systems, and by the fact 
that some kinds of damage are irre- 
versible by the time they are visible. 
The momentum of human population 
growth has its origins in deep-seated 
attitudes toward reproduction and in 
the age composition of the world's 
population, 37 per cent being under 
15 years of age. Even if every couple 
in the world henceforth had only the 
number of children needed to replace 
themselves, the imbalance between 
young and old would cause population 
to grow for 50 to 70 years more before 
leveling off. Under extraordinarily 
optimistic assumptions, world popula- 
tion could not stabilize below eight 
billion people. 
Environmental time delays come 
about in a variety of ways. Some 
substances persist in dangerous form 
long after they have been introduced 
into the environment. Mercury, lead, 
DDT and its relatives and certain 
radioactive materials are obvious 
examples. They may be entering food 
chains from soil, water and marine 
sediments for years after being de- 
posited there. Time lags usually mean 
that when the symptoms finally appear, 
corrective action is ineffective or 
impossible. Species that have been 
eradicated cannot be restored. Soil 
that has been washed or blown away 
can be replaced by natural processes 
only on a time scale of centuries. 
The momentum of growth, the time 
delays between causes and effects and 
the irreversibility of many kinds of 
damage—all increase the chances 
UNESCO 
that mankind may temporarily exceed 
the carrying capacity of the biological 
environment. Agricultural failures on 
a large scale, dramatic loss of fisheries 
productivity and epidemic disease are 
among the possible consequences. 
The evidence suggests that such 
possibilities exist within a time frame 
measured in decades, rather than cen- 
turies. This is not to suggest that the 
situation is hopeless. The point is 
rather that the potential for grave 
damage is real and that prompt and 
vigorous action to avert or minimize 
the damage is necessary. Such action 
should include measures to slow the 
growth of population to zero as rapidly 
as possible. 
It will also be necessary to develop 
programmes to alleviate political ten- 
sions, render nuclear war impossible, 
divert flows of resources and energy 
from wasteful uses in rich countries 
to uses in poor ones, increase the 
human benefits resulting from each 
pound of material and gallon of fuel, 
devise new energy sources, and, ulti- 
mately, stabilize civilization’s annual 
throughput of materials and energy. 
Ecological disaster will be difficult 
enough to avoid even if population 
limitation succeeds. [If population 
growth proceeds unabated, averting 
disaster will be impossible. |

T. United Nations decision 
to designate 1974 as International 
Population Year testifies to the critical 
nature of the world’s population 
problems. As with the problems of 
eliminating the nuclear threat, stopping 
the arms race and safeguarding the 
environment, the future of mankind 
depends on their solution. 
In speaking of population growth, 
we should note at the outset the 
complete polarity of the tasks needing 
resolution. 
possible; the need to raise the birth- 
rate, the so-called pronatalist position, 
and the need to reduce the birth-rate, 
the so-called antinatalist position. 
Social and economic and physical 
and geographic conditions differ 
sharply, and this determines the 
differences in the tasks facing the 
countries of the world. In some 
countries, the birth-rate has fallen to a 
low level, in certain areas even to an 
excessively low level; in others the 
birth-rate is at a high level, even 
excessively high. The governments of 
these countries should not look upon 
the situation passively; influence must 
be brought to bear on it, actively and 
effectively. This means pursuing a 
definite demographic policy. 
In the Soviet Union and the European 
socialist countries such a policy is 
expressed in measures for stimulating 
the birth-rate. Some people are scep- 
tical of such measures, believing that 
they cannot have any noticeable effect 
on demographic processes. The past 
few years, however, have definitely 
proved the groundlessness of such 
scepticism. In Czechoslovakia, for 
example, the birth-rate was 14.9 (births 
per 1,000 persons) in 1868, 15.5 in 1969, 
15.9 in 1970, 16.5 in 1971, 17.8 in 1972, 
and 19.2 for the first nine months 
of 1973. 
Thus, in the past five years, the birth- 
rate in Czechoslovakia increased 
nearly one third. This was the direct 
result of important government efforts 
 
Two starting points are . 
aimed at helping women and making 
it easier for them to combine mother- 
hood with social labour. Czechoslo- 
vakia has now surpassed all the 
European socialist countries (except 
Albania) in terms of birth-rate. 
Appropriate efforts are also being 
made in the Soviet Union. Apart from 
general legislative measures and the 
broadening of the network of pre- 
school institutions, factors which 
should ensure a rising birth-rate are 
improvements in the standard of living, 
housing and public services. These 
factors have apparently begun to 
operate. In 1970 and 1971, there were 
170 births per 1,000 women between 
the ages of 20 and 24, and in 1971 and 
1972, the figure rose to nearly 174. 
The figures for women between the 
ages of 25-29 were, respectively, a 
little over 132 and 137. 
None the less, this by no means 
disposes of the need for a more 
vigorous demographic policy aimed at 
making it easier for working women 
to bring up children. Many regions of 
the Soviet Union at present experience 
a shortage of manpower resources, 
and with the future in mind society 
must be concerned with making up this 
deficit. Developing the vast expanses 
of the U.S.S.R. and its massive natural 
resources will benefit not only the 
Soviet Union but all mankind. 
The question is fundamentally dif- 
ferent in the developing countries and 
even in the economically advanced 
Western countries. The high birth-rate 
in many countries has become a 
serious obstacle to economic growth. 
In some countries the economic growth 
rate in fact cannot keep up with the 
population growth rate. * Their econ- 
omies are like a lorry trying to climb 
a slippery incline: the wheels spin 
around, but the lorry stays in one place 
and sometimes even slides backward. 
It would be wrong, of course, to 
conclude that a high birth-rate is the 
main or only reason for the difficult

food situation in many countries. It 
cannot be denied that rapid population 
growth in these countries hampers the 
solution of economic problems and 
slows down development. But the 
birth-rate is the result of the social and 
economic conditions in which the 
people live: illiteracy among hundreds 
of millions of people, a low cultural 
level, the absence of social insurance, 
* backward forms of economic develop- 
ment, the feeble use of women's labour 
in social production. 
Meanwhile, under circumstances of 
changing social and economic con- 
ditions, with the elimination of feudal 
vestiges and neo-colonialism, these 
countries, having gained freedom and 
independence, have effected the eman- 
cipation of women and a growth in 
their culture. In drawing women into 
social labour they must take advantage 
of the opportunities that modern 
science offers for achieving wanted 
motherhood and family planning, that 
is, for practising so-called birth control. 
Over a half century ago, the eminent 
American writer, Upton Sinclair, said in 
The Book of Life: “Birth control is a 
great achievement of the human intel- 
lect, equalling the discovery of fire 
and the invention of the printing press. 
Birth control means freeing women and 
all mankind from the blind and irrational 
fertility of nature, which created us as 
animals and would gladly have left us 
in such a state had we not rebelled 
against it.” 
The great Indian philosopher and 
educator, Rabindranath Tagore, stated 
it more categorically when he said: 
“The birth control movement is a great 
movement.” 
In the deep past, peoples who 
needed to limit their numbers did so 
barbarically—by infanticide. That dark 
period of history is long past. By the 
Middle Ages, most countries no longer 
used artificial means for controlling 
population size. Then, at the close of 
the Middle Ages, the European aris- 
tocracy began practising birth control 
within the family. This practice steadily 
became more and more widespread, 
until it extended to the majority of 
married couples. 
The first to embark on this road were 
Finland and France, whose populations 
by the end of the 19th century made 
up approximately three per cent of the 
world population. If it can be assumed 
that perhaps one-third of the married 
couples in these countries were limiting 
the number of their children, it may be 
concluded that at that time birth 
control was practised by no more than 
one per cent of the married couples 
of the world. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, 
a large proportion of the population of . 
Western Europe and the western 
regions of Russia was regulating the 
number of children in the family. We 
estimate that at that time about eight 
per cent of the world's married couples 
limited themselves to wanted children. 
The tumultuous 20th century, the 
century of world wars and social 
revolutions, has sharply changed the 
position of women. An ever growing 
proportion of them is being drawn into 
social labour, and this “new” function 
of women is beginning to compete 
more and more with their maternal 
functions. The patriarchal family is 
giving way to a new type based on 
small families and the participation of 
women in production. By the middle 
of the 20th century, about one-fourth 
of all married couples were inten- 
tionally limiting the number of children 
in their families. 
During the third quarter of our 
century, this process will become more 
intensified. Many countries, large and 
small, now fall within its sphere of 
influence. Birth control is practised 
almost universally in Japan and is 
becoming increasingly widespread in 
India and some other Asian countries, 
The available information indicates 
that measures to reduce the birth-rate 
have also embraced part of the

population of the Chinese People’s 
Republic. It may be considered that 
today about 45 per cent of the world’s 
married couples limit the number of 
their children. It is not impossible that 
this figure will continue to grow so 
that by the end of this or sometime 
in the next century it will reach a full 
100 per cent. 
However, even 100 per cent family 
planning would not mean that the 
problem was solved. It is extremely 
important to know how many children 
married couples are likely to have 
before they begin limiting the number 
of births. If they began, say, after the 
birth of the fifth child, the effect would 
be insignificant. Therefore, along 
with birth control, the governments of 
a number of countries also encourage 
the concept of small families. Thus 
in India young women are advised “not 
to rush with the second child and to 
think twice before having the third". 
With cultural growth, the increase 
in the share of women's labour, the 
reduction of infant mortality, the 
expansion of social insurance and the 
disappearance of vestiges of the past, 
the attitudes of married couples will be 
oriented to small families. 
If half the married couples limit 
themselves in the future to two children 
and the other half to three, the number 
of births would in time approximately 
equal the number of deaths, and the 
world’s population would in due course 
become stabilized. Only then can it 
be expected that the urgency of the 
population problem will disappear. 
This stability will not drop from 
heaven. It must be achieved and 
organized. Many people imagine that 
Marxists have always and everywhere 
stood and continue to stand for 
maximum population growth. In fact, 
this is not the attitude of scientific 
socialism, but of Utopian socialism. 
The English scholar and Utopian 
socialist, William Godwin, for example, 
wrote in his Enquiry Concerning Social 
Justice (1793) that "The population 
could grow for a myriad of centuries 
and the earth would not fail to provide 
it with food.” 
Fredrick Engels stated the question 
another way. After reading Karl 
Kautsky's book on population prob- 
lems, he wrote the author a letter in 
which he said: “The abstract possi- 
bility of such a numerical growth of 
humanity as would raise the necessity 
of placing limits on this growth nat- 
urally exists.” Engels’ letter was dated 
1 February, 1881. Over 90 years have 
passed, and with the enormous changes 
that have taken place this is a long 
enough period for the “abstract possi- 
bility” which Engels foresaw to become 
a concrete necessity. 
To bring about the necessary limits 
foreseen by Engels, changes in the 
social and economic conditions under 
which peoples live are essential and 
along with these changes a corres- 
ponding demographic policy. Borrow- 
ing the idea of a traffic light, we 
could say that in today’s demographic 
situation a red light means “panic”, a 
green light, “no problems”, and a 
yellow, “be prepared for a stop”. 
Sowing panic only means compli- 
cating the situation. A green light is 
also inappropriate since there are no 
grounds for unconcern. The only wise 
position is to make a sober evaluation 
of the situation and take the necessary 
steps in time. To change the colour 
metaphor, we might say that in- 
temperate, unconcerned optimists look 
at these problems through rose- 
coloured glasses, and over-concerned 
pessimists, through dark glasses. 
However, we feel that the glasses 
should be removed altogether in order 
to see life as it is. In other words, we 
should be realists. 
The “Green Revolution” in India, 
Mexico and other countries has made 
it possible within a short period to 
increase grain harvests, and this has 
somewhat mitigated the food problems. 
It is essential to take full advantage 
of this respite and to work for a 
 
reduction in the population growth rate 
in countries where it is excessive. 
Besides using the short variety of 
wheat that gives less stalk and more 
grain, there are many other ways to 
increase harvests. While the average 
yield in the U.S.S.R. was 1,020 kilo- 
grammes per hectare between 1961 
and 1965, and 1,370 kg. between 1966 
and 1970, it rose to 1,760 kg. in 1973, 
or 26 per cent higher than in the 
preceding Five Year Plan period. 
Fertilizers, mechanization and land 
improvement are all means of increas- 
ing agricultural output, but one must 
not conclude that there is no food 
problem in the world. According to 
the Food and Agriculture Organization, 
nearly one billion people are starv- 
ing or are seriously undernourished. 
However, an increase in agricultural 
output in many countries requires 
material resources and a social system 
which they do not have. Under these 
conditions, their population problems

are especially acute, and along with 
them is the problem of birth control. 
The neutrality of the United Nations 
in this matter reflects respect for all 
beliefs and views, but in the long 
run it can bring peoples only harm. 
The role of the United Nations and 
its specialized agencies, including 
Unesco, in solving population prob- 
lems can be distinctly traced at inter- 
national demographic congresses. At 
the first (Rome 1954), only timid steps 
were taken—towards expanding res- 
earch and gathering statistics and esti- 
mates of the future world population. 
The second congress, held 11 years 
later (Belgrade, 1965), provided a 
broad forum at which population ques- 
tions were subjected to all-round and 
penetrating discussion, since they had 
by then assumed the dimensions of 
problems demanding solution. 
Various opinions were expressed, 
different positions were brought to 
light, various ideas were suggested.

Nearly nine years have gone by 
since then. The time for talking has 
passed; it is now time for action. It 
is clear that in a number of countries 
the reduction of birth-rates must be- 
come a task of national urgency. The 
accomplishment of this task, however, 
should not encroach on the sove- 
reignty of governments and families. 
Firm recommendations are needed on 
how to carry out a demographic policy 
which would have a decisive effect on 
the reproductive habits of married 
couples in the respective countries. 
This, in turn, requires considerable 
funds and clear legislation. 
State finances are handled by 
governments, and government insti- 
tutions pass the laws. Therefore, the 
U.N. was wise to convene a third 
congress at government level, for 
August, 1974, in Bucharest, the capital 
of Romania. This congress, it is hoped, 
will mark a new stage by studying 
population problems in terms of

concrete measures for their solution. 
An active demographic policy invol- 
ves not only control over the birth- 
rate or, conversely, its stimulation, 
but also measures for reducing the 
death-rate.” There has been unques- 
tionable progress in the fight against 
infant mortality in nearly all countries. 
But the situation with adult mortality 
has in some respects worsened: at 
least two million people die each year 
from accidents alone. 
Perhaps at the Bucharest Congress 
it would be useful to raise the ques- 
tion of establishing an international 
accident prevention centre to fight 
against all forms of accidents: street, 
home and industrial. It should also 
be remembered that in many countries 
there is a growing proportion of old 
people who see poorly and hear poorly 
and are therefore more accident-prone. 
| am reminded of a parable. Once 
upon a time an Eastern ruler sum- 
moned his wise men and ordered them 
to write the history of mankind. Being 
unequal to the task, they decided to 
answer him in brief: “People were 
born, suffered and died”. The Inter- 
national Population Year should add a 
sizeable contribution to the great 
common fund of achievements in the 
natural and social sciences, so that 
a brief history of mankind would go 
like this: “People were born, did not 
suffer and lived a long and happy life.”

] N recent years, a consider- 
able number of studies have appeared 
on global problems. These studies 
have analysed the demographic char- 
acteristics of the world and their pro- 
jected pattern to the year 2000, 
agriculture, food supplies, energy 
resources, etc. Each of them is 
extremely important in its field. 
However, these problems are closely 
connected. The future of agriculture 
for example can be discussed only in 
terms of future needs and therefore 
of demographic growth. Demographic 
growth is in turn directly related to 
food and other factors. 
To forecast world population 30 or 
‘50 years ahead is therefore feasible 
only if account is taken of all the 
factors in the equation, particularly 
agriculture, food, fertilizers and energy, 
both in a given region and in others 
where the picture may be different. 
This phenomenon—the interaction, 
the inseparable fusion of all these 
problems—might be termed the “world 
problem complex”. In other words, all 
these analytical studies are valid only 
if they are linked together in a global - 
network—the world problem complex. 
And yet it is equally essential to recog- 
nize the world's diversity. One can- 
not speak of the world's food problem, 
but only of North America’s food prob- 
lem, Western Europe's food problem, 
the Soviet Union's, South Asia's, etc., 
and each is profoundly different. 
There may be famine in one region, 
abundance in another. We must 
therefore agree that the world is at 
the same time one world and many. 
To understand it properly, it must be 
studied in its unity and in its diversity.

But we can anticipate its characteris- 
tic features if at first we learn to 
understand the unity and the diversity. 
We should then be able to forecast 
probable trends, so that finally—be- 
cause we understand the causes—we 
may be in a position to choose bet- 
ween a number of possibilities, 
The new world study, which we have 
completed at the request of the Club 
of Rome, had exactly this purpose of 
understanding our planet better, of 
discerning future trends more surely, 
so that it might be possible to influence 
the future, by heading off catastro- 
phes, by averting large-scale injus- 
wy: and by promoting a better quality 
of life... 
The study required two years of 
work with a large team of specialists, 
and culminated in the construction of 
what we call the Mesarovic-Pestel 
All the data are recorded 
in three computers situated at Cleve- 
land (Ohio), Hanover (Fed. Rep. of 
Model (1). 
Germany) and Grenoble (France), 
which can be questioned by telephone 
or satellite from any part of the world. 
True to the concept of the world's 
diversity, all the data registered relate 
to ten large regions—North America, 
Western Europe, Japan, Australia- 
South Africa, U.S.S5.R. and Eastern 
Europe, Latin America, the Maghreb 
(North Africa) and Near East, tropical 
Africa, South Asia, China. There are 
therefore ten autonomous economic 
models, which allow one region or a 
group of regions to be studied, but 
there is also in effect a single world 
model, since the ten sections are inter-

linked. This model is thus a reflection 
of the world's unity and diversity. 
A second major characteristic is 
that the Model is a “multi-level” 
one, comprising data on natural resour- 
ces (oil deposits, mineral reserves), 
technological data (industry), econ- 
omic data and so on. All these data 
are interlinked, since they react one 
with the other. 
A third characteristic is that the 
Model constitutes, not a means of 
predicting the future—manifestly an 
absurdity—but a tool for understand- 
ing what is likely to happen if—on the 
first hypothesis—events are allowed 
to unfold without hindrance, or if—on 
the alternative hypothesis—various 
different kinds of action are taken. 
The different possible policies fed into 
the computer are called “scenarios”. 
Each scenario elicits a reply derived 
from all the basic data of the Model. 
A final important characteristic of 
the Model is that—obviously—it does 
not record all the countless world 
data, but only the principal basic rela- 
tionships. To put it in simplified terms, 
what the Model brings into play 
essentially are the demographic char- 
acteristics, the food requirements, 
energy, economic growth--in short, 
the major construction materials of 
the future, the materials with which, 
if he holds them in his hands, man 
can build a better world. 
Here are some of the principal con- 
clusions of the Mesarovic-Pestel 
Mode!, in particular with regard to 
population and food. 
The most crucial questions in this 
respect are: Is the precarious state 
of the world food supply situation a 
temporary aberration, resulting from 
inadequate attention given to the prob- 
lem and which therefore can be 
remedied quite readily? Or is it a 
persistent or even worsening problem 
whose solution would require major 
efforts 7 If the latter is true, the next 
and most urgent question is: What 
are the characteristics of the different 
strategies which can be used to avert 
a catastrophe? 
Analysis of the first question pro- 
duced the conclusion that the historical 
pattern of development will make the 
situation increasingly worse until it 
reaches truly catastrophic proportions. 
In considering the second question 
we analysed a number of scenarios 
and were able to identify some basic 
components which any strategy aimed 
at the solution of the world food situa- 
tion must have. 
Our world model has certain features 
of special relevance to the food-popu- 
lation problem. The model contains 
a detailed representation of diet and 
food types, region by region, and is 
based on 26 different varieties of food. 
The model also incorporates the effect 
that is produced by lack of essential 
diet elements, such as protein, on the 
population. 
The regionalization of the model is 
most important here since, although »

MOUNTING PRESSURE 
ON THE LAND 
The four graphs on these pages were 
produced by a computer on the basis 
of data provided by a new world 
computer model elaborated by 
M.D. Mesarovic and E. Pestel. 
According to these studies, certain 
catastrophic events await the world 
before the year 2025. 
The graph, right, shows how the density 
of the population, expressed in numbers 
of persons per square kilometre of 
cultivated land, is exercising pressure 
on the food production potential of 
5 major regions of the world. The study 
states that the worst hit will be 
South Asia, where every square 
kilometre of cultivated land now 
supports 370 human beings. In the 
year 2000 it will have to feed 700 persons, 
and 1,370 by 2025. In Western 
Europe, by contrast, each square 
kilometre will have to feed less than 
500 persons by the year 2025.

we are talking of the “world” food 
problem, the location of actual food 
supplies and the location of actual 
food deficits are clearly crucial fac- 
tors. For example, the potential for 
increasing the production of prime 
beef in Latin America is of minor 
importance for the relief of food short- 
ages in South Asia, especially if it 
is potential in the sense of assuming 
use of land yet to be developed. 
The comprehensiveness of our 
approach, as exemplified by the num- 
ber of data levels included in the 
Model, is also important. Too often 
the question of food supply is con- 
sidered solely within the confines of 
economics. It might be stated for 
example that all we need is a three per 
cent annual increase in agricultural 
output and this is represented in 
monetary terms. Yet one does not 
eat dollars but grain; the real ques- 
tion is how much food can be pro- 
duced in physical terms. Hence a 
mere accountant’'s approach is not 
sufficient here. 
Nor can the world food supply 
problem be solved by a laboratory- 
type approach, since the problem is 
not what a wizard could do if he 
could transform all arable land in the 
world into a greenhouse, but rather 
what can be produced with the land 
of the type and area we have avail- 
able, using the economic and human 
resources which exist at a given time. 
Assessing the development of world 
food supply on the basis of laboratory 
or experimental results leads to rather 
naive, if not downright irresponsible, 
conclusions. One is dealing, after all, 
with human lives, which should not be 
considered so lightheartedly., 
Another important feature of our 
model is its capacity to consider in 
realistic terms the relationship between 
the implementation of a population 
policy and its effects on population 
change. Our population sub-model

shows that if current trends prevail 
there will be by the end of this century 
more people in the “South” than in 
the entire world today, and in another 
25 years three times as many. 
What would happen thereafter is so 
astronomical as to be almost ridicu- 
lous to consider. There is no ques- 
tion as to whether such development 
will take place or not. The only ques- 
tion is whether the slowdown of popu- 
lation growth will be the result of a 
deliberate population policy or the 
result of “natural forces"——primarily 
starvation and malnutrition. 
We can feed into our model a range 
of population policies aimed at bring- 
ing the population to equilibrium, at 
different times-and at different levels, 
and implemented with various degrees 
of effectiveness. 
The need to show the results of 
various population policies in a real- 
istic manner is apparent when one 
appreciates the delays between the 
start of implementation and the effect. 
For example, if a fully effective popu- 
lation policy, starting in 1975, achieves 
its aim of bringing the fertility rate in 
the entire “South” region to an equili- 
brium level in 35 years, the population 
equilibrium is not reached until 75 
years after the initiation of the policy, 
that is 40 years after the objective of 
fertility equilibrium has been reached. 
Moreover, by the time population 
equilibrium has been attained, the 
population will be more than twice 
as high as when the policy is initiated. 
The need to look at least 50 years 
ahead, when considering the develop- 
ment of the world system, is thus self- 
evident. Unfortunately, few people 
are willing to look 50 years ahead. 
Finally, the strains on regional re- 
sources can be appreciated from the 
fact that on each square kilometre of 
cultivated land in the South Asia region 
there will be, in the year 2000, 330 
additional persons to be fed, and 1,000

‘in 2025. To cap all this, the rate of

with those for North America, where 
there will be an additional 37 persons 
per square kilometre of cultivated land 
in the year 2000 and 80 more persons 
growth of urban population in South 
Asia is twice the growth rate of the 
total regional population. 
It is not surprising that the most 
critical situation regarding food supply 
is in South Asia and Tropical Africa. 
Here we shall restrict ourselves to 
South Asia, since it represents the 
biggest problem because of the sheer 
numbers involved. 
We shall present the results in refer- 
ence to some key scenarios, each 
representing a plausible sequence of 
events resulting from various political 
decisions and social choices. 
First scenario 
The purpose of the first scenario, 
called “Standard”, is to obtain an 
indication of the persistency of the 
food gap during the next 50 years: 
in particular, whether the food situa- 
tion is going to be better or worse 
and by how much, 
The scenario assumes that the his- 
torical pattern of development based 
on a somewhat optimistic view of the 
past and present situation will continue, 
In particular, a population policy is 
assumed which will be successful in 
bringing the fertility rate to equilibrium 
level in about 50 years. It is also 
assumed, optimistically, that the aver- 
age use of fertilizer per hectare in the 
entire region will surpass the present 
North American level towards the end 
of the relevant time-period. This will 
allow yields to increase by about 
1,000 kilogrammes per hectare, again 
on average, i.e. taking into account 
every piece of land under cultivation. 
This in fact is about the increase 
which the Green Revolution has 
brought on average in the best of all 
lands in India and Pakistan. It is 
also assumed that all remaining arable 
land is quickly brought under cultiva- 
tion and that all the necessary techno- 
logical inputs including irrigation will 
be available. 
Finally, in order to assess the 
magnitude of the food problem, we 
assume that no massive starvation 
takes place; the difference between 
needs and regional production will 
then indicate the food deficit which 
has to be made up by regional imports 
as outright aid if starvation is to be 
prevented. 
As regards food production, we 
focus on a total protein content of the 
food produced because it is here that 
the worst shortages exist in the 
present food supply situation. The 
average diet of protein in more than 
half of the world is estimated to be 
about two-thirds of the daily need, and 
in animal protein hardly one fourth. 
Furthermore, since food supply in 
South Asia relies predominantly on 
grain, there is a close relationship 
between protein and caloric intake. 
If one is at the bottom level, then so 
is the other. 
The results of our analysis show 
quite clearly that the gravity of the 
food crisis in South Asia will far from 
lessen but rather will increase to un- 
bearable proportions. The protein 
deficit will increase up to more than 
50 million tons annually; and this in 
spite of all the assumed advances 
including permanent cultivation of all 
possible arable land. The cost of 
importing such food would be stagger- 
ing. It would amount to one third of 
the total economic output of the region 
and perhaps three times as much as 
could be paid for by exports. 
Much more revealing than the mon- 
etary figures are the physical quan- 
tities involved. If the food deficiency 
has to be covered chiefly by grains, 
the annual import will have to reach 
in 2025 about 500 million tons of grain, 
which is a larger amount than the 
total annual grain production, as opti- 
mistically projected from the historical 
trends for the year 1980, in all the 
north regions combined. In sheer 
bulk, this would be double the ton-, 
nage of all goods being shipped from 
the United States overseas at present. 
The average haul from the North 
American Mid-West to either coast is 
between 1,000 and 2,000 miles, so 
about 750 billion ton-miles would be 
required, if one had to carry the grain 
by rail from the harvest place to the 
ships in port. This ton-mileage is 
nearly equal to the total annual rail- 
freight mileage in the United States 
of today. These quantities would 
have to be moved to South Asia every 
year, not only in the year 2025, and 
increasingly beyond, without end, if 
some other development does not 
take place. In the case of India alone, 
an enormous fleet of trucks would be 
needed to distribute the grain to 
500,000 villages. 
Second scenario 
Clearly, such a development is not 
sustainable. But what would happen 
if the needed food imports were not 
provided? This is analysed in the 
second scenario, in which all other 
assumptions have remained the same, 
except the assumption that the food 
imports will be covered by someone 
from somewhere. This assumption is 
removed. The result is diet deficiency 
and mass starvation. 
The catastrophe would start some 
time in the early 1980s and would 
reach its peak around the year 2000, 
when the deaths related to food defi- 
cit would more than double; after that 
peak the natural consequences would 
start bringing the population down. 
The number of food deaths related 
to child-birth would aggregate to about 
500 million children, from 1980 up to 
the year 2025; and the sufferings, of 
course, would continue for many de- 
cades beyond. In such catastrophic

T. crisis of human settle- 
ment is no less acute than the crisis 
of population explosion and the need 
for controlling human settlement is at 
least as great as that for controlling 
population growth rates. And yet in 
the massive literature on population, 
the attention given to the settlement 
pattern is utterly inadequate. 
Demographers have usually relied 
on geographers to study the subject. 
Of late, however, because of rapid 
urbanization, increasing rural-urban 
migration and the consequent ecolog- 
ical problems, demographers have 
been forced to devote more attention 
to urban growth, internal migration 
and population redistribution. 
But the perception of the problem 
of settlement is still heavily biased by 
an almost exclusive concern for the 
metropolitan areas and big cities. It 
is still rare to find demographers 
studying the settlement pattern from 
the rural angle in spite of the obvious 
fact that the great majority of the 
countries are predominantly rural and 
most of them will continue to be so 
even at the end of this century.

The growing concern for environ- 
ment has introduced a new dimension 
to demographic studies, and for that 
matter, to all studies. It cannot be 
denied that some of the environmental 
problems are most acute in the big 
cities, but the obsession with pollution 
problems in big cities tends to under- 
estimate the urgency of environmental 
problems like floods, deforestation, 
soil erosion, primitive sanitary condi- 
tions, and a host of allied problems in 
rural areas. This gives rise to the 
tendency of most people to equate 
environmental problems with pollution 
problems of big cities. And yet the 
majority of the world population lives 
in rural areas afflicted by serious 
environmental problems, 
One of the pioneering studies on 
environment—Only One Earth by Bar- 
bara Ward and René Dubos—begins 
the chapter on “Problems of human 
settlements” as follows: “The first 
need is to take the strain off existing 
cities”, and proceeds to give some 
figures indicating the deplorable hous- 
ing condition in Indian cities. But one 
could argue with equal force that “the 
first need is to take the strain off rural 
areas—the strain of poverty, unem- 
ployment and economic and social 
stagnation.” One could also give 
. figures for the deplorable state of the 
productive base of the rural economy 
in countries like India. 
An overemphasis on the problems 
of big cities created by “the human 
avalanche” of migration, to use the pic- 
turesque phrase of Ward and Dubos, 
underestimates the positive role of 
migration in relieving rural poverty. 
There is inadequate realization of the 
role of cities as reception centres for 
the rural poor in countries like India. 
The tendency to look upon rural-urban 
migration as a nuisance and urbaniza- 
tion as an evil and to dream of pure 
air and the picturesque landscape in 
the countryside is to shut one's eyes 
to economic reality. 
This is not to deny the urgency of 
positive measures to regulate rural- 
urban migration. But the popular view 
that as rural to urban migration is 
creating serious problems, such migra- 
tion should be curbed, is an over-sim- 
plification. One should ask: Serious 
problems for whom? Certainly not for 
the rural migrant in spite of all the 
hostilities of the urban environment. 
In fact, rural poverty and unemploy- 
ment drive the migrant to the city. 
Can one look upon the cities as the 
exclusive preserve of only those who 
are already there and ask for an 
internal passport system in the name 
of orderly urban development? As a 
recent study of poverty in India points 
out: “Urban poverty is an outflow of 
rural poverty. Hence action against 
poverty has to be initiated in the rural 
areas.” 
It is important to realize that the 
success of urbanization policies in 
39 
developing countries depends to a Pp

pp considerable extent on the success of 
modernization of agriculture and trans- 
formation of rural areas. Under condi- 
tions of rapid population growth and 
agricultural stagnation, the flow of 
migration from rural to urban areas 
cannot be stemmed merely by restric- 
tive policies. The best deterrent to 
migration in such a situation is accele- 
rated rural development. 
40 Gunnar Myrdal has discussed the 
problem of agricultural development 
at length in his Asian Drama. Analyz- 
ing the main difficulties involved in 
formulating policies in South Asia, he 
refers to the urgency of making greater 
use of a labour force—today largely 
underutilized and rapidly increasing in 
size—if a much higher volume of 
aggregate output is to be achieved. 
A common feature of developing 
countries in Asia is the excessive 
dependence on agriculture, and one of 
the primary objectives of development 
~ planning is to reduce this dependence 
and to evolve a more diversified 
occupational structure. However, both 
on account of excessive population 
growth and the colonial background 
and related factors, there has been a 
structural stagnation in these countries. 
The population problem cannot be 
viewed merely in terms of an accelerat- 
ing growth rate on account of a per- 
sistently high birth-rate and a rapidly 
declining death-rate. The population 
problem in the developing countries 
of Asia is much more a problem of 
structural stagnation on account of a 
persistently high proportion of the 
working force having to depend on 
traditional agriculture.

Considered from this viewpoint, 
improvement in agricultural technology 
and the modernization of agriculture 
will have a bearing not only on agricul- 
tural productivity but will also release 
forces of modernization which will 
affect the attitude towards family size. 
It is curious that in the massive dis- 
cussions on the population problem 
in recent years so little has been said 
about the relevance of land reforms. 
Once we look upon the population 
problem as a problem of structural 
stagnation, any measure which can 
break this stagnation should be con- 
sidered as a development measure. 
Further, if such a measure encour- 
ages occupational mobility, it is direct- 
ly relevant to family planning in terms 
of a higher motivation to practise 
family planning. 
To the extent that land reforms 
succeed in giving land to landless 
agricultural workers, they generate 
occupational mobility and can there- 
fore be considered as both a develop- 
mental measure and a fertility influenc- 
ing measure. 
In any case, in countries where a 
predominant majority of the population 
depends on agriculture and the major 
share of the national income is derived 
from agriculture, it is natural that any 
demographic policy which seeks to 
influence fertility behaviour must take 
note of this basic economic reality. 
Unless the social and economic life of 
the rural masses is touched by our 
policy measures, economic and social 
stagnation cannot be broken. u

An Ethiopian educator 
challenges the idea 
that Africa needs 
population control 
 
42 
MAAZA BEKELE is head of the Social Ser- 
vices Department in Ethiopia's Planning 
Comrussion Office, and has taught at the 
Haile Selassie University in Addis Ababa. 
Her article is an edited and abridged version 
of a study she presented last May at an 
African seminar on population and economic 
development, held in Dar es Salam (Tanzania), 
under the auspices of the World University 
Service. The study has also been published 
by “Ceres”, FAQ Review on Development, 
Rome. 
False prophets 
of doom 
] O write about the “popu- 
lation problem” in Africa is to fall into 
the convenient trap of admitting that 
there is a problem caused by the 
existence in Africa of a certain num- 
ber of people with certain demographic 
characteristics. To write about Africa 
in global terms is also to deny the 
fact that this particular region of the 
Third World is not a homogeneous 
unit, but is a mosaic of peoples, 
cultures and differing conditions. 
Perhaps the only common denominator 
is the economic underdevelopment of 
the different countries of éhe region, 
contrasted with the great potential of 
a great people. 
In many centres of learning in the 
Western world, sophisticated men and 
machines are engaged in the “num- 
bers game”. They work out elegant 
models to prove that the world is 
threatened with disaster, attributable 
largely to the “population explosion” 
occurring in developing regions such 
as Africa. A continuous stream of 
articles points to the dangers inherent 
in “decreasing mortality rates” and 
“unchecked fertility". 
But it is encouraging to note that 
some scholars question the value of 
this “numbers game”. John Maddox, 
in his book “The Doomsday Syn- 
dreme”, lodges a “complaint” against 
the prophets of doom and their hys- 
terical pronouncements. David Evers- 
ley, himself engaged in demographic 
research, has the humility to admit that 
nearly all the “theories” put forward so 
far by demographers can be exploded. 
None can encompass the complexity 
of human behaviour and the reproduc- 
tion of the species. 
In fact, not much is known today 
about African population trends. Such 
demographic data as are available are 
recapitulated below, What is of con- 
cern is that the recurring explosive 
statements made about Africa's pop- 
ulation may only serve to distract 
attention, both within and without 
Africa, from the real problem—that 
millions of people living in a rich envi- 
ronment today have a less than ade- 
quate opportunity to develop their 
true potential. 
The demographic data base in Africa 
is exceedingly tenuous, consequently 
it is difficult to state with any degree 
of certainty the exact size of the 
population. Today, the situation is not 
much better than that described by 
Jonathan Swift in the 18th century: 
“... Geographers, in Afric maps, 
With savage pictures fill their gaps, 
And, o'er unhabitable downs 
Place elephants for want of towns.” 
In two publications put out by the 
same organization, at about the same 
time, the estimated total African 
population is stated in one to be 
363 million in 1970, and in the other 
338 million in 1971. A 2.8 per cent 
growth rate per annum, assumed in 
another publication, gives us the total 
of 329 million in 1970—a difference of 
34 million for the same year. Crude 
projections to the year 2000 on a 
2.8 per cent growth rate, yield a diffe- 
rence of 76 million souls, (which was 
close to the estimated size of the 
entire Eastern African sub-region in 
1970). One need hardly stress how dan- 
gerous it could be to play the “numbers 
game” with this quality of data. 
If we assume that the size of the 
population lies somewhere between 
these estimates, say, 350 million in 
1970, this represents between 9 and 
10 per cent of the total world popu- 
lation occupying just over 20 per cent 
of the earth's land surface. If by the 
year 2000 the African population 
should increase to about 818 million, 
it would represent 12.6 per cent of the 
world's total. It is interesting to note, 
however, that in 1650 the population 
in Africa constituted 20 per cent of 
the total. 
The decimation perpetrated during 
the slave trade in the 17th and 18th 
centuries, military engagements which 
attempted to ward off impending 
colonization in the 19th century, the 
subsequent exploitation of African 
labour, the introduction of new dis- 
eases from Europe and the spread of 
locally endemic diseases through the 
migration set in motion at that time, 
all contributed to an absolute decline 
in the number of African people over 
a period of 200 years. Thus, the per- 
centage relative to the rest of the 
world was quite dramatically lowered.

### 50345: False prophets of doom; an Ethiopian educator challenges the idea that Africa needs population control

It is only since the beginning of this 
century that the rebuilding of the Afri- 
can population has begun. 
Today, Africa is constituted of 
41 independent states and a number 
of colonial territories. There is also 
South Africa with almost 23 million 
people, one fifth of whom are a white 
racist minority. 
In 1970, of the 41 independent states, 
only 9 had a population over 10 million; 
13 had less than 2 million and the 
remaining 19 had a median population 
of about 4 million. Only Egypt, Ethio- 
pia, Nigeria and Zaire can be consid- 
ered large countries with populations 
in excess of 20 million. 
Population densities as compared to 
the rest of the world are low, averag- 
ing 11 persons per square kilometre 
in 1968 as against the world average 
of 26. A more useful measure in Afri- 
can agricultural societies is, however, 
density per square kilometre of arable

land. This was estimated to be 184 
in 1968, a much lower average than 
the world figure of 248, 
But perhaps the most challenging 
characteristic of the African population, 
as in the rest of the developing world, 
is the predominance of young people. 
Close to 44 per cent of Africa's popu- 
lation is under 15 years while less 
than 3 per cent is 65 and over. 
The prophets of doom contend that 
both the structure and the consequent 
potential size of the African population 
(as one component of Third World 
potential), is a threat to general world 
prosperity and a deterrent to econo- 
mic development in the African coun- 
tries. They see an absolute decline 
in fertility as the only remedy to the 
impending disaster which will be caus- 
ed by decline in mortality, due to 
improved health care. 
The argument goes something like 
this: a decline in mortality means an 
increase in the number of infants, with 
a consequent rise in the dependency 
burden. Many more adults will reach 
a ripe old age, thereby creating a 
demand for more jobs and services. 
Pressure on the land will increase 
rapidly and there will not be enough 
arable land left to produce sufficient 
food. At the same time, the number 
of women in the reproductive age 
group will increase, with a potential 
impact on fertility. 
This “high level of fertility”, as the 
World Bank's Sector Working Paper 
on Population Planning puts it, “...can 
be expected to decline everywhere. 
However, cultural and social factors 
are significant enough to make for 
important differences in fertility levels 
Photo © Paul Almasy, Paris 
among areas of the world. In the face 
of continuing success in reducing mor- 
tality, no developing country has yet 
experienced a fertility decline suffi- 
cient to reduce the rate of population 
growth to the average level of 1 per 
cent per annum characteristic of the 
developed economies of Europe, North 
America and Japan. Falling fertility is 
the only factor that can accomplish 
such a reduction—except, of course, a 
return to much higher mortality rates.” 
This one-dimensional approach in- 
variably leads to pressure on African 
governments to adopt population con- 
trol programmes as the panacea for 
their and the world's ills. It has also 
resulted in extremely simplistic state- 
ments and propaganda handouts which 
are often not politically sensitive, 
hinting in some cases at the threat to 
white children, which a growing 
coloured population represents, 
But what in fact does the future hold 
for these white children? A 100 per 
cent chance ‘to finish secondary 
school; more than 50 per cent chance 
of a university education and if they 
live in San Francisco, London, Stock- 
holm, or Moscow, they will consume 
a much larger proportion of the 
planet's resources than any child born 
in Addis Ababa, Accra, Lagos or 
Algiers, and several thousand-fold that 
of children born in the vast rural areas 
south of the Sahara. 
In Africa we cannot afford to look 
upon our growing population as a 
problem. We have to face up to the 
challenge of engaging our young, 
expectant peoples in the struggle to 
achieve the most rapid development 
possible, while ensuring an equitable 
distribution of the fruits of develop- 
ment. And Africa must accomplish this 
in the face of tremendous pressures 
and the general lack of concern in the 
developed world for promoting global 
development. 
The focal point of the challenge lies 
in the speed with which African nations 
can introduce fundamental changes in 
the structures they have largely inheri- 
ted and ensure (1) efficient allocation 
of available financial resources, (2) 
adequate and timely investment in the 
intellectual and physical potential of 
the majority of the African people, and 
(3) maximum participation by the Afri- 
can people in planning and executing 
development programmes within an 
economic and social system that 
appeals to the idealism and imagina- 
tion of a young population. 
Many African countries have fallen 
victim to the economic concepts of the 
1950s which assume a dualism be- 
tween growth and equity and have 
given priority to rapid growth. But 
Africa is composed of traditional, rural- 
agrarian societies not easily incorpor- 
ated in simplistic growth models. 
Pressures, mainly from without, have 
led to the allocation of scarce re- 
sources to a largely artificial, modern 
industrial sector. This has caused 
increasing underemployment in rural 
areas, accompanied by rural-urban 
migration and a reduction in food 
supplies. 
The modern sector, on the other 
hand, is not creating jobs fast enough 
to absorb displaced labour. Hence 
an increase in overt unemployment in 
many African cities, particularly among 
school leavers whose western-biased 
education has led them to expect jobs 
which the system just cannot provide.

* Population densities in 
Africa as compared to the rest 
of the world are low, 
averaging 11 persons per square 
kilometre in 1968 as against 
the world average of 26.”

It is open to question whether the 
growing employment problem in Africa 
is primarily a product of population 
growth, or can be attributed to the 
allocation of resources away from 
rural agricultural development, the 
greatest overall potential in Africa. 
“Africa’s economic development has 
and continues to be dictated largely by 
the world economic structure. Trade 
relations are distorted and the pro- 
duction process in most African 
countries is not geared to meeting 
African needs but must of necessity 
be oriented to the export sector from 
which much-needed foreign exchange 
is obtained. Many African countries 
have become overdependent on one 
crop—coffee in East and West Africa, 
cocoa in Ghana, groundnuts in Sene- 
gal, and so on. 
Despite the efforts of the U.N. 
Conference on Trade and Develop- 
ment, the developed world has not 
yet responded to the challenge of 
changing its structure of production 
so as to absorb the products of 
developing countries. In Africa there- 
fore we can only continue to press for 
the required changes in trade relations 
between rich and poor countries. But 
the new move in Africa is much more 
important—a move toward economic 
co-operation between and among 
African nations, which together can 
provide a market large enough to 
admit of viable trade. 
Within African states also is the 
further move toward fundamental 
restructuring of economic and social 
development, based on Africa's agri- 
cultural potential. Physical and social 
infrastructure, including marketing 
arrangements, must be built up; insti- 
tutional reforms, particularly land 
reform and settlement, must be carried 
out; technology suited to the African 
reality—smallholder agriculture—must 
be developed, and policies pursued 
which will ensure that the private cost 
* of capital does not cheapen the price 
of labour, available in abundance all 
over Africa, 
Timely intervention and investment 
in critical areas such as the Sahel 
belt will forestall disaster in drought- 
threatened areas south of the Sahara. 
Thus investment in agriculture will not 
only build up Africa’s economic base 
and absorb its labour force, it will 
also provide the food required by 
Africa's growing population. 
Given its existing structure and the 
“bulge” that could accompany even a 
small improvement in nutrition and 
general living standards, a doubling 
of the population in many African 
countries by the turn of the century 
may be inevitable. This is the eventu- 
ality Ethiopia for instance faces. The 
first priority must therefore be to meet 
the needs of this increasing population. 
Children and adults must be educated 
and services provided. The capacity 
to cope with life today and in the 21st 
century must be built up in the citizens 
of Africa. 
Both financial resources and trained 
manpower are in short supply in most 
African countries. This is why many 
governments are searching for new 
and more imaginative approaches 
which will permit them to offer the 
largest majority of children and illiter- 
ate adults the opportunity to acquire 
basic education and the skills required 
to promote development in rural 
agrarian economies. The bold experi- 
ment in Tanzania is a case in point. 
Ethiopia's recent Education Sector 
Review also indicates that it is possible 
within available resources to achieve 
this goal in 10-15 years. 
The physical capacity of the African 
people must also be built up through 
improvement in the general levels of 
health and a better standard and 
quality of life. Today, average life 
expectancy in Africa is only 40 years. 
Infant mortality rates are astronomical 
—over 150 per 1,000 live births in 
14 out of 25 countries. There is an 
exceedingly high death-rate among 
children under 5 years. The advocates 
of population control argue that family 
planning will result in lower infant 
mortality and child deaths. Almost 
unlimited funds are made available for 
family planning programmes, but they 
are often withheld where no official 
programme exists. 
It seems almost sinister that there 
is so much money available to control 
life and hardly any to promote it. 
It also seems unrealistic to expect 
that poverty-stricken, hard-working 
African mothers—many close to death 
before the age of 35—can be expected 
to limit the number of their children 
when only 1 out of 3 or 4 survive. 
The onus is on the “controllers” to 
demonstrate to these women that 3 out 
of 4 of their children will survive.

They cannot run the risk that their 
major creative contribution to humanity 
(given that the rest of their existence 
is - almost pure drudgery), will be 
denied them. In each woman is the 
grain of hope that life for her offspring 
will be better than hers, 
Besides, in African society, pro- 
creation and the loving, tender rearing 
of children is one of society's most 
important goals. Children are not a 
burden, they are an asset in the 
average farm family. 
It is little wonder therefore that 
family planning programmes have so 
far had little success in Africa. Only 
8 African countries—Botswana, Egypt, 
Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, 
Nigeria and Tunisia—have officially 
instituted family planning programmes. 
By and large these are mainly concen- 
trated in the urban areas where fertility 
levels are already lower than in rural 
areas, and only a minuscule portion of 
all women in these countries is being 
reached. Little attention is paid to 
evaluating either the impact or the 
cost of these programmes. 
One attempt at evaluation is Lars 
Bondestam's report on “Population 
Growth Control in Kenya”. This study 
indicates that it is mainly women who 
  
“ The prophets of doom contend that both the 
structure and potential size of Africa's 
population is a threat to world prosperity 
and a deterrent to economic development in Africa. 
This is a one-dimensional approach. In Africa 
we cannot afford to look upon our growing 
population as a problem. We have to face up 
to the challenge of engaging our youth in the 
struggle to achieve the most rapid development 
possible. Africa must accomplish this in the 
face of tremendous pressures. “

fruits of development. 
have a comparatively high standard of 
living who are involved in the family 
planning programme. Only the edu- 
cated among them tend to start con- 
traception early in their child-bearing 
period. Only about half of the 
acceptors remain in the programme 
after one year, and a sizeable pro- 
portion of these are women who have 
few or no children. Bondestam also 
contends that the cost of the pro- 
gramme, now in its fifth year, is 
exceedingly high compared to other 
countries. There were some 8,000 
births prevented in 1969/1970 at a 
unit cost of about U.S. $155. 
The view is widely held in Africa 
that until a greater proportion of 
children are able to stay alive, large 
numbers will continue to be born. An 
increase in the survival rate will, how- 
ever, depend on two factors—the rate 
at which the level of health of the 
majority of the African people can be 
improved, and a steady and per- 
ceptible rise in the standard and 
quality of their lives. 
The road to economic development 
in the 1970s is being charted. This 
development can make it possible to 
offer to the majority of African vil- 
lagers and the urban poor a simple 
package of health promoting services 
—a package which costs very much 
less than elaborate hospital services 
available in the African metropolis. 
Perhaps the greatest challenge that 
Africa faces is that of mobilizing the 
hearts and minds of the mass of Afri- 
can people in the development effort, 
releasing their latent energies so that 
they themselves will take the challenge 
of developing their land to its full 
potential. This means more involve- 
ment of local communities and the 
African youth in the decision-making 
process and in the implementation of 
programmes which benefit the majority 
by providing productive employment. 
Traditional organizations in Africa 
must be adapted to meet this need. 
African women must be given a real 
stake in producing - and reaping the 
it may even 
be so that in cities like Lagos and 
Accra, Cairo, Nairobi and Addis 
Ababa, the emerging role of women in 
today's social and economic activities 
has begun to affect both productivity 
and fertility trends. 
The only evidence we have in human 
history of “population stabilization”, 
or reduced population growth, is the 
experience of the now developed 
countries that decline in fertility is a 
function of prosperity. There is no 
reason to expect underdeveloped 
Africa to follow a different path. IM

### 50346: Family planning: a United Nations world survey

A 
UNITED 
NATIONS 
  
E.. this year the United 
Nations published a report on a second 
world inquiry into population and dev- 
elopment. Carried out by the U.N. 
Economic and Social Council with the 
governments of 80 countries, the 
inquiry covered many aspects of the 
population question. 
In its May 1974 issue, the “Unesco 
Courier” presented the findings of the 
survey with respect to government 
attitudes and policies towards popu- 
lation. In this issue we publish its 
conclusions with respect to the provi- 
sion of family planning facilities. 
“Family planning activities organized, 
sponsored or permitted by govern- 
ments are spreading throughout the 
world”, the U.N. report says, “even 
in those countries where no explicit 
population policy has been adopted 
or where pronatalist objectives are 
being pursued.” [In many countries 
such services are made available in 
the interests of mothers’ and children's 
health, sometimes on a state basis, 
sometimes through clinics operated by 
voluntary bodies. 
The U.N. report describes the 
countries covered by the survey as 
falling into four distinct categories 
where family planning is concerned: 
1. Countries where governments 
organize or actively sponsor broad 
national family planning programmes, 
including countries where such activi- 
ties are foreseen for the near future; 
2. Countries where the population 
is practising birth control with the 
assistance of private, non-govern- 
mental bodies; 
3. Countries where family planning 
is not officially endorsed or assisted, 
or where it 1s even forbidden; 
4, Countries where no information 
is available on family planning. 
The U.N. report summarizes its find- 
ings on family planning in the major 
regions of the world as follows: 
Africa 
Egypt, Kenya and Tunisia have well 
advanced national family planning pro- 
grammes and are making further 
efforts to improve these activities. The 
Government of Swaziland stated that 
family planning advice will increasingly 
become an integral part of the basic 
health services. Madagascar is con- 
sidering undertaking a pilot study in 
family planning. The U.N, Economic 
Commission for Africa reports that 
Tanzania officially accepts family 
planning services offered by a private 
association but has no official national 
programme of its own. 
Gabon is totally against any form of 
family planning measures because of 
its low fertility and is the only country 
in Africa where the sale of contracep- 
tives is an offence. In Malawi family 
planning has not, so far, been offi- 
cially endorsed as a national policy. 
Zambia too has no specific official 
policy of family planning. 
Information available to the Eco- 
nomic Commission for Africa shows 
that to date eight countries with about 
24.5 per cent of Africa's population 
have official family planning program- 
mes while 13 other countries with 
48 per cent of the region's total popu- 
lation, though having no official pro- 
grammes, have programmes run by 
voluntary associations, some of which 
receive government support. There 
are, on the other hand, some 21 count- 
ries with 27 per cent of Africa's total 
population which are at present either 
not interested in or are opposed to 
family planning programmes and, 
therefore, have no programmes at all. 
Latin America 
Countries of Latin America are also 
in a somewhat early stage of develop- 
ing family planning activities. Barba- 
dos, Colombia, Panama and Trinidad 
and Tobago have national family 
planning programmes. In Mexico, 
family planning is understood as a 
social and medical service to which 
the whole population is entitled, es-. 
pecially those of lower income. (Fur- 
ther details on population questions in 
Latin America are given in a special 
article published on page 62.) 
Asia 
In the Asian continent, family 
planning programmes are widespread. 
Twelve countries, among them the 
most populous, have national pro- 
grammes. China, India, Iran, Japan, 
Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the 
Republic of Viet-Nam, Singapore, Sri 
Lanka, Thailand and Turkey have 
accumulated valuable experience, and 
achieved significant results in influenc- 
ing fertility through family planning. 
In Israel and to a less extent in the 
Khmer Republic, family planning ser- 
vices are provided by medical insti- 
tutions but are not endorsed as an 
official government policy. They are 
not intended to reduce the birth-rate 
but serve the purposes of general 
welfare and responsible parenthood. 
In several other Asian countries, Bah- 
rain, Jordan, Laos, and in the near 
future possibly also the Syrian Arab 
Republic, family planning is the work of 
the health and welfare administration. 
In Iraq, the government is not 
expected to take measures in the near 
future to reduce the birth-rate.

### 50346: Family planning: a United Nations world survey

  
a AR aE AU ee vee = 
> Europe 
The European continent is in a dif- 
ferent demographic situation from most 
other regions. Family planning ser- 
vices are promoted in many European 
countries and it is known that the 
population at large is availing itself 
of the existing contraceptive methods, 
medical advice and often also liber- 
alized abortion laws. 
Countries most closely concerned 
with family planning are the United 
. Kingdom, Denmark, Netherlands, Yu- 
48 
goslavia and some eastern European 
socialist countries. In Romania family 
planning is approved by the govern- 
ment for reasons of family health and 
welfare with rather pronatalist general 
tendencies. Hungary is sympathetic to 
family planning services mainly as a 
means of avoiding induced abortions. 
In most western European countries 
private family planning services exist 
within the general health and social 
welfare programmes, along with a 
widespread use of different contracep- 
tive means and methods, and birth 
control is regarded as a strictly private 
matter. This is clearly the case in 
Sweden but can also be inferred in 
Austria, France, the Federal Republic 
of Germany, Finland and Norway. 
The position of the Ukrainian S.S.R. 
and the Soviet Union is less clear. 
Family planning is officially not en- 
dorsed although contraceptive means 
and relevant medical and social ser- 
vices are widely available. Greece, 
Spain and Italy have no official or 
officially recognized private family 
planning services. 
North America 
In Canada the government's role is 
to encourage the development of 
F To 
family planning services and provide 
advice and assistance. The Canadian 
family planning programme was ini- 
tiated in 1970. 
The Federal Government and Con- 
gress of the United States support 
family planning programmes on the 
premise that the spacing and limitation 
of births strengthen the health of the 
mother, increase the integrity of the 
family and provide greater opportu- 
nities for the children. 
Oceania 
In Fiji a Government family planning 
programme has been operative for 
several years. New Zealand did not 
have an official national family 
planning programme until 1971 when 
the Government decided to introduce 
one and to extend the activities it had 
hitherto been supporting in this. field. 
In Australia, there are no official 
family planning activities and advertis- 
ing of contraceptives is prohibited, but 
family planning services are expected 
to attract more government support in 
the years to come. 
In conclusion, the U.N. Report makes 
two general observations: 
The most advanced family planning 
activities organized by government 
agencies are in Asia and North Africa. 
On the other hand Europe and North 
America are the continents where 
family planning appears to be most 
widely practised by the population 
even though these measures do not 
usually form part of government policy. 
The situation in the countries sur- 
veyed clearly indicates a tendency 
toward the spreading and improvement 
"of family planning activities and their 
development as an integral part of 
health and welfare programmes. M

In the developing world 
This illustration tells a tragic story about the children of the 
developing world. It contrasts the shortage of primary 
schools at three points in time: 1970 (left), 1960 (centre), 
and 1985 (right). In 1960, 118 million children aged 6 - 11 
years were deprived of schooling; if they had linked hands 
they would have circled the globe three times. A decade 
later, the situation had only slightly improved : 113 million 
165 MILLION CHILDREN WITHOUT SCHOOLS 
children in the same age group were without schools. How- 
ever, if educational trends during the last decade continue, 
by 1985 population growth will be such that 165 million chil- 
dren in the developing regions—more than one child in three 
in the primary school! age group—will not be enrolled in 
school. If they were to join hands these children would be 
able to circle the globe four times. al

### 50347: Family planning: the Chinese experiment

FAMILY 
PLANNING 
  
by Han Suyin

Text Copyright © 
Unicef and Han Suyin 
Reproduction prohibited 
HAN SUYIN Is the noted novelist who for 
17 years has paid yearly visits to the People’s 
Republic of China. She is the author of a 
dozen works on China and Asia Including 
“China in the Year 2001" (1967), "Asia today” 
(1969) and numerous novels. An ardent femi- 
nist and medical doctor, she has observed 
family planning In China (where she was 
born) since 1956. In this article, originally 
published in “Unicef News" (No. 78), she 
sums up her 17-year research and reports 
the latest facts based on her visit to China 
in the summer of 1973. 
“E DUCATION is the key." 
“All policies must be understood 
by the masses, carried out by the 
masses, and be in their interest.” 
In these two sentences, we find the 
clue to understanding family planning 
in China. For it is through a pro- 
gramme of public education that peo- 
ple are being influenced to practise 
birth control voluntarily as part of 
community life. The special lesson 
that the Chinese experiment offers is 
that family planning must not be 
something dictated by fears, economic 
pressure, or coercion; but that it must 
be thought of as being essential to 
the personal development of both 
woman and man. 
The first family planning drive oc- 
curred in 1956 in the cities and af- 
fected only about 15 to 20 per cent 
of the population. In the parks, peo- 
ple queued up for contraceptive dis- 
tribution; pharmacies exhibited con- 
traceptives openly; films on the birth 
process and family planning tech 
niques were shown. This was already 
a break with past prudery and the 
taboos of tradition. 
In rural areas, agricultural co-opera- 
tives began in 1956, followed by 
communes in 1958. For the first time, 
    
  
women worked in the fields, as indi- 
viduals, not as part of a male-gov- 
erned family. They were paid wages 
according to work done, and were 
voting in the co-operatives on com- 
munal projects. Great infra-structural 
works (road building, dams, reservoirs, 
canals) to transform the land caused 
labour shortages in the rural areas 
and millions of women came out to 
work—and thereby to acquire status 
as independent individuals. 
At the same time the Woman's Fed- 
eration also sponsored family planning 
education in rural areas. The Federa- 
tion had been instituted in 1950 to 
achieve countrywide education of 
women, to promote emancipation and 
equality, and the new marriage based 
on individual choices. 
But there was a great deal of tradi- 
tional superstition and ignorance to 
overcome. In the peasant families | 
interviewed, husbands were against 
family planning. One of them, previous 
to liberation in 1949, had had eight 
children who had all died of disease 
and starvation. Now he had remarried 
and wanted another eight. “We have 
so much more to eat, why should we 
not have more children?” 
For the first time, as a result of an

a
increase in crops, there was no star- 
vation in China's countryside, and the 
peasants wanted more children as 
“labour power™ to care for them in 
old age. Also, mothers-in-law, always 
despotic over their sons’ brides, 
wanted grandchildren quickly and es- 
pecially grandsons. And finally, ig- 
norance made many people fear 
contraceptives. “The man becomes 
impotent”... “the woman's skin be- 
comes yellow...” 
On the other hand, the younger 
women, aware of the crippling effect 
of numerous and repeated childbirths 
would ask, “Why should we stay at 
home and just have baby after baby?" 
In those days, however, the conser- 
vative element was far more prominent. 
As a result, in the countryside, family 
planning had an adverse “shock” 
effect upon the peasantry. They really 
felt it was wrong even to discuss the 
matter. The women were too shy to 
talk about it. 
In 1959 and 1960 | was in many 
industrial cities interviewing women 
workers in factories, and it was there, 
for the first time, that | felt the thrill 
of woman's emancipation. During the 
Great Leap Forward of 1958, when 
a stupendous effort was being made 
to step up industrialization, 80 mil- 
lion women who had never worked 
before came out to participate in this 
enormous movement. 
| interviewed a woman of 37, with 
four children, whose husband was a 
worker. She herself had stayed at 
home “to look after the family” until 
in 1958, against her husband's wish- 
es, she mobilized four other house- 
wives, her friends, and all five of 
them started a small “street factory”, 
making pots and pans for the daily 
use of people. Within two years, 
their small factory was producing 
thermostatic equipment for a large in- 
dustrial complex in the city. 
In the years to follow, | found hun- 
dreds of such examples, including 
grandmothers starting “neighbour- 
hood” workshops and street factories. 
Today, there is not a city in China, 
not a street, without its small work- 
shops where self-employed house- 
wives are turning out daily goods, 
including many necessary items and, in 
some cases, complicated equipment 
and spare parts for larger factories. 
A young woman worker | spoke 
with in 1966, now a member of the 
Central Committee, told me that every 
prospective couple in her factory was

A cluster of Chinese children poring 
over comics in Peking. Most of the 
stories recount the exploits of 
revolutionary heroes, 
instructed in family planning. She and 
her fiancé had already decided on the 
number of children they would have. 
Among industrial workers, in China's 
expanding industrial sector, family 
planning is being implanted as a nor- 
mal accompaniment to marriage. 
Everywhere in the cities, the un- 
der-thirties mentioned family planning 
as an essential part of their lives 
—and of their emancipation. “Of 
course we want children, but not to 
be tied down to nappies and the kit- 
chen all the time . . . a woman is as 
good as a man in work . . . we must 
also contribute to the transformation 
of society . . . it is good for our 
health . . . | saw my mother and father 
quarrel all the time because of too 
many babies..." 
Regulations for mother and child 
care have also helped to establish the 
value of a woman's function as mother. 
A woman is entitled to 56 days of 
resting time away from work before 
giving birth, for which she receives 
full pay. In each factory there are 
nurseries, and mothers are given 
breast-feeding time for which they are 
also paid. | visited textile mills where 
one can see women leaving their 
spinning machines and being replaced 
automatically by spare workers, while 
they walk to the nursery nearby to 
feed their baby. During an 8-hour 
work day, each woman may leave the 
bench three times to feed her baby 
for a period of about a half hour. 
Nurseries are placed next to each 
workshop so that women are only 
two or three minutes walk away from 
their infants. 
To relieve working mothers in the 
cities, there are street nurseries. 
Every morning and afternoon, one can 
see quaint little bicycle carriages with 
8 or 10 toddlers being taken to the 
nurseries, by older men, who are called 
“grandfathers”. 
However, about 50 per cent of the 
toddlers are still being cared for at 
home by grandmothers, for in China 
the family still largely consists of 
“three generations living together”. 
Grandmothers thus become an im- 
portant social force, which has its 
good and bad features. On the one 
hand, it makes for a united family; 
on the other, the chief dissent to fam- 
33 
ily planning comes from older women,

### 50347: Family planning: the Chinese experiment

p who often insist, especially in rural 
a4 
areas, on getting their sons married at 
an early age and on having “grand- 
sons” as soon as possible. 
But there are exceptions. In 1966, 
| saw a grandmother in a commune 
who had called on the doctor to have 
her son's wife fitted with a contracep- 
tive, and who went around spreading 
family planning education. 
Today, after the Cultura! Revolution, 
family planning has been solidly 
organized as a nationwide movement, 
under a family planning council direct- 
ed by the Ministry of Health. Branches 
are established at every level, right 
down to the smallest village. Both 
men and women participate in this all- 
out mass drive. The work is unpaid 
and voluntary, with the chief emphasis 
on direct contact: house-to-house 
visits, street meetings of housewives, 
direct talking and persuading. 
Over the last two years this direct 
approach has been used most exten- 
sively. In Peking and other cities, 
each street has its family planners. 
They hold meetings in which every 
family is involved and these meetings 
go on for weeks. Families also have 
many discussions among themselves. 
In one street, Kuang An Men, which 
has about 47,000 people, a collective 
decision was reached to produce no 
more than 360 babies in that street 
during the year 1973. 
This “common decision by consen- 
sus of all the potential childbearers 
(about 13 per cent of the women) in 
the street” was arrived at after each 
case was debated. Families with 
more than two or three children were 
asked to wait, priority for childbearing 
being given to those couples who 
wanted a first or second child. “We 
shall bring our population increase 
down -to 7.5 per thousand, or 0.75 per 
cent, this year”, the street committee 
woman, a young worker of 30, with.one 
child, said to me. ’ 
In 1972, the women employees of 
childbearing age in one administrative 
operation decided not to have more 
than two children each. (Two children 
is the ideal, but three children are 
quite common.) “Of course it is some- 
times difficult when the two are both 
girls. Many women still like to have 
a boy and will try a third time for a

boy.” This example has now been 
emulated by many other organizations 
throughout China. “A girl child is as 
good as a boy child” is a sentence 
now heard everywhere. 
In another organization (a teaching 
institute) a priority system for child- 
bearing was agreed on among the 
staff. A couple without children was 
due to have one; but a woman with 
two girl babies was pregnant again; 
and she insisted that this one was 
going to be a boy. 
“What could be done? She was 
not only having a third child, but she 
was actually taking someone else's 
turn.” The matter was solved, how- 
ever, with another woman voluntarily 
giving up her turn to have a baby, and 
having an abortion instead. This pub- 
lic-spirited self-sacrifice may appear 
strange to other societies, but in China 
one must remember these decisions 
are individual, not enforced, and they 
serve as “examples” to be emulated. 
There are countless anecdotes and 
stories, illustrating the immense debate 
going on today. There is the young 
couple with two children who both got 
a raise in salary, and immediately said, 
“Now we can have another baby"—an 
example of the love of children which 
characterizes the Chinese. 
On the other hand there is the 
example of the two young workers 
who delayed marriage by another two 
years (they had already been engaged 
for two years), to “set an example” 
in late marriage, perhaps the most 
effective method of population control. 
There is the story of the commune 
where 175 young couples voluntarily 
delayed their marriages by one year, 
and the story of a woman who has nine 
children, all of them girls, and will 
continue until she achieves a boy. 
There is the commune in Szechuan 
province, a backward area, where the 
peasants have carved: “Birth control 
is a patriotic duty” on a hillside, and 
the 30-year-old peasant | met in Kuei- 
chow province who had seven children 
and refused to give permission for his 
wife to be sterilized. 
Such contradictory stories are facets 
of a great human transformation; family 
planning becomes a moving drama of 
consciousness, of the emancipation of 
the woman as a total human being, of 
the struggle against tradition and 
ignorance. lt is part of the liberation 
of man too—“Only when woman is 
liberated will man also be liberated.” 
In the industrialized areas, in fac- 
tories, and in the cities, the family 
planning drive has already achieved a 
good measure of success. In the 
Peking area, for instance, 70 per cent’ 
of the city workers (clerical staff; 
workers in factories, etc.) are practis- 
ing family planning. !n Shanghai, an 
even greater effect is reflected in the

population increase rate, which has 
fallen to 0.6 per cent from a high in 
1963 of about 2.5 per cent. In Peking 
the population increase last year was 
1.17 per cent, whereas it was 3.5 per 
cent in 1963. 
But the countryside is also showing 
progress. Thus, in the county of 
Hsingtou, in Szechuan (pop. 500,000), 
12,000 vasectomies were performed 
last year. 
| visited communes in Chekiang 
province in 1971, and found each 
brigade clinic abundantly provided with 
contraceptives, including the oral pill. 
But this was not enough. At that 
time, the “barefoot doctors” were 
responsible for carrying out family 
planning—both in spreading propa- 
ganda and in providing contraceptives. 
They are the young people between 
17 and 21 years old who serve 
3-5 years in the countryside as para- 
medical workers, and whose existence 
—there are 1,300,000 of them—has 
assured the most complete network 
of preventive inoculation measures and 
health care anywhere. 
It has now been found out that they 
are not the ideal medium for this task; 
people of this age are still considered 
by the peasantry as “too young to 
know about such things”.

areas, that the drive for family planning 
is most effective. These women are 
middle-aged, married, with children, 
and practise family planning. 
They are “living examples” that 
family planning works. Painstakingly, 
they will go from family to family, 
propagandizing the women, the men. 
They work with the medical staff, 
with the barefoot doctors and health 
workers. They are trusted and 
accepted by the village women. They 
bring contraceptives to each house, so 
there is no excuse of “being too busy” 
to go to the clinic. 
| visited one commune where every 
morning, the woman secretary stands 
in the fields and shouts to the working 
women: “Have you taken your pill?” 
She checks personally on each and 
everyone of them. Only in this way 
can the oral contraceptive become 
effective. “Most women forget to take 
it... or take it for a little while only... 
But each case is an individual case; 
we cannot force anything or anyone. 
So we give them a wide choice.” 
Since all contraceptives and all 
operations are free of charge, it is up 
to the individual to make up his or her 
mind. Hence, the wide range of con- 
traceptives, and also abortion on 
demand. “But abortion is not the 
answer. We want less and less abor- 
tions, more prevention.” 
How can family planning, without

coercion, without economic pressures, 
but only by education and persuasion,

It implies, above all, a total refusal 
to adopt “emergency” attitudes of 
crisis, to adopt shortcuts and auto- 
cratic methods of pressure. Consider- 
ation for the human factors, for 
emotion and tradition, coupled with a

T. Ghana National Family 
Planning Programme was launched in 
May 1970, following growing concern 
over trends revealed by the 1960 
census. Successive governments 
have supported the project. Its stated 
purpose is to make information and 
services available to every Ghanaian 
couple, so that they may have the 
number of children they themselves 
want, 
In announcing the programme, the 
government summarized the case for 
action in these terms: 
“The rapid growth of Ghana's popu- 
lation poses the greatest threat to 
our economic development and to the 
welfare of our people. Our population 
 
ROBERT PLANT, Uganda-born editor and 
Journalist, is a specialist in social and 
economic problems of developing countries. 
He was senior economics lecturer at the 
International Labour College, Kampala (Ugan- 
da), and is author of "Population and Labour”, 
a study of the consequences of rapid popu- 
lation growth for workers In developing 
countries (ILO, 1973). 
"Social 
increases by 5,000 every week and 
this rate of growth far exceeds the 
rate of growth of our economy. 
“As a nation, we are increasing in 
numbers faster than we can build 
schools to educate our youth, faster 
than we can construct hospitals to 
cater for the health needs of our 
people and faster than we can develop 
our economy to provide jobs for the 
new workers who enter our labour 
force each year.” 
Each year in Ghana more than 4,000 
mothers die as a result of childbirth 
and as many as 40,000 of the children 
who are born do not survive to their 
first birthday. The government states 
frankly that the main reason for these 
appalling figures is the high number of 
closely spaced pregnancies which are 
the lot of many Ghanaian women. The 
government's aim is to ensure that 
each mother has strong healthy babies 
who will flourish, 
Ghana's population increases at 
about three per cent a year. At this 
rate the population will double in little 
more than 20 years. If the rate of 
population growth could be cut down 
to two per cent per annum, it would 
take 12 years longer for the population 
to double. “This”, says the govern- 
ment, “would give us much needed 
time to plan and provide for the future.” 
The promotion of the programme has 
called for the greatest circumspection. 
In Ghana, as in most African countries, 
established cultural practices are pro- 
natalist in their appeal. Desired family 
size is still high and the motivation for 
family planning is generally low. 
National problems resulting from popu- 
lation pressures appear remote to the 
present generation of Ghanaians, 
In his first annual report, the 
Executive Director of the National 
Family Planning Programme, Dr. A. A. 
Armar, pointed out that : “There is 
also the fact that, in the face of 
growing nationalism after long periods 
of colonialist domination, many view 
foreign assistance for family planning 
activities with suspicion. They declare 
that it has the sinister motive of 
corrupting the youth, destroying long 
cherished cultural practices and 
leading to moral depravity.” 
These constraints notwithstanding, 
the programme has made significant 
strides in its efforts at making family 
planning an acceptable life style. By 
the end of June 1972, 140 clinics had 
been established. Over 2,000 licensed 
chemical retailers were distributing 
approved contraceptives of various 
types. The total number of acceptors 
was just under 46,000 and the number 
is steadily growing. New acceptors 
are now coming in at a rate of 2,500 to 
3,000 a month. This is a good start. 
The programme makes full use of 
the many resources, both private and 
public, that exist in Ghana. Thus the 
Ministries of Health, Information, and 
Welfare, along with private 
agencies such as the Planned Parent- 
hood Association and the Christian 
Council of Ghana, are playing an 
important role. The Trades Union 
Congress on its own initiative organ- 
ized a seminar in 1970 to educate mem- 
bers on the need for family planning. 
There are still those who say that 
the existence of undeveloped land in 
Ghana invalidates the argument for the 
regulation of population growth. “They 
do not realize”, says Dr. Armar, 
“what an enormous investment of 
capital would be required over a long 
period before this land could be effec- 
tively developed to support a large 
population. Countries like Ghana 
simply do not have this capital.” 
There is still also some concern, 
sincerely felt in many quarters, that 
family planning will lead to a break- 
down in morality. 
On this point, a promotional leaflet, 
issued by the Ghana National Family 
Planning Programme, had the following 
to say: 
“The truth of the matter is that lack 
of family planning, with its attendant 
evils of overpopulation, overcrowding, 
unemployment, lack of social services 
and inadequate food, leads not only 
to a breakdown of moral behaviour 
but to many other social ills which 
eventually lead to a deterioration of 
society. Family planning is indeed a 
factor which can help build a strong 
and healthy nation.” 
The government does not claim, and 
never has claimed, that family planning 
will solve all Ghana's economic 
problems. Family planning is only one 
of the measures required to ensure 
development of the country’s economy. 
Other measures include agricultural 
development, economic planning, the 
construction of roads, schools and 
hospitals. 
The state of the nation’s economy, 
says Dr. Armar, is reflected in the 
degree to which prosperity and health 
are enjoyed by individuals. “If our 
population continues to increase at the 
present rate, improvement in our living 
standards will be retarded. That is 
why, within the broad framework of 
the national development effort, the 
Ghana National Family Programme 
can be described as one of the most 
promising programmes the govern- 
ment has undertaken.” 
The right balance was perhaps 
struck by Ghana's Head of State, 
Colonel Ingatius K. Acheampong, when 
he said in December 1972: 
“It is doubtful whether over-popu- 
lation is the major problem facing 
Africa today. Africa is the least popu- 
lated of the continents and taken as 
a whole the temptation to argue for 
more people may indeed be great. 
But we live in a world of planning and 
we have a duty to ensure that we 
plan as much for the mouths we are 
going to feed as for the means by 
which we shall feed them.” 
The nation should aim, he said, at 
“the right ratio between the rate of 
growth of the economy and the rate 
of population growth.” |

While certain African countries are opposed to the idea of 
birth control, others have launched national family 
planning programmes (see page 47). The Ghana National 
Family Planning Programme employs every means 
of popular education to spread the family planning message. 
The slogan “Family Planning—Better Life” Is to be seen 
everywhere—on pencils, calendars, posters, booklets, newspaper 
advertisements, car stickers, at the cinema, on the television 
screen. The emphasis is always on human happiness. The 
smiling couples above are depicted on the back of a book of 
strip cartoons entitled “Poverty was my Shadow” which portrays 
how one couple advised their friends to break out of the 
vicious circle of poverty by limiting their family. Top, 
the beginning of a similar story in a play presented by 
travelling actors. Husband and wife fight over money while the 
terrified children try to separate them. The overburdened mother 
already has three children and is expecting a fourth. 
In this way, the population debate Is brought down to the grass 
roots and the homes of the people.   


### 50362: Why people are frightened of family planning: a mother from Kenya explains

Why people A mother ; 
from Kenya | BIS ugh ened 
explains: ~~ planning 
Fe 
by Sarah Lukalo 
ok aS 
F.. planning is nothing new to Africa and 
definitely not to Kenya. For example, my own family— 
although there were ten of us—was very evenly spaced 
out, and in Kenya this was almost universally the case. 
We were all about three years apart, and in fact it was 
considered shameful for women to have children one after 
the other. There was a number of taboos to discourage 
this; one of them being that if you had any sexual relation- 
ship with your husband when you were breast feeding 
your baby, you polluted the milk and you believed that 
your child might die. 
Perhaps one of the reasons why modern family planning 
has become a problem in Kenya concerns methods of 
approach. Traditionally, there are certain topics that one 
can discuss with older people and others one can discuss 
with younger people. But the only people with whom one 
can discuss almost anything are people of one’s own age. 
When modern family planning came to Kenya—and | think 
to almost all African countries—young people were picked 
to be family planning educators, to go and talk to people 
much older than they, people who probably commanded a 
great deal of respect in their own communities. The elders 
were insulted at having to listen to young people talk about 
such issues. 
Another problem is that there was too much discussion 
of family planning, as though it were a new thing. The 
result was that people tended to think that it was indeed 
a new thing. : 
| know quite a number of individuals who would refer to 
family planning field educators as “those girls who Kill 
babies”, and there was a belief that birth control methods 
made one sterile. Many felt that if it were the kind of 
family planning they already knew, there would have been 
some connexion between the traditional way of doing things 
and the new ideas. | think that these are two main reasons 
underlying the difficulties we face today. 
In my view, rather than speaking to people about popu- 
lation growth rates and how much money will be spent to 
lower them, a human approach would be more effective. 
Every woman Is touched by what she can see: her own 
family unit. If, for example, her children are continually 
falling sick and she goes to the hospital almost every 
day, she will be likely to accept the idea of family planning 
if it is suggested, say, as a way of helping her. She will 
surely realize that in spacing her child-bearing more 
rationally, she would be better able to look after her 
children. Perhaps her children face malnutrition, or perhaps 
she herself is simply overworked and cannot give them 
adequate care. In any event, she would be bound to see 
the advantages of family planning. 
On the other hand, information about the national popu- 
lation growth rate is so remote that although she may 
be educated, she will conclude that it is the govern- 
ment's problem and not her own. However, she may feel 
that although she cannot do much about national population 
“planning, she can do something about her own planning 
and thereby help improve the well-being of her family. BH

### 50363: Family planning: the Indonesian experiment

FAMILY 
PLANNING 
the 
Indonesian 
experiment 
by Haryono Suyono 
  
08 HARYONO SUYONO is deputy-chairman 
and co-ordinator of research and development 
of Indonesia's National Family Planning Co- 
ordinating Board, in Jakarta. 
  
0. of the major problems 
which Indonesia—like other develop- 
ing countries—has to tackle is the 
alarming growth of its population. 
With 119 million people in 1971, Indo- 
nesia is today the fifth most populous 
nation in the world, exceeded only by 
China, India, the Soviet Union and the 
United States of America. The 1930 
census listed 61 million in Indonesia, 
hence within forty years our people 
have doubled in number. This tremen- 
dous increase is neutralizing to a large 
extent our efforts for planned develop- 
ment and higher living standards. 
The huge concentration of people 
has caused many social and economic 
disturbances as well as hampering 
development efforts. In an attempt to 
remedy this situation, a national family 
"planning programme was integrated in 
Indonesia's five year development pro- 
gramme in 1970. 
Demographers who work in Indo- 
nesia are reluctant to give a single 
figure for the current growth rate. The 
census in 1971 gave an average annual 
increase of 2.08 per cent, while the 
first preliminary count in 1970-1971 
gave a growth rate of 2.67 per cent. 
There is evidence that growth rates in 
the regions outside Java are higher 
than in Java. 
With the development of basic 
medical and public health services, 
especially after Independence in 1945, 
deaths from epidemics like cholera, 
malaria and others were controlled 
or eliminated altogether. All these 
improvements resulted in a decline in 
the death-rate, which is now believed 
to be 17-19 per 1,000. It is highly 
probable that the mortality decline 
will continue. As a result, the popu- 
lation of Indonesia is bound to continue 
its upward leap.

Another problem is the age compo- 
sition of the population. Like other 
developing countries, Indonesia has a 
young population with a heavy concen- 
tration in the ages 0 to 15. The 
dependency load in Java and Bali, for 
example, is 84 per 100 people. This 
causes heavy burdens for provision 
of schools and other related needs. 
The population aged 10 years and 
over for Indonesia as a whole was 
80.4 million in 1972, 41 per cent had 
no formal education, 33 per cent had 
some primary school education and 
19 per cent had completed primary 
school. In Java and Madura, 93 per 
cent had only some primary education 
or none at all. The remaining seven 
per cent had secondary or higher 
education. 
There are marked regional variations 
in population density, The islands of 
Java, Madura and Bali make up less 
In 1973, Unesco organized a literacy study linked with 
population and family planning in Indonesia, at the request 
of the Indonesian government. Left, a Unesco literacy team makes 
a house-to-house survey to check knowledge of family planning 
in the village of Cikahuripan. Below, in a subsequent 
functional literacy class a housewife reports after group

than seven per cent of the land area, 
but they contain two-thirds of the 
population. Java had a population 
density of 565 persons per square 
kilometre in 1971. This makes it one 
of the most densely populated large 
areas of the world. The density in the 
other islands ranged from only 9 in 
Kalimantan to 37 in Sulawesi. 
Many proposals have been elabor- 
ated for the movement of large num- 
bers of people from Java to the outer 
provinces, These efforts began long 
before the independence of the country 
in 1945. However, the colonial author- 
ities never managed to move as many 
as 60,000 people from Java, even dur- 
ing the period of greatest efforts in 
the 1930s. 
After Independence in 
government continued the colonial 
approach, During the 1950s, a max- 
imum of 40,000 people were moved, 
1945 the 
a negligible number when related to 
the size of the problem. In 1969, the 
year of the largest migration (46,000 
people), the population of Java 
increased by over a million and a 
half! And while the government was 
trying to move people from lava to 
the outer islands, a spontaneous 
migration in the opposite direction was 
occurring which might well have 
resulted in net migration inwards, 
In 1953, a small group began to 
promote family planning. Their early 
efforts were limited to giving inform- 
ation about the aims and ideas of 
family planning and inviting the opin- 
ions of community organizations and 
religious leaders. They provided 
limited services through Maternal and 
Child Health Clinics. These efforts 
culminated in the formation of the 
Indonesian Planned Parenthood Asso- 
ciation, in 1957. 
In 1967, in his speech to the people 
on Independence Day, August 186, 
President Suharto stressed the need 
to adopt family planning programmes, 
and in 1969 the government formed 
a semi-governmental family planning 
council, the National Institute for 
Family Planning. It soon became clear, 
however, that more government invol- 
vement was needed, and a National 
Family Planning Co-ordinating Board 
was created on January 22, 1970. This 
Board co-ordinates all family planning 
activities throughout the country. 
The key elements of the programme 
are communication and provision of 
family planning services. Both are now 
taken to the people, involving, where 
possible, voluntary organizations and 
local leaders. The idea is to motivate 
the people to accept the “norm of 
a small family” and to facilitate its 
adoption by providing advice and ser- 
vices as near as possible to the home. 
If family planning is to be accepted 
as a way of life by the people, an 
understanding of the limiting social- 
psychological factors and other bar- 
riers is essential. The relevant factors 
include: 
— universality of marriage, 
— early age of marriage, 
— obligation of parenthood, 
— desire for sons; 
and also some social-economic factors 
such as: 
— low level of education, 
— low standard of living, 
— the belief that each child has his 
own value.

60 
To counterbalance these, there are 
also many advantages that the pro- 
grammes have enjoyed, including the 
strong support of the government and 
the absence of organized religious or 
social opposition. 
The information and motivation cam- 
paign embraces long-term and short- 
term stategies. The short-term stategy 
comprises three programmes: 
— public information, by use of 
mass media such as television, radio, 
newspapers, magazines, films and 
others. 
— community education, by use of 
workshops, seminars, group talks and 
community-oriented family planning 
campaigns. 
— face-to-face programmes by use 
of specially trained field workers who 
visit eligible couples in their homes, 
making them aware of the possibilities 
of contraception and persuading them 
to become acceptors. 
The aim in the short term is to 
diffuse the idea of family planning and 
eliminate barriers. In the long term, 
population education will be carried 
out both in and out of school, as is the 
practice with other programmes aiming 
at bringing about a change in attitudes 
and behaviour. 
Population education is seen as a 
process going beyond family limitation 
in the narrow sense, to make family 
planning a way of life. Beyond family 
planning as such is our concern for 
the totality of the family... health, edu- 
cation, standard of living, quality of 
life, etc. Family limitation, as we see 
it, should be an integral part of the 
larger fabric of family hfe. 
The relationship between the pro- 
cesses of communication and educa- 
tion is fairly clear. In each case, 
information is provided, persuasion is 
attempted, and changes in attitudes 
and behaviour are reinforced. A re- 
cent paper published by World Educa- 
tion Reports defines the act of edu- 
cating as a sequence of activities that 
incorporate the teaching and learning 
of separate attitudes, skills, ideas and 
facts, a linking together of these ele- 
ments, and obtaining feedback or 
reinforcement from one’s surroundings 
that may or may not cause the person 
to incorporate the new attitude or 
behaviour into his or her personality 
or behaviour. 
Given the structure of the popula- 
tion of Indonesia, and the huge percen- 
tage who are not able to go to school, 
we believe that population education 
is one of the most important means of 
implanting family planning ideas. If we 
combine literacy programmes and 
population education, we have what 
might be termed functional population 
planning—or functional education for 
family life planning, as it has been 
called. 
What has our national family plan- 
ning programme achieved so far? 
In general the level of awareness 
of the people toward the idea of family 
planning has increased tremendously. 
When we did a study in 1968-69 we 
found that the level of knowledge 
about family planning was far below 
50 per cent. Today this level has 
increased to 80 per cent. A recent 
study in Jogjakarta indicated that 82 per 
cent of the respondents had heard of 
family planning and knew that family 
planning was concerned with the 
control and spacing of births. 
Couples who decide to adopt family 
planning have the choice of 2,067 
family planning clinics throughout Java 
and Bali. They can also go to private 
doctors if they wish, and are free to 
- select any method they desire, free of 
charge. Since 1969, 3 million couples 
have used these facilities and become 
new acceptors. 58 per cent are taking 
pills, 35 per cent use an intra-uterine 
device (IUD) and the remainder various 
other methods. 
A recent study in West Java indi- 
cated that the continuation rate of pill 
acceptors after two years was 63 to 
79 per cent, while the figure for [UD 
was 78 to 95 per cent. Other studies 
carried out a year before revealed a 
similar picture. 
Who are the new acceptors? A 
10 per cent sample of all new accep- 
tors during the first semester of 1972 
indicated that more than 54 per cent 
were 30 years of age or below, and 
more than 87 per cent had only ele- 
mentary school or lower education. 
The number of illiterate new acceptors 
was as high as 38 per cent. Peasants 
constituted 57 per cent of all the new 
acceptors. 
Other significant achievements have 
been in the field of face-to-face com- 
munication, training of medical, para- 
medical and motivational personnel, 
research and evaluation, logistics and 
the infrastructure, and a rapid feed- 
back reporting system. All these 
generally have developed with the 
rapid acceleration of the programmes. 
In conclusion, one can say that the 
family planning programme in Indo- 
nesia has been favourably accepted 
by the people. Though the acceptance 
rate is not yet as high as we should 
like in relation to the total population, 
the acceptors are highly motivated. 
We are confident that population 
education and functional literacy pro- 
grammes as part of an integrated 
approach to family planning will even- 
tually spread the acceptance of the 
+ family planning concept throughout 
Indonesia.

For some years now India has organized nation- 
wide family planning campaigns in an effort to 
reduce its birth-rate. These campaigns take 
various forms. The most effective make use of 
traditional media of expression and communi- 
cation, such as dancing, singing, poetry, folk 
tales and puppets, since it has been found that 
the people accept a new idea like family planning 
more readily from familiar folk arts than from

### 50366: Population policy in Latin America; a vast continent where different conditions have produced different answers

Population 
policy 
in Latin 
~ America 
A vast continent 
where different 
conditions 
have produced 
different answers 
L. other regions of the 
world, and perhaps even more than 
others, Latin America is a mosaic of 
widely varying attitudes, criteria and 
standards vis-a-vis the world-wide 
phenomenon which is known as the 
“population explosion”. 
Countries in this region have adopt- 
ed very different and even completely 
opposed positions in their approach 
to this immense problem. There are 
countries, such as Argentina, which 
are categorically in favour of a policy 
of openly encouraging high population 
growth, while others, such as El Salva- 
dor and the Dominican Republic, are 
pursuing a no less categorical policy 
of birth control. 
Whatever their positions, however, 
there is unanimous agreement among 
Latin American governments that the 
formulation of population policy is the 
sovereign right of each country. 
These ‘were the main conclusions 
which emerged from the discussions of 
the Latin American meeting prepara- 
tory to the forthcoming World Popu- 
lation Conference. This was held in 
San José, Costa Rica, last April. 
During the meeting it became clear 
that the governments of the region 
shared a deep preoccupation with the 
phenomenon of population growth, 
matched by an equally deep appreci- 
ation of the diverse political, social and 
economic circumstances obtaining in 
this part of the world. These circum- 
stances inevitably determine the 
approach to population questions 
adopted by each country, 
A study prepared by the United 
* Nations Economic Commission for 
Latin America (CEPAL), which was 
used as a basis for debate at the Costa 
Rica meeting, divides Latin American 
countries into five categories according 
to their attitudes on matters of popu- 
lation policy. These are as follows: 
1 Countries whose governments 
have declared themselves In 
favour of accelerated popula- 
tion growth. This is the case of Argen- 
tina and Uruguay. 
According to the Argentinian repre- 
sentative at the Costa Rica meeting, 
“Latin America should defend popu- 
lation growth as a positive factor in 
development.” Argentina's new popu- 
lation policy has two main objectives: 
to increase the population at a more 
rapid rate and to ensure a more 
balanced distribution of the population 
throughout the country. 
This means that “the country's 
 
demographic patterns must be chang- 
ed in order to ensure a high growth 
rate and thereby occupy our territory 
more efficiently, develop our resources 
to the full and be able to rely upon an 
adequate domestic market”, etc. 
2 Countries whose governments 
consider that the present popu- 
lation statistics and their estim- 
ated future trends are satisfactory 
and that in consequence the State 
should avoid setting population stan- 
dards and objectives. This is the 
position of Brazil and Peru. 
The government of the latter country 
considers that understanding of the 
world population problem would gain 
in amplitude and depth if there were to 
be an objective analysis of existing 
relationships between demographic, 
social, economic and political factors. 
The Peruvian delegate to the Costa 
Rica meeting stressed the vital import- 
ance of “pointing out and rejecting the 
fallacy of those who consider that the 
problems of Peru (in other words, the 
problems characteristic of a developing 
country) are caused by high population 
growth and that the solution to these 
problems lies in curbing it." 
The fact is, he declared, there is no 
harm in a demographic growth rate of 
2.9 per cent “in a country with plenty 
of space and an adequate quantity and 
variety of natural resources, as is the 
case in Peru. The Revolutionary 
Government and the Peruvian people 
must therefore concentrate their 
attention and all their efforts on finding 
a radical solution to all those problems 
of a structural order which constitute

the real source of difficulty for the 
people of Peru.” 
The Brazilian Delegate, Miguel 
A. Ozorio de Almeyda, emphasized the 
fact that in a number of Latin American 
countries a considerable population 
increase is essential for acceleration 
of their economic development. 
3 The third group consists of 
countries whose governments 
have stated their intention of 
taking action through nation-wide pro- 
grammes designed to have long-term 
effects on their birth-rates, but which 
have refrained from setting definite 
population objectives. This group 
includes Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, 
Costa Rica, Chile, Guatemala, Nicara- 
gua, Panama and perhaps to some 
extent Ecuador. 
Mexico is applying a qualitative 
rather than a quantitative population 
policy, whose essential aim is “to raise 
the standard of living of all Mexicans” 
and to make every effort “to provide 
greater opportunities for all with a 
view to bringing about continued 
change, and not as a limitation to 
protect privileges.” 
Cuba considers that under-develop- 
ment problems are not caused by 
population growth at all, and its efforts 
have therefore been directed not at 
controlling demographic processes, 
but at bringing about structural change 
aimed at stimulating development. 
The Cuban representative at the meet- 
ing expressed the view that a rigid 
population policy can only be defined 
in the context of overall development 
policy, which it should reinforce and 
  
complement; the history of world popu- 
lation growth shows that the adoption 
of population control is a corollary to 
development, not a prerequisite. 
Within the same group, Guatemala 
also maintains that birth control is not 
the universal panacea, the unique for- 
mula for the solution of problems of 
population and their consequences. 
There is no national family planning 
policy in Guatemala, but there exist 
family guidance programmes adapted 
to the attitudes and motivations speci- 
fic to the Guatemalan people. 
4 CEPAL comprises those coun- 
tries whose governments sup- 
port special family planning program- 
mes at local level or on a limited scale. 
S sists of countries which have 
formulated and applied overall 
policies designed to reduce popula- 
tion: El Salvador, the Dominican 
Republic and Honduras. 
El Salvador, a country with high 
population density and intense demo- 
graphic growth, advocates the formu- 
lation of an integrated population 
policy which its delegate defined as“a 
series of actions planned and co- 
ordinated by the public authorities”, 
aimed at bringing about the greatest 
possible individual, family and social 
well-being by means of the “rationaliz- 
ation of population dynamics.” 
Finally, in the Dominican Republic, 
another of the decidedly antinatalist 
Latin American countries, the govern- 
ment gives its unqualified support to 
The fourth group identified by 
The fifth and final group con-

every type of action aimed at curbing 
the birth-rate, and actively promotes 
family planning programmes to enable 
couples to avoid unwanted pregnancies 
and to have children who are wanted 
at the time they believe to be right. 
It must be pointed out that these 
widely divergent attitudes to population 
policy are determined by numerous and 
extremely varied factors, some of 
which are common to the world at 
large and others which are confined 
to Latin America. 
Without attempting to make an 
analysis, which would of necessity be 
a big and complicated task, one can 
list some of these factors. They are: 
population growth index (with radical 
differences such as that between 
Argentina's 1.2 and Costa Rica's 3.8); 
density of population (EI Salvador has 
a “European” population density, while 
Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia have vast 
areas of virtually uninhabited territory); 
the ethnic composition of the popula- 
tion (countries with a very large Indian 
or mixed-blood population such as 
Mexico, Peru, etc., or with a population 
of essentially European origin, such 
as those of the “Cono Sur"); wealth or 
scarcity of natural resources; psycho- 
logical and cultural factors, the type of 
general policy applied in each country. 
With so many variables, it is not 
surprising that Latin America does not 
speak with one voice in the great 
population debate. |

LET'S 
SUPPOSE... 
A tale for the 
year 3550 A.D. 
by Isaac Asimov 
To 
ISAAC ASIMOV, noted American scientist and science fiction writer, is 
the author of over 60 books, ranging from a textbook on biochemistry 
(he is associate professor of biochemistry ~t Boston University School of 
Medicine) to a small book on man-made satellites for eight year olds. 
According to the [atest edition of Unesco's “Index Translationum--, he is the 
world's most translated author of science fiction (37 translations in 1971). 
This article is taken from his forthcoming book for children, = Earth: Our 
og do NV: [Yo BY oF: Tol -X1 TI BAG £0 0 oT: published next month under tha auspices of 
UNICEF, by John Day Co.. New York. The text is copyright ¢ 1974 by

Soros the whole world 
became industrialized and that indus- 
try and science worked very carefully 
and very well. How many people 
could such a world support? Different 
limits have been suggested, but the 
highest figure | have seen is 20 billion. 
How long will it be before the world 
contains so many people? 
For the sake of argument, and to 
keep things simple, let's suppose the 
demographic growth rate will stay as 
it is now at two per cent per annum. 
At this rate, it will take 35 years for 
the population to double, so it will 
take the present world population of 
3.8 billion 70 years to reach the 15.2 
billion mark. Then, fifteen more years 
will bring the world population to our 
20 billion. In other words, at the 
present growth rate our planet will 
contain all the people that an indus- 
trialized world may be able to support 
by about 2060 A.D. That is not a 
pleasant outlook for only 85 years 
from now. 
Suppose we decide to ‘hope for the 
best. Let us suppose that a change 
will take place in the next 70 years 
and that there will be a new age in 
which population can continue rising 
to a far higher level than we think it 
can now. This means that there will 
be a new and higher limit, but before 
that is reached, still another change 
will take place, and so on. Let's 
suppose that this sort of thing can 
just keep on going forever. 
Is there any way of setting a limit 
past which nothing can raise the 
human population no matter how many 
changes take place? 
Suppose we try to invent a real 
limit; something so huge that no one 
can imagine a population rising past 
it. Suppose we imagine that there are 
so many men and women and children 
in the world, that altogether they weigh 
as much as the whole planet does. 
Surely you can’t expect there can be 
more people than that. 
Let us suppose that the average 
human being weighs 60 kilogrammes. 
If that's the case then 
100,300,000,000,000,000,000,000 people 
would weigh as much as the whole 
Earth does. That number of people is 
30,000,000,000,000 times as many 
people as there are living now. 
It may seem to you that the popu- 
lation can go up a long, long time 
before it reaches the point where there 
are 30,000,000,000,000 times as many 
people in the world as there are today. 
Let's think about that, though. Let us 
suppose that the population growth- 
rate stays at 2.0 per cent so that the 
number of people in the world con- 
tinues to double every 35 years. How 
long, then, will it take for the world's 
population to weigh as much as the 
entire planet? 
The answer is—not quite 1,600 years. 
This means that by 3550 A.D., the 
human population would weigh as 
much as the entire Earth. Nor is 
1,600 years a long time. It is consider-

ably less time than has passed since 
the days of Julius Caesar. 
Do you suppose that perhaps in the 
course of the next 1,600 years, it will 
be possible to colonize the Moon and 
Mars, and the other planets of the 
Solar system? Do you think that we 
might get many millions of people into 
the other world in the next 1,600 years 
and thus lower the population of the 
Earth itself? 
Even if that were possible, it 
wouldn't give us much time. If the 
growth-rate stays at 2.0 per cent, then 
in a little over 2,200 years—say, by 
4220 A.D.—the human population 
would weigh as much as the entire 
Solar system, including the Sun. 
We couldn't escape to the stars, 
either. Even if we could reach them; 
even if we could reach all of them; 
population would reach a Imit. If the 
growth-rate stays at 2.0 per cent, then 
in 4,700 years—by about 6700 A.D.— 
the human population would weigh as 
much as the entire Universe. 
So you see we can't go on forever 
at the rate we are going. The popu- 
lation rise is going to have to stop 
somewhere. We just can't keep that 
2.0 per cent growth-rate for thousands 
of years. We just can't, no matter 
what we do. 
L.. try again, and let's be 
more reasonable. Suppose we go back 
to considering the density of popula- 
tion on Earth. 
Right now, the average density of 
population on Earth is 25 per km2. If 
the population of the world doubles 
then the average density of population 
also doubles, since the area of the 
world's surface stays the same. This 
means that at a population growth-rate 
of 2.0 per cent per year, the average 
density of population in the world will 
double every 35 years. 
In that case, if the growth-rate stays 
where it is, how long will it take for 
the average density of population to 
become 18,600/km2?? Such a density 
is almost 750 times as high as the 
present density, but it will be reached, 
at the present growth-rate, in just 
about 340 years. 
Of course, this density is reached 
only if human beings are confined to 
the land surface of the world. Perhaps 
human beings will learn to live on the 
bottom of the ocean, or on great plat- 
forms floating on the sea. There is 
more than twice as much ocean sur- 
face as there is land surface and that 
would give more room for people, 
That wouldn't do much good, how- 
ever, At the present growth rate, it 
would take only 45 additional years 
to fill the ocean surface, too. In 385 
years, the average density of popu- 
fation would be 18,600/km? over land 
and sea both. That would be by 
about 2320 A.D. 
But a density of 18,600/km? is the 
average density of population of the 
island of Manhattan. 
Imagine a world in which the average 
density everywhere, over land and sea 
alike—everywhere—in Antarctica and 
Greenland, over the oceans and along 
the mountains, over the entire face of 
the globe—was equal to that of Man- 
hattan. There would have to be sky- 
scrapers everywhere. There would be 
hardly any open space There would 
be no room for wilderness or for any 
plants and animals except those 
needed by human beings. 
Very few people would imagine a 
world like that could be comfortable, 
yet at the present growth-rate we will 
reach such a world in only 385 years. 
But let's not pick Manhattan. Let's 
try the Netherlands. It is a pleasant, 
comfortable nation, with open land 
and gardens and farms. It has a 
standard of living that is very high and 
yet its average population density is 
400/km2, How long would it take for 
our population to increase to the point 
where the average density of the sur- 
face of the world, sea and land, would 
be 400/km?2 7? 
The answer is 200 years, by about 
2175 AD. 
You see, then, that if we don’t want 
to go past the average population 
density of the Netherlands, we can't 
keep our present growth-rate going 
even for hundreds of years, let alone 
thousands. 
In fact, we might still be arguing in 
an unreasonable way. Can we really 
expect to have a world-wide Nether- 
lands in the next 200 years ? 
No one really believes that man- 
kind can spread out over the ocean 
bottom or the ocean top in the next 
200 years. It is much more likely that 
man will stay on land. To be sure, 
there may be some people who would 
be living off shore in special structures, 
on the sea or under it. They would 
make up only a small fraction of all 
mankind. Almost everybody will be 
living on land. 
Then, too, not every place on land 
is desirable. It isn't at all likely that 
there will be very many people living 
in Antarctica or in Greenland or in the 
Sahara Desert or along the Himalaya 
Mountain range over the next 200 
years. There may be some people 
living there, more people than are liv- 
ing there now, but they will represent 
only a small fraction of the total 
population of the Earth. 
In fact, most of the Earth's land sur- 
face isn’t very suitable for large popu- 
lations. At the present moment, most 
of the Earth's population is squeezed 
into that small portion of Earth's land 
surface that is not too mountainous, 
too dry, too hot, too cold, or too 
uncomfortable, generally. In fact, two- 
thirds of the world’s population is to 
be found on a little over 1/13 of the 
land surface of the planet. About 
2,500,000,000 people are living on 
11,000,000 sq. km. of land that can 
best support a high population. 
“population 
The average density on the 
11,000,000 square kilometres of the 
best land is 230/km2, while the aver- 
age density on the rest of the land 
surface is just under 10/km2, 
Suppose the population continues 
to increase at the present growth-rate 
and the distribution remains the same. 
In that case, after 30 years, the aver- 
age population density of the less 
pleasant parts of the Earth will reach 
the 19/km2 figure, but the density of 
the 11,000,000 square kilometres of 
best land will be 400/km2, 
In other words, we will reach a kind 
of world-wide Netherlands density- 
figure, for as far as we can go, in only 
about 30 years. 
But will all the world be as well- 
organized and as prosperous as the 
Netherlands is now? Some of the 
reasons why the Netherlands is as 
well off as it is now, are that it has 
a stable government, a highly-educated 
population, and a well-organized 
industrial system. 
This is not true of all nations and 
they need not expect to be as well off 
as the Netherlands when they are as 
crowded as the Netherlands. Indeed, 
if they have an agricultural way of life 
and a poorly-educated people, who 
don't have long traditions of stable 
government, then a population as 
dense as that of the Netherlands now 
is, would only bring misery. 
1. other words, the world 
can't keep going at the present growth- 
rate, even for tens of years, let alone 
for hundreds or thousands. 
The matter of a population limit is 
not a problem for the future, then. 
We might just as well realize that the 
world is just about reaching its popu- 
lation limit now. 
Of course, this entire argument is 
based on the supposition that the 
population growth-rate will stay the 
same as it is now. If the growth-rate 
drops, that obviously will give us more 
time before the limit is reached. If it 
drops to zero, the limit will never be 
reached. Even a 1 per cent per year 
increase, however, is 
enough to bring disaster. So we can't 
just sit back and do nothing. We will 
have to do something. [|

### 50370: From Confucius to Malthus: since antiquity men have asked: 'Is there an optimum population?'

66 
From 
  
Confucius 
to Malthus... 
Since antiquity men have asked: 
‘Is there an optimum population? 
M.. has been concerned 
with population problems since ancient 
times. From antiquity, statesmen and 
thinkers have held opinions, based on 
political, military, social and economic 
considerations, about such issues as 
the most desirable number of people 
or the need to stimulate or retard 
population growth, 
Ideas and theories on population 
have nearly always revolved round the 
real or supposed problems of individual 
societies and have stimulated the most 
response ‘when directed specifically 
towards those problems. Thus the 
ideas of the philosophers of ancient 
Greece dealt mainly with the population 
questions faced by the city-state with 
a relatively small population. In the 
Roman Empire the views on population 
reflected the populationist outlook of 
a society in which population was 
considered a source of power. 
The thesis that excessive population 
growth may reduce output per worker, 
depress levels of living for the masses 
and engender strife is of great antiquity. 
It appears in the works of Confucius 
and his school, as well as in the works 
of other ancient Chinese philosophers. 
Some of these writings suggest that 
the authors had some concept of 
optimum population, as far as the 
population engaged in agriculture was 
concerned. Postulating an ideal pro- 
portion between land and population, 
they held the government primarily 
responsible for maintaining such a 
proportion by moving people from 
over-populated to under-populated 
areas, although noting also that govern- 
ment action was reinforced at times by 
spontaneous migration. 
These ancient Chinese writers also 
paid some attention to another aspect 
which has occupied an important place 
in subsequent literature on population 
theory, that is, the checks to population 
growth. They observed that mortality 
increases when food supply is in- 
sufficient, that premature marriage 
makes for high infant mortality rates, 
that war checks population growth and 
that costly marriage ceremonies reduce 
the marriage rates, although they paid 
little attention to the manner in 
which numbers adjusted to resources. 
Despite these views on population and 
resources, the doctrines of Confucius 
regarding family, marriage and pro- 
creation were essentially favourable to 
population increase. 
The writers of early Greece were 
more concerned with the formulation 
of policies and rules for population 
than with theories about it. Plato and 
Aristotle discussed the question of the 
“optimum” population with respect to 
the Greek city-state in their ‘writings 
on the ideal conditions for the full 
development of man’s potential. 
They considered the problem of 
population size not so much in 
economic terms, but more from the 
point of view of defence, security and 
government. The thought was that 
population should be self-sufficient, 
and thus possess enough territory to 
supply its needs but not be so large 
as to render constitutional govern- 
ment impossible. 
The more specific observations on 
these conditions were made by Plato, 
particularly in his Laws. He held that 
if the so-called “highest good” was to 
be achieved, the city-state should have 
5,040 citizens. Since the actual course 
of demographic trends might result 
in either an excess or a shortage 
of population, Plato also proposed 
measures to be taken in order to 
maintain the desired size. In the case 
of under-population, he recommended 
rewards, advice or rebuke to the young 
in order to increase the birth-rate, and, 
in the last resort, immigration. To 
remedy over-population he proposed 
birth control for large families and, if 
necessary, colonization. 
Aristotle dealt with population 
problems particularly in his Politica. 
 
He was less specific than Plato on the 
matter of optimum population but 
stated that in size and extent the State 
should be such as to enable the in- 
habitants to live at once temperately 
and liberally in the enjoyment of leisure. 
He held that land and property could 
not be increased as rapidly as the 
population would grow and concluded 
that an excessive number of inhabitants 
would breed poverty and social ills. 
Among the factors which could prevent 
an excessive population he mentioned 
child exposure and abortion. 
The Romans viewed population 
questions in the perspective of a great 
empire rather than a small city-state. 
They were less conscious than the 
Greeks of possible limits to population 
growth and more alert to its ad- 
vantages for military and related pur- 
poses. Perhaps because of this 
difference in outlook, Roman writers 
paid less attention to population than 
the Greeks. Cicero rejected Plato's 
communism in wives and children and 
held that the State's population must 
be kept up by monogamous marriage. 
The preoccupation with population 
growth, the disapproval of celibacy and 
the view of marriage as primarily and 
fundamentally for procreation was 
mainly reflected in the Roman legis- 
lation of that time. Particularly the 
laws of Augustus, creating privileges 
for those married and having children 
and discriminating financially against 
those not married, aimed at raising the 
marriage and birth-rates.

much emphasis on procreation and 
multiplication and, for this reason, 
unfruitfulness was regarded as a 
serious misfortune. In general, Orien- 
tal philosophers appear to have favour- 
ed fertility and multiplication. An 
exponent of some of the views on 
population for the period dating back 
to some three to four centuries B.C. is 
Arthasastra, a book written as a guide 
for rulers and attributed to Kautalya. 
The work discusses such aspects as 
the desirability of a large population 
as a source of military and economic 
power (although recognizing that the 
population may become too large); 
the effects of war, famine and pesti- 
lence, and the colonization and settle- 
ment of new areas. 
Early and medieval Christian writers 
considered questions of population 
almost entirely from a moral and ethical 
standpoint. Their doctrines were 
mainly populationist but less so than 
those of Hebrew writers. On the one 
hand, they condemned polygamy, 
divorce, abortion, infanticide and child 
exposure; on the other, they glorified 
virginity and continence and frowned 
upon second marriage. 
The main arguments in favour   
of celibate practices are found in 
the teachings of St. Paul. Some early 
Christian defenders of ecclesiastical 
celibacy resorted to economic argu- 
ments not unlike some of those later 
used by Malthus. Referring to the 
growth of the known world's popu- 
lation, they attributed want and poverty 
to this cause and cited pestilence, 
famine, war, etc. as nature's means 
of reducing excess population. 
The prevailing tendency, however, 
was to favour, as in earlier times, 
population growth. The high mortality 
which was found everywhere and the 
constant threat of sudden depopulation 
through famine, epidemics and wars 
predisposed most writers towards the 
maintenance of a high birth-rate. The 
opposition to birth control, for instance, 
was based not only on church doctrine 
but also on a fear of depopulation. 
The views of Muslim authors on 
population resemble those of the 
Hebrew and Christian authors. Special 
mention should be made, however, of 
the interesting but long unrecognized 
work by [bn Khaldoun, an Arab author 
of the fourteenth century. His opinions 
are noteworthy in two respects, 
In the first place, he held that a 
densely settled population was con- 
ducive to higher levels of living since 
it permitted a greater division of 
labour, a better use of resources and 
military and political security. 
Secondly, he maintained that a 
State's periods of prosperity alternate 
with periods of decline and that cyclical 
variations in the population occur in

s 
rhythm with these economic fluc- 
tuations. Favourable economic con- 
ditions and political order stimulate 
population growth by increasing natality 
and checking mortality. In the wake 
of these periods of economic progress 
come luxury, rising taxes and other 
changes which in several generations 
produce political decline, economic 
depression and depopulation. 
At the dawn of the modern era, the 
emergence of the nation-states and the 
related issue of power led mercantilist 
writers to emphasize once again the 
advantages, both political and econ- 
omic, of a large population. Malthus’s 
contrary theory had its roots in 
political, economic and social issues 
which existed during his time. The 
same can be said of Marxist views on 
population. 
More recent developments in popu- 
lation theories have been influenced 
predominantly by two factors. The first 
of these was the upsurge of population 
growth, especially in the developing 
countries. This fact has created a 
need for a better understanding of the 
factors in population growth. Secondly, 
the nearly universal preoccupation with 
the problems of development has 
called for a considerably more pen- 
etrating theoretical framework for 
assessing the interrelations between 
population and economic and social 
development. 
The search for an acceptable popu- 
lation theory has thus gained 
importance. If such a theory could be 
elaborated, it would provide a better 
insight into the development process, 
and could constitute a basic element 
in policy-making and planning for 
development. |

A COMPUTER WARNING 
OF HUNGER TOMORROW 
(Continued from page 34) 
circumstances no population policy 
could function any more. 
Starvation would not be limited to 
isolated small areas from which people 
could escape, but would extend its 
stranglehold over vast regions inhab- 
ited by hundreds of millions. The 
population would be trapped and 
there would be no fertile areas to go 
to as the recent events in semi-arid 
Africa have so tragically shown. There 
is no historical precedent for this kind 
of slow, inexorable destruction of the 
population of entire regions which at 
their peak were inhabited by several 
billion people. 
No doubt these events would 
eventually lead to an equilibrium 
population, and one might see this as 
a return to the days before the popu- 
lation explosion took place, i.e. to the 
times when birth-rate and death-rate 
were nearly in balance. But, surely, 
this must not be allowed to happen. 
Obviously a solution requires a more 
effective population policy. 
Third scenario 
In the third scenario we have 
assumed that the equilibrium fertility 
rates are achieved in 25 to 30 years 
rather than in 50 years as in the first 
scenario. Possibly an optimistic as- 
sumption, but certainly one that should 
be achievable. 
Even under these more favourable 
conditions the analysis shows that 
severe malnutrition cannot be avoided 
unless food imports are made avail- 
able, but the required imports are, this 
time, on a much smaller scale and the 
really large needs appear at a later 
date than in previous scenarios, 
starting in the 1990s rather than the 
1980s. 
Also, the amount of food which 
would have to be covered by imports 
would be reduced to about one fifth 
of the needs. The volume of the 
imports, in reference to production, 
transportation, etc.,, might then be 
manageable, but the economic impact 
of food import would still be devastat- 
ing. The problem, however, would be 
reduced to economics. 
Fourth scenario 
In order to see how this cost-eco- 
nomic obstacle to the solution might 
be removed, we designed the fourth 
scenario in which we assumed that 
investment ald is provided to South 
Asia In sufficient amounts and at the 
required time to close the food gap. 
The magnitude of such a programme 
would require a concerted action by 
all regions of the “North”. 
The analysis indicated a substan- 
tial increase in the export potential of 
South Asia, If the world economic 
situation realizes this great potential, 
South Asia could pay for the bulk of 
the necessary food import. The export 
must be industrial, since the agricul- 
tural sector will be occupied with the 
demands of the region. 
This means that South Asia must 
be allowed to develop its own export- 
able and competitive industrial special- 
ization which will not be left to the 
mercy of narrow national interests but 
rather will rely on long-term world 
economic arrangements. This, in turn, 
will require the emergence of a new 
global economic order in which indus- 
trial specialization corresponds to 
regional capacities, the most effective 
utilization of labour and capital and of 
available world resources, on a long- 
term basis. 
To summarize, the only feasible 
strategy to meet the world food situa- 
tion calls for: 
® a global approach to the problem; 
‘@® productive investment and not only 
commodity aid; 
® balanced 
for all regions; 
‘@® a world-wide diversification of in- 
dustry leading to a truly global and 
balanced economic system; 
@® an effective population policy. 
This strategy is also the conclusion 
reached by our model for every other 
sector of human activity. Omission 
of any one of these factors will lead 
to certain disaster. 
The situation is urgent. The solution 
produced by our analysis requires 
changes which cannot be achieved 
without compromise among the many 
parties involved. Even if the will is 
there, how much time is left for us to 
argue about the many details of 
implementation? 
The results of our analysis show 
that achieving the aims of the popu- 
lation policy in 30 rather than 15 years 
would make a difference of 80 per 
cent to the number of births. A mere 
20 years delay in initiating such a 
policy would lead to a 300 per cent 
increase. The inescapable conclusion 
is that time is indeed short. Delay in 
implementing the options to bring 
food supply and need in balance could 
be fatal. |

‘All our 
estimates 
are 
inflated...’ 
...In our forecasts for 1940-60 we 
were caught off our guard. We 
underestimated, not the magnitude of 
population growth but its acceleration. 
Some of the experts have now been 
caught out by the opposite phenom- 
enon, the deceleration of population 
growth. In point of fact, the decline 
in birth-rates which we are about to 
see on a world scale has already set 
in much more steeply in some cases 
than was foreseen even on the so- 
called low fertility assumption. Such 
cases will be a majority in the future... 
All our present estimates are inflat- 
ed... They were obtained by extra- 
polation from previous situations which 
are now changing and in some cases 
reversing... The rate of deceleration 
is even more alarming than the pre- 
vious acceleration... Since 1955 the 
brakes have been applied sharply in 
Eastern Europe, since 1957 in the 
United States and since 1962 in West- 
ern Europe. In fact, we are entering 
a phase of neither acceleration nor 
deceleration but of demographic stop- 
go which, one way or another, may 
well cost us dear... 
Nothing could be unhealthier than 
the obsessive fear of life which has 
been fanned abroad. Surely, it would 
be better not to apply the brakes, if 
we have to step on the accelerator 
again soon afterwards. Spasmadic 
population growth is the enemy of 
harmonious social development and 
an effective education policy.

Fair Play Awards 
British soccer star Bobby Charlton and 
the British cycling team of lan Hallam, 
Willie Moore, Mick Bennett and Rick Evans 
were awarded the 1973 Pierre de Couber- 
tin International Fair Play Trophies at a 
ceremony at Unesco House on June 7. 
Bobby Charlton's award was for a career 
cited as an example of “fair play, modesty 
and sporting spirit.” The cycling team was 
honoured for declining first place in the 
finals of the world cycling championships 
at San Sebastian, Spain, after the Fed.

fell because of an error by an official. 
Diplomas of honour were awarded to 
British tennis player Roger Taylor and to 
the Brazilian University basketball team. 
Museums in Africa 
Museum curators and specialists from 
15 English-speaking African countries have 
urged that greater use be made of travell- 
ing exhibitions so as to help museums 
become part of everyday Ife in Africa. 
At a Unesco regional round-table in Lagos, 
Nigeria, they also recommended more 
exchanges of museum staff in the same 
linguistic region. 
Drivers’ behaviour 
In an attempt to explain “the startling 
differences between accident rates in 
various countries”, the International Driver's 
Behaviour Research Association has includ- 
ed a study of drivers’ opinions and attitudes 
in its current research programme. Other 
studies will investigate accident black spots 
and motorway behaviour. The intensified 
programme follows last October's interna- 
tional conference on driver behaviour at 
Zurich, the first of its kind ever held, to 
which 430 persons, mostly road safety 
experts, came from 33 countries. 
Teaching via satellite 
The recent launching of the ATS-F 
communication satellite from Cape Kennedy 
(U.S.A) promises to be a landmark in 
education. After a year's use in the U.S.A, 
the satellite will begin instructional tele- 
vision in India. With Unesco's help, the 
Indian Government has prepared courses 
on agriculture, health and family life, to 
reach 5,000 villages. Unesco missions to 
investigate the use of satellites for edu- 
cation have already visited Africa, Pakistan 
and the Arab States, and a feasibility study 
for a regional tele-education system in nine 
  
Latin American countries has been 
completed.

Letters to 
THE REAL STUMBLING BLOCK 
 
Sir, 
| wish to congratulate you on your 
May 1974 issue on population, and 
particularly on the clarity of the visual 
presentation. | read with interest the 
opposing articles by Frank Notestein 
and Julian Simon on the relation bet- 
ween birth-rate and economic develop- 
ment. In point of fact, they are probably 
both right, for the world provides many 
examples of developing countries where 
the Notestein thesis clearly seems to 
be correct, while one could also point 
to examples of industrialized countries 
and some potentially rich but sparsely 
populated countries where Simon's 
point of view is apparently justified. 
But what surprises me is that each 
of these two writers declares that the 
problem of demographic growth in the 
world is not connected to that of avail- 
able natural resources. They are extra- 
ordinarily casual about this matter and 
seem to take refuge in a blind faith 
in the omnipotence of technology. 
If it is true that “the world has never 
been so close to being able to obtain 
a supply of basic resources beyond the 
imaginings of all previous generations” 
(Notestein), or that “we now have avail- 
able to us vastly more resources of 
almost every kind than did people in 
any previous age” (Simon), it is un- 
fortunately quite as true that the rate 
of growth of these resources has great 
difficulty In keeping up with the com- 
bination of demographic growth and the 
higher living standards demanded by 
more and more people. 
This struggle is particularly dramatic 
in the case of food, and if Notestein 
is right to point out that "The less 
developed nations of dense settlement 
need to triple their food supply by the 
end of the century”, he does not seem 
to be aware of the effort this will 
require, even if they manage to achieve 
it. In the same way, his comments on 
"an almost unlimited supply of cheap 
energy” are to say the least surpris- 
ing, at a time when the price of oil 
has quadrupled and the future of energy, 
especially nuclear energy, raises in- 
numerable questions. 
| believe, on the contrary, that the 
limitation of natural resources on a 
limited planet, and certainly the diffi- 
culties and delays inherent in their 
ever-increasing consumption, especially 
as far as food is concerned, are one 
of the essential factors to consider in 
what is usually called the world popu- 
lation problem.

A DISCOVERY IN ART 
Sir, 
Bravo for your April 1974 issue on 
archaeology and art, and particularly 
for the article on Onufri, the great 
16th-century Albanian painter of fantasy 
and realism. Until now his work has 
been virtually urf<xnown, in spite of its 
great significance in the development 
of post-Byzantine art. 
His painting of the Baptism of Christ 
is a nch composition, and the face 
of God the Father, looking down from 
a luminous schematic cloud above, 
clearly shows the influence of Western 
art. 
Unfortunately, thls great painter is 
unknown in our country and does not 
figure In handbooks of Christian and 
Byzantine archaeology.

MANDRAKE 
THE MAGICIAN... 
 
Sir, 
| read the June 1974 issue of the 
“Unesco Courier” with great interest. 
Among the pictures Illustrating the 
article by Hakim Mohammed Said are 
two on page 37 depicting the mand- 
rake, a plant about which | have written 
a short study. {In “Annales de la So- 
ciété d'Horticulture et d'Histoire Natu- 
relle de I'Hérault”, n®® 3-4, 1966). 
There can be no doubt that the 
Muslim doctors shown in the miniature 
are examining a genuine mandrake, 
recognizable by Its forked root, its 
corona of leaves and its flowered stems. 
On the other hand, the large photo on 
the left of the page represents an imit- 
ation mandrake of the type mentioned 
in the caption. It is a root or a piece 
of wood which has been carved in 
human form. 
Dr. D, larry 
Faculty of Medicine 
Montpellier, France 
The object in the picture we published 
is from the collection of Monsieur Roger 
Caillois, who has sent us the following 
reply. —Ed. 
Dr. Jarry casts doubt, not on the 
authenticity of the object shown, but 
on its botanical species, and with 
reason. - 
| accept Dr. lJarry’s comments as 
perfectly accurate, though they hardly 
needed making. The root | possess is 
not necessarily a root of the botanical 
species mandrake, but a magical “mand- 
rake” named after the much sought- 
after medicinal plant. Its extreme rarity 
caused countless imitations to be made 
by retouching suitable roots in such 
a way as to give them a human appear- 
ance. It is quite possible that mand- 
rakes used for magical purposes were 
never made from the real thing, in the 
botanical sense. This is made clear in 
Dr. Jarry’s scholarly study. It is more 
than likely indeed that sorcerers and 
charlatans did not even bother to look 
for this extremely rare plant, but instead 
used roots which looked somewhat 
similar. 
My specimen comes from the Millau 
region (France). It was found near a 
petrifying fountain, which explains its 
preservation. It is an “authentic fake”, 
so to speak. From the strict botanical 
point of view, almost all “mandrakes” 
are such fakes. 
CELTIC HERITAGE 
  
Sir, 
Laurent David, of France, (Letters 
to the Editor, May 1974) calls attention 
to Celtic Civilization. We have received 
something of this heritage, as descen- 
dants of the Celts here in Wales. 
Celtic remains here are not plentiful, 
but though the visual arts suffered, the 
art of the poet took pride of place 
from the sixth century onwards. 
It is often said that there were no 
“Dark Ages” in Wales and Ireland. 
Was this because of the uplifting effect 
of Celtic Civilization as well as that 
of the Romans?

(April 1974 issue). 
| have long been familiar with the 
book, “Travels among the Great Andes 
of the Equator”, written by the English 
mountaineer Edward Whymper towards 
the end of the 19th century, and recount- 
ing his work in Ecuador in 1879 and 
1880. Whymper had a good deal to 
say about Ecuadorian, antiquities, includ- 
ing dressed rocks found on Corazon, 
and La Condamine's pyramids of Quito, 
but he also had a long chapter on stone 
objects. These included what he called 
“Stars in Stone”, stone implements, 
and household gods. This is in chapter 
XIV of the boci, where he also discusses 
old Indian pottery, musical whistles, and 
vase busts. My edition, published by 
John Murray, London, 1892, contains 
numerous illustrations. 
| think many English readers of the 
“Unesco Courier" may want to get 
“Travels Among the Great Andes" out 
of the library.
