PEOPLE AND PLACES 
The 1960s and 1970s marked the 
beginning of profound changes in 
family structures in the United States. 
As the population became more mobile, 
many parents raised children without sup- 
port from the extended family. Divorce 
rates rose,and so did the numbers of chil- 
dren raised in single-parent households 
and/or by parents working outside the 
home.In the 1970s few mothers of infants 
worked outside the home; now more than 
half do. 
Today a quarter of American families 
with children under age three live in poverty. 
Most of them are headed by one parent, 
usually the mother, and many live in unsafe 
neighbourhoods with poor access to quality 
child care and health services. To help ease

One thousand kids from central LA participate, two-thirds of them 
boys. Fifty-five per cent are African-American, 42 per cent are 
Latino. The Center employs former graffiti artists in a computer 
design and desktop publishing business, and other children work 
distributing flyers, in the computer lab, or at the Center’s store. At 
a homework lab, volunteer mentors and peer tutors help students 
with reading, writing and math skills.

### 115119: Myths and illusions

Myths ana 
Illusions 
In 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall was rightly welcomed because it marked the 
collapse of a system that provided a degree of equality but rejected freedom. Today 
 
   
there is a strong possibility that the system gradually spreading all over the world— 
a kind of neo-liberal fundamentalism—may also collapse.In its obsession with freedom, 
vital though freedom is, this fundamentalism disregards equality, a term which should 
not be regarded here in purely static and statistical terms, but as something dynamic 
and ethical. Equality can only be truly practised in a context of social solidarity or—to 
borrow from the vocabulary of the French Revolution—of fraternity. 
On the one hand, we have a world that is immensely rich in resources, possibilities, know- 
ledge and experience; its constituent societies are freer and more dynamic than ever. T here 
is an extraordinary potential for everyone to live a better life. But at the same time,new 
and ever higher walls are being built both between peoples and between social groups within 
individual countries. We are experiencing a travesty of development, which is creating a 
world bipolarized into extremes of wealth and poverty. 
The most common reactions to this disastrous situation are very often the result of two 
misapprehensions. The first can only be described as ideological or doctrinaire since it is 
not based on the facts as they can be observed.It says that since the dominant system of 
values and things is by definition more than satisfactory, the persistence of impoverishment 
is merely a temporary blip. Enough time has elapsed, however, for us to see that this is not 
the case, including in countries where this system has been part of the established order 
for more than a century. One statistic is particularly eloquent. In just over 30 years, 
world production has approximately doubled, but the gap has more than doubled between 
the income of the 20 per cent of the world’s people living in the richest countries and the 
income of the world’s poorest 20 per cent, according to the United Nations Development 
Programme. 
The second misapprehension stems from another form of blindness and illusion, 
namely the belief that poverty can be regarded exclusively as a moral issue, as if it had no 
other kind of implications for those who are not poor. Globalization is, however, a two-way 
process. It enables the countries of the North to export their values and their paradigms 
as well as their goods and capital to the countries of the South, but it also makes them much 
more vulnerable to the backlash of crises that afflict these countries. Even in the North, 
the cult of competitiveness is undermining situations once considered extremely stable. 
The tide of precarity is rising steadily, so that people who have never been poor no longer 
regard poverty as a distant prospect but as one so close that it could engulf them at any 
moment. 
Because of inadequate socio-economic development, the extraordinary upsurge of demo- 
cracy over the past 30 years remains a very fragile process, and there is a risk that the trend 
may be reversed. When hunger, disease and ignorance prevail,citizens participation in deci- 
sion-making becomes either non-existent or a mere charade. Democratic institutions become 
empty shells, representational bodies existing in form only and devoid of real significance. 
Social divisions caused by economic distortions exacerbate the failures of democracy 
which in turn pose serious threats to civil order within countries and to peace between 
nations. It is high time to face these obvious facts. u

Imagine traveling a thousand years 
I hence in a landscape with rising 
concrete domes, shrouded with mys-

defences of barbed wire and other barriers. 
The ruins are guarded by a priesthood that 
wards off all those who may feel inclined to 
trespass, warning people of the dangers 
that lurk within the centre of their shrine. 
Such may be the future fate of the more 
than 500 civilian nuclear power reactors 
built in the second half of the twentieth 
century. 
In nearly all industries, the disposal of 
antiquated plants and equipment is a 
straightforward and relatively low-cost ope- 
ration. But the high levels of radiation pre- 
sent in retired facilities make it extremely 
complex and costly for nuclear power. Upon 
final closure, a nuclear power plant is 
converted from an asset generating elec- 
tricity that can be sold to energy users, to a 
concrete and steel mass of radioactive waste

### 115120: Nuclear decommissioning: a problem that won't go away

Nuclear 
a problem that 
Critics of current waste disposal and power plant dismantling schemes 
believe that the legacy of nuclear power generation may impoverish and 
endanger future generations for millennia to come 
awaiting eventual dismantling and isola- 
tion from humans and the biosphere. 
Although it 1s unlikely that a scenario such 
as that envisioned above will occur, the fact 
remains that human societies have yet to 
determine just what will happen with retired 
nuclear power plants. 
Francois Chenevier, the director of the 
French nuclear waste agency, admonished in 
the physical structure of retired reactors—will 
remain for thousands of years. 
The problem of what to do with shut- 
tered reactors is growing steadily. As of the 
beginning of 1999, 94 nuclear reactors had 
been retired. At the same time, only 429 
reactors were in operation, meaning that one 
out of every 5.5 reactors that has ever been 
built has already been permanently closed. 
‘It would be irresponsible for us to benefit 
from nuclear power and leave it to later generations 
to deal with the waste’ 
1990 that “it would be irresponsible for us to 
benefit from nuclear power and leave it to 
later generations to deal with the waste.” Yet 
that situation had already occurred, and will 
likely continue into the next three or so 
decades. Although nuclear reactors are 
expected to operate for between 30 and 40 
years, their radioactive legacy—including 
Dismantling: the nuts and bolts 
T basic “ deconstruction” of a nuclear plant takes place in a three-step process, the guidelines of 
which have been established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These phases consist 
of removing the fuel and auxiliary structures;ensuring safe confinement of remaining radioactive struc- 
tures and components;and finally taking the plant apart and removing it from the site. 
The first job is to empty the reactor core of its fuel and to remove it from the site. In the second phase, 
all remaining radioactive materials are confined and sealed; the result is sometimes referred to as “ safe- 
store”. If left in place for 30 to 100 years, slightly contaminated materials such as metals and concrete will 
lose much of their radioactivity. The third phase involves removing all elements from the site and making 
it usable for other purposes. 
Because appropriate national infrastructures do not yet exist in many countries, operators have 
often opted to postpone final dismantling until approved solutions for waste disposal are available. 
Another reason to opt for deferred dismantling is the cost-benefit (see article). In the case of Britain's 
Magnox Electric,for example, which has adopted a 135-year safe-storage strategy, the fact that decom- 
missioning costs are discounted over 135 years lightens the company’s books today. nu 
1 0 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
Yet only a handful of these have actually 
been taken apart. 
This lack of progress in decommissio- 
ning reactors is partly planned. Some coun- 
tries, such as Japan and the United States,have 
announced policies that would have them 
dismantle closed reactors within a decade or 
two of closure. Other countries, such as 
Canada and France, intend to wait several 
decades. At the extreme, the United Kingdom 
has decided to wait more than 100 years 
before finally tearing down any reactors at all. 
Thus, old reactors could become a near per- 
manent fixture in some countries. 
The irony in tearing down nuclear 
power plants is that the longer they run,the 
more radioactive their interiors get from 
neutron bombardment. And the higher the 
radioactivity, the more difficult,dangerous, 
and expensive it 1s to dismantle the plants, 
and store or bury the residual radioactive 
waste. Thus, waiting decades or longer bet- 
ween closing reactors and actually tearing 
them down makes the task that much easier 
and safer to undertake.

Germany, during dismantling. 
Still, the radioactivity of the actual buil- 
dings—particularly the reactor’s core vessel 
in which the nuclear reaction takes place— 
will last for hundreds of thousands of years. 
The radioactive substance nickel 59, for 
example, is found in the reactor’s core, an 
area that has experienced the heavy bom - 
bardment of neutrons from fission’s chain 
reactions. Nickel 59 has a radioactive half- 
life of 80,000 years, meaning that it takes 
roughly a million years before it is safe. 
Current plans are to bury the waste, isola- 
ting it from humans and the biosphere until 
it becomes harmless. However, no country

has yet taken political action on just where 
it will bury these materials. 
Some scientists assure the public that 
the problem of radioactive waste can be 
solved through such burial, although others 
debate whether it can be “solved” in the 
normal fashion at all. Waste cannot be des- 
troyed, nor can scientists prove that it will 
stay out of the biosphere if buried. Proof of 
a hypothesis, via the scientific method, 
requires demonstration. Yet with radioactive 
waste,such proof would require hundreds 
of human generations and entail extensive 
risks. Critics, from aboriginal people to 
scientists, have often noted the presump- 
tuousness of our civilization’s willingness to

doubt should be allowed to exist regarding 
safety.” In 1960, another Academy com- 
mittee urged that the waste issue be resolved 
before licensing new nuclear facilities. 
Such recommendations fell on deaf 
ears, and one country after another plunged 
ahead with building nuclear power plants. 
Government bureaucrats and industry spo- 
kespeople assured the public that decom- 
missioning and nuclear waste could be dealt 
with, yet few resources were dedicated to 
these issues. Working with radioactive waste 
was “not glamorous... nobody got brownie 
points for caring about nuclear waste,” 
according to Carroll Wilson, first general 
manager of the U.S. Atomic Energy Com- 
mission. So the issue was figuratively, and 
almost literally, swept under the rug until the 
late 1970s when safety problems and acci- 
dents, questions about health effects, soaring 
costs, and eroding public confidence slowed 
reactor construction. 
Still, most people probably believe to 
this day that the problem of dismantling 
retired reactors and disposing of their wastes 
is not an issue to be concerned with. That 
may be true, but even if an engineering or 
social solution, such as a nuclear priesthood

Nuclear power today 
Commercial nuclear power has appa- 
I rently reached its zenith—at least for 
the current generation.Globally, capacity of 
nuclear power has increased less than five 
per cent since 1990, and in 1998 the world’s 
capacity actually declined slightly. Even 
though global capacity is likely to rise in the 
next year or two, it will almost certainly 
decline precipitously in the years following 
as the construction pipeline dries up, and 
the closure of older, uneconomic, and poli- 
tically unpopular reactors accelerates. 
By the end of 1998, 429 reactors were 
operating, one less than five years before. 
Construction is taking place at 33 new reac- 
tors. Of these, seven are likely to be 
connected to the grid by the year 2001, 
though another fourteen may never be com- 
pleted. 
Western Europe accounts for 150 ope- 
rating reactors, though only one new one 
remains under construction. In fact, West 
European governments have started addres- 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
sing the closure of existing reactors, as indi- 
cated by the German and Swedish govern- 
ments’efforts to begin phasing out nuclear 
energy. Elsewhere, governments—inclu- 
ding the French—have started debating 
reducing their countries’ dependence on 
the atom. 
In Central and Eastern Europe, as well as 
Russia and Ukraine, some 68 reactors are 
operational, with four being actively worked 
on. Although many of these countries plan to 
expand their nuclear industries, they face 
financial limitations, and public opposition 
in the face of the 1986 Chernobyl accident. 
The Americas account for 123 reac- 
tors, though only two—one each in Argen- 
tina and Brazil—are under construction. 
In Canada and the United States, the 
nuclear industry is under extraordinary 
economic pressure as reactors are unable to 
compete economically with other means 
of providing electricity services. 
Asia remains the last stronghold for the 
nuclear power industry, with 88 reactors 
operating and 26 under construction,though 
even here a slowdown is evident. Japan only 
has two reactors under construction, and 
South Korea has scaled back its intent due to 
the twin blows of political changes and eco- 
nomic crisis. Taiwan is building what is reco- 
gnized by all as the country’s final two reac- 
tors, and efforts to create commercial nuclear 
power industries in countries such as Indo- 
nesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam have all failed 
in recent years. 
China currently has the world’s most 
ambitious programme, with a plan to go 
from the three reactors it operates today to 
more than 50 by the year 2020. It is pro- 
bable,though,that China’s ambitious plans 
will fail as they have in every other country 
when economics, safety, and decommis- 
sioning and radioactive waste issues become 
debated by the public. u

that will protect the biosphere, is found, 
there remains a huge, unpaid bill for achie- 
ving it. 
Despite some early real experience with 
the cost of decommissioning plants, it still 
remains uncertain just what those costs will 
be—and who will pay. Estimates of the dis- 
mantling cost have ranged from 10 per cent 
of the initial capital investment to 40 per 
cent, and even 100 per cent. This trans- 
lates into costs ranging from $50 million to 
more than $3 billion for a large reactor. 
Who’s going to pay, 
and how much? 
In fact, one smaller reactor, the 167- 
megawatt Yankee Rowe of Massachusetts, 
which cost $186 million (1993$) to build in 
1960 ended up having a dismantling bill of 
more than $350 million three decades later. 
Indeed, if governments and utilities have 
had a difficult time justifying the cost of 
building and operating reactors, closing 
them could be an even harder sell. 
In the United Kingdom, the govern- 
ment-owned utility insisted for years that the 
cost of tearing down redundant plants 
would be relatively small. Then, in 1989, 
when the government was in the process of 
a failed attempt to privatize the country’s 
nuclear industry, the utility admitted that 
the decommissioning cost was roughly four 
times that it had previously stated. 
Similarly, though most countries require 
their operators to collect funds for decom- 
missioning during a reactor’s operation, 
most of these funds consist of only “book- 
keeping” funds. That is, the utility credits a 
decommissioning fund with money, but 
the actual cash is spent on other activities. 
Thus, there is no guarantee that when the 
PLANET 
utility actually needs the money for decom- 
missioning, it will have it. Yet even with sys- 
tems that require actual cash reserves to be 
created shortages can easily mount, if reac- 
tors are shut down before the end of their ori- 
ginal expected lifespan, as has been more the 
rule than the exception with the nearly 100 
reactors now permanently closed. 
In fact, the early retirement costs of reac- 
tors in the United States’electricity markets 
could run to more than $15 billion. In recent 
years, Sweden’s government raised the 
amount of money utilities need to collect for 
decommissioning. No one can say for sure just 
how much it will cost to handle the waste 
legacy from nuclear power, though so far the 
estimates continue to climb upward. 
In other countries, including France 
and most developing countries, govern- 
ments intend to provide public funds to 
dismantle reactors when the time comes, 
ensuring that the current generation that 
uses the power from nuclear plants will 
pass on to future generations the cost of dis- 
posing of them. 
In the end, decommissioning could 
become the largest remaining expense facing 
the nuclear industry and the governments 
who have supported it, particularly if efforts 
to confine radioactive waste fail. Even if no 
more nuclear waste is created, dealing with 
existing waste will require attention and 
investments for a period that defies our usual 
notion of time. The challenge before human 
societies is to keep nuclear waste including the 
actual remnants of shuttered plants in isola- 
tion for the many millennia that make up 
the hazardous life of these materials. In this 
light, no matter what becomes of nuclear 
power, the nuclear age will continue for a 
very long time. u

Island nations 
threatened as 
global warming 
Kills coral reefs 
lobal warming is killing coral reefs and posing 
a threat to many of the world’s island nations, 
especially in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. A 
recent study by the U.S-based Global Coral Reef 
Alliance (GCRA) says that last year’s rise in global 
temperature destroyed most of the coral reefs 
surrounding the Seychelles archipelago in the 
Indian Ocean. The colourful reefs which are part 
animal and part plant, protect coastlands from ero- 
sion, provide a home for many marine fish species 
and attract tourism. As havens of biodiversity they 
have been called the rainforests of the ocean. 
“There is no replacement for dead corals,” says Dr 
Thomas Goreau, President of the GCRA, who 
headed the study. 
Coral reefs may also be destroyed by events like 
pollution and hurricanes but such damage is 
minimal compared to that of global warming. 
Scientists say additional heat in the atmos- 
phere, due to an increase in greenhouse gasessuch 
as carbon dioxide, is going into the oceans. When 
the water temperature goes beyond a certain 
point, the corals respond by bleaching themselves 
expelling the algae that give them colour and 
provide nutrition. If the warm condition persists for 
too long, it weakens the coral, sometimes fatally. 
Wide-scale bleaching began to be observed in 
the 1980s but dramatically increased last year, the 
hottest year of the century. Researchers say abnor- 
mally warm conditions persisted in sea water for 
more than five months in 1998, causing extensive 
damage to corals around island nations inclu- 
ding Seychelles, Mauritius, Maldivesand Sri Lanka. 
“Ninety per cent of corals in Seychelles and in 
some islands of Indonesia are already dead. We will 
witness the consequences in the next ten years,” 
says Goreau. The dead coral barriers have not disin- 
tegrated so far, but if and when they do low-lying 
islands in the Indian Ocean region would witness 
severe beach erosion, besides experiencing huge 
lossesin fisheries. [|

### 115121: Chicanos paint their way back

Chicanos 
paint their 
way back 
Jobless young ethnics in several cities 
of the southwest US are finding a purpose in life 
when they get together and paint murals 
from the Mexican border,1995 was a 
record year for crime. Ninety-four of 
its 667,000 inhabitants (29 per cent of 
whom are Hispanic, 3.8 per cent blacks and 
3.5 per cent Indian) were murdered.M ost 
of the victims were members of these mino- 
rities. 
One of them was Pete Valenzuela, an 
unaggressive 15-year-old who didn’t belong 
to a gang. He was gunned down in broad 
daylight while walking in the no-man’s-land 
between two rival “territories”, Barrio Anita 
and Barrio Sovaco. After his funeral, 
hatreds intensified and Pete’s friends swore 
to avenge his death. 
A Chicano mural painter named Julio 
Bernal, and Martin Herndndez, a commu- 
nity organizer, realized it was urgent to 
channel these dangerous emotions. They 
suggested painting a mural to commemo- 
rate the dead teenager and called it Por Vida 
(In Favour of Life). The project attracted 
about 40 young people aged between nine 
and 17, who worked on it together for nine 
months. To raise money to buy materials, 
they washed car windows in the evenings 
and at weekends. 
“Pete was like a brother,” says Gino 
Molina.“I nearly went crazy after he died. 
But mulling over our culture together,dis- 
cussing what people feel about the family or 
religion and trying to express all that on a

thing about art, but I just got on with it.If 
I hadn’t, I would have gone on drinking. I 
used to live in fear and I carried a gun.” 
Today, 19-year-old Gino is father of a 
baby and has just finished another mural 
in memory of Pete which he painted by 
himself on the wall of the local supermar- 
ket. There are now more than 130 such 
murals in and around Tucson. 
In Arizona, Texas, California and New 
Mexico, Chicanos (Mexican immigrants 
and/or their descendants) are sizeable 
minorities which are still growing as a result 
 
of which can lead to serious gang warfare 
stirred up by agents of organized crime. 
Defusing tensions 
Walls in the barrios are often daubed 
with slogans and vicious graffiti reflecting 
this violent world. But more and more 
magnificent frescoes are appearing in this 
urban landscape, reflecting a very old 
Mexican tradition of murals depicting 
scenes from the past or aspects of modern

of immigration.It is hard for them to get a 
foothold in American society and many of 
them live in barrios (Spanish for neighbou- 
rhoods),either in the centre of big cities or 
on their outskirts, away from areas where 
there are jobs. These communities tend to 
be self-contained and generate self-des- 
tructive tensions and conflicts. Young Chi- 
canos face many problems—dropping out 
of school, violent gang rivalry, alcoholism, 
drugdealing and illegal gun possession—all 
life. After Mexico’s 1910 revolution,pain- 
ters such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente 
Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros 
renewed this form of expression and used 
it to record the great social struggles of 
their time. In the 1970s, other artists took 
over where they left off. In the United 
States, artists, sculptors, painters and art 
teachers harnessed their ideals, skills and 
talents to helping young members of their 
ethnic group who had gone astray to find a

For some young descendants of the Yaqui Indians chased out of Mexico at the turn of the century, 
painting is a way of rediscovering their roots and expressing their identity. 
place in American society through art and 
highlighting their shared roots. 
Pedro Flores, who is descended from the 
Yaqui Indians who were chased out of 
Mexico at the beginning of the century, got a 
bad start in life. “I hung out on the streets 
with a gang of friends for years,” he says. “We 
sprayed graffiti on walls, smashed windows 
and raised hell at night, just for the fun of it. 
We all did. In the end, I got into trouble with 
the police because there are drugs everyw- 
here here.” He did his first paintings during 
community events organized by two mural 
artists, Miguel Flores, also of Yaqui stock, 
and Antonio Pazos, a Mexican who has been 
living in Tucson for more than 20 years. 
“Their paintings, inspired by our culture, 
reminded me who I was and where I came 
from. They helped me get a grip on myself. 
Now I couldn’t imagine life without pain- 
ting.” Pedro resumed his studies and finished 
high school. At 18, he is a counsellor in the 
recreation department of the Yaqui tribe’s 
Pascua Reservation (more than 5,000 Yaquis 
live in the Tucson area). He is organizing seve- 
ral painting and mosaic projects for young 
people. On walls and movable panels, they 
have together depicted major aspects of their 
culture, such as the traditional “dance of the 
deer”, which takes place at night and goes on 
until sunrise. Pedro in turn tries to help tee- 
nagers break the vicious circle of violence and 
marginalization they are trapped in. 
“Most families in our neighbourhood are 
alcoholic,” says John Escalante, another 
Yaqui. “The fathers and mothers drink and 
the cousins and uncles sell drugs. We aren’t 
taught about our culture in school. It’s denied 
and buried by white society. If  hadn’t done 
the murals with the other Yaquis, I would 
never have made it, because my father,drow- 
ned in his booze, couldn’t care less.” 
In 1996,Pazos, who is assistant director of 
Tucson’s E1Rio Neighborhood Centre, deci- 
ded to take up a major challenge: making 
peace between two warring groups of jobless 
Chicanos, one Hispanic, the other Yaqui.He 
also wanted to give them a taste for work.He 
decided on repainting the dirty graffiti-cove- 
red wall of a power station which marked the 
frontier between a Yaquineighbourhood (Bar- 
rio Libre) and a Hispanic neighbourhood 
(South Tucson). The electricity company gave 
its permission and even funded the project.

One day, Pazos began painting on the 
wall. A boy soon appeared and asked what 
he was doing. “This is our wall,” he said. 
Pazos replied sharply: “Then it’s about time 
you all got down here. It’s your wall and 
there’s a lot of work to do.” Young people 
poured in from the two neighbourhoods, 
and Pazos, playing up his Mexican roots 
and Yaqui blood, organized them into a 
team to paint pictures of their culture and 
its highlights. Things got dangerously tense 
at one point, though, because the young 
Hispanic Chicanos did not want the cultu- 
ral roots of the Yaqui Chicanos depicted on 
the part of the wall nearest the Hispanic 
Chicano neighbourhood. 
With the help of neighbours, Pazos tra- 
ced the history of the pre-Columbian civi- 
lizations. “I wanted to show them that we're 
all of mixed blood, that half of all Mexicans 
have both Spanish and Indian blood.They 
realized they were mixed too and that this 
should be shown in the mural.So the first 
brightly-coloured communal wall painting 
was born and the rival gangs learned to get 
to know and talk to one another instead of 
killing each other. 
Leaving gangs behind 
The U.S.-Mexican border city of El Paso 
and its 606,000 mostly Hispanic citizens have 
one of the highest jobless rates of any U.S. 
city—nearly 12 per cent compared with the 
national average of 5.4 per cent. One well- 
known mural painter, Carlos Callejo, and an 
art education teacher at Del Valle High 
School, Maria Almeida Natividad, joined 
forces to ferret out new talent, give young 
people from poor families a sense of self- 
esteem and train them in a skill to help them 
find a job. 
‘l wanted to involve my 
students in group-produced 
wall paintings to help them 
discover the history of the 
region and their own history’ 
“I wanted to involve my students in 
group-produced wall paintings to help them 
discover the history of the region and their 
own history,” says Almeida. That chance 
came last year with the 400th anniversary of 
the arrival in El Paso of its first Spanish 
conquistador, Juan de Ofiate. Doing a mural 
around this theme in the high school grounds 
“changed the lives” of several pupils. 
“It opened up my mind and helped me 
get beyond my problems and leave behind 
the gangs in my neighbourhood,” says Misael 
Armenddriz. “I feel prouder of my Mexican »

roots and I express that in what I paint.” 
Misael has already won several small pain- 
ting commissions from the city authorities 
and will soon go to university to study art. 
As aresult of what he has learned while 
organizing the painting, Hernandez has 
rethought the stereotypes he has in his own 
head and those of his community. “We 
decided to include in the mural people who 
suffered at the hands of Ofiate—Indians 
with hands and feet chopped off. History 
sometimes gives its heroes shiny but false 
images. A mural painter has a very big res- 
ponsibility: ordinary folk don’t go to 
museums but they do walk past outdoor 
murals. So we have to paint the truth.” 
Many other experiments are under way 
in El Paso, where more than 150 wall pain- 
tings now brighten up the city. Jesus Alva- 
rado, a social worker in El Segundo, the 
city’s poorest neighbourhood, runs city- 
sponsored graphic art workshops. T he most 
recent murals show the struggle of the 
Indians in Mexico’s Chiapas state. 
These people,along with many others, 
experience a kind of collective therapy 
through the murals—intensive work which 
allows children and teenagers to find fulfil- 
ment within their own culture as dignified 
and respected human beings. u

Walls that speak volumes 
“Many of the people who have done the 
I wall paintings aren’t professional artists 
or decorators. They are children and tee- 
nagers who have started using colour. A 
lot of these unemployed kids had latent 
talents that suddenly gave a voice to the 
walls and the asphalt. It was a kind of pop 
art. Professional painters and decorators 
only joined in much later.” That is how 
Senegal’s Sud-Hebdo magazine summed up 
a remarkable movement called Set setal 
(“clean and make clean” in the Wolof lan- 
guage) that spread among the young people 
of Dakar,the country’s capital. 
Children and teenagers in some of the 
city’s poorest neighbourhoods started cove- 
ring walls with magnificent, colourful 
murals,often with slogans scrawled across 
them.Kids’ stuff? Not exactly. Like graffiti 
artists in the United States, these young 
people were using wall painting to express 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
their need to be heard and recognized. Not 
long before, they had been giving vent to 
their frustrations with what they saw as sick 
urban society—dirty streets in a city where 
garbage was no longer being collected, 
joblessness, drug addiction, prostitution 
and so on—by hurling rocks and insults. But 
now peaceful groups of children and tee- 
nagers were expressing their values, fears 
and hopes in imaginative paintings. They 
also showed their sense of responsibility by 
pitching in to help clean up the city. 
To paint vivid murals you don’t need any 
formal education. Although 80 per cent of 
Haitians can neither read nor write, they 
have a tradition of painting magnificent graf- 
fiti art in the street, on roadside hoardings and 
on just about any surface they can find— 
when the government allows them to. Perhaps 
the grey, dingy walls in all the world’s cities are

Boys in school 
still outnumber 
girls 
&¢ "Fhe most urgent priority isto ensure access 
to education for girls and women,” says 
article 3 of the World Declaration on Education for 
All adopted by 155 countriesin 1990. But a recent 
UNIcer report, The State of the World's Children 
1999, reveals that only the industrial countries 
have achieved parity between girls and boys in pri- 
mary school enrolment. 
The disparity in favour of boys still exists in 
most developing countries. Of the 130 million 
children aged 6 to 11 who are out of school in the 
developing world, 73 million are girls. Gender 
inequality is most blatant in South Asia, where 
there is a 12-point gap between boys’ and girls’ 
school enrolment. Next come North Africa and the 
Middle East (nine points) followed by Sub-Saharan 
Africa (four points). Stuations can vary widely 
within the same region.Afghanistan bans girls 
from going to school, whereas Bangladesh has 
achieved parity and some Arab countries— Jordan, 
Libya and Tunisia— are not far off Latin America 
and the Caribbean are an exception to the rule: 
more girls than boys are enrolled in school. In 
Trinidad and Tobago, UNICEF says, boys think wor- 
king hard in school is not macho enough. 
The advantages of educating girls are obvious 
An educated woman’s children are healthier and 
she ismore likely to see that they go to school. She 
has more control over her fertility, plays a greater 
part in economic life, and stands up more for her 
rights at home and in the community. 
UNICEF says that adopting a series of key mea- 
sures would help reduce the disparity in favour of 
boys. They include recruiting more female tea- 
chers; rooting out gender bias from teaching 
materials;making schools safe for girls, who are 
sometimes victims of sexual harassment; loca- 
ting schools doser to children’s homesin countries 
where it is dangerous for them to walk the roads; 
offering free education to eliminate, among other 
things, the favouritism that benefits boys [|

### 115122: A New deal for the poor

     
Collapsing national economies, natural disasters and political storms have 
dragged millions of people below the poverty line in the 1990s. Meanwhile, in 
many parts of the world, vast proportions of the population have heen living 
in misery for years without any solutions yet in sight. Against such a 
backdrop, a new approach is emerging on ways to fight poverty. No longer 
are open markets, government or the poor seen separately as the key to 
eradicating poverty. Instead, a dominant view these days is that all three 
need to be brought together in a concerted attack. In short, a new deal is 
being offered to help the world’s poor. But is it enough? 
Our dossier looks at the prospects and problems in the three-pronged battle 
against poverty. 
In a west Bucharest public housing estate that 
has seen better days, Liliana tries to prepare a 
casserole for dinner. “But without meat.Meat 
would be a luxury,” says the 41-year-old high school 
teacher, who was once middle class but now counts 
herself amongst Romania’s “new poor”, part of the 
fallout from the collapse of the state in the former 
Eastern bloc. 
Half way around the world, in Jakarta, where 
luxury cars, designer labels and sky-high aspira- 
tions once symbolized an economic boom, a recent 
financial crisis has overnight deflated the economy 
and plunged huge swaths of Indonesian society into 
poverty. In the middle-class Bumi Serpong Damai 
housing complex, for example, children scavenge 
through the garbage looking for used bottles and old 
newspapers, while adults often take to more extreme 
means. “They are easily tempted to steal,” says a 
security guard at the complex. 
Meanwhile, in the fishing village of Cabique 
on the shores of the Caribbean in southeastern 
Haiti, an entire community is sinking steadily deeper

tropical rainstorms break up the earth and sweep 
into the sea tonnes of sole which choke the coral 
where the fish feed. As a result, the fish that once

children,who picks up spare cash working in local 
harvests. 
Elsewhere,many are locked in a vicious circle of 
poverty that has existed for generations and seems 
likely to persist. In the village of Mimetala, 30 kms 
from Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, 80-year-old 
Marie Biloa has been unable to work since a car acci- 
dent 15 years ago. There is no state aid for the 
unemployed, but she did receive a payout from a pri- 
vate insurance company. When her son-in-law stole 
that money and ran off, she was left without a 
means of support. Today Biloa dreams of going 
Poverty is like a disease that has 
gone into remission but later 
strikes back with a vengeance 
back into her former business of selling snacks at a 
street stall, but she lacks the $18 needed as a start- 
up investment. Neither can the rest of her family 
help. Biloa’s daughter has been abandoned by her 
husband.Biloa’s 20-year-old grandson is ill, with a 
sickness that has not yet been diagnosed because the 
family cannot afford to take him to hospital for 
tests. And so Biloa is forced to exist on handouts 
from villagers while a local charity gives her medical 
help free of charge. 
Like a disease that has gone into remission but 
later strikes back with a vengeance,poverty has over 
recent years resurged in places that once seemed to 
be on the mend. As the Romanian, Indonesian and 
Haitian vignettes illustrate, the root causes range 
from a political vacuum left in the wake of formerly 
authoritarian regimes, to the collapse of financial 
markets that once seemed to be the surest remedy for 
poverty, to natural disaster and environmental mis- 
management. The impact of these factors has been 
breathtaking: in the last two years alone, tens of mil- 
lions of persons have been added to the lists of the 
world’s poor in Southeast Asia. In the Former Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe, the number of poor has 
swelled by some 170 million during this decade. 
Meanwhile,as in the case of Biloa, among vast 
stretches of humanity poverty lingers as it has for 
decades without any immediate hope of a cure. 
But how can poverty be alleviated? In the 1980s, 
the so-called “Washington consensus”—an approach 
built around the trickle-down economics of multi- 
lateral lending institutions headquartered in the U.S. 
capital—saw the market as the saviour of the poor. By 
ensuring the efficient functioning of markets, eco- 
nomies would flourish and eventually wealth would 
make its way down to the impoverished. T hat at

The human 
development index 
Traditional economic indicators 
such as per capita gross national 
product, give an incomplete idea 
of the real socio-economic * 
conditions in a country, and to h 
provide a fuller picture the United 
Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) created the human 
development index (HDI) in 1990. 
The HDI takes into account three 
types of data:life expectancy; 
educational attainment (adult 
literacy and combined primary, 
secondary and tertiary 
enrolment); and standard of living 
measured by real purchasing 
power. 
The index is a scale between 
1 (the highest) and 0 (the 
lowest).High human 
development is regarded as 
comprising HDI values of 0.8 and 
above;medium comprising values 
of 0.5 to 0.799;and low 
comprising values below 0.5 
least was the theory. However, markets have proven 
to be fickle friends. 
In our special focus on poverty, Rubens Recu- 
pero, Secretary-General of the UN Conference on 
Trade and Development, looks in greater detail at 
an emerging new consensus on tackling poverty 
(page 20). No one pretends to have all the ans- 
wers, but there does seem to be general agreement 
that a multi-faceted approach is vital: markets, 
governments and poor people themselves need to 
work in concert to find solutions to poverty. 
Our section on the market shows that trade 
and capital flows are still seen as vital ingredients in 
the fight against poverty but are not panaceas.   
‘Human 
Some 1.3 billion people 
live on less than $1 a 
day and alm ost 3 
billion on less than $2 
a day. Almost 11% of 
the inhabitants of the 
industrialized countries 
live on less than $11.4 
dollars a day.”

Indeed, the financial crisis in Southeast Asia (pages 
23 and 24) has demonstrated that faith in eco- 
nomic growth as a way out of poverty has led to 
neglect of safety net-building to help the poor 
during times of trouble. 
Part two of this dossier demonstrates, by looking 
at the United States, the former Soviet bloc and 
Tunisia (pages 24 to 31), under what circumstances 
the state can play a constructive role in the fight on 
poverty, and why in some cases the state has proven 
ineffective in finding solutions. The theme running 
through this section is that the state must play a vital 
part in the war on poverty, knowing when to inter- 
vene and when to stand aside. 
Finally, in recent years analysts, politicians and 
non-government aid organizations have increa- 
singly discovered that poor people may themselves 
possess analytic and other abilities that can be ins- 
trumental in grappling with poverty (pages 32 to 
36). Making use of the skills and cultural attributes 
of the poor is proving to be much more important 
than was imagined a decade ago. But local cultures 
can also be an impediment to improvement. ~~ H

consensus to meet the challenges of globalization, development and poverty.

apparently contradictory words as “optimal” 
and “crisis”. heard the expression for the first 
time from the Director of the Institute for Interna- 
tional Economics, C. Fred Bergsten, in Washington, 
D.C. He explained that it was be-coming increa- 
singly common there, in the sense of the crisis being 
grave enough to force the mighty to finally do some- 
thing without being so serious as to render the 
action useless and too late. 
We may be approaching an optimal point. For even 
the most enthusiastic prophets of the brave new world 
of globalization (for instance, participants in the World 
Economic Forum at Davos) are beginning to question 
the wisdom of their blind beliefs, and to look for a 
human and social dimension to add to their world view. 
One of the advantages of crises is that they can 
play a catalyzing role in changing our perception of 
things. And so, it seems, in the face of crisis we are 
now witnessing growing signs of a new turning point. 
This new current addresses humanity’s future in 
n It may sound paradoxical to join two such terms of globalization,development and poverty, and 
asks a fundamental question: what is the nature and 
sense of the economy?Is it an autonomous and largely 
self-regulating mechanism like the galaxies or the pla- 
netary system, or is it a product of culture and society, 
the result of societal choices based on values? 
Once more the impulse for change is coming not 
so much from academic debate but from reality itself, 
from the huge gaps between the rich and the poor. To 
cite just one example: basic education for all would cost 
$6 billion a year. By comparison, $8 billion are spent 
annually on cosmetics in the United States alone. 
Such grotesque, even obscene, contrasts show 
dramatically that the twin problems of development 
and poverty are still very much with us more than a 
decade after the Washington Consensus claimed to 
have reached “universal convergence” around “the 
common core of wisdom embraced by all serious 
economists”. In broad terms, this approach recom- 
mended that governments should: (i) pursue eco- 
nomic stability in the sense of balancing the budget and

## [Page 21](115117eng.pdf#page=21) 0

### 115123: The Final and optimal crisis of the century

eliminating balance-of-payments deficits; (ii) open 
their economies to the rest of the world through trade 
and financial liberalization; and (iii) promote free 
market capitalism through privatization, deregula- 
tion, and other measures of liberalization. Propagated 
through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
and the World Bank, the Washington Consensus has 
been the dominant paradigm for development from 
the early 1980s until the mid-1990s. Its introduction 
entailed a total shift from earlier thinking, usually 
seen as a shift from state-led dirigisme to market- 
oriented policies. 
Over the last few years,two important challenges 
to the Washington Consensus have emerged: firstly, 
the UNDP’s sustainable human development approach 
and,secondly, an emerging “Southern Consensus”, 
founded on analyses made from the perspective of 
countries undertaking late industrialization and see- 
king to catch up with rich countries in the global 
economy. T his Southern Consensus has not yet been 
sufficiently elaborated to incorporate predominantly 
agricultural economies of Africa and the least deve- 
loped countries. But it can be deduced from the 
increasing convergence between the Latin American 
experience and East Asian development models. 
The overselling of globalization 
The sustainable human development approach 
espouses a set of values different from those under- 
pinning the Washington Consensus. Whereas the 
Washington Consensus focuses on the promotion 
of gross domestic product growth and has been 
implemented through a top-down, donor-condi- 
tionality-driven and outside-expert-led approach, 
the sustainable human development approach 
argues that development should improve the nature 
of people’s lives, and that it should be founded on 
participation and a more equal partnership bet- 
ween developing countries and aid donors. 
Moreover, theWashington Consensus has cracked 
in the practical sense that real differences of opinion 
have emerged in Washington,between the IMF and the 
World Bank, on the causes of the Asian crisis and how 
best to handle it. The Chief Economist of the Bank, 
Joseph Stiglitz, has argued that there is a need for a 
“post-Washington Consensus” to achieve broader 
objectives—higher living standards and equitable, sus- 
tainable and democratic development—using a wider 
range of instruments to correct market failure, to foster 
competition, and to control short-term capital flows. 
It may be too early yet to announce the final 
demise of the Washington Consensus despite Sti- 
glitz’s critique, UNCTAD’s work in favour of a Sou- 
thern Perspective or the renewed emphasis on 
poverty eradication resulting from the 1995 Copen- 
hagen Summit for Social Development. 
The emerging new consensus will be driven by the 
main “workable” alternative, East Asian models, 
strengthened through their convergence with Latin 
America experience, and adapted to Africa and the 
least developed countries. T here are still serious obs- 
tacles facing efforts to develop a more comprehensive 
consensus that would finally be able to overcome

and reconcile the old ideological antinomies: market 
versus state, price stability versus economic growth, 
capital accumulation versus income distribution, 
competition and open integration into the world eco- 
nomy versus national industrialization and consoli- 
dation of a strong local productive capacity. 
There will be a special difficulty in devising 
strategies for long-term development in a world of 
globalized money where speculative attacks and 
financial volatility can unravel and destroy in a 
matter of weeks the economic growth and poverty 
reduction achieved in 30 years, as happened recently 
in Indonesia. In other words, here is where the pro- 
blems of development and poverty coincide with the 
challenge of globalization. 
After the fall of the Berlin Wall almost 10 years 
ago, globalization was oversold to the public as a sure 
way of bringing more accelerated growth and pros- 
perity for all. But the record of economic growth in 
the 1990s has been a dismal one, not only much 
inferior to the exceptional rates of the 30 Glorious 
Years of the post-war period but disappointing even 
in comparison with the troubled 1970s. Still worse, 
we are approaching the year 2000 without a solution 
to the aggravation of the two most serious failures 
of the twentieth century: mass unemployment and 
growing inequality inside and among nations. 
One of the problems with the conventional 
approach to globalization is that it is too narrow. It 
usually reduces and impoverishes a complex phe- 
nomenon to just one of its components, the

economic unification of commercial markets, invest- 
ment opportunities and financial markets on a pla- 
netary scale. In that reductionist way, we miss the rich 
diversity of what actually is an historic process with 
a very strong cultural element. Arising out of the 
breakthroughs in electronics and telecommunica- 
tions which constitute the first scientific revolution to 
change our perceptions of time and space, unlike the 
previous ones that dealt basically with energy and 
matter, globalization represents the unification of 
the planet for human interaction and mutual know- 
ledge. But scientific and technological breakthroughs 
are no guarantees in themselves that the new tech- 
niques will be used not to dominate but to liberate 
and promote human beings. In the past, it was pre- 
cisely the scientific revolution of Galileo and Newton 
which gave the West the technological superiority that 
made colonialism and imperialism possible. 
The situation now is certainly more decisive in 
terms both of promise and threats. Indeed, never 
before has knowled ge become so crucial as to consti- 
tute the very condition for development. As we move 
away from a type of economy where success was 
determined by capital, cheap labour or abundance of

Meeting the basic 
needs of the 
populations of 
developing countries 
(food, drinking 
water, sanitation, 
health care and 
education) would 
cost roughly $40 
billion a year, 
or 4% of the 
combined wealth of 
in the world. 
Yardsticks of poverty 
Ar trend has been to regard poverty asa process of denial of basic opportunities and choices 
for human development, rather than just a shortage of income. The United Nations Deve- 
lopment Programme (UNDP)’s Human Development Report 1997, which was exclusively devoted 
to poverty eradication, stressed the multidimensional nature of poverty and introduced a human 
poverty index (HPI) containing three variables: the percentages of people expected to die before 
age 40,of illiterate adults, and of people without access to health services and safe water and 
of underweight children under five 
The dollar-a-day poverty line is one of the most widely used measures of impoverishment. It 
defines the poor as those whose income is less than a dollar a day per person,an amount cal- 
culated at purchasing power parity (PPP) to be enough to buy a bundle of goods necessary for 
survival. PPP adjusts for differences in local costs in different countries. The standard for the dollar- 
a-day definition is based on 1985 dollars and prices. 
In 1998, UNDP published a report entitled Overcoming Human Poverty, which contained the 
following definitions: 
Human poverty: The lack of essential human capabilities, such as being literate or adequately nou- 
rished. 
Income poverty: The lack of minimally adequate income or expenditures. 
Extreme poverty: Indigence or destitution, usually specified as the inability to satisfy minimum 
food needs. 
Overall poverty: A less severe level of poverty, usually defined as the inability to satisfy essential 
nonfood as well asfood needs. The definition of essential nonfood needs can vary significantly across 
countries. 
Relative poverty: Poverty defined by standardsthat can change across countries or over time. 
An example is a poverty line set at one-half of mean per capita income— implying that the line 
can rise with along with income. 
Absolute poverty: Poverty defined by a fixed standard, one example being the international dollar- 
a-day poverty line. Another example is a poverty line whose real value stays the same over time 
so as to determine changes in poverty in one country. 
The UNDP says that out of 130 countries, 90 have developed operational definitions of extreme 
poverty and 86 have definitions of overall poverty, only a minority of which are solely income-based. 
Almost all the rest combine income with measures of people’s living conditions and quality of life. 
“ This represents an important shift. A decade ago, only a minority of countries had official defini- 
tions of poverty and most of these were based exclusively on income.” [|

the 225 richest people 
resources towards one that is knowledge-intensive, the 
monopoly of information and technology may easily 
become a frightening weapon for domination and 
oppression, the roots of inequality. 
We are beginning to understand the first prin- 
ciples of a new branch of economics, information 
economics. The old presumption was that infor- 
mation had a zero or negligible cost. We now know 
that information has a cost and that this cost of tran- 
saction may be the difference between economic 
success or failure. Without access to information 
there will be no access to markets. T he market solu- 
tion will not always be the optimal solution because 
markets are systems to process and convey infor- 
mation and they are never perfect in performing this 
task.Firms and economic actors, people and govern- 
ments, have to deal with information and some 
will prove more able at it than others. T hose who are 
well educated and who have good access to infor- 
mation and knowledge will prevail in a highly com- 
petitive world. What will happen then to the legions 
of losers in the global competition, unskilled wor- 
kers in rich countries or marginalized countries 
and continents like Africa?To take care of them, we 
will have to redefine the concept of competition as 
a game that not only needs clear rules and an impar- 
tial arbiter, as in the World Trade Organization, but 
also, like all games, requires training, preparation 
and education. In the same way as one has to learn 
how to play a game, nations need to learn how to 
produce, how to trade, how to compete. Govern- 
ments and international organizations must strive 
to make information and knowledge available to all 
in an equal way. 
The return of Adam Smith 
Even if we find how to share information and 
knowledge in such a way as to allow widespread eco- 
nomic development of all or most countries, this will 
not guarantee per se a fair and balanced distribution of 
the results among all categories of citizens. Accelerated 
economic growth is certainly a necessary condition for 
rapid poverty reduction, as was demonstrated in 
China and Asian countries in general. It is not, 
however, a sufficient condition, as we have learned 
from some Latin American examples of extreme 
concentration of wealth and income and from what is 
now happening in many industrialized societies. 
We still do not know enough about how to 
balance growth and distribution, or reward initia- 
tive with relative equality. Development,poverty and 
globalization are problems that will only be solved 
if we go back to the original approach to economics 
as “political economy”, as part of what Adam Smith 
taught: moral philosophy, that is, the economy as a 
product of the “polis”, the city of human beings. Not 
as the planetary system whose laws we cannot 
change, but something that is the result of societal 
choices based on shared values. And the first of all 
values is that the economy was created for man 
and not man for the economy. This is the only way 
to promote genuine hope, and faith that the future 
will be better than the past. u

A fickle friend 
In Asia, financial crisis has thrust millions back into 
impoverishment and shattered faith in the ability of markets 
alone to address the problems of the poor. But can the region 
capitalize on the lessons learned from the crash?

year after she lost her job of 24 years as a tea lady at 
a Jakarta car spare parts manufacturer, which was 
badly hit by a sudden fall-off in demand in the 
wake of the Asian financial crisis that began its 
sweep across the region two years ago.

Meanwhile, rampant inflation has meant 
Hadijah spends far more money than before the 
crisis to buy food and to keep her only daughter in 
school. Prices of basic commodities such as rice, 
sugar, cooking oil and kerosene have increased,in 
local currency terms, three to five times what they 
were before the crisis hit. 
Against a backdrop of awesome economic 
growth in the 1970s, 1980s and early this decade, 
the common wisdom across Southeast Asia used to 
be that the market was the key to eradicating 
poverty. To a large extent that indeed was the case. 
However, the financial crisis has shaken that faith 
and exposed the weakness of the economic trickle- 
down approach to poverty alleviation. 
“The ‘magic of the market’ may work for those 
who have ready access to capital, information and 
skills,” Indonesia’s education and culture minister 
Juwono Sudarsono last August told an international 
seminar on Indonesian reforms, “but not for those who 
lack education, skills and well-placed connections.” 
According to Indonesia’s Central Bureau of 
Statistics, the number of people living below the 
poverty line—those who consume a minimum 
2,100 calories a day—had soared to 95.8 million or 
about 48 per cent of Indonesia’s total population of 
202 million by the end of 1998. 
It is indeed a huge setback. In 1976 Indonesia had 
54.2 million poor people or 40.1 per cent of the whole 
population. But by 1996, after two decades of rapid 
economic growth, the world’s fourth most populous 
country had reduced the number of the poor down to 
22.5 million or 11.3 per cent of the population. 
Economic recovery is vital if the trend is to be 
reversed. However, as aWorld Bank report points out, 
the rapid economic growth of previous years had 
papered over long-standing problems with regard 
to poverty alleviation. Among these are persistent poc- 
kets of poverty and rising inequality, weaknesses in 
labour rights and need for social security nets. 
“A rapid return to macroeconomic stability and 
growth through distributionally favourable adjust- 
ment policies is the only way to begin to put a floor »

under falling incomes of the poor,” says the World 
Bank report. 
In Indonesia, as in many other parts of Asia,hou- 
seholds by and large have few formal mechanisms to 
protect them from poverty resulting from job losses, 
disability or aging.Instead, most rely primarily on per- 
sonal savings and informal family and community 
links. But the financial crisis has cut so deeply that 
those buffers against poverty are proving to be too thin 
for comfort. 
Hadijah, for example, spent 1.5 million rupiah of 
her separation pay to build a small food vending 
stand in front of her house last December. A niece 
contributed 0.5 million rupiah to buy basic com- 
modities. At the end of the month they are able to take 
home a paltry 150,000 rupiah, under $20 at recent 
exchange rates. 
But not everyone has even that frail survival 
mechanism and the result has been the worst social 
tension and violence seen in decades. 
Crime triggered by hunger 
Amid mounting ethnic and religious tension, riots 
and looting have taken place in Indonesian towns 
and villages as demoralized soldiers do nothing but 
look on. One of the worst riots took place in Jakarta 
on 14-16 May 1998 when thousands of looters ran 
amok attacking properties owned by ethnic Chinese, 
whose economic prominence in this country has 
made them a target. More than 1,200 people were 
killed, mostly in burned supermarkets, and many 
Indonesian women of Chinese descent were sexually 
harassed.Even outside of riots, looting has become a 
major problem, with highwaymen along an important 
road linking Jakarta with Surabaya,Indonesia’s second 
most populous city, simply stopping the drivers and 
taking over the trucks loaded with food 
Ironically, the devaluation of Indonesia’s currency 
since the crisis broke, along with rising food prices, has 
caused a huge shift in the internal terms of trade in 
favour of farmers, while palm-oil and cocoa producers 
have benefited from soaring world prices for their 
produce. The World Bank says rural consumption 
has increased 10 per cent over the past year. 
“The driving force behind this crime is hunger. 
The hungry and angry people provide a good place 
for the devil,” said rural sociologist Loekman Soe- 
trisno of Gajah Mada University. 
In response to the crisis, the government has 
sold cheaply or even given away basic commodities 
like rice, sugar and cooking oil. Charity organizations 
have organized cheap lunch boxes for poor workers 
and unemployed people. 
But many analysts say that the effort is not 
enough. 
As recommended by the International Mone- 
tary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Develop- 
ment Bank—Xkey sources of finance to prop up Indo- 
nesia during the crisis—the government in Jakarta has 
set aside about $2.4 billion in funds to carry out a 
social safety net programme for the 1998/1999 fiscal 
year. The programme consists of food subsidies for 
the poor, health services and subsidized medicine, 
2 4 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
financial help for schools and funds for social work to 
boost employment. 
However, implementing the programme, introduced 
early last year, is difficult. According to Marie Muhammad, 
who chairs a programme monitoring team, only about 30 
per cent of funds had been disbursed by the beginning of 
this year due to overcautiousness of government officials in 
parceling out the aid for fear of any graft or other irregu- 
larities. 
Likewise, T hailand, also hard hit by the financial crisis, 
is trying to improve its social security system. Severance pay, 
the key net for the unemployed, last year was extended to 
10 months from six months. The government has also 
launched a program to provide free health care for laid-off 
workers and their families. Aid from multilateral financial 
institutions is being channeled increasingly into training and 
other programmes to help the unemployed. 
Even so, such efforts appear to be far from adequate. 
Southeast Asian countries have been so enfeebled by the 
crisis that now, when social security is most needed, is also 
the most difficult time for governments to raise funds for 
social welfare. So far, safety net programmes have been 
set up as largely short-term measures to deal with the 
effects of the crisis rather than as steps forward to restruc- 
turing socio-economic systems over the long term with a 
view to protecting the poor. 
However, Southeast Asia may at least have made a 
start towards more aggressive attempts to buffer the poor 
against future crises in that there is now at least recognition 
that the market alone is not enough to alleviate poverty.

cent of their gross national product (GNP) to official development assistance (ODA) to the world’s 
most disadvantaged countries. Within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) and at the General Assembly of the United Nations, they committed themselves to 
considerably increasing grants and concessional loans to help beneficiary countries to speed up 
their economic and social development. 
Almost 30 years later this target was only achieved by Denmark,Norway, Sweden and the 
Netherlands, which devoted between 0.7 per cent and 1 per cent of their GNP to ODA.What’s 
more, overall ODA has so far declined that in 1997 it was running at its lowest level for 50 years, 
since the Marshall Plan of 1947. According to aWorld Bank report entitled Assessing Aid— What 
Works, What Doesn’t, and Why, published in November 1998, official development assistance 
flows declined by one-third in real terms between 1991 and 1997. In 1997 ODA totalled no more 
than 0.22% of the GNP of all donor countries, and only 0.08% of the GNP of the United States, 
which held the wooden spoon. Only Canada and Japan increased their ODA in real terms in 1997. 
Aid now only constitutes one quarter of financial flows to developing countries and there are 
big disparities in sources and volumes of development finance in each region. According to OECD, 
in 1997 sub-Saharan Africa received an average of some $27 per capita of aid and $3 per capita 
of foreign direct investment. By contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean received $13 per capita 
of aid and $62 of foreign direct investment. 
The World Bank recommends states to target their ODA to countries that have made big efforts 
to achieve“ sound” management (non-corrupt institutions, respect for the rule of law and economic 
freedoms, open markets, etc.). It estimates that if $10 billion of aid were directed towards these coun- 
tries which are unjustly penalized by the overall decline of ODA, 25 million persons would be rescued 
from poverty. [|

poverty in one of the world’s poorest countries?

### 115125: Mali: growth without development

growth without 
development 
Whose fault is it that economic growth has been accompanied by increasing 
 
In the last few years,M ali’s economic growth rate 
has picked up, but most Malians havent noticed the 
benefits. “It’s growth without jobs, development or 
freedom,” says Aminata D.Traoré, a psychosociologist, 
businesswoman and decorative artist who is Mali’s 
minister of culture and tourism. “Macroeconomic per- 
formance is being achieved at the cost of the basic and 
urgent needs of most of the population,” she says. 
Mali’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on ave- 
rage by five per cent a year between 1994 and 1996, 
and poverty by two per cent a year, according to a 
report by the country’s Observatory for Sustainable 
Human Development and the Struggle against Poverty 
(ODHD) published in July 1998. The new poor, 
Traoré says, “are people who’ve lost their jobs and 
those who’ve never had a job”—people who’ve been 
laid off from state bodies regarded as overstaffed,and 
young people without a job. Most of them gravitate to 
the informal economy, where taxes are not paid and 
figures are unavailable. “Without this sector the situa- 
tion would be explosive,” according to Traoré. 
Today, 72 per cent of of Mali’s 9.2 million popu- 
lation live below the poverty line, i.e. on barely $180 
a year (less than 50 cents a day), according to ODHD. 
The indicators present a grim picture. One third of 
Malians cannot expect to live to the age of 40; almost 
four-fifths are illiterate; over half lack clean water 
supplies; and two-thirds have no access to health ser- 
vices. Half the children under five suffer from chronic 
malnutrition, as against 35 per cent in 1988. The 
only bright spot is a slowdown in the rate at which 
poverty is spreading. Between 1989 and 1994, the 
number of people living below the poverty line rose 
by 11 per cent a year, as against two per cent since. 
  
Traoré believes that theWorld Bank and the Inter- 
national Monetary Fund bear considerable responsi- 
bility for deteriorating living conditions. In a recently 
published book, L’Etau (Actes Sud publishers, Paris, 
1999), she claims for her country the right to shape its 
own destiny. For several years, “decisions have been 
taken without the Malians, and for most of the time 
without their even being aware of the fact, and this is 
bound to jeopardize chances of consolidating the 
democratization process,” she laments. “The needy are 
hardest hit by measures imposed on Africa’s overin- 
debted countries. These measures also discredit the 
state, which is called on to withdraw from such vital sec- 
tors as education, health, water supply and sanitation. 
In short, social welfare has to be privatized so that the 
state can meet its commitments to its creditors.” 
Bad management 
She believes that these reforms aim to consoli- 
date the power of the world’s ruling elite. “T heir pur- 
pose is to create more opportunities for the powerful 
and they extend control of our minds as well as our 
raw materials by the rich countries.” She also 
believes that they undermine state efforts to improve 
the situation of the deprived. At the end of 1994, the 
Malian government decided to focus on sustai- 
nable development and the struggle against poverty, 
drawing up a “national strategy”in 1997. But this 
“laudable option” will fail if the International Mone- 
tary Fund and the World Bank continue to follow the 
same approach, Traoré believes. “Under adjust- 
ment policies the state has very little room for 
manoeuvre. Each dossier—employment, youth, 
women, health, education, the environment— 
requires money that is not locally available. To 
obtain finance from funding bodies means sub- 
mitting to conditions that are supposed to improve 
management and productivity. These conditions 
are actually counter-productive: low wages are a 
disincentive to workers,perpetuate bad management 
and spawn unrest and political instability.” 
Traoré does not deny the responsibility of 
African states in the bankruptcy of their econo- 
mies. “I don’t say there isn’t corruption. ... But I 
plead for the sharing of responsibility. Most of the 
decisions that have been taken in Africa have been 
the result of advice, guidance, and in some cases 
constraint. Now we must be lucid, rigorous, and 
demanding both on ourselves and on those who 
claim to help us.” u

Chile is the only country in Latin America 
where poverty has substantially diminished 
over the past decade. The United Nations Eco- 
nomic Commission for Latin America, based in 
Santiago de Chile, says the trend began in 1987 
under the Pinochet dictatorship, two years before the 
return of democracy. 
In that year, 39 per cent of Chileans lived below 
the poverty line. By 1996, the figure had almost 
halved, to 20 per cent. Chile’s president, Eduardo 
Frei,says two million of his country’s 14.5 million 
people have emerged from poverty since 1990 and 
that the incidence of poverty has fallen by half. 
There seem to be three major reasons for this: 
sustained economic growth, increased social spen- 
ding and the launching of several job-creation pro- 
grammes. All the politicians claim credit for it, of 
course. The right wing, pointing out that poverty 
began to decline towards the end of military rule, 
claims it was largely the result of ultra-liberal eco- 
nomic policies applied since 1978. 
General Augusto Pinochet brought in econo- 
mists from Milton Friedman’s “Chicago school” 
of monetarists and Chile became the first Latin 
American country to rigorously deregulate and pri- 
vatize its economy, open up markets and cut taxes. 
Inflation was tamed, growth began again and 
foreign investors flocked to Chile, which became 
known as “the jaguar of the South” in the late 
1980s. 
The “Chicago Boys” had promised exceptional 
prosperity and an automatic decline in poverty. 
But the ranks of the poor shrank only slowly. And 
as street protests grew with the approach of the

1988 and 1989 elections, the regime came up with 
a raft of social measures. 
President Patricio Aylwin, elected in 1989, and 
his successor, Eduardo Frei, who has been in power 
since 1994, took deliberate steps to reduce poverty and 
counter the negative effects of ultra-liberal policies, 
which had tolerated a high rate of poverty. At the same 
time, growth remained strong—an average of 7 per cent 
a year between 1991 and 1997 until it slowed down last 
year from the effects of the Asian financial crisis. 
In 1996, 71 per cent of all government expen- 
diture went to the social sector and minimum wages 
rose 55 per cent in real terms between 1989 and 
1996, which was faster than labour productivity. 
Business was called upon to share the cost of this

dramatic switch and did not object overmuch to 
paying taxes on their increased profits. However, a 
supertax on the rich would have set off a storm of 
protest,so was out of the question. 
Along with this effort to redistribute wealth as 
part of President Aylwin’s “fair development” pro- 
gramme, steps were taken to encourage new busi- 
nesses. Utilities like electricity, telephones, drin- 
king water and adult education were subsidized. 
Other programmes sent young professionals off to 
the country’s poorest regions to stimulate deve- 
lopment there using local labour. 
The Solidarity and Social Investment Fund 
(FOSIS) has also played a big part and today 
finances more than 18,000 production projects put 
together by rural families, fishermen, representatives 
of Indian peoples and small businesses. T he seven- 
year-old fund also has a budget to train people for 
these projects. 
But there is still a “social debt” which Chile 
has not yet been able to wipe out:the gap between 
the very rich and the very poor. A recent World 
Bank report shows that Chile is one of the world’s 
ten countries where inequalities are most pro- 
nounced.The richest 10 per cent of its population 
have incomes 30 times bigger than the poorest 10 
per cent. This huge gap is Chile’s challenge for the 
future, despite the great progress made so far in 
reducing poverty. u

A new deal for the poor 
  
2. The state 
It is not easy, in the glassy canyons of San Fran- 
cisco’s financial district, to walk a block amid the 
early morning commuters without passing a 
huddled heap—a person without a home—stret- 
ched out on a bed of cardboard. Beggars sitting by 
garbage cans hold out frying pans for change from 
manicured ladies. In the suburbs, a new underclass 
of scavengers wheel stolen shopping carts miles 
through the streets, heaped with the bottles and cans 
they trade in for a pittance at the recycling centre. 
Meanwhile, the Protestant work ethic pervades 
political discourse. Welfare in America, in the shape 
of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, was 
originally intended to benefit widows or women 
with children born out of wedlock—reserved for 
those families that could not depend upon the ear- 
nings of a male householder. Somehow, there is an 
indelible association in the American psyche that 
makes it immoral to live off the state. Where Euro- 
pean national insurance plans espouse universal 


### 115126: USA: the self help gospel

usa: the self-help gospel 
Individualism, an ethic of self-improvement, 
and suspicions of big government help explain a situation in which a rich 
nation tolerates high poverty levels 
More than 100 million 
people in industrial 
countries live below 
the poverty line and 
more than five million 
are hom eless. 
Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of NewYork, may 
have chased the vagrants off the streets of Man- 
hattan, but the reality of poverty for most ordinary 
Americans is all too plain to see.How is it that the 
richest nation in the industrialized world main- 
tains a poverty level that has hovered around 13 per 
cent for a good two decades (and 16.5 per cent in 
1997)? 
Welfare is for those 
who fall by the wayside 
Wealth in the United States accumulates at 
warp speed, but it concentrates. The richest 20 per 
cent of Americans, according to UN Development 
Programme figures,earned 8.9 times more than the 
poorest 20 per cent. Yet the majority of the American 
electorate, as far as one can ascertain, iS not uncom- 
fortable with this equation. Witness President Clin- 
ton’s last State of the Union address, in which he 
boasted of cutting the welfare rolls in half, offered 
little or nothing that might materially improve the 
existence of the poor—and rapidly earned himself 
approval ratings of 76 per cent in the polls. 
One thing is clear. The United States does not 
have a social contract. This “new” nation of hete- 
rogeneous states has never acquired the respect for 
an all-providing, munificent central authority that 
the European nation states inherited from the 
monarchies. Americans are deeply suspicious of 
government, and reluctant to pay for anything that 
might expand its operations. T heir rates of taxation 
remain the lowest of the industrialized nations. The 
principles of utilitarianism,striving for the greatest 
benefit for the greatest number, have never found a 
sympathetic hearing in a society that prides itself on 
its worship of the individual. 
entitlement, welfare is for those who fall by the 
wayside. To be poor in America carries in a certain 
measure the stigma of sin—a failure to realize the full 
potential of being American, which means the 
potential to better one’s condition. 
The fact remains that the American working 
class has only sporadically played a determinative 
role in politics, under the influence of radicals 
imported from Eastern Europe or south of the 
border, or among the relatively settled workforces 
of, for example, the auto industry. Most Ameri- 
cans identify themselves as middle-class, whether 
they own an ancient Ford or a yacht and, always 
hopeful of improving their lot, prefer not to identify 
with those on the lowest rungs of the social ladder. 
To be poor in America carries

One can trace the weakness of American labour 
back to the influence of Southern slave-owners on 
the American polity, pressing for the extension of sla- 
very as new states joined the Union and militating 
against the political organization of labour in the 
industrialized north. And while solidarity in Europe 
was built upon the shared values of a cohesive com- 
munity at the beginning of this century, in the 
United States,the constant pressure of new immi- 
grant groups eager to join the workforce in the land 
of opportunity has kept wages down and workers 
acquiescent.

ponsive first and foremost to the interests of those 
who help pay for their campaigns. T he first order of 
business for any American president is to pave the 
way for the proverbial “healthy business climate”, 
with his Treasury Secretary close by his side. Capital, 
always holding in reserve the threat of a capital 
strike, in the form of a slow-down in wages, or 
retreat and relocation, has managed to limit its 
contribution to social expenditure. 
A healthy 
business climate 
The interests of the disenfranchised count for 
very little in this context except insofar as they sur- 
face as unsightly symptoms of urban blight, sus- 
ceptible to grand invocations of the great spirit of 
American voluntarism, as in President George 
Bush’s “thousand points of light”. 
And, indeed, there is a powerful strain of civic 
responsibility at work in American communities, first 
commented on in the 19th century by the French 
historian Alexis de Tocqueville, which has made it 
possible for government to spin off many of the 
functions it performs in Europe to nonprofit or 
religious organizations, whether in the shape of 
hospitals, soup kitchens or shelters—in a form of 
mixed partnership. This safety net, however,shows 
every sign of being shredded under the recent wel- 
fare reform, as the two-year limit on drawing wel- 
fare benefits comes up and ever more children face 
the prospect of going hungry. 
Few politicians of national stature have made a 
career as advocates for the poor. One is Jerry Brown, 
former governor of California and twice presiden- 
tial candidate, who has spent much of the past 
decade deconstructing the unquestioned assump- 
tions of the American political agenda,such as the 
need to cut welfare and provide jobs. “We need 
more welfare and fewer jobs,” he argued relent- 
lessly on his radio programme “We the People”,

making the point that automation is inexorably 
eating up jobs and that America needs an “income- 
maintenance system” guaranteeing the basic rights 
of food,lodging, education and medical care to all 
its citizens. 
Brown now finds himself back in office as newly 
elected mayor of Oakland,a battered municipality 
across the bay from San Francisco with a large 
black population that the cyber-wealth pouring out 
of Silicon Valley has somehow managed to pass by. 
This is a town so depressed that the supermarkets 
have fled and where many people, too poor to own 
cars, are forced to make a two-hour bus trip simply 
to buy the most basic household necessities. 
But Brown, in the first days of his tenure, has 
turned his attention not to social programmes but 
to police patrols in the desolate downtown area, 
hoping to attract new tenants to the offices in the 
empty skyscrapers. His order of the day: making

of the bills.” 
This joke, which is making the rounds in Tunis, 
sums up the situation well.Officials are doing more 
and more to help society’s most disadvantaged 
members. But much remains to be done to bring 
them into economic life and break with several 
decades of paternalism and assistance. 
If there is a country where the term “welfare state” 
means something it is Tunisia. The government has 
always pursued a vigorous social policy since inde- 
pendence in 1956. At first it was part of President 
Habib Bourguiba’s socialist approach. Today it is a 
pillar of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s law-and- 
order policy, which was bolstered after fundamenta- 
list Muslim s made headway in the late 1980s. “Social 
stability is a matter of security,” says secretary of state 
Kamel Haj Sassi, who manages the FSN. As a result, 
economic liberalization has been accompanied by an 
intensified anti-poverty campaign. 
“From 1987 to 1993, in the middle of the adjust- 
ment period,” the World Bank reports, “the govern- 
ment’s per capita social spending increased by 14 per 
cent in real terms.” The results are plain to see. 
“Despite the shock of liberalization and rising 
unemployment,” says Tunisian economist Azzam 
Mabhjoub, “the poverty rate has declined quite signi- 
ficantly since 1970, although the drop began slowing 
down in 1985,especially in the cities.” The United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says 
that the percentage of people living below the 
poverty line (approximately a dollar per person per 
day in cities and half a dollar in the countryside) fell 
from 22 per cent in 1975 to 6.2 per cent in 1995. 
But the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
also reports that some nine million Tunisians are still 
“vulnerable”. So far, social transfers—equivalent to 
$150 per person per month, according to Mongi 
Layeb of the ministry of economic development— 
seem to have protected them from the worst. 
Tunisia’s neediest people benefit from an arsenal 
of measures. Some 112,000 households receive a 
dollar-a-day allowance from the National Pro- 
gramme of Assistance to Needy Families (PN AFN). 
   
Over 800,000 people have access to medical assis- 
tance; nearly half a million primary-school stu- 
dents receive an allowance every year when they go 
back to school after the summer vacation; and in six 
years the FSN has spent some $350 million on 
developing 928 “twilight zones”. There are also 
housing and rural and urban development pro- 
grammes. T his range of measures wasrounded out 
in late 1997 by the creation of the Tunisian Solida- 
rity Bank (BTS). In 1998 the bank granted low- 
interest loans (5 per cent) to 7,300 small busi- 
nesses. “Now the priority is to stimulate the spirit 
of enterprise,” says bank chairman and CEO Abdel- 
latif Saddem. 
The government is doing a great deal. A little too 
much, some people say, and not always for the best. 
In 1996, a study by the Tunisian research firm

Dirassat reported that the vagueness of public assis- 
tance allocation guidelines has encouraged cro- 
nyism.One-fifth of the PN AFN’s beneficiaries live 
above the poverty line while the poorest families 
swell the waiting lists. According to several accounts, 
civil servants in the ministry of the interior and the 
cells of the ruling party interfere with the selection 
process. 
The war on poverty focuses on the rural areas, but 
two-thirds of Tunisia’s poor live in the cities. In the sub- 
urbs of Tunis for example, Hay Ettadhamen, the lar- 
gest of the country’s 800 squatter settlements, is not 
classified as a “twilight zone” even though 30 per 
cent of the population of the former Islamic funda- 
mentalist stronghold lives below the poverty line. 
An opportunity to team up 
with civil society 
Experts point out a third problem: government 
programmes could do a better job targeting the 
poorest people and urban youth. For example, only 
4.8 per cent of the BT S’s debtors are illiterate—even 
though one in three Tunisians can neither read nor 
write. “Policies to support micro-businesses and 
the informal sector in general will be even more 
necessary in the future,” says Mahjoub. Especially 
since Tunisia has launched a campaign to upgrade 
its industrial fabric in preparation for implementing 
a free-trade accord with the European Union, which 
may lead to higher unemployment and lower wages. 
Urban youth left out of the educational system 
have very few means to improve their lot. Young 
people are deserting the government’s “neighbou- 
rhood houses”, where they find the supervision too 
strict. Delinquency is still a taboo subject, and there- 
fore not dealt with, while illicit alcohol sales, hashish 
dealing, prostitution, illegal immigration rings, theft 
and other petty crime known as beznessis on the rise.

with funding, it is appealing to the generosity of Tuni- 
sians via communication campaigns and collections 
in companies and government offices. Government 
representatives say they also want to involve other 
skills, including those of non-governmental organi- 
zations. But development associations are few and far 
between. “They are unprofessional and don’t always 
get enough encouragement from the authorities,” 
says specialist Henda Gafsi. Many officials want to keep 
control over the population and believe that civil 
society initiatives are targeted against the state. 
In Hay Ettadhamen, the independent NGO 
Enda Interarabe proves them wrong. The group 
runs a bustling centre called Espace 21, which offers 
small loans and a wide range of errands and services. 
In three years the centre has financed over 1,000 micro- 
businesses, most of them small shops. Despite easy credit 
terms, the government has a hard time recovering its loans, 
but Enda, which lends at 17 per cent, has a 98 per cent reim- 
bursement rate. Espace 21 is also a recreational and training 
centre for disadvantaged youth. “Many turn down the 
training programmes we find for them because they prefer 
bezness and easy money,” says director Essma Ben Hamida. 
“But after a few months here,” she explains, “at least they

### 115128: In the former Eastern bloc, a hazardous transition

In the former Eastern bloc, 
a hazardous transition Omar Noman* 
What should the state do in a region where poverty is making a horrific comeback? 
In 1960, the 20% of 
world population 
living in the richest 
countries had 30 tim es 
the income of the 
poorest 20%—by 1995 
their incom e was 
82 times as much.

government virtually wiped out poverty 
through wealth redistribution mechanisms. 
But as the region undergoes political transition, 
the state is no longer up to the task,and poverty is 
making a horrific comeback. Even the former 
middle classes now rank among the impoverished. 
In the vast, ethnically diverse Former Soviet Union 
(FSU) and Eastern Europe, the breakdown of central 
planning and in many cases, the absence of effective 
state institutions to cushion the jolt, have led to the 
most acute poverty and welfare reversals in the world. 
Based on a daily four dollar benchmark—consi- 
dered the minimum required to survive—the 
number of poor increased by over 150 million in 
seven years, a figure greater than the total com- 
bined population of France, the United Kingdom, 
the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Since the 1998 
financial crisis in Russia, the ranks of the poor are 
estimated to have swelled by a further 20 million. 
What’s more, in this decade dollar-a-day poverty has 
made a comeback: in Romania and Bulgaria, five per 
cent of the population lives below that level. 
Eastern bloc transition countries were the only 
ones in the world to have recorded a decline in 
national incomes from the start of the current 
decade up to the present. The declines have been as 
great as 60 per cent in some cases. A region that had 
virtually no inflation under the previous system 
suddenly experienced the most acute price instability 
in the world, with prices rising in excess of 500 per 
cent per year between 1990 and 1995. 
It is also the only region in the world to have wit- 
nessed a decline in men’s life expectancy, which in the 
Russian Federation fell from 64.2 to 57.6 years from 
1989 to 1994, lower than in Egypt, India and Bolivia. 
n In the former Eastern bloc, strong central Morbidity from syphilis, tuberculosis and AID S has 
increased dramatically. And a system that once prided 
itself on having achieved near-universal literacy has suf- 
fered serious reversals. In Central Asian countries, the 
poverty of families has become a major impediment 
to school attendance, and research in several countries 
suggests that there is a continued threat of illiteracy 
emerging amongst certain groups. 
There have been many losers in the transition 
process. 
Wavering between gradualism 
and shock therapy 
Children for one, with a massive erosion of 
child allowances. In the Russian Federation,poverty 
rates among the under-15 group stood at 46 per 
cent, compared to 35 per cent for adults between 31 
and 60 and 22 per cent for pensioners. With the 
decreasing number of child-care facilities, many 
women have been forced to abandon work. 
But what gives poverty in this region a qualita- 
tively different profile from that of most develo- 
ping nations is the slide into precarity of those who 
once made up the professional middle class under 
socialism. Large numbers of once prestigious scien- 
tists,engineers and other highly educated specialists 
employed by public institutions have joined the 
ranks of the poor, with little apparent chance of 
transferring their skills to the market system and 
becoming part of the entrepreneurial class. Once 
supporters of a democratic opening, this frustrated, 
marginalized class is now more likely to be the first 
to stand behind an authoritarian regime. 
This general picture merits tempering. Central

Poland), which were independent at the time of the

breakup of the Former Soviet Union but had extensive 
trade links with it—moved swiftly toward a market- 
based, private-sector dominated economy, with rea- 
sonably competent state institutions. These countries 
still have the lowest levels of inequality in the world. 
Social transfers in the form of pensions, unemployment 
benefits and child allowances increased relative to 
gross domestic product (GDP) or remained constant. 
T he economies of the Baltic States, initially disrupted 
by the loss of energy subsidies from the USSR, regained 
momentum after a relatively short period of hyperin- 
flation and declining output. Again, partly because 
they came into the Soviet fold at a later date, their state 
institutions remained competent and credible. 
This has not been the case in the former Soviet 
Republics. Most of these were unable to reach 
consensus on the course of transition and wavered bet- 
ween gradualism and shock therapy. In the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine, reform has been paralyzed 
over such issues as property rights in agriculture. 
Public institutions, namely the law and order machi- 
nery and the tax revenue services, have collapsed, vir- 
tually destroying the government's ability to redistri- 
bute resources. 
The pendulum has swung too far 
In Russia, taking advantage of a political vacuum, 
the executive rushed through with a series of reforms 
that further undermined credibility in state institu- 
tions, by providing generous underhand deals in the 
privatization process and creating the conditions for 
the mafia’s growth, not unlike the situation in Italy in 
the 19th century. In 1996, the richest 5 per cent of the 
population controlled a share of income equal to 
that of the bottom 60 per cent—and in many coun- 
tries, inequality has surpassed the troubling levels 
found in Latin America. 
From the all-intrusive state, the pendulum has 
swung too far in the opposite direction. Often, the 
ideological inheritance dictated a rush to dismantle 
the state. And yet, as countries of Central Europe go 
to show, the state has a key role to play in the tran- 
sition process. Excessive liberalization leads to

private monopolies, capital flight,unpalatable levels 
of inequality and lack of trust in the market due to 
financial fraud. Strong public institutions are 
required that regulate financial markets and transfer 
resources effectively to vulnerable groups. Last but 
not least,reviving growth is the critical issue. 
Many countries of the FSU were poised for a 
turnaround when the 1998 Russian crisis set them 
back. Still, the outlook is not comprehensively 
bleak.M any countries have defined their economic 
course,have well-educated populations, are inves- 
ting in retraining manpower and moving ahead 
with welfare reforms and institution-building.Not 
including countries of Central Europe and the 
Baltic Republics, there are some exceptional cases. 
Azerbaijan will be an important test: thanks to an 
easily exportable oil surplus, the country is likely to 
benefit from a boost in revenue (even with world oil 
prices as low as they are). But will it share the wealth? 
Many fear that wealth will stay concentrated in the 
hands of a small oligarchy, a nightmarish scenario. 
A second group of countries (Uzbekistan, Kaza- 
khstan, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria and Romania) is 
beginning to post growth and take a more pro-active 
stance towards the future. Many are making strenuous 
efforts to form trade and technology links other than 
with Russia. But for a third group of countries— 
Tajikstan,Georgia (embroiled in an endless conflict), 
Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic and Russia—the most 
highly populated country of the FSU—the pros- 
Excessive liberalization leads to 
private monopolies, capital 
flight, unpalatable levels of 
inequality and lack of trust in the 
market due to financial fraud 
 
pects seem bleak. In Russia, it is conceivable that a 
fairly coherent former Communist party grouping 
acting like a reformist state in China could shore up 
public institutions without losing the momentum 
of reform. In the worst case scenario, the country will 
simply print money, return to hyperinflation, fuel 
social discontent and heighten political conflict. 
Clearly the Russians are aware of the leverage 
they hold on the international stage. They have 
essentially defaulted on debt. Chaos in the region 
is too great a threat to global security to be taken 
mildly, making it highly unlikely that Western powers 
will pull back. On the contrary: the situation is 
likely to engage the United States in the region 
more than it had ever expected to be. 
International agencies have an important role to 
play in strengthening public institutions in many 
new areas and some traditional ones, such as health, 
education and the financial sector. Recognizing that 
the transition process is a much more painful and sys- 
temic process than initially conceived, the Nordic 
countries are reviewing their aid policies towards 
the FSU, while the European Union is set to increase 
its commitment in the months ahead. u

3. The people 
In the hills of western Nepal, a poor dairy 
I farmer may have little more to offer his kids 
than milk to drink. Cut-off from the markets of 
Kathmandu, these farmers must barter and trade 
with middle-men to earn a mere pittance. About two 
years ago, a group of local and international non- 
governmental organizations decided to try and 
widen the farmers’ financial horizons. Together, 
they set up a string of collection points along the 
highway leading to the capital so that farmers could 
drop off their milk daily, with the state dairy cor- 
poration looking after the supplies’ delivery and 
understanding and respect for local culture. However, 
this respect should not divert us from the ultimate 
goal: to reduce poverty. In my experience, local 
culture is more often than not the cause of poverty. 
From The Gambia to Nepal, it is not hard to iden- 
tify cultural practices that limit the potential of 
women, children or ethnic groups. The dominant 
culture is structured to keep certain individuals or 
groups in the service of others. It perpetuates their 
poverty. 
I am not suggesting that the role of the outsider 
is to arrive in a community with a list of “needed

sale. Before long, they ran up against a major road- 
block: the people manning the collection points 
refused to accept the milk of the Dalits—the untou- 
chable caste which is forbidden to handle the water 
or food of upper castes. By not recognizing this 
dictate of the local culture, they had unwittingly set 
up a poverty-eradication project which rejected the 
poorest people. 
What were the alternatives? Accept the local 
culture and try to set up an alternative market for 
the Dalits? Or try to break past the cultural barriers? 
In the end, they broke through with the support of 
human rights activists who streamed in from the 
capital to put pressure on the local authorities. 
I tell this story to highlight a dilemma often 
ignored in discussions concerning poverty-eradi- 
cation: how can we respect local culture without 
accepting the status quo? Local culture has become 
something of a sacred cow for “international deve- 
lopment experts” in the last ten years or so. This 
reaction is understandable given all the wasted 
resources and harm resulting from attempts to 
“import”development projects from one situation 
to another. In short, just because a project “works” 
in one country or region of a country, it will not 
necessarily reap the same success in another. Some 
of the failed plans now appear as pure folly:telling 
African women to stop breast-feeding their babies, 
neglecting to teach children to write in their mother 
tongues and trying to convince farmers to grow 
crops their communities didn’t want to eat. 
A successful project clearly requires a solid 
changes”.Every community, no matter how poor, 
has individuals with very lucid understandings of the 
cultural dynamics at play. These people have plans 
and ideas on how to improve their condition. It is 
the job of the outsider to understand the local 
culture well enough to find these people and offer 
support. 
Gaining access into a community means gaining 
people’s trust—a formidable challenge, particu- 
larly when it comes to the very poor. These people 
are “invisible”. They are never the ones to greet 
you at the village gates but that doesn’t mean they 
aren’t watching. T he challenge of gaining their trust 
becomes twice as difficult if you are seen staying with 
the relatively wealthy or powerful villagers. The 
poor will never trust you if you frequent the homes 
of those considered responsible for their poverty. 
A lot of time 
and a little trust 
Ironically, one of the most telling signs of the 
very poor is their silence. Organize a public meeting 
to discuss the needs of the community and you 
can be certain that those who speak the most need 
your help the least. T he very poor are either shocked 
by the idea that someone is asking them to make 
demands or completely fatalistic about the chances 
of their lives changing. 
Alot of time and a little trust can overcome some 
of this fatalism. I remember working in Sindhu- 
palchowk district of Nepal, where after six months 
of meetings, a man finally felt comfortable to recount

a bit of his past. This very poor farm labourer was 
once relatively wealthy. He traced his problems 
back to the year his father died. According to local 
custom of the Tamang ethnic group, a family must 
spend a tremendous amount on a funeral, with a vil- 
lage feast lasting several days and gifts of clothing 
given to neighbours. This man and his wife sold a 
few animals to cover the costs. The next year, his 
mother died and they sold everything but their 
house to pay for the funeral. 
This man had a plan. With just one female buf- 
falo, he could earn money by breeding the animal 
and selling its milk to buy back his wife’s gold jewel- 
lery which was sold to pay for the last funeral. By 
building on these assets, his son would then be 
able to pay for his parents’ funerals without going 
into debt. In short, his solution to a better life lay in 
preparing for death. 
Seeing through 
a cultural cloud 
This man clearly understood the cause of his 
poverty. He had a sound financial plan for improving 
his condition. But cultural conceptions would 
continue to reinforce his family’s poverty. My role was 
clearly not to tell him to change his religious beliefs. 
But discussions continued and broadened to include 
other villagers and community groups, and before 
long they decided to work with the Lamas, the reli- 
gious leaders, to curtail the influence of local customs. 
This “participatory approach” is not just a way 
A new deal for the poor 
  
of changing a community’s foundations but of buil- 
ding on its “social capital” or solidarity. From Africa 
to Asia, the poorest communities have set up their 
own systems of mutual assistance. Basically, each 
household contributes money or material to a col- 
lective fund. The group then meets regularly to 
give that money to the family most in need. The 
challenge lies in building on this solidarity: to move 
from a safety-net to a means of improving the com- 
munity’s livelihood. The same co-operation can 
build a collective forestry project, a literacy pro- 
gramme Or a new irrigation system. 
For some experts, this solidarity is engrained in 
the “culture of the poor”. would like to think that 
poor people are somehow more caring and 
concerned for others’ well-being. But I don’t. The 
solidarity seems to have stronger links to livelihood 
needs than culture. This may sound like academic 
quibbling over words, but there is a tendency to let 
the warm glow of culture cloud our vision of the true 
causes of poverty. For example, I remember my 
initial contact with a Dalit community in western 
Nepal. I was taken by the strong and intricate bonds 
between these people. But there was no mystery 
involved.Generations of collective marginalization 
forced the community to turn inwards. The chal- 
lenge lay in developing this solidarity so that the

The cultural key 
to empowerment 
Cc" defined in its broadest sense as the totality of a society's distinctive ideas, beliefs, 
values and knowledge, can play an important role in overcoming poverty. 
James Sengendo, a Ugandan sociologist who teaches at Makerere University in Kampala, 
goes even further. “To the extent that people are the ultimate objective of all development 
efforts” he says, “a people’s culture is not only an instrument of development, but also the 
social basis of human development.” In fact, the collective activities that communities have 
always practised in order to survive are based on their own systems of cultural values (see 
article page 35). Since the beginning of the 1990s, development specialists have been insis- 
ting on the need for active participation by the most disadvantaged in projects concerning 
them.According to Robert Chambers of the University of Sussex,UK, many development pro- 
jects have failed because they have tried to impose in widely different local contexts standard 
programmes designed by outsiders There are plenty of examples of programmes implemented 
in places where they turned out to be unnecessary and of projects that were not adapted to 
local needs. 
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report on Overcoming Human 
Poverty stresses that the only real solution is “to empower the poor” and that this will requi- 
re “increased organization and participation of all people in decision-making,and the mobili- 
zing of social energy.”

verb. Sometimes it is necessary to get one’s feet burned. u

When Hurricane Mitch hit Tegucigalpa, the 
A capital of Honduras, in the evening of 28 
October 1998, the first thing Carlos, Mauricio 
and Jaime did was to persuade families in the Nueva 
Suyapa neighbourhood to quit their corrugated 
iron and brick shacks. 
As the rain fell in torrents they took the stricken 
slum-dwellers to improvised shelters in schools and 
churches. Then the three volunteer workers with AT D 
Fourth World, a non-governmental humanitarian 
organization, went back to rescue their street library. 
They collected the children’s books, crayons, sheets of 
paper, scissors and modeling clay displayed on the 
green plastic sheet that for some years they had regu- 
larly been taking to the city’s poorest districts, and 
returned with their precious cargo to the refugee shel- 
ters. Along with some 160,000 other ATD Fourth 
World volunteers and 300 paid staff members in 30 
countries, they have been waging a “war on poverty 
through culture” —at the risk of shocking the very 
poor whose other needs are much more glaring. 
Not by bread 
alone 
Reinforcements soon reached them from neigh- 
bouring Guatemala and from France, where ATD 
Fourth World is based. The newcomers brought pup- 
pets with them as well as shovels to clear the rubble.In 
the end the shovels were hardly used, but the puppets 
worked overtime. While rescue workers gave emergency 
assistance, AT D Fourth World’s “cultural activists” 
helped the hurricane victims keep their spirits up by len- 
ding them books and performing sketches. 
“Everybody, especially society’s poorest members, 
needs culture as much as bread. Not before or after 
bread, but at the same time.” T hat is the basic tenet of 
AT D (Aid in Total Distress), which was founded in 
1957 in a camp for homeless families in the Paris 
hungry 
suburb of Noisy-le-Grand by Father Joseph Wresinski. 
First the priest invited actors to perform Sophocles’ 
Antigone in the muddy, ramshackle settlement. Then 
he laid on an exhibition of original works by Picasso, 
Braque, Miro and Léger. “Culture is a fundamental 
right,” said Father Wresinski, “but the shame the poo- 
rest people have to endure cuts them off from that 
right.” He wanted culture “to cease to be a privilege” 
and to help people outside mainstream society “believe 
in their own culture and in their intelligence.” 
ATD Fourth World began working in Central 
America in 1979. On the edge of Tegucigalpa’s huge 
city dump, needy people of all ages jostle for position 
whenever a garbage truck arrives. They eke out a 
meagre living by scavenging through the rubbish. 
ATD Fourth World volunteer Régis De Muylder has 
not always been given a warm welcome when he has 
turned up with his green plastic sheet. “We don’t 
want your books,” he was often told. “Here we have 
to fight to eat. Our children are dying of hunger.” But 
De Muylder refused to give up, and today adults and 
children stop work when he and other volunteers 
arrive. “Leave them alone,” says veteran garbage 
picker Don Antonio. “They're here to help us, not to 
judge us.” Don Antonio has himself learned how to 
write in order to describe “what he has gone through” 
to his children. He finds it too hard to tell them about 
such grim experiences. 
Street libraries have been set up in 25 countries in 
the North and the South. Their main aim is to encou- 
rage children of school age to enrol in school, or if they 
have dropped out to go back to the classroom. AT D 
Fourth World says that unless people learn how to 
read or write they cannot hope to escape from poverty. 
Volunteers familiarize the most disadvantaged young 
people with a variety of teaching materials in order to 
persuade them that ignorance is not inevitable and that 
they can go to school without feeling ashamed. Parents 
are patiently handled so as to get them used to the idea 
of sending their children to school. 
Another objective is to bring children, teenagers 
and adults together and encourage them to respect 
each other and get on together. “We're not trying to 
entertain the poorest people or organize neigh- 
bourhood events,” says Jean-Marie Anglade, a one- 
time chemical engineer who is now an ATD Fourth 
World staff member. “Our goal is to build self- 
confidence in people who are outside the mains- 
tream and to help them see their strengths,” so that 
they can recover their human dignity, make their 
voices heard and assert their rights. un

### 115131: Madagascar: a waning tradition

Madagascar: d waning tradition 
In the uplands of northern Madagascar, the villagers 
of Ambingivato shaped their community’s future with their own hands. 
But this kind of collective action is fading fast 
Seven million people 
die each year of 
curable diseases and 
800 million have no 
access to health care. 
Madagascar has a long 
tradition of village solidarity. 
- 
Ambingivato, a village with a hundred or so inha- 
L bitants, is five hours’ walk from Ambararata,the 
nearest town accessible by vehicle. For the past 
20 years it hashad a hospital and a school which serve 
four neighbouring villages. T his sounds a bit grand, as 
the hospital is just a couple of big whitewashed rooms, 
one of them a maternity ward and the other for recei- 
ving patients. The school consists of two huts built of 
tanimanga (clay), each with four rooms in which chil- 
dren of different ages and educational levels mix. 
But makeshift though it is, the hospital has meant 
that mothers-to-be no longer have to suffer the ordeal 
of bumping along all the way to Ambararata in a cart 
drawn by two oxen.T he schoolis equally modest but 
it provides an education for the local children. 
Both were built by local farmers themselves follo- 
wing a decision by the fokonolona, a kind of community 
assembly and a political institution dating from pre-colo- 
nial times. Any project initiated by the fokonolona 
becomes a public facility and is respected as such. 
To the Malagasy, the term conjures up a picture 
of solemn meetings at which the community gathers 
to decide its future. One of its regular functions, for 
example, is clearing roads after the heavy December 
and January rains. Each year at this season, Ambin- 
givato is cut off from the other villages by godram- 
potaka, the very thick grey mud that is typical of 
Madagascar’s rural areas, and its people are pre- 
vented from exporting rice and coffee via Ambara- 
rata to Befandriana Avaratra.The menfolk set to 
work with shovels to clear the blocked roads. 
Unaware of new concepts of “community deve- 
lopment” and “local participation” and well before 
Western NGOs arrived in Madagascar, Ambingivato’s

fokonolona was thinking about how to improve local 
conditions without calling on any outside help. To 
build their school and hospital, the villagers divided up 
the work among themselves. T he children went down 
to the Anjingo River to gather rocks, the men broke 
them into small pieces to use as foundation material and 
men and women together hauled earth which was 
mixed with rice straw to make big bricks for the walls. 
To raise funds in an economy where cash is 
little used, the fokonolona held fairs and organized 
hotely—small inns where women served rice, ox 
meat and poultry to the people from surrounding 
villages, who would buy tickets for the occasion in 
advance. At the fairs, where 1970s music was played 
At the fairs, where 1970s music

on old gramophone records, the young and not-so- 
young came to eat,have a good time and spend a bit 
of money. The cash raised went to buy things like the 
hospital’s expensive corrugated iron roof and to 
build one of the school’s two huts. 
The other part of the school still has a that- 
ched roof. Now, after many years, it is time to 
replace it with corrugated iron and mend the mud 
walls weatherbeaten by gale-force winds sweeping 
in from the Indian Ocean every year. 
But the Ambingivato fokonolona is no longer so 
energetic and is less enthusiastic about the school 
than it once was. The fall in coffee prices in the last 20 
years, the death of elders who handed down cus- 
toms, the exodus of young people and the lack of local 
prospects may help to explain why all the Ambingivato 
fokonolona does these days is clear the roads. Times 
have changed. In recent years, many non-govern- 
mental organizations have been busy in Madagascar. 
They bypass the fokonolona, and do everything from 
providing water supplies to refurbishing schools. The 
projects are useful and local people take part in them. 
But the initiative comes from the outside. Instead of 
taking their own decisions and doing the job them- 
selves, people are now content to wait for others to do 
it for them. [|

Thierry Lemaresquier and Mumtaz Keklik* 
The economic crises of the late 1990s hit harder than 
those of ten years ago. How can the world’s poor be sheltered 
from the uncertainties of a globalized economy? 
At the end of the 1980s, when East and 
Southeast Asia were starting to set the pace 
not only for economic performance but also 
for reducing income poverty, a weakened sub- 
Saharan Africa and Latin America were painfully 
emerging from a lost decade. 
A string of disasters in the 1990s—economic 
crisis, debt and political paralysis—wiped out the 
advances these continents had made over the pre- 
ceding 20 years and plunged new sectors of their 
population into poverty. The same kind of striking 
contrasts can be seen in a survey of the 1990s—new 
catastrophes afflicting entire regions and dashing 
hopes of a substantial world-wide reduction of 
poverty at the dawn of the third millennium. 
The crisis that has gripped East Asia since 
1997 has jeopardized at breathtaking speed the 
hard-won economic achievements of the last 30 
years. In the former socialist countries of Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, what is 
politely called a “transition” has, for want of the 
economic, legal and political infrastructure nee- 
ded for the switch to a market economy, led to a 
collapse in real wages and a dizzying rise in inco- 
me disparities. In sub-Saharan Africa, the hopes 
raised by the recent resumption of growth in 
some countries have been cancelled out by the 
AIDS epidemic. 
Do the 1990s already represent a lost decade? 
As we emerged from the 1980s, despite all the 
economic disruptions, improvements in such 
fields as adult literacy, life expectancy and infant 
mortality helped to limit the negative impact of 
loss of income by many people.Unfortunately the 
same cannot really be said of the crises which 
East Asia, the “transition” states of Eastern 
Europe and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa 
are facing today. Why? 
The short-term effects of a recession can be 
cushioned by various macro and micro-econo- 
mic measures, including maintenance of social 
spending and extending society’s safety nets. But 
when the crisis is so violent that it sweeps away 
most of the progress made in the field of human 
development, the situation is quite different. T he 
solutions then call for the use of not just the stan- 
dard economic measures but also for a long-term 
commitment to making social policy more effec- 
tive and reforming the institutions which ultima- 
3 6 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
tely make possible a genuine redistribution of 
income. 
The fight against human poverty needs more 
time than the fight against income poverty alone. 
This disparity is probably even greater in coun- 
tries particularly subject to economic instability 
(East Asia), or where the socio-economic system 
has suffered a major shock (the former Soviet 
Union), or where the human development poten- 
tial is still a long way from being fully achieved 
(sub-Saharan Africa). 
The extraordinary way in which apparently 
entrenched situations can be reversed in the 
struggle against poverty throws sharply into ques- 
The short-term effects of a 
recession can he cushioned by 
various macro and 
micro-economic measures, 
including maintenance of social 
spending and extending society’s 
safety nets 
tion the “sustainability” of the policies followed 
so far and also of those which are going to have to 
be adopted to tackle the long-term human conse- 
quences of crises which can be solved relatively 
quickly in narrowly economic terms. A new chal- 
lenge for the start of the 21st century is how to set 
up mechanisms to guarantee human security in 
the face of the multifarious risks inherent in a glo- 
balized economy. nu

### 115133: Genetic weapons: a 21st-century nightmare?

Genetic weapons: 
a 21st-century 
nightmare? 
The spectre of new biological weapons made possible by the mapping of 
the human genome makes it more urgent than ever to prevent biotechnology 
research from being hijacked for evil purposes 
 
It sounds like science fiction, but like 
many another prediction that was once 
dismissed as far-fetched it may become 
a reality. 
Scientists have warned that recent 
advances in biological research could even- 
tually lead to the creation of a new type of 
biological arsenal capable of targeting a 
specific group of human beings with 
common genetic characteristics, as may be 
the case with certain ethnic groups. 
“It will unfortunately be possible to 
design biological weapons of this type when 
more information on genome research is 
available,” says Dr Vivienne Nathanson, 
head of science and health policy at the 
British Medical Association (BMA), the 
body which represents the medical profes- 
sion in the United Kingdom. 
This terrifying prospect may be an unwel- 
come piece of spin-off from research being 
carried out under the Human Genome Pro- 
ject (see box), an international scientific effort 
to map and sequence the genes in the human 
body and find out more about human DNA 
(deoxyribonucleic acid), the molecule which 
provides the biological instructions to make 
a human being. 
Repairing defective genes 
Late last year, genome research achieved 
a breakthrough when scientists for the first 
time deciphered the full genetic program- 
ming of an animal. The creature was a micro- 
scopic round worm known as Caenorhabditis 
elegans, but because worms and humans have 
turned out to share many genes in common, 
the worm genome is regarded by biologists as 
an essential basis for understanding how the 
human genome works.

### 115133: Genetic weapons: a 21st-century nightmare?

Scientists say a detailed understanding of 
genetic mechanisms of human beings will 
help them to find out the causes of many 
diseases. For example, knowledge of an indi- 
vidual’s genetic make-up will enable doc- 
tors to predict whether or not a specific drug 
will work on a particular patient,allowing the- 
rapies to be more accurately targeted. Simi- 
larly, genetic testing for predisposition to a 
range of illnesses could become feasible, and 
by using what is known as gene therapy doc- 
tors would be able to replace deficient genes 
or repair defective ones. 
However, genome research may turn 
out to have a grim downside. 
It has proved that biologically there are 
more similarities between human beings 
than differences, further dissolving tradi- 
tional prejudices of race and ethnicity. 
However, differences do exist, and if inves- 
tigations provide sufficient data about ethnic 
genetic differences between population 
groups, it may one day be possible to target 
the groups with dangerous micro-organisms. 
One specialist who takes this eventuality 
very seriously is Malcom R. Dando, Pro- 
fessor of Peace Studies at Bradford Uni- 
versity, England. In Biotechnology, Weapons 
and Humanity, a newly published report 
which he wrote for the BM A he examines 
the whole question of how the revolution in 
biotechnology might be used to attack the 
genetic constitution of an ethnic group. 
“The social and ethical safeguards which 
may prevent ethnic conflict and weapons 
development need to be discussed urgently,” 
he said in an interview. Although scientists 
ETHICS 
agree that the technology to produce ethnic 
weapons is not a reality now, some feel there 
is a real chance that it may be developed 
within the next ten years. “No need to wait till 
the project is completed. Efforts to regulate 
genetic research should begin now,” says 
Dando. 
Prof. Dando says the world community is 
already struggling to eliminate existing bio- 
logical weapons. T hese weapons, which carry 
agents spreading deadly diseases like anthrax 
and other lethal toxins, can devastate human 
beings without causing damage to buildings 
‘The social and ethical 
safeguards which may 
prevent ethnic conflict and 
weapons development need 
to be discussed urgently’ 
or infrastructure. Experts say that a few hun- 
dred kilograms of a “weaponized” bacterial 
preparation has the potential to wipe out up 
to three million inhabitants concentrated in a 
city like New York. 
The apartheid regime in South Africa is 
widely believed to have developed forms of 
biological weaponry for use against the black 
population. In the past, however, countries 
have rarely used such biological weapons in 
warfare,partly because of their fear of elimi- 
nating friendly populations and killing their 
own combatants. The new developments in 
genetic research described by Professor 
Dando would remove these limitations. 
Genetic information is already being used 
in some countries to “improve” biological 
weapons,e.g. by equipping them with agents 
to provide increased antibiotic resistance— 
and it is likely that this trend will accelerate as 
the knowledge and understanding of its appli- 
cations become more widely known. 
In the hands of 
terrorists or cult groups 
The problem of the proliferation of bio- 
logical weapon research has been aggravated 
by fall-out from the collapse of the former 
Soviet Union. Most of the nearly 30,000 
scientists who were involved in biological 
research in the USSR during the 1980s are 
now out of a job because of the country’s eco- 
nomic difficulties. Last year, some of them 
disclosed that they had been approached by 
certain countries which have shown parti- 
cular interest in learning about microbes 
that can be used in war to destroy or protect 
crops, as well as genetic engineering tech- 
niques that could be used to make deadly 
germs for which there may be no antidotes. 
Dando argues that scientists in countries 
that belonged to the former Soviet Union 
should be diverted from involvement in pro- 
grammes with sinister motives by schemes 
such as scientist-to-scientist exchanges, joint 
research projects and the conversion to civi- 
lian use of laboratories and institutes once 
associated with the Soviet military effort. 
One prospect that alarms arms control 
experts is that biological weapons will fall 
into the hands of terrorist or cult groups. 
Twelve people were killed and 5,000 injured 
Genome research: hopes and dilemmas 
The Human Genome Project (HGP), 
I which began in 1990, is an international 
15-year $3-billion initiative to trace and iden- 
tify all the 60,000 to 80,000 genes (the human 
genome).International in scope, it has been 
described as the largest scientific research 
effort ever undertaken in the biological 
sciences. It is also seeking to determine the 
complete sequence of 3 billion sub-units of 
human DNA (deoxribonucleic acid), the 
molecule which codes genetic information 
and provides the biological instructions to 
make a human being. At least 18 countries 
have established genome research projects, 
and about 1,000 individuals from 50 coun- 
tries are members of the Human Genome 
Organization (HUGO), which helps to co- 
ordinate international collaboration. 
About 17 per cent of the genes had 
been sequenced by late 1998,and the pro- 
ject is expected to be finished by 2003,the 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
year that marks the 50th anniversary of the 
discovery of the structure of DNA by James 
Watson and Francis Crick. 
Determining the sequence of the DNA 
bases in the entire human DNA will even- 
tually determine where genes are located and 
what instructions are carried in a particular 
section of DNA. This information will be 
used by researchers to understand the func- 
tion of genes and how they cause disease. 
Genome research has already helped scien- 
tists to identify genes associated with dia- 
betes, breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. 
The project also opens up an array of ethical 
dilemmas relating to such questions as genetic 
testing for predisposition to hereditary diseases 
and the possible use of genetic information 
about individuals for commercial purposes 
(e.g. insurance) and the sharing of knowledge 
between rich and poor countries. Another key 
issue is that of the intellectual property of 
researchers, especially since private compa- 
nies have entered the gene-mapping race. 
UNESco has adopted a Universal Decla- 
ration on the Human Genome and Human 
Rights which was endorsed by the United 
Nations on 9 December 1998. Among its sti- 
pulations is the following: “No one shall be 
subjected to discrimination based on genetic 
characteristics that is intended to infringe or 
has the effect of infringing human rights, fun- 
damental freedoms and human dignity” ®

in the Tokyo subway in 1995 in an attack 
launched by the Aum Shinrykyo cult using 
sarin, a lethal nerve gas that produces 
asphyxia.Investigations later revealed that 
the cult group had had no problem in 
recruiting scientists to work on biological 
weapons but could not employ the wea- 
pons due to lack of a proper delivery system. 
Asa first step in coping with the problem 
of potential new biological weapons, arms 
control experts are calling for the bolstering 
of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Conven- 
tion (BTWC), an international treaty signed 
in 1972. The convention prohibits its signa- 
tories from developing, producing, stockpiling 
and acquiring biological weapons. 
Dando points to the fact that though 
142 nations have signed the convention so 
far, this has not deterred countries from 
developing or obtaining knowledge on bio- 
logical weapons. “This is mainly because 
there is no verification system attached to 
the convention,” he says. 
Monitoring the uses 
of genome mapping 
“The threat of new genetic weapons is 
clearly going to be an ongoing problem for 
the international community,” says Michael 
Moodie, President of the U.S.-based Che- 
mical and Biological Arms Control Insti- 
tute. “Such weapons are covered by the cur- 
rent treaty, but this needs to be strengthened 
by an effective verification protocol and fully 
implemented so we can be sure states comply 
with their obligations. A variety of tools 
should be used, including arms control, 
export controls and enhanced intelligence 
capability to monitor countries of concern.” 
The BMA report cited earlier says pro- 
ETHICS 
 
fessional scientists and physicians should 
shoulder their ethical responsibilities and 
take no part in biological and genetic weapon 
projects. It calls for close monitoring of deve- 
lopments in biotechnology worldwide and 
open debate, particularly in relation to the use 
of genome mapping. However, “T hese mea- 
sures can minimize the threats but not eli- 
minate them,” says Nathanson. 
There is also growing concern about the 
misuse of genetic information available on 
Internet. Scientists worldwide share infor- 
mation on new findings in biological research 
through Internet which could be manipu- 
lated by private groups. Nathanson says 
Internet service providers have an ethical 
obligation to ensure information on biological 
weapons is not available on their websites. 
One big problem in monitoring is how 
to distinguish between research carried out 
for good and evil ends. The fact is that 
genetic research which develops specific 
therapeutic agents is scientifically indistin- 
guishable from research to develop a lethal 
or disabling agent targeted at specific clus- 
ters of genes in an ethnic group. This makes 
it all the more necessary to make sure that 
information is used for positive purposes. 
According to Dando, one avenue to be 
explored is to ensure that developing coun- 
tries are given the opportunity to share the 
benefits of the modern revolution in bio- 
technologies which can be used for disease 
control and economic development. In 
return they would be required to promise 
that malign research would not be carried 
out in their laboratories. “This is currently 
being negotiated by countries which are 
party to the BTWC,” he says. nu

Cleaning up 
the net 
A sthe world wires up, police are grappling for 
a solution to a growing problem: the Internet 
is unleashing a frightening wave of child porno- 
graphy. 
Circulation of child porn is growing exponen- 
tially, according to experts at a recent UNESCO 
meeting on the issue. A few years ago, Interpol 
raids on suspected paedophiles turned up a small 
number of videos and magazines, according to 
Agnes Fournier de Saint Maur of Interpol’s Spe- 
dalized Crime Unit. Last year, Operation Cathedral, 
a major international police crackdown on 
cybersmut,led to the arrests of 96 people in 12 
countries, with a half-million images stockpiled in 
U.S computers alone. 
Experts say the feeling of anonymity in down- 
loading images helps netizens weave intricate 
networks to exchange pornographic materials. 
This appears to fuel both demand and supply of 
child porno. 
To aid police crackdowns on these networks, 
governments are tightening legal loopholes. 
However, differences in national laws are pro- 
ving to be an obstacle. In the UK, for example, 
police cannot effectively attack the source of the 
materials because about 95 per cent of them 
comes from abroad. The largest concentration of 
child porn websites is found in Japan, where it is 
not an offence to possess and distribute child 
porn. 
Police are also running into a technological 
barrier: computer encryption codes used to circu- 
late materials secretly. Pressure is building on 
software companies to reveal these codes, while 
Internet service providers are coming under fire for 
not closing dubious websites. Fournier de Saint 
Maur says that if the computer industry doesn’t act 
fast to clamp down on child porn,“ then it may well 
be that the judicial system will do it for them.” 
Threats like this are rattling human rights 
groups. Do we want police setting up guidelines 
to censor the Internet? Human rights groups note 
encryption is not just used by pornographers, but 
also by political dissidents trying to exercise a 
basic right:freedom of expression. [|

In economic terms, illicit trafficking in 
cultural property ranks alongside inter- 
national illicit trading in arms, drugs 
and tobacco. Today, international efforts 
to stop it rely not only on legislation, but also 
on an approach which is by no means uni- 
versally applied—thorough cataloguing. 
Imagine that your car has been stolen 
and that when you go to report the theft you 
can’t remember what model it is. You can’t 
say in what year it was manufactured or 
what its registration number is, and you 
certainly haven’t got a photo of it. Even if 
the police find it within 24 hours, they 
won’t know whose it is, and what’s more 
you’ll have a hard time proving that it was 
yours in the first place. 
This is often the case with works of art 
which have been stolen from museums or 
religious buildings or have been looted or 
traded in questionable circumstances in 
wartime. One day they may be seized by 
customs officials or turn up on the art 
market without their legitimate owners 
being able to prove their case.

### 115134: Tracking down looted art

Tracking down 
Drawing up accurate inventories of art treasures is an essential first step in 
the fight against massive international trafficking 
  
Bas-reliefs from the temple of Banteay Chmar (Cambodia) before and after looting. 
The many organizations that are 
engaged in combating the illicit trade in 
cultural property, including national police 
forces, Interpol (the International Criminal 
Police Organization), the International 
Council of Museums (Icom),the Interna- 
tional Institute for the Unification of Private 
Law (UNIDROIT) and UNESCO, are now 
moving beyond their traditional concern 
with the theft aspect of the problem and 
emphasizing prevention rather than cure. 
They encourage personal and electronic 
surveillance of works of art in places where 
they are exhibited, but this solution is not 
always affordable. T hey also say that taking 
photographs and making detailed invento- 
ries and keeping them in a safe place can be 
amore effective way of tackling the problem 
of theft than might appear at first sight. 
The Getty Information Institute, which 
is part of the Los Angeles-based Getty 
Foundation in the United States,has been 
working for some years on a project to 
develop a new international standard, called 
Object ID, intended to simplify and ratio- 
nalize the description of works of art and 
antiques. T he project, which has UNESCO's 
backing, does not exclude any of the exis- 
ting methods. One great advantage is its 
simplicity—a record is made of each art 
work, giving its measurements (size and 
weight), the material it is made of (such as 
bronze, wood, oil, etc.), the subject, the 
date,the author and other data. 
Interpol regularly publishes details of the 
most wanted works of art. It is currently put- 
ting the finishing touches to a CD-ROM 
and testing an electronic system which will 
enable any of its offices to know within 
minutes whether an object appears on any 
of the lists of stolen art.It will be as simple 
as sending an e-mail to the database at 
Interpol headquarters in Lyons (France) 
and getting back a coded message, which 
may even include a picture of the object 
concerned. 
No country 
is safe 
Meanwhile, the International Council of 
Museums published a “Red List” of African 
art works at the end of 1997, highlighting 
objects that are particularly likely to come 
from illegal or clandestine excavations. For 
Icom’s Valérie Jullien, “This is something 
like a list of endangered animal species. It 
concerns objects from sites in the Niger 
Valley, Chad or Cameroon that are syste- 
matically looted, resulting in the destruction 
of archaeological sites month after month, 
thereby removing any possibility of recons- 
tructing the history of the objects, of the civi- 
lizations from which they came and of the 
people who made them.” The list is intended 
to be open-ended and could therefore be 
applied to endangered objects in other areas 
of the world,adds Jullien. 
All the organizations involved agree that 
illicit trafficking is a scourge from which 
no country is immune. In Africa, there have

looted 
been thefts from the national museums of 
Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Egypt, Cote 
d’Ivoire, Libya, Nigeria and the former 
Zaire, to mention only a few. In Latin Ame- 
rica, indigenous communities such as the 
Coroma of Bolivia are fighting to recover 
ceremonial fabrics (¢’ipis), and any obser- 
vant visitor to Mexico City’s National 
  
These statues from Burkina Faso (above) and 
Nigeria (above right) feature on the “Red List” of 
the International Council of Museums (Icom). 
Anthropological Museum cannot help noti- 
cing the gaps left in some of its display 
cases where objects have disappeared in 
mysterious circumstances. 
Europe and North America have not 
been spared. Camille Corot’s painting Le 
Chemin de Sevres (1885) vanished from the 
Louvre museum in Paris one Sunday in 
May 1998, during peak visiting hours. 
According to Interpol data,in 1997 alone, 
2,476 art works were stolen in Germany, 
2,944 in Russia, 2,244 in the Czech Repu- 
blic and 5,569 in France. In Italy, the police 
reported that over 30,000 art objects were 
    SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
stolen in 1996, which is equivalent to the 
stock of an average-sized museum. 
Besides the economic value represented 
by these objects on the international market, 
the damage caused by the loss of cultural 
heritage sometimes borders on the irrepa- 
rable. 
This was the case with over 100 Khmer 
sculptures discovered by the Thai authori- 
ties on trucks in January 1999.The pieces 
had been taken from the temple of Banteay 
Chmar, built at the end of the 12th century 
in north-western Cambodia by King Jaya- 
varman VII. The bas-reliefs adorning the 
wall around the temple were ripped out in 
several places, leaving a gap over 1 1 metres 
long. According to Professor Claude 
Jacques, who directed an on-site investiga- 
tion, this is a particularly serious case 
because the wall contained palaeographic 
inscriptions which are rarely found in sur- 
viving written documents. In other words, 
this particular theft amounts to the des- 
truction of archives “that end up decorating 
the drawing rooms and gardens of people » 
 
Making honesty the best policy 
Apart from domestic legislation,states, 
al organizations and individuals can make 
use of a whole arsenal of ethical and legal 
remedies to defend their rights in cases of 
illicit trade in cultural property. The most 
recent of these instruments is an interna- 
tional Code of Ethics for Dealers in Cultural 
Property, which UNESCO recommended its 
Member States to adopt in January 1999. 
The novelty of this Code, a kind of hand- 
book of good conduct, resides in the fact that 
it was prepared with the help of the dealers 
themselves, who are urged to check scru- 
pulously the origin of all the works of art in 
which they trade. 
The 1954 Hague Convention on the 
Protection of Cultural Property in the Case 
of Armed Conflict was followed in 1970 by 
the UNEsco Convention on the Means of 
Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, 
Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cul- 
tural Property. This non-retroactive C onven- 
tion has been ratified by 89 countries. 
The UNIDROIT (International Institute 
for the Unification of Private Law) Conven- 
tion on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural 
Objects (1995) is complementary to the 
UNEsco Convention, in the sense that it 
governs matters chiefly related to public law, 
while the latter concentrates on private law. So 
far it is binding on seven countries (Lithuania, 
Paraguay, Romania, Peru,Hungary, China 
and Ecuador). The most significant clause in 
the UNIDROIT Convention is the principle 
whereby anyone in possession of a stolen 
object is always bound to return it, even 
though the object was acquired in good faith. 
Lastly, looting of the historic remains of 
shipwrecks throughout the world has led 
UNEscO to undertake the drafting of a 
Convention on the underwater heritage, a 
particularly sensitive issue in the Scandi- 
navian countries, Australia and the Carib- 
bean. [|

who cannot even decipher them.” 
Recalling that the Angkor site, which 
contains some 1,200 temples spread over an 
area of 300 km 2, is part of the heritage of 
humanity, Cambodian Prince Norodom 
Suhamomi expresses his Government’s 
concern on the issue in these terms: “We 
have a heritage that is disappearing. In some 
places in Cambodia, ten times more sculp- 
tures have been lost in three decades than 
between the eighth century and the 1970s, 
and we now need the help of our colleagues. 
Even though the Cambodian authorities 
are doing all they can to combat this ini- 
quitous situation, their efforts will never 
be sufficient because the demand in Europe 
and the United States is simply enormous.” 
Making up 
for the damage 
Another question that arises for profes- 
sionals is what to do when a stolen work of art 
reappears in an auction or in the back room 
of a none too scrupulous trader. For Valérie 
Jullien, there is no easy answer: “Buying it 
would be unethical, since it would signify 
encouraging this type of trafficking.” Apart 
from the costs of the purchase itself, there 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
could be other related expenses, such as the 
legal costs incurred by governments or indi- 
viduals for court actions to recover their pro- 
perty, or the considerable costs of paying for 
the transfer of art works between places as far 
apart as Italy and Ethiopia. In some cases, 
lawyers’ offices may provide free services or 
private companies may Sponsor returns in 
exchange for publicity, but such contribu- 
tions are marginal and certainly not enough 
to cover all the expenses.

A return to Greece the Parthenon sculp- 
tures widely known as the Elgin Marbles? 
This question has caused rivers of ink to run 
ever since 1982, when Melina Mercouri, 
then minister of culture of Greece, took 
the floor at a UNESCO conference in Mexico 
City and said: “I believe the time has come 
for these marbles to return home to the 
blue skies of Attica,to their rightful place, 
where they form a structural and functional 
part of a unique entity”. 
Athens, which will host the Olympic 
Games in 2004, has renewed its political 
and diplomatic efforts to take advantage 
of this event to repatriate the sculptures 
that Phidias carved to adorn the temple of 
Athena on the Acropolis in the fifth century 
AD. The United Kingdom argues that the 
sculptures were legally purchased in 1816 
from Lord Elgin,who 14 years earlier had 
removed them from Athens with the special 
permission of the Ottoman sultan by whom 
Greece was ruled at the time.

edition of a book by the British expert 
William St. Clair (Lord Elgin and the M arbles,

set the ball rolling again, since its author 
claims to have proof that in 1937 British 
Museum curators caused irreparable damage 
to the surface of the marbles, by scrubbing 
and scraping them in order to return them to 
what they believed to be their original colour, 
namely white, removing forever the honey- 
coloured patina that had adorned them since 
Antiquity. 
Greek archaeologist Yannis T zedakis, 
who has supported the cause of the return 
of the marbles for 40 years,adds that:“We 
are not sure whether the chemical sub- 
stances used in the cleaning remain active”. 
He calls for Greek specialists to be given 
access to the Museum's archives and to the 
actual sculptures. 
Meanwhile, the British Museum is orga- 
nizing a conference of experts later this 
year to assess the state of what it regards as 
its property: 56 of the 97 panels of the Par- 
thenon frieze, 15 of its 64 metopes plus 
other sculptures, which together account for 
half the surviving pieces of the Greek 
temple. The British Museum argues that it 
offers free access to the public, that it opens 
seven days a week and that it receives some 
six and a half million visitors each year. ® 
 
Saving 
Bosnia’s 
heritage 
ow do you look after national heritage in a 
divided country? Since the November 1995 
Dayton Accords on peace in Bosnia and Herze- 
govina, the former Yugoslav republic has been 
divided into two parts— the Croat-Muslim fede 
ration and the Serb republic. But the country’s 
historical monuments and sites are spread over the 
two and are a common heritage. 
A Bosnia-Herzegovina state body, the Bosnian 
Ingtitute for Heritage Protection, has the job of loo- 
king after this heritage, but with scant means at 
its disposal. A country exhausted by war can pro- 
vide very little funding. Internal problems and 
lack of dialogue between the different ethnic 
communities have also held up passage of a law 
governing national heritage by the institutions 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Lack of such legisla- 
tion has badly handicapped the Institute in doing 
its job and in appealing for funds from abroad. 
International organizations can do nothing in 
such a situation. Meanwhile, heritage sites ranging 
from the prehistoric to those of the Austro-Hun- 
garian and Ottoman empires are steadily crum- 
bling away. 
But there are a few glimmers of hope in this 
bleak picture. In November 1998, a UNESCO-spon- 
sored international team began the job of rebuil- 
ding Mostar’s Old Bridge, which had been des- 
troyed in the fighting. The 16th-century bridge a 
symbol of links between ethnic communities, 
should be restored to its former glory by the year 
2001.By then, it may have also have become a 
UNEesco World Heritage site The Institute recently 
proposed that it be placed on the World Heritage 
List,along with part of Sarajevo’s city centre. 
Right now, there are no World Heritage sites in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. But UNEsco’s help would 
be invaluable in the task of saving what remains 
of the country’s historic wealth of culture. u

### 115135: ONE intelligent island

ONE intelligent 
Singapore is bidding to create a ‘wired’ economy 
where services converge on the Internet at an 
unparalleled pace to transform the island’s chief 
resource—a well educated population—into a new 
breed of netizens 
island 
They have been a familiar sight across 
Singapore recently: bronzed Indian 
workmen clad in fluorescent orange SCV 
(Singapore Cable Vision) jackets labouring 
under the scorching sun to lay cable for the 
island state’s suburban neighbourhoods. The 
rush to cable up the island is the result of an 
initiative by the government to transform the 
entire population into netizens, hooked up 
by cable modem to a nationwide broadband 
network, at a speed 100 times faster than cur- 
rent ISDN Internet access. 
While the idea would seem ridiculous in 
a country as large as, say the U.S., Brazil or 
China, wiring Singapore is hardly a daun- 
ting task, given a total land mass of barely 
647.5 square kilometres. Dubbed Singa- 
pore ONE, the national network aims to 
deliver a new level of interactive, multi- 
media applications and services to homes, 
businesses and schools. The authorities 
claim that this effort is the first in the world 
/ 
eS   
  
¢ 
to go “live” and deliver such services to a 
mass user base. 
“Singapore ONE is more than just a 
communication network. It will empower 
Singaporeans to work efficiently in a ‘smart’ 
environment, to facilitate the use and access 
of information to enhance their business, 
personal and family lives,” Prime Minister 
Goh Chok Tong has stated. 
The government considers it crucial for 
a resource-scarce country like Singapore 
to equip itself for the information age. Sin- 
gapore’s push to carve out a place in the 
global digital marketplace is especially signi- 
ficant in the light of the Asian financial 
crisis. While some Asian countries have 
been tightening controls on their markets, 
Singapore is trying to open up the eco- 
nomy further through a variety of initia- 
tives, including ONE. Other Asian countries 
are looking on to see whether Singapore 
ONE may hold important lessons for them 
in their efforts to make the most of the 
information age. 
With a per capita gross domestic product 
of $24,600, Singapore ranks among the 
world’s top 20 richest economies. Singapore 
ONE is therefore not just a social service 
from a government to its people but rather a 
crucial investment in the country’s only 
resource: its people. The government decision 
to commit $240 million for ONE infra- 
structure development reflects a commit- 
ment to upgrade the skills and knowledge of 
its well-educated population. 
Services on offer range from banking, 
shopping, theatre ticket booking, and pro- 
perty viewing to distance learning. The 
various virtual colleges and scholastic pro- 
grammes offer everything from engineering 
courses to interactive multimedia courses 
for school-kids. Entertainment, like a favou- 
rite TV programme or video, is provided on 
demand. A chat on the phone with a friend 
is replaced by a virtual video conference. 
Instead of worrying about what the kids are 
doing at home, parents can keep an eye on 
them thanks to video-conferencing, with a 
web-camera sending images from home to 
the personal office computer. 
40,000 users 
Users of cable modems are charged a 
subsidized flat rate of about $21 a month and 
users of SingTel’s ADSL lines enjoy a similar 
rate. The network began a one-year pilot 
phase in June 1997 and was commercially 
launched the following year. Only about 
15,000 households have bought the pac- 
kage.However, the low subscription rates are 
offset by the growing number of users,accor- 
ding to officials at the National Computer 
Board (NCB), the main government body 
behind the project. “If you include users at 
schools, tertiary institutions, community 
centres and libraries, we have a conservative 
estimate of at least 40,000 users,” said Ng 
Kin Yee, assistant director for programme 
management and new media.

Ng says it is normal for new infrastruc- 
ture products to experience a modest initial 
uptake. “Singapore ONE is not just about 
infrastructure, it’s all about building the skills, 
the people awareness among senior citizens, 
children and their parents who might have 
had a phobia for computers,” he says. 
The government began laying the ground- 
work to create an I'T-literate population for 
Singapore ONE in the 1980s. Today more 
than 40 per cent of Singapore households 
own a computer and more than 350,000 out 
of a population of 3 million subscribe to the 
Internet. In fact, Singapore has been reco- 
gnized as the second most ['T-literate country 
in the world after the United States by the 
World Competitiveness Report, which is 
published annually by the Institute for Mana- 
gement Development (IMD) in Switzerland. 
E-commerce on ONE 
Singapore’s electronic-commerce—or 
e-commerce, short for buying and selling 
over the Internet—infrastructure is equally 
advanced. Online purchases can be paid 
through cashcards or security credit card 
payment systems and banks use digital cer- 
tificates and smart cards to offer secure 
online banking. Comprehensive legislation 
1s also being considered to provide an elec- 
tronic transaction legal framework to encou- 
rage more online commerce. 
“E-business is not just about E-com- 
merce,” said Howie Lau, manager for e-busi- 
ness solutions at Hewlett Packard Singapore. 
“E-business opens up tremendous opportu- 
nities for companies to further relationships 
with customers, partners and employees by 
linking internal business processes to the 
  
CONNEXIONS

Internet. Singapore ONE could potentially be 
valuable for scenarios where large amounts of 
information or speed of transmission are fac- 
tors such as the exchange of business docu- 
ments with partners; sharing of common 
information within a community (e.g. real 
estate agents sharing a common database of 
property); realtime synchronization of multi- 
media; mobile employees gaining access to 
corporate file servers,databases. The scena- 
rios are pretty well endless.” 
Already, SingTel has launched a separate 
ATM network specifically targeted at busi- 
ness-to-business transactions to complement 
Singapore ONE. The focus of Singapore 
ONE’s network is to connect consumers to 
businesses and government. Meanwhile, Sing- 
Tel’s AT M network connects businesses, aca- 
demic institutions and government. Sing- 
Tel’s ATM network will have connexions to 
Singapore ONE and will provide it with high

hutan, the little-known kingdom of 630,000 people nestled in the folds of the eastern Himalayan 
Mountains, has taken another step out of self-imposed isolation: the country now appears on the 
Web. Through a site recently created by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),one quickly discovers 
that Bhutan is not a fossilized and romanticized Shangri-La.In fact,the development experience of Bhu- 
tan isunusual because, since it started opening up to the ouside world in 1961, it embarked upon what the 
World Bank, for one, calls a far-reaching development strategy, and has made substantial progress in 
improving living standards 
The government’s growth objectives, however, are tempered by an earnest desire to preserve the coun- 
try’ sdistinctive cultural heritage and its rich natural resources base. Bhutan has been well ahead of the rest 
of the world in its commitment to environmental protection:for example, forest cover has increased from 
60 to over 70 per cent in the past twenty years. 
Bhutan joined the U.N. in 1971 and UNICEF's involvement began three years later when it started its first 
water supply programme. Since then, UNICEF has been involved in health,education, water and sanitation 
projects The website, animated with photographs, music and videos, provides us with a glimpse of the coun- 
try and its people in their everyday village lives: a health worker, a teacher, a Buddhist monk, and many others

speed international links. Since its launch in 
June last year, SingTel’s ATM network has 
established links to Australia, Hong Kong, 
Japan and the U.S. There are plans for SingTel 
to be extended to Europe and other major 
Asia Pacific destinations this year. 
While some analysts anticipate that busi- 
ness-to-business transactions will take over 
from the original consumer-based plan for 
Singapore ONE,NCB’s Ng says that both 
sectors can grow in tandem. “One sector 
need not necessarily exclude the other,” he 
insists. Currently, the 200 service provi- 
ders to Singapore ONE include major 
supermarkets, fashion and retail outlets, 
banks, insurance companies and books- 
tores. 
Retailers thinking globally 
“Interactive multimedia offers infinite 
possibilities for retail,” says Bernard Yang, 
manager of Nanyang Optical, one of Sin - 
gapore’s major optical chains which has a 
site on Singapore One.“Imagine a person 
watching aT CS (Television Corporation of 
Singapore) drama. The viewer likes the 
frame worn by Zoe Tay (popular Singapore 
actress), with a click of a button, up pops the 
Focal Point (Nanyang Optical on Singa- 
pore ONE) and he or she can buy and have 
the same pair delivered to their doorstep.” 
“Selling via the Net also means I do 
not have to put up with exorbitant rentals 
and expensive manpower. All I need is a 
good web designer and a system adminis- 
trator plus leased line charges. If I can make 
the same sales on the Net that I do in my 
shops,then I'd be a really happy guy!” 
Most retailers, like Nanyang, have a pre- 
sence on the Internet as well as on Singapore 
ONE. Predictably, sales are higher on the 
Internet than on ONE, simply because of 
higher user rates. Yang, however, sees it as 
vital to establish a name for himselfon ONE, 
which he anticipates will be the main platform

for e-shopping in Singapore in the future. 
Consultants say that Singapore retai- 
lers on the Net should already be thinking 
globally. “Some of the most successful e- 
commerce websites, like Amazon.com,do 
business with the whole world. So if 
someone has a good idea that can be sold to 
anyone in the world, Singapore may be just 
as good as any other place to start,” said IT 
consultant Jeroen Domensino. “There 
appears to be too much concern here right 
now over technicalities such as security 
issues. T he truth is that elsewhere people are 
already making big money via the Net, 
regardless whether security issues (credit 
card fraud, for example) are completely 
resolved. In the end, I think that consu- 
mers all over the world are changing their 
attitude towards what’s safe” 
Choosing between 
the virtual and the real 
Along with the growth in e-commerce, 
multimedia software companies are expe- 
riencing exponential demand. “Think of it as 
Hollywood. If Hollywood made movies only 
for the U.S., it would be a limited market. We 
want to be the Hollywood of multimedia,” 
said Michael Yap, NCB’s assistant chief exe- 
cutive. Software developers hope that via 
international links, they will gain publicity 
and future markets for their work. “But we 
will have to move fast,” says Ng. “It’s a fast 
growing, fast changing environment.” 
And in a small way, even local TV pro- 
ducers are anticipating demand in other 
markets for Singapore programmes. “There 
is much potential to export our culture to 
CONNEXIONS 
other countries,” says James Leong of TCS 
Multimedia. “We would definitely like to 
push our content over the Internet as TCS 
has done for television (Singapore-pro- 
duced TV series have been broadcast in 
Australia and Taiwan.)” Currently about 
half of Singapore ONE subscribers sub- 
scribe to TCS’ 1-on-One service which 
offers made-in-Singapore TV sitcoms, 
dramas,news and documentaries. 
While software whizzkids and plucky 
entrepreneurs in this little city state gear up 
to make their name in cyberspace, there 
remains a fair amount of scepticism as to 
whether ONE will ever be areal hit at home. 
A video conference chat either with the 
bosses or with good friends is unlikely to 
gain popularity over coffee or kopi-O (locally 
brewed black coffee) at the neighbourhood 
outdoor food-stall. 
Likewise video-on-demand viewed from 
a 14-inch desktop monitor is likely to be a 
much less attractive option to the average 
Singaporean compared with watching the 
latest laser discs or Video CDs on the fami- 
ly’s 31-inch stereo TV (the pride and joy of 
most Singapore households). And in this 
metropolis overbuilt with malls, real shopping 
as opposed to virtual, will likely remain the 
most popular pastime, regardless of how 
interactive and alluring a web-mall might be. 
There will definitely be choices and 
options for consumers and entrepreneurs. 
Some will choose the virtual and some will 
choose the real. The authorities only hope 
that they will have equipped the population 
with the IT literacy to at least exercise that 
option in the next millennium. u 
The Web lifestyle 
Leading the “web lifestyle” of billionaire 
I Bill Gates should be a reality for the ave- 
rage Singaporean in four or five years accor- 
ding to the Microsoft founder. Visiting the 
island in 1998, Gates predicted that this 
would become a reality in Singapore even 
faster than in the U.S., thanks to the Sin- 
gapore ONE initiative. 
Already, dreamers at the National Com- 
puter Board have created a mock cyber- 
flat.Picture this: Hassan,the eldest son, is 
lounging on his bed enjoying a romantic 
video-conference chat with his girlfriend 
in Australia. He suddenly remembers he 
has forgotten her birthday; a few clicks of the 
mouse and he has ordered flowers to be 
delivered to her within the hour. Meanwhile 
Mum is in the kitchen simultaneously 
cooking dinner and attending a corporate 
planning video conference meeting with 
her boss and colleagues in the US. 
Halfway through the meeting, she 
remembers a few ingredients she’s forgot- 
ten to buy. She clicks a couple of times on 
a mouse (while listening with apparent 
concentration to her colleague’s business 
plan) and the groceries will be at her doors- 
tep in a couple of hours. Meanwhile,baby 
1s visible, sleeping peacefully on the “live” 
baby monitor screen and toddlers Noraini 
and Nordin are shown on yet another 
screen watching Discovery Channel inter- 
actively, downloading everything they ever 
wanted to know about elephants. Dad is in 
the living room folding the laundry while 
buying and selling shares via the Net. A split 
screen enables him to communicate with 
his office staff at the same time. Dream it 
might be for now, but the cyberflat inhabi- 
ted by super-efficient netizens may well be, 
according to Gates, a reality in the near 
future. nu 
 
With distributed 
computing, there's 
strength in 
numbers 
Q prose you have to crack a really hefty com- 
puter problem— in technical jargon,say you 
want to decode a computer message written in the 
“56-bit encryption” common these days. In theory 
it’s very simple: you try all possible solutions until 
you find the right one. But there's a problem:the 
total number of possible solutions is two multiplied 
56 times by itself— a number which would fill 
almost a whole line of this column. 
There are two ways to deal with this. Either you 
happen to have the great privilege of using one of 
the world’s super-computers, in which case the pro- 
blem will be solved very quickly, or else you resort 
to the old idea that strength lies in numbers 
Several websites are tackling it the second way, 
among them http://www .distributed.net,by dra- 
wing on the dormant capacity of the perfectly 
ordinary computers of some 22,000 voluntary 
participants. Like all computer buffs, these volun- 
teers do not use their machines at full capacity or 
all the time. Any programme they use—e.g. a 
word-processing programme— occupies only part 
of the machine’s capacity. And like all enthusiasts, 
they sometimes feel like phoning a friend or stop- 
ping for a cup of coffee. Some of them even leave 
their computers switched on when they're not 
using them. 
What these volunteers do is install in their 
machine a small free programme which, when 
they connect to a central “ server” by a modem, 
tells the server how much capacity is available in 
the machine. The machine then downloads the ele- 
ments needed to process a tiny part of the gigantic 
calculating operation. 
“Distributed.net” ,which at first took 40 days 
to crack the code, managed it in less than a day by 
this method. Others, including the University of 
California at Berkeley, the radio-telescope at Are- 
cibo, in Puerto Rico, and an American UFO club are 
planning to call on 110,000 computer enthu- 
siasts around the world to help analyse radio 
signals received from outer space in the hope of 
detecting signs of extra-terrestrial life. But this 
method of “ distributed computing” can also per- 
form more urgent tasks u

TALKING TO... 


### 115136: Ahmadou Kourouma: an African novelist's inside story

Ahmadou Kourouma 
an African novelist’s 
Inside story 
Ahmadou Kourouma is a writer from Cote d’lvoire whose relatively slender 
but highly original output—three novels published over 28 years—draws up 
an eloquent indictment of the injustices imposed on black Africa 
Your first novel, The Suns of Independence, 
published in 1970, has won acclaim as a 
masterpiece and has sold 100,000 copies. 
But you had a hard time finding a publisher 
for it. Why? 
The book was rejected for two reasons. 
First, my style had a certain originality 
stemming from the particular way in which 
I used the French language. Some readers 
found this disconcerting. Second, many 
people disliked the conception of the 
novel. I had structured it in the kind of way 
used by the American writer John Dos 
Passos earlier this century. I ended the fic- 
tional part of the book with a section I 
would describe as documentary. After tel- 
ling the story of the protagonist, Fama, 1 
described situations and events that took 
place in Cbte d’Ivoire at the time of the 
Cold War. I talked about things that might 
be called sensitive. Some African publi- 
shers even sent the manuscript back to me 
with scathing, almost insulting comments. 
How did you come to master what was for 
you a foreign language— French? 
I had no choice in the matter. I didn’t 
know how to express myself in any other 
language. My English was poor, and 1 
have never learned Arabic. In school I was 
only taught French and, like everyone 
who went to school before decoloniza- 
tion,I wasn’t allowed to speak our mother 
tongue, Malinkel. So I had to use French 
to describe Malinke people and tell sto- 
ries of Malinke life.Some people have cri- 
ticized me for “bashing” the French lan- 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - March 1999 
guage and giving it a Malinke twist. 
It has even been said that you have “cuc- 
kolded” French. 
Whatever people might say, I am not 
trying to change French.What I'm inter- 
ested in is reproducing to the fullest pos- 
sible extent the way my characters live 
and think. My characters are Malinke. 
And when the Malinke speak, they follow 
their own logic, their own way of looking 
at the world. That approach doesn’t go 
into French. The sequence of words and 
ideas in Malinke is different from what it 
is in French. There is a big gap between 
what I describe and the form in which I 
express myself, a gap much bigger than 
the gap when an Italian speaks French, 
for example. I repeat, my objective is not 
formal or linguistic. What I’m interested 
in is reality. My characters must be cre- 
dible and to be credible they must speak 
in the novel as they speak in their own 
language. 
How would you describe the Malinke lan- 
guage? 
 
1. The Malinke are the largest of the groups 
composing the Mande ethnic group. Most of them 
live in Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire, 
where they make up 11 per cent of the population. 
Converted to Islam in the 11th century, the 
Malinke have ruled powerful empires which they 
dominated by force of numbers,arms and 
economic power. They are reputed to have a good 
head for business, and are also known as Dioulas, a 
word meaning “merchants” in Malinke. 
Some people may disagree, but it seems 
to me that African languages are on the 
whole far richer than European lan- 
guages. They have a wide range of words 
to denote one and the same thing and a 
multitude of expressions to describe one 
and the same feeling, as well as many 
mechanisms for creating neologisms. 
Malinke alone has around ten of these. 
African languages are rich in proverbs 
and sayings which people constantly refer 
to. So it’s not surprising that sometimes 
we get bogged down when we use French 
to describe our lives and our psychologi- 
cal universe. The French language, on the 
other hand, is the product of a Catholic, 
rationalist civilization. That’s obvious 
from its structure, its way of analysing 
and describing reality. Our language is 
influenced by fetishist spirituality and is 
closer to nature. 
Western authors often speak 
of writing as a physical,vital, 
organic need. For you, it is more a way 
of getting a hearing. 
For us African writers, writing is also a 
matter of survival. When I wrote The Suns 
of Independence, 1 wanted to campaign 
against abuses of social and economic 
power. That was a vital and absolute 
necessity! All contemporary French and 
other European writers have devoted 
some of their work to the four years of 
occupation and oppression that their 
countries endured during the second 
world war. But in Africa we had 100 years

predicament. It kept a millstone around

orders and pulled the strings, picked the 
dictators that suited them and sent in 
their military whenever there was any 
resistance.

suffering 1s also the subject of the novel I 
recently finished.Its title is En attendant le 
vote des bétes sauvages (“Waiting for the 
wild animals to vote”), and it’s based on 
the tragedy of the Cold War in Africa. 
The sufferings you describe are intense and 
extreme. But in this novel you express gra- 
titude to a dictator for his “courage” in tel- 
ling his compatriots that they were “thie- 
ving, lazy savages.” 
That remark does not refer to the people 
“down below” ,as we say, but to those “on 
top”, the dictators’ buddies. Resignation 
was the only option for the people down 
below, whom I describe as “coarsened by 
their beliefs and their poverty, patient and 
dumb”.The Cold War prevented African 
countries from finding a way out of their 
But it was the most brutal, ignorant leaders 
who won the internal power struggles in 
African countries. 
Yes, and they also had to be cynical. The 
foreign powers needed them. Apart from 
a few exceptions, they didn’t want bright 
people. Those who wanted to defend 
Africa, who wanted to strike a balance 
between the two sides by playing cat-and- 
mouse with them, were immediately eli- 
minated. 
But when opposition movements came on 
the scene at the beginning of the democra- 
tization process after the Cold War, they 
turned out even worse than the dictators. 
That’s a fact. The earliest opposition leaders 
turned out to be drunken, drug-addicted 
looters without principles or scruples. And 
the opposition leaders who returned after a 
long exile were, as I have described them, 
“persons alien to their country’s people and »

Hard facts 
1 Ww e African writerswork in gruelling condi- 
tions,” saysAhmadou Kourouma.“ Wri- 
ters are seldom rich anywhere in the world, but for 
us things are even tougher. We have fewer 
resources fewer readers and fewer publishers” The 
only available statistics which are not recent but 
are probably still valid, reveal that sub-Saharan 
Africa publishes three times fewer titles than the 
average for developing countries and 25 times 
fewer than that for the developed countries. 
“ There are two ways of writing in Africa,” Kou- 
rouma says. “ The first is to write about Africa and 
Africans. Writers denounce situations they know 
relatively well,and run risks by shouting out the 
truth. They can't expect big sales They write for rea- 
ders in developing countries, where people either 
can’t read or can’t afford to buy books. The second 
is to write for a wider public by tackling topics that 
are of interest to non-Africans as well as Afri- 
cans There are African authors living in France, for 
example, who write for an exclusively European 
readership. They are European writers even if they 
were born in Africa. Others manage to publish best 
sellers in France and are read in Africa as well, but 
that is more unusual. 
“| think that we should try and write for eve- 
ryone by presenting our problems as universal 
human problems We should follow the example 
set by the best Latin American literature. But Afri- 
cans are changing. The first African authors took 
up the pen to show that they too could express 
themselves as writers that they too were human 
beings. At the time, some people had doubts 
about that. . . . My generation has gone further 
than that. We have often chosen literature as a 
campaigning medium.” [|

way of life” and therefore incapable of gras- 
ping what was really going on. It’s true that 
both wanted first and foremost to take 
revenge and to get rich.Why? Because they 
all still believed in the mirage that power 1s 
all that matters. 
People had given up and let their lea- 
ders behave as village chiefs did in tradi- 
tional Africa. The dictators thought they 
could go it alone,taking decisions without 
even listening to their advisers. 
Government money was their money. All 
those who got rich were pawns of the 
government. The dictator’s power was so 
absolute that all kinds of things were 
expected of him. To give you one 
example, in my country even today, when 
a fairly well-known person dies, the fami- 
ly still expects the head of state to pay 
10,000 or 20,000 French francs ($1,800 
or $3,500) for the funeral! 
Since that’s how things were, it’s not 
surprising that democratization got off to 
a very bad start.The old power structure 
and all its works had to be destroyed, 
because everything revolved around

them. It was 1mpossible for anything 
constructive to be built on the existing 
foundations, not only by the corrupt dic- 
tators and their cronies, but also by the 
opposition leaders who came back from 
exile abroad and hadn’t a clue about what 
was really going on. People always behave 
in the same way. As the Malinke proverb 
says,“The dog won’t give up its awkward 
way of sitting.” 
One criticism that has been made of your 
most recent novel is that in Africa reality 
and magic seem to be inseparable. Your 
anti-hero, the dictator Koyaga, defeats all 
his adversaries largely because of the 
strength of his magical powers. 
I don’t believe in magic. And when 
Africans ask me why I don’t, I say that if 
magic really existed, we wouldn’t have 
allowed the abduction of 100 million 
people, of whom perhaps 40 million rea- 
ched the Americas and 60 million died on 
the way. If magic really worked, the slaves 
would have turned into birds, say, and 
would have flown back home. I don’t

believe in magic because when I was a 
boy, I saw forced labour. If magic existed, 
the victims of forced labour would have 
been able to escape. But in a novel you 
have to describe your characters’ mentali- 
ty and ideas. Power and magic are insepa- 
rable in the minds of most Africans. The 
dictator not only has power and money, 
he also has the best fetishists and sorce- 
rers. Because they are the best, the dicta- 
tor is invulnerable and his power is limit- 
less. For the dictator’s entourage and for 
the people at large, power and magic are 
one. 
So how can Africa be successful 
in a world where science and technology 
are increasingly important? 
Rationality will gain ground at the same 
time as democracy, which is still far off 
but is slowly coming in. It won’t solve 
every problem, but we already have its 
foundation stone—the spoken word. 
Everywhere, we say what we want, and 
that’s quite an achievement. And one 
important thing we can say—and see—is 
that the chief’s almighty power is on the 
way out. The press can now expose 
corruption and abuses of power; a leader 
TALKING TO... 
has to campaign against his opponents in 
elections; it’s possible to get rich without 
being a stooge of the government. The 
leader is no longer a superman. He no 
longer has everything going for him. He 
has to shoulder duties and responsibili- 
ties. He is becoming like everyone else. 
And consequently the magical part of his 
power is disappearing. 
And yet at the end of your latest 
novel the dictator is forced to hold elec- 
tions, but “if people refuse 
to vote for him, the animals will 
come out of the bush, get hold of ballot 
papers and elect him with a landslide majo- 
rity.” 
Odd as it may seem, many people think 
that kind of thing is possible. They're even 
sure presidents get elected that way. But 
we're making some headway. Before, 
either there weren’t any elections at all, or 
if an election was held, the dictator only 
had to ask for 99 per cent of the vote for 
his wish to be granted. Now he is forced 
to cheat. Votes from wild animals are the 
last refuge of dictators in distress. u

A singular voice 
A “A week ago Koné Ibrahima had fini- 
shed in the capital,” runs the opening 
sentence of The Suns of Independence, mea- 
ning that Koné Ibrahima had died the pre- 
vious week. It set the tone for a novel in 
which Ahmadou Kourouma transposed 
into French the speech-rhythms and images 
of Malinke,his mother tongue.This was a 
new departure in the world of French-lan- 
guage African literature, which had hitherto 
tended towards academicism. Kourouma’s 
fiction may owe much of the originality of 
its form and content to its author’s eventful 
life story. 
Ahmadou Kourouma was born in 1927 
in the little town of Boundiali, today a local 
administrative centre in Cote d’Ivoire.His 
father was a nurse, and as such belonged to 
the colonized elite. He was called “doctor” 
and his rank gave him the right to use the 
services of Africans subjected to forced 
labour. But Kourouma was brought up by 
an uncle who was on the other side of the 
fence. He was a master-hunter, a leading 
member of the brotherhood that stood at 
the top of the traditional social scale because 
of the power it enjoyed by virtue of its wea- 
pons and the magic it acquired from bon- 
ding with nature. 
As a student Kourouma took part in 
protests at the Bamako Technical High 
School in Mali. T hen he was drafted into the 
French army and ordered to Cote d’Ivoire 
to participate in a crackdown on the emer- 
ging liberation movement, the Rassemble- 
ment DémocratiqueA fricain. When he refused 
to do this, he was drafted into the French 
colonial army in Indochina, a posting he 
only accepted because Bernard Dadier, 
then Cote d’Ivoire’s most famous writer, 
persuaded him that military experience 
would prepare him for the anti-colonial 
war which he believed to be inevitable. 
The next stage of Kourouma’s life came 
when he travelled to France to study 
science—a field spurned by most children of 
the African elite. He returned to Cote d’Ivoire 
just after independence and worked as an 
insurance executive, but did not stay long. “I 
was impervious to the magic of the single 
party, which claimed to be the only form of 
authority capable of developing the country,” 
he says. Kourouma was jailed for a few 
months and eventually went into exile. 
His second homecoming, in 1970, was 
almost as brief. When his play Le diseur de 
veérité (“The Truth Teller”), was published in 
1974, it was deemed “revolutionary”. So he 
left the country and lived in Cameroon and 
Togo until 1993, continuing his career in 
private insurance companies. 
At 72, he thinks that his “generation 
first got things wrong and then wasn’t up to 
the job.” This was the generation that came 
after the birth of the concept of Negritude 
developed by Léopold Sedar Senghor, “who 
had recognized the Negro’s qualities as a 
man, but an incomplete man. We naively 
believed that only colonization prevented 
Africans from becoming fully rounded 
people like any other. If Africans thieved, for 
example, it was because of colonialism. If 
colonialism ended, they would all get down 
to work.Everyone was going to make sacri- 
fices for Africa.But we didn’t take the rea- 
lity and psychology of Africa into account. 
TheSuns of Independence was the first book 
of its kind to emphasize that Africa was 
partly to blame for its own plight. The lure 
of wealth and power had got the better of 
Africans. And, like everyone else, intellec- 
tuals thought only of lining their pockets.” 
As he says this, Kourouma, who is a friendly 
giant of a man, bursts into a hearty laugh. 
“If I didn’t yield to temptation,” he says, 
“maybe it’s only because I didn’t have the 
opportunity!” [|

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
 
A working tool 
For me, as a teacher, the Courier is a very 
useful working tool. The subjects you 
cover, with all their human aspects, 
interest my pupils and give me ideas for 
many of my personal projects. 
Congratulations on your “new format”, 
with its short and clearly written 
articles which I find far more accessible 
to young readers.

The granny boom 
My name is Sasithorn. I enjoy reading 
the UNEsco Courier. After reading about 
old people in your December 1998 issue, 
I looked at my grandmother. I think I 
will take care of her and love her as 
much as myself.

Sobriety and realism 
We want to congratulate you on the new 
presentation of the UNESco Courier. Its 
remarkable sobriety is a positive feature, 
enabling readers to get an immediate 
grasp of the topic being covered. I found 
particularly memorable the poignant 
beauty and tragic realism of the photos 
of Russian miners that appeared in the 
November 1998 issue.The article that 
accompanied the photos depicted a 
world of total wretchedness, whose 
existence I had hitherto unsuspected. 
Julie Corseaux, 
Villejuif, France 
  
The green light 
You take a constructive approach to 
social and environmental problems. 
When will people learn the reflex that 
whenever a tree is felled another should 
be planted? When will there be a “decade 
for trees”? When will taxes on industry 
be paid directly to the ministry of the 
environment? When will we learn? 
Jaime and Dauphine Giraldo 
Lain,France 
 
The vanishing heritage 
We commend the conscientious courage 
you show in publishing articles 
highlighting offences against human 
dignity and against the natural 
environment on which we all depend. 
But we miss two features which seem to 
have disappeared: Greenwatch and 
Heritage. 
Michael and Elizabeth Rochester 
St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada 
The environment and the heritage still 
receive regular coverage, but in somewhat 
different form. The environment is covered in 
the “Planet” feature, and “Signs of the 
Times” regularly presents heritage-related 
topics. Editor
