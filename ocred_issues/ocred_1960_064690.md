CONCERT 
The “concert” given by blind men at the 
St. Ovide’s Fair in Paris in 1771. This 
humiliating scene so revolted Valentin 
 Haiiy that he decided to devote his life 5 
to helping the blind. He initiated the art 
of embossing books with raised lettering 
which the blind could be taught to read, 
started the earliest library for the blind 
and created in Paris the world's first 
school for blind children, which still 
exists as the National Institution of 
“the Young Blind. In time he was to 
~ become known throughout Europe as   
A he was strolling through the streets of Paris one September day in 1771, a young French- 
man, Valentin Haiiy was attracted by the sight of a crowd hooting and laughing in front of a 
large booth at the St Ovide’s Fair, then being held in the Place Louis-le-Grand ( ow Place 
© Venddme).On a platform raised above the tables of this open-air café, ten blind men scraped 
their bows in pantomime, drawing shattering discord from violins, cellos, basses and viols. 
They stared blankly at sheet music turned on the racks so that the notes were visible to the 
~ jeering audience. Their sightless eyes were ringed with huge pasteboard spectacles devoid of 
glass. They wore grotesque robes, with dunces’ caps and asses’ ears. Every day for two months - 
they had scraped, fiddled and kept up a monotonous accompanying chant, while their audience 
 jeered, banged tankards on the tables and screeched bawdy jokes. Fly anil 
© Haiiy viewed the scene with a mixture of pity and horror and, years later, recalling this signi- 
~ ficant moment in his life, he wrote: ~~ aS, VEE Cg - 
“Why was it that a scene so dishonourable to humanity did not perish in the instant of its 
conception? Why was it that poetry and picture should lend their divine ministration to the 
publication of this atrocity Ah! It was impossible that the scene before my eyes, bringing deep 
sorrow to my heart, should not inspire and arouse my soul. ah AN

mockery. | will make the blind read. | will put in their hands volumes printed by themselves.

give harmonious concerts. Yes, atrocious malinger, whoever thou art, the ears of the ass with

WHEN IS 
A PERSON

BLIND?

BSOLUTE and total blindness is almost an anomaly. 
Most blind people can “see” to a certain extent or at 
least recreate for themselves the image of what they 
can no longer directly perceive, using what are sometimes 
called “the eyes of the mind” or “the eyes of memory”. 
For the fact is that only four blind persons in every 
hundred are under 20 years of age and rarer still are 
those afflicted with blindness before the age of five, 
by which time a child's eye has absorbed a multitude 
of images of the surrounding world. Whereas the pro- 
portion of blind to seeing people in the world is about 
350 per 100,000 inhabitants, that of children under five 
is only seven per 100,000. a 
~ Sustained by hearing, by touch and even by smell], a 
person who has lost his sight still has the power to create 
a light within himself and to reconstruct the world 
around him. Thanks to this capacity he is no longer 
someone “different” from his fellows and has certainly 
no need of the kind of hurtful and upsetting pity which 
people so often show towards him. 
‘What he does need and has the right to is the con- 
sideration and help of society and this at once raises, as 
it has always done, the problem of the exact status of 
the blind in the community. As total blindness is com-. 
paratively rare, the problem in most cases is to decide to 
what extent a person’s power of vision is impaired, thus 
placing him fin a special situation. Blindness therefore, 
has come to be measured in practical or occupational 
terms, by ‘which the expression “blind” denotes “any 
person ‘who, by reason of the physical condition of his 
eyes, cannot live a completely normal life”. 
‘What, then, is a blind person? If some are deprived 
of the least perception of light, others can still register 
light and shade, can see colours if they are strongly lit, 
but cannot distinguish forms; others, again, can perceive 
forms, but are incapable of determining the exact place 
of these in relation to others. There are many other

variations. Some people have relatively good visual 
acuity in the morning and virtually none in the evening. 
In some a perfectly adequate power of sight is undermined 
by physical defects such as nystagmus (a regular, in- 
voluntary oscillation of the eyeball). Others, with suf- 
ficient central vision, have a reduced peripheral field. If 
such people are not literally “blind”—ab oculis, or “depri- 
ved of eyes”, a conception etymologically preserved in the 
French ‘word aveugle—they nevertheless are unable to 
live a normal life—to work, to study or to move about as 
freely as others. 
The concept of the visual field is a leading factor in any 
definition of blindness. A normal eye covers 135 degrees 
on the horizontal axis, and both eyes together, about 
180 degrees; the field of vision on the wertical axis is 
less—about 1105 degrees—as it is limited by the arch of 
the brow. In reaching definitions of blindness, several 
countries make use of these elements. In the United 
States, for instance, a person is considered legally blind 
if his central vision is less than a tenth of the average or 
his visual field is less than 20 degrees. 
The French definition of blindness includes anyone 
whose central vision, even when corrected by spectacles, 
does not reach a twentieth power of normal sight— 
anyone, that is, who cannot distinguish at one metre, 
something ‘which a person with normal sight could see at 
twenty metres. 
German law is far more rigorous and only recognizes 
as blind and legally entitled to assistance those whose 
vision is one-sixtieth of the normal. Bavaria goes even 
further and its definition of blindness only covers those 
with one-hundreth of normal vision. 
Several countries still measure blindness by the distance 
at ‘which the outstretched fingers of the hand can be 
counted—a metre in most cases, but as much as three 
metres in Egypt until recently. The two extremes in 
The Unesco Courier. — June 1960

criteria are those of Switzerland which in general recog- 
nizes any person as blind if he is unable to perform 
‘work requiring sight, and India, which only acknowledges 
total blindness. 
- Variations like these have stimulated the search for 
some standard definition ‘which would at once provide a 
universal criterion for use by all countries and which 
could eventually be established by international agreement. 
A standard definition of this kind was outlined in a report 
. submitted in 1954 to the U.N. Social Affairs Division. The 
report was also presented the same year to the General 
Assembly of the World Council for the Welfare of the 
Blind (WCWB) in Paris. It proposed that the benefits 
enjoyed by the blind should be given to persons possessing 
not more than 3/60ths of normal vision (after correction 
by spectacles) or suffering from a defect of vision (.e. a 
reduction of the visual field) which reduces its practical 
efficiency to 3/60ths. 
Statistics on blindness throughout the world are not 
strictly comparable because of the variation in national 
definitions. The proportion of blind people in the United 
States appears higher than in France because the Am- 
erican definition takes 1/10th vision as its standard while 
France takes 1/20th. After laws to improve the lot of 
the blind were passed in Britain, the number of registered 
blind people increased from 28,000 to 60,000. Furthermore, 
in some countries ‘with high proportions of blind people 
—China, Egypt and India, for example—available figures 
are not absolutely reliable. 
How many blind people are there in the world? A 
report submitted to the World Council for the Welfare 
of the Blind in Rome, last year, estimated that there are: 
about nine and a half million, or 3.58 in every thousand 
people, and that of these more than seven million live 
in rural areas. The report, presented by Dr van 
Schalkwijk, Chairman of the Rural Activities Committee, 
said that over 3,600,000 could be rehabilitated, more than 
- two million being capable of agricultural work.

JOBS OF EVERY KIND are now open to the blind thanks to modern appliances. Blind shorthand typists, for example, now have an almost noiseless machine for shorthand dictation at a speed of 140 words and more a minute. The French typist shown here is working from a tape-recorded text. On his right is a special pad on which he can make notes by perforating the paper with a stylet, guided by a slotted mobile ruler. Some of the world's early typewriters were devised primarily for the use of the blind.

   / HETHER it be a simple device for the writing 
of Braille, or the exciting promise of vision 
through electronics, the problem of persons deprived of 
eyesight has long attracted the interest and energy of 
scores of technical scientists. Throughout the 130 
years since Louis Braille came up with his system 
of embossed printing the variety and number of mechanical 
or electronic appliances designed to offset the handicap of 
. blindness has been extensive—and yet, modern science still 
“has brought no major breakthrough that would constitute 
real news for the world’s blind persons. 
The student of the problem must first attempt to under- 
stand just what is the handicap of blindness; that is, if he 
himself is not blind. The world-famous Helen Keller has 
often said that the greatest problem facing the blind is the 
attitude of society toward them—and while she was 
referring primarily to the handicap of social segregation 
and to barriers to employment, her statement does have a 
direct significance here. 
Basically, most people believe that the loss of sight 
reduces the human being into a vegetable-like organism 
‘that lives and breathes but which has lost all power to 
function normally. Upon closer inspection, experience or 
study, this exaggerated concept is found to be quite un- 
reasoning. Notwithstanding loss of sight, the average 
human being of normal intelligence and stable tempera- 
ment has an amazing array of personal capacities. Blind- 
ness, per se, does not change this fundamental fact.” The 
blind person can be assisted greatly by special tools and 
devices but only too often the proposed tangible devices 
upon examination do not prove useful in a working situa- 
tion. Even the otherwise skilled and well-meaning inven- 
tor is not free of misconceptions and is often startled at 
not meeting with enthusiastic acceptance of his ideas by 
agencies serving blind persons or by the blind themselves. 
An examination of the many reports of experiments 
and existing catalogues of practical appliances shows a 
consistent adherence, however, to a recognition of the real 
problem which ‘blindness imposes. This problem breaks 
down, generally speaking, into two large challenges to 
scientific imagination—communication and mobility. The 
first, more simply stated, means the obvious barrier of 
blindness to reading and writing, while the second refers 
‘to the more subtle and complex question of how to get 
about efficiently and safely from place to place. 
Past accomplishment and future lines of design and 
production depart from these two major challenges into a 
variety of less dramatic types of appliances that assist the 
blind person to meet various tasks in the household or on

the job. The essential and most significant fact at the 
moment nevertheless is that none of the dreams of blind 
persons themselves or of their imaginative scientific friends 
about an outright electronic substitute for sight in reading 
and in travel have even begun to be realized. 
Throughout the world at this very moment there is a 
growing awareness of the need for an intensive objective 
re-analysis of the basic theories that most technologists 
have accepted in the pursuit of a particular experiment. 
In the English language there is a growing usage of the 
words “human engineering,” an expression designed to 
convey the need to fit the machine to the man rather than 
fitting the man to the machme. 
URTHER, most of the recent advances in either 
the field printing or of personal mobility 
devices overlook the cold facts of economics. Those 
intended for the acceleration of the printing of Braille 
books, for instance, may actually involve an increase in 
cost of production over what already is an expensive 
Those intended for the use of individuals—even 
if found to be of practical value—would be units whose 
cost would be far beyond the ability of average people to 
purchase or for social agencies to supply at public expense. 
Finally, a general lack of exchange of information 
among the small but noteworthy army of thinkers and 
designers often causes the expenditure of time and funds 
upon lines of research or the actual construction of 
prototypes that earlier and similar experimentation already 
has shown to be unproductive of practical results. 
  
An informal appraisal of the total picture, however, has 
a brighter side. Within recent months, there has been a 
refreshing new attempt to bring some of America’s best 
minds to bear upon basic problems. It is generally 
believed of late that much of the lack of success in this 
field is due to failure to examine the real impact of sensory 
deprivation upon the human being. Similar lines of 
thinking - recently have been expressed openly in 
Scandinavian and United Kingdom circles concerned with 
service to blind people. Such utterances and conferences, 
however, must at some point be brought to recognizable 
stages of crystallization of thought. 
During the past five years, there has been an acceleration 
and diversification of efforts to examine the potential for 
this field which arises through the use of electronic 
computers. While the imagination of many persons has 
been stimulated to believe that machines such as the IBM

704 may somehow produce in the form of Braille type 
books and periodicals for blind persons in a matter of 
minutes, these interpretations have not been kept in proper 
perspective. Nevertheless, remarkable progress has been 
made in programming such machines to produce advanced 
forms of Braille in an economically short time, provided 
that some new light can be shed upon the most practical 
types of input and output. At the moment, there is 
intense interest throughout the world in the present status 
of such experimentation as well as a desire to examine the 
long-range implications. 
The application of modern techniques in the field of 
sound recording, relatively well-known in English-speaking 
countries for a quarter of a century, has only recently 
been introduced in others. The first “international” 
recorded library service has been under way for European 
countries for about three years, and is enjoying gratifyingly 
rapid expansion. 
ADICALLY new designs are being suggested 
~~ thanks to new impetus among private concerns 
who are showing a tendency to believe that there is a 
general market for longplaying recording machines. 
Within recent months, the library programme of the blind 
in the United Kingdom has partially introduced the use 
of cassette-type tape playbacks. The United States with 
more than 50,000 disc-type record players in use is reluc- 
tant to convert, but is carefully studying local and foreign 
experience with tape. 
There are in existence a number of highly useful 
“gadgets” available in various countries which do help 
blind persons in everyday tasks of daily living, study, work, 
and recreation. 
Changes in daily living as a whole have had a 
kaleidoscopic effect on blind people. Radios, telephones 
and electricity have done a great deal for them, as well 
as central heating, insecticides, antibiotics, typewriters and 
recorders. There are, however, a great many special aids 
of various kinds which make life easier for a blind person. 
These include Braille watches, dials for cooking stoves, 
measures for food, self-threading needles, bread cutting 
boxes, signature guides and many others. For the blind 
woman there are aids for personal grooming, for the blind 
man safety and electric razors have been a boon. 
Nowhere is the blind person better off today than in 
the home, for here gadgetry has come to its fullest bloom. 
To an astonishingly large extent, the devices to simplify 
life for people with sight have also simplified life for those 
who are blind. 
There are sufficient tools in existence to enable the blind 
student to pass courses in physics, mathematics, chemistry, 
biology or geology. A vacuum forming process is produc- 
ing relief maps at low cost and can be used for designs 
and diagrams and in other ways to assist the study of the 
sciences. Special mathematical devices are available that 
can work out calculations of the most intricate kinds.

to do a job, and persuade an employer that the job is 
possible. For instance, there are measuring devices for 
length, weight, temperature, time, relative humidity, 
barometric pressure, blood pressure, voltage, current, 
resistance and capacity. The blind shorthand typist today 
has an almost noiseless machine on which he can take 
shorthand dictation at a speed of 140 words and more a 
minute. Other tools are produced for the use of blind 
workers, such as piano tuners, shoe repairmen and 
carpenters. Blind telephone operators are enabled to 
function with the aid of special adaptations to standard 
switchboards. 
A constant search for new games and other recreational 
aids is going on. Among standard games especially 
adapted for the blind are chess, draughts, dominoes, 
puzzles and playing cards. Bingo boards can be had, as 
can a game of fairly recent origin called scrabble which 
can also double as an anagram game when extra tiles are 
secured. For the active blind adults there are many 
activities such as rowing, riding, skiing, wrestling that can 
be carried on with little or no assistance. A portable

bowling rail is the only special piece of equipment which 
comes to mind. 
When blindness is the sole disability there is probably 
no great need for research into ‘medical aid. Often, 
however, blindness is one aspect of a systemic disease as 
in diabetes or Hansen’s disease (leprosy) or multiple 
sclerosis. For the blind diabetic, special syringes with 
devices for locating the centre of the rubber cap on the 
insulin vial and with automatic injections are available. 
For other purposes there are clinical thermometers and drop 
measures. 
Helen Keller's example has helped bring into focus‘ not 
only the needs of the deaf-blind but their potentialities as - 
well. A growing number of deaf-blind persons are finding 
employment and the need has been met for a suitable alarm 
clock which would shake the bed at the proper time for 
risimg. A device, such as the American Tellatouch, has 
been developed which activates the appropriate Braille 
symbols from a keyboard similar to the typewriter

As blind Joyce Rominger handles the tele-

deftly and swiftly as her sighted colleagues. 
She can do so thanks to a special Braille dial 
switchboard—one of many now in use in various 
countries. Joyce graduated from the Alabama 
School for the Blind in 1956 and afterwards 
took Braille switchboard training. She over- 
came her next big hurdle when she found an 
employer who believed she could handle a 
dial switchboard and was ready to go to the 
trouble and expense of installing one. The 
Braille attachment to the switchboard is a 
square box containing rows of plungers under 
each of which is a station number in Braille. 
When a call comes in, the corresponding 
plunger pops up with a buzz. Joyce locates 
the plunger, reads the Braille below it (left,

Braille on the switchboard to locate the station

- promises currently is the basis for a proposed international 
congress on technology in blindness. With the formal 
endorsement of the World Council for the Welfare of the 
Blind and the active co-operation of national agencies in 
a number of countries, interested bodies in the United 
States are now attempting to arrange for the financial 
“support that would be needed to prepare and carry out 
such a conference. While the proposed meeting, probably 
to be held in late 1961, will of course provide an 
opportunity for exchange of information and views on 
every appropriate item, its principal objective will be to 
establish if possible just what lines of investigation and 
construction hold the most promise for eventual success. 
A profoundly honest re-searching of concepts is hoped 
for. At its conclusion, and with the expected co- 
operation of all organized research centres and agencies 
for the blind, there should be the establishment of a 
continuing system for the reporting of research in progress 
and results obtained—such information to then be available 
to others who wish to enter their ideas into what is 
undoubtedly an exciting challenge.

[Eh ES 
Braille 
translation 
by computer 
opay much attention is being given to the 
T automation of Braille publishing so as to give 
blind readers greater access to specialized 
books and articles. Needs of the blind far exceed the 
Braille books available despite the efforts of Braille 
publishing houses and volunteer transcribers. 
Now a new programme has been developed by 
IBM using its famous 704 electronic computer, in co- 
operation with the American Printing House for the 
Blind. Together they have developed a process of 
using the computer to translate the printed text 
into Braille. The machine can convert a 300-page 
book into Braille in one hour—a job that would take 
skilled translators more than six days. Writing 
Braille is a complicated process where symbols often 
change their meaning in a different context and 
many special contractions and abbreviations, much 
like shorthand, are used. 
‘Texts to be translated by the electronic computer 
are first transcribed on punched cards. These are 
then fed directly into the computer, which has had 
stored in its memory a programme or set of rules 
MAGNETIC TAPE with 
Braille rules, stored in the 
computer's memory. 
for conversion of English into Braille. The IBM 704 
executes as many as 600 instructions per word in 
less than a fortieth of a second. Contractions and 
abbreviations are determined by matching the letters 
against an alphabetical table of Braille equivalents. 
How does the process compare with that made by 
a human translator? For example, suppose that the 
word “changeable” is to be transcribed. A skilled 
human transcriber would write this as seven 
Braille characters, Ch-a-n-g-e-a-ble, where ch and 
ble are contractions each represented by a single 
Braille character. Though there is also an “ea” 
contraction in Braille, the transcriber does not use 
it because here “e” belongs to a root word, “change,” 
while the “a” belongs to a suffix, able.” 
To accomplish the same result, the IBM 704 goes 
through about 600 separate steps for the average 
word, but converts 4,000 words per minute into 
Braille—roughly 100 times faster than the human 
transcriber. This is made possible because electrons 
travelling at the speed of light, enable the machine 
to handle 40,000 instructions per second.

EYE INFECTION is a major cause of blindness, and trachoma the chief culprit, disabling some 400 million people throughout 
the world. In India, with more than two million blind persons, trachoma ranks as the largest single cause of preventable blindness. 
Above, Dr. Jatnam Singh, member of a medical team, examines a young trachoma victim in a village of northern India where in 
some rural areas between 80 and 90 per cent of the people suffer from this infection. The team, with WHO help, works its way 
through the region, examining patients, organizing mass antibiotic treatment, and carrying out research on spread of infection.

tary societies, has opened up a new world of oppor- 
tunity for sightless people. 
While the incidence of blindness is still fairly high in the 
advanced countries, normally preventable blindness has 
been reduced to a minimum through the progress and 
general availability of medical, hygiene and social services. 
But the condition of the infinitely larger blind popula- 
tions in the lesser developed parts of the world is very 
different indeed. It is worst of all in Asia and Africa where 
about four-fifths of all the world’s blind people live, and 
where, until very recently, blindness was’ fatalistically 
accepted everywhere as one of the irremediable conditions 
of mankind. Although the highest incidence of the loss 
of sight is in Africa, where in the upper reaches of the 
M oRrE than a century of effort, mainly through volun- Nile more than 4,000 per 100,000 population have defec- 
tive vision, by far the greatest concentration of blindness 
is in Asia. 
India alone has more than 2,000,000 blind persons, of 
whom at least 100,000 are children. In the city of Cal- 
cutta there are more blind people than in the whole of 
Canada. Existing welfare services hardly touch more than 
one per cent of those without sight, most of whom are 
widely scattered in villages all over the vast sub-continent. 
and are doomed to live, as the blind of India have always 
lived, as beggars or family dependents, often in misery 
and want. 
Probably 90 per cent of all the blindness in the lesser 
"developed countries is caused by preventable disease. In 
West Africa, for example, over 400,000 people suffer from

onchocerciasis, or river blindness, an eye disease spread 
by carrier flies. This is so rampant in the northern parts 
of Ghana and Nigeria that these regions have been called 
“the country of the blind”.- (Unesco Courier, April 1956.) 
Trachoma, which has been a major cause of blindness 
for over 2,000 years, claims millions of victims in many 
parts of the world and, in fact, only western Europe, North 
America and Australasia are relatively free from it. But 
with modern drugs trachoma can now be cured. 
In the past ten or twelve years some remarkable progress 
has been made. Since its foundation in 1949, the World 
Council for the Welfare of the Blind has grown from a 
small group, representing mainly the countries of Western 
Europe and North America, into a truly international body 
drawing its members from all the five continents. Central 
organizations for blind training and welfare are now 
established in many Asian, African and Latin~American 
countries where nothing of the kind existed previously, and, 
what is also very important, methods to check the spread 
of eye disease are being put into effect on a steadily 
increasing scale. 
The United Nations and its special agencies have taken 
active interest in the problems, of the blind by intensifying 
research into the causes of blindness, by controlling disease- 
spreading pests, and by improving living conditions and 
treatment facilities. Mobile eye dispensaries are operating 
successfully in Egypt, India, Pakistan and elsewhere. The 
World Health Organization and the U.N. Children’s Fund 
contribute greatly to the world wide anti-trachoma cam 
paign. 
* 
ALUABLE research projects have been carried out in 
West Africa by the Royal Commonwealth Society for 
the Blind. (This British voluntary organization, 
founded in 1950, is working through local blind welfare 
associations in about thirty emergent territories throughout 
the world.) In the course of a four-year investigation of 
blindness in West Africa an ophthalmic team, led by 
Dr Frederick Rodger, travelled more than 100,000 miles 
through Ghana, the Cameroons and Northern Nigeria, 
often under very difficult conditions in remote and wild 
country. 
Intensive ophthalmic examinations of more than 8,000 
. individuals, selected from widely different areas and racial 
groups throughout the region, showed that trachoma, cata- 
ract and onchocerciasis are the main causes of blindness 
but that much sight is also lost through smallpox, measles, 
tuberculosis and syphilis. The 350-page report resulting 
from this investigation, entitled *Blindness in West 
Africa”, is the most detailed and exhaustive study of its 
kind ever made and has won international acclaim. 
For a century or longer the training of blind people has 
been confined almost entirely to handicraft workshops in 
towns and cities. Some 80 per cent of the world’s blind 
live in rural areas, however, and up to now very little 
indeed has been done for them apart from the limited 
though excellent work of foreign missions. Realizing this, 
the 1959 Assembly of the World Council for the Welfare 
of the Blind passed a resolution urging the need for train- 
ing in agricultural and rural crafts so that sightless people 
might become useful members of their own communities. 
This new conception of blind training has been 
pioneered with great success in five African countri s and

also in the Far East by the Royal Commonwealth Society 
for the Blind. The results have been so promising that 
similar schemes of rural training may soon be launched 
in other countries. They have demonstrated the value of 
- a policy which, if it were to be applied on a really large 
scale—for example, through the community development 
programme of a country like India—might in a few years 
open up a new age for very large numbers of blind people 
“in the lesser developed parts of the world. 
A typical rural training scheme in Africa is the 60-acre 
Ikeja Farmcraft Centre, near Lagos, which is run for the 
Nigerian Government, Blind villagers who attend this cen- 
tre, often with their wives, live for a year in surroundings 
which are quite familiar to them. During an intensive 
course the students learn about every branch of agriculture, 
from the clearing of virgin bushland to the harvesting and 
marketing of the crops they grow. 
Experiments have been made with the cultivation of a 
- wide range of local crops such as yams, maize, groundnuts, 
cotton, ochra, sun hemp, pineapples and so on. Using 
mud, bamboo and pahn leaf, the students learn also to 
build their own living quarters and shelters for the 
livestock. Students also spend a part of each day in 
the workshop learning to make articles from home-grown 
materials which will have a ready sale in the villages. 
The first sixteen blind students attending the Ikeja cen- 
tre arrived in a helpless condition and most of them were

THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND. This scene which recalls 
Breughel’s painting is a tragic everyday fact in large areas of Africa. 
The blindness is caused by a disease called onchocerciasis for which 
a little black gnat is responsible. When it bites a human being, 
it transmits microscopic worms which multiply under the skin, 
then invade the tissue of the eyes, eventually bringing total blindness.

however, they were all 100 per cent physically fit, able to 
tackle almost any job on the farm, and confident they 
could be acceptéd as useful members in the village com- 
munities to which they returned. : 
How important rural training can be in a country where 
four-fifths of the blind population are villagers has been 
shown’ at the Malayan fishing village of Kuala Besut in 
Trengganu. For less than £50, the community built and 
equipped a workshop and dormitory where blind villagers 
can now provide the local fishing industry with rope, fish 
frames and traps, brooms and rakes—all made from 
locally grown materials, 
The National Association for the Blind in India has 
shown keen interest in such schemes of rural training 
because, as mentioned earlier, most of the 2,000,000 blind 
of that country live in scattered village communities. The 
problem in India may be measured by the vast numbers 
involved, but a start may be made soon. 
The second All India Conference for the Blind, held at 
Bombay in June, 1959, passed a resolution urging the 
Central and State Governments, together with voluntary 
societies working for the Indian blind, to establish agricul- 
tural and rural training centres which would provide sight- 
less people with adaptive training in simple pursuits in 
their familiar rural surroundings. Such schemes, it is 
hoped, may be included in India’s third five-year Plan,

HELEN KELLER 
WORLD CRUSADE 
FOR THE BLIND 
Helen Keller, known as the Ambassador of the 
Blind, celebrates her 80th birthday this month. 
To mark this event, the American Foundation 
for the Overseas Blind is raising a $1,250,000 fund, 
“The Helen Keller World Crusade for the Blind”, 
to be used for work among the world’s sightless 
people. Miss Keller has been associated with 
the Foundation since its inception more than 
40 years ago and as its International Relations 
Counsellor has spent much time in areas of the 
Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America 
where nine-tenths of the world's blind live. Blind 
and deaf from early childhood, she rose above 
her handicaps to become one of the best-known 
figures in the modern world. At 24 she graduated 
from college; since then has been constantly 
travelling, writing and working to improve condi- 
tions for the world’s blind. She has given cou- 
rage and assistance to innumerable blind people 
for she believes that the blind should live and 
work like their fellows, unremarked and with 
full responsibility. She herself is a vivid example 
of what special education and training can achieve 
and she can look back on a lifetime studded 
with achievements. Perhaps better than anyone 
she can preach the gospel of self help for she 
has lived it. Below, during one of her journeys 
Miss Keller examines a broom made by blind 
craftsmen in Kfar-Uriel, Village of the Blind, Israéi.

### 64587: Victory in sight over the babel of Braille

VICTORY IN SIGHT OVER 
THE BABEL OF BRAILLE 
by Sir Clutha Mackenzie 
In the century since Louis Braille invented his 
ingenious “touch” alphabet of raised dots, a Babel 
of Braille developed as his system was applied 
in a variety of ways in different languages. In 
1949 the Government of India asked Unesco to 
take up the problem of the unification of Braille, 
and rapid progress was made towards a broadly 
uniform Braille system for all languages and 
~~? 
T* task, to which UNEsco set its hand for two and 
a half years from July, 1949, has brought rich rew- 
ards in the field of Braille reading and writing. It brought 
an end to the long arguments over conflicting systems in

many Asian, African and Latin-American countries and at 
the same time resulted in the rationalization of the systems 
used in Yugoslavia and Spain. Through the genérosity of 
the American Foundation for Overseas Blind, Braille 
presses have been established in many centres throughout 
the world to print much-needed school text books, maga- 
zines and general literature; this has all gone along with a 
big upsurge in the general rehabilitation of the blind of 
these great areas. 
  
  
scripts. In 1952, a World Braille Council was 
set up under the aegis of Unesco. Chairman of 
the Council was Sir Clutha Mackenzie, himself 
blind, who had been in charge of Unesco’s work 
in this field throughout this time. Here, Sir 
Clutha describes some of the results that 
have already been achieved through Unesco’s. 
efforts to aid the unification of Braille scripts. 
I first encountered Braille conflicts in 1939 when, at the 
request of the Government of Bombay, I studied the 
schools for the blind in that Province. One of the most 
glaring defects was the existence of two divergent Braille 
systems in the city of Bombay itself with the result that 
the children and ex-students of the two schools could not 
read one another’s Braille forms. 
When I returned to India in 1942 to establish an Indian 
St Dunstan’s for the rehabilitation of the war-blinded, it 
appeared that India had no less than eight rival systems. 
  
These arose from the fact that early missions, in founding 
small scattered schools, adapted Braille in their own ways 
to local languages. About half of these systems followed 
the original letters of Louis Braille, the gallant, blind 
Frenchman who had designed the Braille alphabet in 1827. 
As Indian languages, however, employ from fifty-five to 
sixty-five letters, the possibilities of the twenty-six Roman 
letters were soon exhausted; and almost no uniformity held 
good among the remaining letters. 
Braille, it should be explained, is comprised of the sixty- 
three possible combinations of dots employed in the 
domino sox (three dots high and two wide). This is 
ample for a script of from fifty to fifty-five letters plus 
punctuation and accent marks; but difficulties arise when 
the letters exceed these numbers. The schools were all 
alive to the grave handicaps this situation imposed, but 
conference after conference failed to bring agreement. 
The attitude most of the schools took up was that each

would be delighted to attain uniformity were its own code 
accepted. 
The Central Government's Department of Education 
made a new approach in 1940 when it set up a special 
committee to study the problem and to recommend a code 
for All-India. It is accepted practice among modern 
workers for the blind that Braille matters should be decided 
by the users of the system, the blind themselves. The 
Education Department, unfortunately unaware of this, 
appointed four sighted men, only one of whom had any 
extensive experience of Braille teaching. 
  
Its report, published in 1943, only contributed to 
further confusion by adding a ninth system. The findings 
were referred to me in my capacity as secretary of a Joint 
Committee of the Departments of Health and Education 
appointed to report on the big question of the problems of 
The Unesco Courier. — June 1960 
new code as it complied with none of the basic rules of 
the Braille system. Simply put, these were that the same 
letter or the same or nearly similar sound of a letter should 
everywhere be represented by the same Braille character. 
Were the Indian blind to confine their reading and contacts 
to only one language, this would be of little importance; 
but the fact that the educated Indian blind almost invariably 
learn at least one foreign language (and often two or even 
three) makes this principle essential. 
Another factor of importance is that most languages 
employ “contracted Braille.” With European languages 
this form is based on frequency studies of the common 
combinations of letters used as prefixes, suffixes and 
digraphs. In English, for example, “ing,” “ed,” “dis” 
and the cH, GH, sH and TH all have their single Braille 
sign. A few of these had been embodied in the earlier 
Indian systems, most Indian languages expressing these 
sounds by their own single letters. Again, Indian and 
many other Oriental languages have more vowels than 
English, but the additional vowels can mostly be 
accommodated by the extra vowels of European languages. 
We gathered together an ad hoc committee of blinded 
Indians, each knowing from three to five languages, and 
the blind English head of a school for the Blind in the 
Madras Presidency. This Committee designed an Indian 
code which would fit in with these principles. Their 
report was duly discussed with the Education Department’s 
Special Committee, but this had no immediate effect on 
the situation. 
Today, however Braille books, especially for educational 
and vocational training purposes, are being printed at

Stamps to honour 
& help the blind 
by C. W. Hill 
A LTHOUGH by its very nature philately is one of the 
cultural pursuits which the blind are unable to 
enjoy, the philatelist can make an interesting and thought- 
provoking collection of stamps which have been issued in 
aid of funds for the blind, or in honour of those who have 
devoted themselves to helping the blind. 
One of two stamps issued in France last December in 
aid of Red Cross funds portrayed Valentin Haiiy who, 
inspired by the efforts of his contemporary, the Abbé de 
I’Epée, on behalf of the deaf and dumb, opened a school 
in Paris for the education of young blind persons. The 
work which he began in 1784 is now carried on in France 
by the Valentin Haily Association and his school has 
become the National Institution for the Young Blind. 
Hatly’s experiments with the printing of books in a 
raised type which the blind could read with their finger- 
tips were continued by Louis Braille, a pupil and after- 
wards a professor at the National Institution. Braille’s por- 
trait is shown on a French stamp of 1948 which paid tri- 
bute to his work and the 150th anniversary of his birth 
was marked last year by the issue in the Soviet Union of 
a stamp which also bears his portrait. The universal bene-

fits of the Braille type are illustrated on a Brazilian stamp 
of 1954 issued to celebrate the centenary of the founda- 
tion of the Benjamin Constant Institute for the Education 
of the Blind in Brazil. The design shows a portrait of 
Constant and the hand of a blind person reading a book 
in Braille. 
Many countries regularly issue stamps bearing a pre- 
mium in aid of social work among handicapped persons, 
including the blind. One stamp of the Netherlands charity 
series issued in 1956 appropriately showed a Rembrandt 
etching of “Old Blind Tobias”, and the two French Red 
Cross stamps of 1957 reproduced engravings by the seven- 
teenth century artist, Jacques Callot, in which the miseries 
of poverty and blindness are portrayed with the realism 
typical of his work. The provision of radios for the blind 
is another branch of social work for which a French 
stamp was issued, this being in 1938. 
When the new underground Basilica was consecrated at 
Lourdes two years ago, Monaco celebrated the occasion, 
and the centenary of the Apparition of the Virgin Mary, 
by issuing a series of commemorative stamps. One of these 
recalls the miracle of the workman Bourriette, who had 
lost the sight of an eye in a mining accident and claimed 
the complete restoration of his sight when he bathed his 
eyes in water from the spring of the Massabielle Rock. 
A collection of stamps connected with the blind would 
be incomplete without the issues which honour blind men 
who have contributed to our cultural heritage. Many 
Greek stamps recall the epics of Homer, who by tradition 
was blind, and a bust of the poet forms the design of two 
recent Greek issues. One of Britain’s greatest poets, John 
Milton, was also blind and his portrait is to be found on 
a stamp of the Soviet Union issued in 1958 to mark the 
350th anniversary of his birth.

Dehra Dun, and —for the first time in India—in a uniform 
code capable of serving all the different languages of the 
sub-continent. At this, the first central institution of its 
kind in India, a small but very valuable beginning is being 
made with the immense task of attacking what is one of 
the major social problems of that country. 
Making a report for the Government of China in 1947 
we found a similar situation to that in India—eight 
conflicting codes. - Workers for the Blind in China 
however had the justification that Chinese ideographic 
script of 50,000 characters was a much harder nut to 
crack. 
The blind British manager of a Peking bank had designed 
quite an original system. Reuters’ Telegraph Co. had 
discovered that the Chinese language was composed of 
some 400 syllables and tone marks. Instead of trying to

telegraph the 50,000 ideographic characters, Reuters had 
serially numbered the syllables. The bank manager 
replaced these with their corresponding Braille numbers. 
The result was a system which the Chinese child could 
master in the course of time, coming to recognise the 
numbers as the syllables which they represented. 
The adaptations of Braille for the various languages 
employing Arabic script numbered about fifteen. These 
included, not only the various dialects, but also certain 
distinct languages from Hausa in the West to Malay in the 
East. Some of them read from right to left and some 
from left to right—this directional problem was only solved 
after some difficulty, but the Arabs courteously yielded to 
World Braille practice. 
I had the pleasure, in Pakistan in 1954, of receiving 
forty sets of Koran in the new International Arabic Braille 
from an Arabic Braille Press in Hashemite Jordan, and of 
presenting them to schools for the blind and leading blind 
mullahs as a gift from the American Foundation for 
Overseas Blind. The Braille was so closely akin to the 
new Urdu Braille of Pakistan that it could be read 
immediately by blind Pakistanis. The blind Pakistani is 
fond, too, of Persian poetry and will be delighted when 
Persia has her own Braille press and publishes these works 
in International Iranian Braille. 
The two and a half years I was with UNESCO were 
entirely taken up with the solution of orthographic Braille 
problems in five continents; but with their end UNEScoO 
bequeathed the continuation of the task to the World 
Braille Council, a small body to which I was nominated 
Chairman. Much work remained to be done, not only in

getting the new International Braille systems adopted, but 
also in other fields of Braille where disunity persisted, 
notably in musc notation and mathematical and chemical 
symbols, 
Louis Braille was an intelligent pupil of the first school 
for the blind in the world, that was founded in Paris in 
1782. He became both an organist and a Professor of 
Mathematics at the School, and naturally he commanded 
the services of his six dots so that they could adequately 
represent these subjects as well as orthography. In the 
course of their spread, however, divergencies have also 
grown up. 
In Paris in 1954, under the joint auspices of UNESCO 
and of the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind, we 
held our International Conference on Braille Music Nota- 
tion. A new International Manual has been published 
which has led to an improvement in International 
uniformity, but not yet to the degree anticipated. Nev- 
ertheless, negotiations continue in the hopes of gaining 
more complete agreement. During 1959 at the W.C.W.B. 
Conference m Rome (which mow has totally succeeded 
UNEsco as our old parent body) it was agreed that the 
study of mathematical and chemical symbols should be 
proceeded with, this task to be in the hands of Professor 
Pierre Henri, himself blind and the ultimate successor of 
Louis Braille in the same post in the same school in Paris 
—Institution Nationale des Jeunes Aveugles. 
The adaptation of African languages to International 
Braille, when reference is made to the International Pho- 
netic Alphabet and the special Table of Braille Signs for 
African Languages, contained in the UNEsco publication, 
“World Braille Usage’, presents no real difficulty. The 
Committee on Bantu Languages is engaged at this moment 
in planning alphabets for four South African languages 
and similar work is under way in Central, East and West 
Africa. The problems arising from the publication of sev- 
eral forms of Spanish contracted Braille in Latin-America 
have also been solved ; and thus the excellent work, under- 
taken by UNEsco, has yielded and is still yielding rich 
results in all three departments of Braille.

‘When I wrote this in an article for THE UNEscO COURIER 
(The Blind are Achieving a Fuller Réle in Everyday 
Life—March, 1952) I was, in no way asserting—as has 
since been said—that it is pointless to educate the blind. 
To have upheld such a viewpoint would have been absurd. 
In a world where educated men and women are striving 
to bring the benefits of education to those who have so 
far been deprived of them, it is inconceivable that one 
group of human beings—the blind—should be ignored. 
Furthermore, anyone who is deprived in some measure 
of his physical or sensorial powers must make greater 
demands on his intellect to compensate for what he lacks. 
Even the sighted person sees as much with his mind as 
with his eyes. But where the sighted person perceives, the 
blind one must learn to understand and to familiarize 
himself with what he cannot see: the implements he uses, 
his home and his town. He has to use his imagination 
and create a mental picture of so many things. If John 
Locke the English philsopher called for “a sound mind in 
a sound body,” we might in the present context affirm 
that “the less sound the body the greater the need for a 
sound mind.” :

one of its elements, frustration is likely to occur. Unless 
there is some form of compensation, sightlessness tends to 
cause an imbalance.” Education provides just such a 
compensation: by widening vision through the mind it 
acts as a safety valve, prevents the development of

frustrations and reduces the danger of inner emotional 
conflicts. 
A man does not live in a vacuum, however, nor act by 
and for himself alone. He is an integral part of an entity 
where physical world, social universe and individual self 
come togelther. From this viewpoint, education offers to 
the blind person a way to restore himself in the eyes of 
other men and thus, as it were, in his own eyes. Thus 
the feeling that it will compensate for their reduced 
physical state stimulates the hunger of the disabled for 
education. 
It is in this respect. that the Braille system, that 
indispensable tool of learning which helps the blind to 
equality with other men, has proved its worth. It was, 
in fact, regarded at one time as a cure-all, as the answer 
to the most difficult problem in the rehabilitation of the 
blind. But whereas the development of intelligence and 
the acquisition of knowledge are certainly useful elements 
in this process of rehabilitation, they are by no means 
the only ones. 
The American psychologist, Thomas Cutsforth, himself 
blind, advanced views in a study published in 1933 which 
rather shocked people at the time, but which are 
generally accepted today. Cutsworth argued that, no 
matter at what age it occurs, blindness immediately begins 
to shape the personality in direct relation to the fact of 
sightlessness. This is perhaps most apparent to the 
ordinary person in a physical way. We have only to think 
. of the peculiarities of stance or gesture which are exhibited 
by some blind people. They are so completely related to 
blindness as to be known as “blindisms.” 
The uninformed person would regard these as nervous 
tics caused by blindness. They are in fact, usually fixed 
habits, mostly acquired in very early childhood: a display 
of hostility to the physical world (head thrown back, fore- 
arms held horizontally with hands hanging down, walking 
on the heels with toes raised and feet apart); photophobia 
(head held down); muscular activity designed to 
compensate for a sedentary existence (movements of the

their children, Janet and Billy, have family 
outings and are busy keeping up their modest

and playing the piano in cafés during weekends. 
Marjorie, a vivacious, cheerful woman, lost 
her sight when she was nine years old; Jimmy 
was only two when blindness struck him. 
Both their children have normal vision. A 
stranger, watching the group gathering around 
the piano (left) would never realize that two 
were sightless. “There are just a few things 
we do differently from other people,” says Mar-

they have to put our hands on it, They accept 
this as natural, because they grew up with it.”

‘DO-IT-YOURSELF’ 
STARTS EARLY 
Among children under five only seven 
in every 100,000 are blind whereas the 
proportion of blind people in the world 
as a whole is nearer 350 for every 
100,000 inhabitants. Thus most blind 
children have had sight at some time and 
benefit from a visual memory which is 
a definite aid to education. In many 
countries this education is given in special 
classes or special schools but as far as 
possible it follows the lines of that given 
to sighted children. Today many thou- 
sands of the young sightless are learning 
to step out without fear, to play and work 
with the seeing and to surmount their 
disability. Above, reading a Braille book 
in a U.S. school; left, young cooks in the 
making at an English school; right, learn- 
ing to clamber about fearlessly on these 
bars is part of the experience of living, 
studying and playing together which all 
children, sightlessor sighted, should have.

. HE 1897 census in Russia recorded 250,000 blind 
ww persons. They lived mostly in regions inhabit- 
ed by national minorities with low living and cultural 
standards and ‘where infectious diseases (trachoma, 
smallpox, blennorrhoea) were prevalent. 
The majority of the blind then lived on a. miserable 
pittance granted them by charities or on alms from the 
public. In the whole of Russia there was only one crafts 
centre for the blind (in St. Petersburg) where a few dozen 
persons ‘were employed making brushes and weaving 
baskets, though small groups of blind persons. were also 
employed in the workshops of the Moscow, Smolensk, 
Samara and Kostroma Schools for the Blind. 
In 1925 the All-Russian Society of the Blind was 
founded as a voluntary association of blind citizens in 
order to integrate the blind into society. Somewhat later, 
similar societies were founded in each of the Soviet 
Republics. 
To obtain funds the Society opened shops and dining- 
rooms, barbers’ shops and shooting galleries, organized 
collections in offices and factories and arranged lotteries 
and concerts. Work was found for individuals and for 
small groups of blind persons in co-operatives for invalids 
and in factories and offices. It soon became apparent that 
it would be more useful to open special workshop schools 
for the blind. The earliest of these were simple’ little 
workshops of the cottage industry type where brushes, 
baskets and felt boots were made. 
Today, all workshop schools are under the management 
of the Society of the Blind which runs 268 such institu- 
tions. In 1960 these ‘will produce a variety of articles 
valued at approximately 1,700 million roubles. 
The past seven years have seen the transition from the 
traditional types of manual labour for the blind to work 
in highly mechanized factories ‘where complicated 
techniques are used. The Society’s Moscow factories fill 
20 
  
  
  
 
government orders for a wide range of articles, including 
luminescent lamp regulators, electric motors, spare parts 
for seed drills, and electrical equipment; Leningrad 
factories turn out low-voltage transformers and conveyor 
belts for reaping machines; a Chelyabinsk factory makes 
cushioned seats for tractors, and a Gorky factory produces 
air filters for motor vehicles (nylon and metal). Other - 
items produced by the blind are coarse and fine filters for 
oil and diesel engine fuel, signalling apparatus for mines, . 
cardboard boxes of all types, electronic apparatus, 
mechanics’ tools, spare parts for motor vehicles, tractors 
and combine harvesters and plastic articles. 
The ‘workshop schools accept people who have lost their 
sight at a mature age and have to change their occupation, 
as well as young people who have graduated from the 
state secondary schools for the blind. 
The type of school workshop, is selected with a view to 
employing, as far as possible, only blind persons; the 
equipment, its arrangement, safety precautions, ete., are 
all adapted to the work of blind persons. Only those 
operations beyond the scope of the blind are performed 
by sighted workers; as a rule their number (including 
clerks and specialists) does not exceed 33% of the total 
number of employees. 
The usual shields and guards over moving parts of 
machines that are considered adequate for sighted workers 
are quite inadequate when the machines are operated by 
. blind persons. - Die presses operated by the blind must 
be fully enclosed though this is not necessary for sighted 
workers. Factories, and even many co-operative 
workshops employing invalids, do not find it necessary to 
break up production processes into a number of single 
operations, but where the blind are employed this 
is absolutely essential. Blind workers also need automatic 
stopping devices, sound signalling systems and magnetic 
switches in place of knife switches. 
In the Soviet Union, factories employing blind persons 
are run at a profit. In 1959 total profits amounted to 306 
million Toubles all of which was used to improve the

working and living conditions of blind persons and to 
provide for holidays and medical treatment. This income 
enables the society to carry out all its activities and to 
expand its operations without government subsidies. 
The law on universal compulsory seven-year education 
applies equally to the blind and the state provides special 
schools in which the blind are given a normal education. - 
Children receive a general education and new methods, 
employing relief models, make up for the lack of visual 
aids to teaching; the syllabus is fully comparable to that 
of the ordinary schools. 
In the Russian Federation of the U.S.S.R. there are 62 
boarding schools for blind children, 11 evening schools for 
young 'workers and three inter-regional, correspondence 
schools providing a full secondary education without loss 
of working time. School graduates may continue their 
education or engage in some productive work. 
N recent years particular attention has been 
paid to the technical side of education. 
Workshops are being opened at schools where pupils work 
at cardboard-box making and at die presses, do mecha- 
nics’ jobs and woodworking and make brushes: In addi- 
tion to technical training and production practice in the 
school workshops the pupils of some schools get extra 
practical training in factories belonging to the Society of 
the Blind. When a blind person is graduated from a 
secondary school he has, in addition to his general edu- 
cation, learned some trade. 
There are several hundred blind persons among the 
students of Soviet schools of higher learning. Their state 
scholarship grants are 50% higher than those of sighted 
students ‘which enables them to hire readers. There are 
blind barristers, blind schoolteachers and blind lecturers

BLIND CHILDREN 
LEARN TO DRAW 
Drawing lessons for blind children sound just 
as strange as music lessons for the deaf. Yet 
various methods which make this possible 
have been devised in different countries. A 
graphic system of teaching known as “typhlo- 
graphy” is employed in Russian schools for 
blind children, for example, and enables them 
to think in terms of space, to develop their 
spatial imagination and to draw objects on 
paper as they “see” them. The process 
includes the use of easily-made and easy-to- 
understand outlines of objects such as the 
icebreaker (far left). Different sides of the 
object are shown so.that when these are 
combined (details of the icebreaker’s deck 
are shown below side view) the child has a 
good idea of the complete object, even when 
it has a complicated form. Typhlography goes 
much further than simple drawings and iden- 
tification. It can teach sightless students 
such skills as geometrical diagrams and pro- 
jections and industrial design. As in all 
modern schools for blind children, the methods 
used here follow as closely as possible those 
of equivalent grade schools for the sighted. 
The result is a development of character and 
behaviour patterns that include the fun and 
satisfaction of teasing a schoolmate by giving 
a tug at her plait as she climbs the stairs. - (left).

in colleges. At Moscow University alone there are nine 
blind professors and lecturers. : 
There are 1,500 various kinds of libraries for blind 
people with 824,000 books printed in Braille. From 275 
to 350 titles of books are printed annually. The Societies 
publish several periodicals in Braille, The monthly “Life 
of the Blind” has a circulation of 12,000. 
Persons invalided - by blindness enjoy considerable 
privileges. They do not pay income tax. They work only 
six hours a day and have longer annual holidays than 
sighted workers. They do not pay fares on city transport. 
The blind are also granted pensions on favourable terms. 
A youth of 21 (blind from childhood) would be granted a 
pension of 85% of his month’s wages up to 500 roubles 
and 10% on all over 500 roubles, plus 15% for nursing; 
the pension is payable in addition to wages. Old age 
pensions are also higher. A blind woman is entitled to 
an old-age pension at the age of 40 provided she has 
worked for ten years; a blind man who has worked for 
15 years is entitled to an old-age pension at the age of 50. 
The public health bodies carry out a periodical examina- 
tion of all blind persons to check up on the possibility 
of treatment or for the provision of artificial eyes; they 
also render therapeutic or other medical assistance. In 
Pyatigorsk there is a special sanatorium for the blind. 
Year by year the working and living conditions of the 
blind improve. This year the All-Russian Society of the 
Blind plans to spend some 142 million roubles on building. 
As a general rule factories, houses, clubs, schools, 
kindergartens and nurseries are built on a single lot, as 
one big complex. This allows for the concentration of 
the blind and provides better conditions for the organiza- 
tion of their leisure. 
Pre-revolutionary statistics registered only those persons 
who were totally blind but the present system of record- 
ing regards as blind those whose better eye has a visual 
acuity of 8 % or less (with correction) or ‘with a diminished 
- fleld of vision up to 10 degrees. 
In the Russian Federation there are 97,900 persons who

are classified as first category invalids (i. e., helpless 
invalids) on account of loss of sight; they include the 
totally blind, those with a visual acuity of less than 4 % 
with correction and aged persons whose weak vision is 
due to senility. 
The All-Russian Society of the Blind also has on its 
books about 68,000 persons ‘with imperfect sight. They 
have a visual acuity of more than 4 % but are granted 
the same privileges as the totally blind and are given 
employment in the Society's factories or in invalid co- 
operatives; some of them are also found employment in 
ordinary factories. : 
(1 | TATISTICS for the past forty years show. that 
Ju the number of totally blind adults has been 
reduced to one third of the former figure and the number 
of totally blind children to one fifth. In view of this the 
question of reducing the number of schools for the blind 
has been raised. Greater attention is being paid to the 
-establishment of interregional boarding schools. It is 
planned to set up separate schools for blind children and 
for those with impaired vision; the latter will employ 
special visual teaching aids and suitable optical devices 
and lighting. In this field there is still much to be done. 
The initiative of THE Unesco CoURIER in devoting a 
special issue to the problems confronting the blind 
throughout the world will draw the attention of the gen- 
eral public to those problems and result in greater contact 
between Societies of the Blind in different countries, a 
pooling of their experience and an extension of their 
work. .

### 64599: Do's and don'ts for the sighted

DO'S & DON'TS 
FOR THE SIGHTED 
by F. Potter 
O NE of the greatest causes of depression, frustra- 
tion—and sometimes of acute pain—to the 
blind is the attitude of other people towards them. 
One naturally feels sympathetic towards anyone who is 
handicapped by blindness, and one is anxious to render 
him assistance whenever possible; but the manner in which 
that help is given can make a great deal of difference in the 
effect produced. 
It can make the blind person feel that he is still just 
like other people except for his lack of sight, or it can 
make him feel that he is a helpless encumbrance, and the 
person who has only recently been deprived of his sight is 
particularly vulnerable. Here are a few suggestions for 
@® When a blind person is seen standing near the edge of 
a pavement, it is very likely that he wishes to cross the 
road. But anyone wishing to help should not just take his 
arm and try to lead him across without a word; he may 
be waiting there for a friend. “Can I help you?”, will 
cover the situation quite adequately. If, however, he has 
decided to attempt the crossing unaided—which may even- 
tually happen if he has waited unsuccessfully for assistance 
for a long time—do not stop him in “mid-stream” to ask 
whether he needs your help, for. then the strain of trying 
to concentrate his attention on the traffic sounds all 
around him and of answering your question at the same 
time is very great. Just take his arm and lead him to safety, 
parting from him with a “you are all right now”, or “you 
have just crossed... street”. And don’t forget to give 
warning of kerbs and steps—*step up’, or “step down”. 
@® Some good folk, when leading a blind person, seize his 
"arm in a vice-like grasp and try to hoist it up to shoulder 
level. (Such over-anxiety to render maximum assistance 
giving aid in the manner in which it will be most 
appreciated. 
-@ It is obviously very desirable for a sightless person to 
carry a white stick in the street——primarily as a means of 
mobility, and also to make clear his incapacity and need 
of assistance under certain conditions. Yet many blind 
people feel that it is degrading to carry such a stick 
because of the exaggerated pity which it evokes in the 
minds of the sighted. Such half-whispered remarks (which 
are usually clearly heard by the blind) as, “Look at that 
poor blind man! How terrible!” are often the cause of the 
man never carrying a white stick again. 
Don’t lift him bodily on to the bus 
has sometimes even resulted in the man being lifted almost 
bodily on to aus.) A light grip on the arm with firm 
pressures for directional guidance and verbal instructions 
regarding steps are all that are really necessary, and do not 
cause the person to feel clumsy and awkward. After you 
help him across a street, it is unlikely that he will ask you 
to accompany him further, thereby causing you incon- 
venience, The fact that he is out alone will indicate that 
he is quite able to go on his way unaided, requiring assis- 
tance only when crossing busy roads. 
® A visually handicapped person sometimes finds it diffi- 
cult in a crowded room to know-exactly when he is being 
addressed, especially if .the speaker is some distance from 
him. Under such circumstances, confusion and embarrass- 
ment are avoided by the use of his name when opening 
a conversation. 
® Never “talk over” him to his guide, as he would much 
prefer to speak for himself. : 
Don't assume all the blind have keen hearing 
@ There are a number of fairly widespread misconceptions 
about the blind which might usefully be corrected. The 
most common one is that blind people have unusually keen 
hearing. This belief is particularly fallacious in western 
countries where the great majority of the sightless become 
blind after the age of fifty—50 per cent after sixty. 
Thus, for physiological reasons, most blind people are not 
likely to have a more acute sense of hearing than the ave- 
rage sighted person with normal hearing. However, lack- 
ing sight, the visually handicapped are obliged to make - 
greater use of other senses, and are thus able to con- 
centrate their whole attention on what they hear and smell 
so as to gain information about their surroundings. An 
“observant” blind person can learn quite a lot about a 
stranger from his footsteps, his breathing, his handshake, 
and, of course, his voice, manner of speaking, and laugh. 
® It is also erroneous to think that most blind people read 
Braille, Because of the relatively high incidence of blind- 
ness after the age of fifty, the majority of blind people are

unable to cultivate a sufficiently sensitive touch to read 
Braille with any great fluency, and this has led to the de- 
velopment of the “Talking Book” (recorded on discs) 
which is increasing in popularity as reproducing apparatus 
becomes cheaper. The Braille system is easily memorized, 
but the cultivation of a sensitive touch usually takes many 
months or even years. 
® Music in all its forms is obviously a potential source of 
great pleasure to the blind, but it is certainly not true to 
say that all blind people are musicians or even enjoy music. 
If a man is tone-deaf before he loses his sight, he remains 
tone-deaf afterwards. In short, generalizations about the 
blind are just as misleading as those sometimes applied to 
races and nations, 
® Broadly speaking, one should treat blind people as per- 
fectly normal individuals who happen to be without sight 
but who are in complete possession of all other faculties. 
If, in a moment of forgetfulness, you were to ask a blind 
man what he thought of your new shoes, he would be very 
amused and feel himself complimented.

France for funds to assist schools for the blind in various 
parts of the world. 
Sponsored by the French National Commission for 
Unesco and conducted by the French Federation of 
Unesco Clubs, with the aid of Boy Scouts’ organizations, 
the campaign ‘was sparked by a radio broadcast on the 
night of November 24, Before morning, over 15 million

The Gift Coupon Programme has for ten years been a 
popular vehicle for just such focussing of public attention 
on problems in education throughout the world, as well 
as for enlisting individual co-operation in working to 
solve them. Designed at first to help reconstruct schools

The organizers of the French campaign chose their 
theme—“Aid for the World's Blind”—to commemorate 
the 150th anniversary of the birth of Louis Braille, 
inventor of the system of writing which bears his name, 
and also to mark the 10th anniversary of the world

throughout the world still lead the same existence 
as those in the Middle Ages. They are beggars, fortune- 
tellers, street-singers. The Braille alphabet has indeed 
been adapted to nearly all languages, but in many 
countries there is not a single library of works in Braille 
and there are far too few specialized instructors. Africa 
and Asia, which have the highest proportion of blind 
persons, particularly lack teachers and equipment. 
With these stark facts in mind, the French UnEsco 
Clubs set out to collect enough money to buy all the 
Braille books and supplies, all the musical instruments, 
all the physical training equipment and all the arts and 
crafts materials listed as vitally needed items by the 
institutions for the blind among UNEscoO’s projects.

took three blind children into their care and began to 
instruct them in Braille. Today, with some 50 sightless 
pupils, the school has grown into a pioneering model cen- 
tre for blind training in Ghana, among whose 4 million 
inhabitants there are some 50,000 blind persons. 
The perfection and extension of instructional techni- 
ques in an Indonesian institution will also be assisted as 
a result of the campaign. The Foundation for Rehabili-

tral Java where the number of blind is estimated at more 
than 100,000 persons, has established in its home and

Co-operation of local scout groups was arranged to man 
these booths on the night of the broadcast. 
Another innovation was the plan to offer a postcard- 
record to the first 100,000 donors responding to the radio 
appeal. This card featured an original design by artist 
Jean Lurcat and a recording of a traditional Christmas 
carol, arranged by organist Jean Langlais and sung by 
the choir of the French Institute for the Blind. Since 
then, 25,000 copies of this postcard-record have been 
ordered by the German National Commission for UNEsco 
with the idea of starting a similar campaign in the Fed- 
eral Republic of Germany. 
Pre-campaign publicity did not speak of fund-raising 
or the exact nature of the programme to be carried out 
on the night of November 24 during the popular broad-- 
cast “Vous étes formidables” over radio station “Europe 
N° 1”. On that night radio personalities launched the 
appeal to millions of listeners, describing the projects, 
giving background information on Unesco and its work, 
and asking listeners to go to the central collection points 
and donate to the cause. 
The result truly was “formidable”. Blind persons in 
five countries will long be grateful to the people of France 
for this singular demonstration of good will. 
MATERIALS FOR THE BLIND 
GRANTED FREE ENTRY 
NDER its programme to promote the free flow of 
information between countries, UNEsco works for 
the elimination of import duties and postal charges . 
on information materials needed by the blind. 
Duty-free entry for books and other publications in 
Braille is granted under the UNESCO-sponsored Agreement 
on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Materials, now applied by 32 countries. These countries 
also grant free entry to other educational, scientific or 
cultural materials if consigned to approved institutions, 
and provide import licences and foreign exchange for 
all materials for the blind. 
Acting on a proposal inspired by UNEsco, the Universal 
Postal Union decided in 1952 to allow publications for 
the blind to be mailed abroad post-free. In an appeal 
to Member States, UNEsco asked governments to apply 
this concession liberally and to exempt such publications 
from internal postal charges as well. A number of 
countries have since granted these concessions.

THE ANATOMY LESSON is an important element in the training of a masseur. Here, at the training centre of the Valentin Haiiy 
Association in Paris, two blind students (on left) study the formation of the human skeleton while a blind instructor gives other 
students a lesson in the technique of massage. Blind people have increasingly shown themselves to be adept at this work. 


### 64612: Let's stop playing blind man's rebuff

LET'S STOP PLAYING 
BLIND MAN'S REBUFF 
by Léon Bataille 
“Unless a blind person has a streak of genius, he 
should steer clear of intellectual pursuits.” These 
two opinions were recorded during a recent inquiry in 
France where a cross section of all classes and ages was 
asked for its views on the place of the blind in society. 
Such negative views were by no means isolated ones, 
even in the country of Louis Braille and of Valentin Haily, 
the great pioneer in the field of social rehabilitation for 
the blind. The enquiry showed too that even people with 
good educational backgrounds viewed blindness as an 
affliction which condemns its victims to a life of apathy. 
Most people seemed to think that work could never be 
anything more than a pastime for the blind, a kind of con- 
solation or simply something to distract them from their 
infirmity. 
But there are others in the world who think differently. 
Henry Ford, the American automobile magnate, renowned 
T= BLIND?" —“Useless members of the community.” for his practical common sense, 'wrote in his auto- 
biography: 
“The subdivision of industry opens places that can be 
filled by practically anyone. There are more places in 
subdivision industry that can be filled by blind men than 
~ there are blind men. And in each of these places the man 
who shortsightedly might be considered an object of 
charity can earn just as adequate a living as the keenest 
and most able-bodied. Industry organized for service 
removes the need for philanthropy.” 
What about the blind themselves? What do they think? 
In their minds there are no doubts whatever. To them 
work is something far more important than a means of 
gaining a livelihood. It is no mere chance that Article 2 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—"“everyone 
has the right to work, to free choice of employment’~-is 
" so often quoted by speakers at the international con- 
ferences of the blind.

### 64612: Let's stop playing blind man's rebuff

LETS STOP PLAYING 
BLIND MAN’S REBUFF 
(CONT'D) 
As Pierre Henri, professor at the 
National Institution for the Young 
Blind, in Paris, has expressed it: 
“The desire to be useful, to lose the 
feeling of being a burden on others, 
to earn their living ‘like other people’ 
is, In the case of the blind, no mere 
wish; it is an aspiration, an 
obsession.” 
History may well be studded with 
the names of blind men who achieved 
fame through their talent or genius, 
but the right of all blind men to 
work is a comparatively new concep- 
tion. 
Since 1945 most of the European 
countries and those of North America 
have taken steps to assist the social 
and occupational rehabilitation of 
their blind citizens though the 
resources brought to this task are 
widely divergent as also are: the 
methods used and results achieved. 
Some countries consider they have 
solved the problem by granting pen- 
sions to the blind. Others feel it is 
enough to provide educational and 
entertainment facilities. Most, 
however, have tried to help the 
blind to equip themselves for a gain- 
ful occupation, and fo find jobs. 
Higher productivity & 
lower accident rates 
F or far too long the only possibility 
open to the blind was to enter 
some restricted, overcrowded 
profession such as piano-tuning or 
playing in an orchestra; more 
recently they have been able to take 
up massage. All that most of them 
have been taught, however, are jobs 
like making brushes or re-seating 
cane chairs despite the fact that 
there are more and more jobs in in- 
dustry and business which could be 
adequately filled by blind people. 
The experience of business and - 
industrial concerns in, among other 
countries, France, Great Britain, 
Canada, the Soviet Union, Denmark 
and the United States, shows beyond 
doubt that the blind are capable of 
performing a wide variety of jobs, 
including complicated ones, provided 
production methods are suitably 
adapted and simplified. They are 
conscientious workers and their pro- 
ductivity is equal to or even higher 
than that of equivalent sighted 
workers, especially when they have 
been given a thorough training. 
Moreover, man for man, they have 
fewer accidents at work since their 
blindness makes them take special 
care. Finally, employers have been 
amazed by the psychological effects of

JUST LIKE ANY 
OTHER FACTORY 
T the Saurma factory in the Paris suburb of Suresnes there is 
A the hustle and bustle typical of any busy factory.” Here men 
are unloading raw materials from a truck; there a ‘woman fills 
cartons with tins of floor polish while across from her a man packs 
soap tablets into boxes. At bench and machine, men and ‘Women 
work swiftly and deftly. Yet most of these workers are blind and the 
rest are deaf and dumb. There is only one unhandicapped person— 
the foreman. : : 
In this factory which turns out soap and household cleaning pro- 
ducts, the skills and capabilities of blind and other handicapped 
people are used to the full. The enterprise has four aims: to turn 
people into’ qualified workers after only a few weeks’ training; to 
provide gainful employment for the physically handicapped; to earn 
profits which can be used to help blind and other disabled persons; 
to demonstrate convincingly to employers that they need have no 
hesitation in taking blind workers on their. staffs. 
This last goal is certainly the most important. One of the chief. 
obstacles with which blind people have to contend in their struggle 
to make their way in life is the reluctance of many firms to put them 
to work. 
Thus a factory like the Saurma—a private undertaking and en- 
tirely self-supporting—has many useful lessons to offer. All its 
workers were trained on the spot and their working conditions, salaries 
and social benefits are, in general, equal or superior to those prevailing 
for equivalent workers in other factories. - 
Not only is the factory run at a profit, but the individual produc- 
tivity of its workers is comparable to that of sighted ones. This was 
shown ‘when studies were made of such operations as the riveting of 
openers on tins of floor polish, the moulding of bars of soap and the 
folding, filling and sealing of their paper packaging. 
The day when employers realize that blind people, once properly 
trained, can efficiently carry out jobs in factory, workshop and office, 
a great step will have been taken towards the full integration of the 
handicapped into society. 
1 Even in the factory laboratory the work is carried out by blind people. 
« Here a worker fills a mixer with the ingredients for making soap. Certain 
jobs, in the factory—the filling of tins with hot, liquid floor wax, for example 
—are, however, given to sighted persons (the deaf and dumb). 
2 Filling up cans with liquid floor polish from a pump is a job which blind 
» people manage easily after a short period of training. 
Another kind of work which the blind have no trouble in learning to 
» execute swiftly and efficiently is packaging. Here, a woman worker 
folds cardboard into the form of a box and packs it with bars of soap. 
4 For reasons of security all the machines used by the blind workers 
» are worked by individual hand or foot controls. Thus the operator 
chooses the moment to work the machine, and at the same time is able 
to maintain a steady rhythm otf production.

LETS STOP PLAYING 
BLIND MAN’S REBUFF 
(From page 28) 
taking blind persons on their staffs 
and the spirit of solidarity that grows 
up between those who can see and 
those who cannot. 
In Great Britain foday there are 
more blind people working in industry 
than in special workshops or at home. 
In the United States, which has 
98,000 blind people between the ages 
of 15 and 54, 20,000 are working in 
industry amongst sighted people. Of 
the 6,000 blind in Denmark, 10% are 
in paid employment, either full or 
part-time. A thousand of the 3,500 
blind people in Norway (out of a total 
population of three and a half 
million) are employable. 
Of the nine and a half million blind 
people in the world today over seven 
million live in rural areas and the 
majority of these in countries now 
in the throes of economic develop- 
ment. Thus, though the ever increas- 
ingly widespread application in the 
economically developed countries of 
the right of the blind to work 
represents a great step forward, this 
does not mean that the problem in 
the world as a whole is anywhere 
near being solved. 
Millions could train 
for work on the land 
HE problems of giving effect to 
this right are obviously not the 
same in the industrialized coun- 
tries as in the agrarian ones. In the 
latter where three-quarters of the 
world’s blind people live, they must 
be trained for agricultural work, 
except where industrial development 
provides some openings. 
Today a vast effort is being made 
in this direction in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America, with the help both of 
the United Nations and several of its 
Specialized Agencies, and of non- 
governmental organizations such as 
the World Council for the Welfare of 
the Blind, the World Veterans Federa- 
tion and the British Commonwealth 
Society for the Blind. 
Special centres where the blind are 
trained in agricultural work have 
been set up with the help of inter- 
national specialists, and the ex- 
periences of the countries which 
have done a great deal of social 
and occupational rehabilitation are 
being adapted and put to use in less 
advanced regions. 
Results naturally vary from one 
country to another, but in general 
there is mo doubt that for blind 
people the world over a new era has 
opened since the end of the Second 
World War. 
30 
 
 
TO EARN THEIR LIVING like everyone else is an ardent desire of the blind. For 
long they were restricted to a few overcrowded professions, but growing experience 
in business and industrial concerns of many countries has shown that the blind are capable 
of doing a wide range of jobs provided production methods are suitably adapted and 
simplified. Above, students learn to use a sewing machine at a special course organized 
in Paris by the Association Valentin Haily, which takes it name from the great French 
pioneer of the rehabilitation of the blind. The women turn out work for hospitals and 
public institutions in the French capital. Below, in the printing shop run by the same

body or head, hand rubbing, passing spread fingers in 
front of the eyes in cases where there is still some ability 
to distinguish light). To the lack of spontaneous imita- 
tion can be attributed that facial inexpressiveness which 
. gives young blind people an appearance of precocious 
maturity and is also responsible for the non-socialization 
of gestures. . 
The psychological and psycho-social effects, though 
unseen, are none the less real. They include a tendency 
towards an intellectual and social egocentricity which 
leads the blind person to develop an idea of the world 
around him and of his relations with others purely in 
terms of self. They also include an inclination towards 
excessive verbalism (which is misleading as to actual 
intellectual endowment), egocentric day-dreaming (which 
makes up for.a decrease in outside activities and opens 
up a pleasant world which can be shaped at will), motory 
Inertia and an integration with the limited circle of his 
own kind. 
‘Voiceless’ objects ‘speak’ 
through his finger tips 
HE effects on character, which are simply the conse- 
quences of the above personality traits, are more 
familiar to those closest to the blind person. They 
may run from aggressivity te a habitual or systematic 
withdrawel into a private world, depending on tfempera- 
ment and circumstances, and they open the way to end- 
less disputes. 
In reality the picture is not as black as would appear. 
Here a deliberately pessimistic approach has been taken ° 
in order to show the effect produced by a physical 
handicap when it becomes the dominant element in the 
development of personality. At the same time it reveals 
clearly the scope of the efforts which are needed to offset 
this disturbing influence. Generalizations should be 
avoided, . however, because of various factors that exert 
their influence. 
Firstly, in Occidental countries at least, congenital 
‘blindness is rare and even those who become sightless 
before the age of six or seven—before they have had time 
. to acquire the attitudes of the normally sighted and to 
absorb a sufficient number of visual images—are a small 
"minority, probably making up less than 5% of the blind 
people of a given country. And it should be kept in mind 
that two-thirds of the known blind are over 60 years of 
age. Thus most blind people have been able to see for 
most of their lives and have amassed visual images to 
which they continue to cling. 
Secondly there is the wvital impulsion ‘which subcon- 
sciously brings a person to refuse the idea of being 
_ defeated: it pushes the child to explore, to conquer, to 
‘master his world and to imitate the sighted people around 
him. This attitude, above all others, opens the way to 
freedom for the afflicted from their affliction, and can 
lead them to the supreme victory of no longer being 
conscious of if. . 
Thirdly, and directly related to this; the attitude of 
those surrounding the blind person must be taken into 
account. Studies have shown that the development of 
the young blind person is above all conditioned by that 
attitude, which is itself governed by the affectivity (or 
even the neuropathic state) of the parents—especially the 
mother—rather than. by their intellectual capabilities. 
It should be clear that 'we can do more for those “in the 
shadows” than merely bring them *intellectual light”, 
valuable as this may be. The education. of such an 
individual calls for more than the mere removal of 
ignorance; it is primarily a question of “normalization”, 
of removing as far as possible the consequences of the 
“abnormality”. 
On the physical level this involves repair, the reduction 
of the ocular results of the malady. If they are to be 
accepted in a climate which is free of pity and of anything 
~ PROBING THE PS 
_=w==v | & BEHAVIOUR OF THE BLIND 
he Unesco Courier. — June 1960 
CHOLOGY 
likely to induce an instinctive revulsion, then certain 
things must be done without delay for the blind person. 
Certain other physical handicaps are scarcely noticed in 
the sighted person, but take on a major importance when 
accompanied by blindness. 
Closely related to the foregoing but with an additional 
“intellectual element is the problem of coping with space 
7
 
and the world around. The man with normal vision does 
not have to learn to move about, nor to use makeshifts 
(awareness of obstacles, for instance), nor to interpret 
such fleeting signs as small sounds, subtle smells and 
vocal inflexions. There is no limit to the number of 
“voiceless” objects which are therefore not apparent to 
the sightless person: he must take the initiative and 
make them “speak” to him through his finger-tips. A 
whole course of specialized instruction is needed. 
The world of people is no less difficult for the sightless 
than the purely material world. Blindness is the subject 
of numerous preconceived ideas which are distinctly to 
the disadvantage of the victim. The sense of inferiority, 
insecurity, frustrations or inner conflicts induce in the 
blind *“associal” or even “anti-social” reactions. Once 
again, this calls for a course of emotional training and 
character moulding which may not involve visible 
instruction but which is none the less a permanent 
preoccupation of those concerned with the education or 
re-education of the sightless. Additionally, there is the 
question of social conduct, imitation and non-verbal 
conventions which the normally sighted person acquires, 
preserves or adapts through spontaneous imitation but 
which must be induced (or maintained) in the blind unless 
they are to become “desocialized”. 
These questions enter little, if at all, into the 
education of the normally sighted; but for those 
whose sight is seriously impaired, they are of more 
importance than grasping some subtle grammatical point 
or reading the classics, or learning dates or extracting 
square roots. Of course, the two things are not mutually 
exclusive, but if a choice must be made there can be only 
one answer. 
Serious danger of creating 
social & vocational misfits 
INCE 'We are concerned above all with a work of social 
rehabilitation, it is as well to stress that this should 
be based not so much on the subject’s background as 
on the surroundings in which he will eventually live. All 
educational systems tend to involve a loss of social 
standing precisely because they seek to “raise up”. But 
where individuals with a normal sensory equipment are 
concerned, there are so many forms of employment 
available to them that out-and-out failures are 
comparatively rare. For the blind, openings are limited 
and changes of occupation difficult. The school is some- 
times responsible for social inadaptability. In western 
countries - where mixing and Ilevelling-out tend to 
obliterate racial or social differences, this happens only 
in the sphere of professional activity, as some blind 
university graduates have found. 
.. The problem becomes of still greater significance when 
methods of educating or re-educating the physically 
handicapped, are passed on to economically under- 
developed countries. 
There have been missions or other religious groups who, 
not so long ago, took the blind, young and old alike, from 
their villages in Asia and Africa; who gave them a 
European education and then, unable to find employment 
for them, sent them back home where they were literate 
in an illiterate society, equipped to do work unrelated to 
local needs and customs and where sometimes even their 
traditional religion was no longer acceptable to them. 
Nothing could be better calculated to increase the 
‘difficulties of the blind and extend the gulf which 
separates them from society when that society is 
unprepared to assimilate them.

WAGING WAR ON THE LOCUST 
 
Sir, 
The map accompanying the 
article which you published on the 
war against locusts (A Desert in the 
Heart of London) did not include 
Madagascar where an anti-locust unit 
does in fact exist. Unfortunately, 
because the species of Locusta Mi- 
gratoria Capito which it fights is 
autochtonal, the unit receives no 
outside aid ‘although locust invasions 
sometimes cover as much as two— 
thirds of the island—an area as large 
as the whole of France. Today the 
anti-locust unit is equipped with 
aircraft ~~ specially designed for 
insecticide spraying operations, and 
it was certainly the first to use this 
form of attack just over ten years 
ago, on January . 17, 1950. The 
decisive action of this service has on 
many occasions kept famine at bay 
in Madagascar.

FROM A MULTI-RACIAL CLUB 
 
Sir, 
Mauritius is a small Island in the 
middle of the Indian Ocean, and 
500 miles from Madagascar, the 
nearest large land mass. It is very 
densely. populated ; about 400,000 
persons of Indian, 160,000 of mixed 
African, Indian and European, 
20,000 of Chinese and about 10,000 
of European, mainly French, descent. 
By some curious social process it 
happens that each of these groups 
plays a pretty specialised part in our 
society and economy; in other words 
we are all dependent upon each 
other’s presence here. 
A number of us—to-day about 100 
—have founded a movement here to 
maintain and extend our Mauritian 
unity. We are mainly professionals, 
and we include doctors, lawyers, 
priests, engineers, civil servants 
including senior British civil servants, 
Cabinet Ministers, merchants and 
planters ; Hindus, Roman Catholics 
Buddhists, Anglicans and Mo- 
hammedans like myself ; and people 
of French, Indian, Chinese, African, 
English and Scottish origin whose 
ancestors have lived on the Island 
for decades or even centuries. We 
are now flourishing enough and the 
pressure to join us is great enough 
for us to think of building a centre 
at which we can enjoy the freedom 
of talk, contact and informality 
which is our object. 
A British firm has very kindly and 
disinterestedly presented us with 
plans and advice to enable us to build 
club premises, which will, we hope, 
possess friendly atmosphere and 
will provide *neutral” ground on 
which members of all communities 
may meet without reserve. Un- 
fortunately the cost of building, 
about £15,000, is far beyond our 
means and I hope that any of your 
readers who share our determina- 
tion to take positive action to 
ensure that men and women of 
goodwill shall not be kept apart by 
social and racial barriers will help 
us to assemble some part of this 
amount. 
If so, and if they will write to 
me in Mauritius or to Mr. G. J. M. 
Schilling of Blyth, Greene Jour- 
dain and Co. Ltd, Plantation 
House, Fenchurch Street, London 
E.C.3, we shall be very happy to 
acknowledge contributions or to 
give further information. When 
the club premises are complete we 
shall keep on record in a prominent 
place the names. and nationalities of 
those who helped us to preserve 
this tiny ocean island from the 
darkness of racialism.

May I suggest that a similar issue

§ TORING UP SUNSHINE: A new 
system of individual or central heating has 
just been developed by French scientists at 
Mont-Louis in the Pyrenees where, since 
1952, a solar furnace has been operated on 
an industrial basis for the manufacture of 
refractory products. To extend the use of 
solar furnaces to heating buildings meant 
finding a way to store the calories produced 
by the sun in the summer for use during 
cold weather. The Mont-Louis scientists 
have now developed a method of storing 
solar energy in a sort of battery. Mass 
production of heating apparatus, they say, 
is already possible at a reasonable cost.

will be available to secondary schools in 
the U.S.A. later this year. Prepared by 
the American Institute of Biological 
Sciences, the films are basically of the lec- 
ture-demonstration type. Their sequences 
include material on living plant and animal 
life in forest, marine, mountain, desert and 
prairie environments, not normally available 
qin the classroom. The series has been 
designed to be so flexible that schools of 
all kinds can make use of it, in part or 
in full. 
m NIGERIA’S EDUCATION DRIVE: 
In Nigeria there are more schools—and 
more children going to school—in 
relation to the total population than in 
any other country in Africa. Latest 
statistics published (covering 1958) 
show that in Lagos, the federal capital, 
. more than 84 per cent of the children 
attend school; figures for the Eastern 
and Western provinces are respectively 
81 and 73 per cent. Compared with the 
previous year secondary schools have 
increased from 477 to 514. Higher 
education shows an impressive trend.

JEAN ROSTAND 
RECEIVES 
KALINGA PRIZE 
EAN ROSTAND, French scientist, 
science writer and philosopher, 
was awarded the 1959 Kalinga 
Prize for the popularization of 
science during o ceremony’ held 
recently at UNESCO House in Paris. 
Mr. Rostand was the eighth 
winner of the £1,000 award, a 
personal donation of Mr. B. Patnaik, 
an Indian industrialist, which is of- . 
fered annually by the Kalinga 
Foundation in the Indian State of 
Orissa as recognition to a {eading 
interpreter of science and also to 
strengthen ties between India and 
the world’s scientists. The winner is 
chosen by an international jury ap- 
pointed by UNESCO. 
The seven previous winners of the 
prize have been Louis de Broglie 
(France), Julian Huxley (United 
Kingdom), Waldemar Kaempffert 
{United States), Augusto -Pi-Suner 
(Venezuela), George Gamow (United 
States), Bertrand Russell (United 
Kingdom) and Kad von Frisch 
(Germany and Austria). 
The award of the Kalinga Prize 
to Mr. Rostand at the age of 66 is 
another laurel in a. long career 
which has already seen his election 
to the Académie Francaise. It would 
not be quite true to call Mr. Rostand 
a science writer: he is both a scien- 
tist and o writer, He is known 
throughout * the world for his re- 
search on heredity end genetics, 
based upon three decades of experi- 
mentation with frogs and toads. At 
the same time, he has written forty- 
odd- books on his fields of research 
as well as on scientific thought, 
philosophy and pure science.     
in bringing works which open new horizons 
of knowledge and afford a broader view 
of the world around them to people who 
might otherwise never have visited a library.

LIAL SELB GS CL i “a dl a 
The International Social Science Journal 
is published quarterly. Its contributors are 
specialists of renown, from all countries, who 
are asked to prepare a series of articles on the 
subject of scientific interest chosen for each 
issue. In the treatment of these subjects, an 
attempt is made to bring out the interdisci- 
plinary and international character of social 
problems and the social aspect of present day 
life. Occasionally an issue contains studies 
involving only one discipline, dealing usually 
with problems of particularly great interna- 
tional interest. 
A separate section of each issue is devoted 
to the subject on which the contributions are 
centred. Another section deals with the 
organization of work in the social science 
field and provides information on current 
research, news or accounts of various research 
institutes and teaching centres, and abstracts 
of publications and documents relating to the 
social sciences issued by international orga- 
nizations. A summary account is also given 
of the results of the main conferences or 
meetings at which social science problems are 
discussed. The multi-disciplinary approach 
of the International Social Science Journal, 
is one that can do much to satisfy the growing 
interest of all groups of society in the social 
sciences. 
Last issue: Citizen participation in political 
life, a study of political behaviour in England, 
Finland, France, Israel, Norway and the 
United States. 
In preparation: The sociology of leisure.

BLIND BALLERINAS 
At recreation time the co-educational school on Novo Alexyevskaya 
street in Moscow echoes to the shouts and laughter of youngsters 
playing or racing up and down stairways and corridors. The school 
is little different from thousands of others—except that all the chil- 
dren are blind. Photos shows a gay troupe of young girls enjoy- 
ing a lesson in the school's dancing class. See story page 20.
