DIVERSITY, ASYNONYM FOR CULTURE 
A voyage from China to Iran, using calligraphy as a compass; an explora- 
tion of Parisian melancholy, guided by a Japanese photographer; a return 
to the origins of Kung Fu, now an international art; a trip around the world 
along strands of Thai silk; a Turkish escapade with background music from 
Brittany... This month the UNESCO Courier dedicates its pages to cultural 
diversity.

THE BEAUTY OF THE SWAN 
Art draws its inspiration from the perfection 
of heaven and earth. Culture, from 
the perfection of nature. This idea was 
at the centre of a lecture entitled “Return to nature, return to 
our origins” given by the Chinese poet and calligrapher, Fan 
Zeng at UNESCO in May this year, as part of the International 
Festival of Cultural Diversity. IP 4 
  
   
CALLIGRAPHY, THE ART 
OF MAKING WORDS SING 
Persian calligraphy bears the imprint of a 
range of influences, while Chinese callig- 
raphy remains deeply rooted in local tradition, explains Iranian 
painter, calligrapher and psychoanalyst, Hassan Makaremi. But, 
whatever its history, calligraphy embodies our sense of “being 
in the world”. P 7

OF A FAMILIAR STRANGER 
“This is not a photo of a merry-go-round, 
but of its reflection; explains Shigeru 
Asano, a Japanese photographer 
fascinated by the light and shadows of Paris. He has been 
walking the streets of the city for 30 years. Nearly 
10,000 kilometres from his native Osaka, he feels at home in 
the French capital, where he finds an atmosphere of melancholy 
more to his taste than “Tokyo's dazzle”. P9

The folk traditions of Brittany are making 
a remarkable comeback after being con- 
signed to oblivion for decades. And, 2500 
kilometres away, traditional song is returning to Anatolian homes, 
having almost disappeared. Today, a non-profit association called 
“A Bridge over the Bosporus” is linking musicians from France 
and Turkey who share a similar passion and concerns. P 11

THE WARRIOR MONKS 
OF THE YOUNG WOOD 
The celebrated martial art, Kung Fu, 
was created fifteen centuries ago in 
China. We owe its origin to a 
Buddhist monk from India. From there, it spread to Korea, 
Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Japan ... to become, 
since the 1950s, a trend that has continued to fuel the dreams 
of teenagers around the world. But in this process of globalization, 
its intrinsic values are not always respected. P13 
\_ "AROUND THE WORLD 
"ON A SILK THREAD 
By the first half of the 20th century, 
| the silk tradition in Thailand was on 
its last legs, only to spring back in 
the 1950s, thanks to an American, Jim Thomson. As an ally he 
had a young Thai woman - none other than Queen Sirikit. This 
secular art form, which, today, combines traditional craft and 
industrialization, is passed down from generation to generation 
and has contributed to the country’s developmen. P14

Young man from the Celebes Islands, in Indonesia. 
This year, UNESCO’s celebrations of World Day for Cultural Diversity (21 May) were quite exceptional. 
Throughout the month of May, dozens of artists came from all over the world to demonstrate the wealth 
of humanity’s cultural diversity, as part of the first International Festival of Cultural Diversity. 
The Festival was held simultaneously in several countries, as well as the Organization’s headquarters, 
and was clear evidence of the fundamental bond between culture and diversity, 
he relationship between culture and di- 
versity is one of mutual foundation. Culture 
refers both to one’s original way of being, 
recognizable through one’s arts, one’s 
signs, and the rightful pride one takes in 
being akin to no other. Yet culture is also a 
gateway to all that is profoundly dissimilar, 
to the enchantment of the unknown. And 
as such, it is at once enhancement of diver- 
sity and continual construction of univer- 
sality, and in both cases always incomplete 
and inexhaustible. 
Thus it is simply a function of diversity — 
the one which gives it its simultaneous ex- 
plicitness and profusion. This is the sense 
in which one might say that there is no di- 
versity without culture and no culture with- 
out diversity. 
The UNESCO Courier 2009 N°5 
as this month’s UNESCO Courier shows. 
This thought seems all the more con- 
vincing as one gazes upon a world on the 
verge of becoming a space of integrated 
diversity. Fading are the juxtapositions of 
countless so-called differences. The Earth 
we live in today holds only one humanity, 
perhaps only one living kingdom compris- 
ing all the species. And the concept that 
enables us to reflect on the planet's critical 
state of affairs is that of diversity. 
It alone derives from universality and ac- 
counts for all singularities, treating them as 
an ensemble — and thus offers to the “the 
minds of men” a novel approach to their 
shared condition: one that befits the reality 
of their common destiny and can replenish 
their intelligence of the world. 
UNESCO has been devoted to this pur- 
suit since the adoption of its Constitution 
and increasingly, of late, in the wake of the 
2001 Universal Declaration on Cultural 
Diversity and of the 2005 Convention on 
the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. The 
Festival of Diversity, launched this year 
simultaneously in various countries and 
at UNESCO Headquarters, is an oppor- 
tunity to experience the primordial affinity 
between culture and diversity. 
This issue of the UNESCO Courier 
echoes the Festival of Diversity and sup- 
ports its aims.

### 186721: The Beauty of the swan

  
THE BEAUTY 
OF THE SWAN 
ature is more than generous to- 
wards humanity. Not only does it 
provide all the elements we need to 
survive — air, water and earth — but 
also regulatory forces, like the alter- 
nation of sun and moon or the ben- 
eficial passage of winds and rain, 
which have enabled living beings to 
prosper indefinitely, since the dawn 
of time.

“The joy of learning”, by Fan Zeng, 1998. 
Impatient humanity has returned 
this kindness with hostility. Last 
century, one biologist proclaimed 
that “we cannot wait for ever for 
the benefits of nature, we have to 
go and get them!” Like an insolent 
son raising his hand to his caring 
mother. Or a ferocious, wild croco- 
dile, with gaping jaw, that does not 
know the extent of what the Earth 
can serve up to us. 
Over 2500 years ago, the great 
Chinese philosopher, Laozi, classi- 
fied the components of the universe 
into five categories: first the visible, 
the audible and the tangible, then 
the invisible, that perfect existence 
named dao, a kind of Heavenly Law, 
comparable to Plato's Ideal, He- 
gel's Spirit or Kant's transcenden- 
tal Finality; finally, beyond the dao, 
is nature, “perfect existence in itself, 
spontaneously and already so 
In Buddhism, the notion of “in it- 
self” expresses absolute conformity 
to the meaning of things, concor- 
dance and relevance — all attributes 
of nature. This existence in itself 
endures, omnipresent, without limit, 
an incorruptible sign of the vast- 
ness of time and space. Ten billion 
light years would not be enough 
time to define it, ten billion years 
not enough to bear witness to its 
duration. 
According to Dirac, only the most 
sophisticated mathematics would 
be able to describe it. Two hun- 
4 
dred years earlier, Kant gave pride 
of place to mathematics in his “Cri- 
tique of Pure Reason’, anticipat- 
ing one might say, the inevitable 
supremacy of numbers which has 
gradually become established. 
But nature is distinct from the ra- 
tional but somewhat forbidding log- 
ic of numbers. It offers humanity the 
fullness of love and gentleness that 
are inherent in the beauty of Heaven 
and Earth. Let us recall the words 
of Zhuang Zhou, who lived in Chi- 
na 2300 years ago, in the “Spring 
and Autumn Period” - an unrivalled 
thinker, divinely wise, and compa- 
rable to Athena. For him, Heaven 
and Earth are of a perfect and silent 
beauty; the four seasons follow one 
another with a regular rhythm, with- 
out prescription; the ten thousand 
beings fulfil themselves tacitly, ac- 
cording to the order of things. 
This existence in itself, stripped 
of any form of logos, embodies the 
excellence of Heaven and Earth. It 
gives free rein to the creativity of the 
human soul and a generous recep- 
tion to the plurality of human talents 
and forms of intelligence. And the 
seeds of this perfect beauty, scat- 
tered across the planet, turn into the 
virtues of sincerity and truth, as well 
as aesthetic expression. Among 
man's inalienable rights there is, 
without doubt, the “right to aesthet- 
ic experience”, even If it appears in 
none of the declarations and laws 
(o00)

### 186721: The Beauty of the swan

THE BEAUTY OF THE SWAN 
  
(vee) 
(perhaps because it is considered 
to be implicit). The perfection of 
Heaven and Earth, from Antiquity to 
today, has been the open and inex- 
haustible source of beauty and the 
diversity of cultures in our world. 
Surpassing nature? 
A vanity 
In the Zhuangzi, Zhuang Zhou 
describes a people called the 
Hexu who, in ancient times, 
lived without cares, ate well and 
lounged on a full stomach, in the 
company of plants and animals. 
Our imagination prospers in the 
same way. From Plato to Owen, 
and from Thomas More to 
Saint-Simon and Fourier, 
man has thrived on marvel- 
lous dreams. Otherwise, 
humanity would not be what 
it is. If we had to renounce 
our dreams, sterility and 
dreariness is all that would 
remain, and our entire lives 
would be turned towards 
death. A sad state of affairs. 
Do you not think that 
UNESCO advocates cultur- 
al diversity precisely to open 
the way to inevitable univer- 
sal agreement? So that this 
many splendored culture re- 
tains its beauty for millions of 
years. 
“Return to origins” and “re- 
turn to nature” are two ex- 
pressions of the same idea. 
Culture has always drawn its 
inspiration from nature. Art 
and literature may try to imi- 
tate it, and the sciences may 
make their discoveries, but 
it is nothing but vanity to at- 
tempt to improve on nature. 
Technological progress, 
from a simple microphone 
to the aerospace industry, 
all comes back to a simple 
equation formulated by Max-

well in the 19th century. Yet Maxwell 
did not invent anything. Before him, 
and even before the Earth existed, 
this equation was already written 
somewhere in the universe. 
It is said that art and literature are 
endowed with divine power. But 
these are just the words of artists 
in need of consolation. In reality, 
and whatever artistic license might 
have us believe, humanity can only 
apply itself to tasks that match its 
capabilities, while even the slight- 
est movement of the universe can 
shake the planet with its majestic 
power. Hurricanes and tidal waves 
are just a taste of what nature can

deliver; and when its magnificence 
turns into terror, humanity appears 
very, very small. As Kant warns us: 
step back a little and the terrifying 
power of nature will become the 
object of aesthetic pleasure. But 
we do not necessarily need the ter- 
rifying force of nature to experience 
aesthetic pleasure — as this Cultural 
Diversity Day proves. 
Greed devours the soul 
In the far, distant past, in Antiquity 
and the classical era, humanity lived 
principally from agriculture and live- 
stock farming, it had faith in nature 
and was close to it. Man showed 
respect and affection for 
nature and was not arro- 
gant towards it. But indus- 
trialisation has increased 
his desires and, in the 
post-industrial era, greed 
is devouring his soul. 
In the early 20th century, 
in Britain and Germany, 
Toynbee and Spengler 
warned us of the risks of 
capitalism, which, alas, are 
being confirmed today. As 
these two eminent think- 
ers foresaw, technologi- 
cal progress goes hand in 
hand with gluttonous con- 
sumption, and the threat to 
our planet is growing day 
by day. 
If we look back with re- 
spect to early cultures, it 
Is because of their wis- 
dom, their elegance, their 
authenticity and their 
simplicity. They are an ex- 
pression of the purity of 
the souls of our forebears. 
Of course, they were later 
tainted with the colours of 
the sacred, but, to the ex- 
tent that religion fulfils its 
mission of providing com- 
fort to the human soul, it

THE BEAUTY OF THE SWA 
  
(eee) 
can, fundamentally, be considered 
an art. 
Cultures do not obey the evolution- 
ary principles of Darwin or Spencer. 
A recent work of art is not superior 
to an older work. The moments of 
awakening, the efforts to promote 
greater confidence and harmony, 
that humanity as a whole has shown 
on this day of multicultural exchang- 
es, will remain forever a moving and 
encouraging guiding light. 
“In any society, whether of ani- 
mals or of men, violence makes 
tyrants, while gentle authority 
makes kings: on Earth, the lion 
and the tiger, in the air, the eagle 
and the vulture, do not rule by war 
alone, they do not dominate by 
an abuse of power and cruelty; 
whereas the swan rules the water 
in all the ways that found an em- 
pire of peace: greatness, majesty, 
gentleness [...]" (Buffon, The Nat- 
ural History of Birds , Vol. IX, “The 
Swan") 
Let us pray together for peace and 
the greatest harmony among peo- 
ple, and may the swan preserve its 
noble beauty forever.

A SCHOLAR-PAINTER 
Master Fan Zeng was born in 1938 
in Nantong (China) and comes from a long line of 
scholars going back to the end of the 16th cen- 
tury. His great grandfather, 
Fan Dangshi, better known as Fan Bozi (1854- 
1905), was a celebrated poet 
at the end of the Qing dynasty. 
Fan Zeng is an internationally renowned painter 
and calligrapher and a respected poet and thinker. 
He is today considered to be a grand master of 
Chinese classical art. His work, which is in har- 
mony with nature, follows the tradition of “scholarly 
painting’, an artistic movement that developed in 
China from the 10th century. 
Fan Zeng is research director at the Chinese 
Academy of Arts and a professor 
at the University of Nankai in Tianjin. 
He was recently appointed advisor 
to UNESCO on cultural diversity..

CALLIGRAPHY, 
THE ART OF MAKING WORDS SING 
At UNESCO's International Festival of Cultural Diversity in May this year, Hassan Makaremi 
and the Chinese Grand Master Fan Zeng, gave a presentation entitled, “Dialogue on Calligraphy’ 
In this interview by Monique Couratier for the UNESCO Courier, he explains how the Persian 
Nas'taliq style of calligraphy has enabled him to put his ideals into colour and movement, 
in a personal quest that combines poetic intuition and scientific rigour.

What affinities do you share 
with Master Fan Zeng 
and how are you different? 
What Master Fan Zen and | share, 
above all, is our relationship to na- 
ture. We see the same things, and 
translate this through calligraphy. 
Don't forget that calligraphy is the 
art of stylizing the written word, 
which was invented by observing 
nature. In his inventory of visual 
forms, Marc Changizi, a researcher 
at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti- 
tute in Troy in the USA, demonstrat- 
ed some fifty elements that appear 
both in nature and in four families 
of script: cuneiform, hieroglyphics, 
Chinese and Maya. For both Master 
Fan Zeng and myself, calligraphy 
embodies our “being in the world". 
The UNESCO Courier 2009 N°5 
“From rock art to human rights”, painting by Hassan Makaremi. 
  
How do we differ? In our relation- 
ship to society. Chinese writing, 
which originated 4000 before the 
Christian era, remains deeply root- 
ed in nature. There is a direct link 
between rock art and Chinese char- 
acters, which have hardly changed 
in six thousand years. That is why, 
across the ages, the line of ink cast 
by the Chinese calligrapher’s brush 
continues, instantly, to take the form 
of a horse, ox or a tiger. It takes the 
skill of a Master to chant the rhythm 
of time. 
But Persian calligraphy has assim- 
lated a series of outside influences. 
| am thinking of the Arab-inspired 
kufi (angular and geometric) and 
naskh (supple and rounded) scripts, 
abandoned in the 14th century, as 
7 
the art moved closer to nature, from 
which it derived the gentle curves so 
typical of the nas'taliq style, which 
inspires my own work. To give you 
an example, in this script, the egg 
is symbolized by a voluptuous loop 
that seems to take flight, light as an 
eyelash. 
This slow progression towards 
other visions — Mongolian, Arab, 
Turkish, Indian, etc. — which are 
reflected in body language and 
therefore also in the gestures of 
the calligrapher, means that Persian 
calligraphy also has a stylized view 
of [what French psychoanalyst, 
Jacques Lacan called] the “speak- 
ing being”, this “desiring being” that 
lives in the metropolis. Chinese cal- 
ligraphy, on the other hand, remains 
confined to nature, which it distils or 
sublimates. Why is this? | am not a 
specialist of far-eastern philosophy, 
but | think the explanation may be 
found in the notion of detachment 
with respect to desire, as advocat- 
ed by Buddhism. 
Your encounter with Master Fan 
Zen is more than simply the 
sum of your similarities and 
dissimilarities. Do you have 
the impression of having 
established a genuine dialogue? 
The very fact that we are present, 
side-by-side, is a form of dialogue 
— a dialogue between what is 
common to both of us, and what

separates us. So what is the fruit 
of this dialogue? No less than life 
itself! Our commitment to use our 
brush to trace the curve of the uni- 
verse is a message, which says 
that humanity, in all its diversity, is 
nevertheless one. 
If | often use the tree as a meta- 
phor, it is because humanity has 
common roots, which give it a 
unity, thousands of branches that 
provide its diversity (its people, 
who are both so different and 
yet so intermixed) and countless 
leaves, the undulating products 
of its creative genius. Without 
its roots, firmly anchored in the 
ground, without its branches - 
even if some die while others 
flourish — without its leaves, con- 
tinually “started afresh”, the tree 
could not survive, 
And you might say, what about 
violence? It arises from the fact 
that certain peoples or individuals

think that they exist apart from ev- 
erything else, outside this common 
“décor” of our humanity. But, with- 
out the sentiment of belonging to 
the same species and without the 
recognition of diversity, humanity 
could not continue to survive. This 
is the message of our exchange 
between Chinese and Persian cal- 
ligraphy. This is also the message 
of the United Nations, whose New 
York headquarters has a poem by 
the illustrious Persian poet, Sa'adi 
[see box] inscribed over the en- 
trance to its Hall of Nations, and 
of UNESCO, with which | would 
be honoured to continue my col- 
laboration to promote “cultural di- 
versity in dialogue”. 
Why has calligraphy 
not flourished in the West? 
What can it give us today? 
In the West, since the 16th cen- 
tury, the choice has been made to

opt for rapidity and efficacy, nota- 
bly by trying to gain mastery over 
nature. In the East, the preference 
has been to “tell it" to “write it", in its 
fullness and looseness, in its curves 
and silences, by leaving the space 
for interpretation, for freedom ... 
Far from my training as a scien- 
tist, there is this idea of renounc- 
ing rigour, clarity and concision. 
But | know that the computer 
keyboard will never replace the 
hand. And | reckon that, today, 
calligraphy represents added 
value. In a motion that is in har- 
mony with nature, like a whirling 
Dervish, the gesture of the cal- 
ligrapher-philosopher-poet turns 
the words of the Universe into 
song. That is nas'taliq calligraphy: 
the alchemy of life!

OF A FAMILIAR STRANGER 
As part of the UNESCO World Cultural Diversity Festival, in May this year, Shigeru Asano 
exhibited his work at the Town Hall in the first arrondissement of Paris. He has generously 
allowed us to reproduce a selection here (© Shigeru Asano). 
higeru Asano’s photographs, like 
shimmering skylights, only give a 
1 partial glimpse of reality - no more 
“than a tiny puddle of water on a 
pavement can hold. Shigeru Asano 
is not the only photographer to be 
fascinated by reflection, but he is 
surely one of the very few to have 
used it as an aesthetic principle. 
These reflections stay surprisingly 
sharp, even when the wind whips 
up a strip of blur, or water forms a 
frame of shadow. In any case, the 
reflection is the only perceptible re- 
ality in his images. 
“People sometimes come up to 
me and ask if | am feeling all right, 
he says. “They are concerned when 
they see someone crouching in the 
rain under an umbrella, trying to stay 
dry. They don't see that this man is

trying to set up his camera on a 
tripod, aiming his lens a couple of 
centimetres from the ground. They 
can't imagine that he has spent 
months, even years, visualizing the 
photo he is about to take; or that he 
might use up thirty films before he 
gets the photo he has seen in his 
mind's eye 
This gives an idea of how impor- 
tant time is in Shigeru Asano’s 
approach as an artist. He avoids 
digital technology because he is 
not interested in the instantaneous. 
“With film, you have to wait ... and 
then the moment of truth comes - 
success or failure? Sometimes, 
when the film is developing, no im- 
age appears. Everything is black. 
So, | have to start again. It is like a 
perpetual struggle with the image. 
9 
It is very motivating” In eight years, 
since he started his “puddles” proj- 
ect, Shigeru Asano has made only 
60 photos he is satisfied with. 
At the opposite end of the spec- 
trum to his compatriot Nobuyoshi 
Araki, Shigeru Asano creates a par- 
allel universe, woven with illusions 
and dreams. He counters violence 
with lyricism; uproar with silence; 
the crowd with solitude. His Paris 
is almost empty of people. “No it 
isn't; he protests. “Look, there's a 
man." And, it's true, a few rare sil- 
houettes do cross the black and 
white scenes that Shigeru Asano 
composes on the Pentax 6x7 that 
accompanies him everywhere. But 
they are always alone. “For me, 
these photos are like a mirror”, he 
finally admits.

And the photographer tells of his 
solitude. He lost his mother at the 
age of fourteen. He never knew his 
father. He has no brothers or sis- 
ter, and no children of his own. “At 
least, not for the moment,’ he adds. 
In 1971 he moved to Tokyo to study 
design. Five years later he came to 
Paris on a short trip and returned 
in 1979 to live. In his first ten years, 
he turned his hand to everything —

TRAVELLING MUSIC 
his summer, the fourth Green Pas- 
tures Festival in Rize (Turkey) will 
be featuring foreign musicians - 
from France. But not the France of 
the tourist brochures and embassy 
"crusades that have taken over the 
Turkish media in recent years. They 
come from that other France, home 
to lovers of traditional music. A 
France that is trying to mend the 
fabric of a society torn apart by 
years of rural exodus. 
The effects of urbanization, indus- 
trialization and celebrity culture are 
being felt in Turkey, just as they are 
in France. The art of song is being 
drowned out by excessive technol- 
ogy, the glitter of globalization and 
the glamour of stardom. But both 
countries have managed to pre- 
serve a few islands of authenticity, 
like Brittany, in the extreme west of 
France, on the Atlantic coast, and 
the province of Rize, in the far north- 
east of Anatolia, on the edge of the 
Caucasus. 
The UNESCO Courier 2009 N°5 
The Breton 
renaissance 
Over the past fifty years, in France, 
Bretons have started to revive 
their traditional music, dances and 
festivals. Cut off from its past by 
urbanization, the new generation 
has been exploring its ancestral 
heritage. The trend started in parts 
of the region where Breton is spo- 
ken, and is now turning to another 
linguistic area, Gallo, which is 
closer to French. Meanwhile, the- 
ory and practice have evolved. 
In the past, “revivalism” was the 
preserve of researchers, whose 
principal goal was to collect, 
analyze, understand and publish. 
Today, as ethnomusicologist, 
Yves Defrance, points out, while 
continuing in this tradition, song 
and dance collectors also “want 
to claim back this repertoire and 
bring it up to date, without altering 
its character, turning it into a con- 
temporary means of expression.” 
11 
Gallo songs were in danger of 
being forgotten, unable to find a 
place in today’s world. But with the 
renewal of interest they are leav- 
ing the archives, and are no longer 
esoteric party pieces, brought out 
on special occasions for a hand- 
ful of culture buffs. Every day, new 
songs are re-emerging in annual 
contests, local gatherings in homes 
and cafes, village festivals, outings, 
schools and in music workshops 
in small villages and market towns. 
And, at the same time, in rural ar- 
eas, young and old, those in work 
and the unemployed, both men and 
women, are renewing social bonds 
thanks to this revival of singing. 
Amongthe singers travelling to Rize 
this year are some of those spear- 
heading this renaissance. Some, 
like Charles Quimbert or Vincent 
Morel, come from the community of 
song collectors: they have univer- 
sity degrees and work at DASTUM,

In 1996 they launched the “Festival 
of Traditional Song", held in Bovel, 
a little market town near Rennes in 
Brittany, featuring folksongs from 
Brittany and elsewhere. Others, 
who have grown up with traditional 
song, are veritable living treasures - 
villagers who still carry and pass on 
local history. 
It was torrential rain that brought 
them together, in the summer of 
1997. The festival-goers were start- 
ing out on a hike in the countryside, 
singing as they walked, when a 
sudden downpour sent them scur- 
rying to Bovel's only cafe. Here, 
they came across the generation of 
“Masters of the Tradition”, gathered 
around the café's owners, Léone 
and Louis Bernier. For them the 
festival “was for young people!” But 
when these ‘young people’ started 
to sing, they recognized their own 
songs. Since then, this little café 
has become the symbol of recon- 
ciliation between the generations. 
On the first Friday of every month, 
the café plays host to local school- 
children, teenagers, teachers and a 
crowd of others from the region - 
and even Paris — who come to stay 
up all night singing. 
Songs of every colour 
and flavour 
In Turkey, the first signs of a return 
to the homeland, in song, came 
from Birol Topaloglu, someone else 
in search of his roots. Combined, in 
his case, with a strong ecological 
awareness. As in other regions of 
the country, the very banks of Ana- 
tolia’s overburdened rivers, flowing 
heavily towards the Black Sea, are 
in danger of disappearing if planned 
dams are built. Meanwhile, these 
lands are gradually being deserted 
by country folk looking for the prom- 
ise of an easier life in town. 
Once, community songs and 
dances echoed out in the magnifi- 
cent wood and stone houses. Little 
by little they have fallen silent. So,

simultaneously preserving cultural

has made abroad. 
In Storm Valley, where white 
minarets rise above the luxuriant 
green slopes of Rize, the annual 
August Festival is aimed at every- 
one. As in Bovel, it hopes to bring 
together young and old, those 
who have left and those who 
stayed behind. Songs are on of-

dancing, walking, or eating. But, 
out of respect for tradition, folk-

### 186727: The Warrior monks of the young wood

THE WARRIOR MONKS 
OF THE YOUNG WOOD 
As part of the UNESCO International Festival of Cultural Diversity 
held in May this year, a delegation of monks from the temple 
of Shaolin (which means ‘young wood’) came to Paris to promote 
the cultural and spiritual values of Kung Fu. One of them, 
Abbot Shi Yongxin, explained to our colleague Weiny Cauhape, 
how the Shaolin temple is the product of cultural exchanges 
and why it is important to preserve the activities 
that have made it a sanctuary for the Chinese soul. 
| 
  
Shaolin kung fu is both a martial art and a spiritual quest. 
What were the origins 
of the Shaolin temple 
and how did it develop? 
In the year 495, Emporer Xiao Wen 
of the Northern Wei dynasty built the 
Shaolin temple on Mount Song, in 
homage to the Indian monk, Ba Tuo 
After that, two other Indian monks, 
Ratnamati and Bodhiruci, arrived in 
Shaolin and founded centres there for 
the translation of Buddhist scriptures, 
placing the temple at the very centre 
of Chinese Buddhism at the time. 
Later, the Indian monk Bodhidharma 
settled there and, claiming to “trace 
his lineage back to the Buddha him- 
self! placed the following thought at 
the very core of his teaching: “Chan 
goes straight to the heart of the mat- 
The UNESCO Courier 2009 N°5 
ter; know thy true nature and become 
a Buddha He founded the Chan 
school, in the temple itself. It is a 
school of Buddhism that adapted to 
the Chinese way of thinking, as Bud- 
dhism spread. [lt became known as 
Zen in Japan. Ed]. 
Today, Shaolin has become the sym- 
bol not just of Chinese Buddhism, but 
also of traditional Chinese culture. 
What is the origin of Kung Fu 
and what is its relationship 
to Buddhism? 
As an Imperial temple, Shaolin pos- 
sessed considerable wealth. But, dur- 
ing the final years of the Sui dynasty 
(581-681), the country suffered con- 
siderably from successive wars. So, 
13 
some of the monks learned to practice 
martial arts to defend the Temple and 
its treasures. 
Shaolin Kung Fu is nothing other 
than the path that the Shaolin monks 
followed to attain wisdom and a deep 
understanding of the Buddhist way of 
life, or “ch’an’”. It is a means to meditate 
on ch’an, by practising martial arts and 
letting the chan serve as a guide. 
“Shaolin Temple” schools and as- 
sociations seem to be opening up 
everywhere in the world. What can 
be done to protect the secular values 
of Shaolin Kung Fu in the face of this 
phenomenon? 
It is true that there are many estab- 
lishments that teach Shaolin martial 
arts across the world. Some have 
been set up by the Mount Song Shao- 
lin Temple, while others have received 
our authorisation after passing an ex- 
amination. But most of these “Shaolin 
Martial Arts Centres” have just sprung 
up on their own. 
As | have not visited most of these 
establishments, | cannot pass judge- 
ment on them. But one thing is cer- 
tain: we are opposed to any abuse 
of the name of our temple that might 
undermine its traditions. 
We work tirelessly to protect the cul- 
tural heritage of Shaolin. We have set 
up a special organization to regulate 
the use of the name “Shaolin Temple” 
and have applied to UNESCO for in- 
clusion on its intangible heritage list. 
Inclusion would enable us to take le- 
gal action, to collect and archive docu- 
ments, and therefore to help guarantee 
the living transmission of this secular 
art. The rules of transmission of the 
knowledge and practices of Kung Fu 
from one generation to another have 
been strictly controlled since the 13th 
century. They were laid down by Ab- 
bot Fu Yu. Since then, some 70 gen- 
erations of masters have been trained 
at Shaolin.

to address a letter to “Jim Thomson, 
Bangkok”, and it would reach him, 
out of the three million inhabitants 
of the Thai capital 
In the twenty years before his fa- 
tal trip to Malaysia, Jim Thomson 
achieved what others had been 
unable to in an entire life. Special- 
izing in an art that he knew nothing 
about, he created a vast silk indus- 
try in Thailand. His house in 
Bangkok, itself a work of art, 
is filled with art treasures 
from the region. 
His life story reads like a 
novel, not just for his per- 
sonal accomplishments, but 
for the thousands of lives 
he changed. The name Jim 
Thompson is, today, synony- 
mous with a booming Thai 
industry, known the world 
over, whose silk products 
fill the windows of leading 
stores and grace the best 
hotels and restaurants ev- 
erywhere. 
Bangkok silk 
Jim Thompson trained as 
an architect, discovering 
Thailand in 1945 when he 
was posted there as an of- 
ficer in the US army. At that 
time there were few modern 
buildings or cars in Bangkok, 
and the canals still played a 
major role. Attracted by the 
markets and the smiling 
14 
people, he decided to settle there 
when he was demobilized. 
As soon as he arrived in the coun- 
try, Thompson began collecting 
pieces of Thai silk. He was seduced 
by the surprising combinations of 
colours and the uneven texture, 
which distinguish Thai silk from the 
softer Chinese or Japanese silk. The 
difference comes from the quality of 
the silk worms themselves. 
A Chinese diplomat recorded the 
Siamese tradition of growing mul- 
berry trees and breeding silk worms 
as far back as the 13th century. But 
it was the American architect who 
gave Thai silk its pedigree. When he 
settled in Bangkok, weavers were 
few and far between - the tradition 
was only being kept alive by a hand- 
ful of Muslims in the Benkrua quar- 
ter. Thompson decided to market 
Thai silk and contacted them. Most 
were suspicious, but one head of 
family was intrigued, and decided 
to go into business with him. It was 
the start of a great adventure. 
In 1947 Thompson left on a flight 
for New York, his suitcase stuffed 
with samples of silk. A fashion edi- 
tor fell in love with the cloth samples 
and offered her backing straight 
away. Back in Thailand, he set up 
a company, becoming its director 
and holding the majority of shares. 
His management style was original, 
employing mostly women, and al- 
lowing them to work from home, so 
as not to disrupt their family life. He

introduced innovations in manufac- 
turing techniques and replaced the 
old plant-based dyes with chemical 
colours, while respecting the tradi- 
tional colours of Thai silk. 
In the early 1950's Thompson 
opened a store in Bangkok, which 
was immediately a huge success. 
Soon after, he received a visit from 
Queen Sirikit, who was a tireless 
promoter of Thai crafts and cultural 
heritage. She became his most fa- 
mous and influential client. On her 
official trips abroad, she would wear 
outfits made of traditional Thai silk, 
and did not fail to be noticed by the 
celebrated French couturier, Pierre 
Balmain. On the other side of the 
Atlantic, Irene Sharaff, costume de- 
signer for the musical comedy, The 
King and | by Walter Lang, decided 
to use Thai silk, the first of a whole 
series of films that helped spread 
its fame. Orders flooded in from all 
corners of the world. 
Maintaining tradition 
From the 1970's, silk manufactur- 
ing became established in the prov- 
ince of Khorat, in the north-east of 
Thailand. It was while touring this 
hot and poor region of farmers that 
Queen Sirikit realized how difficult 
life was for the peasants there and 
offered to help them turn to silk 
weaving and traditional dying. In 
1976, the queen set up the SUP- 
PORT foundation, which aims to 
develop craft activities in rural areas 
and to preserve ancient production 
techniques. Now, about a thousand 
families have their own mulberry 
plantations and breed their own silk 
worms. The cocoons, which take 
23 days to mature, are then sold to 
Jim Thompson's farm. 
Nowadays, weaving, which is the 
central step in the process of silk- 
making, is carried out by about 600 
weavers, both men and women, 
who continue to pass their skills on 
from generation to generation. The 
cloth is printed using both wooden 
stencils and digital printers, recon- 
ciling traditional and modern prac- 
tices. Great emphasis is placed on 
quality control and hand finishing,

The American businessman's vi-

great Thai silk adventure would 
bring prosperity to the country. To- 
day, 90% of shareholders in Jim

Despite industrialization, making Thai silk 
depends to a large extent on the nimble fingers 
of peasants and women workers. 
What do champagne and silk have 
in common? An aura of charm, a long 
history, a close link to their land of origin, 
strict rules of manufacture and ... coun- 
terfeits. 
French champagne is protected by a 
whole series of laws, which come under 
the collective title of the “Champagne 
Code’, which precisely defines its origin 
and methods of production. But the 
Inter-professional Champagne Commit- 
tee has to fight tooth and nail to avoid 
its Geographic Indication* being used 
illegally. The organization, which dates 
back to 1930 and the Commission for 
Propaganda and Defence of the Wines 
of Champagne, has to ensure that no 
sparkling wine anywhere in the world can 
benefit from this name. It is a difficult task, 
because the prestigious name of “Cham- 
pagne” is a superb sales feature and is 
therefore very attractive to counterfeiters. 
Meanwhile, the relatively young Thai 
Institute of Sericulture, established in 
2002, aims to obtain legal recognition of 
the Geographic Indication of Lamphun 
province as producer of traditional Thai 
silk. The renowned Lamphun silk bro- 
cade, traditionally woven on handlooms

Thai silk is the queen of silks - this 
could be the motto of a new partnership 
between the Inter-professional

Sirikit Institute for Sericulture 
(Thailand). Both are powerful symbols 
of their respective countries, yet, both 
are also victims of their own success - 
counterfeiting and misappropriation 
of the name are the major threats that 
this partnership hopes to defeat. 
nation of silk thread and gold and silver 
thread, is much sought after by leading 
couturiers and interior designers through- 
out the world. 
Despite its industrialization, Thai silk 
making still depends to a large extent 
on the nimble fingers of peasants. Silk 
farming and unwinding the silk, thread 
by thread from the cocoons are still the 
preserve of a myriad of small producers. 
And most of the weaving workshops that 
buy the silk thread still use wooden looms 
and other traditional techniques. 
In 2007, the Champagne Committee 
responded positively to an invitation 
from the Queen Sirikit Institute to form 
a partnership and has since become 
an advocate for Thai silk. Thanks to its 
support, the Geographic Indication (Gl) 
of Lamphun silk is in the process of be- 
ing registered with the European Union. 
This collaboration, it is hoped, will draw 
the public's attention to the notion of 
Geographic Indication and help preserve 
the authenticity of these products, which 
have become icons of French and Thai 
culture.

control and a largely untapped reserve of vital 
resources, they deserve to be managed better. This

is why the United Nations has decided to celebrate 
the first ever World Ocean Day on the 8th of June. 
‘hen the ocean makes the 
headlines, the news usu- 
ally concerns a threat to 
biodiversity, a crisis in the 
fishing industry or an oil- 
spill accident. These are important is- 
sues, but are only part of the much bigger 
story that needs telling. 
As our understanding of the climate 
system improves, we realize the com- 
plex yet essential role of the ocean plays 
in its regulation. Because of its capacity 
to store heat, the ocean is not only the 
engine of weather but also the memory 
of climate. Life on earth originated in the 
margins of the primordial ocean and for 
millions of years evolved in this aquatic 
milieu. The ocean is the ultimate global 
commons providing essential ecological 
services that make life possible on our 
planet. Humankind has strong funda- 
mental reasons to revere the ocean, as 
ancient civilizations intuitively did. 
But our everyday behavior falls far short 
from this serene ideal. As the current 
piracy crisis has revealed - and despite 
the 1982 United Nations Convention of 
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) - there 
are many gaps in the governance in this 
unique international space. UNCLOS 
provides an integrated legal framework 
on which to build sound and effective 
regulations to the different uses of the 
ocean, which have been implemented 
by the UN specialized agencies and 
programs over the last 30 years. Nev- 
ertheless, severe limitations exist for

monitoring and enforcing these regula- 
tions. National and international institu- 
tions are fundamentally weak. They are 
usually compartmentalized on a sector 
by sector division of duties and respon- 
sibilities, leaving little room for integrated 
policy-making addressing issues that cut 
across several domains. 
Thus, despite progress, many major 
challenges remain to be addressed. Reg- 
ulation of High Seas or trans-zonal fisher- 
ies is one of them. There is also increas- 
ing concern that many fisheries practices 
are unsustainable and that global fisher- 
ies generally are facing a major crisis. 
Major challenges 
Unsustainable uses are posing a dan- 
ger to many special habitats as well, es- 
pecially in the coastal environment and 
including mangroves, estuaries, coral- 
reefs and underwater mountains, which 
are hot-spots of marine biodiversity. The 
illegal traffic of people, arms and drugs 
via the High Seas is increasing. 
Absorbing millions of tons of CO2 every 
year - one third of total annual emissions 
- the ocean has already spared us from 
catastrophic climate change. But in doing 
so, its own intrinsic balances are being 
altered: it is becoming more acidic and 
has taken the largest fraction of the addi- 
tional heat generated by climate change, 
something that might eventually alter the 
normal patterns of ocean circulation that 
are so essential for keeping CO2 out of 
contact from the atmosphere.

The world's largest coral complex is under threat of disappearing. 
Because of these alarming trends, the 
World Summit on Sustainable Develop- 
mentin 2002 decided to keep the oceans 
under permanent review via global and 
integrated assessments of the state of 
the seas. This is the most comprehensive 
initiative undertaken by the UN system 
yet to improve Ocean Governance. In 
2005 the UN General Assembly through 
resolution 60/30, requested UNESCO's 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Com:- 
mission and the United Nations Environ- 
ment Programme (UNEP) to take the 
lead in getting this process started. The 
report of three years of work is ready and 
has been distributed to the United Na- 
tions Member States and the general 
public. Later this year, in the emblematic 
UN Headquarters building in New York, a 
Working Group of the whole composed 
by all members of the UN will consider 
this report and propose a course of ac- 
tion to the 64th Session of the General 
Assembly. A positive endorsement will 
open the way for the first Global Integrat- 
ed Assessment of the Ocean to be con- 
ducted by the UN system for 2014-15, 
the two years when the Commission on 
Sustainable Development will conduct 
a review of oceans and coastal issues. 
Given the high stakes, failure to do so is 
not an acceptable option.

Executive Secretary of the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission (IOC), UNESCO.
