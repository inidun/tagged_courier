THE PROMISE OF 
ATOMIC POWER 
 
 
Looking into the future at a scale model of an 
atomic power plant, Scientists consider that 
the world's tremendous need for increased 
power can be met by such plants, using atomic 
fuel converted from the world’s reserve of 
uranium. This reserve Is many times the 
energy equivalent of the world reserve of 
coal and oil. (Photo USIS). 
I | OR almost ten years the atom has shown an evil face. 
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations in 
November, it began to show a happier one. 
By one of the tragic accidents of history, the discovery 
that enormous energy is released when a uranium atom is 
split by a neutron came in 1939, just before the outbreak of 
the greatest war in history. It was at once used to create 
the horrendous succession of bombs which ended that war 
and have now made another war almost unthinkable. But 
it is the bomb that brings death and destruction, not the 
atom. In better times and in wiser hands the energy of the 
atom can do far more good than the harm the bomb has 
done. Today there is great hope that a better time is at 
harfd and that the atom will become a benefactor of humanity. 
The use of atomic energy to do the world’s work has long 
been the dream of scientists. The measure of man’s progress 
in civilization has been his increased use of energy. But we 
still have far to go. A new source of energy that can be used 
at any place on earth would benefit the non-industrialized 
nations at once and would enable them to develop now the 
coal-free and oil-free economy that all nations must sooner 
or later adopt. 
This is the promise of atomic energy. One pound of ura- 
. nium fuel can provide as much energy as 1,300 tons of coal, 
yet the coal weighs nearly three million times as much. 
Furthermore, atomic fuels have precious by-products in the 
radio-active materials, called isotopes, that are produced in 
the atomic furnaces. They will almost certainly benefit 
mankind as much as will the use of atomic energy itself. 
Knowing all these possibilities, scientists the world over 
have been dismayed at the restriction of atomic materials to 
military use. They expected to avoid further development of 
atomic weapons and to stimulate the peaceful uses of atomic 
energy for all the world. Nationalism and international 
tensions made this impossible. 
But a new start now has been made. A proposal was 
made by President Eisenhower to the United Nations General 
Assembly on December 8, 1953, for international co-operation 
in the peaceful development of atomic energy and atomic 
materials. Suddenly the great hopes of long ago were 
revived by the unanimous adoption of this proposal by the 
Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly 
on November 23, 1954, and by the General Assembly itself, 
also unanimously, on December 4. This makes certain one 
great advance : international co-operation in atomic deve- 
lopment under the United Nations. It makes possible 
another, equally great : the full use of the atom for the 
good of mankind, 
This may be a turning point in history. The prospect 
needs careful study. It is not a problem for scientists and 
statesmen alone. In a democratic world an understanding 
of the atom and its possibilities is necessary for every 
literate and thinking person. It will no doubt be quickly 
introduced into the schools. But it must also be introduced 
into public discussions. ] 
The UNEsco COURIER, as Unesco’s medium of public 
information and education, devoted its December issue a year 
ago largely to an exposition of the fundamental sciences of 
atomic energy. Now, with the assurance of international 
action by the United Nations and by Unesco toward the 
practical use of atomic power and atomic materials, this 
entire issue is devoted to a realistic examination of the facts, 
the possibilities, and the prospective consequences of the 
beneficent atom.

### 70465: A Turning point

A TURNING POINT 
By Gerald 
HE unanimous vote of the 
General Assembly of the Unifed 
Nations on December 4, 1954, for 
the setting up of an international 
atomic energy agency and for a 
United Nations conference on the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy was 
hailed in countries all around the 
world. 
The problem of making the full use 
of the atom for the good of mankind 
is not one for scientists and statesmen 
alone. Every thinking and literate 
person should have an understanding 
of the atom and its possibilities. Men 
and women everywhere should un- 
derstand the implications of the U.N. 
decision, and they should welcome it 
with enthusiasm. The reasons, plain 
to see, are these: 
After the years of fixation on 
« weapons and on the chill fear 
of destruction, the dark skies broke 
and a beam of sunshine brought hope, 
if not a promise, of better times to 
come, The evil spell of the.atom was 
cast off by honest plans for peace and 
ktenefits to humanity from the great 
new resource that science had 
created. It brought a relief from war 
talk, if not an end to it. 
It was a unanimous vote for 
« a unanimous benefit. It meant 
that all the member states would pro- 
fit together, large and small, east and 
west, industrial and agricultural, rich 
and poor. And it meant that the 
United Nations is a force in being 
which can seize upon a great vision 
and can act to give it reality. For - 
once it was not merely a nation or a 
power-group but the whole organized 
world that agreed to co-operate in 
exploring a new road to human 
welfare. 
It is a road that will eventually 
¢ lead fo a large increase in use- 
ful energy, in power to do the world’s 
work. And energy creates material 
wealth and replaces hard human 
labour by leisure and well-being. 
Just as surely, the by-products 
+ of the atomic furnaces, the ra- 
dio-isotopes, are instruments for the 
exploration of nature as powerful as 
* were the microscope and the telescope 
in their early days. Especially in the 
revelation of the deep secrets of the 
life processes, they will bring a new 
era in science and therefore in human 
living. 
In order to achieve these bene- 
: fits in the nations that are not 
now active in the study and produc- 
tion of atomic energy, a major in- 
crease in educational facilities will be 
needed. They must be provided in 
advance. The production of atomic 
energy on a large scale demands 
not only highly specialized nuclear 
physicists and chemists but also 
thousands of engineers, electrical, 
4 
Wendt * 
civil and mechanical, and many more 
skilled workmen to operate and 
maintain the reactors, the electrical 
generators, the entire electrical dis- 
tribution system and the myriad 
motors and electrical machines that 
will use the energy. Furtherniore, in 
order to use radio-isotopes as a 
research tool, there will need to be 
scientific laboratories, especially in 
the biological and medical sciences, 
and training schools for the use of the 
new techniques in nearly all the 
research sciences and in industrial 
research. Indeed, in order to provide 
training at these levels, the nations 
who expect to participate will-need a 
broad programme of improved se- 
condary education, including 'the 
provision of modern laboratories and 
teaching methods in the secondary 
schools. If the atomic energy pro- 
gramme serves as an incentive to 
stimulate such programmes of scien- 
tific education in the countries that 
do not now have them, this in itself- 
will constitute a benefit, quite apart 
from the direct benefits from the use 
of atomic: energy. 
Finally, the availability of 
«+ ample energy, especially in 
lands where power -has been scarce 
and industry therefore weak, will 
bring a social revolution comparable 
with the industrial revolution of a 
century and a half ago. The advan- 
ces in agriculture, nutrition, medicine 
and health will alone cause rapid so- 
cial changes, even in the industrial 
countries. The world has in the past 
let such revolutions develop un- 
foreseen, often with disastrous con- 
sequences as well as benefits, This 
time we can see it coming. This time 
many a people will leap from the age 
of bullock-power to the atomic age. 
If the prospect is breathtaking, it is 
also an inspiring challenge to the 
educators, social scientists, national 
planners and governments. 
It is because benefits from the in- 
ternational development of atomic 
energy are so incalculable and 
because the pace af which these 
changes will proceed are dependent 
on so many factors that the whole 
international atomic project deserves 
study not only by the international 
conference that will be called by the 
United Nations in 1955, but by the 
informed public in every country. 
Much depends on the demand for 
energy in various couniries, on the 
cost of atomic power, on the location 
cf atomic reactors, and on the 
ability of each country to utilize the 
additional energy and the new 
knowledge. That is why the reasons 
given above for welcoming the U.N. 
decision are considered in the sub- 
sequent articles of this series.

### 70092: Let's use the atom for the good of mankind

HISTORIC PROPOSAL for international co-operation in the peaceful 
development of atomic energy and atomic materials was made by 
President Eisenhower to the United Nations General Assembly, on 
December 8, 1953. (Photos, above and inset, show President Eisen- 
hower addressing the General Assembly. Seated behind him are, 
left to right: Mr, Dag Hammarskjold, Secretary-General of the United 
World War II in 1945, the power 
of the atom seemed too great 
for human wisdom. Developed under 
military necessity and regarded in a 
time of tension as the supreme weapon, 
it forced its sponsors into rivalry and 
secrecy. Persistent efforts to abolish 
its military use failed for lack of 
mutual trust between the nations 
involved. Instead, its power grew 
under the fierce competition and mul- 
tiplied a thousandfold until, if it were 
now used in war, the entire human race 
would suffer and perhaps perish. 
Meanwhile, any wide use of that great 
power for the peaceful work of the 
world has been impossible because 
relaxation of secrecy also requires in- 
ternational control based on mutual 
trust. So the world stood still while 
the evil grew. 
D URING the years since the end of 
Door to the future 
sident of the United States ad- 
dressed the General Assembly of 
the United Nations and opened a new 
door to the future. He said in part: 
“The United States knows that if 
the fearful trend of atomic military 
build-up can be reversed, this great- 
T HEN, on December 8, 1953, the Pre- 
est of destructive forces can be deve- 
loped into a great boon, for the benefit 
of all mankind. The United States 
knows that peaceful power from atomic 
energy is no dream of the future. 
That capability, already proved, is 
here—now—today. Who can, doubt, if 
the entire body of the world’s scientists 
and engineers had adequate amounts 
of fissionable material with which to 
test and develop their ideas, that this 
capability would rapidly be transformed 
into universal, efficient, and economic 
usage? 
“To hasten the day when fear of the 
atom will begin to disappear from the 
minds of the peoples and the govern- 
ments of the East and West, there are 
certain steps that can be taken now. 
“I therefore make the following pro- 
posal: 
“The governments principally involv- 
ed, to the extent permitted by elemen- 
tary prudence, to begin now and conti- 
nue to make joint contributions from 
their stockpiles of normal uranium 
and fissionable materials to an inter- 
national atomic energy agency. We 
would expect that such an agency 
would be set up under the aegis of the 
United Nations... 
“Undoubtedly, initial and early 
contributions to this plan would be

Nations; Madame Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, of India, President of the 
General Assembly at that time; and Mr. Andrew W, Cordier, Executive 
Assistant to the Secretary-General. Justunder a year later, on December 
4, 1954, the General Assembly unanimously voted for the establishment 
of an international atomic energy agency and for a United Nations 
conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. (U.N. photos) 
small in quantity. However, the pro- 
posal has the great virtue that it can 
be undertaken without irritations and 
mutual suspicions incident to any 
attempt to set up a completely accept- 
able system of world-wide inspection 
and control.” 
Protecting the ‘bank’ 
the President, “could be made 
responsible for impounding, 
storage, and protection of the contri- 
buted fissionable and other materials, 
The ingenuity of our scientists will 
provide special safe conditions under 
which such a bank of fissionable ma- 
terial could be made essentially im- 
mune to surprise seizure. 
“The more important responsibility 
of this atomic energy agency would be 
to devise methods whereby this fission- 
able material would be allowed to serve 
the peaceful pursuits of mankind. 
“Experts would be mobilized to apply 
atomic energy to the needs of agricul- 
ture, medicine, and other peaceful 
activities. A special purpose would be 
to provide abundant electrical energy

Pooling atomic 
knowledge (Cont'd) 
in the power-starved areas of the 
world. Thus the contributing powers 
would be dedicating some of their 
strength to serve the needs rather than 
the fears of the world. 
“The United States would be more 
than willing—it would be proud—to 
take up with others ‘principally involv- 
ed the development of plans whereby 
such peaceful use of atomic energy 
would be expedited. 
“Of those ‘principally involved’ the 
Soviet Union must, of course, be one. 
“I would be prepared to submit to 
the U.S. Congress, and with every 
expectation of approval, any such plan 
that would: 
First. — Encourage world-wide in- 
vestigation into the most effective 
peace-time uses of fissionable mate- 
rial. 
Second. — Begin to diminish the 
potential destructive power of the 
world’s stockpiles. 
Third. — Allow all peoples of all na- 
tions to see that, in this enlightened 
age, the great powers of the earth, 
both of the East and of the West, are 
interested in human aspirations, first 
and foremost, rather than in building 
up the armaments of war. 
Fourth. — Open up a new channel 
for peaceful discussion and initiate at 
least a new approach to the many 
difficult problems that must be solved 
in both private and public conferences 
if the world is to shake off the inertia 
imposed by fear and make positive 
progress toward peace. 
“Against the dark background of the 
atomic bomb, the United States does 
not wish merely to present strength, 
but also the desire and hope for 
peace.” 
A fearful dilemma 
His effort to help solve the fearful 
T atomic dilemma at once inspired 
new hope in the hearts of many 
nations. In the British House of Com- 
mons, Sir Winston Churchill said that 
he considered the speech as one of the 
most important events in world history 
since the war and referred to it as pos- 
sibly “a turning point in our destiny”. 
The speech was, however, but a first 
step and not a complete solution. In- 
deed, the Soviet delegate, the late 
Andrei Y. Vishinsky, soon pointed out 
  
      
      
that it did not mention banning of 
atomic weapons, would involve only a 
small part of the existing atomic ma- 
terials, and, in effect, merely transfer- 
red the discussion to a new aspect of 
the problem. But in most nations this 
was nevertheless considered a major 
step in advance. Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi 
Pandit of India, then President of the 
United Nations General Assembly, 
stated that “the proposal was of the 
highest importance and deserves the 
careful consideration of all the gov- 
ernments of the world. Itissomething 
my country welcomes.” 
Months of careful consideration by 
governments, scientists and leaders of 
thought raised no doubts as to the 
value of atomic energy in the peaceful 
ways of life. The questions related 
only to the other and deeper purpose 
of the proposal: the extent of interna- 
tional co-operation. Did it mean an 
Vv 
    
  
 
    
  
 
international “pool” of atomic mate- 
rials? If so, which nations would 
contribute and which receive? Did it 
mean that an international staff in an 
agency of the United Nations would be 
in charge of operations and research? 
If so, from which nations would they 
come and how would their expert secret 
knowledge be safeguarded? Above all, 
did the proposal imply any reduction 
of atomic armaments? 
This last point was the major ques- 
tion raised by the Soviet Government 
on December 21, 1953, in stating that 
its attitude was: “to turn this great 
discovery of the human mind not 
against civilization, but for its thor- 
ough progress; not for mass extermi- 
nation of people, but for their peaceful 
needs; for thorough safeguarding and 
raising the welfare of the population.” 
(Cont’d on page 8) 
ATOMIC POWER FOR PEACE is symbolized in the coat of arms adopted 
by Britain's newly created Atomic Energy 
Authority. Savage heraldic animals chained to the earth represent the power of 
the atom brought under control. The stars on each animal having a total of 92 po:nts, 
symbolize uramum—No. “92” in the list of chemical elements. Inverted triangle 
on the shield is a heraldic symbol called a “pile” the first name for an atomic reactor 
or power furnace. The zig-zag lines represent the electricity developed from 
atomic energy. On top of the helmet, which is a symbol of co-operation, a 
sun signifies the benign power of the atom. The bird inside is a sign taken from the 
crest of the late Lord Rutherford, one of the world’s most distinguished pioneers 
in nuclear research. The motto chosen by the Atomic Energy Authority, which 
forms part of this coat of arms, means : “The most from the smallest.”

ATOMIC POWERHOUSES 
A few months ago the Soviet authorities announced 
that the world’s first electric power station to make 
use of atomic energy had begun operating in the 
U.S.S.R. on June 27, 1954. The plant, with an output 
of 5,000 kilowatts, provides electricity for neighbour- 
ing industrial and agricultural installations. Soviet 
scientists and engineers, it was also stated, are working 
on the construction of other atomic power plants 
whose outputs range from 50,000 to 100,000 kilo- 
watts. Drawing on left, taken from * Teknika Molo- 
diep *', (a Russian popular science and technology 
magazine for young people) represents * one type 
of electric power station using nucl2ar energy. ” 
The key accompanying the drawing describes the 
different elements as follows : (1) atomic reactor 
(2) heat exchanger (3) steam condenser (4) main 
steam pipes (5) condenser pumps (6) turbo-generator 
(7) cooling towers (8) water cooling tank (9) transfor- 
mer station (10) pumping station (11) workshops 
(12) stores (13) administrative buildings, Other coun- 
tries, in parucular the United States, and Britain, 
have for some time past been working on projects 
to use heat provided by atomic reactors to generate 
electricity, On September 6, 1954, work was 
begun on a commercial atomic power plant in Pennsyl- 
vania that is expected to provide electricity for 
100,000 people. Artist's sketch (below) shows how 
two nuclear reactors might be used to produce elec- 
trical power from atomic energy. Such an arran- 
gement might be one of the applications leading from 
an experimental programme now underway in the 
United States. Atomic fission in reactors, (centre, 
and lower centre) would produce heat which would 
be transferred by liquid sodium through primary and 
secondary coolant systems to produce steam in the 
steam generators, (right). Steam would be used to 
power turbo-generators, (top) to produce electri- 
city. About 200,000 kilowatts of electricity could 
be generated. (Photo North American Aviation, Inc.)

The Soviet Government expressed its 
readiness to take:part in negotiations 
on the United States proposal but 
would expect that a proposal of its 
own would be considered at the same 
time, namely that:“ The States taking 
part in the agreement, guided by their 
wish for reducing international ten- 
sion, undertake solemn and uncondi- 
tional pledges not to use atomic, 
hydrogen or other weapons of mass 
extermination.” 
This disarmament proposal would 
return the discussion to the military 
area where no progress had been found 
possible in seven years and which the 
United States had tried to avoid. Thus 
sentiment grew in the United States to 
proceed without Soviet participation.

Mr. David Lilienthal, a private citi- 
zen but also the former chairman of 
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, 
for instance, suggested, late in Decem- 
ber, that there was no time to be lost, 
that a United Nations agency could 
have the plan in operation by August 
1954, preferably with Soviet participa- 
tion but, if necessary, without. 
He proposed that an experimental 
power plant be located at Brussels and” 
an international atomic research cen- 
tre at Geneva. He listed the possible 
participants as Great Britain and the 
United States, which have stocks of 
high-energy or “fissionable” materials; 
Canada, Belgium and Australia, which 
have large quantities of natural ura- 
nium; Brazil and India because they 
have large deposits of thorium which 
can also be converted into atomic fuel; 
Norway, Holland and France, which 
have a supply of radio-active materials 
for research and highly competent 
leaders in the atomic sciences. 
But private discussions between the 
U.S. and the Soviet Governments 
continued from January 2 until March 
19, 1954, when the U.S. proposals took 
a more definite form in a memorandum 
from the U.S. Secretary of State to the 
U.S.SR. Ambassador at Washington. 
They included: 
Formation of an international atomic 
energy agency “under the terms of a 
treaty among the participating nations” 
which would be financed by contribu- 
tions from the member states; its faci- 
lities would include storage of nuclear 
materials, control laboratories, admi- 
nistrative offices and such facilities 
“as might in time be necessary” for 
education and fraining, research and 
development, fuel fabrication and che- 
mical processing. 
Again the weeks passed until in April 
and early May, Soviet Foreign Minister 
Vyacheslav M. Molotov and U.S. Secre- 
tary of State John Foster Dulles 
conferred at Geneva and again failed 
to agree on the prohibition of atomic 
weapons as a preliminary to the estab- 
lishment of the atomic power agency. 
This question was then referred to a 
new sub-committee of the United Na- 
tions Disarmament Commission which 
met—without result—in London in 
May. This seemed to mark the end of 
President Eisenhower’s proposal to the 
United Nations as well as the failure 
of the Soviet effort for atomic disarm- 
ament. 
As a result, American thought turned 
again to the development of peace- 
ful atomic power without Soviet co- 
operation—and even without the United 
Nations. An emissary of the Atomic 
Energy Commission visited Brazil, Uru- 
guay, Peru and Chile in August to 
discuss the feasibility of small atomic 
power plants in those countries. 
On September 6, President Eisenhow- 
er participated in the start of con- 
struction on a commercial atomic power 
plant in Pennsylvania that is expected 
to provide electricity for 100,000 people. 
On this occasion he announced that 
the United States had agreed with “a 
number of other nations to go ahead 
now with the formation of an interna- 
tional agency which will foster the 
growth and spread of the new atomic 
  
technology for peaceful use... We hope 
that no nation will long stand aloof 
from the work of this agency.” 
The President mentioned negotia- 
tions to this end as beginning with Ca- 
nada and Belgium and the press re- 
ported that Britain, Australia, South 
Africa and France were also included. 
It was widely noted, however, that 
there had been no mention of the 
United Nations. Three days later, 
Admiral Lewis S. Strauss, Chairman of 
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, 
stated that the United States was 
preparing to call an international 
conference of nuclear scientists in 1955 
in which all interested countries, 
including the Soviet Union, would be 
invited to participate. 
But on September 23, Secretary Dulles 
again appealed to the United Nations 
General Assembly in these words: 
“The United States 1s determined

### 70092: Let's use the atom for the good of mankind

that President Eisenhower’s proposal 
shall not languish until it dies. We 
are determined that it shall be nurtur- 
ed and developed. And we shall press 
on in close partnership with those na- 
tions which, inspired by the ideals of 
the United Nations, can make this 
great new force a tool of humanitarian- 
ism and of statesmanship and not 
merely a fearsome addition to the ar- 
senal of war. 
“The United States is here proposing 
an agenda item which will enable us to 
report further on our efforts to explore 
and to develop the vast possibilities for 
the peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
These efforts have been and will be 
directed primarily toward the follow- 
ing ends: 
(1) The creation of an international 
agency, whose initial membership will 
include nations from all regions of the 
world. And it is hoped that such an 
agency will start its work as early as 
next year. 
(2) The calling of an international 
scientific conference to consider this 
whole vast subject, to meet in the 
spring of 1955, under the auspices of 
the United Nations. 
(3) The opening early next year, in 
the United States, of a reactor training 
school where 
students. from 
abroad may 
learn the 
working prin- 
ciples of atomic 
energy with 
specific regard to 
its peacetime 
uses. 
(4) The invi- 
tation to a 
substantial 
number of me- 
dical and sur- 
gical experts 
from abroad to 
participate in the 
work of our 
cancer hospitals 
in which atomic 
energy tech- 
niques are among 
the most hopeful 
approaches to 
controlling this 
menace to 
mankind, “I 
would like to 
make it perfectiy clear that our plann- 
ing excludes no nation from partici- 
pation in this great venture. As our 
proposals take shape, all nations inter- 
ested in participating and willing to 
take on the responsibilities of mem- 
bership will be welcome to join with 
us in the planning and the execution 
of this programme.” 
The response to the American 
proposal before the General Assembly 
was immediate and favourable. After 
almost ten months of delay, -during 
which the fear of the atom had grown 
throughout the world, the members of 
the Assembly showed eagerness to 
make a start in the opposite direction. 
On the following day, Mr. Vishinsky: 
expressed the approval of the Soviet 
Delegation for incorporating the Ame- 
rican statement in the agenda and 
asked for unanimous approval by the 
General Assembly in favour of studying 
the United States proposal. The report 
mentioned by Mr. Dulles was immedia- 
tely referred to the Political and Secur- 
ity Committee of the General Assem- 
bly. In a few days, a number of nations 
endorsed the U.S. proposal. 
 
Then, on October 1, a study of the 
proposal was begun by a special UN 
committee, headed by Dr. Ralph J. 
Bunche, who has been named as Un- 
der-Secretary of the U.N. Secretariat. 
At the same time, Mr. Henry Cabot 
Lodge, Jr., permanent U.S. represent- 
ative at the United Nations, said at a 
press conference that the United States 
would submit a resolution to the Gene- 
ral Assembly asking the United Nations 
to call a conference of scientists and 
others to settle the details of the new 
agency. He said that the United States 
would suggest that the entire pro- 
gramme be placed in the hands of a 
new agency similar to the World Health 
Organization, for instance, which would 
decide on its own relations with the 
United Nations. 
On November 5, Mr. Lodge addressed 
the Political and Security Committee 
to propose the organization of such an 
agency. A draft of the resolution was 
submitted jointly by Australia, Belgium, 
Canada, France, South Africa, Britain 
and the United States. The resolution 
suggested that a technical conference 
be held not later than August 1955 at a 
place to be selected by the Secretary- 
General and an advisory committee. 
On November 12, Mr. Vishinsky ad- 
dressed the Com- 
mittee and stat- 
ed that he would 
vote for the reso- 
lution provided 
the proposed in- 
ternational agen- 
cy were placed 
under the U.N. 
Security Council 
instead of having 
the separate 
status of a spe- 
cialized agency. 
This was on the 
ground that the 
production of 
atomic materials 
for peaceful pur- 
poses would in- 
crease theamount 
available for 
weapons and that 
the production 
of radio-isotopes 
would itself have 
military impor- 
tance. 
This Soviet pro- 
posal lead to further long discussions. 
Unexpected action by the United 
States on November 15 had the effect 
of bringing the discussion to a conclu- 
sion. On that day, Mr. Lodge told the 
Political and Security Committee that 
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission 
had allocated 100 kilogrammes (220 1bs) 
of fissionable material for use by the 
proposed international agency. This 
material could be used in a considerable 
number of small experimental atomic 
reactors, but it could not be put to use 
in the form of weapons. 
On the next day, Anthony Nutting, 
Head of the British Delegation to the 
General Assembly, announced that the 
British Government would hold avail- 
able 20 kilogrammes (44 pounds) to be 
used by the international agency as 
fuel in experimental atomic reactors. 
The composition of the advisory com- 
mittee for the creation of the interna- 
tional agency was announced as: Uni- 
ted States, Soviet Union, Britain, 
France, Canada, Brazil and India, and 
Mr. Vishinsky accepted for the US.S.R. 
the invitation to serve on this com-

mittee. This was taken to mean that 
the Soviet Union would participate in 
the conference planned for 1955. 
Finally, on November 23, the Political 
and Security Committee of the United 
Nations voted unanimously to endorse 
the proposal as made by the seven 
nations: United States, Britain, France, 
Canada, Australia, Belgium and South 
Africa. The resolution thus unani- 
mously carried expresses the hope that 
“international co-operation in develop- 
ing and expanding the peaceful uses 
of atomic energy will assist in lifting 
the burdens of hunger, poverty and di- 
sease” and suggests that “once the 
agency is established, it negotiate an 
appropriate form of agreement with 
the United Nations, similar to those of 
the Specialized Agencies”. 
With respect to the international 
conference on the peaceful uses of ato- 
mic energy, the decision was made that 
“an international technical conference 
should be held under the auspices of 
the United Nations” in which all Mem- 
ber States of the United Nations or of 
the Specialized Agencies would be invi- - 
ted to participate “in order to explore 
the means of developing the peaceful 
uses of atomic energy through interna- 
tional co-operation, to study the deve- 
lopment of atomic power”, and to 
consider related questions in the tech- 
nical areas and fundamental sciences. 
The resolution requested the Secre- 
tary-General to call such a conference 
not later than August 1955, and sugges- 
ted preliminary consultations “with 
the competent specialized agencies, in 
particular Fao, wHO and UNESCO”. 
One final formal action was needed, 
namely the approval of this committee 
action by the entire membership of the 
General Assembly. This was done by 
unanimous vote on December 4, just 
under a year after President Eisen- 
hower made his historic proposal.

THE POWER-PACKED ATOM

so modern urban, civilized living 
demands energy for its sus- 
tenance. Energy is hard to define, 
since it is not a thing and has no size 
or weight. It is the basis of action, the 
capacity for doing work. It is the 
difference between an object in motion 
and one at rest, the difference between 
hot, expanding steam and cold water, 
between coal that can burn and rocks 
that cannot.

tains energy which it loses in action.

Men and animals get energy from the

day’s work. This, plus a little more 
for cooking or for warmth, is enough 
for a simple life. But an industrialized 
country needs far more energy. 
In the U.S.A. for instance, the total 
for each person is 172,000 calories per 
day. This is almost sixty times the

energy that a man generates, so that 
_in such countries every man, woman 
and child has the equivalent of sixty 
labourers working for him. 
In the discussion oi the United 
Nations project for the use of atomic 
energy, M. Jules Moch, French delegate 
and former Minister of the Interior, 
discussed the growing need for energy 
in all the countries of the earth. In 
the major industrial countries the use 
of power doubled during the first third 
of this century and at present is about 
half a horsepower per 
person. In the U.S.A 
the power used in fac- 
tories, excluding trans- 
portation and motors, 
was only 0.19 horse- 
power per person in 
1909 but 0.50 horse- 
power in 1950. This is 
approximately 400 times 
the power demand in 
the underdeveloped ter- 
ritories of Asia, Africa 
and America. 
For the world as a 
whole, the average use 
for power per man is 
now only one sixth of 
that in the U.S.A. 
Hence if the industria- 
lization of the rest of 
the world is to reach 
the level prevalent in 
North America, the 
total energy available 
will have to be multi- 
plied at least six times 
over. Expressed in 
terms of coal, the pro- 
duction would have to 
be increased from 2,500 
million tons to 15,000 
million tons per year. 
The average American 
uses 8 tons of coal a 
year, the European, 2.2, 
whereas the man in a 
practically underdeve- 
loped country only 
makes use of 002 tons. 
This is another way of 
saying that the most 
industrialized countries 
use 400 times as much 
energy per person as do the least 
developed. 
If the world’s consumption of fuels 
were doubled, to say nothing of being 
multiplied sixfold, our underground 
resources would soon prove inadequate. 
The oil and natural gas will last for 
only decades and the coal for some 
centuries. Yet in the industrial coun- 
tries the coal of high quality that is 
easily mined is already becoming 
exhausted, so that at best the cost of 
coal will increase and its quality will 
decrease. For this reason far-seeing 
engineers are gravely concerned over 
the future of the industries that depend 
on underground fuels.

But what is more important is the 
striking disparity in the coal resources 
available in different countries. An 
industrial future is hardly possible for 
ccuntries that have little coal or oil 
To transport a hundred million tons of 
coal for thousands of miles would incur 
a cost of a thousand million dollars for 
freight alone. It is a prohibitive cost. 
It is for this reason that the newly 
created resource of atomic energy 1s 
attractive. If the atom can be 
harnessed to provide the energy, the

radio-isotopes as 
industrialized countries need not fear 
the increasing cost and decreasing 
supply of coal. The countries that 
have no coal can hope to compete at 
once even if its cost is higher than the 
present cost of energy in the industrial 
countries. 
A striking example is the situation 
of so highly industrial a country as 
Switzerland. The economy of that 
is based on water power 
generated from the ample Alpine 
streams. Yet Switzerland faces a 
future in which this power will not be 
enough to meet its needs. 
Recently, Mr. Alfred Winiger de- 
scribed the situation to representatives 
In the meantime scientists are experi- 
Here, two scientists of the Gulf Oil 
Unesco Courier. — Nr 12, — 1954 
of Swiss electrical industries. He fore- 
sees a continuing increase in the de- 
mand for energy of about 3.8% per 
year. On the basis of this estimate he 
concludes that: “By 1975 the demand 
for energy in Switzerland will no lon- 
ger be met by our hydraulic resources, 
which are today used at 50 % of the to- 
tal available. According to circumstan- 
ces, we should have new sources of 
energy at our disposal between 1970 
and 1975 if we wish to avoid being too 
dependent on foreign sources for our 
energy requirements. 
“Taking these fac- 
tors into consideration, 
it is quite logical that 
we should turn to nu- 
clear reactors for our 
future source of energy. 
We should then conti- 
nue to depend on for- 
eign sources for the 
delivery of atomic fuel, 
but, on the other hand, 
the cost of transport of 
the fuel, which at pre- 
sent weighs heavily on 
our economy, should 
be virtually eliminated. 
In effect, a ton of ura- 
nium, used to the 
maximum, produces as 
much heat as 3 million 
tons of coal. To trans- 
port this coal from the 
mines of the Ruhr to 
Zurich would alone cost 
nearly 120 million Swiss 
francs, plus the cost of 
storage. The savingin 
transport costs would 
permit us to lighten 
considerably our ba- 
lance of payments 
abroad.” 
M. Jules Moch, speak- 
ing to the General As- 
sembly of the United 
Nations said: 
“These considerations 
point out the direction 
to be taken by human 
effort. If the standard 
of living of the under- 
developed majority of 
mankind is to be in- 
creased and if the standard of living 
of the industrialized minority is to be 
maintained and improved man must— 
and soon—exploit new power resources 
The achievement of that goal is, in the 
last analysis, the very condition of 
social progress. 
“Does atomic energy offer a solution 
to this problem of replacing exhausted 
or decreasing power resources? Theo- 
retically, this is no doubt true... The 
total annihilation of a gramme of 
material, any material, would release 
the power equivalent to that released 
by the burning of 20 million tons of 
coal. The present needs of all

“However, we do not yet know how 
completely to annihilate a particle of 
matter and turn it into energy. Per- 
haps not even our descendants will 
know how to do so. The phenomenon 
of fission obliterates less than one-

involved. The phenomenon of fusion, 
if it could be carried out in a slowed-

“We should therefore have to subject 
to fission masses of material one

quantities I have just mentioned in 
order to produce the same amount of 
energy and power. In other words, we 
would have to operate in terms of tons 
rather than in terms of pounds. In 
fact, still speaking theoretically, it 
would be necessary to bring about the 
fission of 130 long tons of uranium 235, 
rather than 300 pounds to produce the 
equivalent of the energy produced by 
the burning of 2,500 million tons of 
coal.

### 70093: The Power-packed atom; it could end the world's shortage of energy

we cannot hope for such technical 
progress except after a lapse of a 
number of years, we must envisage a 
doubling of the power consumption 
over the same period, and it would be 
necessary to have natural uranium at 
our disposal, as well as thorium, at the 
rate of 600 tons per year. 
“And finally, in order to give the 
peoples of the world the American level 
of industrialization, the quantity re- 
quired would be almost 4,000 tons per 
annum. Since fruitful breeder ma- 
terials are involved, these figures can 
be reached without any insurmountable 
difficulties, but the technical pro- 
  
cedures must still be perfected and, 
therefore, the general use of atomic 
energy by this process, which as yet 
has not been fully explored can be 
carried out only gradually. 
“Let us, therefore, forego any exag- 
perated hopes. And here we come to 
the core of the problem. The ad- 
vantages of this process, as regards the 
underdeveloped areas of the world, are 
incalculable. The 600 tons of uranium 
which I previously envisaged would 
correspond to a doubling of today's 
consumption of fuel, equivalent to the 
consumption of 5,000 million tons of 
coal. With an extraction rafe of 1 per 
cent of metal, the 600 fons of uranium 
would require 60,000 tons of ore, which 
is a tonnage 80,000 times less than that 
of the coal that would be required to 
produce the same energy. 
“The transition from the thermal era 
to the atomic era would thus take the 
form of a reduction, by a ratio of 80,000 
to 1, of the weight of the.materials or 
ores to be extracted, and a reduction of 
100 times larger would make the ratio 
8 million to 1 in the weight of the fuel 
to be transported from the mine to the 
furnace. Atomic power thus appears 
to be easily dispersable and transferable 
into regions lacking in other resources. 
“This sort of dissemination doubtless | 
would spell immense social progress in 
making available large power resources 
to all peoples. In the same manner, 
the portable reactors now being built 
in America—which are known by the 
striking and expressive name of “power 
package” — constitute a happy augury 
for the international proletarization, if 
I may so call it, of power to be placed 
at the disposal of mankind. 
“One hurdle remains, and that is the 
question of cost. It is certainly rash to 
prophesy, since we do not know the cost 
of atomic power production in large 
central plants which would utilize 
breeder and fissionable materials at 
the same time. We do not know to 
what point the progressive exhaustion

electric current over the same period 
was .8 cents and the price at which it 
was sold to industry was between 1.1 
and 1.3 cents per kilowatt hour. I 
shall not cite the French figures, 
because we are rather poorly endowed 
so far as power costs and power 
resources are concerned. It might be 
hoped that in the near future a cost 
of .7 cents or 8\cents per kilowatt hour 
could be achieved by means of atomic 
energy if such projects were realized in 
conformity with the hopes of their 
sponsors, and it might be supposed that 
atomic energy would rapidly compete 
with conventional energy sources, even 
in those countries where the latter are 
low in cost. 
“The ease of transportation... would 
give atomic energy this rare virtue of 
being saleable everywhere at the same 
prices or at just about the same prices. 
  
Il would therefore be the main power 
rescurce of countries where con- 
ventional power sources are scarce or 
costly, that is to say, essentially in most 
of the under-developed areas of tlie 
globe. Perhaps an international orga- 
nization, prompted by some feeling of 
international solidarity, might assign 
some sort of priority to the latter areas. 
“But even if atomic energy were to 
become competitive, the fact would 
remain that the transition from the 
classical power era to the atomic power 
era will be a gradual and prolonged 
one.”

### 70103: How nations will work together

HOW NATIONS WILL WORK TOGETHER 
  
“The entire world will 
rejoice’, said Dr, Eelco 
N. Van Kleffens, Presi- 
dent of the U. N. Gene- 
ral Assembly, comment- 
ing on the decision which 
opened the way to inter- 
national co-operation 
in the use of the atom. 
THE UNITED NATIONS 
Two separate projects are authorized, 
not formally connected with each other : 
The International Atomic Energy Agency 
This "will be organized in joint discussions between the 
seven nations who sponsored the U.N. resolution : Australia, 
Belgium, Canada, France, Great Britain, South Africa, and 
the United States, and others that desire to join. All states 
that are members of the United Nations or of one of the 
Specialized Agencies will be eligible to membership. It will be 
financed by its member states, as are the existing Specializ- 
ed Agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization 
in Rome, the World Health Organization in Geneva, and 
UnEsco in Paris. Once established, it will negotiate an 
appropriate form of agreement with the United Nations, and 
it 1s thus expected to become one of the Specialized Agencies. 
As conceived by the General Assembly the agency will 
act as international broker for the allocation of fissile, or 
atomic-energy materials, and will study and supervise the 
world-wide use of atomic energy for industrial power and 
of atomic materials and isotopes for research and scientific 
applications. It may also undertake the training of spe- 
cialists in nuclear science. Its work will be related to that 
of the atomic energy commissions of member states, the 
European Centre for Nuclear Research in Geneva, and the 
existing Specialized Agencies of the United Nations. 
Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atom 
The Secretary-General of the United Nations will call an 
international conference to be held not later than August 
1955, to “explore means of developing the peaceful uses of 
atomic energy through international co-operation and, in par- 
ticular, to study the development of atomic power and to 
consider other technical areas—such as biology, medicine, 
radiation protection, and fundamental science—in which 
international co-operation might most effectively be 
accomplished. 
The Secretary-General will have the advice of a committee 
composed of representatives of Brazil, Canada, France, India, 
the U.S.SR., the United Kingdom and the U.S.A. in selecting 
the place of meeting, in issuing invitations, and in prepar- 
ing a detailed agenda for the conference. The Specialized 
Agencies, in particular Fao, WHo, and UNEsco, will be con- 
sulted in connexion with the planning of the conference and 
will be represented at it. 
The conference will cover the wide variety of topics that 
are touched by this new phase of science, including those 
discussed in the articles in this issue of the UNEsCo COURIER, 
It may discuss the functions of the international atomic 
energy agency. But the agency does not need to await the 
report of the conference and there is some international 
enthusiasm for the establishment of the agency in the 
immediate future, well before August. 
14 
oO" December 4, 1954, the atomic age entered into a new and promising phase. 
Meeting in New York on that day, the General Assembly of the United Nations 
unanimously adopted a seven-nation resolution for the international develop- 
ment of atomic energy for peaceful uses and expressed the hope that an international 
atomic energy agency would be set up without delay. 
About the same time, the General Conference of Unesco, meeting in Montevideo, 
had proposals from india, France and Japan to undertake studies on atomic energy, 
isotopes and radiation effects. It delayed action, however, until the United Nations’ 
decision had been made, then adopted a programme to accord with it. “This is a 
matter of momentous importance”, said Dr. Luther Evans, Unesco’s Director-General, 
«Unesco must respond to this great opportunity”. 
A full account of the United Nations action and the discussion that preceded it 
is given in the article on page 5 of this issue. Here are the main features of the 
projects adopted by the United Nations and by Unesco: 
UNESCO 
"Unesco’s own function in support of the United Nations’ 
atomic energy programme has three phases : 
Research Co-operation 
UNEsco is the United Nations Specialized Agency especially 
responsible for the promotion of international co-operation 
in science, and in particular for research and training and 
the diffusion of scientific knowledge, It was responsible for 
the establishment of the European Centre for Nuclear 
Research and will now assist in the preparation of the scien- 
tific aspects of the international conference. UNEsco will 
also assist other U.N. Specialized Agencies, such as the World 
Health Organization, in studying the effects of radio-activity 
on life in general. It will continue to study ways of aiding 
international scientific co-operation in such questions as 
the use of radio-isotopes in research and industry. It may 
prepare preliminary reports on scientific subjects that. are 
essential to .both the conference and the atomic energy 
agency, ahd will be ready to carry out conference suggestions 
relating to international research co-operation. 
Scientific Training 
The conference and the international atomic energy 
agency will certainly provide a stimulus to scientific edu- 
cation and technical training in many parts of the world. 
Even in the industrialized nations, there is already a grave 
shortage of competent science teachers. The sudden dawn 
of an atomic age will create an emergency demand for 
vocational training, for science teaching in the secondary 
schools and for specialized courses in the universities of 
almost all nations. UNEsco will expand its services in these 
fields, particularly in the underdeveloped countries. It will 
hold a workshop conference on vocational training in the 
Middle East in 1956. In addition, UNEsco will prepare ma- 
nual and visual aids for the introduction of the iacuvs and 
concepts of atomic energy, radiation and radio-active 
materials into school science teaching. 
Public Education 
The large public expenditures necessary for the develop- 
ment of atomic power in many nations will demand informed 
public support. The fruitful application of the resuits of 
atomic research in agriculture, medicine and industry also 
require public understanding. Most of all, the economic 
and social consequences of the imminent power-revolution 
in countries that have not yet felt the impact of technology 
demand foresight in government and a broad incorporation 
of science into cultures. The atom can become a friend to 
humanity only when it is universally understood and wel- 
comed. Unesco will call two conferences on the public under- 
standing of science, with the participation of national science 
associations, science writers, and science teachers. One will 
be held in Europe in 1955, the other in Latin America in 
1956. The media of public education “will be widely used, 
as is exemplified by this issue of the UnEsco COURIER.

### 70109: Training the technicians of the new atomic age

HE atomic power project of the 
United Nations carries a promise 
of great and real boons, even of 
an effective social revolution in many 
lands. But a closer view reveals its 
magnitude and complexity. It is nof 
merely a matter of the distribution of 
nuclear’ fuels and the building of 
atomic furnaces. Those powerful new 
forces need to be understood and 
managed by many men in many 
nations who are fully trained in their 
erudite principles and their intricate 
and dangerous techniques. 
Yet the heritage of war and the 
years of secrecy have given only a few 
countries adequate knowledge in this 
field while most countries 
have little or none. It is 
obvious that the engineer- 
ing and production opera- 
tions must be preceded by 
a period of intensive 
training and education in 
those countries that are to 
participate. Several years 
of preparatory education 
may well be needed. 
Even in the early United 
Nations debate this was 
made clear by Mr. Paul 
Martin, the Canadian de- 
legate, who said: 
“The most immediate 
need is for information and 
training to spread the technology 
required for the application of atomic 
energy for peaceful purposes on a wide 
scale. It would be visionary {to 
imagine that if by this time next 
year the international agency had been 
set up it would shortly thereafter be 
in a position to start exporting power 
reactors, for instance, to various parts 
of the world... I say this as plainly as 
I can to prevent possible miscon- 
ceptions being followed by a certain 
disillusionment. 
“The Canadian Government does 
hope, however, that the agency, 
when established, would assist other 
countries participating in the agency's 
programme to set up their own 
research reactors and to 
join with those countries - 
already possessing them in 
pressing forward with the 
search for developing ato- 
mic power on an economic 
basis and with the whole 
range of other actual and 
potential applications of 
atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes. 
“And in order to con- 
struct reactors and carry 
on useful creative research, 
in this field, not only is it 
necessary to 
technical information on 
the subject—much of it 
already available—but one 
must also have scientists, engineers 
and technicians trained at least to 
some degree in the use and inter- 
pretation of these extremely compli- 
cated research tools. 
“For this reason we believe that the 
agency not only should foster the in- 
terchange of information on peaceful 
uses but should facilitate where 
possible the arrangements which will 
have to be made for those countries 
which wish to set up research reactors 
to have their people suitably trained. 
The agency should, in fact, encourage 
world-wide research and development 
and should, in addition, be in a position 
to arrange for the nuclear materials 
which will be needed for this purpose. 
In this connexion I may say that

dian Delegate to the United 
Nations General Assembly. 
have the Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge, 
Permanent U,S. Represent- 
ative to the United Nations. 
Canada would be a potential source not 
only of information but of raw material 
and fissile material.” 
But. the United States had an- 
ticipated this need. Mr. Henry Cabot 
Lodge, the United States delegate 
explained what the United States is 
prepared to do in 1955, even in advance 
of the establishment of the new 
international agency. He said in part: 
“No one has to be a scientist to 
appreciate the fact that basic tu 
success in the development and use 
of power-producing reactors in any 
country 1s the existence of a body of 
trained technical men. 
“We are prepared to establish a 
reactor training school 
early in 1955. The first 
course of this school would 
deal not only with atomic 
power theory, but also with 
the application of that 
theory. Our present plans 
call for inviting between 
thirty and fifty scientists 
and engineers from over- 
seas to study practical 
reactor engineering, in 
order to furnish sufficient 
basic science and engineer- 
ing knowledge to permit 
the members of this group 
not only to understand the 
theory, but also to become 
competent to operate 
reactors... 
“Second comes the field of safety. 
Because we are dealing with a power 
which is both a danger and a boon, it 
is necessary also that special training 
courses in radiation safety and 
medicine should be instituted simul- 
taneously with any training in atomic 
power development. We propose, 
therefore, to establish under the spon- 
sorship of the United States Atomic 
Energy Commission the following 
courses, which will be open to all other 
nations; Industrial Medicine—a one- 
to-two-year course. concerned with 
atomic energy activity; Industrial 
Hygiene—courses in the techniques of 
maintaining healthful conditions In 
industries dealing with 
hazardous atomic ma- 
‘terials; Radiological Physics 
and the theory and use of 
radiation instruments... 
“Third in our training 
programme comes the vast 
field of atomic biology and: 
medicine. The Argonne 
Cancer Hospital at the 
University of Chicago, the 
Brookhaven National Labo- 
ratory, and the Cancer 
Research Hospital at the 
Oak Ridge Institute of 
Nuclear Studies will be 
open for one to two-year 
courses on the use of ato- 
mic energy in medicine 
and biology, for approximately five to 
ten foreign students per course. 
“The field of cancer is so important, 
and other countries have made such - 
strides, that we do not wish to restrict 
our collaboration simply to the study of 
our techniques. We are therefore 
prepared to invite as many as 150 
competent and distinguished visitors 
in the field of cancer research from 
overseas to visit our cancer research 
facilities during 1955. These guests 
will not only be free to study our 
facilities and techniques, but will also 
be encouraged to exchange views with 
our doctors and scientists.

ATOMIC BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
Recently the United States an- 
nounced that several of its 
research centres where atomic 
energy is used in biology and 
medicine are to be opened to 
foreign students. In the vast 
field of atomic biology and 
medicine, in which training pro- 
grammes are being developed 
today, a vital role is played 
by radio-isotopes. These are 
vital elements both in healing 
and research. Photographs on 
these pages show examples 
.of atomic biological research 
whose results will help doctors 
in all lands to fight disease. In 
the Division of Biological and 
Medical Research at the Argonne 
National Laboratory, U.S.A., an 
X-ray (above, left) shows a bone cancer loca- 
ted on the second lumbar vertebrae of a mo use. 
This 1s part of an experiment to determine 
the levels of various isotopes that, if absorbed 
internally in sufficiently large doses, might 
ultimately produce cancers or other injury. 
The isotope used here Is strontium-90 (a 
bone seeker). At Brookhaven National Labo- 
ratory, U.S.A., students can follow studies of 
nutrition and disease control (above, right) in 
which animals are fed or injected with different 
RADIOACTIVE 
 
radio-active elements. These can be traced 
by the rays given off through the most complex 
chemical body processes. At the Radium 
Institute in Paris (below, left) the quantty of 
radio-active carbon (C 14) in the blood of a 
living mouse is tested. Tagged (radio-active) 
rimifon is injected. The experiment is sup- 
plemented by an examination of the mouse’s . 
excretion. Drawing, below, indicates the 
different phases of another experimental use’

### 70109: Training the technicians of the new atomic age

A 700,000-page nuclear library 
( Continued from page 16) 
programme comes the field of radio- 
isotope tracer techniques. In this 
field, until now, the Atomic Energy 
Commission has been able to conduct 
only a limited training programme for 
foreign scientists. The Commission is 
now prepared to establish special 
courses for foreign technicians to begin 
early in 1955, these courses to cover a 
four-week period and to be divided into 
laboratory work, lectures on laboratory 
experiments, and seminars on special 
topics. The laboratory experiments 
would cover the use of instruments, the 
purification and separation of radio- 
active from inert materials, and the 
application of various isotope fech- 
niques to all?’fields of research. 
Vast flow of facts | 
¢¢ HE training courses we propose 
T in safety, medicine and biology 
. would bring basic. knowledge 
and training to more than 250 
technical men from other nations 
in the course of the next twelve 
to fifteen months—the limitation on 
numbers, let me add, being imposed 
not by our desire to restrict the sharing 
of this knowledge, but simply by our 
akility to absorb this number of 
observers, students and trainees effec- 
tively and efficiently within our present 
facilities. 
“So much for our early plans for 
training. Closely allied to this is the 
question of written information about 
ENRICO FERMI : 
Great teacher,

Professor Enrico Fer- 
mi, who died recently 
in Chicago, was one 
of the great figures 
in the history of 
physics with out- 
standing talents both 
for theory and for

the first investigator 
to use neutrons to 
split atomi& nucle 
and he was one of 
the team of scien- 
usts who built the 
first atomic pile. He 
was also a remarkable 
teacher and a fasc- 
nating lecturer on 
every level. Fermi,

dern school of Italian 
physicists, leaves be- 
hind him a generation

the atom. We anticipate that from the 
outset the international agency will 
carry on a series of information and 
service activities, obtaining information 
from the operations of member states 
in connexion with their own atomic 
energy programmes and from the 
agency’s own activities. Here is a brief 
outline of the type of information 
materials which the United States is 
prepared to make available in 1955 to 
the international agency, when set up. 
“Contrary to popular belief, the 
United States has, ever since the begin- 
ning of its atomic development, made 
available through published documents 
of the Atomic Energy Commission and 
articles in scientific journals a vast 
body of research material on the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy... Up to 
now, the publication by the United 
States of documents available to all on 
the peaceful uses of atomic energy 
comes to more than 20,000 papers, to- 
talling more than 700,000 pages of data. 
“Always mindful of the day when 
it might be beneficial to present this 
material in package form, despite the 
fact that it has always been available 
in individual items, we have accumulat- 
ed ten complete libraries of our own 
material, which we are prepared to 
give to the principal technical libraries 
of co-operating nations. And we shall 
provide more than ten if there is a 
demand for more. Besides these 
libraries of our own material, we are 
prepared to provide complete sets of 
index cards, and our journals of the 
past seven years, abstracting 50,000 
scientific and technical books and 
reports published in all countries. 
Stated in physical dimensions, what 
we are prepared to furnish to each 
one of these foreign libraries is the 
equivalent of more than 300 lineal feet 
of published reports and over 200,000 
index cards. 
. “Furthermore, we shall add to all of 
these libraries as the material is 
published, asking only in return that 
the co-operating nations provide their 
collections of official non-secret 
papers, not available in the general 
scientific literature, to be placed in the 
appropriate U.S. libraries.” 
These proposals in technical training 
are planned for 1955 without waiting 
for the organization of the interna- 
tional atomic energy agency or even 
for the United Nations scientific confé- 
rence. They are designed to save 
at least a year in the development 
programme. They should produce a 
small body of experts who will return 
to their own countries as authorities 
ready to take responsibility for the 
large developments to come. If and 
when the international agency is 
organized it may itself undertake to 
continue this training programme, 
Science and the schools 
vuT the proposal assumes that com- 
petent men with a general back- 
ground in engmeering, science or 
medicine can be sent from many lands 
for this specialized training. In the 
future much larger numbers will be 
required. This, in turn, means that 
there must be a rather large increase in 
the number of men who are trained at 
home in the fundamental sciences and 
in the principles and practice of en- 
gineering. It means that in many 
countries both the scientific depart- 
ments of the universities and the 
engineering schools will need to prepare 
for a future in which thousands of 
scientifically - and technically trained 
men will find effective employment. 
The improvement of science and 
engineering teaching in the univer- 
sities 1s already a function of UNEscO’s 
Department of Natural Sciences and is 
a major item in the related programme 
of Technical Assistance. With such 
aid universities and engineering schools 
will have to be enlarged and new ones 
will have to be founded wherever the 
atomic age is to become a reality. 
Furthermore, in many countries the 
universities and engineering schools, 
though well equipped and well staf- 
fed, suffer from the lack of adequate 
science instruction in the secondary 
schools. Thus the demands of the 
atomic energy programmes are cer- 
tain to reach info the general 
educational programme also and to 
stimulate a radical improvement in 
secondary-school science instruction. 
Here again, it is the responsibility of 
Unesco to foresee the need and to 
extend its services in the improvement 
and expansion of secondary-school 
science teaching. The General Con- 
ference of Unesco, meeting at Montevi- 
deo in December, has authorized such 
a development and a new Section of 
Science Teaching has been established 
in the Department of Natural Sciences.

### 66721: Nuclear reactors; their design and use

their design and use 
EFORE we can evaluate the realities 
B of atomic power, as distinct from 
visions of the future, we need to 
understand the basic science involved, 
the installations that generate the 
power and the factors that enter into 
their operation. This in turn takes us 
on an excursion into a realm of science 
that was not taught in any school even 
ten years ago. It also brings us into 
contact with words that hardsy existed 
then but are now becoming familiar in 
every language. 
It is now well known that all matter 
is composed of atoms, discreet particles 
that are the smallest and ultimate 
units of the chemical elements. Until 
the discovery of radium they were 
thought to be indestructible and un- 
changeable. 
clues to an atomic interior and its 
study led eventually to present-day 
“atom-splitting” in which the atom is 
laid wide open to fragmentation, to 
separation of some of its parts and 
even to the addition of more units and 
the synthesis of wholly new atoms. 
The process of splitting is now known 
by the more accurate term, “fission”, 
and those types of atoms which un- 
dergo fission with relative ease, as in 
the atomic bomb, are known as “fis- 
sionable” or “fissile”. It is pity that, 
in the English language at least, there 
is as yet no verb to express the action 
of fission. “To fiss” is almost unthink- 
able and “to fissure” does not quite 
convey the meaning but can hardly be 
improved upon. 
The complex installation in which 
fission takes place with the release of 
energy and the production of new 
elements from the fissile material was 
known originally as a “pile” because 
it was in fact a pile of uranium rods 
and blocks of graphite. It is more 
properly called a “reactor”. In com- 
mon speech it. is the atomic furnace 
where the energy is generated from the 
atomic fuel, though there is no fire and 
Radium provided the first 
no combustion in the usual sense. 
The new science is one of events 
within the atom but more especially 
within the nucleus of the atom. It is 
unfortunate that the terms “atomic 
energy” and “atomic power” have 
become popular, for in truth “nuclear 
energy” and “nuclear power” are more 
correct. The world within the atom, 
as revealed by the natural rays from 
radium and by cosmic rays, is almost 
incredible from the ordinary human 
point of view. This is not merely 
because it is so complex but also 
because the basic particles within the 
nucleus have new and odd relations to 
both matter and energy that do not 
fit into cur common conceptions. 
. The nucleus of the atom contains all 
the “matter”, yet is so small that it 
occupies only a thousandth of a mil- 
lionth of a millionth of the space 
within the atom. It occupies a rela- 
tively smaller space within the whole 
atom than the sun occupies in the 
whole great solar system. In that case 
its density (that is, its weight per 
cubic inch) must be a thousand-times 
“a million times a million times that of 
ordinary materials. Whatever that 
atomic core is made of, it is so dense 
that a lump of it as large as a drop of 
  
water would weigh two million tons. 
But that is only half of the aston- 
ishing situation. Energy is similarly 
concentrated there. Within that ex- 
ceedingly minute volume of the atomic 
nucleus there are new forces that hold 
the mass together. The earth itself 
is held together by gravity but the force 
within the nucleus must be so much 
stronger than gravity that there is no 
word to express it. The force of gra- 
vity would have to be multiplied by a 
number that comprises the figure 1 
followed by 37 zeros. Gravity holds 
the planets in their courses and the 
stars in the sky—but has no place in 
the nucleus. 
The binding force within the nucleus 
is of a new and unknown form. It is 
complicated and depends on the velo- 
city of the nuclear particles and even 
on their spinning motion or rotation. 
On the other hand the force, whatever 
it is, does not depend on electrical 
charges, for (neutral) neutrons and 
(positive) protons seem to attract each 
other to the same degree that they 
attract their own kind. 
This is the present mystery of the 
nucleus and therefore of the atom and 
thus of matter and energy in general. 
There, in the intimacy of the atomic 
NUCLEAR 
REACTION begins 
with sphtting of a 
Uranium 235 or 
plutonium atom. 
When fission oc- 
curs, great energy 
is released and se- 
veral neutrons are 
ejected. These strike 
other U-235 or plu-~ 
tonium atoms lke 
bullets and fission 
them, thus freeing 
moreenergy and mo- 
re neutron bullets.

### 66721: Nuclear reactors; their design and use

The 
nucleus, lies the secret of the {true 
nature of matter, of energy, and of 
their relation to each other. It is the 
purpose of the great cyclotrons and 
synchrotrons, such as those now being 
built at Geneva for the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research, to 
study this nuclear world. (See page 23.) 
It is the nucleus that explodes during 
fission, that emits rays in radio-activ- 
ity, and that combines with other 
nuclei to generate the sun’s heat. It is 
the nucleus that will provide the 
energy for what we have- called the 
atomic age. It is 
by the explor- 
ation and partial 
mastery of the 
nucleus that 
science has in 
recent years been 
able to duplicate 
and greatly im- 
prove on the 
radio-activity of 
radium, for 
instance, and has 
surpassed the 
dream of me- 
dieval alchemists 
by changing one 
chemical element into another, such as 
changing gold into mercury or pro- 
ducing explosive plutonium from harm- 
less uranium. 
Just as the atoms of the various 
chemical elements combine with 
others to form the molecules of che- 
mical compounds, so a number of still 
smaller particles combine to form the 
different atomic nuclei. Three such 
primary particles must be mentioned 
briefly: the proton, the neutron and the 
electron, the last being the familiar 
“particle of electricity” that flows 
through wires in countless millions to 
form an electric current. It has a 
charge—or perhaps one should say it is 
a. charge—of negative electricity, which 
is to say that all electricity is negative 
(and thus misnamed). 
Less familiar is the proton. It is 
almost 2,000 times heavier than the 
electron. It is definitely matter rather 
than electricity. Indeed it is for some 
reason positively charged, as if it had 
itself lost a negative electron. It is an 
essential component of all atomic 
nuclei, combined and compressed in 
them into firm union. But it has a 
comfortable existence all its own as 
the entire nucleus of the hydrogen 
atom, the simplest and lightest atom. 
At the surface of the hydrogen atom 
is a single electron, vibrant and 
dancing in a complex mathematical 
orbit. That electron is responsible for 
the atom’s chemical properties and 
enables it to combine with other atoms 
to form molecules, such as with oxygen 
to form water. But at the centre of 
the hydrogen atom is its concentrated 
mass, its nucleus, the single proton 
whose positive charge balances that of 
the relatively distant electron, making 
the whole atom electrically neutral. 
Every other atomic nucleus is more 
complex and heavier than that of 
hydrogen and every one contains 
neutrons in addition to its protons. 
The neufron is practically identical 
with the proton, with almost exactly 
the same weight, but it has no positive 
charge and so is electrically neutral. 
When neutrons form a part of an 
atomic nucleus they add to its mass

dream has been

of 
and weight but do not affect its 
positive charge and therefore do not 
change the -number of external 
electrons that are responsible for the 
atom’s chemical properties. 
These are the essential components 
of all nuclei: protons, neutrons and 
electrons, plus positrons, mesons and 
others that need no mention here. 
There are, however, several com- 
binations of protons and neutrons that 
form well-known nuclear particles. 
For instance, the “alpha particle”, long 
known as emitted by radium, is com- 
posed of two pro- 
tons and two 
neutrons, and 
thus has two po- 
sitive charges 
when the alpha 
particle is emit- 
ted by radium it 
quickly picks up 
two wandering 
electrons and be- 
comes an atom 
of helium, for the 
alpha particle is 
identical with the 
helium nucleus 
and two external, 
circulating electrons make it a neutral 
whole atom. 
Another such stable group comprises 
a single proton and a single neutron, 
and thus has a single positive charge. 
This group takes part in many nuclear 
reactions and is called a deuteron. 
When it picks up a single electron in 
an external orbit it forms an atom that 
is identical with hydrogen in its 
chemical properties though it is twice 
as heavy because its nucleus is not 
merely a proton but has a neutron 
added. Deuterium is therefore an 
“isotope” of hydrogen that is called 
“heavy hydrogen”. Two deuterium 
atoms combine chemically with one 
atom of oxygen to produce “heavy 
water”. 
Hydrogen,' with only one proton, 1s 
the simplest and lightest atom. But 
there are 92 different chemical elements 
and the atomic nuclei of all the others 
are made up of larger numbers of botlr 
protons and neutrons. The heaviest 
and most com- 
plex of all the 
common atoms is 
uranium, whose 
nucleus contains. 
92 protons and 
146 neutrons, a 
total of 238. 
But this is not 
the only type of 
uranium that can 
exist and there- 
fore not the only 
possible composi- 
tion of the nu- 
cleus. 
There are other forms with 141 
neutrons, or 143, or 147. They all 
have 92 protons and thus all of them 
have identical chemical properties. 
But the weight of the atom is the sum 
of the weights of the protons and 
neutrons, so that these three varieties 
of uranium have atomic weights of 
233, 235 and 239, respectively. 
Such varieties of atoms of the same 
elements, all with the same chemical 
properties but with different weights 
and a differing number of neutrons, are 
atomic

energy 
known as isotopes. Most of them seem 
to be under some sort of strain and 
undergo a disintegration during which 
they emit particles and rays of various 
sorts. Thus they are radio-active and 
are known as radio-isotopes. Their 
rays are useful and will be discussed in 
a subsequent article of this series. 
(See page 29.) 
Isotopes of the naturally radio-active 
elements have long been known, pri- 
marily because of their distinctive rays. 
But bombardment of almost any of the 
92 elements by high-speed protons in 
one of the great modern cyclotrons or 
bombardment by neutrons in an atomic 
reactor will add or subtract neutrons 
from their nuclei and convert them 
into isotopic varieties, some stable, most 
of them radio-active. 
Thus isotopes of all the chemical 
elements are now known—a total of 
more than a thousand different atomic 
varieties. In fact neutrons and protons 
have been added to uranium in various 
stages so that six new, previously un- 
known elements have now been created. 
the last of them—up to now—being 
No. 98, Californium. 
In the case of uranium that variety 
known as uranium 235 (from the 
weight of its atom) spontaneously 
disintegrates when struck by a stray 
neutron, coming perhaps from outer 
space as a cosmic ray, and ejects some 
of its neutrons. When such a neutron 
strikes an atom of uranium 238 it is 
captured to form uranium 239. This in 
turn instantly goes through a more 
complicated nuclear reaction and 
forms plutonium, with a weight of 240. 
When that atom is struck by a neu- 
tron perhaps from another atom of 
uranium 235, it is literally split in two. 
Smaller atoms of lighter elements 
result but the important thing is that 
when this happens some of the binding 
energy within the plutonium nucleus is 
released and the atom not only splits 
but the {fragments fly apart with 
tremendous energy. This reaction is 
the basis both of the atomic bomb and 
of atomic or nuclear power. 
In the bomb the explosion of one 
atom releases swift neutrons which at 
once explode ad- 
joining atoms, 
and the neutrons 
from them in 
turn explode still 
other atoms. 
Within a mil- 
lionth of a se- 
cond the entire 
mass disintegra- 
tes in the indes- 
*ribable explosion 
that has horrified 
the world. But 
when this dis- 
integration is 
controlled so that 
it proceeds at a manageable rate, then 
the energy of disintegration may be 
liberated over the course of hours, 
months or years. Precisely the same 
energy that feeds the bomb feeds the 
atomic furnace, the “nuclear reactor”. 
The reactor is thus the scene of 
controlled nuclear explosions. In it, 
the high-speed nuclear fragments, and 
neutrons too, are slowed down, their 
energy ls absorbed in the surrounding 
materials and reappears as heat. If 
may be that by future research the

### 66721: Nuclear reactors; their design and use

high-speed nuclear projectiles can be 
harnessed to generate electricity di- 
rectly but for the present all atomic 
reactors generate heat and their 
energy can be used only in that form. 
But if reactors are to be used for 
- industrial power this heat must be 
captured and put to work. Modern 
reactor design is largely a problem of 
how to capture a maximum quantity of 
heat and thus to utilize the energy of 
the exploding atoms efficiently. The 
crucial point in present atomic power 
development is precisely that: whether 
or not enough 
heat can be cap- 
tured to justify - 
the enormous 
cost of the reac- 
tor and of the 
fissionable ura- 
nium and whe- 
ther or not the 
power produced 
will compare in 
cost with the po- 
wer made by the 
combustion of 
coal or any of 
the other fuels. 
*The task is complicated by the fact 
that neutrons are emitted during fission 
at very high speed, which are dangerous 
to personnel, ruinous to equipment and, 
in addition, convert many of the atoms 
that they strike into radio-active 
isotopes which are themselves dan- 
gerous. Consequently, the heat cannot 
be removed from the reactor by any 
simple device. The cooling liquid that 
flows through the reactor becomes 
radio-active and cannot be used direct- 
ly to operate an engine. 
In one common type of reactor the 
coolant is liguid metallic sodium. This 
flows from the reactor through pipes 
to a heat-exchanger where it is in turn 
cooled by water before it returns to 
cool the reactor once more. In that 
exchange the water turns to steam that 
is not dangerous because the radio- 
active sodium does not emit neutrons 
and thus does not affect the water or 
the steam. The “latter can then be 
passed through a steam turbine where 
its high-pressure energy spins the 
turbine and thereby generates electri- 
city. Thus by successive steps the 
energy which came from the exploding 
plutonium or uranium atoms emerges 
from the power house as electric 
current and is in no way different from 
a current generated by other methods. 
It is apparent then that the nuclear 
reactor is merely the source of energy 
and in a large power house would 
replace only the coal furnace: all the 
remaining parts of the power installa- 
tion would be unchanged. » 
There are many types of nuclear 
reactors. They all have features in 
common that differ only in degree. 
The fuel is always a fissionable 
material, either uranium-233, 235 or 
plutonium. Each of these releases 
almost three million times as much 
heat when it disintegrates as does the 
combustion of an equal weight of coal. 
The pure fissionable materials are, 
however, extremely difficult and costly 
to produce. Uranium-235 is present 
in all natural uranium but comprises 
only 0.7 % of it. Since it is chemically 
identical with the 99.3 % of uranium- 
238, it can be separated from it only 
by complex and costly physical 
+ methods. Plutonium must be made 
from uranium-238 in a reactor and 
uraniuin-233 can be similarly made 
Three million 
times the heat 
of coal der to get a 
from thorium. The pure fissionable 
fuels therefore cost many thousands of 
dollars per pound. For the generation 
of power they are commonly used in a 
less pure form in which ordinary 
uranium is merely “enriched” with the 
fissionable varieties. 
If the purpose of the reactor is to 
produce plutonium, high grade ura- 
nium-235 is the fuel. It converts 
ordinary uranium-238 into plutonium 
which can then be chemically separated 
in the pure form and used in the bomb 
or as the fuel in another reactor. If 
the purpose of 
the reactor is to 
test the resis- 
tance to neutrons 
metals and 
materials 
that are to be 
used in the reac- 
tors or in atomic 
engines, the fuel 
may again be a 
pure fissionable 
uranium in or- 
maximum con- 
centration of 
: neutrons acting 
upon the materials being tested. If po- 
wer alone is the purpose of the reactor 
the fuel is “enriched” uranium because 
a high intensity of neutrons is not 
needed and a slower reaction is more 
likely to generate usable heat. 
Every reactor also has some form of 
“moderator”, a material like graphite, 
heavy water or beryllium, which serve 
rimarily to slow down the neutrons 
from their original speed of many 
thousands of miles per second to a 
speed at which they are more likely to 
be captured by the uranium atoms and 
thus to cause fission. 
Every reactor also needs a material 
which actively captures neutrons but is 
not capable of fission by them. The 
commonest material for this purpose is 
the metal cadmium. It reduces the 
number of flying neutrons and thus 
reduces the rate of the fission reaction. 
The cadmium is commonly used in the 
form of thick rods which can be in- 
serted into the reactor if the reaction 
is going too fast and thus slow it down. 
They may, in 
fact, be inserted 
fully, whereupon 
they stop the 
reaction comn»le- 
tely and shut 
down the rear: », 
Thus the speed 
of both the fis- 
sion reaction and 
of the power ge- 
neration is then 
controlled and 
danger of, a 
runaway reaction 
or an explosion 
is avoided. 
Also every reactor must be provided 
with means for carrying away the heat. 
While this is necessary for all reactors 
to keep them from melting, the cooling 
liquid is the crucial part of a reactor 
that is used for generating power, as 
has been said. 
Finally, every reactor must also have 
an effective shield to absorb neutrons 
that escape from the fission reaction 
and prevent them from penetrating 
into the room where scientists and 
attendants are at work. Such shields 
are usually heavy walls of lead or con- 
crete, or both. No reactor can safely 
operate without a shield and it is for 
The furnace 
which breeds 
its own fuel 
Unesco Courter — N- 12. — 1954 
this reason that there is no hope that 
atomic reactors can ever be used for 
the propulsion of automobiles or for the 
heating of homes. The shield alone 
must weigh many tons. While this is 
no obstacle to its use in a large power 
station or in a marine vessel, it is one 
of the severe limitations on the use of 
any atomic engine for airplanes. 
Until May of 1953 the prospect of 
using atomic fuels and reactors as a 
major source of industrial power was a 
bright hope but not more than that. 
There were two major obstacles. One 
was the cost of the pure fissionable fuel, 
which has never been stated, since it is 
made only by governments for military 
purposes and it cannot now be bought 
anywhere. It was nevertheless certain 
that the cost per pound was very high 
indeed. The second obstacle was the ° 
lack of any certainty that there is 
enough uranium available in the 
minerals of the world to supply an 
atomic industrial age. Both obstacles 
were eliminated by the announcement 
of the success of the experimental 
“breeder” reactor, operated by the U.S. 
Atomic Energy Commission at Arco, 
Idaho, since 1951. At one stroke the 
effective supply of uranium was mul- 
tiplied by 140 and the effective cost of 
the fuel was reduced almost to zero. 
The breeder reactor is a major item in 
the prospect of atomic power. 
Briefly it is a reactor that generates 
power and at the same time produces 
as much new fissionable material as it 
uses up, and probably more. This at 
first thought seems as impossible as 
would a coal furnace that consumes 
tons of fuel to generate heat but at the 
end contains more fresh coal than was 
fed into it. Such a furnace would 
operate without any fuel cost and, in 
fact, could sell new coal to other users. 
In the case of coal it is, of course, im- 
possible. But with atomic fuels in a 
breeder reactor it is only one of many 
apparent miracles. 
When an atom of uranium-235 
fissures it emits high-speed neutrons, 
as has been said. If the fission 
reaction is maintained, one of the 
neutrons must strike another atom of 
uranium-235 so that this, in turn, will 
undergo fission. If two neutrons are 
emitted the se- 
cond may do the 
same, but if ordi- 
nary uranium- 
238 (which does 
not fissure) is 
also present the 
second neutron 
© may strike it, 
and thus change 
it into plutonium, 
Plutonium is fis- 
sionable, exactly 
as is uranium- 
235, and the ori- 
ginal value of 
the fuel has thus 
been restored. If the uranium-235 fis- 
sion always emits two neutrons and if 
both processes are 100 % efficient, the 
furnace would be continuously manu- 
facturing its own fuel out of the cheap 
natural uranium-238. The practical 
questions then are: How many neu- 
trons does uranium-235 emit on fission 
and how efficient is the process ? 
The exact humber of neutrons emit- 
ted has never been revealed. It has, 
however, been annouced that there are 
“more than two”. The margin this gives 
is such that some neutrons may be lost 
by striking the rods or other inert ma- 
terials in the reactor and yet leave one

THE COST OF 
FUEL WILL BE 
NEGLIGIBLE 
to carry on the reaction and one to 
make new fuel. If three neutrons are 
emitted there is ample margin and it 
thus becomes possible that the reactor 
may even make more fuel than it uses. 
That this is possible is still a real 
hope, though it has as yet no official 
confirmation. What the U.S. Atomic 
Energy Commission did announce in 
May 1953 was that fissionable plu- 
tonium is produced in the breeder 
reactor “at a rate that is at least equal 
to the rate at which the uranium-235 
is being consumed”. 
In the case of thorium, however, it is 
known that more fuel can be produced 
than is used. The original fuel in this 
case is also uranium-235. If a neutron 
from it strikes an atom of thorium-232 
(which is not fissionable) that atom is 
converted into fissionable uranium-233. 
The reaction is 
efficient enough 
" so that more ura- 
nium-233 is pro- 
duced than the 
uranium- 235. 
When more fuel 
is produced than 
consumed, the 
excess can be 
sold fo other 
users, presum- 
ably the Govern- 
ment itself, and 
the returns would 
reduce the net 
cost of power 
which has been 
produced in the nuclear reactor. 
  
In both cases common and relatively 
cheap materials, uranium and thorium, 
are converted into atomic fuels by the 
reactor whose primary purpose is the 
economic generation of power. This 
means that all the uranium and 
thorium in the world could be con- 
verted into effective fuels instead of 
only the 0.7 % or 1/140th of the 
uranium that is present as uranium- 
235. This multiplies the world’s re- 
sources of uranium fuel 140 times. 
What is more, it adds all the great 
deposits of thorium to the fuel supply. 
The breeder reactor which has 
supplied this information and created 
this confidence is a relatively small one 
with a production of 250 kilowatts of 
electricity—enough "for only a small 
town. At its centre is the core of 
fissionable uranium-235, about the size 
of a football, Around this core is a 
thick cylinder of ordinary uranium-238 
which catches the neutrons to form 
plutonium. The heat evolved is egui- 
valent to 4,000 watts for every cubic 
inch of the active core. . 
In comparison, an oil-fired boiler, 
such as is used in battleships, gives 
only 600 watts per cubic inch of fuel. 
The heat from the breeder reactor is 
conducted away by a flow of liquid 
sodium through inserted pipes. The 
sodium stream emerges from the 
reactor at a temperature of about 
660° F and delivers its heat to water in 
a heat-exchanger and thus forms steam 
to drive a turbine.

COSMOTRON, at Brookhaven National Laboratory U.S.A., 15 the second most 
powerful of giant machines used by scientists to bombard atomic nuclei with 
high energy particles and thus learn more- about their make-up and nature. (Most 
powerful machine operating at present is the Berkeley Bevatron, at the University of 
California.) The huge “doughnut-shaped” magnet, 75 feet in diameter, guides the particles 
in a circular path while a succession of electric bgosts gives them phenomenal speeds. 
Collisions between high-energy particles and nuclei are seen as thin white tracks (photo, 
left), when photographed in an instrument called a cloud chamber. 
To calculate the cost of the fuel used 
in producing power is easy enough. As 
has been explained, this is now not the 
cost of the expensive, fissionable 
uranium-235 but of ordinary uranium- 
238 the price of which is approximately 
£35 a pound. Since 20 pounds of 
uranium will produce some 52 million 
kilowatts hour of electricity—enough to 
light a fairly large city for a year—the 
cost of the fuel used would be only 
0.0013 cents per kilowatt hour. Since 
the usual price of electricity is more 
than one cent per kilowatt hour, the 
fuel cost itself is quite negligible. 
But such a calculation is illusory 
because other expenses are involved. 
The most important of which is the 
occasional removal of the covering 
cylinder of natural uranium and its 
chemical processing to extract the 
plutonium for the future fuel. This is 
a difficult operation because the very 
strong radio-activity of the materials 
makes it necessary to conduct the 
chemical operation by remote con- 
trol, without contact with personnel. 
Furthermore, the core itself gradually 
exhausted as the becomes fission 
  
 
products accumulate in it. It too must 
therefore ultimately be removed so that 
the remaining uranium-235 can be 
extracted from the variety of other 
and smaller radio-active atoms that are 
the products of fission. The processing 
of the fuels therefore adds an item of 
cost which is at least ten times that of 
the original uranium. In that case the 
fuel cost is 0.013 cents per kilowatt 
hour, which is still negligible. 
But there are other costs. The 
highly radio-active products must be 
disposed of. Some of them are valuable 
for use asradio-isotopes. Most of them 
+ are of no value but are intensely radio- 
active and are therefore a serious 
hazard. In any case the cost of 
disposing of radio-active wastes is an 
important one. 
But the major cost is the building of 
the reactor itself which is between 
2 million and 20 million dollars, or even 
more. The calculation of the practical, 
final cost of electricity must therefore 
be postponed to a more comprehensive 
discussion of other reactor installations 
and the plans of electrical power com- 
panies 1n a subsequent article (page 41).

from its government. And for that matter, very few gov-

programme by themselves. The only solution is interna- 
tional collaboration. 
Unesco has been concerned with this problem since 1950 
when it was asked to help bring together European scientists 
and governments to establish a European centre for nuclear 
research. A few months ago this project became a reality 
when the European Organization for Nuclear Research came 
into being following the ratification of an international 
convention by nine countries. 
CERN, as the Organization is usually called (from the 
French title—Conseil Europeen pour la recherche nucléaire

ternational organization for scientific research set up by an 
intergovernmental Convention. Today this Convention has

international co-operation in the field of scientific research. 
M. Henri Longchambon, Secretary of State at the French

said that while technicians now know how to produce atomic 
energy, the mechanism and behaviour of nuclear forces are 
still shrouded in mystery. In investigating these pheno-

mena, research is focussed on 
very high-energy particles, 
found principally in cosmic 
rays reaching the earth from 
outer space, but which can be 
created artificially by bom- 
barding atomic nuclei with 
the help of machines called 
particle accelerators. 
The creation of these artifi- 
cial cosmic rays in laboratories 
is an essential part of nuclear 
research. That is why physi- 
cists and engineers, for the 
past twenty years, have been 
building more and more po- - 
werful accelerators. In Europe only a few countries have 
enough money and a sufficient range of scientific and tech- 
nical resources to build their own machines. 
England, with a thousand-million electron-volt accelerator, 
is very advanced in this field, and France has just decided to 
build one which is to reach- 2.4 thousand-million electron- 
volts, and several medium-power accelerators. 
But even for such countries, the advantages of interna- 
tional co-operation in this field are very great. Even the 
most modern American institutions, which were still, quite 
recently, leading in this field, entrust such research to spe-

from Europe. 
CERN has therefore set up teams of the foremost special- 
its in its Member States to design the two accelerators : a 
600 million electron-volt synchro-cyclotron and a 25 thous- 
and-million electron-volt proton-synchrotron. The construc- 
tion of the first machine—one of a classical type—raises no 
special difficulties and can be completed in 2 or 3 years. 
The construction of the second machine, however, is a dar- 
ing venture. It'is to have five times the power of the most 
powerful accelerator at present operating in the USA (the 
Berkeley Bevatron) and is to be built on an entirely new 
principle. The speed of the particles it generates will 
approach the velocity of light—the absolute ceiling. It will 
take six or seven years to build. 
There will be nothing secret about CERN’s work. Its 
creators hope that it will mark the beginning of a new era 
of international collaboration in atomic research. Its ela- 
borate and costly equipment will serve all science and 
through it a world that is anxious to make good use of the 
secrets of the atom. 
    
CONSTRUCTION of CERN'S central laboratory is now going ahead on a site some 2,000 feet square about three miles north- 
west of Geneva, Switzerland, and adjoining the French border on land offered by the Geneva Canton. The cost is estimated at 
120 million Swiss francs (28 million dollars) for the first seven years, including construction and operation. Project was first 
proposed by the European Cultural Conference in 1949 and adopted by the Unesco General Conference in 1950. In 1953, a 
Convention establishing the Organization was signed in Paris. CERN became a reality on September 29, 1954, when the Conven- 
tion had been ratified by nine of the twelve nations which have signed it.

O eventually control disease, and today, greater 
opportunities exist than ever before for mastering 
it. Atomic energy is the amazing tool which now helps 
doctors to learn the processes of the human body and to 
fight illness. Radio-isotopes—substances containing the 
atoms which give off radiations and which are now being 
produced in ever-increasing quantities—have been des- 
cribed by doctors as the most important discovery since 
the invention of the microscope. In healing, isotopes 
with strong rays penetrate the affected area of the body 
and attack disease. In research, isotopes with weak, 
harmless rays are swallowed or injected and their rays 
trace hidden changes in the body. Photographs on this 
page and overleaf illustrate some of the ways in which 
the energy in the atom is being used to fight disease.

of bombarding a cancer with powerful rays is by machines such as the Van de Graff

PLANTING SEEDS 
OF RADIO-GOLD 
The use of powerful tissue-destroying rays from 
radium is well established in the treatment of 
cancers. But radium has a long radio-active 
“life” and If implanted in cancer tissue must be 
removed after a time. Today several kinds of 
radio-isotopes are replacing radium for implan- 
tation. One of these is radio-gold, which has a 
half-life of three days. (The “half-life” Is the time 
taken for the activity of a radio-active substance 
to decay to half its original value). As it is also 
inert 1n body tissues, it can be placed in them and 
forgotten. Photographs (top of page) show some 
phases in localization of a deep-seated brain 
tumour and its treatment with radio-gold grains 
at the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris. Use has 
been made of what is called the Stereotaxic 
method for locating an exact point (the site of 
the tumour, in this case) by taking measurements 
from three directions, with a specially developed 
apparatus. Above, doctors examine a radiograph 
of the patient's skull taken while the head was 
held in the frame of the Stereotaxic apparatus. 
Centre, the apparatus itself. Right, after injecting 
patient with a radio-isotope, surgeon obtains 
confirmation of the tumour site. Inserting a 
needle-like probe, combined with a Geiger 
counter, he is able to pin-point the exact depth 
(to within one millimetre) of the tumour because 
of the stronger radiations which come from the 
tumour tissues due to a greater concentration 
there of radio-active isotope, as compared with 
those from normal tissue. Afterwards, through 
the same tiny hole in the skull, he places grains 
of radio-active gold in the centre of the tumour 
with the aid of a special instrument. Photo, 
left, is a radiograph taken after two grains of 
radio-gold had been placed in a brain. Outlines 
of two needle-like instruments used to implant 
the gold are shown, and, slightly below ‘their 
points, the two grains of radio-gold are seen as 
black specks. (Photos USIS by André Steiner.)

### 70137: Isotopes and the hazards of radiation

REMOTE CONTROL devices are used for handling those radio-active 
isotopes which emit dangerous radiation. Photos show how this is done 
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S.A. from where isotopes are sent 
to many parts of the world for use in industry, medicine and agriculture, 
Ss soon as atnmic power begins 
to be widely used by industry 
throughout the world an impor- 
tant flow of by-products will come from 
the atomic furnaces that provide this 
power. And important and valuable 
as is the energy to be obtained from 
the atom, it is safe to say that these 
by-products of the atomic furnaces 
will be at least as valuable. 
When an atom of uranium or thori- 
um undergoes fission it splits into 
two or more smaller atoms. The velo- 
city of these fragments becomes useful 
as heat but the new atoms remain 
buried in the reactor core. They are 
subjected there to a con- 
tinuing intense bombard- 
ment by neutrons. This 
induces further nuclear 
changes and in their final 
form nearly all these 
atoms are so charged with 
energy that when they 
are later separated from 
the remaining uranium 
they are intensely radio- 
active. 
Similarly, almost any 
other material inserted - 
into the core of the 
reactor, by means of a 
special inlet tube, for 
instance, is also so bombarded that it 
emerges in a strongly radio-active form. 
As has been explained in an earlier 
article of this series, these new forms 
of otherwise stable atoms are known as 
isotopes and, when they are radio- 
active, as radio-isotopes. The core of 
a reactor is an immensely powerful 
device for manufacturing them. 
The radio-activity consists of atomic 
disintegrations which are small conti- 
nuing atom-by-atom explosions. The 
energy or tension in the atom of a 
radio-isotope is, in effect, relieved by 
the ejection of an electron, or an alpha 
particle and is accompanied by an 
intense emission of very short ether vi- 
brations, called - gamma rays, which 
resemble X-rays except that they are 
usually much more penetrating than 
any X-rays. 
Isotopes of the various elements 
differ in the rate at which they decay 
and give off their energy. Some com- 
plete the process in a small fraction of

a second, others in minutes, hours, 
days, years or even centuries. Obvious- 
ly those in which the process is rapid 
give a very intense radiation while they 
last. Those that require years or cen- 
turies to decay give relatively only 
feeble radiations at any time. 
There is thus an enormous variety 
of isotopes. The total number known 
at present is close to 1,300 of which 
about 800 are radioactive and more than 
150 are useful and sfable enough to be 
kept in stock on shelves for sale. Some 
are used for the intensity or penetra- 
tion of their rays and others because 
their rays are feeble. The type of ray 
 
desired.for specific practical effects also 
determines the choice of an isotope. 
Furthermore, the isotopes are chemical 
elements such as carbon, iron, phos- 
phorous and gold, and they may be 
chosen for use because of their normal 
chemical reactions. 
Before the days of the atomic reactor 
most radio-active materials were rela- 
tively weak. One of the strongest was 
radium, long used in the treatment of 
cancer. In those early days it was sold 
in milligrammes, thousandths of a gram- 
me and cost approximately $100 per 
milligramme. When the women of Ame- 
rica honoured Madame Curie toward 
the end of her life, they presented her 
with a whole gramme of radium at a 
cost of more than $100,000. 
All the purified radium in the world 
amounts to less than 2,500 grammes — 
a little more than five pounds. Modern 
reactors however produce radio-active 
isotopes in quantities thousands of 
times as powerful as radium. A quan-

shielding. Operation is observed by means of overhead mirrors and a

tity of radio-active cobalt that is equi- 
valent to 10 kilogrammes of radium — 
10,000 grammes or 10 million milli- 
grammes — can now be purchased at a 
reasonable price. 
With such materials radiation effects 
can be obtained that were hardly con- 
ceivable ten years ago. For instance, 
the University of Michigan in the 
U.S.A. has recently announced that 
pork briefly exposed to the intense ra- 
diation from an isotope of cobalt can 
be freed of the trichina parasites. 
About 18 % of all pork is infected with 
these dangerous worms. The way 
trichinosis 1s avoided today is by cook- 
ing pork thoroughly. 
For another example, 
research men at Oregon 
State College in the U.S. 
have reported that pota- 
toes similarly exposed 
“are in perfect condition 
after almost two years in 
2 bin under commercial 
storage conditions.” The 
US. Army is now study- 
ing preservation of food 
by means of radiation 
from radio-isotopes with- 
out using refrigeration. 
It is possible completely 
to kill the bacteria, es- 
pecially in meats, but perhaps also in 
fruits and vegetables, so that the food 
will not spoil and can be exposed on 
the shelf for many weeks without 
deterioration. 
Such uses of intense rays are closely 
related to the radiation hazard in the 
vicinity of an atomic reactor. These 
are always enclosed within heavy walls 
of lead and concrete to prevent expo- 
sure of the operators to the rays. It 
must be said that the reactor also 
emits high-speed, very penetrating 
neutrons but the radio-isotopes do not. 
One of the most hazardous operations 
in the world is the removal of the core 
of an exhausted reactor and the dispo- 
sal of the enormously radio-active 
waste products that have accumulated 
in it. Special devices are used, such as 
allowing the spent uranium rods to 
fall directly from the reactor into a 
large pool of water and into an under- 
water cart by which they are removed 
for safe disposal. But that disposal is

itself one’of the major problems of the 
atomic industry, for the intense radio- 
activity may in this case last for deca- 
des and part for centuries. 
The reactor wastes have been buried 
in deep pits and they have been hauled 
far out to sea sealed in great blocks of 
concrete. Neither of these is satisfac- 
tory in the long run so that Dr, Ira M. 
Freeman, of Rutgers University in the 
. United States, has suggested that one 
of the best uses to which a future 
space-rocket can be put is to send a 
container of radio-active waste far out 
into space where it would continue in 
an orbit around the earth or perhaps 
around the sun for ever, gradually 
exhausting its radio-activity. On the 
other hand, if the demand for radio- 
isotopes in industry, agriculture and 
medicine continues to grow the wastes 
of the reactor would provide an ample 
supply. . 
In spite of the radiation hazards, 
men working with the atomic reactors 
are very seldom harmed. In fact, the 
published figures show that accidents

and injuries in the many large atomic 
plants in America are decidedly less in 
relation to the number of men em- 
ployed than in ordinary industry. This 
is because the danger is understood 
and is guarded against. Not only are 
all dangerous operations conducted 
behind thick walls by remote control, 
but employees who may be exposed to 
radiation wear special clothing and 
- all of them are constantly inspected by 
photographic and electronic instru- 
ments for any traces of radio-active 
contamination. 
Precisely the same source of danger 
arises when the atomic bomb is ex- 
ploded, except that in that case the 
radio-active atoms are very finely 
blown throughout many cubic miles of 
the thin stratosphere. There are many 
millions of cubic miles of air above the 
earth and the dispersion by the bomb 
itself, by heat and by winds is so great 
that the concentration of radio-active 
material in the air is almost vanish- 
ingly small. But it can be detected 
by sensitive instruments. It is thus

that the explosion of an atomic bomb 
can be detected on the other side of 
the earth. 
There is no doubt, however, that the 
slow accumulation of radio-active mate- 
rial from successive bombs and espe- 
cially from hydrogen bombs, which are 
thousands of times as powerful as 
uranium bombs, would eventually pro- 
duce concentrations of radio-active 
materials in the air that would harm- 
fully affect all living things. In Sep- 
tember 1954, Dr. E. D. Adrian, President 
of the British Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science warned that “we 
must face the possibility that repeated 
atomic explosions will lead to a degree 
of general radio-activity which no one 
can tolerate or escape.” 
It is not now possible to estimate 
whether this point will be reached 
after the explosion of a hundred 
atomic bombs or after a few thousand. 
Experts agree that the two score of 
bombs that have been exploded up to 
now have done no harm. The one 
exception was one hydrogen bomb ex-

Lasting fire 
ploded over the Pacific which did 
shower radio-active dust over a much 
larger area than had been expected 
and caused burns on 23 unfortunate 
Japanese fishermen of whom one has 
since died. Their boat, the “Fukuryu 
Maru”, was between 70 and 90 miles 
from the centre of the explosion. Such 
danger from the explosion itself, is, 
however, enormously greater than from 
the isotopes dispersed at great heights 
and over a wide area. 
Nevertheless the radiation hazard 
needs more careful] study and on a 
motion of the Japanese delegation at 
the Montevideo General Conference in 
December, Unesco was authorized to 
co-operate with the World Health Or- 
ganization (WHO) in studying protec- 
tion against the effects of radio-acti- 
vity on life in general. 
The sterilization of meat and vege- 
tables by intense rays from powerful 
isotopes, though technically possible, is 
still too expensive. The use of isotopes 
for sterilization will come first in the 
case of more valuable materials such 
as penicillin and other antibiotics. 
These drugs are injected or used inter- 
nally and so must be completely free 
of all bacteria or other infections, yet 
they cannot usually be heated or boiled 
to sterilize them. The vials containing 
the drug can be briefly exposed to an 
intense radiation equal to many kilo- 
grammes of radium and can thus be 
safely and completely sterilized in the 
cold. 
Another use was recently demonstra- 
ted by Admiral Lewis Strauss, Chair- 
man of the U, S. Atomic Energy Com- 
mission, who carried with him a small 
box weighing about 20 pounds, light 
enough. to be carried on a battlefield,

Here the cristal-

stimulated to lu- 
minosity by the 
rays given off 
by the strontium 
which decreases 
in strength at so 
slow a rate that 
the markers re- 
main lum i- 
nous for a score of years or more. 
Another application is in the ordi- 
nary fluorescent tube. When isotopes 
are mixed with the luminous material 
they increase the conductivity of the 
air in the tube so that it requires less 
voltage to start the lamp and it starts

‘much more quickly. A similar use is 
made of a tube of such materials weak- 
ly radio-active, where there is danger 
of sparks from static electricity. The 
faint rays make the air a sufficient 
conductor of electricity so that static 
does not accumulate. 
A typical industrial use of the rays 
from these radio-active materials is in 
the automatic control of the produc- 
tion of thin sheets of paper or plastic, 
or the metal for making tin cans. As 
the sheet leaves the rollers which 
squeeze it to the desired thickness, it 
passes through an instrument that 
holds a small amount of radio-active 
material under the sheet and holds a 
detecting instrument such as a Geiger 
counter, over the sheet. The rays 
penetrate the sheet and are received 
and detected on the other side. 
But if the sheet for some reason 
becomes either thinner or thicker than 
is desired, the amount of radiation 
received by the detecting instrument 
instantly increases or decreases as a 
result, because it is partly absorbed in 
the sheet. Thus the instrument is a 
constant and automatic inspector of 
the thickness and it can easily be

cro-amperes and 
one fifth of a 
volt. Small as it 
is, it is the first 
practicable con- 
version of atomic 
energy directly 
into electricity 
without the use 
of heat. 
A  well-knowu 
use of the direct 
rays from radio- 
isotopes is in me- 
dicine. 
The use of the 
powerful tissue- 
destroying rays 
from radium is 
established in the 
treatment of can- 
cers. They have 
the same effect 
as equally power- 
ful X-rays but a 
cancer can often 
be reached with a small pellet or tube 
of radium that cannot well be reached 
by X-ray tube. The new radio-isotopes 
can be used in exactly the same way, 
but with the advantage that the 
amounts of radiation that can be 
obtained from them are far larger than 
in the case of radium and cost less. 
The commonest substitute for radium 
is radio-cobalt. A small cylinder of 
metallic cobalt gives gamma rays equal 
to that of radium costing several 
hundred thousand pounds sterling, 
Such a piece of cobalt, weighing little 
more than an ounce is enclosed in 
heavy metal but an intense beam of 
radiation is directed through a small 
window at the cancerous growth. 
In other forms, both radio-phos- 
phorus and radio-gold are very 
conveniently used for this type of 
treatment, For skin cancers, an 
ordinary blotting paper is soaked with 
radio-active phosphate solution and 
when dry it is cut to the size and shape 
of the tumour, then is strapped fo the 
tumour with adhesive. Radio-cobalt 
can be drawn out into a fine wire or 
cut into tiny beads which can be 
placed within the cancerous growth. 
And radio-gold can be formed into tiny 
grains which are fired directly into the 
cancer from a small “gun”. In both 
cases they remain in the cancer until 
it is destroyed.

he world's poorly fed people number hun- 
dreds of millions. In some countries famine 
hovers at innumerable doorsteps every 
year. Yet more and better food for hungry 
peoples could be produced if better types of 
crops could be developed, and if agriculturists 
could learn more of the secrets of plant life 
and growth. In time, atomic energy may help 
to dispel the spectre of hunger from homes all

improved ways of raising crops, teach them how 
to combat insects and plant diseases more effec- 
tively, and even create new types of plants which 
yield a larger harvest or better-quality produce. 
Using radio-isotopes as “tracers” scientists have 
been able to learn much about plant growth and 
how to make the best use of fertilizers. One 
authority has said: “The advances made with 
isotopes in the knowledge of phosphate fertilizers 
during the past four years is equal to and may 
exceed the progress in this field during the

PLANTS TAKE 
OWN PHOTOS 
sing radio-isotopes, scientists are today 
U probing deeply into the greatest secret 
of nature — how green plants use the 
sun's energy to build their substance from the 
water and carbon-dioxide of the air, releasing 
oxygen in the process. Photosynthesis, as it is 
known, 1s the basic biochemical process under- 
lying all life, since it provides the ultimate 
source of food for all living things and replenishes 
the oxygen in the atmosphere. Itisan apparently 
simple reaction in which the molecule of water 
and that of carbon dioxide are combined, lose 
some oxygen and form starches, sugar, cellulose 
and more involved chemical materials. So far 
man has been unable to duplicate the process, 
but the availability of a faintly radio-active 
isotope of carbon has given much information 
to scientists and may eventually explain the 
reaction completely, Exposed to radio-active 
carbon dioxide for only one minute, green 
leaves of certain plants were found to have 
already manufactured over fifty separate com- 
pounds. Photo, below right, shows one of the 
detailed studies of the mechanism of this basic 
plant reaction. Isotopes are now widely used 
in tracing other complicated plant processes 
of growth and food production. Photo, right. 
shows an image made by a bean plant containing 
radio-active matenals. Twenty-five millionths 
of a gramme was applied to one leaf. During 
the next three days the material was absorbed 
into other parts of the plant. In photo below, 
tomatoes have “taken their own photographs” 
after being tagged with radio-active isotope 
and placed on photographic plates. Radio- 
active zinc has concentrated in the seeds. 
Experiments like these will not enable man to 
dispense with plants for food production, but 
may well mean that food production by plants 
can be greatly improved. (Photos USIS).

### 70137: Isotopes and the hazards of radiation

Unesco Courter, — Nr 12. — 1954 
Geiger counters on ‘the mosquito’'s trail 
(Continued from page 31) 
radio-isotope can be given internally 
or can even be swallowed to find its 
way into the blood stream. It is 
absorbed from the blood by cancerous 
tissue. This is one of the respects in 
which cancer differs from ordinary 
tissue: it does absorb the radic- 
isotope. Consequently, one disease, in 
which the red blood cells are formed 
in such profusion as to clog the blood 
vessels, can be treated by radio-phos- 
phorus which sharply reduces the 
production of red blood cells in the 
body for a period of about a year. 
Isotope’s travels 
N these cases, the powerful rays are 
J| used directly. But there is an entire- 
ly different use of radio-isotopes 
involving small quantities of isotopes 
with very faint radiation, far too weak 
to do any harm, indeed too weak to be 
detected by anything but sensitive spe- 
clalized instruments. These are known 
as tracer isctopes because they reveal 
their presence by their faint radiation, 
wherever they go, no matter through 
what chemical reactions they are put, 
and thus permit their detection at any 
point of their travel or adventures. 
By such means it is possible to follow 
the course of chemical atoms through 
the human body, for instance, and not 
only to locate them physically but to 
detect the chemical changes through 
which they have gone. By far the 
greatest use of radio-isotopes is in this 
new technique of tracing the course of 
mechanical action, of chemical reac- 
tions or biological processes. 
Another example of the direct 
industrial use of the radiations from 
isotopes is the control of the flow of 
o1l through long pipe-lines. Such a line 
can seldom be used for long periods to 
deliver one single grade or variety of 
oll. Instead, different oils are pumped 
through, one after another. It is 
important for the operators at the 
receiving end to know when one grade 
or one shipment is at an end and 
another is to begin in the continuous 
flow of oil from the pipe. 
» 
Radio-active piston ring 
HIS is now done by mixing in a 
T at the bcundary between one 
small quantity of radio-active oil 
hatch and another as they are pumped 
into the pipe. When that radio-active 
cil reaches the receiving station, 
perhaps hundreds of miles away, the 
radiation counters immediately detect 
its arrival so that valves can be adjust- 
ed to shift the flow from one tank into 
another, 
Another example from the ou 
industry illustrates the use of isotopes 
in research. The Shell Petroleum 
Company in England now measures 
friction and engine wear by exposing 
a piston ring to bombardment by 
neutrens until a small part of the iron 
is converted to a radio-active isctope. 
The ring is then fitted in an operating 
engine. As it wears by friction the 
debris goes into the crank case oil and 
that oil is then pumped through a 
sensitive detector of radiation. The 
very small quantity of weakly radio- 
+» TESTING MATERIAL in a special 
‘phosphorus remain 
_ active iron is sufficient to be measur- 
ed and therefore to give an immediate 
indication of the amount of wear on 
the engine. This method of testing 
avoids the long operation of the engine 
and the troublesome analysis of the 
oil for iron, and can show the effect 
of different lubricants within minutes. 
' The California Research Corporation 
reports that in similar researches a 
programme of friction studies that 
would have taken 60 years and cost a 
million docllars was completed in this 
way in four years at a cost of thirty- 
five thousand dollars. Others have 
employed this method to show that.

engine wear that is involved in city 
driving. The end result of these 
researches, however, is the reduction 
of friction and the’ improvement of 
lubrication. 
Even mosquitoes can be traced by 
ragdio-isotopes. Mosquito larvae that 
swim in a very weak solution of radio- 
radio-active all 
through their lives and their presence 
can be detected with Geiger counters. 
The habits of mosquitoes are now 
being studied by this method to learn 
how long they live, how far they fly, 
and what they feed on. It is expected 
that similar treatment of birds may 
give reliable information on bird habits 
and especially on their migrations. 
Another very practical application of 
the tracer technique which has saved 
a large amount of money for the 
farmers is in the study of the action of 
fertilizers. 
For example, phosphate is a neces- 
sary plant food and is a compcnent 
of nearly all fertilizers. It is an easy 
matter to produce the isotope of phos- 
phorus that is weakly radio-active and 
to mix it with the normal phosphate 
in the fertilizer, Since it constantly 
gives off a weak and harmless radiation 
that can be detected by proper instru- 
ments, it is a very simple matter to 
follow or trace what happens to the 
phosphorus in the soil and the plant. 
Important agricultural information 
has thus been obtained. For instance, 
Swedish investigators have found that 
phosphate 1n a fertilizer is taken up 
by the plant roots almost immediately 
when it is spread on the soil; there is 
no delay. American investigators have 
discovered that pasture grasses can 
take up phosphate that is spread over 
their leaves and roots, so that old 
pastures can be rejuvenated by phos- 
phate without the need for ploughing. 
 
Even more interesting is the fact 
that maize, sugar beets, tobacco and 
cotton take up phosphate from the 
fertilizer only during the early stage 
of growth. Fertilizer spread on the 
soil late in the season is of no value 
to these crops. On the other hand, 
potatoes take up phosphate from the 
fertilizer in large quantities through- 
out their entire growing season. 
Finally, it has been found that 
phosphoric acid added to irrigation 
water is just as effective as fertilizer 
spread dry on the soil. All of these 
results were obtained by measuring 
the amount of radio-active phosphorus 
detected in the growing plant. While 
its quantity is small, like the black 
sheep 1n a flock, it can rellably be used 
for measuting the fate of all the 
phosphorus. 
‘Many other tracer elements utilized 
in this manner have given information 
of value to the farmer. Radio-active ’ 
potassium, painted on a branch of a 
dormant plum tree, in weather below 
flieezing point was found to enter the 
sap and move several feet both up and 
- down the branch in spite of the fact

a 
Body rebuilt every year 
thatthe sap is supposed to be motion- 
less in winter. On the other hand, in 
summer the phosphorus moves all the 
way to the roots within twenty-four 
hours. 
Another agricultural application of 
this tracer technique with radio-iso- 
topes is in the study of insects and 
fungi. Radio-iodine has been used to 
study the spread of the oak wilt fungus, 
through the roots and from the roots 
of one oak to another. Insecticides 
also can be tagged with radio-isotopes. 
Thus it has been shown that plant 
leaves absorb insecticides principally 
on their under surface and do so only 
during the day. 
Such work has also emphasized the 
difference between broad-leafed plants 
and narrow-leafed grain and grasses in 
their response to weed-killers. A broad- 
leafed plant was found to absorb a 
weed-killer sprayed upon it and within 
two hours the entire plant is permeated 
with it. On the other hand, the grasses 
absorb very little weed-killer and 
what is absorbed stays on the spot 
  
without affecting the plant as a 
whole. 
One of the first results of the use 
of “tracer” isotopes was the discovery 
that all the tissues in the body are 
in a constant process of replacement. 
It is natural to think of the body as 
a stable structure which uses food only 
to maintain its heat and for replace- 
ment of worn parts. This is not so. 
When fats, in which some of the 
hydrogen atoms have been replaced 
chemically by “heavy hydrogen” are 
eaten, the new fat is deposited in the 
fatty layers of the body while the older 
fats, already in the body, are burned 
for heat. 
So, too, eating proteins which contain 
“heavy nitrogen” results in the use of 
the fresh protein for building body 
tissues, muscles and blood cells, while 
the proteins already present are 
oxidized and excreted. Every part of 
the- body’ is thus constantly being 
rebuilt by a steady exchange of new 
materials from food to replace the 
established materials. 
Every twelve months every human 
GIANT HAND has been built in the United States to enable atomic engineers to carry 
out operations in dangerously radiated chambers without exposing themselves to rays. 
The “O-Man” (contraction of “overhead manipulator”) weighs | 5 tons and can hfe 7,000 |b

Saclay Atomic Energy Research Centre, near Paris, 
to remove “hot” (highly radio-active) materials from 
the Centre's Atomic Pile. Running on rails alongside 
N\ 
or animal body is completely rebuilt. 
Even the bones are thus rebuilt and 
the only exception is the iron, chiefly 
in the red blood cells, which is not 
rapidly replaced by new iron atoms in 
the food. ‘This process is a funda- 
mental to life, but would probably 
never have been discovered without 
the use of tracer isotopes. 
Nature’s secret process 
HE most promising investigation 
of this sort is the study of the 
process by which green plants 
build their substance from the water 
and carbon-dioxide of the air.. This 
reaction is the fundamental one for all 
life since all the green plants depend 
upon it and all other plants and all 
animals depend on the green plants. 
It is apparently a simple reaction in 
which the molecule of water and that 
of carbon-dioxide are combined, lose 
some oxygen, and form sugars, star- 
ches, cellulose, and more involved che- 
mical materials. - 
Nevertheless, no one knows how the 
plant does it and man is unable to 
duplicate the reaction. Buf the avail- 
ability of a faintly radio-active isotope 
of carbon has already given much 
information and may within the next 
year or two explain the reaction 
completely. This will not mean that 
man can dispense with plants for food 
production, but it may well mean that 
the food production by plants can be 
greatly improved once this reaction is 
understood. 
The process involves the formation 
of carbon-dioxide gas from carbon 
which contains a small proportion of 
the radio-active isotope of carbon. 
The product is “heavy carbon-dioxide” 
but is used by plants in the presence of 
sunlight exactly as they use ordinary 
carbon. The result is that the radio- 
active carbon is built into the materials 
of the plant and its presence and 
location in the plant can be detected 
immediately.

the reactor it can withdraw isotopes and other 
materials which have been activated inside, through 
the small square doors seen on left. Its heavy cov- 
ering protects operator from rays. (Photo C.E.A.). 
When the green leaves of certain 
plants were thus exposed to radio- 
active carbon-dioxide for only one" 
minute, at least fifty separate com- 
pounds were found in the leaf, tagged 
with radio-carbon. When the time of 
exposure to sunlight was reduced to 
two seconds, the leaf had - already 
manufactured two or three compounds 
from the carbon-dioxide of the air. 
It turns out that the first products 
made by the plant are compounds of 
phosphoglyceric acid which thus are 
shown to be steps in the manufacture 
of fruit, or grain, or sugar. After two 
minutes of exposure, radio-carbon tests 
showed that even proteins and fats 
already contained the new carbon just 
received from the atmosphere. The de- 
tailed investigations of these reactions 
are now in process and the full mechan- 
ism of this basic plant reaction should 
be understood very soon. 
By studying the process in different 
plants it is now known that the early 
stages of the reaction are identical in 
all plants. Only later does the process 
diverge into the production of com- 
pounds that are characteristic of each 
plant, such as aromas, colours, and 
drugs. In the case of the green algae, 
it has thus been possible to divert the 
reaction among the algae so that either 
a preponderance of sugar or of malic 
acid can form early in the process. 
$100 million saving 
O N this basis, the experiments have 
now been continued to show that 
the same algae which normally 
contain about 50 % of protein can be so 
altered as to produce about 75 % of fat 
instead of protein. In fact, the protein 
content can be varied all the way from 
; TT % to 88 %, while the fat content can 
be changed from 1 % to 15 %. At the 
same time, the carbon-dioxide can ‘be 
changed from 6 % to 38 %. This ob- 
viously opens enormous possibilities 
for changing and increasing the food 
supplies available both to animals and 
to human beings.

LEAD BRICKS are sufficient protection for minor laboratory operations where only low radiation 
strengths are involved. Research worker here is guided by reflection in the mirror, Safety 
precautions in atomic laboratories are not intended to give 1009, protection against radio-active 
radiations, but rather to ensure that any dose received does not exceed a safe level. (Photo USIS). 
These examples are only a few of the 
many thousands of uses of radio-iso- 
topes in research, industry, agriculture 
and medicine. The U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission estimates that the total 
savings accomplished by the use of 
isotopes in these various fields is 
more than $ 100,000,000 a year. Mean- 
while, the sales of isotopes by the Com- 
mission amount to more than $ 500,000 
a year. The European atomic reactors, 
especially those at Windscale and Har- 
well in England, are producing radio- 
isotopes that are sent all over Europe. 
Radio chemists at Amersham have 
achieved results which are distinctive 
and in some instances in advance of 
the American so that air shipments of 
isotopes across the Atlantic are now 
considerable. 
As more reactors are installed and 
the use of atomic energy becomes gene- 
ral throughout the world the produc- 
tion of radio-isotopes will also increase 
with a resulting reduction in their 
price. One can be certain that the ato- 
mic age is only in its infancy and that 
in their impact on history the benefi- 
cial peace-time uses of the atom will 
far exceed their misuse in war.

METAL PRODUCTION plant in Michigan, U.S.A. makes use of a large quantity of radio-active material for an industrial experi- 
ment. Radio-active powdered iron ore was mixed with ordinary powdered ore and fed into a blast furnace, Measurement of 
radio-activity from gases (shown here) helped technicians to decide on suitability of ore in powdered form for smelting iron. 
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS now save time and money by using radio-

exposure to reactor radiations, are placed upon a piston. The piston 1s run for

The magic of the atom is now serving many and varied indus- 
tries. Radio-active materials are being employed in dozens 
of ways for testing and improving industry's products, making 
them faster and easier to produce. Safer drugs and medical 
supplies, better motor oil, better quality plastics, improved 
automobile tyres—these are only a few examples of impro- 
vements which atomic energy can contribute to progress in 
industrial development. As when primitive man first disco- 
vered fire and gradually learned to make its power serve him, 
so men of today gradually are learning how the power of the 
atom can be made to work for them. 
  
  
    
NEW METAL ALLOYS capable of great resistance to heat and corrosion are being sought by metallurgists to aid atomic energy 
development. Success of such research will bring benefits of atomic power more quickly to industry, and the new alloys will 
almost certainly find wide industrial uses. Photomicrography (above) of a uranium alloy is an enlarged picture of an etched cross- 
section of the metal from which a metallurgist can trace the existence of different physical properties (resistance to corrosion, 
mechanical behaviour etc) from local variations in the composition of the alloy. Pencil points to a new “phase” —a sudden appear- 
ance of new physical properties in an alloy produced by changes in the proportions of its chemical components. Such “phases™ 
are clues which guide metallurgists in the production of alloys for special purposes. (Photo USIS).

ly, however, it was an- 
nounced that a £ 12 mil- 
lion industrial nuclear 
reactor is to be built

T is now ten years since the prospect 
I of using atomic energy to develop 
power for light, heat and the work 
of the world began to intrigue scientists 
and governments alike. In 1945, when 
the world adapted once more to a 
relatively peaceful life, it was hoped 
that industrial atomic power would 
become a reality within ten years. 
This has not happened partly because 
international tensions have continued 
the policy of secrecy and partly because 
the engineering problems have been 
enormous. The great strides that have 
been made in the use of nuclear 
reactions and in the design of reactors 
have been by-products of the large 
expenditures for military purposes. 
But in the past three or four years 
attention has shifted to the study of 
industrial power and to the economics 
of the use of nuclear fuels. There has 
not been time enough to provide 
experience for a realistic forecast in 
economic terms, There was, in fact, no 
great hope until the American breeder

, reactor in May 1953, first showed that. 
common and cheap uranium and 
thorium can be used as fuels. That 
fact has greatly advanced practical 
industrial power from the atom. 
The development has gone farthest 
in the United States because of that 
country’s active development of react- 
ors during the war and because of the 
large economic resources it had 
available after the war. Even there, 
however, there is as yet no operating 
atomic power reactor for industrial 
purposes. 
The U.S. has constructed more than 
a score of major reactors, some for 
the manufacture of plutonium and 
uranium-235, some for the intensive 
testing of materials that are to be 
exposed to atomic rays, some to test 
the principle of breeding and most of 
them to test the feasibility of different 
types of reactors, operating on different 
fuels, with different intensity of 
neutron bombardment, with different

methods of cooling and other mo- 
difications. 
In one type, for instance, the fission- 
able uranium is dissolved in water and 
the heat of fission causes the water to 
boil and generate steam directly. In 
another type the uranium is dissolved 
in metallic bismuth. Such experiments 
will continue, but they have already 
produced actual designs for two full- 
size power reactors. 
The first of these has been installed 
in a new type of submarine which 
depends wholly on atomic energy for 
its. motive power, and which was 
launched on January 21, 1954. It 
extracts from a small piece of atomic 
fuel the equivalent of 460,000 gallons 
of fuel oil or 3,000 tons of coal. Consi- 
derations of cost have not entered into 
its construction because the advantages 
of an atomic engine outweigh the cost.

The world atomic power picture 
does not need to return for refuelling 
because the charge of atomic fuel will 
propel the ship for any voyage. The 
keel for a second atomic submarine 
with improved engines has already 
been laid. 
The submarine demonstrates the 
reality of atomic power without cost 
figures. . But experience with its engine 
for two years has now justified the 
construction on the same basic design 
(with enriched uranium as fuel and 
with water under high pressure as 
coolant) of a full-scale atomic power 
plant near Pittsburgh at a cost of 
30 million dollars which will produce 
60,000 kilowatts of electricity—enough 
for a city of 60,000 to 100,000 population. 
Its power will be fed directly into the 
electrical network near Pittsburgh. 
Optimism in the U.S.A. 
HE cost of its power will probably 
T not be as low as that of power 
made from coal, but the U.S. 
Atomic Energy Commission will pay 
five-sixth of the cost of the plant and 
provide the uranium fuel so that the 
Duquesne Light Co. of Pittsburgh will 
buy the steam from the reactor econo- 
mically. This expenditure by the 
government is considered justifiable in 
order to gain experience in actual 
commercial operation on a large scale 
which will make possible the cons- 
truction as soon as possible of another 
plant that should produce power as 
cheaply as it can be made from coal. 
Meanwhile, the American technical 
world is fascinated by a variety of 
atomic projects, with the electrical 
industries taking the lead. Mr. Ralph 
J. Cordiner, President of the gigantic 
General Electric Company has urged 
corporations and private business to 
enter the field, and recently told the 
National Association of Manufacturers:

National Bureau of Standards, Washing- 
ton, would require at least 3,000,000 
years to lose or gain one second. Scien- 
tist on extreme left is holding a model 
of the ammonia molecule whose absorp- 
tion of radio energy provides the inva- 
riant frequency on which clock is based.

“It is our optimistic estimate that by 
1976, 50 % of the new electric power 
facilities being installed will be atomic.” 
General Electric engineers have 
recently calculated that while a coal- 
burning electric plant costs about 
$130 per kilowatt of electrical pro- 
ductive capacity, an atomic plant costs 
from $195 to $215. This additional cost 
is balanced by the fact that the atomic 
fuel cost, including the processing of 
the uranium and the disposal of 
chemical wastes, is only about 0.1 cents 
per kilowatt hour of .electricity pro- 
duced, while the coal cost for a plant of 
similar size is about 0.35 cents. Thus 
the saving in fuel makes up for the 
additional cost of the atomic plant and 
the total cost - 
of electricity 
from the atom 
is 0.67 to 068 
cents a Kkilo- 
watt hour 
compared with 
0.69 cents for 
that from 
coal. . 
It is in such 
an atmosphere 
that the New 
England Re- 
gional Atomic 
Energy Com- 
mittee has 
been organi- 
zed, covering 
the six small 
states in the 
northeastern 
corner of the 
country, which 
have neither 
coal nor oil yet 
are highly in- 
dustrialized. 
Its purpose is to take the first oppor- 
tunity for adopting atomic energy for 
the region. Similarly in the western 
mountain state of Colorado a group of 
four co-operatives engaged in rural 
electrification have begun a campaign 
to obtain the first atomic reactor for 
a small electrical station. 
The attractive calculations of costs 
are based on large plants; small ones 
"will be more expensive to operate. Yet 
many small plants are proposed for 
special purposes. For instance, an able 
physicist, Dr. Lyle B. Borst, of the 
University of Utah, has. published 
designs developed in co-operation with 
five railroad and nine manufacturing 
corporations, for an atom-powered 
locomotive with 7,000 horse power and 
a length of 160 feet. It would cost 
$1,200,000 but its reactor, of the water 
boiler type, would use only 11 pounds 
of uranium in a year’s operation. 
In France, Mr. Louis Armand, 
Director-General of the French Railway 
System, has commented that it would 
be wiser to use a reactor to provide 
power directly to the electrified railroad 
system. This is true where such a 
system exists, as in France and Swit- 
zerland, but the great distances and 
lack of electrification in other countries 
make the nuclear locomotive a real 
possibility. ' 
For other isolated stations that 
require power the U.S. Army has 
already awarded a contract for the 
design -and construction of a 2,000 
kilowatt nuclear-power, plant to cost 
 
ELECTRIC BULB was lighted for the first time by

about $2,000,000 which is to be so 
constructed that none of its constituent 
parts is too large or heavy to be 
carried by airplane. A plant of that 
size would be adequate to serve a 
community of 2,000 persons and could 
be carried intact to outlying military 
posts, such as those in the Arctic, to 
provide power, light and heat. 
This is what has been called the 
“package power reactor”, referred to by 
M. Jules Moch before the U.N. General 
Assembly. (See page 13.). If it is 
successful it may well be.a model for 
the small reactors in many countries. 
It could, for instance, be flown to desert 
areas to serve pumps for irrigation 
from underground streams, or to 
: coastal deserts 
for the pro- 
duction of 
fresh water 
from the sea. 
The interna- 
tional atomic 
energy agency 
will probably 
stimulate such 
uses. 
The 220 
pounds of ato- 
mic fuel that 
the US. has 
promised to 
provide 
through the 
international 
agency, plus 
the 44 pounds 
offered by the 
British Go- 
vernment, 
would be suf- 
ficient to 
provide fuel 
for some 15 
research reactors in different countries. 
The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission 
is continuing its expensive researches 
"into still newer types of reactors and 
has authorized the construction of five 
in addition to the score already in 
operation. They are of two major 
types, one of which uses water as the 
coolant and the other liquid metal. 
Among them are the “homogeneous” 
reactor in which the fuel is dissolved 
in a liquid that acts both as moderator 
and as coolant and the “fast breeder” 
reactor which is compact and operates 
at high temperature. The investment 
of many millions of dollars by the 
government in a wide variety of ex- 
perimental reactors is expected within 
a few years to result in a practicable, 
reliable and economic design for in- 
dustrial reactors. : 
The Chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Commission, Admiral Louis S. Strauss 
has recently said “Our children will 
enjoy in their homes electrical energy 
too cheap to meter”. He has also said 
that by a conservative estimate, only ° 
five years from now 10 % of the new 
American power plants will use atomic 
energy instead of coal, oil or gas and 
that by 1980 half of them will do so. 
“Such optimism is impressive because it’ 
is made in a country where coal, oil 
and natural gas are all plentiful and 
cheap and where atomic fuels face 
severe cost competition. One may 
conclude that in countries where these 
ordinary fuels are expensive or must 
be transported over long distances the 
atomic age cannot be far off.

### 70138: Nuclear power in industry; how close are we?

POCKET REACTOR was built by the 
North Carolina State College, U.S.A. to 
train engineers in the use of atomic 
energy. Reaction, obtained from ura- 
nium-235 contained in the cylinder, 
starts when two of the rods in the 
can are lifted by remote control. 
Canadian atomic research and pro- 
duction have been closely related to 
that of the United States for more 
than ten years, especially in the pro- 
duction of uranium ores and the manu- 
facture of uranium. Aside from a 
pilot model, the only Canadian reactor 
is a large one at Chalk River, with an 
energy-output of 30,000 kilowatts and 
a neutron flow of 60 million million 
neutrons per square centimeter. It 
has probably -been the world’s most 
powerful reactor using natural ura- 
nium, and produced large quantities of 
highly active radio-isotopes for use in 
commerce and research. It was in 
operation for more than five years, 
from 1947 to 1952 when it was taken 
apart for repairs after an accident. 
A second large reactor, now being 
built and due for completion in 1955, 
will cost more than $30,000,000. It will 
be more powerful than the first, will 
use heavy water as a coolant and is 
designed to permit nuclear engineering 
‘studies for a future power-producing 
reactor. Three large Canadian electric 
power companies and the Ontario 
Hydro-Electric Commission are asso- 
ciated in the project, though it is 
controlled by a crown corporation, 
Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd. This 
is in the expectation that future ato- 
mic power generators should be in the 
hands of the producers and distributors 
of electric power. 
Confidence in Britain 
HE development of atomic power is 
more urgent in Britain than in 
the U.S. or Canada because the 
exhaustion of easily workable British 
coal mines is already noticeable. As 
a result the cost of coal is slowly 
increasing and it is officially estimated 
that there may be a deficit of twenty 
million tons in the British coal supply 
by 1965. 
Work on atomic energy did not begin 
in England until 1946, however, all 
British efforts having been combined 
with those of the U.S. and Canada in 
North America during the war. That 
year saw the beginning both of the 
research station at Harwell under the 
direction of Sir John Cockcroft and 
the production division, with head- 
  
PACKAGED POWER PLANT: An exhibit on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, pre- 
pared by the United, States Government, has recently been on display at United Nations 
Headquarters in New York. Taken from the exhibition is this model of a “package” 
atomic power plant. Broken down into sections, 1t could be taken by air to a remote 
site where regular fuels are unobtainable or too expensive to transport. The plant could 
provide electricity for a mining community or pump water to arid zones, and a single 
Plane could carry enough atomic fuel to run it for several years, (U.N. photos.)

. quarters at Risley, under Sir Christo- 
pher Hinton. The first research reac- 
tor was built at Harwell while a plant 
for the manufacture of uranium from 
Australian and African ores was built 
at Springfields. Two reactors, side by 
side, for the production of plutonium 
from uranium were begun at Sellafield 
on the Cumberland coast in 1947, 
By May 1953, confidence in the pos- 
sibilities of power prodiction was 
sufficient to justify the start of a full- 
scale industrial power reactor at Calder 
Hall, adjoining the Sellafield plant.- It 
is now in construction and is expected 
to be in operation in 1956. It is de- 
signed to produce 50,000 kilowatts of 
power and has a distinctive cooling 
system which utilizes carbon dioxide 
under pressure to carry the heat to the 
steam boilers. 
It will probably be the world’s first 
large-scale power reactor to reach the 
operating stage. No cost figures are 
available but Sir Christopher Hinton 
has stated that “a cost analysis does 
not suggest that the price of electricity 
generated from atomic energy will 
make it uncompetitive” with electricity 
from coal. And the British scientific 
weekly, Nature, has- expressed the opi- 
nion that “by the time such a station 
could be brought into operation, techni- 
cal and economic developments would 
give nuclear power very considerable 
economic advantages.” 
A breeder reactor has been in re- 
search operation at Harwell for some 
time and the construction at Dounreay, 
in Caithness, Scotland, of a large 
breeder reactor, which should greatly 
reduce costs, has been authorized. In 
justifying the government plans, Sir 
David Eccles, Minister of Works, em- 
phasized the need of training men 
who would design, construct and ope- 
rate reactors not only for Britain and 
the Commonwealth but for {friendly 
countries the world over. 
Progress in Russia 
N July 2, 1954, Soviet News publish- 
O ed a “Statement by the Council 
of Ministers of the U.S.SR.” 
which read : ) 
“Work on the design and construc- 
tion of the first industrial power station 
run on atomic energy, with a useful 
capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, has been 
successfully completed in the Soviet 
Union, by the efforts of Soviet scientists 
and engineers. On June 27th, 1954, an 
atom-driven power station was put 
into operation and generated electri- 
city for the use of industry and agri- 
culture in the neighbouring districts. 
For the first time an industrial turbine 
is working, not on coal or some other 
fuel, but on atomic energy—the product 
of fission of the nucleus of the ura- 
nium atom. By putting the atom- 
driven power station into operation, a 
real step forward has been taken in 
the utilization of atomic energy for 
peaceful purposes.” 
Speaking to the “First Committee” 
of the U.N. General Assembly on No- 
vember 12, 1954, the Soviet delegate, 
the late Andrei Y. Vishinsky, repeated 
this announcement and added: 
“There are no obstacles in the Soviet 
Union to the further successful and 
rapid progress along this path of uti- 
lization of atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes and the implantation of these 
methods throughout our economy...

IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS has been made during the past ten years in applying the forces of nuclear 
fission to peaceful and constructive uses, thus opening up to our own future generations an ever- 
expanding prospect of material betterment. After having been rendered radio-active in nuclear 
reactors (above, left), 1sotopes have been put to work on a thousand tasks for medicine, industry 
and agriculture. Great strides have been made in the design of reactors and in the use of nuclear 
reactions. More than a score of major reactors, such as the one at Brookhaven National Labo- 
duction of atomic energy, is profoundly 
interested in the utilization of this new 
type of energy for peaceful purposes 
and for the well-being of our people 
because this kind of utilization of ato- 
mic energy, by countries which are 
prepared broadly and extensively to 
use it for peaceful ends, would open 
wide, tremendous prospects of a vast 
growth of productive forces, technolo- 
gical and cultural progress, and the 
increased well-being of society.” 
The historic succession of disting- 
uished research physicists in France, 
and the fact that France itself has 
large uranium deposits and very large 
deposits of thorium in Madagascar plus 
its diminishing coal reserves, have all 
been factors in the French atomic 
energy programme. A small research 
reactor was established at Chatillon, a 
suburb of Paris in 1948. A second, 
larger one at Saclay, near Paris, has 
been in operation since 1952, using 
pure metallic uranium in a moderating 
bath of heavy water. It was designed 
for an energy output of 1,000 kilowatts 
but delivers more, and may be improv- 
ed to reach 2,000. 
A pilot plant in the Rhone valley for 
a reactor that will produce 50 to 100 
grammes of plutonium per day has also 
been planned. This is preliminary to 
the construction, also in the Rhone 
44 
valley, of two large reactors that will 
each generate between 50,000 and 
100,000 kilowatts and will produce at 
least 75 pounds of plutonium a year, 
which will, in turn, permit the develop- 
ment of nuclear engines for marine 
vessels. The official expectation is 
that there may be industrial utilization 
of atomic energy in France within four 
to eight years, but that its use by cen- 
tral electric power stations is perhaps 
still a dozen years away. 
The approach of various nations to 
the atomic energy problem varies with 
their own needs and resources. Nor- 
way’s is influenced by the fact that it 
is the world’s largest producer of heavy 
water, which is made by the repeated 
electrolysis of ordinary -water with the 
use of very large quantities of electric 
power from the Norwegian hydro-elec- 
tric installations. While heavy water 
is an effective moderator for some 
reactors its price is about $560 a pound, 
or close to $1 a drop. A reduction in 
the price is needed for larger-scale use, 
and Switzerland, Israel, Italy, India 
and New Zealand have all been consi- 
dering its production. 
In 1951, Norway had under construc- 
tion a reactor to use its heavy water, 
but it had no uranium. Meanwhile 
Holland had several tons of uranium 
on hand that had been farsightedly 
purchased when uranium fission first 
became a possibility. The two Govern- 
ments therefore organized the Nor- 
wegian-Dutch Joint Establishment for 
Nuclear Energy Research at Kjeller, 
Norway, under the direction of Dr. 
Gunnar Randers. It is supported by 
- the two Governments through their 
Research Councils and scientists of the 
two countries work side by side. The 
Norwegian firm, Norsk Hydro, which 
produces the heavy water, supplied 
about half the money for the construc- 
tion of the first reactor and has a 
contract with the Norwegian Govern- 
ment for further work on the develop- 
ment of atomic energy. Both Dutch 
and Norwegian industries are supply- 
ing funds and obtaining rights for fu- 
ture energy exploitation. 
A 300 kilowatts reactor has been in 
operation for almost three years for 
the production of radio-isotopes and 
for studying the feasibility of using 
heavy water. Within a few years a 
reactor using natural uranium with 
heavy water as the moderator will be 
built to produce steam at about 250 
degrees centigrade and to give from 
5,000 to 10,000 kilowatts of power. 
Dr. Randers, speaking before the Eco- 
nomic Society of Norway recently, 
stressed his opinion that without the 
use of atomic energy as a source of

ratory, from which workers are shown removing “spent” uranium (above, right) have been built 
in the United States. - But in the past four years, attention has shifted to the study of industrial power. 
Here again, so much progress has been made that authorities in the United States have declared 
that in twenty years time half the new electric power facilities then being installed will be atomic. 
Scientists say this is only a beginning. They believe the use of atomic energy materials will increase 
tenfold or more in the next few years. (Photos Edison Electric Institute and USIS,) 
power, the world’s population will by 
the end of this century be faced with a 
power deficiency that will lead to 
stagnation or to a lowering of the 
general standard of living. In England 
Josiah Eccles of the British Electricity 
Authority made a suggestion pertinent 
to Norway—that countries with surplus 
hydro-electric power should use it to 
concentrate and purify fissionable fuels 
such as uranium for export to regions 
with power shortages. 
Sweden has been producing uranium 
for some time and is now increasing its 
production from the deposits of oil- 
shale at Karnstorp which contain 
lumps of kolm, a hydrocarbon that 
contains as much as 3,000 grammes of 
uranium per ton. Sweden has one 
small reactor of 100 kilowatts capacity 
which uses three to four tons of ura- 
nium. It is .built in Stockholm in a 
special underground chamber hewn out 
of bedrock. A 10,000 kilowatts reactor 
is to be built by A.B. Atomenergi Co. of 
which the Government owns 57% and 
fifteen private firms own the remain- 
der. Officials do not believe that ato- 
mic energy will be competitive. with 
water power in Sweden until all the 
nation’s hydro-electric sources have 
been put to use, which will presumably 
be in about twenty years. 
Belgium has long been the world’s 
major producer of uranium from its 
great Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian 
Congo. The uranium has been shipped 
in large quantities to the United States 
since 1944 under a ten years contract. 
Negotiations on this question have been 
going on between the Belgian and U.S. 
Governments. Belgium wants to re- 
ceive technical information on the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy and 
nuclear material produced in American 
plants that could be so used. 
Belgium is now building an experi- 
mental reactor at Mol intended pri- 
marily to train personnel and secure 
operating experience. It should be in 
operation early in 1956, providing 2,000 
kilowatts of power. This reactor is 
being financed “without intervention of 
the Treasury or of private industry, in 
accordance with arrangements of an 
international nature”, said Pierre de 
Ryckmans, Commissioner for Atomic 
Energy. Presumably this refers to a 
new agreement with the U.S. Atomic 
Energy Commission. 
Belgium has also signed an agree- 
ment with the Swiss Government 
whereby small amounts of uranium 
from Belgian ores will he supplied to 
Switzerland along with the exchange 
of information and experience in the 
operation of reactors. The Swiss ex- 
pect to begin construction of a power

loped, nuclear energy electricity generat- 
ing systems should operate with smaller 
fuel supplies—a major factor in the 
prospect of developing atomic power,

within a year. It will use natural 
uranium and heavy water and will be 
classified at 10,000 kilowatts. It is one 
of the few that will be privately financ- 
ed and controlled, being built by three 
Swiss electrical manufacturing corpo- 
rations. In Geneva, Switzerland also 
is host to the large new research ins- 
tallation now being built by the Euro- 
pean Centre for Nuclear Research. 
This, however, while it will have the 
world’s most powerful synchro-cyclo- 
tron, will have no réactors nor fission- 
able materials and has no direct 
concern with the production and uses 
. of atomic energy. 
. 
Latin American prospects 
LL work on atomic energy was 
banned in West Germany by the 
Allies at the end of the war. 
‘Nevertheless, the Max Planck Institute 
of Gottingen has processed and dis- 
tributed radio-isotopes that are flown 
in from Harwell in England. The 
mining of uranium, with Allied per- 
mission, is now also under way in the 
deposits in the Black Forest and the 
Fichte] Mountains. Very recently four 
major German industrial concerns 
have formed a group with 12 others to 
build an atomic reactor of 10,000 kilo- 
watts. It is expected to cost $5,000,000 
and ‘will operate under severe res- 
trictions intended as military safe- 
guards. 
There are as yet no reactors in Latin 
America, but a representative of the 
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission has 
reported on the basis of an extended 
trip that uranium is as plentiful as lead 
in much of Latin America’s subsoil so 
, 
that some Latin America countries, 
using their own uranium, can expect 
to base their industrial revolution on 
atomic power. Brazil, however, has at 
Niteroi, across the bay from Rio de 
Janeiro, a Centre of Physical Research 
attached to the University of Brazil. 
Its cyclotron has been operating for 
some years. This development is an 
outgrowth of a United Nations Technic- 
al Assistance mission to assist in the 
installation of cosmic ray observatories 
in Bolivia. One of the experts, Dr. Ugo 
Camerini, of Italy, remained in Brazil 
to become chief of the Centre’s de- 
partment of physics. 
Recently these nuclear studies de- 
veloped into government approval for 
the establishment of an uranium 
treatment plant at Pocos de Caldas, a 
spa in the state of Minas Gerais. Ac- 
cording to Admiral Alvaro Alberto, 
President of the Brazilian National 
Council for Scientific Research, work 
will begin within three years on the 
construction of a pilot reactor to use 
nuclear fuel produced at Pocos de 
Caldas. This is the first step toward a 
later Brazilian programme for the 
production of atomic power for indus- 
trial use, 
There have also been reports in the 
press that Argentina has developed an 
atomic energy pilot plant with a nu- 
clear reactor at Huemul Island, but 
this has not been officially confirmed. 
One of the major problems of the in- 
ternational atomic energy agency will 
be the assignment of priorities for 
atomic power development. This will 
involve large decisions of policy as to 
need and successful prospects of de- 
velopment but one of the members of 
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, 
Mr. Thomas E. Murray, is already on 
record as favouring a priority to Japan 
which as yet has no nuclear power de- 
velopments. Speaking to a Convention 
of the United Steel Workers of America, 
one of the major labour unions, 
Mr, Murray recommended that the 
building of a nuclear power plant 
in Japan should be high on the 
agenda” of the American Govern- 
ment. He was speaking in Octo- 
ber prior to the discussion of the Uni- 
ted Nations Agency. He urged that 
America should express its intentions 
and must “give by action and not by 
words alone clear and tangible proof of 
our own determination to channel the 
energy of the atom as soon as possi- 
ble into peaceful and constructive 
paths”. : 
India is rich in nuclear raw materials 
in the enormous deposits of monazite 
sand on the shores of Travancore. 
These deposits contain at least a 
million tons of thorium in a form that 
is easily extracted, and widely scattered 
minerals of uranium. The Government 
is so conscious of the value of these 
materials for India’s future as an in- 
dustrial country that the export of 
thorium and uranium ores, as well as 
those of beryllium, has been sharply 
restricted. A plant for the extraction 
of both uranium and thorium from 
monazite is in operation at Alwaye in 
Travancore-Cochin State and a second 
plant at Trombay, near Bombay, will 
be in operation by May 1955. 
Similarly, the Indian Government is 
advancing the production of heavy 
water at Bagkra Nangal where large 
amounts of cheap power are available 
and where five to six tons of heavy 
water can be produced per year as a 
by-product for the production of 
250,000 tons of fertilizer. The construe- 
tion of an atomic reactor lies in the 
future after the preliminary stages of 
the production of uranium, thorium 
and heavy water. Nevertheless, India 
plans to have her first atomic reactor 
in operation by 1958 and adequate 
funds have been made available by the 
Government to the Indian Atomic 
Energy Commission. 
India looks ahead 
N November 26 and 27, a two-day 
Conference on the Development of 
Atomic Energy for Peaceful Pur- 
poses in India was held at New Delhi, 
and attended by Prime Minister Nehru, 
Dr. H.J. Bhabha and some hundred 
scientists. Closing the Conference, the 
Prime Minister stated that India has a 
formal agreement with France which 
has yielded good results in that young 
Indians are being trained in France for 
work on atomic energy development in 
India. There is also a limited agree- 
ment with the U.S, and informal 
agreements with Norway and Sweden. 
“It 1s beginning to be realized by 
people all over”, said the Prime Mi- 
nister, “that something rather basic in 
Juman experience has been happening 
in connexion with all that has gone on 
in recent years in regard to the de- 
velopment of atomic energy. It is 
something which gives you some 
glimpses... into all kinds of secret forces 
of nature. But this tremendous power 
suddenly opened out for human use... 
can be used for good or evil... it there- 
fore becomes necessary for us to try to 
understand it, to try to train our people 
in it, and try not to lag behind in this 
process.”

‘UNDER WAY ON 
NUGLEAR POWER’ 
The use of nuclear power for the propulsion of 
ocean-going vessels became a reality recently 
when a U.S. atom-powered submarine, the 
Nautilus, began its sea trials and its captain 
signalled: *Under way on nuclear power.” Costs 
must be reduced, however, before this form of 
propulsion can become commercially practical. 
Photos on this page show some aspects of the 
development of atomic marine engines in the 
United States. (I) The prototype of the 
reactor which drives the Nautilus being tested

Idaho desert. Reactor was generating power 
when this photo was taken. (2) The same 
power-plant seen through the door of the 
testing station. (3) The Nautilus being fitted

nounced in August of 1945 from 
TS atomic bomb erupted unan- 
behind an impenetrable wall of 
"military secrecy. The world was totally 
unprepared. Since then every nation 
has been revising its military and 
political plans to adjust to the global 
consequences of that explosion. The 
peaceful uses of the power of the atom 
have been slower in coming and their 
consequences will also be less sudden. 
Yet in the perspective of history the 
effects will be both large and relatively 
rapid. 
The new products of science and its 
major ideas have always in the past 
had far-reaching influence on man’s 
way of life and on the social structure, 
particularly during the rapid progress of 
the past century. Ages ago it was the 
invention of the smelting of bronze and 
iron from their minerals, or it was the 
proof that the earth is a sphere, or the 
invention of gunpowder, that led to 
large political, geographical and social 
readjustments. 
The era of machines was made pos- 
sible by Sir Isaac Newton’s exposition 
of the principles of mechanics. Less 
than a century ago Charles Darwin 
changed human ideas everywhere by 
his theory of evolution. It was the 
invention of the steam engine and 
the railroad, then the electric motor, 
then the internal combustion engine 
and the automobile that led to the ~ 
development of great cities—and the 
word “civilization” comes from the 
Latin word for city. Still more re- 
cently, medical advances have increas- 
ed the average length of life from 
some 30 years to almost 70 in the 
scientifically more advanced countries. 
Idea of the century 
AcH of thes: developments has 
changed the very structure of 
society, and has altered human 
culture, education and even the attitude 
toward religion. Such changes are the 
combined effect of the new things and 
devices, of new practices in industry, 
medicine and agriculture, and of new 
philosophical ideas. Together they 
are the most powerful of all the forces

that continually change life and so- 
ciety, and speed social evolution. 
In this century the basic new idea 
is Einstein’s theory of relativity. This 
has as yet hardly begun to influence 
popular thinking. But its greatest 
consequence today is the fact that, as 
Einstein predicted, matter and energy 
are not two separate, immutable com- 
ponents of the universe but that they 
can by proper means be changed one 
into the other, 
This is probably the most revolu- 
tionary idea that has come from 
the mind of man in all the centuries. 
It was a mathematical theory, generally 
disregarded, until Otto Hahn and F. 
Strassmann in Germany in 1939, con- 
ducting esoteric experiments with 
single atoms of uranium, showed that 
these atoms, when struck by neutrons, 
explode with the annihilation of about 
1 % of their matter and the corres- 
ponding generation of an almost 
incredible energy. 
Fear—and its antidote 
second great World War began 
s0 that the experiment was almost 
unnoticed by a frantic world. Yet in 
the records of history it will probably 
appear as far more important than the 
war itself. It proved that Einstein was 
right. Only three years later at the 
University of Chicago a group headed 
by the Italian Professor Enrico Fermi 
was generating energy on a respectable 
scale by this method and three more 
years later the atomic bomb, based on 
the same principle, made all the world 
realize that a new era had begun. 
T Har was the year in which the 
If science is the most powerful force 
acting on society, then Einstein's idea 
that energy can be created out of 
matter is now the primary force for 
change in man’s way of life and in his 
attitude toward the universe. This will 
become evident during the next fifty 
years, perhaps by the end of the 
century—and that means within the 
period when our present youth and 
children will inherif the earth. 
Science enforces social change. Yet 
to the human mind change is seldom 
welcome. It is opposed because it is 
feared and feared because it is not 
understood. The fear of the atomic 
bomb is universal and hysterical. The 
fear of the beneficent atom will develop 
later when its consequent social chan- 
ges become evident. Governments may 
decree that such changes are desirable 
and will result in improved living for 
more people. So they will, probably. 
But if means are not taken in advance 
to safeguard the individual persons 
who will be displaced or whose lives 
will be changed, evil results will 
accompany the good. 
It cannot be forgotten that the 
industrial revolution that followed the 
invention of the steam engine created 
appalling social conditions in England 
a century and a half ago, chiefly 
because no one foresaw the inevitable 
developments. This time consequences 
must be foreseen. Above all, the 
element of fear must be reduced or 
eliminated. 
Since fear is usually fear of, the 
unknown, the preventative of fear is 
education. The United Nations project 
for the wide use of atomic energy and 
materials must consider well the 
experience in the work of Technical 
Assistance to underdeveloped countries, 
namely that new powers, new methods 
and new wealth cannot be imposed by 
the donation of machines and facilities, 
however precious, unless they are 
understood and are welcomed by a 
people that ynderstands them and 
wants both. them and their con- 
sequences. 
Science-conscious world 
HE atomic power project is there- 
fore not merely a matter of 
placing great nuclear reactors in 
countries that need more energy and 
more wealth. It requires not merely 
the education of scientists and en- 
_ gineers. Even more it needs a prelimi- 
nary programme that may require years 
*> but must prepare the minds and the 
hearts of the peoples who are to receive

its benefits for the changes that are 
to come. 
Such education of the public, and 
particularly of the adult public, in furn 
means much more than explaining 
atomic energy. In a sense it will, in 
many lands, require what amounts to 
a cultural revolution. 
It will involve first the adoption of 
the scientific attitude of mind which 
is in its essence one of welcoming a 
problem to be solved—whether it be a 
problem in mathematics,” mechanics or 
science, whether it be a problem in 
economics, world trade or in relations 
between social classes or between 
nations. In an unscientific culture a 
problem of whatever sort is often the 
occasion for despair, for violence or for 
prayer. Theh 2 problem is a thing to 
be avoided because the answer seldom 
comes with it. 
But the scientific mind thrives on 
problems, analyses them, attempts one 
solution after another until the answer 
is found, usually on the basis of past 
experience or general principles. In 
science most problems eventually— 
though sometimes only after extended 
and patient effort—find a satisfactory 
answer, Thus scientists typically wel- 
come a problem as a challenge to their 
intelligence, as an inspiration to their 
best thought. Such an attitude will 
certainly be needed in the face of the 
enormous possibilities that are in- 
herent in the atomic project.

ECONDLY, an economy based on 
S atomic energy must certainly adopt 
what is often called the scientific 
method but which is in fact the simple 
method of experiment. Its first im- 
pulse is to “try it and see”, if possible 
on a small scale, in order to test 
whether the idea, explanation or 
project is correct or feasible. In the 
dawn of the atomic age there will be 
numberless concepts and plans in 
engineering, public works, legal mea- 
sures and social readjustments, whose

consequences cannot be foreseen for 
lack of experience. It will be the part 
of wisdom to test such ideas experi- 
mentally and to adopt a conclusion or 
a plan after such tests and not hastily 
under pressure of emotion or prejudice. 
Such considerations are cultural. 
They imply not the substitution of 
science for an unscientific culture but 
the integration of scientific attitudes 
with cultural ideas that have come 
down through the centuries, largely 
untouched by science. In many in- 
dustrial countries scientific ideas have 
perhaps been all too dominant so that 
ethical principles and spiritual ideas 
have faded. A synthesis would there- 
fore be desirable on both sides. If this 
is so, a profound revival of values-is 
everywhere desirable. 
If the atomic age is to be one of 
plenty, of good living and of benefits 
both broad and deep in all nations, it 
must be accompanied by a revision of 
education in all countries, both ad- 
vanced and underdeveloped, which 
must start in the primary schools—in-

deed in the home and hence must start 
even further back with the re- 
education of parents and teachers. 
If, under the incentive of the 
development of atomic power science 
thus achieves a place in older cultures 
and the scientific attitude and scien- 
tific method become a part of popular 
thought, then the practical facts of 
life will also result in the assimilation 
of a host of incidental concepts and of 
new words. Matter and energy, space 
and time, will be discussed with 
precision, in poetry and in prose. The 
concept of velocity, as a change of 
position in space in relation to the time 
elapsed, will be commonplace. 
From proteins to genetics 
HE difference between quantities 
T and rates will not always need 
to be explained by scientific 
writers—such as the difference bet- 
ween a kilowatt and a kilowatt hour 
or the difference between calories and 
horse-power. Such simple words from 
the world of science will be commonly 
understood when energy and power 
are everywhere supplied to remote 
farms by transmission lines from the 
atomic reactors. Common also will be 
the understanding of what electricity 
is, and electrons, solutions, proteins, vi- 
tamins and hormones. The principles 
of heredity and genetics will be 
understood to the great benefit of race 
relations. 
Large principles, such as evolution, 
celestial mechanics, the nature of the - 
planets and the origin of the earth, 
will all merely be background for 
human studies, not academic specia- 
lities limited to the erudite. Such 
topics will be part of the curriculum of 
the primary schools and it is in 
learning the facts and the logic on 
which they are based that children and 
adults will learn the methods and mode 
of thought of science. 
Job for the State? 
F this seems visionary it is because 
the time is still far off. Yet it must 
come if the human race is de- 
mocratically to solve such problems as 
the atomic age will certainly bring— 
problems such as how to grow enough 
food to support the workers that the 
atomic industries will require; how to 
provide water to the arid zones so that 
the population can thrive and use the 
electric power that can easily be 
brought there; how to provide medical 
care to large populations that atomic 
energy will make possible; how to 
distribute the wealth that great atomic 
industries will create and that auto- 
matic factories, perhaps, will convert 
into tangible goods; how and by what 
steps 1t will be possible to increase the 
standard of living. 
50 
These are problems that each nation 
must solve for itself. There will be 
diverse answers. An example is in the 
statement of Prime Minister Nehru of 
India who said, in opening the Confer- 
ence on the Development of Atomic 
Energy for Peaceful Purposes in India, 
on November 26: “No State can allow 
atomic energy to be developed in a 
private way—it is much too dangercus 
a thing for a private agency to 
develop... it is six years ago that we 
envisaged the development of atomic 
energy and stated that this is the 
exclusive responsibility of the State.” 
On the contrary, the same problems 
have led the United States during the 
past year to deprive the Government 
of its former exclusive monopoly, 
precisely because it was considered 
much too large a responsibility to be 
left to a central authoritative group but 
should be broadly developed through 
the various venturesome ideas of 
private groups. 
There are even larger questions that 
will arise. As countries profit from 
ample energy and thus increase 
their productivity and reduce the cost 
of their goods, there will be in- 
creased competition in the inter- 
national markets and radical re- 
adjustments in international trade. 
These, in turn, will lead to new 
tensions between States. And finally, 
in all countries increased production 
will mean more things and more money 
but it will also mean more free time 
for the workers. 
industrial In the hard-working 
countries this payment of profits in 
time rather than in money will present 
a major problem. It will, however, be 
an unequalled opportunity for the 
development of a true culture based 
on the assurance of an adequate income 
in things and in money—plus time to 
enjoy them. In the non-industrial 
countries, where leisure has often been 
more prevalent than money, it will 
present a problem of maintaining the 
values of a leisurely life while letting 
the engines and the machines do the 
bulk of the work. 
After such a brief review of the 
prospect it is no longer startling to 
speak of -a revolution in the world’s 
work and in its way of life. Perhaps 
the term should be “rapid evolution”, 
not quite so fast as a revolution. In 
any case, one’s vision must go far 
beyond mere nuclear physics and the 
technology of reactors. It is obvious 
that the coming atomic age requires 
foresight not merely from physicists 
and engineers but also from educators, 
social scientists and exponents ot 
culture. It requires not only foresight 
but planning and action, lest the 
revolution overwhelm us. This great 
development must be guided for the 
benefit of mankind. 
World plan for progress 
NDER its charter, UNEsco faces a 
new challenge long before it has 
solved the problems of the pre- 
sent. Every department of UNEsco will 
be concerned in the development of the 
atomic age and the special functions of 
the World Health Organization and the 
Food and Agriculture Organization will 
also be needed. The Specialized Agen- 
cies of the United Nations will there- 
fore welcome a new Agency when it is 
created and will be prepared for the 
sake of their member states to co- 
operate in the discussion, the planning 
and the operation of a programme for 
world development that is inherent in 
the programme for the peaceful uses 
of atomic energy. :
