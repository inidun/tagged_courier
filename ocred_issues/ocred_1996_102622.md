NEW TREATY TO COMBAT 
ILLEGAL ART TRADE 
A big step forward in the struggle against 
art trafficking has been taken with the 
adoption of a new international Convention 
designed by the Rome-based International 
Institute for the Unification of Private 
Law (UNIDROIT). The Convention, which 
was adopted on 24 June 1995, comple- 
ments UNESCO's 1970 Convention on the 
Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the 
Hlicit Import, Export and Transfer of 
Ownership of Cultural Property. Whereas 
the UNESCO Convention is applicable at 
the intergovernmental level, the 
UNIDROIT Convention is directed at the 
art market. It requires, for example, art 
dealers to enquire fully about an object’s 
past ownership and also fills a legal 
vacuum which hindered the restitution of 
stolen properties to their owners. The 
Convention was approved by delegates 
from 70 countries and will enter into force 
0 months after ratification by 5 countries. 
ECOTECHNOLOGIES FOR 
TOMORROW 
From 4 to 8 February 1996, UNESCO orga- 
nized an ecotechnology workshop in 
Madras (India). Among the participants 
were the American agricultural scientist 
Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1970, and the Indian 
agronomist M.S. Swaminathan. The ques- 
tions discussed included the conservation 
of natural resources and the development 
of ecotechnologies.

APPEAL BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF UNESCO 
FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE PEACE PROCESS 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
Peace is proclaimed in treaties but made in the hearts and minds of peoples. The 
premise on which UNESCO is founded remains as true as when it was affirmed fifty 
years ago following “the great and terrible war . . . made possible by the denial 
of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, 
and by the propagation in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the 
doctrine of the inequality of men and races.” 
The Israeli and Palestinian peoples, sustained by the political vision and 
courage of their leaders, are engaged in an historic process of reconciliation 
aimed at bringing to an end long years of bloodshed and injustice and laying the 
foundations for the construction of a culture of peace within their societies, 
their territories and their region. | 
At this time when their commitment to peace is being so cruelly tested, I 
appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples not to be deflected from their course 
by the terrorist’s blind savagery. Let the actions of the extremists be seen for 
what they arc—impotence in the face of the peace process, an attack on peace 
itself that is a challenge not only for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples but for 
all the countries concerned. | 
Such outrages must not be allowed to prompt a return to the vicious circle 
of retaliatory violence. The firmest measures must be taken to stamp out ter- 
rorism—which is why I strongly support current initiatives to co-ordinate action 
against terrorism in the region. We must show that our vision of peace with jus- 
tice is stronger and more enduring than any sectarian doctrine of hatred and 
exclusion. Let peace be our common combat and shared victory. 
Linvite all those men and women who share the conviction expressed in this 
Appeal to manifest their steadfast commitment to the peace process in the Middle 
East by writing to me at UNESCO.

JACQUES DELORS, 
* former French Minister of the 
Economy and Finance, was 
President of the Commission of 
the European Communities from 
1985 to 1995. His published 
works include Le nouveau concert 
européen (1992) and Qur Europe: 
france and the European Future 
(1994). 
  
[n 1993, UNESCO set up an independent International Commission on Education for 
the 21st century, chaired by Mr. Jacques Delors. The Commission, whose members 
(see inside back cover) and advisors were drawn from the major world regions, has 
now completed its work. Here Mr. Delors presents for Courier readers a roundup of 
the main issues studied by the Commission and previews some of its conclusions. 
On the eve of the twenty-first century, 
intense thought and discussion are being 
devoted to the future of human society. 
Whereas advances in knowledge, especially in 
science and technology, bring hope of 
progress for humankind in the future, events 
each day remind us how the contemporary 
world is liable to drift off course, how exposed 
itis to dangers, in some cases extreme dangers, 
and how vulnerable it is to conflicts. 
The increasing interdependence of peoples 
and nations, which is the hallmark of our time, 
is providing scope for unprecedented interna- 
tional co-operation. But the emergence of this 
global consciousness also reveals the extent of 
the disparities that beset our world, the com- 
plexity of its problems and the number of 
threats that are liable at any time to jeopardize 
the stock of human achievement. 
Great demands are consequently being 
made on education, whose contribution to 
human progress is so vital. The idea is gaining 
ground that education is one of the most 
powerful tools with which to shape the 
" future—or, to use more modest terms, to 
steer us into the future by taking advantage of 
constructive trends and trying to avoid pit- 
falls. What is education doing today to pre- 
pare the active citizens of tomorrow? 
UNESCO has taken the initiative of bringing 
the light of its international experience to bear 
on this issue. Its Director-General, Mr. Fed- 
erico Mayor, asked me to chair an International 
Commission on Education for the Twenty- 
first Century, mandated “to study and reflect 
on the challenges facing education in the 
coming years, and to formulate suggestions and 
recommendations in the form of a report that 
could serve as an agenda for action for policy- 
makers and officials at the highest levels”. 
The following question from the Com- 
mission’s terms of reference formed our 
point of departure: “How can education play 
a dynamic and constructive role in preparing 
individuals and societies for the twenty-first 
century?” We were asking it some twenty 
years after another Commission, chaired by 
Mr. Edgar Faure, had published a report— 
which is still topical—under the significant 
title Learning to Be. 
 
Four crucial issues 
The Commission did its best to project its 
thinking on to a future dominated by global- 
ization, to ask the right questions and to lay 
down some broad guidelines that can be 
applied both within national contexts and on a 
global scale. Here I shall examine four issues 
which I believe are crucial. 
The first issue is the capacity of education 
systems to become the key factor in devel- 
opment by performing a threefold func- 
tion—economic, scientific and cultural. 
Everyone expects education to help build up 
a qualified and creative workforce that can 
adapt to new technologies and take part in the 
“intelligence revolution” that is the driving 
force of our economies. Everyone—in 
North and South alike—also expects educa- 
tion to advance knowledge in such a way that 
economic development goes hand in hand 
with responsible management of the physical 
and human environment. And, finally, edu- 
cation would be failing in its task if it did not 
produce citizens rooted in their own cultures | 
and yet open to other cultures and com- 
mitted to the progress of society. 
The second crucial issue is the ability of 
education systems to adapt to new trends in 
society. This brings us to one of the funda-

mental responsibilities of education—having to 
prepare for change despite the growing inse- 
curity that fills us with doubts and uncertain- 
ties. Education must take into account a whole 
range of interrelated and interreacting factors 
that are always in a state of flux, whether it is 
dealing with individual or social values, family 
structure, the role of women, the status 
accorded to minorities, or the problems of 
urban development or the environment. 
The third crucial issue is that of the relations 
between the education system and the state. 
The roles and responsibilities of the state, the 
devolution of some of its powers to federal or 
local authorities, the balance to be struck 
between public and private education—these 
are just some aspects of a problem which, 
moreover, differs from one country to another. 
The fourth issue is the promulgation of 
the values of openness to others, and mutual 
understanding—in a word, the values of 
peace. Can education purport to be uni- 
versal? Can it by itself, as a historical factor, 
create a universal language that would make 
it possible to overcome certain contradic- 
tions, respond to certain challenges and, 
despite their diversity, convey a message to 
all the inhabitants of the world? In this lan-

guage which, ideally, would be accessible to 
everybody, all the world’s wisdom and the 
wealth of its civilizations and cultures would 
be expressed in an immediately comprehen- 
sible form. 
The creation of a language accessible to 
everyone would mean that people would 
learn to engage more readily in dialogue, and 
the message that this language would convey 
would have to be addressed to human beings 
in all their aspects. A message that claims to 
be universal—one of education’s lofty ambi- 
tions—must be conveyed with all the subtle 
qualifications that take full account of human 
beings’ infinite variety. This is no doubt our 
major difficulty. 
 
Lines of enquiry 
Three current crises—the economic crisis, 
the crisis of the ideology of progress and a 
certain form of moral crisis—formed the 
backdrop to the Commission’s work. 
With them in mind, I tried to trace out a 
few lines of enquiry, taking account of cultural 
diversity, the specific nature of different 
problems and experiences, and the diversity 
of the political and social objectives of 
UNESCO’s Member States, so as to gain a better

Lifelong education must be rethought and broadened. It should be a

also of the critical faculty and the ability to act.

understanding of a number of fundamental 
relationships: the connections between edu- 
cation and culture (culture being seen as a 
factor in greater self-knowledge and knowl- 
edge of others); between education and citi- 
zenship and, more generally, the sense of 
belonging (so that our contemporaries and 
descendants do not feel isolated in the world 
of exceptionally rapid change which they see 
on their television screens); between educa- 
tion and social cohesion (which is weaker than 
it was fifty years ago in the countries of both 
North and South). And then, of course, the 
connection between education, training, 
work and employment; the connection with 
development; and, lastly, the essential role 
~ which education must play in the progress of 
research. 
If the proposals that emerged from the 
Commission’s work were to have a real 
impact on education policies, three trans- 
versal problems also had to be tackled. These 
were: the effect of modern communication 
media on contemporary education systems; 
the future of the teaching profession; the sys- 
tems to be set up and the funding to be found. 
The pillars of education 
The four main pillars that the Commission has 
presented and illustrated as the bases of edu- 
cation are: learning to know, learning to do, 
learning to be and learning to live together. 
The first of these is learning to know. 
Bearing in mind the rapid changes brought 
about by scientific progress and new forms 
of economic and social activity, there is a need 
to combine a broad general education with 
the possibility of working in depth on a 
selected number of subjects. In a sense, such 
a general education is the passport to learning 
throughout life, insofar as it should teach 
people to enjoy learning and also lay the 
foundations that will enable them to carry on 
learning throughout their lives. 
Learning to do is the second pillar. In addi- 
tion to learning to practise a profession or 
trade, people need to develop the ability to 
face a variety of situations and to work in 
teams, a feature of educational methods that 


### 102579: Education for tomorrow

does not receive enough attention at present. 
These skills are more readily acquired if pupils 
and students have the opportunity to develop 
their abilities by becoming involved in work 
experience schemes or social work while they 
are still in education. Increased importance 
should thus be attached to all schemes in 
which education alternates with work. 
Learning to be was the theme of the Edgar 
Faure Report published under UNESCO’s aus- 
pices in 1972. The Report’s recommendations 
are still extremely relevant, for in the twenty- 
first century everyone will need to exercise 
greater independence and judgment combined 
with a stronger sense of personal responsibility 
for the attainment of common goals. 
Learning to live together, finally, by devel- 
oping an understanding of others, of their his- 
tory, their traditions and their spirituality. This 
would provide a basis for the creation of a 
new spirit which, guided by recognition of 
our growing interdependence and a common 
analysis of the risks and challenges of the 
future, would induce people to implement 
common projects or to manage the inevitable 
conflicts in an intelligent and peaceful way. 
Some might say that this is utopian; and yet it 
1s a necessary utopia, indeed a vital one if we 
are to escape from the dangerous cycle sus- 
tained by cynicism and complacency. 
Learning throughout life 
The concept of learning throughout life advo- 
cated in the Faure Report is one of the keys 
to the twenty-first century. It meets the chal- 
lenge of a rapidly changing world, and it is 
necessary because of its advantages of flexi- 
bility, diversity and availability at different 
times and in different places. It also goes 
beyond the traditional distinction between 
initial schooling and continuing education. 
The idea of lifelong education must be 
rethought and broadened. As well as adapting

to changes in working life, it should also com- 
prise a continuous shaping of the personality, 
of knowledge and aptitudes, but also of the 
critical faculty and the ability to act. 
The truth is that every aspect of working 
life and social life offers opportunities for both 
learning and doing. There is a great temptation 
to make too much of this, and stress the edu- 
cational potential of the media, the world of 
work, and cultural and leisure pursuits, even 


### 102579: Education for tomorrow

to the extent of forgetting a number of funda- 
mental truths. Although people need to use all 
these opportunities for learning and self- 
improvement, they will not be able to make 
good usc of all their potential unless they have 
received a sound basic education. School 
should impart a desire for and pleasure in 
Jearning, the ability to learn how to learn, and 
intellectual curiosity. One might even imagine 
a society in which cach individual would be in 
turn both teacher and learner. 
The basis for a learning society is a formal 
system where each individual is introduced 
to the many different forms of knowledge. 
There is no substitute for the teacher-pupil 
relationship based on authority and dialogue. 
This has been said time and again by the great 
classical thinkers who have studied the ques- 
tion of education. It is the teacher’s responsi- 
bility to impart to the pupil the knowledge 
that humankind has acquired about itself and 
about nature, and the essence of human cre- 
ativity and inventiveness. 
Education should therefore constantly be 
adapting to changes in society, and also pass 
on the attainments, foundations and benefits 
of human experience. 
The stages and bridges of learning; a 
fresh approach 
By focusing on the concept of learning 
throughout life, the Commission did not 
intend to convey the idea that one could 
avoid reflecting on the different levels of edu- 
cation. The fact is that learning throughout life 
makes it possible to reorder the sequences 
and itineraries of education, case the transi- 
tion from one stage to another and recognize 
the value of each. 
The “three Rs”—reading, writing and arith- 
metic—get their full due. The combination of 
conventional teaching and out-of-school 
approaches should enable children to experi- 
ence the three dimensions of education—the 
moral and cultural, the scientific and techno- 
logical, and the economic and social. 
Basic education should be provided 
worldwide for 900 million illiterate adults, 130 
million children not enrolled in school, and 
There is no substitute 
for the teacher-pupil 
relationship based on 
authority and 
dialogue. 
French school pupils 
compare handiwork 
during an art lesson, 
more than 100 million who drop out prema- 
turely. This vast undertaking is a priority for 
technical assistance and partnership carried 
out through international co-operation. 
One major problem area in any reform 
concerns the policies to be adopted for young 
people after primary education. One might go 
so far as to say that secondary schools tend to 
be neglected in educational thinking. They are 
the target of considerable criticism and pro- 
voke a considerable amount of frustration. 
One source of frustration is a demand for 
expansion and diversification of secondary 
education, leading to rapid growth in enrol- 
ments and congestion in teaching pro- 
grammes. This gives rise to some classic prob- 
lems of mass education which developing 
countries cannot casily solve either financially 
or in terms of organization. Furthermore, 
there is the discouraging problem of school 
leavers who face a shortage of opportunities, 
their distress increased by a widespread all-or- 
nothing obsession with access to higher edu- 
cation. Mass unemployment in many coun- 
tries has exacerbated this malaise. 
The only way out of this difficult situation 
scems to be a very broad diversification of 
types of study available. The latter should 
include both conventional education, which 
focuses more on abstraction and conceptual- 
ization, and approaches that combine school 
and job experience in a way that brings out 
other abilities and inclinations. In any event, 
there should be bridges between these 
approaches so that errors in choice of direction, 
which are far too widespread, can be corrected. 
Furthermore, the prospect of being able 
to go back to education or training would 
alter the general climate by assuring each

Higher education should be seen from the

In many countries, other types of higher

universities. Some are highly selective, while 
others were set up to provide specifically tar- 
geted, quality professional and vocational 
training. This diversification obviously meets 
the needs of society and the economy, both at 
the national and regional levels. 
Increasingly stringent selection in order to

higher education in the wealthiest countries 
is neither politically nor socially acceptable. 
One of the main flaws in such an approach is 
that many young people are expelled from 
the educational process before they have 
been able to obtain a recognized diploma and 
find themselves in the desperate predicament 
of having neither a degree nor training appro- 
priate for the job market. 
There is a need to manage increasing uni- 
versity enrolment in tandem with reform of 
secondary education. 
Universities would contribute to this 
process by diversifying what they offer: as 
scientific establishments and centres of 
learning leading to theoretical or applied 
research or teaching; as establishments 
offering professional qualifications, with 
courses and content tailored to the needs of 
the economy; as one of the main crossroads 
for learning throughout life; as leading part- 
ners in a form of international co-operation 
favouring exchanges of teachers and students 
and promoting the wider availability of first- 
class teaching through international profes- 
sorships. 
These proposals have a special significance 
in poor countries, where universities have a 
decisive role to play. 
Long-term strategies for reform 
Without underestimating the obligation to 
manage short-term constraints or disregard 
the need to adapt existing systems, the Com- 
mission emphasized the need for a longer- 
term approach if necessary reforms are to 
succeed. By the same token, it stressed the 
fact that reforms introduced in rapid succes- 
ston cancel each other out, since they do not 
allow the system the time needed either to 
absorb change or to involve all those con- 
cerned in the process. 
Three main protagonists contribute to the 
success of educational reforms: the local 
community (parents, school heads and 
teachers), the public authorities and the inter- 
national community. 
Local community participation in assessing 
needs by means of a dialogue betweens the 
public authorities and social groups concerned 
is a first essential stage in broadening access to 
education and improving its quality. Contin- 
uing the dialogue by way of the media, com- 
munity discussions, parent education and 
training, and on-the-job teacher training usu- 
ally arouses greater awareness, develops judg- 
ment and helps build local capacities. 
In any event, no reform can succeed 
without the co-operative and active participa- 
tion of teachers. The Commission recom- 
mended that the social, cultural and material 
status of educators should be considered as a 
matter of priority, along with the tools required 
to deliver education of a high standard: books, 
modern communication media, and suitable 
cultural and economic support for the school. 
This being so, one requirement for the 
improvement of education systems is respon- 
sible public policy. Policy-makers cannot 
assume that the market can compensate for 
the failures in the system or that laisser-faire is 
sufficient. The public authorities must pro- 
pose clear options and, after broad consulta- 
tion with all concerned, choose policies that 
set guidelines for the system and lay its foun- 
dations, and regulate it by making the neces- 
sary adjustments. 
All the choices to be made should be pred- 
icated upon the principle of equal opportunity. 
During the Commission’s deliberations, I 
put forward a proposal that may be regarded as 
radical. As education throughout life gradually 
becomes a reality, all young persons could be 
allocated an education voucher at the start of 
their education. This would entitle them to a 
certain number of years of education. Their enti- 
tlement would be credited to an account at a 
bank which would manage a capital of time avail- 
able for cach individual, together with the appro-

### 102580: Learning to be' in retrospect

0 be’ in retrospect 
by Asher Deleon 
Almost a quarter of a century ago, UNESCO published the findings 
of a world enquiry into education in a report entitled Learning to Be. 
How does this landmark study look today? 
Above, lesson in a Brazilian 
school north of Salvador, 
capital of Bahia state. 
12 
In 1972, the International Commission 
on the Development of Education 
chaired by the former French prime minister 
Edgar Faure published a report entitled 
Learning to Be. The title reflected the climate 
of euphoriaand optimism of the times, gener- 
ated by economic and social achievements, the 
ideology of steady progress, the official process 
of decolonialization then being completed, the 
positive consequences of “peaceful coexis- 
tence”, and an enduring faith in international 
co-operation. It is true that student revolt and 
the “events” of 1968 had revealed a certain dis- 
enchantment, but the Report was based on 
datafrom the previous decade. The first signs 
of what later came to be regarded as an “edu- 
cation crisis” were just beginning to appear. 
The key ideas 
“Lifelong education” and “the learning 
  
society” were the Report’s two key ideas. 
The former was considered as the “key- 
stone” of educational policies; the latter as a 
strategy aimed at committing society as a 
whole to education. The approach was based 
E 4 |

### 102580: Learning to be' in retrospect

on the idea of osmosis between education 
and society, and sought to steer clear of a 
number of misconceptions such as the ideas 
of education as a “sub-system” of society, of 
instruction as a tool for solving all individual 
and social problems, and of the compartmen- 
talization of life into “learning time” and “time 
for living”. 
As its title indicates, the Report focuses on 
learning, a process that goes beyond educa- 
tion and, a fortiori, teaching. Education and 
teaching are described in it as dimensions that 
are subordinate to the learning process. 
School and out-of-school activities (formal, 
non-formal and informal education) are 
treated without hierarchical distinction, and 
the importance of basic education for all and 
of adult education is taken as a premise: 
“learning is a process that lasts a lifetime, both 
in its duration and in its diversity.” 
However, the Commission did not regard 
lifelong education as a process of permanent 
schooling, adult education or continuous 
vocational training. It was seen neither as an 
educational system nor an educational field, 
but rather as “a principle on which the overall 
organization of a system and hence the elabo- 
ration of each of its parts, are based”. Lifelong 
education is a need that is common to 
everyone, 
Learning must be redistributed not only 
in time, but also in space. Thus the Faure 
Commission called into question the 
monopoly of institutionalized education. All 
institutions, whatever their field of compe- 
tence (economic, social, cultural or informa- 
tional) can be used for educational purposes 
and thereby help to build “a self-aware 
learning society”. 
The Report focused on personal develop- 
ment and put learners, not teachers or edu- 
cational institutions, at the core of education. 
The important thing is not the path followed 
by the learner, but the outcome of the 
learning process. Each one of us must be free, 
as our judgment grows stronger and our 
experience becomes richer and more varied, 
to choose the ways best suited to our own 
needs, expectations and abilities. 
 
The education gap 
Starting from these basic concepts, the Com- 
mission put forward a series of suggestions and 
proposals for a new organization of education 
systems designed to do away with antiquated

or unjustified barriers and to rid traditional 
structures of their excessively formal nature. 
I am convinced that the basic ideas of the 
Faure Report are still relevant in the final 
decade of the twentieth century and that 
from their standpoint the education gap—the 
backwardness, dysfunctions and shortcom- 
ings of education in relation to human 
needs—can gradually be overcome. The 
theory behind these general guidelines is vir- 
tually never contested nowadays. Thousands 
of experiments in recent decades have been 
carried out along these lines. At the same 
time, a battle still has to be waged against con- 
servatism at national level, the inadequate 
commitment of international organizations, 
external interference in the domestic affairs 
of many states, and the rigidity of administra- 
tive, productive and other structures, 
including the teaching profession.

Japan, Sweden, Norway and Argentina) have 
taken their cue from the Faure Report’s sug- 
gestions at the national level. Most experi- 
ments, although frequently interesting and 
bold, carried out by local authorities, business 
firms, educational establishments and associ- 
ations have been fragmentary and sporadic, 
with limited resources. Even countries that 
have long-established democratic and educa- 
tional traditions and achievements as well as 
substantial financial resources hesitate to stray 
from the beaten track and integrate changes 
in the overall context. 
  
Utopian leanings 
One criticism that could be made of Learning 
to Be is that it expected too much of educa- 
tion and did not take sufficient account of 
economic and political conditions. It also 
overestimated the material resources of the 
developing countries and the extent to which 
the industrialized countries were really 
willing to provide them with substantial aid.

looking of the ever-widening education gap

### 102585: The Education of prisoners

THE EDUCATION OF PRISONERS 
BY STEPHEN DUGUID 
Prison education may seem to be a contradiction in terms. Prisons 
are authoritarian, coercive institutions. Education, on the other 
hand, is generally seen as liberating, dependent on the free flow of 
ideas and, in the case of adults, on opportunities to put into prac- 
tice ideas and skills learned in the classroom. 
Despite these apparent contradictions there has grown up over 
the past century or more a branch of adult education known as 
“prison education”. In developing countries the provision of edu- 
cation in prisons is a low national priority. Educational resources 
are scarce and teachers are poorly trained. 
In the nations of the former “socialist bloc” prison education 
has been a formal partner in the reformative mandate given to 
prison systems based on the premise that crime must be a devia- 
tion caused by ignorance rather than by social or cultural depri- 
vation. Education in prisons is an important tool in the effort to 
have prisoners come to see the “error of their ways”. 
In the countries of the West the practice varies according to 
political choices, available funding and the state of research. In 
the past the dominant role for prison education was “schooling” 
based on literacy, secondary school and vocational education pro- 
grammes. The rationale for such programmes lay in a complex 
series of explanations for crime, largely based on sociological foun 
dations. More recently the rationale has begun to shift back to 
psychological causes for crime, and hence education programmes 
14 
are being asked to serve more specific ends such as addressing 
addiction, violence, anger and sexual deviation. 
Prison educators are constantly called on to justify them- 
selves, and in doing so have reached divergent though sometimes 
complementary positions. Many educators focus on the ameliora- 
tive effect of education on the management of the prison. Others 
have made a strong case for schooling in prison as a response to 
the educational and cultural deprivation of the imprisoned or have 
advocated the economic advantages of vocational training. The 
most optimistic assert that education should play the leading role 
or at least have an important place in the prison’s rehabilitative 
and reformative agenda. 
In the past decade, prison educators around the world have 
emerged from their isolated and isolating institutions and discov- 
ered a common vocation amongst divergent theories and praxis. 
Teachers, administrators and researchers have taken part in a series 
of international meetings in the U.S.A., Canada, the United 
Kingdom, Sweden, Estonia and the Netherlands and taken the first 
steps towards defining some common standards for education in 
prison. = 
STEPHEN DUGUID, 
of Canada, is associate professor of humanities at Simon Fraser University in 
British Columbia and a specialist in adult education. He has written many 
articles on education in prisons and participated in the work of UNESCO'S 
International Commission on Education for the 21st Century.

between individuals, and between ethnic 
groups, social classes and nations also reflect a 
lack of realism that has given rise to disap- 
pointments. 
The results achieved in the different 
branches of education are far from satisfac- 
tory. The tiny percentage of young children 
enrolled in pre-school education (a per- 
centage that is declining in several countries), 
the enormous numbers of children who 
receive no schooling at all, the figure of one 
billion illiterates by the end of the century, 
and the almost universal erosion of adult edu- 
cation—these are facts that make it impera- 
tive to radically revise objectives and strategic 
forecasts in these fields. Although the pri- 
mary responsibility lies with the national and 
local authorities, the responsibility of the 
international community, and particularly that 
of UNEscoO, should not be minimized. 
Indeed, it might well be asked how far and 
with what success UNESCO communicated 
the message of the Report. 
 
New parameters 
Clearly, at the end of the 1960s it was impos- 
sible to predict the collapse of the Berlin Wall 
and the failure of the communist experiment, 
  
  
and the Faure Commission did not have the 
means to study the issues connected with the 
problems of indoctrination, education subject 
to censorship, and manipulation of and by 
education. However, the speed with which 
political regimes have collapsed, the slow 
progress “of the necessary reforms, the 
domestic conflicts, both political and armed, 
inter-ethnic and religious, and the subjective 
obstacles to the establishment of a market 
economy cannot be understood without ref- 
erence to the distortions suffered by educa- 
tional practices in previous decades. The 
International Commission on Education for 
the Twenty-first Century chaired by Jacques 
Delors may fill this gap, especially since the 
international climate is favourable to it. The 
failure of totalitarian regimes has encouraged 
the growing ascendancy of the philosophy of 
human rights, and it is increasingly clear that it 
is in the link between education and democ- 
racy or, better still, between education and 
freedom, that we should seek the guiding 
principle of our educational policies. 
In the field of economics, the Faure 
Commission was able to benefit from the 
auspicious situation created after three 
decades of post-war efforts and the first two

It is in the link between

decades of decolonization. The Delors Com- 
mission has had to confront a far gloomier 
and more disturbing economic picture: crisis 
affecting the South, the debt burden, the col- 
lapse of terms of trade for the main raw mate- 
rials, the ever-widening gap between indus- 
trialized and developing countries (with the 
exception of a few Asian countries at an inter- 
mediate stage of development), unemploy- 
ment, the social and economic marginaliza- 
tion of a section of the urban and rural popu- 
lations in the industrialized countries. 
Another question concerns the role of the 
state. Disenchantment about the principle of 
total, and even sometimes partial, state control 
over education, budget austerity and the gulf 
between educational supply and demand, as 
well as dangers arising from the “commercial 
ization” of education, have sometimes led to 
questioning of the role of the state as the sole 
manager of education and its main source of 
funding. Some have suggested that it should 
become a mere regulator, responsible for 
maintaining an equitable system for distributing 
resources and enforcing national standards for 
examinations and qualifications. Others go 
even further. The Delors Commission was 
bound to take these problems into account. 
The changes that have occurred in the edu- 
cational sciences in the last quarter of a century 
are so far-reaching that they can be called re v- 
olutionary. The Faure Commission saw the 
new educational technologies as a prerequisite 
 
for bringing about most of the innovations. 
Today, however, after the explosion of com- 
puter technology, multimedia and interactive 
systems, the Delors Commission has had to 
pay great attention to what Henri Dieuzeide, a 
French authority in this field, has called “a new 
visual order”. “The audiovisual media present, 
information technology organizes, telecom- 
munications brings closer,” he notes in Les 
Nouvelles Technologies, Outils d’Enseigne- 
ment (UNESCO/Nathan, Paris, 1994). “What is 
going to happen when any educational activity 
or exercise can be undertaken on a single piece 
of hardware containing messages that in the 
past were transmitted by an array of different 
media? . . .The result will be to force different 
educational 
approaches to draw closer together and to 
and frequently antagonistic 
work out common strategies for purposes of 
presentation, structuring and manipulation.” 
Finally, humankind has entered a phase of 
historical transition marked by the conflict 
between human activities and environmental 
constraints. We must invent a new paradigm 
of development geared to the concept of sus- 
tainability and define the ethical rules per- 
taining to it. We have no choice but to build 
up new modes of production and consump- 
tion. Far from being masters of the universe, 
we must understand that we are but the 
guests or stewards of nature. It is through 
education that we must “learn to be” nature’s 
partner and co-pilot. [|

than is generally realized. 
Decompartmentalizing science 
The benefits of science and technology no

Although specialization is undoubtedly a nec-

is in danger of alienating science from the

be extremely dangerous to reject science on 
the pretext of getting back to humanitarian 
values. Science is part and parcel of culture, 
and the practice of science should lead natu- 
rally on to the idea of international solidarity 
and tolerance. 
Science teaching is at present in a rut and 
needs to be re-examined. This applies partic- 
ularly to textbooks. Physics is taught from 
books on physics, and biology from works 
on biology, whereas science teaching should 
be much more cross-disciplinary. Why not 
refer to the underlying problems of physics 
when teaching molecular biology or, when 
teaching biology, to the ethical questions that 
are soon sure to come up? 
The problem needs to be tackled both in 
general and in specific terms. Due regard 
must be shown both for the different cul- 
tures of different countries and for the uni- 
versality of science. This is the only way to 
avoid fragmentation of knowledge, which is 
harmful in every way. Science education will 
SCIENCE AND THE 
MARKET 
The market plays a paradoxical role in the 
spread of scientific knowledge. On the one 
hand, more and more databases are being cre- 
ated and their information-processing capacity 
is growing. This should facilitate the dissemi- 
nation of scientific data worldwide. On the 
other hand, the high cost of accessing these 
databases is a serious drawback. The data- 
bases are highly centralized, and are in danger 
of becoming the exclusive property of a 
restricted number of major scientific or tech- 
nical groups, large industrial organizations 
wishing to preserve their market. 
Cases in which the possessors of informa- 
tion keep it to themselves for commercial rea- 
sons are also starting to cause problems. The 
ferocious competition in the pharmaceutical 
industry, however useful it may be in stimu- 
lating research, is open to criticism insofar as 
it works against the interests of countries 
lacking the resources to participate in it. Here, 
as in other fields, the right balance has not yet 
been achieved. 
Information should be regarded as part of 
the common heritage of humanity, and clear 
rules as to its dissemination should be estab- 
lished. FG. NH

education—literary, artistic, political or even 
economic—in order that the citizens of the 
twenty-first century may see science pri- 
marily as an ally in achieving what they want 
done for the good of their country or of civ- 
lization as a whole. 
Mote open, more diverse higher 
education 
After going through a period of crisis, in 
Europe especially, universities can now aspire 
to provide both a general culture and a prac- 
tical training for various occupations. It is, 
however, increasingly true to say that the 
training of scientists cannot be confined to a 
single location. 
First of all it will probably be necessary to 
rethink the transition from secondary educa- 
tion to higher education. The former sharp 
break between them is becoming less abrupt. 
Much still remains to be done, however, 
because in a way school students today are 
more mature than their predecessors. In my 
opinion they are far more receptive to sci- 
ence, technology and discussion about social 
problems than is generally believed. 
They first go to university to learn the 
basics, then to laboratories to round out what 
they have learned, then into industry to study 
the technical applications, and in some cases 
to museums or science parks to acquire a 
broader overall view of science. This form of

networking, linking the university with other 
professional institutions, will need to be rein- 
forced in the future. Perhaps we should also 
rethink and diversify the traditional linear 
progression from school to university, labo- 
ratory or business. 
Furthermore, universities should not all 
necessarily teach the same thing nor attempt 
to cover all the ground. Although a common 
core must be established, i.e. a basic scientific 
culture without which studies cannot be car- 
ried forward, universities nevertheless have 
to find their own specific roles in keeping 
with the aspirations of the societies (and 
regions) within which they operate. The 
evaluation of universities should, however, 
be carried out at international level: while cul- 
tural traditions and national goals vary froni 
country to country, science is preeminently 
universal in character. 
The growth of the student population in 
universities raises considerable problems, since 
it necessitates the training of adequate numbers 
of specialist teachers in various fields. Univer- 
sitics should therefore have an open-door 
policy and should allow scientists great 
freedom of movement, both within their own 
country and internationally. Although this 
means that they should set their sights high and 
have plentiful resources, they cannot restrict 
themselves to training an elite. The French 
“Grandes Ecoles”, for instance, provide an 
excellent education and produce some remark- 
able people, but perhaps they fail to take

account of the diversity of individual talents. 
The Grandes Ecoles, in my view to their credit, 
are making a real effort to open up to the wider 
university system and to the business world. 
Thought should also be given to the pos- 
sibly disproportionate importance attached to 
mathematics in the selection of students. 
Mathematics is one of the highest forms of 
intellectual activity and can be used to assess 
an individual’s capacity for abstraction and 
rapid thinking, but it is going too far to take it 
as the sole criterion. 
Teaching students 
to be team players 
If we are looking for a system that is fully 
appropriate to the needs of the coming cen- 
tury and as receptive as possible to all forms 
of cultures, we need to prepare the ground in 
primary and secondary schools. By the uni- 
versity level it is already too late. I believe it is 
essential to introduce the teaching of the his- 
tory of science from the primary level on, so 
as to situate science within a cultural context. 
Science would then be gradually integrated 
into the teaching process in a pluralist way, 
with efforts being made to maintain a balance 
with other subjects and outlooks. 
In secondary school, hands-on scientific 
experiments should be introduced at a very 
early stage. This is crucial, since such activi- 
ties bring students face to face with their 
responsibilities, teaching them that they must 
  
be able to work as members of a team, must 
have an acutely critical outlook and must 
realize that there is not just one, but several 
possible approaches to the solution of prob- 
lems—in short, that life itself puts us in situa- 
tions that constantly require us to solve diffi- 
cult practical problems. 
There have long been calls for secondary- 
level science to be taught in this way, but itis 
not easy to set up. The logistics arc expensive, 
and teachers are not always adequately 
trained for this kind of work. This is one of 
the reasons why France has established uni- 
versity-level teacher education institutes 
(Instituts Universitaires de Formation de 
Maitres), whose students have the opportu- 
nity to take training courses in laboratory 
work. The institutes aim to provide an inter- 
disciplinary training course, showing how 
problems are linked to one another, not only 
across subject boundaries but also within 
society as a whole, while enabling trainees 
from different backgrounds to establish a 
close relationship with experimental science. 
It is, however, too soon to pass judgment on 
the effectiveness of these institutions. 
The acquisition of knowledge in the 
twenty-first century will probably be a 
halfway house between computerized mes- 
sages of the highest level of abstraction at one 
end of the spectruin and highly specialized, 
sophisticated technologies at the other: scien- 
tists will therefore have to be able to move 
freely between these two extremes. |

### 102595: Sharing knowledge

by Pierre Léna 
t a time when there is a 
worldwide trend for knowl 
edge to become the pre- 
serve of the most highly developed 
countries, one of the major prob- 
lems facing the university systemis 
that of sharing the information 
accumulated by the major scien- 
tific research centres. 
The critical point for the 
transfer of knowledge comes 
when students from the devel 
oping countries who have 
obtained their doctorates in the 
industrialized countries return 
home to put their knowledge to 
use. They find that there are few 
satisfactory job opportunities 
and in many cases are isolated in 
their research, Even students 
from the International Centre for 
Theoretical Physics established   
by Professor Abdus Salam in Tri- 
este (Italy) find themselves in a 
similar situation. The problem is 
that there is at present no real 
concerted policy which would 
allow scientific centres to come 
into being outside the industrial- 
ized countries. 
Chile is an especially inter 
esting case in this respect. It has 
some of the best sites in the 
world for astronomy, and the 
United States, Europe and Japan 
are all interested in them. For the 
country’s own scientific develop- 
ment to benefit from this natural 
asset, now being exploited by 
others, it would be fairly logical 
to envisage a kind of “levy” on 
telescopes installed by foreign 
countries, i.e. by making them 
available for part of the time to   
Chilean scientists. Negotiations 
on these lines are being carried 
out with Europe and have already 
been concluded with the United 
States. 
But opportunities for access 
to technical equipment, however 
powerful the equipment may be, 
are not in themselves a guarantee 
of sustainable scientific develop- 
ment. Building a scientific com- 
munity is a long process that, 
even when conditions are 
favourable, does not always pro- 
duce immediate results. A reason- 
able aim for Chile would be to set 
up an International Centre for the 
Sciences of the Universe, possibly 
to be shared by the whole of Latin 
America, playing a similar role to 
that played for physics in Europe 
by the Trieste Centre. ||

### 102597: Science made simple

SCIENCE MADE 
SIMPLE 
BY JAYANT V. NARLIKAR 
The challenge of popularizing science and helping people to 
appreciate science as part of their culture can be approached 
on four levels. 
At primary school the first thing to do is encourage 
curiosity about nature. Children generally start with this 
curiosity, but educational systems often stifle it. Next they 
must be taught the concept of a pattern in natural phenomena, 
and then be gradually introduced to the mathematical or quan- 
titative aspects of nature. The teacher should then show how 
nature follows certain laws and that therefore predictions can 
be made about it. If these aspects are incorporated into pri- 
mary education, children will begin to appreciate the sciences 
as an important part of their education. 
The main goal of secondary education should be to empha- 
size the experimental verification of scientific laws. Children 
should be made aware of the historical development of science 
through the interplay of theory with experiment. The history of 
science should be taught in a way that shows how scientists 
actually learn—by making mistakes and correcting them. 
The aims of higher education should be to provide students 
with access to source material that will supplement classroom 
teaching and work with textbooks, and to make sure they have 
opportunities to discuss, ask questions, argue and interact 
with their teachers. Students should be made aware of the fron- 
tiers of research and should see research being done around 
them. They should do projects to find out what interests them 
and to add to the content of science. Students often do not dis- 
cover what they really like until it is too late. 
One of the chief purposes of science popularization for the 
general public is to help people learn to live comfortably with 
science and technology. The limitations as well as the powers 
of science should be appreciated. Scientists often get carried 
away and give the impression that science is a panacea. This 
provokes a backlash from those who say: How can you offer 
answers to everything when you know that science is incom- 
plete? The solution is to share the failures as well as the tri- 
umphs. These things can be conveyed in books, lectures and 
films made for the general public. un

### 102599: The Hands-on approach

The hands-on 
approach 
by Goery Delacote 
San Francisco’s Exploratorium 
is giving a wide public an informal 
initiation to science 
Although education in the United States 
has not traditionally been regarded as a 
matter for the Federal Government, in recent 
years the latter has set about transforming the 
education system on a national scale by setting 
minimum standards and common objectives 
for all schools, thus creating a general frame of 
reference. 
There are three essential aspects to these 
standards and objectives: they lay down what 
young Americans should have learned by the 
end of a certain number of years of schooling; 
they describe relevant and effective methods 
to be used for the teaching, in three- or four- 
year instalments, of the various subjects; and 
they set forth methods of evaluation adapted 
to these new criteria. They also list the condi- 
tions to be met for putting this new frame of 
reference into effect. 
A flexible, open system 
These measures bear certain resemblances to 
those relating to the establishment of school 
curricula in France in the late nineteenth cen- 
tury by Jules Ferry, except for the fact that 
they allow local institutions wide freedom of 
choice as to the methods and resources used 
to attain the objectives. 
In the case of mathematics, the standards, 
drawn up with the help of all the parties 
involved in the changes—chiefly high-school 
and college teachers, but also businessmen, 
parent-teacher associations and politicians— 
have already been promulgated. This process, 
a thoroughgoing picce of social and political

alchemy, was carried out with the co-opera- 
tion of all those competent in the subject, thus 
avoiding the mistakes made thirty years ago 
when modern maths were introduced. Similar 
standards are now being prepared for science 
teaching and will soon be brought into force 
for all subjects. 
This idea of a “wide-mesh” education system 
creates favourable conditions for a genuine 
debate among the various people and institu- 
tions actively involved in the system. It also 
makes it possible to take specific local condi- 
tions into account and to optimize the manage- 
ment of each community’s resources. The greater 
the scope for initiative, and hence autonomy, at 
the local level, the more necessary it becomes to 
lay down a general framework that is flexible 
enough to let such initiatives be put into effect. 
In the next century we shall very likely all 
have to come to terms with the definition of 
objectives on a national, or even international, 
scale and, on the other hand, the need for ini- 
tiatives at the local level. 
The educational role of museums 
There is, however, a risk that such initiatives 
will come to nothing unless schools them- 
selves undergo a transformation at the same 
time. The substantial rise in the numbers of 
schoolchildren brought about by population 
growth will bring the whole education system 
to a standstill unless it is reorganized. 
The experience of my own institution, the 
San Francisco Exploratorium, may be of some 
interest in this respect. An experimental

centre, founded in 1969, its purpose is to bring 
basic scientific knowledge to a wide audience, 
parents and teachers as well as students. It is 
open to all comers and provides learning aids, 
access to on-line services (Internet, for 
example), teachers and guides, all with the aim 
of putting users in the frame of mind to go on 
asking more questions and allowing constantly 
changing new learning techniques and 
methods to be tried out. 
These techniques, worked out jointly by 
the teachers and engineers with the help of the 
learners themselves, aim to stimulate debate 
on science, its social applications and the ethical 
problems it raises, and also on the processes 
(metacognition) at work in science. 
The Exploratorium is also a meeting-place 
for prospective teachers, where they can 
acquire a foretaste of their future job. The ini- 
tial training it provides, though by definition 
insufficient for a proper vocational qualifica- 
tion, aims mainly to put across the idea of con- 
tinuing education as something quite natural. 
In science, this initial training consists chiefly 
of familiarizing trainees with the experimental 
approach and with how to give lessons, but it 
also teaches them how to learn by instilling in 
them a capacity to stand back and examine 
their own methods objectively. 
At a more general level, the educational 
role of scientific centres open to the public—

reconsidered in the United States. These cen- 
“tres are in the process of changing, from being 
mere adjuncts to formal education to 
becoming experimental logistical bases for the 
transformation of the whole educational 
system. Excellent as the universities are as 
regards research and academic knowledge, 
experience has shown that they are often ill 
suited to providing trainee teachers with the 
sort of skills an appropriate professional 
training requires, whereas the scientific cen- 
tres possess, as compared with the universi-

of their timetables, programmes and organiza-

A move towards 
school autonomy 
As well as to the part that scientific centres 
could play in education in general, considera- 
tion needs to be given to the future of schools 
themselves. 


### 102599: The Hands-on approach

### 102605: Schools at the crossroads

The fact that schools do not at present 
enjoy real autonomy in the management of 
their resources reduces their power of initia- 
tive and hampers the adaptation of the educa- 
tion system as a whole to the changes made 
necessary by its own expansion. Schools 
operate on the basis of directives given to 
them rather than agreed objectives that would 
leave them free to allocate resources in such a 
way as to produce results best suited to local 
conditions. This makes it particularly difficult 
to create a learning environment that would 
enable any substantial improvement in pupils’ 
performance to be obtained and would be 
conducive to equal opportunity while taking 
account of local factors. 
A move towards autonomy for schools has 
started in the United States as a result of pres- 
sures from parents, learned societies and 
industry, but schools have still received no 
indications as to the most suitable types of 
organization and management required. Guid- 
ance from outside experts is therefore essential 
for the gradual implementation of the changes 
foreseen. This alone will enable serious mis- 
takes to be avoided. |

Schools at the 
crossroads 
by Robert Bisaillon 
Schools often seem to be standing still 
while the rest of the world moves on. 
However, a number of social changes now 
look set to challenge educational systems and 
the functions of education. 
Schools are at a crossroads. On the one 
hand, the state seems unwilling to go on 
financing and directing education; on the other, 
schools and local authorities would like to have 
more of a say in these matters themselves. 
In these circumstances, the role of

and the workplace, which are themselves in 
the throes of change, schools no longer have 
a monopoly on the dissemination of knowl- 
edge. New information and communication 
technologies are putting teachers to the test 
and making them re-examine their approach 
to education. 
The ways by which young people acquire 
knowledge have changed. Acquisition by 
absorption, a process encouraged by the media, 
is taking over from the traditional process in 
which the family and the school acted as the 
intermediaries. But the media appeal to young 
people’s curiosity and emotional responses in a 
random fashion, and schools find it very hard 
to put knowledge acquired from the media into 
some sort of order so that schoolchildren can 
benefit from it. 
The concept of skills has also taken on a 
broader meaning. As well as transmitting 
knowledge and know-how to their pupils, 
teachers must train them to find information 
for themselves and to make use of it. Pupils’ 
skills are now defined in terms of their self- 
reliance and their ability to adapt to different 
types of training and jobs.

cultural intermingling and where there are

fewer and fewer fixed points of reference, 
teachers are expected to show children how 
to form their own values. 
Lastly, the phenomenon of students 
“working their way through college” is a typ- 
ical feature of life in North America, where 
the school population is drawn from mixed, 
multiethnic backgrounds. All these factors 
have a strong influence on thinking about 
what is required of schools and about ways of 
achieving integration. 
Education and politics 
The situation raises a number of socio-polit- 
ical questions, such as how to reconcile 
clitism with democracy without widening 
social cleavages or how to expound a uni- 
versal culture respectful of national identities 
without encouraging racism and intolerance. 
In this context, how should the roles of the 
state, the school and the individual be defined? 
A definition of a “common public culture”, 
encompassing a sct of non-negotiable values 
thatare necessary to social cohesion, is perhaps 
called for. This set of values could serve as a 
common core for the education of all groups, 
minority or majority, sedentary or nomadic, 
without infringing the basic rights of any of

them. These consensual values could justifiably 
be invoked to challenge the authority of 
schools designed to emphasize religious or 
ethnic differences. Again, instead of intro- 
ducing new subjects into syllabuses, would it 
not be better to reorganize existing syllabuses 
transversally to encourage knowledge and 
understanding of other languages and cultures? 
Education could in this way become truly a 
factor working for peace. 
On a matter more directly related to the 
social and economic context, the kind of gen- 
eral knowledge that opens pupils’ minds to 
the world around them needs to be com- 
bined with vocational qualifications enabling 
them to find a place in economic life. Since 
one of the aims of education is to provide 
- young people with the means of changing the 
society in which they live, they should first 
understand how it works and how it can be 
improved. 
In all these respects teachers have a leading 
role to play, which is why one of the most 
basic changes to the system concerns the 
teaching profession. More emphasis in pre- 
service training should be attached to teachers’ 
individual and collective responsibility, i.e. the 
development of professionalism should be the 
guiding principle. Next, in view of the length 
of teachers’ careers, pre-service training, prac- 
tical experience and in-service training should 
form a continuum. Success depends on 
responsible commitment, by each according 
to his or her role and competence, on the part 
of all those who determine educational poli- 
cies, who are in charge of schools and whose 
daily business is education. ||

### 102606: The Prospects for teachers

THE PROSPECTS 
FOR TEACHERS 
BY BILL RATTEREE 
The training of what may well be more than 50 million teachers 
worldwide by the year 2000 and payment for their services— 
representing from 50 to 80 per cent of current public educa- 
tional expenditure in almost all countries—constitute an enor- 
mous investment. 
For this investment to be fully realized, the training, recruit- 
ment and career prospects of teachers must be interlocked in 
such a way as to favour a dynamic and creative schooling envi- 
ronment. Recruitment criteria will need to favour aptitude and 
motivation to teach, not just the acquisition of credentials. 
Career structures will need to provide instructional rather than 
administrative paths for highly skilled teachers. There must be 
equality of opportunity and treatment between men and 
women. 
As far as salaries and other material benefits are con- 
cerned, the evidence suggests that with a few exceptions in 
high-income countries, teachers’ salaries have not maintained 
comparability with professions requiring similar qualifications. 
The consequences include: a decline in the quality of individ- 
uals recruited into teaching, the loss of qualified and experi 
enced teachers who are attracted to other jobs, and general 
lack of interest in sustaining creative performance. The impact 
is most dramatic in low-income countries subject to economic 
and fiscal restrictions, where multiple job-holding, teacher 
absenteeism and recourse to private teaching schemes are 
becoming the rule. 
It is thus indispensable to ensure salaries comparable to 
rates of equivalent professionals and to formulate strategies 
to establish material incentives broad enough to motivate all 
teachers. The alternative is that schooling in many countries 
will inexorably decline, as basic skills are not taught or taught 
poorly, student dropout levels among low-income families will 
increase and the education system will fail to carry out its basic 
mission. =

Distance education in the 
high-tech era 
Menahem Yaar, president of the Open University of Israel, 
talks to Jasmina Sopova 
; 
  
       
BH How does distance education fit 
into current educational practice? 
Menahem Yaari: Several kinds of institu- 
tions in the world practise it, notably a large 
number of traditional universities that are 
gradually opening departments of this kind. 
They are, you might say, “mixed” institu- 
tions. There are also institutions like the 
National Technological University (NTU) 
in the United States that operate uniquely 
as distance education entities but by using 
the traditional course material of other 
leading universities. They act as an agent, as 
it were. There are also about twenty uni- 
versities like ours that develop their own 
course material and broadcast it via satellite, 
thereby using the most up-to-date com- 
munication technology. 
HE What is special about the Israeli 
version? 
The control room of the Open 
University of Israel’s satellite

M. Y.: We have based our system exten- 
sively on the one developed in Britain 
twenty-five years ago. But we've taken it 
even further. The British Open University 
1s mostly concerned with the social sci- 
ences, while Israel's covers a broader 
range of subjects, particularly the sciences. 
Its teaching is much more diversified. 
For each subject—there are at present 
about 400—we set our own course mate- 
rial and ask the most qualified experts 
Israel has to offer to develop the course. 
This ensures a very high standard. We can 
boast of the fact that our courses are used 
as working documents by a large number 
of students and professors in other Israeli 
universities.

how many there are, their names and their 
academic background. The classrooms are 
equipped with a large screen, personal 
computers and telephones so that students 
can dialogue with their teacher. 
Hl All this must demand high-level 
organization. .. 
M. Y.: Yes. As well as the experts we ask to 
develop our courses, the Open University 
of Israel employs its own faculty (teaching 
assistants, lecturers and professors), like any 
other university. But instead of giving 
courses, the professors provide course 
follow-up by supervising their content. 
They also have to make sure that assess- 
ments, final examinations and teaching 
materials are up to an acceptable standard. 
We are also on the cutting edge of self- 
evaluation. We are perfectly aware of each 
course’s contents and each student’s 
results. All these data enable us to assess 
the quality of our teaching. We have direct 
access to courses, and if something goes 
wrong, we know about it at once and can 
rectify it from one day to the next. 
BM Does this kind of organization 
make the system complicated and 
costly? 
M. Y.: Just the opposite. The experts who 
develop our courses work for other insti- 
tutions. We pay only fees, which consid- 
erably reduces our overheads without 
diminishing the quality of our teaching. 
The Open University of Israel now

One message that Unesco is trying to get 
across is that education does not neces- 
sarily mean going to school. Continuing 
education and distance education are the 
two key concepts for broadening the scope 
of traditional education. 
Continuing education means giving 
those who have “outgrown” school-going 
age a chance to improve their skills or to 
retrain according to their needs or job- 
market demands. It also encourages the 
social reintegration of marginalized young 
people, like those, for example, who have 
been demobilized after a war. UNEsco has 
established a training programme of this 
kind in local languages for young Haitians, 
its existence it was sponsored by the 
Rothschild Foundation, which was its ini- 
tiator. But for the past few years enrol- 
ment and the sale of our own books (some 
450,000 per year) provide for 75 per cent 
of our budget, with the rest coming from 
the state. By way of comparison, govern- 
ment financial support for other institu- 
tions is about 75 per cent. It’s true, how- 
ever, that they are more heavily engaged 
in research than we are. 
Moreover, we don’t need a campus.

Palestinians, Rwandans and Mozambicans, 
and several scientific, technical and profes- 
sional training projects for women in sub- 
Saharan Africa are also on the drawing 
board. 
Distance should be no obstacle to educa 
tion. China, India and Brazil, which rank 
among the world’s nine most populated and 
least literate countries, are planning to over 
come the problems of distance by using satel 
lites to televise educational programmes. 
Studies have shown that although this kind 
of teaching is initially very costly, it may be 
more economical in the long run than tradi 
tional schooling. Unesco is doing all it can to 
promote effective partnership between gov- 
ernments, non-governmental organizations 
and business so that these countries can ben- 
efit from quality programmes and broad- 
casting technology.

the country’s primary or secondary 
schools, which we are able to use when

they are not occupied at specific times of 
the day. In this way distance education 
becomes one of the least costly educa- 
tional systems that exist. 
HB What are the other advantages of 
distance education? 
M. Y.: Apart from the fact that it enables 
working people or students living far from 
university towns to continue their studies 
near home, it offers the possibility of 
teaching beyond the borders of any given 
country. In this regard distance education 
can become a basic tool for building peace, 
especially in the Middle East where bor- 
ders have begun to open up. But opening 
borders isn’t enough. For people to cross 
them, education is essential. And when I 
talk about crossing borders I’m not refer- 
ring only to the physical sense; I mean 
exchanging ideas and establishing a real dia- 
logue. It is clear by now that with the 
advance in technology that enables us to 
reach the remotest villages distance edu- 
cation is the best way to establish this dia- 
logue. It is even likely that this form of 
teaching will gradually replace the more 
traditional form, which is for the moment 
at least still dominant just about every- 
where in the world. ||

by Fay Chung 
More than any other continent, Africa 
needs to rethink its education systems. 
All too often, the systems of education inher- 
ited from colonialism have been preserved in 
Africa more or less intact, generally on the 
grounds of “maintaining standards”. What 
this actually means is that a very small elite 
enjoys exactly the same kind of education as it 
would have in Europe, while the vast 
majority are deprived of any form of modern 
education whatever. 
The failure of these educated elites to 
transform their countries from feudal social 
structures and traditional subsistence agricul- 
ture is in marked contrast with the success of 
the East Asian elites who have managed to

ceeded so spectacularly? What role has edu- 
cation played in this? 
The Japanese model 
East Asia has been strongly influenced by the 
Japanese model. In the nineteenth century, 
the Japanese realized that it was essential for 
their survival as a nation to appropriate 
Western mathematics, science and tech- 
nology, whilst eschewing Western culture 
and social values. Compulsory primary edu- 
cation for all existed in Japan by 1870. The goal

of secondary education for all was subse- 
quently achieved, and after the Second World 
War access to post-secondary education 
became available for the majority. But while 
they sought to imitate, and later to surpass, 
Western science and technology, the 
Japanese insisted on the primacy of their own 
language, literature, culture and religion. 
Africa has not made such a conscious 
choice. The introduction of Western education 
into Africa by Christian missionaries meant that 
the educated elite was more steeped in Chris- 
tian theology, history, literature and culture than 
in science and technology. This strong bias 
towards the humanities still exists today. 
Probably the most visible symptom of 
this Western orientation was the rejection of 
African languages in the education system. 
Even now African languages are not taught in 
most French- or Portuguese-speaking coun- 
tries, and even some English-speaking coun- 
tries have denigrated the use of African lan- 
guages as “divisive” and “tribalistic”. To the 
African Christian convert African culture 
was synonymous with superstitition and

backwardness and was generally rejected as 
“uncivilized”. In other words, the educated 
African adopted the European conception of 
traditional African culture. 
Redefining the purpose of education 
Very few African countries have attained pri- 
mary education for all, despite the fact that 
many have been independent for some thirty 
years. At the secondary level, the record is 
even worse. Many African countries only 
provide secondary education for 4 or 5 per 
cent of the appropriate age group. In most 
African countries, less than one per cent of 
the relevant age group goes on to any form of 
post-secondary education, compared to 
between 25 and 75 per cent in the industrial-. 
ized countries. Those who do are unlikely to 
specialize in science or technology. 
It is within this context that we need to re- 
examine the connection between education 
and economic development on the one hand, 
and education and cultural values on the other. 
“Development” must be defined more 
clearly. At present Africa’s development 
strategy appears to be based almost exclusively 
on structural adjustment, although this is 
clearly a far too narrow and economist con- 
ceptualization of development, which does 
not take into account such extremely impor- 
tant factors as a country’s level of human-

resource development or its level of eco- 
nomic diversification and industrialization. 
Education also needs to be redefined. The 
systems and structures of the past should not 
be retained uncritically. Education must serve a 
purpose, and Africa needs to decide what that 
purpose is. While it has a critical role to play in 
economic development, it has an equally 
important role in creating and defining the 
values that will make Africa politically and cul- 
turally united, coherent and forward-looking. 
Only when the purpose of education has been 
clearly defined can Africa decide what type of 
education is suitable for its development. 
In deciding on that purpose the global vil- 
lage and the global market must be kept in 
mind. It is no longer possible for Africa to 
perpetuate its colonial and feudal heritages by 
continuing with the educational systems and 
structures of the past whilst ignoring the 
transformation of the rest of the world into 
technologically advanced industrialized 
economics. On the other hand, Africa is the 
least polluted and least environmentally dam- 
aged continent. As the latest entrant into the 
modernization process, it may be able to 
avoid the terrible environmental and human 
damage caused by that process. u

### 102615: The Children of Confucius

The children of Confucius 
by Zhou Nanzhao 
  
Education has played a central role in Asian tradition ever 
since the time of Confucius 
Asove, on the way to school. 
ZHOU NANZHAQ, 
a Chinese educator, is Vice- 
President and professor at the 
China National Institute for

In Asia learning has been cherished 
ever since the time of Confucius, who 
believed that human beings are perfectible 
and can be led along the right path through 
education. He emphasized the power of cdu- 
cation to improve society and to teach citi- 
zenship, and for centuries education was the 
foundation of the political, social, economic 
and cultural life of Asian peoples. 
© Attention has often been drawn to this pro- 
found appreciation of the value of education. 
Working Asian mothers, bending low in the

would enable their children to escape from 
poverty. Stories and images from many coun-

tries record Asian women’s aspirations for their 
children, ranging from the well-known figure 
of the Japanese mother who regards educating 
her offspring as her prime duty, to the Chinese 
mother who for years travelled long distances 
to evening classes and taught her disabled son 
with the notes she took, and Korean mothers 
who would sell their cows to pay for their chil- 
dren’s schooling. The writings of Mahatma 
Gandhi and the great Indian poet Rabindranath 
Tagore offer further testimony of the value 
attached to education by Asians. 
Not surprisingly, therefore, Asian parents 
and teachers have high expectations of the 
young, and studies have shown that these 
expectations go hand in hand with high cur- 
riculum standards, long hours spent on 
learning, strict training in intellectual skills, a 
high degree of parent-children interaction at 
home, close teacher-pupil relations at school 
and high educational achievement, especially 
in such intellectually demanding courses as

mathematics. Since there is no substantial dif- 
ference in the intelligence quotient of most 
children and no children are ineducable, it is 
clear that this cultural factor helps to account 
for the relatively high scholastic achieve- 
ments of many Asian students. 
Learning to be team players 
Traditionally, collectivism has taken prece- 
dence over individualism in Asian cultures, 
Confucianism emphasized the development 
of the individual as a member of the family 
and of society at large, and learning the rules 
of social relationships was considered an 
essential step towards becoming a maturc and 
responsible person. For centuries Chinese 
intellectuals upheld the moral ideal of 
“bearing the worries of the world before 
anyone elsc and enjoying the pleasures of life 
after all others”. This group-oriented attitude, 
classically displayed in the “tcam spirit” of the 
Japanese, has been conducive both to eco- 
nomic productivity and social cohesion. It 
partly explains why many Asians tend to dis- 
like the concept of competition among indi- 
viduals yet display a high degree of competi- 
tivity in a collective setting. 
Another cultural tradition that has shaped 
the Asian approach to education is an 
emphasis on the spiritual rather than the 
material dimension of development. Tradi- 
tional Chinese culture, for example, was 
essentially based on ethics, stressing the 
moral cultivation of the personality. Today it

tries the building of both “spiritual” and 
“material” civilizations is the twin goal of 
national development. 
The idea of a meritocracy based on per- 
formance in state cxaminations rather than on 
inherited wealth has long been accepted in 
Asia. Whereas the theoretical goal of Confu- 
cian education was the cultivation of the 
person in the ethical sense, in practice it 
tended to be more concerned with the 
preparation and selection of a ruling elite. For 
Confucius, education was a powerful instru- 
ment which this elite could use to govern the 
state. By education the ruler should “learn to 
care for the people” while the ruled “learned 
to bec obedient”. Care from above and obedi- 
ence from below were supposed to lead to a 
stable social order. The authority of the 
parent at home and that of the teacher at 
school went a long way to explain the disci- 
pline of most Asian students. 
Extended to the political and economic 
sphere, the authority of the state favoured a co- 
operative, harmonious relationship between

business and government and facilitated the 
implementation of government policy. 
Authoritarian modern government has been 
said to be one of the factors accounting for the 
economic miracles of East Asian countries. 
But if this is so, why have economies with 
cultural traditions that are supposedly so con- 
ducive to development only recently 
embarked on rapid growth? Some scholars 
have seen Confucianism as a conservative, 
anti-modernizing force. This might be an 
exaggeration, but it 1s safe to say that, apart 
from more fundamental economic and polit- 
ical factors that have hampered development, 
some features of traditional cultures partly 
explain why an industrial economy was so 
slow to take off in many Asian countries. 
These features include: : 
» the “politicization” of educational-cul- 
tural values and lack of governmental com- 
mitment to economic modernization. Educa- 
tional institutions were used as mere instru- 
ments in political strife and as an appendage 
to the government apparatus; 
» neglect of individuality. The collective 
interest was grossly over-emphasized and the 
individual was reduced to the status of an 
instrument; 
» focus on interpersonal relationships rather 
than on the conquest of nature. Over a long

period this resulted in the underdevelopment of 
science, engineering and applied technologies; 
» over-emphasis on classics-oriented exami- 
nations. Meritocracy based on success in 
examinations could be a motivating force for 
learning and career achievement irrespective 
of class, but over-emphasis on examinations 
in the Confucian classics suppressed the cre- 
ativity of many brilliant young minds. 
» contempt for pragmatism, utilitarianism 
and business. Confucian idealism neglected 
science and technology. It separated brain 
from hand and scholarship from craftsman- 
ship. The educated elite were entitled to rule 
simply by virtue of their “superior morality”, 
without having to acquire practical knowl- 
edge or skills. Matters of utilitarian value were 
despised, and business was regarded as an 
occupation of low social status. It is partly due 
to these cultural attitudes that vocational and

relegated to household drudgery and played a 
negligible role in society. This explains why 
girls received much less schooling than boys 
and also helps to account for the persistently 
high ratio of girls in the numbers of school 
dropouts in Asia (two-thirds during 1985- 
1992). Low educational levels among Asian 
women have resulted in high infant mortality, 
high population growth in rural areas, worse

globalization their educational systems have 
begun to advocate the teaching of a core of 
universal values. These values include: aware- 
ness of human rights combined with a sense 
of social responsibilities; social justice and 
democratic participation in decision-making 
and government; understanding and tolerance 
of cultural differences and pluralism; caring 
and co-operation; a spirit of enterprise, cre- 
ativity, sensitivity to equality of the sexes, 
open-mindedness to change and a sense of 
obligation to environmental protection and 
sustainable development. 
Most of these values are rooted in time- 
honoured cultural traditions. The “spirit of 
caring” is embedded in Confucian “benevo- 
lence” and Buddhist “mercy”. Sensitivity to 
environmental protection was expressed in 
ancient China by the Taoists’ concern about the 
destructive consequences of technology on 
natural resources. Altruism has been respected 
as the highest human value in Asia for hundreds

of years. In the coming century humankind 
may find that elements of the wisdom of Con- 
fucianism are as relevant as they were long ago. 
One way of fostering universal values for 
future centuries, therefore, is to educate the 
young with great books of the past. 
Another approach that should be fostered 
is educational bridge-building between East 
and West. Culturally East and West are com- 
patible and complementary. The Confucian 
scholar-official selected according to merit 
rather than hereditary privilege is close to the 
ancient Greek idea of “government by the 
best”. If East and West can learn from each 
other and integrate each others cultural 
strengths—individual initiative with team 
spirit, competitiveness with co-operative- 
ness, technological skills with moral quali- 
ties—then universal values and a global ethic 
will gradually develop. This renewal of cul- 
tures is a great contribution that education can 
make to humanity. [|

This dossier provides a brief glimpse of UNESCO's activities in education, which are at the heart of its 
mission to construct “the defences of peace in the minds of men”. These activities have two fun- 
CO damental aims. The first is to make the right to education a reality for everyone on earth. The 
second is to help UNesco’s Member States construct and renovate their education systems to meet 


### 102616: Worldwide action for education

WORLDWIDE ACTION FOR EDUCATION 
Unesco's work is underpinned by three separate institutes: 1BE and IIEP deal with comparative 
education and educational planning respectively. Lifelong education, literacy and adult education are covered by UIE. 
  
THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF EDUCATION 
(IBE) 
P.O. Box 199, 1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland 
: Tel. (41 22) 798 14 55 
Fax (41 22) 798 14 86 
Internet: http://www.unicc.org/ibe 
The International Bureau of Education is a 
study and information centre in comparative 
education. Founded as a private organization in 
Geneva in 1925, the IBE became the first inter- 
governmental organization in the field of edu- 
cation in 1929. In 1969, the IBE changed its 
status and became an integral part of UNESCO, 
while retaining broad intellectual autonomy. 
The IBE prepares and organizes the Inter- 
national Conference on Education (ICE), which 
is convened every two ycars in Geneva by the 
Director-General of Unesco. Each session of 
the Conference deals with a specific theme and 
leads to the adoption of an international recom- 
mendation on that theme addressed to Minis- 
ters of Education worldwide. The forty-fifth 
session of the Conference will be held in 1996 
on the theme “Strengthening the role of 
teachers in a changing world”. 
The Bureau houses a documentation centre, 
which contains more than 100,000 books, docu- 
ments, periodicals and microfiches. There is a 
large collection of national reports on cduca- 
tional developments and innovations. 
The IBE organizes training activities in the 
form of a scholars-in-residence programme, 
workshops and brief courses on the tech- 
niques of librarianship. 
It also publishes education studies and ref- 
erence works, such as the International Year- 
book of Education and the UNESCO: IBE Edu- 
cation Thesaurus, as well as newsletters and 
periodicals. UNESCO’s quarterly Prospects is the 
IBE’s main international review of comparative 
education.

The UNEsco Institute for Education was estab- 
lished in 1951 in Hamburg, Germany. It 
focuses on adult and non-formal education 
within the framework of lifelong learning, and 
specifically on adult literacy and continuing 
education. UIE’s activities include research, 
training and documentation dissemination on a 
worldwide scale. 
36 
Decisions on programme activities and the 
budget are made by the UTE Governing Board 
and UNEScO’s General Conference. The Insti- 
tute’s financial resources are provided by 
UNESCO, the German government, the author- 
ities of the Hanseatic City of Hamburg and 
other funding sources. 
Currently, the Institute’s main tasks include: 
* collecting and analysing information on 
rescarch in the ficld of adult education. Partic- 
ular attention is given to educational opportuni- 
ties for migrants, minorities and other under- 
privileged communities, to women and literacy; 
* conducting co-operative research projects 
related to non-formal basic education for adults 
and out-of-school youth, including projects on 
the development of alternative learning 
approaches for the latter, the use of mother 
tongues and national languages in literacy and 
post-literacy work in industrialized countries; 
# strengthening information exchanges and 
the extension of networks in the field of adult 
and continuing education. 
The Institute houses a documentation 
centre and a library specializing in literacy and 
continuing education, containing over 50,000 
publications and documents. 
UIE publications include the International 
Review of Education, handbooks and refer- 
ence works, studies on literacy in industrialized 
countries, reports and a newsletter.

The I1EP, which was established in 1963, is a 
centre for advanced training and research in the 
field of educational planning and administra- 
tion. It contributes to the development of edu- 
cation throughout the world, by expanding 
knowledge and training professionals. It acts as 
a focus for the exchange of ideas and concepts 
in educational planning and administration, 
It 1s financed mainly by a UNESCO grant- 
in-aid, voluntary contributions from UNESCO 
Member States and contract resources. 
Training is the cornerstone of IIEP’s oper- 
ations, The number of participants in its nine- 
month Annual Training Programme has passed 
the 1,000 mark, while over 3,100 people have 
attended the intensive courses and workshops 
which IIEP organizes in a number of countries 
and sub-regions. 
IIEP’s research and study programmes are 
relevant to UNESCO's main priorities on basic 
education for all and human resource develop- 
ment, and lead to the production of training 
materials and modules. 
Topics covered in the 1990-1995 period 
included improvement of the quality of educa- 
tion; access to education for disadvantaged 
groups and ways of reducing inequalities; man- 
agement of the transition from school to work; 
Slanning science cducation for secondary 
schools; new trends in technical and vocational 
education; institutional management of higher 
education as well as educational financing, man- 
agement and administration. 
IEP disseminates new technical concepts 
in educational planning through a large-scale 
programme of publications and documenta- 
tion. Some 700 titles have been published so far. 
The 11EP Documentation Centre has a 
stock of some 37,000 books and documents, 
and subscribes to around 500 periodicals 
dealing with educational planning and related 
subjects.

REGIONAL ACTION 
Two regional centres play an important role in the field of 
post-secondary education: CRESALC for Latin America 
and the Caribbean and CEPES for Europe.

Established in 1978 in Caracas (Venezuela), CRESALC pro- 
motes regional co-operation in higher education and assists 
UNESCO Member States in Latin America and the Caribbean 
in their efforts to develop and improve national systems of 
higher education. 
It also promotes the mobility of academic personnel, 
serving as the secretariat for the application of the Regional 
Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and 
Degrees in Higher Education. 
CRESALC is closely involved in the implementation of 
UNITWIN (see this page). A UNESCO Chair in Human 
Rights has been established in co-operation with the national 
Council of Universities in Venezuela. It publishes a bi-annual 
journal, Revista Educacion Superior y Sociedad, and a quar- 
terly bulletin, Boletin CRESALC.

The European Centre for Higher Education (CEPES) was 
established in Bucharest (Romania) in 1972. It serves as a hub 
for the collection and exchange of information and experi- 
ence, a forum and a centre for the promotion of research and 
development in UNESCO’s European region (which includes 
Israel, Turkey and North America). 
It is also a focal point for several specialized networks 
connected with such issues as higher education rescarch, staff 
development and women’s studies. 
CEPES houses a library and documentation centre which 
contains some 27,000 documents. [ts capacity for co-opera- 
tion has been enhanced by the setting up of the UNICOM 
electronic network. 
CEPES publications include a quarterly, Higher Educa- 
tion in Europe (in English, French and Russian).

EDUCATION FOR PEACE 
The Associated Schools Project (ASP) 
Since it was launched in 1953 the ASP network has sought to 
strengthen the commitment of children and young people to 
international understanding and peace. 
Participating schools arc invited to organize programmes 
relating to education pilot projects on one of four main themes: 
the study of world problems and the role of the United Nations 
system in solving them; human rights; other peoples and their 
cultures; the environment. 
Associated Schools act as a springboard for the inclusion of 
UNESCO's ideals and concerns in school curricula. 
As of February 1996 more than 3,638 educational institutions 
on all age levels in 129 countries belong to the network, with 
numbers increasing every month.

THE REGIONAL PROGRAMMES 
Expanding and reforming primary education 
and promoting adult education 
The building blocks of UNESCO’ global action in favour of literacy and education for all are its 
regional projects and programmes for literacy: the Major Project in the ficld of Education in 
Latin America and the Caribbean; the Regional Programme for the Eradication of Illiteracy in 
Africa; the Asian and Pacific Programme of Education for All; and the Regional Programme 
for the Universalization and Renewal of Primary Education and the Eradication of Illiteracy in 
the Arab States by the year 2000. 
In addition, an information-exchange network based at the UIE facilitates co-operation 
between industrialized countries faced with problems of “functional illiteracy”, L.c. an inability to 
read and write sufficiently well to cope with the challenges of life in complex modern societies. 
The regional literacy programmes are based on two fundamental principles: technical co- 
operation between developing countries and the need to combat illiteracy through a global 
approach combining the universalization and renewal of primary education with stepped-up 
literacy work among out-of-school youth and adults. 
All programmes give special attention to the education of women and girls and to literacy 
follow-up activities designed to encourage the reading habit. 
Progress towards regional goals evidently depends upon the success of national efforts, 
but in many countries these efforts are faltering because of the economic crisis which has 
severely restricted the development of education. 
Fortunately, there is a growing realization that education is the key to development, and 
the commitment of the international community has increased since the World Conference 
on Education for All held in Jomtien (Thailand) in 1990.

A SPEARHEAD FOR HIGHER 
EDUCATION 
The UNITWIN/Unesco Chairs Programme 
The key objective of this programme 
launched in 1991 is to develop a spirit of 
solidarity based on twinning, networking 
and ther linking arrangements among uni- 
versities throughout the world. More 
specifically, it is designed to make full use 
of North-South and East-West co-opera- 
tion in order to set in motion a process 
leading to strong and durable links between 
higher education and scientific institutions 
worldwide, especrally along the South- 
South axis. 
UNITWIN helps to establish sub- 
regional, regional and inter-regional net- 
works of higher education and research 
institutions (there are 46 inter-university 
networks). The UNEscO Chairs (215 in 
over 80 countries) are intended to provide 
postgraduate students from the devel- 
oping countries with enhanced opportu- 
nities for advanced training and research 
at centres of excellence in key disciplines 
related to sustainable development. 
Partnerships have been established 
with other United Nations agencies, in 
particular with the United Nations Uni- 
versity (UNU), inter-governmental orga- 
nizations, development aid agencies, 
foundations, industry and non-govern- 
mental organizations in the higher educa- 
tion and scientific fields.

Education for all: making it work 
At the World Conference on Education 
for All (Jomtien, Thailand, 1990) 155 
countries pledged to provide basic educa- 
tion for all children and adults. 
The search for innovation and fresh 
ideas has led UNESCO and UNICEF to 
launch a joint project: “Education for All: 
Making it Work”. The project identifies 
the latest innovations in school systems 
and practice in Africa, Asia, Latin America 
and the Arab states by a continuous on- 
the-ground search using networks and 
partners in education ministries, teachers’ 
associations, the research community and 
local educational authorities. 
The project provides wide access to 
these new ideas in education and shows 
how they work, through booklets, 
videos, databases, thematic portfolios and 
workshops.

### 102617: 1996: International Year for the Eradication of Poverty

  
  
or there to be peace, there must be 
EF knowledge and acknowledgment of 
others. Peace means lasting respect for 
differences; peace means never threatening 
that most important possession of all: life itself. 
At the dawn of the third millennium, I call 
on each and évery one of us to make a public 
announcement in the schools, in the worlds of 
sport and the arts, in the media and within 
government administrations: human life must 
no longer be threatened. The act of killing has 
no justification and above all no religious vin- 
dication—religions are founded on love and 
generosity—nor can there be any cultural, 
nationalistic or ideological justification. If we 
really wish to leave a peaceful world to our 
children, we must with the greatest firmness 
forbid all threats to human life. 
- Dialogue and tolerance 
This 1s the one essential condition whereby a 
culture of war—of force, constraint, oppres- 
ston, inequality—can be transformed into a 
culture of peace. A culture of peace requires: 
dialogue, tolerance and awareness of the infi- 
nite diversity of humanity. The ethical values 
embodied in UNESCO’s Constitution: justice, 
freedom, particularly freedom of speech, “the 
free flow of ideas by word and image”— 
equality, solidarity—*“the intellectual and moral 
solidarity of mankind”—only through these

THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY 
values can humanity enjoy peace, peace lived 
every day—which means happiness. 
Dialogue and tolerance are not to be 
equated merely with docility and acceptance 
of the opinions of others. On the contrary, 
dialogue and tolerance mean choosing a new 
way of life, a new way of reaching agree- 
ment—with no bloodshed, no loss of life, no 
violence, none of war’s perversity. Dialogue 
and tolerance mean pursuing with both deter- 
mination and compassion the non-violent set- 
tlement of conflicts. 
Peace and development 
There can be no lasting peace without sustain- 
able development, without endogenous devel- 
opment, through the uprooting of frustration, 
poverty and exclusion. Only by conferring on 
each person the possibility of deciding for him 
or herself—and thus being in charge of his or 
her own destiny—can we hope to reduce pop- 
ulation growth, reduce migration, improve the 
quality of life in rural settings, understand—and 
help those who govern to understand—that 
peace and the environment are the concerns of 
each and every one of us. 
Sustainable development has one essential 
key word: sharing. We should share all 
resources—starting with knowledge. At both 
international and domestic levels, land, finance, 
knowledge and know-how are the preserve of

a very small minority. This inequality consti- 
tutes a threat to world stability and security. 
Such inequality is incompatible with the need 
for a lasting democracy—democracy being the 
third side to the interactive, interdependent tri- 
angle: peace, development, democracy. 
Education for democracy 
Only education can ensure a true democracy, 
one where all citizens participate: “I partici- 
pate, therefore I exist”! I am “counted” in sur- 
veys, polls and elections. But I must also 
“count”. If I am not taken into account, 
democracy 1s only a name, a facade, an autoc- 
racy or a disguised plutocracy. Lasting democ- 
racy is the only political system where human 
rights are respected. To this end, decisive steps 
must be taken to strengthen the legal and judi- 
cial system and provide the rule of law with 
the rigour and speed it needs. Human 
resources must be increased for the fight 
against violence and for making public 
freedom a synonym for security. The United 
Nations system and particularly its peace- 
building and conflict-prevention capacities 
must be strengthened in order to confront 
transnational problems—whether economic, 
political or cultural (drug and arms trafficking, 
money laundering, terrorism, etc.). 
  


### 102617: 1996: International Year for the Eradication of Poverty

‘Disarming’ history 
Peace, development and democracy can be 
achieved through education, but only if educa- 
tion is for everyone, by everyone and with 
~ everyone. This is neither a question of donations 
nor of selling a prototype; education is an 
everyday, personal achievement. Through edu- 
cation, society as a whole—civil, military and 
religious—can be taught to eradicate violence, to 
prevent potential conflict and to build peace. 
Teachers cannot instil in schools the oppo- 
site of a child’s experience in the outside 
world. Principles and values, the links 
between all differences and all cultures, can 
only be learned through example. How can 
peaceful behaviour be learned if schoolbooks 
tell only of war and violence? How can we 
move from the concept of might being right 
to that of right being might without “dis- 
arming” history and showing the tremendous 
contributions of philosophers, scientists, 
inventors and artists? 
The United Nations—and therefore all 
nations—has designated 1996 the Year for the 
Eradication of Poverty. We are primarily 
thinking, of course, of the least-developed 
countries. But we must not forget the poor, the 
far too numerous excluded people in the most- 
developed countries. The misery of the shanty- 
towns, the street children, the exploitation of 
young people—all are reasons for our collec- 
tive shame. But those of us who are well off and 
think of marginalization as being beyond 
society and therefore beyond our concern, 
should open our eyes and take notice. The 
whole of society, including the armed forces— 
who will become peace-builders—must work 
together for our common future. Whether we 
are aware of it or not, the world is one world. 
Parliamentarians, elected representatives of the 
people, must ensure that budget priorities fit in 
with the terms of a moral world contract. Such 
a contract must be long-term and take account 
of future generations with the vision that “we, 
the peoples” must have in order for our chil- 
dren to be spared “the scourge of war”. 
I invite all states, parliaments, mayors, local 
governments, teachers, journalists, intellec- 
tuals, sports associations and youth groups to 
work together so that 1996 may give fresh 
impetus to the historic transition from a cul- 
ture of war to a culture of peace. |

### 102618: Talamanca - La Amistad, natural bond between two countries

Bestriding Costa Rica and Panama, 
the Talamanca-La Amistad Cordillera 
is a patchwork of natural parks and 
reserves covering more than 800,000 
Liectares. It was registered on 
UNEsco’s World Heritage List in 1990 
FROILAN ESCOBAR GONZALEZ 
is a Cuban journalist who has twice won the National 
Critics’ Award of Cuba, for his books Marti a flor de 
labios { “Marti, On the Tip of the Tongue”, 1993) and La 
vigja que vuela (“The Old Woman with Wings”, 1994).

A ccording to an ancient legend of 
the Bribri and Cabecar Indians, 
the huge platform formed by the 
Cordillera de Talamanca, whose peaks 
between Costa Rica and Panama rise to 
an altitude of almost 4,000 metres 
above sea level, was the site where the 
god Sibi decided to set up house and 
sow the maize sceds that would give 
birth to humankind. 
According to this legend, the cre- 
ation took place at the source of the 
Lari River in Surayum, where Sibi orga- 
nized great festivities, handing out 
lavish quantities of cacao to each person 
who had helped him. When they were 
over, he bronght forward young Iriria, 
the Earth, so that she could cover the 
rock with her fertile bridal train, and 
the world began to turn green. Then 
Sibi fell asleep after asking the cuyeo 
bird to sing for him that night,

Science, on the other hand, tells us 
that this imposing mountain range rose 
up some 30 million years ago. The enor- 
mous pressure exerted by tectonic and 
voleanic movements caused uplifts 
during the Pliocene epoch which even- 
tually filled in the oeeanie basin then 
separating North America from South 
America, and which took on their pre- 
sent shape about 7 million years ago. 
So it was that a narrow strip of land 
(its width between the Pacific and 
Atlantic Oceans is barely more than 150 
km) came into existence and formed a 
veritable bridge between two biologically 
different continents. The abundance and 
variety of its endemie speeies can be put 
down to this genetic convergence of flora 
and fauna from two distinct regions. 
Otliers factors include the region’s 
geographical position and its topograpl- 
ical and climatic diversity. The proximity

of the Atlantic and the Pacific tempers 
the fierce tropical heat. But variations in 
altitude—from sea level to the 3,820-

cordillera’s highest point—mean that the 
climate displays wide temperature dif-

A FOREST IN TIE CLOUDS 
Because of these climatic features and 
the richness of its soil, the region offers 
a wide palette of different landscapes 
and biotopes. 
The very humid forest found at trop- 
ical level has a varied, complex and het- 
crogeneous flora, which includes tall 
bushy trees covered with cpiphytic 
plants sueh as liana, which ean grow as 
thick as a human torso. lts fauna is 
equally varied, and eomprises snakes,

whose colours enliven an impenetrable 
environment niore luxuriant even than the 
jungles imagined by Wifredo Lam or 
Douanier Rousseau. 
A LILLIPUTIAN LANDSCAPE 
Above 3,000 metres, the forest gives 
way to a damp and inhospitable zone 
known as the pdremo. The reddish, 
dwarfish vegetation, no more than two 
metres in height, found on this shrubby 
steppe consists mainly of bamboo, 
and myrtle whose 
branehes have twisted under the effect 
of wind, frost, drizzle and the abrupt 
temperature changes characteristic of 
grasses, ferns

found elsewhere in the region. 
This is the point where the range of 
many plant species of Andean origin

two species of bird, lizards, one species 
of salamander, insects and spiders 
which adapt their activity to tempera- 
ture variations during the day and fall

into a state of lethargy at night to slow 
down their metabolism. Certain species 
of rodent as well as rabbit are also 
found in this area. They are hunted by 
forest felines such as the jaguar (Pan- 
thera onca), the ocelot (Felis pardalis), 
the tiger cat (Felis tigrina) and the 
jaguarundi (Felis eyra). 
VALLEYS OF 
DESOLATE BEAUTY 
The Talamanca-La Amistad reserve is the 
only site in Central America where the 
Quaternary glaciations left an indelible 
mark. The visitor ventnring up to the 
summits of the mountain range can 
observe almost intact glacial [orma- 
tions—deep U-shaped valleys, moraines, 
lakes, cirques—which testify to the exis- 
tence of great glaciers during the Pleis- 
tocene epoch some 25,000 years ago, 
The many valleys fashioned by the 
glaciers have a desolate beauty. They 
include the Savannah of the Lions, 
named after the mountain lions (Felis 
concolor) that live there; the Valley of 
the Rabbits, a vast expanse of sand sur- 
rounded by roeky peaks and inhabited 
by rabbits; the mysterious Valley of the 
Ridges, where the soil’s high iron con- 
tent causes magnetic disturbances 
which disorientate compass needles; 
and the Valley of the Moraines and the 
Valley of the Lakes, which are dotted 
with some 30 crystalline lakes. It is here 
that you may catch a glimpse of Baird’s 
tapir (Tapirus bairdii) as it swims in one 
of these often iee-covered lakes, or as it 
races along—it is a powerful 200-kg 
animal two metres long—in an attempt 
to escape its main enemy, the jaguar, 
one of six big cats found in Talamanea, 
but now almost extinct. 
A RIBD WORSHIPPED 
BY TIE AZTECS 
The sighting of a quetzal, a bird of leg- 
endary beauty, as it takes off, leaving a 
golden-green streak in the air, is a par- 
ticularly rare privilege, since the virgin 
forest above 1,200 metres where it lives 
is steadily being destroyed. 
The bird gets its name [rom the 
Aztecs, who called it quetzaltototl and 
worshipped it. They used its feathers 
to decorate the god Quetzalcoatl, who 
was represented as a feathered serpent.

Two subspecies of the bird are found 
in the area between Mexico and Panama, 
but only one (Pharomachrus mocinno 
costarricensis) inhabits this steep 
cordillera. The female lays two eggs in a 
nest in the hole of a tree, and takes it in 
turns with the male to brood. When (uet- 
zals breed, which is twice a year, the male 
damages its magnificent plumage by flying 
in and out of the nest, and after the young 
birds have left the nest it moults and 
grows its feathers again.

Another interesting sight is the flight 
of hummingbirds, tiny creatures capable 
of flying in any direction (including back- 
wards) or remaining in stationary {light as 
they gather nectar from flowers. Their 
wings beat sixty times a second and their 
heart up to 1,440 times a minute. One of 
the most picturesque of these birds is the 
fire-breasted hummingbird (Panterpe 
insignis), which is endemic to the high 
areas in this region. It is 11 em long and 
weighs 5.7 g. 
Avery different sight is the majestic 
flight of the harpy eagle (Ilarpia 
harpyja), which is in danger of 
becoming extinct because of the exces- 
sive use of pesticides and uncontrolled 
deforestation. 
But these are only a few of the 600 
bird species that have been identificd 
in the Talamanca cordillera (as many as 
all those found in North America). 
SIRU°S CHILDREN 
In addition to its natural wonders, the 
region contains a great many archaeolog- 
ical remains. Over 200 sites have been dis- 
covered (tombs, stone columns, petro- 
glyphs) which cover more than 12,000 
years of history, from the preceramic 
period to the tribal societies encountered 
by Europeans in the sixteenth century. 
Study of them will reveal more informa- 
tion about the pre-Columbian cultures of 
the region and the links between Meso- 
American and South American cultures. 
The indigenous peoples of Panama, 
the Guaymi and Teribe, like those of 
Costa Rica, the Bribri and Cabecar, are 
descended from tribes which peopled 
the valleys of Central America’s mountain 
ranges at the time of the Spanish con- 
quest. Despite being in contact with “civ- 
ilization” for almost five eenturies, they 
have managed to preserve their language, 
beliefs and lifestyle. They have a thor- 
ough and detailed knowledge of natural 
resources and have suceeeded in 
exploiting them through farming (maize, 
haricot beans, bananas, rice), an activity 
which they pursue in conjunction with 
hunting and fishing without endangering 
the region’s ecological balance. 
These indigenous communities, 
which number about 10,000 people, 
currently live in reserves. They not only 
suffer from high mortality, malnutrition 
and illiteracy, they are also threatened 
by the considerable pressure put on the 
ecosystem by the activities of farmers 
and ranchers, who are moving closer and 
closer to their territories. ||

FRANCE BEQUETTE 
is a Franco-American 
journalist 
specializing in 
environmental 
questions. 
| n the aftermath of the explosion 
of reactor no. 4 at the Chernobyl 
(Ukraine) nuclear power plant on 
26 April 1986, more than 4 million 
people living in Belarus, Ukraine 
and Russia were exposed to radia- 
tion. “The Chernobyl disaster is 
now recognized as having been the 
greatest technological eatastrophe 
in human history,” writes Belaru- 
sian geneticist V. K. Savehenko in 
his recently published study The 
Ecology of the Chernobyl Cata- 
strophe (see bibliography at end of 
article). 
More than 1.7 million persons 
are estimated to have heen exposed 
to higher than normal levels of radi- 
ation; 850,000 of them still live in 
the contaminated areas, and 
280,000 should he relocated hut 
liave nowhere to go. For ten days on 
end burning graphite in the reactor 
spewed radioactive gas and aerosol 
particles into the atmosphere. 
Nearly 50 million curies! in all, or 
77 kilograms of various radioactive 
substances (the most lethal being 
iodine-131, eaesium-134 and -137, 
strontinm-90 and plutoninm-239}), 
were cast over extensive distances 
(from 300 to 400 kilometres), 
while lighter air-horne particles 
drifted to countries as far away as 
the United States, India and 
Kuweit. 
‘IIALF-LIFE’ WORSE 
THAN ‘NO-LIFE’ 
  
The [ull impaet of the ecological 
disaster can be measured hy 
studying the half-life2 of iodine- 
131 (8 days), cacsium-134 (8 days), 
strountium-90 (28 days), cacsium- 
137 (30 days) and plutonium-239 
(24,100 years!). The half-life of a 
substance has to be multiplied by 
an average of 10 or 15 to under- 
stand how long it will take for 
radioactive substances to disappear 
entirely from the environment. 
short half-life, 
iodine-131 is the most harmful ele- 
Despite its 
ment for the moment. The human 
organism needs iodine, but unfor- 
tunately it does not distinguish 
between the stable element and the 
radioaetive one. Merely inhaled or 
lodged in the food chain, it settles 
in the thyroid gland where it can 
cause caneer. Children and babies 
arc especially vulnerable. 
Because of their high solubility, 
eaesium-137 and strontium-90 are 
the principal culprits in contami- 
nating soil and plants, which they 
enter via the root-system. Concen- 
trated in the food chain, they settle 
in the muscles (caesinm-137) and 
on bone surfaces (strontium-90). 
Strontium-90 replaces caleium in 
the hone marrow, thereby opening

the door to blood diseases such as 
anaemia and leukemia. 
Plutonium is, however, the most 
dangerous element by far (the 
intake of a single microgram is 
lethal to human beings). The heav- 
iest of the elements released by 
Chernobyl, it is not casily absorbed 
by plants and is radioactive only 
over a short distance. Its fallout 
was minimal and affected the 
immediate vicinity of the power 
station, an area thereby condemned 
to several tens of thousands of years 
of dangerous sterility. 
SURVIVING IN TIIE 
CONTAMINATED AREAS 
 
The disaster’s ecological effects— 
apart from the harm done to human 
life—are still largely unknown. 
Grassy plains and fields and flat, bare 
ground are the kinds of terrain that 
are most seriously contaminated. 
Some 144,000 hectares of agricul- 
tural land and 492,000 hectares of 
forest have been withdrawn {rom 
normal use over a long period. 
Radionuclides concentrated in the 
sediment at the bottom of standing 
water (lakes, swanips, reservoirs and 
the like}, are absorbed by animal and 
plant life. In the forest radioactivity 
concentrates In tree bark, moss, 
lichen and muashrooms and in leaves 
and pine needles, which contaminate 
the soil when they fall to the ground. 
In some areas it is forbidden to 
gather firewood. When burned, the 
wood contaminates ovens, and its ash 
used as fertilizer contaminates soil 
and crops. 
Alot of pastureland is unusable. 
Forage from the wet plains, which 
is extremely contaminated, can only 
be used as a last resort. Dairy prod- 
ucts must not be consumed before 
44 
being specially processed. Around 
Chernobyl milk is used as an indi- 
eator of the contamination level; 
when milk is acceptable for con- 
sumption, other products from the 
same farm can also be consumed. 
In response to the thonsand and 
one questions asked by the stricken 
populations, Belarus has produced 
a 55-page booklet entitled Radia- 
tion: Ilow to Survive in the Radia- 
tion Contaminated Areas. Potatoes 
and grain crops are the food crops 
least prone to contamination. 
Among fruit and berries red and 
black currants are more liable to 
contamination than apples and 
pears. The booklet strongly urges 
people who grow their own produce 
to use mineral (phosphorus and 
potassium) and organic (manure, 
guano and humus) fertilizers in 
their gardens and orchards because 
these seem to prevent the plants 
from absorbing radionuclides. 
The booklet gives a lot of down- 
to-earth the 
methods for washing, cooking and 
advice on best 
preserving food. Salting and mari- 
nating meat, for example, is one of 
the best ways to rid it of caesium- 
137, which stays in the brine. Gen- 
erally speaking, poultry and cattle 
may be consumed if they have been 
penned in and fed only uncontami- 
nated (imported) food for a month 
or a month and a half before being 
slaughtered. Meat and animal by- 
products must undergo a radiolog- 
ical test. A network of labs and 
monitoring centres has been devel- 
oped for this purpose. 
It is strongly recommended to 
keep houses dust-free, to leave 
working clothes outdoors, to wash 
often with soap, not to wash clothes 
in rainwater, to wear face-masks for

eertain activities, to drink plenty of 
diuretic and laxative infusions and 
eat food rich in protein, vitamins 
and mineral salts in order to 
strengthen the body’s defences. It 
takes several months for the humau 
body to eliminate caesium. 
MENTAL ITARDSHIP 
 
Obeying this advice is unfortunately 
not possible for the 400,000 dis- 
placed persons who are now penni- 
less and jobless in a region they do 
not know. They are tortured by the 
fear that they are harbouring some 
terrible disease caused by radiation. 
Is their pessimism justified? Are 
they right to fear the worst? 


### 102619: Chernobyl today

UNESCO'S CHERNOBYL PROGRAMME 
Unesco has an ongoing programme to aid the countries 
affected by the Chemobyl disaster by means of operations to 
remedy its consequences and to promote economic and social 
development in the areas concerned. 
Twenty-nine Unesco Member States are taking part in the 
programme, which has some 150 full-time employees working 
in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The programme's financial 
resources currently amount to more than $9 million. 
In consultation with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, Unesco 
has proposed more than 70 projects in its fields of compe- 
tence (education, science, culture, communication and social 
science), some thirty of which are underway or have already 
been completed. 
Nine community development centres for social and psy- 
chological rehabilitation have been set up in the worst-hit com 
munities. Since they were opened in 1993, they have received 
nearly 160,000 visitors, the vast majority of whom have been 
children (90,000) and young adults (almost 40,000). 
Teaching materials on the themes of energy, the environ- 
ment and development incorporate lessons leamed from the 
Chernobyl disaster and highlight altemative energy sources.

### 102619: Chernobyl today

To help Chernobyl victims cope 
with psychological and social disor- 
ders triggered by the disaster, since 
1991 UNESCO has opened nine com- 
munity centres for children and 
adults in the resettlement areas 
near the stricken region. A World 
ITealth Organization (WII0) Con- 
ference on the health consequences 
of Chernobyl, held in November 
1995, noted that the increase in 
psychologieal problems lias been 
accompanied by a marked rise in 
"thyroid cancer in children nnder- 
fifteen in Belarns, (a thirty-fold rise 
since 1986), and in Ukraine, where 
the numbers of such cases have 
increased at least ten-fold. 
Scientists believe that the rates 
of leukemia and other blood ail- 
ments, as well as breast eancer, 
bladder cancer and kidney discases 
could also increase over the next 
few years. Studies carried out in 
Japan ten years after the atomic 
bombing of Iliroshima and 
Nagasaki showed a sharp rise in the 
incidence of these diseases. 
Although preliminary reports on 
the state of health of the workers 
(some 600,000 
brought to Chernobyl in the first 
“liquidators™) 
weeks after the accident show no 
increase in death-rates, they do 
reveal a big jump in the incidence 
of common ailments, a high rate of 
ncuropsychological disorders and 
premature aging. 
GLACIERS: NATURE’S ARCHIVES 
OF NUCLEAR ACTIVITY 
The psycho-social effects experi- 
enced by the affected populations 
were singled out for priority at the 
WIIO conference. “In particular,” 
noted Dr. Iliroshi Nakajima, 
Director-General of WIIO, “these 
have included anxiety over the pos- 
sible ill effects of radiation ou their 
health in the long term. Originally, 
much fear and mistrust lad 
occurred because of the lack of 
information immediately after the 
accident, which caused many psy- 
clrosomatic disorders”. Ileadaches, 
cliest pains, intestinal disorders, 
sleep disturbance, loss of concentra- 
tion, and alcohol abuse are common- 
place. Similar psycho-soeial effects 
can be observed in the wake of 
earthquakes, fires, floods and other 
natural and man-made disasters. 
Aeeording to psychologist Lubow 
Iorich, co-ordinator of the nine 
reluabilitation centres, “People . . . 
continue to be suspicious of most 
information available”. Fact-gath- 
ering in the nuclear field is hard; 
tempers flare quickly; fact and fic- 
tion intertwine. Some people 
believe, for example, that radioac- 
tive contamination is contagious; 
others believe that red wine and 
vodka neutralize radiation! 
Chernobyl is the eighth nuclear 
accident of which glaciologists have 
found undeniable traces in glaciers. 
Glaciers have also recorded all the 
atmospheric nuclear tests carried 
out by the major powers between 
1954 and 1963. Snow and ice 
imprison all radioactive elements 
carried by air currents. Moreover, tt 
is impossible to confuse natural and 
artificial radionuclides. Radioactive 
fallout acts as a reference level for 
elaeiologists, enabling the different 
layers of snow to le aceurately 
dated. This means that it is futile to 
try to hide or minimize the faets: 
nuclear safety goes far beyond mere 
national boundaries.

1,000 community gardens, and Berlin some 80,000. In the 
developing world, urban farming is a source of income for about 
100 million people, and a food source for nearly half a billion. 
The most comprehensive global research on urban food pro- 
duction to date has been conducted by the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) with assistance from The 
Urban Agriculture Network (TUAN), which is based in Washington 
D.C. TUAN has documented urban farming practices in more 
than 20 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America and has dis- 
covered that between 25 and 75 per cent of urban families world- 
wide are engaged in food production at least part of the time. 
Farmers in 18 of China's largest cities meet 85 per cent of the 
urban demand for vegetables and more than half the demand for 
meat. In the United States farms in metropolitan areas account 
for more than a third of all crop and livestock sales. In Java, 
urban home gardens supply an estimated 18 per cent of the 
calories and 14 per cent of the protein consumed in the island's 
cities. Some 20 per cent of the food needs of Buenos Aires are 
met by urban gardens. It is generally estimated that these prod- 
ucts are from 30 to 60 per cent richer in micro-nutrients than 
those found in supermarket stock. 
Community gardens are also the ideal place for recycling 
sewage and solid waste. But air pollution is a problem: food 
grown along roadsides can be contaminated by lead from 
exhaust emissions. When the air is polluted, it is better to 
grow tomatoes and fruit rather than lettuce. it would appear, 
nonetheless, that lettuce concentrates less lead if it grows in 
soil with a high content of rubbish-based compost. 
In the poor neighbourhood of Jerusalén, in the southern 
suburb of Bogota, a local non-governmental organization (Las 
Gaviotas) uses hydroponic techniques, i.e. growing is done 
either in a 15-centimetre-deep mixture of rice husks and coal 
chips or entirely in water. With support from the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) over 100 people learned to 
grow high-quality vegetables on rooftops and in other unused 
spaces. The crops provide families with additional income and 
fresh vegetables. Even the local school has its own rooftop veg- 
etable patch, where students and neighbourhood inhabitants 
take courses in hydroponic agriculture. [|

VANUATU, THE LAND 
OF FRUIT TREES 
There are some 40 species of fruit and nut trees in 
Melanesia’s Vanuatu Islands. Some are endemic, 
while others were introduced by the first migrants 
more than 2,000 years ago. It is now hard to dis- 
tinguish endemic from imported species. Yet a very 
rare variety of the sapotaceae (Burckella) family, 
mentioned for the first time in 1892, has never been 
seen elsewhere. The copious amounts of fruit and 
nuts harvested from the wild and cultivated trees 
are an important and much-appreciated addition to 
the local diet. According to France's Institute of Sci- 
entific Research for Development through Co-oper- 
ation {ORSTOM), arboriculture may have been 
invented in Melanesia, an important region for the 
diversification of fruit-tree species. 
LAND DEGRADATION 
Degradation of the world’s agricultural land is 
increasing, reports the Food and Agriculture Orga 
nization of the United Nations (FAQ). Some 305 mil- 
lion hectares have already been destroyed by 
human activity, and in the next 20 years another 
140 million hectares (an area equivalent to almost 
half the surface of Western Europe) will lose much 
of their value as farmland. Degradation is most wide- 
spread in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The situa- 
tion is particularly serious in Africa, where only a 
quarter of cropland was used in 1990, because 
farmers lack the means to replace lost soil- 
enrichening substances with fertilizers. Soil is a rare 
and non-renewable resource, and a mere 11 per cent 
of the earth's land surface can be used unrestrict- 
edly for farming,

COLOURFUL RICE 
The colours of plants, a phenomenon linked to their 
genetic diversity, is determined by the wave-length 
of the sun’s rays that they absorb during photo- 
synthesis. In the last ten years a Chinese agrono- 
mist from Zhejiang, Li Minzheng, has developed 
some 120 varieties of coloured rice, ranging from 
black and green to red, yellow and purple. Flowers 
are a striking example of the coloration process, but 
it also applies to plants such as cotton, of which, 
oddly enough, only the white variety is cultivated, 
The production of coloured cotton would reduce 
dependence on chemical pigments, a major source 
of water pollution, 
ANCIENT CAVE-DWELLERS 
American and Romanian researchers have discovered 
33 hitherto unknown animal species in the pitch dark- 
ness that has reigned for 5.5 million years at the 
bottom of the Movile cave on the shores of the 
Black Sea. The finds include spiders, a centipede, ter- 
restrial isopods, a leech and an unusual little insect 
called a water scorpion. Biologist Thomas Kane sur- 
mises that these creatures lived in a tropical climate 
and that they fled to the cave during a big climatic 
upheaval. Deprived of sun, thus of photosynthesis, 
like the animals living at the bottom of the sea, these 
small sightless organisms detive their energy from 
the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the 
water. According to the team’s microbiologist, Brian 
Kinkle, no other cave in the world contains so many 
interdependent species. Moreover the similarity of 
conditions enables researchers to carry out experi- 
ments that would be impossible or toc costly in the 
ocean depths. 
FOR THE LOVE OF PEAT 
Peat bogs are the result of a long process that 
began with the retreat of the glaciers some 12,000 
years ago. They form in temperate humid climates 
by an accumulation and partial decomposition of 
vegetable remains under conditions of poor 
drainage. Immersion excludes air and prevents com- 
plete decay. The peat layer may be several metres 
thick in places. When drained, shallow peat bogs 
can become very fertile soil, and thick layers of peat 
provide fuel. But to destroy peat bogs is to plunder 
a heritage that has taken thousands of years to 
form and is valuable because it sustains unique

plant- and animal-life and is cur main source of infor- 
mation on the flora and climatic conditions of the 
Quaternary era. Bogs in Denmark and Germany have 
even delivered up 700 excellently preserved bodies 
of our Bronze- and Iron-Age ancestors. 
LONG LIVE THE COELACANTH 
When requested by the Fondation Nicolas Hulot in 
France and Germany's Max Planck Institute, biclo- 
gists Hans Fricke and Raphael Plante travelled in 
November 1995 to the Comoro Islands in the Indian 
Ocean to assess the status of the last surviving 
coelacanths (Latimeria chalumnae). A living fossil 
that was thought to have disappeared at the end of 
the Cretaceous period, this deep-sea fish was dis- 
covered alive and well in 1938. Today only some 150 
are left. A number of international organizations 
have joined forces to try to prevent the extinction 
of this fish that cannot be kept in captivity. 
KEEPING TABS ON TUNA 
Researchers at France's Institute of Scientific 
Research for Development through Co-operation 
(ORSTOM) are following the movements of tuna 
fish via tiny emitters fitted with temperature and 
depth sensors attached to the fishes’ backs. They 
have discovered that the tuna, a migratory fish, has 
a strong sense of direction, but do not yet know 
how the fish can find its way so accurately in an 
environment which seems to be so lacking in “land- 
marks”. When computerized, data on the tuna’s 
movements could not only lead fishermen to fish- 
abundant waters but also regulate access to them 
so as to prevent overfishing. Another bad- 
news/good-news story for fish.

I 
A mere $13 dollars is all it takes 
to protect a child from the six 
most deadly diseases (diph- 
theria, measles, whooping cough, 
poliomyelitis, tetanus and tuber- 
culosis). It costs $150 to equip a 
well that provides a family with 
drinking water. To provide a pri- 
mary school with a year’s sup- 
plies costs $957. Amazingly 
small sums can help to solve most 
of the health, nutrition and edu- 
cational problems faced by the 
world’s children. 
Measles alone kills a million 
children each year. In the devel- 
oping countrics enc child out of 
three goes hungry. Almost 10 
per cent of the world’s children 
die before turning five. The toll 
of wars and conflicts adds to this 
erim litany: one and a half mil- 
lion children killed in the last 
decade, four million maimed 
and twelve million left homeless. 
Yet the world has the tech- 
nological and financial resources 
to palliate much of this suf- 
fering, if not eradicate it 
entirely. Many developing coun- 
tries have succeeded in 
reducing the malnutrition rate 
to 10 per cent of the child pop- 
ulation: 17 countries have taken 
nationwide steps to eliminate 
vitamin A deficiency, which 
leads to blindness; 20 countries 
iodize more than 75 per cent of 
their salt. Since the United 
Nations World Summit for Chil- 
dren held in New York in Scp- 
tember 1990, 158 countries 
liave officially committed them- 
selves to attaining the goals set 
on that occasion for the year 
2000.

The Convention is the first

Signatory countries agree to halt 
child slavery, protect children 
from sexual abusc and give them

D AIDS | 
Fifteen million human beings 
are now II1V-positive. One and a 
half million of them are chil- 
dren. For babies the risk of Aids 
is linked to the presence of the 
IV virus in the mother. An 
adult can remain [1V-positive 
for more than ten years, but the 
length of time Dhefore the dis- 
ease rcaches its final stage is 
considerably less in a small 
organism that has not had time 
to develop its system of defence, 
Third World children are 
the worst affected: 80 per cent 
of infected children die before 
the age of five, but half of them 
do not reach age 2. The figures 
are much less dramatic in the 
industrialized conntries, where 
HIV-positive pregnant women 
receive follow-up medical care. 
The prospects for developing 
a vaccine are still remote. For 
the moment the struggle against 
Aids depends largely on cdn- 
cating for responsible sexual 
behaviour. Most countries that 
lave taken action via sex educa- 
tion through school programmes 
and the media (pop music, the- 
atre, radio and television), have 
made some headway. Where 
active promotion of condom use 
has been accompanied by an 
effective campaign against sex- 
ually transmitted diseases, the 
incidence of 1I1V has dropped 
by about 50 per cent.

& 
<& 
Nt 
Isabelle Leymarie talks to 
JOCELYNE BEROARD 
singer with the zouk group K A S S AV 7 
HM How did you get into music? 
Jocelyne Béroard: My parents loved 
music and had pretty eclectic tastes, like 
many people in the West Indies. My 
brothers and 1 listened to everything: 
opera, jazz, bossa nova, Myriam Makeba, 
Edith Piaf. . . . My mother played tangos 
and beguines on the piano. We listened to 
her religiously. But 1 partieularly liked 
the songs with words. 1 studied classical 
piano for seven years, but 1 was lazy; I 
would have liked to know low to play 
without having to work at it. My brothers 
studied the piano too, then one of them 
started in on the drums and another on 
the guitar. One of them composed and 
played beguines and jazz on the piano, 
and once in a while I would sing with iim 
for the fun of it. 
HM How did you get started? 
J. B.: The first time I sang in public was 
(Juite spontaneous, at the year-end fes- 
tivities at my high school. I sang a song 
I liked the tune of; in creole it was 
called Maman, la grév baré moin 
(“Mom, the strike blocked ny way™). It 
was a kind of protest song. Strikes 
weren't very popular at the time in Mar- 
tinique. I didn’t realize it then, but ny 
mother and teachers were very upset. 
Later I settled in Paris, and one of my 
brothers introduced me to the music 
scene. 1 worked with scveral groups 
before joining Kassav’. 
BM What kind of music did people 
listen to in the Antilles—the French- 
speaking West Indies—when you 
were a teenager? 
J. B.: Mini-jazs or the compas, styles 
that came {rom Ilaiti and were imitated 
by all the local groups; tumbele too, a 
48 
Zaire beat imported by the African band 
Rico Jazz. Other groups played calypso. 
There was even a group that did Otis 
Redding slows, imitating his voice with 
an awful American aecent! And of course 
older rhythms like the tango, the 
mazurka or the ereole waltz. But this 
kind of music is ne longer played at 
young people’s zouks (dances) nowadays. 
HM Where does the zouk come from? 
J. B.: In the Antilles you first had the 
traditional styles of African origin, born 
at the time of slavery—the belair and 
other drum rhythms, as well as musie 
played by slaves to imitate their nas- 
ters, like the quadrille. . . . 
HM What about city music like the 
Saint-Pierre beguine? 
J. B.: Far be it from me to put down the 
beguine—I love it—but that’s net all 
you hear nowadays. While other 
Caribbean and Latin American eountries 
were honing their own styles, music in 
the Antilles stagnated, simply copying 
salsa, ealypso, jazz, the Dominican heat 
and other foreign rhythms. Then Pierre- 
Edouard Déeimus, Georges Décimus 
and Jacob Desvarieux, the core of the 
Kassav’ group, started thinking about 
the weaknesses of Antillean music. The 
inspiration was there, hut the record- 
ings were poorly produced, poorly hal- 
anced and technically defective. What's 
more, nost of the mnusicians were self- 
taught, and talented though they were, 
they needed time to acquire certain 
skills. The Antilles still suffer from a 
lack of top-flight music schools and con- 
servatories. So Pierre-Edouard decided 
to form a really professional group with 
a typieally Antillean style that eorre- 
sponded to our temperament, and to 
concentrate particularly on making 
recordings and performing on stage. 
HM With its innovative arrangements 
based on traditional rhythms, zouk 
has managed to unify Guadeloupe and 
Martinique, musically speaking. ... 
J. B.: Yes, maybe because Kassav’ was 
created in Paris, where the Décimus 
brothers and Jacob Desvarieux, who all 
come from Guadeloupe, were living at 
the time. They wanted to play with the 
best Antillean session musicians and so 
they joined forees with musieians from 
Martinique. Kassav’ came out of that 
encounter. Some Martiniquans ask me 
occasionally why 1 use words from 
Guadcloupian creole, but that’s part of 
my personal contribution to the group. 
HM Does the use of creole make it 
more difficult for this music to get 
an international hearing? 
J. B.: No. A lot of people—including 
me—don’t understand everything 
Michael Jackson sings. But that doesn’t 
stop him from being a hit in non-English- 
speaking countries. Qur music is strong 
enough in itself to reach audiences of 
different nationalities. You just have to 
know how to listen. 
HM In which countries, apart from 
those of the Caribbean, is Kassav’ 
most successful? 
J. B.: In Africa. Throughout the French 
and Portuguese-speaking regions of 
Africa. Angolan music, for example, is 
close to the music of the Antilles, and at 
one time the musie of the Cape Verde 
Islands was mfluenced by zouk. Some 
Cape Verde mornas are reminiscent of

slow beguines. But even in New York, 
where we played at the Africa Fest, or 
in Japan and Russia, the audience gets 
swept up in the joie de vivre of our musie. 
In New York we had the Haitians 
jumping for joy. 
Bl Are the different islands in the 
Caribbean receptive to one another? 
J. B.: If you listen elosely, all their musie 
is similar. All you have to do is slow down 
some rhythms and you reeognize others. 
Jamaican ragga isn’t very {ar from zouk; 
nor is bossa nova. I don’t think it is pos- 
sible to invent a new rhythm these days. 
It’s beeome a matter of combining 
rhythms and making arrangements. 
Bm Are the words very important for 
your fans? 
J. B.! Yes, because people who like a 
song, like to sing it. When we perform in 
the Antilles, the andience sings along 
with us. The same thing happens in 
Africa; the people don’t speak creole, 
hut they learn the words phonetically. 
That’s why it’s important not to write 
just any old thing. 
BM How does the group get its ideas? 
J. B.: Everyone brings along their own eom- 
positions. Sometimes they are greeted 
enthusiastically, sometimes they're criti- 
 
eized pretty severely. We work as a group, 
though, even when we're doing arrange- 
ments. Everyone makes a contribution, 
and we talk it all through. 
BM Whereas calypso and other forms 
of Caribbean music have long 
reflected the rivalry between the 
sexes, your lyrics are more 
conciliatory. Do women in the 
Antilles today express their 
sensuality more freely than before? 
J. B.: Certainly. Even just a short time 
ago it was rare in traditional songs {or 
women to present themselves as “mata- 
dors”. All they did was ery over lost 
love. A woman who sang late at night at 
dances and hung out until all hours 
with musieians was looked down on. In 
the West Indies there are still men who 
don’t think much of women. But if I 
tease men in my songs and try to make 
them understand certain problems, it’s 
because I want to promote a better 
understanding between men and 
women. I always try to bring hope and 
not to dwell on the negative side of life, 
even in the greatest distress. Evenin a 
small way, it’s better to contribute to 
happiness and peace in the world, 
‘heartbreaking though it is to see how 
violence is spreading everywhere. 
Through music we can say what other 
people do not always dare to express— 


### 102620: Jocelyne Béroard singer with the zouk group Kassav

A leading Caribbean music group, Kassav’ 
invented zouk (from mazouk or mazurka, a 
creole word meaning a village dance), a musical 
genre that now has fans in many parts of the 
world. The group recently made a recording 
entitled Difé), featuring Stevie Wonder and Ray 
Barretto as guest artistes. Left, Jocelyne Beroard 
and the other members of the Kassav’ group. 
but we have no right to fan the flames 
of hatred. 
HM Do you agree with certain 
Antillean musicians who say that 
zouk today is too commercial? 
J. B.: Antillean musie is in an awkward 
position. Many “fake” groups—con- 
sisting of a single person playing and 
eomposing on a computer—have recently 
appeared on the seene, and the public 
has lieard a lot of mediocre stuff. When 
we began, Kassav’ disks flooded the 
market. The eraze. for our disks and 
zouk in general was incredible. When 
people saw that the formula was sue- 
cessful, everybody jumped on the band- 
wagon. Today the public is spoiled for 
choice, hut Kassav’ still leads the field 
for this kind of music. The {lame dies 
down if we go a leng time without 
recording, but it comes back to life as 
soon as we bring out a quality disc. A lot 
of instrumentalists and singers admit 
that they wait for a Kassav’ recording to 
come out and bring them inspiration. ll

### 102621: The Rarest, most precious vital force

    
The rarest, most precious vital force 
by Marie Curie 
 
This text by Marie Curie (1867-1934), who shared the Nobel Prize [or Physics in 1903 aud was sole winner 
of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, is the preamble to a memorandum on international scholarships for 
the advancement of science which she presented in Geneva in 1926 as a member of the Committee on 
Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations, 
I shall devote but few words to an affirmation of faith in 
the importance of seience for mankind. If at times this 
importance has been questioned and if the words “the 
failure of seience” have been pronounced in moments of 
bitter discouragement, it is because man’s endeavours to 
achieve his highest aspirations are never perfect, like 
all that is human, and beeause these endeavours have 
too often been diverted from their path by forces of ego- 
ecntric nationalism and social regression. 
Yet it is through the constant effort to expand sei- 
ence that man has risen to his present pre-eminent place 
on our planet and that he is also winning increasing 
power over nature and a larger measure of well-being. 
We should join with those who, like Rodin, pay homage 
to the devoted efforts of scholars and thinkers and with 
those who, like Pasteur, “believe indomitably that sei- 
ence and peace will triumph over ignorance and war”. 
If, to judge from the experience of the recent world 
conflict, the aspirations of the elites in different lands 
often appear less exalted than those of the great mass of 
less well educated persons, it is because of the perils 
inherent in all forms of intellectual and political power 
when these are not controlled and channeled toward the 
high ideals which alone justify their use. No enterprise 
can therefore have greater importance than those which 
seek to promote international ties between the dynamic 
thinkers in all countries and especially between the 
young in whose hands lies the future of mankind. 
I am sure that no one will deny that even in the most 
democratic of countries existing social systems offer a 
considerable advantage to the wealthy and that the 
roads to higher education, open so freely to children of 
families with ample means, are still difficult of access to 
children of families with limited resources. 
As a result every nation each ycar loses a large part of 
the rarest, most precious vital force. While waiting for 
reforms in education to resolve this problem once and 
for all, the democratic response in various countries has 
‘hitherto consisted of a partial remedy, the creation of 
national educational scholarships, thus enabling higher 
education to retrieve some of the young people of whom 
it would otherwise be deprived. 
These national efforts, highly commendable though 
still far from adequate, are not our concern here, but 1 
would like to point out that the same problem exists 
with regard to post-university studies for the young 
people who have managed to surmount all the obstacles 
encountered up to that point. 
At this post-university stage of their lives, young stu- 
dents who contemplate careers in science are brought face 
to face with pressing demands. In most eases the family 
has done its utmost to belp the young man or woman to 
come this far and, unable to make further sacrifices, it 
now asks them to become self supporting. And even in well- 
to-do families the wish to take up very advanced studies 
may encounter a lack of understanding, such studies being 
considered as an extravagance or a mere whim. 
Yet what in fact are the best interests of society in 
this matter? Should it not give every encouragement to 
those called to a scientific vocation? Is it really so well- 
endowed that it ean afford to reject the vocations it is 
offercd? 
I believe, on the basis of personal experience, that 
the sum total of the aptitudes called for by a true sci- 
entific vocation is an infinitely frail and precious thing, a 
rare treasure that it is both absurd and criminal to 
throw away, a gift to which great care must be devoted 
so that it may grow and fructify. 
What, in reality, are some of the qualities required 
of the person who aspires to success in the field of inde- 
pendent scientific research? The intellectual qualities 
are an intelligence capable of learning and under- 
standing; a sure judgment capable of appraising the sig- 
nificance of theoretical and experimental demonstra- 
tions, an imagination capable of creative effort. Equally 
important are the moral faculties: perseverance, zeal 
and above all the unselfish dedication that guides the 
novice along a path which, in most eases, will never lead 
him to material rewards comparable to those offered 
by careers in industry or business. 
Thus to foster and safeguard the scientific vocation is a 
sacred duty for each society which has the interests of its 
future at heart. It is gratifying to see that public opinion 
is becoming increasingly conscious of this duty. H
