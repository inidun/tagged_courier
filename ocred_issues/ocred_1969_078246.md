PORTRAIT FROM 
A NUBIAN TOMB 
This is the head of a man who lived 
and died in Nubia nearly 4,000 years 
ago. It is one of several funerary 
masks recovered from a necropolis 
near Mirgissa, in the Sudan, by a 
French archaeological mission 
which took part in the international 
campaign to save the monuments 
of Nubia. Following a Unesco 
appeal (launched in 1960), 40 
archaeological missions from 15 
countries explored sites in Egyptian 
Nubia for five years, while a dozen 
more worked in Sudanese Nubia.

A 21-YEAR 
ANTHOLOGY 
“Ignorance of each other's ways and 
lives,” reads the preamble of the 
Constitution of Unesco, “has been 
a common cause throughout the history 
of mankind of that suspicion and mis- 
trust between peoples of the world 
through which their differences have 
all too often broken into war.” For 
the past 21 years the “Unesco Cour- 
ier" has sought by text and image 
to combat this suspicion and mistrust 
between peoples by telling the un- 
headlined story of men and women 
of different lands who are working 
together to conquer ignorance and dis- 
ease, reduce racial prejudice, raise 
standards of living and foster better 
understanding of other peoples’ ways 
and lives: in a word, to serve as a 
window opening on the world of educ- 
ation, the sciences, the arts, and com- 
munication, and the problems concern- 
ing the nations of the globe in seeking 
to resolve them. 
The “Unesco Courier” began pub- 
lication in 1948 with three language 
editions in English, French and Spanish. 
It has steadily grown until today it is 
proud to boast a total of 12 language 
editions—all identical in content and 
presentation—with a readership ex- 
ceeding 2 million persons. A Russian 
edition was launched in Moscow in 
1957; a German edition in Berne and 
an Arabic edition in Cairo were launch- 
ed in 1960; a Japanese edition began 
publication in Tokyo in 1961; and an 
Italian edition in Rome in 1963; a Hindi 
edition in New Delhi In 1967 and a 
Tamil edition in Madras the same year; 
and a Hebrew edition in Jerusalem in 
1968. A Persian edition produced in 
Teheran has been launched in 1969. 
This special issue brings together a 
necessarily small selection of the many 
articles and features that have appear- 
ed in the past two decades. It is in 
no sense a history of Unesco. All 
articles have been shortened, some- 
times drastically, and many articles 
have had to be omitted though they 
certainly deserve a place in this 
anthology.

### 58438: Earthlings in the space age

B. his own ingenuity, Homo 
sapiens, the Earthling, has shrunk his 
world to the dimensions of a very 
small planet. In the arrogance of our 
conceit, which puts Man and his brain 
at the very centre of the universe, we 
have never been quite convinced by 
the astronomers when they have tried 
to tell us how insignificant the world 
is in the immensities of Space. But 
now the space engineers, and the 
astronauts, beating the bounds of our 
global parish, have reminded us how 
relatively small it is. 
In the spirit of new adventure, one 
may regard the world as a departure 
platform for fugitives to the moon or a 
launching pad for escapades to other 
planets or even beyond our solar sys- 
tem, into other universes. But the 
Earthlings who cannot so escape must 
recognize that on its relatively limited 
surface, 3,000 million - people today, 
4,000 million in twenty years’ time, and 
6,000 million or 7,000 million forty years 
from now, will have to contrive to live 
and to work together. Or, by the ne- 
glect of wisdom or the abuse of human 
ingenuity, to die together. 
An eye, human or electronic, in an 
artificial satellite in orbit, sees no poli- 
tical frontiers; no ideological curtains; 
and no differentiation of races. It 
might see H-Bombs going off as the 
signals of tensions; but in general it 
would see a globe of which only three- 
tenths was land and seven-tenths 
covered by oceans; mountain ranges 
reduced to wrinkles; evidence of sur- 
viving forests; tawny expanses of hot 
deserts which cover a fifth of its sur- 
face and cold deserts which cover an- 
LORD RITCHIE-CALDER 1s a world famous 
science writer. He won the Unesco Kalinga 
Prize for the popularization of science in 1961. 
other fifth. It might with difficulty dis- 
tinguish the pattern of cultivation of 
arable or cropped lands, which 
accounts for only one-tenth of the 
land surface. That is the nature of 
humanity's family estate of which, at 
the moment, we are the improvident 
stewards. 
The world is not just the relic of a 
cosmic incident. [t provides the bio- 
sphere, the living space, for the evolu- 
tionary process which, we like to think, 
had its consummation in Man. 
But with a wisdom which we have 
not demonstrated convincingly so far, 
we must recognize that that biosphere 
and that evolutionary process include 
other species with which we can co- 
exist or which we can stupidly destroy. 
Stupidly because our relations with 
these other species are a condition of 
our own survival. 
A lump of soil no bigger than a 
football contains a micro-organic popu- 
lation greater than the human popula- 
tion of the world. That micro-organic 
population includes the germs and 
fungi which evocatively suggest dis- 
ease or danger but which, in other 
forms, are indispensable to our exis- 
tence. In the same way, we think of 
insects as deserving insecticide and 
other creatures as deserving pesticide, 
but in the process we can kill those 
which are essential to our ultimate 
needs. 
In order to get margarine, we cleared 
big areas in Africa of brush and tsetse 
flies which it harboured, but in the 
process we got rid of the bees which 
were needed to pollinate other crops. 
Similarly, for our short-term, and 
short-sighted, needs we have des- 
troyed the vegetation cover, prevent- 
ing the absorption of water by the 
natural sponge through which it seeps 
into the underground springs. As a 
result the scouring rains sluice the 
soil off the hills, cause floods and 
eventual erosion, 
In the lifetime of the United States, 
over two hundred and eighty million 
acres of arable crop and range land 
have been destroyed—more than ten 
times the productive acreage of the 
United Kingdom. 
Only slowly—and recently—have we 
come to recognize that wild animals 
are not something with which mankind 
is at war but a part of the balance of 
life, which is delicately adjusted. 
For the first time in history, man has 
the power of veto over the evolution 
of his species. We share the bio- 
sphere. Into tkat we have injected, in 
the past sixteen years, man-made 
radioactivity. Elements which did not 
exist in nature have been indiscrim- 
inately scattered over the face of the 
earth, to combine in all living things. 
Today there is not a child in the 
world that does not have radiostron- 
tium in its bones—at least to some 
degree. The amounts may be insigni- 
ficant and the possible effects may be 
emotionally exaggerated and medically 
in dispute. Much is unproven, much 
is unknown. But that only emphasizes 
that men, on defective evidence or in 
positive ignorance, are recklessly tam- 
pering with the biosphere on which 
their present and future depends. 
| have, in the past fourteen years, 
been among the wandering Bedouins 
in the desert, the Dyaks of Equatorial 
Borneo, the Eskimos in the Arctic, the 
peoples of the hinterlands of Latin 
America and Africa and Asia. In one 
way or another their lives and their 
destinies have been consciously 
touched by scientific and techno- 
logical achievement. 
Many of them have acquired their 
freedom—in 1962 there are nearly 
twice as many nations in the U.N. as 
there were when it was founded. But 
when the intoxicating effects of politi- 
cal independence wear off, there is 
the morning-after-the-night-before. 
People are apt to wake up and dis- 
cover that freedom has been robbed 
of its meaning; that they are just as 
hungry, or more hungry; just as poor, 
or more impoverished; just as sick or 
more disease-ridden, and just as frus- 
trated in their seeking for a better 
way of life. 
T rouen the limited—fin- 
ancially that is—activities of the U.N. 
agencies, of the U.N. expanded techni- 
cal assistance fund and now of the 
special fund and by the much more 
lavish examples of bilateral aid, people 
have been shown what is scientifically 
and technically possible. But it is not 
enough to show them. 
To demonstrate what might be done 
to people who have not the means to 
do it is just tantalizing. It is just 
“window-shopping™—walking along 
with nothing in your pocket and with 
plateglass between you and the things 
you have been taught to want. 
The peoples of the emerging coun- 
tries have not the means to go shopp- 
ing in the supermarket of science—as 
Prof. P.M.S. Blackett has termed ‘it. 
They cannot even afford the bargain 
basement. 
The object of this kind of assistance 
is to help people to help themselves— 
throwing them a rope with which to 
haul themselves out of the morass of 
poverty. But this is no [Indian rope- 
trick—the rope has to be tethered to 
something, and a winch would help to 
haul them out more quickly. As it is, 
the rope is slipping. 
After ten years of this new social 
philosophy by which governments 
acknowledged that they were respon- 
sible, not only for their own people, 
but for other, less fortunate peoples as 
well, the gap between the prosperity 
of the highly-advanced countries and 
the poverty of the countries struggling 
for development has not closed—it has

widened. The rich countries are richer 
and the poor countries are poorer— 
despite the thousands of millions 
which have been spent on aid. 
Governments, when the markets 
skid, cannot “lift themselves by their 
own bootstraps” or, if they do, it is 
by duress. In the meantime their 
peoples will endure the Misery-Go- 
Round of Poverty. 
By 1960 the total world stocks of 
surplus grain had reached the in- 
credible figure of 125,000,000 tons— 
enough to provide the full calorie 
needs of 450,000,000 people for a com- 
plete year. 
N O one should be so foolish 
as to think that the distribution of those 
vast surpluses, even if it were possible, 
would solve the problem of hunger. 
Relieving immediate stresses, yes. By 
distribution through such agencies as 
Unicef, yes. By turning food into 
currency, yes. Supplies of food can 
be made available to governments to 
help present needs and the proceeds 
can be used by a government to help 
its own agriculture to increase its 
yields in future years. That is the only 
permanent solution—to enable coun- 
tries and regions to produce their food 
requirements. 
It can be done. We do not need to 
imagine food artificially produced by 
photosynthesis. The scientific know- 
how already exists. The knowledge 
we have got, applied with wisdom, can 
increase the yields from existing 
acreages. By plant-breeding we can 
extend the food-growing acreages into 
what seemed inhospitable regions. 
The Unesco Arid Zone Programme 
has done remarkable work in showing 
how deserts might be developed. | 
have no doubt, having been in the 
Arctic seeing whether it might become 
part of our habitable world, that pro- 
duction, if need be, can be extended 
there. 
As far as those oceans which cover 
seven-tenths of our globe are concern- 
ed, we are at the cave-man stage. 
At sea we hunt our food and do not 
husband it. Sea-farming and sea- 
ranching are perfectly feasible. 
The great international survey of the 
Indian Ocean, sponsored by Unesco, 
in which 25 survey ships of 15 nations 
took part, not only told us a great deal 
about that birthplace of the monsoons 
but also about its biological possibi- 
lities and its food prospects. 
In 1961, the United Nations held in 
Rome a conference on “New Sources 
of Energy’. Ironically, atomic energy 
was never mentioned. The new 
sources were the oldest of all—sun, 
wind and geothermal energy, the heat 
in the crust of the earth. It was a 
“Do-it-yourself” conference—telling 
the developing countries how they 
might contrive, improvise, and adapt 
methods of harnessing the sun and the 
winds to their domestic and industrial 
needs. 
For the first tme in history, Man, 
the Earthling, has the power of veto 
over continuing evolution. He can 
exercise that veto by the nuclear des- 
truction of the race, or, by default in 
handling the problems of starvation, 
prove that Malthus was right. 
He can ambitiously reach out to the 
farther planets, but his species as such 
must survive on the surface of the 
earth, subsist from the nine inches of 
top-soil which feeds, clothes and 
shelters him or from the seas from 
which he emerged hundreds of millions 
of years ago. 
All the majesty of his mind can be 
dethroned by his stomach. Man can 
feast like Belshazzar and ignore the 
writing on the wall. He can spend 
£40,000 million a year on the defence 
of peace and ignore the real content 
of the peace he is supposed to be 
defending. 
He can split the atom and release 
the power of matter and use this, his 
greatest discovery, to poison the good- 
ness of his earth and destroy his 
species. He can outboast the An- 
cients, who in the arrogance of their 
material success built pyramids as the 
gravestones of their civilizations, for 
Modern Man can throw his pyramids 
into Space and they may orbit etern- 
ally around a planet which died of his 
neglect. 
Or he may choose to use his science 
and his wisdom to co-operate with all 
his kind in the peaceful enrichment of 
his Earth and of the people who live 
on it.

### 58440: The Story of Antonio Arango

THE STORY 
A traveller approaching the 
Colombian port of Barranquilla on the 
Caribbean Sea sees Colombian soil 
long before he sights the coast. 
The tropical blue of the sea changes 
to yellow as far as the eye can reach. 
What gives it its yellow colour? 
The port of Barranquilla lies on the 
estuary of the River Magdalena, which 
rises in the interior of Colombia and 
flows for a thousand miles to empty 
into the Caribbean Sea. The yellow 
colour is soil swept away by the Mag- 
dalena River within a radius of several 
miles round the port of Barranquilla. 
The soil comes from the Magdalena 
Valley and from the slopes of the 
Andes enclosing the valley to the east 
and west. It has been washed away 
by rain and borne down brooks, tribu- 
taries and secondary rivers. 
Part of it has been stripped by the 
River Magdalena from its own banks. 
Every day, every hour, even every 
minute, the wealth of a nation is cast 
into the sea. 
Antonio Arango, whom | knew in the 
Andean Cordillera, was himself an 
actor in the tragedy of the vanishing 
soil, without understanding it. 
Antonio Arango invested his life- 
savings in the purchase of a 20-hectare

### 58440: The Story of Antonio Arango

OF ANTONIO ARANGO 
parcel of land in the Cordillera. The 
land was rich and fertile and covered 
with "tall timber”. "Where such big 
trees grow”, said Antonio to himself, 
"the soil is good”, and he gazed with 
satisfaction at the thick stratum of top- 
soil which could be seen in the cutting 
made by the brook. The water was 
crystal-clear as it flowed through the 
undergrowth of moss and parasitic 
plants; so crystalline that Antonio and 
his sons christened it “Diamond 
Brook”. The site was ideal for a house 
and allowed a view over the whole 
landscape. 
Antonio Arango sharpened his axe 
and machette. His wife and three sons 
aiding him, he began felling the tall 
trees. The timber could not be used 
because there were no roads to trans- 
port it nor neighbouring towns to buy 
it. So Antonio Arango let a few days 
go by to let the sun dry the fallen 
trunks and then set fire to them. 
Other settlers were doing the same 
in other parts of the mountain. 
The blaze was enormous, and the 
beasts and birds of the forest fled 
before the flames as the fallen giants 
crackled in the fire. 
At last the ground was cleared and 
Antonio Arango sowed it with maize. 
On two hectares he sowed forage for 
the cow, and built a house on the high 
ground. As his wife had worked so 
hard, Antonio gave his ranch her name, 
La Isabella. The first harvest was a 
big success. The maize was tall and 
thick. Antonio was pleased with his 
efforts. So he went on sowing maize. 
But things began to change. 
Diamond Brook, which had once 
been crystal-clear throughout the year, 
had shrunk to a thread of water in 
summer. In the rainy season it was a 
yellow flood tearing loose rocks and 
mud and lumps of soil. The harvests 
grew smaller, and Antonio Arango had 
to sell the cow because the pasture 
land could no longer feed the animal. 
Things were not going right at all. 
One day, when he was sowing maize, 
his mattock struck solid rock. The 
vegetable top-soil had become so thin 
that rocky outcrops were appearing 
everywhere. Antonio had no money, 
the children had nothing to eat, and 
finally Diamond Brook vanished and 
only its stony channel was left. Like 
so many other settlers, Antonio Arango 
left to find another stretch of woodland 
to start all over again. 
This tragedy of Antonio Arango is 
attaining national, continental and 
world-wide proportions. Every year 
Colombia loses the equivalent of 
10,000 ranches of 20 hectares by soil 
erosion. That means that every year 
there are 10,000 families in the same 
position as the Arangos. 
Vegetation is like an umbrella pro- 
by Guillermo Nannetti 
tecting the soil. It breaks the fall of 
the water and causes it to sink into 
the subsoil. The forest is the mother 
. of the spring. The roots of the trees 
are like friendly hands sustaining the 
topsoil with their myriad fingers. Fallen 
leaves and fruits fertilize the soil and 
build up the vegetable humus. The 
trees afford protection from the wind, 
regulate humidity and give shelter from 
heat and cold. They prevent floods. 
They purify the air. They can be an 
inexhaustible source of profit to one 
who knows how to cultivate and utilize 
them wisely. 
If only someone had told Antonio 
Arango to drive his furrows according 
to the contour of the slope. To terrace 
the steepest part of the slope. To heal 
the scars of erosion with simple dams 
of logs and stones. 
If only someone had told Antonio 
Arango that maize is not the right crop 
for sloping ground and that other, 
better paying crops can be rotated 
instead. If only someone had taught 
him to sow the ground between his 
furrows with suitable bushes to check 
the movement of the soil. 
And if only all the Antonio Arangos, 
all the N'boyas, Changs, Abdullas and 
Smiths all over the world knew some- 
thing about the conservation of na- 
ture, what a different world it would be.

As far back as the un- 
known origin of mankind, the path of 
human activity has been marked by 
the thoughtless destruction of forest 
and vegetation. Civilizations have 
flourished and disappeared with a re- 
sultant depletion of trees and plants, 
leaving only steppe and desert behind. 
Only in recent centuries has man 
begun to realize that he was cutting 
off the branch that he was sitting on. 
Man is becoming more aware today 
of nature's vengeance and, at the same 
time, of the challenge which confronts 
him in preserving his dwindling natural 
assets while endeavouring to extend 
the fertile earth which is the very basis 
of his existence. The demands of an

European Forestry Commission. 
The forest, our largest and most 
durable soil cover, was once regarded 
as only an obstacle to settlement, agri- 
culture and communications. It was 
recklessly burned or exploited until it 
suddenly became a focus of intense 
human interest. 
Man has come to learn that the two 
most important elements of his exis- 
tence—soil and water—owe their stabi- 
lity and availability to the presence of 
sufficient forest cover. 
Three-quarters of the world's popu- 
lation are undernourished. There is 
only about one acre of land per head 
for food production and no less than 
twice this area is needed to ensure 
satisfactory nutrition. The true Enemy 
No. 1 in the world is not a political or 
military opponent, but the deterioration 
of the soil, the dryness, the irresistible 
progress of semi-deserts and deserts. 
In some countries, like the United 
States and the Union of Soviet Social- 
ist Republics, soil conservation has 
become almost a "State religion™. In 
South America, all over Africa, Asia 
While political leaders come and go, 
"this destructive process of soil deter- 
ioration remains a permanent menace. 
Each government inherits this problem 
from its predecessor. Yet, even to- 
day, the efforts of many countries to 
remedy the situation are merely in 
their infancy. 
We know from the experience of 
500 years that the Sahara desert pro- 
gresses towards the south at the rate 
of over three feet a year on a wide 
front of 2,000 miles. Lake Chad, 
which some decades ago was still an 
ideal refuge for migrating birds from 
Europe, is steadily diminishing in sur- 
face area and depth and its shores 
are turning from fertile green to steppe 
brown. All far-reaching plans for the 
development of Africa as the “Conti- 
nent of the Future”, all plans for water 
use and industrialization will fail unless 
the necessary attention is paid to the 
importance of trees and forests.

### 58445: Saving our vanishing forests

VANISHING FORESTS (Continued) 
tor. The one in the south reaches 
from Australia to South Africa and 
South America. The one in the nor- 
thern hemisphere spreads north from 
China, all across Asia, North America 
and Mexico. 
The northern belt includes those na- 
tions which, as we learned in our 
history classes at school, were once 
rulers of the world. We were puzzled 
to hear in geography class that large 
areas of these once powerful nations 
are now sterile, The truth is, of 
course, that in ancient times they 
were not so. 
Ctesiphon and Baghdad, once cen- 
tres of concentrated power, were des- 
cribed by Herodotus more than two 
thousand years ago: "Of all the coun- 
tries we know this is the most suitable 
for growing grain. It is so well fav- 
oured that it yields two hundredfold 
and, where conditions are best, even 
three hundredfold. The ears of wheat 
and barley grow to the width of four 
fingers. But to the height of what tree 
millet and barley grow | shall not dis- 
close. No one who has not seen 
Babylon would believe me.” 
For Herodotus, Babylon was the 
essence of fertility. He also accorded 
the same honour to Cinyps, a region in 
North Africa: “This country produces 
grain equal to the best | have seen, 
for it has black soil and springs water 
it. The yield is equal to that of Baby- 
lon, three hundredfold under the best 
conditions." 
Soldiers in the sandy and torrid 
conditions of this region (part of mod- 
ern Cyrenaica) during the last war 
would have had difficulty in imagining 
that a now desolate desert was the 
richest of farming land two millennia 
ago. 
There are three zones on 
the globe which successively were 
homes of dominating civilizations but 
where the soil became devastated in 
proportion to the ageoftheir settlement. 
The first zone is the desert of North 
Africa. In the Sahara, hundreds of 
archaelogical finds and cave paintings 
indicate that this was once a flour- 
ishing country of many lakes and 
rivers. One cave painting shows men 
swimming. Imagine swimmers in the 
Sahara desert today! 
A second zone is the continuous 
range of stone, salt and sand deserts 
which spread from west China, across 
Turkestan, Afghanistan, Iran, lraq, Jor- 
dan, Sinai and up to North Africa. In 
ancient times these latitudes were 
inhabited by Sumerians, Babylonians, 
Persians, Macedonians, and Phoeni- 
cians—names which are all connected 
with world power and wealth. The 
third zone covers Palestine, Syria, Asia 
Minor, Greece, Italy and Spain. 
This epidemic of devastated soil 
seems to be a contagious one. 
Attempts at reafforestation in Spain, 
italy and Greece would certainly have 
been more successful had the opposite 
shores of the Mediterranean still been 
covered with a wide belt of fertile land 
as once they were. But the terrible 
desert has already reached the shore 
of the Mediterranean on a wide front 
and sends out its drying winds to the 
European countries. 
The ever-blue sky of Italy has not 
always been as blue. Some 2,000 
years ago it was just as grey and 
cloudy as in northern parts of Europe 
and the complaints of the old Romans 
about frost and snow-fall—which seem 
so strange to those who know Italy 
today—were probably justified. 
While once it took millennia, or at 
least centuries to deplete fertile land, 
modern history offers a striking exam- 
ple of how man can start and complete 
this disastrous chain-reaction in only a 
few decades. Hardly a century ago 
the U.S. farmer moved into the Middle 
West, full of initiative and energy. 
At first, the existing forests seemed 
inexhaustible. They were cut down, 
houses and bridges were built, the 
wood was burned in locomotives, on 
ships and in stoves. Great quantities 
were felled and burned on the spot to 
make large areas of ash-fertilized farm- 
ing land. Later, monocultures and 
tractors cleared away those clumps of 
trees and hedges which had survived. 
Water ran off the land too rapidly, 
soil was eroded, floods occurred and 
drought appeared between rainy peri- 
ods. This process was accelerated 
during the First World War when large 
areas of what remained of tree-covered 
prairie were ploughed up for more in- 
tensive wheat production. 
After the war, part of this land was 
left idle, but there was no longer any 
deep-rooting grass or other soil cover 
to conserve the moisture and stabilize 
the soil. Storms swept the land from 
the Gulf of Mexico and Canada un- 
checked, for there were no forests to 
break their force. The wind carried 
away the fertile topsoil leaving only 
sterile layers and rocks. 
The same thing happened to former 
forest areas. Without the protection 
of the trees, without the firm grip of 
their roots, without humus, the soil was 
carried away. In the south, where the 
frost which usually stabilizes the sail 
during winter seldom occurs, and 
where there is seldom snow cover to 
prevent the damage, soil and wind 
erosion had the same harmful effect. 
Like a network of veins the first 
small gullies appeared in the sail, 
gradually deepening to real gorges. 
The process was repeated a million 
times all over the country until only 
naked rock was left in some regions. 
Even today American rivers carry 
away so much fertile soil that an old 
indian once said: “Qur country is a 
new Atlantis; one day it will disappear 
in the Ocean!” 
Erosion is only the first phase of a 
serious chain reaction which starts 
with the regression or disappearance 
of forests. Sediment deposited in 
reservoirs, water-courses, fields and 
cities is an important part of the total 
damage. This damage seldom comes to 
public attention because it is often invi- 
sible. Sediment increases the total 
volume and weight of flow in water- 
courses thus raising the height of flood 
peaks and their destructive power. In 
drainage basins and reservoirs, sedi- 
ment can reduce water capacity in a 
short time. 
NVESTIGATIONS made 
into the effect of silting on the capacity 
of dams in Algeria show several dams 
lost 100 per cent of their original capac- 
ity in a period of 74 to 96 years. Simil- 
ar findings in the United States with 
respect to annual storage depletion in 
numerous dams indicate that from 0.09 
to 31.53 per cent of original storage 
capacity is lost as a result of silting. 
Recently a monograph on the Arno 
river basin, on which Florence is lo- 
cated, revealed that 2,670,000 tons of 
solid material are carried away an- 
nually by the water flow, thus causing 
an average lowering of land surface 
of almost one inch a year. - 
Silting is almost always associated 
with deforestation. Dams fed from 
completely wooded watersheds practi- 
cally never silt up. Experiments carried 
out by the Tennessee Valley Authority 
in 1955 showed that after reafforesta- 
tion and protection works had been 
completed, the volume of sediment 
carried down by the river was reduced 
by 90 per cent. 
The forest also plays an important 
part in protecting the soil against wind 
erosion and sand encroachment. Dune 
stabilization by tree planting is a well- 
kndvn practice in many parts of the 
world. It is true that almost any vege- 
tation cover will stabilize loose soil and 
prevent it from being eroded by wind 
and rain, but forests are probably more 
effective because of their height, den- 
sity, deep-reaching roots and perma- 
nency. There are indications that the 
presence of forests may increase local 
rainfall, though effects on a regional or 
continental scale have not been de- 
monstrated. 
The denser the forest, the greater 
will be its power to reduce wind velo- 
city. One authority has proved this 
protective effect and noted reductions 
in velocity of over 85 per cent. In 
Kaly, tests have shown that the Cecina 
forest reduced wind velocity by 56 per 
cent and a hardwood coppice in the 
same region was responsible for re- 
ductions of 89 per cent. 
The importance of such protection 
against wind erosion can hardly be 
exaggerated. In dry periods and on 
bare land the particles of certain types 
of soil become so severed from each 
other that a strong wind can easily 
carry them away. The finer particles 
form clouds and the coarser particles, 
whipped by the wind, roll and bounce

over the surface of the soil. Their 
movement is halted whenever the wind 
slackens and they bank up in pits, 
ditches, canals and sunken roads, or 
in the neighbourhood of sheltering 
objects where they may suffocate 
crops. 
This is only one of the perils of 
strong winds. Drying out of soil, di- 
rect damage to delicate products like 
fruit, and the distortion and stunting 
of exposed trees can all be traced to 
this cause. 
It is a striking fact that a number 
of countries have never formulated a 
forest policy or passed a forest law, 
in spite of evident symptoms of soil 
deterioration and in spite of repeated 
warnings about the results of a further 
decline. 
One of them comes from Professor 
Flatscher, scientist of the Academy for 
Soil Cultivation in Vienna. He has 
estimated that the world’s forests pro- 
duce about 1,600 million cubic metres 
of timber a year whereas the volume 
cut annually amounts to between 2,200 
and 2,600 million cubic metres. This 
indicates that the annual fellings are 
about 50 per cent above the allowable 
cut. 
Any private individual who sanc- 
tioned such improvidence would be 
held responsible for bad management 
and would certainly be heavily penal- 
ized. But mankind as a whole, it 
seems, can indulge in prodigal waste 
of this kind without being in conflict 
with any law. 
The total forested area of the world 
is estimated to be about 10,000 million 
acres and these forests should be cap- 
able of providing reasonably adequate 
supplies for a population larger than 
now exists. But the provision of such 
supplies will entail the treatment of all 
productive forests as renewable crops, 
the opening up of forests which are 
not yet accessible and the cessation of 
the widespread devastation of forests 
which still continues. 
Of the 4,000 million acres of the 
earth's original forest area which man 
has destroyed, 1,000 million might 
well be replanted especially since 
much of this land is to be found in 
places where the population is in 
greatest need of the products of the 
forest. 
The cost per day of the second 
world war was a little over $500 million. 
The cost of one day of this war would 
reafforest at least 20 million acres, 
and the cost of 50 days would be suffi- 
cient to reclothe the entire 1,000 million 
devastated acres with proper tree 
cover. 
Of course, no one is so naive as to 
believe we are on the verge of any 
such undertaking. But we are in pos- 
session of scientific knowledge, indus- 
trial skill and technical equipment 
which could be used to spread the 
potential benefits of the forest to the 
uttermost ends of the inhabited earth.

### 58447: The Menace of extinct volcanoes

THE MENACE 
OF ‘EXTINCT’ 
VOLCANOES 
| have gradually become convinced of something that laymen and even professional 
geologists and volcanologists usually ignore and it fills me with dread—the prospect, 
some day soon, of unheard-of volcanic catastrophes. Geological evidence has finally 
convinced me that humanily has so far been fantastically lucky, and the catastrophes 
of Pompeii and St. Pierre de la Martinique are nothing to what awaits us. These were 
small towns compared with the enormous modern cities threatened at closer or longer 
range by a volcanic outburst—Naples and Rome, Portland and Seattle, Mexico City, 
Bandung, Sapporo, Oakland, Catania, Clermont-Ferrand...| Volcanoes regarded as totally 
extinct near these cities are dead only to eyes that cannot or will not see. A volcano 
may be less than a century dormant and people almost cease altogether to think of it 
as such. But volcanoes are geologically live; time for them is counted not in years or 
even in centuries, but in millennia and tens of millennia. 
Centuries, hundreds of centuries might pass and Clermont-Ferrand, Rome or Seattle 
not be wiped out. But the interval might be much less...

### 58450: The Salerno science school of the ninth century

10 
THE SALERNO SCIENCE SCHOOL 
OF THE NINTH CENTURY 
by Riccardo Luzzato 
We the provinces of the 
Western Roman Empire were invaded 
by primitive warrior tribes in the fifth 
century, the great wealth of scientific 
knowledge created and accumulated by 
the Romans, Greeks and the older 
eastern civilizations seemed irretriev- 
ably lost to Europe. Yet, during the 
troubled centuries of the early Middle 
Ages there was established an interna- 
tional scientific organization which was 
to flourish for more than 500 years in 
the face of all the violent prejudice 
then prevailing in the Christian world. 
During the ninth century, in the 
seaside town of Salerno, in southern 
Italy, a school was founded which was 
to renew and preserve medical know- 
ledge for the world and provide an 
example of the practicality and impor- 
tance of intercultural co-operation. 
Records are incomplete about the 
early days of the Civitas Hippocratica, 
as the school was called in honour of 
the greatest physician of Ancient 
Greece. Modern historians generally 
agree however, in ascribing its founda- 
tions to four scholars: Master Adela, 
an Arab, Master Helinus, a Jew, Master 
Pontus, a Greek and Master Salernus, 
an Italian. Each taught in his language, 
which meant Latin for Salernus and 
Hebrew for Helinus. 
The international character of the 
institution is illustrated by the fact that 
the nationality of many of its famous 
teachers was hardly known. At the 
Civitas Hippocratica, they were just 
teachers, and the thousands of stu- 
dents who came from Arabia, Africa, 
Spain, Britain, Palestine, northern 
France and other countries knew and 
cared little about the origins of their 
professors. This applies to Gabrio- 
pontus who died about 1050. Some 
historians think he was a Greek, others 
that he was a Lombard, others again 
that he was a Salernitan. 
One of his best known successors, 
Constantinus Africanus, was born in 
Carthage and made long journeys to 
Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia and India, to 
bring the latest achievements of Eas- 
tern science to Salerno. 
The passion for science at Salerno 
was strong enough to overcome more 
than one form of prejudice. A pro- 
minent figure of the early period was 
the woman physician Trotula, about 
whose personality little is known, 
although she left a number of medical 
treatises which were used as textbooks 
up to the sixteenth century and were 
first printed by Aldus in Venice in 1547. 
Other women too were admitted to the 
lectures and to study. 
Doctor Trotula acquired such wide 
fame, that she became popular in old 
English literature under the name of 
“Dame Trot" and became Madame 
Trotte in the 13th century medical trou- 
vére Rutebceuf (Le Dex de I'Erberie). 
Further evidence of the universality 
of science, even in the so-called Dark 
Ages, was the long-continued collabo- 
ration of Christians, Moslems and Jews, 
during the whole of Europe's “crusad- 
ing periods”. To the average European 
of the Middle Ages, whoever did not 
belong to the orthodox Christian 
Church, whether he was a Jew, a 
Moslem, a Hindu, a pagan—or worst of 
all a heretic—was hardly considered as 
a human being. 
Written records of the Salerno school 
show the influence of the great Arabian 
schools of the Orient and Mohamme- 
dan Spain. The Persian physicians 
Rhazes (865-925) and Avicenna (980- 
1037); and the Spanish Arabs Aven- 
zoar (1113-1162) and Averroes (1126- 
1198), as well as the great Maimonides, 
a Spanish Jew (1135-1204), were inten- 
sively studied at Salerno. Two of the 
most celebrated Jewish physicians, the 
urologist Isaac Judaeus (9th or 10th 
century) and the oculist Benvenutus 
Grassus (born in Jerusalem in the 11th 
or 12th century) had studied and taught 
at the Salerno school. 
Salerno re-awakened a scientific 
spirit, independent of dogmatic doc- 
trines; revived ancient texts, and 
inspired its students to a calm and 
critical appraisal of facts. Thus, 
Salerno paved the way for the great 
achievements of the universities of the 
Renaissance. 
Its outstanding accomplishments and 
its lasting influence were possible 
because, right from the beginning, it 
overcame the towering barriers of 
religious and national prejudice and 
aimed to make knowledge available to 
the greatest possible number of people 
of all lands of the then known world.

### 58451: The Ruins of Nemrud Dagh

I
 
  
 
Twenty centuries ago, Antiochus 1, King of 
Commagene raised a mighty monument to him- 
self and his gods atop Nemrud Dagh (Mount 
Nimrod) in the Anti-Taurus Mountains of present- 
day Turkey. Hewn from the mountain rock, the 
sanctuary consists of three terraces levelled on 
the summit and decorated with giant statues 
of Antiochus and the deities worshipped by his 
Greek and Persian ancestors. Above the ter- 
races rises a great tumulus of rock chippings 
which archaeologists believe may hide the tomb 
of Antiochus, but so far this rocky cairn has 
defied exploration. The colossal statues guard- 
ing the secret of this Anatolian king still stand, 
but most have been decapitated. Left, fallen 
heads of deities litter the west terrace of 
Nimrud Dagh. Though now shattered by earth- 
quakes, erosion and vandalism, the deities still 
seem marvels of engineering skill. Upon their 
platform, they rose as high as a five-storey 
building. Above, heads of Herakles (on left) and 
Zeus (right) are twice the height of a man. 
Above left, bearded Herakles (foreground) and 
handsome Apollo resemble giants buried to the 
neck in the rocky soil.

The existence of a supra-national platform of discussion is apt

### 58452: Antarctica, international land of science

Arancrion is a true landmark in history as well as in 
geography. It is as international now as science itself. The whole 
continent is inhabited only by scientists who have come from 12 nations 
with no purpose of conquest or possession. They share their data 
and discoveries, their equipment and supplies as well as their hard- 
ships with men from other lands. The continent is a vast area of 
nearly 6,000,000 square miles, approximately circular, and 3,000 miles 
in diameter—nearly twice as large as Europe, almost as large as 
South America. Over it all is the endless monotony of the age-old ice 
sheet, in places 10,000 feet thick. Here six thousand scientists are 
studying how the Antarctic influences world weather conditions, the 
world water balance, glaciers, ocean currents, etc., and are making 
measurements of the earth's magnetism, cosmic rays, the aurora and 
other phenomena of the upper atmosphere and of the earth's interior. 
The exploration and study of Antarctica is one of the major aspects 
of history's greatest global operation in science—the International 
Geophysical Year (IGY) which began in 1957 and set out to observe 
and measure features of the earth and its vicinity, heretofore beyond 
man’s reach. None of these problems can be investigated in the | 
laboratories or from observatories of a single country. The winds 
on high, the rivers in the sea, the forces of gravity and magnetism, 
the radiations that bombard the earth from outer space, know no- 
thing of national frontiers. If they are to be understood, it must be 
by the joint action of many nations. For the first time in history, 
this is now possible. It will change our concepts of the universe and 
our understanding of the forces that play upon and within the earth.

### 58453: The Mysterious hieroglyphs of Easter Island

THE MYSTERIOUS 
HIEROGLYPHS 
OF EASTER ISLAND 
by Alfred Métraux 
Ec since a Dutch vessel 
chanced across it two centuries ago, 
Easter Island, no more than a speck 
in the vastness of the South Pacific, 
has intrigued the world with myster- 
ies which have so far been only par- 
tially and tentatively explained. 
For long the principal mystery of 
Easter Island lay in the colossal sta- 
tues which still dot the bare slopes 
of the Rano-raraku volcano and which 
once stood in far greater numbers like 
sentinels over the mausoleums along 
the seashore. 
In my opinion the greatest “mystery” 
of Easter Island is not to be found in 
the many colossal statues erected 
there. There is no doubt that the 
ancestors of the present Polynesian 
inhabitants hewed out these statues 
and dragged them to their present 
sites, abandoning the workshops where 
they carved them perhaps only three 
or four centuries ago. 
However, no one has yet been able 
to give a satisfactory explanation for 
what appears to be a form of writing 
developed on the island. 
This writing first came to light about 
1860 when the people of the island, 
newly converted to Christianity, sent 
the Bishop of Tahiti, a Monsignor 
Jaussen, a long cord braided from 
their own hair, wound around an old 
piece of wood. Looking casually at 
the improvised spool, the Bishop was 
surprised to see that it was covered 
 
ALFRED METRAUX, noted anthropologist and 
writer, won international fame for his work 
on Easter Island and amongst the Indians of 
South ‘America, and his efforts on behalf of 
racial equality. He died in 1963. 
with small figures, all of the same’ 
height and carefully arranged in 
straight lines. These reminded him of 
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and he wrote 
to the missionaries on Easter Island 
asking them to look for other tablets 
and to try to decipher them. 
Seeing how interested he was in this 
object, one of the islanders brought 
in a large tablet, perfectly preserved. 
Since then, other tablets have been 
found on the island and now total 24, 
including one large wooden rod cover- 
ed with hundreds of symbols. 
At the time when the first tablets 
were discovered, it’ would probably 
have been possible to obtain the key 
to the mystery from the surviving 
members of the priestly caste. The 
old civilization of Easter Island had 
only recently collapsed but there were 
still a few “wise men” alive who could 
have explained the meaning of the 
strange symbols on the tablets had 
they been questioned. 
Unfortunately, the missionaries were 
not skilful investigators. They queried 
the islanders who, at the sight of the 
tablets, began to intone chants, instead 
of “reading” them. The missionaries 
treated them as frauds and lost interest 
in the matter. 
Mgr. Jaussen, however, was more 
persevering. In Tahiti, he found an 
Easter Islander named Metoro, who 
had learnt the mysteries of the tablets 
under a famous master. The Bishop 
handed him a tablet and asked him to 
“read” it. Metoro turned it this way 
and that and suddenly began to chant. 
He “read” the tablet from right to 
left, without bothering to turn it round, 
although in each line the signs are 
upside down in relation to that preced- 
ing or following. 
Jaussen took down the text as Me- 
toro recited it, and his manuscript 
was recently published. If each phrase 
is compared with the corresponding 
symbols, it appears that what Jaussen 
had taken to be a connected text is 
simply a disjointed succession of brief 
descriptions of the symbols viewed by 
his interpreter, and a series of isolated 
words or phrases suggested by those 
symbols. There is no logical develop- 
ment or general sense in the chant or 
recital. Mgr. Jaussen ended by losing 
heart himself and abandoned his efforts 
to get to the bottom of the mystery. 
Other attempts were made to extract 
from the islanders information which 
might have made it possible to de- 
cipher the symbols. On a visit to East- 
er Island in 1886, an American paymas- 
ter, Mr. W. Thomson, was taken to the 
house of an old man called Ure-Vaeiko, 
who, in his youth, had attended the 
sciiool of the Tangata rongo-rongo, 
(singers or bards) and learned to read 
the tablets. 
Ure-Vaeiko consented to “read” 
photographs of the tablets, if not the 
tablets themselves. He recited their 
contents from end to end without a 
moment's hesitation. It was noticed, 
however, that he was paying no atten- 
tion to the number of symbols in each 
line and, worse still, did not notice 
that the photographs had been sur- 
reptitiously changed. He went happily 
on reciting hymns and legends until 
he was accused of being a fraud. 
Responsibility for these lost oppor- 
tunities lies, not with the islanders, 
who appear to have acted in good 
faith, but with the early investigators, 
who were incapable of imagining a 
system of writing different from their 
own and were bent at all costs on 
having the tablets “read”. 
During my stay on Easter Island 
in 1934-35, | tried to discover, in the 
memories of my informants, some indi- 
cation, however vague or apparently 
insignificant, which might have put me 
onto the right track; but it was all 
useless. The inhabitants had, it is 
true, assured me that the tablets were 
similar to the “cat's cradle” patterns, 
each suggesting a chant to the viewer. 
| concluded that the tablets were 
  
 
The strange “hieroglyphs” discovered 
on Easter Island are mostly engraved 
on wooden tablets or othe: wooden 
objects, like this fish. They depict 
stylized human forms, birds, fish, plants, 
shellfish and ceremonial objects, or 
sometimes geometrical designs. Easter 
Islanders can no longer read this 
ancient script or system of notation, 
and scientists have been unable to 
decipher it until now.

tues, carved from soft volcanic stone, for which the 
island is famous (the head is now in the Musée 
de I'Homme in Paris). A skilled artist, Loti was 
assigned to make a series of drawings of the 
statues, the islanders, their dwellings and their 
tools and artifacts. He also did a number c 
drawings of the islanders’ tattoo patterns. Loti 
drew two types of statues found on Easter Island:

mnemonic pictographs used in reciting some of the Easter Island symbols and dians in Panama. The famous pre- 
the genealogies and sacred hymns 
which form a large part of the Poly- 
nesian liturgy. | was all the more 
inclined to this interpretation because, 
in the Marquesas, which are probably 
the original home of the Easter Island- 
ers, the singers or bards associate 
their liturgical poems with small fibre 
pouches from which hang thin knotted 
cords. It was thus possible that each 
symbol on the tablets represented a 
sentence, a line or even a stanza. 
This, then, was the hypothesis | had 
arrived at and which was accepted 
by other anthropologists. But | am less 
sure now that my interpretation is 
right since receiving a letter from a 
German anthropologist, Dr. T.S. Bar- 
thel, suggesting that the system used 
by the Easter Islanders was far more 
complicated than mere picture-writing, 
and could be a real script, part ideo- 
graphic part phonetic, using the rebus 
somewhat in the fashion of the Mexi- 
can and Mayan scripts. According to 
this interpretation, the script consisted 
of symbols indicating the general mean- 
ing of a sentence by the use of a num- 
ber of key words. 
A Hungarian linguist, G. de Hevesy, 
has pointed out similarities between 
the undeciphered script of the Mo- 
henjo-Daro and Harappa civilizations 
which existed in the Indus Valley some 
six thousand years ago. 
The Austrian scholar, Professor 
R. Heine-Geldern, considers it doubt- 
ful that a direct link exists between 
these two scripts since there are far 
more symbols that are different than 
symbols that are the same. His ar- 
chaeological research led him to be- 
lieve that the Polynesian civilizations 
originated in China, and it was there 
that he sought the origins of their 
system of writing. 
Heine-Geldern compared the sym- 
bols of Mohenjo-Daro and Easter Island 
with those of the earliest Chinese 
writing found on oracle bones and 
shells dating back to the second millen- 
nium B.C. He found that some of the 
symbols were common to all three 
scripts and concluded that the writing 
of Easter Island had been transported 
to the Pacific by a people from 
southern China possessing a system 
of writing that may have originated 
in central Asia or Iran. 
Heine-Geldern also compared the 
Easter Island writing with the picto- 
graphs still used among the Cuna In- 
historian, Dr. G. von Koenigswald, has 
pointed out similarities between the 
Easter Islands symbols and certain 
drawings on fabrics in Indonesia. 
| think it is fairly easy to discover 
" curious similarities between scripts of 
the pictographic type. The very fact 
that it is so easy should put us on our 
guard. Whatever the true nature of 
the symbols on Easter Island's tablets, 
| believe that the scribes who made 
them sought their models in the ls- 
land's natural and cultural environment. 
To me, all the indications seem to 
be that the writing of Easter Island 
was invented on that remote little 
island itself, probably on the basis of 
some mnemonic system brought by 
the ancestors of the Easter Islanders 
from their original home, 
If it is ultimately proved that these 
symbols are indeed hieroglyphics which 
can be “read”, then the Easter Island- 
ers, who have already amazed the 
world by the quality of their art and 
the impressive proportions of their 
monuments, could claim the additional 
honour of having by a stroke of genius 
taken a decisive step in the develop- 
ment of civilization.

### 58455: The Galapagos Islands: living laboratory of evolution

THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS: 
LIVING LABORATORY 
OF EVOLUTION 
l. 1837, after a five-year 
voyage aboard the Beagle in the 
waters of South America, the Pacific 
Islands and Australia, Charles Darwin 
wrote in his journal : “In July | opened 
my first notebook on transmutation of 
species. Had been greatly struck 
from about month of previous March 
on character of South American fossils 
and species of Galapagos Archipelago. 
These facts origin (especially latter) of 
all my views,” 
Thus, the Galapagos Archipelago, 
lying some 600 miles out in the Pacific 
west of the coast of Ecuador, to which 
it belongs, directly inspired the famous 
British naturalist. 
Superficially, this tiny archipelago 
appears to have nothing of particular 
interest to the scientist. A few dots 
on most maps (their total area covers

logical laboratory of the National Museum 
of Natural History mn Paris. 
by Jean Dorst 
less than 3,000 square miles), the 
13 islands of the Galapagos group 
include five which are fairly large (the 
largest is Albemarle island, 60 miles 
in length). numerous islets and rocks. 
Of volcanic origin, they are the peaks 
of a range of submarine volcanoes 
thrust up from the sea by successive 
eruptions. 
Though close to the equator, the 
Galapagos Islands are washed by fairly 
cool seas from the famous Humboldt 
Current which brings cold water from 
the Antarctic along the coasts of Chile 
and Peru, then turns west at the equa- 
tor and runs towards the Galapagos 
Islands, after which it loses itself in 
the ocean depths. 
The fauna living in the archipelago 
is limited to very few species. As 
these species were isolated by large. 
stretches of ocean from the dawn of 
history, they form a world apart—which 
has followed its own evolutionary 
laws shut off from the rest of our 
planet. Plants and animals arrived 
there from the American continent as 
best they could, swimming, flying or 
borne by the winds on natural rafts 
composed of a tangle of tree trunks 
and deadwood like those offen carried 
along by many big tropical rivers. 
The ocean crossing must have been 
a difficult enterprise and, in fact, only 
a limited number of creatures made 
the voyage safely. This explains the 
paucity of the Galapagos fauna and 
flora, especially as compared with the 
luxuriance of tropical America. 
It may thus seem surprising that 
biologists regard these apparently 
barren islands as a scientific wonder- 
land. But the scientists are right, for 
the Galapagos !slands are no less than 
a natural laboratory in which the pro- 
cess of evolution can be clearly 
observed. As the botanist, J.T. Howell, 
so rightly said they are the workroom 
and show-window of Evolution.

POACHING: THE SHOCKING 
SLAUGHTER OF AFRICA’S WILD LIFE           
      
    
| HE ng 
: Jib LAE           
Poaching today in Africa is a large-scale illegal trade in slaughtered 
wild animals. It is by no means confined to killing for meat; all 
too often it takes the horrible and wasteful form of merely taking 
the valuable trophies such as rhino horn, wildebeest tails or elephant 
ivory, and leaving the slaughtered carcasses to rot. The poacher’s 
methods are not only wasteful, but extremely cruel. Gangs of 
bowmen with poisoned arrows wait near a waterhole or at a gap 
in a prepared barrier, and shoot large numbers of animals which 
then die an agonizing death. Pitfalls are worse. The large number 
of animals that fall into them suffer a much more lingering death. 
Wire snares are the worst of all. Animals die a slow and horrible 
death, sometimes beset by vultures and hyenas. The abolition of 
this shocking trade is becoming just as compelling an aim in the 
Africa of the present as was the abolition of the slave trade in 
the Africa of a century ago. Like the slave trade, it is profitable, 
highly organized, extremely cruel and quite ruthless.

### 58455: The Galapagos Islands: living laboratory of evolution

The spectacle of 
iguanas basking on 
the rocks of the 
Galapagos is like a 
flashback to the earth's 
reptile age. After 
visiting the Islands in 
1841, Herman Melville, 
author of “Moby Dick” 
wrote: “..Little but 
reptile life Is found 
here; tortoises, lizards, 
immense spiders, 
snakes, and that 
strangest anomaly of 
outlandish nature, 
the iguana.” 
Islands have served as a refuge for 
animals of an archaic type and for a 
biological environment which has van- 
ished everywhere else in the world. 
As mammals could not reach these 
islands, the reptiles developed, un- 
hindered by natural selection or pre- 
datory animals. 
The scene that unfolds before one's 
eyes on setting foot on these shores 
recalls the prehistoric era of the age 
of the reptiles. Along the beaches 
live marine iguanas 3% feet long, the 
only marine saurians still in existence. 
They feed on seaweed, grazing at low 
tide and bask in the sun in colonies 
sometimes running into hundreds. 
In the interior, land iguanas of a 
different type live amongst the cactus 
along with the giant tortoises which 
are such a characteristic sight that 
their Spanish name, "Galapagos", was 
applied to the islands. These giants, 
whose shells alone measure 33% feet, 
are now found only in the Galapagos 
Islands and the Seychelles, though 
fossilized remains extend over a vast 
area covering North America and 
Europe. 
The remoteness of the archipelago 
resulted in a simplification of the fauna 
thus making it easier to follow the 
laws of evolution here than anywhere 
else in the world. Elsewhere the com- 
plexities of nature and the diversity of 
forms have made it virtually impossible 
to trace the lineage of many species. 
The Galapagos Islands thus stand 
out as Nature's great experimental 
laboratory. 
This is particularly true of the famous 
Darwin finches, or Geospizidae, spar- 
rows indigenous to the Galapagos 
Islands. The Islands’ 14 species are 
all derived from a common ancestor, 
which obviously arrived there at a time 
when there were no other birds. The 
Darwin finches strikingly summarize 
the whole process of the evolution of 
sparrows. 
Owing to the paradoxical conditions 
of the natural environment—mainly 
due to the presence of cold currents 
at the equator alongside masses of 
warm water-—fauna of very diverse ori- 
gins have crossbred on these islands. 
Here penguins, usually associated 
with the Antarctic, rub shoulders with 
frigate and tropic birds found near 
warm tropical waters. The combined 
presence of creatures having such 
widely different origins and ecological 
preferences is an important factor in 
the evolution now taking place. These 
peculiar circumstances enable us to 
study at first hand the adaptation of 
animals to their environment. 
Yet the situation of the fauna and 
flora is so precarious that this unique 
biological complex is threatened with 
extinction. Up till the sixteenth cen- 
tury the islands remained untouched 
by man. Then came successive waves 
of pirates, buccaneers and settlers— 
mostly mutineers or ex-prisoners. 
F orronareny the present 
population is made up of law-abiding 
and friendly settlers, but like many 
people elsewhere they know little about 
nature conservation. Furthermore, they 
have introduced animals previously 
unknown to the islands, most of which 
are now overrun with goats, pigs, dogs 
and cattle bred from domestic animals 
turned wild, not to mention the rats 
and mice introduced accidentally. So 
in addition to the direct depredations 
of man, the natural fauna has had to 
face the vigorous competition of ani- 
mals better equipped for the struggle 
for life than reptiles. 
Everywhere in the islands the 
reptiles have diminished in number— 
especially the tortoises. In former 
times they were massacred for their 
fat; now their eggs and young are 
devoured by the dogs and pigs. Some 
species are already extinct, while 
others are in a precarious situation.

The fauna as a whole is seriously 
threatened. We are in danger of 
seeing a priceless natural heritage 
disappear before our very eyes. 
As early as 1934 this state of affairs 
alarmed the Ecuadorian Government, 
which passed laws to protect the 
Galapagos fauna and flora and setting 
aside most of the islands as national 
parks. Unfortunately these regulations 
were hardly applied. After the Sec- 
ond World War, Ecuador turned to 
Unesco and the International Union 
for the Conservation of Nature and 
asked them to send a mission to study 
the islands, and to suggest ways to 
preserve the Galapagos fauna and 
flora. 
In 1958, Unesco founded the Charles 
Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos 
Islands with headquarters in Brussels, 
and in 1960 began construction of a 
biological station on Indefatigable 
Island (Santa Cruz), both in co-opera- 
tion with the Government of Ecuador. 
New legislation introduced by 
Ecuador has now proved effective. 
Large areas have been decreed natural 
reserves, notably Narborough Island 
(Fernandina), which has retained it ori- 
ginal appearance, and the western part 
of Indefatigable Island (Santa Cruz), 
where tortoises are still fairly numer- 
ous. The Foundation will continue to 
suggest to the Ecuadorian authorities 
measures aimed at protecting and 
conserving a natural complex found 
nowhere else in the world and Is also 
carrying out extensive research in 
zoology, botany, soil biology and 
marine life. 
The combined efforts of scientists 
from all over the world are in this 
way making up in some measure for 
the depredations committed by other 
men. The Foundation stands as a 
monument to Charles Darwin, whose 
evolutionary theories were conceived 
on the desolate shores of this tiny 
volcanic archipelago.

### 58457: The Heritage of H.M.S. Bounty

20 
OF 
H.M.S. BOUNTY 
by Harry L. Shapiro 
Prine the most widely 
known of all cases of race mixture is 
the small group of Polynesian-English 
origin that lives on Pitcairn Island, in 
the South Pacific. Here, on a tiny 
volcanic island only about two miles 
long and about half as wide were 
resolved the train of events that the 
mutiny on the Bounty set in action. 
This episode, famous in British nav- 
al annals, occurred in the year 1789 
shortly after “H.M.S. Bounty" had de- 
parted from Tahiti where she had been 
dispatched ‘under the command of 
Lt. William Bligh to collect bread fruit 
plants. 
After six successful months in Tahiti, 
with the ship's hold full of potted trees, 
the return trip was interrupted by the 
mutiny of twenty-five of the crew of 
forty-four. The mutineers were led by 
Fletcher Christian, one of Bligh's 
officers. 
The mutineers seized the ship, put 
Bligh and those faithful to him adrift 
in a small open boat and reset the 
Bounty's course for Tubuai, an island 
300 miles south of Tahiti. Here an 
abortive attempt was made to estab- 
lish a settlement, which failed because 
of the hostility of the islanders. 
Returning to Tahiti, the mutineers 
split into two groups: one, consisting 
of sixteen men, remained in Tahiti; the 
other nine, headed by Christian, to- 
gether with twelve Tahitian women and 
six Tahitian men, set sail from Tahiti 
in September 1789 to find an unknown 
island where they could hide. 
For 19 years, until 1808, they were 
virtually lost to the world. In the latter 
year, their retreat on Pitcairn, some

The rugged shoreline of Bounty Bay on Pitcairn Island. 
2,500 miles south-east of Tahiti, was 
discovered by Captain Meyhew Folger. 
During this interval much had hap- 
pened on the island. All the Tahitian 
men and all but one of the Englishmen 
had died—most of them violently and 
after only a short sojourn in their new 
home. In addition, Folger found eight 
or nine surviving Tahitian women and 
twenty-five children, offspring of six 
of the Englishmen and their Poly- 
nesian wives. None of the Tahitian 
men had left issue. 
From this handful of children, half 
Polynesian half English, the little colony 
increased until fifty years later there 
were almost 200 inhabitants on the 
island. Fear of over-population and 
the recurrence of water shortages in- 
duced them to request of the British 
Government the use of Norfolk Island, 
some 4,000 miles to the west, as a 
new home. This considerably larger 
island was uninhabited. 
in 1856, the entire colony moved 
there, but subsequently several fami- 
lies returned to their beloved Pitcairn. 
In 1864, there were 45 descendants of 
the mutineers living on Pitcairn, the re- 
mainder having continued on Norfolk. 
At present, there are on both islands 
about 1,000 descendants of the original 
colony, not counting those who have 
married out of the community or settled 
elsewhere. 
As an example of race mixture the 
Pitcairn Islanders are far from typical. 
But it is the very singularity of the 
colony that is full of meaning in inter- 
preting race mixture as we commonly 
see it. Simply as a cross between 
Polynesians and English they can be 
matched in many parts of Polynesia 
where the same kind of mingling has 
occurred, often with notable results, as 
in New Zealand. 
But unlike all other mixtures of this 
kind in Oceania, and indeed unlike 
virtually all race mixture wherever it 
Here nine of 
the mutineers of the “Bounty”, led by Fletcher Christian, and 18 Tahitian 
men and women found refuge and established a colony which still 
stands as a remarkable example of racial harmony. 
occurs (1), the Pitcairn Islanders have 
lived and developed their common life 
completely separated from the socie- 
ties from which they were originally 
derived. 
The entire community was of the 
same mixed origin, was free of any 
social structuring imposed upon them 
by a larger society and escaped the 
influences that prejudice subtly works 
upon its object. This, then, is a 
community where social prejudice, at 
least, is not a factor to be considered 
and where we can study the con- 
sequences of race mixture divorced 
from the concomitant effects that 
being a part of a larger group might 
impose. 
For the first eighteen years of its 
existence, the Pitcairn colony remain- 
ed unvisited by any ship. The child- 
ren growing up in the first genera- 
tion of the community had never seen 
anyone not a member of their little 
family, for the early colony lived 
as one extended family with John 
Adams, the surviving mutineer, as 
their pater familias. 
Even after 1808 when their existence 
became known, callers were rare and 
their visits very brief. Not until the 
1820s did ships begin to call at Pit- 
cairn to obtain water and fresh foods. 
As American whaling became in- 
creasingly active in the Pacific these 
visits increased in number, reaching 
their highest frequency in the 1840s. 
With the decline of whaling, Pit- 
cairn once more reverted to its 
former loneliness. These contacts, 
although important in bringing to the 
islanders the goods of the outside 
world for which they had acquired

a taste, were brief and had little or 
no influence on the social structure 
of the colony. 
To anyone visiting the island, it is 
evident that here is a well-organized 
settlement, conducting its own affairs 
successfully under a system devised 
by the islanders themselves. There 
is no trace of a people conscious of 
inferiority. 
Remarkable in so small a commun- 
ity, especially one cut off from the 
developments of the outside world, 
are some of the social institutions 
which were established on Pitcairn 
and maintained there ever since. 
A democratic rule developed early 
with all men and women enjoying 
equal political rights, long before poli- 
tical rights were granted women in the 
Western World and indeed before they 
were -even seriously discussed there. 
Education was from the first recog- 
nized as a necessity and all children 
were required to attend school until 
their sixteenth year. The various fami- 
lies on the island were taxed for the 
maintenance of the school. Teachers 
were selected from the students and 
supported by the revenue levied on 
the people. Here, too, the Pitcairn 
islanders were in advance of educa- 
tional developments in greater cen- 
tres of civilization. 
Te culture that emerged 
on Pitcairn also reflected the mixed 
origin of the colony and in a rather 
striking way illustrates the decisive 
réles that sex and environment may 
play in creating a new society. The 
cultural resources available to the new 
colony were, of course,. English and 
Tahitian. But it is obvious on re- 
flection that not all the content of 
either of these cultures could or 
would be drawn upon since one cul- 
ture, the English, was accessible only 
through men who were sailors by 
occupation, and the other, the Tahi- 
tian, was represented by women who 
were familiar with the crafts and 
skills traditionally exercised in Tahiti 
by their sex. 
In addition to this, the colony on 
Pitcairn faced an environment unlike 
the seats of either people, and in 
transplanting their traditional ways 
both the Tahitian women and the 
English sailors found themselves with- 
out the usual technical equipment need- 
ed to practice whatever skills and 
arts they knew. Even such a basic 
and necessary object as a nail was 
not available, not to mention a var- 
iety of common tools that could not 
be fashioned on Pitcairn. 
Thus, we find tata cloth universal- 
ly used by the colony in its early 
days. The making of this bark cloth 
is traditionally a woman's job in Tahiti 
and could be carried to Pitcairn intact. 
Similarly, cooking being a woman's 
concern, the Tahitian technique of an 
underground oven was standard on 
Pitcairn. 
= 
House building, on the contrary, 
was the result of a complex of in- 
fluences. The Tahitian style of house 
would have been unsuitable in the 
colder climate of Pitcairn, but in any 
event it probably could not have been 
built by the women who in Tahiti 
leave the framing of a house to the 
men. The Englishmen, probably only 
as adept in carpentry as sailors of 
those days might be expected to be, 
were handicapped by the lack of 
essential building materials and ham- 
pered by the lack of tools. 
We find them as a consequence 
building houses ingeniously put 
together, the frame mortised, the 
walls constructed of roughly hewn 
planks fitted into slotted uprights, 
the interiors provided with bunks 
as in a ship's cabin. The roof, 
however, was thatched in the Tahi- 
tian manner since roof thatching is 
prepared in Tahiti by the women and 
this was a contribution the Tahitian 
women on Pitcairn could make to this 
novel house. 
One of the common allegations 
made about race mixture is that it 
produces inferior human beings. This 
belief is stated in various ways that 
all come to the same thing: mixed 
bloods combine the worst features 
of both parental groups, they are 
inferior to both stocks, or, at best, 
they are intermediate and therefore a 
debasement of the superior group. 
In the mid-19th century the typical 
reaction was delight in finding so 
moral, upright and virtuous a colony 
sprung from mutineers, from violence 
and from murder. Nowadays, being 
less concerned with religious matters, 
with on the whole rather different 
values, the present visitor is less 
impressed by these qualities and is 
likely to prize other aspects of their 
character, 
For my part | can report that, 
allowing for their isolation and for a 
consequent lack of sophistication, | 
found the Pitcairn Islanders an 
intelligent and attractive people. And 
| was struck by the number of men 
and women of impressive character, 
possessed of the qualities that make 
for leadership. 
Although biologically rather more of 
what might be called objective infor- 
mation is accessible, still it can only 
be used for comparative purposes 
with caution. Even such standard 
criteria as physical vigour, longevity 
or health cannot be properly used for 
such purposes without reference to 
diet, climate and various other environ- 
mental conditions. 
Both on Norfolk and Pitcairn Islands 
the physical condition of the islanders 
was excellent. In spite of the 
inbreeding, which has especially 
characterized Pitcairn, | found no 
physical deformities or obvious signs 
of degeneration. 
On Pitcairn with a population of 
200 (1936) there were no cases of 
serious mental deficiency. This is 
an excellent record compared with 
the frequency of such cases in Europe 
and the United States, especially in 
remote, inbred villages. 
In view of the fact that neither on 
Pitcairn nor Norfolk is there any 
resident medical service or even 
trained nursing aid, the longevity of 
the population is impressive. 
There have been some claims that 
children of race mixtures are smaller 
and weaker than their parents. The 
Pitcairn and Norfolk evidence is quite 
the contrary. Indeed, there is evi- 
dence here of hybrid vigour compar- 
able to the vigour that can be 
demonstrated experimentally in a 
large number of animal and plant 
crosses and which is real enough 
to be commercially valuable to seed 
companies. 
For example, if we take size as a 
measure of heightened physiological 
vigour as is done for maize or 
crossbred domestic animals, we find 
that the average stature of the 
parental groups is 171.4 centimetres 
for Tahitian males and 170.6 centi-

British Admiralty records). The modern 
Englishman averages around 172 cms. 
The first generation descendants, 
averaged 177.8 centimetres (minimum 
5 feet 9 1/2 inches, maximum 6 feet 1/4 
inch). This represents an average 
increase of over two inches, with the 
shortest male exceeding the average 
of his parental groups by a consid- 
erable margin. Although this striking 
increase has not been fully main- 
tained in the present generation, it is 
still almost an inch above the parental 
average. 
As far as the evidence goes, then, 
the Pitcairn experiment lends no 
support for the thesis that race mixture 
merely leads to degeneration or at 
best produces a breed inferior to the 
superior parental race. In fact, we 
see in this colony some support for 
heightened vigour, for an extended 
variation and for a successful issue 
of the mingling of two diverse strains.

THE SPREAD OF 
BUDDHIST CULTURE 
by Anil de Silva 
| India, during the third 
century B.C. the Emperor Asoka was 
converted to Buddhism after a bloody 
war against the neighbouring Kalinga 
Kingdom. He then issued his famous 
edict which he caused to be carved 
on rock and stone throughout his 
kingdom: 
“One hundred and fifty thousand 
people were deported, one hundred 
thousand people were killed, many 
times this number perished... Remorse 
fills the King friend of the Gods since 
he has conquered Kalinga. The con- 
quest of an independent country 
means murder, death or captivity for 
men. All are victims of violence and 
death and separation from those who 
are dear to them. These thoughts 
weigh heavily on the King friend of 
the Gods... 
“Even if the number of victims in the 
“conquest of Kalinga were a hundred 
thousand times smaller, the thought 
of this would afflict the King friend 
of the Gods. Even if they were in the 
wrong the King friend of the Gods 
believes we should have been as 
patient as possible. The victory that 
is the best of all is the Victory of the 
Good Law (Buddhism). This text of 
the Law is engraved for my sons and 
grandchildren so that they will not 
dream of new victories, Let them 
seek real victories through the exer- 
cise of patience...” 
The world in which Buddhism was 
born 2,500 years ago was a world 
of vast movements of men and ideas, 
much vaster than we generally imag- 
ine. In this world India was geogra- 
phically, the crossroads between 
Western and Far Eastern civilizations. 
Both the great land routes entered

Buddhist painting and sculpture. 
her northern passes from the West 
through Persia and from the East 
through China and Central Asia, over 
the old silk caravan route. 
On the maritime routes, Persian, 
Greek, Roman and Alexandrian ships 
scoured the ports of Gujerath and 
Konkan on the west coast, and Coim- 
batore, Andhra, Bengal and Ceylon in 
the south. India was also the port 
of call for Far Eastern ships going 
westwards, and her own ships sailed 
out in all directions. 
Contacts between the Western 
world and India were continuous. 
The Persian Emperor Darius left his 
great terraced palace at Persepolis to 
lead an expedition into the Punjab and 
the Indus valley a few years before 
the death of Buddha in the 5th 
century B.C, 
Alexander's expedition in the fourth 
century B.C., bringing with it topo- 
graphers and scientists, helped to 
strengthen the land route kept up by 
the couriers of the Persian monarchs. 
Alexander built a port and a fleet on 
the Indus and his captain, Nearque, 
sailed down the Indus, forging a mari- 
time route between the Indus and the 
Tigris. Alexander returned through 
Afghanistan with elephants and Indian 
soldiers in his army. 
The whole of north-west India, 
Afghanistan, Gandhara (Afghanistan 
and Pakistan territory) and the 
Punjab remained for centuries under 
a succession of Greek princes, one of 
whom, Milanda (Menander), became a 
Buddhist. These Greek kingdoms 
favoured the penetration of Greek, 
Hellenistic and Roman culture. Greeks 
intermarried with Indians and these 
colonies formed centres of a new 
Greco-Roman Buddhist culture. The 
new culture developed rapidly under 
the Kushana Empire which succeeded 
the Greeks in the 1st century A.D.

invaded India from China and Central 
Asia and whose emperors were con- 
verted to Buddhism). 
More important than wars and 
conquests was the long period of 
friendship between Alexander's suc- 
cessors, the Seleucid kings in Persia 
and the Mauryan kings in north India, 
whose palace was modelled on that 
of Darius at Persepolis, Persia. Am- 
bassadors were exchanged and for- 
eign merchants thronged the capital 
Pataliputra (today Patna, capital of 
Bihar province, north-east India). The 
Emperor Asoka married a Greek princ- 
ess and sent his missionaries both 
to the East and the West. His emis- 
saries to the West, carrying the 
message of Buddha, reached Persia, 
Egypt, Macedonia, Cyrenaica and 
north-west Greece. 
The Roman historian Pliny tells us 
that Rome bought 50 million sesterces 
worth of merchandise from India every 
year: cotton from Malwa, lacquer 
and nard from Pataliputra, indigo, 
spices and precious stones from Kon- 
kan, jades, ivories, silk and elephants 
which the Romans used in large 
numbers for their army and circus. 
Roman coins of gold have been found 
in the north-west and along the coast 
of south India at Cannanore, Coim- 
batore and Mahabalipurum with effi- 
gies of Augustus, Caracalla, Claudius, 
Theodore and Constantine. A Roman- 
Asian artist named Titus painted Bud- 
dhist frescoes at Miran in Central 
Asia. Alexandrine merchants aided 
Buddhist convents at Nasik and Junnar 
near Bombay. 
History gives us only a glimpse of 
the vast movement of men at this 
time: recruits in various armies 
(Indian archers excelled in the Persian 
army); craftsmen, metal workers, ivory 
carvers (Indian ivories have been 
found in Pompeii); weavers, jewellers, 
sculptors and ceramists were sought 
after at any price and protected by 
merchants and princes. 
— Asia had two 
routes through the desert: a northern 
one and a southern one. They met at 
Tun Huang in north-west China. These 
were the principle arteries of Buddhist 
expansion in Central Asia and China 
and all became powerful centres of 
Buddhist culture. Thousands of grottos 
were excavated and open-air construc- 
tions were built. At Kizil alone thou- 
sands of grottos were cut out, painted 
and carved by artisans from the Middle 
East, India and China. 
Hsuan Tsang, the famous Chinese 
scholar who made his pilgrimage to 
India by the northern route in the 
7th century AD. has left an unfor- 
gettable account of his journey through 
burning deserts and snow-clad passes.

of the women of Kutsha and record

The sanctuaries in the Horyuji monastery at Nara, near Kyoto, are renowned as 
treasure houses of Buddhist art. In the famous Five-Storeyed Pagoda, more than 
80 clay figures made in the 8th century (the oldest dated works of clay 
sculpture in Japan) present four episodes from the life of Buddha. Here, saints, 
disciples and ascetics lament the passing of the Enlightened One. 
Chinese festivals, dressed in crimson 
silk turbans. The titles of their songs 
have been preserved: “The Meeting 
of the Seventh Evening,” “The Woman 
of Jade Takes Round the Cup,” and 
“The Battle of Flowers.” 
The frescoes of Kutsha, Kizil and 
Kumtura show us the splendid caval- 
iers—those who, Hsuan Tsang tells 
us, escorted him on his way, for many 
of these paintings were made by 
contemporaries of Hsuan Tsang. 
They show cavaliers wearing long 
boots, riding coats of silk falling to 
the knees and taken in at the waist 
with metal belts. Their tunics of blue, 
grey, white and olive green were 
embroidered with pearls, lined and 
bordered with fur. Their reddish hair 
was caught up with ribbons at the 
neck. They must have formed a glor- 
ious sight with their coloured and 
gilded banners and standards, sculp- 
tured and painted with heraldic ani- 
mals like the tiger and the dragon. 
Hsuan Tsang returned to China laden 
with manuscripts and images of the 
Buddha. 
Bamiyan in Afghanistan was the 
halting place for caravans either going 
to or coming from the difficult passes 
of the Hindu Kush which barred the 
way into India. Into the fagade of 
the great cliff of Bamiyan, cave 
sanctuaries with colossal Buddhas 
were carved and painted, two of these 
images reaching 173. and 120 feet in 
height. Merchants paid craftsmen 
and artists to paint and carve statues 
as thank-offerings for a safe journey. 
Tun Huang at the other end of the 
route was developed with the help 
of merchants and royal benefactors, 
for the Wei, T'ang and Sung dynasties 
in China all contributed to the creation 
of one of the most extraordinary 
monuments of Buddhist culture, 
Among the hundreds of cave tem- 
ples at Tun Huang, the Cave of the 
Thousand Buddhas, sealed up for 
centuries, housed priceless treasures 
of manuscripts and paintings on silk. 
The first mention of Buddhism in 
China is in 65 A.D. when the Han 
prince, Tch'ou protected a small Bud- 
dhist community at Lo-yang. The 
translation of Buddhist texts from 
Sanskrit and Pali into Chinese was 
officially encouraged by the Kushna 
Empire in India (30-224 A.D.). Chi- 
nese travellers, merchants, imperial 
envoys and pilgrims came to India by 
sea. Infact itis to Chinese historians 
that we owe the only written accounts

### 58458: The Spread of Buddhist culture

of these early kingdoms in south-east 
Asia, 
The spread of Buddhism throughout 
Asia came in several waves emanating 
from India from the first century A.D. 
Bronze statues of the time have been 
unearthed from the jungles of Annam, 
Borneo and Celebes. Buddhist cul- 
ture apparently superimposed itself 
on the whole of south-east Asia. 
However each region retained much of 
its own personality and character. 
In the 8th century A.D. Buddhist 
art began to mature and flower in 
these countries, gaining in movement 
and vigour when local tradition domin- 
ated. We see this clearly at Boro- 
budur (Java) in whose 1,400 panels 
and 504 statues of the Buddha the 
Javanese pattern of composition, har- 
mony and repose are blended with the 
Indian style of art. Later Javanese 
art threw off this influence and assert- 
ed its own national characteristics. 
Eventually there were large mona- 
steries and universities in all the 
Buddhist countries of south-east Asia, 
Japan and Korea. Pilgrims in their 
thousands from all over Asia thronged 
the great Buddhist universities of 
Takila «in Pakistan and Nalanda in 
India. Hostels were built by the kings 
of Ceylon and Java to house the 
students and pilgrims from their coun- 
tries at Nalanda and at Bodh Gaya in 
the Indian state of Bihar, where 
Buddha attained enlightenment under 
the Bodhi tree. 
Many of the ships leaving Bengal 
and the southern India ports carried 
pilgrims and missionaries and, in addi- 
tion to the spices, precious stones, 
muslins and silks in their holds, they 
bore statues of the Buddha made in 
the busy centres of Mathura and 
Nalanda. 
I. coming of Buddhism, 
coinciding as it did with increased 
trade and intercourse between Asian 
countries, resulted in a period of 
intense intellectual life. The message 
of the brotherhood of men—*No one 
is a Brahmin or an outcast by birth, 
but one becomes a Brahmin or an 
outcast by one's actions” (Vasala 
Sutra)—was like rain falling on parched 
earth. [It stimulated a resurgence of 
popular feeling just as Christ's mess- 
age did in Rome in early Christian 
times. 
The richly human content of the 
Buddhist message was the spiritual 
basis of an art which overrode the 
frontiers of artistic expression, revital- 
ized local traditions, making them 
truly Buddhist and at the same time 
freed expressions of national character, 
It was a message of hope. It was a 
message of peace. And these two 
important factors helped the develop- 
ment and maturity of a noble art that 
has enriched the artistic traditions of 
the world.

CHALLENGE OF THE SPACESHIP (Continued) 
The third revolution began, as all 
the world knows, in a squash-court in 
Chicago on December 2, 1942, when 
the first self-sustaining nuclear reac- 
tion was started by man. We are still 
too close to that cataclysmic event to 
see It in its true perspective, but we 
know that it will change our world, for 
better or for worse, almost beyond 
recognition. And we know too that it is 
linked with the fourth and in some 
ways greatest change of all—the 
crossing of space and the exploration 
of the other planets. 
The first spaceships capable of rea- 
ching another world may still lie half 
a century ahead, but the giant rocket 
is already with us and will soon be 
carrying men to the limits of the atmos- 
phere and beyond. Nor will it be many 
years before a guided missile reaches 
the moon and blazes the trail along 
which men will travel a generation later. 
An attempt to construct a philoso- 
phy of astronautics is therefore far 
from premature: it is, if anything, a 
little belated. In the last few years 
we have seen the political and ethical 
chaos produced when a great technical 
development comes into a world which 
is unprepared for it. 
If our civilization is to have a future, 
then we must see that it does not 
repeat its earlier mistakes. | do not 
suggest—as some have done—that 
lawyers need start worrying immedia- 
tely about the ownership of the moon, 
but the ownership of space will soon 
be a matter of acute practical impor- 
tance. This problem will be of grave 
concern in another decade, when long- 
range research projectiles begin to 
travel far outside the atmosphere with 
a supreme indifference to the geogra- 
phy beneath them. 
: Tene was a time—not long 
ago—when those who advocated 
interplanetary travel were always 
being asked, “How?". It is amusing 
to recall that in those days-—which 
now seem so remote—there were many 
people who refused to believe that a 
rocket could work in a vacuum or 
would ever be able to rise more than 
a few miles from the earth. 
Today, the power of the rocket has 
been demonstrated, only too thorough- 
ly. “How” is a question one seldom 
hears in discussions concerning space- 
flight: the commoner query is now 
“Why?” And it is much more difficult 
to answer, for it involves the motives 
underlying all human conduct. 
The urge to explore, to discover, to 
“follow knowledge like a sinking star”, 
is a primary human impulse which 
needs, and can receive, no further jus- 
tification than its own existence. The 
search for knowledge, said a modern 
Chinese philosopher, is a form of play. 
If this be true, then the spaceship, 
when it comes, will be the ultimate toy 
that may lead mankind from its clois- 
tered nursery out into the playground 
of the stars. 
It is not hard to think of entirely valid 
“practical” reasons why one should 
wish to cross space. There is no doubt 
that eventually sheer necessity would 
bring about the conquest of the other 
planets. | do not believe that it is 
possible to have a virile, steadily-ad- 
vancing culture limited to a single 
world, and taking the long-term view, 
we know that our earth will one day 
become uninhabitable. 
In his book, The Birth and Death of 
the Sun, the physicist George Gamow 
points out that before its evolution has 
finished, our sun will become 100 times 
as luminous as it is today. | am glad 
to see that he draws the obvious con- 
clusion and visualizes the migration of 
humanity to the outer planets before 
our earth's oceans have begun to boil. 
But the human race will not wait 
until it is kicked out. Long before the 
sun’s radiation has shown any measu- 
rable increase, man will have explored 
all the solar system and, like a cau- 
tious bather testing the temperature of 
the sea, will be making breathless little 
forays into the abyss which separates 
him from the stars. 
To support my argument, | now have 
to develop some sort of time-scale. 
| do this with much reluctance, since 
prophecy is a dangerous and thankless 
business, frequently fatal to those who 
practise it. We have, however, learned 
by past experience that even the most 
extravagant forecast seldom overtakes 
the truth. 
The advances in rocket research 
since the 1940s have been phenome- 
nal, but they have merely laid the foun- 
dations for what is still to come. Dur- 
ing the next decade, the techniques 
necessary to send small, radio-control- 
led rockets to the moon will become 
available. 
There is no reason why such flights 
should not take place by 1960. The 
public, not realizing the problems still 
to be faced, will expect human beings 
to follow in a very short time. It will 
be disappointed. During the subse- 
quent years there will be innumerable 
short-range flights beyond the atmos- 
phere by man-carrying ships reaching 
heights of a few thousand kilometres. 
But if we have to rely on chemical 
fuels, it may require at least 20 years 
of further experimenting before the first 
true spaceship lands on the moon and 
returns to earth. 
That brings us to the late 1970s. Any 
chemically fuelled spaceships will be 
unwieldy, fabulously expensive ma- 
chines with fuel consumptions measur- 
ed by the thousand tons for a single 
voyage. Not more than one or two 
countries will be able to build them, 
and they will be of scientific value only. 
There will be no question, for a very 
long time, of colonization or of voyages 
to the other planets. But—and it is a 
very large but—any prophet would in- 
deed be rash if he based his predic- 
tions upon the use of chemical fuels 
alone. 
Here, as in other fields, the great 
question-mark is atomic energy. In 
theory, a few kilogrammes of uranium 
could take a ship weighing 1,000 tons 
to the moon and back. In practice, we 
have a very long way to go befare this 
can be done. 
The fact that it is not possible for 
any spaceship to carry enough fuel for 
a voyage to another planet and back 
has long focused attention on what 
have been called “orbital techniques”. 
Once a rocket is above the atmosphere 
and therefore no longer subject to air 
resistance, it becomes theoretically 
possible for it to turn itself into a sort 
of “artificial moon”. It could wait 
effortlessly until “tanker” rockets were 
sent up to refuel it: then, when its 
supplies had been replenished, it could 
continue on its way. 
In this manner any interplanetary 
journey can be broken down into a 
number of stages, with refuelling bet- 
ween them, and this procedure is be- 
lieved to be the key to space-flight. 
It seems likely that we may use the 
present-day “chemical” rockets to 
climb up from earth into the refuelling 
orbit, and then continue from there 
using atomic or “ion” rockets. 
Aone power is hardly 
likely to advance the conquest of 
space by more than 10 years, but it 
may make it practical almost from 
the beginning which otherwise would 
certainly not have been the case. 
What is equally important, it will mean 
that the whole solar system, and not 
merely the moon, will be immediately 
accessible to man. 
it requires little more power to reach 
the planets than it does to go to the 
moon, but the most economical voy- 
ages involve months or event years of 
free “coasting” along orbits curving 
halfway round the sun. With atomic 
power these journeys could be cut to 
a fraction of the time. For example, 
the “cheapest” journey to Mars—as far 
as fuel is concerned—lasts 258 days. 
With an atomic ship, travelling by a 
more direct route at quite a moderate 
speed, it need take only a few weeks. 
The last quarter of this century will 
be an age of exploration such as man 
has never before known. By the year 
2000 most of the major bodies in the 
solar system will probably have been 
reached, but it will take centuries to 
examine them all in any detail. 
Those who seem to think that the 
moon is the goal of interplanetary tra- 
vel should remember that the solar 
system contains eight other planets, 
at least 30 moons, and some thousands 
of asteroids. The total area of the 
major bodies is about 250 times that 
of earth, though the four giant planets 
probably do not possess stable sur- 
faces on which landings could be 
made. Nevertheless, that still leaves 
an area 10 times as great as all the 
land surface of the earth. 
This, then, is the future which lies

## [Page 27](078246engo.pdf#page=27) 0

### 58461: The Challenge of the spaceship

before us, if our civilization survives 
the diseases of its childhood. lt is a 
future which some may find terrifiying, 
as no doubt our ancestors found the 
hostile emptiness of the great oceans. 
But the men who built our world cros- 
sed those oceans and overcame those 
fears. If we fail before the same test, 
our race will have begun its slide into 
decadence. 
When the great explorers of the past 
set sail into the unknown they said 
goodbye for years to their homes and 
everything they knew. Our children 
will face no such loneliness. When 
they are among the outermost planets, 
when the earth is lost in the glare of 
the sun and the sun itself is no more 
than the brightest of the stars, they 
will still be able to hear its voice and 
to send their own words in a few hours 
back to the world of men. 
The most obvious and direct result 
of the crossing of space will be a 
revolution in almost all branches of 
science. One can never predict the 
outcome of any scientific investigation 
and the greatest discoveries—the ones 
which will most influence human life— 
may come from sciences as yet 
unborn. 
Astronomy and physics will, of 
course, be the fields of knowledge 
most immediately affected. In both 
these sciences there are whole areas 
where research has come to a dead 
end, or has never even started, 
because our terrestrial environment 
makes it impossible. 
The atmosphere, which on a clear 
night looks so transparent, is in reality 
a coloured filter blocking all rays 
beyond the ultra-violet. 
An observatory on the moon, work- 
ing with quite small instruments, would 
be many times as effective as one 
on earth. Far greater magnifications 
could be employed, and far longer 
exposures used. In addition, the low 
gravity would make relatively simple 
the building of larger telescopes than 
have ever been constructed on this 
planet. 
+ In physics and chemistry, access to 
vacua of unlimited extent will open up 
quite new fields of investigation. The 
electronic scientist may well look for- 
ward to the day when he can build 
radio tubes a kilometre long, if he 
wishes, merely by setting up his elec- 
trodes in the open! We may learn 
more about gravity when we can 
escape partially or wholly from its 
influence. 
The prospect of building stations in 
space, circling the earth like tiny moons 
in orbits beyond the atmosphere, is 
one that has a peculiar fascination. 
Meteorological observatories in space 
could see at a glance the weather over 
half the planet, could watch in detail 
the movement of storms and rain 
areas. Indeed, really accurate fore: 
casting may have to wait until meteor- 
ologists get out into space. 
The space station has one other 
application of the greatest importance,

‘The moon's great potential for science can best be realized if investigations are conducted 
as an international enterprise and in an international laboratory. This idea gave rise 
‘to the Lunar International Laboratory Committee of the International Academy of Astro- 
 nautics. The committee came into being in August 1960 when the concept of a lunar 
~ international laboratory (LIL) was put forward at Stockholm during the 11th Congress of 
the International Astronautical Federation. As Dr. Frank J. Malina, Chairman of the 
~ LIL Committee, has stated: “Just about every branch of science will find the moon, 
with its unique environmental conditions—no atmosphere, a gravity only 1/6th that of 
the earth, very weak or non-existent magnetic field—a great laboratory for a host of 
experiments and observations essentially impossible to perform on earth.” The foundations 
for a Lunar International Laboratory may well have been laid on December 13, 1963 when 
the General Assembly of the United Nations unanimously declared: “The exploration ELL

CHALLENGE OF THE SPACESHIP (Continued) 
for it provides perhaps the only means 
of world-wide television broadcasting. 
Three relay stations circling the earth 
could provide a steady, reliable service 
from pole to pole with no more power 
output than that of a single present- 
day station. 
However, the first direct results of 
astronautics may be less important 
than its indirect consequences. This 
has proved true in the past of many 
great scientific achievements. Coper- 
nican astronomy, Darwin's theory of 
evolution, Freudian psychology—these 
had few immediate practical results, 
but their effect on human thought was 
tremendous. We may expect the same 
of astronautics. 
With the expansion of the world's 
mental horizons may come one of the 
greatest outbursts of creative activity 
ever known. The parallel with the 
Renaissance, with its great flowering 
of the arts and sciences, is very sug- 
gestive. Interplanetary travel is now 
the only form of “conquest and em- 
pire” compatible with civilization. 
Without it, the human mind, compelled 
to circle forever in its planetary gold- 
fish bowl, must eventually stagnate. 
We all know the narrow, limited type 
of mind which is interested in nothing 
beyond its town or village, and bases 
its judgments on parochial standards. 
We are slowly—perhaps too slowly— 
evolving from that mentality towards 
a world outlook. 
Few things will do more to accel- 
erate that evolution than the conquest 
of space. It is not easy to see how 
the more extreme forms of nationalism 
can long survive once men see the 
earth in its true perspective as a 
single small globe among the stars. 
T.c solar system is rather a 
large place, though whether it will be 
large enough for so quarrelsome an 
animal as Homo sapiens remains to be 
seen. But it is surely reasonable to 
hope that the crossing of space will 
have a considerable effect in reducing 
the psychological pressures and ten- 
sions of our present world. 
Much depends, of course, on the 
habitability of the other planets, It is 
not likely that very large populations 
will, at least for many centuries, be 
able to subsist outside the earth. 
There may be no worlds in the solar 
system upon which men can live 
without mechanical aids, and some of 
the greatest achievements of future 
engineering will be concerned with 
shaping hostile environments to human 
needs. 
-We must not, however, commit the 
too common mistake of equating mere 
physical expansion, or even increasing 
scientific knowledge, with “progress” 
—however that may be defined. Only 
little minds are impressed by sheer 
size and number. There would be no 
virtue in possessing the universe. if it 
brought neither wisdom nor happiness. 
Yet possess it we must, at least in 
spirit, if we are ever to answer the 
questions that men have asked in vain 
since history began. 
Every thoughtful man has asked him- 
self: is our race the only intelligence, 
or are there other, perhaps far higher, 
forms of life elsewhere? There can be 
few questions more important than this, 
for on its outcome may depend all 
philosophy—yes, and all religion too. 
The first discovery of planets revolv- 
ing round other suns, which was made 
in the United States in 1942, has 
changed all ideas of the plurality of 
worlds. Planets are far commoner 
than we had believed: there may be 
thousands of millions in the galaxy 
alone. Few men today would care to 
argue that the earth must be the only 
abode of life in the whole of space. 
It is true—it is even likely—that we 
may encounter no other intelligence in 
the solar system. That contact may 
have to wait for the day, perhaps ages 
hence, when we can reach the stars. 
But sooner or later it must come. 
{if the universe does hold species 
greatly in advance of our own, then 
why have they never visited the earth? 
There is one very simple answer to this 
question. Let us suppose that such 
races exist: let us even suppose that, 
never having heard of Einstein, they 
can pass from end to end of the galaxy 
as quickly as they wish... 
That will help them less than one 
might think. In 10 minutes, a man may 
walk along a beach—but in his whole 
lifetime he could not examine every 
grain of sand upon it. For all that we 
know, there may be fleets of survey 
ships diligently charting and recharting 
the universe. Even making the most 
optimistic assumptions, they could 
scarcely have visited our world in the 
few thousand years of recorded his- 
tory. 
The desire to give a comprehensive 
picture of the outcome of astronautics 
has compelled me to range—not 
unwillingly—over an enormous field. 
However, | do not wish anyone to 
think that the possibilities we have 
been discussing need come in this 
century, or the next, or the next. ... Yet 
any of them may arise, at any time, 
as soon as the first ships begin to 
leave the earth. Man's first contact 
with other intelligent races may lie as 
far away in time as the building of the 
Pyramids—or it may be as near as the 
discovery of X-rays. 
Of this, at least, we may be fairly 
certain: barring accidents—the most 
obvious of which | need not specify— 
the exploration of the planets will be 
in full swing as this century draws to 
its close. To examine them in any 
detail, and to exploit their possibilities 
fully, will take hundreds of years. But 
man being what he is, when his first 
ship circles down into the frozen 
wastes of Pluto, his mind will already 
be bridging the gulf still lying between 
him and the stars.

MY 
FIRST 
STEPS 
IN 
SPACE 
By Aleksei Leonov 
March 18, 1965 is a date that will 
be remembered in the history of 
astronautics. On that day, Aleksei 
Leonov became the first man to 
leave a space vehicle and walk in 
outer space. This article was 
specially written for the "Unesco 
Courier” by Aleksei Leonov him- 
self and published in our June 
1965 issue. 
1. the unforgettable mo- 
ments at the take-off and the recollec- 
tion of the long months of flight training 
forced me to believe in the reality 
of the scene that unfolded before my 
eyes as | viewed the spaceship while 
| floated through the vacuum of space. 
Voskhod Il sailed with an awesome 
majesty, its antennae—like the whis- 
kers of some monster—probing the 
emptiness of space. Its portholes 
looked like enormous eyes contemp- 
lating fixedly my every movement. 
Before me—blackness: an inky-black 
sky studded with stars that glowed 
but did not twinkle; they seemed immo- 
bilized. Nor did the sun look the same 
as when seen from Earth. It had no 
aureole or corona; it resembled a huge 
incandescent disc that seemed em- 
bedded in the velvet black of the sky 
of outer space. 
Below me our sky-blue planet drifted 
by. It did not look round but complete- 
ly flat, like a giant physical map. Only 
the curvature of the horizon showed 
that it was round. 
Four years ago my countryman Yuri 
Gagarin, spent only 108 minutes in 
space. Today manned spacecraft make 
flights lasting several days. 
In the future, space vehicles will be 
spending more and more time in orbit, 
and there will probably be several in 
flight at the same time. The number 
of crew members will also increase. 
Scientists are already studying the 
problem of setting up permanent 
stations in orbit. Man will naturally 
want to explore other planets. 
But if this is to be possible man 
must learn to assemble heavy space- 
craft directly in orbit. He must ke 
able to pick up the crews of orbiting 
space laboratories, move from one 
ship to another in cases of emergency

For this to be feasible, man had to 
learn to leave his spacecraft and find 
the best way of doing so. But the 
question arose—was it possible for 
man to leave a space vessel and sur- 
vive? Could he carry out the assembly 
work that is indispensable to the ren- 
dezvous of spacecraft?

### 58684: Vernacular languages in changing Africa

 
  
VERNACULAR 
LANGUAGES 
IN CHANGING 
AFRICA 
W. have become so used 
to talking about Africa's countless lan- 
guages that we have lost sight of the 
fact that Africa is, after all, a whole 
continent. A more than cursory exami- 
nation of the languages of this conti- 
nent reveals first, that the number has 
been vastly exaggerated, and second, 
that the situation is hardly different 
elsewhere. Europe possesses dozens 
of languages and dialects; and “Stan- 
dard African” is as much of a mis- 
nomer as “Universal European” would 
be. French and ltalian exist as separ- 
ate languages, so why not Swahili, 
Hausa and Yoruba? 
Despite the existence of local varia- 
tions, the number of linguistic zones 
in Africa is really quite small. Within 
each zone there is a linguistic unity 
which is not only historical but also 
a living fact. 
Let us take the case of the zone 
comprising the so-called Bantu lan- 
guages. Here we find not various 
distinct and separate languages but 
different dialects of the same language. 
The common features are so extensive 
that one can pass quite easily from 
one dialect to the other. 
In the Congo practically everyone 
is multilingual. In addition to their 
local dialects, the Lari, the Vili, the 
Bateke, the Bangala and the Kikongo 
all speak Lingala, Monokotuba or some 
other language. 
From the number of dialects the Vili 
of Pointe-Noire understand one might 
assume that they have a special apti- 
tude for foreign languages. A Vili, for 
example, can easily understand or get 
along in Lari, Teke, Swahili and Chilu- 
ba. This is simply explained by the 
fact that they are all dialectal! varia- 
tions of one and the same language. 
The slight differences in these dialects 
is evident from the following renditions 
for the word TO EAT: KULIA in Vili; 
PATHE DIAGNE of Senegal is a specialist in 
linguistics and African history and sociology. 
by Pathé Diagne 
KUDIA in Kikongo; KUDIA in Lari; 
KOLIA in Lingala; KULIA in Swahili. 
As can be seen, the differences are 
merely a matter of one consonant or 
vowel, and serve to illustrate the idea 
that the whole Bantu linguistic zone 
could today be unified around one of 
these dialects. This unification would 
affect some 100 million persons. 
What is true of the Bantu linguistic 
zone also applies to other parts of 
Africa. In the Sudanese belt of coun- 
tries stretching across Africa just 
below the Sahara, the same pheno- 
menon can be observed with regard 
to Hausa, the Mandingo language 
group (Bambara, Dioula, Malinke), the 
Akan Baoule languages of Ghana and 
the Ivory Coast, and the Fulani (or 
Pular) languages. 
All over the world a process of 
linguistic unification is now under way. 
In Africa the same thing is happening. 
Differences in speech are being worn 
down, and are giving way to a limited 
number of major languages of commu- 
nication. This is occurring as a result 
of various factors. Urbanization, the 
culturalsrenascence and the develop- 
ment of great trading centres have 
enabled a few languages to unify whole 
areas. 
This has completely transformed the 
linguistic map of tropical Africa so that 
many of the splinter dialects of the 
past are now being absorbed by about 
a dozen dynamic, hard-core languages 
today spreading across the continent. 
Most of these languages are now 
used by groups of 1 million to 12 mil- 
lion persons. But some are spoken 
by over 50 million people. For exam- 
ple, there is the Bantu group, spoken 
by 100 million people; Swahili, spoken 
by over 50 million persons in most of 
East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, 
Zambia and the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo); the Lingala-Kikongo- 
Monokotuba language family, spoken 
by about 30 million persons over most 
of Central Africa (Central African Re-

public, Congo-Brazzaville, Cameroon 
as well as the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo). 
The establishment of a common 
language for those who speak Swahili, 
Lingala-Kikongo-Monokotuba, or even 
Shango and certain Bantu dialects of 
South Africa and the Cameroon, is 
a task that could well be accomplished 
within the reasonable future. 
The languages of West Africa are 
more varied. Here, Hausa, spoken by 
some 40 million people in Nigeria, 
Niger and Chad, could become a 
unifying element for a vast area of 
Africa. 
Yoruba (Nigeria), Malinke - Dioula 
(Eastern Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta, 
Ivory Coast, Niger), Fulani (Senegal, 
Mali, Guinea, Upper Volta, Niger, 
Nigeria), and Arabic are all linguistic 
groups spoken by from 10 to 15 mil- 
lion people. 
Tamashek (Mauritania, Mali, Niger), 
Ibo (Nigeria), Akan-Baoule-Bulu-Fang 
(Ghana, Ivory Coast), Fon-Ewe-Mina 
{Togo, Dahomey, Ghana), More (Upper 
Volta), Wolof (Senegal), Sarakhule 
(Mali, Mauritania, Senegal), Kanuri 
{Nigeria, Niger, Chad), and Djerma- 
Songhoi (Mali, Niger) also form lin- 
guistic areas in process of unification 
and are spoken by 1 to 5 million 
people. 
Thus we see that a veritable pyra- 
mid of languages eXists in West Africa, 
with several languages spoken in the 
same country—in Nigeria, for instance, 
Hausa, Ibo, Yoruba and Kanuri are all 
spoken. 
But it is clear that language unifica- 
tion, not dispersal, is the dominant 
factor in Africa today. 
Efforts to try to adapt African lan- 
guages to modern change have been 
in progress for many many years. 
These were given new impetus with 
the establishment of institutions of 
European origin. 
In 1820, a French schoolteacher set 
up West Africa's first secular, bilingual 
school at St. Louis, Senegal, where 
both Wolof and French were taught. 
This pioneer attempt was followed by 
the missionaries who first used African 
languages to spread the Gospel and 
then gradually introduced them for the 
teaching of a few new techniques in 
agriculture and the crafts. 
The bilingual school in the Congo 
was the outcome of this development. 
In the countries under British rule, a 
similar approach, based on the prin- 
ciple of “native administration”, helped 
the spread of African languages. The 
status and influence of these lan- 
guages can be observed today in the 
Democratic Republic of the Co.go, 
Uganda and Tanzania. These countr- 
ies, with a literacy rate of 45 per cent, 
have been able to establish an excell- 
ent political, social and technical infra- 
structure by using African languages 
for newspapers, school books and 
other publications. 
The interesting features here are 
the new possibilities thus opened. 
The development of a script in Swahili 
hastened the stabilization of the lan- 
guage and its literary growth which 
had begun long before colonization, 
as attested by the Kilwa dating from 
the 17th century as well as an abun- 
dance of other great works of great 
antiquity. 
This is equally true of other African 
languages, particularly those of West 
Africa, where Fulani and Wolof litera- 
ture, Hausa works (those by Dan Fodio 
are an outstanding example) and the 
writings of the Kanuri and Dendi chro- 
niclers bear comparison with Swahili. 
Other languages like Lingala or Chi- 
luba are entering the writing stage, 
thanks chiefly to contemporary efforts. 
[| adaptation of African 
languages to modern change is not yet 
very far advanced. In this sense most 
of them have not yet become languages 
of advanced scientific knowledge or 
vehicles of modern literature, reflect- 
ing either in original creative works or 
translations from non-African lan- 
guages, the intellectual ferment of con- 
temporary thought. 
Although many attempts have been 
made along these lines, they are 
mainly isolated cases. Nevertheless, a 
number of notable examples by out- 
standing African thinkers can be cited. 
The Senegalese writer, C. Anta Diop, 
has played a pioneer réle here, The 
second part of his Nations Négres 
contains a series of chapters which 
illustrate how Wolof can be adapted 
to modern scientific writing. Anta 
Diop chose literary as well as scientific 
themes and produced translations in 
his native tongue of extraordinary 
precision and clarity. His rendering 
into Wolof of Einstein's Theory of Rel- 
  
ativity as interpreted and explained by 
the French scientist Langevin, is su- 
perb. 
He also offers us translations of 
poems and excerpts of plays from 
French literature that retain all the 
exquisite beauty of the original. The 
terminology of modern mathematics 
and physics which he uses opens the 
way for elaboration of a modern scien- 
tific culture in the Wolof language. 
Wolof, it is true, is a language with 
a long literary tradition. C. Anta Diop 
makes this abundantly clear in his book 
with a judicious choice of texts. Nev- 
ertheless what he has done for Wolof 
can be done for any language, African 
or not. Even more recently, the Presi- 
dent of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, dem- 
onstrated the vitality of African lan- 
guages by his series of literary works, 
including a translation of Shake- 
speare's Julius Caesar. 
For all languages there is a problem 
of adaptation, but not of adaptability. 
Linguists know that no language lacks 
the ability to mould itself to a new 
environment. Every language has its 
own built-in system that meets the 
needs of its people. The integration 
of new knowledge is a matter of voca- 
bulary; it does not affect the system, 
which is the structure of the language 
on which the vocabulary rests. 
Moreover, the need for adaptation 
is not a problem exclusive to the lan- 
guages of Africa. It is world-wide. 
Japan established its economic and 
scientific force by assimilating modern 
skills and knowledge into its own 
language, and by introducing new tech- 
niques into its culture to which it gave 
Japanese words or transliterated the 
original foreign ones. 
No language escapes this process. 
Why is there a “Franglais® or a 
“Japenglish” if not because English has

A remarkable example of the development of written language is that of an African 
ruler, King Njoya of the Bi mum (Cameroons) who invented a form of picture writing 
at the end of the 19th century and within a few years transformed it into a syllabic, 
phonetic alphabet, independently and without previous knowledge of alphabetic 
scripts. After devising his writing system, King Njoya launched a large-scale campaign 
to teach the alphabet to his people. Examples above show how reforms and simplification 
during 11 years gave the Bamum script a more systematic form.

become the leading language of the 
world as a result of the contribution of 
American science and technology? 
The best answer to the question 
regarding the adaptability of African 
languages to modern change is to 
remind ourselves how easily modern 
techniques are being assimilated into 
African languages. It is a truism that 
people do not accept all foreign words 
indiscriminately. Train, ship, television, 
mathematics, drugs—in a word all the 
elements of the new environment are 
spontaneously translated, especially 
by the women who often find graphic, 
picturesque equivalents for them. 
In Wolof, for example, the word for 
train is saxar, for mathematics wann, 
for drugs garab, all terms drawn from 
the language itself. For words like 
television, radar or atom, common- 
sense operates in Africa as it has in 
Japan, Germany or India, and the same 
words are incorporated into the lan- 
guage with minor modifications or 
none at all. 
Today the great problem in Africa 
is that of translation. School books 
from the primary to the university level 
must be translated to make them 
available to students. This will faci- 
litate the broad diffusion of science 
and technology in Africa. It is easier, 
cheaper and will reach more people. 
A nation's linguistic policy is 
not decided by the individual. The indi- 
vidual can make known his suggestions, 
his desires and his needs; but the final 
word rests with the State. Specialists 
agree that the use of the vernacular 
for literacy campaigns and schooling 
is certainly the best way to show one's 
regard for the culture and traditions of 
a people, and the most effective for 
making the language the vehicle of 
modern change; but the politician does 
not always see things the same way 
as the specialist. 
However, an increasing number of 
countries are exhibiting a refreshing 
degree of understanding in this matter, 
and this is encouraging. In addition 
to those countries of Africa that have 
traditionally practiced bilingualism bas- 
ed on the use of both an African lan- 
guage and a European one—such as 
Nigeria, Ghana, the Democratic Re- 
public of the Congo, Tanzania and 
Uganda—others like Niger, Guinea 
and Mali have shown new interest in 
the question. 
Unesco's programme in Africa which 
gives priority to the question of African 
languages, shows that Unesco is 
keenly aware of this problem and its 
effect on the continent's educational 
and development policy. 
Many details have as yet to be 
worked out in agreement with Unesco’s 
African member countries; but the 
proposals elaborated at the Unesco- 
sponsored Congress of Bamako in 
1965 for unification of certain African 
scripts is a step in the right direction.

containers. 
The sea water, however, will very 
quickly eat through the walls of these 
containers and dissolve their danger- 
ous contents. If scores, or hundreds, 
of containers with their “sinister con- 
tents are being thrown into the sea 
today, the number will rise to tens or 
hundreds of thousands in the future. 
There are deep places or trenches in 
the oceans, particularly the Pacific. 
The average depth of the ocean is 
about two and a half miles, but in 
these depressions it reaches between 
four and five miles and in places up 
to seven miles. Proposals are being 
made to use these depressions 
as dumping-grounds for radioactive 
wastes. 
Some wastes in the.

How long will i radioactive 
substances dissolv he water at 
the ocean bottom to rise to the sur- 
face? Will the process of radioactive 
decay which is always at work render 
them innocuous before they reach the - 
surface, or will they still be sufficiently 
radioactive to poison the upper, pro- 
ductive layers? 
S cenmists hold widely 
differing views as to the time required 
for the water of the ocean bottom to 
be renewed. Georg Wist (Fed. Rep. 
of Germany) has calculated that the 
cold, heavy Antarctic waters, after des- 
cending to the depths, reach the 
equator in five years four months, 
while G.E.R. Deacon (Britain) puts the 
figure at eighteen years. E.B. Worth- 
ington (United States) holds that the 
waters at the bottom of the Atlantic 
date back to 1810 when the .climate 
became much colder, and have not 
been renewed in ‘the century and a 
half that has elapsed since then.

Brodie and Burling, have put the age

In the name of progress, Man has opened a

planet. We have been dumping waste into rivers 
and lakes, fouling the air we breathe, damaging the 
soil, and assailing each other with noise, that 
by-product of technological clvilization which increases 
nervous strain, deafness and other mental and physical 
disorders {photo below). A new noise, the boom of 
the supersonic jetliner, will soon be added. Map,

Campbell Island at a depth of 2,624 feet 
at 1,900 years. The New Zealanders 
used the Carbon 14 method to deter- 
mine the age of the water, but others 
hold that there are a number of factors 
besides time affecting Carbon 14, and 
accordingly that these conclusions 
must be accepted with caution. 
The Danish expedition on the Galatea 
and Soviet expeditions on the Vityaz 
found dissolved oxygen in water from 
the very deepest Pacific trenches. 
Water buried at the bottom of the 
ocean for hundred of years, let-alone 
thousands, could contain no oxygen. 
It would be consumed in a much 
shorter time by various processes, 
both physico-chemical (the oxidation of 
mineral substances) and biochemical 
(the respiration of living organisms 
and the putrefaction of dead ones)— 
processes that are constantly at work 
at the bottom of the ocean and in the 
water above. 
The. Danish and Soviet expeditions

supply in the water round them if 
there were no currents. 
The water in the ocean is not homo- 
geneous; its temperature varies both 
vertically and horizontally. What is 
more, the water in the ocean is contin- 
ually in motion, neighbouring layers 
often moving in different directions. 
In this way water of different temper- 
atures is being constantly mixed and 
is sinking as it becomes heavier. An 
equivalent volume of lighter water is 
displaced and rises to the surface. 
This eternal process extends to all 
the depths of the ocean, apparently 
penetrating to the bottom of the 
trenches. 
We do not know as yet how long it 
takes surface water to descend to the 
ocean bottom, but evidently its move- 
ment is relatively rapid since it retains 
dissolved oxygen. 
Among the many depressions studied 
by this year's Soviet expedition on the 
Vityaz was the Tonga trench, investigat- 
ed six years ago by the Danish expedi- 
tion on the Galatea. Measurements 
made this year gave a difference of 
0.20 in the temperature of the water.

one realizes that this is a significant 
deviation indicating the existence of 
what is probably a very slow but 
continuous exchange of water between 
the bottom, intermediate, and surface 
layers. of the ocean, even in the regions 
of the deepest depressions. 
] HE vertical circulation ven- 
tilates the deep layers of the ocean 
and also raises to the surface a layer 
rich in nutrient phosphates and nitra- 
tes, forming a basis for abundant: life. 
But this process will bring death if 
pernicious radioactive solutions from 
the wasteproducts of the atomic indus- 
try accumulate in the ocean depths. 
There is another phenomepon occur- 
ing in the oceans and seas known as 
upwelling. Due to winds, currents or 
the relief of the ocean bed, deep, cold 
layers of water, rich in nutrient salts, 
rise to the surface in some regions 
along the continental slope or along 
submerged banks. This occurs regu- 
larly along the Atlantic coast of North 
America, the California coast and the 
western coast of South America and 
Africa. The regions where upwelling 
occurs are exceptionally rich in plant 
and animal life, including fish. If the 
water rising to the surface should be 
contaminated with substances dis- 
solved from radioactive wastes it will 
mean the end of the highly productive 
fisheries in these regions. 
The oceans and seas are joined to 
form an indivisible whole—the World 
Ocean. No open part can be con- 
sidered isolated and cannot belong to 
any one country. Radioactive sub- 
stances introduced into the ocean at 
any spot will be dispersed for 
thousands of miles and will con- 
taminate an area of millions of square 
miles. 
For that reason, all questions con- 
cerning the contamination of the ocean 
by radioactive substances, irrespective 
of their origin or purpose, acquire 
international significance and should be 
solved through friendly, concerted 
international scientific co-operation. 
The rate at which the atomic indus- 
try is developing shows that it is 
necessary to set about the study of 
this problem immediately. Uncon- 
trolled contamination of the oceans and 
seas can lead to irreparable catas- 
trophe within ten to twenty years. The 
Ocean, that great and inexhaustible 
source of food for man, is in danger.

700 MILLION 
FORGOTTEN MINDS 
by René Maheu 
Director-General of Unesco 
A. estimated 700 million 
adults—or more than two-fifths of the 
world’s total population—are illiterate. 
And it is in the less developed regions 
that most of these adult illiterates live. 
As for children (5 to 15 years), 47 
per cent did not attend school during 
1960 in the countries of Latin America, 
Africa, the Middle East and Asia. If 
we add to this figure those children 
who are going to school now but who 
will drop out before they master read- 
ing and writing and hence will grow 
up illiterate, there are today 150 million 
future illiterates in these countries and 
there will be an additional 20 to 
25 million illiterates added to the 
world's adult population in the next 
6 or 7 years. 
What a frightful loss of mindpower 
these hundreds of millions of illiterates 
represent. Who can say how many 
scientists, engineers and technicians 
potentially existed among all these 
forsaken adults as well as the children 
consigned from birth to the shadows 
of ignorance? 
An illiterate person never ceases 
to be a human being endowed with 
his own natural dignity and ability. 
Nevertheless, illiteracy by the very fact 
that it makes science and technology 
a closed book renders active partici- 
pation in modern civilization im- 
possible. 
A country with a high percentage of 
illiterates does not only suffer an in- 
trinsic loss in terms of wasted man 
and mindpower; the progress of the 
educated segment of the population 
is equally slowed down. We can no 
longer afford to have, as we unfortu- 
nately do in many of the developing 
countries, an enormous gulf separating 
one group or generation from another, 
that is, those who have had a modern 
education from those who are illiterate. 
This disrupts the equilibrium and 
unity of a country and completely de- 
feats any effort to create a nation- 
wide positive attitude toward scientific 
thinking and technology without which 
there can be no real development. 
Probably the greatest need for ex- 
pansion and improvement lies in the 
field of technical and vocational edu- 
cation, particularly at the secondary 
school level. 
Here Unesco has devoted consider- 
able effort in recent years to helping 
the developing countries in two differ- 
ent ways: by working on international 
standards for technical education, and 
by direct aid in the field. 
As for the réle of universities in 
training senior scientific and technical 
personnel, in certain countries the 
problem is chiefly one of quantity. 
Here the key word is shortage: a 
shortage of universities, a shortage 
of instructors and professors, a short- 
age of equipment, mainly laboratory 
equipment, even a shortage at times 
of adequately prepared students 
arising from the inadequacies of 
secondary education. 
In other countries higher education 
is poorly adapted to the needs of a 
technology. modern economy and

Thus most of the university students 
in these countries prepare for degrees 
in traditional subjects; and those who 
do major in science and technology 
often do so by chance or for personal 
reasons that have little to do with 
the real top-priority problems of 
economic and social development in 
their country. 
The evil of underdevelopment must 
be attacked at its very root by creating 
national structures for training qualified 
personnel where they do not exist and 
strengthening and improving them 
where they do. 
If a country is to build a sound foun- 
dation for its technological develop- 
ment science must be taught in the

is such that people of all ages use every 
opportunity to read and study. Right, an

schools at every level. The real basis 
for development is a scientific civiliza- 
tion. 
Merely importing techniques will 
not itself equip the underdeveloped 
countries for the full utilization of their 
natural and human resources to 
achieve their transformation. 
Tene are many things 
wrong with science teaching in the 
developing countries. There is often 
a terrible shortage of laboratory equip- 
ment for schools and universities. 
In many cases, curricula are ill- 
conceived, textbooks and teachers’ 
handbooks are not suited to local 
conditions, and the training of teachers 
leaves much to be desired. 
In all these spheres, Unesco is 
helping to promote and support the 
efforts of its member states. Far 
greater resources must be marshalled 
by international aid for this vital 
contribution to progress. 
| do not believe that the educational 
system, with its present organization 
and methods, can meet the demands 
of the growth of our civilization in the 
developed countries, let alone those 
in the developing areas. 
Education cannot make its full and 
decisive contribution to the technolo- 
gical revolution which must take place 
in the less developed countries unless 
it itself drastically overhauls its own 
technology, which in many respects is 
out of date. 
We all know what a long and costly 
process the training of teachers is at 
no matter what level. There can be 
no question of economizing in this vital 
field. But experience has shown that 
for certain duties, assistants with. far 
less advanced training are quite 
adequate. The savings made in this 
way would be quite considerable. 
Even the machines now being tried 
out for programmed instruction reduce 
the need for personal coaching by 
the teacher. 
The cinema, radio and television— 
not to overlook filmstrips and the gra- 
mophone—have demonstrated over 
and over again how potent they are 
as means of conveying ideas, impart- 
ing knowledge, and expressing emo-

tions and passions, too. Educators 
should learn what the professional 
entertainers and political propagandists 
have already found out in other fields: 
that these media can play an enormous 
role in advancing education in the 
developing countries. 
It is not in schools or universities 
that the renewal or extension of 
scientific education and technical 
training must be effected. It must 
take place wherever the main part of 
an adult's life is spent—at work and 
during leisure hours. 
Places of work are ideal centres for 
specialized scientific and technical 
education on a continuing basis. 
Industry is becoming increasingly 
aware of this educational responsibility 
which it bears. This is a task on a 
scale commensurate with modern 
society as a whole. 
Major industrial and commercial 
concerns are bound to assume more 
and more the character of specialized 
training establishments supplementing 
the work of schools and universities. 
The university, far from ignoring or 
vying with them, should keep in close 
touch in order to stimulate and guide 
them, for they are its natural extension, 
The considerable amount of leisure 
made available by industrialization is 
being increasingly taken over by the 
mass communication media. It is from 
these media that the vast majority 
of adults and even a proportion of 
those at school and university derive 
the bulk of what | would term their 
scientific and technical culture. 
The diversity of situations which 
distinguish the less-developed coun- 
tries from the industrialized ones 
calls for different approaches to the 
problems of development. But there 
are no ways and means too novel 
or modern for the less developed 
countries in applying the solutions 
adopted for those problems. This is 
why the training of scientific and 
technical personnel is so urgent a 
necessity for them. For on this 
personnel depends whether or not 
they are to play a real part on the 
contemporary scene.

### 58691: Avicenna

38 
AVICENNA 
by Camille Aboussouan 
Arouno the year 1150, at 
the height of the Middle Ages, the 
scientific and philosophical works of 
a great Persian thinker, named Avi- 
cenna, reached western Europe, in- 
troducing for the first time a complete, 
organized system of natural philosophy 
directly from the Orient. 
This Persian scholar gave the world 
a vast body of works—335 in all— 
dealing more with science than with 
philosophy alone, which was to have 
a resounding impact on the develop- 
ment of knowledge in the Western 
World. For some 600 years, up until 
the 18th century, Avicenna's works on 
medicine remained the standard text- 
books in all the universities of Europe. 
His studies on mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, astronomy and botany, his 
treatises on military administration 
and land taxation, his epistle on love, 
his correspondence with other scien- 
tists of his time, his philosophical, legal 
and linguistic essays, and even his 
commentaries on magic, all entitle him 
to be considered as one of the most 
remarkable figures of world civilization. 
A thousand lunar years ago, in the 
year 370 of the Hegira (980 A.D), 
Abu Ali a! Husain ibn Abdallah ibn 
Sina, known as Avicenna, was born at 
Afsana, not far from Bokhara in Persia. 
The special care and education given 
him as a child permitted him to acquire 
an erudition rare for his time. Though 
Persian, he wrote many of his works 
in Arabic, the scientific and religious 
language of the Islamic world as Latin 
then was in the Christian West. In his 
native Persian he wrote several books 
of verse, a treatise on pulsation and 
a major work on the principles of 
science, the Danesh-Nameh (1). 
What we know about his life has 
come down to us from Avicenna's own 
writing, supplemented by those of his 
disciple, Al lJuzjani, and commentaries 
of other writers. 
Like all good Muslims, Avicenna 
first studied the Koran; then Arabic 
literature, Greek philosophy, law, theo- 
logy, medicine, geometry, physics and 
mathematics. Euclid, Ptolemy and 
Porphyrius were his preferred authors 
until he was 16 when, more learned 
than any of his teachers, he founded 
his own school and had many doctors 
working under him. 
At the age of 18, his encyclopaedic 
knowledge and reputation as a doctor 
were so great that the ailing Emir 
had him summoned to his bedside. 
When Avicenna succeeded in curing 
him, the Emir rewarded him by making

Middle East. He is now secretary of the 
Lebanese National Commission for Unesco. 
him a consultant on state affairs and 
gave him access to his rich, private 
library where he had plenty of free 
time for research and study. 
When he was 21, Avicenna pub- 
lished his first book, Al Majmuh, a 
collection of philosophical writings. At 
that time he became deeply interest- 
ed in politics and left Bokhara to estab- 
lish himself in different courts of the 
Emirs of northern Persia and the Cas- 
pian shore. [t was in northern Per- 
sia that he began writing the Qanun 
or “Canon of Medicine”, and his first 
epistles. 
He then left for Rai (the ruins of 
which can still be seen not far from 
Teheran) where he attended the sick 
prince Majd ad Dawla, and then for 
Hamadan where he cured the Emir and 
was named Vizier. There, Avicenna 
dealt with state affairs during the day 
and worked on his own studies at 
night. 
Some of his greatest works date 
from this period: the Al-Shifa (On 
Healing) and especially the Qanun fi- 
t-tibb, his masterly work on medi- 
cine which was to become the “bible” 
of all doctors in the East and West for 
centuries. In this latter work Avicenna 
showed that the real act of seeing 
begins at the retina not the crystalline 
lens as was commonly believed, cor- 
rectly defined meningitis as an inflam- 
mation of the brain membrane, recog- 
nized the various types of jaundice, 
postulated the theory of the transmis- 
sion of certain diseases via the pla- 
centa, first proposed tracheotemy sur- 
gery, etc. 
At the death of the Emir of Hama- 
dan, his enemies imprisoned Avicenna 
in the fortress of Ferdajan. This en- 
forced retirement gave him leisure to 
work in peace. But it did not last 
very long. On his return to Hamadan, 
where he no longer felt safe, he made 
plans to flee to Isfahan with the aid 
of his trusted companion Al Juzjani. 
They slipped out of town disguised as 
Sufis and after a 13 month journey 
through hostile lands reached Isfahan 
where they were received in honour 
by the Emir Alal Addin. 
Avicenna completed the Al-Shifa in 
Isfahan, but this being a very lengthy 
work, he made a summary of it (start- 
ed earlier) which is now famous as the 
Al Nadjat. 
Avicenna's thinking until this time 
had been strongly influenced by Aris- 
totle, and these two books are no 
exception. But during the later years 
of his life, his work and thinking were 
marked by a profound change. 
This is clearly evident in his Kitab 
al-lsarat wal-tanbihat, or “Book of 
Theorems,” the last of his warks to 
come down to us complete (2). The 
Book of Theorems is the culmination 
of Avicenna's thought. In it we see 
the marked influence of Iranian scien- 
tific thinking, the development of his 
rationalist (as opposed to mystico- 
religious) thought. 
Five hundred years before Harvey, 
Bacon and the Renaissance, Avicenna 
established a system of natural phil- 
osophy, neither Greek nor Persian, 
but based on scientific experiment. 
A universalist and rationalist, he com- 
bined in his works Greek and Oriental 
philosophies and Iranian science, ex- 
pressed in an Arabic literary style and 
sense of composition rarely attained. 
The great philosopher and scientist 
died at the age of 57 in Isfahan, the 
city of roses, after freeing his slaves 
and bequeathing all his property and 
belongings to the poor.

Donne the Second World 
War there were some great bombing 
raids on German cities. In one such 
raid, on one night, one thousand aero- 
planes each carrying four tremendous 
one-ton blockbusters destroyed much 
of the city of Hamburg and killed an 
estimated 75,000 people. If there were 
to be such a raid on, say, Paris today 
and another such 1,000 plane raid 
tomorrow, and then another the next 
day and so on day after day for 
fourteen years, 
livered would have the power of one 
20-megaton bomb. 
Now, one 20-megaton bomb test in 
the atmosphere or at the surface of 
the earth liberates radioactive materials 
into the atmosphere which will, accord- 
ing to the best estimates that we can 
make, cause gross damage or death to 
550,000 unborn children. This is the 
probable sacrifice of the testing of a 
single H-bomb by any one nation. 
Everyone must understand this. 
If the human race survives and world 
population continues at a reasonable 
level, then | have calculated that the 
bomb tests carried out thus far, and 
amounting to 600 megatons, will in the 
course of time affect sixteen million 
children so severely that they will 
suffer gross physical or mental defects 
or embryonic, neonatal, or childhood 
deaths. 
We know that large amounts of high 
energy radiation produce cancer. If 
we accept the principle that high 
energy radiation even in small amounts 
is also cancerogenic—as | believe it 
is—then it is possible to calculate the 
sacrifice of human beings now living to 
the bomb tests.

energy radiation liberated in the bomb 
tests carried out so far. This is about 
one person in fifteen hundred in the 
world, and it gives us some idea of the 
nature of atomic weapons in so far as 
the tests go. 
Of course there would be a tremen- 
dously greater amount of contamination 
with radioactive materials all over the 
earth if there were to be a nuclear war. 
In addition to the destructive and lethal 
effects of blast, fire, and immediate 
high energy radiation, there would be 
the effects of local fall-out.

### 58694: Nuclear weapons and world sanity

NUCLEAR WEAPONS (Continued) 
first two stages of a 100-megaton 
bomb. A 100-megaton bomb involves 
only about three and a half tons of 
explosive material and probably can be 
carried in a single large rocket from 
one continent to another. But 100- 
megaton bombs don’t make very much 
sense because a 20-megaton bomb 
can destroy any city on earth. 
A 20-megaton bomb exploded over 
any city on earth would destroy it 
completely and kill most of the people 
in it. It would produce a crater of 
twenty kilometres in diameter; it would 
set off fires 50 to 100 kilometres away, 
producing a tremendous fire storm and 
would damage people by the immediate 
high energy radiation and by the radio- 
active fallout. Even people 300 kilo- 
metres away would be killed. 
My estimate is that the stockpiles 
of the world comprise about 16,000 of 
these 20-megaton bombs or the equi- 
valent of them. Now, there aren't 
16,000 large cities in the world and 
one might well ask why this irrationally 
great amount of explosive material has 
been produced. 
| shall answer this by saying that it is 
because the system of science edu- 
cation has been faulty in the past so 
that the people who were making the 
decisions could not have had a clear 
understanding of what they were doing 
—if indeed anyone did make the deci- 
sions, for there has been some doubt 
as to whether the development of these 
tremendously great stockpiles was the 
result of decision-making rather than 
some sort of accident and shifting of 
responsibility primarily in the United 
States and the Soviet Union and per- 
haps in Great Britain to some extent. 
And yet in the Franck Report written 
by scientists working on the atomic 
bomb project in the U.S. in 1945, a 
prediction was made of the future 
nuclear situation in the world which has 
turned out to correct up to the present 
time. 
Three hundred and twenty thousand 
megatons is my estimate of the size of 
the world's present nuclear stockpiles. 
If ten per cent of the stockpiles (32,000 
megatons) were to be used in a nuclear 
war with the bombs exploded on the 
average within a hundred and fifty 
kilometres of the targets (you don't 
have to hit the target in order to get 
the result) then 60 days after the day 
on which the war was fought—and we 
assume that it would cover Europe as a 
whole, all the Soviet Union and the 
United States—of the 800 million 
people living in these regions, 720 
million would be dead, 60 million 
severely injured, and there would 
be 20 million survivors with only minor 
injuries. 
But these survivors would have to 
cope with the problems of complete 
destruction of all cities, metropolitan 
districts, and means of communication 
and transportation, complete disruption 
of society, death of all livestock, and 
gross radioactive contamination of all 
growing foods. This would be the 
end of this part of the world, and how 
great the damage would be to the rest

small bomb tests.

according to an estimate made in 1964. Since then the figure has considerably increased. Expenditure on arms is 
equivalent to about one-tenth of the world's annual output of goods and services. It represents at least 
two-thirds of the entire national income of all the developing countries. It Is close to the value of the world’s

Popular ignorance has given the atom a bad name. To the vast 
majority, atomic energy means horrendous explosions and the 
frightful weapons that could wipe out civilization. Atomic 
science was wholly unknown to most persons when the first 
atomic bomb was exploded and so it burst on mankind as an 
unforgettable shock. 
Yet this military use of the new knowledge is only one aspect. 
To ignore the entire science of atomic energy, with all its possib- 
ilities for the good of mankind is like closing one’s mind to all 
aviation because, during the war, aviation provided the merciless 
bomber. There is no attitude of horror today toward the 
aeroplane. So too there is a world of benefit in the medical, 
industrial and agricultural uses of the atom. 
As the great explorers mapped the earth, and the astronomers 
chart the sky, so the atomic scientist, delving into matter and 
energy, has discovered an unknown world that is a revelation 
for philosophers and a vast resource for future generations.

### 58694: Nuclear weapons and world sanity

NUCLEAR WEAPONS (Continued) 
450 megatons or three-quarters of the 
total were tested in the last three years. 
Millions of unborn children were sacri- 
ficed because of the inability to see 
that the test ban solution could have 
been accepted three years earlier. | 
hope that further mistakes of this sort 
are not made. | am grateful for the 
bomb test treaty,” but of course we 
must move forward. The test ban 
treaty is just the beginning. 
[ should like to see some action 
taken in the meantime that would 
decrease the chance of outbreak of a 
devastating nuclear war, perhaps 
through some psychological or techno- 
logical accident or through some com- 
bination of circumstances such that 
even the wisest of national leaders 
could not prevent catastrophe. 
In my Nobel lecture in Oslo in 
December 1963 [delivered on the occa- 
sion of the award to Prof. Pauling of 
the Nobel Prize for Peace] | proposed 
that the American stockpile of nuclear 
weapons and the Soviet stockpile of 
nuclear weapons should, separately, be 
put under joint national and interna- 
tional control, so that the Soviet 
nuclear weapons could not be used 
except with the permission both of the 
Soviet Premier and of the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations, and that 
the American nuclear weapons could 
not be used except by permission both 
of the President of the United States 
and of the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations. 
| also proposed that there should be 
in authority in the control stations in 
both . countries, United Nations per- 
sonnel as well as Soviet personnel in 
the U.S.S.R. on the one hand and 
U.N. personnel as well as American 
personnel in the U.S.A. on the other. 
| believe that even a first step in this 
“direction, the step of having United 
Nations observers in these control 
stations, would be of much value in 
increasing our security and decreasing 
the chance that these weapons would 
be used. 
look forward to the time 
when there is in existence in the world 
a satisfactory system of international 
law taking the place of war. In working 
to abolish war from the world we are 
working also for human freedom, for 
the rights of individual human beings. 
It is war, militarism, and extreme 
nationalism that are the great enemies 
of the individual human being in every 
country. | believe that as we achieve 
the goal of peace in the world and 
disarmament, we shall see 
improvement in the social, political 
and economic systems of all nations 
and in the rights of individual human 
beings all over the world. 
The idea of replacing war by world 
law is an old one and it has continued 
to be advanced up to the present time. 
Only now has the time come when it 
will be accepted.

### 58695: Of ants and men

OF ANTS 
AND MEN 
by Sir James Gray 
M. position in the world 
of Nature is brought most sharply into 
focus by the concept of natural evolu- 
tion. Cosmic, biological and human 
evolution can be regarded as phases 
in a continuous natural process—and, 
from this point of view, astronomy, 
geology, biology, archaeology and 
history form a continuous spectrum of 
knowledge. To pass through many mil- 
lions of years from a primaeval nebula 
to modern man without any sudden 
break in continuity of thought gives a 
feeling of intellectual tidiness, but quite 
apart from this it enables us to vis- 
ualize Man against the background 
of his past and to regard him as 
Nature's supreme masterpiece. At the 
same time, he must not get too big 
for his biological boots or tend to 
exaggerate the gap between himself 
and the rest of the animal kingdom. 
No animal can manufacture aero- 
planes, or Asdic; but the prize for 
aeronautics must go to the shear- 
water which navigated the Atlantic 
without compass or chart, that for 
Asdic to the ears and vocal cords of 
our nearer relatives, the bats. By 
surrounding themselves with an elec- 
tric field, some fish (e.g. Gymnarchus) 
can, in total darkness, detect foreign 
objects in the surrounding water with 
very remarkable ‘precision. 
The total weight of the mechanism 
involved—including the animal's brain 
—amounts only to a: few grammes; 
a man-made instrument of comparable 
performance would involve at least a 
ton of highly complex electronic ma- 
chinery. Again, there is no labora- 
tory in the world which can compete 
with the biochemical skill of even the 
smallest living organism. 
In fact, as delicate and precise 
pieces of machinery, Man's inventions 
so far compare very unfavourably with 
those which have come into existence 
during the natural course of biological 
evolution. On the other hand, we may 
fairly claim that we have accomplished 
in a few centuries things for which 
Nature required many millions of years. 
  
SIR JAMES GRAY Is former president of the 
British Assoclation for the Advancement of 
Science. 
Nevertheless, we need not be in the 
least ashamed of the older members 
of our evolutionary family; we have 
still a great deal to learn from them. 
So as to visualize Man's posi- 
tion in the animal world, let us de- 
fine his main diagnostic characters. 
He is a highly gregarious bipedal mam- 
mal with unspecialized limbs but a 
very large brain. He is the only ani- 
mal which has developed the sym- 
bolisms of speech and writing, and he 
may well be the only animal capable 
of rational thought. He is, therefore, 
the only organism which can hand on 
patterns of acquired learning from, one 
generation to another. To these ad- 
vantages he owes his dominant posi- 
tion in the world today. 
Te have enabled him to 
exploit his environment and increase 
his numbers and his range of distribu- 
tion far more quickly and far more 
extensively than any animal of com- 
parable size. He has eliminated some 
of his competitors and exploited others 
for his own use, but the time has now 
come when different races of men 
are competing with each other within 
the closed arena of a limited environ- 
ment, and it is not easy to see where 
it will end. 
There is nothing equivalent to this 
in the inanimate world; but, when a 
biologist looks at the general trend 
of events, he is inclined to say, “Where 
have | seen something like this before, 
what is it due to, and how does it 
usually end?” 
Nature has made, not one, but two 
great experiments in the design of 
social animals. The first was carried 
out in Mesozoic times when Man's 
mammalian ancestors were beginning 
to emerge from reptiles. The results 
of this experiment are represented 
today by the social insects—notably 
the ants. 
There are a very large number of 
different species of ants, none of 
which interbreed; among them is found 
a range of complexity of social be- 
haviour which is not only unique in 
the animal kingdom but which forms 
a very remarkable parallel to different 
races of human beings.

HIERARCHIC SOCIETY 
7,000 kinds of ants are known. 
Mason ants build skyscraper dwell- 
ings with wonderfully domed cham- 
bers and cellings supported on 
pillars. 
  
     
        
      
Each group of worker ants has 
its own special job. The roadbuild- 
ers are constantly at work, con- 
structing open and covered high- 
ways. 
    
  
  
Each ant colony is ruled by a 
queen. The only duty of male 
ants is to mate with the queen. 
Only queens and males have 
wings, All the other members 
of the colony—sterile female ants 
—are workers. 
  
Down these roads the colony 
migrates, accompanied by its cattle 
and slaves, to take over new 
territories, often waging war on 
other ants in the process. 
Cartoon story by Frank C Betts Ltd.,, © by Visual Features Ltd., London 
Ants practice many of the arts 
—and have most of the vices— 
of man. They are harvesters and 
herdsmen and raise tiny insects 
called aphids, which are milked 
like cattle for the sweet honeydew 
they secrete. 
  
  
Each colony has a highly orga- 
nized social system. Ant slaves 
(prisoners of war) do the most 
irksome jobs. Some slave-owning 
ants have become so lazy that 
when the colony moves house 
they have to be carried by slaves. 
  
  
  
Ants are clever engineers. When 
they reach a stream, a living 
bridge of ants swings across over 
which the whole column passes. 
The job each ant will do is deter- 
mined from the time of its birth. 
 
Ants are the result of Nature's 
first great experiment in designing 
social animals, Man came only 
150 million years later. Has man, 
as a social animal, progressed 
much further than the ant? 
— February 1949 
At one extreme are species forming 
small communities, restricted to local- 
ized or specialized environments and 
exhibiting relatively little subdivision 
of labour between individuals. 
At the other extreme are large and 
often aggressive communities with 
marked differentiation of structure bet- 
ween different grades of individuals; 
populations of this type display high 
levels of co-operative effort involving, 
in some cases, the rudiments of agri- 
culture and husbandry: 
In all cases, however, ant societies 
are organized on a straightforward 
totalitarian basis, the contribution made 
by each individual towards the wel- 
fare of the community is determined 
from the time of birth; each grade of 
individual is structurally adapted for 
predetermined tasks. 
How far ants can communicate with 
each other may be doubtful, but it 
is tolerably certain that members of 
the same community recognize each 
other by a characteristic smell, and as 
the brain of an ant is about the size 
of the head of a pin, it is perhaps 
not surprising that ants should attack 
or kill an individual from another colony 
with a smell slightly different to their 
own. It is much less easy to under- 
stand why a man, with a brain of an 
entirely different order of complexity, 
should, at times, react almost equally 
violently to skin pigments different 
from his own. 
Ants are also the only organisms 
which—apart from Man—indulge in 
organized warfare—raiding the nests 
of other species and incorporating 
captives into their own societies. But 
perhaps the most striking facts relate 
to species which have changed their 
habits and distribution within recent 
times. 
Two instances of territorial 
expansion are known to have occurred 
in the last 150 years. Early in the 
nineteenth century an Eastern species 
(Pheidola megacephala), having spread 
rapidly over North Africa and southern 
Europe, managed to reach the islands 
of Madeira and Bermuda; in both 
places it exterminated the smaller 
native races. 
Meanwhile, a similar policy had 
been carried out by anather species 
(Iridomyrmex humilis), from the Argen- 
tine, which, having landed at New 
Orleans, very rapidly overran the 
southern United States; in due course, 
it too reached Bermuda, where it pro- 
ceeded to eliminate the earlier invader. 
In the world of ants there is no 
place for small peaceful communities 
unless they can isolate themselves 
effectively from larger and more power- 
ful neighbours, nor does there seem 
any lasting peace between large ag- 
gressive communities. Solomon's 
advice has, | suspect, been misinter- 
preted. It should read: “Consider the 
ants, and, if you use your intelligence, 
you will see how not to deal with 
international problems.” 
Having designed the ants, Nature 
waited for about 150 million years be- 
fore embarking on her second or 
human experiment. She waited, in 
fact, until it could be carried out with 
a species in which an individual's con- 
tribution to society was no longer 
based on inherited structural char-. 
acters but on the power of inter- 
communication with other individuals; 
in other words, until Man's brain had 
reached a level of development which 
enabled him to control his environ- 
ment, and to deal rationally with -the 
subdivision of labour between indi- 
viduals and with the distribution of 
natural resources between different 
groups of individuals. 
At the same time, she arranged that 
such groups should not be physio- 
logically isolated from each other. 
Different races of men can interbreed, 
or they can, if they wish, come to 
mutual agreement about the distribu- 
tion of world resources. Co 
The first policy would seem to lead 
to a world state with uniformity of 
social pattern and of material interests; 
the second involves territorial limita- 
tions and economic agreements. Both, 
as we know only too well, involve 
great practical difficulties. All the 
same, men ought to be able to do 
something better than ants.

### 58696: Canaletto's paintings helped rebuild shattered Warsaw

Canaletto’s paintings helped rebuild shattered 
by Jerzy Hryniewiecki 
1. first of Warsaw's citizens who returned to the 
city in January 1945 found nothing but a vague trace of its 
former outlines visible amid the rubble—a cemetery for hundreds 
of thousands. A few pockmarked buildings and an area on the 
right bank of the Vistula alone had escaped the holocaust. Apart 
from its ruins, nothing remained of Warsaw... except its name. 
Warsaw's reconstruction was soon being hotly debated by 
town planners and architects. Some had Utopian visions of a 
futuristic city. Many saw a unique opportunity to sweep away 
the past and the city's former shortcomings and to create an 
entirely new Warsaw. But the people of Warsaw had no time 
to wait. Swarming over the ruins they began to rebuild the city 
themselves. 
In time a new city emerged that reflected the beauty of its 
historic past while meeting the needs of 20th century life. A 
dynamic schooi of town planning was born. Medieval squares 
were recreated and 17th century houses rebuilt, but behind their 
facades were dwellings with every modern convenience. Palaces 
and mansions were restored as cultural and administrative centres. 
The Gothic cathedral was rebuilt with its original stones. The 
city's new opera house was given the same classical facade as 
its predecessor, but behind it is a modern concert and operatic 
theatre ranking among the best equipped in Europe. New and 
broader bridges now span the Vistula on the piles of those that 
were destroyed, 
But Warsaw's architects had recourse to a most unusual pro- 
cedure in reconstituting the city's historic buildings: the celebrated 
paintings of Warsaw by the 18th century artist Canaletto. 
To the people of Poland the name Canaletto evokes Warsaw 
not Venice. In 1767, Bernardo Belotto, better known as Canaletto 
the Younger (not to be confused with his uncle Antonio Canal—the 
famous Canaletto of Venice scenes) arrived in Warsaw. He fell 
in love with the city and remained there until his death in 1780, 
leaving behind him a series of paintings of Poland's capital of 
unrivalled fidelity: living street scenes with a wealth of detail of 
houses, churches, public buildings and grandiose panoramic views.

Canaletto’s paintings have been called “a fascinating full-colour 
film of Warsaw's life in the 18th century.” He always painted a 
building with adjoining ones, with its square or street filled with 
people, teams of horses and carriages, and the bustling life of 
the city about it. 
Warsaw's architects made huge enlargements of the 25 cele- 
brated townscapes by Canaletto in the city's national museum. 
They studied and recorded the details painted by Canaletto and, 
embodying them into the reconstructed monuments, churches and 
buildings, thus restored to Warsaw the true image of its ancient 
past.

Acour a year ago | was in 
London at the invitation of British psy- 
chologists and sociologists in order to 
lecture on “National Stereotypes.” 
Throughout the preceding day, during 
which | was undoubtedly made more 
sensitive by my preoccupation with 
this topic, | kept running into exam- 
ples of such stereotyped thinking. 
In my hotel, | heard someone say, 
“Oh, she has that Scottish stubborn- 
ness, you know’. A book review in a 
newspaper used the phrase, “With 
true Gallic wit”. At the theatre that 
evening, during the interval, 1 caught 
part of a conversation in which a pretty 
girl said to her escort, “I know that all 
Americans have a ‘line’”; and in a 
mystery story that | read before 
retiring, there was a reference to “typi- 
cal German thoroughness". 
These are all instances of those 
“pictures in our heads” to which 
Walter Lippman gave the name of ster- 
eotypes. They are typical of the ease 
with which most of us generalize about 
national or ethnic groups, usually with- 
out even stopping to think where such 
“information” comes from, and whether 
it represents the truth, the whole truth, 
or anything like the truth. 
There are certainly very few, if any, 
among us who have not succumbed 
to the temptation to stereotype nations. 
One might almost describe the ten- 
dency as inevitable, or at least very 
nearly so. We know that Englishmen 
are reserved, and Irishmen pugnacious; 
we have heard it all our lives; besides 
most people agree with us. But if we 
are asked how we know, we would 
not easily find a suitable answer. 
One of the earliest careful studies of 
this tendency was made by Katz and 
Braly, in 1932, in connexion with the 
stereotypes held by Princeton Univer- 
sity students. Their technique was 
simple. 
Each student was given a list of 
traits, and a list of nationalities; from 
the first list he chose the five traits 
which he regarded as characteristic of 
each national or racial group. 
We may summarize the results by 
OTTO KLINEBERG is professor emeritus of 
social psychology at Columbia University, 
New York, and director of the International 
Centre for Intergroup Relations, Parts.

indicating the three or four characteris- 
tics most commonly ascribed to each 
nationality. These included, for the 
Germans: scientifically-minded, indus- 
trious, stolid; the Italians, impulsive, 
artistic, passionate; Negroes, super- 
stitious, lazy, happy-go-lucky, ignorant; 
the Irish, pugnacious, quick-tempered, 
witty; the English, sportsmanlike, intel- 
ligent, conventional; the Jews, shrewd, 
mercenary, industrious; the Americans, 
industrious, intelligent, materialistic, 
ambitious; the Chinese, superstitious, 
sly, conservative; the Japanese, intelli- 
gent, industrious, progressive; the 
Turks, cruel, religious, treacherous. 
A study conducted in nine countries 
under the auspices of Unesco in 1948 
and 1949, showed that such stereo- 
typed thinking could easily be elicited 
almost anywhere. In each country 
approximately 1,000 respondents, re- 
presenting a cross-section of the popu- 
lation, were given a list of 12 traits, 
and asked to choose those which they 
thought were most applicable to them- 
selves, to Americans, to Russians, and 
in some cases, to two or three other 
national groups as well. They could 
choose as many of the traits as they 
wished. 
The British, for example, thought of 
Americans as primarily progressive, 
conceited, generous, peace-loving, in- 
telligent, practical. The Americans re- 
garded the British as intelligent, hard- 
working, brave, peace-loving, conceited 
and self-controlled. The Norwegians 
described the Russians as hardwork- 
ing, domineering, backward, brave, 
. cruel and practical. 
The “self-image” is also revealing. 
The British saw themselves as peace- 
loving, brave, hard-working, intelligent; 
the French saw themselves as intelli- 
gent, peace-loving, generous, and 
brave; the Americans saw themselves 
as peace-loving, generous, intelligent 
and progressive. All the groups 
agreed on one item: their own nation 
was the most peace-loving of alll 
Few people realize how much the 
existence of stereotypes may colour 
our relations with other people, even 
to the extent of seeing them differently 
as a result. 
What we see is determined in part 
by what we expect to see. If we be- 
lieve, for example, that Italians are 
noisy, we will have a tendency to

notice those Italians who are indeed 
noisy; if we are in the presence of 
some who do not fit the stereotype, 
we may not even realize that they, too, 
are Italian. If someone points that fact 
out to us and says: “Look, those 
people are Italians, and they are not 
noisy”, we can always dismiss them as 
exceptions. 
Since there is no limit to the number 
of cases that can be so dismissed, we 
may continue to cling to the pictures in 
our heads, in spite of all the facts to 
the contrary. This does not always 
happen. Stereotypes do sometimes 
change in the light of new experience. 
If we have had them for a long time, 
however, we surrender them with great 
reluctance. 
Some years ago Allport and Post- 
man, psychologists at Harvard Univer- 
sity (Cambridge, U.S.A.) studied some 
of the phenomena associated with the 
spread of rumours, making use of a 
technique known as “serial reproduc- 
tion”, a very simple device which 
anyone can use with a group of friends. 
They showed a picture to one stu- 
dent, and he described to a second 
student what he saw in the picture. 
The second then told a third what the 
first had told him; the third told the 
fourth, and so on, through a series of 
8 to 10 reproductions. Then a compar- 
ison was made between the final 
result and the original presentation. 
One of the pictures showed a scene 
in a subway in which, in addition to a 
number of people seated, there were 
two men standing, one a white man, 
the other a Negro. The white man 
was dressed in working clothes, with 
an open razor stuck in his belt. It so 
happens that the stereotype of the 
Negro held by some people in the 
U.S.A. included the notion that Neg- 
roes carry with them an open razor, 
of which they make ready use in an 
argument. 
In half of the groups who served as 
subjects in these experiments, before 
the end of the series of reproductions 
had been reached, the razor had “mov- 
ed” from the white man to the Negro. 
In some instances, the Negro was even 
represented as brandishing the razor 
violently in the face of the white man. 
This does not mean that half of the 
subjects in the experiment saw the 
Negro with the razor, since if only one 
person in the chain made this error, 
it would be repeated by those that 
followed. Interestingly enough, this 
did not occur when the subjects were 
Negroes (who rejected the stereotype), 
or young children (who had not yet 
“learned” it). 
If a great many people agree that a 
particular trait is associated with a 
particular nation, does that make it 
true? There is a fairly widespread 
theory to the effect that “where there's 
smoke there's fire”. Otherwise, the 
argument runs, where does the stereo- 
type come from? How would it come 
into existence? 
There is, however, a good deal of 
evidence that stereotypes may develop 
without any kernel of truth whatsoever. 
We all know how widespread is the 
notion that intelligent people have high 
foreheads, yet scientific investigation 
in this field has failed to reveal any 
such relationship. 
The stereotype of the criminal as 
bearing in his features the mark of his 
criminality is widely accepted, but it is 
equally without foundation; the famous 
British criminologist, Sir Charles Gor- 
ing, was able to demonstrate that 
a composite photograph, representing 
criminals in British gaols, bore no 
resemblance to the accepted stereo- 
type of the criminal. 
Stereotypes frequently change. In 
some cases it may be argued that this 
corresponds to a real change in the 
characteristics of the people; in others, 
however, it seems much more likely to 
be due to external circumstances 
which have little or nothing to do with 
the group concerned. 
The Dutch sociologist, Den Hollan- 
der, has studied the historical changes 
in the stereotype of the Hungarians in 
Europe. He points out that for cen- 
turies after the migration of Hungarians 
to Central Europe, they had a bad 
reputation, and were regarded as cul- 
turally different, and therefore inferior 
to Europeans generally. During the 
15th and 16th centuries, however, when 
they joined in the war against the 
Turks, they were pictured as a brave, 
devout, and chivalrous people. 
By the second half of the 18th cen- 
tury their popularity had again de- 
clined, and they were described as 
savage, lazy, egotistical, unreliable, 
and tyrannous. This picture changed 
again a little later, when the 
Hungarians became romanticized and 
idealized. Den Hollander believes that 
the image followed the pattern of poli- 
tical inter-relationships; it seems unli- 
kely that there was sufficient transfor- 
mation in the character of the people 
to justify the change in the national 
image. 
I. American sociologist, 
La Piere, studied the attitudes of 
residents of California towards first 
and second generation Armenian im- 
migrants in Fresno County in that 
State. There was almost complete 
agreement that these Armenians had 
more than their share of faults, and the 
general attitude toward them was re- 
latively unfriendly. 
La Piere proceeded to question non- 
Armenians as to the reasons for their 
antipathies, and he was able to classify 
the answers into three stereotypes. In 
the first place, it was stated that 
Armenians were treacherous, lying, 
deceitful. In actual fact, when measur- 
ed by the criterion of business integ- 
rity, the Armenian merchants turned 
ca
ta
 
   
Rs ot yA . ’ Ldm bon Ce aA: 
out to be equal and frequently superior 
to others. 
In the second place, they were alle- 
ged to be parasites, making excessive 
demands upon charitable organizations, 
free clinics, etc. Actually, such de- 
mands by them were less than half of 
what would be expected in terms of 
their proportion of the population. 
Finally, it was said that they had an 
inferior code of morality, and they were 
always getting into trouble with the 
law. In fact, police records showed 
that they appeared in only 1.5 per cent 
of Police Court cases, although they 
were about 6 per cent of the population. 
La Piere concludes that all of these 
stereotypes have one factor in com- 
mon, viz. that they are definitely false. 
This does not mean that stereotypes 
never contain any truth. It does mean 
that they can develop without any 
truth whatsoever. 
Stereotyped thinking may be almost 
inevitable, but there is good evidence 
that it can at least be reduced, if not 
eliminated. Eighteen years after the 
Katz and Braly study, another psycho- 
logist (Gilbert) applied the same tech- 
nique to a new generation of Princeton 
students. He found that there was 
some persistence of stereotypes, but 
also a very important change which he 
describes as “a fading effect”.

### 58711: Pictures in our heads

   
‘TAKE-OFF’ 
ON STEREOTYPES 
ABOUT INDIA 
These drawings are take-offs by an Indian 
artist, A. Ml. Abraham, poking fun at some of 
the stereotypes Westerners often have of 
Indians and India. The cartoons were spe- 
cially drawn for the 
There is much less agreement 
among the students in 1950 than in 
1932; any specific trait is usually 
checked by a much smaller proportion 
of students in the later study. In 1932 
for example, 84 per cent of the stu: 
dents described the Negroes as lazy; 
in 1950 the percentage had dropped 
to 31. The description of Italians as 
artistic drops from 83 to 28. 
In London, a Unesco study conduct- 
ed by H.E.O. James and Coran Tenen, 
showed how specific personal exper- 
iences might affect the nature and 
content of stereotypes. What they did 
was to obtain from schoolchildren 
their opinions of other ethnic groups. 
particularly of African Negroes, and 
then bring them into contact with two 
able African women teachers who 
spent a few weeks in the schools. 
The “before and after” picture is 
very striking. As an example, a child 
before the experience stated that “I 
do not like black people; it’s the colour; 
it makes me nervous; they might be 
savage... they are different in nature 
from us, more savage and cruel some- 
times, so you don’t trust them ever.” 
The same child after the experience 
said: “Miss V. and Miss W. were nice 
people... there does not seem any dif- 
ference between them and us except 
the colour. | think that Negroes are

by 
like that—just like us, except for the 
colour. | like them. They are nice 
people.” 
The authors give many examples of 
similar changes that occurred. Stereo- 
types cannot always be modified so 
strikingly nor so fast, but the fact that 
they can be changed at all as a result 
of experience is itself encouraging. 
Sometimes just growing older helps. 
In a study sponsored by Unesco, 
Piaget and Weil report the results of a 
series of interviews with Swiss children 
of different ages. One interview with 
a little girl aged eight years ran as 
follows: 
“Have you heard of foreigners?— 
Yes, there are Germans and French. 
Are there any differences between 
these foreigners?—Yes, the Ger- 
mans are bad, they are always 
making war. The French are poor 
and everything is dirty there. Then 
| have heard of Russians, but they 
are not at all nice.—Do you have 
any personal knowledge of the 
French, Germans or Russians, or 
have you read something about 
them?—No.—Then how do you 
know?—Everyone says so.” 
On the other hand, a boy aged thir- 
teen years, after having mentioned a 
large number of foreign countries of   
which he had heard, was asked. “Are 
there any differences between all 
those countries?”, and his answer 
was, in part, “you find all types of 
people everywhere.” We are not all 
as “mature” as this 13 year-old boy, 
but perhaps we can move in that 
direction. Or is it possible that the 
Swiss are...? Oh nol No stereotypes! 
The understanding of national char- 
acteristics represents an important 
task for all of us. The difficulties in 
the way are great: nations are made 
up of many different kinds of indivi- 
duals, and generalizations are danger- 
ous if they do not give adequate 
consideration to the range of individual 
variations. 
An important first step will be taken 
if we treat “the pictures in our heads” 
with a strong dose of scepticism, and if 
we keep our minds closed to stereo- 
types and open only to facts. No one 
is denying the existence of national 
characteristics. 
A knowledge of them can aid our 
understanding of people, as well as our 
enjoyment of the varieties of behaviour 
and personality that are found in dif- 
ferent parts of the world. We need to 
make sure, however, that the “pictures 
in our heads" correspond as closely as 
possible to reality.

### 58714: In the centre of the map

IN THE CENTRE OF THE MAP 
by Marshall G. S. Hodgson 
|. the sixteenth century the 
Italian missionary, Matteo Ricci, took 
with him to China a European map of 
the world showing the new discoveries 
in America. The Chinese were glad 
to learn about America, but one point 
in the map offended them. Since it 
split the earth's surface down the 
Pacific, China appeared off at the 
" right-hand edge; whereas the Chinese 
24 
thought of themselves as literally the 
“Middle Kingdom”, which should be 
in the centre of the map. Ricci pacifi- 
ed them by drawing another map, 
splitting the Atlantic instead, so that 
China appeared more central; and 
maps are still commonly drawn that 
way in that part of the world. 
Europeans have clung to the first 
type of map, showing Europe in the 
upper centre; while the commonest 
maps in North America show the 
U.S.A. in that post of honour, even at 
the cost of splitting a continent in 
two. The temptation not only to put 
one's own land in the centre of the 
map, but one's own people in the 
centre of history, seems universal. 
The most famous case of this is 
indeed that of the “Middle Kingdom”. 
Many Chinese used to suppose that 
the Temple of Heaven at the Emper- 
or's capital, Peking, marked the exact 
centre of the earth's surface. 
Chinese scholars even in the Middle 
Ages were aware that China could not 
be said to be mathematically central; 
they knew the general lay of Europe 
and Africa and the Indian Ocean, and 
a writer could remark that the “centre” 
of the earth was along the equator. 
Nevertheless, even for sober histor- 
ians the pivotal fact of human history 
was the condition of the great Chinese 
empire, in which was concentrated all 
the splendour of polished civilization. 
For the medieval Hindu the world 
was a place for the purification of 
souls. Kings and their empires came 
and went, the gods themselves arose 
and perished—time was infinite, space 
immense, with unlimited opportunity for 
every soul to reap in birth after rebirth 
what it had sown. 
As a given cosmic cycle wore on, 
disorder increased and justice faded. 
Our own age (the Hindus explained) 
was in the latter part of such a cycle; 
only in the central parts of the earthy 
regions—in India, that is—was society 
still well ordered: there Brahmins still 
offered sacrifices and the other castes 
ruled or served according to their 
status. 
In the benighted lands to the east 
and west—so tainted already with 
decline that pious Brahmins dared not 
set foot there—souls were doomed to 
be born as barbarous Mlecchas; there 
they lived unhallowed lives till they 
earned the right to be born in India. 
As our degenerate age drew on, 
even in India itself the social order 
was upset, rulers rose from the basest 
castes, and finally even MlIlecchas 
entered as conquerors—Muslims from 
the west, and even remote Europeans. 
Through all this outward humiliation, 
however, the Hindu could know that 
there in the central lands where the 
sacred Ganges flowed he could still 
live the way of truth and holiness— 
inaccessible to lesser breeds of men— 
and aspire to the highest degrees of 
rebirth. 
To the medieval Muslim, Moham- 
med’s birthplace, Mecca, was the cen- 
tre of the earth's surface; here was 
the very throne of God, where heaven 
and earth were nearest. 
To be sure, scholars knew that the 
earth was a sphere, and God equally 
present everywhere in the hearts of 
the believers. But their more sober 
picture of the world was equally effec- 
tive in supporting the eminence of 
Islam. They thought of the inhabited 
quarter of the globe as a land mass 
lying between the equator and the 
North Pole, and between the oceans 
to the west and to the east—roughly 
Eurasia and northern Africa. 
Tus was divided into sev- 
en “climes” from south to north, and 
from extreme heat to cold. Muslims 
writing in the latitude of Syria or Iran 
explained that in the hot south men 
grew lazy and so remained backward 
in civilization; and likewise in the far 
north where it was too cold—in nor- 
thern Europe, for instance—men’s 
skins were pallid and their minds 
sluggish. 
Hence it was that only in the central, 
moderate climes, like the Mediterran- 
ean lands or Iran, were minds most 
active and civilization most advanced: 
from there the blessings of Islam were 
gradually being brought even to the 
remotest areas, among the Negroes 
in the hot south and the white men in 
the cold north. 
The West-Europeans of the same age 
had many of the same ideas of history 
and geography as the Muslims, getting 
them from the same Greek and Hebrew 
sources; but their interpretation was 
very different. For them history was 
the story of God's progressive dis- 
pensations of law or of grace to his 
favoured people. Out of the descen- 
dants of Adam, God had first chosen 
the Hebrews, but with the coming of 
Christ it was a "new Israel”, the Chris- 
tians, that received His favours. 
Even among the Christians God 
had made a further selection—casting 
aside those of the Levant and Greece 
as heretics or schismatics, in favour 
of the West-Europeans under the Pope 
at Rome. The favoured peoples 
of each age lived under a succession 
of great monarchies: in earlier times 
Chaldean, Persian, and Greek, which 
all conquered the Hebrews; but last 
and greatest, under which Christ Him- 
self was born, the empire of Rome in 
the west, which should endure till 
Judgment Day. 
W eer curoeans allowed 
that the centre of the world's sur- 
face was Jerusalem (by exaggerating 
the length of the Mediterranean, their 
maps could show Spain and China as 
equally distant from it); but they assur- 
ed themselves that, just as at the be- 
ginning of history Paradise was in the 
east where the sun rises, so in these 
latter days the centre of God's vicar- 
ship on earth was in the west, where 
the sun sets; henceforth Rome was the 
centre of all authority, spiritual and 
temporal. 
With the discovery that Earth is a 
tiny planet in an immensity of space, 
that mankind has been upon it hun- 
dreds of thousands of years and is 
stil a newcomer, we have had to 
rethink our situation. The great ideals 
of faith and of culture have to be 
seen in spiritual terms rather than as 
reflected in the map of the universe. 
The West-Europeans were the first 
to be really faced with the new dis- 
coveries and have consequently led 
the way toward creating a new picture 
of the world. But they have not yet 
escaped the temptation to make geo- 
graphy and history centre upon them- 
selves. 
One need only examine the table 
of contents of any proper Western 
“world history”, Civilization began in 
Mesopotamia and Egypt (with perhaps 
some local variants in India and Chi- 
na); but (it would seem) soon history 
was almost a monopoly of the Greeks; 
and though other peoples might still 
be curious, in their quaint ways, 
hereafter it was really Europe that

### 58714: In the centre of the map

  
  
We reproduce here a burlesque 
map of the fortifications of Parls 
drawn by Mark Twain and published 
in the “New York Herald” of Sunday, 
October 2, 1870. At this time the 
siege of Paris during the Franco- 
Prussian war had just begun and 
newspapers the world over were filled 
with maps of Paris as is journalistic 
practice. Below we publish the text 
written by Mark Twain for his map. 
— August 1957 
MARK TWAIN'S MAP OF PARIS 
TO THE READER 
The above map explains itself. 
The idea of this map in not original with me, but is borrowed 
from the “Tribune” and the other great metropolitain journals. 
] claim no other merit for this production (if | may so call 
it) than that it is accurate. The main blemish of the city paper 
maps, of which it is an Imitation, is that in them more attention 
seems paid to artistic picturesqueness than geographical 
reliability. 
Inasmuch as this ls the first time | ever tried to draft and 
engrave a map, or attempt anything in the line of art at all, 
the commendations the work has received and the admiration 
it has excited among the people have been very grateful 
to my feelings. And it is touching to reflect that by far the 
most enthusiastic of these praises have come from people 
who know nothing at all about art. 
By an unimportant oversight | have engraved the map so 
that it reads wrong-end first except to left-handed people. | 
forgot that in order to make it right in print it should be drawn 
and engraved upside down. However, let the student who 
desires to contemplate the map stand on his head or hold 
it before her looking-glass. That will bring it right. 
The reader will comprehend at a glance that that piece 
of river with- the “High Bridge” over it got left out to one 
side by reason of a slip of the graving-tool which rendered 
it necessary to change the entire course of the River Rhine 
or else spoil the map. After having spent two days in digging 
and gouging at the map, | would have changed the course 
of the Atlantic Ocean before | would have lost so much work. 
MARK TWAIN 
OFFICIAL COMMENDATIONS 
It is the only map of the kind | ever saw. (U.S. Grant) 
It places the situation in an entirely new light. (Bismarck) 
I cannot look upon it without shedding tears. (Brigham 
Young) 
My wife was for years afflicted with freckles, and though 
everything was done for her relief that could be done, all 
was in vain. But, sir, since her first glance at your map, they 
have entirely left her. She has nothing but convulsions now. 
(J. Smith) 
If I had had this map | could have got out of Metz without 
any trouble. (Bazaine) 
It is very nice, large print. (Napoleon) 
I have seen a great many maps In my time, but none that 
this one reminds me of. (Trochu) 
It is but fair to say that in some respects it is a truly 
remarkable map. (W.T. Sherman) 
| said to my son, Frederic William, “If you could only make 
a map like that, | would be perfectly willing to see you die—   even anxious.” (William II)   
counted—and after the rise of Rome 
only Western Europe; ‘here was the 
home of truth and liberty. 
If during long centuries it was hard 
to find either truth or liberty in 
Western Europe, this period was re- 
gretfully labelled the Dark Ages of 
mankind; but in modern times the 
West-Europeans have duly gone forth 
to enlighten (and subdue) the world— 
so that the history of a henceforth 
“Westernized” world may be safely 
reduced almost to that of the West 
itself. 
In European “world atlases” each 
European country has its own map, 
with the rest of the world in a few 
pages at the end. The map ordinarily 
selected to show the world as a whole 
is ideally suited to reinforce this way 
of seeing mankind. 
On the Mercator world map not 
only is Europe in the upper centre: it 
is represented as a good deal larger 
than the other great culture areas. 
Most of these lie south of the fortieth 
parallel, while Europe is almost wholly 
north of it, where Mercator's projection 
begins to exaggerate the size of things 
enormously. 
Accordingly even on the world map, 
which ought to provide a sense of 
proportion, there is space to name a 
great many places in Europe, while in 
other populous centres like India or 
China, shown on a much smaller scale, 
only a few chief places need to be 
indicated. 
Although equal-area projections of 
the world have long been available, 
in which shapes as well as sizes are 
much less distorted, Westerners 
understandably cling to a projection 
which so markedly flatters them, They 
explain (as if they were engaged in 
nothing but sailing) that the true angles 
given on the Mercator map are of 
convenience to navigators; and in 
atlases and wall-maps, in books of 
reference and in newspapers, when 
Westerners turn to see what the world 
looks like as a whole, their precon- 
ceptions are authoritatively gratified. 
The story is often told of a small 
tribe whose word for “mankind” was 
the name for the tribe itself. Other 
tribes were merely incidental in their 
picture of the world—perhaps not 
even fully human. Chinese, Hindus, 
Muslims, and Westerners alike have 
smiled perhaps too quickly at the 
rather perilous naiveté of that small 
tribe.

### 58716: The New science of art conservation

THE NEW SCIENCE 
OF ART CONSERVATION 
by Harold J. Plenderleith 
I temple, the statue and 
the totem pole have to withstand the 
action of wind and rain, heat and cold. 
Old ships such as the Vasa (raised 
from the sea bed in Stockholm har- 
bour); or the Victory (preserved at 
Portsmouth, England), provide special 
problems concerned with the control of 
humidity, prevention from shrinkage 
and protection from insect attack. 
Mural paintings are normally sheltered 
from extremes of temperature but may 
be invaded by capillary moisture and 
attacked by mould. 
Science in our generation is at last 
working in the service of monuments 
and of museums in co-operation with 
the art critic and the archaeologist. 
  
      
  
Synthetic materials have been dev- 
eloped that can be used as an impreg- 
nating medium on tempera painting 
without imparting any residual shine. 
It can also be used to consolidate 
pottery from salty deserts whilst the 
salts are being washed from it and is 
readily removed afterwards if desired. 
It is now possible by soft X-rays to 
record through a painting the original 
crayon sketch made by the artist on 
his canvas. Only a few years ago 
this would have been regarded as 
miraculous. It is also possible to re- 
move a fresco from the wall and leave 
behind the mural painter's original 
drawing, thus exposing for the art critic 
a stimulating new world of interest. 
  
Hundreds of 
thousands of rare 
books and 
manuscripts were 
damaged by the 
floods that 
overwhelmed 
Florence, Italy, in 
November 1966. 
Here, a roomful of 
volumes that were 
taken apart, washed 
page by page and 
injected or fumigated 
to combat mould, 
thelr worst enemy. 
Inestimable damage 
was also caused 
to countless art 
treasures in 
Florence during the 
flood, which led 
Unesco to launch 
an international 
rescue operation.

In Moscow, certain painted icons 
have been found to be built up in a 
series of strata on one and the same 
wooden panel, and a special technique 
has been evolved whereby it is 
possible to recover the lower and older 
ones without losing those above. Pic- 
tures can be transferred from worm- 
eaten panels and mounted on sound 
ones, and in other cases rotting can- 
vases are replaced by new ones. In 
fact, the most delicate material and 
most complex structures can be saved 
by the skill of the modern restorer. 
In the field of archaeology, the 
mechanism of metallic corrosion, a 
universal cause of deterioration, is now 
well understood and means have been 
devised to remove it or, at option, to 
arrest its advance without necessarily 
destroying the aesthetic character of 
the piece. 
There is hope that many of the 
world's monumental treasures that are 
threatened by exposure to atmospheres 
polluted by industrial fumes may be 
saved—objects universally acclaimed 
such as the splendid gilt bronze horses 
of St Marks, Venice, or the lion and 
griffon of Perugia—whereas, in the 
absence of these recent advances in 
the service of conservation, their years 
were numbered. The threat will remain, 
however, as long as we are content to 
breathe air that is polluted with 
sulphur compounds. The cumulation 
action on metals is as devastating as it 
is on the human subject! 
An altogether new field has been 
opened up by the physicist in the 
application of his methods, of non- 
destructive testing, and these have 
already made notable contributions to 
the conservation of monuments. An 
example that immediately comes to 
mind of modern science in action is 
the discovery and excavation of an 
Etruscan tomb. 
First the scientist applies his steth- 
oscope to mother earth. The detec- 
tion equipment of the Lerici Foundation 
in Italy, famous for its discoveries of 
Etruscan tombs, can be compared 
with a stethoscope in sensitivity. 
When the scientist detects a discon- 
tinuity beneath the surface he can pin- 
point the centre of a subterranean 
chamber and fix his instruments with 
such care that on drilling vertically and 
inserting a special tubular periscope 
with appropriate lighting, he has a

complete view of the interior. All that 
has been done to make this possible 
is to drill a little hole in the ground 
10 cm. in diameter. 
That, however, is no more than the 
beginning. He has located the tomb. 
He now proceeds to insert a small 
camera into the tube and he takes a 
series of colour photographs, rotating 
the camera through 60° between each. 
When these photographs are laid out 
in orderly succession, there is a com- 
plete record of the paintings that 
commonly adorn the walls, of any bas- 
reliefs and of grave goods, etc. 
Here is the monument disclosed for 
study yet without a sod being turned. 
A decision has now to be taken and 
an important deduction made. Is the 
tomb worthy of the time, care and cost, 
necessary for its scientific excavation? 
If not, it can be sealed and concealed 
and we are the richer for the docu- 
mentation that has already been 
obtained. 
If. however, it is decided to exca- 
vate, the photographs will show how 
to go about it for they will disclose 
the position of the entrance door: the 
location of the entrance passage can 
be deduced, and instead of breaking 
in through walls or ceiling, as happen- 
ed in previous generations, the exca- 
vation can be so conducted as to 
avoid all damage by entering the tomb 
from the side by its own passage and

### 58719: The World's growing water shortage

a8 
THE WORLD'S GROWING WATER 
0.. need for water is constantly increasing. Though 
it is difficult to calculate the exact amount, it is safe to say 
that in 20 years’ time the demand for water will be roughly 
double. 
Faced with such a situation it is obvious that we should 
search as widely as possible and with every available means for 
sources of fresh water that seem to be the least costly. But 
where do these sources exist? Only a sustained and co-ordinat- 
ed programme of scientific observation and research in hydrology 
wili tell us the answer. This is the purpose of the international 
Hydrological Decade, 1965-1975. 
Underground water reserves are much larger those on the sur- 
face, but as they are unseen we tend to underestimate them. It 
is vitally important that we make use of these underground 
reserves, but never haphazardly. For example, where does the 
water come from which we find in one or another of the under- 
ground water-bearing layers (‘aquifers’)? How does it move? How 
is it renewed? And if this water is used, what effect will it have 
on the discharge and future levej of the water table? What are 
the laws of hydrogeology? Despite the immense progress of 
recent years, all these questions have still not been fully ans- 
wered. 
A similar need for scientific research exists in the branch of 
hydrology that deals with the quality of water. In nature, there is 
no water like the pure water defined by chemists, made up of 
only hydrogen and oxygen. River water, ground-water, and even 
rainwater always contain other dissolved or suspended elements, 
and these, even when present in small quantities, play an Important 
role. 
in the case of irrigation farming, for instance, every drop of 
water brings with it a little sait: the water evaporates, but the 
salt remains and gradually poisons the soil and plants. In general, 
we now know how to remedy this problem of salinity with the 
help of leaching and drainage. 
But many questions remain unanswered regarding the effect 
of irrigation and drainage on the quality of ground-water, and the 
possibility of maintaining the ground-water level below the zone

of the plant roots while bringing to the surface the water necessary 
for irrigation. 
What happens exactly in this thin layer of soil which preserves 
the moisture necessary to plant life? What form—liquid or 
vapour—does the water take in this zone? What forces act 
on the water, depending on the kind of soii present? How long 
will this life-giving moisture last? 
Evaporation from the soil and transpiration from vegetation are 
responsible for the direct return to the atmosphere of more than 
half the water which falls on the iand. How exactly do these 
phenomena, which represent an enormous loss of resources, 
occur? What part does a forest play in the water balance-sheet 
of a given area? Does it act merely as a water-consuming 
mechanism operating through the absorption and transpiration of 
the trees—thereby reducing the quantity of runoff which reaches 
the rivers—or, on the contrary, does it result in a slow seepage 
into the earth which can later be recovered in the form of 
ground-water, while at the same time preventing erosion? 
These are the kinds of problems which still have to be resolved: 
the answers will only be found through a vast programme of 
scientific research. 
The International Hydrological Decade is such a programme. It 
is making possible the global observation of hydrological events— 
the quantities of rain and snow that fall, the discharge of rivers 
and underground reserves—and a world-wide stocktaking of our 
water resources. It is promoting scientific research in every 
branch of hydrology: water run-off, soil moisture, evaporation, 
movement of ground-water, the dynamics of lakes, estuaries and 
deltas, the evolution of glaciers and the geochemistry of water. 
lt is a unique co-operative enterprise to provide the scientific 
foundations for decisions that governments must take to meet 
the world’s growing need for water.

EXPLORING THE WORLD’S OCEANS 
Man's knowledge of the oceans which cover three-quarters of the earth's 
surface is meagre compared to their importance to him. The Indian Ocean, for 
instance, Is a “weather generator” for many countries of South Asia and a 
potentially rich fishing ground. But it was one of the world’s least known oceans 
until an international expedition (25 countries, 40 ships) co-sponsored by 
Unesco and the Special Committee on Oceanic Research studied it intensively 
from 1959 to 1965. Today, oceanography is focussed on a systematic 
global exploration of the world's oceans. Below left, scientists of a Red Sea

by Claude Lévi-Strauss 
Raussen was more than 
just a keen and subtle observer of 
peasant life, an impassioned reader of 
books on foreign travel, a skilful and 
accomplished investigator of exotic 
customs and beliefs. Without fear of 
contradiction it can be stated that a 
full century before anthropology was 
actually born he conceived, desired 
and foretold it, placing it directly in the 
ranks of the natural and human 
sciences then in existence. 
This prophetic conception, which he 
formulated both as a plea and as a 
programme of action, appears in a 
long footnote to the Discourse on the 
Origin of Inequality. “| have difficulty 
in comprehending,” Rousseau wrote, 
“why in an age that prides itself on 
learning, two men cannot be found, 
one of whom would sacrifice twenty 
thousand crowns of his wealth and 
the other ten years of his life, to make 
a historic journey round the world, 
studying not only the inevitable stones 
and plants, but for once men and 
customs.” 
And a little further on he exclaims: 
“The whole of the world is a weave 
of nations of which we know only the 
names. And we presume to judge 
mankind! 
“Imagine a Montesquieu, a Buffon, 
a Diderot, a d'Alembert, a Condillac, 
or men of that stamp, travelling to 
instruct their fellow-countrymen, ob- 
serving or describing as only they 
know how, Turkey, Egypt, Barbary, the 
empire of Morocco, Guinea, the land 
of the Kaffirs, the interior of Africa 
and its eastern coast, the Malabars, 
the Mogul, the banks of the Ganges, 
the kingdoms of Siam, Pegu and Ava, 
China, Tartary, and above all Japan; 
and in the other hemisphere, Mexico, 
Peru, Chile, the Magellan lands, not 
forgetting the Patagonias real or imag- 
inary, Tucuman, Paraguay, and if 
possible Brazil, the Caribbean, Florida 
and all the savage lands. Such a 
journey would be of more importance 
than all others and would have to be 
made with the greatest of care.

on their return from those unforget- 
table travels, were to write at their 
leisure a natural, moral and political 
history of what they had seen, then

ROUSSEAU, FATHER 
OF ANTHROPOLOGY 
world arise from their pens, and we 
would learn to know our own...” (Dis- 
course on the Origin of Inequality, 
note 10.) 
Is this not the very subject matter 
as well as the working method of 
modern anthropology? 
But Rousseau did not just foresee 
anthropology, he actually founded it. 
Firstly, he did so in practice by writing 
the Discourse on the Origin and Foun- 
dations of Inequality Among Men which 
posed the question of the relationship 
betwen nature and culture, and is per- 
haps the first treatise produced on 
general anthropology. Secondly, he 
founded the science in theory by 
setting down with remarkable clarity 
and precision the aims of the anthro- 
pologist as distinguished from those of 
the moralist and the historian: 
“When one wishes to study men, 
one must look close at hand; but to 
study man, one must learn to look 
into the distance; one must first 
observe the differences in order to 
discern the properties.” (Essay on the 
Origin of Languages, Chapter VII.) 
This method of approach which 
Rousseau assigned to anthropology 
marks the birth of the new science and 
helps to clarify what at first may appear 
to be a double paradox: that Rous- 
seau could at one and the same time 
advocate the study of men living in 
the most remote corners of the earth, 
but in effect devoted most of his 
attention to the one man nearest to 
him, namely himself; and that in all 
his writings his systematic desire for 
identification with others went hand in 
hand with his total refusal of identi- 
fication with himself. 
Now every anthropologist at some 
time or other during his life work must 
resolve these same two seeming 
contradictions which in reality are no 
more than the two interchangeable 
sides of one coin. 
Each time that the anthropologist 
goes out into the field he plunges into 
a world where everything around him 
is strange and often hostile. He finds 
himself alone with nothing but his own 
person, his subjective self, to help 
him survive and carry on his work. 
Physically and mentally wracked as 
he is by fatigue, hunger and hardship, 
by the disruption of his normal habits, 
and by the sudden revelation of pre- 
judices which he had never suspected 
to exist, his self reveals itself in these 
unfamiliar surroundings as it really 
is—battered and buffeted by all the 
shocks and impacts of his personal 
life, which not only affected his choice 
of a career but would thereafter deeply 
mark its entire course. 
In the work of anthropology, there- 
fore, the observer uses himself as his 
own instrument of observation. As a 
result, he must learn to know himself, 
to look at himself objectively and at 
a distance as if he were another 
person. And so the anthropologist 
turns to this other person within him, 
which is different from his self, in 
order to arrive at an evaluation. And 
this then becomes an integral part of 
all the observations he carries out in 
the field on groups and individuals 
and the other within them. The prin- 
ciple of “confessions”, written or 
unacknowledged, is thus basic to the 
work of every anthropologist. 
For in order to rediscover one's own 
image as reflected in others, which is 
anthropology’s single purpose in study- 
ing man, one should first reject one's 
image of oneself. 
|. is to Rousseau that we 
owe the discovery of this profound 
principle—and the only one on which 
the sciences of man could be founded. 
But it remained out of reach and grasp 
and incomprehensible so long as the 
accepted philosophy was based on 
Descarte’'s doctrine of the Cogito 
(Cogito ergo sum) and was fettered 
to the alleged logical proof of the ego 
upon which the edifice of physics was 
constructed though only by renouncing 
that of sociology and even biology. 
Descartes believed that he could 
pass directly from the interiority of 
man to the external world, overlooking 
that between these two extremes there 
existed societies and civilizations, that 
is, worlds made up of men. 
Rousseau speaks eloquently of him- 
self in the third person as “he” 
(sometimes even splitting this “he” into 
two distinct parts as in the Dialogues) 
heralding the famous formula “The me 
is another” (the anthropologist does 
the same thing before proceeding to 
show that other people are men like 
himself, or in other words, the other 
is me). 
Rousseau thus emerges as the great 
innovator of the concept of uncondi- 
tional objectivity. In his first Promen- 
ade, he defines his aim as “to study 
the modifications of my soul and their 
sequels”, and then adds: "In a sense, 
| shall perform upon myself the same

ROUSSEAU (Continued) 
experiments that the physicist carries 
out on the atmosphere in order to dis- 
cover its daily condition.” 
What Rousseau reveals to us (and 
though modern psychology and anthro- 
pology have now made it more familiar, 
it is nevertheless a most astonishing 
revelation) is that there is a third 
person “he” that thinks within me, and 
at first leads me to doubt that it is 
| who am thinking. 
To Montaigne’s question “What do 
| know?” (which started the whole dis- 
cussion) Descartes thought he could 
provide the reply with his “lI think, 
therefore | am.” To this Rousseau 
retorted with the query “What am I?” 
which cannot be answered until an- 
other, more fundamental, question has 
been resolved: “Am 1?” And the an- 
swer that personal experience has 
given is the “he” concept that Rous- 
seau discovered and which he pro- 
ceeded at once to explore with 
consummate lucidity... 
Now if we are to believe that when 
first human societies appeared on earth 
man achieved a triple transformation, 
passing from a state of nature to cul- 
ture, from sentiment to knowledge, and 
from an animal-like state to that of 
humanity (which is precisely what 
Rousseau set out to prove in his Dis- 
course on Inequality) we can do so 
only by attributing to man in his very 
earliest primitive condition some vital 
faculty or quality which impelled him 
to make this threefold transition. . 
And we must consequently assume 
that from the very start this quality 
latently possessed both contradictory 
elements at least as attributes if not 
as intrinsic parts, so that it was at 
one and the same time both natural 
and cultural, emotional and rational, 
animal and human. We -must also 
assume that the transition could be 
made from one to the other providing 
this quality became conscious in man's 
mind. 
This quality, as Rousseau repeatedly 
stated, is pity which issues from man’s 
identification with another—not just a 
relative or a companion or a com- 
patriot, but with any man because he 
is a man; and indeed with any living 
creature because it is alive. 
Early man thus began by intuitively 
feeling himself identical with all his 
fellow beings. And he never wholly 
forgot this feeling even when the rise 
of population forced him to migrate 
to new lands and to adapt himself to 
new modes of living, and led him to 
the awakening of his own identity. 
But this awakening came only after 
he had slowly learned to recognize 
the identity of others and to distinguish 
the various animals according to their 
species, the human state from the ani- 
mal state, and his own individuality 
from the individuality of other men. 
The recognition that all men and 
animals are feeling beings (which is 
what identification signifies) long ante- 
dated man's awareness of their differ-

ences: first with regard to the char- 
acteristics common to all living 
creatures, and only later to the human 
as opposed to non-human attributes. 
It is with this bold conclusion that 
Rousseau put an end to Descarte's 
doctrine of the Cogito. 
Rousseau's thought thus evolved 
from two principles: identification with 
another, even the most removed 
“other” of all others including 
creatures of the animal world; and the 
rejection of identification with oneself, 
that is to say the rejection of every- 
thing which might make the self seem 
“worthy”. These two attitudes are 
complementary, the second actually 
being the springboard for the first: | 
am not “me” but the weakest and 
humblest of “others”. Herein lies the 
true originality of the Confessions. 
I. Rousseauist revolution, 
as a forerunner and beginning of the 
anthropological revolution, lies in the 
repudiation of forced identifications— 
either of a culture with its own culture, 
or of an individual member of a culture 
with a public figure or réle which that 
culture seeks to impose upon him. 
In both cases the culture and the 
individual assert their right to free 
identification, and this can only be 
achieved beyond man, ie. with ali 
living and therefore suffering crea- 
tures; and also before the public figure 
or role, i.e. with a being as such and 
not one already shaped and classified. 
In this way the “I” and the “he”, 
freed from the distinction that only 
philosophy has sought to encourage, 
are once again united and merged. 
With their original unity thus restored 
at last, they can forge together the 
us against the them, that is, against 
society antagonistic and inimical to 
man, and which man is the more easily 
prepared to reject since Rousseau, by 
his own example, has taught him how 
to escape the intolerable contradictions 
of civilized life. 
For though it is true that man has 
been expelled by nature and that 
society continues to oppress him, he 
can at least reverse the extremes of 
the dilemma to his own advantage by 
seeking the society of nature in order 
to meditate on the nature of society. 
This, it seems to me, is the lasting 
message of the Social Contract, the 
Letters on Botany and the Reveries... 
But it is today, for all of us who have 
come to experience Rousseau’s pre- 
diction to his readers of “the terror of 
those unfortunates who will live after 
you,” that his thoughts tower to their 
full height and reveal the broad sweep 
of their horizons... 
In this world more cruel to man 
perhaps than it has ever been, charged 
with extermination in every form, mas- 
sacre and torture not always dis- 
avowed no doubt but comfortably dis- 
missed by us as no longer important 
since they were confined to far-off 
people who we were told suffered for 
our good or at any rate in our name— 
in this universe of ours become 
smaller, more drawn together as our 
members steadily augment and with no 
fragment of humanity left safe from 
insidious attack—the anguish of living 
in society weighs on us all. 
It is today, | repeat, because he put 
civilization on trial, pointing a finger 
at its iniquities and abuses and denied 
that these could possibly lead to the 
exercise of virtue in man, that Rous- 
seau can help us to shatter an illusion 
the deadly effects of which we are 
now able alas to observe in ourselves 
and on ourselves. For is it not because 
of the myth of the exclusive dignity 
of human nature that nature itself

suffered its first mutilation, followed 
inevitably by other mutilations? 
Never in the course of the past four 
centuries has western man been in a 
better position to realize that by 
arrogating to himself the right to raise 
a wall dividing mankind from the beast 
in nature, and appropriating to himself 
all the qualities he denied the latter, 
he set in motion an infernal cycle. 
For this same wall was to be pulled 
steadily tighter, serving to set some 
men apart from other men and to 
justify in the minds of an ever-shrinking 
minority their claim to being the only 
civilization of men. Such a civilization, 
based as it was on the principle and 
notion of self-conceit, was corrupt from 
the very start. 
Only Rousseau raised his voice 
against this type of egotism. In the 
footnote to the Discourse previously 
quoted, Rousseau recounts that, from 
the clumsy descriptions made by 
travellers, he preferred to recognize 
the great apes of Africa and Asia as 
men of an unknown race rather than 
run the risk of denying human nature 
to creatures who might possess it. 
For the only hope that each of us 
can have that we shall not be treated 
one day as beasts by our fellow-men 
is for all our fellow-men, we first 
amongst them, to look upon ourselves 
at once as suffering beings, nurturing 
within us that faculty for pity which in 
nature replaces “laws, morals and 
virtue,” and without which, as we are 
now coming to realize, there can be no 
law, no morals and no virtue in society. 
|. may well be that this 
teaching was already contained in the 
great religions of the Far East. But in 
the traditions of the West where, ever 
since antiquity, it was thought that 
one could play a double game and 
tamper with the evidence that man 
was a living and a suffering being, 
no different from all other beings 
before secondary factors distinguish- 
ed him from them, who else but Jean- 
Jacques Rousseau has made this mes- 
sage available to us? 
“! have a violent aversion,” Rous- 
seau wrote in his fourth letter to 
Monsieur de Malesherbes, “to social 
orders that dominate others. | hate the 
Great, | hate their condition.” Does 
not this assertion apply first to man 
who has sought to dominate other 
living creatures and maintain a separ- 
ate state, thereby giving the least 
honourable of men freedom to do the 
same to other men and to take advan- 
tage of a notion as disgraceful in this 
latter instance as it was in the earlier 
broad context. 
In a cultivated society there can be 
no excuse for the only really inexpiable 
crime of man, that of considering him- 
self abidingly or momentarily superior, 
or treating men as objects, be it for 
reasons of race, culture, conquest, 
or merely expediency.

CUNEIFORM SCRIPT 
BORN FROM THE POINT OF A REED 
The Sumerians in Lower Mesopotamia 
rank with the Egyptians, the Cretans 
and the Chinese as the earliest inventors 
of an efficient system of writing. They 
took the first step from the pictographic 
to the syllabic system and thus helped 
to develop writing as we know it today. 
About 3000 B.C., the Sumerians made 
seals, used as property marks, and then 
employed word-signs picturing the object 
referred to. These original "pictographs” 
were then given phonetic values result- 
ing in a greater descriptive precision. 
This was now a “rebus-writing”, a 
word that was difficult to render picto- 
rially being shown by the sign for another 
word with the same or similar sound. It 
thus became possible to write almost 
any combination of spoken words. By 
2500 B.C., the writing had evolved into 
a few wedge-shaped strokes from which 
the name “cuneiform” is taken. It was 
written on tablets of damp clay with a 
stylus—often the sharpened point of a 
reed. Babylonians and Assyrians—and 
later the Hittites and Persians—took 
over the cuneiform script from the 
Sumerians and adapted it to their own 
languages. Sometimes an explanatory pic- 
ture was included in the writing to guide 
the illiterate. But pictures and script now 
had no need of each other. Reading and 
writing began to spread throughout 
Mesopotamia. 
MYSTERY 
SCRIPTS 
One of the great advances in 
archaeological research in 
the 19th century was the 
decipherment of many an- 
cient languages. Before 
1822, not a word could 
be read of the hieroglyphic 
system of writing of the 
Egyptians, one of the earliest 
used by man. But that year 
the code was cracked, and 
now documents covering 
three millennia of civiliza- 
tion have become an open 
book. The cuneiform scripts 
of the Sumerians, Babylo- 
nians and Assyrians were all 
deciphered during the 189th 
century. Qur own century 
has seen the decipherment of 
two more cuneiform scripts, 
(the Ugaeritic script of Ras 
Shamra, Syria, and that of 
the Hittites) as well as the 
Hittite hieroglyphic script. In 
1953 came the decipher- 
ment of Minoan Linear B. 
To all these results scholars 
in many countries have con- 
tributed. It is to be hoped 
that with the tools of mod- 
ern science, the remaining 
“mystery” languages will one 
day find their decipherers.

In 1908 an Italian mission working at Hagia Triada, near Phaistos, in Crete, brought 
to light a script of which only one example exists. It was inscribed on a flat terra- 
cotta disc about six and a half inches in diameter (left) which was found in an 
outbuilding of the Minoan Palace. Next to it was a broken tablet inscribed with the 
Cretan Linear A script that has been dated to about 1700 B.C. 
On either side of the terra-cofta disc is a text impressed with a hitherto unknown 
form of hieroglyphics arranged in bands spiralling to (or from) the centre. The signs, 
which seem to have been stamped by means of 45 different wooden and metal 
punches, number 241 in all and are divided into 61 groups of characters (which 
might represent words or sentences) separated by vertical lines. The script is 
considered to be a syllabic one: there are too few characters for a pictographic 
script and too many for an alphabetic one. 
Archaeologists and classical scholars have been trying, right from the start, to 
decode this script on the basis of internal evidence. 
The main difficulty is that no-one knows what language the text was written in—it 
has been variously adjudged to be Philistine, Lycian, Carian, Greek, Cypriote, Libyan, 
Anatolian and Semitic—or even whether it was written from right to left, or the 
reverse. J. Chadwick, of Cambridge University, the collaborator of Michael Ventris 
in the decipherment of Minoan Linear B, took the latter view. He drew particular 
attention to the use of punches, and described it as a remarkable anticipation of 
the invention of engraving and printing. [It was hard to believe, as he pointed out, 
that the preparation of the set of 45 punches would have been undertaken solely 
for the production of one disc. Thus, companion pieces may one day be found. 
Some examples of the results achieved by would be decipherers give an idea of 
the hazards involved. An English investigator, in 1933, took the language to be 
Greek, ascribing to each character a syllabic value. Thus one five-character group 
was translated as “Arise, Saviour] Listen, Goddess, Rheall” A Greek scholar favoured 
Semitic, and produced a partial “rendering” in 1948: “Supreme - deity, of the powerful 
thrones star; Supreme - tenderness of the consolatory words; Supreme - donator of the 
prophecies; Supreme - of the eggs the white...”

by Basil Davidson 
| the Negro a man without 
a past? Not many years have passed 
since the outside world took an 
affirmative answer more or less for 
granted. 
But now, in the wake of the colonial 
hurricane, there emerges a new 
approach to the whole question. lt is 
increasingly realized that the cultural 
contributions of African peoples to the 
general history and progress of man- 
kind were not limited to interesting 
works of art, whether in wood or ivory 
or in bronze or gold, but compre- 
hended a wide range of political and 
social achievements that were no less 
important or remarkable because they 
were ignored or little known. 
It is seen, indeed, that these works 
of art that so many Asians and Amer- 
icans and Europeans have admired 
were not the more or less mysterious 
products of a social vacuum, but, on 
the contrary, the ornament and attri- 
bute of early African civilizations, 
These middle years of the 20th 
century may be remembered for many 
troubles and upheavals, and for risks 
and dangers greater than any that 
humanity had ever run before: on the 
side of good they will also be remem- 
bered as the central years of African 
emancipation. And they mean, of 
course, much more than a purely 
political emancipation; they mean, as 
well, an intellectual and moral eman- 
cipation, a breaking down of obstacles 
that have stood between Africans and 
a sense of full equality with the rest 
of the world, and of barriers that have 
helped to isolate these African peoples 
from the general family of man. 
Homo sapiens may first have seen 
the light in central or east Africa. For 
some thirty years now, Africa has 
yielded discovery after discovery 
revolutionizing earlier concepts of the 
remote origins of humanity. 
What now becomes possible is to 
sketch the outline of the comparatively 
recent pre-history and history of large 
regions of Africa: the record, that is, 
of the pre-medieval and medieval 
centuries that came immediately before 
European contact and penetration. 
It is this that is really new-—this 
assertion that Africans went through 
successive, distinctive, and knowable 
phases of growth and development in 
 
BASIL DAVIDSON, British author and jour- 
nalist, has written widely on African affairs. 


### 58727: The Rediscovery of Africa

THE REDISCOVERY 
OF AFRICA 
the fifteen or twenty centuries before 
the European records of Africa became 
frequent and various. Reassessment 
of the African past, in the sense that | 
have spoken of, is essentially the 
unravelling and writing of the history 
of the African Metal Age in the lands 
that lie to the south of the Sahara 
desert. 
Late Stone Age peoples on the 
lower reaches of the Nile, and in 
nearby regions that were much more 
fertile then, thrust their way into 
history in about 3000 B.C., when the 
“first dynasty” of the Pharoahs took 
power in the delta of the Nile. This 
great forward step in northernmost 
Africa, interwoven with the comparable 
achievements of peoples in the Near 
East and the Mediterranean, acted and 
reacted as the centuries went by on 
lands to the south and west. 
Its influence spread southward up 
the Nile and there, reacting on the 
peoples that it found, stimulated and 
helped to create the civilization of 
Kush—of that renowned kingdom of 
Napate and Meroe whose kings and 
queens would rule in more or less 
continuous succession for a thousand 
years after about 800 B.C. 
Its influence also spread westward 
along the southern shores of the Medi- 
terranean: Phoenician Carthage, found- 
ed in the ninth century B.C., helped 
to stimulate and create the Libyco- 
Berber civilizations of northern Africa. 
And, thirdly, these ancient civilizations 
of the Near East and of Egypt pro- 
duced in the southernmost tip of 
Arabia—that Arabia of the Queen of 
Sheba whom Solomon knew and loved 
—another region of high civilization; 
and from southern Arabia this civiliz- 
ation of antiquity despatched its 
settlers and traders and warriors 
across the Red Sea into the Horn of 
Africa, and its mariners and colonists 
down the long east coast of Africa. 
These pioneers and their mastery 
of metal-working and of other material 
techniques did not move into a void. 
They moved into a land that was 
peopled then, if thinly, by several 
branches of the human family to which 
anthropologists have awarded the 
names of Bushman, Negrillo, Hottentot, 
Negro, and Hamite. 
Now the origins of these peoples of 
continental Africa are obscure and 
confused. They too, apparently, had 
moved southward across the continent, 
coming perhaps from outside it, in 
centuries beyond calculation. 
Perhaps the Hottentots—the natives 
whom the first Dutch settlers would 
find at the Cape of Good Hope in 
1652—arrived some time after about 
5000 B.C.—but nothing of this is 
clearly known—the peoples whom we 
know as Negro and Hamite began to 
emerge, multiply, and follow the earlier 
migrants in a generally southward 
direction. 
As they wandered across the con- 
tinent these later peoples, often 
mingling with earlier peoples whom 
they found, worked out new ways of 
living. They invented tropical agri- 
culture. They began to settle and 
raise new crops. They learned how 
to smelt natural copper and make 
primitive tools and weapons of this 
metal. 
A. a time that was shortly 
before or after the beginning of the 
Christian era these peoples of the sou- 
thern continent began to mine and 
smelt iron, and to make more efficient 
tools and weapons; and with this they 
acquired a new and, as it would prove, 
revolutionary control over the material 
environment in which they lived. It is 
from about this time—from about 
2,000 years ago—that the peoples of 
the continental heart of Africa begin 
to multiply and form their present 
major groupings. 
It is from then, as it seems, that the 
largest of all of Africa's existing human 
groups begins to spread into and 
populate the empty or near-empty 
forests and savannahs. This group 
is called the Bantu; but the term has 
little or no racial significance, being a 
linguistic term for all these many 
peoples who speak a closely related 
language. 
Racially the Bantu are the product 
of intermingling over long periods of 
time between Negro and Hamite and 
Bushman and Hottentot. Physically, 
therefore, they vary greatly among 
themselves; but all their languages go 
back, more or less obviously, to a 
common root. We do not know the 
origins of this root. 
Thus it is the last 2,000 years, more 
or less, that emerge as the formative 
period of most of the peoples of conti- 
nental Africa. This is the period of 
their lron Age. Some authorities 
prefer to call this their Metal or Pal- 
aeometallic Age, because, although 
knowledge of ferrous metallurgy was

the decisive influence, African peoples 
also knew the working of several 
other minerals, including gold and 
copper and tin. In time, too, some 
of them worked extensively in brass 
and bronze; but they never knew, as 
ancient Asia and Europe had known, 
a Bronze Age that made a long dis- 
tinctive period of development before 
their [ron Age. 
Now it is in studying this Metal Age 
-—or, more narrowly, the fifteen or 
sixteen centuries before European 
contact along the coast—that present 
research is principally and dramatically 
engaged. Advancing along three dif- 
ferent but related lines, history and 
archaeology and anthropology now 
begin to bring their findings together 
and to offer a coherent picture that 
was invisible only a handful of years 
ago. 
New translations are being projected 
or prepared of several classic works, 
such as the first century A.D. Periplus 
of the Erythraean Sea (in Britain) and 
the 16th century writings on the 
Western Sudan of Leo Africanus (in 
France). The Central African Ar- 
chives (of the Federation of Central 
Africa) is collaborating with Arquivo 
Historico de Mozambique in the editing 
and publication of some 15,000 hitherto 
unpublished documents from the librar- 
ies of Goa, Lisbon, and the Vatican; 
and these should throw much new light 
on early European contacts. 
Joseph Needham, in his monumental 
study of the history of science in 
China, has meanwhile devoted part of 
his sixth volume to Chinese maritime 
technology, and, in so doing, has 
 
shown how great was the Chinese 
contribution to that Indian Ocean trade 
which had its western terminals on the 
East African coast. 
| the past few years, 
African archaeology has had important 
successes. Mauny and Thomassey 
have gone far towards completing the 
excavation of the ancient city of Kumbi 
Saleh, probable site of the capital of 
medieval Ghana. J.P. Lebeuf and An- 
nie Masson-Detourbet have uncovered 
the remarkable bronze-using civiliza- 
tion of the Sao people of early medie- 
val Chad. Jean Vercoutter, in the Su- 
dan, has completed a preliminary list 
of sites of the imposing civilization of 
Kush. Other French specialists have 
continued the investigation of early 
Ethiopia. 
In East Africa, Gevase Mathew and 
G.S.P. Freeman-Grenville have listed 
ancient and medieval sites on the 
coast of Kenya and Tanzania, while 
1.8. Kirkman has excavated the late 
medieval ruins of Gedi, near the 
Kenyan port of Malindi. Further to 
the north, in Somaliland, Enrico Cerulli 
and Vinigi Grottanelli have thrown 
important light on early settlements 
and migrations on the coast and coast- 
al islands. 
Coins and durable imports such as 
china offer hopeful means of dating 
these many stone ruins of the coast 
and interior. “I have never in my 
life," remarked Sir Mortimer Wheeler, 
the British archaeologist, after a fort- 
"and fall of dynasties and powers. 
night's visit to Tanganyika in 1955, 
“seen so much broken china as 
| have seen in the past fortnight 
along the coast here and the Kilwa 
Islands: literally, fragments of Chinese 
porcelain by the shovelful... In fact, I 
think it is fair to say that as far as the 
Middle Ages are concerned, from the 
tenth century onwards, the buried 
history of Tanganyika is written in 
Chinese porcelain.” 
To the southward there is fresh effort 
at uncovering the story of another 
great complex of stone ruins—forts and 
huts and vast hillside terrace systems 
—that stretch over several thousands 
of square miles in Southern Rhodesia 
and neighbouring lands. Roger Sum- 
mers has lately completed an initial 
survey of the stone ruins of Inyanga on 
the Rhodesian-Mozambique border; 
and now, with Keith RB. Robinson, is 
working on the foundations of the great 
walls at Zimbabwe in the hope of find- 
ing out whether those tall ruins were 
built on the site of a previous and more 
humble culture, or whether the first 
settlers were also those who built so 
well in stone. 
We are only at the beginning of this 
search for the history of pre-medieval 
and medieval Africa. Beyond the 
barriers of ignorance we may glimpse 
an historical landscape that is thick 
with cities or strong stone settlements 
and loud with the din of ports and 
ocean-going shipping, that glitters with 
old armies and the pomp of states and 
empires and is restless with the rise 
But 
at present we can only glimpse at this. 
This great task of unravelling the 
African past remains, and must remain, 
an international endeavour. Occa- 
sional conferences on African pre-his- 
tory and history have proved, over the 
past few years, how much can be 
gained from the pooling of knowledge 
and the wide discussion of problems. 
They have stimulated public interest, 
and helped to create an atmosphere 
that is favourable to more intensive 
research. It is to be hoped that they 
are only the forerunners of many 
others of their kind. To this end, 
indeed, Unesco can powerfully con- 
tribute.

MASTER-WORKS OF 
STONE AGE JAPAN 
Archaeological excavations in Japan 
have uncovered two remarkable 
types of ancient clay sculptured 
figures. The oldest are the “Dogu” 
clay images which date from as far 
back as 3000 B.C. They have 
squat bodies, flattened heads and 
vigorous expressions and may have 
been used as a kind of family icon 
by Japan’s Stone Age hunters and 
fishermen. More recent are the 
“Haniwa"“ terra-cotta figurines 
produced from the third to sixth 
centuries A.D. They were placed In 
circles on the slopes of burial 
mounds, hence their name (Hani= 
clay, wa = circle). When made for 
the tombs of men of rank, the 
Haniwa were often mass produced, 
most of them being cylinders to 
surround the burial mound. 
Hundreds and sometimes thousands 
were needed and were made 
rapidly by clay workers normally 
engaged in making earthenware 
vessels. The Dogu and Haniwa 
figures have a remarkable vigour 
and freshness.

THE 
I. profoundest, most com- 
pelling impulses of South African 
society have always been, and still 
are, toward amalgamation. This is 
perhaps the fact least frequently noted 
about South Africa even by those most 
opposed to the doctrine of apartheid; 
but it is a fact which | think ought to 
be set down straightaway not only 
because it is true and evidence can be 
adduced to support it, but because a 
great deal of the legislative programme 
of the Nationalist Party Government 
since 1949 cannot be properly under- 
stood without taking this fact into 
account. 
It has also become fashionable in 
writing about South Africa to empha- 
size the incompatibility of black and 
white interests; yet left to their own 
devices the races have always tended 
to move closer, albeit unconsciously, 
toward . some form of integration. 
Surely the most glaring proof of this 
fact lies in the economic sphere; but 
less obvious is a similar impulse at 
work in the social sphere, which, 
however denied and deeply buried, 
continues to reaffirm itself and to agi- 
tate toward complete expression. 
That the blacks suffer untold hard- 
ships as a price for the maintenance 
of the policy of apartheid is a fact 
that cannot be denied even by the 
proponents of apartheid. 
What is not always noted is that, 
though economically exploitative as 
a ruling class, the whites are aiso 
subject to certain very real deprivations 
as a result of their determination to 
live by a policy which would seem 
to afl reasonable men not only unrealis- 
tic but insane. 
To say the very least, South African 
whites are the most culturally deprived 
community in Africa. Emotionally they 
are just as stunted. 
They not only grow up denying their 
innermost dreams, they also learn to 
do without some of the best works of 
modern world culture (in literature, 
music, painting and intellectual 
discourse) either because such works 
are considered subversive, or because 
traffic in culture with the outside world 
is rendered almost impossible by the 
maintenance of the policy of apartheid. 
It must be remembered that a great 
number of people active in the cultural 
area are either non-white or white 
people strongly opposed to a doctrine 
of apartheid. Thus the white commu-. 
nity in South Africa is becoming almost 
as isolated in its privileged position as 
are the blacks without privileges; for 
LEWIS NKOSI of South Africa was exiled 
by the South African Government in 1960. 
He is now consulting editor of “The New 
African™, published in London. 


### 58728: The Forbidden dialogue

FORBIDDEN DIALOGUE 
not only must the blacks not see Harry 
Belafonte with a white girl in his arms 
in “Island in the Sun” but the whites 
must not see Tony Curtis chained to 
Sidney Poitier in the film, “The Defiant 
Ones”. 
Indeed, a great number of mod- 
ern works of the best kind in the 
post-war cinema are kept out of the 
Republic of South Africa. The banning 
of books and plays thought to be con- 
troversial is too well-known to need 
reiteration. Under these circumstances 
it would be surprising if the growth of 
an indigenous South African culture 
was not hampered and it would be 
surprising indeed if the fostering of 
standards on a par with the rest of the 
world was not made almost impossible. 
It seems to me that both black 
and white writers are severely impo- 
verished by the limitations as well as 
the schism existing in South African 
national life. 
For a black writer too much of his 
emotional response is absorbed into 
formulating his attitude toward apart- 
heid or finding his place in the revo- 
lutionary struggle; no matter where he 
goes later on and no matter how bored 
he is with politics he cannot be free 
of the tragic burden of South Africa 
until that country has freed its 
14,000,000 non-whites. 
|. seems to me that the 
blacks in South Africa, no matter how 
deprived economically or politically, 
have a graver, far more responsible 
attitude toward life. Where white 
South Africans must manufacture 
dreams and fantasies in order to 
maintain some equilibrium between 
what they really are and what they 
think they are, the blacks have to 
learn quite early to strip themselves 
of every illusion. Co 
We all know what happens to people 
who cannot face up to the reality of 
their lives, who must live by evasions 
and fantasies; a greater burden is 
placed on writers or any other kind of 
artist who belongs to such a commun- 
ity. Before they go on to create 
anything of value they must make an 
extraordinary effort to unlearn every- 
thing they have been taught. 
In South Africa, they must, for 
instance unlearn what they are taught 
in schools: that the whites, from their 
forefathers to the present generation, 
are all heroes, that the whites have the 
monopoly on moral wisdom and intel- 
lectual enterprise; the pain and the 
anguish which attends the creative 
efforts of Afrikaans writers at the mo- 
ment is not a matter for cynical amuse- 
ment. tis an agony of creative artists 
who must break through a sealed 
by Lewis Nkosi 
cocoon in order to see the world in its 
variousness or even to say something 
remotely relevant to their country. 
Black writers do not have to make 
any comparable moral choice; they do 
not have to choose to oppose a system 
which is patently contrary to all ob- 
servable reality; their colour makes the 
choice for them; what they have to do 
is learn to survive the system. 
There are times when an affirmation 
of certain traditional African values 
proves exasperatingly difficult for 
black writers since most of them are 
reacting to an ideology which asserts 
again and again that black and white 
people are irreconcilably different; 
that the African mind cannot grasp 
certain nuances of European thought; 
and, concluding. from the foregoing, 
that apartheid is justifiable, indeed, 
the only realistic policy to follow. 
The result has been that black 
intellectuals in South Africa have had 
to bend over backwards to prove that 
they can not only master the modes 
of European thought but that they can 
beat the South African whites at their 
own game. 
Urban African music seems to me 
to have provided the only example of 
what South Africa can offer culturally 
if she were left to develop in a natural 
direction. 
Music, because it is non-literal, is 
not subject to the same limitations as 
literature; it is hardly banned; also it 
is less self-conscious in the modes 
it adopts to express the agony of the 
South African situation. The result 
has been that popular urban African 
music has provided a glaring paradigm 
of what is happening to the under- 
ground life of the nation. 
The music is predominantly African, 
which is as it should be, considering 
the dominant numbers of Africans in 
the country; but it is also eclectic; it 
provides a moving illustration of cultur- 
al diffusion in that part of the 
continent which offers us the best 
laboratory for the marriage of African 
and European techniques and for the 
coming together of European and Afri- 
can modes of expression. 
While black literature from the 
Republic offers us glimpses into an 
appalling situation of rare brutality and 
anguish, the music not only shows 
us this but goes further to affirm what 
we should have known all along; that 
the oppressed in South Africa also 
display an amazing form of resilience, 
emotional certitude and optimism. On 
the other hand, apartheid deprives 
white South Africans of any real parti- 
cipation in such robust forms of cultu- 
ral expression.

the weight by drinking 100 litres in 10 minutes. 


### 58729: The Camel, facts and fables

THE CAMEL, FACTS AND FABLES 
Lion has it that the camel can cross the most 
scorching desert without water or food. Until recently, many 
common questions could not be answered by science, such as: 
How long can a camel go without water? Does the camel store 
water in its body? What is the function of the camel's hump? 
It was therefore natural that Unesco, among. other institutions, 
supported an expedition to find answers to many of these 
problems. Our field studies were carried out in the Algerian 
Sahara, at Beni Abbes, in 1953-54. 
How long a camel can live without drinking water depends 
on external conditions: amount of food eaten and its water con- 
tent, the load the camel carries, how far it travels, temperature, 
and also the breed of the camel and its condition. One therefore 
cannot say that any camel can do without water for a certain 
number of days. 
We soon found that camels grazing in winter were usually not 
watered at all. If it rains the desert vegetation contains a good 
deal of water. We examined a number of such camels. After 
being without water for one of two months they showed no interest 
in water whatsoever. 
However, in dry winters the camels would undoubtedly have to 
be watered. To find out how much water a camel needs we 
fed them dry hay and dry dates for periods of up to 16 days in 
January. After this, they were rather thirsty but in no serious 
condition. Each camel lost weight corresponding to the amount 
of water used up. After 16 days it drank an amount corresponding 
to the expenditure, bringing the body weight back to normal. 
In summer we kept a camel without water for eight days and 
it lost 100 kg. When allowed to drink it consumed 103 litres 
of water in 10 minutes. Another camel was without water for 
17 days. Both animals lost their appetite, looked thin and 
emaciated, the muscles were shrunken and the legs scrawny. They 
would not have been fit for heavy work or long distance travel. 
These two camels were exposed to the hot desert wind and 
sun but they had not worked. Judging from this experiment, 
even the best camels could not be used for desert travel without 
water beyond a week in summer. 
Many travellers have suggested that the water tolerance of 
the camel is explained by a storage of water in the stomach or 
other parts of the body. We observed no instance in which 
a camel drank an excess of water that could be regarded as 
storage. The belief comes from the fact that the camel has 
a stomach divided into several compartments, the largest of 
which is the rumen containing the coarsely masticated fodder. 
The camel's rumen contains large quantities of fluid but so do 
all ruminants. We analyzed this fluid and found that although 
it is rather unappetizing it could very well be used for drinking 
in an emergency. Thus the tale of the Arab who saves his life 
by killing his camel to drink the water in its stomach may be 
true. The mistake is in implying that the fluid is stored water. 
Some people have stated that the camel's hump contains 
the camel's water reservoir. But the hump is almost exclusively 
fat and is an energy storage as it is in other animals. Although 
the hump does not contain water, there is a grain of truth in 
the belief that the camel gets water from the hump. Whenever 
organic material is burned water is formed in the process. 
When man is exposed to the hot desert he avoids a rise in 
body temperature by sweating. The camel also regulates its 
temperature by sweating but can vary this temperature and save 
on the amount of water needed to keep cool. It allows its body 
temperature to rise slowly until almost 41 °C. without losing much 
water. During the cool night it gives off heat so that its morning 
temperature may be as low as 34 °C. 
The camel can tolerate losing as much as 30 per cent of its 
body weight during water deprivation in the hot desert. A camel 
that has lost 50 litres of water (20 per cent weight loss) reduces 
its blood volume less than one litre. The rest of the water 
comes from the tissues and tissue fluids. This places the camel 
in a much better position than other mammals in which thick- 
ening of the blood is the main cause of explosive heat death.

Jorge Carrera Andrade 
Tene are many paradoxes 
in history, and one of the strangest 
is surely that the Incas, who had never 
heard of the wheel, should have built 
the greatest road system the world 
has known. Their network of high- 
ways covered some 10,000 miles, 
stretching from Colombia all the way to 
Chile and from the shores of the Pacific 
to jungle forests of the Amazon, criss- 
crossing almost all the territory now 
included in the Republics of Ecuador 
and Peru, as well as portions of Bolivia, 
Chile, northern Argentina and southern 
Colombia. 
The Inca Empire began as a tiny 
kingdom on the shores of Lake Titicaca 
about the year 1,000 AD. For five 
hundred years it grew and expanded 
until, after conquering the Kingdom of 
Quito, it was the most powerful civi- 
lization of South America and adopted 
the name "Land of the Four Quarters 
of the World” (Tahuantinsuyu) to 
signify its control of the four cardinal 
points of the compass. 
JORGE CARRERA ANDRADE of Ecuador is a 
leading poet and author of Latin America. 
The Inca road system was built to 
preserve the unity and safeguard the 
economic life of the Empire. lts con- 
struction is one of the wonders of 
human history, defying all natural 
obstacles in one of the most rugged 
terrains existing anywhere in the world. 
Though far less known than the cele- 
brated roads of Rome and other 
ancient empires, the Inca highways are 
in many ways even more remarkable. 
The backbone of the network was a 
broad highway—the “Great Royal Road 
of the Incas™—running the entire length 
of the Inca Empire from north to south, 
between the two branches of the for- 
midable Andean mountain range. In 
certain places the road rose sharply 
to as much as 15,000 feet; in others it 
dropped steeply in mountain valleys 
and gorges, traversed broad fertile 
plains and bleak stretches of desert 
wasteland. 
From the main highway branch roads 
cut through the mountains in all direc- 
tions, especially to the west, where 
they linked up with another mighty 
highway known as the "Coastal Road”, 
which ran parallel to the Great Royal 
Road along the sandy coastal plains 
and forests from Tumbez to the north 
of Chile where it joined up with it. 
It should not be imagined that the 
Inca roads were mere mountain tracks 
or desert trails. The Great Royal 
Highway was 25 feet in width and ran 
straight as an arrow, without curves or 
detours of any kind, for 3,000 miles— 
more than the distance between 
Gibraltar and Moscow! Paved with 
stones along almost its entire length, 
it traversed only the principal cities of 
the empire, like Cuzco and Quito, the 
other towns being linked up with the 
Royal Highway by secondary roads.

### 58730: The Royal highway of the Incas

THE 
ROYAL 
HIGHWAY 
OF THE 
INCAS 
On both sides of the highway the 
Incas built walls of stone and packed 
earth on top of which they planted 
agave cactuses at regular intervals. In 
addition rows of trees lined the road to 
provide shade for travellers. Living in 
a bleak landscape the Incas attached 
great importance to their trees and the 
empire enacted stringent laws for their 
preservation. The penalty for cutting 
them down was death. 
Aone the side of the 
Great Royal Road ran a rivulet of fresh 
water to quench the thirst of both 
wayfarers and draft animals. At 
intervals of about twelve miles along 
the entire stretch of 3,000 miles there 
were wayside houses known as tampus 
where travellers could rest or spend 
the night. There were also chains of 
granaries and royal depots stocked 
with food and all kinds of supplies for 
the army, including clothing and leather 
footwear. Grain and manufactured 
products were stored in huge earthen 
jars. Strangers were accommodated 
with the utmost hospitality in hostelries 
called corpahuasis and were provided 
with food and drink free of charge. 
Every mile or so along the Royal 
Route the Incas built edifices for a 
special category of imperial function- 
aries, the chasquis or relay couriers, 
who raced on foot from one end of 
the kingdom to the other bearing royal 
messages by word of mouth. Some- 
times messages were conveyed by 
specially painted sticks or beans 
painted in various colour combinations 
which had specific meanings. The 
Incas resorted to these devices since 
they had no written language.

### 58730: The Royal highway of the Incas

12 
INCA HIGHWAY (Continued) 
This postal service was so efficient 
that it covered the 3,000 odd miles of 
the Great Royal Highway in a matter 
of 20 days or so—four times faster 
than the “pony express” service intro- 
duced by the Spaniards after the 
Conquest. In the best season of the 
year, the Chasquis covered the dis- 
tance between Cuzco and Quito in five 
days—a feat they continued to perform 
clandestinely during the Colonial era 
to the amazement of the Spaniards 
who dubbed this fleet-footed news- 
transmission system "post office of the 
sorcerers.” 
The astounding network of Andean 
roads and highways was the achieve- 
ment of three Inca emperors: Pacha- 
cutec, Tupac Yupanqui and Huayna 
Cépac, the manpower for the con- 
struction work coming from the tribes 
of peoples they subdued. 
Pachacutec, know as the “Reformer,” 
was particularly fond of stone and for 
the Royal Highway he had enormous 
blocks of stone tranported hundreds of 
miles, particularly from the Kingdom of 
Quito, using the Indians of that region 
and a tribe called the Chancas. 
The treatment meted out by the 
imperial guards (they were called Big- 
Ears) was such that the Indians finally 
revolted and almost overthrew the Inca 
kingdom. The earliest chroniclers 
relate how the huge stones (some 
weighing 10 tons) were carried such 
great distances and tell a story of how 
one such block fell and crushed a 
thousand Indians to death. It passed 
into legend as “the stone that wept 
blood.” 
Fifty years after the Conquest, a 
Spanish missionary, José de Acosta, 
visited the New World and noted that 
the Indians who worked on the roads 
¥ used no mortar, had neither iron nor 
steel for cutting and working the 
stones, no machines or instruments for 
transporting them, yet so skilful was 
their work that the joints between the 
stones were barely noticeable.” 
Tapac Yupanqui was the son of Pa- 
chacutec and carried on his father's 
work. He extended the Royal Highway 
as far as Chile in the south and beyond 
Quito in the north, thus opening up new 
territories for trade and development. 
To consolidate the empire he built a 
chain of fortresses near the Great 
Highway, and instituted a system of 
“population transfers,” shifting newly 
conquered tribes to Peru and replacing 
them by loyal subjects. 
Huayna Capac, his successor, sur- 
passed his father in the field of public 
works. He built Temples of the Sun 
and Inca Watchtowers along the Royal 
Highway. He repaired the old roads 
and built new ones, and had platforms 
and terraces made to prevent erosion 
of the soil. 
But above all, Huayna Céapac was 
responsible for the repair, strength- 
ening and consolidation of the suspen- 
sion bridges. These bridges are one 
of the greatest feats of the Inca road 
network. They appear frail and deli- 
cate but proved astonishingly resistant. 
Flung across raging torrents and formi- 
dable mountain chasms, they were 
made of six-inch fibre and bamboo 
cables anchored into stone piers, and 
were covered with a floor of wooden 
laths solidly lashed together to resist 
the wind and other ravages of the 
elements. 
Alexander von Humboldt was one of 
the many explorers who gazed in awe 
and amazement at the Inca suspension 
bridges. His description of one of 
them—the Bridge of San Luis Rey— 
was the source of inspiration for novels 
by Thornton Wilder and Prosper Méri- 
mée. Humboldt considered the whole 
Inca road system far superior to that 
built by the Romans in Italy, France 
and Spain, and pronounced them "the 
most stupendous and useful works ever 
executed by man.” 
But the Incas’ passion for roads went 
much further than building and engin- 
eering. They also set up a smooth 
running system of road maintenance. 
A "Royal Commissioner of Inca Roads 
and Bridges" supervised a staff of road 
inspectors whose duty it was to tour 
the realm and check on road conditions 
and on the toll-gate keepers controlling 
the heavy traffic of llama trains laden 
with produce. 
Large crews of yanakonas were 
always on hand to sweep and clean 
the paved highways with brooms made 
of vegetable fibre. Yvar Lissner did 
not exaggerate when he said (in his 
book How Our Ancestors Lived) that 
at the time when the roads of Europe 
were no more than muddy, pot-holed 
ditches, the Incas had the finest 
highways anywhere in the world. 
C conan Pedro Cieza de 
Leon, writing between 1533 and 1545, 
was the first European to give a 
detailed description of the Inca roads 
“which surpass those of the Romans 
as well as the road Hannibal built over 
the Alps.” 
As they penetrated the land of the 
Incas, the Conquistadores stared at the 
scene they saw with incredulous 
amazement: down the wide, spacious 
highway came groups of Indians 
carrying hammocks or litters contain- 
ing personages of note. Other Indians 
drove trains of llamas laden with sacks 
of coca leaves or ears of corn. The 
very sight of these animals—half ewe, 
half ass—left the Spaniards open- 
mouthed. 
It soon became clear to them why 
the roads were in such excellent condi- 
tion: the only traffic on its paved 
surface consisted of sandal-shod 
pedestrians and gentle-footed llamas. 
Later, when the Conquistadores landed 
horses in the country (the Incas had 
never seen any before) their iron-shod 
hooves and the wheels of the .heavy 
oxcarts were to cause havoc to the 
Llama Road and irreparably damage 
the Great Royal Highway of the Incas.

Their conquest completed, however, 
the Spaniards realized the advantages 
of the Inca road system and tried to 
preserve it by following the Indian 
example, at least in part. They adopted 
the llama caravans for carting off the 
gold they collected either as booty or 
tribute or which they extracted from the 
mines. 
The Inca road system was thus not 
only an artery of blood but also of the 
gold of South America which went to 
raise the standard of life of Europe and 
to add splendour to the Renaissance. 
The Royal Highway of the Incas, 
which cannot be dissociated from the 
llama, the postal network, the granaries 
and roadside inns, was in fact the 
direct instrument in the economic 
expansion of the Inca State (Inca 
society vested the entire wealth of the 
soil and sub-soil in the State and there 
was no private ownership of land).

### 58730: The Royal highway of the Incas

As a result of the later neglect of the 
Spaniards, the inefficiency of Colonial 
organization, the ravages of time and 
above all, the excesses of the enco- 
menderos (settlers) who used the Inca 
roads as a quarry for the stone they 
sought for their building, the whole 
highway network finally disintegrated. 
Nevertheless, traces of this unparallel- 
ed feat of engineering still remain 
today. 
The Azuay region of Ecuador pro- 
vides proof of the amazing solidity of 
the Inca Highway and of the skill with 
which the stones were fitted together. 
Despite the passing of centuries, and 
notwithstanding the continual, torrential 
rains prevalent in the area, water has 
not succeeded in filtering through the 
joints between the stones. Instead, the 
water has hollowed out a channel 
beneath the stones and flows away 
like a river under the arches of a bridge. 
Further evidence of the Incas’ skill, 
foresight and practical turn of mind is 
seen in their secondary roads which 
served as supply lines for the products 
vital to the kingdom. Thus Huayna 
Capac built a road from Quito to the 
Coca valley in the eastern slopes of the 
Andes for the transport of the prized 
coca leaves; another road knifed 
throught the mountains to the coast and 
became the supply route for shrimp 
and other sea food. 
This coastal road also supplied 
platinum, mined in the region, and salt 
extracted from the nearby island of 
Amortajada close to the coast of 
Ecuador. Another road, running later- 
ally from Cuzco to the coast, made it 
possible to have fresh fish (considered 
one of the greatest delicacies) in the 
Inca capital within two days. 
A striking example of the 
ingenuity and foresight of the Inca 
engineers is visible today near Macu- 
sani in the Carabaya gold country 
north-west of Lake Titicaca. In his 
book on the Inca roads, Highway of 
the Sun, Victor von Hagen describes 
how the Royal Road climbs to a 
dizzying height of 14,800 feet and then 
passes under a glacier. 
“Here,” he writes, “the engineers, 
anticipating the glacier’'s movement, 
had raised a retaining wall to catch the 
cascading rocks and to divert the 
snows high above the road. Here and 
there the eternal sweep and retreat of 
the glacier had sent rock crashing into 
and destroying a part of the road, but 
generally speaking it was in a good 
state of preservation.” 
Despite the passing of centuries and 
the inclemencies of nature, the general 
lines of the Royal Inca Highway can still 
be discerned and stretches of it are 
still intact. The suspension bridges in 
particular have withstood the assault 
of time and are to be seen in Ecuador, 
Peru and Bolivia where they are in 
use in districts where the wheel is still 
unknown even today.

are so steep, local legend goes, that 
farmers seed them by shotgun. 
Only one peasant in three could read 
or write. Alcoholism was common, and 
as often as not Saturday night in a 
taberna ended in a brawl with the 
principals finishing in the hospital. 
Father Salcedo believed there was no 
point in preaching sermons against the 
tabernas; instead, he decided to com- 
pete with them. 
In August of 1947 on the village 
square of Sutatenza, he introduced the 
people of the village to the motion- 
picture screen. They thought they 
were in another world; long after the 
show ended, they huddled enchanted 
around the projector to stare respect- 
fully. 
Father Salcedo had gained a foot- 
hold. To consolidate it, he drew up 
plans for a permanent theatre. The 
village of Sutatenza offered its help, 
but it was not enough and there was 
no way of making a general appeal to 
the parish for volunteer masons and 
carpenters... not until Father Salcedo, 
who had built his first radio at the age 
of 13, turned to his amateur transmitter. 
In May of 1948, Radio Sutatenza 
made its first broadcast, which was 
picked up by only three receivers. 
The priest asked campesinos to help 
him build the Sutatenza theatre and 
promised to record the voice of every 
man who aided him. Soon he was 
broadcasting the campesinos’ own 
voices back to their amazed families 
and sixty men a day were coming to 
Sutatenza to work on the theatre, 
bringing materials with them—and 
money when they could. 
W ITH the theatre finished, 
Father Salcedo sought the help of the 
campesinos in developing what was to 
become the radio school. One day, 
the radio announced that farmers could 
make their contributions in chickens. 
Father Salcedo received more than 800 
and had to hire a truck to haul them 
to market in Bogota. Money was also 
forthcoming, and by 1949, he was able 
to buy a 250-watt transmitter. There 
were enough radios for fifteen schools 
and the priest started broadcasting an 
educational programme once a week. 
Seven years later Father Salcedo's 
home-made transmitter had been trans- 
formed into Accion Cultural Popular, 
one of the world's biggest programmes 
of adult education by radio. 
Accion Cultural Popular broadcasts 
its lessons six hours a day to 200,000 
pupils scattered over twelve of Colom- 
bia's sixteen departments and over- 
flowing into neighbouring Venezuela 
and Ecuador. The radio schools are 
served by 6,000 specially built receiv- 
ers and 10,000 more are on the way. 
Attendance at these remarkable 
schools is expected to rise to 1,000,000. 
The programmes still go on the air 
from Sutatenza, but they are now 
carried by a 25-kilowatt transmitter, the 
most powerful in all Colombia. The 
Colombian Government backs Accion 
Cultural Popular to the amount of 
$800,000 a year and Unesco partici- 
pated through the United Nations tech- 
nical assistance programme. 
Besides the studios and the trans- 
mitter in the transformed village of 
Sutatenza, Accion Cultural Popular 
now occupies most of the seventh 
floor of the biggest office building in 
Bogota. From an office with a pano- 
ramic view of the mountains of Gua- 
delupe and Monserrate, Father Sal- 
cedo (1) continues to direct its work. 
asked Father Salcedo how 
he could explain the phenomenal 
growth of Accion Cultural Popular in 
so short a time. “Any work which 
meets a basic need of the people must 
grow in direct proportion to this need,” 
he replied. “Here, it is the need of 
7,000,000 people in a country of 
12,000,000 for literacy and general cul- 
ture. It is not surprising that the 
number of pupils in the radio schools 
has risen to 200,000.” 
“Some men in education have had 
reserves about our methods,” Father 
Salcedo explained, “but they have now 
come over to our side because we are 
introducing scientifically-tested mate- 
rials in the radio school. It is exactly 
for this reason that we requested 
technical assistance from Unesco—to 
make our teaching methods more 
scientific.” 
The receiving sets used in the radio 
schoolrooms are marvels of simplicity 
—battery-powered short-wave recei- 
vers manufactured specially for Accion 
Cultural Popular. They can be tuned 
to only one station, Radio Sutatenza, 
a precaution taken to preserve the hfe 
of their batteries. Still on the theory 
that culture should not be given away 
for nothing, Accion Cultural Popular 
sells a set and its batteries to a radio 
school at cost price. Each school, 
however, receives a free supply of 
chalk, an eraser, textbooks and an 
alarm clock—so that pupils will know 
when to turn on their set. 
These little sets put in a hard day's 
work in the radio schools, most of them 
nothing more than rooms set aside in 
adobe homes. The house of the most 
educated campesino in a hamlet is 
always chosen for this honour, and its 
owner is given the title of auxiliar 
inmediato. It is this “immediate auxi- 
liary" who takes attendance, turns on 
the radio when school begins, and 
writes lessons on the blackboard 
according to instructions given him by 
the unseen radio teacher.

Cultural Popular, this remote-controlled 
teacher. The auxiliaries are always 
the farmers with the most modern 
ideas in their communities, and the 
distinction of leading the radio schools 
lends them even greater influence as 
forces for bettering the villages. 
Programmes begin at ten minutes to 
six in the morning, the only time that 
most men can spare from their fields. 
Depending on the day of the week, 
the morning programme of one hour 
and twenty-five minutes consists of 
classes in reading and writing, hygiene, 
history, religious instruction or civics, 
always followed by a news broadcast. 
This programme is recorded on tape 
and repeated at 3.50 p.m. for women 
and again at 5 p.m. for any men who 
might have missed the morning class. 
In the evening, Radio Sutatenza is 
on the air from 6.15 p.m. to 9 p.m., but 
school is over. Then it offers music— 
both classical and popular—news, var- 
iety shows, religious talks and a half- 
hour's drama on the theme of history, 
science, travel in Colombia or prob- 
lems affecting farmers. 
The campesinos learn to write and 
they write letters to Accionm Cultural 
Popular. The letters pour in at the 
rate of 150 a day and they are a useful 
key to the popularity of various pro- 
grammes. They also show how deeply 
the radio school has penetrated the 
inaccessible world of the campesino. 
They write about everything. Some 
thank the school for taking them out of 
their solitude or for weaning husbands 
away from tabernas. And some ask 
practical, down-to-earth questions: 
what's good for a bad grippe, how do 
you cure a lame horse, how should 
a common-law couple go about 
marrying, what can be done about a 
disobedient daughter, how can children 
be educated if there is no school avail- 
able, how does a wife get money out 
of a stingy husband. Every letter 
receives a reply, although Accion Cul- 
tural Popular does not pretend to have 
a solution to every question. 
There are only 90-odd 
miles- separating the Tenza Valley 
from what was once the almost- 
deserted village of Belencito in the 
north of Boyaca. In those 90 miles, 
you pass from an oxcart agricultural 
economy to one of the newest steel 
mills in Latin America. At Belencito, 
in the surrealistic shadows of coke 
ovens, conveyor belts and a 270-foot 
high blast furnace, Accion Cultural 
Popular began another experiment in 
radio education, 
The conversion of the campesinos of 
Belencito into steel workers is a dra- 
matic story. The men learned to make 
the transition from the hoe to the 
rolling mill, while their wives adapted 
themselves to an entirely new sort of 
life—that of an ordinary modern 
community.

THE FOUR 
FLOWERS 
OF 
TURKISH 
ART   
The art of the book reached an extraordinary degree of development in Turkey during the 15th and 
16th centuries, with the beauty of the calligraphy equalling that of the illuminations. One theme is always 
found in these works—that of the “four flowers”—the hyacinth, carnation, tulip and briar rose. The 
flower of flowers was the tulip, considered to be sacred since the Arabic letters used to write it in 
Turkish also spell the word God. In a society whose religious scruples forbade portraits on walls, 
Turkish artists confined their portraiture to the pages of albums and poetic works. A remarkable school 
of miniaturists produced this famous portrait of the Sultan Mohammed Il, patron of the arts, inhaling 
the perfume of a rose.

### 58732: Peking Man in the apothecary's shop

16 
PEKING MAN 
IN THE APOTHECARY’S SHOP 
by G. H. R. von Koenigswald 
Neanosamad MAN is the 
only fossil man of whom we have a 
complete skeleton. In the case of all 
older discoveries we have only iso- 
lated remains—mostly of the victims 
of accidents. Thus we find human 
bones in limestones, and buried in 
sandstones, gravels and rock fissures. 
We also find them in medicine 
shops and these “paleontological trea- 
sure houses” are certainly the most 
remarkable of all. | am, of course, 
not talking about just any apothecary 
shops, but about Chinese ones where 
almost anything which the vegetable, 
animal and mineral kingdoms of China 
have to offer can be bought. 
Such remains are used as ingred- 
ients for medicine and, among various 
other medicaments, “dragons’ teeth” 
are highly prized. These are not, 
as their name might suggest, the 
teeth of saurians and other large 
reptiles, but the fossilized remains of 
extinct mammals. It is already over 
a century since specimens of this kind 
gave us our first insight into the fossil 
mammals of China and they have 
since proved to be important links in 
the research chain leading us back 
to fossilized man. 
G.H.R. VON KOENIGSWALD, of the Federal 
Republic of Germany, has done extensive 
research in Indonesia and South China, 
where he made important finds concerning 
Peking Man. He is professor of paleontology 
at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands. 
When | was working as a geologist 
in Java, we became very interested in 
“dragons’ teeth”. Did they, we won- 
dered, come from Java or from China? 
We soon found that they all came 
from China, but when we went into 
the question more closely we found 
that in ancient China there were once 
animals which are still living in Indo- 
nesia. The most surprising example 
was the orang-outang, the large 
anthropoid ape, which still inhabits 
Borneo and northern Sumatra. 
To be absolutely sure that these 
remains came from China, a visit was 
made to Hong Kong in 1935, and 
the large apothecary shops in the 
“Western Market” were thoroughly 
combed. The result was astounding. 
The harvest included teeth of orang- 
outangs, tapirs, the Malayan bear, 
Panda (the friendly Bamboo bears), of 
deers, pigs, tigers and many other 
animals. But not one single jaw 
could we find. Large porcupines had 
gnawed away all the bones and teeth 
roots and only the crowns of teeth 
remained. It was clear that all this 
material must actually have come from 
southern China. 
The largest of all the ape teeth 
found had a smooth surface instead 
of the fine wrinkles found on an 
orang-outang’'s teeth. | immediately 
felt sure that we had come across a 
new type of ape of enormous size. 
Subsequently, in 1935, on the basis 
of this single find | described Gigan- 
topithecus, the giant ape of the Chi- 
nese apothecary shops. 
Some of my colleagues disagreed, 
declaring that the tooth was much too 
large for an ape, and one of them, 
Professor Weidenreich, at first main- 
tained that it was simply that of a very 
large orang-outang. | made further 
journeys to China, and in Canton | 
found a magnificent upper molar, and 
in another apothecary shop in Hong 
Kong an unworn lower molar. In 
certain respects both these teeth 
show much resemblance to the teeth 
of man, and Weidenreich, who had 
been so sceptical at first, completely 
changed his opinion, saying that he 
now considered my Gigantopithecus 
to have been a huge man. One 
German anthropologist even wanted 
to change the name to Giganthropus 
(anthropus—man; pithecus—ape), and 
even made a fantastic reconstruction 
of the jaw bone. 
Finally, 22 years after the discovery 
of the original tooth, we were able 
to reach a more positive conclusion. 
On February 17, 1957, my old friend 
and colleague, Dr. Pei Wen Chung, 
exhibited in Peking an enormous jaw 
which had been found in a cave in 
Kwangsi, in southern China. It was 
a lower jaw with a somewhat less 
specialized anterior dentition than that 
of the living anthropoid apes. But it 
was an ape: the tooth found in the 
Hong Kong chemist’'s shop had not 
lied. 


### 58731: Don Quixote of the radio

DON QUIXOTE OF THE 
To pave the way for this adaptation, 
the aid of Accion Cultural Popular was 
enlisted, and it assigned to Belen- 
cito its former programme director, 
Father Alejandro Rodriguez, the first 
collaborator of Father Salcedo in the 
radio schools of Sutatenza. 
Father Rodriguez first went on the 
air in 1949. In 1951, he received a 
Unesco international fellowship to 
enable him to study the use of the 
radio in adult education in Canada. 
Following his stay in Canada, Father 
Rodriguez travelled to Spain, France 
and England, concentrating on the 
organization of broadcasting and on 
its technical side. Then he went back 
RADIO (Continued from page 74) 
to his microphone in Sutatenza until 
early in 1954 when he left to direct 
Radio Belencito. He started on a mod- 
est scale in the new mill town with a 
1-kilowatt long-wave transmitter. Radio 
Belencito fits into a new network of 
long-wave transmitters established by 
Accion Cultural Popular at widely 
scattered points in Colombia. 
Although Radio Belencito retrans- 
mits certain basic programmes of 
Radio Sutatenza, its objectives are not 
quite the same. In Belencito, Father 
Rodriguez uses the radio to help mould 
a colony of campesinos-turned-steel 
workers into a living community. Be- 
sides its classes, Radio Belencito 
broadcasts programmes for neighbour- 
hood centres in the steel town. The 
radio serves the community as theatre, 
orchestra and forum and, to supple- 
ment it, spare time teachers were 
trained as neighbourhood leaders—the 
urban version of the auxiliar inmediato. 
"Fifty per cent of our workers are 
illiterate,” an official of the Belencito 
steel mill told me. “They learn quickly 
and their mechanical aptitude is high, 
but we want them to understand what 
they are doing and why they are doing 
it. This is extremely important to 
them—and to us. The Colombian eco- 
nomy needs this steel mill and we want 
our workers to be integrated into this 
new aspect of our economy.”

The Kwangsi jaw is larger than that 
of a gorilla, which means that Gigan- 
topithecus itself was larger than this 
ape, the largest and most powerful 
of anthropoid apes living today. My 
Chinese colleagues estimated that it 
must have been at least three metres 
tall. 1 am still getting letters from 
people asking whether Gigantopithe- 
cus might not have been the “abomin- 
able snowman” from the Himalayas, 
and people are very disappointed 
when | have to tell them that | do 
not think so. 
Another discovery was made which, 
although perhaps not so dramatic, 
was no less fruitful. In 1900 a German 
engineer named Haberer brought back 
a large collection of “dragons’ teeth” 
to Germany and our first extensive 
knowledge of the fossil mammals of 
China is based on the description of 
these specimens. The most remark- 
able item was a human tooth, extrem- 
ely worn and apparently very old. 
It too had come from an apothecary 
shop in Peking, and the search for 
the fossilized remains of human 
beings was therefore concentrated on 
this area. 
Ths led to a now celebrated 
event: the discovery of the Peking Man 
(Sinanthropus) of which, in the first 
place, a single tooth had been 
unearthed. This was claimed by Pro- 
fessor Davidson Black to be a hitherto 
unknown fossil man. A skull found 
in 1929 by Dr. Pei, proved that Black 
was right. Successful excavations 
are still being made on the same site. 
The teeth of the Peking Man are 
very large and similar to some of 
those found among our apothecary 
shop specimens from Hong Kong. 
There were also smaller teeth .and 
because of the red clay which was 
found on one part of the jaw, Father 
Teilhard de Chardin (whose name is 
also linked with the discovery of the 
Peking Man) identified it as coming 
from a Late Stone Age horizon which 
Peking Man, a reconstruc- 
tion based on remains 
found in the Choukoutien 
caves near Peking. He 
was capable of chipping 
rough tools and maintain- 
ing fires for warmth and 
protection, and his brain 
was as large as that of 
modern man. (See the 
Unesco-sponsored “History 
of Mankind, Cultural and 
Scientific Development”; 
Volume |: Part 1. “Pre- 
history and the Beginnings 
of Civilization” by Jac- 
quetta Hawkes; G. Allen 
and Unwin Ltd.,, London). 
After Le Gros Clark 
is often to be found in caves. This 
was the jaw of a “modern” man, only 
a few thousand years old. One of the 
teeth is so similar to the first tooth 
found in the Peking apothecary shop 
that both must have come from the 
same strata. [It was, therefore, a 
modern tooth which put us on the 
track of Peking Man! 
The discovery of the Peking Man 
brought the solution to an earlier 
problem: whether the remarkable flat 
skull cap dug up in Java by E. Dubois 
in 1890 was that of a man or an ape. 
In 1891 an indisputably human thigh 
bone was added to the earlier find 
though there was no direct proof that 
both discoveries belonged to the 
same subject. Dubois combined the 
two and his “erect walking Java Ape- 
Man", the Pithecanthropus erectus, 
remained the most controversial fossil 
for nearly 40 years. 
The main reason for this was that 
the ear region of the Java skull was 
missing and it is precisely this part 
of the skull which makes it possible 
to reach a clear decision. In the case 
of the Peking Man a complete skull 
was available and in spite of his pri- 
mitive characteristics he was, anato- 
mically speaking, indisputably human. 
This is also shown by the simple stone 
implements and the layer of ashes 
found at the place of discovery, which 
makes it clear that he already knew 
about tools and fire. 
The shape of the Peking skull was 
so similar to that of the controversial 
Java find that Black concluded that 
the Peking Man and the Java Man 
must have been close relatives. The 
remarkable thing was that Dubois, the 
discoverer of Pithecanthropus, dis- 
agreed with this theory. Although he 
had always previously defended the 
human characteristics of his find, he 
now denied that it was related in any 
way to Peking Man and even went 
so far as to declare that his Pithecan- 
thropus was an ape. 
The only way to resolve such a 
confused situation was to redouble 
our efforts in searching for the Java 
Man. We found a promising site in 
central Java with exposed strata in 
which there were many remains of 
the same extinct deer, antelopes and 
elephants as those discovered by 
Dubois in association with his Pitne- 
canthropus. 
Fo years we worked in this 
area. During the rainy season the 
downpour of water scattered . the 
loosened fossils over the hillsides and 
we eagerly went to work, soon assem- 
bling a large collection of teeth and 
bones of extinct animals. This includ- 
ed the remains of hippopotamuses—no 
longer found in Asia—various ele- 
phants, deer, pigs, tigers, rhinoceros 
and other animals. 
Then, one day in September 1937, 
we made an important find. One of 
my enthusiastic Indonesian collectors 
came across a piece of skull. The 
next day | hastened to the spot and 
promised the workers ten cents for 
every piece of skull they brought me. 
| myself soon found a large piece of 
the frontal bone, but my collectors 
only brought me small fragments. 
Too late | discovered what had 
happened; the workers. had broken up 
all the larger pieces in order to make 
more money! | was eventually given 
more than 40 pieces, but fortunately 
there was very little difficulty about 
joining them together since the skull 
was over one centimetre thick. 
It soon became clear that we had 
actually found a second Pithecanthro- 
pus skull. It would be difficult to 
find two skulls in a modern anthropo- 
logical collection which are so com- 
pletely alike as Pithecanthropus {| and ll, 
although the places of discovery were 
30 miles apart. The new find was 
finally complete enough to include the 
ear regions on both sides of the skull. 
One glance was enough: Pithecan- 
thropus had undoubtedly been a 
human being. After 46 years the 
puzzle had finally been solved.

THE NEW 
SCIENCE 
OF ART 
CONSERVATION 
(Continued from page 57) 
doorway. But this is not the end. 
The monument will be destroyed unless 
humidities are maintained, at least 
until the mural paintings can be remov- 
ed and conditioned to the drier envir- 
onment above ground. 
We have learnt much from our war- 
time experience of fire and pestilence 
and, not least, that the slow decay of 
susceptible material by exposure to 
damp can be quite as destructive as 
the damage from high explosives. 
A picture may disappear from a wall 
eaten up by mould growths, leaving 
only a nondescript stain. But even 
here science may have the last word. 
| know of paper bearing invisible draw- 
ings having been nursed into shape 
and successfully doctored by chemi- 
cals so that the drawings were actually 
brought back to life again.- 
Things that are invisible to the naked 
eye can be photographically recorded 
by using the methods of ultra-violet 
fluorescence, and in every police labor- 
atory there are several methods by 
which it may be possible to recover 
and decipher on charred or burnt 
documents writings or drawings when 
the ink seems to have been com- 
pletely burnt away. 
The Italians are past masters at what 
might be called preservation medicine 
and surgery. This is born of a natural 
facility in the studio and laboratory and 
the untold wealth of their cultural heri- 
tage which demands incessant atten- 
tion. For it is not true that a monu- 
ment having survived from antiquity, 
will necessarily go on surviving. Na- 
ture is always in a condition of change 
and the change may be either sudden, 
through excavation, or slow, through 
neglect. 
First come the rains, then growths 
appear of moss, lichens or algae, and 
the mortar is loosened. Ivy grows 
over the ruin, attacks the structure 
with its penetrating suckers. Humus 
is formed, plants root themselves, the 
level of the surrounding earth rises and 
capillary moisture weakens the founda- 
tions so that the building becomes 
derelict, and in this condition it is liable 
to be used as a source of stone for 
building or agriculture. 
How different is the picture when the 
aids of science are involved. The 
modern architect and chemist knows 
how to exclude moisture, prevent or 
destroy damaging organic growths with- 
out contaminating the stone, introduce 
a hidden armature of ferro-concrete, 
grout walls with an approved cement.

THE SAME STATUE BEFORE AND AFTER RESTORATION. Left, ravaged features 
of a 16th century painted stone statue of the Virgin, from St. John's Hospital, 
Bruges, Belgium. Cracks and wrinkles have rendered the work almost unrecognizable. 
Right, statue after it had undergone cleaning and restoration. 
And, if the foundations are unsatis- 
factory or unstable hydrologically, 
there are simple means by which 
consolidation is possible using the 
methods of electro-osmosis as applied, 
for example, in Warsaw by Ceberto- 
wicz to prevent the Church of St. Anna 
from destruction due to the movement 
of the clay slope on which it rested. 
The clay was consolidated, the move- 
ment was arrested and a rock-like 
basis for the structure provided by the 
electro-deposition of calcium silicate. 
Breas advances have been 
made in methods of conditioning the 
air of museums and galleries to give 
constant figures of temperature and 
relative humidity and to remove dust 
and noxious contaminents. 
At least one war-time repository was 
constructed in an underground mine 
where, beforehand, the dew-point had 
been continuously exceeded and mush- 
rooms were farmed commercially! 
Control methods were put into opera- 
tion with the result that this mine, 
though far below the surface of the 
ground, became the perfect store room 
for the most sensitive materials—arch- 
ives, textiles, books and even salt-laden 
Egyptian stele and other monuments: 
no single object suffered damage. 
But major problems remain. How 
can one hope to deal with a monu- 
carved in crumbling laterite 
exposed in a monsoon climate to 
alternatives of fierce heat and torrent- 
ial rains? We do not know, but we 
can do some calculated guess-work 
which, in the scientific field, is often 
the precursor of the pilot-experiment 
that leads to an eventual solution. 
Not long ago waterlogged wood was 
considered to be practically beyond 
Now, the position is 
much brighter, thanks to a concerted 
attack by museum scientists working 
in several countries, e.g. in Poland, at 
the pre-Slav village of Biskopin which 
is gradually being recovered from its 
watery grave, on iron-age settlements 
in Switzerland and on the frail but in- 
teresting timbers from mines and from 
wells in the United Kingdom, 
Each country has something to con- 
tribute. National museums take pride 
in the quality of their conservation 
work and friendly exchange of infor- 
mation in all such matters takes place. 
The conservation of monuments is of 
world importance, so much so, that an 
intergovernmental organization exists 
for the study of the preservation and 
restoration of cultural property, the so- 
called “Rome Centre” and this serves 
all nations with up-to-date information 
regarding methods and equipment and 
materials and hélps to train young 
curators and museum technicians. 
Its activities are known in many 
countries throughout the world. It has 
worked in collaboration with Unesco 
for the protection of the Buddhist 
temples of South Korea from destruc- 
tion and staining by water and lichen 
growths, etc, and on Pakistan's 
Mohenjo Daro, being seriously damag- 
ed by salt crystallizations. 
It has also worked on Indian cave 
paintings darkened by shellac, on the 
painted tholos of Kasanluk in Bulgaria, 
whose colours were flaking off in 
layers, and on the Mayan site of 
Bonampak in Mexico, where wonder- 
ful frescoes have miraculously survived 
in the heart of the rain forests. 
Work has also been done in Mor- 
occo, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and on 
many Middle East sites, and on 
medieval gold crosses in Vienna. Bib- 
lical scrolls have been studied, dissect- 
"ed and made available to scholars. 
Patiently, continuously, this labour of 
conservation goes on, a constructive 
service to preserve for posterity the 
monuments of the past that have serv- 
ed through the ages as a solace and 
an inspiration to mankind and will 
do so in generations to come.

The admirable 
12th century

de Compostela, 
Spain, is one of 
the master works 
from the past that 
have been spared 
the depredations 
of man and the

Eoce country has become increasingly 
aware of the grave deterioration of the world’s archi- 
tectural legacy. Buildings and statues which stood the 
test of time have been seriously damaged in recent 
years by air pollution. The million tons of coal burnt 
every year in Greater Brussels alone discharges about 
20,000 tons of sulphur dioxide into the air. The 
sulphur dioxide dissolved in fog, rain and snow turns 
into sulphuric acid, the corrosive power of which is 
well known. The fumes released by automobiles is 
an even more serious problem, the sulphur dioxide 
produced being even greater than that from coal. 
In Los Angeles the 50,000 tons of petroleum products 
consumed each day, a few years ago, discharged 
400 tons of sulphur dioxide into the air. The pollution

of the atmosphere of our cities and industrial centres 
is thus the chief cause of the weathering and deterior- 
ation of public buildings and monuments. On the 
calcareous stones of buildings a crust forms, and the 
stone develops blisters or cankers, and cracks; then 
the crust scales off, exposing to the elements a powdery 
surface which is easily eroded by rain and wind. This 
“disease” of stone, like an insidious form of leprosy, 
is nowadays attacking monuments and damaging them 
at an alarming rate.
