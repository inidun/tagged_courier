Road to asceticism 
Buddhist artists have never tired of recounting in paint and stone the Jataka stories—tales 
of Buddha's previous lives before he attained Enlightenment. This 19th century painting, 
one of a series of panels in the rock and cave temple of Mulgirigala, southern Ceylon, depicts 
a scene from the Vessantara Jataka, the last birth of the Buddha-to-be as a king who gave 
away all his worldly possessions and departed to the forests with his wife and children to 
lead a life of asceticism. It is reproduced from “Ceylon: Paintings from Temple, Shrine and 
Rock”, one of 23 albums published in the former “Unesco World Art Series” that presented 
many little-known or inaccessible masterpieces of art. Other unfamiliar works from the 
treasury of world art are featured in 38 Unesco paperbacks comprising a “Pocket 
Art Series”, and are also available as colour transparencies in 48 sets of Unesco art slides.

YOUTH OF 
YOUTH OF 
by René Maheu 
Director-General of Unesco 


### 53852: Youth of the world, youth of UNESCO

N November 4, 1971, Unesco will be twenty-five years old. 
To those who have served Unesco throughout this quarter of a century, giving 
unstintingly of themselves and being rewarded a hundredfold by the exhilaration that 
comes from dedication to man in all his universality, this anniversary provides a wealth 
of material for reminiscence and reflection concerning the past. 
But it is to the future that | look. The future is the true dimension of Unesco which 
has as its mission to usher in a new spirit and which draws its whole strength from 
the hope inherent in its purpose. My thoughts turn to those who were not yet born 
when Unesco was created, the young people who are the future of the world and who 
make up more than half its population. 
It was fitting to ask a young person, who had played no direct part in the history of 
Unesco, to tell the story of our first twenty-five years, as he himself saw them with 
the clear, fresh eye of youth. Those of us who have lived this history have lived it 
chiefly for the young people of his generation, ever since that “great and terrible 
war” when everything was so nearly lost, up until today when our efforts—with all 
their shortcomings—are under the sweeping scrutiny of tomorrow’s generations. And 
it is precisely on them that Unesco’s tomorrow depends. Even if they may misjudge 
certain aspects of our activities or some of our intentions can we fail to ask youth 
about their attitudes towards our work and whether or not it comes up to their 
expectations? 
In the past twenty-five years Unesco has had to face situations and tasks that its 
founders had never foreseen such as the cold war of the Fifties and aid for develop- 
ment in the Sixties. Unesco thereby has demonstrated a capacity for adaptation and 
invention which testifies to its vitality, and at the same time it has shown a remarkable 
insight into present-day realities and their probable aftermath. 
These qualities will be especially needed in the immediate years ahead which, | feel 
sure, will see the opening up of a new era. Here | am not referring to political

events, to modifications in relations between States-—although some very important 
changes are already emerging on the horizon; | am thinking of those more profound 
transformations that are now taking place in the thinking and actions of men which 
are bringing into question the very meaning of life and the order of society. 
LMOST everywhere, especially amongst the younger age groups, it seems 
to be increasingly felt that the quality of life of the individual is the only real justification 
for the efforts made to promote growth and prosperity in a community. lt is clear 
that the quality of life sought by many persons—including those who choose with- 
drawal from society or the path of revolt-—calls for a re-examination of currently 
accepted values. Development is coming less and less to be equated with growth 
pure and simple. Growth for what? is the often heard question. 
We can therefore be quite sure that education, science, culture and communic- 
ations, that is, learning and training, research and the creativity of the mind which 
enable man to explain his existence and give purpose to life, will be matters of the 
utmost concern for governments and citizens alike in the quarter of a century to 
come. This is already the case with education. What has been called the crisis in 
education, or more properly, the need for the total regeneration of education, is 
clearly evident in different forms and to varying degrees all over the world. For some, 
this “crisis” is merely a symptom heralding the approach of a vast cultural revolution. 
Faced with such great changes, the focus of which is still unclear, it is not unfitting that 
Unesco in its youth should be entrusted to the youth of the world. Their destinies 
are inseparable.

N November 4, 1971, the United Nations Educa- 
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary. To 
mark this occasion we are publishing in this 
special issue of the “Unesco Courier” a “youth's eye” 
view of Unesco, its achievements, its failings and its 
problems. 
The outcome of months of probing and delving in 
and around Unesco’s Paris headquarters by a young 
Canadian student, Wayne McEwing, this lively survey 
gives a new perspective to the work of the least spe- 
cialized of the United Nations specialized agencies. 
With all doors open to him, McEwing examined 
Unesco from top to bottom, assessing it with the 
objectivity of an outsider and putting his reactions 
down with the critical candour of youth. 
The story of how he came to write about Unesco 
in itself speaks volumes for the keen interest of young 
  
EHSAN NARAGH! is director of Unesco’s Youth Division, and 
was formerly professor of sociology and director of social studies 
and research at the University of Teheran (Iran). As a sociologist 
he has collaborated for many years in the work of international 
scientific associations. In 1965 he prepared for the United Nations 
the first world-wide study on the “Brain Drain”. He has written 
widely on sociological problems in the developing countries, and 
since 1970 he has given courses on youth, education and society 
in the Third World, at the University of Vincennes, Paris. His 
latest book, “Université, Jeunesse et Société” (University, Youth 
and Society) will appear shortly in Teheran. 
people everywhere in the international scene and for 
Unesco’s own interest in the questions and points of 
view of youth. Moreover, it demonstrates how 
Unesco’s approach to the world of youth has evolved 
over twenty-five years. 
Broadly speaking, before 1968 emphasis was plac- 
ed on youth activities in the fields of leisure and sport 
activities. In 1968 came the realization that the prob- 
lems of youth were of deep concern to society as a 
whole. Now a further step forward has been taken 
with the recognition that the problems of society as a 
whole are of direct. concern to youth. 
In 1969, Unesco held the first of a series of three- 
month, summer study courses for students from all 
over the world, and these have now become an annual 
event. The aim of the courses is to involve young 
people directly in the work of Unesco and at the same 
time to benefit from the impact of fresh vision and a 
new approach—in fact, to establish a two-way traffic 
of ideas. 
Each student works in a field of direct interest to 
his outside activities. A student teacher, for example, 
finds himself alongside members of the permanent 
staff of the Education Sector working out a functional 
literacy project for South America; in the Science 
Sector a would-be geologist studies new methods of 
assessing earthquake hazards. 
At the end of three months, the twenty or so stu- 
dents attending a course evaluate what they have

learned and make their own observations and criti- 
cisms of the way Unesco operates. 
Wayne McEwing attended the first of these courses, 
dividing his time between the Office of Public Infor- 
mation and the Division of Higher Education. He com- 
pleted his three months convinced of the value of the 
work being done by Unesco. But he was equally con- 
vinced of the need to explain what Unesco was doing 
in a graphic way that would give young people a 
greater sense of involvement. This was particularly 
true for young people is developed countries who are 
often less aware of Unesco and its achievements than 
their counterparts in the developing nations. 
After returning home he explained his viewpoint 
in a letter to Unesco's Director-General, René 
Maheu. McEwing was then invited back to Paris and 
given a free hand to tell the Unesco story in his own 
words. 
He listened to the opinions of representatives of 
the Member States, quizzed experts who had return- 
ed from missions in the field, and watched the per- 
sonnel of the Secretariat at work. 
Whatever their philosophy of life, their conception 
of the world and of modern society, young people 
throughout the world, are eager to share in the 
achievement of those ideals for which Unesco stands. 
Unesco is equally eager to establish a permanent 
dialogue with and provide a rostrum for the youth of 
the world. 
‘resources.

: 
However, Unesco knows that young people consider 
that international co-operation, whatever its apparent 
dimensions, does not go far enough to eliminate the 
disparities between rich and poor which exist within 
each nation and between developed and developing 
countries. The danger that this gap will continue to 
grow makes youth critical of a society in which pro- 
gress is too often measured in quantifiable terms 
rather than those of renewal and social change. 
Beyond this criticism of the instruments of inter- 
national co-operation, many young people question 
current political, economic, social and cultural options; 
they feel that one cannot hope to right the ills of the 
world if one remains impotent and silent before the 
arms race, the repression practised against groups 
and individuals, the degradation and waste of natural 
For all of these preoccupations, all these 
inspirations, can only find an outlet in action if the 
members of the international community commit them- 
selves to a new phase of co-operation among peoples. 
The creative energy which youth brings to this will 
for co-operation is a promise for the future. 
We hope that the publication of this series of 
articles on Unesco's twenty-five years will help to 
provoke amongst our readers both young and old a 
broad discussion of Unesco’s contribution to the dev- 
elopment of Education, Science and Culture in the 
world and of youth's preoccupation with international 
co-operation and peace between nations. L

### 53854: Seasons of the mind

SEASONS 
OF THE MIND 
1 - Thoughts of peace 
) HERE is an ancient story 
about two men ploughing a field. The 
earth was stony and the season was 
bad, but as they ploughed their fur- 
rows one man's face was tight-lipped 
and cold-eyed. He was thinking of the 
hardness of his life, the aching of his 
feet and legs. His horse did not go 
fast enough to suit him and he was 
convinced that his neighbour's wheat 
would grow taller and fuller than his. 
His neighbour, meanwhile, worked 
with rhythm and grace, concentrating 
on how straight he could direct his 
plough, stopping now and then to rest 
his mare. 
As the sun beat down on them both 
and the heat of the day increased, the 
first farmer lashed out again and again 
at his horse with the reins, sweat pour- 
ed down into his eyes, the veins of his 
hands stood out as he grasped the 
handle of his plough. He could think 
only that his neighbour was mocking 
him by purposely going so slowly 
about his work, and his rage built to 
a violent crescendo. If he had his 
neighbour's horse, he could plough 
twice as easily, and twice as much. 
He threw down his plough and, his 
tongue thick, scooped up the largest 
rock he could find. Then with a wild 
cry he flung himself across the field 
toward the other. 
The next day, the neighbour was 
back ploughing the field, but now he 
was using both horses. He walked 
more slowly than usual, however, sad- 
dened by the strange memory of the 
day before. He had looked up to see 
his fellow farmer running wildly toward 
him. Before he had time to react, the 
man fell dead at his feet, his hand still 
grasping a stone. Till the day he him- 
self died, he was never able to under- 
stand what had gone on in the other 
man’s mind or from where his savage 
violence had sprung. 
The moral of the story may be 
obvious, but it is far from being sim- 
ple. Both rage and a sense of peace 
are very private qualities, both are 
given birth in the fascinating, secret 
places of the mind. 
It is not enough to say simply that 
the two men had a different state of 
mind and leave it as that. Clearly the 
difference between them is a question 
of value; the man in harmony with his 
world is better, more “human” than 
the other. 
By extension, the only really human 
nation is a nation composed of people 
with that same sense of inner peace- 
fulness. There was a time when it 
was considered possible to make peo- 
ple and states get along by setting 
down laws of conduct, but now when 
the stakes have become so high, we 
are beginning to realize that that kind 
of uneasy, imposed peace is just too 
unstable and dangerous. 
Where would one begin to stimulate 
that kind of ideal peace in individuals 
and nations in a world only too ob- 
viously full of discord and selfishness? 
That was exactly the problem facing 
the people who were setting up the 
United Nations system at the end of 
the Second World War. It was all very 
well to bring governments together 
to iron out differences, all very 
well to get food and medicine to the 
millions of emaciated, disease-ridden 
citizens of the world, but even at that, 
it was not enough. To stop there 
would be like giving an accident victim 
painkiller and a hearty meal and not 
trying to treat his wounds. 
To really promote peace and gen- 
erosity of spirit, they saw they had to

### 53854: Seasons of the mind

THOUGHTS OF PEACE (Continued from page 9) 
deal with the minds of men. The 
theory was that when you saw how 
- your neighbour's mind worked what 
12 
he ate, what he had accomplished, 
what he had learned about the world 
around him, how his family and cul- 
tural background had shaped him and 
how he looked at you, it would be 
almost impossible to hate him. The 
human mind cannot seem to reject 
what it tries to understand. 
Scientific knowledge, educational 
background, cultural heritage... these 
seemed the general areas that had to 
be explored. And without too much 
thought it becomes clear that in all 
these respects there are people in the 
world who are light years apart. 
Some men are literally living in the 
stone age, and just because society 
minht feed them and take away their 
hatchets (sometimes in exchange for 
guns) it hasn't, begun to bring them 
into the twentieth century. 
  
O here is the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization, Unesco, facing 
the task of figuring out and developing 
the mind of man, always toward peace 
and mutual understanding, but very 
often toward being able to write a 
name, plant a field, or run a tractor. 
To be honest, the United Nations 
proved just how idealistic they were 
by creating Unesco. The very thought 
of heightening the consciousness of 
the entire world is staggering, and it 
stands to reason that any progress is 
painfully slow. No one knows that 
better than the people who work at 
Unesco headquarters in Paris. Psy- 
chologically, there can be few tasks 
more frustrating than trying to put 
an idealistic scheme into practical 
operation. 
When you are looking with a shrewd 
eye at any organization, if you really 
want to know how it ticks, it is wise 
to find out who makes the decisions 
and, even more bluntly, where the 
money to support it comes from. 
At Unesco the decisions are made 
at a General Conference of the one 
hundred and twenty-five member 
states. Each delegation at these con- 
ferences (they happen every two 
years) has one vote in spite of the 
fact that the contributions they make 
vary a great deal, according to how 
much they can afford to pay. 
The people who work in various 
departments of the headquarters in 
Paris prepare detailed sets of pro- 
posals for projects they think should 
be attempted or pursued in the inter- 
ests of the community of member 
states, submit them to the conference 
and then wait to find out if the majority 
are willing to accept their ideas. 
It is difficult enough to have one 
boss, but when one has one hundred 
and twenty-five of them, all with their 
own views and interests, life can seem 
incredibly complicated. To put it 
mildly, the job of being Director 
General of Unesco (at headquarters 
he is reverentially referred to as the 
DG) requires boundless quantities of 
tact. But one thing that comes across 
more and more forcibly as time goes 
on is that these 125 different states 
actually can agree, and though the 
odds against it seem enormous, they 
can be brought into a working arrange- 
ment together. 
An interesting change has come 
about in the membership of the or- 
ganization. At the beginning there 
were 20 countries involved, on the 
whole, part of that cultural block called 
“western civilization” and the atmos- 
phere was more or less like a fashion- 
able, post-war club for intellectuals. 
However, life has speeded up con- 
siderably since then and as new 
nations have appeared literally by the 
score (especially in Africa), the whole 
tone of the place has changed. 
When you take the lift in the 
Secretariat, or especially when you 
look into one of the conference rooms, 
you get a very strong sense that this 
is not just a building in a particular 
city, in a particular country, it is a 
building on the face of the earth. The 
first thing you notice is the blend in 
styles of clothing, then the mélée of 
languages, many not even identifiable 
to the ear, and then the exciting 
business of simultaneous translation 
into the five official languages... 
English, French, Russian, Spanish and 
Arabic. 
More important, as far as Unesco’s 
work is concerned, the emphasis is no 
longer on the exchange of ideas 
alone, but now the key work is 
“development”. Unesco has taken 
on an active role in education, science, 
culture and communication, so for 
every person working in the Secre- 
tariat in Paris, there are two people 
working on Unesco projects “in the 
field”. And that phrase has come to 
cover a startlingly large range. It 
can mean an expert giving advice on 
how to set up a university in Iraq, 
another shoring up the ruins of an 
ancient temple in ‘Indonesia, or yet 
another working on a project in marine 
biology at a centre in Mexico. 
Again the question of money comes 
up. If Unesco has taken on all these 
projects, who pays for them? If

HISTORY 
IN A GLOBAL 
PERSPECTIVE 
One of the outstanding achievements 
of Unesco’s 25 years of effort is the 
six-volume “History of Mankind”, a 
vast pioneering effort to bring an 
international approach to the writing 
of world history. Sponsored by 
Unesco and produced by the Inter- 
national Commission for a History of 
the Scientific and Cultural Develop- 
ment of Mankind, it spans the years 
from prehistoric times to the 20th 
century. Over 1,000 historians, phifo- 
sophers and scholars from 62 coun- 
tries laboured for eighteen years to 
produce this 7,000 page world history 
with its many illustrations and maps. 
Editions have already been published in 
seven languages (English, French, 
Spanish, Greek, Dutch, Serbo-Croatian 
and Slovenian) and further editions in 
Hebrew and Catalan are in prepara- 
tion. Unlike other world histories, 
that have laid stress on war and 
conflict between nations and peoples, 
this history was the first attempt to 
place man’s scientific and cultural 
development in a truly global perspec- 
tive. Leaving aside the traditional 
nationalistic approach to the writing 
of history, the “History of Mankind” 
presents a detailed study of the cross-. 
fertilization of scientific ideas, of reli- 
gions and cultural life, of economic 
and social events and the forms of 
artistic expression and the scientific 
thinking of many peoples and cultures.

### 53854: Seasons of the mind

THOUGHTS OP FEACE (Continued) 
Unesco people just had their own 
budget of about $90 million to go on, 
"they could make suggestions, do some 
14 
studies for governments and arrange 
conferences, but as far as putting 
projects into operation, their hands 
would virtually be tied. So, Unesco 
has become an administrator of other 
people's money. For instance, from 
the vast lump of money put aside by 
the U.N. for world-wide development, 
Unesco, under the watchful eye of the 
people in New York, uses a sizeable 
chunk for projects of the mind. 
Also, individual organizations and 
countries sometimes make specific 
contributions to special projects in 
other parts of the world, and here 
Unesco plays the part of a generous 
investment counsellor. 
‘Often when you hear about aid 
being given to a particular country, 
it seems that they are merely being 
given a hand-out by the so-called 
richer nations. But in reality the nations 
receiving aid have to put up the 
money for as much of the project as 
they can afford and do as much of 
the work as they can. They may get 
free advice and supplies, but as far 
as possible, they are given the 
dignity of paying their own bills and 
helping themselves. 
Another important question comes 
to mind. How does Unesco decide 
on doing a project in one country and 
not another? Do they send people 
around telling different nations that 
their educational systems are bad or 
that they had better get busy and start 
co-operating intellectually? Hardly, 
when it is up to the nations and up 
to Unesco to wait until the member 
state decides to ask for advice. 
Let us invent the imaginary country 
of Sutch. For our purposes Sutch is 
a member of Unesco and every two 
years three prominent Sutcherians 
come to the conference in Paris. 
(Incidentally, at the request of Unesco, 
one of their delegates is a promising 
young man beginning a career in his 
native country and for him the con- 
ference will be in itself a new kind 
of educational experience.) The head 
of the delegation, let us say, is a 
charming, worldly-wise Sutcherian who 
was educated abroad and then went 
back to his native Sutch to make a 
name for himself in educational circles. 
He comes to Paris full of enthusiasm 
for a project that he has been nursing 
in the back of his mind ever since 
he himself had to go half-way across 
the world to school. If only Sutch 
had its own university, he feels, its 
educational system would really be 
complete. Sutch might be small and 
relatively poor, but since his student 
days the quality of its schools has 
improved immensely, 
that, with Unesco backing, now is the 
time to found the University of Sutch. 
Like most people, he feels that his 
educational background is just what 
everyone's should be, and when he 
envisions the new campus, he pictures 
a place very similar to his alma mater 
transported to a pleasant hill just 
outside the capital city of Sutch. 
His proposals are all carefully set 
out in detail, giving estimates of the 
cost of the project, the need for 
Unesco's advice and aid, the expected 
enrolment and all the other facts that 
seem relevant. To all of this, the 
delegate adds his own enthusiasm 
as he meets with many different 
educational experts at headquarters. 
They listen, ask questions, pause, 
compare the Sutcherian project to 
others they have worked on, check 
the information that they have about 
the Sutcherian school system, look at 
the national economy, the political 
situation. 
A project of this size is going to 
take several years of concentrated 
work and a lot of capital, and no 
matter how tempting the idea might 
seem, it has to be questioned and 
tested from every possible angle; this 
is not only to prevent Unesco from 
wasting its time and other people's 
money, but even more important, to 
make sure the Sutcherians aren't 
getting into something that they won't 
be able to handle. 
OR a while, the questions 
that Unesco asks are random and 
exploratory, but as the negotiations go 
on some of them begin to fit into a 
pattern. In the course of the dis- 
cussions, one man asks how many 
engineers Sutch is producing per year 
and where they get their training. 
They, too, have to go abroad to get 
their instruction, do they not? 
The Sutcherian delegate is not too 
sure of the precise number, but he 
suspects that at most four or five 
of them are produced per year. 
Technological and scientific education 
haven't caught on in his country, he 
says, and most people want to study 
humanities for a general education. 
These statements strike the Unesco 
expert as all too familiar. Where are 
all these arts graduates going to get 
jobs, and what are the chances for 
Sutch to develop its technology 
without technicians? 
Someone else asks the Sutcherian 
delegate what form he thinks the 
university should take that would 
and he feels 
Dr
aw
in
g

R.
 
Bo
uw
en
s 
‘wgIrans 
really reflect the Sutcherian culture? 
That question stuns him; he has never 
thought about an educational system 
as part of any particular culture, but 
the more he thinks it over, the more 
he begins to suspect that the ins- 
titution he had in mind was more a 
reflection of himself and of his own 
experience than of the Sutcherian 
culture as a whole. 
Ideally, at this point the Sutcherian 
delegate will begin to see that, eco- 
nomically, a technical school will be 
much more beneficial to the country 
as a whole, that his idea of a uni- 
versity will have to wait, and that 
when it finally does become a reality 
it will be very different from what he 
had in mind. Ideally, Unesco and 
Sutch will be able to raise the money 
to set up the technical school, and 
Sutch will be on its way to a techno- 
logical renaissance and a new phase 
in its history. 
All these things will happen if the 
delegate is willing to put off his 
dream for a university, if the Unesco 
experts have asked the right questions 
about the project, if the Sutcherians 
themselves are willing to study 
science and engineering instead of the 
humanities, if there isn't a more 
pressing need for Unesco work ‘and 
money in another country. But in 
actual fact, where human foibles and 
limitations are concerned, things don't 
always work out so smoothly.

HELPING TO RE-WRITE HISTORY 
While Unesco lends no support to one industria- 
list's view that “History is bunk”, it has long been 
aware that a great deal of bunk still masquerades 
as history. As early as 1950, Unesco set in motion 
= A T-C Io ARR LANL LA 4 Le EA Le Lab J eX AR 1 TE-3 Co 1 VAR €-) §{ o Too) [€5 
which revealed appalling distortions of fact, super- 
ficial treatment of major historical events and 
whole cultural areas of the world, out-of-date 
accounts of the life styles and customs of foreign 
countries and even huge lacunae in the presentation 
of certain major facets of history. “In less than 
one lifetime”, wrote Arnold Toynbee in 1956, “the

since the rise of the earliest known civilizations 
about 5,000 years ago, has been enormously enlarged 
and has also been brought into much sharper focus. 
And since curiosity is one of the characteristics of 
human nature, we find ourselves moved, in our

as a whole. As soon as one looks at the new pano-

of the current framework within which our western 
historians have been doing their work for the last 
250 years.” 
Unesco has no power nor the desire to re-write

who can do this are the people in each country. 
But, by organizing special meetings with history 
book writers and publishers, Unesco has 
encouraged the “de-bunking” of history

can be given a more balanced and more objective 
view of other countries. 
" For one thing, this example makes 
Unesco look very wise and experi- 
enced, but just as easily, the Sutch- 
erian delegate might have come to 
Paris bubbling over with exciting new 
ideas and plans for educational reform, 
only to find that Unesco wasn’t ready 
for them yet. No matter who is doing 
the suggesting or who is lagging 
behind, the important thing is for 
governments and Unesco to work 
together in spite of all the possible 
obstacles. : 
In that kind of relationship it is easy. 
to see why in Unesco there are so 
many people concerned with liaison 
between states, organizations and the 
secretariat itself. Proposal, counter 
proposal, compromise, re-thinking, 
changes of tactics, breakthroughs in 
understanding... out of it all a project 
gathers energy and support and gets 
under way. 
Then you have to add the new 
dimension of the understanding, tact 
and efficiency of a great number of 
individuals putting it into operation in 
the field and you begin to get an 
idea of the full working of a project, 
the research and planning involved, 
the diplomacy, and the solid hard 
work. 
Another factor of Unesco’s job is 
that most of the things it tries to do 
have never been done before, so by 
their very nature the projects are 
elaborate experiments, experiments 
often run on a limited budget and, 
above all, designed to be practical 
when governments want to put them 
into use throughout their country. 
One expert offers his solution, another 
expert insists that his is better. It 
seems that there is a constant tugging 
in two opposite directions, one toward 
ultra-modern ideas and one toward 
suggestions that are at least some- 
what tried by experience. 
F course, it is up to the 
government itself to make the final 
decision; their intuitions as to what 
techniques will work and what will not 
are bound to be more reliable than 
those of even the most experienced 
Unesco advisors. it might seem easier 
for them to stay withthe tried and 
true remedies, but sometimes countries 
which are developing at a breath- 
taking rate do not have time to rely 
on twentieth century answers and have 
to call on technology that really 
belongs to the twenty-first century. 
Just to complicate matters further, 
in. many cases there is no way of 
knowing how a particular project is 
working until it has been in operation 
for a number of years. How do you 
tell if a new educational system is 
working until someone has had an 
entire education in it? 
When you consider that several 
thousands of individual young men and 
women could have their entire educ- 
ation wasted and their lives seriously 
hurt if your system doesn’t work out, 
you use every bit of foresight and 
draw on all the wisdom you can muster, 
Or as another example, after you 
carefully draw up a treaty about copy- 
rights or the preservation of monu- 
ments, you can only find out if it is 
going to work when it has been 
tested by circumstance. In the mean- 
time, writers’ life works may have 
been pirated and irreplaceable 
churches and museums destroyed. 
You do your best. You can never 
succeed completely, but hopefully you 
never fail completely, even if all you. 
have managed to gain is experience 
for the next attempt. 
But enough of the general nature of 
Unesco. The categories “education, 
science and culture” cover a huge 
range. For instance, education in- 
cludes teaching both young people 
and adults to read and write, setting 
up primary schools as well as uni- 
versities, teaching sciences as well as 
humanities. So instead of dividing the 
subject matter into big blocks, we shall 
try to be as specific as possible about 
some Unesco projects and goals, and 
from that you should be able to get 
an idea of the whole. =u

y RES RL) 37-16) 
The mind 
awakening 
  
good place to start dis- 
cussing Unesco’s work in education is 
with the most basic kind of teaching... 
leading people on their first steps from 
illiteracy to the simplest kind of 
reading, writing and calculating. 
The very fact that you are reading 
this page sets you apart from a lot of 
the world's population. It is impossible 
to say exactly how many people in the 
world are illiterate; naturally, govern- 
ments who must supply the statistics 
are eager to present as bright a picture 
of their educational systems as pos- 
sible, but conservative United Nations’ 
guesses put the present total at around 
800 million people over the age of 15. 
Eight hundred million people... one 
of those figures that are always being 
thrown at us. Look at it another way. 
That means about one-third of the 
world's adult population, over the age 
of 15, or about four times the popula- 
tion of the United States. 
It may seem surprising, but there are 
still people in the twentieth century who 
think that “what folks don’t know won't 
hurt them” and that “a little learning 
is a dangerous thing”. “Why not leave 
things as they are. If someone has the 
talent and wants to learn, he will 
somehow be able to.” 
At one time the educated élite might 
have been able to justify that kind of 
reasoning, but now when the illiterate 
man is bombarded daily with signs and 
important instructions, literacy has 
become a matter of survival for every- 
one. Just imagine yourself, no matter 
where you live, trying to get through a 
day if you couldn't read even the 
simplest words and phrases, and you 
will get some sense of the frustrations 
that the modern-day illiterate has to 
live with. 
Ever since it was founded, Unesco 
has been working in the field of literacy 
and it is encouraging to see that, 
finally, according to Unesco statistics, 
the percentage of illiterates in the world 
has begun to go down. What is most 
frustrating, however, is that the world’s 
population is increasing so fast that, 
in spite of the percentage figures, in 
actuality, the total number of illiterates 
is increasing at the rate of several 
million a year. 
On top of that, no one knows just 
how many people have had literacy 
training and are “officially” literate, but 
have forgotten all they knew because, 
once their training was over, they had 
no way to keep in practice. Unesco 
insists that literacy has to be 
“functional” or else it is just a point- 
less exercise; it may seem to be a 
glorious and magnanimous gesture 
to make as many people in a country 
literate as quickly as you can, but 
in effect, unless you make their new 
abilities part of their lives, you are 
being very unfair to them. 
Put yourself in their place. What 
could be more discouraging than to 
learn the “magic” skills of reading and 
writing only to find out that it hasn't 
improved your life in any way? 
Naturally, you would forget it all in no 
time, and you would end up with a 
terrible sense of being cheated and 
made a fool of. 
Literacy, Unesco has found, isn't 
simply a matter of education; it is a 
matter of large-scale social change. 
The newly literate individual should 
have a chance to make the written word 
part of his everyday life, whether in 
his job or even in reading a special 
“literacy” newspaper that is geared to 
his interests and his reading abilities 
until he can read a regular paper. 
HE new functional literacy 
approach has to begin right from the 
kind of knowledge that people use. A 
man who makes his living at growing 
cotton is vitally concerned with inform- 
ation on new techniques of tilling the 
soil and getting as rich a harvest from 
his land as he can. 
In his case, Unesco experts have 
developed a series of illustrated basic 
primers beginning with the word 
“cotton” in his language and leading 
him into more and more complicated 
aspects of his job. By the time he has 
mastered the information he needs to 
know for his work he has begun to 
learn to read. The same is just as true 
for people of other cultures and other 
languages who want to learn to run a 
tractor or build a house. 
Unesco primers to teach children to 
learn to read and write are, naturally,

THE MIND AWAKENING (Continued) 
not so technical, but even they must 
be carefully tailored to the world as 
each child knows it. “Dick and Jane 
Build a Snowman” or “The Adventures 
of a Squirrel” might be staple first 
readers for children in temperate zones 
where there are snowmen and squirrels, 
and where the names Dick and Jane 
are common, but they would be 
strange and almost useless to a child 
who grew up in tropical Asia or Africa. 
It seems self-evident that any 
person will learn to read and write 
best in his native tongue; it is hard 
enough to master the reading and 
writing without having to tackle a new 
language at the same time. The diffi- 
culties arise when, as in several areas 
of Africa, the languages people speak 
have no written form; they have been 
preserved completely by word of 
mouth, as the languages of northern 
Europe once were. 
In these cases, to teach the people 
a different language for reading and 
writing is to make their oral language 
disappear completely in almost no 
time. So that this won't happen, 
Unesco experts are now busy record- 
ing these precious traditions and 
putting six groups of African languages 
into a usable written form. One added 
advantage of this project is that these 
languages transcend mere political 
barriers, and when they can be written 
and understood, communication bet- 
ween states will be made much easier. 
NFORTUNATELY, the 
people whose native tongues these 
are have to wait on the average five 
years before their languages can be 
written down for them, and even longer 
before basic literacy primers can be 
developed. These language groups 
are far from being “primitive” and easy 
to reduce to an existing alphabet and 
grammatical structure. 
For example, in Yoruba, which is a 
language of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo and 
Dahomey, there may be as many as 
57 different tense forms, as opposed 
to a mere dozen or so in English and 
French, and the language is tonal, so 
that the same sounds pronounced with 
different tones have different meanings. 
Yet another local language, Hausa, 
was already written down, but in two 
different ways. In Nigeria, which was 
administered by the British, it was done 
according to English phonetics, and in 
Niger, which was administered by the 
French, according to French phonetics. 
The result was one language that 
looked like two foreign tongues. Now 
Unesco experts are trying to devise a 
way of writing Hausa that will be 
. taught and understood in both Niger 
18 
and Nigeria. 
The search for new literacy tech- 
niques, the setting up of pilot projects 
to test them and the work of putting 
new concepts of literacy into long- 
range plans for national development 
and productivity are fascinating and 
exciting in themselves, but at the 
centre of all this activity, the man who 
is learning to read and write has 
some definite demands and opinions 
of his own. 
He is moving through time at a fan- 
tastic rate, from a social context be- 
fore the written word to a highly liter- 
ate modern realm; he knows better 
than anyone else just what a handicap 
his illiteracy is, but at the same time, 
he is an adult who got along in the 
world long before any government 
teacher or Unesco expert came to 
give him an education and he refuses 
to be patronized or talked down to. 
For example, the illiterate who lives 
in supposedly developed western 
cities such as Chicago, Genoa or 
Birmingham (to name a few) is parti- 
cularly shy about admitting his limit- 
ation. In his case, it takes carefully 
developed television programmes and 
advertising to give him the incentive 
to begin classes or, in some cases, to 
begin classes for the second or third 
time; here too, what some people 
learned as children and never had a 
chance to practice can become lost in 
the grey chasms of lethargy and aim- 
lessness. 
Although the reaction may vary from 
culture to culture, in many cases 
adults attending literacy classes are 
very sensitive to being treated like 
children. The thought of meeting in 
their own children’s schoolrooms in the 
evenings may strike them as vaguely 
demeaning, and they are much more 
relaxed in a church or a meeting 
hall, in buildings that they have built 
themselves as literacy centres, or 
simply under the shade of a tree while 
the daylight lasts. 
The kind of person who is chosen 
as the literacy teacher makes a very 
important difference, as well. Regu- 
lar schoolteachers usually aren't as 
effective with adults as people who 
have been through a literacy pro- 
gramme themselves and are fired 
with enthusiasm to share their new- 
found knowledge with their peers. 
Usually, teachers who are not too 
much younger than the students have 
a better effect, but as soon as you 
start ‘making these distinctions, you 
are bound to find a nineteen-year-old, 
third-grade teacher who is more effec- 
tive than all the forty-year-old new 
literates carefully chosen for a project. 
You simply can't make neat, fixed 
rules where literacy teaching is con- 
cerned. Most often in the final analy- 
sis it is the personal element that 
makes the difference between success 
and failure, and, often, you take who- 
ever you can get for the job until 
someone more effective or better 
qualified can be found. 
After Unesco experts and local 
educators have studied what particular 
methods of teaching will be most 
effective for a particular country (most 
likely by trial and error in experimental 
projects), after they have developed

This young Sudanese woman (right) is 
training to be a midwife, but since she 
cannot read she is taught by repetition 
and demonstration to identify certain drugs 
by sight and, with eyes blindfolded, by 
smell or taste. Soon, like many thousands 
of other Sudanese, she may no longer be 
blind to the written word thanks to an 
intensive literacy campaign carried out by 
the Sudan with Unesco aid. The campaign 
is part of Unesco's experimental world 
literacy programme launched in 1964, and 
linking literacy with agricultural and 
industrial development. It now has projects 
in operation in 13 countries of Africa, Asia 
and Latin America, and 53 other countries 
have asked to join the programme. Below,

THE MIND AWAKENING (Continued) 
the materials necessary for teaching, 
after they have trained the nucleus of 
a teaching staff, and after all the un- 
expected snags have been ironed out 
(such as adjusting to local harvesting 
schedules in one place or compensat- 
ing for long-standing social reactions 
that hadn't been foreseen in another) 
it is up to Unesco to slowly phase 
itself out and up to the government to 
take the project from there. 
Where the government picks up 
wholeheartedly as Unesco leaves, the 
project should be firmly on its way. 
Often the initial decision to invest in 
adult literacy meant cutting back on 
something like defence spending or on 
more traditional formal education, 
and as governments and individuals 
change, so do their priorities. 
Sad to say, where the government 
has lost interest, or where it can't 
afford to supply its share of the con- 
tinuing costs, the project dies, and 
within a short space of time all the 
money and hours of work evaporate 
as if they had never been invested. 
Just to put Unesco’'s work in pers- 
pective, however, many countries have 
used striking methods of their own in 
their blitz for literacy and, in these 
instances, it is up to Unesco, through 
its surveys, conferences and studies, 
to pass on the information to others. 
To supply the crucial need for liter- 
acy teachers in Iran, for instance, 
soldiers who had considerable educa- 
tion were put into service as a peace- 
time Literacy Corps. Now a similar 
idea has been used with the national 
guard in Venezuela and the possibili- 
ties the idea suggests seem endless. 
Wouldn't it be a relief if all the armies 
of the world could be turned into 
educational forces full time? 
One of the most encouraging signs 
both for Unesco and for the individual 
governments concerned is how many 
people want desperately to become 
literate, so much so that, in some 
cases, whatever projects might be 
devised simply can't keep up with 
them. 
One Unesco expert assigned to 
Ethiopia noticed a gentleman in a first 
year literacy class writing busily and 
at a level far ahead of the rest. “D 
you think this man has had some train- 
ing already?” he asked the local 
teacher. “If he can read as well as 
he can write, | think we've put him in 
the wrong class.” 
Sure enough, the man read back 
what he had written perfectly, but he 
insisted that he had never been to 
school. Had he done it on his own? 
Oh, no. He was the proud father of 
educated children, children who went 
to school everyday. Every night when 
they came home he would sit down 
with them and listen to their stories. 
They would show him what their teach- 
er had taught them and that is how 
he knew about writing and numbers. 
If his children were goina to grow up 
educated, wasn't it natural that he 
should be educated too? |

A RACE BETWEEN EDUCATION 
AND CATASTROPHE 
H.G. Wells wrote that the modern world is embarked on a race between education 
and catastrophe. And itis true that if we want to ensure lasting peace in the world, 
we have no time to lose to bring about a radical improvement in the standard of 
living of the economically poor countries of the world. Most governments have 
come to a new awareness of the key role that education plays in a nation’s develop- 
ment. In this respect, the efforts undertaken by Unesco in the past 25 years have 
been of capital importance. The Director of the Institute of Education at the Univer- 
sity of London, Dr Lionel Elvin, has aptly remarked that the most powerful single 
idea that has spread through the world in relation to education in the last 25 years 
is that itis aright. In 1970, International Education Year, reports from Unesco’s mem- 
ber states revealed an unprecedented growth in the field of education. Between 
1950 and 1965, the number of teachers in the world increased from 8 to 16 million. 
School enrolment increased by 80 per cent in India and 42 per cent in 
Iran. In the Arab countries enrolment increased from 8 1/2 million students in 
1960 to 13 million in 1967. In Latin America, between 1960 and 1967, the number of 
pupils entering primary education increased by 12 million.

HAT argument would 
convince a bank to give a long-term 
loan, without collateral, with no interest 
and based completely on speculation? 
Investment bankers are a very shrewd 
and practical lot and refuse to be 
taken in by promises of vast capital 
to be made or grand schemes for 
future development. On the whole 
they want their balance sheets to 
prove that their money is actually 
working and that it is working as 
profitably as it possibly can. 
Unesco has found that one area in 
which they will give loans on exact- 
ly these terms is in the field of 
educational development. The real 
resources of a country are not its 
mineral deposits, nor its agricultural 
wealth, but rather, the people in it. 
As gold must be refined, so these 
people must be educated. Although 
you cannot measure the profit immedi- 
ately, sure enough, as the educational 
level of a country increases, so does 
its productivity . . . and that makes for 
a good investment on anyone's terms. 
Hence, the knowledgeable business- 
men of the World Bank have decided 
to make money available, through 
Unesco, to finance educational projects 
throughout the world. Again, the 
individual governments have to contri- 
bute as much as they can, and often

The 
growing 
mind 
  
large parts of their budgets are spent 
in the field of education, but it is 
usually in the developing countries 
which have least to spend that the 
need is greatest. 
For the sake of argument, let us 
assume that a country has no formal 
educational system, (and the problem 
is never that straightforward in actual- 
ity); where would you begin in setting 
one up? Naturally, you would start 
with teachers, but where would you 
get them? The systems of education 
in developed countries are self- 
perpetuating in that teachers teach 
young people who in turn can become 
teachers. 
In developing countries, you are 
forced to create teachers almost over- 
night out of people who really should 
be students. The difficulties of per- 
forming this conjuring trick are almost 
insurmountable, and here is where a 
great deal of planning and willingness 
to learn from others becomes abso- 
lutely crucial. 
Not only does Unesco send experts 
to individual countries, but it has set 
up regional centres for educational 
planning where countries with similar 
cultures and interests can pool their 
individual findings, work out ground 
rules that will be useful to them all, 
and save each other a lot of valuable 
time in planning their separate edu- 
cational strategies. 
And by planning is meant not just 
starting high-powered teacher training 
courses, building schools and planning 
curricula and text-books; it also means 
taking into consideration such things 
as what kinds of teaching won't set 
up socio-cultural barriers that might 
keep students from coming back day 
after day, what techniques will make 
the deepest, most economical impact 
on them, and what training pro- 
grammes will fit in best with the needs 
of the country as a whole. 
  
NCE again, this is an 
uncharted field where you must begin 
by setting up small, specific exper- 
iments; if they work, the government 
can apply them to larger and larger 
sections of the country depending on 
the national plans for future expansion. 
Often, in the area of education, 
beside simply planning, experimenting 
and rejecting a project if it doesn't 
seem to work, you have to make the 
brave decision to keep doing what you 
are doing a little longer in the hope 
that it will finally catch on. 
When you are dealing with teacher- 
training, for example, your first years

The two children in the photo below look as if they are having the time of their lives— and they 
probably think they are. But you don’t have to stand on your head to see what a topsy-turvy world 
we live in. Itis in the regions of the world where the needs are greatest that the means are most 
lacking. In 1970 there were 1,100 million children under the age of 15 in the developing countries 
compared with only 312 million in the more developed countries (table, opposite). Children in the 
prosperous countries (photo left) will then represent only one-fifth of the world’s children. 
They can expect to get an education while the vast majority of children (in the developing countries) 
will still lack teachers, schools and books. A major Unesco effort to promote education in the 
developing countries has been carried out in recent years in conjunction with the World Bank. 
Up to now World Bank loans and credits for improving education have totalled $440 million. 
Present plans foresee World Bank loans for education of a further $1,000 million during the next 
five years, between 1971-1976.

THE GROWING MIND (Continued from page 271) 
of effort can seem very discouraging. 
If a small country needs two or three 
"hundred teachers immediately, you set 
24 
up a training centre for as many 
promising candidates as you can find, 
let us say one hundred and fifty. You 
hope to give them a fast education and 
teacher-training at the same time, but 
you may find that at the end of five 
years you have only been able to train 
five or six people whom you could 
really call competent. 
In that case, all you can do is keep 
working with the group of people you 
began with until they are trained, 
trying every new and helpful method 
you can come across. In the mean- 
time, there are yearly more and more 
children of school age still with no 
teachers and no schools. 
NE of Unesco's most 
venturesome and colourful projects 
that was started as a small experiment 
is now at the stage of being put into 
practice nationally in the Ivory Coast. 
The basic problem to be faced was 
setting up primary schools in the 
outlying areas of the country which for 
part of the year were virtually inac- 
cessible, but it went far beyond that. 
Where would the teachers come from? 
How would they be trained? There 
weren't enough for the rapidly devei- 
oping urban areas around Abidjan. 
The idea of teaching by radio came 
first to mind because Unesco and 
many of its member states have used 
it very effectively in the past and it is 
one of the most popular current 
methods for covering wide areas with 
a minimum of teachers. It has the 
disadvantage that it doesn't make the 
same impact that visual teaching does 
and it always has to be backed up by 
a trained instructor in the classroom 
and so for a long time the notion of 
trying out television instead has been 
gathering momentum. 
The Ivory Coast seemed the perfect 
situation to test it because with TV, 
the classroom monitors need almost 
no training in that they can take their 
cues from the televised instructor and 
the teacher-training element is largely 
eliminated. 
When that decision had been agreed 
upon, a few other problems began to 
crop up. Number one: how do you 
operate a TV set in a village that 
doesn’t have electricity? In some 
cases batteries seemed the best solu- 
tion, but in others, in the desert lands 
of the north, solar power seemed 
better. So suddenly, some villages that 
had never had any electrical power 
were getting it, not by old-fashioned 
twentieth-century methods, but by 
technology which will not be used in 
even the most advanced countries for 
many years to come. 
While all these strictly technical 
angles were being seen to, a curricu- 
lum of programmes and work materials 
was being prepared with the help of 
Unesco experts. Ultimately, one tele- 
vision teacher would be doing the work 
of many hundreds, and each lesson 
could be prepared with far greater care 
than any dozen regular teachers would 
have time for. 
If all goes well, all first grade 
students in the Ivory Coast will be 
taught by television and each year a 
curriculum will be prepared for the 
next higher grade, so children starting 
now will probably receive their entire 
public schooling by television. 
Again, since this is a Unesco project, 
if it can be made to work successfully, 
the techniques will be established for 
other countries which want to follow 
suit. 
But Unesco’s interests certainly do 
not stop with public school. Where 
traditional teaching methods are used, 
the quality of secondary school grad- 
uates directly influences the quality 
of future teaching in public schools. 
It is impossible to improve one part of 
an educational system without con- 
sidering and improving the whole. 
One of Unesco’s projects which has 
now become history had to do with 
teaching science after the Second 
World War. The need for trained 
scientists amounted to a serious crisis 
in world development and the schools 
and labs needed to train them lay in 
ruins across Europe. 
A group of brilliant and imaginative 
Unesco experts devised a source book 
for teaching science using the simplest 
possible equipment... a lemon rolled 
to squeeze out juice for conducting 
electricity; a fork, needle and glass of 
water to test surface tension; a cork, 
a bulb and five nails to make a primi- 
tive flashlight. There are even a ruler, 
protractor and set-square printed on 
the last page of the book which can be 
traced and reproduced by students in 
cardboard. Many of today's top-flight 
scientists made a beginning with these 
simple experiments. 
Now, the book, reworked, brought 
up-to-date and translated into more 
than 20 languages, is more popular 
than ever as a text in developing coun- 
tries where sophisticated labs are yet 
to be built. At least the aftermath of 
war in one instance had a beneficial 
effect on education, but it is the gla- 
ring exception when any single good 
thing comes of war. 
More characteristically, war is the 
destroyer of schools and all permanent 
centres of learning and culture. It 
leaves the children who survive it 
starving, psychologically scarred and 
almost totally cut off from any chance 
to develop themselves into productive 
members of their society. 
Hundreds of thousands of Pales- 
tinian refugees, spread across Jordan, 
Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, were suffer- 
ing these torments when, in 1950, 
Unesco and the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency undertook to set 
up some temporary kind of education 
for them. At first the schools and 
teaching methods were very makeshift, 
but as the years passed, proper 
schools were built and enrolment went 
up to about a quarter of a million 
students, in both primary school and 
in three years of high school. 
Neither Unesco nor UNRWA realized 
what a gigantic project they were 
undertaking, and even now, it survives 
from year to year, depending on the 
voluntary gifts of governments and 
private organizations, and with the help 
of the educational systems already 
established where the refugees found 
themselves. 
S you can imagine, to run 
these schools involves some touchy 
diplomatic manoeuvering. After the 
Israeli-Arab war of 1967, many schools 
were again closed because of war 
damage, and refugees were again 
moved. Wherever they went, schools 
were pasted together again, some- 
times in tents, sometimes in the open 
air, and even in the midst of chaos, the 
learning process was kept alive. 
Also, some local texbooks were 
considered in certain quarters to have 
highly charged ideological content, 
and so Unesco experts were called 
upon to develop “neutral” Arabic 
teaching materials.

## [Page 25](053853engo.pdf#page=25) 0

### 53854: Seasons of the mind

As another result of the war in 
1967, students in Gaza could not take 
their secondary school leaving exami- 
nations. Not only was their path to 
university effectively blocked, but they 
had no way to finalize the years of 
study they had already done. 
In a very courageous series of diplo- 
matic manceuvres, Unesco arranged 
to have the exams, set in Cairo, flown 
into the Gaza strip by way of Cyprus. 
The exams were then administered by 
Unesco people, flown back to Cyprus 
and on to Cairo to be marked. Finally, 
the grades were returned and the first 
year that this tactic was used, a thous- 
and students were allowed to cross 
the Suez canal, under the supervision 
of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, to continue their studies at 
the universities of Egypt. 
Had there been no international 
organization such as Unesco in exis- 
tence, there would have been no 
channel for all the complicated nego- 
tiations and these students would, in 
all likelihood, still be stalled with no 
diploma and no hope of getting one. 
NOTHER thorny problem 
that Unesco has been facing is figuring 
out just what a diploma is worth. Does 
a diploma earned at the University of 
Moscow mean the same as a licence 
earned at the Sorbonne, for example? 
The question seems purely academic 
unless you happen to be a student 
with a B.A. in one country trying to 
get your credentials translated into 
different terms before you can con- 
tinue your studies abroad. 
In this area, Unesco is still at the 
stage of collecting data and assem- 
bling position papers, but as part of 
its year-to-year programme, it pub- 
lishes two very helpful books, called 
“Study Abroad” and “Vacation Study 
Abroad” to help make it easier for 
young people to broaden the range of 
their studies and move freely within 
the international world of learning. 
Not only do these books list courses 
of study, but they also give all- 
important information about scholar- 
ships. lt is thanks to one of these well- 
thumbed volumes that many an enter- 
prising young person has been able, 
not only to study abroad, but to have 
most of his way paid for the experi- 
ence as well. 
As a further step toward inter- 
national education, Unesco is studying 
the possibility of setting up an Inter- 
national University, at the request of 
the United Nations itself. Such a 
futuristic undertaking is still a dream 
which is yet to come true, but as a 
concrete step toward transcending 
political boundaries in the pursuit of 
learning, Unesco arranges for co-op- 
eration between established universi- 
ties and technical schools and their 
newborn counterparts thousands of 
miles apart. 
Sometimes, to create a flow of infor- 
mation into a country which might 
suddenly need a supply of trained 
technicians or educational leaders, for 
example, it gives its own scholarships 
for qualified people to study abroad. 
In other cases, it gives money to artists 
who have gained a certain reputation 
at home to go abroad to learn new 
techniques or, by osmosis, enrich the 
fabric of life from which they create. 
In many cases, these scholarships 
go beyond basic training and involve 
renewing or enriching the knowledge 
that people, some of them no longer 
young, already have. 
Aside from its interests in all stages 
of formal education, Unesco has come 
to realize that when you finally have 
your degree in your hand, no matter 
what level it may be, you are not 
necessarily “educated”... period. The 
fund of information about any subject 
grows by leaps and bounds, some- 
times in a matter of months, so how 
can you say that even though you 
earned a diploma five years ago, you 
still know your subject ? 
DUCATION, as Unesco 
has come to use the term, no longer 
refers to a period in one's youth spent 
outside society absorbing facts, but a 
continuous process which starts with 
being born and ends, ideally, with 
death. This new concept of “conti- 
nuing education” sounds all very well 
on paper and Unesco's work in educ- 
ational planning is being done with it in 
mind as an organizing principle; but 
when you ask specifically how far 
anyone has gone in applying it, you 
learn that only the barest beginnings 
have been made. 
And “continuing education” simply 
can't be put off any longer. Every one 
of us has known someone who man- 
aged to achieve an education in this 
wider sense and we have to respect 
his brightness and modernity of think- 
ing, but the way knowledge is explod- 
ing, the chances that people will be 
able to do the same thing for them- 
selves in the future become slimmer 
and slimmer. 
One thing everyone agrees upon is 
that present educational systems 
everywhere will have to become much 
more flexible and open-ended and that 
each individual is going to have to 
learn to admit when his education 
has stopped working for him and 
doesn’t apply to the world as he finds 
it; in other words, the systems of 
learning will have to keep up with the 
exciting, fast-moving world they are 
concerned with and the individual will 
have to keep up with them. 
T took us several gener- 
ations before man's schools caught 
up with Galileo's idea that the earth 
rotated around the sun; no one can 
afford to move that slowly any more. 
In all probability a thirty-year-old today 
was never taught about the DNA 
molecule, a crucial breakthrough in 
twentieth century science, so unless a 
whole generation is sent back to their 
books er somehow re-informed, they 
will find themselves at forty-five about 
as far behind in understanding as if 
they still believed the earth was the 
centre of the solar system. 
The very heart of education should 
be change and regeneration both in 
what man knows and how he thinks; 
too often in the past it has been an 
instrument of stultification and dogma, 
and will continue to be until govern- 
ments and each one of us realizes 
that, in ‘spite of all the educationai 
statistics and diplomas in the world, 
there can be no such thing as an “edu- 
cated man”, only a man “becoming 
educated”. 
A full system of education based on 
that understanding and taking in an 
entire population has yet to be achiev- 
ed by any nation, developing or “dev- 
eloped”, but that is the ultimate goal 
which Unesco holds up for itself and 
for all its member states. As a goal 
it is both an ideal and a necessity for 
the near future—our lives must be 
our education and our education must 
be our life. [|

The mind 
bright 
and stron 
N the fifteenth of May, 
1968, yet another conference to 
plan the programme for the next 
two years was going on at Unesco 
headquarters, against the background 
of the great wnite womanly Henry 
Moore sculpture, the Miro tiles and 
the beautifully manicured lawns. 
Perhaps the most unsettling thing 
about the place was an enigmatic 
Picasso, which gave the suggestion of 
a wild and embarrassing private 
laughter. Otherwise, all went as usual, 
but there was a new feeling in the air. 
These were the days of the famous 
“événements”, the student strikes, in 
France. 
There were rumours that the 
meetings would be picketed by youth- 
ful demonstrators, the city was on the 
verge of being paralysed by strikes 
and, as it turned out, a whole new 
segment of history was beginning—a 
chain reaction of demonstrations, con- 
frontations, conflicts and uneasy 
ententes between angry young people 
and “establishments” throughout the 
world. 
This wave of action went beyond 
individual countries and regimes, the 
youth of the world were speaking 
out—some against elements of their 
society, some against the protesters. 
And where violence could be avoided, 
they proved to be articulate indeed. 
As people who worked at Unesco 
looked out from their offices while 
the turbulence swept past them, as 
they sat up all night at the public 
meetings or took part in street-corner 
debates, a great deal of soul-searching 
was going on. Unesco had had, right 
from the beginning, a department of 
youth, concerned with the réle of 
young people in redeveloping a 
burned-out Europe. 
On top of that, most of Unesco’s 
activities had to do with young people, 
but with the exception of a few 
isolated individuals within the org- 
anization, the explosions came as a 
complete surprise. At least, Unesco 
people had the consolation that they 
were no more shocked than anyone 
else by the outbreaks throughout the 
world, but somewhere there lurked 
the suspicion that they should have 
been able to predict such a phe- 
nomenon. 
Up to that point, Unesco’s activities 
had dealt with young people who

were, in the vernacular, very “straight”. 
These were the young men and 
women who eagerly joined Unesco 
clubs in developing countries, who 
participated in its world-wide pro- 
gramme for physical fitness, and who 
promised to be the bright young 
leaders of tomorrow. Their social 
commitment was of a traditional sort 
which could find expression through 
conventional channels, but by the 
early 1960s, even their participation 
had become more and more per- 
functory. 
Because it was so closely tied in 
with governments and because it was 
part of a United Nations system 
which was no longer looked upon as 
a radical experiment in peace-keeping, 
Unesco was getting the image of 
being stuck with youth as part of its 
job, but not really involved with their 
problems and interests. It seemed the 
last place for young people to go 
with their opinions for change. With 
the General Conference of 1968, an 
all-out effort was begun to change 
that thinking. 
There were some goverments which 
deeply opposed the idea of young 
people having a voice in an interna-

tional organization. They had been 
willing to admit that young people 
should be educated but were not so 
happy when it became time for 
students to start expressing what they 
thought. Already, education was 
having its effect on the world com- 
munity, whether the men and women in 
authority liked it or not. 
Despite such opposition, Unesco 
was in the moral position of a teacher 
who with the highest motives stim- 
ulates his students, encouraging and 
rewarding their ability to think for 
themselves, and who suddenly finds 
that he is more deeply involved in 
their lives than he suspected. To cut 
off dialogue and deny their right to 
develop their opinions when things get 
dangerous, is a denial of all that he 
has done with them and of all that 
he stands for. 
Unesco had always talked about 
and relied upon the idealism of young 
people and their capacity for change, 
but slowly the realization was be- 
ginning to dawn that young people 
now grow up faster than those 
of previous generations, and that there 
is in them, not only a strong moral 
sense, but also a scepticism and 
Throughout the world Unesco Clubs have proved to be one 
of the most effective means for promoting the ideas and 
ideals of Unesco amongst young people. Unesco clubs now 
number 1,500 in 50 countries. Young people in Japan (above) 
have formed over 400 such clubs, a total surpassed only by 
France which has nearly 450. In Spain, Friends of Unesco 
Clubs exist in several major cities. They arrange lectures, 
plays, concerts and exhibitions and provide a forum for 
discussions on local, national and international problems. 
Through Unesco Gift Coupons, people in many countries have 
participated directly in the work of Unesco, by providing 
school or scientific equipment, books and supplies to projects 
in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Donor 
groups buy Gift Coupons and mail them directly to the 
project of their choice, and in this way more than $2.5 million 
have gone to help literacy and adult education projects, 
schools, libraries and museums in developing countries.

Young people can speak and work for

to make sure that they have a chance

THE MIND BRIGHT AND STRONG (Continued) 
and twenty-five government masters 
(with varying amounts of success) that 
youth must be listened to, and more 
important, that they must be able to 
participate in a real way in making 
policy and sharing genuine responsi- 
bility within the social structure. 
There is perhaps no more degrad- 
ing and infuriating position for a young 
person to find himself in than that of 
being a “token” youth, going through 
the motions of being on a commission 
or having an impressive-sounding job, 
when in reality he has no influence, 
and is just filling a post to make his 
society “look good”. 
Unesco and the entire United Nations 
system found out the dangers of 
putting young people in a “lets pre- 
tend” mock-up of a real institution at 
the World Youth Assembly, at United 
Nations headquarters in New York. 
As part of the twenty-fifth anniversary 
celebration in the summer of 1970, 
this was to be a United Nations Assem- 
bly of young people (some of whom 
turned out to be not so young) going 
through the ritual of peaceful nego- 
tiations. 
Headlines about it splashed across 
the newspapers of the world. “World 
Youth Assembly: Parroting of Elders’ 
Slogans in Familiar Disputes Obs- 
cures Agreement on War”. “Youth As- 
sembly Clashes Over Move to Oust 
Delegates”. “UN Youth Drone on like 
Statesmen”. “UN Youth Assembly 
Comes to Tumultuous Ending”. 
It finished in frustration and embarr- 
assment for all. Most people came 
away with the disheartening suspicion 
that the “new generation” was going 
to keep making the same stupid mis- 
takes as the last and that, from this 
sample at least, they had less tolerance 
and goodwill than their elders. What 
good suggestions might have been 
made by the delegates got lost in the 
dramatic press coverage, but then, 
since there were no plans for a con- 
crete follow-up to the conference, they 
would have been wasted anyway. 
One striking fact of modern society 
throughout the world is that there 
is almost no way in which an estab- 
lished government or institution can 
find out what its young people are 
really thinking. Any such attempt is 
bound to be hit-and-miss at best. 
Often, when confronted with official 
surveys or questionings, young people, 
like everybody else, are forced into 
polemics. Or else, when a youth 
organization gathers a sampling of 
opinion, it is often one-sided and 
refers almost solely to specific local 
issues which are of little relevance 
outside a limited area 
Thus Unesco, with the somewhat 
apprehensive but expectant approval 
of its member governments, is under- 
taking the job of finding out what young 
people are thinking, not just in this 
country or that, but beyond the arbi- 
trary divisions of political units. 
Maybe there is a world movement 
in thought toward pacifism, toward un- 
derstanding, toward honesty and open- 
ness in young people, but until Unesco 
can build a storehouse of data about 
youth and get a valid flow of opinion 
between young people and all the 
world's establishments, nobody will 
know for sure. And even then, the 
pile of facts and attitudes will take 
some very wise and clear-headed 
interpretation. 
EANWHILE, Unesco's pro- 
gramme involves a lot of talking and 
listening but that is just what there 
hasn't been enough of up to now— 
young people hammering out their 
positions at youth conferences, young 
people in the Secretariat making them- 
selves heard on matters of policy and 
administration, youth organizations 
working on studies for Unesco. Every 
aspect of Unesco's programme is 
somehow implicated, from education to 
ecology research, to the phenomenon 
of a self-sustaining “youth” culture. 
The goal of the programme, however, 
is to get some action, and Unesco has 
made a modest beginning by having 
young people come to work in the 
Secretariat as summer interns, by re- 
cruiting and training others for more 
permanent jobs at headquarters and 
in the field, by strongly suggesting that 
each country include at least one young 
person on its commission to Unesco's 
General Conference. Naturally, the 
number of individuals involved is quite 
small, and some governments simply 
don't buy the idea at all, so there are 
fewer people involved than there 
should be, 
On the other hand, some member 
states have decided to go one step fur- 
ther and take advantage of Unesco 
experts in approaching their own 
young people. Several countries, for 
example, have asked for help in 
arriving at national youth policies, If 
such policies function as they are 
meant to, they will involve youth di- 
rectly with the government and give 
them a chance to contribute to the 
development of their society. 
Only too often the talents of young 
people are wasted to their countries 
because what they studied has no rele- 
vance to their society. At the outset of 
their otherwise productive lives they 
find themselves without jobs. That 
bleak, soul-destroying reality is what 
is behind all the neat, precise statis- 
tics concerning “trained, unemployed 
youth” in many countries, both dev- 
eloping and developed. They are the 
“casualties” which come about from 
the lack of national or regional educa- 
tional planning. 
Even if you get a job after your 
training, often a lot of time has 
been wasted by following outmoded or 
irrelevant courses of study. Instead of 
leaving the planning of curricula, and 
university and school policy solely to 
grey-haired administrators, it has for 
many years been Unesco's contention 
that young people should have a say 
in what they study. 
Again, in this instance, Unesco can 
make suggestions, point out the advan- 
tages to individual institutions and 
share the knowledge of what other 
young people have contributed toward 
planning their studies, but uitimately 
the decision rests with the particular 
university or high-school, and with the 
initiatives that students are willing to 
take on their own. 
Up to now we have been referring 
to “youth” as being almost syn- 
onymous with “student”, as indeed it" 
is in the minds of most people; sup- 
posedly “youth” are the young people 
who are in a position to organize them- 
selves and be viewed as the synthetic 
entity that is talked about in the press 
and in social analysis. 
But what about the large number of 
students who shun any form of org- 
anized statement and keep their asso- 
ciations as open and flexible as pos- 
sible? What about the young man with 
almost no schooling wandering the 
streets of a city, alone and without 
any hope of work? What about the 
secretaries, the young office and 
factory workers? How do you reach 
them and put them into your overall 
picture of youth? 
Even more problematic, is reaching 
the millions of rural youth, who while 
they may be still in their early teens, 
have never known anything but work 
on one plot of land and are, for all 
intents and purposes, as aged as the 
land itself. These people, too, are 
“youth” although they wouldn't recog- 
nize themselves as part of their own 
generations; if Unesco could reach 
them, especially, and could act as a 
channel for them to express their needs 
in education and in their work, they 
might eventually come to share some 
of the pleasures of being young. 
There are a few youth organizations 
concerned with young blue-collar wor- 
kers and with whom Unesco can work, 
but otherwise, except for a few per- 
sonal contacts, all these masses of 
young people are virtually out of the 
reach of Unesco’s efforts. 
There are, however, the radical 
young who want to be heard in an

## [Page 29](053853engo.pdf#page=29) 0

### 53854: Seasons of the mind

international forum, the ad hoc groups 
who are straining to make their griev- 
ances and their angers heard. They 
are far beyond the governmental 
channels through which Unesco op- 
erates and, naturally, the prospect of 
an international radical conference 
makes member states very, very 
uneasy. They expect the delegates 
to rip the place apart, but probably 
the official fears are too extreme. 
In reality, this could just be the 
chance radical spokesmen were all 
looking for to say what they had to 
say in perspective, and in the context 
of other young people who had diffi- 
culties of their own which might make 
any personal gripes look unbelievably 
small. Anyway, out of it all would 
come a very sharp-edged sense of 
what was genuinely unjust and unfair, 
and what, in the human state of 
civilized compromise, was intolerable. 
O matter for whom, the 
voiceless, disenfranchised youth of 
the world or the articulate, well- 
informed sceptics of society, Unesco 
could offer a latitude of expression 
they could get nowhere else in the 
world. It is admittedly not an easy 
task, nor a role that Unesco is totally 
relaxed in dealing with, but youth is 
becoming constantly a larger percent- 
age of the world's population and a 
larger force to be reckoned with, so 
Unesco maybe can become its spokes- 
man and, if necessary, its official 
support in a push for human and 
spiritual rights. 
Maybe. Unesco can never become 
a fast-paced espouser of causes, but 
its ability to be of use to the young 
people of the world is yet to be 
tested. Perhaps its governmental res- 
ponsibilities will prove too confining, 
perhaps they can be got round. 
In the case of bringing exams to the 
refugees of the Gaza strip, the per- 
sonal considerations won out; in this 
extreme instance, diplomacy and per- 
sonal goodwill broke through all the 
red-tape and ugliness of war in favour 
of a handful of young people. 
Hopefully, where youth in general 
is concerned, Unesco will have the 
same good results; in effect, it is doing 
a juggling act which up to now isn't 
fully appreciated either by govern- 
ments (some of whom accuse Unesco 
of butting in) or by the young them- 
selves. 
A thankless task? Perhaps, but as 
one member of the Secretariat puts it, 
“ if we don't try to put a word in for 
youth on an international scale, then 
show me somebody else in this 
messed-up world who will” [|

### IGNORE

The happy faces of these youngsters 
working on a home teletype terminal 
connected to a central computer 
suggest that science is child's play 
to modern youth. Hundreds of thou- 
sands of young people through- 
out the world belong to leisure 
time science clubs and Unesco has 
encouraged the growth of these 
clubs. Unesco has done pioneer 
work in developing new approaches, 
materials, methods and techniques 
for teaching science through four 
major pilot projects in Latin America, 
Asia, Africa and the Arab States. 
Under these projects groups of key 
individuals were brought together 
for periods of one year to re-think 
the whole approach to teaching 
various scientific subjects—Physics 
in Sao Paulo (Brazil), Chemistry in 
Bangkok (Thailand), Biology in Cape 
Coast {Ghana). and Mathematics in 
Cairo (UAR). Unesco’s Source Book 
for Science Teaching, first published 
in 1957, which describes many scien- 
tific experiments that can be carried 
out with easily available materials, 
has become a year in year out best 
seller that has appeared in 28 lan- 
guages. The explosion of scientific 
knowledge has led Unesco to pro- 
pose the establishment of a world 
pool of scientific information that 
will be instantly available to scien- 
tists everywhere. Known as the 
Unisist project, it involves working 
out methods of standardizing com- 
puter systems, linking existing infor- 
mation networks and setting up 
new information systems in coun- 
tries now without them.   


### 53854: Seasons of the mind

The 
  
inquisitive mind 
  
ODERN science is a uni- 
verse of its own, expanding at a rate 
many times greater than population 
size or economic growth. Research 
and development has now become a 
huge enterprise, consuming over 50,000 
million dollars world-wide annually and 
employing over two million scientists 
and engineers. These already astro- 
nomical figures are likely to double in 
the next five to ten years. 
Countries rich in scientists and 
technologists are “developed” and 
their wealth grows as fast as these 
men's imaginations can create new 
ideas. Without scientists, no country 
can properly be said even to be 
“developing” in this twentieth century; 
so the world is divided, as some say, 
into “have-science” and “have-not- 
science” nations, the former getting 
richer and richer and the latter getting 
farther and farther behind. 
No wonder then that policy-making 
has become so important in the effort 
to bring some order to this situation. 
The scientific establishment can no 
longer ignore the fact that science has 
been thrown into the arena of public 
debate. 
Unesco has undertaken to interest 
developing countries in instituting poli- 
cies for the organization of their own 
scientific enterprise and for the devel- 
opment of their own technological 
capability. This means seeking ans- 
wers to questions such as: should a 
country rely on its own research and 
development, such as it is, or should 
it import technology? Should it train 
its researchers on the spot or should 
it send them abroad, with the risk that 
they may be destined to become part 
of the brain drain? 
A country must first of all ask the 
most fundamental of questions: what 
resources are available for carrying 
out its own research and development? 
All these questions can be answered 
provided the country has policy- 
making organs to carry out the neces- 
sary fact-finding surveys and analyses 
and then take appropriate decisions. 
By providing assistance in setting 
up such organs and sending con- 
sultants to advise them in critical 
decision-making, Unesco has helped 
countries of the Third World to 
decide what science, and how much 
of it, was good for them. 
In the basic matter of training scien- 
tists, Unesco’s work overlaps its 
general work in education and in each 
case the same ground-rules apply. As 
a matter of survival, science teaching 
must be as advanced and excellent as 
possible. Where a country must start 
from scratch, Unesco attempts to lay 
the groundwork; when science teach- 
ing is already under way, Unesco can 
supply the research and experts to im- 
prove it and bring it up to date. 
Although at first thought, it would 
seem that you could graft a scien- 
tific habit of mind onto an individual 
from any culture, in actual fact, scien- 
tific of technical education only 
“takes” when it is treated as part of 
the whole personality. 
As an extreme case in point, in 
many African countries, the only 
high school biology texts formerly 
available were those which described 
the flora and fauna of the European 
country where it was originally pre- 
pared; thus, many trained biologists 
might learn a great deal about English 
hedgerows, for instance, instead of

THE INQUISITIVE MIND (Continued) 
about their own surroundings. The 
absurdity of the situation is apparent, 
but it took Unesco to finance the 
costly, and time-consuming project of 
creating a truly African course of 
study in biology. 
Similarly, in the training of engi- 
neers, with the use of pilot projects 
in different parts of the world, an 
attempt has been made to train men 
whose skills will be precisely relevant 
to the needs of their own industries 
and their own societies; machines, 
buildings, modes of transportation 
vary, and so should the educational 
experiences that prepare men for 
planning, building and maintaining 
them. 
Unesco is in the process of dis- 
. covering what countries have common 
economic and physical conditions in 
an attempt to share the information 
that each one has arrived at by trial 
and error, and save its corresponding 
nation, which may be on the other 
side of the world, from going through 
the same slow process. 
  
HEN you finally do become 
a scientist or an engineer, the problem 
of keeping up with new developments 
is monumental. This is a field where 
things are happening so fast, that 
unless you do keep up, you not only 
are out of date in your information, but 
for all intents and purposes, you cease 
to be a member of your profession. A 
scientist in 1970 who is still using the 
knowledge he had in 1965 and nothing 
elise might as well be an alchemist 
trying to change lead to gold by 
muttering a magic chant over it. 
Till the 1950s an individual could 
stay abreast of his field if he read 
every article as it came out and spent 
all his waking time on his “permanent 
education”. Today, however, in the 
natural sciences alone, close to three 
million articles are published in the 
world per year, not to mention the 
scientific books and pamphlets which 
seem to appear by the library-full. 
To take in even a tiny, specialized 
area of all this, the mind would simply 
burst, and the world would be full of 
“mad scientists” indeed. 
Just as the computer has made pos- 
sible all this humanly-impossible 
research and documentation, so only 
the computer can manage to keep pace 
with it. How much of this scientific 
output is repetition of the same ex- 
periments and what general trends 
emerge from the great bulk, only a 
computer can tell. Unesco can compile 
bibliographies of some of the works 
being published, but that is only an 
organized list of titles. The content 
of it all is what really matters. 
How much more straightforward the 
problem would be if only all the com- 
puters of the world spoke the same 
language, and the information could 
be pooled and made available as soon 
as it was arrived at. If only consistent 
terms of reference, of measurement 
could be agreed upon, if only com- 
puter systems themselves could be 
standardized. 
To this end, Unesco has under- 
taken to create Unisist, a World Scien- 
ce Information System. It is still in 
the planning stages, but it promises 
to revolutionize past thinking about 
the nature of scientific knowledge 
itself. No country or group of scien- 
tists will be obliged to become part 
of it but, hopefully, as its fund of 
information and analyses increases to 
vast proportions, no individual interest- 
ed in scientific enquiry will be able to 
resist using it. 
Of course, at first the new kind of 
sharing that Unisist requires, both of 
individual scientists and nations, will 
take some getting used to. Private 
discoveries will less and less be con- 
sidered as private property for exploi- 
tation and gain, but as part of the 
world's storehouse for mutual benefit. 
International co-operation of this 
kind, Unesco has proved, actually can 
work. Although the task of exploring 
space has been carried out by indivi- 
dual nations with their own budget and 
programmes, man has begun to 
explore his other great unfathomable 
frontier, the ocean, in a concerted 
international effort put together by 
Unesco. 
For starters, they tackled the Indian 
Ocean for six years. Ships and 
scientists from 25 nations criss- 
crossed its waters taking samples, 
sounding the bottom in order to map 
its cold, black reaches, exploring its 
currents, recording its plant and ani- 
mal life. The ships and equipment 
varied from sophisticated gadgets on 
floating labs, to bottles tossed over the 
sides of fishing boats... and the infor- 
mation poured in from all quarters. 
It brought with it some interesting 
surprises; for one thing, scientists had 
long believed that there was a strong 
fast current racing northward along 
the east coast of Africa, which they 
named the Somali current, but it had 
never been charted nor its speed mea- 
sured before this expedition. And 
indeed the current did exist, but what 
came as a bit of a shock was dis- 
covering that, unlike any other, it disap- 
pears for half the year; when the 
south-west monsoons are blowing, it 
sweeps northward almost twice as fast 
as the Gulf Stream, but when the 
monsoon ends and the prevailing wind 
direction reverses, it becomes a gentle 
southerly drift. 
In effect, the scientists found that 
with the monsoon winds they had 
the use of a gigantic natural fan which 
switched on and off. Instead of having 
to theorize about what winds over 
the ocean's surface did to the 
current, for the first time they 
could actually measure their effect, as 
if the whole expanse of water were 
one vast laboratory. 
  
NE other thing they wanted 
to figure out was why the Indian 
Ocean doesn't seem to produce its 
fair share of fish compared to other 
oceans. The irony is that around it 
are the world's most densely populated 
countries where the need for fish 
protein is most desperate. Yet, for 
some reason not yet explained, the 
explorers discovered that there are 
layers of water in the Indian Ocean 
which have very little oxygen content 
and when they rise to the surface, the 
plant and animal life is suffocated. 
They did find one great upwelling 
of water, however, which was teem- 
ing with sea life, but it takes the most 
modern trawling equipment to harvest 
its wealth. Here is the food, tan- 
talizingly close, but out of the reach 
of those who need it and available 
only to nations rich enough to scoop 
it up for themselves. 
To whom does the wealth of the 
oceans really belong, the mineral de- 
posits on its floor and its other untapp- 
ed resources? No satisfactory agree- 
ment has yet been reached, but as 
further exploration goes on in the 
Mediterranean, the South Atlantic and 
the Western Pacific, and as oceano- 
graphic ships stumble upon great 
stockpiles of mineral wealth just out

In 1948, Unesco launched an international programme of research into the world’s arid zones, which 
cover a third of its land surface. Thousands of scientists from some 40 countries collaborated 
in studies ranging from underground water research, climatology, solar and wind energy to plant, 
human and animal ecology. The International Hydrological Decade, launched by Unesco in 1965, is an 
extension to this programme. Photo above shows experiment carried out in Algeria with Unesco 
aid in 1954 on how camels can survive for long spells in the desert without water. Here camel’s weight 
is checked after beast was deprived of water for eight days. Left, research being carried out on hydro- 
ponics—growing crops without any soil. Here an American pomologist (fruit-tree specialist) tends

sponsored research projects on plant physiology and has also studied the special arid land 
problem of saline soils and saline underground water in relation to irrigation, and in 1962 it organized 35 
a study symposium in Tashkent on this question in collaboration with the Academies of Science of 
the USSR and Uzbekistan. Above left, section of a vast concrete irrigation canal under construction

THE INQUISITIVE MIND 
(Continued from page 32) 
of reach (as they accidentally did in 
the Red Sea), the need to have some 
agreement worked out among the 
United Nations becomes more and 
more acute. 
Though the bounty which nature 
holds out sometimes tends to make 
individuals greedy and self-seeking, 
the violence of nature often brings 
them together, whether they like it or 
not, in a common effort to survive. 
As the crust of the earth shudders and 
jars in violent quakes, as wailing hur- 
ricanes sweep the landscape clean, it 
seems to be flaunting its prodigious 
might in the face of man's puny efforts. 
Like children we cling together in 
- helpless panic. 
Although such natural disasters 
cannot be avoided, with international 
co-operation we may someday be able 
to predict and prepare for them. 
Seismology, a relatively new science, 
has gone a long way toward record- 
ing and describing the shock waves 
of earthquakes after the fact, and 
through Unesco, these findings have 
been made generally available; the 
next step will be to put it all together 
and try to discover the underlying 
patterns of the eruptions in the earth's 
crust. That done, man may someday 
be able to predict precisely when and 
where one is going to hit in time for 
people to save themselves. 
As an interim measure, the new 
branch of seismic research called 
earthquake engineering is given to 
studying designs and methods of cons- 
truction for buildings that will be earth- 
quake proof. Hopefully, one day if 
you live in an earthquake area you 
will be warned to evacuate your home 
for a few hours and when the shocks 
are over you will come back to a build- 
ing still intact, perhaps with a picture 
or two off the wall and a few dishes 
broken if you haven't had time to 
pack them; what is now certain disas- 
ter may in future be just a routine 
inconvenience. 
Research in any branch of science 
has become so complex that now no 
single country can afford all the pro- 
jects that present themselves nor 
supply the broad range of specialists 
necessary. In nuclear research, for 
example, the price of equipment and 
trained people is astronomical, and 
Unesco long ago saw the need for 
international co-operation. The Secre- 
tariat thus became instrumental in form- 
ing the European Organization for 
Nuclear Research, better known as 
CERN, whose scope, with Unesco 
backing, has grown to the point that it 
is now in the process of building 
the world's largest particle accelerator 
Although projects in the life scien- 
ces may seem less monumental, in 
effect they are also unbelievably expen- 
sive. The task of studying the embryo- 
logy of mammals by growing a mouse 
in a test-tube takes a new blending of 
biology, chemistry, fluid mechanics for 
the artificial placenta, electronic 
sophistication, etc. 
Brain research, cell research—both 
demand the wealth of a Croesus, liter- 
ally hundreds of researchers and the 
painstaking accumulation of minutiae— 
identifying a chemical substance, per- 
fecting a complicated technique, subt- 
ly modifying someone else's theory. 
These are indeed tasks for the world. 
The goals of modern science may 
seem earth-shattering, but if we are 
to come close to understanding and 
recreating the processes that gave us 
our own life, we must act as one 
life and one scientific mind. a

BULWARKS 
AGAINST 
DISASTER 
Over the years, Unesco’'s work in the field of science has 
included a broad programme on the study and prevention of 
natural disasters—earthquakes, tsunamis (seismic sea waves), 
floods and volcanic eruptions. Unesco has an international 
roster of natural disaster specialists who can be called upon 
to rush to a disaster-stricken area to study an earthquake 
or other calamity. Photo left shows world famous volcanolo- 
gist Haroun Tazieff studying the Irazu eruption in Costa Rica, 
during a Unesco emergency mission in 1964. Up to 1970, over 
20 Unesco missions had made on-the-spot studies of earth- 
quake-hit areas, including Skoplje (Yugoslavia), Ancash (Peru) 
and Dasht-e Bayaz (Iran). Japan is one of the world’s most 
experienced countries in earthquake engineering, and that is 
why Unesco, in collaboration with the U.N. Special Fund, set 
up the International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake 
Engineering in Tokyo, to provide courses for non-Japanese 
trainees from earthquake-prone countries. Photo, below 
left, shows the unique ‘* shaking table ’ or vibration-causing 
machine located at the Japanese Government Building Research 
Institute in Tokyo and which is regularly used by students from 
the International Institute. Unesco also helped to set up the 
International Seismological Centre in Edinburgh, Scotland, 
which collects and processes data from a world-wide network 
of more than 600 observatories. Flood prediction and preven- 
tion are two other aspects of Unesco’s efforts for protection 
against disasters, and these are linked with the Unesco- 
sponsored Hydrological Decade. In this connexion, the mathe- 
matical model set up by Unesco (with the aid of a com- 
puter) for the development of the Mekong River delta has 
been used incidentally for the prediction of floods in Cambodia.

### IGNORE

URTLING through a death- 
dealing and hostile environment, we 
are all clinging to the surface of a 
great ball of rock which we call earth. 
By a series of coincidences not yet 
explained, about three thousand million 
years ago a thin and fragile layer 
began to develop around this ball; 
as energy poured into it from the sun, 
the conditions necessary for life and 
the elaborate processes for sustaining 
it were set into motion. Oxygen and 
water were created and they in turn 
made it possible for plants to survive. 
Then animal life first appeared, and as 
the masterpiece of its evolution came 
man. One system of life was trans- 
muted to support the next and ali 
worked in an exquisite balance, 
  
This thin miraculously organized 
layer, the biosphere, seemed cosy and 
inexhaustible until man in all his 
cleverness found that he had pushed 
its resources. No one even now knows 
just what happens to it when you set 
off an atomic explosion in it, or when 
you shoot a rocket vehicle through it 
and out into space. No one knows 
when its supplies of resources to 
sustain life, its water and its oxygen, 
will run out and the planet will slowly 
die. 
What became increasingly obvious 
to scientists, long before the discussion 
of ecology became popular, was that 
man was pushing his luck, draining and 
wasting precious resources in a mind- 
less, suicidal way. What is particu- 
larly obvious to scientists, also, is that 
no one country can save the biosphere 
by itself. Some are worse polluters, 
greater exploiters and disrupters of 
nature than others, but all suffer the 
consequences. 
From Unesco's work in oceano- 
graphy, it is clear that the ocean itself 
is in danger of becoming a sewer. 
Just to dump a bit of waste into its

depths seems literally like a drop in 
a bucket, but who knows where that 
bit of pollution may be carried by the 
currents and what effect it may have 
on the freshness of the sea. 
Just drop ever so small an amount 
of copper into a pond and see what 
happens to the fish in it, or even 
worse, add an infinitesimal bit of 
organic mercury and, although the fish 
and the algae they feed on may sur- 
vive, they will concentrate it in their 
bodies to such an extent that they will 
poison anyone who eats them. 
On land, to irrigate a large arid area 
may seem like a great step forward 
for one particular area, but what is it 
going to do to the weather in a neigh- 
bouring country? It seems that for 
any easy “progress” within the sys- 
tems of the biosphere, somewhere else 
a price must be paid. 
DDT and other chlorinated hydro- 
carbons have become part of the 
twentieth century way of life, elimin- 
ating the insects that carry malaria and 
typhus, killing pests that ruin crops, 
and even preserving manufactured tex- 
tiles against moths. It is small wonder 
then that traces of DDT have been 
found as far afield as in the penguins 
of Antarctica, to whom it was carried 
in plants and fish. It takes no great 
sleuth to suspect that the mysterious 
disappearance of whole colonies of sea 
birds fits into the same pattern of 
evidence. 
And the pesticides set up, with 
man's help, a little eco-system of their 
own. In one extraordinary case, farm 
chickens that had never been allowed 
out into the field showed traces of 
DDT. Where could it possibly have 
come from? What had happened was 
like some ghoulish nursery rhyme: 
the farmers sprayed the farmland 
with chemicals; wind and rain washed 
it into the sea; sea plants picked it 
up; fish ate the plants; fishermen 
caught the fish; the fish was made 
into meal; the meal was sold to the 
farmers, and the full cycle from farm 
back to farm was complete, polluting 
everything it touched along the way. 
Perhaps the most frightening thing 
about the whole story is that the pesti- 
cide has become part of the cycle of 
winds and condensed water, the hydro- 
logical cycle. As part of water 
droplets, pollution can literally range 
anywhere over the globe, and deposit 
its deadly self thousands of miles from 
where it was taken up. So far the 
hydrological cycle is a life-giving one, 
but it must be carefully studied and 
maintained or we will all be in dire 
trouble, 
Unesco has set aside ten years for 
the study of hydrology throughout the 
world. Just how much available water 
is there? Where is it? The way it 
is being used, how long will the supply 
last? By melting some of the polar 
ice caps how much could the supply 
be increased without raising the 
ocean level? 
HERE are several untapped 
reservoirs in the world, such as the 
upper basin of the Rio Paraguay in 
the Mato Grosso of South America; 
the area is called the Pantanal, from 
the Portugese word meaning “marsh- 
land”, and in all it is almost the size 
of France. In a joint project under- 
taken by Unesco and the government 
of Brazil, it is being explored and its 
fresh water wealth measured and 
opened for development, not only for 
Brazil but ultimately for Bolivia and 
Paraguay as well. 
Just one more way of telling a highly 
industrialized, developed country from 
a developing one is the amount of 
water each person in it consumes.

closely with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and

‘Unesco mission was sent to the Galapagos Islands to see how this unique 
zoological site could be preserved. As a result the Charles Darwin Foun-

“aid, was inaugurated in 1964. In Africa, a Unesco mission headed by Sir . 
40 Julian Huxley made an on-the-spot investigation in 1960, of the conserva- 
tion of wild life and natural resources in Central and East Africa. A Unesco 
Regional Centre for Science and Technology, set up in Nairobi, Kenya, is 
~ now helping several African governments solve their conservation problems.

THE MIND EXTINCT ? (Continued) 
For the rich countries, the old phrase 
“spending money like water” should 
be changed to “spending water like 
money.” They have been using it as 
if the supplies were never going to 
run out, 
With all of the earth's riches, men 
have to learn to become students and 
husbandmen of nature, not its heart- 
less master. From satellites, we can 
look down on the surface of the earth 
and see areas of despoiled vegetation, 
areas where the soil has become 
salty and in which nothing can grow. 
Also, great weather patterns become 
clear to the cameras and, in short, the 
biosphere is spread out to be examin- 
ed. It is now Unesco’s job to stimu- 
late this examination, to act as a cen- 
tre to help countries plan for preserv- 
ing the resources with which they hav 
been blessed. 
NOTHER aim is to find out 
what the “danger signs” are when man 
has exceeded his limitations and 
threatens to upset the balance for 
everyone, just as miners used to take 
canaries with them when they went 
down the pits. When the bird was over- 
come by gas it was the man’s signal 
to save himself. Now when a partic- 
ular species becomes threatened or 
great natural changes take place, they 
may be warnings of a similar kind if 
only we knew how to interpret them. 
Perhaps Unesco'’s greatest contribu- 
tion to ecology is still many years off; 
it will be in establishing agreements 
between nations to protect them from 
polluting one another. Governments 
will have to face the fact that some 
system of international inspection and 
control of the environment will be an 
absolute necessity for us to survive. 
But all the agreements in the world 
will be useless if the basic problem 
is not faced squarely. The cause of 
all the earth's pollution is man, and 
with the population of the world due 
to double well before the year 2000, 
no matter how many clever solutions 
science can come up with, pollution 
will be a fact of life. We will be like 
rabbits trapped in a cage with only a 
limited supply of food, living in our 
own filth, proliferating at a crazy rate 
and frenzied in our fight for enough 
water and food to keep alive. 
The picture is not a pretty one, but 
unless population growth is stopped, 
it is inevitable. It is easy enough to 
talk about industrial pollution, chem- 
ical poisoning and the waste of

In all of Unesco's work with ecology 
the concept comes up again and 
again that more must be supplied to 
man by his environment than a ration 
of food and a little runway of earth; 
he isn't just a rabbit. His life must 
have quality as well. He must have 
room to move. a vista, colour, stimu- 
lation and affection in his world, other- 
wise he is alive only as an animal and 
not as the being “man”. 
In spite of the work of the world's 
scientists, in spite of Unesco, if we 
continue to pollute our planet and 
overrun it as we are now doing, we 
and our children will someday meet 
grey morning after grey morning wish-

Mighty forests of cedars once covered 
about half a million hectares of the

to make galleys for their navies until 
only four small groves of cedars remain- 
ed. Under the Lebanese government's 
“Green Plan”, a vast programme of 
reforestation has been undertaken. 
Along the Lebanon range young cedar 
and pine trees are being planted in 
terraces carved from the rocky hillsides, 
like those (left) above the limestone 
cliffs of the valley of the Abou Ali river. 
Unesco has played a key role in alerting 
world opinion to the importance of 
conserving natural resources. In Sep- 
tember 1968, Unesco, in co-operation 
with the UN, FAQ, WHO, the interna- 
tional Biological Programme and the 
International Union for the Conser- 
vation of Nature and Natural Resources, 
convened the first world conference 
on the rational use and conservation 
of the natural resources of the bio- 
sphere. As a result Unesco has been 
mapping out a long-term international 
programme on “Man and the Bio- 
sphere” to deal with the scientific, 
technical, educational and instutitional 
problems of the rational use of natural 
resources and the improvement of the 
environment.

IN THE MINDS OF MEN’ 
“In the Minds of Men’ is the title of a book commem- 
orating the 25th anniversary of Unesco. The book 
contains a study on Unesco by the Director-General, 
René Maheu, as well as 14 essays by distinguished figu- 
res in the world of education, culture and science, who 
have been closely associated with Unesco’s work. We 
present below brief extracts from some of these texts. 
TOWARDS AN AGE OF DIALOGUE 
Attempts at international communica- 
tion often fail. People have been 
known to come away from them frustrat- 
ed, and even in a cynical mood. And 
when these endeavours don't fail, they 
still require, usually, more energy and 
patience than communication within the 
confines of a single country. Why, 
then, does the ideal of international 
intellectual communication, for all the 
resistance and hostility it generates, 
also exercise the extraordinary appeal 
that it does? 
Obviously, it represents to many men 
a hope for peace. Or course, success- 
ful international communication is not 
a guarantee of peace. The nations of 
western Europe communicated freely 
and openly with one another for many 
years during which they also fought 
suicidal wars. Nevertheless, if the 
experience of the past is a guide, 
among the contributing causes of war 
are national stereotypes, the de-per- 
sonalization of people on the other side 
of the border, the misinterpretation of 
their intentions and even their simplest 
statements, and the incapacity to com- 
prehend that reasonable men can see 
the world very differently when they 
look at it against the background of 
an historical experience different from 
one's own. Peace cannot be won by 
better communication alone, but surely 
such communication can reduce the 
influence of factors which have made 
the road to war an easier one for 
people to take. 
CHARLES FRANKEL 
Professor of Philosophy, 
Columbia University, New York 
THE UNITY AND PLURALITY OF ASIA 
Asia is big, embracing at the start 
of Unesco over one billion people who 
today have grown to two billion. Asia 
is a plurality, containing peoples and 
nations bound by socialist, market and 
mixed economy ideologies, and adher- 
ing to the great historic religions of 
Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Chris- 
tianity. Asia is a unity in its cultural 
values and in its fight against poverty 
and destitution. Unesco has had to 
come to terms with these three basic 
characteristics of Asia—its bigness, its 
plurality and its unity. 
MALCOLM S. ADISESHIAH 
Former Deputy Director-General of Unesco 
DIRECT PARTICIPATION 
Unesco is not an academy of learn- 
ing, nor a scientific laboratory, nor a 
forum for theories and speculation. It 
is an organization for action, for co- 
operation and international aid in scien- 
ce, education and culture, and it has 
drawn up and launched a clearly-defined 
global programme to which its member 
countries have freely given their con- 
sent. The member states did not create 
Unesco merely to remain as onlookers, 
but to participate directly in this action. 
ATILIO DELL’ORO MAINI 
President of the Unesco 
General Conference (1970) 
THE EDUCATION EXPLOSION 
The “education explosion” of the last 
25 years is now to be matched by the 
requirements of quality, and educa- 
tional systems everywhere need renewal 
and transformation; the new vistas 
opened up by the emerging concept of 
lifelong education point to radical chan- 
ges in all societies, innovating from 
their own conditions and realities 
toward the paths chosen by themselves. 
In this process of development in the 
1970s, the catalytic role of Unesco in 
bringing about innovations and its pro- 
motional role for regional and interna- 
tional co-operation could provide new 
dimensions. 
PREM KIRPAL 
President of the Unesco Executive Board 
EDUCATION, A RIGHT FOR ALL 
Though not a world Ministry of Edu- 
cation, Unesco has been able per- 
sistently to emphasise the concept of 
“Non-discriminaticn” in education, an 
idea that has an unassailable moral 
force behind it... It has ceaselessly 
insisted that whatever rights are reali- 
zable must be realized as much for 
people with dark skins as with light, 
as much for girls and women as for 
boys and men, as much for persons 
of one religion as for persons of 
another.

THE SEED OF INTERNATIONALISM 
We are convinced that a world, 
where literacy is becoming universal, 
culture more internationalized and 
science not a privilege of a number of 
universities in a few countries, must 
become a more peaceful world. Ob-

7 - CULTURE 
The mind creating 
  
EMEMBER the days when 
“culture” was a luxury reserved for 
the rich and leisured to dabble with? 
Remember when some cultures were 
considered “primitive” and the stan- 
dards of “real” culture were set in 
the capitals of Europe for the 
“natives” in the rest of the world to 
imitate? In many parts of the world 
these days are still with us; the old- 
fashioned definitions die hard. 
In the nineteenth century you could 
consider yourself part of the cultural 
scene if you knew nothing about Orien- 
tal or African history and literature, 
but not any more. Whistler borrowed 
techniques from Japanese wood-block 
prints and Picasso was given a new 
sense of mass and line by African 
carvings, and through them western 
man started to have his eyes opened 
to what he was missing at first hand. 
But not many of the original works 
were available until Unesco under- 
took to do its own kind of pioneering 
and open something far more impor- 
tant than the trade routes between 
East and West, the routes of under- 
standing in literature and the arts. 
For literature, a platoon of trans- 
lators were set to work putting repre- 
sentative novels, poems and stories 
into French and English from Arabic, 
Burmese, Sinhalese, Chinese, Korean, 
Indonesian, Iranian, Hebrew, Japanese, 
Urdu, Thai, Viet-Namese, the non-Rus- 
sian languages of the U.S.S.R. and 
Indian languages including Sanskrit, 
Hindi, Bengali and Tamil. Also, with 
Unesco support, Buddhist texts writ- 
ten in Pali have been translated into 
English, along with a rare collection 
of “The Sacred Books of the East” 
from Sanskrit, Pali and Chinese. 
But the flow didn't go in just one 
direction. Dickens was translated 
into Burmese, Plutarch came out in 
Chinese, Sophocles and Moliére came 
out in Indian languages, Nietzsche was 
translated into Persian, Descartes, 
Rousseau and Voltaire into Arabic, 
Shakespeare was translated into Thai 
and Voltaire appeared in Viet-Namese, 
to mention just a few. 
Yet a classic novel about thirteenth 
century lapan, or a Shakespearean his- 
tory of sixteenth century England can 
tell only so much about the Japanese 
* or the English sensibility of the twen- 
tieth century. The process, to be 
complete, had to include works by 
contemporary writers as well. 
Choosing classic works for transla- 
tion is easy enough, but choosing a 
handful out of the hundreds of living 
writers to be translated, and investing 
money in publications which would 
probably not be a commercial success, 
required much discussion and debate 
by committees of some of the world's 
most knowledgeable scholars. 
in 1960, Unesco supported the pub- 
lication of an anthology of poetry 
which included many works by the 
Greek poet George Seferis. He was 
almost entirely unknown outside his 
own country, and in 1963 he won the 
Nobel Prize for Literature. Accidental 
good luck on Unesco's part? It was 
more than that because in 1956 Unesco 
had commissioned the first English 
translation of the Japanese novel 
“Snow Country” by Yasunari Kawa- 
bata, the 1968 winner of the Nobel 
Prize. 
Whatever the translation, classic or 
modern, Unesco will have it listed in a 
tome the size of a large telephone 
book with the formidable Latin title 
Index Translationum. If you want to 
read something from another country 
or another culture, it will list current 
works available in your own tongue. 
Language differences may be the 
most immediate barriers when it 
comes to sharing a cultural heritage, 
but there are other unexpected com- 
plications in understanding. Music, 
which you might assume would be as 
universal a voice as a smile, has its 
own vocabulary. In this case, no dic- 
tionary will begin to explain the 
differences in meaning. 
The only way a western ear can 
begin to “hear” oriental music is by 
repeatedly being exposed to what may 
at first seem like a jumble of ugly 
squawks and wails. An “eastern” 
ear has to sort through the undifferen- 
tiated roaring of a Beethoven sym- 
phony. It takes time, but eventually 
one can recognize the beauty and 
greatness of the other, 
While western music is generally 
available in the east, until Unesco pre- 
pared an anthology of oriental music 
(Japanese, Tibetan, Indian, Iranian, etc.) 
westerners had little chance of ever 
hearing it. When these records prov- 
ed so successful Unesco did the same 
thing for African music to popularize 
its characteristic rhythms and sounds. 
HE only art form that 
needs little or no translation is that of 
painting. When one particularly great 
artist sees the world in a new way, 
the vision of the whole world changes. 
In wealthy countries, brilliantly produc- 
ed art books and richly-stocked 
museums are accessible to everyone, 
but in developing countries, access to 
the world of paintings is very limited. 
So Unesco established its “museum 
without walls" which consists of sev- 
eral travelling exhibits of reproduc- 
tions and two huge compendiums of 
the world’s best colour prints. Even in 
countries where a wide range of glossy 
books is available, it would hardly be 
profitable for a publisher to do whole 
volumes on the Persian miniatures in 
the Imperial Library, Ethiopian illus- 
trated manuscripts and the Byzantine 
mosaics and frescoes of Cyprus, so 
once again Unesco seeks to make 
them available by subsidizing their 
publication. 
All these projects have concerned 
culture on the broadest possible scale, 
but one of the things that makes world 
culture so fascinating is its wonder- 
ful variety and, in many cases, the 
eccentricities of certain regions and 
sensibilities, 
A country without its own particular 
cultural flavour is like a person without 
a face. Like any expression of per- 
sonality, it comes with a growing self- 
possession, and without encourage-

Appreciation of the arts and artistic creativity should begin in childhood. Unesco has 
brought creative artists and educators together to see how this can be accomplished, and 
has helped the creation of international societies and organizations which aim to foster 
art education in schools and an appreciation of art in the community. During the past 
25 years Unesco has published a large number of books on art: large-format art albums, 
paperbacks, catalogues of colour reproductions of paintings, specialized studies and 
popular books on art. Unesco collections of records, produced in collaboration with the 
international Music Council, have brought Western, Asian and African music to a wider 
audience. In co-operation with the International Theatre Institute, Unesco has promoted 
theatre research and the use of new teaching methods in dramatic art. In co-operation 
with the International Association of Art, Unesco is organizing, to commemorate its 
25th anniversary in November 1971, an international poster contest for young artists on 
the theme “A World Fit to Live in “. In 1972 Unesco will hold a symposium for young people 
to express their views on problems that face the artist of today and to discuss the future 
of the arts throughout the world.

Unesco was first formed, one of its 
major tasks was in convincing coun-

their cultural heritage in rebuilding 
themselves. Most governments want 
to put off spending money on culture 
until everything else is taken care of, 
and of course, that never happens. 
Why do particular countries have 
tremendous explosions of creative 
energy at particular times, when com- 
munities of artists burn with a par-

Over the centuries, science has 
itself been a part of culture. A beauti- 
fully designed automobile is as much a 
cultural expression as a Pharaoh's 
chariot. As soon as you start talking 
in these terms, all the old snobbish- 
ness connected with the arts begins to 
disappear and a nation’s culture starts 
to become manageable. 
It is no accident that, around Unesco, 
culture is closely linked with the study 
of the social sciences. Before you 
can begin plotting a future cultural 
policy for part of the world, you have 
to study its past and its customs sys- 
tematically, in the largest possible 
context. This was part of the aim in 
writing a huge six-volume History of 
the Scientific and Cultural Develop- 
ment of Mankind.

just how mammoth an undertaking it

turned out to be. Most important, it 
was meant to avoid any national and 
personal prejudices, so international 
teams of scholars pooled their talents 
and tried to take in the whole human 
picture, at the same time keeping in 
mind their specific theories and 
opinions about their own fields. 
At the moment, more specific works 
are under way on specific cultural 
units—Latin American, Oceanic, Malay- 
sian, Arab and Indian. One of the 
most ambitious of them is an eight- 
volume General History of Africa. It 
will take in Africa from its pre-history 
before the seventh century B.C. to the 
present. 
Usually, doing a history involves 
ploughing through stacks of dusty 
documents and wading through a lot 
of dry facts, but in this case, the only 
way to get some of the necessary his- 
torical and social material is to listen

ACH of us owns some- 
thing that we think is priceless and 
irreplaceable. Maybe it is worth a lot 
of money; maybe it isn't worth 
anything. It might be somebody's 
picture, a collection of records, a ring... 
but whatever it is, it is something that 
has become a part of you. What if 
someone, in a fit of anger or jealousy, 
destroyed it right in front of your 
eyes? What would be your reaction? 
Fury? Helplessness? A feeling akin 
to being smashed in the stomach? 
Bombs fall and destroy the city of 
Dresden murdering thousands and 
incidentally flattening a jewel among 
cities. In the name of progress, 
ancient Egyptian temples which have 
survived for aeons of time are to be 
wiped off the face of the earth over- 
night. What feeling does that arouse? 
The same awful sense of loss? 
Probably not. For most of us it 
seems a pity that they should be 
destroyed, but since it doesn't hit us 
personally, we can't get all that excited 
about it. 
Unesco thinks differently. These 
great glories of civilization belong to 
everyone; their destruction is a direct 
loss for each of us and it is up to 
us to adamantly defend them. It 
seems ironic that the heights of man's 
achievements should have to be pre- 
served against his wars, his callous- 
ness and his violence, but what we 
have now of the past is merely the 
leavings. 
As early as 1954, Unesco prepared 
a treaty on the preservation of monu- 
ments during armed conflicts which 
has been signed by less than half of 
its member states. Not a very good 
showing—but some countries were 
afraid that their enemies would use 
sites protected by the treaty as 
bunkers to operate from, and at which 
nobody could shoot back. The argu- 
ment is as old as the history of war- 
fare: if something is a strategic target, 
no matter what it is or how valuable it 
might be in itself, it must be destroyed. 
Often, the best that anyone can do 
is to shore up a site against advancing 
disaster, take pictures to record what 
it looks like in case the sand-bagging 
and other preparations don’t work and, 
if you have time, move the most 
valuable parts of it somewhere else 
for safe-keeping. 
These are some of the precautions 
that Unesco experts have taken with 
the ruins of Angkor Wat, in Cambodia. 
They are part of the remains of an 
extremely rich civilization which flour- 
ished in the twelfth century and then 
was mysteriously deserted in the 
fifteenth. The jungle took them over 
and only in this century have archaeo- 
logists discovered how vast the ruined 
city must have been. By good for- 
tune its fantastic carvings and eerie 
pillared corridors of stone have been 
preserved almost intact, and the story 
of its unknown period lies waiting to 
be explored both by tourists and the 
experts who can piece together the 
clues that Angkor holds. 
It is now perilously close to the 
Viet-Nam conflict... close enough to 
be considered in it. The Secretary- 
General of the United Nations and 
the Director-General of Unesco have 
made a public appeal to save it, 
but, short of having it and miles 
around it put off limits, the most that 
can be expected is that, after the 
fighting, it will somehow have been 
protected enough to survive. Other- 
wise, man will be left with only a 
series of photos to remind him of its 
beauties and fascinations. 
Sometimes, it is man's practical 
concerns rather than his ferocities that 
menace great works of art; it may 
seem a pity, but there is no other way 
of going about some building projects 
than by destroying everything in your 
wake. 
When a new, higher Aswan Dam 
was being planned to back up the 
Nile and provide badly-needed hydro- 
electric power, it was clear that the 
great Egyptian temples at Abu Simbel 
were going to be flooded in the 
process; but they were carved into the 
stone face of a cliff, and there seemed 
nothing that could be done to save 
them. 
Then, in a dramatic move, it was 
suggested that if enough countries 
would co-operate with Unesco and help 
to underwrite the enormous cost, the 
temples could be literally sawn out 
of the rock in huge chunks and moved 
piece by piece to higher ground. 
About fifty countries volunteered to 
give support through Unesco and the 
process was begun as the dam was 
being built. 
From the beginning, it was a race 
against the rising waters; but now 
after five years of the actual work and 
millions of dollars later, the temples 
are well above the newly-created lake, 
and are more durable than ever. In the 
moving, preservatives were added to 
the stone itself and they were given 
added strength by the most advanced 
modern techniques of engineering. 
BU Simbel received a 
great deal of publicity as the glam- 
orous centre of attraction in what 
was in reality a much larger project; 
the full rescue operation took in the 
whole area of Nubia where the mon- 
uments were going to be submerged. 
It took five years for 70 expe- 
ditions from various countries to 
catalogue and photograph all the 
monuments, inscriptions and rock 
carvings that were going to be 
lost from sight beneath the waters; 
then, all the free-standing temples 
were cut up and removed; frescoes of 
the Christian period were safely stored 
and whatever was most precious was 
saved wherever possible. 
Throughout, experts kept a wary eye 
on the island of Philae which was 
located between the old and new 
dams. Since the Nile had first been 
dammed up at the beginning of this 
century the temple to the goddess 
isis, its colonnade and a Roman temple 
called Trajan's “Kiosk” on the island 
had spent a large part of the year 
underwater and had survived. 
That is, they survived with the 
exception of the many - coloured 
Egyptian frescoes in the temple 
which were still intact in the nine- 
teenth century, after 2,000 years, 
but were destroyed by the flood

The preservation of the world’s cultural heritage has been one of the major tasks Unesco 
set itself in the field of culture. The world campaign to save Abu Simbel and other monu- 
ments of Nubia, launched in 1960, has now been brought to a successful conclusion except 
for the rescue of the temples on the island of Philae (see page 63), but Unesco’s action has 
ranged all over the globe. The International Council of Museums which Unesco helped to 
found in 1946, has become the recognized organization for museum authorities and techni- 
cians throughout the world. In 1954, Unesco drew up an international treaty to protect 
works of art and historical buildings during armed conflicts. In 1959, it set up an international 
centre in Rome for the study of the preservation and restoration of monuments and 
works of art. Here a wooden statue is given an injection against a malady that would have 
reduced it to powder. 
waters. With the decision to use the 
basin between the dams as a reservoir 
for generating electricity, the island is 
permanently underwater; the lake level 
now changes up to nineteen feet daily 
and the sandstone is being quickly 
scrubbed away. 
To save this “pearl of Egypt” a dam 
has to be built around the temples and, 
using techniques similar to the ones 
needed for Abu Simbel, they will be 
carried away in about 20,000 pieces 
and reassembled on the firm, pinkish 
granite of Agilkia, a deserted island 
downstream. 
What is frustrating about this project 
is that, seventy years ago, when the 
first dam was built, there was a 
movement of historians to try to save 
the temples but the government simply 
couldn't afford the project. Had there 
been an organization at that time such 
as Unesco perhaps it could have mus- 
tered the necessary international sup- 
port and not only would we still have 
the murals, now lost, but the whole 
rescue could have been done for a 
small fraction of what it is costing 
today. 
There are many treasures, like those 
of Nubia, that are on the brink of 
being destroyed and whose time for 
rescue must come soon or never. 
Fortunately, there is a new impetus 
for present-day governments to keep 
them from crumbling. If they will put 
out the necessary capital for the work, 
they aren't just wasting their money on 
“art”, they are investing in the highly 
profitable venture of “cultural tour- 
ism”, attracting visitors, foreign 
currency and a multi-billion dollar 
industry of hotels and all the services 
of travel. Many of us can conceive of 
getting on a plane and in a matter of 
a few hours, actually visiting the tem- 
ples of Isis and Abu Simbel. At least 
it is a possibility. 
in that case, what about a visit to 
the temples of Borobudur near logja- 
karta, a moonlit stroll through the site 
of ancient Carthage or an exploration 
of the "Andean and “Maya” routes 
in Latin America? 
Borobudur is a massive Buddhist 
shrine built twelve hundred years 
ago in Java. It consists of four 
square terraces which you walk around 
to reach the summit; all along the way 
there are hundreds of bas-reliefs 
denoting various levels of spiritual 
understanding. 
You walk past these on a long 
pilgrimage to the upper terrace, 
getting farther and farther away 
from concerns of the world so

Unesco has organized many hundreds of scientific missions to all parts of the world for the conser- 
vation and preservation of sites and monuments and the cultural treasures of its member nations. 
In 1954 it launched an international campaign to alert the public and governments to the need to 
safeguard monuments and works of art. In Africa, Asia and the Middle East, it has arranged special 
training courses for technicians: at Jos, Nigeria, for African museum specialists, at the Latin Ame- 
rican centre for the conservation of cultural property near Mexico City, and in Baghdad, for spe- 
cialists from Arab member countries. Unesco has mobilized international aid for the restoration 
of such famous monuments as Borobudur, in central Java (opposite, above, a statue of Buddha 
on a terrace at Borobudur) and the ruins of Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan. in 1966 it launched an 
appeal for international aid to save Venice, and is now helping to draw up and carry out a plan 
for the preservation and restoration of the city. Above, angels surmounting the pediment of the 
Santa Maria della Salute church in Venice. Opposite left, a “square of three cultures” (Aztec 
remains, a 16th century church and modern apartment blocks) in Mexico City.

In 1953, Unesco sent conservation missions to Syria and the Lebanon which outlined plans 
for the preservation of important monuments, including the ruins of Palmyra, crusaders’ 
castles, including the famous Krak des Chevaliers (above), and the ruins of Baalbek. A 
major aspect of their studies was the problem faced by historical monuments in a modern 
city, in the case of the Lebanon, the old quarters of Tyre, Sidon and Tripoli. Unesco’s many 
conservation missions to Asia have included several to Nepal to plan the preservation of 
monuments in Katmandu and other cities. Brightly painted carvings (right) depict the 
Hindu god Siva and his wife, Parvati, at a temple in Katmandu.

which looks out in every direction over 
breathtaking mountain ranges. 
Here in the centre, there are many 
stupas or onion-shaped domes through 
whose openings you catch glimpses of 
hundreds of seated Buddhas; the tall- 
est one in the centre contains a sealed 
globe which is the representation of 
the highest spiritual truth of which man 
is capable, the imponderable Nirvana. 
This spectacular edifice was built 
entirely without mortar over a huge 
mound of earth. Over the centuries, 
water has seeped through the cracks 
and eroded the foundations beneath. 
As a result, the whole structure now 
leans crazily every which way and if 
the walls supporting the lowest terrace 
crumble, it will all crash down in a 
massive landslide of statuary and wall 
carvings. 
The Indonesian government has res- 
cued as many of the statues as pos- 
sible, but with Unesco support it will 
be able to save the temple itself. This 
operation will involve dismantling it all, 
stone by stone, placing it firmly on 
carefully concealed reinforced con- 
crete foundations and putting in chan- 
nels for the rain-water to escape. 
In the process, the carvings will be 
cleaned of the lichen and mineral de- 
posits that are eating at them, and will 
be covered with preservatives against 
any further ravages of weather and 
time. 
The threat to the site of ancient Car- 
thage is of another kind. It is threat- 
ened by the growth of the modern city 
that surrounds it, and unless it is ex- 
plored and part of it restored with the 
advice of experts from Unesco it will 
no doubt be swallowed up by a sea of 
asphalt and concrete. The kind of 
project Unesco is undertaking with the 
governments of Latin America is 
essentially one of reclaiming their 
Incan and Mayan heritage from the 
jungle and making them available 
as a resource for tourism. 
The list of exotic names of places 
throughout the world to which Unesco 
is sending missions is very long in- 
deed, but its involvement doesn’t stop 
by any means with what to a western 
ear sounds rare and esoteric. In 1966, 
when floods washed through the cities 
of northern Italy, many of the famous 
works of art that we think of as being 
safe and well-preserved were damag- 
ed and, in some cases, totally des- 
troyed. 
Florence was particularly hard hit, 
and Unesco launched an interna- 
tional campaign of emergency help. 
Money poured in from individuals and 
governments the world over who 
recognized the enormity of the loss. 
The work of restoration, cleaning, 
rebuilding and putting the city back 
together took several years and is just 
now being completed. 
From it, Unesco experts have learn- 
ed a lot about not only restoring and 
preserving works of art, but about the 
way museums and libraries should be 
set up so that such a large scale disas- 
ter won't occur again; then it has 
applied these new techniques to the 
museums and libraries it is helping to 
establish in its member states through- 
out the world. 
Precious documents were destroyed 
in the archives of Florence which 
could have been saved if the vaults 
they were in had been waterproof;

even if they had been catalogued and 
microfilmed, at least their contents 
wouldn't have been lost. With modern 
preservative techniques, frescoes 
buried in mud needn’t have been totally 
ruined. Of course it is easy to say 
these things after the fact, but Flor- 
ence has become a giant pilot project 
for Unesco which will supply the infor- 
mation needed to prevent the same 
losses elswhere. 
Another victim of the 1966 floods 
was Venice, the jewel of the Adriatic, 
but, it being a city built on a lagoon, 
changes in water level there are not 
such a catastrophe. However, its cul- 
tural difficulties are more serious and 
far-reaching than any others that 
Unesco has worked with. There, not 
only the cultural heritage of the city 
must be preserved, but the life of the 
city itself is at stake. 
The salt waters are taking a heavy 
toll of the magnificent palaces lining 
the canals. The foundations are being 
rotted away, and whole sections of 
brick and plaster are collapsing into 
the waters, often threatening to sink 
passing gondolas as they do so.

The city is being more and more ex- 
posed to the buffeting of the waves, so 
people are simply not bothering to 
repair the damage as it occurs. Many 
of the buildings are being deserted and 
residents are moving to the mainland 
in droves. In effect, the city is being 
left like a faded prima donna to memo- 
ries and decay. 
The task of saving Venice is more 
than cultural, keeping its works of art 
intact, protecting it from the sea, res- 
toring the damage already done; 
although the entire city is an artistic 
shrine, it must be considered socially, 
economically and geographically as 
well. 
In this case, a large part of the mo- 
mentum for saving the city must be 
generated from within. The glories that 
were created by a wealthy sea-trading 
empire have to be preserved by mak- 
ing the modern Venice economically 
sound. Improved transportation, per- 
haps an undersea subway line connect- 
ing with the mainland, might open it 
up as a more practical place to live. 
And of course, tourism has to be 
developed in such a way that people 
Photo © Photo Researchers Inc., New York 
will not just come over for the day to 
look at St. Mark's, breathe in the at- 
mosphere, and return to the mainland 
at night. Once they are in Venice they 
must be attracted enough to stay over 
and spend their money there. 
This project is a kind of culmination 
of all that Unesco has been practising 
and preaching through the years. All 
these ornate, impractical palaces, the 
expensive preoccupation with lavish 
decor, the fascination with paintings 
and sculptures worth kings’ ransoms ... 
all this “crazy” spending of money in 
the past is the only reason that the 
city is not being abandoned ‘to the 
sweep of the sea today. 
What Unesco has been dinning into 
the ears of modern governments really 
has the ring of truth; aside from ail 
the practical greatness of any society 
now flourishing, probably the only 
thing that will convince future genera- 
tions to save its remains will be the 
impractical, illogical, foolish outpour- 
ings of its artists and artisans. If any 
of us are to be remembered, it is our 
cultural life above all that must flourish 
and be preserved. |

NE of the gruesome, but 
otherwise untested facts to come out 
of brainwashing in prison camps is 
that without any chance to commu- 
nicate the mind collapses in rubble 
and despair. In psychological experi- 
ments, people whose hands, eyes and 
ears are bound and who cannot move 
are soon disoriented and desperate 
for any kind of stimulation... a change 
of temperature or even an itch. 
The mind simply cannot stand to be 
in isolation; it needs its place in the 
real world of sights, sounds, feelings 
and discomforts. In fact it is inconceiv- 
able to think of society today without 
communications and, in a similar vein, 
to think of communications without 
realizing their potential impact on 
society. 
Since education; science and culture 
are all different ways of getting what 
is going on inside one man's mind 
into the minds of others, in the course 
of its work, Unesco found itself deeply 
concerned with the concept of commu- 
nication itself. A teacher has to sell 
‘ideas to his students, to make them 
live, or he is wasting his time; there 
are simply too many different stimuli 
competing for their attention for him to 
risk boring them. We have all learned 
to tune out the colourful advertizing, 
the noise and the high-pressure sales- 
manship that bombards us every day; 
the trouble is that in the process, we 
might miss thoughts and experiences 
of real value. 
In highly mechanized societies, old- 
fashioned means of communication, 
such as books are taken for granted 
and a lot of people just won't take the 
time to sit down and read one when 
they can do dozens of “more exciting” 
things. Automated presses keep turn- 
ing them out by the millions and some 
people do keep reading, but the idea 
that a book might be an adventure 
and that it takes real effort to produce 
is almost entirely gone. 
  
Sharing 
the min 
In the developing countries, how- 
ever, there must be newspapers, a 
book-publishing industry and a public 
library system to make reading 
materials available to everybody or 
national literacy is impossible. So 
Unesco has sought to strengthen 
national publishing ventures through 
aid in the form of equipment and 
advisers to train the journalists, 
printers and librarians who can put 
the printed word in motion. 
Yet can the development of mass 
media of communication stop even 
there? Just because a developing 
country isn't wealthy, can it afford not 
to have radio and television facilities? 
This is the last third of the. twentieth 
century, the century of revolution in 
communication, but perhaps all the 
advances are only for the rich. A lot 
of the time, so-called “developed” 
countries use television, in particular, 
as if it were a toy to be fooled with, 
a luxury that the poor of the world 
couldn’t possibly need. Unesco, how- 
ever, sees it as an absolutely crucial 
tool, which every developing country 
is going to need if it hopes to catch up. 
The educational possibilities for TV 
are just now being explored with 
“Sesame Street” for pre-schoolers in 
the United States, Unesco’s own 
project in the Ivory Coast for primary 
schools and Britain's “Open Univer- 
sity.” The real vaiue of the medium, 
together with radio and films, is finally 
coming through. 
But it is coming through very, very 
fast, and as a support for one of the 
biggest challenges of the next 
decades—mass media for lifelong 
education. Either developing countries 
have modern communications and the 
trained film-makers and radio and 
television technicians to operate them 
in the near future or they will be so 
far behind that they will never recover. 
Unesco sees clearly the two sides 
to the great boom in modern commu- 
9 - COMMUNICATION 
nications. On one hand, it can open 
undreamt-of possibilities for mutual 
understanding, or it can be a Pandora’s 
Box of tricks for setting up bad feel- 
ings between countries. 
For example, when an author writes 
a book or a script he copyrights it for 
his own country and for a few other” 
countries who have worked out mutual 
agreements, so that every time it is 
printed or performed, he gets some 
payment for the hours of work, the 
training and the investment of himself 
and his talent that he has put into it; 
in effect, his ideas are his own and 
he gets credit for them. 
However, outside of the countries 
that have agreements with his, his 
work is fair game. It can be repro- 
duced, changed unmercifully, and 
exploited as if he had never written it, 
and there is nothing he can do to 
protect himself, 
NESCO has drafted an 
international copyright agreement 
which could cut through all the endless 
political complications that now exist 
and put an end to all the mistrust and 
skulduggery that is involved in selling 
books from one country to another. 
This “Universal Copyright Conven- 
tion,” which covers not only literary 
material, but scientific and artistic 
works as well, so far has only sixty 
signatures, (not very impressive for an 
organization of 125 states), but at least 
among those who have signed, inter- 
national feelings are considerably 
smoother and maybe in the course of 
time other nations will see the wisdom 
of dealing fairly as well. 
But copyright is not the only 
obstacle to making books available 
in the developing world. There is also 
the problem of converting currencies

These Indian schoolboys are studying in the shade of one of 
the massive masonry astronomical instruments at the Jantar 
Mantar Observatory, New Delhi, built by the astronomer- 
king Maharajah Jai Singh 11in1710. They may soon be learning 
with the help of a Unesco-aided educational satellite broad- 
casting system which India is planning to introduce on an 
experimental basis in 1972. Unesco has a direct stake in the 
use of space communications for education, science and 
culture, and has promoted studies into the possibilities of 
education via satellite relays. It has sent missions to the 
Ivory Coast, Brazil and India to help plan such communica- 
tions systems. For Unesco, communication by every possible 
means is the key to the achievement of its aims and ideas,

and from the outset it has sought to promote the free flow 
of information and ideas. An agreement on the importation 
of educational, scientific and cultural materials, adopted by 
Unesco’s General Conference in 1950, has been instrumental 
in reducing tariff and trade obstacles to the free flow of 
information. Unesco sponsored the Universal Copyright 
Convention, adopted in 1952, which helped to fill gaps in 
existing copyright agreements. A recent conference at 
Unesco’s H.Q., studied how the copyright protection offered 
by the Universal Convention could be extended to cover 
the rights of reproduction, public performance and broad- 
casting, in ways which would be of special benefit to the 
developing countries.

SHARING THE MIND (Continued) 
to enable “soft currency” countries 
to purchase not only books, but also 
films, school supplies or scientific 
equipment from “hard currency” areas. 
To get round this huge frustration, 
Unesco has invented a system of 
“international money orders,” known 
as Unesco Coupons, which univer- 
sities, schools, research institutions 
and individuals in developing countries 
can buy in their own currencies and 
send to a publisher or supplier to pay 
for the books or equipment they need. 
To keep the flow of books, works 
of art and scientific equipment going 
throughout the world, Unesco has 
written up agreements so that they 
can all get through customs duty 
free; but the idea that you have to 
move something across a border in 
order to share it is quickly disappear- 
ing now that satellite communications 
can put you somewhere thousands of 
miles away in a fraction of a second. 
At the moment, when a television 
programme, a tape-recording or a 
record are concerned, you can be sure 
of the range of the transmitter, and 
you can come to a fairly satisfactory 
decision about the right to play it, but 
in the near future a song sung once 
or a drama acted once will potentially 
have the whole world as a simul- 
taneous audience, through satellite 
transmission. < 
By the early 1970s, there will be 
communal receivers working through- 
out the world that will relay program- 
mes into your home, and that will 
leave some control as to what you 
see, but by the early 1980s, indivi- 
dual television sets will pick up 
programmes direct from the satellites 
themselves. 
Just how much right do particular 
governments have to say that they 
don't want their citizens seeing partic- 
ular programmes or hearing criticisms 
of their work from the other side of 
the world? The whole system could 
disintegrate to the level of a gigantic 
and expensive propaganda mill, or it 
could be a thrilling, mind-expanding 
step toward putting the world back 
together again. Unesco is faced with 
negotiating an agreement that will 
maintain the right to privacy for 
specific cultures and ideologies and 
at the same time preserve the right of 
all individuals to be fairly, impartially 
informed. 
It is a good thing that the satellites 
won't be in commercial operation for 
several years because a project so 
loaded with political dynamite and 
demanding such a complete change 
of thinking on the part of everyone in 
the world is going to take every minute 
of negotiation that Unesco can 
possibly afford to give it. un 
The introduction of new educational techniques in the Ivory 
Coast, the mobilization of world opinion to save the monu- 
ments of Venice or Borobodur, the opening of an institute of 
technology in Bombay — these are visible, concrete achieve- 
ments of Unesco in recent years. But perhaps less evident 
is the profound revolution in attitudes towards Education, 
towards Science and towards Culture that Unesco has helped 
to spark in its member states. It is this new awareness of the 
right to education for all, in the broadest sense of the term, 
and its overriding place in economic and social development 
that is one of the outstanding achievements of Unesco’s 
work over the past twenty-five years. Photo, above, in asense 
symbolizes the Unesco ideal—the child symbolizing a better 
world of tomorrow through better education and modern 
science without rejecting the great cultural values of the 
past (symbolized by the statues) which enrich life and give 
it a quality worth preserving.

HELTERED between two 
wings of the Unesco Secretariat is a 
small Japanese garden. Water flows 
from a monolithic rock, glistening over 
an ancient Japanese character for 
“peace” cut deeply into it. Around step- 
ping stones, it falls over a series of 
waterfalls, each with a different sound, 
NOW a miniature cataract growling, 
now a gentle trickle. It finds peace in 
a shallow pond, where copper-coloured 
carp hide under overhanging bran- 
ches, under a bridge, or beneath a 
floating island of dark red lily pads. 
Here, the seasons change from the 
glories of pink and white spring blos- 
soms, to summer irises among the 
reeds, to the stark outlines of new- 
fallen snow on black branches. Only 
the miniature mountains of rock seem 
unchanging and untouched. 
Here in the silence and tranquillity 
is the perfect setting for reflection.

and you can begin to put it all into 
perspective. 
Just as this place apart refreshes 
anyone who is willing to give it a few 
minutes of his time, so in Unesco 
itself, there is a place apart, a place 
for theorizing, for self-evaluation, and, 
most of all, for contemplating the 
world as it should be. 
This is among the group of Unesco 
philosophers whose job is to range the 
spectrum of its activities and say

THE MIND REFLECTS (Continued) 
“There an agreement must be reach- 
ed among our member nations.” Here 
many of the ideas and concepts are 
born which become an active part of 
Unesco's work. 
But often some of the most impor- 
tant things that Unesco can contribute 
to the world are the thoughts them- 
selves. At the beginning of its life, the 
United Nations drafted a Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights which 
talks about the right of any individual 
to develop and fulfil himself, to ex- 
press himself and to live with dignity 
and pride of bearing. 
FFICIALLY, its member 
states accepted all this optimistic 
sentiment, but in reality in the last 
twenty years since the declaration 
was signed, its concepts have been 
ignored, flaunted, violated and abused 
in more ways than those who wrote 
it could ever have believed. It makes 
very painful reading indeed, in the 
light of the oppression, the racial and 
social discrimination, and the degrad- 
ation of the human spirit that go on 
every day. 
It was signed as a gentleman's 
agreement between nations, based on 
national honour to be carried out—in 
many cases not the most unshakeable 
foundation when power politics and 
social expediency are concerried. So, 
in effect, the signatures are all that 
the U.N. has. 
The thoughts remain as sound as 
when they were put down (at least, 
where most of the world is concerned), 
but the U.N. and its agencies have no 
authority whatsoever to question, let 
alone interfere in, the way that coun- 
tries treat individuals or groups within 
their own boundaries. The thoughts 
of human rights have to speak totally 
for themselves... where they be can 
heard. 
Recently, Unesco has been look- 
ing at the Declaration again, in the 
light of modern social science, to see 
just how Universal it really is. How 
could it be expanded and re-thought to 
take in more of the world, without los- 
ing its central force? 
You would think that no one would 
have trouble accepting the concept of 
human rights, at least in principle, but 
in point of fact, political quibbles aside, 
there are some fundamental philoso- 
phical and emotional disagreements 
with the whole idea. 
If you are a Buddhist, for example, 
certain attitudes about the individual 
may be at variance with the single 
idea expressed in the Declaration; 
concern about self-worth and indivi- 
duality is a form of pride; the ideal 
is to submerge an individual life into 
the greater scheme of things with 
humility and without complaint. One 
life, even if it is.your own, or many 
lives, don’t merit so much fuss. 
In some Asian philosophies, the 
concept that all persons are equal is 
in itself strange, for according to such 
thinking there is a hierarchy among 
men, and you must accept whatever 
those above you in rank (a ruler, a 
father or an employer) might suggest 
without question. 
Where things get really complicated 
is deciding what is universally a right 
for women. Legally, in some countries, 
the idea of woman as an inferior 
and a chattel is a old as the civiliza- 
tion itself, and the whole structure of 
life has been based on that premise ; 
the women themselves would perhaps 
be more shocked than the men by any 
attempt to upset the traditional state 
of affairs. 
Still, even within the framework of 
social male supremacy, every woman 
has private, personal dominion over 
what goes on in her mind and Unesco 
stays firmly with the opinion stated in 
the Declaration that every man, woman 
and child has an equal right to be edu- 
cated regardless of whatever other 
inequalities might be imposed on him ; 
the right to have a trained mind is 
absolutely basic and upon that all 
other concepts of human rights can be 
built. 
In one area of human rights Unesco 
has been able to take a very forceful 
stand, and that is in the realm of 
racial prejudice. Racists have always 
supported their arguments with bio- 
logical, sociological and historical 
pseudo-evidence. Unesco was in a 
position to call on world-famous 
anthropologists, biologists and geneti- 
cists to find out what is true in the 
racist's case and what is a distortion 
of the facts. 
To their opinions were added those 
of ethnographers, sociologists, his- 
torians and lawyers and the whole 
published in a Statement on Race 
and Racial Prejudice, condemning 
it as a threat to international peace 
and a crime against humanity. One 
country famous for its policy of Apart- 
heid withdrew from Unesco but the 
other members remained resolute and, 
in principle, supported the scientists’ 
findings. 
“In principle” is a useful little diplo- 
matic phrase that leaves the way open 
for unlimited hedging. In principle, all 
the member states of Unesco are com- 
mitted to peace as well, but since the 
Second World War there have been 
100 armed conflicts which Unesco 
took pains to list in the November 
1970, issue of the "Unesco Courier”. 
Translated into a dozen languages, 
the brutal facts were there for the 
world to see, but the arms build-up 
continues and countries continue to 
spend over 200,000 million dollars a 
year {as much as the yearly income 
of the poorer half of the world's popu- 
lation put together} on ever more so- 
phisticated murder-weapons. 
In principle, all that money could 
be spent for education, development 
and all the positive causes that man 
could dream of, but in reality, it is 
squandered on man's meaningless 
war games, on threatening his fellows 
and paranoiacally protecting himself. 
The thoughts of peace that Unesco 
is aiming for seem far, far away, 
bogged down in the old patterns of 
narrowness of mind, selfishness and 
hate. If you are Unesco or any part 
of the United Nations system, by now 
you have learned not to expect 
miracles and you have learned how to 
persevere, 
But this is in no way to be mistaken 
for pessimism or giving up. The suc- 
cesses that Unesco has had, in what 
it has attempted, speak for themselves, 
but they are the first thing you forget 
when progress is slow and new hosts 
of problems and difficulties come up. 
Within the Secretariat and out in the 
field, there are people with the rare 
and wonderful ability to work intensely 
on a project and, through all the 
details, the human mistakes, the paper 
work and the unexpected setbacks, to 
keep in view at all times the ultimate 
goals for which they and the organi- 
zation are aiming. This kind of men- 
tality, to work quietly without drawing 
attention to yourself and without illu- 
sions as to how much you can really 
accomplish, is the backbone of 
Unesco and of its staff. Not very 
glamorous perhaps, but the best that 
any experienced citizen of the world 
can do. 
DUCATION. Science. 
Culture. Thoughts of peace. A huge 
experiment with the minds of men. 
People of former centuries would have 
scoffed at the idea of Unesco as 
foolhardy and unreal... some still do. 
Its progress is measured in the mo- 
mentary flash of light and understand- 
ing across a man's face as he reads 
a page, a catch in the breath as a 
young woman rounds a corner and 
catches sight of a temple bathed in 
sun, a smile after hours of poring over 
a page when the equation works and 
the whole solution spreads itself out 
simple and clear... those moments of 
clarity and relief when things finally 
come right. You can’t count smiles, 
thoughts and breakthroughs, but to 
see even one is to know that more are 
happening and more will happen. 
Unesco’'s work is just starting; 
twenty-five years isn't long in the 
human scheme. Will we all one day 
be educated? Will our planet one day 
be a beautiful, fresh place for us all? 
Will we all be open to the beauties 
and glories of the human imagination ? 
That all sounds a bit too close to Eden, 
highly impossible in the light of what 
we know of man, but like schemes for 
going to the moon, curing diseases, 
and finding someone to love, it is a 
beautiful, beautiful thought. [|

education at all levels must be permeat- 
ed with the seed of internationalism. 
For while education in itself is a sine 
qua non, it must also bear the hallmark 
of internationalism, spread the basic 
idea of the necessity of internationalism. 
There is but one world for all of us. 
To make us all really understand what 
that entails is the task of education. 
And it is here that all the activities 
of Unesco must converge to become 
action.

YESTERDAY'S ABSURDITY 
—TODAY'S REALITY 
The achievement of political inde- 
pendence by former colonies has not 
solved the problems of their economic, 
intellectual, scientific and technical 
independence. The scientific and tech- 
nical potential of a country depends on 
the number of trained scientists it 
possesses and the overall quality of its 
scientific infrastructures and institutions 
which enable it to define and resolve 
problems of theoretical and applied 
science. Twenty-five or thirty years 
ago, the idea of a science policy and 
the planning of science seemed absurd 
to many politicians as well as to scien- 
tists themselves. Today, many young, 
newly independent states .are trying to 
create a network of scientific institutes, 
to set up organizations responsible for 
the overall control of scientific matters 
and to allocate a regular share of their 
budgets to the training of scientists and 
to research. 
VICTOR A. KOVDA 
former Director of the Unesco 
Department of Natural Sciences 
ENCROACHMENTS ON PRIVATE LIFE 
Today, as never before, a code for 
science and technology needs to be 
drawn up, defining their ultimate ethical 
aims and laying down the principles 
governing their use exclusively in the 
service of man, with the aim of promot- 
ing, materially and spiritually, the har- 
monious development of mankind. 
International law should protect the 
individual against the effects of new 
techniques or certain forms of advertis- 
ing and propaganda which, if misused, 
may encroach upon his private life or 
threaten his intellectual and moral inde- 
pendence. It should also protect him 
against the increasingly serious threat 
of total pollution of his environment 
resulting from mass industrialization. 
HANNA SABA 
former Assistant Director-General of 
Unesco for International Standards 
and Legal Affairs 
IDEALS AND REALITIES 
All Unesco’s activities deriving from 
its three inseparable functions (intellec- 
tual, ethical and operational) are con- 
tributing to Africa's development. They 
are promoting a movement of moral 
and intellectual solidarity which is the 
wellspring of international co-operation 
for development. Thus African deve- 
lopment is benefitting equally from the 
“Unesco ideal”, the “Unesco reality”, 
the “Unesco thinking,” and the “Unesco 
action”. 
WILLIAM ETEKI-MBOUMOUA 
President of the Unesco 
General Conference (1968) 
CULTURE, THE INDIVISIBLE 
Culture today should aim for greater 
depth and scope. The age of the Ency- 
clopaedists, as we well know, is un- 
happily long past, and the future of 
science and culture lies with specialists 
who are increasingly cramped and 
confined within their own particular 
spheres of interest. For years past the 
disastrous effects of the divorce bet- 
ween the “two cultures”—scientific and 
literary—has been abundantly obvious. 
Culture, which has been shrinking from 
the cold, must once again venture into 
the world outside or it may disappear. 
Similarly, society, education and science 
must become permeated by culture or 
the results will be equally catastrophic. 
Culture is an indivisible whole and the 
cutting of those links that bound it not 
only with science, but also with nature 
is one of the great tragedies of today.

### 53885: Nubia: victory of international solidarity

  
HE international cam- 
paign to save the monuments and 
explore the archaeological sites of 
Nubia is one of the great achieve- 
ments of Unesco in its quarter of a 
century of existence. Eleven temples 
once threatened by the rising waters 
of the Aswan High Dam have been 
removed and re-erected on new sites, 
and four others dismantled and pres- 
ented to the U.S.A, Spain, The 
Netherlands and Italy in recompense 
for the help they gave in the rescue 
operation of the Abu Simbel temples. 
All that remains is to dismantle the 
temples of Philae and to reconstruct 
them on the island of Agilkia, beyond 
the reach of the Nile. 
 
The tourist in Nubia today who 
stands admiringly before the temples 
now resurrected in the cultural “oases” 
at Abu Simbel, Amada, Wadi Es Sebua 
and Kalabsha may little realize the 
gigantic efforts that went into this 
international achievement. 
Nubia lies between the Aswan Dam 
in Egypt and the Dal cataract in the 
Sudan—over 500 kilometres of rugg- 
ed country flanking the course of the 
Nile, remote from urban civilization, 
with an austere climate and acces- 
sible only by boat. 
As work started on the construction 
of the High Dam, a vast exodus from 
Nubian villages and hamlets began. 
Soon the entire area was denuded of 
The rescue of the Abu Sim- 
bel temples from the waters 
of the Nile was not only one 
of the greatest engineering 
feats of the modern era, it 
was also one of the finest 
examples of selfless, disin- 
terested, international co- 
operation of all time. Left, 
one artist's conception of 
the salvage operations be- 
fore they were actually un- 
dertaken. A temporary cof- 
ferdam, in foreground, holds 
back the rising waters as the 
Great Temple of Rameses is 
excavated and prepared for 
dismantling. The smaller 
Queen Nefertari Temple, 
right of photo, awaits the 
builders’ attentions. A spe- 
cially constructed road runs 
along the cofferdam and up 
to the new site where the 
two temples were finally to 
be installed in artificial 
hillocks, 200 feet above 
their original site. To exca- 
vate the temples from the 
hillside, 300,000 tons of rock 
had first to be removed. 
The temples were then cut 
up into blocks weighing up 
to 30 tons each and with a 
total weight for the two 
temples of 15,000 tons. Work 
began in 1964 with the con- 
struction of the cofferdam 
and the two temples were 
ceremonially inaugurated on 
their new site on September 
22, 1968.

life. Fruit and vegetable plantations 
withered and then the waters rising 
behind the dam wali slowly but inexo- 
rably swallowed up roads, palm trees, 
houses, telegraph and telephone lines. 
Finally there were no communi- 
cations, no crops, no food, no sec- 
urity or guard posts, in fact virtually 
nothing except the Nile waters and the 
desert sands. It was in this austere 
setting that an unprecedented cultural 
rescue operation began. 
During the Nubia monuments cam- 
paign, from 1960 until 1968, perhaps 
the most difficult years were those 
when the local population was evac- 
uated. When this emigration was

NUBIA (Continued) 
completed in 1963, Nubia looked so 
dead and empty that it seemed impos- 
sible that men had ever lived there. 
Nevertheless, the new “inhabitants” 
of Nubia—specialists, technicians and 
workers from Egypt, Sudan and many 
other countries—accepted the chal- 
lenge of scorching sun and arduous 
living conditions as they set about 
the operation launched in response 
to Unesco’s international appeal of 
March 8, 1960 
ODAY, as | recall the 
achievements of this compaign, | would 
like to pay tribute to the men and 
women who embarked on this historic 
endeavour: scientists, engineers, 
artists, technicians and workers from 
all parts of the world. 
Nubia was transformed during the 
excavation seasons into a unique in- 
ternational arena. During the long 
summer months when the Nile water- 
level dropped beyond the Aswan Dam 
as the sluices were opened to drain 
away the flood water, excavation 
teams searching for monuments and 
other remains were scattered through- 
out Nubia. 
Living on Nile boats and in white 
tents, they worked from dawn till 
forenoon, then resumed work from 
‘the afternoon till late in the evening. 
Throughout each season, lights glowed 
on both banks of the Nile as the scien- 
tists busied themselves with their 
studies and, when they could, org- 
anized social life and entertainments. 
In these camps one could hear 
English, French, Czech, Spanish, 
Polish, German and Russian spoken, 
as well as Arabic and many other 
languages. 
An international spirit prevailed 
everywhere in Nubia. This “Nubian 
spirit”, as it came to be known, over- 
came all differences and unified 
everyone within a framework of co-op- 
eration and friendship. The same 
spirit prevailed among those at work 
salvaging the temples. 
The archaeological teams were 
carrying out excavation work during 
several months each year, before re- 
turning home with their finds. During 
these months the teams removing the 
temples were also at work so that the 
whole area bustled with activity. 
It should be recalled that the 
operation of dismantling and re-siting 
the two temples at Abu Simbel went 
on without interruption for nearly five 
years (from 1963 to 1968) despite 
great material difficulties. For the 
teams engaged on this project the 
operation was a life and death race 
against the rising waters of the Nile. 
Yet the contract covering the joint 
venture at Abu Simbel, signed in 
November 1963, did not permit the 
erection of any installations prior to 
the start of the operation. We could 
not have risked spending millions of 
dollars on construction work until the 
attitude of the International Nubian 
Campaign towards this special project 
had become quite clear. 
Thus, we had to mobilize every 
avallable means, however simple. Two 
Nile boats were built and in these we 
carried all the archaeologists, engin- 
eers and technicians to their work 
sites. At first we also carried food sup- 
plies by boat. But refrigeration facil- 
ities were so inadequate that we had 
to send fresh vegetables, only to see 
them spoiled by the scorching heat. 
Finally we had to depend on canned 
vegetables and make up any dietary 
deficiencies with vitamins. 
Another major problem was the 
lack of pure water. This we over- 
came by installing equipment for the 
stringent filtration of water from the 
Nile. Bread, too, was in short supply, 
and at first we supplied Abu Simbel 
with bread by air until another bakery 
could be built. 
But gradually we completed the 
construction of the village of Ram- 
eses || at Abu Simbel, today the love- 
liest community in the area of the lake 
of the High Dam. It now comprises 
hotels and rest-houses; and it has elec- 
tricity and pure water, a swimming 
pool, tennis courts, a hospital, a mos- 
que, a telegraph and post-office a 
wireless station, paved roads and a 
police post. Beautiful gardens have 
been planted in which grow fruit trees 
and vegetables, and now that an air- 
port has been built, Abu Simbel has a 
direct air link with Aswan. 
Through the Nubian campaign, 
Unesco has been able to achieve more 
than one of its important goals. First- 
ly, in undertaking to save the ancient 
cultural heritage of Nubia, it has link- 
ed the past to the present. Secondly, 
it has linked the world with one idea, 
bringing nations and peoples closer 
and binding them together with this 
strong and unique tie. Finally, Unesco 
has proved that differences between 
nations could be eliminated if only the 
world as a whole were to co-operate 
in constructive work, instead of squan- 
dering its energies and resources on 
disputes and wars based only on nar- 
row self-interest. un

### 53885: Nubia: victory of international solidarity

  
Unesco has launched an international appeal to save the 
great temples on the island of Philae in Egypt. $1 million is 
needed by July 1, 1972, to start the rescue operation and 
$5 million by 1976. The monuments of Philae—its temples, 
colonnades and carvings—stand on an island submerged by 
the Nile for most of the year. They will be irreparably lost 
unless they are quickly dismantled and rebuilt on the nearby 
island of Agilkia. The action to save Philae will crown a 
remarkable achievement in cultural co-operation and will 
be the last phase of the international campaign launched by 
Unesco to save the monuments of Nubia from oblivion 
beneath the waters of the Aswan High Dam. The cost of 
“operation Philae”, from dismantling to reconstruction, will 
total $13,700,000, one-third of which will be provided by 
the UAR. By June 1971, in response to Unesco’s appeal, 
nearly $1,600,000 had been pledged by 17 countries—Belgium, 
Cambodia, Cuba, Cyprus, France, Fed. Rep. of Germany,

one-third of these contributions had been received. So that 
this international cultural rescue operation can be success-

final stage. Above, part of the great temple of the goddess

over 2,000 years old, are not likely to resist much longer 
their immersion for nearly nine months of the year in the 
waters of the Nile. There is no time to lose...

SOME FACTS 
AND FIGURES 
ABOUT UNESCO 
» In 1957, when Unesco launched its major project for primary 
education in Latin America, the continent had 216,000 primary 
schools. Ten years later there were 300,000 schools and the 
proportion of insufficiently qualified teachers had fallen from 53 to 
37 per cent. Some 1,500 teacher-training colleges were set up 
during this period. 
» More than 40,000 primary teachers were enrolled, between 1961 
and 1970, in teacher training colleges aided by Unesco and receiv- 
ing financial support from the United Nations Development Fund 
(UNDP). Over 16,000 engineers and technicians graduated from 
50 colleges and technical institutes receiving Unesco and UNDP 
aid. Between 1960 and 1970, no less than 167 development 
projects in education, science and culture, costing $658 millions, 
were launched by Unesco, UNDP and the governments of the 
countries concerned. 
» Unesco very nearly came into existence without an “8S” in its 
name. lt was first conceived as Uneco—the United Nations Educ- 
ational and Cultural Organization. The person who actively and 
successfully promoted the “S" was the distinguished U.S. poet 
Archibald MacLeish. The first Director-General, Julian Huxley, was 
a scientist 
.» Nearly 900 primary schools, secondary schools and teacher train- 
ing colleges in over 60 countries now participate in Unesco’s 
Associated Schools Project for education in international under- 
standing. It seeks to develop international co-operation and to 
promote knowledge of world affairs, of different cultures and ways 
of life, and of human rights. 
» During the first United Nations Development Decade, 1960-1970, 
the number of radio transmitters rose by 259%, in Latin America 
and doubled in Asia and Europe. The number of receivers 
increased even more. Newspaper circulation almost doubled in 
Asia, while the number of countries with television transmitters 
quadrupled in Africa, doubled in Asia and tripled in Latin America. 
» During the 1980s, kUnesco’s aid to Asian development amounted 
to around $80 million, The aid from all U.N. sources, including 
Unesco, to Asian Education, Science and Culture, amounted to 
$300 million. Assistance from all sources, governmental and non- 
governmental, public and private, multilateral and bilateral, amount- 
ed to $150 million per year towards the end of the 1960s. 
p- Between 1948 and 1968 over 20,000 people benefited from 
Unesco fellowships and travel awards: about 11,000 received 
fellowships and study grants (179%, went to women). Over 800 tra- 
vel grants were awarded to individuals (553 to youth leaders, 
150 to workers, 27 to worker education leaders, 99 to leaders of 
women’s organizations and 35 to teachers and students in adult 
education). An additional 923 awards went to groups of workers. 
About 11,000 persons benefited from these group awards. 
» Twenty per cent of Unesco fellowships and study grants were 
awarded to Africa, 99%, to Arab States, 27%, to Asia and Oceania, 
16% to Europe and Northern America and 28%, to Latin America 
and the Caribbean, in the fields of: education (43%), natural scien- 
ces, engineering and technology (3194), social sciences, human 
sciences and culture {14%,) and communication (12%). 
» A major survey of the cultures of Latin America is now almost 
complete afier five years of research and international studies. 
This Unescd survey, to be published this year, covers literature, 
art, theatre, architecture, music and town-planning and their inter- 
action on today’s rapidly changing society. 
» The Centre for Higher Studies in Journalism at the University 
of Quito, Ecuador, set up with Unesco aid in 1959, now plays a 
major role in the training of journalists and other mass media 
specialists in Latin America. 
» Unesco has compiled a catalogue of over 22,0600 works of art 
and has made an inventory of about 600 palaces and churches 
to be preserved and restored as part of the campaign for safe- 
guarding Venice. 
»- Unesco has been carrying out a monumental survey of educ- 
ation throughout the world. To date, four volumes with an average 
of 1,500 pages each have been published covering primary, 
secondary and higher education in Unesco’s member states. 
» More than three out of every five of the 1,072 million people 
in 18 Unesco Member States in Asia are under 25 years of age. 
An estimated 164 million ware enrolled in 1967 in schools at all 
levels, compared with 111 million in 1960, and school enrolment 
¥ 
is increasing at the rate of nearly seven million a year. 
» Since 1965, Unesco has given 24 countries technical aid in 
school construction. These schools provide places for about 
100,000 students in primary schools, secondary schools, higher 
education institutes and primary teacher-training colleges. 
p> A Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences was established 
in Santiago, Chile, in 1958, with Unesco aid. The Faculty is now 
an important continental centre for research and the training of 
sociologists, and has expanded to cover the political sciences and 
public administration. 
» Unesco has contributed to the preservation of famous sites and 
monuments throughout the world. Among them are: the Parthenon, 
Greece; the sites and monuments of Cappadocia and the lzmir 
region, Turkey; the Ajanta caves, India; the historic sites of Perse- 
polis and Pasargardae, Iran; the ruins of Palmyra and the Krak 
des Chevaliers, Syria; the sites of Ctesiphon and Nineveh, Iraq; 
the ruins of Baalbek, Lebanon; the colossal statues of Easter 
Island, Chile; the Maya temple at Bonampak, Mexico; and the 
Abomey Royal Palaces, Dahomey. The first Unesco conservation 
mission sent to safeguard monuments in danger went to Peru, 
after the earthquake of 1950 which largely destroyed the historic 
city of Cuzco. 
» A regional Mass Communication Institute for English-speaking 
African countries has been set up with Unesco’s aid in Nairobi, 
Kenya. Its aim is to stimulate the growth of information media in 
Africa. For French-speaking countries Unesco has helped to create 
a Mass Communication Institute at Dakar, Senegal, for the train- 
ing and education of mass communication staff. In West Africa, 
too, an Information Institute has been set up at the University of 
Lagos, Nigeria, to train specialists in audio-visual techniques.

_ Letters to the Editor 
THE ‘ MAGIC’ 
OF MODERN CHEMISTRY 
 
Sir, 
As a reader for five years, | have 
generally enjoyed your articles, but 
| feel that the choice of those in the 
June 1971 issue on the “Magic of 
Modern Chemistry” was not up to your 
usual standard. 
Broadly speaking, we have to accept 
the increasing use of synthetic mater- 
jals. Combined with natural fibres they 
create extremely useful “alloys”. But 
used alone, synthetic fibres are not 
conducive to bodily comfort, or comfort 
of any kind. The stretch or spandex 
fibres you mention have met with little 
success and are now of minor industrial 
importance. 
This also applies to polyurethane 
foam. Plenty of worthwhile products 
are made from it, but we should avoid 
using such porous resin materials to 
excess. One need hardly recall the 
recent firé that ravaged a French dance 
hall, killing over 100 young people 
when synthetic foam furnishings flared 
up with terrifying speed and gave off 
cyanogen gas. 
As to the wider picture of the global 
population explosion, with 7,000 million 
inhabitants predicted for the year 2000, 
| fear the world will experience some 
catastrophic famines before that time. 
To calculate that the world (thanks to 
the so-called “green revolution”), can 
feed a population of 7,000 million strikes 
me as a cold and matter-of-fact ap- 
proach to the problem, bearing in mind 
that this figure is merely the take-off 
point for a rise to a population of 15,000 
million. 
We should remember that the miracles 
of this same “green revolution” cannot 
be wrought unless sufficient energy is 
produced (even to provide no more than 
water for irrigation), and neither atomic 
nor any other form of energy will be 
producing this amount of power by the 
time it is needed. 
N.E. Borlaug, Nobel prizewinner and 
“father” of the “green revolution”, is 
by no means convinced about the 
“magic” of chemistry, and has warned 
against the dangers of an exploding 
population, With equal honesty, scien- 
tists who created the petroleum-based 
synthetic proteins affirmed that their 
discovery, though useful, can have no 
radicai effect unless the population 
explosion is checked. And ocean farm- 
ing can provide only a useful (though 
perhaps vital) new food resource that 
will be needed long before the world 
has 7,000 mitlion inhabitants. 
Worshippers of modern chemistry 
would be well advised to display more 
wisdom and caution in regard to many 
modern problems. Among those | 
would list: the social consequences of 
developments in medical science (will 
longevity and good health become a 
privilege of the rich?); conservation 
and production of fresh, pure water 
(here water economy and energy costs 
will be determining factors); the 
recovery of arid lands (there are few 
parts of the world where marginal lands 
can be recovered—as has been done 
 
in Israel, for instance) and in trying 
to achieve such results in the savannah 
or tropical forest regions, we run the 
risk of creating deserts rather than new 
food resources; finally, the formidable 
problems created by DDT.

CHEMICAL ‘ FALL-OUT’ 
 
Sir, 
Having witnessed how the forest 
lining the Danish Lillebelt strait recently 
turned black like charcoal and all the 
leaves curled up—overnight—due to the 
occasional airing of the ammonia tanks 
of a passing ship, it is disquieting to 
see an industrial consultant open up 
your June issue using such a sentence 
as, “And yet, there are many who decry 
chemistry as the cause of undesirable 
qualities of modern life. This blind- 
folded technocrat evidently has less 
sense of ecology than any country 
housewife. 
With pollution increasing over 20 per 
cent per year since 1960, mainly due 
to the marvels of the high-energy- 
demanding and highly-poliuting petro- 
chemical and plastic resin industries, 
with all fish dying out in virtually 
hundreds of lakes is southern Norway 
due to acid rain, and the number of 
reindeer on Hardangervidda suddenly 
dropping from 14,000 to 5,000 (DDT and 
dieldrin etc. drifting with winds con- 
centrate unusually fast in reindeer moss 
and lichens), we have indeed realized 
that the marvels of nature mean more 
to human survival than the prestige of 
the chemical industry. 
Chemists have made our present 
precarious position possible. Unless 
they are now mobilized, under the 
strict supervision of ecologists, to save 
the biosphere they shall be more curs- 
ed than blessed.

PERILS OF SYNTHETIC SHOES 
 
Sir, 
In your June 1971 issue on the 
revolution wrought by modern chem- 
istry, on page 7 a photo shows sheets 
of shoes being produced from a mat- 
erial that “duplicates leather's 'breath- 
ability’, and has more than a million 
pores per square inch.” 
It makes my blood beil that “experts” 
should be so ignorant about hygiene 
of the feet. As a shoemaker | am in 
direct contact with my customers who 
are coming more and more to realize 
how unhealthy it is to wear such shoes, 
that cause excessive perspiration, ath- 
lete’s foot, bad circulation of the blood 
and fallen arches. 
| am not against synthetic products 
which have satisfied innumerable needs. 
But where the feet are concerned, | 
say No! Indeed | am surprised that the 
World Health Organization, ‘which is 
well aware of these dangers for the 
feet, has taken no action, particularly 
with regard to children who need 
healthy shoes while they are growing 
up. 
If these children are to be the future 
“pedestrians of the moon” they will 
still need their feet, so we should see 
to it that they are shod in leather, a 
noble material and healthy for the feet.

TALKING POINT 
 
Sir, 
The facts in your excellent magazine 
are used in my weekly sessions with 
colleagues and students and become 
often a starting point for lively 
discussions and deductions. Here are 
three recent deductions summarized: 
Your issue on “Man and Violence” 
(August-September 1970): 
Violence by men, caused through 
overcrowding or isolation can be 
instantly redressed by forming small 
social and study groups where indiv- 
idualized but mutual communication is 
possible. 
The article by Boris Nikitin “Latent 
Talent...” (February 1871): 
The experiments by the Swedish 
neurobiologist Holger Hiden which prove 
that “Neurons deprived of physical 
nourishment and stimulation cannot 
produce albumin...and finally cause 
atrophy of the brain” must be extended 
from childhood all the way to senior 
citizenhood, where senility could be 
prevented. Social activities are not suf- 
ficient. Challenging intellectual and 
emotional stimulation plus the right 
(not refined) food must be provided. 
Your issue on “The Public and Modern 
Art” (March 1971): 
The Toronto research revealed “what 
is commonplace on TV in the way of 
violence and other distortions of life, is 
not... equally acceptable... for painting 
(by the average public).” The reason 
could be that TV violence is often 
moving toward a redeeming finale, 
while the static, permanent depiction of 
violence in art becomes unbearable.

THE MODERNISED MUSEUM : 
STREAMLINED DINOSAUR’ ? 
Sir, 
As an “insider” in the Museum 
World, | found Duncan Cameron's arti- 
cle “Museums for Moderns” (your 
October 1970 issue) euphoric reading. 
Mr. Cameron's article deserves the 
highest praise for its very detailed pic- 
ture of present trends in the world of 
museums. Its sole defect was that 
since the author wrote of many facets 
of museology in the imperfect tense, 
he may have given the impression to 
the uninitiated that the facts he related 
belonged to the past. 
But is there really a country in the 
world where things are just as the 
writer describes them? | don't know 
of a single one, certainly not in Europe. 
A few spectacular achievements, well

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR (Continued) 
 
  
known to the public, because heralded 
with a fanfare of trumpets, tend to 
make us forget that a large number of 
museums {including some of interna- 
tional standing) continue to exist in 
conditions unworthy of our time. 
Through lack of funds and lack of 
personnel they are unable to fulfil the 
role the public has the right to expect 
of them. The art treasures they dis- 
play (though often they cannot do so, 
since some rooms are closed owing to 
lack of staff) hide the penury behind 
the facade. 
We can only hope that what Mr. Cam- 
eron describes in the present tense 
will become a reality in a not too 
distant future. 
George van Deuren 
Antwerp, Belgium 
Duncan Cameron replies : 
| must admit that when | speak of 
museum practices as they have been, 
of new trends and developments and 
perhaps even a “new look” in museum 
operations, | am being more than an 
optimist. It is certainly true in Canada 
and the United States that a great many 
museums, including some of the most 
important ones, continue to operate in 
the same mode as they have for at 
least the past 100 years. 
Further, | am aware from observation 
in North America that “modernization” 
of many museums means nothing more 
than the addition of a little streamlining, 
a few bits of chrome, the intrusion of 
some audio-visual “toys” and a high 
pressure public relations campaign~-the 
addition of these to the same tired old 
museum philosophy. 
Several commentators on our mus- 
eums and art galleries have asked the 
question in recent years “Are we really 
dinosaurs?” In general the reaction to 
this question has been to cry “Nol”, 
and produce (at great expense) stream- 
lined dinosaurs. 
It would not be fair of course to say 
that the need for the reform of the 
museum as an institution in society has 
gone unrecognized in North America. 
The streamlining as described above 
has been one reaction but another has 
been the tendency to employ, in senior 
museum posts, non-museum personnel. 
“It is becoming rather popular to appoint 
bright young corporation executives as 
museum directors and to bring in publi- 
city specialists as directors of museum 
education and extension. The assump- 
tion here is not just that the museum 
profession is incapable of reforming 
itself but further, that within the museum 
profession the necessary expertise and 
progressive thinking cannot be found. 
Neither streamlined dinosaurs nor eager 
amateurs are an answer. 
It was implicit in my article that | be- 
lieve a fundamental re-organization of 
museums is necessary; that the involve- 
ment of the museum's publics in 
decision-making must become a reality. 
But the abandonment of traditional 
museums’ functions, as in some of our 
newer science centres and exhibition 
centres, is to bring an end to process 
and to concentrate only on product. 
Quite clearly it is only a matter of time 
until the absence of process will create 
a shortage if not an absence of pro- 
duct. 
In contrast, some reactionary institu- 
tions have chosen to ignore the poten- 
tial for a new role for the museum in 
society and have limited their efforts 
solely to traditional museum functions 
and museum scholarship without regard 
for public service. How long the public 
will accept the redistribution of tax 
dollars to institutions following this 
course of action remains to be seen. 
We must find the balance between 
democratization and public service on 
the one hand, and the moral obligations 
of preservation and research for future 
generations on the other. 
Recalling my error in applying the 
imperfect tense, | can only suggest that 
we live in a most imperfect world 
wherein our museums and art galleries 
have far more to contribute than most 
of us have ever dreamed. 
TEACHING AIDS FOR THE DEAF 
Sir, 
After publishing a most interesting 
article about teaching aids for blind 
school-children in your May 1971 issue, 
| hope you will also find space to tell 
us something about the problems of 
teaching deaf school-children. 
During International Education Year, 
1970, the Municipality of Barcelona 
built one of the world's most modern 
schools equipped with all the latest 
pedagogical and electro-acoustic aids 
for the education of deaf children. 
| think that this achievement deserves 
a mention.

17TH CHILD IN THE FAMILY 
Sir, 
| read the "Unesco Courier” with 
great interest, and was surprised to 
find an obvious error in the February 
1971 issue, in the article by Boris 
Nikitin on latent talent in children, which 
lists a number of famous men who 
were 17th children in their families. 
| am sure that there is at least one 
error: Heine, for example (like Goethe), 
was a first-born child and was certainly 
not one of a family of 17 children, 
and | doubt very much whether the 
others mentioned were each the 
17th child in the family. 
Geneviéve Bianquis 
Dijon, France 
Our reader is correct. Due to the 
transposition of a full stop and a 
comma, the passage in question stated: 
“Out of 73 world-famous geniuses and 
talented persons, only four were first- 
born children. Milton, Leonardo da 
Vinci, Heine, Anton Rubinstein, Ben- 
jamin Franklin and Mendeleyev were 
each the 17th child in the family...” 
It should have read: "... only four were 
first-born children, Milton, Leonardo da 
Vinci, Heine, Anton Rubinstein. Ben- 
jamin Franklin and Mendeleyev were 
each the 17th child...” — Editor. 
DISARMING SMILE... 
 
Sir, 
As outbreaks of violence become a 
daily fact of life, the question arises: 
how can we tame and control man’s 
aggressiveness? Thus, the survey of 
scientific research on the problems of 
aggressivity presented in your August- 
September, 1970, issue gave this 
number particular significance. 
Clearly, man can be extremely 
aggressive, perhaps even "a very dan- 
gerous beast”. But it is also true that 
man is the only creature capable of 
laughter. Laughter can be of great 
service; it can neutralize aggressive 
impulses, and we should surely make 
the most of this fact. 
The noted Austrian zoologist Konrad 
Lorenz has described, in “On Aggres- 
sion”, how an aggressive attitude can 
be transformed into part of the ritual 
of social politeness. He points cut that, 
in its original form, the human laugh 
was a sign of appeasement and a form 
of greeting. “I believe”, writes Lorenz, 
“that ‘we should take humour more 
seriously; it can be a precious ally.” 
And therein lies a remedy that is 
within reach of us all, one that shouid 
have a place in every family medicine 
chest as an antidote to the fever of 
aggressiveness. 
Perhaps the “Unesco Courier” could 
one day devote an issue to the very 
serious subject of humour.

THE CHILD—ONLY 
 
AN UNFINISHED ADULT ? 
Sir, 
The article "Latent talent—the ana- 
gram that parents can solve”, by Boris 
Nikitin, in the February 1971 issue of 
the “Unesco Courier”, contained a 
number of interesting and generally 
undisputed findings of educational re- 
search. But there were other points 
| would like to query. 
“In almost all occupations”, says 
Mr. Nikitin, "mental and creative activ- 
ity has a tendency to grow, and to grow 
at an accelerated pace. Consequently, 
development of creative faculties and 
intellect is a paramount task in educ- 
ation.” 
But is the basic concern of education 
only to mould the child as early as 
possible to the needs of his future 
occupation? : 
Again the author says, “In our family 
experiment . . . we wanted to fill the 
child's world with all the things that 
make up our ‘adult’ world—real objects, 
tools, materials, instruments and books.” 
Why are adults so anxious to project 
their own world onto their children? 
Surely, children have their own inter- 
ests (e.g. purposeless games) which 
they should be allowed to enjoy. Why 
do we grown-ups want to force on our 
children our own world—the world of 
utility, the world of cold, technical 
rationalism of the engineer?
