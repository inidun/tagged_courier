Pause for peace 
T must be considered both absurd and intolerable that people in all countries should 
live in dread of global war, a war which, whether by design or accident, would 
inevitably involve a nuclear confrontation. 
It is not only that future possibility but its present manifestations that we contemplate 
with horror. The increasingly dangerous rhetoric and threats that are bandied about, the 
violence that already rages in many countries, the insane arguments that are heard in 
favour of increasing still further stockpiles of weapons that are already capable of 
destroying the world ten times over—these things are even now distorting our daily lives 
and playing havoc with the world economy and with the hopes of humanity. 
How can we and how can our children, make plans for a peaceful, productive life 
when we read that a poll of citizens in a certain town showed they would commit mass 
suicide rather than face such a war? How can we live normal, useful lives when the 
world’s leading scientists tell us we are only a few minutes away from doomsday? What 
kind of consolation is it to be told—without a word of pity for the survivors—that fifty 
per cent of the world’s population might survive the nuclear holocaust? 
Motivated by the growing conviction that the peoples of the world must themselves 
assume responsibility for peace, as the representative of Greece, I proposed to the 
General Conference of Unesco in Paris last October that, at the stroke of noon on the 
first day of spring, 22 March, everywhere in the world, North, South, East and West, 
all activity should cease for one minute: for that one minute all traffic should come to 
a standstill, workers in factories should lay down their tools, teachers and pupils in their 
classrooms and judges in their courtrooms should stand, sessions should be suspended 
in the parliaments of the world, and in barrack-rooms and on training-grounds soldiers 
should join in a worldwide affirmation that the resolute demand of all is for peace. 
I was extremely heartened by the adoption of this proposal in the form of a General 
Conference Resolution. I now appeal to Unesco and its Member States, using all the 
means at their disposal, to undertake at once a world campaign to publicize this resolu- 
tion and to enlist universal participation. I know that the time for doing so is short, but 
time is short in a much deeper sense.

Appeals to Member States to set aside on 22 March 1984, on the stroke of noon, one minute during 
which all men, women and children, irrespective of their occupations, will stop their activities in order 
to demonstrate, unanimously, their desire for peace, international understanding and universal co- 
operation. 
(Resolution adopted at the twenty-ninth plenary meeting, on 23 November 1983).

HIS issue of the Unesco Courier 
1] presents through a mosaic of 
texts and pictures some aspects 
of the life and culture of the Tamil peo- 
ple, the overwhelming majority of 
whom live in the State of Tamil Nadu in 
the extreme southeast of the Indian 
peninsula. 
This culture is remarkable on many . 
counts, not least because Tamil is the 
oldest of India’s modern languages—it 
has been cited as ‘perhaps the only ex- 
ample of an ancient classical tongue 
which has survived for more than 2,500 
years with its basic structure intact’’. In 
addition to Tamil Nadu, where it is the 
State language, Tamil is also spoken by 
an estimated four million people who 
live in Sri Lanka, Burma, Malaysia, In- 
donesia, the Socialist Republic of Viet 
Nam, parts of East and South Africa, 
Guyana, and islands in the Indian 
Ocean, the South Pacific and the 
Caribbean. 
The present issue, which consists 
largely of contributions from Tamil 
writers and scholars, looks at the pre- 
sent as well as the past of a developing   
society searching for a fruitful relation- 
ship between ancient traditions and 
modern life, between city and coun- 
tryside, between indigenous forms of 
creativity and outside influences. 
In a scene-setting article current 
trends in the social and cultural life of 
Tamil Nadu are charted by 8. 
Ramakrishnan. Other aspects of the 
contemporary situation are evoked in 
articles on modern movements in Tamil 
literature and on the changing status of 
women, and in a text in which poet and 
novelist Sundara Ramaswamy captures 
something of the flavour of everyday 
life. 
Turning to the past glories of Tamil 
culture, Francois Gros examines the 
highly sophisticated techniques of 
sangam poetry, the very early Tamil 
writings supposedly produced in three 
sangams, or academies, in the city of 
Madurai. Other distinctive historical 
contributions.of the Tamils to world 
culture are the great Hindu temples 
with their towering gopuram 
(pyramidal gateways) and decorative 
sculptures, and the remarkable bronze 
images of Hindu divinities. In addition 
to an analysis of these achievements, we 
have discovered for our readers a little- 
known text in which the great French 
sculptor Auguste Rodin thinks aloud as 
he contemplates with an artist’s eye a 
masterpiece of Tamil art, a bronze 
statue of Siva Nataraja, the Lord of the 
Dance. 
Finally three areas in which past and 
present are one. the cult of local gods 
and heroes whose colourful statues 
adorn the villages of Tamil Nadu; 
Tamil gastronomic traditions, and the 
classical dance known as Bharata 
Natyam which was for centuries per- 
Jormed in the great temples and which 
today, brought to the stage, is cap- 
tivating audiences in Tamil Nadu and in 
many other countries too. 
With this issue the Unesco Courier 
remains faithful to its vocation to pro- 
mote intercultural contact and to make 
the achievements of the world’s great’ 
cultures more widely known,

HE words ‘‘Tamil culture’ im- 
] mediately evoke the image of the 
towering  gopuram (entrance 
gateways) of the Hindu temple, at once a 
commanding grandeur and solemnity; of a 
beautiful dancing girl, decked out in all her 
finery, graceful and lovely; to the literary 
minded, of the squatting sage Tiruvalluvar 
with his palm-leaf and stylus; to the 
gastronomically inclined, of idli (a rice and 
lentil batter) and sambar (lentils, vegetable 
and tamarind). 
When we attempt to understand what 
constitutes Tamil culture in terms of an 
average man’s life, particularly in the con- 
text of the present day, we encounter 
elements which cannot be isolated and 
defined, yet are deep rooted in a society 
which has always been instinctively aware 
of its strengths and weaknesses. 
Over the centuries Tamils have spread 
outside their territory and in this process 
have planted signs of their presence many 
of which can be found even today. The 
Tamil community thus represents a popula- 
tion outside Tamil Nadu also. In their own 
land Tamils have been subject to significant 
foreign influences and, today, the admix- 
ture of these influences is so complex that it 
is difficult to talk about *‘typical’® or 
“‘native’’ Tamil culture. Today's fashions, 
food habits, life-styles, values are all pro- 
ducts of this long history of interaction. 
For the first time in the known history of 
two thousand years the land of the Tamils 
has definite boundaries and this has 
brought about a greater cohesion among 
Tamils. Particularly since Independence 
and the creation of States based on 
linguistic regions, Tamils have had a land 
with which to identify their language and 
culture. With the introduction of Tamil as 
‘a medium of education at all levels, an at- 
tempt has been made to update the 
language after it lay submerged and sub- 
jugated for nearly three hundred years 
under the impact of the English language. 
The recent establishment of a university 
at Thanjavur—Tamil University—crystall- 
izes the aspirations of their society. The ob- 
jective of this university is to strengthen the 
various applications of the language in a 
modern context and to enquire systema- 
tically into its past so that a relationship can 
be established between tradition and 
modern life. 
The emotional togetherness that has 
come about has been aided by the planned 
economic activities in the State. The most 
striking result of the economic programmes 
is the high degree of mobility seen among 
the people. Tamil Nadu is among the very 
few States in India in which almost every 
village is connected by road or rail. This 
S. RAMAKRISHNAN is a qualified econo- 
mist and social scientist who began his career 
in marketing. A few years ago he founded a 
publishing company to promote the dissemi- 
nation of new, high quality Tamil literature. He 
is closely associated with the Kafadataba 
literary movement.

### 58391: The Living culture of the Tamils

The living culture 
of the Tamils 
by S. Ramakrishnan 
mobility has affected the personal, 
economic and social life of average Tamils. 
The facility of communication has began to 
narrow down regional differences in life 
styles. 
A mobile population is an informed 
population. Tamil Nadu is one of the States 
in the country with a high rate of literacy. 
It must be remembered that one of the first 
three universities to be established during 
the colonial era (1857) was at Madras, the 
present capital of Tamil Nadu. Educational 
facilities are growing so rapidly that bet- 
ween 1979 and 1981 the number of boys at 
higher secondary schools increased by 45.1 
per cent and that of girls by 66.5 per cent. 
Education is no longer confined to tradi- 
tional general education. It has diversified 
and new branches of training are constantly 
evolving. While the number of universities 
offering general education has risen, 
separate universities for technical subjects 
have also been established. Tamil Nadu 
now has one Agricultural University, one . 
engineering and technological University, 
as well as a National Institute of 
Technology. Significantly too, women are 
entering professional colleges in increasing 
numbers. 
In Tamil Nadu, the reading habit is 
widespread. Every week 1.73 million copies 
of eight popular magazines are sold and 
read by approximately 8.5 million people. 
In one segment of the reading public—the 
urban Tamils—42 per cent of those above 
fifteen years of age read a daily newspaper 
and 46 per cent read a weekly publication. 
The second most widely read weekly in In- 
dia is a Tamil weekly. 
These magazines shape public opinion on 
all vital issues, but their main motive is 
entertainment. They cater for popular 
tastes; the three most common themes are 
cinema, religion and politics—almost in 
that order of importance. Cinema gossip 
and news dominate. 
There are no large-circulation magazines 
catering for specialist tastes and preferences 
and serious writers have to find another 
forum in the small-circulation magazines. 
A far more influential medium in Tamil 
is the cinema (see box page 11). More than 
a sixth of the total number of permanent 
theatres in India are in Tamil Nadu. This 
gives some indication both of the extent of 
rural electrification (99 per cent of all 
towns, villages and hamlets have been elec- 
trified) and of the penetration of the cinema 
into rural areas. 
The popularity of the cinema is maintain- 
ed and increased by the popular magazines. 
Similarly the commercial channel of the 
government-controlled radio is dominated 
by film music and programmes on films. 
In Tamil Nadu the demands of the film 
world gave birth to a ‘‘poster-culture’.

the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific and the Caribbean. There is a scholarly 
literature in Tamil dating back to the early centuries of the Christian era. The 
language is of DRAVIDIAN origin. The DRAVIDIANS were the founders 
of one of the world’s most ancient civilizations, which already existed in India 
sometime before 1000 BC when the ARYANS invaded the sub-continent 
from the north. The Aryans, who spoke the SANSKRIT language, pushed the 
Dravidians down into south India. Today 8 of the languages of northern and 
western India (including Hindi) are of Sanskrit origin, but Sanskrit itself is 
only spoken by Hindu Brahman priests in temple worship and by scholars. 
In southern India, 4 languages of Dravidian origin are spoken 1 today. Tamil 
is the oldest of these. 
THE HISTORY OF TAMIL NADU begins with the 3 kingdoms, CHERA, 
CHOLA and PANDYA, which are referred to in documents of the 3rd cen- 
tury BC. Some of the kings of these dynasties are mentioned in SANGAM 
LITERATURE (see article page 32), and the age between the 3rd century BC 
and the 2nd century AD is called the SANGAM AGE. At the beginning of 
the 4th century AD the PALLAVAS established their rule with Kanchipuram 
as their capital. Their dynasty, which ruled continuously for over 500 years, 
left a permanent impact on the history of Tamil Nadu, which was during this 
period virtually controlled by the PALLAVAS in the north and the PAN- 
DYAS in the south. 
In the middle of the 9th century a CHOLA ruler established what was to 
become one of India’s most outstanding empires on account of its ad- 
ministrative achievements (irrigation, village development) and its contribu- 
tions to art and literature. THE AGE OF THE CHOLAS is considered the 
golden age of Tamil history. 
Towards the end of the 13th century the Cholas were overthrown by the 
LATER PANDYAS who ruled for about a century and were followed by the 
VIJAYANAGARA DYNASTY, whose greatést ruler was Krishnadeva Raya 
(1509-1529), and the NAYAKS of Madurai and Tanjore. THE COLONIAL 
AGE opened in the 17th century. In 1639 the British East India Company 
opened a trading post at the fishing village of Madraspatnam, today 
MADRAS, the capital of Tamil Nadu. In 1947, India achieved IN- 
DEPENDENCE. The overwhelming majority of the population of Tamil 
Nadu is HINDU, with active CHRISTIAN and MUSLIM minorities.

Cigarettes, betel leaves, fruit and soft drinks are the principal wares of this typical village shop near Madurai. 
Bb tion was largely illiterate and magazines 
were only just beginning to appear. Posters 
were the only major medium to announce 
new films. Now poster-oriented publicity 
has spread to other areas of public life and 
today one finds the walls of Tamil Nadu 
plastered with posters, with those for the 
cinema still the largest and most colourful. 
The high rate of literacy and the degree of 
worker mobility have contributed to the 
process of industrialization in Tamil Nadu. 
As a result of a planned economic pro- 
gramme a wide range of industrial products 
6 
are manufactured in Tamil Nadu creating 
an incredible range of industrial and con- 
sumer products and large-scale cement, fer- 
tilizer, refining and automobile industries. 
The latest addition is the construction of an 
atomic power plant to meet the energy 
needs of a growing society. 
Textile and leather industries have tradi- 
tionally been strong in Tamil Nadu. Two 
major ports cater for the needs of industry 
and a well-organized transport system 
keeps people and goods on the move. In 
order to create local employment and to 
prevent large scale migration to cities, 
dispersal of industry is encouraged by a well 
thought out system of incentives. A big 
chain of industrial estates for medium and 
small-scale industries in the non-traditional 
areas has been established in an attempt to 
minimize regional imbalances. Thus both in 
technology and end-products Tamil Nadu 
has revealed pronounced adaptability to 
change. 
Industrialization has brought about 
dramatic change in peoples’ life styles and 
mode of working. Farm equipment, fer-

### 58391: The Living culture of the Tamils

  
Above, street scene in Madras 
(Chennai to  Tamil-speakers), 
capital of Tamil Nadu and the 
fourth largest city in India: in the 
background, the imposing towers 
of Madras University (founded in 
1857). With its advanced centres 
of research in plant pathology, 
physics, biophysics and Indian 
philosophy, Madras University is 
the hub of a rapidly expanding 
educational system. Economic ac- 
tivity is aided by an effective 
transport system and high popula- 
tion mobility. Tamil Nadu is one of 
the very few States in India in 
which almost every village has a 
road or rail link. Some 6,000 local 
and express buses, operated by 
both government and private 
transport agencies, cover some 
1.27 million kilometres every day. 
tilizers and micro-nutrients have altered the 
agricultural scene. Increasing numbers of 
farmers are installing motor-pumps to draw 
water, dispensing with traditional methods 
and, in the process, sweeping away into 
disuse and oblivion their charming and 
evocative work songs. 
The electronics industry with its tran- 
sistors, stereos and television sets has 
changed the rural landscape, offering new 
forms of entertainment and providing 
employment to increasing numbers of 
school-leaving girls. Domestic appliances 
ranging from pressure cookers to grinders 
have replaced traditional modes of cook- 
ing, offering new leisure opportunities to 
the housewife in a family structure which 
has changed much. 
Industrialization brings in its wake ur- 
banization. Tamil Nadu has the second 
highest urban population in India. The 
migration of rural populations to the town 
and the transformation of rural areas into 
new industrial, urban areas continue 
unabated. This has brought about enor- 
mous pressure on space in the urban areas. 
Housing is becoming more and more dif- 
ficult; open spaces are filled with concrete 
blocks; slums are growing; sanitary condi- 
tions crumble under the impact; water 
facilities are becoming inadequate; children 
have less space to play. Traditional house 
architecture is disappearing and today, 
flats, with their cell-like rooms and limited 
moving space are the reality. Although the 
Government is making efforts to alleviate 
the problem through housing and slum 
clearance programmes, the requirements 
are fast outstripping the efforts. 
These changed conditions have resulted 
in a need to adapt traditional modes to the 
new constraints, Women are more free and 
have better opportunities to get education 
and jobs. However, they continue to be 
bound by traditional tasks and modes of 
behaviour such as looking after the home 
and maintaining a distance from men. Even 
  
dividuals’ chart (see photo story page 8). 
Religion continues to be a dominant 
force in the lives of Tamils. In fact, one 
observes a more pronounced increase in the 
interest in religion and occult beliefs. At a 
time when the average man’s life is deter- 
mined by economic motives and security, 
this may be the new kind of insurance he 
seeks against economic and physical 
insecurity, 
Observance of religious ceremonies is 
marked among the newly educated, 
employed population—both men and 
women. The spread of electronics is helping 
religious activity; cassettes, discs and 
microphones have invaded places of wor- 
ship. Educated middle-class housewives 
organize bhajan (worship through song) 
groups in towns and it is not an uncommon 
sight to see women commuters on their way 
to work absorbed in the reading of simple 
stotras (poems in praise of deities). No im- 
portant function, domestic or business is 
organized without consulting the almanach 
and fixing an auspicious hour. Magazines 
pout out information on the movements of 
astral bodies and their effect on the average 
Tamil’s life. 
Was the traditional culture of the Tamils 
merely the culture of a particular class? 
Whether in literature, music or philosophy, 
was the thinking that of the dominant 
group? It is said that Sangam literature does 
not mention caste differences, but the ma- 
jority of people can have had little access to

Tamils are avid readers of newspapers and magazines. Some one and 
three-quarter million copies of eight popular magazines are sold each 
week and among urban Tamil adults 42 per cent regularly read a daily 
newspaper and 46 per cent a weekly magazine. 
in Madras city, there are still State Govern- 
ment buses meant exclusively to carry 
women during peak hours. 
Marriage as an institution is a good ex- 
ample of how tradition and modernity can 
co-exist or be a source of friction. Marriage 
is an important event in the life of an in- 
dividual in any society, but in Tamil Nadu 
it reveals a great deal about Tamil society’s 
attitude to the man-woman relationship 
and its place in society. Most marriages are 
still arranged by the parents and determined 
by the astral bodies governing the in- 
the cultivated arts and the conceptual levels 
of religion. 
Independence brought a greater sense of 
social equality and an opportunity for the 
majority to express itself. With rapid 
economic and technological progress and 
the acceptance of values dictated by urban 
societies, there is a danger that indigenous 
culture may be gradually eroded. It is essen- 
tial that popular forms of expression and 
ways of life do not disappear and that the 
true essence of Tamil culture shall survive.

Mass weddings are a comparatively recent phenomenon and are part of an attempt to 
reduce the heavy cost of getting married. Above, a mass wedding in Madras begins 
with music played on the nagasvaram, a metre-long wood-wind instrument with a dou- 
ble reed fitted in the mouthpiece. No festival or other auspicious occasion is complete 
without the music of the nagasvaram, whose powerful tone can carry as far as two or 
three kilometres. Many nagasvaram players come from families that have specialized 
in the instrument for generations. 
GETTING MARRIED 
In Tamil Nadu most marriages are still 
arranged by parents and intercaste mar- 
riages, although no longer rare, are still the 
exception rather than the rule. Child mar- 
riage is now a thing of the past. 
Economic status and caste are crucial 
factors in the process of selecting a mar- 
riage partner. Marriage is an expensive 
business and the bride's family usually has 
to meet all the expenses as well as providing 
a dowry. To parents with several daughters 
this financial burden is a source of constant 
worry. 
Paradoxically, the education of women 
has added to the problem. In many castes 
an educated girl can only marry a man with 
an equal or better education, but the better 
educated the bridegroom is the higher the 
dowry the bride has to bring. For many 
middle-class families education and 
employment for women has meant that 
woman have to earn their own dowries! In 
earlier days the dowry consisted of cash and 
jewellery, but today it may include such 
modern items as scooters, refrigerators, 
television sets and pressure cookers, 
In the past weddings were big social 
events spread over five days. Today the 
ceremony is completed in a little over one 
day. Weddings are no longer celebrated at 
home but are performed in rented halls. 
Government legislation on civil marriage 
has made things easier for those who want 
to keep things simple and laws have been 
passed to facilitate intercaste marriages. 
For those who, either from conviction or 
for the sake of convenience, want to 
dispense with ceremonies the Government 
has introduced a Self-Respect Marriage Act 
which validates marriages solemnized in 
non-traditional fashion.

In the Hindu religion the wedding 
ceremony is the most important of the sam- 
skaras (sacraments). The date is arranged in 
accordance with careful astrological 
calculations. At one point in the ceremony 
the bridegroom takes his bride by the hand 
and leads her round a sacrificial fire to 
solemnize their new and irrevocable union. 
Finally the newly-weds are taken in proces- 
sion to their new home. It is customary for 
a married couple to renew their vows at a 
second ceremony held when the bridegroom 
reaches the age of sixty.

It is customary for married couples 
to renew their wedding vows at a 
ceremony held on the husband's 
sixtieth birthday. Offerings are 
made round a sacrificial fire and 
water from consecrated pitchers 
is poured through a sieve and 
sprinkled over the couple. The wife 
traditionally receives a second tali, 
or wedding jewel. 
Seated on her father's lap, a young 
bride waits for the mangalyam (the 
sacred thread on which is 
suspended the tali, or wedding 
jewel) to be fastened around her 
neck. This is a crucial moment in 
the wedding ceremony when the 
bride passes from the control of 
her parents and comes under the 
protection of her husband.

Village scene in western Tamil Nadu. 
In the cities a generation may still survive which remembers 
the sound —that wonderful sound — of milk squirting into empty 
metal pots from the teats of cows and buffaloes. The milk 
sound, the sound of cow bells, the sound of hoofs, the rattle of 
horns, the rustle of straw, the clatter of milk cans on the 
ground —the only sound like these in the cities today is that of 
bicycle bells. In the city milk is left on the doorstep in plastic 
sachets, and the customer does not even see the face of the girl 
who delivers it. Alas, the alarm has been set too late for that. 
Beside the milk is the morning newspaper, and soon the odour 
of coffee and news will be in the air. While reading his 
newspaper and drinking his coffee, the prudent householder 
will remember to turn on the tap and fill his pots and pans with 
water. The water supply may continue to flow all day... but 
then again it may not. 
In the city as in the village, the first thing the housewife 
should do when she has taken her morning bath is to draw the 
traditional kolam sign in front of her door (see photos page 31). 
I still remember forty years later how my grandmother once ac- 
cusingly pointed out to her daughter-in-law that although it was 
already noon she had still not drawn the kolam. (In fact the sun 
had only just risen). In those days the kolfam was drawn with 
rice flour; today it is traced with white lime powder. Qver the 
years it has become accepted that a housewife can draw the 
kolam after merely washing her face, provided that she has ap- 
plied the kumkumam and arranged her hair above her forehead. 
Methods of cooking have changed. There has been a real 
revolution in the kitchen. Yesterday gas stoves, electric 
grinders, pressure-cookers, hot-plates and refrigerators were 
possessions of the rich; today middle-class people aspire to 
them. Working housewives are discovering time-saving 
strategies in the kitchen. The menfolk and the children will have 
to learn to do their bit in the morning hustle and bustle. 
From eight o'clock in the morning onwards the sparrows 
start to fly away from every home. First the little sparrows, then 
10 
the big sparrows. Then the house subsides into a great calm. 
Now, if anyone rings the doorbell, the door will usually be kept 
firmly shut. Even if it is opened, it will only be to a width of four 
fingers, and an elderly face, frightened by the sound of its own 
non-committal reply, will close the door upon itself. 
Crowded buses and trains. Even if a seat is vacant, tradition - 
still requires that a woman should not sit beside a man nor a 
man beside a woman. While boarding, however, men and 
women inevitably jostle one another in the crush. They are 
bound to bump into one another while standing or moving 
down the aisle. But for the time being they have decided not to 
sit side by side. Some humorous conductors crack jokes and 
make the passengers laugh, helping to dispel the nervousness 
that has been rising into the mind like poison ever since 
daybreak. 
The evenings are starting to belong to the television, which 
the middle class has welcomed with open arms. For all practical 
purposes the television is simply the cinema that has entered 
the home; films that have already been seen at the cinema get 
a second showing in the drawing room. Groups of children from 
neighbouring families are sitting on the floor in front of the set. 
They know what is going to happen next on the screen, and 
shout out the emotion-packed dialogue being breathlessly 
delivered by hero or heroine, delighted to beat the actors to the 
end of each sentence. Not that television has depleted the 
cinema audiences; even for midday shows long queues can be 
seen waiting outside the cinemas in the scorching sun. 
Women attend the free meetings held by religious preachers. 
When these erudite religious scholars intersperse epic stories 
with examples of behaviour drawn from everyday life, from the 
cinema, and from politics in order to show how the ancient vir- 
tues have fallen into neglect, the people in the audience can find 
tearful consolation in relating the trials and tribulations of their 
own lives to the general decline in values. 
The men, and more so the women, also flock to the plays put

on by the Sabha, local cultural associations. They rock with 
laughter at the crackling jokes, secretly weep with the heroine 
when she bewails the sorrows besetting her, and share her joy 
when her problems disappear like mist driven away by the sun- 
shine. Then they return home, glad to have found an outlet for 
their mental tensions. 
For those who do not want to go out or who cannot afford 
to do so, there are the weekly and monthly magazines to be 
read. These magazines contain adventure stories, love stories 
with a social or historical background told with bubbling en- 
thusiasm and ending with a strong insistence on the moral vir- 
tues, titbits of information, revelations about politicians and 
film stars, as well as light poetry and essays. Tamils who do not 
feel some mental bond with these magazines or who do not 
glance at them at least once a day are few and far between. 
Sunday is a wonderful day. Sunday mornings are for routine 
jobs and the afternoons for more spiritual satisfaction. Piles of 
clothes must be mended, washed, ironed and put away. The 
bank must be visited {banks are open on Sundays in residential 
areas). Certain skills must be brought into play to obtain from 
ration-shops slightly higher quantities of scarce grains, low-fat 
vegetable oils (sought-after not because of their low 
cholesterol but because of their low price), sugar and/or 
kerosene. Grain must be pounded and ground. Then, after ap- 
plying oil to the head, it is time for a leisurely bath with careful 
rinsing of the hair, followed by a siesta to squeeze out the last 
drop of body fatigue. In the afternoon, a film or a trip to the 
beach or to a friend's house. And so on and so forth... When 
Sunday dawns there are so many plans and projects nagging at 
the mind. If you listen to the voice of physical fatigue that says 
“Not today, not today’’, and you stay in bed, then the family 
is done for. Even if you get up briskly and chase after time's 
fleeting chariot and rush through your chores, time’s chariot 
somehow manages to keep ahead and when it disappears into 
darkness not even a quarter of the work is done. Every Sunday 
it is like this. You think back and remember the careless 
mistakes you have made, the things you have forgotten to do. 
Next Sunday you must try even harder. 
The gap between cities and villages has narrowed. Efficient 
and steadily improving road transport is helping to bring people 
together. The expanding city suburbs are reaching out to the 
villages. 
The village revolves around agriculture. It is very early in the 
morning when the men and women of the village set out to 
work in the fields or gardens. There is no time to prepare 
breakfast, nor any modern time-saving kitchen equipment. If 
there are any left-overs-from the previous night's food the 
villagers swallow a mouthful before they leave. It is becoming 
a custom to drink a cup of tea on the way to work. In the 
villages few parents devote much time or trouble to getting 
their children off to school; the children must fend for 
themselves. 
Changing fashions are also reaching the villages. Touring 
theatre companies have become very common. Electricity has 
brought lighting. it has also brought the blare of loudspeakers. 
Simple make-up accessories and new kinds of dresses are 
finding a place in village life. The villagers are obsessed by films 
and politics, even though their lives are not dependent on them. 
In the little shops, at the hairdresser’s, and under the trees, 
people gather and discuss the cinema and politics. The two 
fields are not unrelated. Yesterday's film personalities are to- 
day active in politics. Today's cinema people may go into 
politics at any moment. 
It would be wrong to say that the old life-style in the villages 
has completely disappeared. Time once went by at snail's pace; 
now it has started to walk; but it does not yet run. Leisurely 
conversation can still be heard on the thinnai, the verandahs of 
the houses. Inrivers and ponds women take their time to bathe. 
Women still carry pots of drinking water on their hips. The har- 
mony that once existed everywhere between men and other liv- 
ing creatures continues to exist in the villages. There are cows, 
buffaloes, chickens and dogs. The grinding mills still turn in the 
homes, the pestle still rotates in the mortar. Healthy women 
still pound paddy with heavy pounding rods. Boiled paddy is 
spread outside in the street in front of the door. . 
The sun still rises over the village. Leave the house, walk 
across the fields, look to the far horizon and feel the mountain 
breeze like the soft touch of children.

A BOOMING 
FILM INDUSTRY

known as Murugan, is the son of Siva and the Hindu god of

The cinema is perhaps the most powerful, and certainly the most 
popular, of the media in Tamil Nadu, Film stars wield great 
influence over the public. Fan clubs (strangely enough only for 
male actors, not for actresses) are common, each with a large mem- 
bership. Club members promote their favourite stars and try to 
keep them in the spotlight of public attention. They publicize the 
release of new films in which their idols appear, celebrate their 
birthdays and garland their cut-out portraits and banner advertise- 
ments outside cinemas. 
Films have been produced in Tamil Nadu for over seventy years 
and the film industry is now huge (487 films released in 1982 alone) 
with a sophisticated production and distribution network and 
employing a large work force, As technology has improved, black 
and white films have become rare (only two black and white films 
released in 1982) with the public demanding colour films, 
The content of films is largely shaped by popular tastes. 
Although for a while, with the advent of the talkies, films became 
a powerful tool for the propagation of the nationalist message and, 
later, the ideals of the “‘self-respect’’ movement, no such tendency 
is now discernible. Today almost every film has love as its main 
theme. There has been a shift away from studio-oriented produc- 
tion and towards location filming in rural surroundings, but the 
ingredients have remained the same—boy meets girl, violence and, 
inserted willy-nilly into the fabric of every production, the theme 
of “honour”. The beauty of the landscape is emphasized, lovers 
express their emotions in dance and song and fighting scenes are 
scattered throughout and usually provide the climax.

of the ancient Tamils and provides the historical back- 
ground for their eating habits. In the Sangam poems 
{see article page 32) land is classified into five geographical 
areas and the food related to each area is described. 
Many inscriptions chiselled on the walls of temples reveal 
how food habits and religious practices became intertwined. 
These epigraphs give an idea of the role of food in rituals, as 
S ANGAM literature paints a vivid picture of the social life

To prepare food for 
their families village 
women use two age- 
old devices for milling 
and grinding—the sad-

stone rolled or rubbed 
on a flat stone) and,

sacrificing, cooking, dedicating and feasting all became part of 
worship. Not eating... fasting, also emerged as a ritual. 
By the 11th-12th century AD, caste groups had appeared 
with distinct lines of demarcation, and the eating habits of each 
caste began to assume different characteristics. {The culinary 
profile of the castes can still be noted by the careful observer). 
Such issues as “who can serve whom?’ and "from whom can 
one accept food?’’ became significant in the context of caste 
structure. Depending upon the degree to which a caste was 
"“Sanskritized’’, it became vegetarian or non-vegetarian. A 
tradition of vegetarianism, which was largely absent from an- 
cient Tamil Nadu began to emerge, mainly as a result of the 
popularity of Buddhism and Jainism.

### 58399: Rice and ritual: the Tamil art of cooking

Over the years, certain interesting concepts in food ap- 
peared. Taste was classified into six groups, and all food com- 
modities were divided into two broad categories, hot and cold. 
The whole of Tamil cuisine is still largely based on this 
classification which also influenced indigenous medicinal! prac- 
tices: illnesses were classified as hot and cold and the diet 
therapy was based on treating with cold food those caused by 
heat and with hot food those caused by cold. This belief still 
persists. Chicken pox, for example, is believed to be a 
manifestation of body heat and the foods permitted are those 
that are supposed to counter this heat— fruit, butter milk and 
tender coconut. 
Some of the recipes that were in use in the 1st century AD 
are still being followed today, pretty much unchanged. Cooking 
is elaborate and complex, and is considered to be a fine art. 
Treatises on cooking specify the size of the kitchen, the kind of 
stove to be used, the direction in which the stove is to face, and 
even the desirable characteristics of a cook (he should be “’a 
native born of good caste, he should observe the cooking and 
eating taboos, not harbour any grudge, be absolutely clean in 
his habits, and always tie his long hair into a bun’). 
The everyday diet is fairly austere, consisting of boiled rice, 
sambar (dhal [lentils] vegetable and tamarind), fish or meat 
A celebratory meal being serv- 
ed to guests in the traditional 
manner on banana leaves (see 
article this page) on the occa- 
sion of the upanayana., or initia- 
tion, of the son of the 
household. During the initiation 
ceremony, which usually takes 
place around the age of twelve, 
the boy is invested with the 
'*sacred thread’’, a loop of cot- 
ton cord placed over the left 
shoulder and falling diagonally 
across the body to the right hip. 
The thread, which the owner 
wears throughout his lifetime, 
being replaced annually, in- 
dicates that the wearer has 
joined the ranks of the dvija, or 
““twice-born’’. 
curry (for non-vegetarians), a vegetable pugadh, rasam (spicy 
pepper water) and curds. On special occasions payasam, a 
milk-based dessert flavoured with cardomom, is served. 
Even in affluent families there is not much variety in the daily 
menu, but when there are guests or a wedding is held it is a 
totally different story, and a truly ambrosial meal will be produc- 
ed. The food served on these occasions is an indication of the 
hosts’ status. 
Eating habits vary geographically and are shaped largely by 
what is grown in the different areas. In the riverine and delta 
regions, paddy, sugar cane, banana and coconut figure largely 
in the diet. In dry areas millets and grams are the major 
foodstuffs. 
The delicate blending of herbs, condiments and spices is the 
touchstone of good cookery. The combination and quantity of 
spices used vary from family to family, providing subtle varia- 
tions in taste. The contrast between opposing tastes is a recurr- 
ing theme. Most of the popular dishes like sambar, morekolum- 
bu (curds and spices with coconut) pulikolumbu (a spicy sour 
curry with vegetable and tamarind) and the red-hot fish and 
meat curry are all different combinations of sour and hot tastes. 
The staple cereal in most parts of Tamil Nadu is, of course, 
rice, which is often eaten at all three meals. Breakfast in most 
middle class families consists of idli (a rice and dhal batter, 
steamed), dosai (the same batter fried like a pancake), puttu (a 
steamed rice-flour preparation served with coconut scrapings, 
banana, and sugar), idiappam (a rice-flour dough pressed 
through a mould to resemble vermicelli and steamed) or appam 
(a rice-flour and coconut delicacy fermented with toddy and 
cooked like a pancake). 
 
In modern Tamil cuisine coffee has become one of the main 
drinks. Brewed from freshly roasted and ground beans, and 
served with plenty of milk and sugar, it is always drunk at 
breakfast. This method of coffee-making is holding its ground 
in all Tamil kitchens in the face of instant coffees promoted in 
the media. 
Change in food habits is slow in coming to Tamil Nadu, but 
some signs of it can be seen. Wheat is being increasingly used 
in urban areas. Chappathi (wheat flour pancake) may be 
substituted for rice, especially for dinner, and poori (a deep- 
fried wheat pancake) and potato be served as breakfast. 
Though stainless steel cutlery and crockery are used in urban 
homes, food is still served on ceremonial occasions in the tradi- 
tional way—on a banana leaf. The leaf is spread in front of the 
diner, with the tip pointing left. Serving begins with salt and 
pickle being placed at the extreme left. The first course is 
sweet—everything has to begin with a sweet whether it is an 
infant's first solid meal or the newly-wed'’s first drink. The 
series of vegetable dishes, pachadi (a vegetable and curd salad) 
and the crisp appalam, all of which go with the various rice 
courses, are placed on the top half of the leaf. With every 
course the leaf is carefully replenished, the diner’s protests be- 
ing totally ignored. Even among non-vegetarians, ceremonial

feasts are always vegetarian. 
Every festival and ceremony has a traditional menu. The first 
rice meal given to a baby in the seventh month is sarkarai 
pongal, a combination of rice-milk, sugar and ghee. The 
teething of a child calls for pal koshukattai (tiny rice flakes 
resembling teeth, cooked in milk with sugar). The coming of 
age of adaughteris animportant family event, as itis in all tradi- 
tional communities. Milk, banana and sugar are given to the girl 
and to all well-wishers who visit her. Seemandam, celebrated 
in the seventh or ninth month of pregnancy, calls for a variety 
of rice preparations. 
Since Tamil Nadu is predominantly agricultural it is not sur- 
prising that the most important festival should be pongal, the 
harvest festival, which is celebrated at the beginning of the 
Tamil month of Thai (see box page 31). Pongal, which literally 
means ‘‘boiling over’’, symbolizes the farmer's overflowing 
prosperity. Newly decorated mud pots are used to cook dishes 
to fit the occasion, such as sarkarai pongal and ven pongal. 
Modernization is slowly bringing changes to the culinary 
scene. Compromises and adaptations are being made. Tradi- 
tional recipes that call for elaborate and leisurely cooking are 
disappearing. Processed foods such as ready-made idfi-mix and 
pre-packed curry powders have invaded urban kitchens. 
Mechanical aids such as motorized idli-grinders are also being 
used in traditional cooking. The break-up of the joint family and 
the increase in the number of career women have inevitably 
changed some Tamil eating habits. A movement towards a 
simpler cuisine can be sensed. All the same, Tamil food prac- 
tices and their cultural implications still retain their basic 
character.

A number of places in Tamil Nadu are

with episodes in certain popular myths 
and legends relating to one or other of the 
divine manifestations of Siva, Vishnu, 
Subrahmanya, Durga and other gods. 
Places mentioned in epics and puranas

number of devotees. While some such 
legends are pan-Indjan in nature, most of 
them are purely Tamil in origin and in

of the people. An inscription at 
Mamallapuram records that a temple of 
Lord Siva was erected by the king to fulfil 
the desires of his subjects. Whenever a 
king settled his people in a new place, he 
erected a number of temples and arrang- 
ed for worship for the well-being of the 
inhabitants. When  Karikala, the 
celebrated Chola ruler of the Sangam 
period, established Uraiyur as his capital, 
in accordance with the instructions given 
in the ancient treatises he erected temples 
before building housing for his subjects. 
Temples were also often built in honour 
of rulers, parents, relatives or famous 
men.

The great majority of temples, 
however, were erected by kings, queens 
and nobles out of piety and devotion. 
Koccengannan, a Chola ruler of the 
Sangam period, erected seventy lofty 
temples to Siva as an act of devotion. The 
celebrated Pallava monarch Mahen- 
dravarnam I (590-630 AD) excavated a 
number of temples out of rock as an act 
of piety. ‘‘Having made this abode for 
the Lord Siva, whose image he has in- 
stalled there, he bore the supreme Lord 
on his head’, says an inscription of his at 
Tiruchirapalli. Indeed, Mahendra even- 
tually assumed the title of Mahachet- 
takari, or ‘Great Temple Builder’’. The 
~ became 
great temple of Tanjore, built by the 
great Chola monarch Raja Rajal 
(985-1014 AD), was erected as an act of 
pious dedication. 
Temples were also erected to honour 
the dead, either at the place of burial or 
in the form of memorials. After a period 
of mourning, the dead, it was believed, 
celestial beings and were 
therefore to be worshipped. The erection 
of monumental structures for the dead 
can be found in very large numbers. 
Dolmens in particular played an impor- 
tant role in the evolution of temples to 
the dead and, in later periods, minor 
  
  
  
 
temples closely resembling dolmens are 
to be found. Often an image of the dead 
person appears on the back wall. 
The form of worship in the temple is 
prescribed by ritual treatises called 
Agamas or Tantra Sastras. All agamic 
texts consist of four parts: Caryapada, 
Kriyapada, Yogapada and Jnanapada. 
The Caryapada deals with such things as 
the personal cleanliness, discipline and 
initiation of the worshipper. The mode of 
worship in the temple is treated under the 
Kriyapada. The Yogapada details the 
yogic path to be followed by the devotee. 
The Jnanapada is essential as it deals 
with the ultimate end of worship, 
culminating in the realization of 
knowledge and final emancipation and»

»thus embodies the essential philosophic 
concepts of each sect. 
The earlier Agamas are elaborate 
treatises dealing not only with temple 
ritual but also, in great detail, with such 
matters as the lay-out of villages and 
cities, the building of houses and 
temples, and the manufacture of utensils. 
Temples dedicated to Gods like Siva, 
Vishnu, Durga and Jain and Buddhist 
deities existed during the Sangam period 
(approx. 300 BC to 200 AD), but they 
were mostly built of bricks, mortar and 
timber. Virtually nothing of that age has 
survived, although the remains of a 
fourth century AD Buddhist chaitya 
(temple proper) and vihara (monastery) 
have been unearthed at Kaveripattinam. 
Stucco heads and torsos have also been 
found which attest to the continuation of 
the artistic tradition mentioned in early 
Tamil literature. By 600 AD, in the wake 
of the Bhakti (devotion) movement, 
several hundred temples dedicated to 
Siva and Vishnu had been erected and 
these were also brick and mortar con- 
structions. King Mahendra Pallava I was 
a great builder as well as being an ac- 
complished artist, composer and 
dramatist. He seems to have taken a keen 
interest in the art of painting and called 
himself Chitrakarapuli, or *‘Tiger among 
artists’’. To him are due several rock-cut. 
cave temples carved out of small hills 
from Madras in the north to Thiruchi in 
the south. 
His successors continued his work. 
Mamallapuram, near Madras, was 
established as a seaport in the middle of 
the seventh century by Mahendra’s son 
Mamalla. Here Pallava artists lavished 
their skill on the carving of monolithic 
temples, the excavation of caves and on 
sculptural friezes carved on open rock 
faces. Around 700 AD, Pallava artists 
were encouraged by king Rajasimha 
Pallava to embellish with their carving as 
many caves and temples as possible. 
There are several monolithic temples in- 
cluding a group of five temples, known 
because of their shape and appearance as 
the Five Rathas (chariots), which are 
Dwarfs dance in ecstasy in this 
frieze adorning the base of the 
Kailasanatha temple at Kan- 
chipuram. The temple, sacred to 
Siva, was built by the Pallava king 
Rajasimha in about 725 AD.

simulate the structural temples of the 
period, reproducing wooden elements, 
such as balustrades and beams, in stone. 
As well as the monoliths there are over 
fifteen rock-cut temples in various stages 
of completion. Some are adorned with 
remarkable sculptures of Siva and the 
goddess Durga. A carving in the 
Mahishasuramardini cave temple por-

bow and a sword and, facing her, a 
buffalo-headed demon is retreating van- 
quished. All his warriors are hastily 
withdrawing, some falling dead and 
others fleeing the battlefield. On the side 
of the sculpture depicting the goddess 
everything has a vigorous forward move- 
ment, while on the side of the Asura 
(demon-god) everything is falling. This is 
undoubtedly one of the greatest 
sculptural creations of India. Opposite 
this sculpture is another depicting Vishnu

THE TEMPLE 
SCULPTURES 
OF MAMALLAPURAM 
The temple complex at Mamallapuram, on the coast 
some 80 kilometres south of Madras, is one of the 
great architectural and sculptural achievements of the 
Pallava dynasty (4th to 9th century). The most im- 
pressive work is the huge panel carved on a rock face 
known variously as ‘The Penance of Arjuna‘’ or “The 
Descent of the Ganga'’. Near the centre of the panel 
Arjuna, a hero of the great Hindu epic, the 
Mahabharata, performs a penance to Siva. Beside Ar- 
juna, a fissure in the rock represents the celestial river 
Ganga descending from heaven to earth. Stretching 
out on either side of the central fissure are magnifi- 
cent sculptures of deities, sprites, saints, musicians, 
hunters and townsfolk (see detail right) and of animals 
(detail below) and birds, all of whom have come to 
witness the Ganga's miraculous descent. In a nearby 
cavern are sculpted scenes from the lives of Vishnu. 
Bottom right, Vishnu is depicted milking a cow, in his 
8th avatar as Krishna the Shepherd-King. In the same 
cavern another sculpture depicts Krishna holding up 
mount Govardhana to protect shepherds and their 
flocks from the wrath of his rival Indra. Bottom, also 
at Mamallapuram is a group of monolithic temples 
known as ‘The Five Rathas’’ (chariots) since they 
resemble in shape the chariots on which deities are 
carried in procession at festivals. Dedicated to the 
Pandava heroes of the Mahabharata and their com- 
mon wife Draupadi, they were hewn out of rock dur- 
ing the reign of Mamalla Pallava (630 to 668) who 
gave his name to Mamallapuram.

the group are another example of the 
Pallava artists’ ability to portray animals 
vibrant with life. Mamallapuram is a 
treasure-house of the sculptor’s art and 
must rank among the great centres of 
classic world art. 
The rise to dominance of the Chola 
dynasty in the ninth century brought a 
change in architectural style. Most of the 
structural temples were of modest height 
and built of granite. Special attention 
was paid to the structure of the sanctum 
in which fine sculptures of gods and god- 
desses were placed in appropriate niches 
as prescribed in the ritual treatises. 
Despite their modesty, their simplicity 
and elegant proportions are arresting. 
Within a century, these unpretentious 
beginnings were to culminate in the con- 
struction of perhaps the greatest of all 
temples in southern Indian style, built by 
king Raja Raja Chola (985 to 1014). 
Some 85 metres in height and built entire- 
ly of granite, the temple at Tanjore is a 
marvel of symmetry and structural 
design. Everything about it is grandiose. 
Even the five-metre-high monolithic 
sculpture of the dwarapalas (guardians’ 
of entrances) pales into insignificance in 
the grandeur of the architecture whose 
upward thrust overwhelms the visitor. 
Raja Raja’s son, Rajendra Chola, built a 
similar temple at his capital Gangai- 
konda-cholapuram and the Chola royal 
temples at Darasuram and Tiru- 
bhuvanam, near Kumbhakonam, are 
edifices of great beauty. 
Chola art differed from that of the 
Pallava period in that the Cholas were 
essentially great architects whereas 
Pallava artists specialized in delicate, ex- 
pressive sculpture. By the twelfth century 
a new trend began to emerge. Enclosure 
walls and lofty entrance towers known as 
gopuram were built at all the important 
temples and mandapas (halls) with from 
100 to 1,000 slender pillars were built for 
festive purposes. 
From the sixteenth century, the en- 
trance towers were built to greater 
heights, up to sixty metres, and became 
the most important feature of Hindu 
temples. The Vijayanagara Emperor 
Krishna Devaraya (1509 to 1529) built 
several such towers at places like. 
Chidambaram, Kanchipuram, Kalahasti 
and Thiruvannamalai. So imposing were 
they that all entrance towers came to be 
known as Rayagopura (royal towers). 
The ground floors of these towers were 
built of stone and the entire superstruc- 
ture was of brick and mortar, painted 
and studded with hundreds of stucco 
figures, a trend that continues to this 
day.

writers of the ancient popular tradition, some of whose works 
have survived in anthologies of popular Tamil poetry. They 
wrote about alchemy, medicine and yoga as well as magic or 
miraculous powers. The great modern Tamil poet 
Subrahmanya Bharati (1882 to 1921) used to claim to be the 
latest in the long line of Cittar poets.

It dates from about 900 AD and is unique in that it is the only 
bronze of a dancing Siva with eight arms. The Siva Natesa pic- 
tured here differs in form and pose from that of the better 
known Siva Nataraja (see photo page 25). Many forms of danc-

essential nature. 
Bottom right: Dance formed an essential element in temple 
ritual. Dancing girls (Devadasi) attached to the temple perform- 
ed a highly sophisticated ritual of dance and gestures codified 
by the sage Bharata Muni who lived in the 1st century BC. To- 
day, temple dancing as an institution has disappeared, although 
one form of temple dance, the Bharata Natyam, has survived 
and has been taken up by girls of all groups and social levels 
(see also page 26).

Images in bronze 
bution to world art. In early Sangam literature (see 
article page 32) there are allusions to metal images, 
and ancient hymns of Sivaite and Vishnavite devotees refer 
to the statues of deities being taken in procession at 
festivals; these processional images were traditionally 
made of copper. 
Metal images were made by the lost-wax, or cire perdue, 
process and were solid cast in copper, silver or gold. 
Later,an alloy of five metals—copper, brass, zinc, gold and 
silver—was used. God is said to pervade the five basic 
elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether and his cosmic 
body is believed to be composed of these five elements. 
Each of the five metals used in the making of images is taken

One end of the sari can be draped over the head as a

blouse and a petticoat.

popular in rural areas. They combine classic and folk 
elements and performances sometimes continue for 
several consecutive nights. Dialogue is interspersed with 
dance and song and the actors colour their faces and 
wear colourful costumes and elaborate headgear.

to represent one of the five elements and images made of 
them are known as panca lona murthi, or ‘five-metalled 
images’’. 
From the initial sculpting of the figure in wax to the very 
last act of consecration, every stage in the process is ac- 
companied by rituals and the recital of sacred hymns. The 
last sacred act performed by the artist is the “opening of the 
eyes’’ as the carving of the eyes is called. The right eye of 
the deity represents the sun, the left eye the moon and the 
mark on the forehead fire. The ritual fixing of the image to 
its pedestral is considered to be the final consecration. 
Metal images are worshipped regularly, receive daily of- 
ferings and, on days of festival, are decorated, placed on 
chariots and taken out in procession, acting, as it were, as 
the representative of a temple's main stone statue. Almost 
all temples possess a number of metal images and 
altogether they must number several thousand. 
The earliest metal objects found in Tamil Nadu are grave 
goods excavated at Adiccanallur in the Thirunelveli district. 
They consist of copper lamps and ornamental plates often 
with bases in the form of dogs and cocks. One tiny figure, 
thought to represent the “mother goddess’, has also been 
found. 
Of the few eighth-century bronzes that have come to light 
most are representations of Vishnu and are modest in size. 
One of the finest examples of bronze sculpture of the 
Pallava period, however, is a figure of Siva with his consort, 
now in the Madras Museum. A statue of Vishnu in his form 
as Trivikrama {the conqueror of the Three Worlds that con- 
stitute the Universe} and another Vishnu statue from 
Kodumudi are classic examples of eighth to ninth-century 
bronze art. The heights reached by Tamil artists of this»

» period are exemplified by a superb bronze of Siva marrying 
Parvati. It portrays the bashful tenderness of a young girl 
standing at the side of her lover and the majesty and pride 
of the master conscious of the delicate sensitivity of his 
consort whose hand he holds. More than simply a represen- 
tation of a divine union, it is also a vivid portrayal of human 
emotions. 
Bronze art reached its zenith under the Chola emperors 
during the tenth and eleventh centuries and its artistic merit 
is now recognized the world over, Early Chola bronze art can 
be divided into three schools: the Aditya, the Sembiyan 
Mahadevi and the Raja Raja schools. 
Aditya Chola (875 to 906) and his son Parantaka (906 to 
965) built many temples famed for their beautiful sculptures

and ornamentation. Among the many types of bronzes 
made under their patronage one in particular won the ad- 
miration not only of the artists of the succeeding genera- 
tions but also of modern thinkers and artists. These are the 
Siva Nataraja, or figures of Siva as the master dancer. Both 
as an art form and as a symbol representing the highest 
philosophical thought of India they are unparalleled. Since 
that time images of Siva Nataraja have been a feature of 
every Siva temple. 
Sembiyan Mahadevi was a Chola queen of great devotion 
and refined aesthetic taste. Widowed while still young, she 
devoted her life to visiting sacred sites, having temples 
rebuilt and bronzes made. She made generous donations to 
temples of gold and silver vessels and jewels to adorn their 
statues. Bronzes made to her command are notable for their 
slender grace and charm. 
Raja Raja Chola (985 to 1014) had many bronzes made 
for the great temple at Tanjore. Raja Raja’s personal atten- 
tion to every aspect of temple life is attested to in inscrip- 
tions, many of which refer to the consecration of bronze 
statues which are often described in detail. 
Many superlative examples of the bronzes of the Raja Raja 
school, remarkable for their majesty and dignity, are now 
preserved in the Tanjore Art Gallery. A few still remain in 
temples, the finest of these being the statue of Siva Nataraja 
in the great temple of Tanjore. The trend set by the Raja Raja 
school continued until the end of the eleventh century after 
which, although a great number of bronzes were made, 
there was a steady decline in quality.

### 58401: Reflections on Siva Nataraja

REFLECTIONS 
ON SIVA 
NATARAJA 
The great French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) was a 
highly perceptive admirer of Indian art. In an issue of the 
magazine Ars Asiatica published in 1921 he made a series of 
succinct and penetrating comments on photos of statues of 
the god Siva preserved in the Madras Museum. Below, 
salient passages in which Rodin evokes the head and face of 
a bronze sculpture of Siva dancing at the centre of a circle 
of flames (Siva Nataraja). 
  
General impression of the Siva : 
Fullness of life, the river of life, air, sun, overflowing sense 
of being. This is how the art of the Far East appears to us!... 
The divinity of the human body was captured at that time, 
not because they were closer to the origins, for our forms 
have remained entirely the same; but the servitude of today 
. thought it had achieved total emancipation; and we are out 
of orbit. The taste is lacking...

Bronze statues of Siva Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance, 
are an important expression of Hindu thought and 
philosophy and are to be found in separate, south-facing 
shrines at almost all Siva temples. They portray sym- 
bolically the pancakrityas, or five acts of the Supreme 
Being — creation, sustenance, destruction, the banish- 
ment of ignorance and the bestowal of grace. The four- 
armed Siva is depicted within a flaming aureole (see 
photo above and detail left). One hand holds a small, 
double-headed drum, symbolizing the initial vibration in 
space of cosmic creation, while another holds the fire 
that consumes all that is created. The palm of the third 
hand, facing the devotee in the abhaya pose assures him 
of freedom from fear. The hand of the fourth arm, swung 
across the body in the gajahasta pose, points to the rais- 
ed left foot, the place of refuge from ignorance and delu- 
sion (which are symbolized by the dwarf demon trampled 
by the right foot) and the ultimate goal of the individual 
soul where all is bliss and where there is neither birth nor 
death. Siva is the greatest exponent of music and dance. 
He is said to dance in the vast expanse of the sky as well 
as in the pure mind of the devotee. 
During long contemplation of the head 
of the Siva: 
This swollen, out-thrust mouth, abundant in its sensual 
expressions... 
The tenderness of mouth and eye are in harmony. 
These lips like a lake of pleasure bordered by nostrils 
palpitating and noble. 
The mouth undulates in damp delights, sinuous as a 
snake; the eyes closed, swollen, closed with a stitching of 
lashes. 
The wings of the nose rise tenderly on a full surface. 
The lips which form the words, which move when they 
escape. Such a delicious snake in movement! 
The eyes which have only a corner in which to hide have 
the purity of line and the serenity of nestling stars. 
The still fair weather of these eyes; the still outline; the 
still joy of this calm. 
The chin is the stopping point on which the curves 
converge. 
The expression is continued with an ending which 
dissolves into another. The movements of the mouth are 
lost in the cheeks. 
The curve which comes from the ear echoes a small curve 
which pulls the mouth and, slightly, the wings of the nose; 
it is a circle which passes beneath the nose and the chin as 
far as the cheekbones. 
The high cheeks which curve. 
Still before the eloquent head of the Siva: 
This eye stays in the same place with its companion; it is 
in a propitious shelter; it is voluptuous and luminous. 
The closed eyes, the sweetness of time gone by. 
These eyes purely drawn like a precious enamel. 
The eyes in the casket of the eyelids; the arc of the brows; 
that of the sinuous lip. 
Mouth, a cavern of the sweetest thoughts, but a volcano 
for the furies. 
The materiality of the soul that one can imprison in this 
bronze, captive for several centuries; desires for eternity on 
this mouth; the eyes which are going to see and talk. 
For ever, life enters and leaves through the mouth, as the 
bees continually enter and leave; sweet perfumed 
respiration. 
This pretty, lost profile has a profile, but the profile where 
the expression reaches completion, sinks, leaving the 
charm of the declining cheeks to join the attachments of the 
neck. Auguste Rodin

### 58402: Bharata Natyam: an ancient art reborn

      
BHARATA NATYAM 
An ancient art reborn 
Bharata Natyam is the modern name for the classical dance- 
drama of Tamil Nadu in which a language of conventionalized 
hand gestures and body movements is used to help the dancers 
convey meaning and expression. Characters from the Hindu 
epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are portrayed in 
this intricate and graceful art which combines drama, music, 
poetry, colour and rhythm. 
Bharata Natyam is performed according to techniques which 
are carefully laid down in the Natya Sastra, a remarkable San- 
skrit treatise covering all aspects of dance and drama which 
was probably written around the beginning of the Christian era 
by the sage Bharata. For many centuries the dances were per- 
formed exclusively in the precincts of the great temples by 
female dancers known as devadasis ("servants of god’’) who 
underwent years of training before they were ready to perform 
in public. Many sculptures carved on temple walls, some dating 
back to the tenth century AD, depict karanas (positions of 
hands and feet described in the Natya Sastra) and testify to the 
importance dance then held in religious life. It was through the 
temple dancers that Bharata Natyam (then known as dasi at- 
tam, the dance of the devadasi) survived to modern times. But 
then the devadasi system fell into decline and disrepute and it 
seemed that the dance tradition it had preserved for so long 
would disappear into oblivion. 
In the last fifty years, however, as part of 2 new con- 
sciousness of ancient Indian cultural traditions Bharata Natyam 
has not only been saved from extinction but has experienced a 
remarkable revival and achieved international renown. Rukmini 
Devi is an outstanding figure in this revival. Born in 1904, in the 
1930s she became the first woman from outside the devadasi 
tradition to learn Bharata Natyam. With other major artists such 
as the dancer Balasaraswathi she set out ‘to bring the spirit of 
the temple to the stage’, in a movement in which scholars and 
creators sought to rediscover the pure forms of ancient 
classical dance by studying ancient texts and temple friezes 
and carvings and by consulting the survivors of the devadasi 
tradition. 
In 1936 Rukmini Devi founded an academy in Madras, 
Kalakshetra {"’Centre of Arts’’} to train promising artists and 
teachers and since then students from many parts of the world 
have been trained under her guidance in Bharata Natyam and 
classical Carnatic music, as well as following courses in prin- 
ting, weaving, stage and costume design. ’’It is amazing to see 
how limitless an art Bharata Natyamis’’, Rukmini Devi has writ- 
ten. "'For, if one can depict the Mahabharata or the Ramayana 
through Bharata Natyam, this means that one can express all 
human emotion and thought through it, for these epics and the 
other ancient stories portray every possible human 
experience.’’ 
In Bharata Natyam the language of hand gestures (hastas) is so vast that the 
dancer can express practically anything from abstract concepts to objects and ac- 
tions. One gesture may mean many different, unrelated things. On this page: (1) 
serpent’s head; {2) head of a wild animal; {3) recipient or bud of a flower; (4) open 
lotus; (5) the figure 4; (6) bee; (7) to hold; a bird; (8) fear: the figure 5; (9) to eat; 
the navel; (10) a bird. 
Opposite page: Yamin Krishnamurti, a leading exponent of Bharata Natyam who 
was trained at Kalakshetra, the international centre for dance and music establish- 
ed at Madras by Rukmini Devi.

This “Mother Goddess’’, some 3.5 metres in 
height and dating from about 500 BC, was 
discovered recently near a group of megalithic 
dolmens. She is thought to be one of the fore- 
runners of the Srivatsa, or symbols of the god- 
dess of wealth, which began to appear in the 
8th century AD. Similar mother goddess fer- 
tility figures have been found in many parts of 
the world. 
THE POTTER’S ART 
Potters enjoy a special status in Tamil Nadu. Unlike potters 
in other parts of India they wear the “‘sacred thread’’ of the 
““twice-born’’ (see caption page 13), which elsewhere is 
reserved for higher castes, and they frequently act as unofficial 
guardians of the smaller village temples. This hereditary task 
enhances their standing in the community and gives them the 
material advantage of a share in the offerings made to the gods 
of meat, fruit and money. Although their main activity is the 
making of pots and similar domestic utensils, Tamil potters are 
famed for making the largest terra-cotta statues in the world. 
Figures of horses, which can be as much as seven metres in 
height, are much in demand as offerings, especially to the god 
Ayanar. They are believed to serve as chargers for his warriors 
when they make their nocturnal patrols to keep demons away 
from the villages. Terra-cotta images of popular deities (wise 
men or heroes) are also sometimes of monumental size, 
although in recent years these have tended to be made of brick 
and cement. Traditional methods are still used, however, for 
small or medium-sized ex voto objects or statues offered to a 
deity —a statue of a child in thanks for its birth or recovery from 
sickness; models of feet, hands or other limbs or parts of the 
body, for recovery from injury or illness; even of animals (usual- 
ly cows and more rarely dogs and cats). The presentation of a 
statue to a temple often involves the performance of quite com- 
plicated rites, but, even for the most humble votive offering, 
the critical moment is the placing in position by the potter of the 
eyes, the final, essential, life-giving gesture before installation 
in the temple.

classical temples which usually overwhelms the visitor, 
it is the country’s folk temples, several times greater 
in number, that reflect the living faith of the people. 
India’s village temples owe their origin to a belief in the 
various manifestations—malevolent and benevolent--of the 
spirit of nature, and to a conviction that God dwells in all 
animate and inanimate phenomena—trees, rivers, mountains, 
water-tanks, the sea, lightning and the wind. 
They are also connected to the fertility cult so widely 
prevalent throughout the ancient world. Faith in the Mother 
Goddess led to the personification of every village settlement 
in a grama devata, a village Goddess who protects the villagers, 
decides their fate and guides them like a fond mother. 
Another concept that has made an important contribution to 
the development of village Gods is the worship of heroes who 
laid down their lives for the sake of their country or community. 
These heroes were commemorated and worshipped by the 
erection of Hero Stones or Memorial Stones, thousands of 
which are found in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India. 
The erection of Hero Stones and the adoration of the dead 
hero as the saviour spirit of the community may be considered 
as an extension of the prehistoric cult of erecting megalithic 
tombs. The Hero-Stones are in the form of a dolmen with three 
upright slabs erected in the form of a small chamber and topped 
by a cap-stone. The figure of the hero is carved on the back 
slab, facing the front. The representation of the hero on the slab 
takes various forms. The simplest shows him in the act of 
fighting with a spear, a sword, or bow and arrow. 
A ese it is the monumental architecture of India’s 
  
In a number of cases the event relating to the death of the 
hero, the period and the people who erected the stone are 
recorded in the local language. In Tamil Nadu over 600 inscrib- 
ed memorials dating from the fourth century A.D. almost until 
the present day have recently been found. 
It is necessary to know something about Hero Stones in order 
to understand the social background of the village temples. 
Often the Stones stand beneath shady trees in simple surroun- 
dings. Long swords, spears, or tridents are placed in front of 
them, as well as terra-cotta horses painted in folk style. It was 
believed that the spirit of a hero resided forever in each monu- 
ment, bestowing benefactions on the community. The spirit 
was dreaded, loved, adored and worshipped and was con- 
sidered the saviour of the community. 
Some regional as opposed to village deities found in Tamil 
Nadu arose from the cult of a hero's death. One of them, 
Maduraiviran, who is worshipped in central Tamil Nadu, was a 
seventeenth-century hero who defended the country valiantly 
and was later put to death by its ruler after a love affair. The 
romantic element and the hero's tragic end at the hands of the 
very ruler he had fought for created such an aura around him 
that soon his spirit was recognized as a most powerful divinity 
and his temple was found in every village. The most important 
feature of his temple is the huge figure of a horse placed either 
in front of him or carrying him. People believe that his spirit 
ascends the horse after dusk, and goes around the village pro- 
tecting the people at night, 
Another factor in the development of village temples was the 
veneration of women who died in heroic circumstances. One >

### 58403: Village gods and heroes

» such death that was popular was that of the chaste wife who 
committed sati, that is, she died voluntarily on her husband's 
funeral pyre. Recorded evidence for such customs is available 
from the beginning of the Christian era. The spirits of women 
who die in such circumstances are said to be very powerful, 
protecting the community and also severely punishing wrong- 
doers. Their figures are carved on stones, enshrined and adored 
as Masati. 
In all these instances of the worship of the dead as the village 
gods, the offering consists of all types of food and other things 
that had pleased the dead person while he was alive. Offerings 
of animal flesh and liquor are quite common modes of worship. 
Animal sacrifice is often misundersood and blown up out of pro- 
portion. It arises out of the eating habits of the people. The sim- 
ple concept behind this offering is that whatever one eats is 
first ceremoniously offered to the deity. The cock, chicken and 
goat are offered in the presence of the deity, cooked and then 
consumed by the worshipper. There are some temples where 
even specially prepared cigars are offered. 
Festivals are conducted annually for the village gods or are 
specially arranged either to ward off natural calamities, 
epidemics or threats to the community which are of human 
origin. They are celebrated with great pomp and show. The 
presence of the deity is felt so powerfully that to utter a lie in 
its presence, it is believed, brings calamity to the teller. Many 
disputes, such as proof of adultery, repudiation of loans receiv- 
ed and other such matters are settled even to this day in the 
village temple. In many villages in the interior there is no need 
for civil or criminal courts to decide the nature of punishments. 
The temple of the village god, the impersonal spirit that 
permeates and rules the society is sufficient to take care of evil- 
doers. 
The village deity wards off all diseases. If a person is affected 
in any part of his body, or the whole, he prays to the deity for 
a cure and offers a replica of the afflicted member made of 
terra-cotta, wood or metal. Or a full terra-cotta figurine 
representing a human form is made and placed with devotion 
in front of the deity. For happy child birth, a terra-cotta figure 
of achildin acradleis offered. To ward off cattle diseases, large 
or small clay figures are likewise placed in the temple. Several 
hundred such terra-cotta figurines can be seen in front of many 
village temples. And on all such occasions the folk artist (mainly 
the village potter} is honoured with new cloth, garlands of 
flowers, special food and money. In fact the cult of the village 
god was mainly responsible for sustaining and fostering folk 
arts. 
The cult of the village gods has also been a fount of inspira- 
tion for folk music and dance. Several hundred folk ballads and 
songs are connected with the adoration of village heroes, and 
during festivals they are sung by village minstrels for hours— 
sometimes throughout the night. So spirited are these folk 
songs that even people who are in their houses rush towards 
the sound of the music in a trance and sometimes thousands of 
30   
people can be seen on these occasions, marching, singing and 
dancing. 
This expression of devotion often takes the form of walking 
barefoot over fire, piercing one’s body with decorated needles 
or lances, or carrying firepots in one’s arms. Both men and 
women take part in such devotions. 
The conservatism of the village folk is revealed in their forms 
of dress, ornamentation and mode of singing, which can be 
traced back several centuries. For example, in the Alagar 
festival held in Madurai during March and April, several thou- 
sand villagers dress themselves in colourful costumes, and 
wear dresses and ornaments similar to those that can be seen 
in sixteenth-century paintings and sculptures. Another festival 
in Farur attracts several thousand men, who dress as women 
and move through the streets singing and dancing. In another 
interesting festival, held in a suburb of Madras, several men and 
women clad in neem leaves circumambulate the temple of the 
village goddess several times. The fact that such customs — 
referred to in literature at the beginning of the Christian era— 
have survived to this day, very near the capital of the State, 
shows the powerful hold these faiths have over the people. 
Sometimes such folk beliefs and customs are superimposed 
on the classical temple. There is a celebrated temple at Alagar 
Koil near Madurai where worship is performed by orthodox 
Vishnavite Brahmins according to classical rites. In the en- 
trance tower of the temple is the figure of a folk god, *’Karup- 
pan of the steps’’. The Karuppan, the spirit of the hero who 
guarded the temple and lost his life when defending it from rob- 
bers, is held in greater veneration by the village people than the 
main classical deity, Vishnu. When the annual festival for 
Vishnu is celebrated, several million people assemble to adore 
both Vishnu and the Karappan. Such a superimposition of folk 
customs, music and dance on classical temples can be observ- 
ed in many places and seems, at least for the casual spectator, 
to abolish the dividing line between the folk temple and the 
classical temple. 
However, there is one essential difference between the 
classical temple and the folk temple. In the former there is a 
trained family of worshippers, the priests, who perform the 
daily acts of worship and the rites of periodical festivals as 
prescribed. In other words, there is an intermediary between 
the devotee and the divine. The priest's presence is accepted 
as a necessity; he can perform acts of worship while the rest 
of the community pursues its daily tasks and goes to the temple 
only when in need. 
In the village temples communication between the devotee 
and the deity is direct and so the feeling of attachment is more 
intimate. The divine spirit is always present in the village temple 
and anyone can go and worship directly. Whatever the offering, 
or whatever the form in which it is made, the village god is 
pleased. This is why the village temples remain so popular.

Photos on this page show how Tamils in city and countryside 
celebrate Pongal, one of the most important popular Hindu 
festivals of the year. This four-day festival of thanksgiving to 
nature takes its name from the Tamil word meaning ‘to boil"’ 
and is held in the month of Thai (January-February) during the 
season when rice and other cereals, sugar-cane, and turmeric 
(an essential ingredient in Tamil cooking) are harvested. On the 
first day of Pongal, the puja or act of ceremonial worship is per- 
formed when rice is boiled in milk outdoors in an earthenware 
pot and is then symbolically offered to the sun-god along with 
other oblations. Above, wearing traditional dress and markings, 
husband and wife of a city brahmin family dispose of elegant 
ritual utensils specially used for the puja. In the village, right, 
where the ceremony is carried out more simply but with the 
same devotion, the little girl is wearing a new dress and hair- 
ribbon to mark the festive mood. In accordance with the ap- 
pointed ritual a turmeric plant has been tied around the pot in 
which the rice will be boiled. The offerings include the two 
sticks of sugar-cane in background and coconut and bananas in 
the dish. A common feature of the puja, in addition to the offer- 
ings, is the kolam, the auspicious design which is traditionally 
traced in white lime powder before the house in the early morn- 
ing after bathing. Above right, a highly elaborate kolam with 
mazy floral and animal motifs being drawn for Pongal in a Pon- 
dicherry street. On subsequent days of Pongal cows and bulls 
are worshipped. Their horns are painted, they are decorated 
with flowers, garlanded with bells, and offered the cooked 
Pongal rice.

by Francois Gros 
up the golden age of Tamil litera- 
ture, that lost paradise of Dravidian 
culture. It calls to mind the myth of the 
three successive literary academies (the 
word ‘‘sangam’’ means ‘‘academy’’) of a 
fabulous era. The first and second 
academies were swallowed up in deluges 
comparable to the end of the world; only 
the third was rescued from oblivion. 
This third Sangam corresponds to 
historical reality. Medieval commentators, 
followed in turn by nineteenth- and 
twentieth-century scholars, have preserved 
the essence of this unique series of an- 
thologies, written in the oldest of all the 
modern languages of India, which most 
likely date back to the first centuries of the 
Christian era, The Sangam is unques- 
tionably one of the high points in world 
literature. 
Little is known of the more than 450 
authors, except that they came from all 
classes of society, the sole criterion by 
which they were judged being the recogni- 
tion of their talent by their peers. These 
court poets sang the exploits of princes and 
warriors or the sorrows of a nation at war. 
Kings honoured them and they felt a keen 
sense of their own dignity. On one occa- 
sion, the bard Mucikkiranar fell asleep in 
the palace near the place reserved for the 
royal drum, a sacrilege punishable by 
death. Discovering him in this invidious 
situation, the king, rather than taking harsh 
measures against him, picked up a fan and 
cooled his sleep, thus rendering homage to 
his genius. 
In this exemplary anecdote the magical 
origins and totemic aspects of royalty are 
seen in their relation to the sacred function 
of the poet and the cathartic role of the 
drummers (Pariahs). It should be added 
that contemporary Tamil humour declares 
Mucikkiranar to have been the first Indian 
civil servant to fall asleep on the job! Yet if 
today’s poets are ironical, those of the 
Sangam were the ambassadors of kings on 
conciliatory missions (like Auvaiyar) and 
tutors to the royal heirs (like Kapilar). Their 
praise had to be merited and could not be 
bought; their contempt or curse was 
degrading, for they were men who exchang- 
ed gifts with kings. 
Among themselves, Tamil poets were far 
more than a brotherhood of starving bards 
who exchanged addresses of generous 
patrons. Rather they formed a sort of 
academy, as indicated by the word 
‘‘Sangam’’. The legend of the Sangams was

FRANCOIS GROS is director of studies at 
the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and 
director of the Ecole Francaise d'Extréme 
Orient, Paris. A specialist in Dravidian history 
and literature, he was awarded the Prix Sain- 
tour in 1969 for his translation into French of

texts. The editors of the Unesco Courier wish

to be written later, but the historical reality 
is somewhat elusive, save what can be 
gleaned from the texts, from the stylized 
mannerism of refined classicism, the 
academism of a lost academy. Its code, 
however, is well known to us. The Tolkap- 
pivam, both a grammar and a richly com- 
mentated treatise on rhetoric, serves as a 
linguistic reference book for this entire 
period, which spanned several centuries at 
the beginning of the Christian era. 
At first reading, this poetry—brief and 
varied, violent and outspoken, and at times 
excessively romantic—seems to speak to all 
mankind in the language of the senses and 
the passions. The wisdom it preaches is a 
very humanistic, hedonistic stoicism, with, 
quite exceptionally for India, very few 
religious references. Yet these poems, 
presented in strictly ordered anthologies, 
have an inner discipline; words and images 
are never arbitrarily employed. A system of 
conventions and figures of speech imbues 
even the least significant of notions with 
underlying meanings and harmonies. 
The anthologies lend themselves ad- 
mirably to modern linguistic analysis, for 
they constitute a metalanguage within 
which the universe is perfectly structured. 
Some poems are concerned with the world 
of the senses, with all that is tangible and 
external (puram), dealing with civic or war- 
time exploits—the seizure or recovery of 
cattle, preparations for war (a place of safe- 
ty had to be found for the cattle, women, 
children, the elderly and the priests), sieges, 
battles, triumph and disarray, victory and 
defeat. Others speak of the feelings and 
more abstract relationships of the heart, the 
anonymous and the internal fagam). 
Every situation is described using themes 
in which the time, the place and the floral 
symbols of each episode are codified. The 
inner universe is divided into five geo- 
graphical landscapes—mountains, forest, 
cropland, seashore and wasteland—used as 
symbols to imply a socio-economic order, 
occupations and behaviour patterns which, 
in turn, are symbolized by specific flora and 
fauna. Details of secondary aspects are just 
as rigidly codified—the seasons, the hour, a 
god, musical instruments and, above all, 
the sentimental connotations of each land- 
scape: lovers’ meetings, patient waiting, 
lovers’ quarrels, separation, and the anx- 
iously awaited return. 
The mountain is the scene of the lovers’ 
union at midnight. It is the cold, dewy 
season. The forest is rich with lakes, water- 
falls, teak, bamboo and sandalwood. In 
this region millet grows and wild bees are a 
source of honey. 
Love in this setting is exemplified by 
Murugan, that most Tamil of gods, and one 
of his wives, Valli, the daughter of moun- 
taineers. He wears the sparkling red kantal 
flower and rides a peacock, the bird of the 
mountains. The name of the region, kurin- 
ci, is also the name of a famous flower from 
the lofty hills of Tamil country. In this same

region grows the strobilanth, a shrub whose 
brilliant white flowers blossom for only a 
few days once every ten or twelve years, 
blanketing the slopes in radiant whiteness 
under the sun. This event of jubilation and 
purity symbolizes the frenzy of a sudden 
love shared, in concert with the unleashed 
forces of nature: the amorous dance of 
peacocks, their echoing cries, the splash of 
waterfalls, the roar of savage beasts. 
The lovers hold each other tighter still 
and forget the dangers of the mountain 
path. This region is dearest to the hearts of 
the Tamil people and, according to legend,

Kurinci as an example for an Aryan king of 
a typical Tamil love poem. 
The theme of wasteland and separation 
occupies half of one of the most famous an- 
thologies, the theme of the mountain being 
only secondary. The theme of the forest and 
of shepherds at play, the image of confident 
© waiting for the loved one, produced an 
original offshoot; for this is the region of 
Vishnu, and the love theme it represents 
symbolizes the devotee waiting in the hope 
that Vishnu, as Krishna, will eventually 
come and fill his soul, thus experiencing the 
joys of expectation. 
The plains were the scene of triangular 
  
  
  
   
 
love plots in which the hero’s visits to the 
courtesan oblige the heroine to counter with 
a mixed show of coquetry and moodiness, 
tactics whose limits are described in the 
Kural (“‘Sulking is like flavouring with salt; 
a little suffices, but it is easy to go too 
far.”’). Sangam poets offer countless ex- 
amples of this: 
The man of the village by the ponds 
where the carp seize the ripe fruit of the 
mango trees that line the fields. 
In our land he is high and mighty; but in 
theirs... 
When arms and legs are raised, he raises 
his 
Like a puppet, a reflection in a mirror, 
He does all he is asked, for the mother of 
his son. 
The courtesan, jealous of the wife, is 
speaking here. The landscape is defined by 
the designation of the hero (a fellow from 
the village), the mention of a creature (the 
carp), the tree (the mango), the water-filled 
scenery (the pond), the season (that of 
ripened mangoes and sultry heat, a secon- 
dary characteristic and sign of separation). 
The situation implies that the courtesan 
wishes to be heard by the heroine’s con- 
fidante. Through the image of the opening 
lines she indicates that the hero has fallen 
freely for her wiles and that to win him she 
did not have to infringe upon his home 
ground; he is a hero of little substance, it 
would seem, in a situation dominated by 
women. 
Although interpretation and the 
deciphering of the conventions of these 
texts can at times seem tiresome, the last 
landscape, the seashore, affords many ex- 
amples of the compelling charm of Sangam 
poetry and the extraordinary freshness of 
its realism, From behind the conventional 
symbolization of waiting there emerges a 
picture of the life of the fisherfolk; the nets 
and boats drawn up on the beach, scuttling 
crabs and cart wheels bogged down in the 
sand, the odour of drying fish, cut into 
thick slices, which attracts the birds, 
beautiful village girls peering through the 
pandanus hedges, and the wind blowing . 
through the cracks in the roughly con- 
structed straw huts at night. 
We must allow the texts to speak to us. 
The more the theoretical account highlights 
the unreality of the conventions used, the 
more each verse bristles with realistic 
images—a marvellous juxtaposition of 
words and subtle manipulation of rhetoric 
in which a twofold technique of suggestion 
(iraicci) and complex metaphor (ullurai 
uvamam) evokes a situation, and thus a 
mood, by describing a natural 
phenomenon, whilst the description alone 
suffices to imply the most explicit of sen- 
timental relationships. 
Careful use of rhetoric and its underlying 
themes and conventions make for great 
economy in descriptive writing. In contrast 
to the weightiness of the theoretical inter- 
pretation, the poems reveal a subtle 
freedom of movement in the dense matrix 
of allusions and in the art of bending the 
conventions by mixing the themes to test the 
shrewdness of the cultivated reader. 
Sangam poetry has often been considered 
the crowning achievement of a long oral 
tradition; however, the works that have sur- 
vived to this day are among the most 
magnificent and most living examples of 
written poetry. ) H Francois Gros

### 58405: New writing in Tamil

New writing in Tamil | 
HE late 1960s were marked by an 
] upsurge in Tamil creative writing. 
The preoccupation with ancient 
Tamil culture had subsided, Tamil had been 
made the language of school and higher 
education and world Tamil conferences 
were making the Tamil language interna- 
tionally known. The new poetry movement, 
which had started in the early 1930s, was 
still finding its feet, fostered mainly by 
small, short-lived magazines reaching a 
reading public of not more than one or two 
thousand. 
Against this background Tamil writers 
turned for encouragement and support to 
two small-circulation but influential 
magazines, C.S. Chellappa’s Ezhuthu 
(founded in 1959) and Ka Na 
Subramaniyam’s llakkiya Vattam (found- 
ed in 1964). These two magazines, and the 
writers who contributed to them, took as 
their model Manikkodi, a magazine found- 
ed in the mid-1930s, in which the first at- 
tempt had been made to base literature on 
the realities of life. 
The founders of Manikkodi were vi- 
sionaries. They realized the need to provide 
an alternative to the new popular magazines 
which were beginning to make their in- 
fluence felt. Although they were na- 
tionalists committed to liberating the coun- 
try from foreign rule, they were also alive to 
the need to bring Tamil consciousness into 
contact with the mainstream of interna- 
tional culture. They themselves had 
benefited from English education and 
through it from exposure to world culture. 
In Manikkodi there arose a major voice, 
that of Pudumaipittan, who still remains a 
main source of the contemporary literary 
tradition. Pudumaipittan held that writers 
had purposes other than that of using 
literature simply as a vehicle for the pro- 
pagation of certain ideologies. He declared 
that his stories were not intended to be a 
means of educating the world and that art 
could not be confined within a philosophy 
of the sustenance of life, At a time when a 
group of writers, such as Girija Devi, 
Tamamirthammal and Va Ra, were obsess: 
ed with the evils of the caste system and the 
need to cut across caste barriers, particular- 
ly as far as marriage was concerned, 
Pudumaipittan had the courage to point 
out in his writings the problems that could 
arise in intercaste marriages as a result 
of the partners’ differing cultural 
backgrounds. 
Almost all the progressive writers of to- 
day who subscribe to the Marxist ideology 
trace their lineage back to Pudumaipittan. 
Among the writers of the post- 
independence generation T.M.C. Reghu- 
nathan was one of the first to attract wide 
attention with his Panjum Pasiyum (1953), 
a novel depicting the capitalist/worker

THE THREAD AND THE BOOK. Venerated as Mother Tamil and Goddess Tamil, 
the Tamil language is traditionally regarded as the creation of the god Murugan’ 
and its grammar as a revelation by the Lord Siva. Tamil literature is the oldest 
in India apart from that written in classical Sanskrit. In the Tamil language the 
same word nul is used to denote both a thread and a finished work, symbolized 
by three generations of villagers, above, twisting coconut fibres into cord. 
relationship. He was followed by D. Jaya- 
kanthan, a more prolific writer whose 
earlier stories and novels espoused the 
cause of the underdog. 
Jayakanthan wrote about a wide range of 
issues: the urban middle-class, the under- 
privileged urban slum-dweller, women in 
revolt, the notions of art, the confrontation 
between the traditional and the modern way 
of life and the changes this necessitated, the 
notions of brahminhood, justice, aspects of 
sexuality, and so on. His vociferousness 
was infectious and he became a model for 
many writers. 
The younger generation of leftist writers - 
(including Poomani, Pa Jayaprakasam and 
Rajendra Cholan) drew their inspiration 
from both Pudumaipittan and Jayakan- 
than, but without displaying the same 
breadth of vision and limiting themselves to 
close examination of village life and the 
working class. 
What has marked the work of pro- 
gressive writers has been a common concern 
to make literature a tool to awaken and 
reunite the working classes. Basically they 
are propagandists and, in one sense, this 
trend has dominated most modern Tamil 
literature. 
The earlier progressives were motivated 
by what they saw as the threat to Indian 
culture from English education and grow- 
ing urbanization. Vedanayagam Pillai, a 
former district judge and a Christian whose 
first novel Prathapa Mudaliyan was 
published in 1879, declared that his work 
emphasized devotion to God and the 
obligatory social responsibilities. His con- 
temporary Rajam Iyer felt compelled to 
write by the need to preserve rural tradi- 
tions and the path to Bhakti (devotion), 
while Madhaviah, who also shared the anx- 
iety about the survival of traditional 
culture, was urged to write by the status of

women, ignorant and uninformed (it was 
the period of child-marriage and child 
widows), and the threat urbanization posed 
to the individual. 
In the same vein, the succeeding genera- 
tion of writers used literature as a tool for 
social purposes. Two good examples are Va 
Ra’s Sundari and Bharati’s unfinished 
novel Chandrikaiyin Karai, Both deal with 
the problems of widows, their position in 
society and their re-marriage. In 1920 Gan- 
dhi entered the arena of national politics 
and his philosophy began to assert its in- 
fluence on many writers. In 1926 Panayap- 
pa Chettiyar first wrote about the need for 
national independence and in 1930 K.S. 
Venkataramani wrote his novel 
Desabhakthan Kandan which propagated 
Gandhian ideals regarding rural develop- 
ment and the place of the village in the life 
of the country. 
During the 1930s commercial magazines 
began to appear, the most popular being 
Ananda Vikatan. It owed its success mainly 
to Kalki, a prolific writer and the author of 
Thyaga Bhumi, a novel which became an 
instant success due to its nationalistic 
message. Kalki’s impact on his readers was 
such that more magazines began to appear 
thus creating a vast market for popular 
writing, Since the 1970s these magazines 
have proliferated and today they have a 
strong hold on the cultural life of Tamil 
Nadu. 
The Pudumaipittan ‘lineage’ can be 
traced among a certain number of writers 
whose works constitute a very significant 
contribution to the language. In a sense, 
Sundara Ramaswamy’s J.J. Sila Kurip- 
pukal and Puliya Marathin Kadhai, and G. 
Nagarajan’s Nalai Matrumoru Nale, and a 
number of his short stories, represent the 
realization of Pudumaipittan’s objective of 
placing literature in the context of the harsh 
reality of life. These two writers have in 
common their lucidity, their incisive points 
of view, sincerity with regard to their ex- 
perience and a balance between social pur- 
pose and the needs of art. 
From the time of Pudumaipittan on- 
wards, Tamil literature has drawn inspira- 
tion from a handful of writers, almost all of 
whom are the product of Indian culture and 
Indian ways of thought. Among the most 
important of these ‘are Ka Na 
Subramaniyam and C.S. Chellappa. These 
two writers were the ones who sustained 
"modern creative and critical prose and 
poetry in the most adverse conditions dur- 
ing the period 1945 to 1965, both, with 
equal fervour, leading the movement 
towards literary criticism and the new 
poetry through the medium of various 
small-circulation magazines. 
Ka Na Subramaniyam’s Poithevu (1943), 
one of the most important novels in the 
Tamil language, draws upon the Tamil 
psyche with its innate preoccupation with 
the God/man relationship and the 
philosophical quest. His short stories are 
uneven in quality, yet one or two of them, 
like Azhagi, are very important. Chellap- 
pa’s Vadivasal and Jeevanamsam also find 
their source in the traditional world. 
Mowni, whose writings were first 
~ 
published in Manikkodi, must be con- 
sidered a major figure in Tamil literature. 
Mowni’s world is the world of the introvert. 
He brought forth in his stories an intensity 
of feeling which is unmatched in Tamil. He 
was able to create this intensity—mostly 
centering on the themes of man/woman 
relationships and death—thanks to a 
powerful yet deceptively simple prose style. 
One of the most popular yet accomplish- 
ed writers in the literary sense is T. 
Janakiraman. He is a strange combination 
of traditional influences and a capacity to 
give a dream-like quality to the life he 
depicted. Like many of his predecessors he 
was fascinated by the man/woman relation- 
ship, but his depiction of it was a clever 
balance between the popular writer’s over- 
simplification of its intricacies and the com- 
plexity of Mowni. Born in a Tanjore 
village, his descriptions of the enchanting 
aspects of rural Tanjore, with its 
agricultural setting, temple culture and 
music, enhanced the appeal of his writing. 
It was in his short stories, however, that 
he achieved his greatest literary success, and 
in this tradition a group of modern creative 
writers has emerged. Significant among 
them are Asokamithran, Vannanilavan, 
Vannadasan, Sa Kandasamy and Ra- 
janarayanan. These authors are situated 
somewhere between Pudumaipittan and the 
leftist writers. With their under-stated style 
Asokamithran and Kandaswamy evoke the 
charm and elusiveness of the day-to-day life 
of the middle-class. They never over-react, 
they operate within narrow stylistic ranges, 
but their sensibilities are a sincere reflection 
of their experience. 
Vannadasan and Vannanilavan have 
much in common. Both are post-1970 
writers, they come from similar 
backgrounds and they are very sensitive to 
the physical and emotional life around 
them. To both, the simple joys and depriva- 
tions of ordinary people are important, 
though Vannadasan tends to romanticize 
them. He is a little dreamy-eyed in his por- 
trayal of the eternal abiding goodness and 
charm of simple folk. Vannanilavan has a 
slightly larger canvas and is concerned with 
the psychological implications of 
situations—of human relationships, of 
economic situations and those arising from 
a sense of awe at the world.

TAMIL PAINTING 
In both style and content contemporary 
artists of Tamil Nadu draw inspiration 
from many sources ranging from tradi- 
tional sculptures with their mythological 
allusions to folk themes and devel- 
opments in 20th-century European art. 
Brahmasutra (1978), above, by K. V. 
Haridasan, who has taken Yantras, linear 
diagrams used in ancient Tantric texts as 
a support for meditation, out of their 
mystical context and used them as a 
basis for abstract designs. In Toilette, 
below, K. Srinivasulu has combined folk 
motifs with a cubistic approach. Discuss- 
ing the challenge modern Tamil artists 
have faced as they seek to develop their 
own individual styles of expression, the 
Tamil artist and critic V. Jayaraman has 
written: ‘’... it was and still is today dif- 
ficult for Tamil Nadu artists to give ex- 
pression to an identity in line with their 
rich cultural heritage which is tightly 
woven around metaphysical values. 
Painters were particularly at a loss since 
there was no real prototype of traditional 
"work for them to follow. Sculptures were 
the only forms of plastic expression to 
which they could refer since so little an- 
cient painting had survived. They were to 
find the nucleus of their inspiration in the 
architecture of temples, in the roman- 
ticism that exists within a sculpture in 
spite of its rigorous classical 
measurements, in the rhythm of rasa 
[flavour] and bhava [mood], and in the 
fascinating contradiction between 
abstract ideas being expressed through 
form and figurative forms expressed 
through abstract designs—a rich foun- 
tainhead of ‘Surrealism’ as opposed to 
the self-induced hallucinations of the ac- 
cepted Surrealists.”’

picted as formidable personalities 
with superior moral power, capable 
of such extraordinary feats as burning 
down an entire city to avenge the death of 
a husband. This image persisted until the 
dawn of the twentieth century, by which 
time Tamil women were becoming aware 
that it contrasted starkly with the realities 
of their inferior status and were athirst 
for knowledge and formal education. A 
number of distinguished men supported 
the cause of women’s education, but con- 
troversy arose about the kind of educa- 
tion that should be provided and about 
the medium of instruction. Since women 
were considered as ‘‘do-gooders’’ it was 
widely felt that education should prepare 
them for service in such careers as 
teaching and, later, medicine.

### 58406: Tamil women at the crossroads

While the early women teachers who 
taught girls in their homes in the second 
half of the nineteenth century had mostly 
been Christians, in the early twentieth 
century it was Hindu widows who met 
the need for a body of committed 
teachers. Hindu widows were not allow- 
ed to remarry and there were large 
numbers of them because of the prevail- 
ing system of child marriage. (Little girls 
aged two or three often found themselves 
widows, condemned to a life ‘of 
drudgery. Brahmin widows were also 
tonsured when they came of age, and 
thus became physical outcasts as well.) 
The fate of many of these widows 
began to change through the pioneering 
work of a courageous young woman 
named Subbalakshmi, fondly known as 
Sister Subbalakshmi, who grew up 
among widows and was for many years 
haunted by a childhood memory of atten- 
ding a wedding where she had seen a 
three-year-old girl being teased because 
she was a widow. Sister Subbalakshmi 
was herself widowed at the age of eleven 
and was only able to pursue her studies 
because she was encouraged to do so by 
her liberal-minded father. She trained to 
be a teacher and then opened a home for 
widows and began to train them as 
teachers too. 
Women’s education gave rise to many 
jokes about women who neglected their 
homes while their husbands struggled 
with the children, and about women who 
could not cook without referring to a. 
book of recipes. New fashions in clothes 
were also made fun of in cartoons and 
jokes which expressed the anxieties and 
fears of a generation of people con- 
fronted by a changing world. 
It was but a short step from education 
for “‘service’’ to activities in favour of 
reform. In the early twentieth century 
two Englishwomen, Annie Besant.and 
Margaret Cousins, were active in the 
social and political life of southern India. 
In 1917 Annie Besant founded the 
Women’s Indian Association, and the 
All India Women’s Conference was in- 
augurated by Margaret Cousins in 1926. 
These movements fought for such major 
reforms as the raising of the age of con- 
sent for marriage, the franchise, and the 
abolition of the Devadasi system. [The 
Devadasi belonged to a caste of women 
dedicated to the service of the patron 
gods of the great temples]. Many upper- 
class Indian women were inspired to call 
for social reform by the two 
Englishwomen, who were demanding 
that the Vedic past should be revived. 
Women also began to be increasingly 
active in writing and the other arts. Not 
only did members of the Devadasi com- 
munity, who were traditionally artists, 
appear on stage and screen; women such 
as Kalanidhi, Rukmini Devi and D.K. 
Pattammal, who belonged to com- 
munities which traditionally did not 
practise the performing arts, now became 
prominent in dance and music. With the 
launching of Jegan Mohini, edited by 
Vai. Mu. Kodainayaki Ammal, and 
Chinthamani, edited by Sister Balam- 
mal, women’s magazines run by women 
came into vogue and began to stimulate 
debate and discussions on women’s 
issues.

clothes and garlanded

ing and to ward off the 
evil eye.

As the nation-wide agitation for in- 
dependence gathered momentum, 
women were inspired by Gandhi to enter 
the political arena. They picketed shops 
selling imported cloth, spoke on party 
platforms, travelled to spread Gandhi’s 
ideas, wrote articles on the need for a new 
role for women, and became active in 
literacy programmes.

### 58406: Tamil women at the crossroads

TAMIL WOMEN AT THE CROSSROADS 
In 1947 the Women’s Welfare Depart- 
ment was started and set itself ‘‘the dif- 
ficult and comprehensive task of 
assisting women in rediscovering 
themselves’. Since the 1950s the world of 
Tamil women seems to have expanded to 
encompass fields from which they were 
previously excluded. The working 
woman has become a familiar figure in 
the towns and cities, Women’s associa- 
tions have proliferated. The literacy rate 
among Tamil women is comparatively 
high. 
In spite of these changes, however, the 
roles formerly performed by women have 
neither disappeared nor been transform- 
ed. Although it may be camouflaged in 
various ways, the traditional image of the 
chaste woman and the devoted mother is 
still reflected in modern Tamil literature, 
in the media, and in customs. Most 
female characters in stories have an overt 
and a hidden face. The overt face is seem- 
ingly ‘“‘modern’’, but at some point in the 
story the character proves that modernity 
has not destroyed her hidden, more 
beautiful, * traditional face. Gruesome 
punishments are often meted out to those 
who stray from this cast-iron mould: fire 
and water are considered purifying 
elements and have often been used as 
devices for the physical destruction of an 
“tmpure’’ character, When physical 
destruction is eschewed, social degrada- 
tion, ostracism and neglect provide alter- 
natives which in some cases may seem 
less merciful. . 
The media image of women, shaped by 
commercialization, is very close to that 
found in literature. In the media the 
traditional and modern images are often 
termed ‘‘good’ and ‘‘bad’’, and more 
often than not the “‘good’’ prevails over 
the ‘‘bad’’. Commercial values have also 
affected family relationships, including 
the institution of marriage, with women 
being considered as saleable or non- 
saleable commodities. The dowry has 
assumed oppressive importance; instead 
of being liberated, the woman who works 
in an office has been transformed into a 
dowry-earning individual. 
The gulf between the urban and rural 
woman has widened. In the early part of 
the century the rural woman was con- 
sidered a romantic figure, morally 
courageous and physically beautiful, She 
sang soft lullabies and traditional love- 
songs in her unsophisticated rustic voice. 
Much has happened to change this idyllic 
image, and it is today realized that the 
rural woman belongs to an anonymous, 
faceless mass enmeshed in the reality of 
the struggle for a better existence. 
For the Tamil woman today there are 
many grounds for apprehension but 
there are also grounds for hope. She 
stands at a cross-roads, and the very fact 
that she is aware of this is one hopeful 
sign. There are others, Most of the 
women’s magazines that project the im- 
age of the homely woman will sometimes 
devote space to discussion of a law affec- 
ting women, women’s psychological pro- 
blems, or the way in which women’s lives 
have been ruined by distorted values. 
Although coverage of such topics may be 
surrounded by masses of recipes and ar- 
ticles on embroidery and dressmaking, it 
nevertheless makes a dent, albeit a small 
one, in a structure built on hearth and 
home. From time to time a woman with 
a questioning mind is also portrayed in 
the media, but even though such por- 
trayals are diluted because of commercial 
considerations they have still not been ac- 
cepted without comment. 
The earlier phases of ‘‘rediscovery’’ 
were directed into mother and child care 
projects. They were geared to traditional 
needs and were an extension of earlier 
charitable activities. Today organiza- 
tions such as the Women’s Democratic 
Front and the Penn Urimai Iyakkam 
(Women’s Rights Movement) are bent on 
transforming the image of women and 
working towards more meaningful forms 
of “‘rediscovery’’. Most women, 
however, are still looking at the sky but 
have not yet decided to fly. Their wings 
are not clipped, and the time is not far off 
when they will use them, 
BW C.S. Lakshmi 
Three great 
scientists 
Sir Chandrasekara Venkata Raman 
(1888-1970) was awarded the Nobel 
Prize for Physics in 1930 for his work on 
the diffusion of light and for the 
discovery of what is known as the 
Raman effect. Raman discovered that 
when a beam of light passes through a Ii- 
quid or a gas it is scattered and the fre- 
quency of some of the scattered light is 
changed. This change in frequency pro- 
vides a way to study the structure of the 
scattering molecules, and the Raman ef- 
fect has had wide applications in study- 
ing the constitution and properties of 
various substances—solids, liquids and 
gases. Born in Trichinopoly, he founded 
the Indian Journal of Physics and the In- 
dian Academy of Sciences. 
Srinivasa Ramanujan (1881-1920) 
was one of the greatest mathematicians 
of modern times. He was born into a 
South Indian Brahmin family at Erode, 
and at the age of 15 his genius was 
aroused when he verified the results of 
the 6,000 theorems collected in G.S. 
Carr's Synopsis of Elementary Results in 
Pure and Applied Mathematics and then 
developed his own theorems and ideas. 
In 1211 he published his first paper in the 
Journal of the Indian Mathematical 
Society and in 1914 travelled to England 
to work with the British mathematician 
G.H. Hardy at Trinity College, Cam- 
bridge. Ramanujan’s knowledge of 
mathematics was extraordinary. His 
work has been applied to the investiga- 
tion of the temperature of furnaces and 
his theories are being studied to explore 
~ their potentiality for understanding and 
regulating atomic furnaces. 
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (born 
1910), the astrophysicist, is the second 
Tamil to win a Nobel Prize. The nephew 
of Sir C.V. Raman, he was awarded the 
1983 Nobel Prize for Physics for his 
Theoretical studies of the physical pro- 
cesses of importance to the structure 
and evolution of stars. He developed the 
accepted theory of the development of 
“white dwarfs’'—small white stars of 
highly compacted, extremely dense 
matter.

A striking feature of rural life in the State of Tamil Nadu and other parts of southern India is the presence 
in almost every settlement of shrines and colourfully painted statues honouring folk heroes and protec- 
tive deities. Above, the mounted effigy of a folk deity dominates a group of villagers threshing rice.
