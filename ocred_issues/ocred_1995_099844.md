‘OPERATION SOLIDARITY? 
TWO YEARS ON 
BR nT BT YT 2 A TC ET A RR A FB Br To WT I ER AS I a a Mn RT eS 
Two years ago, in our Febrnary 1993 issue, we invited readers to take part in “Operation Solidarity”. The idea was to help all those in Asia, 
Africa, eastern Europe and Latin America who would like to read the UNESCO Courier but cannot afford to subscribe. 
Since then more than 200 of you have taken out subscriptions on behalf of libraries, schools, universities, students and clubs. Some of you 
wish to take out a solidarity subscription for a third consecutive year. We should like to express our appreciation of your generosity. 
Here are some extracts from the many letters from readers who, thanks 10 you, have been receiving the Courier and have written to express 
their gratitude. You will see from these excerpts that Operation Solidarity is extremely worthwhile,

BW “Our young people are trying to improve their grasp of several disci- 
plines, and receiving the Courier is a precious asset for us. Here a dictio- 
nary costs the equivalent of a civil servant’s monthly salary.” (Mrs. 
Kalenga Makika Leya, Director of the Youth Cultural Centre, Kamira, 
Zaire). 
BM “I enjoy reading the Courier immensely and share it with my asso- 
ciates. Remember we lack reading materials in our rural Third World!” 
(Deo N. Ntwari, Rukungiri, Uganda). 
BM “Thank you for your precious contribution which is helping to open 
our club to all of humanity’s cultural horizons.” (Abdul Diallo, 
President of the Culture and Development Club, Conakry, Guinea). 
BW “I am twenty and a student. Reading the Courier broadens my hori- 
zons and enables me to aequire immense, practical insight into the world 
around me.” (Paseal Mutabazi, Ugandan student). 
BM “I have studied at the university of Addis Abeba, and am now a tea- 
cher. Our currency is not easily convertible, so I am grateful for my sub- 
scription to the Courier; it allows me to satisfy my interest in the worlds 
of art, literature, science and culture.” (Wendye Beshah, Welo, 
Ethiopia). 
WM “This magazine is widely consulted by our readers and is a source of 
information appreciated by everyone.” (A. Diallo, officer of the 
Ziguinchor public library, Senegal). 
B “I would like to thank you most eordially and sincerely on behalf of 
the readers of the Tambura Library. . . . Food self-sufficiency and 
health are vital requirements, but we also need books, magazines and 
documents that can help us extend and deepen our knowledge, streng- 
then our determination, direct our efforts and broaden our hori- 
zons. . . . The UNESCO Courier . . . allows us to refer to cultures different 
from our own and promotes global standards and values. . . .” (Amadou 
Zaga Traoré, public reading programme official, Tambura Library, 
Kéniéba, Mah). 
BM “Our students, the beneficiaries of your offer, have a crucial role to 
play in Uganda’s future.” (Dr, Peter Miller, Institute of Teacher 
Education, Kampala, Uganda). 
MB “Like my colleagues in the south, I have noted the gap existing bet- 
ween the obvious hunger of young people in cities for information and 
culture and our inability to fill that gap. . . . Your magazine can help to 
provide our young people with the spiritual nourishment they lack so 
badly.” (Abdul Ajiji Saly, Garua town library, North Cameroon).

textbooks, documentation or outside training, . . . We are determined to

again after a gap of several years and to pass it on to the Holguin hospi-

BM “How do I use the magazine? First my family reads it, then other 
teachers in my department. But my students (age 16 to 18) are the prime 
beneficiaries. We hold debates based on the themes. I am glad that in 
this way my students are able to learn about the world they live in.”

[t may, on the face of it, seem strange to look back at the origins 
of the world’s diverse forms of writing at the very moment when a 
universal new system is being born before our very eyes. Unimag- 
inable not so long ago, computerized script has become part of our 
daily lives, promising access to the dazzling new world of informa- 
tion, learning and communication that we described in our February 
issue on “the multimedia explosion”, 
Some think that this new electronic script will replace all earlier 
writing systems and consign them to oblivion. Are they right? 
While the present issue of the Unesco Courier does not pose this 
problem in such specific terms, its contents suggest that the 
answer to it will probably be “no”. By shedding light on the great 
variety of forms and techniques used to make the spoken word “vis- 
ible”, it shows how close and intricate is the relationship between 
a language and the writing system used to record it. Arabic would 
not be Arabic if it were written in Chinese characters. Turkish is not 
the same language when written in Latin script. The death knell 
starts to sound for a language when its writing system disappears— 
because a language, its script and its music belong to a single 
aesthetic. 
The subject of writing takes us into one of the deepest recesses 
of a people's identity. Learning to write has always been a key 
stage in the process whereby a person gains access to the collec- 
tive memory and becomes a full member of the national community, 
part of its fabric of complicities and conflicts. 
Tempted by the boundless possibilities for travel, exchange and new 
experiences offered by globalization, will late twentieth century 
people continue to feel this need for roots, this desire for familiar 
faces, landscapes and rhythms? We think they will. The further 
they go, the more they will need familiar landmarks. The more 
exposed they are to communication that is rich in information but 
poor in meaning, the more sustenance they will need from the roots 
of their own cultures. The written language, drawing its vitality 
from the works produced in it over the centuries, can safeguard this 
heritage and defend it against the growing threats of anonymity and 
oblivion.

LANEY ERE EW 
ERNEST J. GAINES 
talks to Bernard Magnier 
Nn 
Ernest J. Gaines (born 1933) grew upon a 
Louisiana plantation where, at the age of 
nine, he started work as a potato picker, 
earning 50 cents a day. When he was fifteen 
he joined his mother in California, where he 
began to study and discovered a passion for 
reading. Disappointed to find in books 
nothing about the world he knew, he decided 
to start writing himself. His first short stories 
were published in 1956 and were followed by 
novels including Of Love and Dust (1967) and 
Hl Tell us something about your child- 
hood and family background. 
— For more than a century my family 
lived on a sugarcane plantation in 
Louisiana and I am the product of a mix- 
ture of Afrieans, Indians and whites. 
That’s all I know about my ancestors. I 
don’t know which African country or 
which Indian tribe they came from. 
So I was born on the plantation where 
my parents worked, and that was where | 
first went to school. Later I attended 
school at New Rose, a nearly town that I 
call Bayonne in my books, until I was fif- 
teen. Then my parents separated. My 
mother went to live in California and I fol- 
lowed her there to continue my studies. It 
was then that I became interested in 
writing and started to frequent public 
  
  
libraries, which in California were open to 
everyone, not just whites. 
Bl What were the first books you read, 
the ones that most influenced you? 
— Iliked to read fiction. There were no 
black writers and so I started by reading 
Southern writers. But I didn’t think much 
of the demeaning way they spoke of blacks. 
I turned to European writers, particu- 
larly the Russians—Gogol, Turgenev and 
Chekhov—who described peasant life in a 
rieh and interesting way. My first novel, 
Catherine Carmier, was inspired by Tur- 
cenev’s Fathers and Sons. Later I discov- 
ercd Maupassant and Flaubert. 
Bl Did you take these writers as your 
models? 
The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman 
(1971), which brought him to the attention 
of a wide American public. Considered a 
major “Southern novelist”, in 1994 he 
received the U.S. National Book Award for A 
Lesson before Dying. 
— All these European writers only half 
satisfied me hecause they only talked 
about their own people, and I couldn’t 
find myself in their work. I wanted to 
talk about my people, so when I was 
around sixteen or seventeen years old I 
started to write. 
When I was twenty, after I had done 
my military service, I went to college, 
where I studied creative writing and Eng- 
lish literature. It was there that I discov- 
ered Ilemingway, Steinheck, Joyce and 
others. But none of these great novelists 
had any particular influence on me. As 
someone once said, to take from one 
person is plagiarism but to take from 
everybody is genius! 
Bl What was your first published work? 5

All the great writers 
are regionalists. 
Faulkner wrote about 
Mississippi. Homer 
about Greece. Balzae 
about Paris. 
Shakespeare about a 
kind of England. But 
that doesn’t mean 
they're not universal. 
— A short story called The Turtles, which 
appeared in 1956 in a college literary 
review in San Francisco. The turtles were 
a kind of challenge for two young fish- 
ermen. Both of them are taken by their 
fathers to a young lady to initiate them to 
sex. The little boy who is afraid of the 
turtle is also afraid of the girl. The little boy 
who’s brave enough to fish and catch the 
turtles obeys the father. I am very proud 
of this short story. It has just been repub- 
lished by the journal of the university 
where I teach now. Thirty-five years later! 
Hl When did you turn to writing novels? 
— A literary agent read The Turtles 
and liked it. She contacted my professor, 
and she encouraged me to write my first 
novel. I had already written what I 
thought was a novel when I was nine- 
teen years old. I sent it to a publisher, 
who turned it down and sent it back to 
me. I threw it on the fire. Ten years later 
I went back to this novel, which took 
me five years to finish and gave me a lot 
of trouhle. But all the time I was learning 
how to write. After it had been substan- 
tially rewritten a dozen or more times 
and returned to me seven times by the 
publisher, it was finally accepted. That 
was how Catherine Carmier eame to he 
published by Athenaeum. Thirty-five 
Lundred copies were printed, and I

doubt even twenty-five hundred were 
sold. The rest were remaindered at 25 
cents. If you could get your hands on 
an original copy today, you’d have to 
pay more than a hundred dollars for it. 
I In the United States you are thought 
of as a “Southern writer”. Do you think 
that label accurately describes a lit- 
erary category or is it too narrow? 
— It’s too narrow. I have been catego- 
rized “a black writer”, “a Southern 
writer”, * a Californian writer” because 
I hived in California, “a Louisiana writer” 
because I wrote about Louisiana. . . . I 
don’t feel I fit into any of these cate- 
sories. I just try to be a decent writer. 
HM And yet almost all your novels are set 
in a small area, Bayonne Parish. . .. 
— All the great writers are regionalists. 
Faulkner wrote about Mississippi, 
[Tomer about Greeee, Balzac about 
Paris, Shakespeare about a kind of Eng- 
land. But that doesn’t mean they’re not 
universal. People write about what they 
know best, and readers respond to that 
wherever they happen to live. The Auto- 
biography of Miss Jane Pittman has been 
translated into several languages, and 
readers of all races have written to me 
and said they felt that the old lady was 
somebody they recognized. 
HB In away, isn’t your Bayonne Parish 
the Louisiana equivalent of Faulkner's 
Yoknapatawpha County, in Mississippi? 
— I did get the inspiration for the parish 
of Bayonne from Faulkner’s mythical 
Yoknapatawpha County and the use of 
the multiple point-of-view in the novel. 
But Faulkner himself was influenced by 
Sherwood Anderson, whom he knew, 
and by James Joyce’s writings about 
Dublin. So just as Faulkner inherited 
from them, I inherited from Faulkner. 
It’s a continuing process. 
I certainly feel close to Faulkner. We 
both belong to the South. We write about 
the same things—life in small towns, the 
everyday struggles of poor people, the 
influence of big land-owners on small 
farmers, raee problems. And Mississippi 
isn’t far from Louisiana. 
I In your novels a breaking point often 
occurs as a result of a love affair, as if 
this kind of relationship is a crucible for 
all kinds of taboos and conflicts. 
— That is true of some of my novels, but 
not all. A Lesson before Dying is the story 
of an uneducated young black condemned 
to death for a crime he did not commit and 
a black schoolteacher who restores his 
dignity before he dies. Love relationships 
are not the only situations that breed con- 
flict; it is constant. The major eonflict in 
my work is when the black male attempts - 
to go beyond the line that is drawn for 
him. But you’ve also got conlict between 
young and old, between the desire to go 
back to the place where you were born or 
to stay where you are, between religious 
feeling and atheism. . . . There has to be 
a conflict before there can be a story and 
before the story reveals racial tensions. 
BR Early in their careers, the French- 
speaking writers of black Africa and the 
Caribbean gathered beneath the 
banner of the “négritude” movement to

assert black cultural values. Do you 
think this movement is still relevant? 
— Yes, Ido. Even if I don’t belong to this 
school or to any other school, I accept 
that this idea of négritude, put forward 
by writers who express themselves in 
French, can provide young writers with 
the bearings that are so lacking. In my 
own little sphere I do the samc thing as 
these African and West Indian writers. I 
try to describe the daily lives of Afriecan- 
Americans as well as I can. I think I'm 
doing the same thing as they are without 
putting myself in a box. 
BM What are your feelings about 
Africa? 
— Ihave never been there. I feel very 
close to Africa because of my origins 
but also because every human being 
ought to feel concerned about the very 
serious things that are happening there. 
I sympathize with the sorrows of Africa 
because they are similar to those we 
experienced in the South forty-odd 
years ago. But there are problems in 
the rest of the world, too. I like African 
literature and music just as I like those 
that come to us from Europe and the 
Americas. My culture is, perhaps above 
all, Western. 
WM Do you read African writers? 
— A little. Not nearly as much as I 
should! 
Hl Do you feel that there is a black cul- 
tural community in the United States? 
— I don’t think there is any kind of 
school of black culture in the United States 
today. The expression “black commu- 
nity” is very vague. Is there a white com- 
munity? I don’t know. Nevertheless, black 
writers tackle the problems they know 
well, but with different approaches. Toni 
Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou

writers from the United States, the 
Caribbean and Africa because they are 
black? 
— No, not at all! approve of this kind 
of thing. 1t is important for us black 
writers to meet and talk because our 
works are not taught as much in colleges 
as those of whites. All the same I don’t 
spend too much time at those gatherings; 
I prefer staying at home and writing. 
In my own little 
sphere I do the same 
thing as these 
African and West 
Indian writers. I try 
to describe the daily 
lives of African- 
Americans as well 
as I can. 
HM Louisiana is presented in your work 
as a land of conflict but also as a place 
of meetings, of peace and compro- 
mise. In spite of “the sound and the 
fury”, your writing seems more serene 
than that of other black writers. 
— I write from my own viewpoint, I 
don’t see the world as Jimmy Baldwin or 
Richard Wright did. I may net have suf- 
fered racism as directly as either one of 
those men did, and I haven’t lived in 
large cities as they did—in Harlem or 
Chicago's south side—but we have fought 
for the same causes. I went to California 
when I was very young, to a decent, small 
town where I was completely integrated 
into the school. There were people of all 
backgrounds. There were whites, his- 
panics, native Americans and Asians, 
That doesn’t stop me from writing 
about serious subjects. In A Lesson before 
Dying an innocent person is sent to the 
electric chair. I was criticized for The 
Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, 
because at the time of the civil rights 
struggle the life of a woman aged 110 was 
not a topical subject! For me it was pri- 
marily a piece of literary work, sure, but 
I also described in this hook terrible events 
that were not unconnected with what was 
going on. I'm doing what the others are 
doing, just more quietly. 
BM Do you think that things have 
changed in North America in this 
respect? 
— There have been some changes in the 
last forty years, but I don’t feel that 
writers and artists have changed very 
much in their choice of subjects. The 
change has not been substantial enough to 
halt the struggle against racism. The race 
problem still exists—that’s why I have 
been writing about it for forty years, On 
the other hand, the work of black writers 
is certainly far more widely aceepted now. 
Today I am accepted on the same footing 
as others, and that would have been 
impossible thirty years ago. 
HM Have things changed in everyday 
life? 
— Some people have changed, especially 
in educated circles. The situation has 
changed for some people, progress has 
been made. People have accepted black 
people’s participation in public life. Times 
have changed from the days when Nat 
King Cole had his show cancelled simply 
becanse he held a white female’s hand up 
on the stage at the end of a show when the 
credits were going on. But so many serious 
problems are still unsolved—education 
and unemployment, for example. There’s 
still a long way to go. |

The written word 
  
The appearance of writing 
coincided with the birth of cities. 
Above, detail of an Assyrian relief 
from the palace of Sargon ll at Dur 
Sarrukin (8th century B.C.) shows 
a man holding a model of a city. 
Writing, as a system of symbols repre- 
senting a structured language, made its 
appearance only in the middle of the fourth mil- 
lennium B.C. in the land of Sumer, Mesopo- 
tamia. This system, consisting originally of pic- 
tograms, evolved gradually in the direction of 
abstraction, thus increasing its capacity to repro- 
duce the whole of human discourse. Some time 
later, at the beginning of the second millennium 
Around 35,000 years ago, prehistoric man made the first 
paintings on cave walls and ceilings. It was not until much 
[ater that the earliest writing systems using signs emerged in 
Mesopotamia and in Egypt. 
B.C., and on the other side of the world, Chinese 
writing emerged, also in pictorial form, while 
the Egyptian and Mayan systems, whose origins 
are still unknown, were likewise based on the 
use of pictures as signifiers. 
The figurative look of these early graphic 
symbols recalls humanity’s very first attempts 
to depict things, the cave paintings of the Palae- 
olithic period. What are we to make of the rep- 
resentations of beasts and men to be seen in the 
rock art of 35000 to 18000 B.C.? Though we 
cannot find any correspondence with a struc- 
tured language in them, what we do observe is a 
desire to represent subjects in graphic form that 
bespeaks the existence of a common language— 
or at least of common referents—within the

Sumerian system of keeping accounts with incised 
hollow clay balls.' It was in the course of this very 
long period that the Neolithic revolution took 
place, and the relationship between human beings 
and their environment underwent a radical 
change, the hunter-gatherer becoming a pro- 
ducer. 
By the stylization and combination of the 
original icons, writing systems arrived at the rep- 
resentation of speech and thought. 
The earliest Sumerian logograms, for instance, 
like ancient Chinese pictograms, represented 
basic concepts that needed to be interpreted for 
the reader to reconstitute the message. Castes of 
scribes spent centuries improving this method of 
representation before finally arriving at systems 
whereby all the nuances of language could be 
set down. 
From symbols to sounds 
While the emergence of forms of writing in 
Sumer, in China and, perhaps, in Central America 
can be explained in terms of evolution, the various 
phonetic systems (alphabets or syllabaries) found 
all over the world are thought to have originated 
from the dissemination of a primeval model that 
was borrowed, imitated and appropriated by one 
society and language after another. 
The first system of phonetic (probably syl- 
labic) transcription seems to have been the 
Phoenician system, the earliest signs of which 
may be traced back to the thirteenth to eleventh 
centuries B.C. Although the precise origin of

Phoenician characters remains obscure (they 
were probably derived from Sumerian 
ideograms), experts now agree that, certainly in 
a majority of cases, they were the matrix from 
which have developed the various phonetic alpha- 
bets now in use throughout the world. 
The use of phonetic scripts was propagated by 
population movements like the migration of Ara- 
maean nomads into Mesopotamia, by the activ- 
ities of traders such as the Phoenicians in the 
eastern Mediterranean, and by the establishment 
of political power (e.g. the Dorian invasions in 
Greece), or religious power (e.g. Christian, with 
the translation of the Bible into Slavonic); but the 
success of these scripts was undoubtedly due in 
the main to the fact that they were so much easier

Fach of the societies that, one after another, 
borrowed the Phoenician system had to adapt it 
to its own requirements. Thus it was that the 
Aramaic, Hebrew and Nabataean scripts came 
into being, subsequently giving rise to other 
scripts, again adapted and transformed—Greek 
and Arabic, which in their turn gave rise to others. | 
At this point we are no longer dealing with 
dissemination or evolution but with contam- 
nation. 
The return of the image 
What function does writing then serve? To begin 
with, it had two distinct purposes. In China, it was 
primarily used to communicate with the other 
world, as is shown by such archaeological objects 
as incised tortoise shells and “oracle bones”. Its 
function was thus, initially, a magical one, quite 
unlike what was happening in Sumer, where its 
first use was for keeping accounts. Elsewhere, in 
Egypt or among the Maya, writing was known 
only to the priesthood and served a religious 
purpose, while in Europe at a later date it was for 
a long time the exclusive preserve of the clergy. 
Since both the spiritual and the temporal 
power were very often in the hands of the same 
individuals, writing, which was linked, whether 
closely or distantly, to magic, became involved in 
the establishment of the legal and political 
authority. Long the prerogative of rulers, it fil- 
tered down only slowly to the other strata of 
society. When the Maya priests disappeared, for 
example, the secrets of Maya writing died with 
them, and it was centuries before the Egyptian 
demotic script appeared, to be used in public 
administration, commerce and literature. In the 
West, widespread literacy dates back only to the 
late nineteenth century, and even today none of 
the modern industrialized societies can boast a 100 
per cent literacy rate. 
Paradoxically, it is in these latter societies, 
where the law is set down in writing and writing 
therefore often has the force of law, that com- 
munication through images has been gaining. 
ground considerably for the last century and a 
half. Whilst the invention of printing may for a 
while have halted the evolution of writing or 
held it in check, the return of the image, together 
with the fact that new ideograms and pictograms 
are constantly appearing all around us, seems to 
show that that evolution has taken off again. W

### 99848: The Birth of writing

The birth of writing 
by Béatrice André-Salvini 
In ancient Mesopotamia writing was invented in response to the 
need to keep accounts and make lists. The earliest recorded 
calculations were inscribed on tablets of clay, an abundant material 
in the valleys of the Near East. 
Mother-of.pear sheep and goats 
encrusted into a lapis lazuli 
mosaic adorn the “Standard of 
Ur” (above), a Sumerian artefact 
produced around 2800-2100 B.C. 
Writing appeared for the first time around 
3300 B.C. in the land of Sumer, during a 
period of far-reaching change which coincided 
with the construction of the first towns. At this 
time, the political, social and cultural condi- 
tions needed for writing to be invented were 
all met. 
The city of Uruk, in the south of the country, 
was prosperous and began to engage in long-dis- 
tance trade to import the raw materials which it 
lacked. 
The temple of the tutelary god became a 
great administrative centre, placed under the 
authority of a political and religious leader, the 
“king-priest”. Relations became complex and the 
temple administrators had to manage move- 
ments of personnel, salaries and incoming and 
outgoing goods and flocks of animals. Since the 
capacity of the human memory is limited, it 
became necessary to find a new and unified 
system of reference enabling oral information to 
be preserved and recovered later on in spoken 
form. This is how writing was born. It represents 
symbols of society in images. New concepts 
were therefore depicted in an abstract form in 
the earliest attempts at writing. The word for 
sheep, the animal which had to be counted most 
often, was, for example, first represented by a 
cross in a circle—the animal in its enclosure.

### 99848: The Birth of writing

Towards the middle of the third millennium signs were split up, 
reversed and simplified. No longer used to represent an object 
but the sounds that made up its name, they lost some of their 
symbolic content. Cuneiform writing had reached the stage at 
which it could express ideas. 
A neo-Sumerian administrative 
tablet dating from the end of the 
3rd millennium B.C. 
  
but tts form and content gradually developed in 
the following centuries. 
The form of the linear script, incised with a 
pointed tool, soon changed. The signs lost all 
resemblance to the original figurative outline. 
This phenomenon was due to the medium used 
to support writing, i.e. clay, which was the only 
eligible natural material in southern 
Mesopotamia. Its constraints led to the trans- 
formation of the signs. As it is hard to draw 
curved lines on soft clay, they were broken 
down into straight lines which, instead of being 
incised, were soon imprinted using a reed 
calamus with a triangular end which produces 
wedge-shaped impressions. These may be hor- 
izontal, oblique or vertical, and their different 
combinations form a sign. 
As the script changed, the scribes also endeav- 
oured to increase the range and efficiency of the 
ideographic system by creating composite signs. 
To stmplify writing, attempts were made to 
reduce the number of signs, so that the same 
ideogram was soon used to transcribe similar 
actions or concepts. The reader had to choose 
between these different meanings by reference to 
the context, and this was not always easy. 
To remedy this difficulty of interpretation, 
“determinatives” were invented; these were 
placed at the beginning or end of words and 
were probably not pronounced. They specified 
the category to which the concept that was 
expressed belonged: God, man, planet, bird, 
country, stone object, etc. The need to tran- 
scribe proper nouns and grammatical elements 
led to the invention of signs representing sounds 
(phonograms) by ridding ideograms of their 
meaning and retaining only their sound. 
These techniques led to a diminution in the 
repertoire of signs, which was reduced from 
900 in the early period to about 500 around 
2400 B.C. It thus became possible to develop a 
system which was partly syllabic, enabling 
written sentences to represent linear relation- 
ships between words and to represent all the 
nuances of the spoken language.

The content of the texts was also enriched, 


### 99848: The Birth of writing

reflecting the new possibilities for reproducing 
all the elements of the Sumerian language. 
From book-keeping to narrative 
The first written versions of Sumerian litera- 
ture, in which only the roots of verbs were tran- 
scribed, leaving the reader to fill in the missing 
elements, appeared in the era of the archaic 
dynasties (around 2700 B.C.), together with 
contracts and other commercial documents. 
Towards the middle of the third millennium 
signs were split up, reversed and simplified; no 
longer used to represent an object but the sounds 
that made up its name, they lost some of their 
symbolic content. Their forms increasingly 
changed. By now the writing of grammatical 
forms was well defined and cuneiform writing 
(from the Latin cuneus or wedge) was able to 
express ideas. It spread beyond the confines of 
Sumerian territory, and its adaptation for use in 
languages other than Sumerian was to become 
the main factor in its evolution. 
Around the year 2340 B.C., the new masters 
of the country, the Akkad emperors, used the 
Sumerian script to transcribe their own Semitic 
language, Akkadian. At the end of the third 
millennium, a brief return of the Sumerians to 
power witnessed an effort on the part of poets, 
writers and scholars to transcribe and circulate 
the great literary works of the oral tradition: 
hymns to the gods, myths, prayers, epics, philo- 
sophical essays and collections of knowledge. 
The Gilgamesh epic was to become the most 
widely disseminated work. Around the year 
2000 B.C., Sumerian disappeared from 
 
replaced by Akkadian, which then split into 
two dialects: Assyrian in the north and Baby- 
lonian in the south. But Sumerian was to remain 
the language of erudite culture until the last 
days of cuneiform writing in the first century of 
the Christian era. 
Despite its complexity, this system spread 
throughout the ancient Near East, to be used for 
writing many different Semitic, Indo-European 
(such as Hittite) or “Asiatic” languages. The 
decline of cuneiform began in the first millen- 
nium when Aramaean nomads penetrated into 
Mesopotamia and introduced their own written 
language using a linear alphabet which was easy 
to learn and handle, was readily accessible and 
could be set down on a lighter material, i.e. 
papyrus. Cuneiform writing, which was clumsy 
and was practised only by a small number of ini- 
Mesopotamia as a spoken language and was tiates, gradually declined. |

From pictograms to pinyin 
by Rinnie Tang-Loaec and Pierre Colombe 
The Chinese still use a form of writing that originated well over 
3,000 years ago 
DLS ESS 
RINNIE TANG-LOAEC, 
of France, was formerly an 
ethnologist at the Musée de 
I'Homme in Paris. She is co- 
author (with Léo Landsman) of 
Le mouvement qui apaise, a 
book about Chinese boxing (Epi, 
Paris, 1984). 
PIERRE COLOMBEL, 
a French specialist in cave

Research (CNRS), is attached to 
the Musée de I'Homme in Paris, 
A very old tradition has it that writing 
consists of more or less figurative signs 
which represent beings and objects or evoke 
natural phenomena. 
A popular legend tells how Fu-Hsi, who 
introduced laws to China and is regarded as the 
mythical inventor of Chinese writing, drew 
inspiration from the claw marks left by birds in 
the snow. 
A more sophisticated version of the same 
legend is to be found in a text dating from the 
T’ang dynasty (618-907) in which the author 
recounts that Fu-Hsi had four eyes so that he 
could watch the earth and sky simultancously. 
Observation of the Kui constellation in the sky 
and of the marks of birds and tortoises on the 
carth inspired him to develop writing. 
From the early days of Chinese writing, dif- 
ferent types of signs appeared and went on to 
evolve and become the “keys” to the system. 
The basic elements which lie at the origin of 
this script are iconic. The most ancient known 
forms are human figures painted or engraved on 
rock faces, for instance in the rock art sites in the 
Yinshan Mountains of inner Mongolia. 
With the passage of time, these simple pic- 
tograms gradually became more stylized. From 
them developed ideograms, which are combina- 
tions of two or three pictographic signs depicting 
actions, basic ideas and more complex notions. 
The notion of light, for example, is 2a combination 
of signs depicting the sun and the moon. 
In modern writing, characters developed 
out of these pictograms are few and far between,

but they constitute the “radicals” or “keys” 
forming the basis for the classification of char- 
acters in dictionaries which was to remain in 
use until the creation in the 1950s of the pinyin 
system for the phonetic transcription of Chinese 
characters into the Roman alphabet. 
The appearance of a Chinese script enabling 
texts to be written dates back to the transitional 
period between the Hsia (twenty-second to 
eighteenth centuries B.C.) and Shang (eigh- 
teenth to eleventh centuries B.C.) dynasties. 
This was the time when a hierarchy became 
established in Chinese society and the power of 
the state was solidly based. 
Natural selection 
Archaeological discoveries have so far enabled 
an inventory to be compiled of some 4,000 char- 
acters engraved on more than 10,000 pieces of 
material—tortoise shells and flat bones that 
were used both for divinatory purposes and 
also to record events or draw up inventories. 
These ancient characters retrace the genesis and 
evolution of Chinese writing. More than a thou- 
sand of them have so far been identified. They 
are in a sense “stenographic drawings” which are 
schematized and obey a strict rule: a word and 
its expression correspond to each character. 
In the Shang period, this type of writing, 
which was the outcome of a long period during 
which the characters had changed, was already 
in current use, but not all the characters cre- 
ated in this way were in fact retained. Some 
which were difficult to communicate, had little 
significance or were hard to memorize, were 
destined to disappear. Others on the contrary 
which more effectively evoked specific con- 
cepts and were more widely accessible, became 
the first elements of a script used by a people 
who shared the same cultural background. 
Chinese writing thus consisted originally of 
simple, stylized forms (pictograms) or combi- 
nations of pictograms which evoked an action or 
a concept. It might be said that, at its birth, this 
writing was created independently of the lan- 
guage and that the equivalence which exists 
today with the spoken word is the outcome of 
a long process of natural evolution. [| 
These divinatory inscriptions on 
bone are among the earliest 
known traces of Chinese writing 
(16th-11th centuries B.C.)

had to walk around in order to read the texts, 
which were mainly concerned with events

related to astronomical observations or marked 
the beginning or end of governments. Figures 
and dates were abundant. 
The first moveable supports used for writing 
were probably animal hides (mainly deerskins). 
Jadeite masks and figurines sent as offerings to 
distant temples bore short, probably religious 
texts, explaining where the objects were from. 
Longer and more complex texts on mythical, 
historical and religious subjects were written 
on ceramic receptacles. 
Much later on, when cotton was grown, spun 
and woven, cartographical and genealogical infor- 
mation was recorded on large pieces of cloth. 
In earlier times the bark of the wild fig tree, the 
amaitl, was used to make long strips of “paper” on 
which illustrated texts were inscribed. Leaves of 
paper and hides could be kept rolled up in scrolls, 
or else folded and protected between two pieces 
of wood to form codices (singular codex), the 
name given to the European manuscript books 
which they resembled. 
Pictograms drawn from observation 
Because they differ in appearance, it has been 
sald there are several Central American writing 
systems. There is, however, a single basic system 
whose most original feature is its pictorial basis. 
Images were fully codified in order to tran- 
scribe the basic semantic and phonetic elements 
of the languages of the indigenous populations, 
which could then be used to record and com- 
municate their ideas and their knowledge, and 
also produce works of art. 
The pictographic or pictorial manuscripts 
of Central America are like strip cartoons in 
which every figure counts because each element 
signifies a concept and refers to an object, as 
well as having phonetic and plastic values. 
The pictograms were the result of direct 
observation. They showed plants, animals, man- 
ufactured objects and parts of the human body 
with various degrees of stylization, sometimes 
in completely abstract form. 
There was nothing gratuitous or purely dec- 
orative about these drawings, which should be 
read as a totality. They originally formed part of 
a common plastic convention, although the 
image changes in response to the linguistic needs 
of each group. 
The spatial distribution of the signs also 
varies from one civilization to another. The 
Maya, for example, tended to favour a linear 
arrangement for certain types of sign, though 
they also set aside horizontal or vertical areas in 
order to write other words continuously, par- 
ticularly when they were recording calculations 
or presenting a chronology of events. 
However, the first word signs were drawn 
inside cartouches in which figurative elements can 
be seen. In Central American images the largest 
drawings seem distinct from the others. Space in 
general seems to be divided into two: glyphic 
for small images and iconic for larger ones. Mixtec 
and Aztec documents depict “landscapes” and 
“scenes” in which different themes are superim- 
posed and information is presented step by step. 
Glyphs and icons are combined and associ- 
ated in the pictorial area. There are always some 
guidelines to indicate the direction in which the 
manuscript is to be read. The script is a mixture 
of logography and iconography. 
It is only in documents with a highly spe- 
cific purpose, such as calendars, chronicles or 
 
Detail from an Aztec ritual 
calendar or “book of destiny” 
dating from the time of the 
conquistadors {15th-16th 
centuries). Painted on paper 
made from bark, the calendar was 
dedicated to Petecatl, the god of 
pulque (fermented agave juice) 
symbolized by the pot at his feet. 
In front of the god are two 
warriors, an eagle and a jaguar.

Scientific Research (CNRS) and

The Aztec model 
Tlacuiloa, the term used in Nahuatl, the lan- 
guage of the Aztecs, to designate the traditional 
writing system means “to write while painting” 
or else “to paint while writing”—writing and 
painting being in this case the same activity. 
Although research into the decoding of the 
Aztec notation is still in its infancy, we can be 
sure that it is a dual system of drawings (glyphs 
and icons) originating from the same plastic 
convention and based on the sounds of Nahuatl. 
Codification of images is thus primarily by 
sound: shapes defined by a black outline form 
surfaces designed to contain colours. These 
symbols transcribe the basic phonetic elements 
(syllables) and semantic elements of the Nahuatl 
language. 
Essentially, there is a single system 
with a pictorial basis. Images were 
codified to allow the indigenous 
populations to record and 
communicate their ideas, and also 
produce works of art.

Atove, a Maya manuscript (15th- 
16th centuries). Glyphs and drawings 
are painted on a strip of paper made 
from fibres of the amati (wild fig) tree. 
The manuscript is several metres long 
and folds like an accordeon. 
Words, sentences and paragraphs are con- 
structed using combinations of these elements. 
The plastic and phonic composition created by 
the tlacuilo (“writer-painter”) results in “picture- 
texts” where the order and direction for reading 
the shapes and colours arc indicated by the artist 
within the drawing itself. 
Colours are basic components of the Central 
American pictographic system, unlike other 
such systems. They are pronounced (cach one 
has a phonetic value) and the syllables of their 
names are combined with those of other ele- 
ments, including their own receptacle-shapes. 
This in no way diminishes their representative 
value. 
These codices or “picture-texts” must first of 
all be read in the Nahuatl language before being 
interpreted. To do this, the reader must know, in 
addition to the language, the code governing 
shapes, surfaces and colours in the Aztec system 
of representation. |

Oral tradition was paramount among the 
Arabs in pre-Islamic days, and pocts were 
the memory of their tribe. Then the Arabs felt 
the need to write down their stories, first simply 
as an aide-mémoire, using only a few signs. 
With the advent of Islam in the seventh cen- 
tury A.D. writing began to be important because 
it gave visual form to the word of God. The 
Qur’an, the first book written in Arabic, played 
a key role in its development and the evolution 
of calligraphy.

Precise practices were laid down. The writing 
instrument was the calamus, a sharpened reed 
still used by calligraphers. The method of sharp- 
ening it was most important, for it varied with 
different scripts. The ink was prepared with 
meticulous care and (like the calamus) in strict 
secrecy. 
The teaching of writing was the responsi- 
bility of a master, who began by drawing letters 
in the sand with his finger. The pupils imitated 
him, then rubbed it all out and started afresh.

“Dont use two words if one will

Massoudy in 11 different styles:

school in Andkhoy, Turkestan 
(Afghanistan). 
or 
Later, smooth wooden tablets coated with clay 
were used. Each pupil drew a few lines, and then 
had to keep them until he knew them by heart. 
At the end of the seventh century, Arabic and 
its script became official, and were adopted in the 
administration of all Muslim countries. The 
script evolved into two main forms, a rounded 
flowing one called nashki and a stiff angular 
one called kufi. These two styles gave rise to a 
multitude of others, nearly all named after their 
place of origin (thus bir: from the town of Hira, 
hijazi from the Hijaz area, etc.). 
In the eighth century the Arabs learned the 
secret of paper-making from the Chinese, and 
this encouraged the spread of written texts and 
fostered the growth of writing. Every corner of 
the far-flung Muslim empire had its own style, 
reflecting its culture and tastes. Thus while the 
kufi script was the one mainly used for writing 
the Qur’an, it did not have the same appear- 
ance in India as in Iraq, nor the same in Egypt as 
in Andalusia. 
Monumental lettering (painted on enamel, or 
carved in wood or stone) became even more 
different, gradually diverging from handwriting 
until it lost its original structure. One of the 
earliest inscriptions is the one inside the Dome 
of the Rock at Jerusalem, in which gilded Kufic 
characters on a blue ground run along the mosaic 
walls: this dates from the seventh century. Later 
there was a proliferation of calligraphy on all 
religious and secular monuments. 
Kufic script was originally thick and heavy: 
when it turned into an architectural feature it 
became refined and monumental. The characters 
became taller and thinner, suggesting a town- 
scape with domes and minarets, or else formed 
plaited, floral or geometrical designs. Quad- 
rangular Kufic, for example, consists entirely of 
lines meeting at right angles, which gives it aus- 
terity and strength. The written words are sim- 
plified in form; the letters no longer follow one 
another on a line, but float in space as though 
weightless, or are intertwined in a spiralling 
diagonal along the rounded stem of the minarets. 
Ax abstract art form 
Script, omnipresent not only on monuments 
but also on clothing, crockery and furniture, 
was the premier visual art form of the Islamic 
city—representations of “beings with souls” 
having fallen into disrepute. Writing became 
the main decorative feature of mosques, palaces 
and schools. The only exception was scientific 
and literary books, but even there representa- 
tions of the human figure lacked realism, relief 
and depth. Thus it was calligraphers who bor- 
rowed from the vocabulary of artists and used 
words to give the illusion of illustration. 
According to their inspiration and personal 
taste they enriched their texts with new mean- 
ings, as in the so-called “mirror calligraphy” 
conveying mystical fervour. 
On monuments, calligraphy became an 
object of meditation. Complicated geometrical 
constructions known as calligrams became illeg- 
ible, or contrariwise simplified to the extreme,

like the enormous single letter waw on the wall 
of the Great Mosque at Bursa, in Turkey. Cal- 
ligraphy thus became an abstract art form, 
expressing the feelings of the calligrapher which 
the observer could interpret as he wished. It 
developed in two main directions. First, the 
shape of the letters themselves—sloping up, 
sloping down or lying down—required callig- 
raphers to be extremely meticulous. The shape 
varied according to whether the letter was at 
the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the

did not exclude innovation. After spending years

tenth century: “When the pen becomes a tyrant, 
it binds together that which was separate and 
scparates that which was bound together.” 
An alphabet used by thirty-odd

As carly as the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-

ligraphers had given rise to dozens of specialized 
styles. There was one reserved for the caliph, one 
for ministers, and yet another for messages to

princes. There was a style for poetry, one for 
treaties and contracts, one for finance, one for 
defence and so on. It was a prosperous time for 
the profession of calligrapher, which according 
to Ibn al-Habib al-Halabi had become “the 
noblest office, the best branch of knowledge 
and the most profitable estate” of the period. 
Each caliph had his accredited calligrapher, 
a confidential adviser to whom he sometimes 
cven entrusted the management of his house- 
hold. One calligrapher, Ibn Mugla (b. 886) even 
became a minister: it was he who, considering 
Kufic too heavy for a period as refined as his, 
invented a more flowing, rounded script 
(nashki), and gave it a geometrical shape to make 
it worthy of transcribing the Quran. 
Ibn Mugla’s reforms were not followed in 
the western Arab world. From Egypt to 
Andalusia, North African calligraphers, with 
their more austere artistic traditions, refused to 
give up Kufic, including the Maghribi script 
and the many variants derived from it. 
Thereafter there were two main schools of 
calligraphy, that of Ibn al-Bawwab (eleventh 
century), who improved on Ibn Mugla’s pro- 
cedures, and that of al-Musta’simi (thirteenth 
century), who improved the calamus by cut- 
ting its nib obliquely, thus giving finer upstrokes. 
Some thirty languages have used the Arabic 
alphabet. The Iranians created their own style, 
and improved many others. The Ottomans were 
the last great masters of the art of calligraphy. 
Their empire saw the introduction of the jaza, 
a qualification which entitled the holder to teach 
calligraphy. It produced some great calligra- 
phers, such as Shaikh al-Amassi in the sixteenth 
century, who adapted the various scripts for 
writing Ottoman Turkish, and Hafiz Uthman 
(seventeenth century), who brought simplicity, 
purity and grace to calligraphy. 
Nowadays, with the development of televi- 
sion and modern methods of reproduction, con- 
temporary calligraphy has lost part of its raison 
d’étre. But it still remains on the look-out for a 
new way forward, in order to advance the art of 
writing. [J 21

### 99854: An Inspired invention

 
An Inspired invention 
~ Whereas the writing revolution—the 
© linear, visual representation of specific 
spoken languages—began only 5,000 years ago, 
the use of graphic symbols to represent objects 
and ideas, and to encapsulate magical and reli- 
gious values, is almost certainly as old as arti- 
culate speech itself. 
It has sometimes been suggested that certain 
traditional African symbols, such as those used 
among the Akan-speaking peoples of Ghana, 
were inspired by Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, 
by that magnificent explosion of human writing 
which took place in northeast Africa. It is more 
probable, however, that the hieroglyphs them- 
selves drew an important part of their inspira- 
tion, 5,000 years ago, from even older tradi- 
tions of graphic symbolism in Africa itself. 
Whereas along tradition of writing seems to 
have existed northwards and eastwards of the 
Sahara and the Nile Valley, southwards stretches 
an area whose cultures are associated primarily 
with oral tradition. On the other hand, especially 
in West Africa, there are strong traditions of 
graphic symbolism and also many examples of 
the modern evolution or design of “new” indige- 
nous systems of writing. 
One of the most remarkable examples of 
the use of graphic symbols in Africa is the com- 
plex system of pictograms and ideograms known 
as Nsibidi (or Nsibiri), used traditionally in the 
Cross River area of southeast Nigeria. The 
system is known to have many usages, including 
the use of symbols in combination to record 
narratives, especially the evidence recorded in 
by David Dalby 
contentious love-affairs. Nsibidi symbols may 
be engraved on calabashes and other domestic 
objects, painted on walls, printed on cloth or tat- 
tooed or painted on the human body. They are 
not associated with any one specific language but 
are found in a multilingual area among speakers 
of Ekoi, Igbo and Ibibio. 
A curious tradition relates that the secrets of 
Nsibidi were long ago revealed to men by a 
species of large baboon called idiok. This legend 
is above all reminiscent of the divine baboon 
associated with Thoth, the patron of scribes in 
ancient Egypt. These widely separated beliefs 
about the same animal are unlikely to be pure 
coincidence, and we are left with two other pos- 
sibilities. Was this a specifically Egyptian belief 
which found its way over thousands of years and 
thousands of kilometres to eastern Nigeria, or 
was it perhaps an ancient and widely spread 
belief in Black Africa which passed to Egypt

with the knowledge of traditional graphic sym- 
bols, a vital element in the elaboration of carly 
pictographic hieroglyphs? 
Suttan Njoya's dream 
A short distance castward from the traditional 
arca of Nsibidi, across the border in German 
Cameroon, a remarkable cultural event occurred 
just a century ago. This was the progressive 
elaboration by Sultan Njoya of Foumban of an 
independent and original system of writing for 
the Bamum language. 
Like several other inventors of African 
writing systems, Njoya was inspired by a dream, 
after which he asked his subjects to draw dif- 
ferent objects and to name them. Armed with 
their results, he experimented until he had cre- 
ated his first system of writing, containing some 
466 pictographic and idecographic symbols. 
Forty years of experimentation and steady 
progress led him to the use of his final a-ku-u- 
ku syllabary, named after the first four of its 
eighty characters. 
Sultan Njoya was certainly a man of genius, 
but it was his royal position which enabled him 
to see his ideas through to completion by estab- 
lishing schools at which his subjects learned to 
read and write, claborating a system of printing 
Ra

r= 
with hand-made copper dies and compiling 
texts on the history and customs of his kingdom. 
Unfortunately Njoya’s achievements were 
doomed by the outcome of the First World War. 
Encouraged under German rule, Njoya’s schools 
were closed by the post-war colonial authorities, 
and he destroyed his own printing system in 
frustration. He was deposed in 1931 and exiled 
until his death two years later. 
A sacred script 
The history of Njoya’s system raises the possi- 
bility that the form and sudden appearance of 
Egyptian writing may be explained in a similar 
way, as the invention primarily of a single man, 
highly enough placed to have the necessary 
leisure for his task and for the result to have 
been accepted without opposition among his 
own people. 
There is no evidence of any long evolution of 
hieroglyphic writing in the beginning, and the 
progress of a single inventor could explain the 
complex structure of the Egyptian script in its 
earliest recorded form, where different stages of 
development appear already to be fused into a 
single system. 
Just as Njoya 1s known to have been 
impressed, but in no way influenced, by the 


### 99854: An Inspired invention

Arabic script, so an Egyptian inventor may have 
been stimulated by the slightly earlier invention of 
a quite different writing system in Mesopotamia. 
As in the documented cases of several indige- 
nous writing systems in West Africa, a claim 
by its inventor to divine inspiration may be 
assumed in the case of the Egyptian script also, 
and such an origin was certainly the traditional 
belief throughout the script’s history. The sacred 
and revealed nature of Egyptian writing made it 
immune to any radical restructuring for thou- 
sands of years and limited its use to an initiated 
elite. | 23

SHIRO NODA 
is a Japanese historian and 
linguist who is currently a 
lecturer in the Japanese 
department of France’s National 
Institute of Oriental Languages 
and Civilizations in Paris. The 
present article has been 
abridged and adapted from a 
fonger study. 
Although scholars still disagree about the 
origins of the Japanese language, the ori- 
gins of its notation system are less obscure. 
The notation system currently used in Japan 
is a combination of four different forms: 1) kanji 
(logograms); 2) hiragana and 3) katakana (syl- 
labograms); and 4) roman (phonograms). 
It is generally agreed that Japanese writing 
dates back to the fifth century B.C., a period 
when Chinese writing was formally introduced 
into the country through Buddhist texts. Kanji 
word signs are derived from Chinese writing, 
which was then the prerogative of the intellectual

class. It was used at the imperial court, by the civil 
service, and by Buddhist monks for reading and 
transcribing religious documents. It was not used 
by the mass of the people. 
Despite its usefulness, Chinese notation had 
one major drawback because of the basic differ- 
ence in the syntactical structure of the two lan- 
guages. It had to be adapted by giving a purely 
Japanese reading to Chinese ideograms. A reading 
system was invented for this purpose. It was 
known as kaeriten (reference mark), an allusion 
to the point put to the left of Chinese characters 
to indicate the order in which they should be

read. But kanji was hard to apply to the language 
of everyday life, and a Japanese sentence written 
in kanji seemed highly unnatural. 
The voice of letters 
This was the linguistic situation in Japan when, at 
the beginning of the Heian period (late cighth and 
early ninth centuries), the ladies of the imperial 
court invented the cursive syllabary known as 
hiragana, which consisted of signs derived from 
Chinese characters but considerably simplified 
and shaped in Japanese style. This was a crucial 
moment in the evolution of the Japanese lan- 
guage, for the invention of hiragana was not a 
mere morphological transformation of Chinese 
characters. As an ideogram, a kanji character 
could express an idea, a concept or an image, but 
hiragana added a new dimension to Japanese 
writing, namely the phonetic transcription that is 
entirely independent of the ideographic system. 
The great advantage that hiragana had over 
kanji was that it enabled the Japanese to write 
about daily life in everyday language. The inven- 
tion of hiragana encouraged the emergence of a 
purely Japanese literature, of which The Tale of 
Genji, written at the beginning of the eleventh 
century by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady of the impe- 
EAE E RS rial court, is the most famous classical example.

Simplexity 
It might be wondered why the Japanese have not 
adopted onc or another of the writing systems 
(hiragana, katakana or roman), which would 
make learning Japanese much easier, rather than 
sticking to this combination of the four. The 
answer is quite simple. The phonetic representa- 
tion systems of Japanese call for a linear approach 
that slows down the reading process and corre- 
spondingly delays understanding of the content, 
whereas the globality of the logogram means that 
it can be immediately recognized and understood 
once it has been memorized. Paradoxically then, 
the consequence of using four integrated kinds of 
writing is that the effectiveness and flexibility of 
Japanese writing is increased. The complexity of 
u 25 the system is actually a simplifying factor.

and in different places. In the Far East, the ear- 
liest known examples were intended to facilitate 
communication with the gods, whereas in the 
Middle East their main purpose was the keeping 
of accounts. At a later stage, writing was used to 
. record customary law and traditional tales for 
posterity, while as a result of its use for com- 
mercial purposes in the Middle East it was grad- 
ually simplified, finally giving rise to alphabet- 
ical systems.

by Henri-Jean Martin 
The written word has always been closely associated with power. But literacy is a stepping 
stone to intellectual freedom as well as an instrument of authority, and has heen a factor in the 
In parallel with these developments, society 
conferred extraordinary power on those who 
could write. In some parts of the world, writing 
remained the preserve of the priesthood, while 
in others, as in ancient Gaul, the priests refused 
to set down the secrets of their religion in 
writing. As a general rule, it long remained the 
speciality of scribes, a situation found in places 
as far apart as Mesopotamia, Egypt and China. 
A passport to power 
Having control over society’s collective memory 
and having been putin charge of drawing up its 
laws, scribes established themselves as counsel- 
lors to the high and mighty and as judges with 
authority over their fellow men, often creaming 
off their share of the wealth they assessed and the 
taxes they gathered. In such circumstances, the 
Romans, tired of being judged and governed 
according to rules of which they were ignorant, 
when they had learned to read and write 
demanded that the Jaws be displayed on wooden 
boards in the Capitol. 
At the time of the barbarian invasions of 
western Europe, written culture took refuge in 
the monasteries, which were anxious to pre- 
serve the sacred and liturgical texts. Much later, 
after Europe had been reshaped, writing 
emerged once more in the re-established towns, 
and the feudal warlords who had imposed their 
power were obliged to call upon the help of 
clerks, specialists in the written word who carved 
out for themselves a privileged place in the 
young states of western Europe. 
At the courts of the Renaissance princes, 
the privy counsellor or secretary played a 
prominent role, and most of the humanists 
were drawn from the papal, Florentine or other 
chancelleries, from among the learned men who 
were responsible for the drafting of diplomatic, 
legislative, legal or administrative documents. 
In France, for example, such men who had 
bought their way into office created a new social 
category, giving rise to the noblesse de robe which 
tried, not unsuccessfully, to claim for itself the 
greater part of the power and wealth of the state.

### 99856: The Power of the pen

The law of the letter 
Writing thus became an instrument of govern- 
ment, and hence of power, wielded by experts. 
Simultaneously it imposed its own rationale on 
the peoples that used it. By providing a stable 
record of custom, it had the effect, over time, of 
preventing custom from developing sponta- 
ncously as a product of the collective con- 
sciousness, as the oral tradition allowed it to 
do. It thus gradually subjected society to the 
dominance of the law. The law, for its part, had 
an author and a date, and was by definition 
written, but it was shackled by its written form 
and inevitably, with the passage of time, lost 
touch with society’s changing requirements, 
leading to continual problems of interpretation. 
Such developments were not, however, con- 
stant or inevitable. Systems of writing are still in 
usc today that maintain a more flexible relation- 
ship with the spoken language, systems that are the 
product of a combination of factors—the structure 
of the language, the innate character of each people 
and the influences to which it has been subjected 
throughout its history. Furthermore, in the West 
at least, the presentation of documents has evolved 
constantly, in keeping with changes in socicty 
and with society’s complex relationship with the 
  
spoken and written word. 
The scrolls on which Cicero’s speeches were 
copied down, for instance, contained a contin- 
uous text without spaces between words or 
paragraphs; they were meant to be read aloud 
and understood by being heard. It was not until 
the eleventh century that copyists got into the 
habit of systematically separating words. The 
thirtecenth-century Summa Theologiae of St 
Thomas Aquinas consists of dense pages, 
bristling with abbreviations and with lots of 
coloured signs appearing at intervals; set out in 
the form of an oral disputation, it is divided 
into articles proceeding from the particular to the 
general in accordance with a stercotyped pattern 
intended to keep the reasoning on the rails. 
Later, with the invention of printing, the - 
paragraph as we now know it gradually came 
into general use, with the spaces that give the cye 
and the mind a rest, helping the reader to digest 
what has just been read. It is surely no coinci- 
dence that Descartes’ Discours de la méthode 
(1637) was the first work of philosophy in 
French to be set out in the modern style. 
‘Because of these ways of presenting material 
in print, the spoken language and the written 
text—the latter now intended to be read and 
not spoken or heard—have, in the West, gradu- 27

ally drifted further and further apart. This devel- 
opment may have contributed to the comeback 
made by the image since the nineteenth cen- 
tury and the upsurge in increasingly hard-hitting 
advertising. The trend has now affected news- 
papers, which, to improve their circulation, have 
been induced to adopt an attention-grabbing 
layout intended to convey the greatest possible 
amount of information and emotion in the 
shortest possible time. 
Divide and rule 
To understand the problems arising at the 
receiving end of the writing process, we should 
begin by discarding the widespread belief that 
some types of writing are more functional than 
others. It is now generally acknowledged that lit- 
eracy above all answers a need for decompart- 
mentalization, for communication with the out- 
side world. The understanding of a text is not a 
simple matter of technique: it also requires 
readers to possess the necessary mental equip-

ment, a stock of concepts that will enable them 
to establish a personal dialogue with the text. 
One of the main effects of the emergence of 
writing was to divide people into categories, 
according to their capacities to master the 
written word. Generally speaking, it soon 
became necessary, in most societies, to be able at 
least to read, if not to write, so as to be able to 
decipher and learn the canonical texts or holy 
scriptures. The religious or civil authorities 
deemed it necessary above all to teach the rudi- 
ments of reading, i.e. a form of passive access to 
the written word. 
In Europe, for instance, children were first 
taught to recognize letters and spell out Latin 
prayers, writing being held over for a later and 
often optional stage. The effect of this method, 
applied mainly to girls (who, as a character in 
one of Moliere’s plays says, should not learn to 
write lest they should correspond with their 
lovers), was to produce social categories of semi- 
literates, who could often get to know texts 
only by reading together in groups. For similar 
reasons, it apparently was long-standing practice 
to rcad aloud or in an undertone, particularly in 
the case of women reading novels. Only those 
who belonged to the ruling classes and who 
had pursued lengthy studies in colleges or uni- 
versities were actually able to read silently to 
themselves.

Thus Western societies remained for a long 
time only very incompletely literate; some people 
have claimed, no doubt with some slight exag- 
geration, that the great revolutions occurred 
when more than half the population became lit- 
erate. It should also be borne in mind that, 
throughout history, there was never a watertight 
partition between written culture and oral tradi- 
tion. The great mass movements, such as the 
heresies of the Middle Ages, the Reformation in 
the sixteenth century, and the revolutions—in 
England in the seventeenth century, France at 
the end of the eighteenth and Russia at the begin- 
ning of the twentieth—were inspired by images, 
songs and the spoken word as much as by writing, 
People in the Middle Ages learned their reli- 
gion from the paintings on church walls. Even 
today, we need only think of the place occupied, 
in some parts of the world, by open-air 
preaching or even soap-box oratory; of topical 
songs and the stories told in the workplace or by 
the fireside; of the many contacts between lit- 
erates and “educated” people, or of the role that 
the self-taught so often play as intermediaries. It 
was through all these channels that the theories 
of such as Voltaire or Rousseau reached the rev- 
olutionary masses, who blithely claimed to have 
been inspired by these thinkers without having 
read their works. 
Lastly, in the course of the last hundred 
years, the new communications media have 
brought recorded speech and the moving image 
to the fore; but the effect of these technologies, 
unlike that of reading, is to highlight emotion 
and propaganda over a logical approach and 
individual reflection.

from the invention of the first pictograms or 
ideograms to the full transcription of specch 
through phonetic signs, has run parallel with the 
development of a logical, analytical spirit that 
gives preference, over the transience of the 
spoken word, to the written text, with all it 
implies of stability or even fixity. While itis an 
instrument of authority, writing thus also has a 
power to liberate the mind that, by the same 
token, makes it an instrument of liberation from 
that authority. |

SOME DEFINITIONS 
ALPHABET: a system of signs expressing 
the basic sounds of a language. Unlike 
scripts of pictographic origin—such as 
cuneiform or hieroglyphic scripts—bascd 
ona large number of stylized symbols, an 
alphabet reproduces at least consonant 
sounds via a small number of simplified 
symbols. After a long process of evolu- 
tion, the Phoenician alphabet of 22 letters 
took shape around 1100 B.C, and later 
spread to many cities on the Mediter- 
ranean rim. Around the 8th century B.C, 
it was adopted by the Grecks, who added 
letters for the vowels, thus making the 
world’s first complete alphabet. 
CALAMUS: a reed whittled to a point or 
bevelled and used for writing and callig- 
raphy. 
CALLIGRAM: a text, usually poctic, the 
words of which are arranged so as to form 
a decorative pattern (also known as pat- 
tern poetry). 
CODEX: to replace papyrus scrolls, which 
were awkward to handle, shects of parch- 
ment bound into the form of a book or 
codex (plural codices) first appeared in 
Rome in the 1st century A.D. Very long 
documents could be reproduced in this 
form. 
CUNEIFORM: cuneiform (“wedge- 
shaped”) script, which first appeared 
between 4000 and 3000 B.C. in 
Mesopotamia, may be the world’s oldest 
form of writing. Originally pictographic, 
its signs (about 550 derived from the per- 
mutation of 4 basic elements) gradually 
came to have syilabic values, e¢nabling 
phonemes as well as objects to be desig- 
nated. This process was accompanied by 
a reduction in the number of signs and a 
simplification of their forms, leading even- 
tually to the creation, in Phoenicia, of the 
first alphabet. 
GLYPH: a writing sign incised or carved on 
materials such as stone, as in pre- 
Columbian civilizations. 
HIEROGLYPHIC: Egyptian pictographic 
or figurative writing used as early as the 
4th millennium B.C,, in which cach hiero- 
glyph or sign (among some 700) repre- 
sented an object. Idcograms were also 
uscd to express certain ideas, and phono- 
grams to render sounds. A strikingly suc- 
cessful usc of hicroglyphs (etymological 
meaning = “writing of the gods”) was for 
monumental inscriptions. 
ICON: a sign that imitates the object it 
describes, e.g. the drawing of a house to 
represent a house. 
IDEOGRAM: the representation of a mes- 
sage or an idea by means of drawings, in 
some cases schematic and symbolic. Sev- 
eral varictics of idcographic writing are 
known, including cunciform, Egyptian 
hicroglyphics and Chinese. 
PHONEME: a unit of spoken speech 
(vowel or consonant). 
PHONOGRAM: a sign or part of a sign 
representing a word, a syllable or a 
phoneme. The basis of alphabetical 
writing, the signs of which represent only 
sounds. 
PICTOGRAM (OR PICTOGRAPH): an clc- 
ment in writing that represents an object 
by means of stylized signs or symbols. 
Each pictogram has a specific use, but an 
abstract idea may be expressed by com- 
bining several of them. The first stage in 
writing.

The sight of this starving 
child pains me/Like a great 
thorn”, wrote that giant of Spanish 
poetry Miguel Hernindez. What 
would he write today if he knew 
that only a few months ago a radio 
station in Rwanda was broad- 
casting messages urging the 
murder of children, or if he had 
seen the television pictures of 
corpses with hands tied behind 
their backs floating in the waters of 
Lake Victoria? He would say that 
a society which tolerates the intolerable is a society in 
decline. He would say that intellectuals should show 
their indignation, not just by speaking out, but, above 
all, by taking action so that such events can never 
happen again. 
Since the end of the Cold War and the decline of 
the Soviet regime, long-standing conflicts have re- 
emerged and new ones rooted in national, cultural, 
ethnic and socio-economic differences are erupting 
into violence. 
Itis a good moment to repeat that a war is never 
won. Never mind that history books tell us the 
opposite. The psychological and material costs of 
war are so high that any triumph is a Pyrrhic victory. 
Only peace can be won and winning peace means not 
only avoiding armed conflict but finding ways of 
eradicating the causes of individual and collective 
violence: injustice and oppression, ignorance and 
poverty, intolerance and discrimination. We must 
construct a new set of values and attitudes to replace 
the culture of war which, for centuries, has been 
influencing the course of civilization. Winning peace 
means the triumph of our pledge to establish, on a 
democratic basis, a new social framework of tolerance

A colossus with feet of clay 
gives grounds for hope that pandemic diseases such 
as Aids and cancer may be eliminated. The spec- 
tacular development of the media provides new 
opportunities for education and culture. Com- 
puters and fibre optics have brought a new dimen- 
sion, unthinkable until recently, to the organization 
and dissemination of knowledge and to data pro- 
cessing and resource management. 
And yet this world so rich in resources, knowl- 
edge and experience, shaped by the most progressive 
and dynamic societies ever known, is extremely 
vulnerable. As in the biblical dream of king Neb- 
uchadnezzar, we stand before a colossus made of 
precious metal but with feet of clay. An exclusively 
quantitative view of progress and an obstinate atti- 
tude of consumerism and wastefulness are daily 
creating an ever-widening gap between a minority 
which enjoys the benefits of progress and the 
immense majority of the world’s inhabitants, for 
whom well-being and a minimum standard of living 
still seem a distant mirage. 
A precarious balance 
At atime when the Western countries are entering 
the age of “information superhighways”, there are 
around the world 600,000 human settlements 
without electricity. At a time when the industrial- 
ized countries of the North have millions of uni- 
versity-educated men and women unable to find 
employment, the countries of the South are home 
to 900 million illiterate people, often working in 
subhuman conditions. 
As long as this breach widens, life on our planet 
will become ever more precarious. For the same sci- 
entific and technological development that made 
possible the opulent life-style of the industrialized 
North has also brought the world together in a dra- 
matic fashion, Today more than ever, the world is one. 
The drought or war that leads to an exodus from an 
African country also affects its European neigh- 
bours, further complicating the economic crisis and 
compounding the problem of unemployment by 
that of massive and uncontrolled emigration. How- 
ever, the reverse is also true: an economic crisis which 
destroys an industry in North America or Australia 
may leave a South American peasant or a Central 
Asian miner without the means of subsistence.

ronment knows no frontiers. 
UNESCO is endeavouring by various means 
to stimulate debate and encourage the search for 
solutions that will reverse those trends, reduce the 
growing disparity between the standard of living of 
the industrialized North and the developing South, 
foster scientific and cultural creativity and pro- 
mote peace. 
Unfortunately, our society is still shaped, essen- 
tially, by the culture of war. The production appa- 
ratus of the modern world is closely linked to the 
military machine. Now that the Cold War is over 
and democratic trends are providing us with addi- 
tional safeguards of international peace, we realize 
that we are not prepared to confront the most 
serious and urgent dangers which threaten the 
future of our civilization. We are prepared for the 
past; we are not prepared for the present. 
Events after 1989 were expected to bring about 
a re-evaluation of the concepts of defence and secu- 
rity throughout the world. Yet the conceptual re- 
evaluation has not thus far led to any significant 
reduction in defence spending. The much-touted 
and eagerly awaited “peace dividend” has failed to 
result in massive investments in education, public 
health or aid to developing countries and other sec- 
tors where public action is urgently needed. 
The view of progress and development that has 
prevailed until very recently is in need of a thor- 
ough overhaul: the idea that development is little 
more than growth, and that raising industrial pro- 
duction indexes and boosting the consumption of 
electricity is enough to modernize a country and 
provide a better future for its people. This mistaken 
belief results in the imposition from outside of devel- 
opment models which fail to take due account of 
the historical, cultural and psychological particu- 
larities of the people to whom they are applied. One 
consequence of this approach is the enormous mate- 
rial and emotional price paid by many countries 
which have been obliged by international financial 
institutions to implement economic structural adjust- 
ment policies. 
The crucial question facing us today is who 
will reap the benefit of development. Are our

efforts directed towards the men and women of 
tomorrow, the generations who will inherit the 
earth, or are we acting to satisfy short-sighted 
economic interests or crude ambitions of power? At 
the beginning of this century, another Spanish 
poet, Miguel de Unamuno, was already vigorously 
criticizing this conception of progress. “We must 
produce,” he wrote, “produce as much as possible 
in all fields at the least cost, and then let the human 
species collapse at the foot of the monumental 
tower of Babel, overburdened with goods, 
machines, books, paintings, statues, tokens of 
worldly glory and history!” 
The consumerist Tower of Babel 
Above all let us not yield to the siren song of unre- 
strained consumption. Having freed ourselves from 
communism, we must now liberate ourselves from 
consumerism. The idea that consumption can expand 
indefinitely is untenable. The risk of exhausting non- 
renewable resources, the need to avoid pollution and 
environmental degradation, and the threats to the 
ozone layer, to biological diversity, to the health and 
well-being of future generations and to the natural 
and cultural heritage of humankind are the strongest 
arguments against any fantasy of unlimited con- 
sumption for the next century. 
It is essential to counter that mirage with a vision 
of all-round, sustainable development, having due 
regard for the environment, consumption based on

quality and not on quantity, and a rehabilitation of 
spiritual values which will help reorder our priori- 
ties and which must necessarily lead to frugality 
and ecological restraint. In the coming decades, 
quality of life will be increasingly bound up with 
austerity and a responsible attitude towards the 
environment. 
Nebuchadnezzar’s dream ends as follows: “A 
fallen stone, not thrown by anyone, struck the 
statue on its feet of clay, and destroyed it”. Our civ- 
lization, this highly complex machine, with its 
extraordinary achievements in such diverse realms 
as the arts, science, industry and culture, is like 
the biblical colossus. If we fail to correct properly 
the imbalances which threaten it, if we fail to 
achieve harmony among all peoples in a frame- 
work of justice and dignity, if we are not capable of 
leaving a habitable planet to future generations, 
then we shall become daily more like a statue with 
feet of clay, at the mercy of a pebble hurled at us by 
blind fate. N

Perched 3,000 metres up in the high plateaux of the

Heritage List.

nce upon a time a Spanish 
hidalgo is supposed to have said 
to his architect: “Draw me the 
plans for a big square patio with a few 
rooms around it.” Even today, in the his- 
torte centre of Quito and on the outskirts 
of the old city, there arc still some low, 
white houses of this kind, their red tiles 
darkened by time. Each one has a wood 
and wrought-iron gate opening onto a 
large inner courtyard where grey paving 
stones and inlaid yellow ox-bones form 
gcometric motifs aronnd a fountain. The 
“master of the great house” would ride 
into the courtyard on horseback, and his 
tenants would unload the farm produce 
they had brought on mules or carts. 
Around the patio were rooms with barred 
windows. Here, at dusk, came girls 
seeking to escape the tedium of their 
secluded hives or be serenaded by their 
official suitors. 
I is hard to say whether this type of 
architecture sprang from or gave rise to 
a specific conception of urban plan- 
ning. What is certain is that the con- 
quistadors were instinctive if untutored 
town-planners and that here as in all 
other Ameriean cities they first marked 
out a central patio-like square around 
which they built a church, a governor’s 
residence, an archbishop’s palace and 
a town hall. Then, after the land had 
been divided between the conquista- 
dors and the religious authorities, they

original names: the Street of Forges, 
the Jewellers’ Street, the Street of the 
Seven Crosses; the THll of Sighs, the

Souls, of the Virgin, of the Toad. These 
narrow streets were intended for horses 
and earriages—no vehicle could even 
enter the Street of the Night Watch, a 
winding alley lit with ancient lanterns— 
and the buses that pass through them 
today almost scrape the walls. 
From the eity centre to the suburbs 
narrow streets lined with little houses

the slow rhythm, the sense of time to 
spare that made Henri Michaux say: 
“Ilere we all smoke the opium of high 
altitude, speak in low voices, take short 
steps, are short of breath. The dogs 
fight little, and so do the children; there 
is little laughter”? 
A mayor of Quito once decided that 
the walls of the houses should be 
painted white and the woodwork of 
doors and windows blue, with the 
result that the city came to resemble (in 
this respect only) certain Mediter- 
ranean towns. Then someone remem- 
bered that in the eighteenth century 
the main buildings in the city centre 
had had coloured facades (in 1757 a 
traveller noted that “Facades white- 
washed [ron top to bottom in gandy 
colours are not rare”) and so they were 
repainted yellow, green or blue. In the 
modern public bmldings in the resi- 
dential area in the north of the eity on 
the other hand, the dominant colour is 
the grey of conerete and the smoked 
class windows that protect against the 
bright sunlight which—because the sky 
is so near?—is unlike that found any- 
where else in the world. 35

SYMBOLS OF POWER 
Plaza Mayor, also known as Plaza dela 
Independencia—Dbecause of the inde- 
pendence monument put up there in 
1906—or simply as Plaza Grande, is 
the symbol of the life of the city. This 
place where people met to exchange 
political gossip and rumours, to show 
dissension, to [cteh water, listen to a 
band or be photographed, is freer, 
more open and peaceful than it once 
was. The prison-like iron railings that 
once surrounded it have heen removed 
and its [ountains have gone; it has heen 
beantified with {lower beds and benches 
for the retired and the nnoceupied. 
On one side of the square is the 
cathedral. Originally a modest wattle 
and daub construction, it has con- 
stantly been extended and embellished 
since the sixteenth: century. Its coffered 
ceiling, the copy of a Spanish Moorish 
original, dates from the mid-nineteenth 
century. The “cinderella of American 
cathedrals” in comparison with those of 
Mexico or Lima, it has wonderful gilt 
altars on a par with those of otlier Quito 
churches, whose insolent splendour 
overwhelms the visitor and contrasts 
with the poverty of the (aith{ul and the 
wretchedness of the beggars at their 
gates. 
Opposite the cathedral, symbol of 
divine power, is the archbishop’s 
palace, the encapsulation of ceclesias- 
tical power. Two dates, 1852 and 1920, 
are inscribed in Roman fignres on its 
facade. A surprising featnre of this nco- 
classical building is a loggia on its upper 
storey whose symmetrical columns are 
joined by a balustrade and surmounted 
at cach end by a triangular pediment. 
The governor’s palace is equally neo- 
classical. Inside, on cach side of a mon- 
umental staircase, is another patio. Its 
facade is adorned with a massive doric 
eolonnade giving onto the square and 
two lateral structures surmounted by 
triangular tympani. Inaugurated in 
1830 when the Republic was pro- 
claimed, it was the last architectural

The building which has had the most 
checquered career is the municipal

land belonging to the king” in 1538—a 
rough-and-ready town hall for a city 
bursting at the seams with gold. It was 
rebuilt many times before being demol-

expulsion of the Indian and mestizo 
women who sold rag dolls, ribbons, 
buttons, crocheting hooks and knitting 
needles at the entrance, and were a 
familiar feature of the Quito landseape. 
Today, only five of them are left and 
they have moved to the entrance to the 
Plaza de Santo Domingo. On the Plaza 
Grande they were for a time replaced 
by itinerant vendors of smuggled 
watches, cigarette lighters, spectacles 
and personal stereos, and hawkers of 
cigarettes, chewing gum, razor blades 
and lottery tickets. 
AN ASSORTMENT OF 
ARCHITECTURAL STYLES 
Around the turn of the century, a 
number of buildings in a variety of 
styles were constructed around the 
Plaza Grande: the old university, a 
bank whieh is no longer a bank, a hotel 
which used to boast of offering its cus- 
tomers the opportunity to see parades, 
processions and revolutions “from their 
bed”. The hotel is an example of what 
might be called architectural esperanto: 
cach ol its storeys is built in a different 
style to produce what has been called “a 
highly interesting picce of eclecticism”. 
In Garcia Moreno street, once the 
street of the seven crosses, an assort- 
ment of civil and military architecture 
spanning the sixteenth and the twen- 
ticth centuries—arches, columns, 
vestibules, porticos—is concentrated 
into barely 200 metres. Religious archi- 
tecture is represented by the churches 
of the Sagrario, La Compaiiia de Jesis 
and San Francisco. All of them house 
paintings, sculptures   art treasures 
and gold leaf of the celebrated Quito 
school, works by indigenous artists such 
as Caspicara and Pampite and mestizo 
artists such as Miguel de Santiago who 
have been compared with Zurbaran. 
The church of San Francisco and 
its adjoining eonvent occupy three 
hectares in the centre of Quito. They 
have been dubbed “an Eseurial in the 
Andes”, although their construction 
began before that of the Escurial in 
Spain—Dbarely fifty days alter the [oun- 
dation of Quito by the Spaniards on 6 
December 1535. tis said that the fore- 
court was completed in a single niglit by 
the devil in order to gather in a tor- 
mented soul who was cluding lis grasp. 
The work took so long, and the Fran- 
ciscans asked Charles V for so much 
money to build the towers, that the 
emperor emerged every evening onto 
the balcony of his palace in Toledo, 
convinced that lic would he able to sce

reduced to rubble by an carthquake. 
On the chureh’s curious perron of 
concentrie semi-circular steps all kinds 
of spin-off of faith are for sale: incense, 
medallions, saered images, decorated 
candles. And on the vast square, where 
until the beginning of the century water 
carriers {illed their buckets at the loun- 
tain with water to sell from door to 
door, all kinds of people come and go, 
including the Indians whom Michaux 
saw, “thiek-set, broad-headed, walking 
with short steps”, wrapped in blue, red 
or grey ponchos and carrying on their 
backs a refrigerator or a cupboard 
roped to their forchead. On Good 
Friday this is the culminating point for 
a procession of hooded figures who fla- 
rellate themselves with thongs and 
chains, a form of penitence not uncon- 
nceted with masochistic exhibitionism.

the anonymous mountains which form

exodus colonize the hitherto bare slopes. 
It is true that tunnels, jerry-built 
mini-expressways, level and unlevel 
crossings, supermarkets, ministries and 
impersonal hotels have been built, but 
only in the residential north, a city 
apart which has nothing in common 
with that which UNESCO has proclaimed 
part of the “universal heritage of 
mankind” except its proximity to the 
mountains. Quito obstinately refuses 
any kind of modernization, as if wishing 
to continue to merit the titles of “Flo-

“Quito, ante-chamber of paradise”, 
“Quito two steps away from heaven”

In one film a gangster dreams of doing 
one last job before retiring to Quito, 
“where you can touch the stars with 
your hand”. Quito has also been called 
“the face of God”. Perhaps, but if so it 
is a sombre face, like that of the skinny 
girls, shivering witlu cold at night, glued 
to the doors of restaurants and offering 
diners and passersby flowers which are 
as sad as they are and which, like them, 
have faded too quiekly. |

“Entwined lovers”, a 17th-century Persian miniature. 
irza Mohammad-Ali, also 
known as Sa’eb of Tabriz, is 
one of the most brilliant post- 
classical Persian pocts. lle was born in 
Isfahan, then the capital of the Persian 
empire, in 1607 (400 years ago according 
to the Islamic calendar) into a family of 
merchants from Tabriz who had trav- 
elled to Isfahan in search of fame and 
fortune. At the age of twenty, already a 
competent prose writer and calligrapher, 
he began to make his mark as a poet. 
lle may have inherited his early taste 
for poetry from one of his ancestors, 
Shams-¢-Magrebi, a mystie poet of the 
fourteenth century. 
Sa’eb began to attend court but was 
disappointed by the aunosphere there. 
Torn by centuries of dissension and inva- 
sions, Persia was beginning to regain its 
coliesion under the iron hand of the 
Safavids. But the rulers of this new 
dynasty began to impose the Shi'ite faith 
on the Iranian people, causing social dis- 
ruption which led numerous intellectuals 
to {lee from Isfahan, where theologians 
held sway and made no attempt to hide 
their fierce hostility to poets, philoso- 
phers and mysties. Si’eb described the 
situation in one of liis poems, when he 
wrote: “Today intelligence and reason 
hardly count any more; it is an age of 
turbans and well-filled bellies”. 


### 99864: Sâeb of Tabriz: prince of poets

SAEB OF TABRIZ 
prince of poets 
As a result of this, S4’cb left Persia 
for India. On the way le stayed for three 
years with a fellow poet, Zafar Khan, 
the governor of Kabul. When he arrived 
in India he entered the service of the 
Mughul emperor, Shahjahin, who was a 
great admirer of Persian literature and 
entertained him with lavish hospitality. 
Ile also received a warm welcome from 
the other court poets, who admired his 
style of writing. 
In 1633, his father joined him and 
persuaded him to return home. Back in 
Isfahan, where he lived until his death in 
1675, he was given the title “Prince of 
poets” by Shah Abbas IT and alternated 
between life at court and periods of iso- 
lation and retreat. He wrote many pan- 
egyrics and a historical epic in honour of 
the king, but mainly worked in the lyrical 
vein of love poetry known as ghazal— 
short, elegantly written poems that 
brought him fame and ensured his place 
in posterity. 
AN ENIGMATIC FIGURE 
Sa’eb was the most celebrated poet ol his 
day. Ilis contemporaries read all his 
poems they could get their hands on, 
and yet he complained that he was unap- 
preeiated and misunderstood. Ile was, 
and remains, an enigmatic figure. In 
spite of his great reputation in central 
Asia and India, the literary erities 
largely ignored him, and many of his 
poems were not published, although he 
was rightly considered one of the mas- 
ters of the “Indian style” in Persian 
poetry. A hallinark of his style was his 
investigation of subtle ideas and his 
sometimes immoderate taste for com- 
plicated rhetorical figures. He loved to 
frequent tea honses, where he was 
admired by down-to-earth people who 
(quoted so often from liis poems that they 
heecaine well-known sayings. le eould 
by Hossein Esmaili 
not stand the literary scholars who helit- 
tled him for his lack of rigour and his 
vocabulary larded with popular expres- 
sions. 
Sa’ch was a complete poet, a man 
who saw the world only through the 
prism of poetry. Unlike his predcces- 
sors, who went in for exotic and obscure 
metaphors, he was interested in the most 
trivial details of daily life and con- 
structed his literary world out of hum- 
drum actions and events. Ile used poetic 
subjectivity to adorn reality with the 
colours of dreams, to give it rhythm and 
elegance. For Si’eb everything has 
meaning and poetry: the gentle murmur 
of running water evokes the impercep- 
tible passage of time; the ancient tree 
whose roots stretch into the bowels of 
the earth suggests that an eld man clings 
to life with more determination than a 
young one; the bread that is easily 
removed from a eokd oven illustrates 
how easy it is to free oneself from a world 
without warmth. 
Sa’eh’s constant association of mirror 
images and ideas is ideally suited to Per- 
sian poetry, in which the two lines of a 
couplet complement or contradict each 
other. Sa’eb’s art breaks reality down 
into a multitude of poetic images and 
can he compared to the work of a minia- 
turist who builds up a scene from a 
crowd of tiny shapes. 
The [our-hundredth anniversary of 
the birth of the “Prince of poets” is an 
opportunity to rediscover his exquisite 
works and to shed new light on an orig- 
inal and elegant [orm of poetry that is 
still not widely known. |

he Omanis like to claim that 
after Singapore theirs is the 
cleanest country in the workd. 
It is certainly spotless. At the air- 
port, the grey marble floor shines 
like a mirror. Not a scrap of waste 
paper or speck of dust can he seen. 
Parked ontside are gleaming cars. 
A determined effort to keep Onan 
clean is backed up by radio and 
TV messages and enforced by hefty 
fines ($100 or thereabouts for a 
dirty car or a cigarette butt thrown 
from a window), while an army of 
sweepers in orange uniforms work 
night and day on the roads, picking 
up any rubbish that might, in spite 
of all the precautions, have fallen by 
the wayside. Even out in the desert 
rubbish bins—white-painted for- 
mer oil jerrycans bearing the name 
of the nearest town—are emptied at 
regular intervals. The eapital, 
Museat, stretches for kilometres 
along the coast and is made up of 
white houscs built in the approved 
Arab style, surrounded by trees 
and {lowers. Water tanks, aerials 
and air-conditioners are hidden 
from view by variants of the wooden 
screens that are typical of the Arab 
world. 
Oman is about the size of the 
British Isles and has a population 
of almost 2 million. It has a very 
wide spectrum of landscapes and 
soils. Covering 300,000 square 
kilometres on the southeastern 
tip of the Arabian Peninsula, it is 
bordered on the north and west

by the United Arab Emirates and 
Saudi Arabia and on the south- 
west by Yemen. The coastline 
stretches 1,700 kilometres {rom 
the Strait of Hormuz, along the 
Gulf of Oman to the Arabian sea. 
The eountry’s northern tip, 
Musandam, is a rocky peninsula 
indented by fjord-like coves. 
There is a fertile coastal plain 
(the Batinah), a mountain range 
(Jabal al-Akhdar) that rises to 
3,000 metres, and vast stretches 
of desert. 
SLAKING THE SULTANATE’S 
THIRST 
Although heavy monsoon rains 
fall on the Dhofar in the south 
from June to September, the chi- 
mate in the hinterland is dry and 
hot with annual rainfall no more 
than 100 mm. However, down- 
pours may be so violent that the 
rivers (wadi). which are usually 
dry, overflow their banks and 
sweep everything before them. 
Water is a major preoecupa- 
tion for the Omani government. 
In March 1994, for example, the 
Minister for Water Llesources 
sounded the alarm about steeply 
rising consumption. The restric- 
 
tions are not felt in Museat, 
which is supplied by a sea-water 
desalination plant, but between 
May and August (when tempera- 
tures hit 43°C in the shade) agri- 
culture consumes 100 million 
cubic metres per month, i.e. 94 
per eent of total consumption. 
According to the Minister, 80 per 
cent of the rainwater is lost to 
run-off into the sea, and 5 per 
cent to evaporation. In 1985 a 
recharge dam was built near 
Muscat to collect rainwater des- 
cending from the mountains. 
Five more have been built since 
then, and some fifty more are 
scheduled to be built in the next 
few years. 
To prevent groundwater | 
reserves from being exhausted, | 
irrigation wells cannot be drilled | 
without government permission. 
The number of requests is alar- | 
ming—9,090 in three years, 6,305 
of which have been approved, 
bringing the total number of wells 
to 167,000. This is worrying 
because reserves of {fossil water, 
so called because it dates from 
ancient times when there was 
more rain in the region, are not 
being replenished in today’s arid 
climate. The less used the better,

although reserves are estimated 
at 955 million m® and research is 
going on to determine whether 
there is any groundwater at 
deeper levels. Forty-nine field 
teams tour the country to check 
well registration, record well cha- 
racteristics and take samples of 
the water to assess its quality. 
The data are entered into a data- 
base from which statistics and 
maps can be compiled. The wells 
must not be too close to the sea 
because of the risk of intrusion 
by sea water. Date palms in the 
Batinah have a limited toleration 
of brackish water and have been 
dying off.

KING SOLOMON’S WELLS 
Water management in Oman is 
not a recent invention. A remar- 
kable system of irrigation chan- 
nels, known as falaj, was esta- 
blished about 2,500 years ago 
and 1s still in perfect working 
order today. Legend has it that 
Solomon, King David’s son, 
came to Oman on a magie carpet 
with his djinn—spirits who 
could assume human or animal 
Wadi el-Khalil, in the 
eastern Hajar 
mountains between 
Muscat and Sur.

(“The Green 
Mountain"). 
  
form—and built 10,000 chan- 
nels in ten days. Water is tapped 
at the water table in the moun- 
tains and flows to the plains 
along man-made tunnels from 
three to ten kilometres long, 
Every 150 metres smaller wells 
have been dug into the tunnel to 
facilitate inspection. Where the 
tunnel emerges from the rock 
the watercourse divides into a 
series of narrow channels, some 
made of concrete. Ancient docu- 
ments explain the water distri- 
bution system. Some 200 land- 
owners have permanent right of 
access to a water channel, and 
many more enjoy temporary 
rights. A flow of forty-five litres 
per second irrigates forty hec- 
tares and serves about 1,000 
people. A breach is made in the 
earth walls that surround each 
field, and closed when sufficient 
water has flowed through. Then 
the process is repeated for the 
next field. The same irrigation 
system is used in Iran, China 
and, oddly enough, in the 
Valais, the Swiss part of the 
upper Rhone Valley. 
The small black fish wrig- 
gling in the falaj act as garbage 
collectors. Unfortunately, they 
do not touch the larvae of the 
anopheles, the mosquitos that 
carry the parasite responsible 
for malaria. In 1990 a pro- 
gramme to eradicate malaria 
was launched in lbra, 100 kilo- 
metres south of Muscat. At the 
time there were 4,419 recorded 
cases of falciparum, the most   
virulent form of the disease. 
Today there are a mere forty 
cases. The task is enormous, for 
it involves monitoring a zone 
representing 12 per cent of the 
country’s area and inhabited by 
250,000 people. The area was 
divided up into 4-km? districts, 
each of which was sprayed daily 
with Temefosum, an insecticide 
that is non-toxic to humans and 
the environment. The insecticide 
is sprayed wherever the ano- 
pheles are likely to reproduce, 
in wadis, watercourses, wells 
and tanks. The results have 
been spectacular. 
THE RETURN OF 
THE WHITE ORYX 
The reintroduction of the white 
oryx, sponsored by the World 
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 
is another environmental suceess 
story. Sultan Qaboos imported 
from zoos in the United States 
several couples of this long- 
horned African antelope that 
had been hunted to extinction, 
and they have since prospered. 
The sanctuary where they live 
has recently been added to 
UnEsco’s World Heritage List. 
Five species of turtle studied 
by WWF and the World Conser- 
vation Union (IUCN) over the 
past twelve years have not fared 
so well. Wolves, foxes, gulls, 
ravens, ghost crabs, carnivorous 
fish, seabirds and local people 
are all enamoured of their flesh 
and eggs. Human consumption is

existed for 7,000 years hut it 
must be vigorously resisted if 
hawksbill and green turtles are 
to be saved from extinction. 
Another problem facing 
Oman is that of coastal pollution. 
IUCN representative Rodney 
Salm spent seven years from 1984 
to 1992 working on a coastal zone 
management programme for the 
Sultanate. is reports warn 
against oil and tar pollution on 
the beaches, partly due to illegal 
discharge of oil by ships at sea, 
the mining of sand for building, 
encroaching new roads, rotting 
{ish refuse and the dumping of 
waste. The migratory birds for 
which Oman is justly famous may 
no longer be able to alight on the 
recd-bordered lagoons, for seven 
of the seventeen sites are 
seriously threatened. Corals, 
some species of which are unique, 
are being damaged by fishing 
nets, anchors and litter such as 
plastic bags and empty paint tins. 
The Ministry of Regional 
Municipalities and Environment 
is taking the situation in hand. A 
royal decree on the eonservation 
of the environment and the pre- 
vention of pollution was promul- 
gated in 1982. In 1993 the 
ministry published a booklet 
tracing twenty-three years of 
action in response to these pro- 
blems. In answer to marine pol-

THREATS TO ZAIRE'S 
VIRUNGA PARK 
The Pan African News Agency (PANA) reports 
that the vast, 790,000-hectare Virunga (Vol- 
canoes) National Park in eastern Zaire is feeling 
the after-effects of the civil war in Rwanda. 
Almost two million Rwandans have taken refuge 
in Goma, about 50 kilometres from the Park. 
Last June almost a million poachers were taking 
between 410 and 770 tons of forest products 
(especially fuelwood) from the Park each day. By 
early November, nearly 300 km? had been 
either partially or totally deforested. In 1989 
there were 23,000 hippopotamuses in the 
Park; today only 11,000 are left. The Park has 
been on the World Heritage List since 1979, but 
in 1994 Unesco was obliged to transfer it to the 
List of World Heritage in Danger. = 
TRUNK PARALYSIS 
AFFLICTS ZIMBABWE'S 
ELEPHANTS 
PANA reports from Harare (Zimbabwe) that spe- 
cialists are trying to find the cause of a mys- 
terious disease that has afflicted elephants in 
the country during the past few years. The ail- 
ment, known as Flaccid Trunk Paralysis (FTP), 
makes it painful for the pachyderms to raise 
their trunks, thus to eat properly. It may be 
caused by lead poisoning, toxic wastes such as 
used batteries, or perhaps the pollution caused 
by motor boats. Although the syndrome first 
appeared on Fothergill Island, a tourist centre 
in the north of the country, twelve cases were 
reported in July 1994 in the Matusadonha 
area, far from the island. =

A MODEL bump 
At Champteussé-sur-Baconne in France's Loire 
valley, toxic waste is being dumped on a 40- 
hectare site which is a model of its kind. The 
25,000 tons of waste that arrive annually are 
sorted and loaded into polyethylene sacks 
before being placed in deep honey-comb-shaped 
holes excavated in the clay soil. The holes are 
lined with “geomembranes”—high-density poly- 
ethylene tarpaulins and geotextiles such as 
felt. Rainwater is collected in pipes, regularly 
analysed, and when necessary channeled into 
a purification plant. French law requires that 
each region of the country should have a class- 
1 dump, designed to receive the most highly 
toxic wastes. However, no new dump has been 
opened for the past 12 years, whereas from 2 
to 6 milllion tons of toxic wastes are produced 
  
annually. |

The world's leading manufacturer of electricity- 
generating wind turbines, Denmark has around 
4,000 of them currently in operation, sup- 
plying almost 3% of the country’s electricity, i.e. 
roughly half the capacity of & nuclear power 
plant. One reason for the growing number of tur- 
bines is that people who invest in them enjoy 
tax relief. As the windiest sites on land are 
starting to become saturated, the Danes are 
now building off-shore turbines. They cost 
more, but the sea breeze is an inexhaustible 
resource. la

T Studies (IUED) in Geneva 
(Switzerland) was founded in 
1961 by the Canton of Geneva as a 
centre for African students and for 
research and discussion on Third 
World issues. Since then its activities 
have expanded considerably to pro-

opment and access to the latest 
research, especially in health care. 
Today the Institute has a library eon- 
taining more than 50,000 volumes, a 
periodicals service with 1,100 jour- 
nals, and a documentation centre 
with 1,200 information dossiers filed 
by country, subject and institution. 
The Institute provides teaching 
via lectures, seminars and modules 
leading to a diploma in advanced 
studies, a research diploma or a doc- 
torate. The students arc from Italy, 
Romania, Finland, Benin, Senegal, 
China and the Philippines, as well as 
from Switzerland. The Institute helps 
then to draw up development pro- 
jects and to find their bearings when 
they go into the field. 
A Studies and Projects Service 
provides follow-up to ensure that 
the Institute’s operational contracts

### 99866: An International debate on literature today and tomorrow

An international debate 
on literature today and tomorrow 
LATIN AMERICA: 
GOING FOR BAROQUE 
A meeting on “The dynamic role of the 
Latin American and Caribbean literatures 
in world literature”, held in Brasilia from 
18 to 21 April 1988, was attended by sev- 
eral hundred writers and intellectuals {rom 
sixteen countries in the region. 
The participants were particularly 
struck by the way in whieh urban themes 
have taken the place of rural subjects. 
Rampant urbanization has brought a 
change of perspective and sensibility to 
the Latin American novel. Instead of the 
compassionate but distant treatment of 
indigenous people found in the socially 
committed “peasant novel”, the “urban 
novel” presents a picture of the indige- 
nous condition viewed from within. The 
description of the urban landscape, or 
rather its reereation in a work of literature, 
is one of the triumphs of this genre. 
Ilowever, Nature is intensely present 
and lends itself to symbolization ol such 
Inxuriance that European languages col- 
lapse under the strain. Some people have 
even wondered whether they should not 
be regarded as dead languages. But this 
would be a mistake because Latin Amer- 
ican writers enrich these languages and 
adapt them to their world by drawing on 
oral and dialect sources. Thus their works 
are receptive to indigenous myths and the 
indigenous imagination, which reach the 
contemporary world via the written word. 
Life in the New World, as depicted in 
Latin Ameriean novels, appears [antastie 
Lo readers of other continents, and French 
critics have coined the term “magic 
realism” to describe this kind of fiction. 
The writers themselves seem to prefer the 
adjective baroque, which deseribes more 
accurately the social and cultural dispar- 
ities they deal with, Caught betweeen 
Utopia and llistory, a prey to parody and 
dizzying absurdity, the protagonist of the 
Latin Ameriean novel bears within him a 
notion of identity rooted in anguish and 
division, where the dream of the Indian 
meets, contradicts, opposes 
ses—the dream of the immigrant.

AFRICA: NEW FORMS 
OF EXPRESSION 
Four years later, a meeting held in ITarare 
(Zimbabwe) from 10 to 13 Febrmary 1992 
was the occasion for a discussion of similar 
themes in African literature: the force of 
myth and Nature, a sensibility dominated by 
the supernatural, and the problem of vehic- 
ular languages inherited from colonialism. 
A Western language, because it is so 
widely spoken, gives writers access to the 
contemporary world and au opportunity to 
reach a wider andience. On the other hand, 
it distances them from the vernaeular reader 
and still bears the imprint of the colonial 
past. As for national languages, they have 
proved intractable vehicles for expressing 
modern attitudes and remain a prisoner of 
the tradition whose niyths they perpetuate. 
Caught between the two, new African soci- 
eties find themselves deprived of a means of 
expression; their literature abonmds in fic- 
tional heroes too far removed (rom reality, 
The transition fron a eulture of oral 
tradition to a culture of the written word 
has given rise to a number of serious prob- 
lems. Batit also bears the seed of a new lit- 
erature in which, once the traces of the 
colonial past have been identified, modern 
social values can finally be integrated and 
expressed. 
The discussions constantly returned to 
the subject of the writer’s eommitment and 
to eommitted literature. If writers should 
observe and express social conflicts, they 
should also be able to communicate the 
message of progress without sacrificing the 
aesthetie quality of their work, 
In their conclusions, the participants 
expressed their satisfaction over the place 
won for itself by African literature, which 
has asserted its own identity, linked espe- 
cially to oral tradition, within English, 
Freneli and Portuguese literatures, whose 
languages it borrows, Nevertheless, this 
young literature has not yet succeeded in 
reconciling the ancient values of the con- 
tinent with the intellectual and aesthetic 
forms inherited from the West.

ASIA: TURNING AWAY 
FROM MODERNISM? 
For Asian writers, invited to Seoul in 1992, 
the central question was that of tradition. 
Far removed from the passions and eon- 
cerns which had dominated the meetings in 
Brasilia and Harare, the participants 
emphasized moderation as an aesthetic 
and intellectual virtne as well as a political 
quality, and regarded originality as being 
in bad taste, even a moral flaw, inimical to 
the harmony that literature should express. 
Only tradition and culture, the eommu- 
nity and its values, were considered 
capable of responding to the anguish 
caused by the questioning of values 
imported from the West, in particular the 
myth of Progress. If the colonial past con- 
tinues to haunt the mind and the imagina- 
tion, it is only because it constitutes a threat 
to national and cultural identities and to 
current social trends. 
The language problem, which was also 
discussed in Brasilia and Harare, is a sin- 
gularly thorny one in Asia, where Anglo- 
American is in the process of becoming the 
vernacular language. The divorce between 
life as they live it and the language in which 
they express themselves is causing writers 
to experience a personality crisis, which is 
aggravated by the multiracial and multi- 
lingual character of many Asian countries. 
Here too a solution has heen sought 
through the restoration of a kind of har- 
mony that is rooted in tradition. The village 
and the family, the firm foundations of 
individual and collective identity, which 
in Asia have never been subject to attack as 
they have in the West, remain sacred. 
Nature, a metaplior for the harmony 
and peace of the soul, continues to he a 
favourite theme in Asian literature. 
Writers feel particularly concerned by the 
dangers that threaten it, and anguish 
about the environment sometimes leads 
to a return to religion or even, in certain 
countries, to fundamentalism. There is a 
risk that human rights, towards which the 
partieipants seemed fairly indifferent, 
may go by the board. On the other hand 
they welcomed the death of ideologies in 
the West, because it paves the way for a 
return to the self, the family, the village 
and tradition. 
Little was said about the idea of cre- 
ation during the discussions, which focused 
above all on a determination to return to 
the Self through separation from the 
Other. 
ALEXANDRE BLOKH 
THE CHALLENGES 
FACING ARAB 
LITERATURE 
The Arab writers’ symposium held in 1994 
in Carthage (Tunisia) was largely devoted 
to democracy, freedom of expression and 
the fundamentalist threat. The meeting 
was overshadowed by the killing of writers 
and by death threats against others. 
Salman Rushdie and the fatwa against him 
were discussed, as were obscurantism and 
the fundamentalists’ determination to 
impose criteria from another age that could 
reduce intellectuals to silence. Such is the 
pressure of fundamentalism that even the 
most independent-minded writers prac- 
tise self-ecnsorship. Great vigilance is 
required to avoid a return to an age of 
totems and taboos. 
This is not just a political problem. It 
is a challenge for civilization, as the dec- 
laration signed by the majority of the 
twenty writers present emphasizes, 
denouncing the catastrophe which might 
befall Arab nations if they fail to over- 
eome fundamentalist barbarism. The text 
specifies that at the time of its splendour, 
Islam was tolerant of outsiders and recep- 
tive to them, and did not reject pluralism 
or mixing. Only a return to these values 
can restore the fertility of Islamic elvi- 
hization. 
Another (question that often eame up, 
especially among participants from the 
Maghrib, was that of the language of 
expression chosen by writers. Voices were 
raised against those using foreign tongues, 
notably French. Tahar ben Jelloun of 
Moroceo responded by reprimanding “the 
watchdogs” of culture who think they have 
the right to distribute certificates of “Arab- 
ness”. Ilis compatriot Mohamed Berrada 
and the Tunisian writer Habib Selmi 
pointed to the multiplicity of the linguistic 
levels which, within the Arabie language, 
nonrishes their novels. 
The question of literary forms and 
sources opened a debate on the dialectic 
between the partieular and the universal. 
Palestinian writer Emile Habibi recalled 
that different forms of classical narration 
  
could be adapted to modern fiction. Several 
participants, including Salah Stétié of 
Lebanon, spoke of the role of Sufism as a 
source of inspiration for contemporary 
writing. Others, however, such as Egyptian 
writer Sonallah Ibrahim and Lebanon’s 
Elias Khoury, felt it was necessary to break 
with traditional forms in order to meet the 
demands of post-naturalist documentary, 
so that literatnre ean fulfil one of its voca- 
tions, which is to be the historieal witness 
of the crises and changes experienced by 
peoples. 
The Lebanese poet Adonis perhaps 
eame closest to indicating a middle way 
when he said, “In the past the poet 
responded to the demands of princes or 
tlie public. Today I am calling for an inver- 
sion of the relationship: it is who am 
asking the public to accompany me on an 
adventure.” 
Over and above the occasionally symp- 
tomatic reactions of writers from other 
regions (including the English writer 
Ronald Harwood, President of PEN Inter- 
national, and the Arabic-speaking Israeli 
Sami Mikhail, reduced to silence), this 
meeting showed that Arabic literature finds 
itself halfway between withdrawal into the 
shell of Aral) identity and a movement 
towards the freer atmosphere of world lit- 
erature, beyond national expressions. 
When all is said and done, if there is a 
split, it is between those who cannot bring 
themselves to leave their citadel and those 
who journey, at their own risk, in joy or in 
pain, across the vastnesses of the world.

reproduce a lecture or print 
admirable articles of an instructive or

is a vast distinction. A newspaper is not

of stories and articles slowly prepared far

attend courses of study, or to enjoy lit- 
erature, or to hear eloquence, or to go 
thoroughly into some subject, must 
attend a school or an assembly hall, must 
consult a book or a magazine. 
A newspaper is something quite dif- 
ferent. It exists for the purpose of 
giving its readers the news of the day 
every day. Everything else is sec- 
ondary. 
What then is news? It is a more or 
less skillful, more or less arbitrary 
selection of events snatched hastily 
from current life to be reported and 
spread before the reader with a min- 
imum of delay. 
What governs the selection? Why 
must some things be told but not 
others? Why are columns devoted to 
certain events but only a line or so to 
others? 
In free countries, the selection of 
news is usnally a compromise between 
what the proprietors of the paper think 
should be printed, and what the edi- 
tors of the paper think their readers 
would be most interested in. Some 
papers are subsidized by special polit- 
ical or economic interests. The pur- 
  
pose of such subsidies is to influence 
the selection and presentation of news. 
But most great newspapers today avoid 
subsidies because they wish to remain 
independent. They seek to make 
profits by selling eopies of the paper 
and by selling advertising space in the 
paper. For both these purposes, the 
more readers they have the more pros- 
perous and free they will be. The deter- 
mining factor in the selection of news 
is therefore usually, in the long run, the 
editors’ idea of what will attract the 
largest number of readers. 
Let us not deceive ourselves. Many 
experiments have been made, and it is 
now well established that newspapers 
devoted mainly to the fair and serious 
presentation of political, economic, 
scientific and artistic events must be 
content to sell few copies. The big cir- 
culations go to the papers which give 
only a minimum of space to such news, 
and devote their pages primarily to 
photographs and brief articles having 
to do with crime, sex, sports and 
cinema actors, with, by way of inter- 
national interest, frequent chauvin- 
istic attacks on foreign nations. 
THE SO-CALLED ‘AVERAGE 
READER? 
This unpleasant fact has given rise to a 
good deal of soul-searching on the part 
of public-spirited editors. There are of 
course a great many people everywhere 
who do want to know what is happening 
that is significant in the world. The 
higher the general standard of educa- 
tion and of independent thinking, the 
more there are likely to be of such 
people. Must they tlien be deprived of 
serious news merely because the 
ntajority of readers do not appear to 
care for it? That seems unreasonable. 
Editors have therefore long striven to 
find a way out of the dilenuna. 45

### 99867: The Press and the public

A RCHI VES 
One popular assumption in news- 
paper circles has been that more 
people would be interested in serious 
news if it were not so ponderously 
written, if it were presented in ways 
more vivacious, simpler, more pic- 
turesque, more human. A great deal of 
ingenuity and patient effort was thus 
expended in the endeavour to interest 
by some artifice, as it were, in sub- 
jects like polities and economics, the 
numerous people who are not natu- 
rally interested in such subjects. An 
abstraction called “the average 
reader” was invented. The theory was 
advanced, and acted upon, that every- 
thing in the paper should be so pre- 
sented that it would be comprehen- 
sible and interesting to this 
hypothetical average. 
But of course no such average 
person exists. And despite many bril- 
liant examples of popularization, the 
attempt to cater to this non-existent 
individual must be admitted to have 
failed, for the people not interested in 
the subject were still not interested, 
and those who were really interested 
resented the over-simplifieation, the 
distortions and the inadequacy. 
THE COMING TREND 
OF SPECIALIZATION 
A new and far better formula is there- 
fore now gradually developing. Under 
this formula it is recognized that there 
are many sorts of people, with many 
and diverse interests. The aim of a 
newspaper seeking a large circulation 
should therefore be, not to interest | 
everybody in everything, but to 
supply such a diversity of news every 
day that there will inevitably be some- 
thing for everybody. Thus, in the 
same newspaper, we may now find 
regional, national and foreign news, 
news of erime and scandal, news of 
sports, of politics, of society, of 
finance and economics, news of the 
theatre, the arts, the latest hooks, the 
latest seientific discoveries, together 
with photographs of beautiful cinema 
stars, cheap fiction and strips of 
humorous drawings. 
The implications of this new for- 
mula are only just beginning to be 
understood. It means that the news in 
each category can and should be so 
selected and presented as to appeal to 
46 the devotees of that particular kind 
of news. Sporting news should be 
written from the viewpoint and in the 
language of sporting people. Crime 
news sliould be written with a dra- 
matic or a detective story touch. And 
political news should be written in a 
way that will appeal, not to shop-girls 
or to bicycle racers, but to people 
interested in polities. There are thus 
theoretically no limitations upon the 
degree of excellence to be sought in 
cach category. 
Practically, however, there is one 
insuperable limitation. Itis an obvious 
one, but it is one which many critics of 
the newspapers seem not to take into 
account. This limitation is the high 
rate of speed at which it is necessary to 
gather, prepare and select news in 
order to put it before the readers 
without delay. This being so, the 
wonder is not that mistakes are occa- 
sionally made, but that they are not 
made more often. Only highly trained 
specialists can work successfully at 
this rate of speed, in the gathering, 
the preparation and the selection of 
news. And this, more and more, is 
what the newspapers are demanding: 
highly trained specialists in every 
department, whether sports, or crime, 
or politics. 
I do not mean to say that there is no 
possibility of improving the newspa- 
pers. On the eontrary, under the new 
theory of specialization in each cate- 
gory, we have a right to seek and to 
expect continuous improvement. The 
old incubus of the imaginary average 
reader is disappearing. Even an 
aecount of a chess mateh can now at 
last be written honestly for people 
interested in ehess by a specialist who 
knows about chess, and the better he 
ean make it, the better it will be for the 
newspaper. Given a free country with 
a high level of edueation and indepen- 
dent thought, there seems to be no 
reason why a publie-spirited publisher 
cannot produce an honest indepen- 
dent newspaper with enough readers to 
make it financially successful and to 
enable it to command the services of 
competent journalistic specialists. 
Such a newspaper, by giving its readers 
the news, all sorts of news, in accor- 
dance with the varying interests of the 
publie, will be fulfilling its true social 
function as daily purveyor of current 
information. ||

A TIMELESS 
MOMENT 
Isabelle Leymarie 
talks to 
DEVASMITA 
PATNAYIK 
Among India’s countless forms of tra- 
ditional dance, Bharata Natyam has 
experienced a remarkable revival and achieved 
international renown in the last fifty years. 
The same period has seen the steadily rising 
prestige of another very ancient sacred dance 
form, known as QOdissi, whose home is the 
state of Orissa in southern Bengal, tradition 
ally believed to be ksetra or sacred land. 
The golden age of Odissi was in the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries, when it was per- 
formed in the magnificent temples of Shiva at 
Bhubaneswar and of Jagannath at Puri and in 
the temple of the sun at Konarak. Today 
Odissi still draws inspiration from the sculp- 
tures and friezes that adorn these holy places, 
from sacred inscriptions and from classic 
treatises on abhinaya, the art of representa- 
tion. Graceful, expressive and lyrical, its lan- 
guid fluent gestures are imbued with nobility. 
The origins of Odissi can be traced back 
to the second century B.C., the date of carv- 
ings in the grotto of Udayagiri, near 
Bhubaneswar, which show ritual dances with 
poses that are still used today. In the fourth 
century B.C. a remarkable theoretical treatise 
on dance known as the Natya Sastra mentions 
a choreographic style known as odhra mag- 
adhi, from which contemporary Odissi is 
derived. According to myth, Shiva and his son 
Ganesh, thc elephant god and lord of the 
dance, taught certain poses to Manirambha, 
a celestial dancer who transmitted her knowl- 
edge to temple dancers (Devadasi). The devel- 
opment of Odissi was encouraged in the tenth 
century by King Chodagangadeva, the enlight- 
ened ruler who built the temple of Jagannath, 
aolrsisening:

and 300 years later a sacred dance festival was 
held at Konarak. During the Mughul invasions 
of India young women stayed in their homes to 
protect themselves against the invaders, and 
male dancers who dressed like women and 
were known as Gotipua kept the tradition of 
Odissi alive. 
Influenced by Jainism, Tantrism, Buddhism 
and Vishnuism, Odissi was danced by temple 
dancing girls called Mahari, court dancers 
known as Nachuni, and the Gotipua, who per- 
formed in public. Some time around the sev- 
enteenth century the Mahari and Nachuni faded 
from the scene, and only the Gotipua were left. 
During the period of British colonial rule 
Odissi gradually shed its sacred aspect and 
became a form of entertainment for the ruling 
class. As before the Gotipua carried on the 
tradition, introducing supple and complex move- 
ments that were in some ways similar to gym- 
nastics. The great practitioners of our times, 
Kelu Charan Mahapatra, Deva and Pankaj 
Charan Das were once Gotipua. Since inde- 
pendence in 1246, Odissi has recovered its 
former glory thanks to scholarly research and 
the interest of choreographers. 
One of Odissi's most accomplished expo- 
nents, Devasmita Patnayik, gave a performance 
in Paris in 1991 during a series of cultural 
events organized as part of UNESCO's Silk 
Route Programme. On that occasion we asked 
her some questions about her art. 
Are there certain basic poses in Odissi? 
—Yes, there are three, the chowka, the four- 
square posture of the god Jagannatha, sym- 
bolizing equilibrium; the tribhanga, a triple body 
movement (head, hips and knees), a position 
that is commonly shown in ancient sculpture 
and is absent from other dance styles; and 
the abhanga, in which the weight of the body 
rests on one foot. Starting with these basic 
poses, modifications can be made which use 
the whole body—hands, head, eyes and other 
facial muscles. 
Are the movements codified? 
—In Odissi you find the same symbolic gestures 
and mudras {hand positions} as in other tradi- 
tional Indian dance-styles. There are nine eye 
movements, nine head movements, thirty-six 
mudras executed with one hand—to evoke 
clouds, for example, or a forest, a river, a bud, 
a peacock and other birds, animals and natural 
elements—as well as mudras executed with 
both hands. Other gestures signify a window, a 
bow, a kiss, candlelight. . . . A typical Odissi 
movement consists in backing up on one's 
 
heels then pirouetting on one foot. Combining 
these movements and poses offers a wealth of 
possibilities. One can also improvise using this 
basic vocabulary. These movements are ben- 
eficial for both body and soul, for dancing com- 
municates energy and encourages fulfilment. It 
raises awareness both of oneself and of the 
audience, transmits Veda (knowledge), and 
unites men and women with the divine. 
What is the significance of the costumes you 
wear—those wonderful, purple, blue, red and 
grey saris, face, foot and hand make-up, and 
the headdress with white ornaments? 
—Since dance is an offering, a devotional act 
and a search for perfection, the dancer must be 
beautiful, especially since she repeats the 
poses shown in magnificent ancient sculptures. 
The headdress symbolizes jasmin buds, which 
were often given as offerings in temples, and 
the make-up is governed by certain rules. In 
order to make the gestures more visible, the 
hands and feet are painted red—a colour sym- 
bolizing prosperity. My saris come from Qrissa, 
and the “fan” (the central pleating) is very typ- 
ical of that part of India. Every item of clothing 
has its own significance, and the saris of Orissa 
(like Odissi itself) are coming back into fashion 
all over India. You can even see them on tele 
vision. The area between Puri and Bhubaneswar 
is also well known for its colourful appliquéd 
fabric. | wear silver jewellery because silver is 
the only metal worn in Orissa. 
Does the dancer follow the music, or, as in 
many African dances, does she dictate her 
own beat to the musicians? 
— She has to follow the beat, and since she 
wears bells on her feet, she can't afford to go 
wrong. 
You sometimes do your own choreography. 
Does it follow any particular theme? 
—Absolutely. I have created a dance based on 
the nine navarasa (main emotions). The emo- 
tions are love, heroism, sadness (or pathos), 
laughter, fear, anger, disgust, wonder and 
peace. (The term rasa means “savour, relish, 
juice”). 
Devasmita Patnayik then demonstrated the 
nine navarasa. First of all her feet took root in 
the fertile ground before beating the rhythm as 
her head and torso thrust heavenwards. 
Changing emotions flickered across her mobile 
features. Her face puckered in sadness, her 
eyes became fiery with anger and then rolled 
upwards in disgust. At last her body found 
peace, fulfilment and serenity. | watched this 
graceful and supple dancer, whose hands drew 
skilful arabesques, joined by the magic of move- 
ment in transcendent harmony with the forces 
of the universe. | felt the richness of her inner 
world, and left her with the feeling that | too had 
participed, for a moment, in the divine. | |

A MAN AND HIS TIME 
To mark Federico Mayor's sixtieth birthday, over a hundred of his friends from all over the world have decided to present him 
with a collection of written tributes in the form of a book entitled Amicorum liber. 
Writers, artists and researchers, Heads of State, ministers and leaders of major international organizations have contributed 
texts which express, from the different standpoints and backgrounds of their authors, their attachment to Federico Mayor and 
his work. 
The letters, pen-poriraits and studies collected in this book constitute a description of the age in which we live, its victories 
and defeats, its ambitions and limits, its questions and answers. The recurring themes are peace, democracy, science, education, 
culture and history—all the hopes, dreams and projects with which the Director-General of UNESCO has been identified for many 
years. 
The portrait of an ideal emerges from these pages, as well as the portrait of a man. An ideal which is shared by the contribu- 
tors, who include Mohammed Bedjaoui, Boutros Bontros-Ghali, Camilo José Cela, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Christian de Duve, 
Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Maurice Goldswrith, Mikhail Gorbachev, Rigoberta Menchii Tim, Adolfo Perez 
Esquivel, Ilya Prigogine, Raymond Ranjeva, Edouard Saouma, Karan Singh, Mario Soares, Wole Soyinka and many other eit- 
izens of the world. 
~The future is built on the present, 
“but everything originates in the 
heart. Whereas compassion and soli- 
darity with suffering humanity seem 
more necessary than ever, hearts have all 
too often hardened. Selfishness is the 
dominant force in today’s world. . . . 
Individuals, groups and nations must 
realize that selfishness breeds misfor- 
tune and death; they must overcome it 
and agree to share the wealth of which 
they are the trustees. We must all of us 
learn to give and to receive, without for- 
getting that the rich too can receive from 
the poor. 
EDOUARD SAOUMA (Lebanon) 
Director General of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, 1976-1993 
~ Itis true that we have learned that 
~ differences can be in themselves 
an object of respect and a sonrce of 
mutual enrichment. But when they take 
the form of manifest inequalities, we also 
feel that they are injustices. This feeling, 
today shared by all peoples and all 
nations, is an undeniable sign of progress 
of the human conscience. 
BOUTROS BOUTROS-GHALI (Egypt) 
Secretary General of the United Nations 
In this new vision of human rights, 
"three “generations” of rights, each 
naturally interlinked with the others, 
may be distinguished. First of all the 
individual rights, such as the right to 
life and to physical, psychological, intel- 
lectual and spiritual integrity, on which 
the dignity of the person is based. Next 
comes the second generation of rights, 
which concern health, education, work, 
information and other matters, and con- 
tribute to the quality of life. Finally, the 
third generation is that of the rights of 
peoples to development, a healthy envi- 
ronment, and self-determination. In a 
democracy regarded as a system based 
on solidarity, these rights represent 
intangible values and basic necessities. 
ADOLFO PEREZ ESQUIVEL (Argentina) 
Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, 1980 
We suffer from three major imbal- 
"ances: between the North and the 
South of the planet, between rich and 
poor within each society, between 
humankind and nature. . . . The three 
crises cannot be overcome separately. 
We shall not be able to build, at whatever 
level, harmonious relations between man 
and the environment if harmonious rela- 
tions between men and between societies 
are not built at the same time. 
DANIEL GEEUDEVERT (France) 
First Vice-President 
of the International Green Cross 
~ Not for along time has the national 
“or ethnic issue arisen in such an 
acute form or on so large a scale as it has 
today. . . . The significance of this phe- 
nomenon does not lie simply in the fact 
that it sometimes degenerates into out- 
bursts of nationalism ending in bloody 
confrontations that are an affront to the 
conscience and common sense of 
humanity. . . . , but above all in the fact 
that a growing number of problems affect 
all peoples and cannot be solved by the 
efforts of individual states. Only 
humanity as a whole, acting as one, as a 
world community, is capable of solving 
such problems, reconciling national 
interests with, and if necessary subor- 
dinating them to, common human inter- 
ests, and reconciling national sovereignty 
with the will of the community, This may 
well be the main social issue of the 
twenty-first century. 
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV (Russia) 
Former Head of State 
President of the International Foundation for 
Socio-Economic and Political Studies 
¥ ~ Relegated by enlightened and pro- 
“gressive nationalism to dismal 
nether regions, cultures have become 
“sleeping beauties”. 
Today they have awakened. Still as 
beautiful . . . but armed with teeth. 
These vampire-like cultures are 
thirsty for the language and blood of 
their subjects. Sometimes we are sorry 
that we did not drive a stake into their 
heart while they slept. And we wonder 
whether a plait of garlic would not drive 
them away and with them the most 
hideous forms of chauvinism, xeno- 
phobia and genocide: ghettos, enclaves 
and ethnic purification. 
CARLOS FUENTES (Mexico)

A well-known philosopher wrote 
that “science does not think”. I 
reject that. Science thinks in total 
freedom. But it does not judge how the

### 99869: United Nations year for Tolerance, 1995: an uphill task

1995 UNITED NATIONS YEAR FOR TOLERANCE 
Tahar Ben Jelloun An uphill task 
  
    
  
    
    
 
    
    
    
“A function of a fervour that has waned, of an imbalance that results not from an excess but from a lack of 
energy, tolerance holds no appeal for the young.” So says the Romnanian-born philosopher Emil Cioran in 
“Lettre a un ami lointain” (Letter to a distant friend), the first chapter of lis book Histoire et utopie (Ilistory 
and Utopia). Adolescence is by its very nature a time of extrenzes. Some young people never grow into adults 
but sink into fanaticism and become desperately narrow-minded, their unshakeable beliefs extinguishing in 
them the spark of life, the spirit of dissent or quite simply the critical outlook in any shape or form. 
Itis thus difficult to talk about tolerance to those who live on a diet of wild slogans and inflammatory jibes 
and who are always in a hurry; but it would be suicidal for society to say nothing at all about the cardinal virtue 
of listening to others and respecting their views, beliefs and customs. Let us thercfore teach tolerance, strip- 
ping it of its cloak of self-righteousness and its coats of varnish. Tolerance is a way of living, and it starts in 
the primary school. 
Overcoming resistance 
It has also to be admitted that human nature does not tend of its own aecord in this direction. Iluman beings 
would appear to be fundamentally intolerant. The whole of the culture propagated by the civilized countries, 
‘those states where the rule of law prevails, is rooted in the fact that tolerance does not come naturally but has 
to be inculcated until it becomes second nature to people, spontaneous, a kind of reflex—a difficult task, given 
all the resistance and all the temptations to be overcome. 
Cioran says that if the prospect of, or the opportunity for, a massacre is held out to them, young people 
will follow a leader blindly; such opportunities are constantly being offered to them by fanatieism in its polit- 
ical, ideological or religious manifestations. Suggestibility may take such harmless forms as fashions in dress 
or music, fashions that quickly come and go; but the readiness of the young to follow any charlatan and trans- 
late any outlandish idea into action makes it supremely important to get to work on and with them. 
To make tolerance people’s second nature is a duty that has to be done if the rule of law is to be established 
and consolidated. Without tolerance there is no democracy or, to put it another way, democracy and intol- 
erance are irreconcilable opposites. Fanaticism is the fire surreptitiously lit by intolerance in the democratic 
fabric, it is a fixation, a deceptively pure-seeming obsession, an error that seeks to bring life—anything that 
moves, changes and holds surprises—to a standstill. 
To tolerate fanaticism would be to tolerate the intolerable. Ilow can fanaticism be allowed to monopolize 
the scene and make it a setting for tragedy? How is it possible to tolerate the enemies of freedom, those who 
would destroy intelligence and beauty, whose goal is a totalitarian order that imposes uniformity and proclaims 
that might is right, the law of the jungle? Where ean oue find the patience, courage and composure to refute 
this barbarity that prefers the use of the gun to that of the spoken or written word? How can one hold fast to 
one’s principles, remain strictly respectful of beliefs different from, and even opposed to, one’s own, and coexist 
with those who would wipe out anything that does not fit in with their crazed way of thinking? 
  
Intolerance is only tolerable in art 
Tolerance is an uphill task. It requires courage and strength, a robust aptitude for the cut and thrust of debate, 
and an ability to stand up to pressure. Who can claim to possess all these attributes? The answer is a combi- 
nation of soldier and poet, policeman and philosopher, magistrate and artist—for all great literature and all 
great painting have been the expression of intolerance of the intolerable. The writer’s subject is not happi- 
ness, nor is peace that of the artist. Artis a clean break, a rejection, anger, provocation even. When beauty 
is laid waste, intelligence done to death, childhood violated and human beings humiliated, art cannot but be 
intolerant. It tolerates neither the ugliness of which people are capable nor the revulsion they arouse, 
Fanaticism can be countered with humour; but this is sometimes a risky undertaking, since those who are 
fixated upon a certain order of things detest wit, subtlety and of course laughter. What they hold sacred is 
dogma, rigid and immutable. It is forbidden to make fun of it, whereas life, being short and beset with pit- 
falls, commends laughter as tlie best course. Laughter is often provocative, a way of distancing oneself a little 
from reality; but distance is something that has been totally banished from the world of intolerant people, who 
are so bound up in themselves they would like the rest of humanity to be identical clones of themselves. 
Tolerance is something that has to be learned, a requirement that has to be lived with every day, a diffi- 
culty to be faced every moment of every day. It is hard work, but those who are attached to prineiples rather 
than prejudices or compromises do not seek the easy way out. They may not sleep soundly, itis true, but at | 
least they do not relinquish that which makes us human, our dignity. CI

THE WRONG TRACK? 
An article by Jean Daniel published in 
your December 1991 issue (“Religion and 
Politics Today”) contains the following 
elliptical and to my mind bewildering 
statement: “liberalism . . . ended up in 
nazism.” It seems to me that it was in the 
name of liberalism that Great Britain 
(where this doctrine was born) led the 
fight against 1litler’s ideas and practices 
and that thousands of American troops 
left their own country (where liberal ide- 
ology is not entirely unknown) to rid us of 
nazi ideology. 
In the same issue Régis Debray makes 
a surprising juxtaposition when lie derides 
“cleries and mafias. . . .”” Do the priests 
who teach my children about loving their 
neighbour and respeeting others belong 
to a terrible criminal organization? The 
same author describes religion as “the vit- 
amin of the weak”. This “vitainin” does me 
a great deal of good, and my “weakness” 
does not prevent me from appreciating the 
open-mindedness of the Courier, even 
when its writers scem to me to swerve onto 
the wrong track. 
Marie Varéne

FAITHLESS BUT NOT FACELESS 
One might have expected to see an atheist’ 
point of view expressed in your December 
1994 issue, if only in general terms. Not so. 
The word “atheist” is seldom heard these 
days; it disturbs people. Atheists are ys; peog 
regarded as “different”, even in the West. 
=) “. 
In some countries atheism is punished by 
death. 
Many thinkers have proclaimed their 
lack of religion down the centuries, among 
them Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, 
Victor Ilugo, Emile Zola, Bertrand Russell 
and Jean Rostand. They too were “dif- 
ferent”. Their influence was inimical to 
faith and religion. 
It is because of cultural progress that 
the Catholic Inquisition is unknown in the 
modern Western world, whereas religious 
terrorism is rampant in other regions. 
On the eve of the year 2000 why did you 
not take account of the faet that there are 
tens of millions of human beings without 
faith or religion, and that they breathe 
the same air as those who believe in divine 
providence? 
When providing information with an 
ideological content, the expression of an 
opinion should not exclnde the expression 
ol its antithesis, if only to give readers an 
opportunity to make a free choice. That is 
the price of eredibility.

Puechabon (France) 
FUNDAMENTALISM AS A MISGUIDED 
FORM OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION 
Fundamentalism is not a blueprint for 
society deriving from a historical reality, 
either recent or remote, nor is it based on 
detailed analyses of economic, social or 
political conditions. Itis a form of protest 
against corrupt, medioere government. 
A society becomes an easy prey to 
obscurantism because of the greed, the 
hunger for power and the irresponsibility 
of its leaders, and tbe bankruptcy and

It is reckless to claim, today, that fun- 
damentalism is a political movement with 
majority support. Itis a crime to abandon 
millions of people, who have been reduced 
to silence by oppressive and divisive polit- 
ical leaders, to exeeutioners and fanatics 
who elaim they are “saviours of 
humanity”. Ilow many more crimes will 
have to be committed before people ery: 
“Stop! We want no more of our history 
written in blood”?

improvement, through the influence of an 
enlightened [ew, humanity might be able, 
if it isn’t too late, to rectify this situation. 
So many people do not know where to turn 
that perhaps the Courier, for example, 
could present some examples of individual 
behaviour that people might (ollow.
