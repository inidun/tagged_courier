Dead and alive 
1991, painting in acrylic 
(100 x 70 cm) 
by Bernadette Février 
Although inspired by 
African funerary figures, 
this rather disconcerting 
image is nevertheless a 
symbol of life. It is the 
work of French artist 
Bernadette Février, who 
explains its significance 
in the following words: 
“The static appearance 
of the face contrasts 
with the movement of 
the draped folds beneath, 
which seem to open on ? 
to the vital organs and \ 
hb 
show that death is only eS | REA 2 A a All

“The Governments of the States 
parties to this Constitution on behalf 
of their peoples declare, 
‘‘that since wars begin in the minds 
of men, it is in the minds of men 
that the defences of peace must be 
constructed... 
“that a peace based exclusively 
upon the political and economic 
arrangements of governments 
would not be a peace which could 
secure the unanimous, lasting and 
sincere support of the peoples of 
the world, and that the peace must 
therefore be founded, if it is not to 
fail, upon the Intellectual and moral 
solidarity of mankind. 
“For these reasons, the States 
parties ... are agreed and 
determined to develop and to 
increase the means of 
communication between their 
peoples and to employ these means 
for the purposes of mutual 
understanding and a truer 
and more perfect knowledge of 
each other's lives..."

UNESCO'S FIRST 45 YEARS (Part II 
by Michel Conil Lacoste 
  
Many newly independent 
countries join UNESCO 
1960 
General policy 
® In this year alone, 17 African countries (and one 
other) join UNESCO, which now has 99 Member 
States. Many newly independent and developing 
countries join UNESCO in the 1960s, bringing to 
the Organization its universality of thought and 
action. One important result of this broadening is 
the intensification of operational activities in the 
field. 
 
Education 
B® A resolution adopted by the General Assembly 
of the United Nations recognizes education, 
hitherto considered exclusively in 2 humanist per- 
spective, as a factor in economic development. 
This decision holds great importance for the 
future orientation of UNESCO's activities in 
education. 
® The Convention against Discrimination in 
Education is adopted. Today 76 States are Parties 
to the Convention. 
8 Three intergovernmental conferences are con- 
vened by UNESCO in Karachi, Beirut and Addis 
Ababa on educational needs in Asia, in the Arab 
States and in Africa respectively. At Karachi 18 
countries draw up a plan for the development 
of primary education in Asia. 
® The International Council of Sport and Phys- 
ical Education (later the International Council of 
Sport Science and Physical Education) holds its 
first General Assembly. The Council came into 
being as a result of co-operation, encouraged by 
UNESCO, between representatives of national 
and international bodies concerned with sport 
during the Olympic Games held in Melbourne 
(1956) and Rome (1960). 
Exact and natural sciences 
 
® The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Com- 
mission (a semi-autonomous body within 
UNESCO) is established. The Commission pro- 
motes scientific research into the ocean and its 
living and non-living resources through concerted 
action by its Member States. Its first task is to 
co-ordinate the International Indian Ocean Expe- 
dition (1959-1965). 
® The International Brain Research Organiza- 
tion (IBRO) is founded. 
® ECOSOC examines a survey carried out by 
UNESCO, at the request of the UN General 
Assembly, on current trends of enquiry in the 
natural sciences and on the dissemination and 
application for peaceful purposes of such 
knowledge. The results of the survey appear in 
a book, Current Trends in Scientific Research, 
produced under the direction of Prof. Pierre 
Auger and published jointly by the UN and 
UNESCO in 1961. 
Culture 
® The campaign to save the monuments of 
Nubia from flooding by the waters of the Aswan 
High Dam is launched. Presiding at a ceremony 
at UNESCO headquarters, André Malraux com- 
mends “the action of a man who snatches some- 
thing from death”. The campaign lasts 20 years; 
22 shrines and temples are moved, 40 technical 
missions from 5 continents participate, and the 
contributions of governments and other inter- 
national sources, public and private, total $56 
million.

General policy 
® November: following the resignation of Vit- 
torino Veronese for health reasons, René Maheu 
René Maheu In 1962, the year In which he was 
elected Dirsctor-General of UNESCO. 
 
(France) becomes acting Director-General. He is 
elected Director-General in 1962. 
® The International Convention for the Protec- 
tion of Performers, Producers of Phonograms 
and Broadcasting Organizations (the “Rome 
Convention) is drawn up jointly by UNESCO, 
the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) and the International Labour Organi- 
sation (ILO). 
 
Education 
® An educational co-operation programme 
between UNICEF and UNESCO begins, 
notably in primary and early childhood edu- 
cation. 
® The first Regional Conference of Ministers of 
Education is held at Addis Abeba. Between 1961 
and 1986, 24 such conferences are held (for 
Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; the 
Arab States; Asia and the Pacific; and Europe). 
® An emergency programme is launched as part 
of UN action to maintain educational services 
in Congo-Léopoldville (today Zaire). More than 
a hundred specialists are sent and help is provided 
for the recruitment of some 800 teachers. 
Exact and natural sciences 
 
® UNESCO sends a mission into the seismic 
zones of Asia, South Americaand Africa, leading 
to the creation of a study programme on earth- 
quakes and other natural hazards. 
® UNESCO establishes in Rome the Interna 
tional Computation Centre (ICC) later to 
become the Intergovernmental Bureau of Infor- 
matics (IBI). 
 
Culture 
® The UNESCO Collections of Traditional 
Music are launched in collaboration with the 
IMC (150 LPs released by 1986). Today the Col- 
lections have been issued on 50 compact discs.

General policy 
® The first edition is published of the UNESCO 
Statistical Yearbook, which becomes a standard 
source of facts and figures on the world situa- 
tion in education, science and culture. Compiled 
each year with the co-operation of UNESCO 
 
National Commissions, national statistical 
services and the statistical office of the United 
Nations, its data are taken from periodical reports 
provided by Member States on laws, regulations 
and statistics relating to their educational, scien- 
tific and cultural activities and from replies to 
UNESCO questionnaires sent from some 200 
countries and territories, 
Education 
® The first fund in trust project is launched after 
an offer by the Swedish government in favour 
of the education of women in Africa. “Funds in 
trust” are put at UNESCO's disposal by certain 
countries to finance specific activities to be 
executed by UNESCO in a specific Member 
State. 
® The General Conference decides to establish 
the International Institute for Educational Plan- 
ning (ITEP), which opens the following year in 
Paris, The Institute’s activities are divided 
between training, research, and the dissemination 
of new concepts, methods and techniques in 
educational planning. Its annual training 
programme is mainly intended for educators 
from developing countries (42 participants from 
over 30 countries in the 1990-1991 academic 
year). 
Since it was founded, the Institute has trained 
927 educators from 131 countries through 
an annual training programme at its Paris 
headquarters, and through intensive courses 
and other training activities carried out directly 
in its Member States. Current research focuses 
on three themes: “Improving the quality of 
education”; “Financing management and 
administration of education”; “Development of 
human resources”. Publications: 650 titles to 
date.

### 90303: Interview with Melina Mercouri

Stage and screen actress, deputy and minister, 
Melina Mercouri has had an eventful career which has been 
crowned with success in many fields. A standard-bearer 
of liberty at the time-of the colonels’ régime, she is 
regarded with affection by the Greek people, for whom 
she is simply “our Melina". 
  
® You were very young when you first 
became interested in the theatre. Tell us some- 
thing about the actor’s craft. What did Greek 
society at that time, and your own family, 
think about the stage? 
— My family has been involved in politics for 
generations. My grandfather, who adored me 
and whom I adored, was mayor of Athens for 
more than twenty years. The house was 
always full, for at that time the mayor of 
Athens was as powerful as a minister, maybe 
even more so. That was theatre for me. I had 
a stage, an audience, partners, dialogues, some- 
times even long tirades.

m Were there women in politics at that time? 
— No. Politics was for men. But when I was 
achild, I often used to imagine what it would 
be like to be in my grandfather's shoes. Politics 
didn’t enter into it, I understood nothing 
about that. What mattered was the drama, the 
speeches . . . and the audience. 
So the theatre was a part of me from my 
early years. And then my grandfather often 
took me with him to see plays. I felt at home 
there, even though I couldn't follow the plots. 
In some ways it was like being at home. 
Even when I was very young, I was a 
rebel. When I was seven or eight I used to 
escape from the house and go off with a friend 
to the cinema or to a café to listen to music. 
Once we got dressed up in our mothers’ finery 
and went to a sailors’ tavern, where they 
served tea and played music. In all innocence, 
we got up and danced. We just enjoyed per- 
forming, putting on a show and being 
applauded. My mother soon put an end to that 
little adventure. A woman who had seen us 
tipped her off, and she came looking for me. 
She took me back home and severely punished 
me. Never mind. | had made my decision. I 
wanted to go on the stage. | wanted applause! 
Obviously, my parents didn’t see things in the 
same way. 
® Why not? Was the life of an actor or actress 
considered disreputable? 
— No. But for the Athenian upper middle 
class to which I belonged, it wasn't done to 
go on the boards, even to play a heroine of 
Sophocles or Euripides. What's more, there 
was no security in the artist's life. One day 
you could be rolling in money and the next 
you could be starving. For children of good 
family, the theatre was risky. 
I don’t think my parents thought there 
was anything dishonourable about acting. 
They would have had no objection if they 
could have been certain that I would be a 
success! They were behind me throughout my 
political and artistic career. It would certainly 
have been the same with my grandfather, if 
he hadn't done me the dirty trick of dying in 
the meantime. 


### 90303: Interview with Melina Mercouri

MELINA MERCOURI     
talks to 
Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat 
W [f things were as you describe them, how 
did you set about overcoming the obstacles? 
— I got married at seventeen! To a wealthy 
aristocrat who had studied at Cambridge 
University. Politically he was conservative, 
not to say reactionary, but he had extremely 
liberal ideas on the role of women. He didn’t 
try to turn me into a submissive wife, He 
didn’t even make me take his name, as was 
normal at the time. I stayed Melina Mercouri, 
for him and for everyone he introduced me 
to. That's how I broke free from my family 
and how I was able to study and prepare for 
the audition that would get me into the Drama 
School of the National Theatre of Greece. 
® Then came the war and the Occupation. 
Could you describe what it was like? Or is 
it something you prefer not to talk about? 
— Why shouldnt I talk about 1t? We had three 
years of Occupation. I saw swollen bellies and 
people dying of hunger. I saw carts going by 
with the corpses of men and women piled up 
on them like carcasses of cattle. I saw people 
living from day to day, not knowing what 
tomorrow would bring. I saw the continual 
uncertainty drive some to heroic acts of 
resistance and others to collaboration. 
Nobody in my family collaborated with the 
enemy. My younger brother was in the 
Resistance. Not me. It’s the one thing I really 
regret. But it wasn’t through lack of courage 
or fear of death. 
One day I was in a tavern with three 
friends when three SS men entered. They were 
I ————

dead drunk. They asked us to sit at their table. 
When we didn’t move, one of them drew a 
revolver. My three friends got up then and 
went over to join them. I don’t know what 
got into me because my head was empty, but 
[ didn’t move. The SS man was furious, he 
kept on at me. He pointed the pistol and 
started counting. “Ein, zwei, drei. . ..” I still 
didn’t move. I wasn’t scared. He fired, and the 
glass in front of me shattered. Now I was 
furious, and I got up and started shouting 
insults at him. I never considered that he 
might keep on firing. I wasn’t thinking of any- 
thing. Then the military police arrived and 
dragged him out of the tavern. 
[ didn’t know what fear was. Even so, I 
didn’t join the Resistance. When I think about 
it now, I wonder if the main reason wasn’t 
my burning ambition to be an actress! At 
drama school from two till six every day, the 
outside world ceased to exist. There was no 
more Occupation, no more Germans, no 
more Melina even. There was only Mar- 
guerite, Ophelia, la Locandiera, Electra. And 
then there was the sublime Dimitris Rondiris, 
our teacher. He demanded from us a commit- 
ment to the theatre as total as his own. His 
Orestela remains the greatest theatrical 
experience of my life. 
It was Rondiris who taught me to control 
and modulate my voice. He used to say that 
I was made for tragedy. I was quite prepared 
to admit that Electra was the greatest role an 
actress could play, but even so I used to beg 
him, sometimes with tears in my eyes, to 
admit that I wasn’t Electra! Then he would 
Ee a ie ii i 
talk to me. At length and tirelessly. He talked 
to me about Greek tragedy, about its poetry, 
the tradition, the significance it had for the 
Greek people. Eventually he convinced me. 
He made theatre a religion for me. That is no 
exaggeration; there was something religious 
about my devotion to Greek tragedy. Back 
home, 1 would rehearse Marguerite’s mono- 
logue on my knees. I rehearsed it so many 
times that I wore out the carpet. 
What could the SS do against Medea or 
Antigone? Thanks to them, I moved through 
the war like a sleepwalker. Without getting 
into psychoanalysis, I think you have to look 
to my love of the theatre for one of the essen- 
tial keys to my behaviour. 
® You began your career on the stage just 
after the war. What does playing a role 
involve for you: What goes through your 
head when you're performing a part that 
someone else has written? 
— It’s when I'm rehearsing that the most 
important things happen. It's during rehearsals 
that the character, who as you say has been 
created by someone else, becomes alive in me 
and through me. Actors carry their roles inside 
them, just as pregnant women carry babies. 
You can feel it physically, like a pregnancy. 
It’s a very sensual experience. It’s that gesta- 
tion that constitutes the creative part of acting, 
Later, when you confront the audience, it’s 
more like bullfighting. You have to kill them, 
of course, but the instruments are already 
there. You've prepared them during 
rehearsals.

® Are audiences different, or is there really 
only one audience? 
— Audiences are different. In England, 
America, even France, audiences are often 
ready for the fray as soon as they’ve got their 
tickets; they're expecting to take part in a 
brawl. In Greece they're colder. You have to 
work hard to win them over, to warm them

up, get them to react, take part. 
Wm Let's suppose the brawl is over and the 
audience has been conquered. Who does it 
applaud? Melina Mercouri, or the part she has 
played? Does each character have its own 
reality, its own message, or is it really always 
Melina who is in control? 
— Melina is always there, naturally, but to give 
birth to a role created by someone else, a 
character for whom she is only a surrogate 
mother. At every performance, Melina gives 
birth. Now, there are some people who talk 
down the role of the surrogate mother. 
They’re wrong, The baby Melina brings forth 
for the audience has been in her guts after all. 
It’s no longer the exclusive property of the 
author, any more than it's exclusively 
Melina’s. It has a life, a reality of its own. It’s 
incredible, what I'm saying, but that’s what 
happens. And it’s wonderful. 
It’s all the more outrageous because the 
director is also mixed up in this process of no 
longer knowing who is who. The director is 
a go-between. And a good director will know 
how to make the actor part of a whole com- 
pany on stage. Without that, even an actor 
who is a genius will end up like a meteorite, 
lost in too much space. In the theatre it’s team- 
work that works wonders. 
® Where does cinema fit in to all this¢ Was 
it part of your adolescent dreams? 
— It certainly was! Mind you, in the early 
1950s, Greek cinema only wanted actresses to 
play young innocents. Above all they had to 
have big eyes and tiny little mouths. I wasn’t 
built for the job. I was too big and my mouth

was too wide. Even so, I didn’t give up hope. 
I told myself that maybe I'd have a chance 
somewhere else, in France or England. And 
sure enough, one day in London Alexander 
Korda gave me a screen test. We both burst 
out laughing when we saw it; I looked 
ridiculous. 
I'd finished up by convincing myself, and 
everyone else too, that the theatre was the 
only place for me. When lacovos Campanellis 
wrote the part of Stella for me, he saw it as 
a stage role. By chance, though, he had asked 
Cacoyannis to direct it. There was a moment 
when things were touch-and-go. Cacoyannis 
wanted to make it into a film, but Campanellis 
didn’t want anyone but me to play Stella. As 
far as he was concerned, I was Stella, “the most 
emancipated woman in Greece”. So they 
decided to give me a screen test. That was a 
weird experience. Cacoyannis started by pho- 
tographing me from every angle, then he set 
up the camera in front of me, made me howl 
with laughter and shot me with the camera 
focused halfway down my throat. When I saw 
the rushes, I understood that something had 
happened. It was the start of a love-affair 
between me and the camera. 
Stella was a success. It was shown at the 
Romy Schneider, Peter Finch and Melina 
Mercourl, in a scene from the film 10.30 p.m. 
Summer (19686). 
  
Cannes Film Festival, where I almost won the 
Best Actress award. It was the start of 
Cacoyannis’s international career. Thirty-five 
years later, the film hasn’t aged a bit. They 
showed it on television recently and the 
viewing figures were exceptional. The 
character Campanellis created remains abso- 
lutely modern. Cacoyannis used to say of 
Stella: “She’s gay. She’s vibrant. She’s proud 
of her body. She’s proud of her liberty. She 
has lovers and she has friends. She refuses to 
think of marriage as a form of security, and 
she doesn’t want society’s blessing. She’s sus- 
picious of everything society approves of.” 
® Of all the films you made in your interna- 
tional career, which one stands out for you 
now? 
 
  
 
Melina Mercouri between 
Anthony Perkins and Jules Dassin (right) 
during the shooting of Phaedra (1962). 
— Stella by a long chalk. Then that wonderful 
film Celui qui doit mourir (“He who Must 
Die”). It came out of the encounter between 
Kazantzakis, Jules Dassin and Crete. Crete is 
splendid, Kazantzakis a genius and Dassin a 
very great director. 
I can still visualize the village where it was 
shot. They'd never seen a camera before. We'd 
agreed that all the villagers should appear as 
extras, and we'd assembled them in the church 
square. Dassin read the script and I translated. 
There were good and bad characters in the 
script, rich people and poor people. 
When we came to give out the roles, 
everyone wanted to play the goodies, which is 
to say the poor people. It was no use my telling 
them that the bad guys weren't just rich, they 
also had more important parts, so the people 
who played them would make more money. I 
still couldn’t persuade them. Finally I told them 
that I couldn't do anything about it, that that 
was how Kazantzakis had plotted the story. 
None of them had read the novel, in fact most 
of them didn’t know how to read. But the 
moment | mentioned Kazantzakis's name, they 
all immediately agreed to play whatever role he 
wanted them to. It brought tears to my eyes. 
I made other films with Dassin. In each 
of them he managed miraculously to create 
an atmosphere of camaraderie and joie de vivre 
that transfigured everyone involved. [ would 
like to mention here the film he made about

a ri 
the unrest at the Ecole Polytechnique in 
Athens. The whole film was shot indoors, in 
one room. Yet through Dassin’s magic, all the 
anger, all the nobility, all the beauty of the 
Greek people are there in it. It’s a pure gem. 
® How do you explain the stir Melina made 
when she went into politics? Melina, who 
hadn't joined the Resistance during the War? 
— That wasn’t the same at all. During the War 
I was very young, and there were the Drama 
School courses to isolate me, literally to spirit 
me away from the fighting. 
With the dictatorship of the colonels, it 
was very different. I had reached a completely 
different emotional and political maturity. 
The coup d'état affected me like a rape. You 
can't react calmly to being raped. You shout, 
you protest, you scratch. I was abroad when 
the colonels seized power. Well, I shouted as 
loud as I could. I shouted, I sang, I danced for 
liberty. I wasn’t a spoiled child anymore. I was 
someone to be reckoned with. 
® What special memories do you have of that 
time? 
— Special memories? Every minute of it is a 
special memory! The phone ringing. Or 
maybe not ringing, or not when you expect 
it to. Getting caught up in action, and then 
the agony of doing nothing. It’s all there, 
lurking somewhere in my memory. If I let it 
all out, we'd be here till tomorrow morning, 
How can I choose the most striking 
Melina Mercouri and Pierre Vaneck

directed by Jules Dassin. 
moments? Well, here are two that come to 
mind. 
First of all, there was the Greek sailor | 
met in the docks at Genoa in Italy. It was five 
o'clock in the morning. He was heading back 
to a merchant ship with some other sailors. 
My heart started pounding. Any Greek you 
met at that time immediately became a com- 
rade, a brother. I went up to talk to them. I 
wanted to discuss the situation in Greece, 
invite them to a meeting we were holding that 
evening. We hadn't exchanged a word when 
their officer arrived and ordered them to 
return to their ship immediately. My sailor 
went off with the others. I just stood there, 
my arms stretched out to nothing, suddenly 
feeling very alone. But then just before he dis- 
appeared from view, without even turning 
round, my sailor put his hand behind his back 
and gave me the victory sign. I cried for joy. 
The second memory is very different, 
because you must realize that I wasn't popular 
with all Greeks. Far from it. In America, 
Europe too, there were Greeks who would 
insult me, boo me, threaten me. How can | 
forget the demonstrators who shouted under 
my window that I was a communist bitch, or 
the person who rang me up to tell me—in 
Greek, what's more—that “the colonels had 
stopped 50,000 communists who were getting 
ready to invade Greece from Yugoslavia and 
Bulgaria”, before going on to add that it would 
be just as easy to “stop me” too. 
Those two incidents show two faces of the 
tragedy of the dictatorship. Unscrupulous 
colonels, in Greece as elsewhere, can cast a pall 
 
over a whole people, seemingly for ever. The 
Greek people seemed to have been reduced to 
silence. But my sailor's gesture showed how 
deceptive the silence could be. I've learned 
since then never to believe that a people is 
happy with its government just because it is 
silent. Silence never indicates contentment. 
Contentment is voluble, noisy. Silence can 
only be imposed by force. 
The other incident made me reflect above 
all on the fragility of human intelligence. How 
could anyone believe such an obvious absur- 
dity as that story of 50,000 communist 
invaders? But leaving the” details aside, the 
question is still relevant today. How is it that 
people can be conditioned to the point of 
losing their sense of logic, of applauding the 
very people who are tormenting them? It can’t 
all be explained in terms of economic or polit- 
ical self-interest. There were plenty of sincere 
people among the colonels’ backers who stood 
to gain nothing from the dictatorship. . . . I 
have to admit that I still haven't found a satis- 
factory answer to the question. 
Wm One gets the impression that you gradu- 
ally lost interest in the theatre and the cinema 
after becoming involved in politics. . . . 
— Wrong! I didn't lose interest. It was the 
cinema and theatre producers who lost interest 
in me. I got fewer and fewer offers of work. 
[was living dangerously, under constant threat 
of attack. I was travelling from country to 
country, and the insurance companies didn't 
want to know about me. 
W Eventually the colonels fell, but you stayed 
in politics. . . 
— When we went back to Greece, after the 
fall of the colonels, I hesitated for a bit. Should 
[ stay in politics full time? Then Andreas 
Papandreou rang up to ask me to be a candi- 
date in the legislative elections, for the Piraeus, 
the second district. It was a difficult consti- 
tuency for a woman. The voters were sailors, 
miners, macho types. I pointed out that I 
would feel more comfortable in Athens, 
where, as | said earlier, my grandfather had 
been mayor and my father had been a deputy. 
Papandreou won me over by his reply. He 
said, “Melina, you celebrated Piraeus in Never 
on Sunday and made it known around the

world. In Piraeus you'll be able to smash the 
right and the left as well.” I put forward my 
candidacy. 
I campaigned in the same way that | 
rehearse parts in the theatre. Furiously, but 
with pleasure. I used to go into cafés and play 
backgammon with the old men. That 
improved my standing, because I used to win. 
I campaigned door to door, and people would 
gather groups together in their homes, any- 
thing from ten to thirty people. I immersed 
myself in their everyday problems, which 
were huge. There had been terrible rains that 
year, and there were serious drainage 
problems, all the more urgent because the 
buildings didn’t have very solid foundations 
and the state of the roads was deplorable. 
Gradually these people’s problems became my 
own. One day I even took to the streets with 
them against the police. 
There were five candidates for the seat, 
and I won it in the first round of voting. 
still pursued my theatrical career. Dassin 
staged Brecht’s Threepenny Opera, and it was 
a huge success. Then I went to Salonika to play 
Medea for two months. That was the role of 
my life, the greatest role ever written for the 
theatre. It was my greatest success, 100. Medea 
was the reward for all my efforts for the 
theatre, for the cinema, for Greece. 
After we won the legislative elections on 
18 October 1980, Andreas Papandreou asked 
me to become Minister of Culture. It was a 
new challenge. I was caught up in the general 
euphoria, I thought that at last the world 
belonged to us, so I accepted. Those were eight 
happy years. We made mistakes and we paid 
for them. But we also achieved a great deal. 
W Being a minister was a new role for you 
to play—one you were thrown into without 
any chance to rebearse. . . . 
— There weren't any rehearsals, that's for sure. 
But the field the ministry covered was familiar 
to me; it included theatre, music, cinema. 
Which is to say that I wasn’t entirely an 
intruder. There was archaeology as well, cer- 
tainly. But for that I surrounded myself with 
competent people. 
When I took up office, the ministry of 
Culture was a small one. Then its responsi- 
bilities were extended to include athletics, 
sport, youth, Greeks living abroad. . . . It 
became a very big ministry. To cope, I had 
to decentralize. I decentralized like mad. 
For the ministry people and my visitors 
as well, I was the barefoot minister, I never 
wore shoes. | was also a minister who never 
received people sitting at a desk. Desks create 
a distance between people. So I had a table

there, side by side. It was strange how much 
easier conversations became. 
® Was it difficult to make up your mind? 
— All the more difficult when the competing 
projects were good ones, and it was only 
because of a lack of resources that one had to 
choose between them. It’s horrible to abandon 
a project because you don’t have enough 
money to carry it through. But you have to 
force yourself to decide. 
® Did that cause problems for you? 
— Yes, of course. But that's the kind of 
problem I can stand. In the office, I never let 
any of my regrets show. It was only when I 
got back home that I would sound off, and 
it was my friends who suffered from my bad 
temper. But I never went back on a decision 
once it was taken. 
® Don’t you ever feel that a life as full and 
diverse as yours can be a heavy load to carry? 
— Oh no! Just the opposite! If I hadn’t become 
involved in politics, I would now just be a has- 
been of stage and screen. That would be awful. 
I’m very happy that people don’t talk about 
me in the past tense. I'm still “Melina” for 
them, just as I always have been. It even goes

further than that. Because at a time of very 
great distress I expressed their lust for life, 
because I loved them then and still love them 
now with all my heart, they sculpted a mask 
of me and engraved on it: “Our Melina”. 
They know I'm “their” Melina. For me, that’s 
a source of very great happiness. =

HY should the history of al-Andalus—the eight cen- 
turies during which the Iberian peninsula lived under Muslim 
influence—seem to many people today to be that of a golden 
age? Why is it attracting growing interest from modern 
scholars, one of whom has even gone so far as to talk of 
it as a “paradise lost”. 
The exceptional coexistence of three cultures—Istamic, 
Christian and Jewish—which was a salient feature of al- 
Andalus during part of its history occurred within a historical 
context marked by asperities and outbreaks of violence. From 
its beginnings in the eighth century until the fall of Granada, 
the last bastion of the Muslim presence, in the fifteenth, the 
history of al-Andalus was complex and tumultuous. 
But it was exceptional all the same. Al-Andalus seems 
to have been a very special place where groups of people 
met, talked and worked together, whereas had they lived 
elsewhere at that time they would have been locked in hatred. 
In spite of constant tensions, a mysterious and lasting 
accord was made between a place, the people who lived there, 
and the ideal they tried to put into practice—that of tolerance. 
This is the extraordinary achievement of al-Andalus. 
Unique in its time, this coexistence enriched not only 
the Iberian peninsula but also the Maghrib and Europe, in 
ways that are only now beginning to be fully appreciated. 
Through al-Andalus the foundations of Greek culture, and 
elements of philosophical and scientific knowledge from 
India, Persia and China were transmitted to Europe. This 
Arab Spain linked Orient and Occident, past and future, 
Antiquity and the Renaissance. 
The present issue is an attempt, not to make a defini- 
tive statement about a remarkable episode in world history 
but to show some of its many facets. We have focused largely 
on one period, that of the caliphate of Cordoba, the brilliant 
city which was the setting for the golden age of al-Andalus.

O. of the most striking features of the 
Muslim presence in Spain is the enduring 
influence it exerted over Iberian Christianity. In 
times of peace, the relationship between the 
Christian and Muslim kingdoms on the penin-

Henri Terrasse has called “a sometimes cordial 
symbiosis”. There were Christian and Jewish 
communities within Islamic Spain, just as Jews

lingualism, and shared customs and festivities 
the Islamic and Christian worlds. From the 
earliest days of the Arab-Berber conquest, an 
extraordinary ethnic mixing took place in al- 
Andalus. In the Islamic melting-pot, Arabs, 
Berbers brought up in the Arab culture and 
Christians, whether share-croppers or high-born 
landed proprietors, intermarried with one 
another and with the urban middle classes to 
form a fairly homogeneous whole. Sustained con- 
tact between Muslims and Spaniards obliged the 
conquerors to learn Romance, a derivative of the 
Iberian Latin that was the language of the 
country, and one which the Mozarabs or

knew pre-Islamic poetry and took up the study 
of Arabic literature. 
Andalusian Jews spoke Romance and Arabic 
in addition to Hebrew. Installed in Spain since 
Roman times, Jewish communities gave proof of 
their loyalty to the Umayyad dynasty and were 
not persecuted. Eight generations of Jews in al- 
Andalus were to benefit from the tolerance and 
protection of the Umayyad rulers. 
    
An intellectual 
and linguistic ferment 
A substantial proportion of Spain’s Islamic popu- 
lation was bilingual. The Muslims of al-Andalus 
used Romance colloquially and even in their 
palaces. ‘Abd al-Rahman III, caliph of Cordoba 
from 912 until 961 and himself the son of a Chris- 
tian captive, switched easily between Arabic and 
Romance when talking to his courtiers. Imperme- 
able to fanaticism, he displayed exceptional toler- 
ance and open-mindedness. 
Two examples of his magnanimity are par- 
ticularly striking. Rabi b. Zayd, baptised as 
Recemundo, was a cultured Christian of Cérdoba 
who worked as a secretary in the offices of the 
Umayyad chancellery and spoke Arabic as well 
as Latin. The caliph sent him as a legate to the

Arabic culture was evident in the work that 
resulted. The Judaeo-Spanish poet Dunash ben 
Labrat even persuaded his Jewish compeers to 
adopt Arabic metres for their Hebrew verses, 
while the brilliant philologist Hayyud) rivalled 
the Arab grammarians. 
In the Spain of three religions, the Jews were 
notable for their multilingualism. Spanish Jews 
acted as interpreters between Christians and 
Muslims. The degree to which the Jewish com- 
munity in the emirate of Granada was accultu- 
rated has been frequently remarked upon.

in-law Yehuda. Reviving a tradition set in the 
twelfth century by the famous theologian and 
doctor Ibn Maymun (Moses Maimonides), several 
of whose works were composed in Arabic, the 
last Jewish poet of Granada, Se’adiyah ibn Danan, 
wrote his grammatical works in Arabic. When 
Malaga fell to the Catholic Kings in 1487, it was 
noted that several Jewish women emerged from 
the town speaking Arabic and wearing Muslim 
dress. 
  
The Castilian language borrowed much from 
Arabic. There were elaborate linguistic contacts, 
and many Arabic words entered the Iberian lan- 
guages in the Middle Ages. The influence still sur- 
vives in modern Spanish, particularly in the 
specialized vocabularies of irrigation, fortifica- 
tion, civics, urban life, commerce, botany and 
food. 
The transmission 
of knowledge 
In terms of cultural exchange, Islamic Spain was 
a link in the transmission of Hellenistic science 
and Greek philosophy to the Christian West. In 
Toledo throughout the twelfth century, scholars 
brought together on the initiative of the arch- 
bishop, Don Raimundo, translated the most 
influential works of Arab culture into Latin, 
notably treatises on astronomy, medicine, physics, 
natural history and philosophy. The translators 
of Toledo spread through medieval Europe the 
works of Aristotle, Galen and Hippocrates, with 
commentaries by thinkers as distinguished as 
Avicenna and Averroés.

A century later, in 1251, the Infante Alfonso 
of Castile, the son of Ferdinand III the Holy, had 
the famous collection of fables known as the 
Kalila wa-Dimna translated from Arabic into 
Castilian. In the following centuries this was to 
have a pronounced influence on Western litera- 
ture, notably on the Roman de Renart, on Boc- 
caccio’s Decameron, and on the Fables of La 
Fontaine.

A model 
of civilization 
The pattern of life in Christian Spain was strongly 
influenced by Arab civilization. From the early 
Middle Ages onwards, the refined customs of the 
Muslim towns penetrated the little Christian 
courts of the north of the Iberian peninsula. They 
brought the aristocracy a taste for luxury and a 
sense of comfort. 
Later, Muslim ways were adopted by the 
Christian élites of Castile and Aragon. The 
enthusiasm for things Arabic and Jewish shown by 
Pedro I of Castile (1350-69) is often quoted by way 
of example. In 1418, King Alfonso V of Aragon

wore a silk-bordered toque and gold-embroidered

A European traveller, Leon of Rosmithal, 
Baron of Bohemia, was astonished at the welcome 
he received at Burgos in the palace of a powerful 
lord when he visited Spain in 1466. Among the 
Castilian count’s entourage were several women 
dressed in Muslim fashion, and he was offered 
Arab-style food. In Segovia, King Henry IV of 
Castile surrounded himself with Muslims and 
Jews. Rosmithal recorded that he ate, drank and 
dressed in the Muslim manner. 
Shared games 
and festivals 
Some games were popular in both communities. 
Chess, known in Arabic as skitrand), was 
introduced to Cérdoba in the ninth century by 
the musician Ziryab. It won great popularity in 
al-Andalus, and was soon introduced to the 
kingdom of Le4n under the name of ajedrez. In 
King Alfonso X’s reign, it was the favourite 
pastime of Castilians. The king and his wife, 
Queen Violante of Aragon, shared their passion 
for the game with knights and ladies of the court, 
soldiers and monks, nobles and peasants, Muslims 
and Jews. 
Muslims and Christians also both staged 
jousting tournaments. Lists were set up in the 
main squares and gardens of Granada, and even 
in the Alhambra itself. In the Jaén region on the 
Feast of St. John, the Andalusian nobility fer- 
vently competed in the juego de cafias, a sport at 
which the Muslims also excelled. A delegation of 
the King of Granada achieved great success at the 
court of John II of Castile by practising this form 
of jousting before the monarch. 
Besides the specifically Muslim festivals, two 
seasonal festivals fixed by the Julian calendar 
which indicated the different periods of the fiscal 
and agricultural year, were celebrated in 
Andalusia. They were known by their Persian 
names: Nayruz was the Iranian New Year, while 
Mahradjan fell on 24 June. In the towns and the 
countryside of al-Andalus, people of all social 
classes commemorated these days with entertain- 
ments and merry-making. 
There were carnival disguises and celebrations 
in the Andalusian towns just as there were in 
Christian Spain. In Andalusian poetry of the 
eleventh and twelfth centuries there are frequent 
references to Christian religious festivals, espe- 
cially Easter, known as fish. 
As early as the twelfth century, the Muslims

of al-Andalus bought pastries to celebrate the 
Christian New Year and Maundy Thursday. In 
the second half of the thirteenth century, Andalu- 
sians began to celebrate Christmas and New Year 
in imitation of their Christian neighbours. On 
1 January by the Julian calendar, the day they 
called Yannayr, Andalusians gave each other 
presents and cooked raised pastries shaped like 
towns, called mada’in, thereby anticipating the 
later Christian custom of making Twelfth-cakes 
for Twelfth Night, though without small gifts 
hidden within the pastry casing. u

Trees blossomed in Cordoba; refined pleasures, mag- 
nificence, gallantry reigned at the court of the 
Moorish kings. Tournaments and jousting may 
have been invented by these Arabs. They had 
theatres and public performances which, crude 
though they were, still demonstrated that other 
peoples were less polished than these Muslims: Cor- 
doba was the only country in the West where 
Geometry, Astronomy, Chemistry, Medicine were 
cultivated. Sancho the Fat, King of Leon, was 
obliged to go to Cordoba in 956 to put himself in 
the hands of an Arab doctor who, invited to attend 
the monarch, asked him rather to come to him.

The social and historical backcloth to the process 
T. periods between 711 and 1086 AD in the 
Islamic territories of al-Andalus and between 1085 
and 1370 in Christian Spain were golden ages of 
social and cultural coexistence. What religious and 
legal foundations were they based on? 
Judaism never defined a social status for other 
religions, since until the Babylonian diaspora it 
considered itself the only monotheistic faith. 
Thereafter, when it lost its political independence, 
its own social status became identified with that 
of the Jewish people. 
At first Christianity too had no status as an 
independent social entity. Saint Paul directed 
Christians to accept the Roman Empire, to pay 
taxes to it, obey its magistrates and observe its

of cultural give-and-take in al-Andalus 
laws, holding that the power it exercised was 
God-given. It was only after the conversion of 
Constantine’s day, when Christianity became the 
civic religion of the Empire, and the Empire was 
Christianized by the Church, that the tolerance 
early Christianity had shown was gradually 
eroded. 
In the Middle Ages, Christians came to con- 
sider Jews as deniers of the faith because they had 
refused to regard Jesus of Nazareth as the 
promised Messiah, and as deicides insofar as they 
were held collectively responsible for his death. 
As for Islam, medieval Christians at first consi- 
dered it a fraud and its prophet, Muhammad, an 
impostor. This view was only gradually modified 
as a result of cultural coexistence on the Iberian 
peninsula. 
Islam, on the other hand, took as a starting- 
point the fundamental unity of the Faith, as 
revealed to the first man, reiterated by all the 
prophets, and socially codified by divine mes- 
sengers, notably by Moses in the Torah for the 
Jews and by Jesus in the Gospels for Christians. 
Muhammad was then sent in his turn because 
these religious laws had become distorted and 
were incomplete. For Muslims, Muhammad is the 
final messenger, the seal set on the work of the 
prophets, and the Qur’an is the true and defini- 
tive revelation of the Faith. 
Muslims consequently considered Jews and 
Christians as People of the Book (Ah! al-Kitab), 
whose incomplete systems of belief nonetheless 
allowed them to know and venerate God, to 
understand and obey His commandments, and to 
merit eternal salvation. 
People of the pact 
Following the principles spelled out in the 
Qur’an, Islam gave full recognition to only one 
social grouping, the umma, the community of the 
faithful, whose members are theoretically equal.

But the faith expanded into lands that were 
socially highly organized and inhabited largely 
by Christians and Zoroastrians, with Jewish and 
Buddhist minorities. Al-Andalus, with its 
Mozarabs and Jews, was one of these lands. All 
those who possessed a revealed Book and who 
agreed to a position of subordination by signing a 
pact became “tributaries”. There was no legal 
problem where Christians and Jews were con-. 
cerned. Zoroastrians, initially at least, were granted 
a similar status, even though they were not con- 
sidered to have a revealed Book. 
Legally speaking, the tributaries did not 
belong to the umma, but enjoyed protected status 
as dhimmis or “people of the pact”, and were 
implicitly treated as the members of another 
soctety, which did not exist in political terms but 
whose religious structure assumed responsibility 
for administering the tolerated social rights. 
The relationship between the umma and the 
abl al-Kitab was based on the concept of a pact 
which could be either expressed or tacit. In the 
Christian context, the parties to the pact were, 
on the one hand, the Christian nobility and 
bishops, and on the other the caliph. The accord 
held good not just for the Umayyad rulers of al- 
Andalus but also for those of the taifas, the petty 
kingdoms that flourished after the collapse of the 
caliphate. 
When, from the ninth century on, the Chris- 
tian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula began to 
englobe sizeable Jewish and Islamic 
communities—the latter of which were known 
as mudéjares—the Christian kings took up the 
Islamic policy of offering protected status. As the 
incarnation of the link between the different com- 
munities, the kings of Castile and Leén even 
assumed, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, 
the title of “Lord of the Three Religions”. 
A unique social fabric 
The way in which medieval Islamic society was 
organized does not easily lend itself to forms of 
class analysis practised by modern social science. 
In any case, the cohabitation of Muslims with 
dhimmis (Mozarabs and Jews) took different 
forms in the different social strata within each 
community, and the relationships that were estab- 
lished did not always exactly coincide with those 
prescribed by law. 
Social cohabitation and cultural coexistence 
worked to the advantage of the Islamic 
aristocracy, the kbassa, which consisted of the 
ruling family and the upper ranks of the military 
and civil authorities, and of the freedmen and 
clients of the monarch. The notables of Islamic 
society (a’yan)—men of learning, successful 
craftsmen, merchants and great land-owners—also 
benefited from the arrangement. The masses, on 
the other hand, found it hard to live alongside 
Mozarabs and Jews. 
Among the Mozarabs, those who had the 
closest cultural connections with Muslims were 
the nobility, a class composed of the descendants 
of the Visigothic comites, the upper ranks of the 
clergy and some scholars. We know from the 
writings of such strong champions of the 21

Mozarabic identity as Alvaro and Eulogio of Cor- 
doba that they associated with Muslims, shared 
their literary tastes and fashions, and even took 
pride in speaking good Arabic. 
As for the Jews, the guides (rabbis and 
scholars), rich merchants, traders and financiers 
also associated with the Islamic and Mozarabic 
upper classes, but had almost no dealings with 
the lower social orders. Cultural coexistence 
between Jews and Muslims was, however, more 
tangible than that between Muslims and 
Mozarabs, because the Jews had accepted Arabic 
as their language of thought and culture. 
The law known as the figh maliki proved an 
effective instrument for regulating the relations 
between the different social groups. It had origi- 
nated in certain traditional Arab usages dating 
from the pre-Islamic period that reflected the 
influence of Roman jurisprudence and had 
provided a basis for the “canonical” principles 
of Islam. 
Craftsmen, shopkeepers, merchants and small 
landowners of the Mozarabic and Jewish com- 
munities were able to maintain their traditional 
way of life without much difficulty. Obviously, 
though, this process of convergence broke down 
whenever religious disputes arose. 
Patterns of coexistence 
Cultural coexistence took many forms, weaving 
a pattern of contact and tradition, creation and 
rediscovery. It was of decisive importance in the 
eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, when the legal 
and ideological principles that gave it its justifi- 
cation were working satisfactorily. 
The contact between external influences,

notably Islamic cultural imports from the Orient, 
and intellectual life in Muslim Spain, was 
genuinely extraordinary, as a glance at the art, 
astronomy, mathematics, medicine and thought 
of the caliphate shows. The cultural legacy of al- 
Andalus is impressive in its scale and splendour 
even though, for obvious reasons, Mozarab cul- 
ture was closed to some aspects of Islamic 
thought. Jewish thinking, on the other hand, was 
so open to Muslim influences that two parallel 
yet communicating currents are apparent in 
Andalusian philosophy: on the one hand the 
Arab-Islamic tradition of Avempace, Ibn Tufayl 
and Averroés, on the other the Juddeo-Arab 
heritage of Ibn Gabirol and Maimonides, thinkers 
who used Arabic as their medium of expression. 
There were certainly differences between 
Islamic and Jewish culture, but they did not 
extend to such common and universal fields as 
astronomy, mathematics, science, medicine, logic 
and metaphysics. One example, taken from my 
own speciality, philosophy, will suffice to show

the creative possibilities that sprang from cultural 
coexistence. 
Comparisons have often been made between 
the Summa contra gentiles of St. Thomas Aquinas, 
Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed and Averroés’s 
Incoberence of the Incoberence, a rebuttal of al- 
Ghazali’s work The Incoberence of the Philosophers. 
It is undeniable that the three works are unique 
of their kind and in their time. The similarities 
between them lie in certain common themes of 
medieval thought, in the use of certain formal 
procedures, and in their method. 
It is true that the Incoberence of the Incober- 
ence cannot be understood without reference to 
specifically Islamic ideas; similarly, the Guide of 
the Perplexed draws on the rabbinical tradition, 
and the Summa contra gentiles on the Christian 
inheritance. Yet all three heritages share a 
common link with Greek thought, but not as it 
had been recreated by Islamic philosophy. 
The relationship between the three works is 
a complex one, full of reciprocal influences. Two

Islamic thought at the 
Autonomous University of 
Madrid and formerly taught at 
the Universities of Granada 
and Salamanca. Among his 
many published works are a 
2-volume history of thought in

of them were written by Andalusian thinkers, 
and even the third—the Summa—would not have 
been possible without the contribution of the 
ideas of Avicenna and Averroés, passed on via 
translations made in Toledo. After Aristotle, 
Averroés is the author most frequently cited by 
St. Thomas. 
Cultural coexistence of this kind was made 
possible by religious and legal principles that were 
far-reaching in their implications even though 
they were often transgressed in practice. The 
Andalusian experience was an exceptional 
moment in history, probably unique in its own 
time and rarely matched in any other. Its most 
worthy, notable and creative feature was that 
cohabitation and coexistence were based on reli- 
gious and legal principles. Our own era, which 
prides itself on the liberalism and universality of 
its ideas, offers few examples to match it. W 
A new society 
In Spain regeneration came not from the north, with 
the barbarian hordes: it came from the south, with 
the Arab conquerors. . . . It was a civilizing expe- 
dition far more than a conquest. . . . With it came 
to us that young, robust, alert culture which made 
astonishingly rapid progress and triumphed so soon 
after its birth; that civilization which, created by 
the enthusiasm of the Prophet, assimilated the best 
of Judaism and Byzantine science, and which also 
brought with it the great Hindu tradition, the relics 
of Persia, and many things borrowed from mys- 
terious China. 
It was the Orient penetrating into Europe, not 
like Dariuses and Xerxes, through a Greece which 
repulsed them in order to save its freedom, but 
through the other extremity, through Spain which, 
a slave to theologian kings and warlike bishops, wel- 
comed its invaders with open arms, 
Within two years the latter had seized what 
took seven centuries to recapture from them. It was 


### 90305: The Roots of coexistence

not an invasion that imposed itself by force of arms, 
it was a new society which plunged its vigorous 
roots on all sides. The principle of freedom of con- 
science, the cornerstone of the true grandeur of 
nations, was dear to them. In the cities of which 
they were masters, they accepted the church of the 
Christian and the synagogue of the Jew. 
From the eighth to the fifteenth century, there 
developed the finest and richest civilization of 
medieval Europe.

Arab empire was ruled from Damascus in Syria 
by al-Walid I, sixth caliph of the House of 
Umayya. From Kairouan in the country now 
called Tunisia, al-Walid’s governor, Musa ibn 
Nusayr, was pursuing a policy of westward 
expansion spearheaded by his Berber freedman 
Tariq, commander of some 7,000 Berbers from 
North Africa. Before the end of the spring of 93 
Tariq was on the rock from which Gibraltar takes 
its name—]Jabal Tariq, “Mount Tariq”. 
Tariq’s landing was the first step on a long, 
hard road which led 200 years later to the estab- 
lishment of the caliphate of Cordoba by a scion 
of the House of Umayya. The second step was 
the conquest of the lands beyond Gibraltar. With 
his Berber troops, greatly reinforced from North 
Africa, Tariq soon defeated the Visigothic King 
Rodrigo, already harassed in the north by the 
Basques. The tottering, unpopular Visigothic 
regime was now doomed. The fall of its capital, 
Toledo, to the north was followed in October 
711 by the capture of Cordoba in the south.

conquest, he had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar 
with some 18,000, mainly Arab, troops. His rela- 
tionship with Tariq was strained, but this did not 
prevent them from pursuing their common 
objective of conquest. By 714 Musa and Tariq had

Muslim Spain. 
Like Rome, the Cordoba of the Umayyad

In 750 the ‘Abbasid revolution in the east swept 
away the Syrian Umayyad caliphate and savagely

latter, ‘Abd al-Rahman, grandson of the caliph 
Hisham, cheated his hunters of their prey and 
embarked on a perilous odyssey that took him 
to Morocco, where he won the protection of his 
mother’s Berber tribe. After careful thought he 
decided to go to Spain, banking on support from 
elements owing loyalty to the Umayyads. Once 
on Andalusian soil, he played his hand and 
won—despite some militant opposition to his 
cause. In May 756, his final battle won, he entered 
the provincial palace of Cordoba. There, in the 
city’s mosque, he led the Eriday prayer and was 
proclaimed emir of al-Andalus. A young man in 
his mid-twenties at the time, he was to reign for 
over thirty years as the first of five Umayyad 
rulers of Spain to bear the name ‘Abd al-Rahman.

The establishment of the emirate was only 
the start of a gruelling climb to power whose 
complexity is explained by the pattern of Andalu- 
sian society at that time. Al-Andalus was a 
country in which Arab and Berber immigrants 
had, at different times and under differing con- 
ditions, settled among the great mass of the 
Hispano-Roman population. Many Hispano- 
Romans had converted to Islam and, as neo- 
Muslims (muwalladun), become completely 
Arabized. Yet there remained a large Christian 
Hispano-Roman community of Mozarabs—a 
term taken from the Spanish form of an Arabic 
word meaning ““Arabizer”. As well as their own 
language, the Mozarabs spoke Arabic and adopted 
many Arab customs. Finally, there were the 
native Iberian Jews. 
The Mozarabs and Jews caused ‘Abd al- 
Rahman no trouble. They were only too glad to 
be rid of Visigothic tyranny and to live in peace. 
The Arabs, however, were to turn any dreams 
of peace he may have cherished into something 
of a nightmare born of tribal feuds, jealousies and 
grievances, which led to sedition, armed conflict 
and open rebellion. Moreover, the Berbers 
resented not being treated as equals by their Arab 
fellow-Muslims, whose traditions and culture 
were quite different from their own. 
And so, the prospect of revolts and uprisings 
was very real. The emir perceived the risk of 
siding with any single group within al-Andalus. 
He could count on unselfish loyalty from no one, 
not even from his Umayyad relations and clients. 
And so he recruited a highly disciplined profes- 
sional army of Berber mercenaries and slave

troops from Europe north of the Pyrenees. This 
was the only answer to internal turmoil and 
external danger from the Christian north. 
‘Abd al-Rahman was a Syrian, and the 
administrative system he created in Muslim Spain 
was in the Syrian Umayyad tradition. At its 
centre he made his own office of emir a unifying 
symbol, and in the provinces he appointed loyal 
and cdpable governors. 
When he died in 788, he could be said to have 
proved himself an extraordinarily able statesman, 
whose greatest achievement had been to pacify 
and defend his realm. Today we see him as the 
founder of a dynasty that lasted more than twice 
as long as that of his Syrian ancestors and became 
a light that far outshone the brightest lights in 
contemporary Europe. 
An eventful history 
All his successors sought, with varying degrees 
of success, to consolidate their political and mili- 
tary strength in a situation that was fraught with 
danger. 
In many areas of the Iberian peninsula com- 
munications and transport militated against firm 
central control. Local notables, appointed as 
governors to uphold Umayyad authority in 
regions far from Cordoba, acted as powerful over- 
lords serving not their ruler’s interests but their 
own, and often taking the opportunity to rebel. 
This was particularly the case in the “Marches”, 
sprawling tracts of nomansland separating the 
Christian realms to the north from the emirate’s 
Muslim lands in the south. 
The attitudes of the neo-Muslims and 
Mozarabs also changed, leading to insurrection 
and disorder. Cordoba itself was the home of cer- 
tain Muslim political and religious malcontents. 25

Umayyads founded In the 
10th century near Cordoba. 
26 
At the same time, the emirate was saddled with 
the perennial need to protect its northern borders 
against Christian invaders. 
During the reign of al-Hakam [I (796-822) 
there was a spate of troubles: disaffection in 
Toledo, savagely crushed in 797 by the massacre 
of its mainly neo-Muslim notables; the mass 
uprising in 818 of the so-called Suburb 
(“Arraval”’) of Cordoba, encouraged by disgrun- 
tled Muslim religious leaders and ruthlessly put 
down; protracted campaigns in the Marches of 
Saragossa, Toledo and Mérida against recalcitrant 
leaders; and, finally, the permanent loss of Barce- 
lona to the Christians. 
The emirate faced two other thorny 
problems. First, the initially peaceful Mozarabs 
became involved in a serious religious protest 
begun by Christian fanatics seeking martyrdom 
through public denunciation of the Prophet 
Muhammad. The protest, starting late in the reign 
of the kind and tolerant ruler ‘Abd al-Rahman 
II (822-852), led to tensions and conflicts which 
neither the prince nor many of his Christian sub- 
jects relished. Secondly and more importantly, 
the reign of Muhammad I (852-886), witnessed 
in 880 a determined attempt by Ibn Hafsun, a 
rebel of neo-Muslim descent and later an apostate, 
to make himself ruler of al-Andalus from his 
centre of power, Bobastro, in the south of Spain. 
His insurrection, which commanded wide non- 
Arab support, dragged on for almost fifty years. 
Largely because of al-Hakam I's draconian 
measures to enforce peace, his son ‘Abd al- 
Rahman II, a very able monarch, enjoyed some 
thirty years of relative calm and prosperity, 
marked by significant improvements in the 
administrative system and a sharp rise in stan- 
dards of culture and civilization. The emir’s 
enthusiastic patronage of music and the arts was 
matched only by his zealous preoccupation with 
the creation of a strong navy capable of out- 
classing Norse squadrons that had found his 
shores a gateway to rich pickings. 
An exceptional ruler 
The most disastrous period in the emirate’s his- 
tory came with the reign of ‘Abd Allah (888-912), 
whose legacy to his grandson and successor ‘Abd 
al-Rahman III (912-961) was nothing but an 
empty treasury and the general disintegration of 
Umayyad Spain. This legacy of leaden metal was 
to be miraculously transmuted into gold by the 
alchemy of a ruler who at the time of his acces- 
sion was barely in his twenties. Endowed with 
patience, emotional stability and maturity of 
judgement beyond his years, the young ‘Abd al- 
Rahman combined the energy and stamina of 
youth with political acumen and unswerving 
devotion to duty. As much European as Arab— 
his mother and paternal grandmother were of 
Christian stock—he was an observant Muslim but 
no fanatic. Throughout his reign he adopted, 
whenever possible, a generally tolerant policy 
towards Mozarabs and Jews.

### IGNORE

  
Upon his succession, ‘Abd al-Rahman 
brooked no opposition to his authority. 
Governors who refused or ignored his request for 
allegiance had to yield either to diplomatic per- 
suasion or to force. In 913 he imposed his rule 
on the important city of Seville. The next year 
saw the start of a long war of attrition against Ibn 
Hafsun of Bobastro, the master of much of 
southern Spain. The struggle, continued by his 
sons after his death in 917, ended only in 928. 
It was not until 932 that the pacification of al- 
Andalus was complete, with the submission of 
the Algarve, eastern Spain, Toledo, Saragossa and 
other important strongholds. 


### 90306: The Rise of the Umayyad dynasty in Spain

The apogee of the caliphate 
The most memorable event in Spanish Umayyad 
history took place in 929: the establishment of 
the caliphate. In proclaiming himself caliph, ‘Abd 
al-Rahman III assumed, in addition to the caliphal 
title “Commander of the Faithful”, the throne- 
name “Defender (al-Nasir) of God’s Religion”. 
The decision to revive the caliphate, lost by the 
Syrian Umayyads in 750, was largely his response 
to the growing power and prestige of the Shi'ite 
Fatimids, who had proclaimed their own 
caliphate in North Africa and were coming dan- 
gerously near to al-Andalus. 
When he died in 961, al-Nasir had enforced 
respect for the frontiers of a country united under

The field of intelligence 
While the West saw the soft, lunar reflection of God, 
the East and Arab and Jewish Spain contemplated 
him in his fertile Sun, in His creative power which 
pours forth His gifts in torrents. Spain was the field 
of combat. Where the Christians appeared, there 
was desert; where the Arabs were, water and life 
spurted forth on all sides, streams flowed, the earth 
grew green, became a garden of flowers. And the 
field of intelligence also flourished. What would we 
barbarians have been without them? Shameful to 
say, it was not until the eighteenth century that our 
Treasury adopted Arabic numerals, without which 
it 1s impossible to carry out the smallest calculation.

a strong central government. He had made al- 
Andalus second to none in the Western world, 
prospering thanks to a thriving domestic 
economy and a lucrative network of pan- 
Mediterranean trade. Cérdoba, with about ten 
times the population of Paris, far outshone any 
other capital in Europe. In reputation and pres- 
tige, it surpassed Baghdad and rivalled Byzantine 
Constantinople, through diplomatic exchanges 
with which the caliph had ensured that his realm 
was seen as its equal. European envoys from 
France, Germany, Italy and elsewhere had eagerly 
made their way to his court. In addition to mis- 
sions from North Africa, part of which he actu- 
ally ruled, he had received delegations from Chris- 
tian Spain, some of whose rulers he had made his 
tributaries. 
His successor, al-Hakam II (961-976), was able 
to preserve his father’s heritage of peace and 
prosperity. One of the biggest and best libraries 
of Islam was born of his passion for books and 
learning—a passion which also compelled him to 
promote scholarship, both religious and secular 
(astronomy and mathematics, for example), and 
to provide some education for the poor. In the 
Great Mosque of Cordoba, which stands to this 
day as a lasting memorial to Umayyad glory, he 
expressed his deep piety and refined artistic taste 
by almost doubling its size through the addition 
of a most pleasing extension and enhancing its 
prayer niche with ornamentation so exquisite as 
to make it a masterpiece. 
Al-Hakam’s death was the death of true 
Umayyad rule. The reign of his son Hisham II 
(976-1013)—a mere boy at the time of his 
accession—led to the caliphate’s slide into extinc- 
tion in 1031. | 217

The glittering artistic heritage of the tenth-century caliphate in Iberia 
B..ow: the foundation of the Umayyad 
caliphate by ‘Abd al-Rahman III at Cordoba in 
929, the cultural and scientific development of 
Muslim Spain had been that of a modest offshoot 
of a simple provincial Arab Muslim culture that 
was highly dependent on Oriental Islam. 
Under the caliphate a cultural flowering came 
about, largely because Cordoba became increas- 
ingly important politically. The city was the 
centre of a strong and respected power which 
sought, consciously or unconsciously, to equal 
the prestige of the ‘Abbasid caliphate of Baghdad 
at the height of its splendour and to create in al- 
Andalus the conditions for similar achievements. 
The Andalusians did not aspire to create a new 
civilization but to imitate or outstrip Baghdad in 
every field. 
We must beware of the chronological errors 
that are often made by those who attribute en 
bloc to the Cordoban caliphate all the cultural 
achievements of the Andalusian civilization. To 
take one example, the oldest and not least original 
parts of the Great Mosque of Cordoba were 
completed under the emirate, not during the 
caliphate. It was only after the caliphate, at the 
time of the taifas (principalities governed by petty 
kings) that Andalusian poetry attained its greatest 
refinement. Some of the best-known monuments 
of Muslim Andalusian art, such as the Giralda 
(the minaret of the Almoravid mosque in Seville) 
and the Alhambra palace, built by the sultans of 
Granada from the late thirteenth century 
onwards, date from long after the time of the 
caliphs. 
All the same, the most remarkable achieve- 
ments of Arab Andalusian culture do bear the 
imprint of the relatively short-lived caliphate, 
which only lasted around a century. 
An influential 
capital 
In the tenth century Cérdoba became one of the 
leading political and cultural centres of the 
Muslim world, a city comparable in importance 
to Baghdad and Cairo. The geographer Ibn 
Hawaqal, who visited Cordoba in the second half 
of the century, judged it to be equal to “half of 
Baghdad”, and wrote that it “has no equivalent 
in the whole of the Maghrib, nor in Upper 
Mesopotamia, Syria or Egypt with regard to the 
size of its population, its extent, the spaciousness 
of its markets, its cleanliness, the architecture of 
its mosques and its large number of baths and 
caravanserais”’. 
At a time when the greatest cities of Western 
Europe had no more than a few thousand inhabi- 
tants, Cordoba had a population of at least a 
hundred thousand and extended over several 
hundred hectares (tenth-century Barcelona 
occupied less than ten hectares!). 
The first caliph, ‘Abd al-Rahman III, who 
reigned until 961, built the vast palatine city of 
Madinat al-Zahra’ on the lower slopes of the hills 
along the northern bank of the Guadalquivir, a

few kilometres downstream from Cérdoba. In 
contrast to the paucity of our information about 
Cordoba itself, we know the precise area of this 
Versailles of the Andalusian caliphs thanks to 
archaeological and written evidence. Madinat al- 
Zahra’ was almost completely abandoned at the 
end of the caliphate, to whose wealth and power 
its ruins bear eloquent witness. 
The walls enclosed about a hundred hectares, 
with room for several tens of thousands of inhabi- 
tants. The city was dominated by palaces and 
gardens on several levels, which have been exca- 
vated and partially restored. Spanish archaeolo- 
gists and architects have done notable work in 
reconstituting the salon rico, a lavishly decorated 
building which gave onto a wide esplanade in the 
centre of which was an enormous pool. We know 
from written evidence that this edifice was used 
for official audiences. 
The apotheosis 
of the mosque 
Equally sumptuous was the extension of the Cor- 
doban mosque carried out by the son and suc- 
cessor of ‘Abd al-Rahman III, al-Hakam II, who 
reigned from 961 to 976. The finest part of the 
building, around the mihrab, the niche in the wall 
which shows believers the direction of Mecca 
towards which they must turn to pray, was 
adorned with magnificent arches in a new style, 
a highly complex design of interwoven, multifoil 
horseshoe arches, decorated with interlaced 
marble and other sculpted stonework enriched 
with white or red polychrome patterns. 
The polychrome decoration recalls the con- 
trast between red and white in the alternating 
stone and brick archstones-which were an original 
feature of the oldest parts of the mosque, built 
during the emirate. However, the similarity 
between the two phases of construction is limited 
to a few discreet echoes of this kind. The simple 
elegance of the eighth- and ninth-century arches 
contrasts strongly with the exuberant ornamen- 
tation of those built under al-Hakam II, which 
are a brilliant testimony to the wealth of the 
caliphate at the height of its power, and to the 
inventiveness and virtuosity of the artists who 
worked for it. 
The most outstanding features of the part of 
the Great Mosque built during the caliphate are 
undoubtedly the magnificent domes in the 
antechamber to the mihrab and above the cen- 
tral nave leading to it. They were built using a 
technique of interlaced stone arches or ribbing 
which was quite new in Andalusian art, and had 
a strong influence on later “Hispano-Moorish” 
art from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries. 
Some art historians even believe that these original 
forms of Andalusian art may have influenced the 
development of ogival art in Christian Europe.

Although these forms were intrinsically 
decorative, and their effect was enhanced by the 
polychrome work described above, the architects 
and decorators of Cérdoba went even further by 
using mosaic. Craftsmen had to be brought from 
distant lands to execute this technique, which was 
rarely employed in medieval Islam. For this the 
caliphate mobilized its financial resources, the 
technical skills of its craftsmen, and also its diplo- 
matic relations, soliciting the help of the emperor 
at Constantinople, who sent a cargo of coloured 
glass cubes to Cordoba as well as a master mosai- 
cist to get the work underway and instruct local 
craftsmen in the intricacies of the new technique. 
A cultural 
crossroads 
The Great Mosque reveals more strikingly than 
anything else that Cordoba during the caliphate 
The city with the most books 
A polemical debate was held in the presence of al- 
Mansur Ya‘qub, king of the Maghrib, between the 
philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroés) and the chief 
Abu Bakr Ibn Zohr. In the course of the debate 
Ibn Rushd said to Ibn Zohr, referring to the 
supremacy of Cordoba: “I don’t understand what 
you say, but it so happens that if a wise man dies 
in Seville and they want to sell his books, the books 
are taken to Cordoba, and that if someone wants to 
get rid of his musical instruments, the instruments 
are taken to Seville.” And he added: “Cordoba is 
the city that has more books than any other in the 
whole world.” 
Al-Makarri 
Tunisian historian (Nafh al-Tib) 
was a cultural crossroads. A more detailed look 
at the building will help to show why this is so. 
The old columns and capitals that were re- 
used in the Great Mosque were brought from 
Roman buildings elsewhere in Spain or even from 
much farther afield, in particular from what is 
today Tunisia where there were many ancient 
ruins. 
The origin of the horseshoe-shaped arches so 
characteristic of Hispano-Muslim art is a vexed 
question. The form is found occasionally in the 
Middle East at the time of the Umayyads and the 
possibility cannot be excluded that it was deliber- 
ately imported from Syria by the emirs. 
However, it is generally considered to be a bor- 
rowing from Visigothic art, that is from the 
indigenous architecture that existed in Spain 
before the Muslim conquest. 
Another original feature of the parts of the 
Mosque built during the emirate is the superpo- 
sition of two rows of arches, enabling the ceiling 
to be raised to a greater height. This practice had 
already been followed, though less elegantly and 
less skilfully, in the great Umayyad mosque in 
Damascus which may have inspired the first 
builders of Cordoba. But it is more widely 
believed that the idea was suggested by Roman 
aqueducts, whose superimposed arcatures curi- 
ously recall those in the Great Mosque. The use 
of alternating archstones of white stone and red 
brick may originate in local building methods 
used during the later Roman Empire, or be 
modelled on Oriental Umayyad buildings, them- 
selves Byzantine in inspiration, such as the Dome 
of the Rock in Jerusalem. 
The caliphate adopted most of the styles 
which had been used earlier during the emirate, 
but enriched them considerably and added to 
their complexity by intersecting arches, 
introducing original features into their interfoil 
decoration, and importing, probably from the 
Orient, new techniques for constructing domes. 
Underlying all this was a desire to exalt the gran- 
deur of the Umayyads, without abandoning the 
link with an earlier Syrian tradition. 
The hand 
of the ruling dynasty 
However, we must not misunderstand the multi- 
cultural character of the Cordoban caliphate. The 
brilliant civilization that developed in Muslim 
Spain, mainly from this period onwards, was cer- 
tainly in part the result of spontaneous contact 
between the cultures and traditions of the three 
monotheistic religions that then coexisted on the 
Iberian peninsula. But the exchanges that sprang 
from the relations between Islam, Christianity and

Judaism were not on a basis of equality. The hand 
of the ruling dynasty is everywhere evident. The 
influences that contributed to the formation of 
Andalusian civilization were primarily Oriental— 
‘Abbasid and Byzantine. And the Umayyad State 
was strictly Muslim and Arab. 
It would doubtless be an exaggeration to deny 
the existence of local Hispanic influences in the 
development of Andalusian civilization. Even if 
they had wished to do so, the eighth-century 
Arab-Berber conquerors could hardly have made 
a clean sweep of the peninsula’s pre-Islamic past. 
Many elements, even if only the materials avail- 
able, remained and mingled in varying propor- 
tions with those brought from the east and from 
North Africa. However, these elements were re- 
used in a totally different context and helped in 
the creation of original structures in which many 
other elements taken from the Orient played a 
part.

An international team of scholars is engaged in

an attempt to rekindle in the minds of people today

1965 and today has members in more than seventy 
countries. 
The Paris meeting was followed by another held 
at Cordoba (Spain) in May 1991. On each occasion 
a group of well-known specialists studied the pattern 
of economic, legal, religious, literary and artistic 
exchanges in al-Andalus, and Andalusian influence 
on Europe and the Mediterranean.

university in Seville (Spain) in June-July 1992. The 
findings of this international research effort will be 
published in the form of books and video cassettes, 
and a travelling museum will also be created. HW     
In some cases the caliphate seems to have used 
the material and human resources it concentrated 
in Cordoba to create works whose originality is 
startling. The carved ivory caskets which are 
among the most refined achievements of tenth- 
century Andalusian craftsmanship are a case in 
point (see photo page 27). They have few antece- —— 
dents, although perhaps here too we should see PIERRE GUICHARD, 
professor of medieval history 
  
a certain influence from Byzantium, where ivory 
carving had reached a very high standard. 
But there is no doubt about the novelty of the 
style nor the source of its inspiration, since all 
these objects were made in palatine workshops. 
The caliphate seems to have been to some extent a 
pre-condition for the creation of these ivories, 
which rank among the most beautiful achieve- 
ments in the history of world art. Their manufac- 
ture virtually came to an end with the disappear- 
ance of the caliphate.

### 90308: The Christian contribution

  
The Chron contin 
The Arabized Christians of Spain 
bestrode two cultures and were 
intermediaries between two worlds 
We were the Mozarabs and what contribu- 
tion did they make to Andalusian civilization? 
In its strict sense the term Mozarab, which only 
appeared in the eleventh century, designates an 
Arabized Christian, but it is more widely used 
to designate the Christians of the Iberian penin- 
sula who lived under Islamic domination. 
The result of a complex process of rejection 
of and assimilation with the dominant society and 
culture, the Mozarabic community was far from 
homogeneous. The “real” Mozarabs were people 
who were more or less profoundly assimilated. 
The status of the Christians of al-Andalus 
depended on their initial attitudes to the invader. 
Many of them came to terms with the latter and 
carved out Christian enclaves in the newly 
Muslim lands. The people of cities such as 
Coimbra and Santarém, which did not offer 
resistance to the invader, were spared and kept 
their prerogatives. Those which did resist some- 
times paid a heavy price. 
Once the lands were divided among the 
different groups of conquerors, the Christians 
were allowed to enjoy their land and liberty in 
exchange for tribute in the form of a land-tax, 
the jarach, and a poll-tax, the djizia. These tributes 
became more onerous as time went by and other 
exceptional forms of taxation were added to 
them, provoking violent outbreaks of social dis- 
content. 
Like the Jews, the other people of the Book, 
the Christians were allowed to keep their laws, 
to retain and when the case arose to choose their 
civic and religious leaders, and to practise their 
religion freely. At first new monasteries were 
built in Cordoba as guardians of the Christian 
tradition and centres of culture where Latin 
32 remained alive. It was only later that discrimina-

tory measures appeared, such as the duty of 
wearing distinctive garments and the refusal of 
permission to build new places of worship. 
Assimilation 
and martyrdom 
No statistics are available with which to trace the 
course of the Islamization of the peninsula. 
Doubtless this came about in stages, starting with 
the rural areas where Christianization was not 
deeply rooted. The practice of mixed marriages 
and the close neighbourly links which were estab- 
lished between peasant communities led in the 
long run to a natural erosion of Christianity.

: Where Christianity did survive, it sometimes 
took unorthodox forms. The Mozarabs were 
attracted by certain heresies such as adoptianism 
which, by denying the divinity of Christ, seemed 
to bear some resemblance to Islam. Christianity, 
even in its dogmatic version, eventually assimilated 
certain Islamic practices such as circumcision, 
food taboos and even, surreptitiously, bigamy. 
Assimilation also took place in the other 
direction. The Muslims, while remaining faithful 
to their religion, came to take part in the main 
Christian festivals. Language played a decisive 
role in this process of intermingling. While 
Mozarabic, a Romance language, was widely

spoken (it was even used at court and in the 
administration), and used in folk literature, 
Arabic was adopted by the Christians as the lan- 
guage of culture. 
In the Arab-Andalusian melting-pot, Arabi- 
zation was thus a factor of integration, the course 
of which was not, however, entirely smooth. In 
the ninth century, a group of Mozarabs who were 
partly Arabized but remained profoundly 
attached to their Christian and Visigothic roots, 
were willing to sacrifice their lives in order to 
preserve their identity. Most of these candidates 
for voluntary martyrdom were the offspring of 
mixed unions, and were thus in the eyes of society 
Muslims. By making the supreme sacrifice, they 
wished to denounce the attitudes of other Chris- 
tians whom they considered to be too lukewarm 
and assimilated. Because they feared reprisals, 
many Mozarabs then preferred to convert to 
Islam whilst others, wishing to keep their Chris- 
tian faith, chose to take the path of exile towards 
the Christian lands in the north of the peninsula. 
In the tenth century, when the Cérdoba 
caliphate was at the height of its splendour, a 
period of peace opened for the Mozarabs. To turn 
their talents to full account, some of them drew 
on their dual cultural affiliations. The Calendar 
of Cordoba by Recemundo (Ibn Zaid), a man of 
a great culture, as versed in Latin as he was in 
Arabic, and a skilful diplomat at the court of Otto 
I (953), founder of the Holy Germanic Roman 
Empire, bears witness to this juxtaposition of the 
two Andalusian cultures, Latin-Christian and 
Arab-Muslim. 
This almanach, incorporating meteorological 
and agronomic information and a calendar of the 
festivals of Christian saints which even notes the 
places where they were celebrated, is written both 
in Arabic (but in Hebrew characters) and in 
Latin. 
Translators and commentators 
The trilingualism of the Mozarabs qualified them 
as translators who could build a bridge between a 
Western, European culture and an Oriental cul- 
ture. Among the sumptuous gifts offered to 
Caliph ‘Abd al-Rahman III by the Byzantine 
emperor was a manuscript of the Historiarum 
adversus paganos Libri VII by the Christian writer 
Orosius, a contemporary of St. Augustine. Trans- 
lated into Arabic by a Mozarab, this work became 
immensely popular. It enabled the Arabs to learn 33

Free spirits 
Freedom of thought and expression and intellec- 
tual integrity and creativity constitute three essen- 
tial characteristics of the original intellectual produc- 
tion of al-Andalus in the eleventh century. 
In the taifas scholars and intellectuals often 
experienced dramatic vicissitudes in their fortunes 
as a result of political conditions. Freedom of 
expression existed, however, in spite of the 
numerous restrictions limiting it, as the writings 
of scholars of the day in many fields show. . . . 
The intellectuals were not radically hostile to 
the taifa kings, who did not persecute all scholars. 
On the contrary, they needed them politically and 
tried to attract the greatest possible number to their 
courts. The importance of this phenomenon lies 
in the fact that some of the most celebrated rulers 
of taifas were themselves scholars. . . . 
Yet . . . most of the scholars developed their 
ideas outside of the political sphere of the rulers, 
working independently. . . .

at the time of the taifa States”, in Revwe de I'Occident

about the Greco-Roman past and inspired some 
of them to see in Arab-Andalusian history the 
natural prolongation of Hispano-Christian and 
Visigothic history. 
The Mozarabs were not only translators but 
also brilliant commentators in Arabic who con- 
tributed to the transmission of Visigothic culture. 
The Etymologiae, a summary of all the sacred and 
profane knowledge of his time by Isidore of 
Seville (sixth-seventh century), the last Father of 
the Western Church, circulated with extensive 
commentaries in Arabic, into which some parts 
of it were even translated. 
Among the Mozarabs in fact Latin seems to 
have lost its traditional role as the vehicle of 
knowledge and the liturgical language. Parts of 
the Bible were translated early on into Arabic, 
as were the canonical texts, accompanied by com- 
mentaries in Arabic to guide the thoughts of 
Christians, who were increasingly attracted by 
Arabic literature. 
The scriptures in Arabic were not only read 
by Arabized Christians. Arab-Andalusian writers 
of such stature as the eleventh-century theologian, 
historian and poet Ibn Hazm, reveal a profound 
knowledge of the Bible in works which were 
written, admittedly, in order to refute the prin- 
ciples of Christianity. 
To sum up, it might be said that, over and 
above the movements of attraction and rejection 
which punctuated the coexistence between the 
two communities, in the tenth century the Arab- 
Andalusians assumed their Hispanic identity and 
the Mozarabs their Arab identity, while con- 
tinuing to respect their respective religions. This 
was no small achievement in a world and at a time 
when the tendency was for different peoples and 
confessions to be locked in mutual ignorance and 
attracted to mutual destruction. []

Convergent streams 
  
  
  
In contact with Arab thought, Jewish scholars of al-Andalus broadened their mystic, philosophical, 
poetic and scientific horizons and also enriched Andalusian civilization 
UDAISM has never interrelated more closely or 
more fruitfully with another culture than it did 
with the Islamic civilization of al-Andalus. Even 
though the status enjoyed there by Jews and 
Christians as peoples of the Book was often 
precarious and in some ways oppressive, the legal 
position it guaranteed was, all things considered, 
liberal in comparison with the conditions the 
Jews encountered elsewhere in Europe, providing 
as it did a high degree of legal, administrative, 
fiscal and cultural autonomy. 
The largely secularized character of the 
Islamic civilization of al-Andalus allowed the 
peoples of the Book to consider themselves the 
heirs of a great and respected cultural tradition. 
The dominant language, Arabic, was less closely 
wedded to the prevailing religion than Latin was 
to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Churches, 
and was widely used by Jews when commenting 
on their own sacred texts. 
The “bourgeois revolution” of the eighth and 
ninth centuries in the Islamic world saw the 
appearance of an entirely new Jewish society, one 
very different from that of medieval Christian 
Europe. While Jews in the pre-Islamic era had 
mostly been farmers or small craftsmen, they 
now rose to dominant positions in public life and 
the upper ranks of the administration, as well as 
in industry, finance and the professions. 
With time and money to spare, these new 
élites had wider intellectual horizons, more 
refined tastes, and heightened expectations of a 
more exalted spiritual life. Like their Muslim and 
Christian counterparts, they devoted themselves 
to science and poetry, to artistic activities and 
fashionable occupations of all kinds, both serious 
and frivolous. It was a time of travel, when Jewish 
communities were spreading across the Islamic 
lands and migrating between countries. 
In linguistic terms, the symbiosis meant that 
Arabic, the new international language of civili- 
zation and culture, replaced the former vehicular 
language, Aramaic, which henceforth was used 
only for Talmudic texts. The Jews employed 
Arabic in all their intellectual activities: sacred and 
profane literature, science and religion, transla- 
tions and commentaries on the Bible and the 
Mishna. It was used for liturgical purposes, in 
theological treatises, in grammars, dictionaries 
and in correspondence. 
Jewish and Muslim philologists alike became 
aware of the kinship between Arabic, Hebrew 
and Aramaic. But it was only the Jews who, 
knowing all three, were in a position to lay the 
foundations for a comparative study of these lan- 
guages. 
In literature, an examination of Jewish and 
Arabic traditions, both written and oral, reveals 
common elements and structures. There is a 
A page of the polyglot Bible 
published early in the 
16th century by the 
University of Alacala de 
Henares, near Toledo, under 
the auspices of Cardinal 
Cisneros. The text, written in 
Greek, Hebrew, Latin and 
Chaldean, is printed in parallel 
striking similarity between, on the one hand, columns.

A street in the old Jewish 
district of Cordoba. 
_— 
  
Jewish folklore, the Talmud and the Midrash (a 
collection of homilies and legends), and on the 
other their Arabic counterparts, the Hadith 
(spoken traditions attributed to the Prophet 
Muhammad) and the Islamic verse-chronicles. 
There are also common subjects and heroes— 
Abraham, Moses, Job and Joseph, for example— 
in the stories, verse and proverbs of the two 
peoples. 
Hebrew poetry was transformed by contact 
with Arabic verse. Indeed, it owes the greater part 
of its prosody to the Andalusian inheritance. In 
the tenth century, Dunash ben Labrat laid the 
foundations of a new system of scansion that 
replicated the quantitative metre of Arabic verse, 
whose rules he adopted. The muwashshah, a poetic 
form originating in al-Andalus, also became a 
familiar mode of expression in Hebrew poetry. 
Alongside the renewal of Oriental Jewish 
styles, a novel and prestigious form of poetry 
gradually developed to express the new élite’s love 
of art, comparable both in its form and its inner 
meaning to the Arabic model. It displays a 
manifest desire to emulate the intellectual and 
social élites of the Muslim world. 
The Arab contribution to this literary 
heritage was thoroughly digested and assimilated 
until it finally became a naturalized part of the 
Jewish tradition. Jewish writers achieved an 
almost total blending of the cultural components 
of the Judaeo-Arab world of their day. At the 
same time that interconfessional tensions were 
abating, an attempt was made in poetry to 
remove the discrepancies and discordances that 
the abrupt encounter of the Hebrew language and 
  
orthodox Jewish thought with a foreign tongue 
and culture could have occasioned. One can see 
in the works of Ibn Khalfon and his successors 
the attempt to adapt an essentially Jewish rhetoric 
to the task of describing a secular world of which 
Judaism had up to that time known nothing. 
The lessons of Sufism 
It would be impossible to understand or even con- 
ceive of the existence of Jewish spirituality and 
esotericism had it not been for the Islamic 
environment and the knowledge Jewish authors 
had of Sufi mysticism. 
A comparison of the ancient Jewish mysti- 
cism centred on the Merkava, the divine chariot 
described by the prophet Ezekiel, with such 
Islamic practices as dhikr (ritual repetition of the 
name of God) and breathing exercises might sug- 
gest that archaic Jewish gnosticism contributed 
to the formation of Islamic esoteric traditions. In 
fact, the influence went very much in the oppo- 
site direction. The relatively incoherent utter- 
ances of the Jewish Gnostics of the fifth and sixth 
centuries gave way to the fervent eloquence of 
the Islamic mystics, who possessed in the Arabic 
language a first-class means of expression. From 
that time on, Muslim pietism left its mark on the 
mysticism, spirituality and ethics of Judaism as 
it existed on Islamic soil. 
It was via Sufism that many Jewish mystics 
and ascetics received their apprenticeship in a new 
form of spirituality that they subsequently passed 
on to their own culture, first of all in its original 
language, Arabic, then through translations into 
Hebrew and other vernacular languages. This 
work was accomplished by such scholars as Bahya 
Ibn Paquda, Abraham Abulafya, and Abraham 
and Obadya Maimonides, the son and grandson 
respectively of the great Moses Maimonides. 
Common ground between Jewish and Muslim 
mysticism and esotericism can also be found in the 
practices of the Andalusian Sufis and the teachings 
of Ibn ‘Arabi (1165-1241), a prestigious figure in 
the Sufi world who was born in Murcia in Spain. 
The experiences and teachings of al-Ghazali 
(1058-1111), one of the greatest Islamic 
philosophers and theologians, exerted a consider- 
able influence on the intellectual history of the 
West and the East, and especially on Jewish 
thinkers. The influence was felt at two levels and 
at two distinct times. 
During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, 
it affected Jewish authors writing and thinking 
in Arabic. One such was Judah Halevi, al- 
Ghazali’s most fervent disciple who, sharing his 
master’s view of the danger posed by philosophy 
to revealed religion, took as his starting-point the

ence of the Philosophers) against philosophers in 
general and Aristotelian philosophy in particular. 
It is also accepted that Moses Maimonides knew 
al-Ghazali’s works, and especially his refutation 
of philosophy. 
From the thirteenth century onwards, the 
works of al-Ghazali were translated into Hebrew, 
and were read, studied and commented on by 
Jews in non-Arabic-speaking Provence and Spain, 
who lived and worked in 
northern Spain and the south 
of France during the second 
half of the 14th century. 
where they achieved immense popularity. In fact 
some of the writings of al-Ghazali and of 
Averroés (Ibn Rushd), the great Cérdoba-born 
twelfth-century Islamic philosopher, have only 
survived in Hebrew.

HAIM ZAFRANI 
1S professor of Hebrew at the 
University of Paris Vill and 
director of a research unit on 
Judaism in Islamic lands. He is 
the author of 11 books and 
many articles on Jewish 
thought, literature (written and 
oral) and languages in the 
Muslim West. His study of 
Jewish poetry in the Muslim 
West (Poésie juive en Occident 
musulman, Paris, 1977) was 
translated into Hebrew in 
1984, and his Mille ans de vie 
juive au Maroc ("A thousand 
years of Jewish life in 
Morocco”, Paris, 1983) was 
translated into Hebrew in 1986 
and into Arabic in 1987. 
The communication of Greek learning 
In philosophy, one of the most outstanding fea- 
tures of the Judaeo-Arabic symbiosis was the 
irruption of Greek science and culture into the 
Jewish world through the medium of Arabic liter- 
ature. The Hellenization of Jewish thought via 
[slam is all the more surprising in view of the fact 
that many Diaspora Jews had close and some- 
times fruitful contacts with the Graeco-Latin 
world. 
However, the example of Philo of Alexan- 
dria, a philosopher of the Diaspora who lived 
sometime between the first century BC and the 
second century AD and was familiar with Greek 
philosophy, had no strong impact on Jewish cul- 
ture, and the countless traces of the Greek lan- 
guage and of Hellenic civilization that are to be 
found in Talmudic or Midrashic literature sug- 
gest only a superficial influence. Such a rejection 
can perhaps be explained by the Jews’ defensive 
instinct to protect their religious identity, dictated 
by an intransigent monotheism confronted with 
the temptations of the paganism that Graeco- 
Latin culture represented. 
A more conciliatory attitude towards Greek 
learning only became possible after the victory 
of the monotheistic principle in the form first of 
Christianity and then, more importantly, of 
Islam, which was closer to Judaism in its unitary 
conception of divinity. 
Judaism subsequently successfully passed the 
test of Hellenization. Yet it always maintained 
its independence of Islam in the matter of reli- 
gious fundamentals, even while travelling down 
the paths of Muslim philosophy and accepting the 
latest findings of the new sciences. This explains

twelfth centuries, notably Ibn Gabirol and Moses

Voyages to the Orient 
Initially, the balance of the relationship between 
al-Andalus and the lands of the Orient inclined in 
favour of the latter. Scholars made more journeys 
from Andalusia to the Orient than vice versa, 
because the current of civilization always flows 
from centres of higher culture to the less developed 
areas. Al-Andalus leaned heavily at first on Oriental 
knowledge, which it considered the fountainhead 
that Andalusians ought to know. 
That 1s why the voyages were an element in 
consolidating and reinforcing the links between the 
two regions, permitting Andalusian scientific and 
cultural life to develop and make rapid strides. They 
made al-Andalus pass from the status of a relatively 
backward country that copied the Muslim Orient 
to that of a competitor that sometimes surpassed 
its model.

### 90310: The Pursuit of learning

A bridge between cultures, al-Andalus transmitted to Europe Arab science and philosophy as well 
as the work of Aristotle and other elements of ancient Greek thought 
I, was only in al-Andalus that scholars of the 
early Middle Ages had access to the entire corpus 
of scientific knowledge of their time written in 
Arabic, Hebrew, Greek or Latin. 
To take one example of the transmission of 
knowledge to Muslim Spain, Byzantine envoys 
took there a copy of the Materia Medica, a well- 
known treatise by the first-century-AD Greek 
doctor Dioscorides. By comparing it with an 
existing Arabic version, it was possible to fill in 
many gaps, notably with regard to the precise 
identification of plant species. This task was car- 
ried out in collaboration with a monk named 
Nicolas, who came from the East expressly for 
the purpose. 
In the same circle of scholars were the Jewish 
minister and doctor Hasday ben Shaprut; Ibn 
Juljul, historian of medicine and pharmacology; 
and also perhaps the great surgeon Abu al-Qasim 
az-Zahrawi, known to Christians as Albucasis, 
whose work was soon translated into Latin. He 
wrote an outline of all the medical knowledge of 
the day, providing descriptions of such diseases 
as haemophilia and scabies, of various surgical

instruments, even of a way of using a particular 
variety of ant to heal wounds. 
Maslama al-Magriti’s name also belongs on 
the list. The works of this Madrid-based 
astronomer and alchemist circulated in digest 
form in Western Europe almost as soon as they 
were written, thanks to Latin adaptations pre- 
pared by the Mozarabic monks of the monastery 
of Ripoll in Catalonia. From there they were dis- 
patched to monasteries in the Rhine valley, 
notably Saint Gall in Switzerland and Reichenau 
in Germany. 
In the tenth century the natural passage still 
used by modern tourists travelling from central 
Europe to Spain was the only means of commu- 
nication beween the peninsula and the rest of the 
continent. The route through the central and 
western Pyrenees had been closed since the defeat 
of Charlemagne at the battle of Roncevaux in 
778. 
The importance thus accorded to Catalonia 
explains why the oldest surviving astrolabe, a 
hybrid product of the Arab and Visigothic cul- 
tures, 1s set to function at the latitude of Barcelona.

### 90310: The Pursuit of learning

It was to the Catalan marches that the young Ger- 
bert of Aurillac, later to become Pope Sylvester 
II, travelled to study science. By the time he 
returned to France, he had learned so much that 
at first he was taken for a necromancer or magus. 
It was some time before the new knowledge that 
he helped to introduce to Europe—of such subjects 
as decimal numbers, the abacus, the construction 
of astrolabes, sun-dials, armillary spheres and 
other instruments—became widely available there. 
When he quit the Iberian peninsula, Gerbert 
knew that he was leaving behind him not just a 
land whose scientific culture was vastly superior 
to that of Christendom but also one whose 
researchers (if one can use that word to describe 
tenth-century scholars) were making continued 
progress in their respective fields. In order to keep 
abreast of their work, Gerbert corresponded with 
an acquaintance in Barcelona—one Lupitus, 
recently identified as the archdeacon Sunifred— 
whom he requested to send him the latest 
writings from al-Andalus. 
A fruitful partnership 
In the same way, Christian envoys to Cérdoba 
such as Gomar, the future Bishop of Gerona, 
profited from their residence in al-Andalus to co- 
operate with their Muslim counterparts. Gomar 
wrote a chronicle of the Frankish kings at the 
request of the future caliph al-Hakam II al- 
Mustansir. An edited version of this work was 
soon circulating in the Orient, and it has come 
down to us in the great Arab traveller and ency- 
clopaedist al-Masudi’s Murudj al-Dhahab. 
The same ruler was also responsible for the 
enlargement of the palace library, which eventu- 
ally contained some 400,000 volumes, only one 
of which has survived. His bibliomania drove him 
to pay a fortune for any book that caught his 
interest. That is why the first copy of Abu al-. 
Farad) ’Ali al-Isfahani’s “Book of Songs”, a col- 
lection of poems set to music that contains much 
information on social and cultural life during the 
first centuries of Islam, was known in Cordoba 
before it was in the Orient. 
It has been established from the dates at which 
some surviving works were imported that it was 
possible for books to make the journey from the 
Orient to Cordoba and then on into the Chris- 
tian world in less than two years. The speed with 
which knowledge was transmitted can be 
explained by the close collaboration that existed 
between scholars of different religions and cul- 
tures. For instance the monk Recemundo, author 
of a celebrated liturgical calendar, was successively 
Andalusian envoy to the Holy Roman Empire, 
to Constantinople and to Jerusalem. His work, 
which was amalgamated into the Book of Maladies 
  
of Arib ben Sa’d, a doctor and civil servant who 
was his contemporary, contains popularized ele- 
ments of Indian and Iraqi astronomy as well as 
a mention of the great astronomer al-Battani. 
The Christian writer Orosius’s Seven Books 
of Histories against the Pagans (Historiarum 
adversus paganos Libri VII) was translated into 
Arabic by two men, Qasim ben Asbagh, a 
Muslim cadi or judge, and his Christian counter- 
part, Walid ben Khayzuran. The treatise known 
as the Mathematica Albandrea probably had a 
similar genesis. A series of brief texts in Latin, 
it contains in more or less accurate form the 
Arabic names of many stars, among them Rigel, 
Betelgeuse, Altair, Vega and Aldebaran— 
appellations that are still familiar today. 
Other, more technical knowledge was also 
propagated abroad. Maslama of Madrid, an 
astrologer at the Umayyad court, adapted the 
tables of al-Kharezmi, the great Baghdad 
mathematician, for the Cordoba meridian. He 
also wrote notes on the construction of astrolabes 
and carried out astronomical observations. His 
work soon became known in Europe, though not 
under his own name. Latin translations and 
digests also helped many Arabic words, such as 
al-sumt, azimuth, to enter other languages. 
The new knowledge was also transmitted to 
Europe via Arab prisoners of war held on Chris- 
tian territory. Ibn Hayyan, the greatest historian 
of al-Andalus, specifically refers to their influence. 
Some of these captives were men of great 
learning, and their captors knew how to profit 
from their knowledge. u 
This copper astrolabe 
made in early-11th-century 
Cordoba Is one of the oldest 
in the world.

I. was not until the twelfth century that the 
first college of translators from Arabic into Latin 
was set up in Spain, in the city of Toledo. It was 
founded by Don Raimundo, archbishop of 
Toledo from 1126 to 1151. A Benedictine monk 
who had been born at Agen in south-western 
France, Raimundo was convinced of the impor- 
tance of the Arab philosophers for an under- 
standing of Aristotle, and he decided to make 
their works available in Latin. 
Domingo Gundisalvo, archdeacon of Segovia, 
was one of the most eminent of the scholars 
recruited by Raimundo. He translated much of 
the encyclopaedic Kitab al Shifa’ (“Book of 
Healing”) by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) as well as al- 
Ghazali’s Magasid al-falasifab (“The Aims of the 
Philosophers”) and al-Farabi’s Ihsa ‘al-ulum 
(“Catalogue of the Sciences”). 
But Gundisalvo knew no Arabic. He used a 
Jewish or Muslim intermediary to translate from 
Arabic into Castilian, and then put the Castilian 
into Latin. Among his Jewish collaborators two 
names feature prominently: a certain Salomon 
and, more importantly, one Johannes Avendeath 
(who also appears as Avendear, Johannes ben 
David, Johannes Hispanus, and also John of 
Seville). The exact identity of these two has 
aroused much discussion. 
The most important of the Toledan trans- 
lators was undoubtedly Gerard of Cremona 
(1114-1187). Thanks to a brief notice left by his 
pupils on his life and work, we know that Gerard 
came to Toledo after finishing his studies in Italy, 
in order to learn more about the Almagest. This 
vast astronomical treatise by Claudius Ptolemaeus 
ABDURRAHMAN BADAWI, 
of Egypt, is a philosopher and historian of philosophy. A 
former head of the departments of philosophy at a number 
of universities in Egypt, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and 
Kuwait, and a visiting professor at the Sorbonne, Paris, he 1s 
the author of over a hundred publications in French and in 
40 Arabic, mainly concerned with existentialism, Greek and 
Arab philosophy, and contemporary German philosophy.

 _ Avicenna’'s Canon of Medicine 
(Ptolemy), the celebrated second-century-AD 
Greek astronomer, mathematician and 
geographer, was then only available in Arabic. 
In fact Gerard discovered a multitude of scien- 
tific works in Arabic in Toledo, and immediately 
began to learn the language so as to read them 
and, later, to render them into Latin. He eventu- 
ally translated more than seventy of them, 
including the Almagest, which he completed in 
1175. 
His translations cover virtually the entire 
field of science of his time. Among them are 
several treatises by Aristotle (The Physics, On 
Heaven and Earth, On Generation and Corrup- 
tion, and The Meteors), as well as books by al- 
Kindi, Ptolemy, Isaac Israeli, Ibn Sina, Galen and 
others. 
The other great translator was Michael Scot 
(c.1175-¢.1235). Born in England, he studied at 
Oxford University and then in Paris before 
settling in Toledo. After learning Arabic and 
Hebrew, he became a prolific translator of Arabic 
into Latin. Near the end of his life he was invited 
to the court of the Emperor Frederick II in Sicily, 
the other great centre of translation from the 
Arabic. 
Scot’s translations included many commen- 
taries on Aristotle by Ibn Rushd (Averroés) as 
well as al-Bitruji’s work on the spheres, which 
was to have a great influence on astronomical 
knowledge. 
The Toledan translations raise problems of 
attribution. The French writer and historian 
Ernest Renan wrote in a study of Averrdes: “It 
is certain that the Latins who journeyed to 
Toledo had no scruples about appropriating the 
work of their secretaries, and . . . the name of 
the translator was often a fiction. 
“Nearly always a Jew, often a converted 
Muslim, did a rough translation, substituting 
words in Latin or the vernacular for the Arabic

original. A clerk would supervise this process, 
taking responsibility for the final Latin version 
and putting his name to the work. This explains 
why one translation is often attributed to 
different individuals.” 
Renan’s view was shared by the great 
American medievalist Charles Homer Haskins in 
his book on the twelfth-century Renaissance. It 
is also supported by some translations in the Bib- 
liotheque Nationale in Paris, which were ren- 
dered from Arabic into Latin by way of Spanish. 
The extraordinary achievements of the 
Toledan translators were in reality the joint work 
of Muslim Arabs, Jews and Latin Christians. It 
would be unjust to give the credit exclusively to 
the latter, even though many of the manuscripts, 
and many historians, mention only their names. 
Gundisalvo, Gerard of Cremona, Michael Scot 
and others all called on the help of Muslim Arabs 
or more often of Jews in the course of their work. 
Sometimes the task of the Latin Christian trans- 
lators was limited to putting into good Latin what 
their assistants had already translated into bad 
Latin or Spanish. 
The great enterprise of translation from 
Arabic into Latin began in Spain in the twelfth 
century, and Toledo was its most active centre. 
But it also took place in other cities of the penin- 
sula including Barcelona, Tarragona, Segovia, 
Léon and Pamplona. The task was subsequently 
taken up on the other side of the Pyrenees, in 
Toulouse, Béziers, Narbonne, Montpellier and 
Marseilles. 
It was thanks to these translations that 
Europe came to know both the works of the 
Greek philosophers, mathematicians, doctors and 
astronomers and those of their Arabic commen- 
tators or emulators. As Haskins wrote, “The 
reception of this knowledge by western Europe 
marks a crucial turning-point in the history of 
European thought.” [|

### 90312: Borges in search of Averroës

42   
Borges n search of Avermés 
A great Argentine 
writer's fictional 
attempt to recreate the 
atmosphere of 
intellectual life in 
al-Andalus 
T. medical doctor, philosopher and jurist Ibn 
Rushd or Averroés (1126-1198), the greatest Arab 
commentator on Aristotle, is at home in Cor- 
doba. He 1s busy writing a philosophical work, 
the Tabafut-al-Tahafut (Destruction of Destruc- 
tion) “in which it is maintained, contrary to the 
Persian ascetic al-Ghazali, author of the Tabafut- 
ul-Falasifa (Destruction of Philosophers), that the 
divinity knows only the general laws of the 
universe, those pertaining to the species, not to 
the individual. 
“He wrote with slow sureness, from right to 
left; the effort of forming syllogisms and linking 
vast paragraphs did not keep him from feeling, 
like a state of well-being, the cool and deep house 
surrounding him. 
“In the depths of the siesta amorous doves 
called huskily; from some unseen patio arose the 
murmur of a fountain; something in Averroés, 
whose ancestors came from the Arabian deserts, 
was thankful for the constancy of the water. 
“Down below were the gardens, the orchard; 
down below, the busy Guadalquivir and then the 
  ER a 
by Rachid Sabbaghi 
beloved city of Cordoba, no less eminent than 
Baghdad or Cairo, like a complex and delicate 
instrument, and all around (this Averroés felt 
also) stretched out to the limits of the earth the 
Spanish land, where there are few things, but 
where each seems to exist in a substantive and 
eternal way.” 
The above passage is taken from La busca de 
Awverroés (““ Averroés’s Search”, 1947), by the great 
Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986). 
Themes and figures of Arab-Islamic culture are 
recurrent features of the work of Borges, who 
once proclaimed that the Thousand and One 
Nights was the Book of Books. Of all the writings 
he devoted to Arab-Islamic culture, “Averroés’s 
Search” best represents his special relationship 
with that culture and, more particularly, with one 
of its unique facets: the world of al-Andalus. 
Al-Andalus as depicted by Borges is the scene 
of an extraordinary spiritual adventure. It is a 
place where commentaries are written on 
Aristotle, “this Greek, fountainhead of all 
philosophy”. Where people “exhaust the pages

authenticity of “marvels” can turn into a discus- 
sion of the created or uncreated character of the 
Qur’an. 
Great intellectual receptivity, rich and con- 
trasting characters, a profound respect for other 
people’s freedom of opinion, conversation and 
the exchange of ideas raised to an art: these are 
the characteristics of the Andalusian élite as 
described by Borges. Averroés takes issue with 
another character in the story, Farach the the- 
ologian, by refusing to accept that “an excellent 
variety of the perpetual rose . . . is found in the 
gardens of Hindustan’ —a Borgesian theme par 
excellence—" whose petals, of a blood red, exhibit 
characters which read: “There is no god but the 
God, Muhammad is the Apostle of God.” ”” But 
this disagreement does not provoke a polemic. 
The viewpoint of the orthodox theologian, for 
whom a miracle is the very sign of divinity, can 
coexist with that of the rationalist.

In the person of Abulcasim the traveller 
Borges mischievously presents a kind of antithesis 
to the three other characters in the story—Farach 
the theologian, Abdalmalik the poet and 
Averroés himself. A down-to-earth, practical 
man, Abulcasim, whose “memory was a mirror 
of intimate cowardices,” has a very different 
experience of the world from that of the men of 
ideas and convictions. When asked to relate a 
marvel, he reflects that “‘the moon of Bengal is 
not the same as the moon of Yemen, but it may 
be described in the same words.” A prudent man, 
he never answers directly, but takes the pulse of 
his audience and softens the asperities of the ques- 
tions put to him by means of dialectical agility. 
Could it be the memory of other, less tolerant 
lands far from al-Andalus that explain this wari- 
ness? Was al-Andalus really the idyllic land Borges 
describes? Did it not, like any other country, have 
its share of stupidity and horror as well as its 
exemplary splendours? The life of Averroés him- 
self seems to confirm that this was so, if any proof 
were needed. He knew opprobrium as well as 
glory, suffered repression at the hands of obtuse 
authorities, was present at the burning of books 
that had cost him dear in hard work and self- 
denial, and came to know not just the loyal sup- 
port of true friends but also the stubborn hatred 
of mediocrities. 
But Borges’s al-Andalus is not that of history, 
nor that of a literary realism that would seek to 
reconstitute objectively a life, a place, a time. He 
does not set himself that goal, still less allow him- 
self that illusion. The point of Borges’s fiction is 
quite different. The Spanish title of the story, La 
busca de Averroes, can be read in two ways, as the 
quest undertaken by Averroés himself, or as the 
quest for Averroés—Borges’s own attempt to 
recreate the philosopher and his destiny in the 
truest manner possible. 
In the first paragraphs of the story, Averroés 
is depicted hard at work in his library. He is grap- 
pling with a problem that causes him great con- 
cern. At the beginning of Aristotle’s Poetics, on 
which he is writing a commentary, he has stum- 
bled over two words, tragedy and comedy. “No 
one in the world of Islam could conjecture what 
they meant.” He consults all the sources, pores 
over the versions of the Nestorian Hunain ibn- 
Ishaq and of Abu Bashar Mata. But in vain. And 
yet “it was impossible to elude . . . these two 
arcane words” from the great philosopher’s 
Poetics. 
Borges twice puts Averroés in the presence 
of the answer that he is seeking. The first occa- 
sion is a scene in which he is distracted from his 
work “by a kind of melody”, looks down from 
his balcony and sees “below, in the narrow ear- 
then patio, some half-naked children were 43

playing. One, standing on another’s shoulders, 
was obviously playing the part of a muezzin; with 
his eyes tightly closed, he chanted “There is no 
god but the God.” The one who held him motion- 
lessly played the part of the minaret; another, 
abject in the dust and on his knees, the part of 
the faithful worshippers. The game did not last 
] long; all wanted to be the muezzin. . . 
The second time is through a story told by 
the traveller Abulcasim about a strange thing he 
had seen in China: “One afternoon, the Muslim 
merchants of Sin Kalan took me to a house of 
painted wood where many people lived. It is 
impossible to describe the house, which was 
rather a single room with rows of cabinets or bal- 
conies on top of each other. In these cavities there 
were people who were eating and drinking, and 
also on the floor, and also on a terrace. The 
persons on this terrace were playing the drum and 
the lute, save for some fifteen or twenty (with 
crimson-coloured masks) who were praying, 
singing and conversing. They suffered prison, but 
no one could see the jail; they travelled on horse- 
back, but no one could see the horse; they fought, 
but the swords were of reed; they died and then 
stood up again. 
“ “The acts of madmen,’ said Farach, ‘exceed 
the previsions of the sane.’ 
“ “These were no madmen,” Abulcasim had 
to explain. “They were representing a story, a 
merchant told me.’ 
“No one understood, no one seemed to want 
to understand. . . . : 
“ ‘Did these people speak?’ asked Farach. 
“ ‘Of course they spoke,’ said Abulcasim. . 
. . ‘They spoke and sang and perorated.’ 
“ “In that case,’ said Farach, ‘twenty persons 
are unnecessary. One single speaker can tell any- 
thing, no matter how complicated it might be. 
» 
The words tragedy and comedy presuppose a 
knowledge of theatre, an art unknown to Arab 
culture in Averroés’s day. The philosopher, a . 
prisoner of his own culture, cannot imagine what 
these words can mean unless he has some idea 
of theatrical representation itself. This is why, 
when he has an example of it before his eyes— 
the children playing at being muezzin—he cannot 
see it. One can only see something of which one 
already has a concept; everything else remains 
“invisible”. Since theatre does not exist as a cul- 
tural category, another category that is familiar, 
that of the story-teller, takes its place. 
Averroés returns home at dawn and goes to 
his library. Under the impression that he has 
finally found the meaning of the two obscure 
words, he adds these lines to his manuscript: 
“Aristu (Aristotle) gives the name of tragedy to 
panegyrics and that of comedy to satires and 
anathemas. Admirable tragedies and comedies 
abound in the pages of the Qur’an and in the 
mohalacas of the sanctuary. . ..” 
Borges then adds a postscript in which he 
explains that in the story he has “tried to nar- 
rate the process of a defeat”, the failure of a quest 
blocked by its own cultural frontiers, adding, 
however, that his own quest for Averroés fails 
for the same reason: “I felt that Averroés, 
wanting to imagine what a drama is without ever 
having suspected what a theatre is, was no more 
absurd than I, wanting to imagine Averroés with 
no other sources than a few fragments from 
Renan, Lane and Asin Palacios.” 
Can one ever really know another culture 
than one’s own? Putting the bleakest possible 
interpretation on Borges’s words, it might be said 
that cultures are closed to one another. If this is 
the case, the quest for what al-Andalus was 
becomes impossible, and attempts to recreate al- 
Andalus are bound to give a distorted impression. 
But such a quest also provides an ethical lesson: 
to know is to be aware of otherness, of the “com- 
pletely other”, and to respect it—a very different 
thing from the disastrous pretensions of the 
“panoptic overview”. 
“Few things more beautiful and more 
pathetic are recorded in history than this Arab 
physician’s dedication to the thoughts of a man 
separated from him by fourteen centuries,” 
Borges says of Averroés. 
Borges’s story is a fine contemporary tribute 
to the exceptional moment in intellectual life that 
was al-Andalus. »

United States bans illicit

The United States has banned the 
importation of all Mayan artefacts 
from the Peten region of 
Guatemala by applying its statute 
implementing a UNESCO 
convention which is the only 
widely accepted international 
instrument dealing with the illicit 
trade in cultural objects. The 
measure, taken after the 
Government of Guatemala made a 
formal request for the ban to the 
U.S. Government under the 
Convention, is intended to help 
stop the plunder of more than 
2,200 archaeological sites in the 
Peten, a lowland area of tropical 
forests. According to the 
Guatemalan Government, 
increasingly sophisticated looting 
has affected more than 85% of 
the sites. The U.S. ban covers 
vases, bowls, drums, effigy 
vessels and artefacts of jade, flint, 
shell, bone and other materials. 
This is the 4th time that the 
United States has applied Article 
9 of the Convention on the illicit 
transfer of cultural objects (1870), 
which has been ratified by 71 
States.

### 90314: Tenth anniversary of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education

Tenth anniversary 
of the UNESCO Prize 
for Peace Education 
The UNESCO Prize for Peace Education was awarded for the first 
time ten years ago. The $60,000 prize, endowed by a gift from 
the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, rewards outstanding 
activities designed “to construct the defences of peace in the minds 
of men" and is awarded annually at a ceremony at UNESCO head- 
quarters in Paris. The laureates are designated by the Director- 
General on the basis of a recommendation by an international jury 
of scholars and statespersons, which reviews the many nomina- 
tions which are sent from all over the world to UNESCO. 
In the past, education to “alert public opinion and mobilize the 
conscience of mankind in the cause of peace’ has not generally 
had the support and recognition it deserves and urgently requires. 
The prize has made and is making a notable change in that direc: 
tion. It is bringing to ever wider attention a message articulated 
as early as 1911 by one of the first two laureates, honoured in 
1981, The World Organization of the Scout Movement, “Peace 
cannot be secured . . . unless the spirit for peace is there in the 
minds and wills of the peoples. This is a matter of education.” 
Over the years the jury has selected a diverse group of 
laureates representing a very broad range of activities in peace edu- 
cation. We recently carried out a survey of the laureates which 
revealed that the prize has spurred greater efforts for peace. Helena 
Kekkonen of Finland (1981) reflected that “The reputation brought 
by the UNESCO prize did a lot towards increasing the interest of 
Finnish educators and people in general in peace education. . . . 
In 1985-1987, laws obliging ‘children and young people to be 
brought up with a will for peace’ came into effect in Finland." 
Several prize-winners reported becoming more active within 
UNESCO and the United Nations system. The International Peace 
Research Association, for example, has undertaken a project on 
“Cultural Symbiosis in al-Andalus” (see page 31). 
The funds awarded to the laureates have helped them to carry 
further their service to the advancement of peace education. Among 
the endeavours supported by the prize money have been: financing 
the travel of peace researchers from developing countries to par- 
ticipate in the 1990 biennial meeting of the International Peace 
Research Association; the funding of a work on peacekeeping that 
is used as a basic text for the professional preparation of military 
officers and diplomats; the promotion of a book on the struggles 
for peace of Egyptian and Israeli women; research on a just world 
order; a series of films on development and peace.

The

¢ harem: « forbidden enclave by Caroline Haar 
Soin seraglio, harem: such words long 
epitomized Ottoman civilization in the 
dreams of Westerners. The master of an 
immense empire stretching from Egypt to 
Persia and from Baghdad to Belgrade, the 
sultan seemed to be a fabulous character who 
enjoyed limitless power and endless pleasure. 
It was easy to imagine him living in his harem 
as if in a garden of earthly delights. 
The reality was very different. The harem 
was a restricted enclave governed by punc- 
tilious protocol and strict rules, subject to the 
authority of the walide sultan, the ruling 
sultan’s mother. In it love was codified, if not 
harem of the Topkapi, a new palace which was 
to be the imperial residence unul the 
nineteenth century. Marvellously situated on 
a hill overlooking the Sea of Marmara, the 
Bosphorus and the Golden Horn, the 
immense complex covers 700,000 square 
metres, with its vast gardens, its murmuring 
waters and its terraces overlooking the sea. At 
its heart was the harem, where only the sultan 
had the right to enter and move around freely. 
This forbidden domain adjoined the bar- 
racks of the halberdiers-with-tresses, tough 
mountain troops from Anatolia who cut the 
wood that fuelled the palace fires. To avoid 
ritualized. And if some sultans abused its 
pleasures, others only went there for the sake 
of custom; and the majority only visited it in 
moderation. 
In the middle of the sixteenth century the 
women of the sultan’s seraglio moved into the 
temptation, these soldiers wore high collars 
that made it impossible for them to turn their 
heads, and their long, braided locks served as 
blinkers. 
As time passed, the harem grew, spreading 
outwards in labyrinthine fashion around its

central core. There are more than 400 rooms 
in its three precincts: the living quarters of the 
black eunuchs; the women’s quarters, where 
the apartments of the sultan’s mother, 
daughters and odalisques were situated; and 
the men’s apartments, where the sultan and 
the princes of the blood lived. 
One enters the harem through a gate 
leading into the Domed Hall with Cabinets, 
where merchants deposited jewellery, furs and 
clothing for the concubines. The living quarters 
of the black eunuchs, which have a courtyard 
decorated with blue, green and turquoise cer- 
amic tiles, are three storeys high. The size and 
decoration of the apartments and the baths 
varied according to the eunuchs’ rank. 
At the entrance to the women’s quarters, 
an inscription on the bronze door recalls the 
sultan’s sovereignty. This is a world where the 
play of light, the splendour of the ancient 
tiling and the refinement of the decoration 
combine to produce an impression of paradise 
on earth. In these apartments with their rich 
hangings, luxurious carpets and deep divans, 
it is easy to imagine the beautiful kadins (the 
sultan’s principal consorts, officially recog- 
nized as such though not married to him) 
waiting bejewelled for their master. 
The way to the apartments of the valide 
sultan lies through a courtyard, decorated with 
twenty-five marble columns. From a small 
wooden belvedere situated nearby, it was pos- 
sible to survey all the activities of the harem. 
These palatial quarters comprise a series 
of rooms in the Western style, with 
monumental chimneypieces, mirrors and areas 
of wall decorated with paintings. In the 
bedroom are panels painted with imaginary 
landscapes, a baldaquin of gilded wood, and 
divans with shimmering fabric. An arched 
doorway leads to the queen mother’s private 
prayer room. 
The queen mother’s baths are arranged in 
the same way as those of her son. The first 
room was for undressing, while sipping drinks 
or sherbets; in the second cold water was 
provided; hot water in the third. The basins 
and tubs were of alabaster. 
The sultan’s private apartments consist of 
four great rooms, the most beautiful and the 
best preserved of the harem. In the Imperial 
Hall, a dais with marble columns and a balus- 
trade of gilded wood encrusted with mother- 
of-pearl was used by male musicians and 
singing girls. The sultan’s throne, surmounted 
by a baldaquin, stood on a pearl carpet which 
had been embroidered in the harem. On his 
visits to the harem this was where he gave the 
receptions that no one from the city or even 
the palace could attend, where the women 
danced, played music and recited poems. 
The vast Privy Chamber of Murad III, 
which was built by the great architect Sinan, 
displays all the splendour and nobility of late- 
sixteenth-century Ottoman art. Its beautifully 
worked dome is supported by four arches. The 
decoration of the walls is handled in such a way 
as to present a subtle gradation of colours and 
light, from lower panels coated with a unique 
red varnish (the secret of their manufacture 
perished with the Iznik craftsman who made 
them) to stained-glass windows above. A foun- 
tain decorated with stone flowers and a huge 
gilded hearth are set opposite one another.

Harem, and the incessant murmur of water, 
it is said, served to muffle the voice of the 
prince during his secret conversations. . . . 
Beneath the Privy Chamber, the women 
disported themselves in a marble swimming- 
pool, opening on one side onto a second, out- 
door pool. 
Other rooms still wait to be visited: the 
apartment of the crown prince, where gold, 
mother-of-pearl and ivory are fabulously min- 
gled; the so-called Meeting Place of the Jinns, 
a narrow corridor that was nonetheless an 
important artery of the harem in which many 
a conspiracy was hatched; the Golden Way, 
the passage the sultan used to go to religious 
celebrations. It is said that when a new sultan 
ascended the throne, he would throw golden 
coins at all the women of the harem lined up 
along these walls. 
Leaving the harem by the Aviary Gate is 
like waking from a dream. The harem is 
unlike any other palace. It is an unreal resi- 
dence, a paradise that enchants by its refine- 
ment but chills by its prisonlike aspect. 
Iron rules 
The harem has been the theatre of many dra- 
matic events, but its inflexible laws remained 
the same for four centuries. 
All the women of the harem were bought 
and became slaves of the sultan. They were 
magnificent girls, recruited from among the 
captives of conquered lands. The age of entry 
ranged from five to sixteen. In the intrigue- 
48 filled chambers of the court, it was beauty, not

birth, that could win advancement by 
attracting the sultan’s eye. Most of the girls 
were destined to remain servants, but those 
picked out by the harem superintendent, a 
woman known as the kaya kadin, received a 
thorough education, so they might please the 
ruler. 
Life in the harem was punctuated by the 
festivities held to celebrate births and mar- 
riages. Normally girls who failed to attract the 
sultan were freed at the age of twenty-five, 
when they received a pension for life and were 
given in marriage to a member of the court 
or the clergy. 
It 1s hard to say exactly how many women 
lived in the harem. Ottoman sources say 700, 
which would seem to be a maximum in view 
of the space alloted them. A document dating 
from the beginning of the seventeenth century 
puts the figure at 456. 
In the harem, the word of the valide sultan 
was law. Through weakness or incapacity, 
some sultans even allowed their mother to 
govern in their place. She alone possessed 
sumptuously decorated apartments and a civil 
and a military household. Even more signifi- 
cantly, her apartments were the only ones that 
had access to the sultan’s private chambers. 
The custom of employing eunuchs to 
guard the palace women was a very ancient 
one. Originating in Mesopotamia, it spread 
around the world, from China to Rome. The

Ottoman harem was no exception to the rule, 
The black eunuchs who had charge of it from 
the end of the sixteenth century retained their 
power and influence until the end of the 
imperial period. 
The eunuchs, who came from Africa, 
especially Ethiopia, were subjected to an iron 
discipline. Their most important tasks 
included preventing outsiders from entering 
the harem and stopping the women from 
absconding. They received a training com- 
parable to that given to the royal pages; they 
lost their own names, being given those of 
flowers instead, and were taught music and cal- 
ligraphy. Their commander was the third 
highest officer of the empire. 
A fragile jewel 
In order to draw the attention of the interna- 
tional community to the wonders of the Tur- 
kish patrimony, the Director-General of 
UNESCO launched an appeal in 1983 for the 
protection of the historic quarter of Istanbul 
and other sites. One of the priorities was the 
restoration and rehabilitation of the Topkapi 
Palace. 
In the nineteenth century, the sultan 
moved to the palace of Dolmabahce and Top- 
kapi was abandoned to the surveillance of a 
few guards. The building suffered substantial 
damage: there was a fire in 1863 and an earth- 
quake in 1894, while in 1871 some buildings 
were demolished to make way for a railway 
line. After the proclamation of the republic, 
the palace was transformed into a museum, 
but only part of the complex was placed under 
the control of the its directors. 
The harem 1s, naturally, one of the jewels 
of the palace; its architecture is an exceptional 
memorial to the richness and diversity of 
Ottoman civilization. Its reputation has con- 
tinued to grow. Projects, excavations and 
investigations have multiplied; more than 400 
studies of it have been published. 
Built as it is of wood, it is particularly vul- 
nerable to the risk of fire, and the first pri- 
ority is an efficient system of alarms and extin- 
guishers. Restoring the building is no easy 
task, for, as with any monument, its architec- 
tural features need to be respected, both inside 
and out. That means using the original 
materials, including ivory, ebony, teak and 
gold leaf, all hard to come by these days. In 
spite of the precautions taken to protect it 
from unfavourable weather conditions, the 
edifice is rapidly ageing and considerable main- 
tenance and repair work is needed.

### 90315: Yunus Emre: anniversary

sary of the birth of Yunus Emre, who was 
probably the most significant folk poet in the 
history of Islamic literature, besides being the 
most important Turkish poet up to the twen- 
tieth century. His poetry embodies the quin- 
tessence of Turkish-Anatolian Islamic 
humanism and has been a source of inspira- 
tion in Turkish intellectual life through the 
ages. His verses include eloquent specimens of 
tolerance and universalism: 
Mystic is what they call me, 
Hate 1s my only enemy. 
I harbour a grudge against none. 
To me the whole wide world is one. 
Many of Yunus Emre’s fundamental con- 
cepts are rooted in the Sufi tradition, particu- 
larly as exemplified by the thirteenth-century 
mystic and poet Rumi, who lived in Anatolia 
but wrote in Persian. In this Rumi resembled 
the writers and thinkers of medieval Europe 
who used Latin in preference to their national 
languages. But Yunus Emre, like Dante, 
adopted the vernacular of his own people. 
Because he spoke their language and brought 
a message of divine love, he became a legen- 
dary figure and came to be regarded as a saint. 
For seven centuries his verses have been 
memorized, recited and celebrated in the 
heartland of Anatolia. Even today most Turks 
can read and appreciate him without too much 
recourse to the dictionary, while they find 
many classical poets of the fourteenth to 
nineteenth centuries quite unintelligible. 
But it is not for reasons of language alone 
that Yunus Emre appeals to us today. His 
themes and concerns are both timeless and 
universal, relevant to not only to Turkey but 
to the whole world, and as much now as ever 
before. For we live in an age that sees war as 
evil and the supreme crime against humanity. 
Love is the celebration of life, an idea which 
is forcefully expressed in the catchword from 
the 1960s and 1970s: “Make love, not war”. 
Translated into mystical terms, this means that 
it has both a human and a divine dimension, 
and it is here that we catch an echo from the 
poetry of Yunus Emre: 
Vy FR 
  
Portrait of Yunus Emre 
by the contemporary Turkish artist 
Siiheyl Unver. 
I am not here on earth for strife. 
Love 1s the mission of my life. 
It is a poetry that speaks to us through the 
centuries, expressing the ecstasy of com- 
munion with nature and union with God. 
This theme of union with God frequently 
appears in his writing as an ideal which is 
about to be realized, while his humanism 
includes, in Hegel's words, the “urging of the 
spirit outward—that desire on the part of man 
to become acquainted with his world”. 
Yunus Emre spurned book learning if it 
did not have a humanistic relevance, because 
he believed in man’s godliness. In this sense 
he had affinities with Petrarch, also writing 
in the fourteenth century, and with Erasmus, 
a century later, who, as part of their classical 
or Renaissance humanism, shunned the dog- 
matism imposed on man by scholasticism. 
Like them, he sought to instil in ordinary 
people a renewed sense of the importance of 
life on Earth, but like Dante, he explored the 
ethical dimension of mortal life while 
depicting the higher values of immortal being. 
Yunus Emre’s lines are memorable: 
Whoever has one drop of love 
Possesses God's existence. 
About Yunus Emre’s life we know very 
little, and what we do know tends to be a 
matter of legend rather than ascertainable fact. 
He is said to have been illiterate for most if 
not all of his life, yet the poems display an eru- 
dition and a richness of allusion that could 
hardly be expected from an illiterate. In any 
case, it is the poems themselves that count, and 
some of them are magnificent. 
Yunus Emre’s poetry is dominated by a 
unitary vision of man and nature. Through his 
I 
by Talat Sait Halman 
humanism he seeks to enrich human existence 
and to ennoble it by liberating man from 
dogma and by placing him in a relationship of 
love with God. His view of love is creative and 
non-exclusive: “In God’s world there are a 
hundred thousand kinds of love”, and “When 
love arrives, all needs and flaws are gone.” He 
was concerned about all people, particularly the 
deprived, and this is what gives his poetry its 
intensely moving quality. He was the first poet 
in Turkish history to create an “aesthetics of 
ethics”, and in this he has never been surpassed. 
He stressed the ecumenical ideal: 
We regard no one’s religion as contrary to ours. 
True love is born when all faiths are united. 
Much of his work 1s a testament to the 
equality of all human beings. In an age marked 
by conflict and destruction, Yunus Emre gave 
voice to an all-embracing love, proclaiming a 
belief in a universal fellowship that transcends 
all schisms and sects: 
The world is my true ration 
Its people are my nation. 
He was a man of the people and for the 
people—a spokesman for social justice who 
spoke out courageously against the oppression 
of the underprivileged by rulers, landowners, 
officials and religious leaders. He thus stood 
in the mainstream of a humanist tradition that 
has always claimed the moral right to criticize 
the Establishment and the powers that be. 
And, in what could be seen as an anticipation 
of the spirit of the United Nations and 
UNESCO, he made a poetic plea for world 
peace and fellowship which is still supremely 
relevant in today’s world, convulsed as it is 
by violence and war: 
Come let us all be friends for once 
Let us make life easy on us 
Let us love and let us be loved ones 
The world shall be left to no one. [|

CORRECTIONS 
Mr. José Serra-Vega, the author of 
the article “An ecological Eldorado, 
Peru's Manu National Park”, which 
appeared in our August-September 
1991 issue, has asked us to make 
certain amendments to the text as 
published. The spectacled bear (page 
75) is found in many parts of South 
America. For “black lizard" (page 
76) please read “black cayman” 
(Melanossuchus niger). There are only 
about a hundred giant otters in the 
Park (page 76), and in most parts of 
the Amazon basin these animals are 
near extinction. The anaconda and 
the aquatic boa (page 77) are identical 
creatures. We apologize for these 
errors, which did not feature in the 
original text as written by Mr. 
Serra-Vega. 
The sculpture “Masked Phantoms” 
by Clara DeLamater reproduced in 
the “Encounters’ feature of our 
November 1991 issue (“Environment 
and Development: A Planetary 
Commitment”) is of bronze and not 
clay.

APPEAL 
T0 SUBSCRIBERS 
The UNESCO Courier is a unique venture in journalism. Published in 35 languages and sold in 
120 countries, it is a non-profit magazine produced to serve an international public. Its mission 
is to help its readers to keep abreast of world issues by reporting on them in a way that takes 
into account the broad spectrum of attitudes and opinions that characterize humanity today. 
Through fidelity to this mission—and to encourage the promotion, printing and distribution 
of the magazine in the four corners of the world—the UNESCO Courier furnishes an important 
subsidy to each of its 32 editions which are published away from UNESCO's Paris headquarters. 
Most of these editions are sold at cover prices that are far less than their real production costs, 
in countries where income levels are very low. Furthemore, the Courier bears all the production 
costs of 3 editions in Braille, which are offered free of charge to the visually handicapped. 
The Courier is also unable to count on the advertising revenue that many periodicals depend 
on and without which they could not operate. The ideals of UNESCO require us to be extremely 
vigilant in the search for such revenue. 
In spite of all these obligations, we have spared no efforts to keep the selling price of the magazine 
far below its cost price. 
However, as we are sure you will appreciate, the Courier has to pay its bills, just like everyone 
else. UNESCO has always provided the magazine with financial support as one of the many services 
it renders to the cause of international intellectual solidarity. In today’s world, however, UNESCO 
1s being called upon to meet a growing number of onerous commitments on behalf of the ideals 
it was created to defend. In the current context, in a climate of budgetary stringency, UNESCO 
is not in a position to increase the support it grants to the Courier. 
The situation is sufficiently serious for us to ask you to accept an increase in the subscription 
price—as well as introducing the magazine to your friends in the hope that they will subscribe 
in their turn. As someone who appreciates the unique role played by the Courier in bringing together 
people all over the world you will, we hope, feel able to respond favourably to this appeal.
