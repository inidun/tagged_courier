Ayacucho, capital of the Peruvian 
department of the same name, still 
lives on edge nearly 20 years after the 
Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guer- 
rillas first went into action there. Relief over 
the guerrillas’defeat is matched by the ten- 
sion of an “armed peace” maintained by the 
continued presence of underground ele- 
ments of this terrorist organization in nearby 
districts and provinces. 
Also known as Huamanga, the name 
given to the city by the Spaniards when they 
founded it on 29 January 1539, Ayacucho 
sits 2,752 metres up in a lush valley in the 
western cordillera of the Andes. Its 100,000 
inhabitants share a double heritage,speaking 
the Quechua language and living in accor- 
dance with Indian traditions, irrespective 
of social class. The local elite has managed 
to preserve this tradition of cultural duality, 
avoiding the social discrimination which 
has marred it elsewhere in Peru.

culture which produced a remarkable pre- »

tage with a rich musical tradition blending 
the sounds of Andean huayno dance music 
with a distinct romantic element of Spanish 
origin.At no time is the city more vibrant 
than during Holy Week, when Christian 
and Indian religious devotion reaches its 
apogee in Ayacucho’s 37 churches, (officially 
there are 33, to match the age of Christ at 
his death). 
The festival was cancelled for several 
years for fear of bombs and ambushes and 
because the curfew ruled out after-dark 
processions, but it bounced back in 1993, 
after the capture of the Shining Path’s 
leader, Carlos Abimaél Guzman, on Sep- 
tember 12,1992. 
Major historical landmarks are dotted 
around the city, and include the Pampa de 
Quinua, site of the Battle of Ayacucho which 
clinched Latin America’s independence 
from Spain.T he battlefield is now shaking 
off its military associations to stress cul- 
tural activities, including the Encuentro de 
Teatro, which hosts theatre groups from all 
over the world.

The cost of 
the “ dirty war” 
C™ Abimagl Guzman was a phifosophy 
professor at the University of Ayacucho 
when he founded the Shining Path breakaway 
faction of the Peruvian communist party and 
launched his™ enduring people's war’ . He began 
it in May 1980 with a symbolic act—a com- 
mando burned ballot boxes in Chuschi, a remote 
village in the area, two days before elections 
were to be held. 
The country had just emerged from 12 years 
of army rule, poverty was spiratting out of sontrof 
and anarchy reigned. At first the well-organized 
guerrillas were welcomed by the population, 
especially asthey handed out plots of land. But 
things started gaing wrong when the rebels 
began executing “traitor” peasants and fea- 
ders of community groups and installed a ruth- 
less and bloody tyranny based on fuzzy futurist 
reasoning. 
The guerrillas and their“ enemias” , the Tupac 
Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a rebel group 
founded in 1983 and destroyed by its 1996 sei- 
zure of hostages at the Japanese embassy in 
Lima,were both defeated in the “ dirty war’. 
But the toll was enormous— more than 
26,000 dead, 4,000 missing and 50,000 chifdeen 
orphaned. The government has put its cost at 
mote than $25 bitlion—the equivalent of Peru's 
foreign debt, ont which interest charges alone 
absorb a third of the foreign exchange eamed 
by exports of fish,copper, zine and silver. 
President Alberto Fujimoti, elected in 1990 
and re-elect ed five years later, began an exten- 
sive structural adjustment and privatization 
programme. He also curbed civil liberties after 
what the rest of the world calls his 1992 * civi- 
lian coup teat", when he dissolved parlia- 
ment, suspended constitutional rights and 
sacked mote than 500 magistrates 
Hyperinflation was beaten—falling from 
2,700 per cent in 1989 to just 7 per cent last 
year— and economic growth set a Latin Ame- 
rican record in 1994 with a figure of 13 per 
cent. Growth slowed last year to two per cent, 
mainly because of torrential rains set off by the 
Hf Nifto weather phenomenon and the effects of 
the Asian economic crisis. According to the 
World Bank, 54 per cent of Peru's 25 million 
people live below the poverty line and under-

victory 
UNESCO’s approach to sport is summed up in its 1978 International Charter of Phy- 
sical Education and Sport. T hese activities, the Charter says, “should seek to promote 
  
closer communion between peoples and between individuals,together with disinte- 
rested emulation,solidarity and fraternity, mutual respect and understanding, and full res- 
pect for the integrity and dignity of human beings.” 
The promotion of ethical values—especially to combat marginalization and vio- 
lence—is central to this approach. It stresses the necessity for sport to be open to everyone, 
starting with young people who are all too often sidelined because they are physically or 
mentally disabled, because they live in problem areas or just because they are female. 
UNESCO’s focus is on promoting sport for all. It believes that in a society in which people 
need to be equipped for lifelong learning, sport can make a vital contribution to educa- 
tion. For education involves much more than spoon-feeding information. Its ultimate pur- 
pose is to stimulate people’s capacity to think,create and interact with others and to use 
this capacity in order to be self-reliant, while also helping others to improve their well-being 
and quality of life.Sport is an incomparable way of achieving these aims. 
We live in a world where the gap between rich and poor keeps on growing. On the sports 
field, or failing that, in streets, courtyards, or fields, such differences disappear like magic. 
People compete against each other, but they also get together in teams, using weapons that 
are for once entirely peaceful: speed,strength,skill, endurance and intelligence—qualities 
that have nothing to do with social status. 
We live in a violent world.In cities, where two-thirds of humanity will soon be living, 
even young children go out onto the sports field bursting with the aggression they have accu- 
mulated in their daily lives. And here too, a kind of miracle takes place and the aggression 
1s transformed. Its negative and destructive charge is transmuted into a positive desire to 
beat one’s opponent—not to achieve victory at all costs and by any means, but fairly, in 
a contest governed by rules that both sides observe.In these conditions sport becomes a 
school where people can give vent to their aggressive instincts and at the same time learn 
tolerance and respect for others. T hose who practice sport become aware of forces which, 
if they are not curbed, might blindly take over their lives. 
We live in a world of worsening national, ethnic and religious antagonisms. T he capa- 
city of sport to unite people—almost to weld them together—is obvious these days. It cul- 
minates in the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup, which have given the world so 
many ennobling images of comradeship. Our pleasure is all the greater because it is 
shared on an unprecedented scale. No other modern social event makes people feel so 
strongly that they belong to a global village. 
But unfortunately there is more to sport than this. Sport is not monolithic: it takes many 
forms, and isriven by differences and disagreements. When sport hits the headlines it does 
not always glorify the heroes who have won our admiration by their performances on the 
field.Behind the scenes, but increasingly in the spotlight,is a world of wheeling and dea- 
ling, drug-taking, and athletes who are subject to premature specialization and intolerable 
stress. Barbaric chauvinism takes over when public opinion and the enthusiasm of supporters 
are fired up to fever pitch. 
In poor countries, four out five young people still have no access to adequate sports 
facilities and training. The stakes are so high in big sporting events that only the results count: 
the purpose of sport goes by the board. The designation of winners and losers is more impor- 
tant than bringing together athletes to compete under a set of rules. This is a far cry from 
the “happiness” evoked by the French poet Paul Verlaine—the happiness of “peace 
without victory”. [|

### 115594: Indigenous peoples take on big business

   
Transnational companies which mine and harvest raw materials on the rich 
lands of indigenous peoples no longer ‘have it all their own way’ 
“It’s hard to explain what’s happened to 
us. All we have left is our name: 
Amungme. The mountains, the rivers, 
the forests—everything—belongs to Free- 
port and the government now. We have 
nothing left.” 
These words of an old man in Irian Jaya 
(Indonesian-ruled West Papua), reported by 
members of Survival International,a non- 
governmental organization, sum up the loss 
and injustice felt by millions of indigenous 
peoples around the world. For more than 30 
years, according to many NGOs, the United 
Nations, European Members of Parliament 
and U.S.Senators, these “original”’inhabi- 
tants of our planet have watched their land 
being polluted,their holy places destroyed 
and their families wasting away or dying in 
the name of a “development” they are the 
last to benefit from. 
In Indonesia, the U.S. firm Freeport- 
* UNEsco Courier journalist

McMoRan, in association with the British 
company Rio Tinto and local authorities 
including ex-President Suharto, according 
to Survival, has rights to an area as big as 
Belgium in the world’s largest gold reserve, 
which is also very rich in copper. Mining has 
polluted the rivers, destroyed one of the 
world’s best-preserved virgin forests and 
desecrated religious sites. Many NGOs have 
denounced the army for using violence 
against people protesting this damage. 
In Colombia, 5,000 U wa Amerindians are 
resisting the use of their sacred lands by Occi- 
dental Petroleum. After threatening mass 
suicide, they have attracted so many suppor- 
ters that Shell has said it will pull out of its 
partnership with Occidental in the area. 
With Shell, it’s a case of once bitten, 
twice shy. In Nigeria, the company is facing 
stiff opposition from the Ogoni and Ijaw 
people, who are demanding that it should 
leave unless they obtain rights to the rich oil 
deposits on their lands. In conjunction with 
the government, Shell began drilling in 
Ogoniland in 1958 and has since extracted 
an estimated $30 billion worth of oil. 
In 1995, a World Council of Churches 
fact-finding mission reported that the local 
people had no electricity, telephones or 
basic health facilities and that the environ- 
ment was seriously damaged.The Ogonis 
say Shell had close links to the army, which 
crushed any protests. The crisis came to a 
head in November 1995, when nine Ogoni 
leaders, including the writer Ken Saro- 
Wiwa, were executed by hanging. 
Activism 
has paid dividends 
Many cases could be cited in which the 
activities of transnational companies wor- 
king hand in glove with local authorities 
bring destruction, corruption, division and 
death to the lands of indigenous peoples. 
This unacceptable situation has bolstered 
the determination of the world’s indigenous

people, who number around 300 million 
worldwide.During the 1980s, they began to 
organize themselves and in 1982 a special 
UN working group helped strengthen their 
networks and brought them to international 
attention. 
Their position was summed up in the 
1992 Declaration of Kari-Oca, in Brazil, 
whose preamble states that “We, the Indi- 
genous Peoples, maintain our inherent 
rights to self-determination and to our lands 
and territories.” Their aim is to win decision- 
making power over company projects, the 
right to oppose them and, if they approve 
them, the right to share the profits. Their 
well-publicized battle has been highlighted 
by many human rights and pro-environ- 
ment organizations, including Amnesty 
International, Human Rights Watch,Mine- 
Watch,Survival International and Friends 
of the Earth. 
A foreign company can no longer start 
operations on indigenous lands without a 
mass of websites reporting on its every 
movement. The public in rich countries 
takes other action as well,often occupying 
a company’s headquarters and boycotting 
its products. 
Such widespread activism has brought 
results. Indigenous people have long been 
considered by their states as obstacles to 
development, as groups which have to be at 
best assimilated and at worst eliminated. 
They are now recognized in several coun- 
tries, including Denmark, the United States, 
Canada and Australia, as full citizens with 
rights to their lands. In the Philippines, 
they are negotiating to monitor mining pro- 
jects. In Latin America, several countries 
have amended their national constitutions 
to give them some protection. 
In the hope of further progress, they 
are waiting with great anticipation for the 
UN declaration on their rights which is 
due to be adopted before the end of the 
United Nations Decade for Indigenous 
Peoples (1995-2004). 
They can boast of some small victories 
over the transnationals. They have forced 
several big firms, such as Mobil Oil in Peru, 
to drop projects. They have managed to 
PLANET 
get others to negotiate and to help restore 
the environment. T hey have also called for 
compensation for past injustices. But only 
rarely do they win a real share of profits,as 
some Inuits or North American Indians 
have managed to do. 
Windfalls that revive 
ethnic tensions 
“The transnationals can’t have it all 
their own way any more,” says Julian Burger, 
of the UN High Commission for Human 
Rights. The companies are losing an enor- 
mous amount of money because of sabotage 
and local resistance (Shell was forced to 
suspend operations in the Niger Delta in 
1993) and perhaps even more by discredi- 
ting themselves in the eyes of consumers in 
rich countries. 
On its website,Shell-Nigeria admits its 
“responsibility” to indigenous peoples. It 
says it spent $32 million in Nigeria in 1997, 
mainly to build schools and hospitals,and 
pledges that “until the end of the century, 


### 115594: Indigenous peoples take on big business

take 
at least a fifth of its budget” will go to res- 
toring the environment. In the same year, 
Freeport invested one per cent of its profits 
in Indonesia in development projects in 
Irian Jaya. 
After adding environmental preservation 
to their codes of conduct and in vesting in 
“cleaner” infrastructures, more and more 
transnational firms are saying they will push 
human rights issues. But on the spot, things 
‘Many existing codes of 
conduct aren’t worth the 
paper they're written on 
because they aren’t 
implemented’ 
are very tough, they point out. They are up 
against local tribal and military leaders 
more interested in making money for them- 
selves than helping the local community. 
Freeport says the first big payments it 
doled out in Indonesia to set up a develop- 
ment fund were stolen by a local govern- 
ment official. The sharing out of this wind- 
fall has revived old ethnic tensions and was 
a factor in setting off tribal warfare. And 
sometimes the anger of local people whose 
lives have been ravaged over several decades 
is too strong to be placated by a foreign 
company’s change of policy. 
When attacked by human rights cam- 
paigners who accuse them of not opposing 
repression, and even taking part in it, the 
transnationals take refuge behind the prin- 
ciple of national sovereignty, saying only 
governments have the right to make deci- 
sions about their people. It is also very hard 
for them to refuse deals on grounds of prin- 
ciple or give up a large part of their profits 
in a competitive world where shareholders 
want maximum profits. 
Ineffectual monitoring systems 
As a result, many people wants to see a 
body of laws and international rules to regu- 
late the operations of transnational firms. But 
attempts to do this have so far failed or had 
little effect. The UN centre set up in 1974 to 
draft a list of rights and responsibilities of 
transnationals was disbanded in 1993 and 
guidelines on the subject worked out by 
the Organization for Economic Co-opera- 
tion and Development (OECD) and the 
International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
are not mandatory. 
The most recent attempt in this direc- 
tion was a European parliament resolution 
in January this year calling for monitoring 
of the operations of European transnatio- 
nals, notably by holding well-advertised 
public hearings starting this June, where 
NGOs, trade unions and firms will be able 
to voice their grievances. 
“Many existing codes of conduct aren’t 
worth the paper they're written on because 
they aren’t implemented,” says Euro-MP 
Richard Howitt, who drafted the resolu- 
tion.“We want European companies to be 
monitored to see how far they comply with 
international law in the field of environ- 
ment, human rights and labour rights, in 
particular as far as indigenous peoples are 
concerned. Many indigenous groups face 
extinction and tragically European com- 
panies have been part of the threat to these 
communities.” L

not govern the activities of a sovereign 
foreign nation, just as foreign courts should

These are the issues U.S.D istrict Judge 
Jed Rakoff is due to decide in April 1999 at 
the end of a tortuous legal battle which has 
lasted more than five years. If he decides the 
case can be heard in the United States, it will 
set a very important precedent, opening 
the way for other non-U.S. citizens to sue 
U.S. firms in the United States itself. 
T he four governments Ecuador has had 
over the past six years have opposed such 
moves. For reasons of national sovereignty, 
A group of Ecuadorian Indians are suing the oil company Texaco 
for ‘ecocide’ in the U.S. courts 
One and a half billion dollars—that’s 
how much compensation 75 Cofan, 
Secoya and Quechua Indians living in 
Ecuador's Amazon region want from 
Texaco. They accuse the U.S. oil giant of 
perpetrating “ecocide” during 26 years of 
operations in Ecuador and maintain that the 
damage is continuing because the firm is 
using old equipment. 
The Indians have not sued in the courts 
of their own country but before a court in 
New York. Between 1964 and 1990, a 
consortium of aTexaco subsidiary and the 
Ecuadorian state oil company Petroecuador 
drilled 339 wells,including 232 which are 
still producing in the eastern part of the 
country and have been operated exclusively 
by Petroecuador since 1992. 
The Indians quote studies done by envi- 
ronmental organizations such as the U.S. 
National Resources Defense Council and 
the Center for Economic and Social Rights, 
both based in New York, and on research by 
scientists from the Harvard School of Public 
Health. The Indians say Texaco has pol- 
luted about a million hectares of land and 
that some 30,000 people have contracted 
skin and intestinal diseases, had mysterious 
miscarriages and in some cases developed 
cancer. 
* Ecuadorian anthropologist 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
Texaco is also accused of having released 
more than 75 million cubic metres of toxic 
liquid waste into rivers and marshlands, 
accidentally spilled more than 60,000 cubic 
metres of oil and left uncovered more than 
600 dumps containing toxic material. In 
addition, it is said to have caused conside- 
rable deforestation along with soil erosion 
and reduced biodiversity. 
Texaco has admitted that “oil spills some- 
times do occur”, but it cites investigations 
by two firms,Agra Earth and Environmental 
and Fugro McClelland, which say the Texaco 
subsidiary “acted responsibly” without cau- 
with in Ecuador. But if that happened, unlike 
in the U.S. where “class actions” (joint suits) 
are allowed every one of the 30,000 people 
affected would have to sue individually. On 
top of that, says their lawyer, Cristobal 
Bonifaz, the plaintiffs do not believe they 
will get justice in Ecuador because Ecua- 
dorian judges lack experience of such cases 
and most of all because oil interests are too 
powerful there. 
Thirteen million hectares—almost half 
the country—have been leased for explora- 
tion, mainly to international oil companies. 
Oil provides half of all Ecuador’s exports 
‘U.S courts should not govern the activities 
of a sovereign foreign nation, just as foreign courts should 
not govern the activities of the U.S’ 
sing “a lasting or significant impact” on the 
environment. Texaco adds that between 1995 
and last year, under an agreement with the 
Ecuadorian authorities, it carried out a $40 
million “remedial” programme. 
The subsidiary, it says, “consistently 
complied with the laws of Ecuador and 
international petroleum industry environ- 
mental standards” and that all its operations 
“took place under the control and supervi- 
sion of Ecuador’s government”. It adds 
that the matter should go before an Ecua- 
and 40 per cent of its national income. It is 
considered the key to the country’s progress, 
enabling some to argue that ecological 
damage is a price that has to be paid. 
But this is nonsense. Ecuador’s foreign 
debt has risen from $217 million before 
the oil boom to nearly $15 billion today, and 
70 per cent of Ecuadorians live below the 
poverty line. And oddly enough, the oil- 
fields are in the poorest parts of the country, 
where working conditions are tough and 
the pay bad.

The oil companies are notorious for per- 
suading local authorities to turn a blind eye to 
environmental damage and even for buying up 
polluted farmland so as to avoid demands for 
compensation or rehabilitation. The North

### 115596: The Kakadu controversy

The Kakadu 
controversy 
Indigenous peoples and environmental 
groups have often been at loggerheads. 
But in Australia, one group of Abori- 
gines has teamed up with environmentalists 
in a dispute over a uranium mine. 
In 1996 the Australian government gave 
permission for the mining company Energy 
Resources of Australia (ERA) to begin 
work at the Jabiluka mining site, with ura- 
nium reserves estimated to be worth more 
than $8 billion. 
The decision touched off a national and 
international controversy over Jabiluka, 
which lies in the middle of the Kakadu 
National Park, listed as a World Heritage 
Site by UNESCO. 
In areport last December, UNESCO cal- 
led on the Australian government to put a 
stop to the mining project, saying Jabiluka 
threatened the environment of Kakadu and 
the cultural heritage of the Aborigines. A 
UNEsco committee will decide this July 
whether to put Kakadu—habitat for hun-

tions should be thoroughly overhauled,and 
this is bound to involve co-operation bet-

things might be changing include talks bet- 
ween the government and indigenous 
peoples about oil and about setting up two

The Australian government says the 
UNESCO report contains errors of fact,law, 
science and logic. ERA says the report’s 
recommendations do not make “environ- 
mental,social or legal sense.” 
Lobbying and demonstrations by a coa- 
lition of 3,500 environmentalists and the 
Mirrar Aborigines, the traditional owners of 
the site, was a contributing factor in 
prompting UNESCO to investigate the 
impact of mining on them and their envi- 
ronment. 
Kakadu Aborigines remain split on the 
mining issue. There are only 28 Mirrar 
among the 500 Aborigines at Kakadu.

mencement on economic grounds.

Eccentric Pluto 
Is still a planet 
t's official:Pluto is a planet,and a major one 
at that, says the International Astronomical 
Union (IAU). However, Johannes Andersen, 
Secretary-General of the IAU, says he’s willing to 
bet that had Pluto been discovered today instead 
of in 1930,it might not have been classified as 
the ninth planet in the solar system. 
As planets go, Pluto is rather unusual. To 
begin with, it is made of ice while the other eight 
“major planets’ are either rocky or gaseous. Size 
is another strike against Pluto, which is even 
smaller than our moon. Finally, Pluto’s orbit is 
eccentric, making it the only planet to cross the 
path of another (that of Neptune). 
Many scientists consider Pluto the leader of 
a new pack of bodies called trans-Neptunian 
objects (TNOs). But astronomers are still trying 
to decide how to classify the 100 TNOs disco- 
vered since 1992. Should they form a separate 
category or slip it in with the 10,000 “minor pla- 
nets,” i.e. asteroids? 
To resolve the issue of Pluto’s classification, 
the AU asked astronomers around the world to 
cast their votes via email. News of the balloting 
caused a such a public outcry in favour of main- 
taining the status quo that the ballot was quickly 
cancelled. 
Critics in the scientific community insisted 
that the proposed changes would do nothing 
more than confuse the general public. The emo- 
tional response came “largely because kno- 
wing all planets is something you learn in ele- 
mentary school,” says Mike A’Hearn, an 
astronomer at the University of Maryland. People 
tend “ to think of this as the way the universe is,’ 
he adds. 
It may take years before we get a really close- 
up view of Pluto. The U.S. National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) plans to 
launch the Pluto-Kuiper Express, an unmanned 
space probe in 2004. It will take another six 
years for the spacecraft to reach the planet. 
Meanwhile, says Andersen, astronomers will 
keep a careful eye on TNOs and their unofficial 
leader:Planet Pluto. [|

### 115597: Pretending for real

Pretending for 
Simulation games are gaining popularity as educational tools in fields ranging 
from humanitarian action to business management and accident prevention 
The policeman checks Sonia’s passport 
I and then directs her to the prison door 
with the barrel of his gun. She doesn’t 
move. “Get in there quick,” he shouts, poin- 
ting the weapon at her face. Surprised, she 
enters the cell where other detainees are 
crammed together in the semi-darkness. Out- 
side, shouts, sirens, and explosions can be 
heard. After a while, the policeman comes 
back: “You want your passport? Then get 
down on your knees and pick it up.” She 
hesitates a few seconds before obeying. “If you 
come back here, you know what’s waiting 
for you? A bullet.” 
Sonia is starting to understand why a 
foreigner might want to seek asylum. She is 
not a refugee herself, but an 18-year-old 
French student who has come to the Parc 
de la Villette in Paris to visit an exhibition 
entitled “A different kind of journey—the 
paths of exile”. She is taking part in a simu- 
lation exercise for which she has assumed 
the identity of Sybel, a 21-year-old Turkish 
girl whose photo appears at the entrance to 
the exhibition, along with photos of 11 
other refugees of different nationalities, 
among them Luis, Leila, Vesna,Kana, Pavel, 
and Tarik. The stories of how they came to 
be exiles are acted out in detail by 27 pro- 
fessional actors who play the roles of 
officials, customs and police officers in a 
room as big as a gymnasium where airport 
customs offices and police headquarters 
have been reconstituted. There are even a 
minefield and a clandestine workshop. 
In the three months after it opened in 
November 1998, the exhibition at La Villette 
attracted over 10,000 visitors. Its educa- 
tional interest lies not so much in the words 
the actors use as in their behaviour as they 
make visitors experience the humiliations 
and contempt with which refugees are often 
treated. “I felt a profound sense of injustice,” 
refugees who seek asylum there. But this is 
just one of many applications of simula- 
tion games, which are, for example, used to 
familiarize children with the pollution 
hazards in Mexico City or Australian 
firemen with procedures for controlling 
forest fires. Today, universities and compa- 
nies all over the world are using these games 
because they have proved to be a low-cost 
and effective method of preparing people for 
the world of work. 
Role-playing in simulation games pro- 
vides flashes of insight which improve the 
‘I now think of the refugee problem in terms 
of individuals and not of figures. When | see a refugee on 
the TV news, | see above all a human being’ 
Sonia explained. “It takes a great deal of 
courage to do what Sybel did. I didn’t know 
how much a person might have to go 
through simply to live like everyone else.” 
Empathy, the imaginative power to enter 
into the feelings of others and to identify 
with them, 1s a mechanism that is widely 
used nowadays to create an awareness

loped countries of the situation faced by

quality of our perception of others and of 
given situations. It changes the way we look 
at others. “I now think of the refugee pro- 
blem in terms of individuals and not of 
figures,” said Mark Madoga on leaving La 
Villette. “When I see a refugee on the TV 
news,l see above all a human being.” 
When bombs rain down 
A similar result is obtained by “Passages”, 
a simulation game created in 1995 by the 
Office of theUnited Nations High Commis- 
sioner for Refugees (UNHCR), working with 
two psychologists and a game specialist. Like 
the La Villette exhibition, it seeks to make a 
broad audience aware of the situation confron- 
ting refugees, but it consists simply of a 30- 
page handbook and is much less costly and 
simpler to put into effect because only four lea- 
ders are needed for 50 participants. In four 
years, over 5,000 persons in Switzerland, 
Sweden, the Netherlands, Tunisia, Austria 
and Chile have taken part in the game— 
mostly scouts in the 12-to-18 age group, as 
well as students, teachers and NGO members. 
One of the most intense experiences of 
“Passages” is when participants listen blind- 
fold to a simulated bombing attack. T here is 
complete pandemonium, and in the general 
panic, families split up. Parents and chil- 
dren start to call out for one another. Claire,

in Geneva, admits that even after several 
years’ work with asylum seekers, she still did 
not understand why refugees were so insis- 
tent on keeping their families together—so 
much so that this was liable to become their 
only concern. “And then I too experienced 
the terrible sense of families being separated 
during the bombardment,” she said. “For me 
the only thing that counted from then on in 
the game was family unity.” 
Role playing in action 
Many companies now use simulation 
games to train their staff—from manual 
workers and technicians to executives—in 
such areas as marketing, production mana- 
gement and human resources. In France, a 
consultancy, Proconseil, decided to tap the 
rapid expansion of this market by creating 
a subsidiary dedicated solely to the deve- 
lopment of adult training games: CIPE 
(International Centre for Educational Peda- 
gogics). In the last ten years,the company 
has designed 25 games in 10 languages and 
trained more than 10,000 persons. Its thou- 
sand or so customers in 18 countries include 
the French companies Aérospatiale and 
Yves Saint Laurent, as well as the universi- 
ties of the Sorbonne in France and Nuova 
Magini in Italy, a university technological 
institute in Spain and Harris Semiconduc- 
tors in the United States. 
The use of simulation games began to 
spread after the Second World War, notably to 
teach business management. The most 
popular of the early games, “Top Manage- 
ment Decision Simulation”, was designed in 
1956 by the American Management Asso- 
ciation. In the 1970s, many courses giving an 
introduction to economics were developed, 
including the “Island Game” invented by 
psycho-sociologist Claude Zerbib, and Prof. 
Jean-Marie Albertini’s “The Company in 
Action”, arole game in which each participant 
playsin turn an official, an entrepreneur and 
a head of family. 
In the field of air accident prevention, 
simulation exercises have become highly 
sophisticated. John Rolfe,an expert in this 
field, not only uses conventional high-tech 
flight simulators, but also includes such 
situations as hijacking and the sudden illness 
of a pilot. In co-operation with the Royal Air 
Force and British commercial airlines, Rolfe 
reconstructed the circumstances in which 
accidents occurred and created emergency 
situations which crews must learn to handle 
by following established procedures without 
being led astray by snap judgments. 
The development of information tech- 
nology and the Internet has encouraged 
the creation of simulation games designed 
among other things to develop commer- 
cial and electoral strategies,define the most 
convenient transport timetables and make 
population and climatic forecasts based on 
different scenarios. 
Danny Saunders, who publishes The 
Intemational Simulation and GamingYearbook 
which first appeared in London in 1991, 
says the number of simulation games has 
doubled in recent years. T he United States,

» among the most active countries. In 
English-speaking business schools, simula- 
tion games are coming to be used as an 
assessment technique. “At the end of the 
course,” Danny Saunders says, “a group 
of students are asked to propose at least 
two creative ways of leading a company out 
of a crisis situation based on an authentic 
case.” 
In Spain, the use of training games has 
also grown in recent years, according to José 
Luis Menes Soler, Training Director at the 
Zaragoza International Business School 
(CESTE) whose curriculum has offered 
courses including corporate simulation 
games for the past six years. According to 
Menes Soler, “it is a revelation for students 
to see how the consequences of their deci- 
sions in a particular area such as marketing 
or finance can affect a company’s overall 
results, because all the areas of the business 
are inter-related.” It might have cost their 
companies a great deal of time and money 
had recent graduates been obliged to learn 
these consequences in a real work situation.

Africa which have adopted this kind of trai-

work and willingness to share tasks, as well as 
increased productivity, improved unders- 
tanding and appreciation of the role of mana- 
gement, a reduction in conflict in the work 
situation, innovative ideas and efforts to 
implement cost savings.” 
Suitcases that didn’t suit 
Miriam Garza, an industrial engineer 
who teaches organization and production 
management courses at the University of 
San Luis Potosi in Mexico, uses CIPE’s “Kit 
Cash” game to explain how companies func- 
tion. 
Her students are divided into three 
groups. They are asked to set up companies 
which are contending for the suitcase market. 
Each team starts out with the same amount 
of cash, and has to manage its budget, plan 
manufacturing, accounts and cash flow. As 
the game progresses, various difficulties arise, 
such as production delays caused by break- 
downs and sudden changes in customer 
tastes. 
One of the students, Gilberto Cruz, 
remembers that his team’s first excursion 
into the market was disastrous. “Our suitcases 
were far more expensive than those made by 
the competition,” he says. “We realized that 
we had not invested enough in machinery.” 
‘Observing the corporate process through simulation helps us 
to detect faults in our production system because it provides 
us with a model showing how things should really function’ 
long that they often lack adequate expe- 
rience. To remedy this shortcoming many 
South African companies use training games 
such as “Team Business”, created by Busi- 
ness Education Design. The participants 
are divided into five groups, each of which 
is responsible for creating a company to 
manufacture and sell cardboard boxes. The 
players must find raw material suppliers, 
negotiate loans with banks, buy the neces- 
sary equipment and design their products. 
According to Esmo Ndzimande, an exe- 
cutive with South Africa’s ESKOM power 
company, this game is a valuable introduc- 
tion to the general principles of manage- 
ment and prepares employees to react to 
rapid change. “What’s more,” he says, 
“observing the corporate process through 
simulation helps us to detect faults in our 
production system because it provides us 
with a model showing how things should 
really function.” 
According to a study by South Africa’s 
National Productivity Institute (NPI), 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
Forced to cut their production costs in 
order to compete, the young people had to 
reappraise the ideas they had studied in the 
classroom because they had not learned how 
to apply them in practice. “Until we realized 
that the market was not interested in our 
suitcases,” Cruz adds, “we didn’t unders- 
tand the importance of good planning and 
sound market research. Seeing the other 
teams make a profit while we were crippled 
with debts was far more effective than any 
amount of classroom theory.” 
Training games are increasingly used. But 
how effective are they?T heir advocates believe 
they are a marvellous way of capturing parti- 
cipants’ attention. T hey illustrate complex pro- 
cesses in a simple manner and are a useful 
tool for making the public aware of all kinds of 
problems. But objective assessment methods 
are essential: in what sense and in which situa- 
tions is simulation better than other teaching 
methods and why? According to Danny Saun- 
ders “that is the great challenge of the learning 
game”. nu

i hn is teaching people how to operate a 
screw -making machine” Soon,the fami- 
liar image this sentence conjures of someone 
demonstrating a huge machine in front of a 
group of students will require a visual update. 
John will be sitting alone in front of his computer 
screen, his students will be scattered all over the 
world and the machine will, physically, not exist. 
Welcome to the age of online, three-dimen- 
sional training. 
John will be able to teach his class from any 
place he likes because he and his students will 
be linked up through the Internet (see the UNesco 
Courier, October 1998). There won’t be any 
more need for an actual machine, which will be 
replaced by a “virtual” one—that is, a picture 
which includes the illusion of “depth” —the 
third dimension— and displays the machine 
from various angles. The advantages for stu- 
dents are obvious. They'll have the benefit of 
three-dimensional viewing and be linked in a 
network. 
Such is the goal of UNesco’s“ Virtual Univer- 
sity” project. It involves “employing three- 
dimensional images until now used in com- 
puter game programmes, so as to create virtual 
environments in which people can learn,” says 
Philippe Quéau, head of UNEsco’s Information 
and Informatics Division. 
The first step isto bring together two different 
worlds— official French educational institutions 
such asthe University Institute for Teacher Trai- 
ning (IUAM), the National Centre for Distance 
Learning (CNED), and a private firm (Cryo) which 
creates virtual images and will contribute its 
three-dimensional simulation technology. 
After bridging this gap, UNEsco hopes to find 
partners interested in helping to introduce the 
project to poor countries. The programme would 
sponsor the setting up of virtual educational 
communities and improve distance learning in 
science and technology. But for now, says Quéau, 
“the main thing is to obtain more funding to 
continue developing educational programmes 
using computers.” [|

A harsh wind is blowing through big-time sport these days, highlighting corruption and Nifty footwork.A Zambian

drug scandals, enormous salaries, stock exchange raids on top teams and the exploitation 
of child workers who stitch balls or sports shoes. 
Yet nothing checks the soaring popularity of sport. Millions of players and competitors 
strive for stardom and millions of fans cheer their heroes on. Egged on by the media, by 
politicians and by the makers of sports equipment, more and more people are falling under 
the spell of great sporting events which have become quasi-religious rituals. 
Our survey looks at the ways in which these passions are fired and at the joys and 
successes they can bring. But it also examines the downside of a situation in which the 
myths attached to sport are manipulated by powerful forces. 
Sport leads neither to perdition nor paradise. It should not be seen as the latest example 
of the opium of the people or as a pretext for violence. Nor is it a miracle solution which 
can neutralize dangerous tensions, promote greater freedom and improve human relations. 
Most likely it is a mixture of all these factors. Certainly, as French sports historian 
Bernard Jeu has put it, it is an important way for societies “to confront themselves.”

Basketballer Michael Jordan’s announcement 
A on January 13 that he was retiring made head- 
lines all around the world. He was up there with 
Pelé, they said. The American superstar’s skill has 
dazzled everyone who has watched him dashing 
around a basketball court; as he leaps to dunk the 
ball in the net he seems to be momentarily sus- 
pended in the air. They call him “Air Jordan.” 
But Jordan, the Chicago Bulls star whose income 
as a player last season was estimated at $30 million, 
is also at the head of a business empire. His impact 
on the U.S.economy is reckoned by Fortune maga- 
zine at $10 billion. His link with the sporting goods 
firm Nike is believed to have generated about $5.2 
billion in sales of shoes and clothing. 
Idol of the world’s youth he may be, but people 
argue about the role in society that he has—or 
hasn’t—played.T he basketball shoes carrying his 
name have been stitched by child workers in sweat- 
shops, say U.S. trade unions. He has never spoken 
up for Black causes,say leaders of the Black Ame- 
rican community. Has he not set up thousands of 
young people for a big fall because he is such a 
symbol of social advancement and success?Try as 
they might to emulate him, their chances of suc- 
ceeding are close to nil. 
In fact, has he not been a huge publicity machine 
which has strengthened social inequalities in the 
U.S. and other countries and helped big transna- 
tional companies to conquer a world market? 
In August 1998, notes Siavosh Ghazi in his article 
on page 20 of this issue, 40 Iranian women footbal- 
lers were given permission to train in a stadium in 
Teheran for the first time in 20 years. In a sense, they

Alice Millat, who founded the International Women’s 
Sports Federation and then, in 1922, launched the 
first women’s Olympic games. Women athletes are still 
in a minority in the Olympics, after making their debut 
in tennis and golf. Only a little more than a third of the 
competitors at the last summer Olympics were women. 
Even today women are still battling for complete equa- 
lity and fair treatment in sport. 
People with physical disabilities have removed one 
barrier that discriminated against them in sport.M ore 
and more disabled athletes,using special facilities,are 
today playing the same sports as the non-disabled. 
They have their own sports meetings, and since 1960 
they have had their own Olympic games. However, 
the presence of the disabled in mainstream clubs is 
still rare and the example of the Norwegian swimmer 
described on page 22 is an exception. 
So is sport an instrument manipulated by the 
powerful? Or is it a lifeline for those who are 
marginalized and excluded by society? Can it be an

### 115598: What's in a game?

The spell of sport 
  
outlet for social discontent?T he examples cited above 
provide no straightforward answer to these ques- 
tions. In some cases sport serves the establishment; 
in others it can be a seedbed for social activism. At one 
and the same time it plays a host of contradictory 
social roles at local, national and international level. 
Sport does not speak with a single voice. It is 
not monolithic. It holds different meanings for dif- 
ferent social groups,partly depending on what they 
want to get out of it. For the well-heeled, sport can be 
a way of advertising their social status. Playing at 
exclusive golf, tennis or cricket clubs can be an 
opportunity to display membership of a privileged 
group. Amateur sport was controlled for a long time 
by such people. 
At the other end of the spectrum, sport prac- 
tised with the most rudimentary facilities can be a 
great form of self-expression for disadvantaged young 
people the world over, and may—in exceptional 
cases—offer them a way out of poverty and depriva- 
tion. Here the myth of sport as a ticket to upward 
mobility can be seen in its quintessential form. The 
profiles of a young Korean tennis prodigy (page 23) 
and a footballer from Cote d’Ivoire who finds him- 
self out on the street after once being hailed as the Pelé 
of his neighbourhood (page 24) illustrate the force and 
fragility of this myth. 
The kaleidoscope of sport also includes the big- 
time spectacular events which have become first and 
foremost a commodity whose economic importance 
and presence in the media are growing non-stop 
(see boxes below). And finally there’s sport as it is 
enjoyed by so many people around the world—a 
pastime that helps to keep them fit and brings them 
together in a convivial setting. But here too the com- 
petition can be intense, and the atmosphere may 
turn sour. It’samong amateur sportsmen and sports- 
women that drug-abuse is rife and where on-the- 
field clashes can be the most violent. 
Sport is something more than a mirror of the 
societies in which it is played. It is not a carbon copy 
of their inequalities and problems. It is a world in its 
own right, with its own life and its own contradictions.

Through the medium of sport, countless volunteers, for 
example, organize activities and events that make a posi- 
tive contribution to their communities (see article on 
Midnight Basketball in the U.S. on page 25). Through 
sport, a strong feeling of comradeship develops among 
athletes at all levels. In short, major social issues 
influence sport, just as sport can play a big part in hel- 
ping to solve them. 
In a world in which all gifted young athletes were 
talent-spotted and given equal opportunities to develop 
their skills, sporting encounters really would take place 
on a level playing field. But we do not live in an ideal 
world. The great myth surrounding sport is that it 
abolishes social divisions, or at least that its symbolic 
force gives it a greater capacity to do so than any other 
social activity. But the fact remains that the essence of 
sport is competition,and competition means making 
comparisons, setting up hierarchies and separating 
winners from losers. |

### 115599: Iranian women put on their running shoes

Iranian women put on 
their running shoes Siavosh Ghazi* 
Sportswomen are slowly making headway in Iran even if men aren’t allowed 
to watch them perform and vice versa 
Iranian history as a victory for women. Forty 
of them took part in an amateur football trai- 
ning session at Teheran’s Hejab Stadium. Since the 
start of the country’s Islamic Revolution in 
February 1979, women had been forbidden to

* Journalist in Teheran, Iran play football. “Schoolgirls, students and older 
Ladies join Lord’s 
ast September, when London's all-male Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) voted to admit 
Lo to full membership some rejoiced that a bastion of male privilege had decided to 
join the 20th century just before the next one began. 
“1am delighted and excited by the decision,” said club president Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie. 
“Women are a very fine species.” Not everyone was so rapturous, however.“ This means the 
end of life aswe know it,” one middle-aged member was heard to say. 
Cricket, an 11-a-side game with bat and ball that wasinvented in England over 200 years 
ago, has been played for years by women, aswell as men, at national and international level. 
So why should there be so much fuss about one club’s insistence on keeping its maverick sexist 
status? The answer is that MCC wrote the rules of cricket ran the game until 1969,and still 
has a powerful if largely symbolic voice as guardian of the sport’s heritage. 
MCC's ground,Lord’s, is for example the headquarters of international cricket's gover 
ning body, the International Cricket Council,which groups 9 countries or areas qualified to 
play top-level international test matches, as well as a list of 42 associate and affiliate mem- 
bers ranging from Argentina to Zimbabwe. 
Last September's poll,in which nearly 80 per cent of MCC's 17,500 members (average 
age 57) took part, was the club’s third vote on women’s membership. On the first occasion 
in 1991, the pro-women lobby got a drubbing. Second time round, in February 1998, they won 
56 per cent of votes. In September the two-thirds majority required to change the club’s mem- 
bership rules was just achieved. 
Some observers wondered whether the result was prompted by a sense of survival 
rather than a real change of heart. MCC was worried that it might fall foul of possible UK legis- 
lation requiring private clubs with any kind of public role to admit both sexes. An MCC appli- 
cation for National Lottery funding had been turned down partly because of the sexist 
admissions policy. Perhaps some “ yes” voters thought that since there was an 18-year wai- 
ting list for membership they would not have to live with the consequences anyway. 
In March it was announced that ten honorary women members had joined the club. By 
virtue of a specially drawn up dress code, they will be allowed to rub shoulders with men in 
the club pavilion—but only as long as their shoulders are covered. There is even talk of sel- 
ling MCC silk nighties in the club shop. “Women are going to be looked after in every 
conceivable capacity when they become members,” Ingleby-Mackenzie was reported as 
saying. [| 
2 0 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
women were there that day simply because they 
loved football,” Mahnaz Amir Shaghaghi, who 
coached the training session, says with a hint of 
pride. 
Female enthusiasm for football really took off in 
November 1997 during the qualifying matches for 
the 1998 World Cup. When the Iranian team unex- 
pectedly scored a narrow victory over the Austra- 
lians, who were playing at home and were in tip-top 
form, the whole country exploded with joy, from the 
capital to the smallest villages. Millions of men and 
women poured into the streets. 
A welcome for the returning heroes was set for 
a week later at the Azadi Stadium, south of Teheran. 
The authorities made it clear on radio and television 
that women would not be allowed into the sta- 
dium, but to no avail.Five thousand women forced 
their way in past astonished police, an event unseen 
since women were banned in 1992 from attending 
all-male sporting events and vice versa. 
‘Women had been allowed 
to play basketball, but not 
football. But whether 
you touch the ball with hand 
or foot, it’s the same’ 
The same delirium seized the country when 
the Iranians beat the U.S. team 2-1 in the French 
city of Lyons during theWorld Cup on June 21.It 
led to many appeals for women to be officially 
allowed to play football. T he popular young Iranian 
actress Shifteh Farahani said she “preferred playing 
football to watching films.” Faezeh Hashemi, a 
member of parliament (and daughter of former 
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani), 
who has done much to promote women’s sport, 
finally persuaded the authorities to give in, to the 
delight of female football fans. “Women had been 
allowed to play basketball, but not football,” says 
Shaghaghi. “But whether you touch the ball with 
hand or foot,it’s the same.” 
Before the Revolution, all sports were open to 
women but they only featured at national and 
international level in four of them—volleyball,bas- 
ketball, athletics and swimming. Sportswomen 
recall how they were never encouraged. “Before

1979, you had to choose between sport and the 
veil,” says Hashemi. 
From the start of the Revolution, the govern- 
ment tried to curb women’s sports. “The hard- 
liners had a reactionary reading of religion,” says a 
journalist. “It all boils down to the way you interpret 
the scriptures.” But even the moderates were against 
women wearing sports gear in front of men. This was 
only allowed amongst other women. 
These days there are women active in 25 sports, 
including skiing, volleyball, basketball, shooting, 
rowing, karate, judo and gymnastics. The strict 
segregation of men and women has had some posi- 
tive effects. “Many women have been trained in 
recent years as referees and coaches—about 16,000

s 
of them, in all sports,” says Shaghaghi. Iran now has 
56 international-level women trainers for volleyball 
and six for fencing, for example. And in recent 
months, women have been taking part in motor- 
racing. “Theoretical and practical courses began 
three months ago and have been a great success,” 
says a reporter on the daily newspaper Zan (which 
means “woman” in Persian). 
“The separation of the sexes has encouraged 
many traditional Iranian families to allow their 
daughters to play sports,which they hadn’t up till 
then,” says Jilla Amiri, who played football during 
the time of the Shah. Sport is also more open to 
young women from the middle or lower classes. 
But equipment and facilities are very meagre. 
“Most sports centres are reserved for men,” says 
Amiri.“We don’t have a tenth of the facilities they 
have. Radio and television never report on women’s 
sports, not even championship matches. Pictures of 
such events cannot be shown and this is a serious 
block to the development of women’s sport.” 
The women’s daily Zan is an exception. It 
reports on women’s sports and encourages its rea- 
ders to play up to professional level. T he paper is run 
in fact by Faezeh Hashemi, who managed to get a

traditional Iranian families 
to allow their daughters 
to play sports, which they hadn’t

cycle path built in a park south of the capital where 
boys and girls could ride their bikes together. 
Even more significantly, she has pushed the 
idea of an Islamic Women’s Games, of which two 
have since been held in Iran. In 1993, 11 coun- 
tries took part, with a total of 345 women in 
eight sports, including shooting, table tennis, 
handball and basketball. In 1997, nearly 1,000 
women from 21 countries came to Teheran to 
compete in 13 sports, including tennis, chess,gym- 
nastics, karate, swimming and equestrianism. 
Countries involved included Syria, Bangladesh, 
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Indonesia 
and Kuwait. The events were shown on televi- 
sion, but were filmed from a distance. Even these 
broadcasts were cancelled after objections from 
conservatives. 
Such occasions give Iranian women a chance to 
compete against foreign teams, even if they them- 
selves are not so skilled. For higher profile interna- 
tional events, the ban on showing themselves in 
sports gear, especially shorts, in front of men remains 
a sizeable obstacle. But a woman was in the national 
shooting team at the last Olympic Games and an Ira- 
nian woman skier won a bronze medal at the Asian 
Games at the end of last year. T hese are two sports 
that may well attract growing numbers of Iranian 
women in times ahead. u

### 115600: Training for life

Training for life 
Ole Kristian Bjellaanes” 
Disabled Norwegian student Stig Morten Sandvik has won medals as a swimmer. 
But sport has above all helped him achieve confidence and self-respect 
“It’s thanks to sport that I'm so independent in 
A life. Sport has meant everything to me,” says 
Stig Morten Sandvik, a 28-year-old Norwe- 
gian political science student who trains for 12 
hours every week to become a better swimmer. 
Stig Morten, who lives at Bodoe, in Nordland 
county, was born with Arthrogryposis multiplex 
congenita (AMC), a disease which affects the 
muscles. This makes him dependent on a wheel- 
chair, although he can also move around using 
crutches. 
He was six when his mother first took him to the 
swimming pool. He took to the water and soon 
came to feel that swimming would play a big part in 
his life. The gold medals he has won in World Cham - 
pionships and the bronze medals he took in the 
Paralympics in 1992 and 1996 prove just how 
important it became. 
But for Stig Morten, as for many other disabled 
persons,sport has far more to do with managing his 
life than with winning prizes. “My sporting activity 
made me a normal Norwegian boy. I was able to do 
something as well as all my friends,” he says. It also 
made him very independent in his daily life. When 
he was 16 and about to graduate from high school, 
he chose to live alone. Now he is moving in with his 
girlfriend. 
Bringing the barriers down 
He is sufficiently independent to be able to 
clean his apartment by himself. He cooks and goes 
shopping on his own.“The only thing I can’t do is 
change light bulbs,” he says. 
In Norway most disabled people have their own 
houses or apartments, and look after themselves, 
sometimes with support from personal care assistants. 
Very few of them live in special institutions. Stig 
Morten feels totally integrated, and few people even 
comment that he has a girlfriend without a han- 
dicap. He is also convinced that his sport gives him 
a self-respect and self-confidence that disabled people 
who don’t practice such an activity may lack. 
Some 22,000 physically and mentally handi- 
capped people are members of Norway’s association 
for disabled athletes. In 1996 the Norwegian sports 
movement decided to make an effort to integrate 
sport for disabled people and sport for “normal” 
people. This is in line with developments in the 
rest of a society where disabled people are pro- 
vided with facilities such as transport and personal 
assistance to help their social integration.

Around $700,000 are being invested every year in 
programmes to bring disabled and non-disabled ath- 
letes together in the same clubs. Stig Morten is him- 
self now a member of an ordinary sports club. Sports 
clubs are also receiving money to improve access for 
disabled people to arenas which were originally built 
only for the non-disabled. 
In some sports such as shooting, disabled and 
non-disabled athletes can perform on equal terms if 
suitable arrangements are made. In many cases, 
according to the association for handicapped athletes, 
it is only social barriers that keep handicapped and 
non-handicapped apart. 
“This 1s going to change, and it is very important 
that it should.But I think it may take 10 or 15 years 
before all the barriers come down,” Stig Morten 
says. 
Another thing that helps to bring barriers down 
and develop greater tolerance, Stig Morten thinks, 
is the fact that he trains in the pool with non-disa- 
bled children and adults. 
Stig Morten Sandvik has achieved success in the 
swimming pool, and hopes to continue as a top-level 
swimmer for a few more years. But he feels that his grea- 
test achievement—one that can not be valued in gold, sil- 
ver or bronze—has already been won: self-confidence 
and the belief that he can do things that people who 
don’t have to use a wheelchair take for granted. u

### 115601: Going for glory

Going for glory 
Glenn Manarin with additional reporting by Myung-soo Kim Taejon” 
A promising 12-year-old Korean tennis-player who seems to be relishing 
the pressure as he quests for athletic perfection and international acclaim 
  
* Journalists in Taejon, 
South Korea 
Dong-whee Choi in action. 
   
Under the mid-morning sun at Chungnam 
A National University in Taejon, South Korea, 12- 
year-old Dong-whee Choi is hitting baseline 
forehands weighted with topspin and punchy two- 
handed backhands to a player twice his age from the 
university team. With the snow-capped mountains 
of Kyerong-san in the distance, Choi is hard at 
training, filling the days of winter vacation on sand 
courts. 
Like many other children his age, Choi has 
dreams of athletic wonder. But unlike the vast majo- 
rity, he is on the path to realizing his dreams, along 
with those of his family, coach and, perhaps one day, 
those of his country. 
Choiis going to Bradenton, Florida,accompa- 
nied by his coach and his 10-year-old sister Ha-yang, 
thanks to a five-year scholarship from the interna- 
tionally renowned Nick Bollettieri’s Tennis Aca- 
demy. At Bollettieri’s, which boasts alumni including 
many of Choi’s heroes—such as tennis greats Pete 
Sampras and André Agassi—Choi will find the 
competition and training facilities he needs to meet 
his soaring aspirations. He will also face unprece- 
dented pressure at what is often described as a 
“boot camp” where nothing less than winning is 
accepted—an approach which he seems to relish. 
Six hours a day on the court 
“My first goal is to win the U.S. Open and I want 
to be at least one of the top-five ranked players in the 
world,” says the winsome youth, his demureness 
momentarily dissipated by his fervour for the sport. 
“I’ve never considered how long it’s going to take to 
happen.I never think about my age.” 
Children like Choi, so strangely determined, 
evoke admiration but also a nagging concern that 
they have been pressured to succeed by aggressive 
parents. Some might also question the wisdom of let- 
ting such a young child invest so much towards 
such a distant goal. Yet as Choi’s experience high- 
lights, it could be even more difficult for a parent to 
tell a child: “Give up your dreams of glory.” 
Choi was first introduced to tennis at the age of 
three when his father, In-chul Choi, a lieutenant- 
colonel in the South Korean military and a keen 
tennis player, bought him a toy racket. At six, he gra- 
duated to a real racket, playing regularly with his 
father. While his parents say they initially intended 
for Choito enjoy the sport recreationally, they later 
sought to develop the boy’s apparent potential by 
hiring 45-year-old Choong-sup Song as coach in 
1994. “He wasn’t so great at first,” says Song. “But 
he was so hard-working and he has such a strong will 
for someone his age. He, his parents and myself all 
have the same goal now.” 
That goal has made Chofi’s life anything but 
ordinary. In Korea’s Confucian-influenced society, 
where academic endeavour and success is a veritable 
litmus test of social worth, most youngsters spend 
hours a day studying in private educational insti- 
tutes, supplementing their regular studies. Yet Choi 
spends the bulk of his time on the court—about six 
hours a day, seven days a week.“Sometimes I find 
it difficult,” he says, “especially when I can’t hit 
the ball well, but aside from that that I just enjoy it 
and have fun.” 
National heroes 
Chot’s work ethic earned him an invitation to the 
1998 Orange Bowl, an international tournament in 
Miami, Florida. He took first prize from a field of 128 
of the world’s top 12-year-olds. While in Florida,he 
also aced Bollettieri’s tennis school evaluation test for 
the scholarship before signing a contract with IMG 
(International Management Group), which manages 
the careers of many of the world’s top athletes. 
When the news in Florida reached Korea, the 
young player and his family were deluged by inter- 
view requests from the media. The reaction to 
Choi’s early success, which would go largely unno- 
ticed in many other countries, comes as little surprise 
in Korea,where athletes who excel on the interna- 
tional stage are a source of intense admiration and 
pride. Los Angeles Dodger pitching ace Chan-ho 
Park and golfer Se-ri Pak, the 1998 Ladies’ Pro- 
fessional Gold Association (LPG A) Rookie of the 
Year, are nothing less than national heroes in 
Korea—exemplars of excellence, particularly in 
these morale-hungry times of economic crisis. 
While the future looks rosy for Choi, what of the 
chances of him breaking his wrist or caving in to the 
mounting psychological pressure?What then?T hese 
questions aren’t recognized by Choi and his parents. 
Instead, they voice their trust in Choi’s coach, 
Song, who refuses to consider anything except posi- 
tive outcomes. 
“I’m doing what I really want to do,” says Choi. 
“My coach says it’s better if I can play well, but that 
I shouldn’t have pressure on me, and my parents just 
tell me to do my best. . . . Since I was a little kid, I’ve 
never had any other dreams except being a tennis 
player and now I am so happy.” u

“They used to tell me sport was just for hooligans. 
L They deceived me.” Who did? “Everyone.” Jean- 
Jacques Diodan, from Cote d’Ivoire, is bitter. Any 
little thing reopens the wound, like the TV programme 
a few months ago which showed the opening of a school 
for street children sponsored by his compatriot Basile 
Boli. Boli was the defence pillar of Olympique Mar- 
seilles, a team which, in its glory days, gave France its first- 
ever European Champions Cup. His was a real success 
story. 
He and Jean-Jacques started out in exactly the same 
way. A few years apart, they played in the local teams 
that were all the rage in Abidjan in the 1970s and 
1980s. Boli was a great hulk, while Jean-Jacques was a 
slight figure who became a magician when he had the 
ball at his feet. 
Jean-Jacques became the darling of Abidjan’s poor 
suburb of Treichville, with his cunning dribbles, fierce vol- 
leys and brilliant opportunism. All the neighbourhood 
associations begged him to join their teams. To entice 
him, they offered him sweets or cakes, a few hundred CFA 
francs, an aboki (coffee with cream) or a garba (a dish of 
fried fish and manioc flour). 
The talent scouts of the big Abidjan clubs were also 
sniffing around for future champions. T hat was how Boli 
was discovered, along with others like Gadji Celi and 
Youssouf Fofana, the future star of Monaco. These lads 
were not obsessed with turning professional. They played 
because they liked to, because they loved being cheered by 
the Sunday crowds and sometimes being carried aloft as 
heroes. 
But it became so enjoyable in the end that they sacri- 
ficed everything for it, starting with their schoolwork.

school when he was 11, started playing truant and skipping 
Sporting stardom beckons 
to talented young athletes 
all over the world, but only 
very few reach the top. 
Jean-Jacques Diodan’s story is 
one of many 
classes,beginning with maths and English. His report 
card summed it all up—playing hookey, bad marks and 
lack of concentration. 
His father, a customs officer so proud of his son 
that he nicknamed him “the Pelé of Treichville”, was 
dumbstruck. He and the rest of the family knew that 
only the best school leaving certificate, not a football 
pitch, would ensure the boy’s future. 
‘If you want to become a Pelé, 
then go and be one’ 
There were rows, punishments and beatings, 
but to no avail. Jean-Jacques didn’t make a clear 
choice and so ended up losing on both counts. 
Sport is like a jealous woman who refuses to share 
her man.If Jean-Jacques refused to devote himself 
day and night to football, then he wouldn’t become 
a star and wouldn’t go off to Europe to earn millions. 
If he returned to school,he would just limp along. 
In the end, to everyone’s surprise, he got his 
leaving certificate but his marks were too poor for 
him to continue in public high school. The alterna- 
tive was private schooling. But his angry father 
refused to pay for that. “If you want to become a 
Pelé,then go and be one,” he said sarcastically. 
Eventually, a sympathetic elder sister who was a 
journalist agreed to come up with the money. So 
Jean-Jacques continued his studies, managed to 
pass his baccalaureate and even went on to earn a 
degree in sociology. 
But this meant nothing in a labour market over- 
loaded with graduates. Jobless, he lived off his family. 
His wife, with whom he had a baby, left him because 
he wasn’t earning any money. He dreamed of emi- 
grating to the United States—that he would be chosen 
from thousands of others as an eligible immigrant 
and then, in an immigration lottery, win the right to 
actually go there. He turned once more to his sister, to 
pay for him to learn a trade. 
The fame of the Pelé of Treichville never went 
beyond his neighbourhood, though he is convinced he 
had the talent to go further. He didn’t manage either 
to get a literature doctorate which, he is equally sure, 
would have opened the door to a fine career. 
Meanwhile Basile Boli is a millionaire and, at 30, 
Jean-Jacques Diodan is unemployed. u

rican, is a star player in the University of Hawaii 
NN Basketball team.He has already had lucrative 
offers from prestigious clubs in the National Bas- 
ketball Association (NBA) league. 
Not long ago, Carter was one of many poor 
young males looking for opportunities in Atlanta’s 
Jonesboro south suburb, known for its high crime 
rate. His life took a different turn after he joined the 
local “Midnight Basketball” (MBL) league where he 
spent three years. As a result, he is now in university 
and looking ahead to a bright future in the NBA 
league. MBL, which organizes basketball played 
between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m, has changed the 
lives of many young males like Carter who live in the 
poor neighbourhoods of Atlanta and might otherwise 
have drifted into crime. (See box.) 
The only difference between Midnight Basket- 
ball and normal basketball is that it is played at 
hours when young inner city males are most vul- 
nerable to the drug culture,crime and other nega- 
tive activity. In a nutshell, MBL takes the players off 
the street at night and places them in a playground 
area under organized and structured conditions. 
Emmanuel Hunt, Jr, President of Atlanta MBL, 
quoting police records, says that the programme has 
helped to bring down the crime rate in the inner city, 
which fell by 40 per cent in the last five years. 
Vi
 
Chapters 
in fifty cities 
The first Midnight Basketball League was started 
in 1986 in Glenarden, Maryland, and since then 
the idea has spread to major cities like Los Angeles, 
Atlanta,Miami,Cleveland and Detroit. Like NBA, 
MBL has its own organized structure. Today, it has 
50 chapters nationwide and about 10,000 youngsters 
play in MBL games across the country. The Com- 
missioner’s office is located in Chicago and there are 
regional offices which organize tournaments bet- 
ween local teams and between cities. Last year, 
according to National Association of MBL officials, 
about 200,000 spectators watched the matches per 
night nationwide and the television viewership 
crossed the 3.5 million mark. 
MBL players, selected normally on open tryouts 
in each city, are in the 17-25 age group and on 
average spend three to four years in the programme. 
They are distributed among different teams which 
Gary A. Sailes* 
play in a local league. Most participants in the 
MBL are African-Americans,members of the group 
that outnumbers other ethnic groups in the poor 
neighbourhoods of many U.S. cities. “Participa- 
tion in the league is open to all young males. We do 
not discriminate on racial or ethnic grounds in 
selecting the players,” says Tony Adams,an official 
at the Fountain City MBL of Columbus,Georgia. 
What makes an MBL match different from a 
normal basketball game? Before each event, the 
players have to attend a one-hour workshop which 
focuses on topics like job interview skills, financial 
management, AIDS/HIV awareness, drug and 
alcohol abuse prevention, conflict resolution and » 
A programme 
to combat crime 
TT Sentencing Project, a U.S Criminology Think Tank, 
reported in 1998 that the leading cause of death 
among African-American male youth between the ages 
of 17 and 25 is homicide and that one in six African-Ame- 
rican males will be arrested before they reach the age of 
19. lt is estimated that one in 22 African-American males 
will be killed hy a violent crime before reaching the age 
of 44 Moreover, as many as 42 per cent of incarcerated 
men in the United States are black males. It is estimated 
that bythe year 2000, approximately 50 per cent of black 
males between the ages of 17 and 30 will be either 
incarcerated or under penal supervision. Law enforcement 
officials and criminologists have established that the 
increased drug use, drug trafficking and disenchantment 
with the American educational and employment oppar- 
tunity structure hasled to the increased arrests ameng col- 
lege age African-American males. 
In an effort to address rising crime and related pro- 
blems among youths in Glenarden, Maryland the town 
manager, G Van Standifer, established the Midnight Bas- 
ketball League in 1986 His aim was ta provide an alter- 
native to youngsters who wander around their neigh- 
bourhood during the night and end up committing crimes. 
With the support of businesses, law enforcement officials, 
and political and community leaders, the first Midnight 
Basketball League programme was organized in the 
same year, The MBL says that programme was successful 
in redueing the incidence of reported crimes by almost 60 
per cent in Glenarden. Sandifer later created the format 
for other communities to develop MBL leagues in their 
area. Today, MBL chapters have been developed in over 
50 cities in the U.S and in Puerta Rico. Each chapterisa 
non-prafit,community-based organization that adheres 
to formal training, rules and regulations based on the ari- 
ginal successful programme. n

entrepreneurship. Anyone who does not attend 
these classes is not allowed on the basketball court. 
“Instructors encourage the participants to take up 
jobs and sometimes the local association helps them 
to find one,” says Hunt. 
There are eight to ten teams in each chapter with 
10-12 players in each team, and each team plays on an 
average three to four games per week duringa summer 
season. MBL players can stay in the league till they 
reach 25 years of age and some of those who retire 
come back to the system as instructors, coaches and 
volunteers. 
“The stress is on discipline, punctuality and beha- 
viour. Members are not allowed to enter the court if 
they come late for the class and if they misbehave 
during a game they are immediately sent out,” says 
Mark Gallagher, assistant sports supervisor at the 
Recreation and Arts Center in Waterloo, Iowa. 
Respecting the rules 
MBL players are not paid for their participation. 
The only incentive comes in the form of balls, shoes 
and T-shirts, making the event a totally non-com- 
mercial activity. Local government, nongovern- 
mental organizations and private companies Sponsor 
these events. 
What makes these youngsters follow strict rules 
and regulations inside the basketball court when they 
have difficulty in following the rules of the society? In 
his book TheViolent Social World of Black M en, socio- 
logist William Oliver argues that black males often 
break rules as a form of resistance to discrimination 
and disrespect in a white-dominated society. They 
channel themselves into the areas where they per- 
ceive opportunities exist, and sport, especially bas- 
ketball, is one of them.! 
For African-American youth basketball has 
become a subculture in its own right. Talented high 
school players are recruited by top colleges and 
are offered scholarships to study and also to play in 
the college team. The best college players then go on 
to play professional basketball in the NBA or in over- 
seas leagues. 
For these youngsters in poor neighbourhoods, 
MBL not only provides an opportunity to play the 
game but also contributes to their self-identity and 
self-assertion. Following the rules of the game 
enables them to gain respect from their peers,popu- 
larity and a reputation as fierce competitors. A 
player in an MBL league can lose his reputation in 
his locality if he is kicked out of the programme on 
disciplinary grounds. The message of MBL is 
simple. If you want an opportunity to play the 
game, you have to respect the rules. u

Richard Lapchik at the Center for the Study of Sport in

85 per cent of the National Basketball Association (NBA)

A black British footballer who commits the sin of 
missing a goal. Reprehensibly racist behaviour, say 
the pundits, but these are the isolated occurrences of 
a few rotten apples. A look past these extremists sup- 
posedly reveals an arena in UK society—the world of 
sport—where everyone has an equal opportunity to 
succeed .Barriers of colour and class cannot possibly 
be found on the track, it is argued, where the stop- 
watch is the ultimate judge. According to UK Athle- 
tics, the government body promoting track and field 
sports, 24 per cent of top athletes, meaning those 
who receive grants on the basis of performance, are of 
African or Caribbean origin,even though they com- 
pose just two per cent of the UK population.Indeed, 
blacks represent 48 per cent of these top athletes 
who are focusing on their training and not simulta- 
neously pursuing academics. 
As Robin Phillips of UK Athletics says, this high 
representation would generally be seen as a sign of 
social progress. Yet the rosy picture darkens with the 
question: why are so many blacks running? Perhaps 
because they don’t have the same chances of succee- 
ding in other areas, says Ben Carrington, a sociologist 
at the University of Brighton, widely respected in 
British academic circles for his research on racism in 
sport and who is now editing a book on the subject. 
This is not to suggest that blacks are genetically gifted 
for sport—a proposition Carrington vehemently rejects

(Hungary) in 1998.

as being both racist and scientifically unfounded. Ins- 
tead he points to the ways in which stereotypes seep 
into the lives of young blacks and reinforce the socio- 
economic reasons leading them to pursue athletics. 
At the age of 24, Julian Golding is one of Bri- 
tain’s hopefuls, becoming the Commonwealth 200- 
metre champion last year. From an early age on, 
Golding knew he was fast but didn’t dream of beco- 
ming a champion. He was raised to focus on edu- 
cation, not sport, as “the way out” of the working 
class life of his parents, Jamaican immigrants who 
arrived in the 1960s. 
Missing idols 
So Golding studied hard at school, filling his free 
time with tennis, track and trampoline activities. But 
at 16, his school director took him aside for a chat. 
“Why not pursue running as a career? You've got 
talent.” The same encouragement came from his 
physical education (PE) teacher. There was no 
mention of his academic opportunities. 
Golding began weighing his options. “I was a 
better tennis player than a sprinter,” he says, “but 
there was no-one to look up to. No black tennis 
idols. So I thought about trying to be the first” until 
his first visit to the local tennis club. “T he courts were 
packed but there wasn’t one black person. I didn’t feel 
comfortable. I started asking about the subscription 
and coaching fees,” says Golding, calculating the 
expense for his parents who had five kids to support. 
“I thought, ‘No way!” And walked out.” 
He started training at a local track, focusing on 
black idols, like Linford Christie, the 1992 Olympic

100-metre champion.“You’ve got to have a vision 
of success. Linford made it and he’s from the same 
neck of the woods in west London as me.” 
Golding’s experience is typical, says Carrington. 
Money, status and glamour “pull”’kids into sport. 
However,black kids,in particular,also experience 
the “push” of PE teachers, who may have good 
intentions but inadvertently reinforce stereotypes. 
“The (PE) teachers think that certain types of kids, 
namely black kids, are going to be better off in an 
athletics career,” says Carrington, “because they're 
never going to make it in the world of finance or 
medicine.” 
Carrington points to a full body of research in 
this area. One of the most recent surveys,conducted 
by Sid Hayes and John Sugden of the University of 
Brighton,involved about 35 PE teachers in an eth- 
nically mixed region of the Midlands. Over 80 per 
cent of the teachers reported the “feeling that black 
pupils tend to be advantaged in sport”, which most 
identified as athletics. Almost 75 per cent attri- 
buted their black students’ sport success to “phy- 
siological reasons”. 
Science and stereotypes 
Golding is not shocked by the teachers’ response. 
On the contrary, he has learned to accept as truth the 
same stereotypes of “black brawn”. As a teenager, 
Golding was falsely “taught that it is a ‘scientific 
fact’that black people in general are able to move their 
muscles faster than white people” because they have 
special muscle fibres. “Statistics seem to prove it,” he 
says. “When was the last time we saw a white sprinter 
compete in the finals of an Olympic game? Back in 
1980—almost 20 years ago.” 
Yet Golding is not fully convinced by this “muscle 
theory” and welcomes Carrington’s assertion that it 
bears no scientific grounding. When asked of any 
other biological explanations for black athletic suc- 
cess, Golding quietly mentions the “Black Body, a 
term that I hate” which refers to the stereotype of the 
black muscular muscular torso of men like Linford 
Christie. The emotional edge to his voice suggests that 
Goldings torn by a personal quandary. He has been 
taught that blacks are gifted in athletics—a stereotype 
reinforced by media images of black muscular men. 
Yet he also knows that “black brawn” is loaded with 
racist overtones suggesting “white intelligence”. 
So it is with visible relief that Golding listens as 
Carrington debunks these erroneous “biological 
explanations.” The sociologist traces their roots to 
the Eugenics movement of the 1920s and 30s, 
which originated in North America and later spread 
throughout Europe. The aim was to produce a 
genetically superior population,which is linked to 
the notion of a hierarchy of separate races in which 
blacks were placed on the bottom, says Carrington. 
To reinforce this ranking, anthropologists tried to 
define the model white and black male by measu- 
ring and comparing their various body parts—ear- 
lobes,noses, limb lengths and so on. “T hese studies 
were inherently racist and had very little scientific 
validation behind them,” says Carrington.

### 115604: Hidden hurdles of colour

The Eugenics movement disappeared after the 
Holocaust in World War II. However, Carrington 
finds some of the same “biological arguments” and 
ideological conceptions emerging today with genetic 
research. There is, for example, a misconception in 
some sectors of the public that scientists will prove 
racial differences. “Today we know that there are 
about 100,000 genes in the human body and yet less 
than ten of them are related to skin colour,” says Car- 
rington. “Obviously there are variations between 
groups,” but these differences are linked to geo- 
graphy. In short, as groups migrated around the 
world, people adapted to their physical surroun- 
dings and passed those changes on to their descen- 
dants. 
A gene for playing darts or snooker 
Still the idea persists that scientists will one day 
discover a gene which makes blacks run fast.“Then 
there must be a gene among white working-class Bri- 
tish males for throwing darts or playing snooker,” 
jokes Carrington. “It’s comic. No one would ever 
suggest that Canadians are somehow genetically 
inclined to playing ice hockey... Yet whenever you 
have black success, there is a genetic argument.” 
These arguments often serve to deny or reduce 
the dedication and intelligence of successful black 
athletes,says Carrington,particularly in the media. 
He does not suggest that sport commentators are 
inherently racist. But Carrington does see a ten- 
dency to treat black and white athletes differently. 
Commentators often focus on the black athlete’s 
natural ability, he says, while white athletes are also 
praised for their intelligent strategies and dedication. 
Golding points to a related dimension: the 
impact on young white athletes. “If I was a 16- 
year-old white student, wouldn’t dream of going 
into athletics,” he says. With the media zooming in 
on black powerhouses like Linford Christie, “I'd 
think that I didn’t have a hope to win.” 
“With blacks dominating the sport,” Golding 
senses a public “yearning for a new Roger Black”, 
the English (white) 400-metre runner who won a 
silver medal at the 1996 Olympics. This desire is not 
manifested in any overt forms of racism,says Gol- 
ding, but rather through “hidden agendas.” 
The “yearning for the Great White Hope” 
cannot be proven.But for Carrington, it is impor- 
tant to note the impact of the perception that it 
exists. He refers to a scenario which, he says, is 
taken very seriously by many black athletes. Imagine 
the following: four athletes—three black and one 
white—compete for three places on a team. The first 
two clock very fast times and take their places. The 
other two are close, but the white athlete is slightly 
slower. Who makes the team? 
“You have to be above and beyond everyone else, 
so that there isn’t any argument not to pick you,” 
says Carrington. “But that kind of skews the picture 
of black athletic success. People don’t see the ave- 
rage black athletes because they don’t make the 
teams. This in turn leads people to say, ‘See,there 
must be something special about them.” nu

As the great roar erupted, so did the bodies

recent events. The first modern Olympic Games 
were held in 1896 and the first footballWorld Cup 
in 1930.At the end of the 19th century, sport was 
a pastime reserved for the upper classes of rich 
countries, but between 1920 and 1940 the situation 
changed drastically. Sport was given more and more 
press and radio coverage, became very popular and 
was skilfully exploited by the authorities for politi- 
cal purposes. 
Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany were the 
first to make use of it. Exploited by the Nazis for 
propaganda purposes, the 1936 Olympic Games 
in Berlin marked the start of the modern era of 
sport as a spectacle. The Berlin games are still stu- 
died as an example of the way in which crowds can 
be lured and fascinated by spectacular events. They 
launched the tradition of grandiose and finely 
orchestrated sporting events which bring prestige to 
the organizing country. 
Hyping up 
the supporters 
But dictatorships have not been the only 
regimes to use sport to promote nationalism.Since 
the end of the Second World War, sporting events 
have helped countries win international promi- 
nence and build up national identity. Every new 
state creates its own national sports teams. During 
the annual sporting calendar, patriotic feelings are 
regularly called on to support a team or a cham- 
pion. Political and economic interests and the 
media can use the powerful symbol of sport to rally 
citizens,customers and spectators around a sense of 
national belonging. 
Sporting events help people that they belong 
to a community. To take part, you join one of the 
groups of spectators behind each of the two com- 
peting teams, and share the emotions of your fel- 
low supporters. During the match, your sense of 
identity is mobilized on behalf of your national, 
village or neighbourhood team, whichever the 
case may be.T his passionate feeling of together- 
ness and partisan commitment is the core of 
spectator sports. 
These big events bring together (tele)viewers 
who sometimes have only one thing in common— 
the desire to see a clash between two sides which will 
produce a single winner. Such is the hierarchical 
nature of sport. Getting together to see a sporting

beat them. The sense of community is based on 
rivalry and opposition to others. The main thing is 
that everyone is united against the other side. 
The us-against-them attitude is built up in all 
the talk and media hype that precede the event and 
attribute meanings to it. T his build-up is the crucial 
element in the process of bringing people together. 
It’s also the most unconscious one. The meaning of 
the event is defined by what is said before it takes 
place. A feeling of solidarity mounts as the big day 
approaches. 
The World Cup in France was built up in this 
way over two years. Oft-repeated slogans convinced 
people that this was “a chance for France”, without 
explaining why. Exhortations to back the national 
team found their way into all kinds of fields—in »

politics,sport, the media, advertising and even lite- 
rature. T he foundations of victory were laid as a 
sense of national awareness was created, gradually 
uniting in support of this particular cause French 
people who were in other respects divided. “Spon- 
taneous” outbursts of collective joy were prepared 
months before the competition began. The end- 
less hype created the event just as much as the 
event had created the hype. 
We are 
the champions! 
The scenes of popular jubilation showed how 
people identified themselves with the winners. By 
defeating Brazil, the French players beat the team 
considered the best in the world. By a mysterious 
alchemy, all the French and their supporters also 
became “the best”. “We are the champions .. . of 
the world,” they chanted. They had proved them- 
selves better than the best,i.e.the losers,who were 
only mentioned during the long night of celebration 
in terms of the humiliation inflicted on them. Again 
and again people raised one, two and then three 
fingers as they savoured the 3-0 score. The delight 
of one side was a counterpoint to the other’s grief. 
“We” were triumphant and all-powerful. “They” 
no longer existed,except as a foil. 
By pulling off such an historic feat,the French 
football team were able to rally behind them an all- 
inclusive France of “Blacks,Whites and Beurs”!. 
But this was a transient phenomenon which faded 
as the excitement died away. Other sporting events 
would bring people together in the same way. 
What’s more, this kind of seemingly inoffensive 
jubilation actually harbours tensions which become 
more acute when competition in sport provides a 
pretext for them. Sporting events can spark vio- 
lence which homes in on the “enemy” of a threate- 
ned or humiliated “us”.“They”’become the focus 
of collective hatred because of their commitment to 
the opposing side. 
The competition involved in sport generates 
and channels passions on the basis of winners and 
losers. For their own supporters, the players are the 
personification of all kinds of talents and qualities, 
including virility. The opposing team and their sup- 
porters are characterized as practitioners of all kinds 
of vices and taunted as “the weaker sex”. 
So the result of a sporting encounter goes hand 
in hand with a fantasy of male domination, and 
spectator sport symbolizes the endless struggle bet- 
ween groups of human beings, rather than their 
alleged fraternal instincts. It doesn’t take much for 
jubilation to degenerate into violence where “any- 
thing goes”. u

The British novelist Alan Sillitoe once wrote 
I that “sport is a means of keeping the national 
spirit alive during a time of so-called peace. It 
prepares the national spirit for the eventuality of 
war”. 
Some have argued otherwise, maintaining that 
sport can be invaluable in bridging gaps of international 
understanding. Certainly there can be little doubt 
that sport tends to bring together athletes of otherwise 
hostile nations or communities. During the Cold War, 
ice hockey players of the Soviet Union and the United 
States had a sincere affection for each other, despite 
their fierce rivalry on the rink. But does sport also bring 
together the communities to which the sportsmen 
belongor does it rather reinforce longstanding hosti- 
lities and rivalries? 
Whenever there is a cricket match* between India 
and Pakistan, for example, the fans on both sides find 
it difficult to separate national pride from an aesthetic 
appreciation of the game. For these two postcolonial 
cousins have fought three wars in the fifty years since 
they became free and neighbouring nations. At the pre- 
sent time they fight a shadow war over Kashmir, a ter- 
ritory claimed by both. How far, if at all, do these 
deep political hostilities spill over into the cricket field? 
Cricket, a game of British origin, has a passionate 
following in both countries. With the possible excep- 
tion of the cinema, cricket reaches out to more 
people than any other form of entertainment in 
the subcontinent. Every match played by the 
national team is followed by hundreds of millions of 
fans, and the players themselves have iconic status.

The spell of sport 
  
February 1995:Indian police order spectators 
out of Calcutta’s Eden Gardens ground after disruptions 
during a match between India and Pakistan. 
have played each other at cricket much less frequently 
than they have other countries. Between 1961 and 
1978 they did not play any matches at all. Between 
1978 and 1989 there were regular exchanges of cricket 
teams, with India and Pakistan each touring the other 
country three times. Since 1989 they have chosen to 
play against one another only on “neutral” territory— 
the Gulf emirate of Sharjah, Australia,even Canada. 
Finally, early this year a tour of India was planned by 
the Pakistan cricket team. 
The visit was bitterly opposed by the extremist 
right-wing politician Bal Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena 
party rules the city of Mumbai, generally considered 
the home of Indian cricket. Thackeray claimed it 
would be “unpatriotic” to allow Pakistan to play 
cricket on Indian soil while that country was spon- 
soring “terrorism” in Kashmir. T he Shiv Sena dug up 
the pitch at Delhi, where a Test match was to be 
played, and issued threats that they would physi- 
cally attack the Pakistani cricketers if they came. 
Despite this opposition, the tour went ahead. Test 
matches were played at Chennai in southern India 
and in Delhi, with tight security and massive crowds 
in attendance, and without any incident. Pakistan 
won in Chennai and India in Delhi. Then,however, 
the two teams moved on to Calcutta to play the first 
match of an Asian Test Championship (in which the 
third participating team is Sri Lanka). In a closely- 
fought contest, Pakistan won, but only after a 
controversial decision by the umpire had ruled 
against the brilliant Indian cricketer, Sachin Ten- 
dulkar. This led to an outpouring of protest from the 
crowd, the throwing of bottles onto the field and the 
suspension of play. The last stages of the match 
were played before an empty stadium. 
Great expectations 
On the field and off it, the cricketers of Pakistan 
and India are brought together by a shared lan- 
guage (Hindustani) and a shared regional culture. 
When they play for a World XI, the Indian and 
Pakistani cricketers room together. Among the fans, 
too, the genuine cricket lover appreciates fine bow- 
ling or batsmanship by the other side. Whenever 
Pakistan play England,or any other third country, 
Indian cricket lovers tend to support Pakistan. Thus 
when India were knocked out early in the 1992 
World Cup, and Pakistan went on to win, most 
Indians felt “at least the Cup came to Asia”. 
All the same, there is little doubt that when the two 
countries play against each other, sport is made to carry 
the baggage of patriotism.Proficiency at sport,espe- 
cially cricket, is made to stand in for failure in other 
spheres. India and Pakistan are both poor countries, 
but victory on the sporting field can, in the minds of 
the insecure patriot, make up for that. In the light of 
present trends, India and Pakistan have little hope of 
joining the league of the world’s prosperous nations. 
But they might again be world champions in cricket, 
as India was in 1983 and Pakistan was in 1992. At the 
individual level too, each country has produced some 
of the world’s finest cricketers. 
In both India and Pakistan, the cricketers themselves 
are made to bear the brunt of an intensified nationalism. 
When India won against Pakistan in the quarter finals 
of the 1996 World Cup, the defeated team went back 
home in fear. The home of their captain, Wasim Akram, 
was attacked by angry fans. Questions were asked in the 
Pakistani Parliament alleging that the loss was delibe- 
rate, that the players had been bribed to lose. The cric- 
keters had of course tried their best, but on the day the 
other team played better. 
These feelings are replicated amongst émigré 
communities too. For more than a decade now the 
Gulf emirate of Sharjah has hosted a cricket tour- 
nament in which both India and Pakistan participate. 
For the last three years the two countries have also 
annually played a series of five matches in Toronto. 
It has been well documented that patriotic feelings 
are often exaggerated among diasporic communities, 
who yearn for their homeland as they do not com - 
pletely assimilate in their country of residence. Cer- 
tainly the cricket fans in Sharjah and Toronto bear 
ample testimony to this. 
Sequel of Partition 
What are the roots of this nationalism? Hindu and 
Islamic chauvinists on either side, as well as some 
Western commentators, tend to represent the conflict 
in religious terms. I would stress that its roots are 
primarily territorial rather than religious. Although 
Pakistan is an Islamic state, India also has a substan- 
tial Muslim population.Indeed, some of India’s finest 
cricketers have been Muslims, including the present 
captain of the national team, Mohammed Azha- 
ruddin.T he genesis of conflict, on the cricket field or 
elsewhere, must be explained otherwise. 
On the Pakistan side, it is the fact that India is seen 
as the huge and sometimes overbearing Big Bro- 
ther of the region, a country that throws its weight 
around. On the Indian side, it is the memory that 
Pakistan originated in a movement for secession, 
that in the original vision of Indian nationalism both 
lands were to be part of one nation. Independence in 
August 1947 also meant Partition. Through cricket, 
therefore, the smaller nation of Pakistan can hope to 
challenge the political weight of India. Indian natio- 
nalists, for their part, have never completely recon- 
ciled themselves to the existence of Pakistan as a sepa- 
rate political entity. They thus tend to see in cricketing 
victory an affirmation of the illegitimacy of the 
demand for breaking up India. 
So should there be further cricketing contacts bet- 
ween India and Pakistan? Is cricket a means of taming 
national tensions, or is it rather a way of stoking the fires 
of aggressive nationalism? One cannot, alas,answer this 
question unambiguously either way. For sport unites but 
it also divides, and in this case cricket is made to carry 
the burden of national expectation. Inevitably, this 
becomes more intense when Pakistan and India play 
one another. A section of the fans cannot forget the poli- 
tical animosities, and take a mere game far more 
seriously than they should. u

“We owe 38 years of sporting achievement to the 
A unconditional backing Cuban sport has received 
from the revolutionary Government and especially 
from our commander-in-chief Fidel Castro,” says Hum- 
berto Rodriguez, President of the National Institute 
for Sport,Physical Education and Recreation of Cuba 
(INDER), founded in 1961.T he results speak for them- 
selves. With only 11 million inhabitants and despite 
severe economic crisis, Cuba came fifth in the Olympic 
medal rankings at Barcelona in 1992, and eighth at 
Atlanta in 1996. At the Pan-American level, it ranks 
second, after the United States. 
“Mass involvement in sport and highly efficient 
structures have made it possible for big stars to emerge,” 
says Norge Marrero, national commissioner for rowing. 
Cuba has 31,700 physical education instructors, one for 
every 458 inhabitants, compared with one teacher for 
every 42 persons, and one doctor for every 170. For 
1999, the budget for sport is 125 million Cuban pesos 
(the same figure in U.S. dollars at the official rate, 
although the semi-official rate is 20 to the dollar), which 
is equivalent to the budget for culture and science. 
“Sport is part of the people’s culture,” Marrero adds, 
“because people have learned that sport means quality 
of life and health.” 
Higher, stronger, faster . .. and more revolutionary. 
Outside the sports arena, a Cuban athlete may be 
treated as a prince or a villain, depending on an ima- 
ginary borderline traced by his own loyalty to the 
state. T he boxer Teofilo Stevenson, Olympic champion 
in 1972, 1976 and 1980, was admitted to the “revo- 
lutionary hall of fame” because he rejected lucrative 
professional contracts abroad. A different fate has 
lb 
— To 
awaited other eminent sportsmen and women, 
mostly baseball players, who, having opted for the 
temptations of professional status and for exile, 
have had their names struck off the official roster. 
Desertions are a thorn in the revolution’s side. 
But according to Rodriguez, Cuban sport “cannot 
ignore a century marked by globalization and neo-libe- 
ralism”. The champion of amateurism, it has been 
forced willy-nilly to wade into a sea of professionalism 
and excessive commercialization. After the collapse of 
its main partner and backer, the Soviet Union, Cuba 
has begun a process of cautious transformation,ope- 
ning the door to certain aspects of the market economy. 
As a consequence of the hard years of crisis (1989- 
1993), when gross domestic product (GDP) fell pre- 
cipitously by some 37 per cent, most of the island’s 
11,000 sports facilities suffered serious deterioration 
and even the nutritional system in its training centres 
was affected. In order to find a way out, Cuba has 
devised a complex system that enables it to obtain eco- 
nomic resources through Cubadeportes, an enter- 
prise set up in 1991 under the authority of INDER. 
Drumming up funds 
The chief function of Cubadeportes is to seek 
funding for Cuban sport. At present its main source 
of income, the amount of which is not publicly dis- 
closed, is provided by some 600 trainers who are 
spread over four continents. It has also introduced 
anew scheme whereby leading Cuban sports figures 
are prepared to take up temporary contracts in vol- 
leyball clubs in Italy, basketball clubs in Argentina 
and handball clubs in France and Hungary. 
First-class athletes are considered privileged com- 
pared with the run of the population. They can win 
prizes in dollars or in kind (cars and apartments) in 
exchange for a contribution to the state for its support 
in terms of training, board and lodging. There are no 
official figures for the income of sportsmen and 
women, but it is reckoned that a member of a national 
team is paid about 500 Cuban pesos a month ($25 at 
the semi-official rate), while the average monthly 
wage of a Cuban worker is about $11. 
Judging by the results achieved in international 
competitions, Cuban muscle serves the ideals of the 
revolution.Sport is a jewel that is proudly shown to 
the outside world and acts as an incentive within the 
country. In the words of Rodriguez, its challenge is 
“to enhance the role of the individual, by providing 
a better grasp of patriotic values and of national 
identity”. u

### 115608: New players, same game

New players, same game 
The USSR used its mighty, gold medal-winning sports machine 
Lincoln Allison” 
to help build patriotism. Now, the new republics of the former Soviet empire 
are trying the same trick. So far, to no avail 
The former Soviet Union today is a land of 
I overgrown pitches, broken goal posts and bent 
basketball hoops. The widespread decrepitude 
1s a dismal reminder that Soviet sport was an arti- 
ficial construction shaped to state purposes. 
Abandoning Soviet disdain for “bourgeois” 
sport, in the 1940s Stalin invested massively in a pro- 
gramme to develop athletic excellence. The overt 
reason, as with the space programme, was to 
demonstrate the capacities of the Soviet system to 
the rest of the world. In fact, the more important 
effect was probably in the “near abroad” of the 
fourteen non-Russian Soviet republics, where the 
regime encouraged people to be patriotic towards 
both their particular national culture and towards 
the much larger “Soviet Motherland”. 
In short,gold medals were used to bring cohe- 
sion to a disparate empire marked by ethnic and 
inter-regional tensions. 
Premier Olympic power 
The policy worked.Soviet sporting success in the 
Olympic Games was massive: the USSR headed the 
medals table in the summer games on seven out of 
eight occasions between 1952 and 1980. It is true 
that this success did not extend much beyond the 
Olympics: when it came to sports that existed pro- 
fessionally in the West the USSR either underper- 
formed (as in soccer) or failed to develop at all (as 
in golf). But the Olympics were able to sell them- 
selves as the world’s premier sporting event and the 
Soviet Union was able to sell itself as the world’s pre- 
mier Olympic power. 
When the political edifice collapsed so did its 
sports system. 
Now the new republics are once again flirting 
with the idea of investing in sport as a means of buil- 
ding a national identity. People in the Republic of 
Georgia, for example, have often been shocked to 
discover that Westerners know almost nothing about 
them. In their own minds their nation has been a 
cradle of European and Christian civilization, the 
place where wine,cultivated wheat and alphabetic 
writing all originated. T hat most people in the West 
associate “Georgia” with Atlanta rather than Tbilisi 
1s deeply depressing to Georgians. 
Eduard Shevardnadze, President of the Repu- 
blic of Georgia, once remarked that a single football 
match could highlight the existence of the Georgian 
nation as nothing else could. 
In this context, the qualifying competition for the 
1998 World Cup, in which Georgia was in the same 
group as England and Italy, was an important 
opportunity to put the country on the mental map 
of many people in the West. Visiting Tbilisi for the 
game, [ was impressed by the sense that Georgians 
had few aspirations to win or qualify, but were des- 
perate to put on a good show. 
But it seems the decline of sports in the former 
Soviet Union will be virtually impossible to reverse, 
and sports will not prove to be a tool for political 
purposes in the new republics. The reason is that 
identification with national teams cuts no ice in a 
context of economic collapse and ethnic hatred. 
When interviewing people recently in the Repu- 
blic of Georgia, I found that there was no grassroots 
sporting culture capable of keeping things going. 
Furthermore, the voluntary principle which sustains 
sport at grassroots level in the West was a concept 
that people did not even understand. 
The exceptions will be in highly commercial 
sports where there are still good coaches and large 
sums of money to be made in the new global labour 
market for successful players: football and tennis are, 
perhaps, the prime examples. There is, by local 
standards,enormous money to be made from the 
sale of local players to the West and by competing 
in European competitions. 
For now, in Georgia at least, it seems that the 
only real hope is that outsiders will come to the 
rescue. “We will have great athletes and coaches 
again,’ I was repeatedly told in my Georgian travels, 
“when the capitalists come and invest money in 
our sports facilities and training programmes.” H

All together! 
Sergio Leite Lopes® 
Being in a football stadium means you can 
sing, shout, jeer, swear and leap around— 
working off feelings you repress elsewhere. 
Even better, you're in a crowd 
It’s a modern phenomenon, which only deve- 
A loped at the end of the 1930s, when football, 
hitherto the reserve of a select group, became 
a mass sport. The game spread and grew in the 
1960s and 1970s and its fans got younger. The 
average football supporter today is aged between 15 
and 25.And for some time now, it hasn’t just been 
a specifically British phenomenon. Fanatical devo- 
tion to a team, and sometimes to a sporting hero, has 
steadily taken hold on all five continents. Suppor- 
ters’mania is now universal, with pretty much the 
same motives and forms everywhere, but it still 
springs from local roots. 
Different styles of football derive from distinc- 
tive body movements established in different cul- 
tures. The names given to supporters vary from 
place to place and sum up the way they behave. T he 
word “supporter”, used by the English and then the 
French, conveys the idea of force and backing 
behind a team. T he Brazilian forcedor screws up his 
face in worry as a match proceeds. The Italian fifosi 
suffers from fifo, an illness marked by fever and 
twitchiness. 
Initiation into this brotherhood can come very 
early, from the moment a father, an uncle, a brother 
or a godfather gives a newborn child the jersey of a

the appropriate satisfying

tensions generated by normal

favourite team.It can also happen later on,while a 
child is growing up. With neighbours and school- 
mates, he plays football in the street or with a team, 
listens to or watches match reports, discusses the 
game with friends and finally goes to the stadium 
himself. 
Once there, he—and more and more she—and 
an older relative will go and join the group of sup- 
porters who back the same team as they do. The rival 
fans face each other in the stands behind one of the 
goalmouths. The energy they generate, through 
new collective emotions and forms of expression, 
produces new identities of class, neighbourhood, 
region,religion and country. 
Untilnot so long ago, the layout of the stadiums 
3 4 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
helped all this along. Spectators packed into big open 
areas on the edge of the pitch, and terraces without 
numbered seats. Modern stadiums have become 
more comfortable, and security measures tend to 
put a damper on collective emotions. But although 
violence still persists, it is orchestrated,as the fans 
sing, chant slogans and shout witticisms or insults 
at the other side’s players and the referee. A spot of 
creative stage management and choreography turns 
it into a sort of carnival. 
The spectacle of the match enables the sup- 
porters to experience a moment when a society 
becomes aware of itself, when a coherent group 
expresses its identity through non-religious rituals. 
The fans are drawn to stadiums because both the 
match and the spectacle that goes with it have the- 
rapeutic and cathartic functions,which are vital in 
modern urban industrial society, where people are 
obliged to exercise great self-discipline and always 
hide their feelings. A sporting event provides an 
outlet because it teaches a person to develop a 
controlled expression of emotions which have to be 
curbed in other circumstances. 
“A society which doesn’t give its members, 
especially young people, sufficient opportunity to 
enjoy the excitement of a contest which can, but not 
necessarily, involve physical strength and bodily 
skills, isin danger of making their lives overly dull,” 
wrote the German sociologist Norbert Elias. “Such 
a society will not provide the appropriate satisfying 
compensation for the humdrum tensions generated 
by normal daily life.” [|

Till death do us part 
  
™ 
The trials and tribulations 
of a Colombian soccer fan 
In 1994 the President 
of Brazil ordered three 
days of national 
mourning after 
the death of racing 
driver Ayrton Senna. 
The best account of what it means to be a foot- 
I ball fan has been written by English writer 
Nick Hornby, who describes in his book Fever 
Pitch his relationship with Arsenal, the long-esta- 
blished London football club that plays in Englan- 
d’s Premier League. It’s like being married. But not 
like today’s marriages, which don’t last as long as 
courtship. No, this is a strict, spartan, Victorian, 
till-death-do-us-part kind of marriage. “A holy mar- 
riage,” says the Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra 
in his song “Like a bee in the honeycomb”. 
It’s also a marriage in which there’s no place for 
infidelity. In Colombia, a fan of Bogotd’s Santa Fe 
team is never going to have a two-week affair with 
Millonarios, the city’s other big team. At the outside 
he might have a furtive and fleeting platonic rela- 
tionship with teams from other cities, such as Depor- 
tivo Cali, Union Magdalena or Junior de Barran- 
quilla. But such innocent betrayals end abruptly on 
the day when these teams play Santa Fe. 
The fan behaves like an exemplary husband. 
Heis tender and true. He accepts his team’s defects 
just as a husband accepts that his wife is not as slim 
as she was the day he fell in love with her, or that she 
snores, has dark circles under her eyes, or pulls a 
long face for 18 hours of the day. There may be 
short-lived outbursts of fury when the team plays 
badly. (Santa Fe have gone twenty years without 
winning a title.) Except for his angry comments on

against Romania. 
  
‘Olé oléola/l love you more 
and more each day’ 
players who are slow on the turn or incapable of 
defending the team’s colours. The fan always ends 
up in the stadium, always accompanies his team 
through thick and thin and always cheers them on 
with the refrain: “OI¢ oléold/I love you more and 
more each day.” 
Spine-tingling 
sensations 
And just as the husband pays all the household 
bills without flinching even though he may think 
they're outrageously high, the fan squanders his 
wealth on the team. And how! In the past he just 
had to pay for tickets. Not any more. Now he also 
has to put his hand in his pocket to buy his team’s 
T-shirt (its design and manufacturer change every 
six months or so but he has to have the latest one), 
its scarf, banner, the official record of the suppor- 
ters’songs. 
And what does he get in return? A lot of intan- 
gibles that only the true fan can really appreciate. A 
sense of tribal belonging that’s like no other expe- 
rience in the world, whether it’s an electoral vic- 
tory, arock concert with a 100,000-strong audience 
or a military victory. That tingling in the spine whe- 
never your team scores a goal or wins a match 
against its time-honoured enemy gives way to an 
indescribable sensation that can last for days, if not 
years. In 1992 Santa Fe beat Millonarios 7 : 3.Even 
today it’s an unforgettable memory for the suppor- 
ters of the reds and they rub it in whenever they 
meet fans of the blues. 
It’s a reason for clinging on to life:I can’t ima- 
gine dying without knowing which team is going 
to win this year’s championship or how many goals 
we're going to beat Millonarios by the next time 
we play them. It doesn’t matter whether you've cho- 
sen the right team (Atletico de Bilbao or Real Socie- 
dad, Boca Juniors or River Plate, Inter or AC Milan, 
Arsenal or Tottenham Hotspur), your football team 
is neither more nor less than the love of your life.

### 115611: May the betting man win...

May the betting man win... 
Robert Horn and Thaskina Khaikaew* 
Thai boxing fans 
are hooked on gambling 
as much as the niceties of 
their favourite sport 
For the past 20 years, Sialek Chanarak, a 53-year- 
old shop-owner, has spent nearly every Friday 
night at Bangkok’s Lumpini Stadium, one of 
Thailand’s two top arenas for Muay Thai, or Thai 
kickboxing. “I don’t like boxing,” Sialek insists as he 
leafs through a wad of baht, T hailand’s currency. “I 
come to gamble. If there was no gambling here, I 
would never come.” Sialek is not alone. Of the 10,000 
people who jam into the ramshackle stadium, nearly 
all are betting on the battles in the ring. “Only the tou- 
rists don’t bet,” Sialek says, pointing to the ringside 
seats occupied by Japanese and European visitors. 
Many of the foreign women are cringing as the 
boxers pummel each other, digging knees into their 
opponents groins and launching rapid-fire kicks 
cracking against skin and bone. 
Muay ThaiisThailand’s national sport. A martial 
competition developed from the hand-to-hand combat 
techniques of ancient Siamese soldiers, it seems similar 
at first to international boxing. Fighters wear gloves for 
three-minute rounds held in boxingrings. After that, 
the similarities end. Kicking, kneeing and elbowing 
your opponent are all legal, as is pushing and throwing 
him to the canvas. T hen there is the music: a three- 
piece band comprised of drums, cymbals and the 
java pipe plays frenetic, ancient T hai battle music to 
urge the fighters on. 
A fatal 
attraction 
MuayThai has been deemed so integral a part of 
Thai character that the National Culture Commis- 
sion oversees its promotion. The Ministry of Edu- 
cation runs a Muay Thai Institute to teach the intri- 
cacies of the sport. And the army runs Lumpini 
Stadium and the World Muay Thai Council, the 
sport’s governing body. But Muay Thai pales in 
popularity beside another national pastime: gam- 
bling. Simply put, Thais love to bet. Police have esti- 
mated that billions of baht are wagered by Thais 
each week on English Premier League Football 
alone.Underground casinos operate with impunity 
in Bangkok. And the country’s most famous Buddhist 
monk attracts thousands of devotees who believe 
that if he whacks them on the head with a rolled up 
newspaper, they might win the national lottery. 
Still, millions of Thai boys and young men have 
a passion for Muay Thai.Like boxing anywhere,it 
provides a flickering hope they can fight their way 
out of poverty. A major match at Lumpini can earn 
100,000 baht, or about $2,500, with boxers fighting 
3 6 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
on average once a month. A purse that size is a 
fortune to the young farmers and factory hands 
dreaming of kicking their way out of hardscrabble 
fields or the squalor of Bangkok’s slums. But it’s 
nothing compared to the money changing hands in 
the stands at Lumpini and other stadiums. 
“I’ve won as much as 800,000 baht (over $20,000) 
on one fight. But I also once lost a million ($27,000), 
says Chatri Kanchanamanoon, the 50-year-old owner 
of a gold shop. But Chatri’s losses are relatively mild 
compared to that of his best friend. “He bet a huge sum 
of money and he got too excited,” says Chatri. “He was 
cheering his fighter and suddenly fell on the floor. He 
had a heart attack and died.” 
Most bets these days,however,aren’t as heart-stop- 
pingly large since the country’s economy crashed in 
July 1997. And the gambling fatalities are not all from 
natural causes. Chatri says that some gamblers who 
couldn’t pay their debts have been killed. 
As the fighters knee and elbow each other, 
screaming fans stand atop wooden benches or surge 
against the green chain link fences that separate the 
different ticket sections. It’s in between rounds, 
though, that the action really heats up. While the 
boxers catch their breath, the gamblers wave their 
arms and wiggle their fingers in an intricate system 
of signals that lets the bookies know how much 
they want to bet on which fighter at what odds. 
There is a slim minority of fans like Paisan Phak- 
deesunthorn, who abstain from betting. “I like Muay 
Thai,” says the 32-year-old civil servant, adding that 
he used to fight as a teenager. “I don’t have money to 
waste,” he says, on the “bad habit” of betting. Paisan 
cheers on the boxers, but like so many other fans,he 
doesn’t have a favourite fighter. Paisan seems too 
wrapped up in the sport to focus solely on the career 
of a single boxer. Gamblers like Sialek agree.“ You can’t 
have a favourite. . . . That would only interfere,” he says. 
“You have to bet with your head, not your heart.” |

### 115612: No farewell to arms

No farewell 
{0 arms 
Vinceng Hsas* 
The great powers might have cut down on military expenditure, but low- and 
middle-income countries have boosted their spending. In Asian countries 
alone, arms purchases have doubled in four years. 
0 = —

Tanks ready for the scrapyard at Rockensussra,Germany. 
Judging purely by the figures, the 
“disarmament race” which began 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 
1989 appears to have yielded some tan- 
gible results. Political détente between the 
major powers led not only to the conclu- 
sion of agreements for the withdrawal and 
destruction of weapons, but also to a 
reduction of military expenditure in many 
countries. 
However, careful scrutiny of the 
figures reveals a more complex and para- 
doxical picture. It shows that a decade 
after the “disarmament” process began 
there are conflicting trends, some of 
which provide few grounds for optimism. 
The reduction effort has not been the 
same everywhere.What is more alarming, 
many countries and entire regions have 
begun to rearm. 
World military expenditure has fallen 
by about one-third since 1988. In 1997 it 
  
was running at $740 billion (equivalent to 
roughly $2 billion a day, or 2.6 per cent of 
global GDP, compared with $3 billion a 
day at the end of the 1980s). 
Contrasting 
trends 
The first point to note, however, is 
that this reduction is due basically to cuts 
made in Europe and in the United States. 
And while Europe heads the list with a 
drop of over 50 per cent in the last deca- 
de (see table), this spectacular decrease is 
chiefly due to the reduction which began 
in Russia in 1992. In Western Europe, the 
reduction in military spending has been 
far more modest, around 14 per cent. 
The second point is that while the 
high-income countries have reduced the 
size of their military systems and the cor- 
responding expenditure, the low- and 
middle-income countries have increased 
military spending by 19 per cent and 12 
per cent respectively. Notable examples in 
the low-income group include South Asian 
countries, China and some African coun- 
tries, and in the middle-income group 
such Mediterranean countries as Algeria, 
Lebanon,Syria and Turkey. Growing mili- 
tary budgets not only eat into spending on 
human development, but also heighten the 
risk that arms will be used to deal with 
political crises. 
Asia is the continent where the growth in 
military expenditure has been strongest. 
India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Indo- 
nesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singa- 
pore, Taiwan, T hailand and South Korea 
have all increased their bud gets significantly 
in recent years, although as a rule by a

lesser percentage than the rise in their GDP. 
A substantial part of the increase has gone 
into buying new weapons—expenditure on 
arms purchases doubled between 1994 and 
1997.This trend may be expected to slow 
down in the next few years,however, for two 
reasons—the financial crisis that has affected 
many of the region’s economies and pres- 
sure from the International Monetary Fund 
for these countries to reduce government 
expenditure,including military spending. 
Latin America has not escaped the 
temptation to rearm.Military expenditure 
in South America rose by 14 per cent over 
the last decade, notably in Brazil, Chile 
and Paraguay. In the last few years purcha- 
sing of new weapons, some extremely 
expensive, has also increased. Central Ame- 
rica, which for decades was one of the 
regions worst ravaged by armed conflicts, 
constitutes an exception. In the last decade, 
it has actually reduced its military expen- 
diture by almost 40 per cent following the 
conclusion of peace agreements. 
In the Middle East, a traditionally lucra- 
tive market for arms exporters, military 
spending has also followed an upward trend, 
especially in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria. 
In Africa, on the other hand, only Algeria 
and Uganda have increased their military 
budgets, and sub-Saharan Africa as a whole 
has reduced military expenditure by no less 
ETHICS 
than 46 per cent. But the civil wars and 
cruel massacres that have occurred throu- 
ghout the decade prove once again that the 
brutality of conflicts and the numbers of vic- 
tims they claim are not necessarily linked to 
the acquisition of sophisticated, costly wea- 
ponry. The proliferation of light weapons, 
easily acquired and inexpensive (500 million 
units worldwide) is not sufficiently reflected 
in the statistics of military expenditure. It is 
enough to point out that 200,000 assault 
rifles can be had at discount prices for the 
cost of a single fighter plane. 
Smaller armies, 
new equipment 
Variations in military expenditure can 
be explained by two major parameters: 
the size of armies and the type and quan- 
tity of armaments they acquire. Among 
the major powers a third factor comes 
into play, namely the cost of research and 
development in the military sector. 
According to the U.S. Arms Control 
and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the 
numbers of military personnel in the 
world’s armies fell by some six million 
between 1988 and 1995 (to 22.8 million 
in 1995),a drop of 20 per cent. This helps 
to explain the aggregate reduction in mili- 
tary expenditure. There are major diffe- 
rences between regions, however. The

developed countries cut their armed 
forces by more than 35 per cent,the deve- 
loping countries by only 10 per cent on 
average. The percentage reductions in 
numbers in Central America (60 per 
cent), Eastern Europe (44 per cent), 
North America (25 per cent) and Western 
Europe (17 per cent) bear a clear relation 
to cuts in military budgets. This is not the 
An international code of conduct 
There seems little doubt that the coun- 
A tries producing and selling arms have 
not resisted the temptation to offset the fall 
in demand for military equipment from 
the industrialized countries with exports 
to the Third World, which is nowadays the 
scene of most conflicts. In 1997, imports of 
conventional weapons by developing coun- 
tries came to almost $19 billion. And bet- 
ween 1993 and 1997 the five permanent 
member states of the United Nations Secu- 
rity Council together accounted for more 
than 80 per cent of arms transfers, accor- 
ding to SIPRI (Stockholm International 
Peace Research Institute). 
In 1997, in an effort to reverse this 
trend, a Committee of Nobel Peace Prize 
Winners, on the initiative of Oscar Arias, 
former President of Costa Rica and winner 
of the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize,drafted an 
International Code of Conduct on Arms 
Transfers, which it will submit to the United 
Nations General Assembly in the hope that 
it will be adopted as a binding international 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
treaty. “Our children urgently need schools 
and health centres, not machine guns and 
fighter planes,” the Committee declared. In 
fact, the figure for arms imports by developing 
countries in 1997 was three times more than 
the extra investment needed to provide basic 
education for all those countries’ children, 
and one and half times more than what it 
would have cost to provide the whole popu- 
lation with basic health services and ade- 
quate food. Considering that more than half 
the countries spend more on defence than on 
health,Article 10 of the International Code 
stipulates that “Arms transfers may be 
conducted only if the recipient state’s expen- 
ditures on health and education combined 
exceed its military expenditures”. 
The states usually justify high military 
spending on the ground of its deterrent 
effect, and hence as a means of guaran- 
teeing the security of their citizens. Accor- 
ding to the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), however, the pro- 
bability in developing countries of dying 
from social neglect is 33 times greater than 
that of being killed in a war resulting from 
external aggression. 
The International Code stipulates that 
any country that wishes to acquire arma- 
ments must meet certain requirements, 
including the promotion of democracy, the 
protection of human rights and the trans- 
parency of military expenditure. According 
to the Committee, international arms trans- 
fers “foster political instability and human 
rights violations,prolong violent conflicts, 
and weaken diplomatic efforts to resolve 
differences peacefully”. 
Similar codes of conduct either already 
exist or have been proposed within the Orga- 
nization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe, the European Union, the United 
States and South Africa. These mechanisms 
urgently need to be applied at international 
level, considering that conventional wea- 
pons, and light weapons in particular, 
continue to cause 90 per cent of the casual- 
ties in today’s armed conflicts. u

case, however, in regions such as the 
Middle East, which have offset decreased 
numbers with the modernization of their 
armies and purchases of equipment. 
Numbers of military personnel increased 
slightly in Latin America and South Asia. 
Since 1990, military expenditure on 
defence equipment has fallen by a quar- 
ter. In the countries of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO), expenditu- 
re on equipment fell by one-third between 
1988 and 1997, when it amounted to $95 
billion. These figures stand in contrast to 
the sales of the hundred leading arms-pro- 
ducing companies which, according to 
SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace 
Research Institute) data, reached the sub- 
stantial figure of $156 billion in 1996. 
Thirty-nine of the companies, half of 
them American, clocked up annual mili- 
tary sales in excess of one billion dollars. 
SIPRI estimates research and deve- 
lopment expenditure at $58 billion in 
1995, of which $48 billion were accoun- 
ted for by NATO countries ($37 billion 
by the United States alone). Since 1989, 
this type of expenditure has fallen in most 
countries. Three noteworthy exceptions 
are Japan, India and South Korea, all 
three of which have increased their overall 
military spending, in absolute terms, in 
the last decade. 
Expenditure on research, which chiefly 
concerns the nuclear powers, accounts for 
14 per cent of total military spending in 
the United States, 11 per cent in France, 9.5 
per cent in the United Kingdom, 5 per cent 
in Russia and around 4 per cent in China. 
It accounts for 10 per cent of Sweden’s 
military expenditure and more than 5 per 
cent of that of India, Germany and South 
Africa. All these countries,plus Spain and 
Japan, account for more than 90 per cent of 
world expenditure on armaments research. 
What happened 
to the peace dividend? 
When the process of reducing military 
expenditure began, the idea was for disar- 
mament to serve development and for a 
“peace dividend” to be created with the 
savings that would accrue. What was the 
outcome of that commendable initiative? 
According to a United Nations Develop- 
ment Programme (UNDP) report, the total 
“peace dividend” worldwide exceeded $900 
billion by the mid-1990s, but “Most of the 
savings appear to have been committed to 
budget deficit reductions and non-deve- 
lopment expenditures”. 
The figures presented above also indi- 
cate that the “peace dividend” is far from 
being a universal phenomenon. Unfortu- 
nately it is the countries most in need of 
resources for their development that spend 
most on military activities, often more than 
they spend on health or education (see 
box). 
It is significant that the latest indicator 
used by the Bonn International Center 
for Conversion (BICC) to measure the 
disarmament effort of a list of 157 coun- 
tries shows up negative for 69 of them. 
This gives a clear idea of the enormous 
effort that is still required. nu

A legal weapon 
against firearms 
T growing number of lawsuits being 
brought by Americans seeking damages 
from commercial firms has become an effective 
way to promote causes on which members of 
Congress may be reluctant to legislate, because 
they are often dependent on these companies 
for election campaign funds 
A New York federal court jury recently set a 
precedent by ordering gun manufacturers to 
pay $4 million to someone accidentally wounded 
in a 1995 shooting incident. The decision, on 11 
February 1999,marked the first time that Colt, 
Beretta and other arms makers were deemed 
guilty of “negligence” for having flooded New 
York shops with “dangerous products”. The 
firms have appealed but many other suits 
against them are under way, some by city 
governments. 
The gun manufacturers, backed by the 
powerful National Rifle Association, a pressure 
group of firearm owners that claims three mil- 
lion members, have fiercely opposed all legal 
efforts to restrict the ownership and sale of 
guns. Yet crime figures remain spectacularly 
high in the United States. The number of mur- 
ders fell from 24,700 in 1991 to 18,200 in 
1997, but it is still by far the highest of all the 
industrial countries. 
The only anti-gun law of recent years was 
passed after an epic congressional battle. It 
requires anyone buying a gun to wait five wor- 
king days so the seller can check if the buyer has 
a criminal record. 
Suing for damages has already proved an 
effective weapon in the U.S Consumer groups 
have used it successfully as have victims of 
asbestosis and the harmful effects of tobacco. 
The method is spreading to other countries.

brought civil suits against big U.S tobacco com- 
panies in the hope of getting compensation for 
the money they have spent to treat people suf- 
fering from smoking-related illnesses u

Alexandria, from 
 
  


### 115613: Alexandria, from papyrus to the Internet

The Library of Alexandria was Antiquity’s most prestigious centre of learning. 
Its rebirth may bring a new beacon of knowledge to the Arab world 
In the centre of Alexandria, between 
the eastern port and the university, a 
thousand labourers are working night 
and day on a huge construction site with 
four big cranes. The cylindrical 11-storey 
building being built there in the middle of 
a lake has been designed by a firm of Nor- 
wegian architects, Snghetta, which won an 
international competition in 1989 that 
drew 1,400 entries from 77 countries. Its 
circular shape is meant to conjure up, 
against the backcloth of the Mediterranean, 
the image of “a lighthouse of knowledge 
re-emerging in a perpetual sunrise”, in the 
words of the project’s director-general, 
Prof. Mohsen Zahran. 
The building, which should be finished 
by autumn 1999, will revive the legendary 
Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA).Its promo- 
ters hope that, with the help of the best 
modern technology, it will spread the intel- 
lectual influence of Alexandria throughout 
the Arab world and beyond much more 
effectively than its predecessor did at the 
time of Caesar and Cleopatra. 
The 36,770-square-metre library will 
seat 2,000 people and have up to eight mil- 
lion books, periodicals,manuscripts,micro- 
40 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
films and CD-ROMs. Its computerized 
catalogue, which France is helping to build, 
will be one of the most advanced in the 
world and available in Arabic, English and 
French. Its planetarium, its International 
School of Information Studies and its 
museums of archaeology, calligraphy and 
science are expected to attract students, 
scholars and visitors from all over the world. 
Books 
for a wide public 
The idea of reviving the library was 
born in 1974, when Cambridge-educated 
Mostafa el-Abbadi, a history professor and 
author of a study on the “Life and Fate of 
the Ancient Library of Alexandria” drea- 
med of resuscitating the “temple of lear- 
ning” he had spent so many years studying. 
The president of Alexandria University, Dr 
Lutfi Dowidar, backed him and together 
they won the support of the Egyptian 
government and UNESCO, which funded a 
feasibility study and an Internet website 
(www.bibalex.gov.eg). 
El-Abbadi is fairly happy with the way 
things have turned out, though he would 
prefer the BA to be just a place for scholars. 
It will open its doors to a far wider public, 
however. “We don’t want books without 
readers,” says the writer Gamal el-Ghatani, 
editor of Akhbar al-Adab, the weekly lite- 
rary supplement of the big Cairo daily 
newspaper Al-Akhbar. “Unlike my son, I 
don’t know how to use a computer,” he 
confesses. “The Alexandria Library is being 
built for his generation, not mine, but the 
public will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed 
going to the old national library.” 
At the entrance to the building site 
stands a slab of Aswan granite bearing an 
Egyptian hieroglyph, a Chinese ideogram, 
an Arabic letter and a Greek “e”. The mes- 
sage of the granite blocks which make up 
the outer walls of the building is clear: the 
library aims to be a crossroads of alphabets, 
words and languages, like the city where it is 
located. Archaeological digs at the site—a 
former university car park where work began 
in May 1995, seven years after Egyptian Pre- 
sident Hosni Mubarak and UNEsco Direc- 
tor-General Federico Mayor laid the foun- 
dation stone—have shown that it used to be 
part of the royal neighbourhood. But no one 
knows exactly where the old library stood or 
what it looked like.

have been collected so far, a third of them 
donated. 
A catapult 
for development 
Former UNEsSco Director-General 
Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow launched a 
world-wide appeal in 1987 for the library’s 
revival, saying it would transform the cul- 
tural scene in the Middle East and the 
countries of the Maghreb. The UNESCO fea- 
sibility study stressed this key role it could 
play in the Mediterranean area. 
This mission will probably be accompli- 
shed, reckons project director Prof. Zahran, 
who isa U.S.-trained Egyptian architect. The 
BA could become “a catapult for the eco- 
nomic and social development of Egypt,” he 
says. “A country can have great wealth, but 
if it has no culture, it soon falls apart.” He 
predicts that the BA willbecome “a brid ge of 
understanding and interaction between East 
and West. Its revival will benefit humanity. 
But we mustn’t think that the child will be a 
prodigy from the moment of its birth. We'll 
have to wait several decades before we can 
see itsreal influence.” 
El-Ghatanialso hopes it will be a bridge 
between Egypt and Europe, a continent he 
sees as close because it shares the culture 
and especially the religions of the Mediter- 
ranean basin. “The roots of Europe’s 
Alexandria 
     
    
religions are right here,” he says. The 
Alexandrian writer Edwar al-Kharrat 
would like to see Alexandria become “the 
capital of collective memory and a haven 
for literary figures and scientists.” 
More concretely, the BA will enable 
Egypt’s young people—half the country’s 
population is under 20—to step up the pace 
of their studies. According to Zahran, Egyp-

lars to compare the manuscripts in Egypt 
with the copies that are being donated by 
foreign benefactors. An example is the 
manuscripts in the Escurial Palace in 
Spain, which are a crucial part of Arab heri- 
tage and copies of which have been made 
Alexandria will become ‘the capital of collective memory 
and a haven for literary figures and scientists’ 
tian students sometimes take four years to 
finish a doctorate—twice as long as stu- 
dents in the West—because research mate- 
rial is hard to come by. 
The first beneficiaries of the BA will be 
the 80,000 or so students at Alexandria 
University, whose library only has 250,000 
works (Egypt’s national library has 1.5 mil- 
lion).Scholars from all over the Arab world 
could come to Alexandria instead of or 
before going to the United States or Bri- 
tain. If the BA continues to attract the 
attention of foreigners in this way, it will 
play an important role. 
By bringing back documents that were 
scattered through Western countries in the 
19th century, the library will enable scho- 
    
Alexandria, founded by Alexander the 
% Great, had a lighthouse that was one of 
the seven wonders of the world. It was also 
the site, from about the third century BC, 
of the most famous library of ancient times. 
Greek thinkers such as Euclid, Ptolemy 
and Dionysius Thrax, respectively the 
“inventors” of geometry, map-making and 
grammar, worked there. T here too 72 rabbis 
translated from Hebrew into Greek the wri- 
tings that would come to be known, at least 
by Christians,as the Old Testament. 
The library also arranged for passing 
ships to be hijacked and relieved of any 
manuscripts they happened to be carrying. 
Its avowed aim was to own all the books in 
the world. It kept the originals and gave 
copies of them back to their owners. The 
library ended up with between 500,000 
and 700,000 manuscripts, mainly rolls of 
papyrus,that were stored in attics after the 
mysterious disappearance 
for the new library. The BA could also 
acquire more recent works which have been 
taken out of the Arab world. The superb 
lithographed books published in Fez, in 
Morocco, in the 1920s can up to now only 
be consulted at Harvard University, in the 
U.S. for example. 
Support from 
international donors 
The BA is due to be officially opened at 
the end of this year by President Mubarak, 
who will be running for a fourth term of 
office in October. Will his opponents criti- 
cize him for spending so much money on a 
fancy library when half the country’s adult 
population cannot read or write? Egypt is 
most valuable of them had been rolled up in 
linen or leather. For about 600 years, they 
were kept in a “museum” (in its original 
meaning of “temple of the muses”) in the 
royal neighbourhood which was the home 
ofthe seventh, last and most famous of the 
Cleopatras. 
It was long thought that this Cleopatra’s 
first husband, Julius Caesar, whose troops 
burned down part of Alexandria in about 48 
BC, was responsible for the library’s demise. 
But historians today have other theories. The 
library may have disappeared in the third 
century AD during fighting between 
Zenobia,queen of Palmyra,and the forces 
of Emperor Aurelian. Or perhaps in the 
fourth century, when Christians destroyed 
“pagan” writings. Or maybe in the seventh 
century, when an Arab general occupied 
the city and ordered documents to be 
burned to heat up the public baths. u

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
 
The new library is set to open its doors before the year 2000. 
forking out almost two-thirds of the $172 
million cost of the building itself. Proceeds 
from an international funding appeal, to 
which Arab countries have already generously 
contributed, will foot the rest of the bill. 
Paradoxes 
of the Arab world 
“Of course it’s expensive,” says El Gha- 
tani,“but a library isn’t some kind of festi- 
val that ends after three days. It would have 
cost even more if we’d waited another 30 
years to build it.” Its worth should be seen 
in terms of culture, not cash, and this, he 
believes,draws attention to one of the para- 
doxes of the Arab world. “The richest 
culture is in the poorest countries—I’'m 
thinking of Yemen—and the richest states 
have the least interesting cultural material. 
The rulers of the rich states have built 
palaces in Lausanne and Geneva instead 
of libraries. But the age of the oil dollar is 
coming to an end. We have to return to 
more basic values,” he says. 
Might the BA encourage democracy— 
a concept that originated in Greece—in 
Egypt and the rest of the region? “To build 
a democratic state,” says archaeologist 
Ahmed Ahdel Fattah, director-general of 
the Greco-Roman museum in Alexandria, 
“we need the tools of democracy, and 
knowledge is one of them. Democracy isn’t 
in such bad shape in Egypt, compared with 
some of its neighbours. This of course 
doesn’t stop us saying that we don’t have 
enough. Thank God I was born in Egypt. I 
couldn’t publish my writings in a lot of 
other Arab countries. u 
The world’s great 
libraries 
Libraries are usually compared on the 
I basis of how many printed volumes they 
contain. But this can be deceptive because 
countries have their own definitions of what 
a volume is. Moscow’s state library, for 
example, counts asa “volume” any publica- 
tion longer than two pages, including maga- 
zines—which produces a total of 30 million 
“volumes”, the same number as in the St 
Petersburg library. On the other hand, in 
France a “volume” must contain more than 
50 pages and may not be a periodical. 
The U.S.Library of Congress,founded 
in Washington in 1800, is considered the 
biggest in the world, with 29 million 
volumes. China’s national library in Bei- 
jing claims 16 million.These two are fol- 
lowed by a group of five, with stocks esti- 
mated at between 10 and 13 million 
42 The Unesco Courier -April 1999 
volumes each. Among them are Harvard 
University Library, in the U.S., the New 
York Public Library, and the library in 
Frankfurt, Germany, which opened in 1994. 
The British Library in London has 
nearly 12 million volumes. This is about 
the same number as the French State 
Library, which opened in Paris in 1996, 
includes the contents of the old Biblio- 
theque Nationale (National Library), and is 
also known as the “Tres Grande Biblio- 
theque”(the “Very Big Library”). 
The library in Alexandria,Egypt,even- 
tually scheduled to contain eight million 
works, will then rank after France’s state 
library and be in the same group as the libra- 
ries in Berlin, Berkeley (California) and the 
Romanian Academy in Bucharest. u 
  
African films 
In search 
of an audience 
WwW hat can be done to ensure that African- 
made films are seen by Africans? 
Attempts to tackle this problem were made at 
workshops organized at this year's Panafrican 
Film and Television Festival (Fespaco) held in 
Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) from 27 February 
to 6 March. 
A solution is needed urgently, for Africa is 
rapidly becoming a dustbin for cheap American 
movies, kung fu films, Hindu melodramas and 
Latin American soap operas. About 90 per cent 
of the films shown at the festival will never be 
seen in Africa because “there’s no real distri- 
bution network, just importers,” according to 
Dominique Wallon, who has written a report on 
the problem for the European Union. 
Almost all the market in French-speaking 
Africa is controlled by African American Films 
(AFRAM),which is a subsidiary of MPEAAM, a 
powerful Hollywood bridgehead. To get cinema- 
owners to take its films, AFRAM gives away 
copies in exchange for 30-40 per cent of box- 
office takings. In contrast, African films have 
to be rented at set prices. So it’s Sylvester Stal- 
lone and Arnold Schwarzenegger who swagger 
across African cinema screens. Small impoveri- 
shed neighbourhood cinemas often show just 
pirated videos. 
But there are pockets of resistance. Came- 
roonian producer Bassek Ba Kobhio has been 
running a scheme for the past four years called 
Ecrans Noirs, which distributes African films in 
Cameroon,Gabon,Congo-Brazzaville, the Cen- 
tral African Republic and soon Chad,using the 
region’s network of French cultural centres. 
But cinema managers say the distribution of 
African films will have to be subsidized because 
they rarely draw big crowds Nour-Eddine Sail, 
of Canal Plus Horizons, a French company, says 
the big television networks should be legally 
obliged to fund African film-making. Wallon 
thinks governments should build cinemas and 
allow the private sector to run them. It remains 
to be seen if African governments will take up 
these suggestions. u

Latin America’s

oc] A 
— 
Alongside state-run radio and large- 
scale private broadcasting networks 
there is another world of community 
radio stations, owned, run and editorially 
controlled by the public they serve.T hese 
“alternative” radio stations may not have 
a range beyond the slum, village or island 
from which they broadcast. Many of them 
are shoestring operations staffed by local 
volunteers. 
Unlike commercial radio, which makes 
money from advertising, community radio 
stations are not profit-oriented—though 
sometimes they accept a little advertising 
in order to survive. T hey are there to serve 
the local population. Because of their 
contribution to a culture of peace and the 
growth of democracy, they are making 
headway on every continent.

private and public pressure groups, com- 
munity radio has taken root all over the 
world, though on different scales and with 
differing effects. This is largely due to new 
and better technical equipment, cheaper 
FM transmitters and the gradual disappea- 
rance of public broadcasting monopolies. 
When recognized by the government 
and protected by law—as in the United 
States, Australia and Canada, for example— 
they coexist uncontentiously with com- 
mercial stations. A number of European 
countries have followed the example of 
France, where the law was changed in 1982 
to legalize “pirate” or “free” radio stations. 
In Africa and Asia, the growth of local 
radio has been spectacular. The most stri-

A champion of 
community radio 
stations warns of threats 
to their existence in 
Latin America 
ding to the Media Institute of South 
Africa (MISA), community broadcasting 
has great potential. On these continents 
community radio is helping to roll back 
illiteracy, promote education and provide 
information about health, the environ- 
ment, farming, democracy and hot issues 
like landmines. But in one part of the 
world, Latin America, it is under attack. 
Fewer voices 
Community radio stations involved in 
educational broadcasting or speaking out 
for trade unions, universities or indigenous 
peoples have been operating in Latin Ame- 
rica for more than half a century. “They’ve 
been used to announce all kinds of things, 
from prices down at the local market to 
someone’s horse that has gone astray,” says 
José Ignacio Lépez Vigil,the Latin Ameri- 
can and Caribbean representative of the 
World Association of Community Radio 
Broadcasters (AMARC). “They’ve also 
taught thousands of people to read and 
thousands more how to figure out where 
their employers have cheated them of their 
wages. They've helped to make sure that 
children were vaccinated and they've 
encouraged ordinary people to speak up.” 
There are probably more than 2,000 
community radio stations broadcasting in 
Latin America; 400 of them are affiliated 
to AMARC, twice as many as three years »

ago. But while their number keeps on 
growing, the stations are having problems 
obtaining legal recognition. 
Until recently, Latin America’s local 
radio stations coexisted with commercial 
stations without too much trouble. But 
the concentration of the media over the 
past few years has tended to push non- 
profit radio and smaller stations in gene- 
ral out of the picture. This has inevitably 
led to fewer voices being heard on the air. 
Most of Latin America’s community radio 
stations are waiting to be assigned a fixed 
frequency or else official permission to broad- 
cast. However they are not defined by their 
legal status but by their goals. Whether regis- 
tered as public or private companies (linked 
to universities, regions or towns), their defining 
feature is that they are non-profit organizations 
without any political axe to grind. 
Strong programmes, 
weak transmitters 
The fact that they are linked to the local 
community does not necessarily mean they 
are small or ill equipped. In fact existing sta- 
tions are trying to upgrade their technical 
resources, and new ones, such as Radio Tri- 
nidad FM in Paraguay, try to start up with the 
best possible facilities. Many stations have 
weak transmitters but make up for it by 
having computers in the newsroom. Some 
even broadcast via the Internet. 
Nor does their community spirit mean 
that they put out boring programmes with

poor-quality sound.The kind of intermi- 
nable discussions and across-the-block 
denunciations that characterized commu- 
nity radio in its early days has given way 
to more open-minded and witty pro- 
grammes which cover all aspects of life. 
In Europe a distinction has always been 
made between profit-oriented commercial 
radio and public-service broadcasting desi- 
gned to play a socio-cultural role.In Latin 
America,however, this distinction has been 
blurred because state-owned radio and tele- 
vision stations have been largely used as

political tools and have had little or no 
social or cultural value. 
In EI Salvador, a recent telecommuni- 
cations law gave clear advantage to profi- 
table private firms and established regula- 
tions which favour big capital, to the extent 
that even the country’s second biggest tele- 
vision station, which is private, was in 
danger of closing down.In Uruguay, radio 
operating licences have to be approved by 
the defence ministry, and broadcasters 
without a licence risk a prison sentence. In 
Alternative radio 
Community, free, pirate, local, indige- 
I nous,educational,insurrectional—these 
are just some of the labels used to describe 
“alternative” radio stations. A recently- 
published book* has identified about 20 
types all over the world, operating alongside 
“established” stations. 
Most of them belong to either the World 
Association of Community Radio Broad- 
casters (AMARC) or the International 
Association of Broadcasting (AIR). 
AMARC founded in August 1983 during 
the UN-sponsored World Communications 
Year, defends, co-ordinates and promotes 
radio stations around the world that are 
community-owned or broadcast socially- 
oriented programmes. With headquarters in 
Montreal, it has more than 2,000 mem- 
bers on five continents. 
AIR, which started in Mexico in 1946 as 
the Inter-American Association of Broad- 
casting, is based in Montevideo (Uruguay) 
4 4 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
and switched to its present name in 1985. 
It defends broadcasting which conforms 
to international technical and legal stan- 
dards and is a longstanding critic of com - 
munity radio stations on the grounds that 
some of them cause interference problems 
through not having an official frequency. But 
AIR also defends free expression of ideas 
and encourages co-operation between radio 
stations and organizations, both national 
and international and publicly and privately- 
owned. nu

Chile,the power of a transmitter is limited 
to one watt. In Brazil and Argentina, new 
legislation is looming which would concen- 
trate radio ownership even further and thus 
narrow the public’s choice. 
In Peru, one of the few countries in 
Latin America where community radio sta- 
tions can operate without too many legal 
problems, a new law passed in March 1998 
banned non-profit stations from accepting 
even the very small amount of advertising 
which could ensure their survival. Since 
they receive no state subsidy or support, 
they are doomed to close, and this means 
that several sources of criticism of the pre- 
sent government will fall silent. 
Closing doors 
Their staff have appealed in vain to 
the national ombudsman (Defensor del 
Pueblo), and press freedom officials of the 
Organization of American States have 
approached the government without suc- 
cess. If the law is applied, dozens of sta- 
tions may have to shut down. 
One of them 1s Radio Cutivali, which 
has about 400,000 listeners in the north 
of the country and is the region’s main 
medium-wave station.T he station, which 
is named after a pre-Inca Indian leader, 
won a United Nations prize last year for 
its “successful efforts to fight poverty”.

It is also the only station attached to 
Propuesta Regional, a “development forum” 
whose participants include professional, 
university and religious associations inde- 
pendent of the government. It played a key 
role in helping the population survive the 
rains and flooding brought by the El Nifio 
weather phenomenon. 
Listeners say their favourite pro- 
grammes are the station’s competitions to 
encourage writing inspired by local tales 
and legends, which have attracted more 
than 1,300 amateur writers from towns 
all over northern Peru. Equally popular 
are regional song festivals sponsored by 
Panasonic and other firms, which give 
dozens of self-taught authors and compo- 
sers a hearing they would never have 
enjoyed on commercial stations. 
Cutivalii is not the only Peruvian radio 
station whose future hangs in the balance. 
The same goes for Radio M araiion, which 
broadcasts from Jaén, in the Amazon 
region. At the other end of the country, in 
Puno, near the Bolivian border, Radio 
Onda Azul is in danger of losing its net- 
work of rural correspondents because it 
can no longer afford to pay them. 
All these laws violate constitutional 
rights and go against current internatio- 
nal guarantees of freedom of expression. 
Community radio stations, which are by 
definition poor, have taken all kinds of 
legal steps to defend themselves. In 
Argentina and Paraguay, they have mana- 
CONNEXIONS 
ged to survive because they have won 
their case. In Ecuador, they successfully 
challenged a law before the country’s 
constitutional court. Ombudsmen in EI 
Salvador and Peru have made strong sta- 
tements defending the stations’ rights. 
Fair shares 
on the air 
What is at stake in Latin America is 
very clear. Will the airwaves, which are 
part of overall human heritage, be mono- 
polized by commercial firms, or will be 
they also be available, as they are everyw- 
here else in the world, to communities, 
educational groups and non-profit orga- 
nizations, in other words to the full spec- 
trum of civil society exercising its right to 
free expression? 
What lies ahead for community radio 
stations? They defend the right to free 
speech, help to create the diversity of opi- 
nion which is an essential feature of 
democracy, and encourage local develop- 
ment,a culture of peace, the protection of 
the environment and other civic causes 
which cannot be measured in terms of 
financial gain. 
The history of the right to speak on 
the air began at the beginning of the cen- 
tury. Its defenders around the world have 
had to wage many struggles and make 
many sacrifices. Today it is more impor- 
tant than ever to ensure there is room for 
everyone on the airwaves. u

Brain waves 
to help 
the disabled 
I people may soon be able to 
write on computer screens by using electrical 
signals from their brain. 
Two research teams, one in the United States, 
the other in Germany, have come up with a 
device which,with the help of two small elec- 
trodes attached to the top of the skull, “ reads’ 
the waves given off by the brain.Three people 
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenera- 
tive motor neurone disease, used the method to 
write a short sentence over half an hour. 
“These patients couldn’t communicate at 
all” says Edward Taub of the University of Ala- 
bama in an article in the January 1999 issue of 
New Scientist magazine. He and Niels Birbaumer, 
of the University of Tibingen,record electrical 
signals coming from the cortex of the brain. 
The patients, by developing their ability to give 
positive or negative signals, control the upward 
or downward movement of a cursor which 
chooses from among 32 letters and punctuation 
marks on the screen. 
The two teams are writing a computer pro- 
gramme which could speed things up by anti- 
cipating words from the first few letters, depen- 
ding on the context of the sentence and the 
frequency with which words are used in the 
language. 
Several other researchers around the world 
are trying to harness the potential of brain 
signalsto relieve the ordeal of paralysed people. 
Last year an Australian team managed to get 
patients to operate a switch from signals regis- 
tered on a brain scan.A team in Atlanta,in the 
U.S. implanted electrodes in the brains of two 
people, enabling them to write messages on a 
computer screen.But a dangerous brain ope- 
ration is needed. The team is hoping one day to 
come up with a device that can use brain signals 
to stimulate muscles and restore partial use of 
some limbs. u

### 115615: Leila Shahid: the resolve of a Palestinian envoy

Leila Shahid 
The resolve 
of a Palestinian envoy 
  
Since her high-school days she has embraced the Palestinian cause. Now, 
as the Palestinian Authority’s representative in France, Leila Shahid is 
continuing the fight for the creation of a Palestinian state, for women’s rights 
and peaceful coexistence at the heart of Mediterranean civilization 
As Palestine’s representative in France and a 
spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority, 
you're often in the media spotlight. But you 
only have a very brief entry in the latest 
edition of Who’s Who in the Arab World . . . 
Perhaps it’s better that way. I'm not an 
ambassador in the usual sense because 
Palestine isn’t a state yet. As representa- 
tive of a people who for the past half-century 
have been trying to win recognition, I have 
to fight a battle on two fronts. One—more 
behind-the-scenes—is to maintain close 
ties with France and the European Union 
so as to defend the political rights of the 
Palestinian people. The other is public, and 
involves correcting a number of widely- 
accepted “facts” through the media. The 
Palestinian question is perhaps the most 
consistently and massively distorted inter- 
national political issue. 
Not so long ago it was said that the Pales- 
tinian people didn’t exist. Palestine was consi- 
dered a country without inhabitants—a 
desert—for a people without a land, the Jews. 
Its name was removed from maps and history 
books the day Israel was created. 
It’s been an existential battle. For 
decades, Israelis thought they would cease 
to exist if they recognized the Palestinian 
people. And Europeans thought that reco- 
gnizing the Palestinians would be tanta- 
mount to betraying the Israelis, a people 
towards whom they had strong guilt feelings 
because of the Holocaust.So we’ve had to 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - April 1999 
fight to set things straight and show that 
recognition could happen on an equal basis. 
Most Israelis today, especially the new gene- 
ration of historians, agree that Palestine 
wasn’t a desert in 1948. 
The other main historical distortion has 
been the dismissal of the Palestinian people 
as a bunch of armed fighters and terrorists. 
The intifada, which lasted from 1987 to 
1993, did a lot to show there was a society 
there, just like any other, with all its compo- 
nents, including women and children. But 
there’s still prejudice. Palestinians are still tar- 
gets of stereotypes regarding Arabs and Mus- 
lims in general. T hey spring from everyday 
racism and the legacy of colonial times. 
You're a “foreign” Palestinian— one from 
the outside. How did your family come to 
leave Palestine and what was it like to live 
in exile? 
My mother’s family has always been very 
involved in the Palestinian national move- 
ment born at the turn of the century after 
the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the 
beginning of the British Mandate in Pales- 
tine which was supposed to pave the way for 
independence.From then on, Palestinians 
began to demand the right to found a state. 
But it very soon became clear that, unlike 
Syria and Lebanon, Palestine would not 
succeed in that goal, because it had to make 
way for the Jewish national home which 
the British had promised to the Zionists. 
When the Palestinian national move- 
ment saw that political and diplomatic 
means were not enough to reverse what 
was happening, it resorted to arms. The 
first big Palestinian uprising against the 
British, the first intifada, was in 1936. My 
grandfather and great uncle took part in it. 
In 1939, my grandfather was arrested and 
sent off to a military camp in the Seychelles. 
Like all the leaders of the movement, he was 
detained until 1945, during which time 
women and children were deported to areas 
under the French mandate. So my mother, 
who came from Jerusalem, found herself in 
Lebanon. It was there that she met my 
father, who had come as a student from 
Acre, in Palestine. They got married and my 
two sisters and I grew up outside Pales- 
tine,like two-thirds of all Palestinians. 
Where does your political awareness stem 
from? 
My family. I was very affected by the 1967 
Arab-Israeli war, which broke out the day I 
was due to take my high school graduation 
exam, on June 5.T he exam was cancelled. We 
were sure that we’d win the war, but when we 
realized after six days that Israel had beaten 
all the Arab armies—of Syria, Egypt and 
Jordan—we were shattered. June 1967 was a 
very deep shock for Arab intellectuals. We 
thought that the international community 
would be sympathetic to the injustice and 
exile Palestinians were forced to endure. We

thought that it would support us. But it 
applauded the Israeli victory instead. 
I decided to get involved in political 
activism and I began learning how to handle 
weapons. It was a symbolic way of restoring 
a sense of dignity. But I soon realized I 
wasn’t cut out for the military and opted for 
political and social work in the Palestinian 
refugee camps. In my first year of university, 
I took part in activities to prepare for the 
intifada. In 1969, the refugees rose up to win 
the right to organize politically and manage 
their own affairs. From then on, the various 
groups which made up the Palestine Libe- 
ration Organization (PLO) took part in 
running the camps, which were adminis- 
tered by the United Nations via UNWRA 
(the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near 
East). This was a very intense period for me. 
I felt like T had returned to Palestine and 
rediscovered my history and culture. After 
that, T went off to study anthropology in 
France, where I met my husband, who is 
Moroccan, and we went to live in his country. 
In 1989, President Arafat asked me to repre- 
sent the PLO in Ireland. From there 1 was 
sent to the Netherlands and finally to France.

who might have wanted to get the upper 
hand. My father, who was a professor of 
medicine,believed strongly in the equality 
of the sexes, and both my parents always 
backed me in whatever [ wanted to do. My 
husband has the same attitude. 
How has the Arab-Israeli conflict affected 
Palestinian women? 
Many women found themselves in foreign 
countries, away from their traditional vil- 
lage surroundings, side by side with men 
who were traumatized and jobless. These 
men were so humiliated by the loss of their 
the Arab world. But Palestinian women have 
always been aware that their role in the resis- 
tance would not be enough to guarantee 
them equal rights with men. So they have 
tried to organize themselves, not just as mili- 
tant nationalists but also as women. 
To do what? 
There are a number of women’s organiza- 
tions. Many are working on a code to define 
the status of women and a constitutional 
guarantee of equality. T here is a good starting 
point since the 1988 declaration underlines 
that the Palestinian state will have a parlia-

the women had to take charge of things and

If they hadn’t been uprooted like this, it 
would have taken decades to break with tra- 
dition. Also, UNWRA, which was in charge 
of education and health in the refugee camps, 
inside and outside Palestine, set up a system 
of compulsory education for all, both boys 
and girls. This partly explains why Palesti-

region, where individualrights are based on

### 115615: Leila Shahid: the resolve of a Palestinian envoy

Zeit University has the region’s only centre 
for women’s studies. 
Yet there are very few women in the 
Palestinian Authority. Isn’t there a risk of 
finding the Algerian syndrome in which 
women are sent back to the kitchen as 
soon as the struggle is over? 
The fight isn’t over, either against the occu- 
pation or for women’s rights. And the two 
are linked. For women,everything depends 
on the balance of power in the society. T he 
An eclectic 
education 
ducation is considered a major priority for 
Palestinians, an observation difficult to quan- 
tify given the scope of the diaspora. However, the 
political upheaval surrounding the intifada has 
taken a toll on education in the territories:lite- 
racy rates have declined, while the dearth of 
trained professionals in science and techno- 
logy hampers the economic development. 
The Palestinian Ministry of Education, offi- 
cially set up in 1994, has the major task of conso- 
lidating the eclectic system of public and private 
schools inherited after 27 years of occupation. In 
the West Bank, for example, schoolchildren follow 
nine years of courses based on Jordanian curri- 
cula, while in Gaza, they take ten years of classes 
following the Egyptian model. This system dates 
back to 1948 when UNrRwA (the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees 
in the Near East) began setting up schools in 
the refugee camps to reflect the curricula of the 
host nations. Today, the challenge lies in inte- 
grating these different schools as well as the 
public schools set up bythe ministry and a small 
percentage of private schools established by 
Muslim and Christian organizations. Overall the 
gender ratio in enrolment at the primary level is 
equal, although girls tend to have higher drop-out 
rates as they move on to secondary levels and 
higher education. All of the territories eight uni- 
versities and over half of the some 20 community 
colleges are private. 
The ministry is working closely with UNESCO, 
a long-standing educational partner, to inte- 
grate the various schools and find the funding 
to enlarge the system as Palestinian families 
return from the diaspora.A major priority also 
liesin developing a standard curriculum and in 
particular courses in Palestinian history—a for- 
bidden subject throughout 27 years of occu- 
pation. |

TALKING TO... 
future of the progressive, secularist ten- 
dency led by President Arafat depends on 
the peace process. If that collapses, the fun- 
damentalist position will get stronger and 
automatically harm the position of women. 
Are schools co-ed in Palestine? 
There are two kinds of schools—the 
UNWRA ones in the camps and those in 
the autonomous areas run by the Palestinian 
Authority since 1994. Both are co-educa- 
tional, except for a few in the Gaza Strip 
which are private schools serving the more 
conservative elements of society. 
What laws govern the status of Palestinian 
women today? 
It depends where they live.M any legal sys- 
tems coexist in Palestine—Ottoman,English, 
Egyptian (in the Gaza Strip), Jordanian (the 
West Bank) and Israeli (civil and military, in 
East Jerusalem).It’s a unique situation—so 
many legal systems applying to so few people. 
We're trying to come up with a body of laws 
that will be truly Palestinian. 
You emphasize that a solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is crucial for the 
whole Mediterranean region. Why? 
After the creation of the state of Israel, the 
conflict spread to Egypt, which was the first 
country to sign a peace treaty, to southern 
Lebanon, which has been occupied for 20 
years, the Golan Heights (Syria), occupied for 
30 years, and to Jordan, which recently signed 
a peace treaty. A resolution of the conflict 
will show whether the peoples of the Medi- 
terranean can live together in mutual res- 
pect. If Palestinians and Israelis can manage 
to do this, their example can encourage 
others—Berbers and Arabs, Turks and Kurds, 
for example. Palestine isn’t like other coun- 
tries. It’s the heart of Mediterranean civiliza- 
tion, the only place which brings together

TALKING TO... 
An early start: Palestinian children at play school in Rafah,Gaza. 
the three major monotheistic religions and 
their cultures. Their peaceful coexistence 
would have an impact beyond the region— 
everywhere that different cultures are trying 
to reject and exclude one another. 
The Arab world currently seems to consist 
of groups trying to dominate one another. 
The Arab world hasn’t always been like this. 
It’s a very recent phenomenon. Don’t forget 
that in Andalusia, Europeans and Arabs lived 
together in extremely fruitful harmony until 
the time of the Inquisition, when Christians 
excluded Jews and Muslims from society. 
The lack of tolerance we see in the Arab- 
Muslim world today is part of a contemporary 
political crisis which began with the founding 
of nation-states. It isn’t an inherent part of 
Arab culture. It’s to do with the failure of poli- 
tical systems which have managed to defeat 
colonialism but haven’t found the path to 
democracy or given people a chance to aspire

in political, economic and cultural terms. So 
they've failed, which is why people set such 
importance on their own identity or seek an 
alternative political ideology in religion. 
The interim period for the application of 
the Oslo Accords ends on May 4. What's the 
outcome of this process? 
It’s disappointing. The peace process has 
been at a standstill ever since Mr Netanyahu 
came to power three years ago. So we're far 
behind the agreed timetable. T he Israeli army 
  
should have withdrawn from all the occu- 
pied territories. But so far we only control 
three per cent of the West Bank and 60 per 
cent of the Gaza Strip. We should have been 
able to hold both parliamentary and local 
elections, but the latter haven’t been pos- 
sible. We should have completed most of the 
toughest negotiations over the status of Jeru- 
salem, refugees, settlements, borders and 
water, but we haven't even started yet. So 
does that mean nothing has been achieved? 
No, some gains are irreversible. The most 
important is the mutual recognition between 
Israeli and Palestinian governments and socie- 
ties. It is now accepted that the Palestinian 
people exist and have national rights. The 
second gain has been the right of return to the 
homeland—the el-owda of the Palestinian 
national movement which developed in 
exile—has been recognized. It was marked by 
the return of President Arafat to build a state. 
What has been done to create new 
infrastructures? 
Roads,industries and farms in the territo- 
ries recovered by the Palestinian Authority 
were mostly destroyed during the 30 years 
of the occupation. So far, not much progress 
has been made here, mainly because the ter- 
ritories have been sealed off by the Israeli 
army. The economy can’t take off if the cir- 
culation of goods and people is blocked. »

TALKING TO... 
Women on their way to the polls in the 1996 legislative elections. 
This obstacle 1s smaller in social matters. 
Great progress has been made in education 
with the help of the European Union and 
UNEsco. Palestinians invest a tremendous 
amount in educating their children. I don’t 
know of any other people, except perhaps 
the Jews, who have compensated so much 
for the loss of territory by acquiring know- 
ledge. But there’s still a lot to be done, 
especially creating a modern curriculum 
tailored to Palestinians and not copied from 
courses in Egypt, Jordan or Israel. 
Has the international community kept its 
promises? 
Yes, absolutely. Donor countries can be 
commended for guaranteeing the education 
and health of a people wracked by eco- 
nomic crisis. Over 60 per cent of the wor- 
king population in the Gaza Strip is unem- 
ployed, and over 47 per cent in the West 
Bank. But this aid won’t have any really 
positive effect unless the private sector 
seriously invests,and for that we need sta- 
bility and normalized political conditions. 
There’s been a lot of talk in the press about 
irregularities and corruption inside the 
Palestinian Authority. What has been done 
to tackle this? 
It’s the kind of problem that threatens all 
societies, including the most advanced ones 
in Europe. So imagine the difficulty in Pales- 
tine, where there aren’t laws or a legal system 
in place yet. There won’t be transparency 
or genuine pluralism until there’s a state of 
law, and we don’t have a state yet. 
How is the Palestinian Authority preparing 
for the May 4 deadline? 
The Israeli government has decided to hold 
elections on May 17 to effectively cancel the 
May 4 deadline set in the Oslo Accords. 
After May 4 there will be a legal no-man’s- 
land. The big question is who will fill the 
void? We can’t live forever on a temporary 
basis. Are we going to let the Israeli govern- 
ment take away our rights? Can the Palesti- 
nians decide unilaterally to set up a state in 
the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem ?Will 
the international community shoulder its 
responsibilities after having recognized Pales- 
tinians’ right to self-determination? All these 
questions will arise on May 4. 
Will you live in Palestine one day? 
As one of the four million refugees living 
outside Palestine, my status isn’t yet defined. 
It will be part of the final negotiations. My 
greatest dream is to live in Palestine. 
Where? 
In Jerusalem,I hope. Hu
