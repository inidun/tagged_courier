HOTOGRAPHY has been hailed as the most typical art 
of the 20th century. Yet it is hardly more than a 
hundred years since the invention of “writing with light” 
opened a new window on the world to mankind. Certain 
persons can still remember the time when good pictures 
were a rarity; ‘when only the most expensive books had 
good illustrations; when only the wealthy could afford 
good pictures in their homes. 
Today photographs are everywhere around us. We see 
them in books and magazines, in newspapers, on posters 
in shops, and in the high-quality colour reproductions of 
‘works of art hanging on our walls. We can see pictures 
in motion on a cinema screen or projected thousands of 
miles through space by television. We can read cumber- 
some, ‘weighty books from tiny microfilm records stored 
easily in libraries, and we can record what scientists see 
with a telescope, an electron microscope or an X-ray 
machine. Photography is now more widely used by 
science, industry, the arts and schools than even the 
most fanatic of its early prophets had ever dared to 
imagine, 
Certain notes of alarm, it is true, have been voiced of 
~ late against this mass invasion of photography. “Nothing 
is more vain,” one art historian recently wrote, “than to 
believe in the all-powerfulness of the pictorial image.” . 
At a Unesco-supported international colloquium in Geneva 
last September, a distinguished group of thinkers debated 
the subject under the general theme “Is Culture in Peril 2”. 
The French writer André Chamson, in a profound analysis 
of the achievements of “photography, warned of the 
danger of a “possible imperialism” of the pictorial image 
which is flooding the world “like a burglar, armed with 
a jemmy, snapping the lock off a door and entering a 
house by surprise.” 
But even the severest critics do not seek to deny that 
photography has helped to enrich our lives, that it has 
given us a new vision of the ‘world, and that it speaks a 
universal language. Last summer an international round 
table on the role of the image in contemporary civiliza- 
tion was held at Unesco House under the auspices of the 
French National Commission for Unesco and the Interna- 
tional Biennal of Photography Cinema and Optics. Scien- 
tists, educators, artists and technicians from many 
countries engaged in a broad exchange of views on the 
many domains of human activity now dependent on 
photography. They stressed the importance of the 
pictorial image in information and education and its 
value as a new “universal language capable of being 
understood by everyone regardless of degree of culture.” 
They pointed to the use that could be made of pictures 
in promoting international understanding. Their meeting 
also saw the creation of an International Centre for still 
and animated Photography with headquarters in Paris. 
The round table discussed the familiar saying that “a 
picture is worth a thousand words” and took the view 
that certain photographs are “worth ten million words 
provided they are accompanied by about ten words.” In 
certain cases, it was admitted, appropriate arrangement 
or lay-ou{ can take the place of captions. Every good 
photograph has a specific meaning but its inclusion into 
a group or ensemble imparts new meaning to it. 
One exhibition entitled “The Family of Man” was cited 
as an example where each photograph by itself “does not 
tell the story” but the message is conveyed by the 
ensemble of photographs. In this issue a section is 
devoted to a presentation of “The Family of Man” a 
camera testament that illustrates one of the principal 
goals of Unesco today: the unity of all mankind within its 
varied diversity,

PUBLIC LIBRARY

hen the Government of India and UNESCO opened 
an experimental public library In Delhi just over four 
years ago pessimists pointed out that most of the city’s 
population was illiterate. Nevertheless at the end of 
the first year 2,300 readers a day were visiting the 
library, and for 78 per cent of them this was their first 
visit to a public library. Today the library has over 
60,000 books in English, Urdu and Hindi and serves 
70,000 people a month. As Asia's busiest and most 
modern public library~open || hours a day, and every 
day of the week—it recently served as headquarters and 
“laboratory” for a UNESCO seminar on the develop- 
ment of public libraries in Asia directed by Mr. Frank, 
M. Gardner, author of the accompanying article. Mr. 
Gardner who is Borough Librarian of Luton in the 
United Kingdom spent eight months in Delhi in 1951 
and 1952 as UNESCO consultant to the Indian Government 
and helped to set up the library which today has a staff 
of 47 directed by Mr. Des Raj Kalia, a UNESCO-trained 
indian librarian. Its present services include a Children’s 
Department, Reference Section, Lending Library and a 
Social Education and Extension Service. Photos on these 
pages show (from left to right): an assistant librarian 
bringing new books to the Delhi Library, the Library 
building opposite the Delhi Railway Station, library users 
keeping up to date with the news in the reading room.

public library. He appears to be under thirty, he is 
probably unmarried, and he is either a student or a 
clerical worker of some kind. The library is some distance 
from his home, and he has to make a special journey to 
get there, since it is not on his regular route to office or 
university, but he goes fairly regularly, and has been a 
member for quite a long time. When he gets to the 
library he will spend a little time reading, probably a 
newspaper, or perhaps one of the reference works, before 
he changes his book, which he prefers to read at home. 
He is allowed only one book—he would like more but the 
library has not yet a large enough stock to permit this. 
Though he can read English and possibly Urdu, he 
usually prefers. a book in his native language, Hindi—if he 
can find one. He probably chooses a 
novel by an author he knows, most 
likely a love story or a story of 
modern India. He is not greatly 
concerned about the newness of the 
book—it is the contents that interest 
him. If he wants a non-fiction book 
he takes it because of its general in- 
terest rather than as a source of in- 
formation for use in an examination 
or a college assignment. He would 
probably prefer a biography, but 
there aren’t enough in Hindi, so he 
may take out a book of plays or 
poetry, of which there are plenty. 
This is not. any particular young 
man. It is a composite picture of the 
typical reader at the Delhi Public 
Library in India as shown by a survey 
recently undertaken by Unesco of the 
use and reading habits of the 
members. The survey is an appraisal 
of what the Library has achieved in 
its five years of existence, the nature 
of its problems in the past, and what 
its problems are likely to be in the 
future. This is the first survey to be 
undertaken <or a public library in 
Asia, and the results are not only of 
vital interest to library development 
in Asia, but also tell a fascinating 
story of social habits which sometimes 
diverge from and sometimes parallel social habits in 
other countries. 
The story is told by the people themselves, through 
answers given to 1,300 questionnaires by groups of users 
and non-users of the Library. It is itself a commentary 
on social habits for whereas in the West the questionnaire 
has become an object of some suspicion, in Delhi, 
according to the Delhi School of Social Work which 
undertook the distribution and recording of the ques- 
tionnaires, the utmost: co-operation was -achieved in 
obtaining answers to the 40 or so questions put to each 
person, 
One startling fact that immediately emerges is that the 
S OMEWHERE in Asia a young man is on his way to the 
  
The Unesco Courier, — February 1956 
membership of the library is almost exclusively male, only 
6 % of the readers being women, and only 14 % over 
thirty years old. Though the Library has not been 
successful in attracting the female sex, it has been a great 
draw for children, for 29 % of the members are children 
under 16—an encouraging sign for the future. Even 
though women are shy about coming to the Library, they 
possibly induce the menfolk to come on their behalf, as 
over a third of readers report that their books are used 
by other members of the family. Even the old-fashioned, 
though pleasant habit of reading aloud survives, for 10 % 
of people questioned say they read aloud to their families. 
Eleven percent of readers are university students—a 
high figure, but not as high as was feared by those who 
thought that a public library in Asia was likely to be 
 
swamped by students seeking additional textbooks. 
Nearly all the readers have at least a primary education, 
and most have a secondary education. 
What do these young people come to read at thelibrary? 
What languages do they read in? What subjects do they 
prefer? Primarily they do not come to read in the library 
at all. Like Western readers, they prefer to read their 
books at home, and though the library has reading rooms 
for newspapers and periodicals, and a growing reference 
section, its main business is lending books—over a million 
in the last four years. Of members questioned, 90 % 
gave the reading of books as their first preference, and 
nearly 90 % prefer to read them at home, which may 
surprise those who have thought that the demand for 
public libraries in Asia could be satisfled by newspaper 
reading rooms, and that home conditions might limit the 
value of lending libraries. 
The purposes of reading are wide, and not easily defined. 
But of 220 readers questioned, only 17 said they used the 
public library for college or school assignments, and 
another 17 to prepare for examinations. Eighty-four 
people said they read for general interest, 49 to increase 
general knowledge. Ten had the laudable ambition of 
getting a better job, and 35 wanted to improve their 
reading ability. It would be hard to find a better all- 
round justification of public library objectives than is 
contained in these statements. 
About half the readers prefer fiction, about a quarter 
non-fiction, and the others have no preference. Romance 
is an important factor, since love stories come first in 
fiction favour (possibly the women at home exerting in- 
fluence here!), next come stories about modern India, 
crime and detective stories, and stories about historical 
India. Political novels and psychological novels are 
among the least liked, as also, curiously enough are love 
stories. Apparently the romantic novel is both actively 
liked and actively disliked. 
In non-fiction, the greatest preference is 
for biography (chosen nearly twice as often 
as any other subject) then follow literature,

NO RESISTING THE MAGIC LURE 
Children seem to be drawn into the Delhi public library as if by the legendary Pied Piper. Around 309%, 
of members are under 16 years of age — an encouraging sign for the future. Hundreds of children visit 
the library every day attracted by a special reading room where they can enjoy simple games and suitable 
books. Library received toys and games (above, left) through Unesco’s Voluntary International Assis- 
tance Division. As there is a shortage of books in Hindi and Urdu, English words in young girl's book

TOWNSFOLK CHOOSE FICTION 
(Continued from politics, and self-improvement. The 
page 5) most disliked subjects, according to 
replies given by readers, are politics, 
psychology and technology. 
When the enquiry was extended beyond the Central 
- Library to other service points that have been established, 
some further interesting facts came out. The Mobile 
Library service covers parts of Delhi and also extends 
into rural areas. One would naturally expect the villages 
to have a simpler outlook on reading, but in fact, it 
emerges quite definitely that the taste of the villager is 
more solid than that of the urban reader. In the urban 
area, 80 % of the books loaned are fiction, but when the 
library goes to the villages, carrying the same stock, only 
40 % of the books issued are fiction. The village reader 
prefers biography, religion and literature. 
Deposit stations have been established by the Library 
in Social Education Centres, and here again the pattern 
of readers and their choices vary from those who use the 
Central Library and the Mobile Library. : Readers at 
deposit stations include more older people and more 
women, 21 % of the readers being female. The standard 
of education is also lower, which is what one ‘would 
expect, since the social education centres are specifically 
for the less-educated 
classes. . 
But if these readers 
are less-educated, they 
are much more vocal 
about possible improve- 
ments in the library 
service than readers at 
the Central Library. 
Whereas very few read- 
ers there have any 
complaint, 73 readers 
questioned at deposit 
stations voiced 161 
complaints. Nearly all 
want more books, some 
want simpler books, 
some want more books 
in Hindi, others more 
books in English, some 
"want more variety, 
others more books by 
modern writers. They 
are all united, however, 
on one thing—they 
want more books. 
And here lies one of 
the major expansion 
problems of the Delhi 
Public Library. In five 
years, it has accumu- 
lated a stock of over 
60,000 books. Only, 
half of these are in 
Hindi, ‘whereas nearly 
two-thirds of the libra- 
ry’s use is in this lan- 
guage and the demand 
is increasing all the 
time. But the books are simply not available and even 
those that exist wear out faster than they can be replaced. 
The life of a book in Hindi averages, as shown by this 
inquiry, about 16 loans before it is worn out, as against 
between fifty and a hundred loans in a Western library. 
Thus the Delhi Library is being defeated by its own 
success. The fact that nearly 50 % of its readers travel 
a mile or more to use it, that the unbearably hot summer 
of Delhi makes no difference at all to library use, shows 
the eagerness of the readers. But speed of expansion is 
dictated by the availability of books for purchase, and the 
facilities for maintaining and increasing a usable 
bookstock. 
There are, of course, other problems too, shown. up by 
the survey, problems that must be solved before the public

library is a 
completely in- 
tegrated part 
of community 
life. Not near- 
ly enough 
women, older 
people (only 
2,59% are over 
45), and above 
all, not nearly 
enough newly- 
literates or less 
educated peo- 
ple use the fa- 
cilities offered 
by the library. 
The children at school, the students, the educated 
professional classes have seized the opportunity to profit 
by the facilities of a modern public library, but the others 
have not come forward, perhaps because the books avail- 
able are too difficult, perhaps because they are overawed 
by the atmosphere of a large library, perhaps because 
they have no leisure to go to the library, or facilities to 
read in comfort. Even the many extension activities of 
the library—lectures, 
film shows, discussion 
groups—which it ‘was 
thought would attract 
and hold the less edu- 
cated, are used almost 
entirely by the better 
educated of the library 
members. 
In bringing out these 
facts the survey pre- 
sents a challenge and 
a line of policy for the 
future that will un- 
doubtedly be taken up. 
The problems are 
those of circumstances 
and ones not easily 
overcome. But once 
realized, they can be 
met, for not only does 
the report show up 
clearly and unmistak- 
,ably what are the pro- 
blems, it also offers a 
line of approach. By 
placing its branches in 
fundamental educa- 
tion centres, with the 
backing of a central 
library organization 
and trained staff,” a 
public library can fur- 
ther its own purposes 
and those of social 
education. In its first 
five years the library 
has achieved a great 
deal. Now that this objective report has been compiled, 
it can extend its horizons and can advance towards 
further goals.

But it should not be thought that the better-educated 
in Asia can fend for themselves in their reading needs. 
They are the people who can benefit immediately from 
public libraries, and here the Delhi Public Library’s 
success is unqualified. 
One of the most startling facts brought out by the 
survey is that 26 % of the Library’s 20,000 readers did not 
read at all before joining the library, and 60 % have no 
books whatever at home. More than anything else, the 
need for more public library services in Asia is shown by 
these two facts.

TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE 
URING the past five years, thousands of men and 
women have left their home countries and have 
gone to all parts of the world—ranging from the 
plateaux of Bolivia to the rice paddies of the Philip- 
pines—to work for a common ideal: to help other peoples 
fight three great evils: hunger, poverty and ignorance. 
They have been transplanting their special skills and 
experience to help these peoples to modernize their 
industries, increase their knowledge and develop their 
natural resources, under the United Nations Expanded 
Programme of Technical Assistance. 
Technical Assistance covers a wide range of diverse 
activities. As one authority has said: “Truly to judge and 
assay technical assistance, one must go out into the fields 
and to the factories, the fishing grounds and the hospitals, 
the classrooms and the airfields in which the Programme 
operates. It is there that one finds out what technical 
assistance means and with what true appreciation and 
regard the governments and peoples of these countries 
look upon those who perform its works.” 
The degree of under-development differs from country 
to country; consequently, the nature and the types of

assistance vary greatly in different parts of the world. 
In some cases, projects may be in the preliminary stage, 
designed to advise and assist the less-developed countries, 
to survey their potential resources, to formulate general 
plans of development and to establish the institutional 
framework: administrative services and institutions 
covering labour, agriculture, education, health, civil 
aviation, meteorology and telecommunications. 
In other cases experts or teams of experts carry out 
specific assignments in connexion with particular develop- 
ment programmes. International experts are helping to 
establish penicillin and DDT factories, steel and cement 
plants and fertilizer and food-processing factories. They 
are helping to carry out man-power organization and 
vocational and technical training programmes. They are 
co-operating in the development of land and water 
resources, oi livestock production, of modern slaughter- 
houses and improved systems of production and distri- 
bution of milk, with United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) assistance for pasteurization plants, mechani- 
zation of fishing craft, efiective use for farm implements, 
and improvement of nutritional levels. 
They are helping in the organi- 
zation of schools to train teachers 
  
NEScO is expanding its technical assistance programme in education and science 
this year to the highest point it has ever reached since the United Nations 
world programme of technical assistance for economic development went 
into operation five years ago. Following recent approval by the U.N. General 
Assembly of a $29,734,000 programme of technical assistance by the United Nations 
and ils agencies in 1956, UNEsco announced that its share of this programme will 
amount to $4,940,933 as compared to $3,937,653 in 1955. ’ 
Malcolm S. Adiseshiah, Assistant Unesco Director-General and former head of 
UNESCO'S technical assistance department, reported that unesco will have 300 
technical assistance experts in the field in 51 countries this year. At the end 
of 1955, 162 experts were working in 43 countries. 
The expansion of UNESco’s programme and also the rise in its share of the 
total U.N. technical assistance budget from 13 % to 16.6 % were attributed by 
Mr. Adiseshiah to an increased demand for aid in education and science. Requests 
now total 327 and come from 52 countries on four continents. Demand is highest 
for international specialists to assist countries in modernizing their systems of 
primary and secondary education. Next biggest field is that of fundamental 
education (education aimed at raising living standards), followed by scientific 
research, technical education, science teaching and scientific documentation centres. 
Among its other technical assistance operations, UNEsco has helped to set up a 
national fundamental education training centre in the back country of Liberia, has 
helped to reorganize primary and secondary schools in Thailand, has shared in the 
launching of two modern institutes of technology in India and has participated in 
the study of water resources in Brazil and in desert research in Egypt.

institutes. They are aiding in cam- 
paigns to wipe out common epidemics 
and diseases such as malaria and 
tuberculosis, and helping to train 
personnel for the development of civil 
aviation and telecommunications and 
meteorological services. 
The major emphasis in technical 
assistance activities is on the training 
of the nationals of less-developed 
countries so that, in time, they can 
assume the ‘work initiated by the 
experts. Special training program- 
mes are provided, such as regional 
training seminars or fellowships for 
study abroad at particular institu- 
tions or for practical observation and 
training in the more advanced 
countries. 
Most technical assistance projects 
also involve on-the-job 
training of local person- (Cont’d on

of the U.N. Expanded Programme activities. In Brazil, in 
Libya and in Turkey, the public administration schools 
organized by the Technical Assistance Administration 
have trained a large number of nationals in public 
administration, accounting and general clerical work. In 
Mexico and other Latin-American countries, in Libya, and 
Haiti, in Egypt, Iraq and other Arab States, in Ceylon and 
Thailand, more than 1,000 trained specialists in funda- 
mental education and community development are now 
at work on national plans for decreasing illiteracy and 
raising living standards. 
Over 600 engineers, foremen and skilled workers from 
various branches of industry in Yugoslavia, Turkey, 
Bolivia, Colombia, Israel and Iran have been placed under 
the International Labour Organization (ILO) worker- 
trainees’ programme for observation and for on-the-job 
training in 314 different firms of sixteen host countries. 
In Haiti ILO experts have assisted in developing training 
courses through which many automobile mechanics,

provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) to Brazil for the development of the Amazon Valley. 
In Ceylon and in India, the fishing-boat mechanization 
programme of FAO has reached a stage where practical 
results in terms of better and larger catches can be 
realized. 
Assistance is being given under regional and inter- 
regional projects. A number of problems concern more 
than one country, and thus could often be handled more 
economically and more effectively on a regional basis. 
Training seminars, in ‘which nationals of countries with 
similar climatic and physical conditions participate, provi- 
de practical demonstration and training. The eradication 
of human and animal diseases ‘which do not respect 
national frontiers, depends on joint action on the part of 
the countries concerned. The improvement in the living 
conditions of particular groups, such as the Andean- 
Indian population in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, can be 
brought about more effectively through special regional 
projects. The Central American States have decided to 
promote their economic co-operation and to carry out a 
programme of economic integration, and experts are 
being provided, on a regional basis, to advise the States 
concerned. : 
National and international problems that call for 
technical assistance are on a vast, even an alarming 
scale. They will take years to work out satisfactorily. 
And, in the long run, the solutions will depend on the 
efforts of the people themselves. Many countries are 
now engaged in far-reaching development schemes of 
their own, but where technical assistance is applied 
properly, the process may be shortened in innumerable 
ways for more than half of the world’s people,

### 68272: The Human side of progress

  
TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE 
{Continued}      ‘THE HUMAN SIDE 
OF PROGRESS 
by Luther H. Evans 
Director-General of Unesco. 
ECHNICAL assistance to the so- 
called underdeveloped coun- 
tries has been referred to as 
“the great hope of the 20th cen- 
tury”. The initial enthusiasms, 
however, which characterized the 
launcaing of this great pro- 
gramme, whether in the form of 
bilateral or regional national 
agreements or through the United 
Nations and the Specialized 
Agencies, has been associated recently with an increasing 
concern with what such a programme does to the human 
beings and to the societies at the receiving end of 
Technical Assistance. 
Many people and many organizations have undertaken 
a reappraisal of both the goals and the methods of the 
“bold new programme,” drawing our attention to what 
has been called “the human cost of progress,” and raising 
the question of how this cost can be reduced or at least 
can be kept within reasonable limits. 
As we look back now on a good many years 
of collective experience in this field, we 
cannot fail to be struck by the errors we 
could have avoided and the time and energy 
we could have saved, if we had started out 
with an adequate knowledge of the culture 
into which an innovation was introduced. 
Too often we have assumed that if something 
was obviously good and acceptable to us, it 
would prove to be equally good and 
acceptable to others. 
A school for the training of nurses, for 
example, is set up in a particular region, and 
then it is discovered that the attitude 
toward nursing is such that “respectable” girls will not 
enrol; courses are instituted for instruction in agricul- 
tural techniques in a community where long-stand- 
ing tradition is opposed to the tilling of the soil, etc. 
These are perhaps extreme examples, but in varying de- 
grees we have proceeded without sufficient concern for 
the value systems of others. It was, I believe, George 
Bernard Shaw who suggested a revised version of the 
Golden Rule, which would read somewhat as follows: Do 
not unto others what you would have others do unto you. 
Their tastes may be different! 
It seems to me that a knowledge of motivations, 
particularly econoinic motivations, is primary and essen- 
tial. What makes people work ? What kinds of incentives 
‘will make them work harder, produce more ? What kinds 
of work do they like and why ? How do they rank the 
various occupations open to them ? 
These questions are not always easy to answer, even 
within a culture 'with which we are reasonably familiar. 
Interviews with Western workers indicate that their 
choice of occupation is by no means always determined by 
practical economic motives. Other factors such as 
pleasant companionship, working hours, attractive 
surroundings, prestige, and the feeling of accomplishment, 
  12   
may be much more powerful in many cases. When we 
compare different cultures the variations are even more 
striking. In some cases thes prestige motive is so strong 
as to override all others. 
In parts of Africa, for example, it is reported that an 
improvement in methods of breeding and caring for 
cattle has resulted not in bringing more cattle to market, 
but merely in the accretion of ever larger herds in order 
to prove one’s superiority over others. A knowledge of 
the nature and strength of such motivations may help us 
to predict the results of any change which we are plan- 
ning to introduce, and in that way pave the way ior more 
intelligent and effective action programmes. 
Economists and administrators in many parts of the 
world have become increasingly concerned with motiva- 
tions, and in some cases have even called in the survey 
expert to give them the necessary background informa- 
tion. To cite only one instance, the United States Gov- 
ernment during the last War arranged for a survey to 
be conducted on the factors which influenced Americans 
to buy War Bonds. The interviews showed 
a wide variety of motives to be operative, 
and a new War Bond campaign, based on 
this information, resulted in a definite 
increase im sales. There is no reason to 
believe that a knowledge of motivations in 
other societies and under other conditions 
should prove less fruitful. 
Our present concern is with motivations in 
connexion with change, technological change, 
The prevailing attitudes toward change 
represent an area in which we are in need of 
background data. Some cultural groups ac- 
cept change, almost any change, more 
readily than do others; all cultural groups 
are likely to accept change in some fields more readily 
than in others. Anthropologists have discussed this 
problem in some detail in connexion with the general 
phenomenon of acculturation or cultural contact, but here 
too their findings need to be supplemented by data 
referring to larger social units. 
Psychologists have conducted investigations of resist- 
ance to technological change, but almost exclusively in 
countries already highly industrialized; they have studied 
resistance to further changes among people accustomed 
to a complicated technology. We need to know more 
about resistance to technological change on the part of 
relatively unindustrialized com- 
munities—why there is resistance, 
under what conditions, to what 
extent, and to what kinds of 
change. This would be a fertile 
field for further investigations by 
social scientists which should 
yield the practical guidance 
which we require. 
In overcoming resistance to 
technological change there can 
be little doubt that a major role

influences. That is why we have always operated on the 
assumption of a close and intimate relation between 
UNESCO’s programme in the field of education—funda- 
mental education, primary and secondary schools, adult 
education, etc.—and the whole programme of Technical 
Assistance. The school has rightly been described as the 
connecting link between the old and the new culture. It 
provides new skills and techniques ; opens up new horizons 
of action; adds new values, and modifies pre-existing 
attitudes. Through children it influences the adults and 
therefore the community as a whole. Some concrete 
evidence of the influence of the schools is furnished by 
reports from Africa (by Meyer Fortes and Margaret Read) 
which indicate that a large proportion of the boys who 
attend school move to the cities to work for wages; it 
appears that there is a direct relation between the amount 
of schooling and the frequency of such migration. 
Danger of wasted skills 
T a more advanced level technical and university 
training, whether at home or abroad, is beginning 
to provide a group of leaders in many countries (the 
French refer to them as évolués) who play a special role 
as intermediaries between the old culture and the new. 
Sometimes they are in competition with traditional leader- 
ship ; sometimes they find themselves uprooted and 
insecure in their position. Frequently, however, they play 
an important role as interpreters of the new technology 
and as teachers of others in their community. Frequently 
too they develop a deep sense of their mission as inter- 
preters of the new way of life. We have been so im- 
pressed by the potential importance of this group that 
our Social Sciences Department is conducting a series of 
studies of actual and potential leaders in various regions 
of Africa, and we are now extending the investigation to 
include the role of feminine leaders. It is quite possible 
that women in such a position may prepare the way more 
easily than men for some kinds of technological change. 
We have all been reminded on many occasions of the 
difficulties and dangers inherent in the direct transplan- 
tation of an educational system developed in one area 
into another quite different cultural and economic 
context. Certainly the schools must serve the needs of 
the community, and be adapted to those needs. For this 
reason we have welcomed and co-operated in the creation 
in Brazil of a National Centre for Educational Research, 
which is directed towards this very end of reorganizing 
the Brazilian education system in order to make it fit 
the present conditions of Brazilian life, with all its local 
and regional variations. 
At the same time we venture to suggest that the schools

XJ SEHIL 
is played by the school, and by other, related, educational should be a step ahead of the surrounding culture ; they 
should be adapted to the situation which is coming rather 
than to the one which is here. This may entail certain 
hardships, at least for a time. Schools and universities 
may turn out Bantus or Egyptians or Brazilians with 
advanced training as technicians or teachers in numbers 
greater than can be absorbed by existing opportunities, 
and some of these will unfortunately find themselves in 
occupations far below the level for ‘which they are fitted. 
Their very existence may, however, lead the way to 
further progress and may help to bring on the next stage 
of technological ehange. There is a dilemma here, since 
no one ‘wishes to see training go to ‘waste, but it still seems 
to me that the schools have the special function of point- 
ing the way to further progress. 
It is difficult to over-emphasize the importance of the 
educational process in technological change, when we re- 
member that resources in raw materials go to waste if 
there are no adequate resources in trained personnel. 
Economists have recognized the fact that in assessing the 
real wealth of a community the range and extent of the 
skills possessed by its men and women are of the greatest 
importance. Whatever we can do to add to those skills 
represents a contribution of present or potential wealth. 
We in Unesco have recognized this fact by devoting a 
considerable proportion of our fellowships, in the Ex- 
change of Persons programme, to precisely this purpose of 
adding to the skills of nationals from relatively unin- 
dustrialized countries. 
All old ways ‘go west’ 
T is sometimes argued that technological change de- 
stroys indigenous cultures, that it replaces many diffe- 
rent traditional ways of life by one way—the Western 
way, that it will mean eventually the loss of all the rich- 
ness and variety which at present characterize the civili- 
zation or civilizations of the world. Since we in UNESCO, as 
well as in the United Nations family generally, profess 
respect for the values of all cultures, do ‘we not run the risk 
of endangering precisely those values by substituting for 
them those which inevitably accompany technological 
change? Should we not devote our skills to the preserva- 
tion of those cultures, rather than contributing, whether 
‘we wish it or not, to their eventual disappearance ? 
To these difficult questions I would prcpose the follow- 
ing answers. Of course we are interested in the preserva- 
tion of the cultural contributions of all peoples of the 
world. Within unesco we are working toward this end. 
We are doing what we can to make the world aware 
of the artistic and philosophical achievements of cultures 
with which most of us are not sufficiently familiar. We 
qa

  are committed to the belief in 
the value of cultural diversity. 
At the same time we must face 
the fact that in many parts of 
the world technological change 
is necessary for the improvement 
of living conditions, if not for 
survival: We must also face the fact that with the 
increase of contact and communication among the peoples 
of the world, technological change is inevitable. :We do 
not have the possibility of keeping each tribal culture fully 
intact on a kind of reservation. We have rather the alter- 
native between technological change which is haphazard 
and mechanical, and one which is based on a knowledge of 
pre-existing cultural values, and on a genuine desire to 
preserve them, as far as possible, in the new framework. 
This is not an impossible goal, but it is by no means 
easily achieved. A change in one aspect of the culture 
may have repercussions on other aspects : there are 
“chain effects” which have consequences far beyond those 
originally envisaged. 
TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE 
(Continued)     
One of our publications, prepared by the World Federa- 
tion for Mental Health under the editorship of Margaret 
Mead, deals precisely with this question of “Cultural 
Patterns and Technical Change,” and shows how under 
certain conditions technological change may be intro- 
duced in a manner to fit the prevailing culture. Professor 
Raymond Firth in his book on “Social Changes in the 
Western Pacific” shows the possibility of maintaining 
community solidarity in spite of the rapid economic chan- 
ges which have occurred. In any case there is no reason 
to assume that the arts must necessarily fly 
out of the window as soon as technological 
change darkens the door. ‘There are still 
some people who write poetry in London or 
New York, or paint their pictures in Paris 
or Sao Paulo—or Sydney and Melbourne! 
The second source of concern over techno- 
logical change is closely related to the first. 
The words “social implications” have some- 
times been used as if they necessarily 
referred to harmful consequences—increased 
disorganization, disruption of the normal 
lines ‘of authority, maladjustment, delin- 
quency and crime, mental disorder, etc. 
Since industrialization has usually meant 
also urbanization, there has been some tendency to blame 
these unhappy phenomena on the rapid growth of new 
cities, which draw off the surrounding rural populations 
into a situation where the old regulations no longer apply. 
Without the restraint of the mores and public opinion, 
the individual may find himself adrift without proper 
bearings, and antisocial behaviour may be a result. 
This may happen ; in fact, it has happened in many 
places. It should be pointed out, however, that in some 
cases the frequency of such behaviour has been-exaggerat- 
ed. A recent report by the International Research Office 
on the Social Implications of Technological Change in- 
dicates that the statistics for delinquency and crime 
sometimes give a wrong impression because the alleged 
misdemeanours may be explained by the temporary con- 
fiict between two sets of standards of behaviour, and not 
represent acts of far-reaching importance or consequence. 
More significant from our present standpoint is the fact 
that urbanization, even rapid urbanization, is not ne- 
cessarily accompanied by such 
phenomena. There are new 
African cities which show a great 
deal of crime and delinquency, 
and others that show very little. 
It would be most helpful if we 
could have detailed studies of 
such contrasts which would bring 
into relief the differentiating 
conditions in the two situations, 
and enable us to discover why 
things went wrong in one case 
    
and not in the other. We should 
look at both the sucessful and 
unsuccessful cases of adjustment 
to technological change in order 
to get a balanced picture. 
A few years ago, Mr. Nehru, 
speaking at a conference on 
community projects, pointed out 
that advice given from outside, 
even good advice, was not always 
welcome. 
“We have got into the habit” 
he said, “of doling out good advice to everybody, to the 
country, to our people... Obviously it is necessary to plan, 
to direct, to organize and to co-ordinate, but it is even 
more necessary to create conditions where spontaneous 
growth from below is possible and can take place.” 
The United Nations and the Specialized Agencies had a 
somewhat similar point in mind when they set up a very 
broad programme of community development with all its 
ramifications. It is when local communities themselves 
become identified with new techniques, aid in their de- 
velopment and application, take responsibility for their 
success, that the changes introduced have the best chance 
of being fully adapted to the local situation. Indeed, one 
might almost go so far as to say that the main criterion 
for the success of any project is the degree of involvement 
at the grass roots level ; the capacity of the people to 
carry it forward after outside assistance has ended. 
In connexion ‘with Western technology we have been 
hearing a great deal lately about “human relations in in- 
dustry,” which represents an attempt to take 
into account the personal or social relation- 
ships within a factory or other industrial 
enterprise in order to improve its function- 
ing. One of the aspects of this approach 
which seems to me to be most pertinent to 
our present discussion is the demonstration 
that it is much easier to have a new tech- 
nique adopted and successfully applied if the 
workers themselves have a voice in the 
decision, if they are consulted in advance 
instead of being presented with a fait accom- 
pli. It then becomes their decision, and 
they react accordingly. 
  
There is always danger in generalizing 
"from one cultural situation to another, but I venture to 
suggest that here we are on relatively safe ground. To 
the extent that a society adopts a new technique after 
consultation, it will be more likely, other things being 
equal, to see it through. When, as so often happens in 
the contacts between relatively untrained local workers 
and visiting experts, feelings of inferiority are developed 
by the discrepancy in skills, the workers may gain self- 
respect and dignity if the “human relations” aspects of 
their jobs are given due consideration. 
Human relations become complicated, in many situa- 
tions, by race relations. Here the position of uUNEsco 
and of the other United Nations agencies is clear and 
unequivocal ; there is no place in our Organizations for 
prejudice or discrimination. 
It is, however. possible that we have not always been 
successful in choosing for technical assistance missions 
or for other related assignments individuals who have 
been entirely free from such attitudes. It seems to me 
most important that the people we send to represent us 
in other cultures should have a wholesome respect for 
ways of life different from their own, should be able to 
forget distinctions of race, and to contribute by their own 
example to a better understanding between the peoples 
brought into intimate contact through the process of 
industrialization.

Evans to the Australian Library Association at Brisbane, on

Underground

1,750,000

by David Gunston 
URNED up by your fork in the garden, or lying 
T shrivelled and stranded on a pathway or 
road, a worm looks a helpless, insignificant 
enough creature. The everyday epithet “worm” 
seems well-chosen. Yet without him and his 
Kin, human civilization would not only be the 
poorer: it would be impossible, at least as we 
know it today. 
Earthworms are nature's own cultivators of 
the soil. Nothing lush can grow on rock or 
chalk or gravel. There must be a fertile topsoil 
in which to raise the world's crops. The solu- 
tion to the grave and little-realized world prob- 
lem of declining soil fertility may yet prove to 
lie with that widely-despised creature, the 
earthworm. 
By ceasless boring and tunnelling earthworms 
make and renew the vital layer of topsoil. They 
keep it friable, transform animal and vegetable 
waste, particularly dead leaves and plants, into 
rich humus. They turn natural minerals in the 
soil into soluble and easily assimilable plant food. 
They break up and aerate the earth, allowing 
rain to drain through. They bury stones and 
rubbish, scavenging and cleansing. In short, 
they are the first husbandmen, and still the most 
important, What is more, they live extraordi- 
narily long lives for such lowly animals—up to 
15 years if unmolested—and they never cease 
working, night or day. 
In an age that is speedily and terrifyingly 
losing its natural soil fertility through over- 
cropping, mis-management and erosion, it is 
high time to take stock of the worm’s true 
value. It can be said with some truth that after 
centuries of mild interest and little knowledge, 
the earthworm is at last coming to be ‘fully 
recognized as an important factor in human 
affairs. Ever since Aristotle there has 
been a good deal of legend about (Cont’d 
worms, but "little real information. on next

have been curious about them, but 
few recognized their rightful place in 
the scheme of things. 
Gilbert White, of Selborne, the 
English naturalist, had more than an 
inkling of the true status of the little 
wriggling creatures he watched in his 
eighteenth-century Hampshire gar- 
den, yet his plea for what he called 
“a good monograph of worms” was 
not to be answered ‘for something 
like a hundred years, until Charles 
Darwin published his great book, 
“The Formation of Vegetable Mould 
Through the Action of Earthworms, 
with Observations on Their Habits”, 
at the end of his life, in 1881. 
Darwin had studied earthworms all 
his life, beginning in his college days, 
45 years before, and he placed on 
record his conclusions about the 
power for world good that lay in 
its worm population. “Vegetable 
mould” was his name for fertile 
humus in the layers of topsoil, and, 
he stated: “Worms have played a 
more important part in the history 
of the world than most persons would 
at first suppose.” He found that 
“all the vegetable mould over the 
whole world has passed many times 
through, and will again pass many 
times through, the intestinal canals 
of worms”. So when Aristotle had 
spoken of worms as “the intestines of 
the earth”, he had not been far 
wrong. 
Much of Darwin’s book was found 
to be.true and helpful, but he was 
factually wrong on several matters, 
notably the numbers of worms in the 
soil. He estimated that arable land 
carries an average of some 53,000 to 
the acre, but recent research at the 
Rothamstead Experimental Station in 
England, have shown that even poor 
soil may support 250,000 worms to the 
acre, while rich fertile farmland may 
have up to 1,750,000. 
More important still, recent work 
tends to accept the conclusion that 
the only way to restore soil ferti- 
lity before it is too late is to em- 
16 
ploy earthworms. 
them, in fact, mankind may yet save 
its future food supplies. It is impera- 
tive to restore immediate {fertility 
to the earth’s soil for maximum food 
production. Normally, earthworms 
would do this anyway, but such is the 
rate of cropping nowadays, that 
they would require 500 to 1,000 years 
for the task. Under artificially 
controlled conditions, provided- other 
circumstances were favourable, a 
vast regulated “task force” of spe- 
cially-bred earthworms might be able 
to do the job within 5 or 10 years. 
Methods of cross-breeding worms 
have been devised to produce the 
most suitable types for use in farm- 
ing, and various techniques for 
raising large numbers of healthy, 
active worms in a limited space 
under cover have already been per- 
fected. The present trend, although 
still in the experimental stage, is 
towards the setting-up of *“earth- 
worm farms”, where vast stocks of 
worms can be raised in beds of 
humus. These are in commercial 
production in U.S.A. and Canada, 
whilst amateur enthusiasts in Britain 
and other lands are breeding their 
own stocks from specially selected 
strains in gardens and holdings. 
Greedy soil swallower 
Nn all cases, the emphasis is on 
worm topsoil—the predigested, 
-pulverised humus after it has 
. passed through an earthworm’s di- 
gestive organs. Scientific analyses 
have shown that this topsecil happens 
to be the richest medium in the world 
for growing things in. It normally

Research work can of course only be 
based upon a prolonged and detailed 
study of the worms themselves, 
What sort of a creature is an 
earthworm ? Pick up a garden worm 
and examine it closely, and you 
will see that it consists of a closely- 
linked series of rings. There may 
be anything from 100 to 400 of these, 
according to the size and kind of the 
worm, and they form a muscular 
chain from the elongated head 
(without eyes, nose or ears), to the 
tapering tail. For its size, one of 
the strongest creatures on earth, the 
worm is tough, flexible, wiry and 
perfectly streamlined for its burrow- 
ing existence underground. A spe- 
cimen weighing, less than one- 
thirtieth of an ounce can shift a 
stone weighing two ounces, or over 
sixty times its own weight. 
By its very nature, a worm is 
little more than a digestive organism, 
perpetually feeding. Everything in 
a worm’s design is subserviated to 
the endless processes of the alimen- 
tary canal which runs the length of 
its elastic body. Blind and impe- 
tuous, questing and tireless, the 
  
   
worm seeks and disposes of food 
without pause, It is endowed with 
sufficient instinctive intelligence to 
enable it to exist, satisfactorily wher- 
ever it happens to find itself. 
If you run a finger along a worm’s 
body from tail to head, it feels rough. 
It is not the smooth creature you 
might expect. This roughness is 
caused by tiny clusters. of erectile 
bristles set at intervals along its 
length. With these, and a self- 
secreted slimy lubricating mucus, the 
worm is able to burrow through all 
types of soil—sandy, rocky, heavy or 
waterlogged. Cut a hapless worm 
in two with your spade, and the 
head end will usually grow a new 
tail and live, but never vice-versa. 
From the creature’s own point of 
view its most important feature is 
its oval mouth, which is protected 
by a long, overhanging lip. As it 
tunnels its way along, this helps to 
push aside most of the soil, while 
the rest is swallowed greedily, 
passing straight into a bird-like crop 
in the neck, where minute fragments

of grit grind everything down into a 
fine, moist paste. Leaves, grass, roots, 
stems, rubbish—all are reduced to a 
smooth residue, which is then 
swiftly digested in the threadlike 
stomach, the worm extracting its own 
nourishment from the bacteria in the 
soil. Stones up to one-twentieth 
of an inch across are swallowed and 
incorporated in the gizzard, larger 
ones are eaten around and thus 
started on their slow sinking pro- 
cess which is finally completed by the 
depositing of layers of worms-casts 
on the surface. 
Bracing its body for the effort, and 
anchoring itself by its tail under- 
ground, a worm can grasp and pull 
down beneath the surface quite large 
fragments of rotting vegetation and 
animal matter—all the dead and 
dying refuse that litters the earth. 
Tougher ood is first coated with a 
kind of saliva to aid the digestive 
processes. In Britain it has been 
estimated that three inches of com- 
pletely new topsoil from worm- 
castings or excrement is deposited 
every fifteen years or so, and the 
same is probably true of most lands.

Where the native earthworm popula- 
tion can be artificially increased, of 
course, the rate of this vital work 
can be stepped up. 
Although blind, worms are sensitive 
to light, and feed mostly at night, 
rising to the surface after dusk and 
burying themselves again before day- 
break. There are in fact a number 
of different species of worms, includ- 
ing the brandling, found in manure- 
heaps and beloved of anglers for bait, 
and the four-foot monsters which 
gurgle their way into the squelchy 
forest mud of parts of Australia. 
Worms are found all over the globe, 
except where it is too hot and dry 
for them to exist, as in parched 
deserts, but even in hot lands they 
teem by the rivers and lakes. As 
these untold myriads never rest or 
hibernate, but dig and tunnel maybe 
for years, constantly yielding this 
incredibly fertile layer of cast soil, it 
is small wonder that the earth has 
been rich for so long. 
So the vision of the lowly earth- 
worm as the Key to the world’s 
deepest problem—that of unfailing 
food suplies for an ever-increasing 
population-—may not prove to be as 
fantastic as it first sounds. Cer- 
tainly nature is co-operative in the 
way that these creatures respond to 
artificial rearing. 
When two meet, they clasp toge- 
ther in a strange, slimy embrace, 
overlapping one another to about 
one-third of their lengths, heads 
facing opposite ‘ways, and locked 
together for all the world like a 
Turk’s head knot. Thus, each ferti- 
lizes the other’s eggs, and these are 
then passed over the body in a tube 
which is eventually cast off in the 
form of a yellow, lemon-shaped 
cocoon. Each cocoon may contain 
up to 20-odd tiny eggs, which hatch 
out into minute, white, thread-like 
worms in about ten days. But if 
these cocoons are dried out, or kept 
in a refrigerator, they may be pre- 
served for as long as eighteen 
months, and may thus be sent all 
over the world. Once placed in the 
right conditions for hatching, the 
eggs then yield healthy young worms 
after the usual incubation period. 
As all worms are male and female 
in one body, only a single cocoon-full 
of eggs is needed to start up a colony. 
Worm harnessing crusade 
HE leading figure in the Ameri- 
T can worm-harnessing movement 
is a bespectacled physiothera- 
pist, Dr. Thomas J. Barrett, who first 
became interested in worms when in 
France in 1918. Noticing an aged 
French peasant carefully sweeping up 
some loose soil by a damp well near 
the Argonne Forest, quite oblivious of 
nearby gunfire, he asked him why 
this particular earth should be so 
precious. “Le Bon Dieu knows how 
to build good earth and He has given 
‘The Unesca Courier, — February 1956 
the secret to the earthworms”, the 
old man replied. Barrett was much 
impressed, and began a long study o? 
the subject which convinced him of 
the potential value of these creatures. 
Eighteen years later, his business 
a failure, and his assets only $9, he 
decided to stake his future on 
earth-worms and to press for their 
scientific culture. In a few years he 
had turned a barren Californian hill- 
side into a lush paradise of a garden, 
full of outsize vegetables, fruit, 
flowers and shrubs—all thanks to the 
rich cast-soil in which he had grown 
them. He figured that a horse could 
do only a limited amount of 
ploughing, and then only on suitable 
terrain, yet a million worms roughly 
equal a horse in weight, are in the 
aggregate much stronger and more 
enduring, need only waste matter 
and the existing soil for food, yet 
deposit 100 tons of topsoil to the acre 
every year without fail. His faith 
was justified, and he now breeds 
worms for sale in a dozen countries, 
and leads the campaign, supported 
by a growing body of disciples, not 
for more soii under cultivation, but 
for more worm soil in existing arable 
areas. 
“Crowded on the face of the earth 
are over two thousand million peo- 
ple”, says Barrett, “depending on the 
topsoil for food. There are on the 
earth approximately four thousand 
million acres of cultivable land—two 
acres per person. We barely feed 
ourselves and our topsoil is dwindling, 
It is time we harnessed the earth- 
worm to rebuild it.” 
It would indeed be remarkable if 
man finally recognized the worm’s 
good turn to humanity by working 
with him, cultivating him instead of 
continually impoverishing the soil, 
and relying upon nature to do the 
rest. Remarkable, but by now means 
impossible.

The Unesco Courier. — February 1956 
n these and the following pages the 
Unesco Courier presents a selection 
of photographs from a remarkable exhi- 
bition which drew 300,000 visitors to the 
New York Museum of Modern Art last 
year. Created by Edward Steichen, Head 
of the Museum's Department of Photo- 
graphy, “The Family of Man” Exhibition 
is composed of 503 photographs selected 
from a total of two million from 68 
countries. It has begun a round-the- 
world tour and is at present in the Paris 
Musée d’Art Moderne. The message of 
this “vast photographic symphony” has 
been summed up by André Maurois in 
these words: “We all know—or at least 
we. should—that between all men there 
exists a great depth of similarity. This_ 
similarity ought to engender universal 
kinship and help men toward 2n under- 
standing and love of one another. aut 
preachers of hatred are at work to make 
us forget these similarities. Hence the 
scorn, the resentments, the brutal revolts 
and wars. That is why it is necessary, 
even imperative that the unity of the 
human family should be revealed to the 
sceptics, That is why this group of pho- 
tographs is both useful and moving and 
not merely beautiful and interesting.”

he spils out the word “nigger” or who has fell the 
deep contempl in a Negro’s voice as he refers to 
“white trash”, can have any doubt aboul the emotional 
conlent of such terms. True, when the English child 
learns the nursery rhyme about the “Ten Little Nigger 
Boys” who sat down to dine, the word “nigger” is used 
in a warm, friendly way; but words have an emotive 
power for the recipient as well as for the dispenser, and 
many Negroes rise in resentment at what they imagine to 
be racial prejudice. Similarly, although the word, “Ne- 
gress” may be used in its simple descriptive sense, wilh- 
out any offensive intent, it may nevertheless carry 
objectionable connotations of the days when plantation 
owners took female slaves as concubines. 
To take another example, the words “Jew” and 
“Jewess” are in essence simply classificatory terms, no 
more objectionable than “author” 
and “authoress”; yet, so sensitive to 
possibilities of antisemitic prejudice 
have some individuals become, they 
N° one who has ever seen a while man’s lip curl as 
a woman) of the Hebrew faith” to 
avoid the risk of giving offence. 
Just as, in poetry, certain words 
have not only a surface insignifi- 
cance, but also a rich emotional 
content which gives them layer 
upon layer of meaning, so many 
words relating to race have complex 
associations which introduce thick 
incrustations of prejudice. And, if 
the child is to learn to use his 
native language really well, he must 
hecome fully aware of this complex 
quality of words. 
Take the adjectives “black”, 
“brown”, “yellow”, and “white”. 
Applied to painls or fabrics, they 
are simple descriptive words im- 
plying nothing beyond the facis of 
colour difference. 
But use them in the phrases 
“black race”, “brown race”, “ycl- 
low race”, and “while race”—and 
how subtly the adjectives imply grades of merit 
and demerit! Usually unrecognized on the conscious 
level, but often a polent catalyst of emotion, “while” now 
becomes set apart from the other three colour adjectives, 
and carries with it an idea of basic cleanness which 
“black” and “brown” and “yellow” do not share. Then 
there is white as the symbol of purity and virginity, and 
there is white as “not-coloured” while black and brown 
and yellow are “coloured”. This last implication, 
indeed, commonly becomes quite explicit, as when “co- 
loured” is used as a synonym or euphemism for “Negro”. 
This complex emotional content of the word “white” 
would become apparent to children of European origin 
if, for a period, they and their teacher deliberately used 
the rather more appropriate adjective “pink” in class- 
room discussion of ethnic differences. The sense of 
superiority which comes to many people when they think 
of themselves as white rather than brown disappears 
when they think of themselves as pink, and the thrill of 
horror which is aroused in some by the idea of inter- 
marriage between black and white does not arise in the 
same way at the thought of the mingling of black and 
pink. 
This word “mingling”, too is richly emotive in the 
context of race. “Mingling”, or “mixture”, is often 
expressive of adulteration or impurity: there is the 
dishonest dairyman mixing water with his milk, there is 
the appalling consequence of sewage becoming mingled 
with drinking water. Not in any conscious or verbalized 
way do thesc ideas normally arise; they are more likely

Unesco recently asked sociologists and 
educators from different countries to 
discuss these problems and to suggest 
ways of fostering education in race and 
inter-group relations. To help teachers 
and to enlist their aid in its campaign 
against racial discrimination, Unesco is 
to publish two handbooks giving facts of the teacher of language to 
about race and suggesting ways these can 
be introduced into history, geography, 
biology, religion and other subjects. In 
this article, Dr. Cyril Bibby of the Univer- 
sity of London Institute of Education, 
author of one of the Unesco handbooks, 
points out how, when they are used in a 
certain way, words can breed misunder- 
standing and hostility in racial matters.

### 68279: The Power of words

The power of words 
by Cyril Bibby 
to be deep down in the semantic structure -of the 
language. This is why, by many people, a “pure” Negro 
or a “pure” European or a “pure” Indian are regarded 
with equal respect, but a person of “mixed blood” is 
viewed with something approaching loathing. For the 
phrase “mixed blood” carries with it not only the emo- 
tive implications of “mixed” but ‘also the exiremely 
powerful surcharging of the word “blood”. 
One speaks of one’s child as being “of my own blood”; 
there is the common saying “blood is thicker than waler”; 
the closest ties of comradeship are those between “blood 
brothers”; there are the metaphors of “blue blood”, 
“plebeian blood” and “new blood”; an oralor may arouse 
high passion by talk of “British blood” or “Russian blood” 
or “American blood”. Blood is the very life-stream and 
its mythology is rich and varied. Similarly, the words 
“half-caste” (with its implication on the one hand of 
something less-than-complete and 
on the other hand of something to 
be ranked in a scale of social value) 
and “mulatto” (with its foreign- 
sounding form, in its first syllable 
faintly reminiscent of the hybrid 
progeny of the horse and ass, and 
in its ending evoking memories of 
the sinister stiletto) often carry con- 
notations far more complex than is 
usually recognized. 
While it is primarily for the bio- 
logy teacher to provide children 
with the basic factual knowledge 
about genes, it is essentially the task 
sharpen his pupils’ awareness of 
the ways in which words may carry 
complex intimations of meaning. 
To recognize the existence of ir- 
rational feelings is often the first 
step to liberating oneself from them, 
and the teacher can contribute a 
good deal to the emotional eman- 
cipation of his pupils by helping 
them to understand how it is that 
certain words and phrases come to 
arouse feelings of this kind. 
It is, however, not only in the language or literature 
lesson that opportunities arise to help children to cope 
with the complex emotional content of words. The bio- 
logy lesson, for example, may present a suitable occasion 
to isolate the proper meaning of “pure-bred”, as a gene- 
tically descriptive term, from the implication of virtue and 
superiority, which often attach to the term. In almost any 
subject of the curriculum, the enormous emotive power of 
the word “blood” may make itself felt, and care can be 
taken that this power does not, as it may very easily do, 
carry over into the children’s attitudes to race relations. 
So with the very word “raced” itself. Passing into 
general usage in its present sense after Buffon gave it the 
scal of his approval in 1749, the word had earlier been 
used in the sense of “the human race”, and in the sense of 
the posterity of a person, as in the phrase “the race of 
Abraham”. And, subtly still today, the word carries with 
it something of this complex connotation, so that on the 
one hand the members of another “race” are not quite 
human and on the other hand they are not quite of one’s 
own kith-and-kin. And, as a result, many a man who is 
well aware of the scientific facts about race is nevertheless 
unable to cast off completely his irrational feelings about 
it. He is, indeed, in much the same position as was 
Madame de Staél, who is reported to have said: “I do not 
believe in ghosts, but I am afraid of them”. We must 
help children to pass beyond the stage of abandoning fal- 
lacious beliefs, and to progress into the stage of getling 
rid also of irrational fears.

Roxas REVIVERS: Spe- 
cialists who will help to improve 
the health, housing, farming 
and nutrition standards of 
Korean villages are to be 
trained in a national funda- 
mental education centre now 
being set up at Suwon by the 
U.N. Korean Reconstruction 
Agency (UNKRA) in co-opera- 
. tion with the Korean Govern=- 
ment and with aid from uNEsco, 
which is providing $80,000 for 
staff services during the first 
two years of operation. The 
centre will offer a one-year 
course for 48 men and 12 wom- 
en students. Its: Director is 
Howard Hayden, of the United 
Kingdom and for the first two 
years it will be staffed by six 
international specialists and six 
Korean experts who will even- 
tually take over the work. Stu- 
dents will be given practical 
experience in local “laboratory” 
villages, while learning latest 
methods of literacy teaching 
and how to develop rural crafts 
and cottage industries to pro- 
vide new sources of income. 
MM BRAZIL SCHOOL BOOM: 
Enrolments in Brazil's se- 
condary schools have tripled 
during the past 15 years, re- 
ports the International Bu- 
reau of Education. Secondary 
schools increased from 821 to 
2,485 and the total of boys 
and girls attending them 
rose from 170,057 in 1940 to 
535,755 in 1954, The average 
increase of 26,000 pupils per 
year was five times that of 
the overall population in- 
crease during the same pe- 
riod. 
Woren CAMPAIGN 
FOR MUSEUMS : The many 
roles played by museums in the 
life of the community will be 
highlighted this year in a world- 
wide campaign organized by 
UNESCO. Member States of 
UNESCO are preparing special 
exhibits and features of particu- 
larly interesting collections will 
be publicized by newpapers 
and radio stations. The cam- 
paign alms to bring home the 
public education role of mu- 
seums and also their contribu- 
tion to international under- 
standing. UNESCO is organizing 
an international art competition 
for children aged between six 
and 16. who will be asked to de- 
pict their impressions after visit- 
ing a museum. A selection of 
the best drawings will be ex- 
hibited in Paris, in Switzerland 
and in New Delhi at UNEscoO’s 
Ninth General Conference later 
in the year.

B® ORIGIN OF ALL LIFE: 
An international group of 
biologists met in Paris re- 
cently to plan greater deve- 
lopment of a vital field of 
scientific research — normal 
and abnormal cell growth. 
Problems of cell growth, 
multiplication and differen- 
tiation are at the origin of 
all forms of life. While the 
research programme under 
consideration is concerned 
only with the fundamental 
processes of the cell, the re- 
search may also shed light 
on certain abnormalities 
such as cancer. Specialists 
from research 
nine countries were invited 
to the meeting, organized by 
the Council for International 
Organizations of Medical 
Sciences, at the request of 
UNESCO. 
Porycror MEXI- 
CANS : A recent education 
study in Mexico showed that 
42 % of the country’s secondary 
school pupils can speak a for- 
eign language, usually English. 
Knowledge of foreign languages 
is also well-developed in the 
secondary schools of two other 
Latin American countries—Cuba 
and the Republic of Panama. 
This interest in the study of 
foreign languages is largely ex- 
plained by the development of 
commercial, technical and tour- 
ist relations in this part of the 
world. 
BM JUST GIVE US THE 
FACTS: Four ways for im- 
proving the quality and flow 
of information about and 
between different countries 
were suggested in Paris 
recently by directors of 
national cultural relations 
services meeting for the first 
time. . They proposed the 
production of special works 
on different countries for 
the use of secondary school 
teachers, the distribution of 
more documentary films and 
audo-visual materials, Spe- 
cigl training for journalists 
and the setting up of a per- 
manent exhibition of publi- 
cations on national cultures 
at UNESCO's headquarters. 
ScveENTH DAY DMIS- 
SIONS: For the past eighteen 
months, mission teams of Mexi- 
can university undergraduates 
have been carrying out public 
education campaigns in the 
small towns and villages of the 
states of Tlaxcala, Publa and 
Mexico. The students chose 
Sunday as their “mission” day - 
so as not to interfere with their 
studies. Through their efforts

FREEING BOOKS, ART AND 
MUSIC AT THE FRONTIERS 
proposal that tariffs on educational, scientific and cultural 
A materials should be reduced has been made by UNESCO to 
the 35 countries which are parties to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) whose Tariff Negotiating Canference 
opened in Geneva, Switzerlend, on January 18, 1956. At the same 
time as it made the proposal, UNESCO brought out a new revised 
edition of “Trade Barriers ta Knowledge” which gives a detailed 
picture of the customs duties, import and export regulations, sales 
taxes and exchange controls, covering books, newspapers, works 
of art, music, radio and TV sets, scientific instruments and other 
The new manual covers 91 countries and 
territories, as against 43 surveyed in the first edition, and deals 
It reveals a striking reduction in 
customs duties, but olso shows to what extent the flow of knowledge 
is still limited by trade barriers. 
directly from the application of the UNESCO Agreement on the 
Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials which 
is now operated by 21 countries, 
ratification of this agreement is Greece. 
Many concessions gained result 
The latest country to announce   
five libraries have been opened, 
hygiene committees formed and 
about 150 educational films 
have been screened. Much of 
their educational work is car- 
ried out with the help of plays, 
dances and music, 
MH STUDY CAMP ON 
WHEELS: Boys from a 
Stockholm secondary school 
went on an unusual study 
tour of southern Sweden last 
year in a special train com- 
plete with bedrooms, study 
rooms and a van for storing 
bicycles used in “off the 
train” operations. At select- 
ed spots they left the train 
to explore the region, visit- 
ing museums and historic 
monuments and making no- 
tes on plants and wild ani- 
mals they saw in the coun« 
tryside. They spent each 
afternoon in their mobile 
classrooms writing up ac- 
counts of their visits. 
Cae VIENNA B.21.2.63 : 
A telephone call to Vienna B.21. 
2.63 now solves any foreign vi- 
sitor’s problems on what places 
to visit in the Austrian capital. 
At the other end of the line is 
the “University Service of 
Tourist Guides” which promptly 
sends off one of its 150 student 
guides who are selected for their 
knowledge of languages, history 
and art. Young guides must 
possess a wealth of general 
knowledge about their city be- 
fore they are accepted. 
MM IS THERE A DOCTOR?: 
There are now 1,200,000 
physicians practicing in the 
world, and on an average, 
55,000 new doctors graduate 
annually from 595 medical 
schools operating in 85 coun- 
tries according to figures re- 
cently published by the 
World Health Organization, 
It seems as though there are 
plenty of doctors in the 
world until the total is com- 
pared with the world popul- 
ation of 2,500 million. While 
in 14 countries one doctor 
may serve a thousand or few- 
er people, in 22 others there 
is only one doctor for 20,000 
or more inhabitants. More- 
over, many are engaged in 
teaching, research, adminis- 
tration and- other duties. 
D AYS TO REMEMBER: 
School children in Utrecht, Hol- 
land, chose two important anni- 
versaries—U.N. Day and Human 
Rights Day—for opening and 
closing their recent unesco gift 
coupon campaign to help the 
educational institute of the Sri 
Ramakrishna social service mis- 
sion at Vidialaya, Madras, In- 
dia. The children began their 
campaign by selling gift cou- 
pons at a unesco stall in their 
city’s Central Station Square, 
on U.N. Day (October 24). By 
the time they closed it at a 
gala evening to celebrate Human 
Rights Day, in Utrecht’s Rem- 
brandt Theatre on December 10, 
they had sold 13,200 gift cou- 
pons, thus raising nearly $1,000 
for the Indian mission.
