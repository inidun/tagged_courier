### 49634: The Eskimos: a people that refuses to disappear

THE ESKIMOS 
A people 
that refuses 
to disappear 
This issue of the “Unesco Courier” is devoted to the human rights of the 
Eskimos .and the uphill struggle they are waging so as not to vanish as a 
A Co people. For 2,000 years the Eskimos have lived a nomadic life in the vast 
Arctic regions. Today the impact of modern civilization and economic 
development is threatening to destroy their culture, way of life, language, 
and the traditional structure of their society. At its recent General Con- 
ference (October-November 1974), Unesco decided to co-ordinate a pro- 
gramme of Arctic studies to be carried out by experts from various coun- 
delhata + tries and regions such as Canada, the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R.. and Northern 
Europe. The programme will take into account “the cultural cohesion 
of a vast region whose peoples and values... are still largely unknown to 
the general public”. 
  human rights 
inthe 
Far North 
The article published below presents some of the highlights of a recent 
symposium on economic development in the Arctic and the future of 
Eskimo societies. The symposium was held under the chairmanship of 
Dr Jean Malaurie at an international congress organized by the Foundation 
of Nordic Studies in France (1). The President of the International Institute 
of Human Rights, Nobel Peace Prizewinner René Cassin, pointed out at 
the symposium that “for the first time in their history, the Eskimos 
themselves—from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia—[had] been

We have got into the habit of 
Jacques judging everything from the West- 
: ern viewpoint. History has always 
‘ROUSSEAU been written by whites and for 
(Canada) whites. We usually talk about the 
formerly of the Europeans discovering Canada. 
Centre of .1 am about to publish a history of 
Canada in which it is the Indians 
who discover the French and the 
"English. We have to try to take in 
both points of view; the natives are 
human beings like ourselves and 
like the whites they change and 
will continue to change. 
My European ancestors—French and English—entered 
into an undertaking with my Amerindian ancestors—I| must 
admit | am quite a mixture—to respect their rights, to make 
life easier for them and to help them to develop. 
The whites settled in Canada with their own legal system, 
their own laws, and from the very outset there was this 
failure of comprehension which still prevails in the Far 
North. Outsiders move in and take over the land, which 
belongs in fact if not by law to group, tribe or community. 
The concept of private property does not exist among 
the natives, only that of communal ownership. | have 
avoided using the term ; collective ownership” because the 
situation is not quite the ‘same as in a country like the Soviet

Laval University,

(now deceased)      
able to meet and discuss problems of common concern.” 
Union, for instance, where a system of collective ownership 
prevails. Ownership is not individual but concerns the 
community, and when the individual ceases to be part of 
the community or leaves it, so his participation in communal 
ownership ceases as well. 
Should these natives have a system of ownership 
modelled on the white man's system? | myself do not 
think they should. They should be allowed the right of 
communal ownership to start with, so that they can organize 
their own affairs as they see fit on their own territory. 
The natives’ ownership should therefore extend not only 
to the little area in which they live but to all the land which 
provides their only livelihood. The influx of whites from 
the south into the Far North is now happening on a scale 
which is gradually becoming a matter for concern. In 
certain cases, these new arrivals are being granted exclusive 
hunting and fishing rights on the very lands where the 
natives depend on hunting and fishing .for their livelihood. 
This is an intolerable situation. -

It seems obvious that the legal 
situation concerning property rights 
is different in each of the countries 
with an Eskimo population. Green- 
land is an extreme case in this 
respect, with its legislation for- 
bidding private ownership of the 
land occupied by private individuals. 
The same applies in the Soviet 
Union, while we in Canada and 
the United States have very 
different legislation. 
Some Eskimo groups do have 
land, the reservations administered 
by the Federal Government of the 
United States. If the whole terri- 
tory was made up of reservations 
under the trusteeship of the Federal 
Government, the Eskimos would get 
the benefit from the minerals that 
may be there or may subsequently 
be discovered. Unfortunately, most 
Eskimos have no land which is the 
property of the village or held 
under trusteeship as in the case of 
the reservations. As things stand at 
present, villagers cannot work either in the mines or the 
oil producing installations on their territories. 
The native population does not, in fact, regard compen- 
sation as the ideal solution, particularly cash compensation, 
which in many cases seems the easiest and quickest way 
of dealing with Eskimo and Indian groups. They are given 
money in the hope that this will divert their attention from 
their real interests, but the Eskimos and Indians are fully 
aware that Congress has never yet passed any bill actually 
abolishing their right of ownership. 
We have set up a number of regional organizations in 
Alaska grouping several communities together, such as the

associations for natives living in the mining region of 
Alaska, in the northwest, etc. There are in fact local 
organizations of this kind covering the whole State now. 
As a result of political pressure by these groups and 
of intervention by the Secretary of the Interior, one measure 
has been adopted which is entirely to our satisfaction, an 
order ““freezing” further acquisition of land either by the 
state or by private individuals. 
In any case, the natives who are pressing for a speedy 
settlement of this problem do not regard this as an 
exorbitant demand. They have certainly no intention of 
partitioning the state or stirring up trouble. Considering 
the living conditions in the villages, we do not think there 
is anything which runs contrary to the interests of the 
Federal Government and the State in our claim that the 
resources of “our country” should be placed at the disposal 
of the natives so that they can provide for their own 
economic development in full freedom of action. 
  
| should like to ask you to make 
Jean a leap in space that would take us 
MALAURIE into those Eskimo communities 
where hunting is still the main 
(France) occupation. 
Director, Centre Let us put ourselves in the pos-

300 to 500 persons, isolated in 
the Far North, impoverished and 
anxious about their future. They 
owe their survival and their conti- 
nuity solely to their intelligence, 
their sense of organization and, in 
the last three generations, to our 
pricing policies. Proud of having shrewdly overcome 
the rigours of the climate over the centuries, they feel, 
whatever others might think, that these now-coveted ter- 
ritories, frozen and snowbound, are theirs by absolute right. 
But what kind of future can there be for hunting com- 
munities in this day and age? We know it will depend 
largely on the practical measures that local authorities 
and governments will take, 
     
  
As far as Greenland is concerned, 
Claus some reports give the impression 
BORNEMANN that it is official policy to remove 
hunters from their areas and transfer 
(Denmark) them into cities. This is incorrect, 
Head of the although in the fishing districts,

Greenland, But in the hunting districts the 
Copenhagen government would like to see the 
scattered settlements maintained, 
especially in areas where seals 
abound. The authorities try to     
 encourage this by granting housing 
loans to small communities and setting up building enter- 
prises in these areas. Hunters are also given loans for 
the purchase of motor-boats. 
In the schools children who will one day be hunters 
receive some instruction in hunting. But 1 agree that 
schools in hunting districts are providing above all a formal, 
not a practical, education. 
| should like to know whether scientists can carry out 
an enquiry to determine in realistic terms whether a district 
is overpopulated or not. | should also like to know if 
biologists have assessed the possibilities and the cost of 
subsidizing hunting. 
Some reports | have read claim that an archaic society 
which comes in contact with industrial civilization is 
inevitably doomed. What are the grounds for saying so? 
Does this mean that hunting as a modern industry is 
doomed? 
| go along with Mr. Malaurie when he says that school 
is the key factor in hunting communities for | feel that, 
whatever the school, its impact will be negative. Shouldn't 
people be told and taught about what is happening in the 
modern world? | think hunting is a very tough way of 
making a living, and even if many Eskimos enjoy it, the 
younger ones who have been through school will probably, 
sooner or later, want to get out of these places where the 
only prospect is hunting.

Mr. Bornemann asked whether 
surveys have been made to find out 
how far these hunting districts 
could meet the population's require- 
ments. | can tell you such studies 
have been carried out in Northern 
Canada and that they have shown 
that the resources are barely 
sufficient to meet the present 
population's needs, and hence, will 
be even more deficient, in relation 
to the needs of the future popu- 
lation. 
Arthur B. 
YATES 
     Mr. Bornemann’s second point 
raised the question of setting up schools for hunters. 
That's another problem with which we in Canada are greatly 
concerned. Most of the Eskimos do want hunting tech- 
niques to be incorporated in school programmes; but that's 
a tricky thing to arrange, because of the difficulty of 
obtaining teachers capable of giving that sort of technical 
instruction and the problem of limited budgets. 
  
Whether we like it or not, there'll 
always be hunting, though admit- 
tedly it may now be declining. 
This is bound to happen with the 
appearance of synthetic and ranch- 
bred furs. Fur-farming is a prof- 
itable business and a white mono- 
poly today, though 1 don’t see why 
the north's traditional hunters 
should. not take it up themselves! 
The north produces luxury furs; 
if fur-farming caught on in the 
Jacques 
ROUSSEAU 
    north, the native peoples would 
 put a luxury fur on the market. In 
fact, fur-farming must be treated as an extension of hunting, 
though fur-bearing animals will continue to be hunted, even 
if only by a minority. 
There is no magic solution for the American Indians any 
more than there is for the white man. No territory can 
survive by marketing a single product. 
There are all kinds of stock-farming. | should like to 
show you an example of what may be done with the 
musk-ox. Here's a sweater made of musk-ox wool; it's 
the first ever of its kind made in the Province of Quebec. 
‘I's a very light wool, a half or a third as light as sheep's 
wool. This sweater is made of thick-knit wool, but this 
same wool can be used to produce a cashmere as fine 
as any in the world. 
Alaska already has a musk-ox wool industry, and Quebec 
is shortly to have one too; it is a highly profitable product.

for Northern 
    future of proposals for breeding

for Canada’s northern districts, then in Alaska and now 
in New Quebec. Such ideas are to my mind more 
glamorous than practical or economically feasible. There 
was talk a number of years ago about raising certain 
varieties of sheep in the north; all kinds of uses were 
to be made of them, and in the most unexpected places. 
The author of one study had worked for some time in 
Iceland and in southern Greenland. The concepts were 
attractive enough but do not stand up in the face of actual 
conditions. There is a long-established sheep raising

industry in southern Greenland, but extending it has proved 
quite impossible. There were some catastrophic failures. 
Even were some of the plans to prove practicable on a 
limited scale, they could only have minimal effect on the 
daily lives of the Greenlanders—even as sources of food. 
We are agreed that every effort must be made to protect 
the traditional life-style of those who wish to continue 
in it. But today many Eskimo children in Canada are 
going to high school. Let us hope they go on to higher 
education later. It would be absurd to expect these young 
people on leaving school to be able to earn a living from 
traditional Eskimo occupations of their grandfathers. 
  
The Alaskan Eskimos have had to 
adapt to a variety of trades to sur- 
vive, for it is not possible to live 
entirely off hunting and fishing. 
Additional activities must therefore 
be found, and the Eskimos must 
learn other skills. 
To understand the problems of 
the Alaskan Eskimos, as distinct 
from those of the Greenland or 
Canadian Eskimos, Alaska's geogra- 
phy must be taken into consider- 
ation. Most of the Eskimos live 
in some 200 villages scattered 
throughout the western and eastern parts of the State and

located fairly close to heavily populated urban centres. 
This is not the case in Canada and Greenland. 
Even if men are working at various trades, either in their 
own villages, or in larger urban centres and in cities, they 
must not give up hunting, for they love it. Even those who 
work in new industries like petroleum, when they return to 
their villages after spending three weeks or so in an oil- 
drilling camp, can indulge in a fortnight of hunting and 
fishing. 
There is still plenty of game in Alaska, even though the 
question today is what proportion of the population can live 
off it. | know that in the past—before the white man settled 
down in Alaska—there was a big wildlife population. White 
civilization has resulted in urban centres springing up 
around schools and churches and has had repercussions 
on the state's basic ecological resources, 
We still have sleds drawn by huskies, but tracked power 
sleds are beginning to supplant them nearly everywhere. 
And so we must ask ourselves whether the Eskimo who Is 
doing a regular job in town can afford to be a hunter as well. 
Even with plenty of jobs paying reasonable wages, the 
fact remains—as Mr. Malaurie has pointed out—that the 
Eskimo workers’ basic food, their staple diet, comes from 
hunting. We still hunt whales at Point Barrow, and, even 
though this is not highly commercialized as it is meant 
primarily to meet local demand, whaleskins, for us, are an 
extremely valuable commodity. ° 4

|S Then, of course, there is reindeer-breeding, which is 
closed to the white man by U.S. federal laws which prevent 
him from owning reindeer. Herds of these animals——about 
60,000 head owned by Eskimo herdsmen—are to be found 
only in the north-western and peninsular parts of Alaska. 
Reindeer breeding has an excellent industrial potential 
for the future but, unfortunately, the State of Alaska is today 
planning to take over this activity. 
We Eskimos get the impression that the idea is to take 
away from us an industry we could develop quite well 
ourselves! The Japanese, who are already buying reindeer 
antlers which they make into a powder, have shown a keen 
interest in purchasing reindeer meat. 
We have musk-oxen, too, though at the present time this 
activity is still only in its early stages. The transplantation 
of musk-oxen to parts of northern Alaska is a very 
promising development.

hunting communities and, de-

fairly high incomes. There is an assured market for 
wild fox furs but it is up to us to improve the quality of the 
species in order to become competitive in this market. 
So far nothing of the sort has been done. 
Looking at Greenland as a whole, we need to examine 
ways and means of dovetailing this hunting micro-economy 
into the full range of Greenlandic activities. We cannot 
afford to overlook any resource that may help to reduce

Greenland's increasingly heavy burden of consumer imports. 
Our goal must be to produce and to diversify our 
production. Furs should be exported and the meat of 
marine mammals sold all over Greenland, with the hunting 
districts sending their produce to the game-poor south. 
Another aspect of the problem is that of increasing the 
value of products before exporting them so as to obtain 
the best possible return. Greenland regularly exports furs 
and pelts, but curiously enough has no tanning industry. 
This could become a new industry depending wholly on the 
produce of local hunting. 
| should also like to speak of the cultural aspects of 
hunting. None of you may think there is any relationship 
between the economy and culture where hunting is 
concerned. | personally maintain that there is a very 
close link. 
If Greenlanders are to remain a proud people and continue 
to be themselves, then they must accept their real national 
identity, based on the centuries-old Eskimo culture, which 
is so closely bound up with hunting activities. We should 
also adopt a modern and forward-looking attitude and make 
every effort to guarantee the continuity of hunting as an 
occupation in its own right and, at least in the beginning, 
as the framework for a national identity. 
We could go on talking about economics for ever. But 
if we fail to provide the conditions to enable the Eskimos 
of Greenland, Alaska and Canada to take pride in their 
national identity and culture and assert themselves as a 
people in their own right, then | am afraid all the wonderful 
economic plans made for them will turn out to be mere 
operations for propping up the economy of a deprived 
people who will be regarded with something like mockery. 
The close link existing between the economy and the way 
people feel about their work is well known. This, in fact, 
is what motivation is all about. There is also a very close 
relationship between motivation and the economy. 
| myself was born in Thule, in Greenland, in a hunting area. 
My father became one of the best hunters in the area. 
Both he and my mother used to say it was by coming in

human nature, as well as the most combative, the most 
constructive and the most independent men. So | feel

Chairman of the fully, and having left Thule, | began 
Provincial to see Greenland as a whole and 
Council realized that the policy followed in 
of Greenland Thule today reflects the aspirations 
of the Eskimos living there: they 
want to be integrated into Green- 
land society. 
Foxes, once the Eskimo hunter's staple, have declined 
considerably, whereas the human population in these 
regions has risen. At Angmagssalik, for example, it would 
be wrong to disperse the hunters, but it may soon become 
necessary to cut back hunting expeditions gradually as 
reserves of foxes and other wildlife will not be adequate. 
A similar situation prevails in other parts of Greenland. 
It has to be accepted then that people who can no 
longer hunt must be steered into other activities. 
    
  
| must object once again to the 
Jean assertions made by the Canadian 
MALAURIE and Greenland authorities that wild- 
life stocks in the present hunting 
areas are insufficient to meet the 
needs of today's hunting com- 
munities and that this shortage will 
be felt in the foreseeable future (in 
one or two generations). 
As regards foxes, Thule has 
always been, and still is, one of the 
world’s best-stocked areas. The 
potential is still vast. There are 
100 hunters in Thule; the territory 
is as big as 20 French departments, and it can be easily 
    
extended for seal-hunting ten times further in the north- 
west, which is at present uninhabited. 
If there has been a drop in the turnover of fox skins, 
it is due to market price levels, and has nothing to do with 
biogenetic causes, 
No published findings of any properly conducted bio- 
genetic and social and economic survey exist to support 
a biogenetic explanation of this drop, and | am not saying 
this lightly. It would be surprising if there were, considering 
the vastness of territories that all kinds of modern means 
place at the disposal of a relatively small hunting population 
(5,000 hunters operating all year round in the vast American 
and Green'and Arctic). What's more, hunting must be seen 
as a modern and highly mobile occupation. 
| fear that after the departure of the discouraged Eskimos, 
white industrialists may exploit these hunting grounds for 
themselves. And | should be surprised if they fail to 
obtain the assistance and financial backing which the native 
people lack today. 
The Arctic is vast, and biologically almost unexplored. 
it would be astonishing indeed if so limited an Eskimo 
population—80,000 in all, less all those who may not want 
to, or cannot, remain in the north—failed to obtain the 
economic and administrative independence they need for 
pursuing modern occupations. Because of its oil, natural 
gas and minerals, the American and Siberian Arctic promises 
to be one of the regions with the highest per capita income 
in the world. A bold territorial policy would surely enable 
native communities to finance their own development. IH

director of the Social Development Division of 
Canada’s Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. Since last year he has 
been directing a commission of inquiry into the 
Eskimo language for Canada’s National Eskimo 
Association, and since 196% he has headed

ed from Asia across the Bering Strait 
or over an isthmus which might have 
joined Asia and America much farther 
back in time. They came as primitive 
hunters seeking game without realiz- 
ing that they had crossed into another 
continent. 
Over the centuries there were a 
series of migrations; probably the 
earliest was of Indian people who 
almost never settled north of the tree- 
line. When the land bridge became 
covered with water 11,000 years ago, 
new arrivals could have crossed at the 
nearest points of headlands between 
the continents. The short distance is 
80 km. of open or frozen channel 
across the Bering Strait to Alaska from 
the Asian side. 
The sub-Arctic may have been inhab- 
ited for up to 40,000 years, but the 
bleak Arctic tundra where the average 
temperature for the warmest part of the 
year is less than 50°F. seems to have 
had a shorter human past. Recent 
findings in Alaska, known as the Den- 
bigh Flint complex, contain artifacts 
and evidence indicating this culture 
goes back to 3500 B.C. and it is 
generally accepted as the primary 
source from which Eskimo culture 
developed. 
If the ancestors of the present-day 
Canadian Eskimos arrived in North 
America over 5,000 years ago, they 
had spread across 8,000 km. of 
winding coast from Siberia to Green- 
land by 1000 A.D. This is about the 
same time that, according to the early 
Norse sagas, the Vikings sailed from 
Greenland across Davis Strait to 
Baffin Island. There they saw or met 
people called Skraelings—a Norse 
word which seems to describe both 
Indians and Eskimos. When the Norse 
withdrew, a gap of centuries passed 
before explorers and adventurers 
again visited the stark, silent shores 
of Arctic Canada. 
It is difficult to generalize about 
Eskimos as .a whole because there are 
significant regional differences bet- 
ween groups. Generally speaking, the 
great majority were coastal dwellers 
and most of their food, fuel and 
clothing was obtained from the sea 
in the form of walrus, whales, seals. 
Land animals such as the caribou 
and musk ox also contributed to their 
way of life. Many generations never

ESKIMO TRADITIONAL WAYS 
MUST NOT DIE 
Victors for thousands of years 
over a harsh environment, the Eskimos 
today face their greatest challenge: 
how to preserve their identity 
JEAN MALAURIE, French geographer and 
explorer, is professor of Arctic anthropology and 
geomorphology at the University. of Paris and 
professor of Arctic geography at the Ecole 
Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris, where he 
fs also director of the Centre of Arctic Studies. 
Secretary-General of the French Foundation of 
Nordic Studies, he is the author of over 150 
scientific studies. In 1970 he produced and 
directed a film version of his best-selling book 
on the life and present-day problems of the 
Greenland Eskimos, "The Last Kings of Thule” 
(Crowell New York, 1956), translated into 15 
languages. His "Les Civilisations Esquimaudes” 
(Eskimo civilizations) was published last year, 
and his work, “Anthropogéographie Esquimaude 
(Eskimo anthropogeography), will appear shortly 
(Plon Paris). In 1974, the French radio and TV 
commissioned Jean Malaurie to make three films 
on “The Eskimos Face their Destiny” in co-opera- 
tion with native organizations and the authorities 
of Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia. 
Shooting on location has been completed in 
Alaska and Canada and is under way in Green- 
land and Siberia,

N America it is expected that the 
last autonomous groups of native 
hunters in the Arctic will disintegrate 
if not totally disappear within the next 
20 years. The total assimilation of the 
native peoples of the North American 
Arctic and sub-Arctic during this 
period is, however, quite impossible. 
But the decline, already dating back 
some years and the cause of serious 
unrest, will only be hastened by 
current mineral and oil prospecting in 
northern Alaska (Prudhoe Bay) and 
northern Canada, and plans to speed 
up the development of Greenland's 
codfishing industry.

societies in the West's market-oriented 
production system and turn them, as

far as their limited local hunting and 
fishing resources allow, into consumer 
societies? Or is it felt that the com- 
prehensive development of these un- 
der-developed regions presupposes a 
respect for local cultures which form 
part of our global civilization and 
without which the world would be so 
much the poorer? 
Not long ago Unesco defined this 
complex notion of “development” as 
“any process aiming to create the 
conditions of a given society’s eco- 
nomic and social progress with the 
help of that society's active partici- 
pation and, if possible, at its own 
request.” 
The French economist Daniel Nat 
has made the following excellent ana-

### 49636: Eskimo traditional ways must not die: victors for thousands of years over a harsh environment, the Eskimos today face their greatest challenge: how to preserve their identity

MODERN LIFE PLAYS HAVOC WITH ESKIMO EYES AND 
TEETH. Eskimos’ eyes are very well adapted to the Arctic 
climate. The eye fissure is extremely narrow (photo left), 
and to protect themselves against snow blindness Eskimos 
wear goggles carved of wood, bone, ivory or other materials 
which admit light through a narrow slit (below). But changes 
in diet brought about by contact with modern civilization 
have had deleterious effects on many Eskimos’ eyesight. 
When they lived in natural conditions on a high-protein diet, 
  ! ; 
lysis of these points of view: “Either 
we consider that a culture is sovereign 
and unique and that the material and 
cultural elements which comprise it 
are indivisible; or we consider that 
underdevelopment englobes all aspects 
of society... A people's underdevelop- 
ment then becomes, and this is the 
commonest attitude, a sign of inferior- 
ity, a sickness inherited from the 
past.” 
The white man’s first contacts with 
the Eskimos in the 18th century were 
sometimes violent. Quite soon, how- 
ever, the native peoples put up only 
a passive resistance, while trying to 
absorb into their culture everything 
practical and useful the white man 
could offer them. 
In reality, this superficial passive- 
ness showed the immense pragmatism 
of this impoverished people, their age- 
old patience and their unshakeable 
confidence in their destiny. Econo- 
mists have frequently misinterpreted 
the Eskimo’s mask-like smile. It has 
been seen as a sign of eagerness to 
receive aid or become assimilated, 
whereas it was a manifestation, at 
least until recently, of a desire to 
co-operate in a spirit of self respect 
and dignity. 
Given this state of incomprehénsion 
between the agents of the dominant 
society and the native peoples, it is 
hardly surprising that some quite 
absurd situations have arisen. 
It has actually been suggested that 
the inhabitants of Canada's District 
of Keewatin and Southampton Island 
(in the Hudson Bay) should grow let- 
tuce or eat canned fish, that a timber 
industry should be developed in a 
treeless tundra, and that workshops 
manufacturing felt for hats should be 
set up in Cambridge Bay. 
Boarding schools in northern Green- 
land provide no instruction in modern 
hunting methods for the sons of trap- 
pers. With local facilities offering, for 
the moment, no prospect of jobs other 
than those they have done for cen- 
turies, one wonders what kind of 
future these children are being edu- 
cated for. In the words of one obser- 
ver, the progressive school conceived 
according to the assimilative ideas of 
the white man will end up by killing 
development. 
Is it surprising then that the native 
peoples, long uncomplaining, are be- 
ginning to grumble about the white 
man's inconsistencies? “Send us back 
to our lands...”, they say. “If we stay 
here too long we shall have lost even 
the will to live.” This at any rate was 
the gist of what Garry Lake Eskimos, 
in Canada's District of Keewatin, told 
government researchers in 1962, 
The missionary will probably say 
that the Eskimo should be converted 
and turned into a church-goer. The 
teacher will argue that everybody, 
white or Eskimo, should be given equal 
opportunities. He will tell Eskimo 
children that they should learn English 
or Danish, for every white man is se- 
cretly convinced that bilingualism will 
release these people from the strait- 
the Eskimos enjoyed good eyesight, often spending long 
periods on close work in poor light. Dr Elizabeth Cass, of the 
Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, studied 
the eyesight of groups of Canadian Eskimos and discovered 
that when Eskimo children moved to townships or settlements 
where they ate starchy foods, poor in proteins, they began 
to develop myopia.

the total loss of teeth at adolescence and digestive disorders.

jacket of their traditions, centred on 
the family with its intricately woven 
texture of kinship and its web of rules. 
For planners, the Eskimo needs edu- 
cation, training in the white man's 
system and a sense of responsibility. 
If current trends are not checked, 
whole areas of the Arctic which have 
been populated for centuries will soon 
be deserted. Idle and bitter, the Eski- 
mos will drift into a few big towns 
without an economic future—places 
like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Nome and 
Kotzebue in Alaska ; Fort Chimo, Ran- 
kin Inlet and Frobisher in Canada; and 
Godthaab, Godhavn, Angmagssalik 
and Thule-Kranak in Greenland. Unrest 
will grow among these unemployed 
minorities and they will become in- 
creasingly difficult to assimilate. 
The deserted plateaux of Keewatin 
and New Quebec, considered too poor 
in game for Eskimo hunters, will be- 
come a playground for millionaires 
from southern Canada and the United 
States. This is already happening. 
White tourists on hunting and salmon- 
fishing trips are beginning to take the 
place of the Eskimo, whose status has 
been reduced to that of guide. Who 
knows, the demand for local colour 
may soon lead to the building of Eski- 
mo villages as tourist attractions. 
The governments exercising trustee- 
ship over these peoples are no longer 
convinced that hunting is an econo- 
mically viable activity, although some 
relatively impressive results have been 
achieved. Greenland still applies a 
policy of guaranteed minimum prices to

nowadays in parts of the Arctic, but in sub-zero temperatures breakdowns are frequent 
and many Eskimos consider that dogs are more reliable for extended hunting expeditions. 
its hunting communities in the north- 
west and on the east coast, but neither 
Canada nor Alaska subsidize this vital 
activity of their Eskimo population. 
This refusal to organize an economy 
based on contracts is a measure of 
the mistrust in which the native peoples 
are held. The government reaction is: 
“What future can they have as Eskimos 
and hunters? Let's civilize them first; 
then we'll see.” 
And yet hunting has brought excel- 
lent returns. In its time it has made 
a fortune for powerful firms like the 
Hudson's Bay Company, and together 
with other occupations like fishing and 
reindeer rearing, it has been organized 
on rational modern lines and still pro- 
vides a good income for the inhabi- 
tants of the U.S.S.R’s Chukotka 
region and the autonomous districts of 
northern Siberia. 
To be profitable, a hunting economy 
requires certain specific conditions. 
The first requirement is that the area 
should be biologically rich. Secondly, 
the hunting community itself must be 
tightly-knit if the operation is to be 
soundly managed. Thirdly, and this is 
especially true today, hunting must be 
organized on industrial lines. If the 
second two conditions are not met, 
and if the native society is not pro- 
tected against itself, even the richest 
hunting area will only .support an 
impoverished community. 
Before the Danish State took over 
full responsibility for the District of 
16 
Thule, this territory provided its Ad- 
ministrator (at the time, Knud Ras- 
mussen) and his staff with a relatively 
high annual revenue. 
The extraordinary cohesiveness of 
the Thule community was successfully 
preserved by Knud Rasmussen. As 
early as 1923, he gave the community 
a political form, through a series of 
new laws based on old customs. A 
“Hunters’ Council” with limited powers 
but foreshadowing tomorrow's Eskimo 
government, was set up to administer 
the territory. ** Proud of their privileges, 
the people felt that they were working 
for themselves. Living in relative 
isolation, the community was also 
protected from outside diseases and 
had no chance to eat unsuitable foods. 
After Knud Rasmussen's death, and 
especially since 1936, the adminis- 
trative district of Thule was gradually 
incorporated into the rest of Greenland, 
with the result that this model group of 
Eskimos lost its uniqueness and its 
privileges. 
Since 1950 this decline has followed 
a classic course, with the break-up of 
the family as a unit of life and pro- 
duction (one woman in four now does 
not marry, but instead bears children 
to a number of men); abortions; a 
growing indifference to group interests; 
a weakening of leadership. 
Young people are giving up the 
kayak, since they are not taught how 
to handle kayaks at schoo! and are 
afraid of sailing them. Marksman- 
ship is getting worse; the Eskimos are 
settling down more and hunting less. 
They are increasingly dependent on 
manufactured gadgets, investing less 
in production, and their traditional 
codes are falling into disuse. 
Some Eskimos are leaving their 
communities, and educated Eskimos, 
scarcely representative of the com- 
munity’'s confused aspirations, are 
betraying their origins and seeking 
rapid assimilation into white society. 
Drunkenness and tooth decay are 
on the increase (few Eskimos do not 
need dentures by the age of 40). They 
are increasingly subject to eye dis- 
orders and their resistance to cold 
has diminished as a result of un- 
suitable foods (flour, jam, sugar, etc.). 
This moral crisis and physiological 
weakening have reduced productivity. 
Once a creditor society, the District 
of Thule is now heavily in debt. This 
is particularly alarming because of the 
presence of a big military base at 
Dundas-Thule. 
Drawn by the garbage, large numbers 
of foxes, prized by the hunters, con- 
verge on the base (which is out of 
bounds to Eskimos), with the result 
that the rest of the region is depleted. 
The base is also a permanent remin- 
der to the hunters of their impove- 
rishment, for an unskilled Danish or 
American worker there makes four 
times more than an experienced 
Eskimo hunter. 
The Thule Air Base at Dundas has 
thus become a symbol to the Eskimos, 
prompting them to ask questions about

the meaning of the historic segregation 
which they discover there. “It's too 
late,” Eskimo hunters of the region 
told me again and again in the spring 
of 1969. “The young are increasingly 
at odds with their elders and lack 
confidence in themselves. They no 
longer know what they are and some 
of them are likely to quit the land in 
the near future...lt is the cleverest, 
those who have done best at school, 
who will go away. Our hunting 
economy, which depends on team 
effort, will be disrupted and further 
impoverished. 
“The schools cream off the best of 
our hunters. As technicians, they will 
only find work away from our territory, 
in the south, which is in some ways 
a foreign country to them. The less 
intelligent ones will stay with us. They 
don't learn how to handle a kayak at 
boarding school, which also robs them 
of the opportunity to get day-in day- 
out instruction in hunting from their 
fathers. And so they won't be such 
good hunters. They won't be able to 
make a living from hunting. 
“We only go out hunting regularly 
because we love our dogs and have 
to feed them. And yet hunting is our 
real life, our natural source of satis- 
faction as men. In the south don't 
they know that we don't live to 
‘produce’, but to be ourselves, living 
together according to our customs? 
“We Eskimos don't even own the 
land on which we have been living 
for centuries. What will it be like 
when oil is found beneath our soil? 
Whose will it be?” 
It is easy enough to criticize, but 
these deplorable facts are convincing 
proof that it is basic principles that 
must be re-examined, not remedies 
which are likely to turn out to be 
mere palliatives., The Thule hunters 
are in fact saying what Jean-lacques 
Rousseau observed two centuries ago: 
“The slightest change in customs, 
even if it has certain advantages, 
always turns out to the detriment of 
morals.” Rousseau went on to add, 
with a wisdom close to that of the Eski- 
mo, “For customs are a people's mora- 
lity. The moment it ceases to respect 
them, there is no rule but its passions, 
no brake but laws.” 
The questions that arise today need 
to be framed in the context of the 
general problem of relations between 
co-existing cultures. 
On this subject, an editorial which 
appeared in the review Inter-Nord 
in March 1968 had this to say: 
"Until now these relations have 
usually been defined by outright 
conquest, latent colonization, enforced 
integration and by the anthropological 
annihilation of the weakest. The 
question now is whether the modern 
relationship patterns worked out in the 
American Arctic in recent years are 
radically different from previous 
attitudes, and whether they can 
eliminate the old ways of thinking, so 
long as it is not clearly and expressly 
recognized that all cultures are equally 
valid, and so long as the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights is not 
reinforced by a universal declaration 
of the rights of societies as they are 
and as they hope to be.” 
The International Covenant on Econ- 
omic, Social and Cultural Rights 
clearly indicates in Article | that “All 
peoples have the right of self-deter- 
mination. By virtue of that right they 
freely determine their political status 
and freely pursue their economic, 
social and cultural development.” 
Article 11 of the Convention con- 
cerning the protection and integration 
of indigenous and other tribal popu- 
lations, adopted by the General 
Conference of the International Labour 
Organization in 1957, is quite explicit: 
“The right of ownership, collective or 
individual, of the members of the 
populations concerned over the lands 
by market prices, flying in the face of 
any resistance on social or historical 
grounds, or to guarantee these minor- 
ity peoples a future within the context 
of a policy of overall development? 
As long as there is no well-defined 
integrated policy of getting the native 
people to develop the tundra for their 
own use by their own efforts (as in 
the U.S.S.R. and Sweden) so that pri- 
ces paid to hunters and fishermen are 
guaranteed at a very high level by 
royalties from oil and mining industries 
developed on their territory, there will 
be a strong temptation to drift into 
discouragement and pessimism and 
encourage the derelicts of Arctic socie- 
ties to emigrate south or to the growing 
mining industries in the north. 
An active, vigorous society is also 
a productive society. By turning to the 
Arctic seas (fisheries, fish breeding, 
etc.) and the tundra (traditional and 
modern ways of hunting, raising rein-

40 MILLION ACRES FOR NATIVE ALASKANS 
On December 18, 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was signed by 
This was hailed by the native peoples of 
The Act invested 12 newly created native 
Alaskan “Corporations” with considerable economic and political power. 
The Corporations became the full owners of 40 million acres of land and all its 
underground resources, which they were free to choose. They also received the 
sum of $962.5 million from the U.S. Treasury in compensation for relinquishing 
their historic rights to any other territories in Alaska. 
the choice of lands by the Corporations was finally completed. 
Among the various legal provisions, one specifically authorizes and encourages 
bilingualism in all regions where the people still speak their native languages. 
The Eskimos and Indians of Alaska—representing one-third of the State's population 
—have displayed outstanding adaptability and political acumen in coping with the 
difficult legal and economic problems raised by the Settlement Act. 
The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act may well provide a model—or indeed 
a lesson, if some of its provisions turn out to be negative—for any new measures 
which might be envisaged for Canada as well as Greenland. 
On December 18, 1974, 
  
which these populations traditionally 
occupy shall be recognized.” 
The Canadian Prime Minister, 
Mr. Pierre Trudeau, has written that 
in view of Canada's “polyethnic” 
character, “the different regions within 
the country must be assured of a wide 
range of local autonomy, such that 
each national group, with an increasing 
background of experience in self- 
government, may be able to develop 
the body of laws and institutions essen- 
tial to full expression and development 
of its national characteristics.” 
One could wrangle endlessly over 
the meaning of the word national, but 
it cannot be denied that the Eskimos 
and the Indians are ethnic groups with 
a national vocation. There was, one 
may recall, a confederation of Five 
Iroquois Nations in the 18th century. 
Since 1951, administrative changes 
have been taking place in Greenland, 
and today the Greenland Council, the 
“lLandsraad”, is administratively auton- 
omous within the Danish State. The 
changes reflect a trend towards an 
increasingly autonomous system. 
What kind of development is being 
sought in these regions? Is the aim 
to create an economy governed solely 
deer and musk oxen) the Eskimos will 
regain their dignity and their full au- 
thority as a community, through doing 
work which is natural and familiar to 
them. It is important that the life of the 
Eskimos as hunters and fishermen— 
which is a civilization in itself—no 
longer be a survival from the past but 
be recognized as a privilege and 
model for others to follow. This can be 
brought about through a hunting and 
fishing production policy, biologically 
planned and economically guaranteed 
to provide high remuneration from 
local oil revenues. 
Endowed with substantial financial 
resources, such a community could 
become the centre of modern Eskimo 
life, a true “national home”, where 
those Eskimos who are eager to be- 
come involved in the life of the south 
(mining, public works, service indus- 
tries) could nevertheless rediscover 
their cultural identity. 
This is no Utopian idea. Already 
Alaskan Trustees and Corporations 
are studying revolutionary plans for 
Eskimo villages. The Eskimo people, 
we can be sure, still have plenty of 
surprises in store for us. i

Eskimos have always depended on animals for 
their survival, and many an Eskimo caught in a 
blizzard owes his life to the stamina and sense 
of direction of huskies like the one shown at 
left, peering through a snowy mask. In good 
conditions a hard-driven eight-dog team can 
pull a sled over 100 miles in 24 hours. "Give me 
winter, give me dogs and you can keep the 
rest”, wrote the great Greenland ethnologist 
Knud Rasmussen (1879-1933). Trained huskies 
are invaluable on hunting expeditions, .using 
their keen sense of smell to sniff out seals’ 
breathing holes and polar bears’ lairs. 
The young bears shown above will not harm the 
Eskimo children watching them, but hunting 
the full-grown animals across snow and ice, 
far right, is perilous. Bear-hunters use huskies 
to harass their quarry until they can get 
within shooting range. In the past, in some 
parts of the Arctic where there were few dogs 
a man would pursue a bear over long distan- 
ces on foot, armed only with a harpoon. 
Skilled carvers, the Eskimos often depict ani- 
mals in ivory and stone. The base of this stone 
carving of a polar bear, right, by Manno, 
represents the animal’s reflection on the ice. 
Animal farming as well as hunting is practised 
in some parts of the Arctic. The forest of ant- 
lers seen in this striking light effect, above right, 
belongs to a reindeer herd on Yamal Peninsula 
in the Soviet Far North.

### 49637: I was born 1,000 years' ago; open letter from Chief Dan George of the Capilano Indians

Open letter from Chief Dan George of the Capilano Indians 
‘1 was born 1,000 years ago...’ 
My very good dear friends : 
AS it only yesterday that man 
sailed around the moon? You 
and | marvel that men should travel so 
far and so fast, yet if they have trav- 
elled far then | have travelled farther, 
and if they have travelled fast then | 
faster, for | was born a thousand years 
ago, born in a culture of bows and 
arrows. But within the span of half a 
lifetime | was flung across the ages to 
the culture of the atom bomb and from 
bows and arrows to atom bombs is a 
distance far beyond the flight to the 
moon. 
| was born in an age that loved the 
things of nature and gave them beauti- 
ful names like “Tessoualouit” instead 
of dried up names like “Stanley Park”. 
| was born when people loved nature 
and spoke to it as though it has a 
soul: | can remember going up Indian 
river with my father when | was very 
young. ! can remember him watching 
the sunlight fires on Mount Pé-Né-Né. 
| can remember him singing his thanks 
to it as he often did, singing the Indian 
word “thanks” very very softly. 
And the new people came, more and 
more people came, like a crushing 
rushing wave they came, hurling the 
years aside, and suddenly | found 
myself a young man in the midst of 
the twentieth century. 
| found myself and my people adrift 
in this new age but not a part of it, 
engulfed by its rushing tide but only 
as a captive eddy going round and 
round. On little reserves and plots of 
land, we floated in a kind of grey 
unreality, ashamed of our culture which 
you ridiculed, unsure of who we were 
and where we were going, uncertain 
of our grip on the present, weak in 
our hope of the future. 
| had a glimpse of something better 
than this for a few brief years. | knew 
my people when they lived the old life; 
| knew them when there was still a 
dignity in their lives and a feeling of 
worth In their outlook; | knew them 
when there was unspoken confidence 
in the home and a certain knowledge 
of the path they walked upon. But 
they were living on the dying energy 
of a dying culture, a culture that was 
slowly losing its forward thrust. 
We did not have time to adjust to 
the startling upheaval around us: we 
seem to have lost what we had without 
a replacement; we did not have time 
to take our twentieth-century progress 
and eat it little by little and digest it. 
Do you know what it is like to be 
without moorings? Do you know what 
it is like to live in surroundings that 
20 
are ugly? It depresses man, for man 
must be surrounded by the beautiful 
if his soul is to grow. 
Do you know what it is like to feel 
you are of no value to society and 
those around you, to know that people 
came to help you but not to work with 
you, for you knew that they knew you 
had nothing to offer. Do you know 
what it is like to have your race 
belittled, and have you been made 
aware of the fact that you are only 
a burden to the country? Maybe we 
did not have the skills to make a 
meaningful contribution, but no one 
would wait for us to catch up. We 
were shrugged aside because we were 
dumb and could never learn. 
What is it like to be without pride 
in your race? Pride in your family? 
Pride and confidence in yourself? 
‘What is it like? You don’t know for 
you never tasted its bitterness. | shall 
tell you what it is like. It is like not 
caring about tomorrow for what does 
tomorrow matter! It is like having a 
reserve that looks like a junkyard 
because the beauty in the soul is dead 
and why should the soul express an 
external beauty that does not match it? 
And now, you hold out your hand 
and you beckon to me to come over: 
“Come and integrate”, you say, but 
how can | come? | am naked and 
ashamed; how can | come in dignity? 
| have no presents, | have no gifts. 
‘What is there in my culture you value? 
My poor treasure you can only scorn. 
Am | then to come as a beggar and 
receive all from your omnipotent hand? 
Somehow, | must wait, | must delay. 
I must find myself, | must find my 
treasure. | must wait until you want 
something of me, until you need 
something that is me. | can raise my 
head and say to my wife and family: 
“Listen, they are calling, they need me, 
| must gol” Then, | can walk across 
the street and | will hold my head high 
for I will meet you as an equal. | will 
not scorn you for your gifts and you 
will not receive me in pity. Pity 
| can do without. My manhood, 
| cannot do without. 1 shall not come 
as a cringing object of your pityl | 
shall come in dignity or | shall not 
come at alll 
You talk big words of integration in 
the schools: does it really exist? Can 
we talk of integration until there is 
social integration? Until there is 
integration of hearts and minds you 
have only a physical presence and the 
walls are high as the mountain range. 
Come with me to the playground of 
an integrated high school. See how 
level and flat and ugly the black top is. 
But look, now it is recess time, the 
students pour through the doors. 
Soon, over there, is a group of white 
students and see, over there, near the 
fence, a group of native students, and 
look again, the black is no longer level: 
mountain ranges rising, valleys falling 
and a great chasm seems to be 
opening up between the two groups, 
yours and mine, and no one seems 
capable of crossing over. But wait, 
soon the bell will ring and the students 
will leave the playground. 
Integration has moved indoors. 
There is not much room in the class- 
room to dig chasms so there are only 
little ones there, only little ones for 
we won't allow big ones, at least not 
right under our noses. 
What do we want? We want first 
of all to be respected and to feel we 
are people of worth; we want an equal 
opportunity to succeed in life. But we 
cannot succeed on your terms, we 
cannot raise ourselves on your norms, 
we need specialized help in education, 
specialized help in the formative years, 
special courses in English; we need 
guidance, counselling; we need equal 
job opportunities for our graduates. 
Otherwise our students will lose 
courage and ask: “Well, what is the 
use of it all?” 
Let no one forget it: we are a people 
with special rights guaranteed to us 
by promises and treaties. We do not 
beg for these rights, nor do we thank 
you for them because, God help us, 
the price we paid was exorbitant. We 
paid for them with our culture, our 
dignity and our self respect. We paid 
and paid and paid until we became a 
beaten race, poverty-stricken and 
conquered. 
| know that in your heart, you wish 
you could help. | wonder if there is 
much you can do, and yet there is a 
lot you can do. When you meet my 
" children, respect each one for what he 
is: a child and your brother. 
it all boils down to just that. 
Dan George 
Maybe - 
  
This letter from Dan George, chief of the 
Capilano Indian tribe in British Columbia, 
Canada, was read to a recent symposium on 
the economic development of the Arctic and 
the future of Eskimo societies (see pages 4-11) 
by a missionary, Father André-Pierre Steinmann. 
He told the symposium that in his’ view this 
eloquent letter could equally well express the 
feelings of Eskimos in Greenland and Canada. 
Father Steinmann, of Puvirnituq, New Quebec, 
has spent over 30 years with the Eskimos and 
is a pioneer of their cooperative movement.

On the following pages the “Unesco Courier” pre- 
sents passages from a unique and as yet unpublished 
textbook of Eskimo culture. The chapter from which 
the extracts are taken is an account of the Eskimo 
way of life as related by the people of Payne Bay, 
an Eskimo village of 250 inhabitants on Ungava Bay 
in New Quebec (Canada). While compiling the book, 
a Canadian specialist in Eskimo language and culture, 
Michele Therrien, spent many hours listening to the 
village story tellers of Payne Bay recounting for the 
benefit of their children the folk wisdom and skills 
which have enabled the Eskimos to survive in a 
harsh and inhospitable environment. 
In the past, Eskimo children lived in close contact 
with their parents, who were their sole teachers. 
With the coming of modern civilization and a more 
settled way of life, many Eskimo children now 
attend residential schools and are thus separated 
from the family and its traditional education. For 
this reason, Eskimos have often asked that special 
attention be given to the teaching of Eskimo culture 
in schools. 
It was in response to this wish that the School Board 
of New Quebec asked Michéle Therrien to prepare 
a textbook in which the Eskimos themselves would 
share in setting down the basic features of their 
culture. Madame Therrien is a lecturer at the Centre 
of Arctic Studies and at the Institute of Oriental 
Languages and Civilizations (both in Paris). The 
textbook is to be published shortly in a trilingual 
—Eskimo, English, French—edition by the School 
Board of New Quebec (Quebec Ministry of Educa- 
tion, Canada).

© The way we lived 
+ When we were young, our 
homes were cold places. My 
mother used to go off fishing 
while | stayed behind. When 
she was nearly home, | could 
hear the noise she made cross- 
ing the snow and at last | 
would see her emerging from 
the darkness of the night. 
We were very thankful when 
she brought fish back with her 
or when my father brought 
back seal meat. When they 
were away, | stayed by myself 
in the cold house. 
When | grew up, | went off 
in search of moss for the fire. 
| used to bring back great 
quantities of it. This was how 
it was until the time came to 
move into the igloo. 
The menfolk used to hunt the 
walrus. When the hunting had 
been good, they would bring 
the sledge (gamut) laden with 
meat inside the igloo. The 
meat used to be cut up imme- 
diately after the kill and soon 
froze on the way back. Thus 
we would have a supply of 
good fresh food. We usually 
ate it raw because the oil lamp 
(qulliq) cooked things only very 
slowly. 
When we gave up the igloo 
and moved back into our tent, 
it felt warm and seemed very 
light, and life was quiet and 
peaceful.

How we travelled 
Leaving the village, we used 
to follow the Payne river 
upstream. Accidents sometimes 
happened. | remember Sarah 
Attasi being pulled out of 
the boat (umiak) by the rope 
with which the dogs towed the 
boat along the river bank. The 
dogs were pulling the boat 
near to the bank and Sarah 
was helping them when the 
rope got caught in the rocks 
and pulled her in. My father 
began shouting “She is dead”. 
The journeys were often very 
difficult, especially when we 
were passing upstream through 
the rapids. The dogs would 
pull the boat with long ropes, 
a woman going ahead to guide 
them. The men would look 
after the boat. The passengers 
were not allowed to move. The 
men rowed and the man at the 
tiller had to be very careful. 
| recall another accident. The 
boat was holed and the peo- 
ple in it were drowned. Two 
of them, an old man and his 
wife, were washed away and 
the stream carried their bodies 
right from the headwaters of 
the Payne river back to the 
village.

\Preparing 
for the long winter 
in days gone by 
  
SHELTER: People used to live 
in tents made of skin from the 
springtime until late autumn. 
After hunting and fishing, they 
would return to Payne Bay in 
autumn but would leave again 
for their camp in the winter. 
They would use their tents until 
there was enough snow to 
build an igloo, putting up a 
wall of snow round them until   
the snow was deep enough to 
cut blocks out of it. 
FOOD: After the summer hunt- 
ing and fishing, the food was 
put in store. Seal meat was 
placed in balloon-shaped bags 
of seaiskin (purtag) from which 
the fur had been removed. 
These were left on the spot 
and covered with rocks, and 
when the men or the dogs 
needed food in the winter 
they would go out by dog- 
sleigh to fetch it. It was 
impossible to transport all the 
fish and game taken during 
the summer to the winter 
camp as families travelled 
from summer to winter quar- 
ters by boat (umiak). The food 
consisted of dried and frozen 
fish, walrus, whale and seal 
meat, Shellfish were a fa- 
vourite food in summer. 
FUEL: In addition to wood, 
seal oil (ursug) and various 
mosses were used for lighting 
the stove. They were stocked 
up in the autumn, like food. 
Brushwood was gathered be- 
fore the snow fell. Fuel was 
needed every day for heating 
and cooking. 
TRANSPORT: The traditional 
umiak of wood and skins was 
replaced by a more modern 
all-wooden boat. The umiak 
was only used in summer and 
a family rich enough to own 
one would invite another family 
to use it to return to winter 
camp (it could carry about ten 
people). 
CLOTHING: Autumn was a 
very busy season for the wom- 
enfolk, who had to sew all 
the winter clothes for their 
husbands and children: mittens, 
atigi {warm jacket), coats of 
caribou or sealskin or eider- 
down-stuffed coats, sealskin 
boots, trousers. All this sewing 
was done in addition to the 
usual daily chores of cooking,   
collecting firewood and looking 
after the children. 
HOUSEHOLD EQUIPMENT: 
This consisted of a soapstone 
lamp (qulliq), lamp oil, flintstone 
(kasuk), dried moss, sufficient 
sealskins to make the harness 
for the dog-sleigh, a wooden 
platform on which the bed was 
placed in the houses and hunt- 
ing igloos, crockery and uten- 
sils. 
TEMPERATURE: A sharp eye 
should be kept cn the weather 
to see if it is suitable for hunt- 
ing, gathering fuel etc. Check 
the weather very early in the 
morning. 
FISHING TACKLE, WEAPONS: 
The hunter needs to have all 
his equipment in good order 
and ready for use, He makes 
fishing-spears (kakivak) sledges 
and a canoe (kayak), and 
cleans his gun. He makes a 
white screen out of a piece of 
cotton or skin, stretched over 
a wooden frame for seal-hunt- 
ing, to conceal him from his 
prey. He gets his cartridges 
ready. Before guns came into 
use, hunters used to have to 
make their bows and arrows 
and harpoons. The hunter 
always needs to carry a knife 
and a bag with him. 
SEAL HUNTING: The hunter 
may be hunting the seal single- 
handed on the ice. He climbs 
a hill to see if there are seals 
around. [If there are, he sets 
off with his dogs, taking with 
him a youngster to hold off

the dogs while he tries to kill 
the seal. After the kill, he 
signals to the youngster to 
bring up the sledge. If they 
suspect there are other seals in 
the neighbourhood, the young- 
ster will stay in the background 
and try to calm the dogs. 
FISHING IN WINTER: Fishing 
1s done through the Ice with 
a hook and line. One can also 
build a stone dam (saput); the 
fish then group together and 
can be speared with the 
kakivak. 
FISHING IN SUMMER: Nets 
are used, and must be placed 
in a certain way if the catch 
is to be a good one. They 
should not be stretched too 
tight, they must be kept clear 
of waterweeds and must not 
be placed in deep water where 
it is difficult to net fish. 
TRAPPING: Both men and 
women set traps. A good catch 
depends on having a good 
technique. The trap must be 
covered over with soft moss, 
not too thickly or the moss 
will get caught while the fox 
escapes. The scrap of meat 
or rotten eggs that are put in 
the trap should not be too big 
or the fox will be able to bite 
them without getting caught. 
The direction of the wind is 
important: if the trap is up- 
wind from the fox, it will be 
attracted by the smell and go 
straight towards the trap. 
Young boys also set traps. 
It is always a red-letter day 
when a catch is made as the 
proceeds of the sale can be 
used to buy tools or hunting 
weapons. : 
FAMINE: When food is short, 
families count on one another's 
help. Those who have a little 
food share it with their neigh- 
bours. People still remember 
particularly difficult years when

their separate ways to avoid

How to build 
  
an igloo in a storm 
You need to know quite a lot 
to build an igloo. We used to 
build shelters for ourselyes 
when we travelled with dogs 
and we still build them even 
now when we travel with snow- 
mobiles. 
It's dangerous when the 
snow is falling and the wind 
blowing at the same time. The 
igloo may be buried or you may 
lose your way. You must stop 
and think where to build and 
you must choose the right spot, 
otherwise the igloo may be 
blown away or covered with 
snow. 
Nowadays we use fast snow- 
mobiles which can get us back 
to the village quickly, if all 
goes well, but you have to 
learn to take precautions just 
in case. 
You put a canvas screen 
upwind from the igloo; If you 
haven't got a screen, you can 
use blocks of snow. Soft snow 
is soon blown away and you 
cannot build with it. It is diffi- 
cult to breathe inside the igloo 
when there is no wind. You 
should also be wary of freezing 
snow, When it is very cold 
and the igloo is on too high 
ground, the snow can easily be 
blown away. 
If there is no good snow 
about, you have to build an 
igloo with whatever you can 
find. The best snow for build- 
ing igloos is shiny, with crystal- 
lized snowflakes on its surface, 
looking as if rain had fallen on 
it. This is good snow; it looks 
the same on top and under- 
neath. It is neither too soft nor 
toc hard, 
 Life in the igloo, stone cut 
print, by Kalvak 
  
There are no trees here and 
you must be very careful when 
you go out hunting. If you are 
going to be away for more than 
a day, if you cannot get back 
to the village and a storm is in 
the offing, you must size up 
the situation very carefully. 
Every minute counts when 
snow is falling, the northeast 
wind is blowing and dark 
clouds are building up. 
If you are making an igloo 
during a snowstorm and you 
see the snow piling up around 
the igloo, it is a danger signal, 
especially if you have only just 
started building. This has hap- 
pened to me twice. When the 
fresh snow covers the igloo 
you must abandon it and find 
another place to build a shelter. 
My brother used to go with 
me and | was careful not to 
let him out of my sight. | 
used to cal! him so that we 
did not get separated. If you 
cannot make yourself heard, it 
is better to call the dogs since 
they have very good hearing. 
This was how | found where 
I was when | called to my 
dogs for help. It is a good 
idea to carry some reserves 
in case of a sudden storm. 
You must also look after the 
snowmobile. When we used 
to have dog sleighs, we built 
a platform with blocks of snow 
and put the gamuti (sledge) on 
it out of reach of the dogs, 
which would otherwise eat the 
harness. A snowmobile can 
get buried under the snow, and 
it is also very heavy to lift. 
Before leaving the village, 
make sure you have a knife 
and a screen. Without these 
implements, a hunter can freeze 
to death or get frostbite in his 
feet if his snowmobile breaks   
down a long way from the 
village, ‘ 
When the Igloo is finished, 
you still need to protect your- 
self. Just coming into the 
igloo from the cold immediately 
makes you feel warm, but if 
you have no sleeping bag or 
heater it starts to feel very 
cold inside at night. When this 
happens, you must keep mov- 
ing about. You should dig 
a hole in the snow and pul 
your feet in the hole, keeping 
your boots on to prevent frost- 
bite. You must also find 
something to sit. on so that 
your clothes do not get wet.

The state i the ice 
in autumn 
' Dangers of the ice 
in springtime 
Fishing 
 
You should know that In the 
old days, when the dogs were 
crossing dangerous ice, it was 
easy to turn around and go 
back. In the daytime you could 
tell by the dogs what state the 
ice was in. Nowadays, the 
snowmobile keeps straight on 
and there is no means of know- 
ing whether the ice is dan- 
gerous or not. 
When you see small snow- 
flakes on the surface of the 
ice it means that this is ice 
which has only just frozen and 
which is not yet very solid. 
So it Is dangerous. You some- 
times also see a sort of snow 
mixed with water. 
You should never walk on 
new Ice. Lakes sometimes 
seem to be frozen hard, but 
the ice may be very thin in 
the middle. There is no dan- 
ger near the shores of the 
lake: the water begins to 
freeze around the edges and 
the ice gradually spreads 
towards the middle of the lake. 
Lacharissle Targiapik 
Game, stone cut print, 
by Akourak   
There are several signs 
which warn you that the spring 
ice is dangerous. These are 
some of the signs you will 
see on lakes and rivers, Be- 
ware of holes filled with 
soft snow, which forms little 
bubbles. Melting ice is also 
dangerous. The ice sometimes 
looks firm underneath a layer 
of snow but the snow may 
conceal a hole. 
Lakes which are in the lee 
of mountains often have holes 
filled with soft snow. 
When you want to walk on 
a lake, it is best to keep at 
first by the shore where the 
snow is piled up. Ice and 
snow float better where the 
snow on the shore of the lake 
is deep.

Building a kayak 
It takes four weeks to build 
a new kayak, including the time 
needed for sewing the skins. 
Four large seal skins are need- 
ed for a large kayak. The 
finished boat is heavy and 
two men are needed to carry 
It down to the water. The 
people of the interior used to 
use a kayak made of wood 
and caribou skin. It was light 
enough to be carried by one 
man. 
Tumasi Kallak   
Put a piece of tunu {caribou 
meat), fat or guts of fish on 
the end of the line to attract 
the fish. You can also use 
a piece of white cotton. 
The bait should not be attach- 
ed too firmly or the fish will 
not bite.

The fisherman makes a hole 
in the ice and slips down 
through it. At low tide, it Is 
possible to crawl along under 
the ice. You take a lamp with 
you and in this way you can 
gather the shellfish from the 
rocks. Sometimes there is no 
need to make a hole, as the 
cracks in the ice are big 
enough for a man to pass 
through. 
This is a very dangerous 
way of collecting shellfish. 
Fishermen have sometimes 
been unable to find the hole 
where they came in and have 
been caught under the thick 
Ice as the tide rose.

Floating ice is sometimes 
piled up by currents at the 
mouth of the Payne river. One 
must be very careful. 
When you are going hunting 
and you want someone to go 
with you, never force anyone 
to go. They may agree to it 
without really wanting to. So 
they may be lazy and careless 
during the hunting expedition. 
An accident can happen or you 
can lose your boat if the per- 
son with you doesn't look after 
it properly. This sort of thing 
always causes trouble, 
A woman can be very useful 
if she is used to hunting. She 
can do the things that a boy 
would do in similar circums- 
tances and she will also learn 
to hunt well in addition to 
working at home. 
When you kill a seal, you 
must cut it up immediately and 
put the pieces in the boat. If 
you get caught in the ice, you 
can then easily throw the 
pieces overboad. It is also 
better to stay within sight of 
other boats. If you are in 
danger you can easily call for 
help. 
If you see a seal lying on 
the ice with its fur dry, I 
means that It is asleep. If its 
fur is wet it Is not asleep and 
can see you perfectly well, as 
seals have sharp eyesight. You 
can try to catch it by making 
lots of noise. 
The mother seal is very dan- 
gerous. It loves and protects 
its young. It will attack your 
boat if you try to kill the young. 
It has very sharp claws. 
As they rise to the surface, 
big -seals make bubbles. Just 
before a seal emerges, the ice 
moves and you will see two 
big bubbles. If you touch the 
ice, it will know you are there. 
The best thing is to hit it the 
moment it appears. 
The small seal, known as 
tigituraq, is easier to hunt. 
Even if the boat makes a lot 
of noise as it runs into the ice, 
these seals are not bothered. 
You can try listening for big 
seals by holding an oar pushed 
through the ice. When you 
hear the seal coming towards 
the boat, you must circle round 
and round the same point. The 
seal will then surface for a 
second. 
Tiriluk seals are often found 
on ice floes around islands at 
low tide. 
You sometimes see seals on 
the ice but you cannot get to 
them because too many ice 
floes are being carried along 
by the current, but you some- 
times also see places which 
are not dangerous. 
If you find a place where 
there is a lot of ice or where 
the ice floes are too near to 
each other, you can easily pull

away from the shore; when we 
used kayaks, it was more diffi- 
cult as the kayak was heavy 
and had no motor. 
Beware of freezing water. 
In autumn sea water is very 
heavy, much heavier than fresh 
water would be. When there 
is snow on the surface, it looks 
as if no snow has fallen. That 
is the time to be very careful. 
Also, you should not leave 
your boat on the ice near the 
water's edge, and especially 
not at right angles to the sea. 
The melting ice may break and 
the boat may slip into the 
water. Put it in a safe place. 
Ice breaks near the shore. 
Before trying to walk on the 
ice when you have seen a seal, 
you must make sure that the 
ice will not break. When there 
is not much ice left round 
about, what remains will be 
brittle. 
Take care of your canvas 
screen. Do not rest your gun 
near the frame. Fire over the 
top of the screen because 
some seals have very keen 
eyesight and you may other- 
wise miss your chance to fire. 
If you are walking towards 
a seal and you see it move Its 
head, you must stop if it starts 
to move. 
Seals raise their heads when 
they are breathing in. They do 
not breathe when they are lying 
down, just as if they were in 
the water,

"Hunting the fox 
When the hunter goes around 
his traps in autumn, he some- 
times sees a fox outside the 
trap. If the fox sees the hunter, 
the hunter must pretend not 
to have seen it so as not to 
frighten it away. 
If the fox does not see 
the hunter coming, the hunter 
should hide behind a rock and 
whistle. The fox will think it 
is a lemming and will come 
closer. 
If the fox is facing him, the 
hunter must stop when the fox 
stops, otherwise it will run 
away. When a fox is near and 
is not looking in the hunter's 
direction, the hunter should fire 
quickly before the fox sees 
him. If you see a fox asleep, 
rolled up in a ball, you can get 
very close to it.

Hunting the hare 
The hunter can follow the 
tracks of hares on the hills. 
If the hare is going round one 
side of the hill, the hunter can 
set off round the other side 
and meet it. 
If the hare hides among big 
rocks to rest, it will stay there 
until the hunter sees it. When 
the hunter approaches, it runs 
away. The best thing to do is 
to pretend not to see it and to 
head off in another direction to 
find a good angle from which 
to shoot. 
Never walk straight towards 
a hare. By approaching from 
the side, you can get very 
close to it. It is possible to 
follow the tracks of hare, but 
they may go on for a very 
long way. It is better to look 
elsewhere. 
  
Saalati Simioni 
Hunting the ptarmigan 
  
Walk down wind. If you see 
several birds together and they 
fly off, you know that they will 
settle again. Walk down and 
fire. Some of them will fly 
away and settle a little further 
off. Keep following them down 
wind and in this way you can 
kill them all. 
It is good for children to go 
with their parents to hunt the 
ptarmigan, but they must stay 
well away and be careful. 
When the birds hide, you can 
follow their tracks. 
Saalati Simloni   
The diver bird 
Old people believe that the 
diver bird can tell them certain 
things. When the diver is in 
the water and moves its body 
from side to side to show that 
its feet are pointing in a certain 
direction, it is called nulurtutug, 
which means that it is holding 
its feet above the water. 
You must then look to see 
if both its feet are raised: If 
so the diver telling you that 
it has seen caribou In a certain , 
direction. 
The hunter knows that the 
caribou are there but still a 
long way away if the diver 
does not dabble its feet in the 
water when it moves them. 
This means that the hunter will 
reach the spot where the herd 
of caribou is in two or three 
days. 
He sets off stralght away and 
when he arrives in the area 
Indicated, he immediately sees 
tracks on the ground; he then 
follows them in the direction 
shown by the diver. 
If the diver dabbles its feet 
in the water as it moves, then 
the hunter knows that the 
caribou are nearer. 
If you are soon going to 
run out of food during the 
summer time, the diver appears 
to be very sad; It makes a 
noise showing that it knows the 
people are going to go hungry. 
If you see a palr of divers 
dancing on the water and 
making a lot of noise, it means 
you are going to be lucky and 
have plenty to eat. They some- 
times even disturb the water 
on a very calm lake and this 
is an omen for the hunters.

When the diver flies In a 
circle and looks as if it is going 
to land, this means that there 
are caribou nearby but you 
cannot see them. If the hunter 
has understood this signal from 
the diver, he should go to a 
nearby hill to spot the caribou. 
These things are only of 
use to those who know the 
habits of the diver.

Puvirnitug means stinking 
rotten meat (during the hot 
summer). 
There were several women 
who used to travel over the 
ice. They used to build their 
own igloo. There were also 
groups of men who hunted. 
They had a dog which used 
to smell out the holes in the 
ice. The hunters would stick 
their harpoons in the hole in 
the ice and pile blocks of snow 
all around. Then they would 
wait all night for the seal to 
come up to breathe. Some- 
times they would fall asleep. 
The men were so hungry that 
they grabbed hunks of meat. 
One of them cut his hand 
without even feeling it. One 
of the hunters who wanted to 
keep ali the pieces for himself 
had nothing at all. 
They fed their dogs on a kind 
of soup made with seal meat. 
One of the hunters was 
responsible for warning the 
others if the ice started to 
break. If it did, they would 
set off for the land. The jour- 
ney might take a whole day. 
The igloo built on the ice 
had a block of Ice in place of 
a window. This ice came from 
a lake which was often far 
away. Every time they moved 
they took the window with 
them but sometimes they forgot 
it and they would have to go 
back to fetch it.   
When they returned to Puvir- 
nituq, the hunters used to 
collect whale oil during the 
summer. This used to be sent 
off to the south. Some hunters 
went away to hunt caribou 
inland. Those who stayed to 
work were taken on by the 
whites and were paid a wage; 
part of the money was given 
to them in the morning and 
the rest in the afternoon. A 
whole day’s wages were called 
tatauti. 
The various people of Unga- 
va—the Sirqginirmiut, the Nuna- 
miut and the Sinaamiut—used 
to get together for games. 
Some of these people lived on 
the coast, some on the main- 
land, and some on the ice. 
They used to organize compe- 
titions. Their clothes were 
very prettily decorated. 
Two of the women folk had 
a reputation for embroidering 
beautifully ornamented clothes. 
They began to sell these to 
the Europeans and learned two 
words: yes and no, 
There used to be foot races 
and ball games. To decide 
which of the teams should have 
the first turn in the team 
games, a circle was drawn and 
a stake to which was attached 
a loop of rope was driven into 
the ground. The ball had to 
be thrown as high into the air 
as possible and had to pass 
through the loop.

HE peoples of the north in the 
U.S.S.R. have always handed 
down their stock-breeding skills from 
generation to generation within the 
family or the encampment. Young 
children were taught the basics of 
animal farming, and as they grew older 
they learned more advanced methods 
and techniques. Studies of this prac- 
tice have led to the idea of a “people's 
school” providing vocational training 
for young people in the Far North. 
The passing on of practical know- 
ledge from parents to children has long 
been an integral part of general family 
education, in the past the only means 
of vocational training.

### 49639: Into the Soviet tundra: where learning to lasso reindeer is an everyday school subject

 
where learning to lasso 
‘reindeer is an everyday 
school subject 
inhabited by the peoples of the north 
were virtually non-existent. Then in the 
first years of Soviet rule school build- 
ing began in the Far North and con- 
tinued at a brisk rate. By the end of the 
1930s there were 86 day and boarding 
schools in four of the seven districts 
of the Far North and inthe Murmansk 
oblast (administrative region). 
In addition to the permanent schools, 
mobile schools began to be opened 
in the tundra and the taiga forest 
regions of Siberia about 40 years ago, 
in reindeer breeders’ camps, among 
fishing communities, and in places 
inhabited seasonally by hunters, fisher- 
men and herdsmen. The purpose of 
these mobile schools was to provide 
education in the native tongues for the 
greatest possible number of children, 
most of whom at that time shared the 
nomadic life of their parents. 
This intensive drive to open schools 
in the Far North paid dividends. in a 
fairly short time schools were available 
for all children over the age of seven, 
both those living sedentary or semi- 
sedentary lives and the nomads. By 
about the 1940s this education problem 
had been satisfactorily solved in most 
districts of the north, (See “Schools 
of the Soviet Far North", “Unesco 
Courier”, June 1972) 
In the years which followed, particu- 
lar attention was devoted to increasing 
the number of schools and improving 
teaching methods, specially adapted to 
local conditions. 
In 1970, the Far North regions had 
more than 600 schools of different 
types, including primary (four years 
of schooling), shortened secondary 
(8 years’ course) and full secondary 
(10 years’ course). 
These secondary schools provide 
training in various occupations such 
as reindeer-breeding, fishing, etc., and 
the teaching is specially adapted to 
farming conditions in the Far North 
regions, where reindeer farming is the 
chief activity. 
The vocational training of children 
in the Far North as it exists at present 
comprises three main stages: 
1) Vocational training for pre-school 
children and those in junior classes at 
school (5 to 10 years) generally takes

place within the family. At this age 
toys are the main teaching aids. These 
are usually miniature versions of tools 
which are (or were) used by adults 
in daily life. Among the most common 
are bows and arrows, which develop 
qualities such as accuracy and visual 
judgement. Hunting games such as 
throwing the lasso (maoute, chaoute) 
develop similar skills. Gradually, 
parents see to it that their children 
spend less and less time playing. 
Games begin to take on a more pract- 
ical character: children use young rein- 
deer as targets for lassoing and prac- 
tise harnessing dogs to small sleighs. 
The basic vocational training in the 
junior classes consists of energetic 
games and sports (especially skiing). 
No vocational training is provided in 
the primary schools, where all sub- 
28 
jects are taught in the native languages. 
2) The next stage of vocational 
training is important because it intro- 
duces the children to the techniques 
of fishing, hunting, reindeer-breeding 
and other occupations of the Far North. 
At this age (11 to 15), the children 
familiarize themselves with fishing and 
hunting equipment. They are taught 
how to look after reindeer, and learn 
about the biology of furred animals 
and fish. They do jobs on reindeer 
farms, working directly with the 
reindeer-breeders. 
The secondary school in the village 
of Novoye Chaplino (Chukotka district) 
is a concrete example of the kind of 
vocational training courses provided 
for the children of the Far North. 
Chukchi, Eskimo and Russian children 
attend this school, and in recent years 
Re he a ue FR AE Tam) 
the chief subject taught there has been 
the raising of furred animals. 
In the two upper classes, two and 
three hours respectively were devoted 
to this subject each week. Lessons 
were also given on a stock-rearing 
farm belonging to the local kolkhoz 
(collective farm), known as “Zarya 
kommunizma“ (“the dawn of com- 
munism”), under the direction of the 
biology teacher and a specialist in 
the breeding of furred animals. Each 
pupil looked after two or three animals. 
Other schools in the north gear 
their education to hunting, fishing or 
reindeer-breeding, and some combine 
training in a number of these activities. 
The secondary school of Laryakskaja 
in the district of Khanta-Mansi is

furred animals, Another school, at 
Ust'-Belsk in the district of Chukotka, 
trains its pupils in fishing, breeding 
furred animals and raising reindeer. 
At Bajkitski in the Evenk district, the 
school provides instruction in hunting 
and the breeding of furred animals. 
The education provided in each 
school is determined by the economic 
needs of the local kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes (state farms). Particular 
care is taken to ensure that the schools 
have adequate equipment and are 
well-staffed. 
In practice, all the reindeer-breeding 
instruction is provided by the kolkho- 
zes and the sovkhozes. For example, 
at Novoye Chaplino school mentioned 
above, the head teacher and the local 
kolkhoz arranged for pupils in the 
four senior classes whose parents 
were members of the farm's reindeer- 
breeding sections to work with them 
during the summer as apprentice- 
herdsmen. A large number of pupils 
in schools in the Taimyr district work 
during the summer in the fishing 
sections of the local kolkhoz, and 
LEARNING 
BY DOING 
In the vast Chukotka dis- 
trict of northern Siberia, 
reindeer farming is still 
the most important tra- 
ditional occupation of 
the native peoples. Inthe 
Soviet Far North the 
schools provide special 
lessons on the habits of 
reindeer (below). But 
handling a lasso (left) 
needs a high degree of 
skill, and there is no real 
substitute for practical 
experience and guid- 
ance from parents. 
 
  
during the winter holidays they help 
out in partridge rearing. 
The family, however, still plays a 
key role in vocational training, de- 
pending on the children’s ages. Skills 
normally acquired within the family 
include: how to use fire-arms, how to 
handle draught animals and reindeer 
sleighs, how to cure reindeer skins, 
make certain kinds of clothes and 
prepare food. Not all schools in the 
north can yet provide every aspect 
of the vocational training described 
above, and so the contribution of the 
family is still highly important. 
3) During the final stage of vo- 
cational training, teen-agers specialize 
in the work they have chosen. After 
taking the short course of secondary 
education, some pupils choose to con- 
centrate on reindeer-breeding and go 
on to attend more advanced courses in 
animal farming, which are available in 
many districts and in the bigger towns 
of the polar region. These schools 
train technicians specializing in the 
breeding of reindeer and furred 
animals. For instance, the Naryan-Mar 
technical school in the Nentsy district 
trained 608 students in 14 years, 
including 139 Nentsys and 135 Komis. 
At the end of the short course of 
secondary education (and in some 
cases even before), some teenagers 
start work immediately in the various 
sections of the kolkhozes and sovkho- 
zes, one pupil usually being assigned 
to each section, 
In the hunting sections, pupils learn 
how to set traps, how to skin animals, 
how to treat hides, and how to track 
animals. 
Apprentice fishermen learn all about 
the art of fishing: where to fish in 
different seasons, how to tell the depth 
of the water, and how to forecast the 
weather. 
In the reindeer-breeding sections, 
the pupil learns all about the herds- 
man’s job; he is taught about calving 
and migrations and how to distinguish 
between the different breeds of 
reindeer and the various kinds of 
pasture. He learns how to build and 
repair reindeer sleighs, and how to 
train draught reindeer and hunting 
dogs. A specialist is responsible for 
each pupil throughout the training 
period. 
Training lasts from one and a half 
to two working seasons for fishing and 
furred animals and from two to three 
years for reindeer-breeding. After this 
the pupil becomes a full member of 
his section, 
Such is the present educational 
system in the Far North of the U.S.S.R. 
In the future it will, of course, have 
to be improved. But generally speaking 
this vocational training system meets 
current requirements in training the 
specialists which are acutely needed 
by the farms and communities of the 
reindeer-raising economy of the 
north, i

### 49635: The Changing Canadian Eskimo: 'the development of the North is a historical process that cannot be reversed'

THE CHANGING CANADIAN ESKIMO 
Continued from page 13 
saw any explorers or whalers and 
some had very infrequent association 
with the traders. Historically they 
firmly believed that theirs and the 
‘animal life of the hunt was the only 
world of man. 
This is reflected in the name they 
called themselves—Inuit—The People 
(the real or only people). The word 
Eskimo, meaning “Eaters of Raw 
Meat”, appears to have originated 
from the language of the Algonquin 
Indians in Eastern Canada. It was 
absorbed into French and was first 
used in 1611. 
Although early explorers of the 
Canadian Arctic had met Eskimos from 
time to time over a period of 300 years, 
they had few dealings with them. 
The people lived in a natural economy, 
gaining their food and clothing from 
the hunt. 
They were sheltered through the 
long dark winter in an amazing piece 
of architecture—the igloo or snow 
house; in summer they lived in tents 
of seal or caribou skin. There was 
some sort of balance with nature and 
perhaps the population in those days 
was about 20,000 to 25,000, or nearly 
one-third more than the present figure 
of 15,000. 
But there is no point in idealizing. 
Their numbers remained small because 
death came often. Eskimos starved, 
died by violence, died young. Possi- 
bly they had some of the diseases of 
our civilization before we came— 
arthritis, heart disease, pneumonia, 
appendicitis. Life was precarious and 
life was relatively simple. Eskimos 
had learned to conform to the nomadic 
hunters’ way of life and the climatic 
cycle of the seasons. 
They were almost imprisoned in 
their Arctic environment. The historian 
Arnold Toynbee refers to Eskimos as 
one of the arrested civilizations whose 
“tour de force” was living and hunting 
on or around the shores of the Arctic 
seas. This demanded so much of their 
energy that none was left to apply to 
further advances. The climatic cycle 
made them captives of their Arctic 
environment. 
They had no written literature or 
writing of any sort but they had a 
strong cultural heritage in the story, 
the folk song, the drum dance. They 
had ethics, taboos and philosophies of 
social relations which were practical 
and effective for the good of all. In 
some respects their morality shocked 
the newcomers from the south, but it 
was a morality born of the Arctic 
environment and not Europe's. 
In time it was we who changed their 
philosophy and brought many tensions 
and contradictions to these hardy, 
resourceful people. They retained 
their sense of humour even in the 
extreme adversity that they faced 
daily. One of their philosophical or 
30 
fatalistic phrases passed down by 
generations to today is Ayungamut: 
it cannot be helped. 
Traditionally, the Eskimo believed 
that the amount of game which the 
hunter secured depended upon his 
relations with the spirits who con- 
trolled the supply of animals. He used 
harpoons, fish spears, bird darts and 
bows and arrows and could usually 
obtain enough food to sustain life. 
The primitive weapons did not appre- 
ciably affect wildlife resources as a 
whole. 
The introduction of the rifle made 
it much easier for the hunter to pro- 
vide meat for his family, but it also 
put modern weapons into the hands 
of men who killed more than they 
needed. Resources on which they had 
depended for so long were quickly 
depleted. Whales were virtually wiped 
out; walrus were slaughtered and 
became scarce where they had been 
plentiful. The musk oxen were elimi- 
‘nated from the coastal areas.

By the turn of the century, the 
bottom had dropped out of the whaling 
market and a new influence came with 
the arrival of the traders. Hudson's 
Bay Company traders turned their 
attention to the fur of the Arctic or 
white fox; this luxury fur then became 
the principal commodity exchanged by 
the Eskimos for food, utensils and 
equipment from the south. 
  
 
  
The trader was a more permanent 
fixture than the whaler; he introduced 
the idea of bartering white fox furs 
for store goods, and in so doing 
prevented the Eskimo from ever again 
being totally independent. The luxu- 
ries of store supplies became the 
necessities of the home. 
The development of the white fox 
trade, however, has had both good and 
bad effects on the Eskimos. Opinions 
differ as to which out-balances the 
other. The trade had revolutionized 
their way of life and disrupted many 
of their traditional habits. The white 
fox was prime from November to 
April—the period when most Eskimos 
of the past would be hunting seals at

their breathing holes, the floe-edge, 
or at open water leads. The Eskimos 
replaced “bannock” made of flour for 
some of their customary foods like 
seal meat and developed a taste for 
tea, sweets and tobacco. 
The white fox, before the advent of 
the white man, was perhaps the most 
useless animal in the country. The 
primitive Eskimo seldom used the pelt 
because it was not strong and durable 
like the seal, the polar bear or the 
caribou. It did not have layers of fat 
common to other Arctic animals with 
the result that the flesh was seldom 
eaten. 
The Eskimo did not entirely give up 
his seal hunting practices to trap 
foxes; he only interrupted them during 
the short trapping season. The tran- 
sition from a hunting economy to 
trapping and hunting was much the 
same as when our ancestors turned 
from hunting to agriculture and indus- 
try to obtain a better and easier way 
of life with many amenities resulting 
from the change. 
From roughly the early years of 
this century onward to World War I, 
the allure of the new goods offered 
by the fur trade gradually enmeshed 
the Eskimos in a new economy and 
with it came the breakdown of a very 
ancient way of life. This influence was 
widespread in varying degrees over a 
million square miles of Arctic territory. 
However, until the world conflict 
Canadian Eskimos still lived a fairly 
primitive nomadic life in a remote, 
sparsely populated country. 
The war and the rapid development 
of long-range air travel broke down 
the isolation of the Arctic. Defence, 
meteorological and radio stations were 
established at a number of places. 
The situation of the Eskimo people 
became a matter of concern to the 
Canadian public. 
A high incidence of tuberculosis 
was discovered among the Eskimos, 
and epidemics of other diseases 
followed the greater contact with men 
from the south. The white fox market 
collapsed in 1949, creating serious 
hardship, and brought a rather belated 
realization that the Eskimos could no 
longer be treated as an isolated group. 
Steps would have to be taken to 
prepare them to take their place in a 
changing Arctic and eventually to be 
integrated into the Canadian economy. 
With this inevitable change the Eski- 
mos had three great needs—health, 
education and an economy that would 
support them. 
One essential fact of the Canadian 
Arctic in the mid-twentieth century 
was that change had come and come 
irrevocably. Another essential fact is 
that the Arctic as it was in the early 
1950s had to change again unless 
the Eskimos were to be condemned to 
slow exinction or permanent economic 
and social serfdom. 
The land would no longer support 
them. The caribou had declined alarm- 
ingly from about 600,000 to around 
175,000 in the five years from the end 
of the war to 1950. The white fox, sole 
Eskimo source of income, had dropped 
from $30 or more to about $5. The 
cost of store goods was rising. 
The Eskimos had learned to read 
and write using a simple syllabic script, 
but their source of reading was mostly 
religious material. In the English or 
French language they were 95 per cent 
illiterate. One in eight had active 
tuberculosis. This was the early 1950s 
and as the world was becoming more 
and more conscious of the needs of 
the developing nations, Canada was 
becoming equally conscious of the 
needs of its first Arctic citizens, the 
Eskimos. The jet age broke down 
barriers of distance and the isolation 
of an almost stone-age people. 
In the past decade great progress 
has been made in health care and all 
Eskimos now have regular medical 
examinations. Tuberculosis is a conti- 
nuing problem and although they are 
building up an immunity to other 
diseases introduced from the south 
they are still subject to many of these. 
One of the latest efforts made to 
raise the standard of living for Eski- 
mos and combat the adversities of a 
harsh environment was the federal 
government's approval in 1965 of a 
five-year rental housing programme. 
The aim was to provide suitable living 
accommodation to all Eskimos in the 
north according to family size and at 
a rent based on family economy and 
resources. The nomadic igloo-tent life 
of the Eskimos is now changing to a 
community one. 
One of the cornerstones of any 
framework of a positive social and 
economic structure is, of course, edu- 
cation. At the mid-century mark of 
1950, out of an Eskimo population of 
approximately 9,000 in the Northwest 
Territories, only 120 Eskimo children 
went full time to school. 
No Eskimos had reached matricu- 
lation, none had received a vocational 
training course, none could aspire to 
a job higher than trapping for the 
white man or being his interpreter.

### 49635: The Changing Canadian Eskimo: 'the development of the North is a historical process that cannot be reversed'

pNo intellectual attainment or career 
appeared open to the Eskimo people. 
Prior to this time many of the 
missionaries conducted classes in 
association with their missionary acti- 
vities. However, the percentage of 
children receiving any formal educa- 
tion was small when the federal 
system got underway around 1950. 
Additional schools or classrooms were 
built in the north each year. Today, 
after a short span of 20 years, over 
90 per cent of all school-age children 
are attending school regularly. 
The government is attempting to 
provide a system which will give the 
Eskimo people equality of educational 
opportunities with other Canadians. 
The language barrier and the problems 
of cultural dissimilarities have made it 
difficult to develop satisfactory curri- 
cula. 
The language chosen for the me- 
dium of instruction is English. In the 
lower grades, Eskimo teacher assistants 
ease beginners into school routine and 
help bridge the cultural gap. 
The development of the north 
requires skilled technical labour. 
Southern labour has been difficult to 
recruit and hold in the remote and 
harsh environment. Throughout the 
north, Eskimo men are being trained at 
various levels as miners, heavy equip- 
ment operators, plumbers, carpenters 
and mechanics. They hold positions 
as interpreters and clerks in retail and 
co-operative stores and in government 
offices. The government has set a 
desirable objective to fill 75 per cent of 
northern government positions with 
local residents by 1977. 
Young Eskimo girls are learning to 
become teachers, hairdressers, nurses’ 
aides and commercial cooks. They 
learn the techniques of homemaking 
in modern housing in home economic 
laboratories in nine Arctic communi- 
ties. Their classes include home 
management, child care, home nursing, 
nutrition and clothing. These courses 
are also available to adults with little 
or no formal education. 
There are many aspects to the 
education programme and one of the 
most important is adult education 
which, briefly, offers adults regardless 
of age or academic qualifications an 
opportunity to acquire new skills. lt is 
also designed to inform the older 
generation who may feel themselves 
cut off from their children in school. 
Eskimos are already involved in the 
search for and development of the 
mineral and oil wealth of the north, 
and a number have completed an oil- 
well drilling course in Alberta, and are 
now working in the High Arctic, in the 
oil industry. There is no doubt that 
the lives of many more Eskimos will 
change even more in the years imme- 
diately ahead as the accelerated pace 
of mineral development takes place. 
But all Eskimos will not be miners. 
As Canadians, many will choose to 
live in the south. With education 
comes mobility and with mobility comes 
32 
choice. This should be the ultimate 
objective of government policy—to 
provide a framework within which the 
Eskimo people may independently 
choose for themselves what kind of life 
they want to live and where they want 
to live it. 
For the traditional Eskimo there 
was but one choice—to live off the 
land, to move where the game was. 
For the Eskimo of today the options 
have increased from living off the land 
to accepting wage employment of 
some sort at the settlement and 
adjusting to the routine of settlement 
life. But the options are still limited. 
The hunting and trapping economy 
or the renewable resources of the 
north have always been limited in 
relation to outside markets rather than 
to the very much smaller local require- 
ments. It would seem that within the 
2.6 million square kilometres of the 
north and along the thousands of kilo- 
metres of coastline, there are certainly 
enough resources and potential re- 
sources to support a larger local 
population. This depends largely on 
locating the resources and improving 
the methods of harvesting them. 
One traditional activity that is still 
popular is the hunting of seals. This 
provides food and cash for the skins 
and confers prestige on the hunter, 
which is equally important at this stage 
of cultural change when the dominant 
figure in the Eskimo way of life is 
being threatened in so many ways. 
Associated with seal hunting is the

trapping of the white fox. Although 
the number of trappers will no doubt 
decline as more and more turn to 
other forms of wage employment, 
there will always be those who prefer 
to trap as long as there is a demand 
for white fox furs. Our estimation is 
that there are still about 1,000 families 
spread over a vast area who continue 
by choice and circumstances to live 
by a hunting and trapping economy. 
Many of these people derive their 
main cash income from the sale of 
seal and fox skins. 
Hunting, trapping and fishing are 
closely related to tourist promotion 
programmes involving Eskimos as 
guides and operators of sports lodges. 
The scenic and rugged beauty of the 
Arctic and the fish and game attract an 
increasing number of visitors to nor- 
thern Canada each year. 
Probably one of the most demand- 
ing adjustments and changes in the 
Eskimo way of life in recent years 1s 
urbanization. Today more and more 
families are leaving their small scatter- 
ed family camps and are settling in 
concentrated communities designed 
on the model of southern Canadian 
towns. 
The trading post® has become a 
general store and isolated settlements 
are organized communities in a nor- 
thern setting. This has led to a more 
sedentary way of life with all the 
amenities of a town such as municipal 
services, co-operative stores, schools, 
nursing stations or hospitals, churches,

good housing, opportunities of wage 
employment and other facilities for an 
active social life within the established 
town. The growth of these communi- 
ties, although bringing much that is 
good, has also meant a radical social 
adjustment for the Eskimo nomad now 
turned townsman. 
Accustomed to the unscheduled and 
independent life of the camp, some of 
those employed find it difficult to 
comply with certain work regulations 
and the discipline of a nine to five 
day. The head of the family who 
continues to hunt and trap may travel 
on a skidoo [small motorized sledge] 
instead of by the traditional dog team. 
He leaves his family in their permanent 
home and covers his trapline, ranging 
farther afield than in times past. 
Many people today still have roman- 
tic ideas about Eskimos: that they 
live in snow houses, eat raw meat and 
are pleasantly smiling, quaint people. 
This view is a particular weakness of 
writers prone to sensationalism after a 
week-end's visit to the Arctic. 
It seems to me that in all the contro- 
versial material written about the 
Canadian Eskimo people today (much 
of it ill-informed and much overly 
sentimental) there is a tendency to 
forget that Eskimos are not quaint 
curiosities. They are ordinary human 
beings living in a special environment. 
Even with the transition and cultural 
clashes of change they share much of 
the same fears and hopes of mankind, 
and as Canadians today in democratic 
society they are expressing themselves. 
There are many people who believe 
that the Eskimo should remain in a 
primitive state, and government plans 
for these people are often questioned. 
| think it is obvious, as Knud Ras- 
mussen, one of the greatest authorities 
on the Eskimos, said, that “when the 
hand of civilization touches a primitive 
people anywhere there is no turning 
back”. Therefore the benefits of accu- 
mulated human knowledge should be 
made available to all people as widely 
as possible. 
Another question often raised is: 
are people better off if they have 
more material possessions, educa- 
tion, increased life expectancy, better 
health, more help in adversity? The 
answer can only be yes, because 
these things are the material objects 
as distinct from the spiritual objects 
of human aspiration and these are the 
areas in which are framed our con- 
crete concepts of good, of morals and 
law. 
The core of the problem, however, 
lies in the concept of northern dev- 
elopment itself. The development of 
the north is a historical process which 
began in the past and is continuing 
into an unforeseeable future. For eco- 
nomic reasons alone, this process 
cannot be reversed. But there is an 
equally important aspect—the people. 
Pockets of human neglect are no more 
acceptable than are pockets of econo- 
mic neglect. The responsibility of 
society must express itself both in 
terms of resources and of people. 
In the north, the irony of the situa- 
tion is that resource development is 
not only the prerequisite for human 
development but also the major threat 
to social responsibility. The po- 
tential of the land is being developed 
by means of the best that modern 
technology has to offer. 
Where does this leave the people 
directly affected by such develop- 
ment? The concept of social respon- 
sibility precludes leaving the Eskimos 
to their traditional pursuits, a very 
unromantic life, regardless of the 
romantic picture that has been drawn 
by those who are blind to its hard- 
ships, its disease, the tragedy of death 
at a young age. Such attitudes would 
condemn them to nothing more than 
gradual extinction in the face of a 
technologically superior society from 
which they are excluded. 
The only course open is one which, 
in some way, fulfils the social respon- 
sibility in terms of the hard facts of 
economic development. To be a vital 
part of society involves more than 
becoming a cog in a machine, It invol- 
ves the concept of cultural identity and 
without this identity a large part of 
the human value of the nation is lost. 
It cannot function if it bears no rela- 
tion to the economic realities of 
Canadian life which surround it. nu

### 49640: A Statement on Israel by Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, Director-General of UNESCO

  
A Statement on Israel by Amadou Mahtar M’Bow 
Director-General of Unesco 
eports carried by press, radio 
and television on recent deci- 
sions by the eighteenth ses- 
sion of the General Conference 
of Unesco concerning Israel have frequently been lacking 
in accuracy and even objectivity. 
Two resolutions adopted by the General Conference 
chiefly concern Israel: the first refers to the composition 
of regional groups set up within the Organization; the second 
refers to the protection and preservation of the cultural 
heritage in Jerusalem. 
HM Because the resolution defining regions with a view 
to carrying out activities of a regional character has been 
interpreted incompletely or incorrectly, it. has been main- 
tained that Israel has been excluded from Unesco or denied 
the possibility of participating in its activities. 
Israel has neither been ousted from Unesco nor from any 
regional group within the Organization. Israel continues 
to be a member of Unesco, as one of the 135 Member States, 
which make up the Organization. 
Israel also continues to be listed, for elections to the Exec- 
utive Board, in Group | (Western Europe) onthe same footing 
as Australia, Canada, the United States of America and New 
Zealand, which are situated geographically outside of 
Europe. 
During the eighteenth session of the General Conference, 
Israel, like Canada and the United States of America, intro- 
duced a draft resolution with a view to being included 
“in the list of countries entitled to participate in the Euro- 
pean regional activities in which the representative character 
of States is an important factor.” While the resolutions 
referring to Canada and the United States were adopted, 
the one tabled by Israel was rejected by the General Con- 
ference, that is, by the duly accredited representatives of 
the governments of the Member States of Unesco. 
Thus, Israel is in exactly the same situation it was in prior 
to the eighteenth session of the General Conference. It 
therefore cannot be argued that it has been ousted from 
anything at all; the only new fact is that Israel is now the 
only Member State not to be included in one of the regions 
"with a view to the execution of regional activities”, since 
Australia and New Zealand, at the proposal chiefly of five 
Asian countries, have been listed in the Asia and Oceania 
group, while Canada and the United States (at their request) 
have been listed in the Western European group. 
Canada and the United States, | should recall, had requested 
—unsuccessfully—at the seventeenth session of the General 
Conference in 1972 to participate in the Second Conference 
of . Ministers of Education of European Member. States. 
At that time nobody, either in Canada, or the United States, 
much less in Europe, accused Unesco of having excluded 
them from any regional group whatsoever. Thus, these 
countries have, like Israel, taken part in the conference held - 
at Bucharest in December 1973 as ohservers.. This possibility 
is open at all times to Israel should a ministerial conference" 
again be convened in Europe. In the same way, Israel can 
participate as an observer, as it has.done in the ‘past, at 
any regional conference of ministers no matter where it is 
held. 
BH The second resolution “invites the Director-General 
to withhold assistance from Israel in the fields of education, 
science and culture until such time as it scrupulously respects 
the resolutions and decisions” of the Executive Board and 
the General Conference. . 
This resolution is based essentially on resolutions 2253 
of 4 July 1967 and 2254 of 14 July 1967 of the United Nations 
General Assembly and resolutions 267 of 3 July 1969 and 
298 of 25 September 1971 of the United Nations Security 
Council on the status of Jerusalem, as well as on the decisions 
of the Unesco General Conference at its fifteenth and seven- 
teenth sessions and of the Unesco Executive Board at 
its 82nd, 83rd, 88th, 89th and 90th sessions. When it adopted   
a new resolution, the General Conference considered that 
the Israeli Government had not heeded the urgent appeals 
made to it since 1968 calling on it to "desist fromanyarchaeo- 
logical excavations in the city of Jerusalem and from any 
modifications of its features or its cultural and historical 
character, particularly with regard to Christian and Islamic 
religious sites.” Noting that the excavations and works were 
continuing which it considered susceptible of endangering 
the Christian and Islamic sites, the. General Conference 
decided six years after issuing its first notification, to 
condemn the attitude of Israel, which it considered “contra- 
dictory to the aims of the Organization as stated in its 
Constitution...” 
I wish to stress that in reaffirming all the prior resolutions 
concerning Jerusalem the General Conference again explicitly 
invited the Director-General to ‘* continue his efforts to 
establish the effective presence of Unesco in the city of 
Jerusalem.” 
Such are the facts. | hope they will permit the general 
public to form a fairer and more accurate opinion of the 
resolutions adopted by the General Conference at its eigh- 
teenth session. Similar decisions have been taken in the 
past without giving rise to the reactions of these last few 
weeks. 
There has been reference to the “politization of Unesco”, 
as if the agencies of the United Nations system had not in 
fact been born of a political determination to found a just 
and durable peace by contributing to the general progress 
of humanity and to strengthening understanding and co- 
operation among all peoples. Unesco is composed of almost 
the same Member States as the United Nations. The delegates 
to its General Conference are government representatives. 
It is therefore natural that the problems which perturb the 
world today should find an echo there. 
For my own part, as | had occasion to say at the close of 
the eighteenth session of the General Conference. | think 
that, in an Organization devoted to education. science and 
culture, we must avoid those conflicts which take on the 
character of systematic confrontations.” We should perhaps 
also avoid the adoption of resolutions, even with large 
majorities, that could result in deep bitterness in certain 
quarters. The golden rule for an organization such as Unesco 
should always be the search for a consensus through patient 
and open dialogue. 
That is why, as the newly elected Director-General, who 
had not taken part in the discussions which went on long 
before my election, | indicated to the General Conference 
my firm intention —if so authorized— to speak out henceforth 
and whenever it is necessary, in order to try to reconcile 
different points of view so as to reach the widest: possible 
agreement. 
| therefore regret that on the basis of information which 
is to say the least incomplete and often distorted, certain 
eminent persons have thought fit to adopt such uncompro- 
mising attitudes, although thinkers and scholars might be 
expected to be more .inclined to.discussion and dialogue. 
I think it.is appropriate to recall that for nearly 30 years 
Unesco has been engaged in_a vast undertaking. in its fields 
of competence, with the help of men and women of all ori- 
gins and all creeds for_the good of the international com- 
munity, and that today in the Unesco Secretariat itself men 
and women from more than 100 Member States—including 
Israel—are joined in a-common ‘effort. 
| am firmly convinced that it should always be possible 
for Unesco—if only interested States agree to workalong with 
it—to ‘overcome the tensions which hinder international 
co-operation and understanding in its fields of competence. 
But this presupposes that the norms and rules established 
by the Organization should not be considered a dead letter 
each time they conflict with specific interests.
