Time and time over. 
They are to be happy in: 
Where can we live -but days?

Ctl triad 
N December 10 this year 
d, Unesco’s Paris headquart- 
ers will become fora day an 
international forum from which a 
score of poets from every corner of 
the globe will speak out through 
their poems against the never- 
resting forces of oppression and 
destruction, a platform from which 
the mingled voices of peace, poetry 
and liberty can declare “War on 
War’. : 
To our great regret, limitations of 
space and time preclude publication 
of works by all those taking part in 
this symposium. Nevertheless, in 
the works of twelve of the par- 
ticipating poets presented in this 
issue of the Unesco Courier, some   
hitherto unpublished, despite dif- 
Jerences of tone, emphasis and 
cultural background, and despite 
the clouding veil of translation, the 
anguished, universal voice of the 
poet can be heard, denouncing war 
and pleading for fraternity and 
peace. 
The centenaries of three other 
poets are also honoured in this 
issue—those of Subramania 
Bharati, the great Tamil writer who 
Sought for but did not live to see his 
country’s independence, and Yanka 
Kupala and Yakub Kolas, both also 
sturdy fighters for freedom and 
democracy who have earned the 
title of ‘fathers’ of Byelorussian 
literature. 
Nor could the Unesco Courier 
allow the year 1982 to elapse without 
marking the anniversaries of two 
other great figures—St. Francis of 
Assisi whose 800-year-old message, 
as the Italian writer Carlo Bo points 
out, is still applicable today, and the 
Polish composer Karol Szymanow- 
ski whose music is now being ac- 
corded the renewed recognition it 
deserves. 
Finally, we pay all too brief 
tribute to the memory of the Cuban 
painter Wifredo Lam, who died in 
September this year, and whose 
works exude the electrifying creative 
force generated by theencounter of 
different cultures.

The walls, gardens, and courtyards of Unesco’s Paris Headquarters are a 
showcase for a number of artistic masterpieces which have been donated to 
the Organization. Among the works which can be admired by visitors and staff 
members alike are a Calder mobile, murals by Picasso and Glazunov, ceramics 
by Miré, sculptures by Moore, Giacometti and Soto, and a mural by Matta. But 
Unesco is also the home of many other works of art which are equally note- 
worthy. In this issue of the Unesco Courier, on pages 4 to 21, we present a 
selection of these works. Above, modern figurative statue represents a human 
being reflecting on the world (Peru).

Unesco we have accepted the chal- 
lenge implicit in the incursion of 
poetry into an official institution. Qur 
task has not been without difficulties, but 
the challenge is commensurate with the 
great importance poetry should have and 
the role it should play in a world in per- 
manent crisis where the fight for 
culture—never won, and the fight for 
liberty—never ended, are one. The 
delayed effects of this incursion may be 
considerable, especially since poetry 
festivals are today experiencing a 
remarkable revival in some parts of the 
world, perhaps because of the collapse 
of so many cultural, religious and 
political values which had been thought 
to be sound. 
I N organizing a poetry evening at 
The idea was simple and inspiring: that 
the vision and language of the poet as 
such should be presented without con- 
straint or censorship on the stage of 
Unesco, which is by definition supra- 
national. We wanted to provide an op- 
portunity for poetry, with all its spirit, 
rigour, passion, and complexity, to be 
read aloud to an audience by its authors 
in a prestigious setting. 
This is the first time that so many great 
poets of different cultures from all over 
the world, chosen solely on the grounds 
of their intellectual quality, have 
gathered for an event of such importance 
in such surroundings. The great literary 
voices of our time are rarely heard 
beyond the narrow bounds within which 
creative and utopian thought is confin- 
ed both in the highly industrialized coun- 
tries and in the developing world. The 
societies where shamans and prophets 
were actually listened to have virtually 
ceased to exist. } 
The men and women invited to take 
part in this event are here in their own 
right—not as representatives of nations, 
ethnic groups, political parties, churches, 
tribes or classes. The concerns of poetry 
go far beyond the affiliations of the 
citizen who is often engaged, moreover, 
in a social struggle. The poet is above all 
an extraordinary being, an inventor of 
language who dares to think the un- 
thinkable and say the unsaid. Every 
poem begins by overstepping the bounds, 
the blockages and the alienations which 
JEAN-JACQUES LEBEL, French writer and 
theatre and film director, is the author of several 
books including: La Poésie de la Beat Genera- 
tion (Poetry of the Beat Generation), Le Hap- 
pening (The Happening) and L'Amour et 
I'Argent (Love and Money). He is also the 
founder of the international Polyphonix festival. 
On behalf of Unesco he has organized the “War 
on War"* manifestation of poets to be held at 
Unesco headquarters, Paris.

reduce most of humanity to despair and 
silence. On this occasion, the poets will 
propose visionary alternatives to the pro- 
grammed massacres and planned cata- 
strophes which militaristic futurologists 
and multinational arms purveyors are 
seeking to impose on all peoples. 
Essentially poetry ought not to raise 
eyebrows in an institution which sets 
itself the goal of ending the hegemony of 
ignorance. The least to be expected is that 
the structural crisis which permanently 
convulses all the nations both in their 
cultural and their economic life should 
overturn some old habits. It is not those 
who express themselves in poetry but 
those who wield the language of war who 
endanger the survival of mankind. It is 
not going too far to say that poetry may 
bring (if only for an experimental period) 
“imagination to power”’. If poetry is still 
there, at the very heart of the questions 
facing society, it is because the other 
forms of expression—scientific, poli- 
“tical, religious, and administrative— 
and the other systems of belief, percep- 
tion and expression, have proved in- 
capable of comprehending the present 
world crisis. 
Meanwhile, poetry uses this crisis as its 
raw material, drawing its legitimacy from 
its rejection of idées recues, high-flown 
speeches, dogmatic lectures, the wooden 
diction of power, the babel of the media, 
and the dominance of cultural mediocrity 
universalized by the audio-visual media. 
Poetry dissents from industrial norms 
and customs, it opens up a royal road, 
"the adventure of the indomitable and 
sovereign spirit. The poet’s work restores 
to its adepts the use of a different kind 
of word and language, and allows the in- 
dividual to accept his individuality, an in- 
dispensable role in an age of mass 
phenomena and "automation. In the 
nuclear age it is still possible as it was in 
Antiquity, both in East and West, in 
Africa or the Americas, thanks to poetry 
tolearn or learn again how to think free- 
ly. It is here that the objectives of modern 
poetry and those of Unesco are not 
irreconcilable, 
The Director-General of Unesco, Mr. 
Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow, isto be thank- 
ed for having welcomed this initiative and 
for giving a score of such diverse poets 
an opportunity to declare together War 
on War, to set the ethic of philosophy 
against military aggression, whatever its 
source and whatever its pretext. Perhaps 
this will encourage those who love peace 
in all countries to join forces against the 
criminal logic of those who kill. Perhaps 
this event will inspire the awareness and 
the process of reflection which is the basis 
of poetic activity. |   
I know thee... 
I know thee O image of terror 
I discern thy endless wilderness 
My fear-racked tomorrow, and on my cheeks 
Stains of the murdered sky 
The prints of my two hands 
I spell thee out, I revive the flame of thy visage 
I squeeze a cry from each reluctant letter 
I embrace the lynx and the raven 
I embrace the dead 
Wakened they leave the sod resuscitated 
As ant or book reincarnate 
Willingly I wash them 
With my tomorrow or my yesterday 
True to myself 
I outstrip 
I fashion the others

Faith All people have their own space 
Breathing is life pulsating 
Whether for happiness or sorrow 
We are always waiting, hoping for something 
The desert has its camel bells 
The ocean its siren blasts 
A motorbike rides through the street 
Each bears a different message 
Where is paradise? There is no paradise 
Or else it’s a minority’s freehold 
But we—the humble creatures of the earth 
Have nought but the faith that yearns in our hearts 
But faith itself is dynamic 
Sometimes pulling us forward 
Or pushing us into pursuit 
Remaining ever remote 
We are opposed to war 
As people daily shed their blood in sacrifice 
We beseech an end to hunger 
As millions from hunger perish 
Nation against nation 
Class against class 
Religion against religion 
Close in battle every passing day 
What obscure hand’s operation 
Turns us powerless and weak, 
Can’t we gather up our splendid faiths 
"In a blazing volcanic explosion 
Thrusting aloft the whole world 
Like bright clouds ascending the sky 
Turning fantasies into reality 
Creating a genuine paradise?

The life 
of the soil 
Blessed are the children of Dimbaza, 
of Welcome Valley, Limehill and Stinkwater 
they die 
of sickness, malnutrition, poverty— 
for they beautify the prospect for the master’s eye 
Jor they escape the jaws of hell 
for they clear the Boer’s domains 
—the Boer and his God— 
—the hand of God— 
for they are spared from living 
for to be black is a political provocation 
for you who are black 
in the land of blood 
of the passbook and the insult of the police dog, 
you pollute the land of the Boers 
Blessed are the children of Dimbaza 
of Welcome Valley, Limehill and Stinkwater 
cast down 
into the pits, a feast for ants, 
a black-toothed smile— 
Sor they receive toys and empty milk-bottles 
to furbish their tombs, 
toys and silver paper rustling in the wind, 
milk-bottles—dried up teats—from which the wind 
can conjure sounds 
a lure for moles 
—for meat is rare— 
so that the brats forget 
that they are dead 
blessed are the dead of Dimbaza 
of Welcome Valley, Limehill and Stinkwater 
swallowed up 
by the earth, for their comings and goings 
pass unremarked between mouthfuls 
casting no shadow in the sunlight 
blessed and holy and sanctified are the moles 
the worms and the ants 
in the land of the sun 
in the land of the Boers 
in the land the Masters have given them 
for they enrich and beautify the grasslands 
so that man flourishes and prospers 
grows the fruits of the earth and raises his cattle 
waxes fine and strong and white 
to the glory of his God

The youngsters 
of La Prensa 
In the daily photo line-ups in La Prensa they appear 
stretched out 
Eyes half closed, half-parted lips 
As if in laughter, as if in pleasure 
The youngsters of the list of shame 
Or else from stamp-sized passport snaps they stare 
Serious, deadly serious, 
The boys who daily swelled the roll of horror 
This one went for a neighbourhood stroll 
They found him cast aside on a rough patch of wasteland 
This one set off to work from his home in the San Judas district 
And never returned 
Then there was the one who went to buy a Coke at the corner 
The one who went to see his girl-friend and never came back 
Others snatched from their homes 
carried off in army jeeps that disappeared into the night 
And later found at the morgue 
Or at the roadside in the Cuesta del Plomo 
Or on a rubbish dump 
Arms broken 
Eyes gouged out, tongue severed, genitals torn off 
Or who simply were never seen again 
Those kidnapped by patrols of the Macho Negro or the Cara’e Leon 
And cast heaped up beside the lake behind the Teatro Dario 
Of their faces nothing remains 
But a bright-eyed glance, a smile, reduced to flat paper 
Tiny pasteboard squares their mothers expose like treasure in La Prensa 
(An image engraved on the heart’s core, on the dear little pasteboard) 
The one with the shock of hair 
The one with the frightened-deer eyes 
The one with the roguish smile 
The girl with the melancholy gaze 
One in profile or with head inclined 
One pensive, one with open shirt

Others with curls, with hair over face, with a beret 
Another, blurred, smiling out from under curlers 
In graduation garb 
The lass with smiling lips and puckered brow 
The girl in the photo sent to her betrothed 
The posing boy in the photo given to his fiancée 
20, 22, 18, 17, 15 years old 
Young people killed for being young because 
In Nicaragua it was illegal to be between 15 and 25 
And it seemed that Nicaragua would be bereft of youth 
Even after the victory I was surprised 
When greeted at a gathering by a youth 
to find myself asking wordlessly: ‘‘How did you escape?’’ 
For once we were afraid of young survivors 
You whom the guards seized, the “Beloved of the gods” 
As the Greeks used to say, those whom the gods love die young 
Others will grow old, but yet, for them, the beloved ones 
Will stay forever fresh and young 
Smooth-browed, hair ungraying 
The fair-haired Roman girl who died, in memory stays ever fair 
Yet you, I say, are not of those who do not age 
simply because they stay young in the brief memory 
Of others who one day will die 
You will stay young because there will always be young people in Nicaragua 
And because of your deaths, you the countless victims of the daily slaughter, 
The young people of Nicaragua will always be revolutionaries 
In them you will live again, your lives perpetually renewed 
New again, as each day’s dawn is new.

Stockpiling in the ad fro of the earth 
The stockpiling of dead animals 
in the exhaust pipes of supersonic rockets 
The stockpiling of desiccated plants 
on the death root of an abscessed tooth 
The stockpiling of defoliants

Stockpiles

Look at it

through the multiple vaccines belching in the veins 
through the cross-infection of viruses stockpiled 
in the mouth 
through the benzine vapors shooting 
into the muscles of the stars 
through the gaseous bowels of military fantasies 
through the white radiation of delirious dreams 
Look 
this stockpile marries that stockpile 
to mix and release a double stockpile of fissions 
exploding 
into the shadows of disappearing space 
Global incapacitations

This is the nuclear bleach of reality 
. the inflated thigh of edema 
the filthy dampness in the scientific pants 
of a peace prize 
the final stockpile of flesh dancing in

And even if you think you have a shelter 
that can survive this stockpiling 
of communal graves 
tell me

Where are you going \ 
with the sucked liver of mustard flint 
the split breath of hydrogen fumes 
the navel pit of invisible clams 
the biological lung of human fleas 
the carcinogenic bladder of sponges 
words made of keloid scars 
poems in the numb section of the chromosomes 
Just where do you think you’re going 
- with that stockpile of contaminated stink 
Listen 
When I think of the tactical missiles plunging 
into the rancid goiters of the sun 
The artillery shells of wiretapping snakes hissing and vomiting 
into the depths of a colorless sky 
The accumulation of fried phosphoric pus graffittied 
on the fragile fierceness of the moon 
The pestering warheads of death-wings stockpiling feathers 
in the brain 
And the mass media’s larval of lies stockpiled 
in the plasma of the ears 
And the stockpiling of foreign sap in the fluxes 
of the blood 
And the stockpiling of shattered spines 
in chromium suits 
under polyurethane sheets 
I look at this stockpiling 
at this rotting vegetation 
and I make myself understand the target 
That’s why I say I'm into life 
preservation of life now 
revolutionary change now 
before the choking 
before the panic 
before the penetration of apathy rises up 
and spits fire 
into the toxic tears 
of this stockpile

Torture 
Poem © Jean-Pierre Faye 
Translated from the French 
I serve notice on all points of the circle of the day 
of news which is brought to me hammering 
of torturing points from as far away as can be reported 
and beatings, neighbours of mine even in their danger 
even in kinship with iron no longer endured 
when their quadrilateral snaps at the edges 
and I shall not cease from watching while they break the edges 
nor from listening while near and far they shroud the day 
and I shall try to bear word of what is not endured : 
I shall not muffle the earpiece while I hear the sound of hammering 
I shall listen to all that endures domination and danger 
and comes to me from the torturing points reported 
Jrom opposite points on the circle by that which is reported 
I shall hear the broken messenger from the place of the broken edges 
where they are scattered and cast to the winds and in danger 
where night is abolished after all the points of day 
where the blows can no longer be heard on her hammering 
50 you turn deaf ears to that which is no longer endured 
here we shall wait for news of that which is no longer endured 
and we shall hear and endure the details reported 
letting them drill us, assail us, hammering 
I shall outstretch my fingers to the bruised soft edges 
head in the night yet walking on the day 
in places where they are downtrodden and in danger 
and if they are bound or threatened by danger 
even shattered by news that cannot be endured 
hear it pattering across night and day 
bearing the unbearable assault of what is reported 
putting the hand in the wound of the edge 
where the bruise has come back wounding and hammering 
I shall hear the report, I shall go to it hammering 
raising before the lordship of danger 
the hand at the root of the wound in the edge 
and the eyes unblinking at that which can be endured 
hearing them come from all points tortured and reported 
the bodies that are spring and sustenance of the day

Plutonian ode 
(excerpt) 
Radioactive Nemesis were you there at the beginning 
black Dumb tongueless unsmelling blast of Disillusion? 
I manifest your Baptismal Word after four billion years 
I guess your birthday in Earthling Night, I salute your 
dreadful presence lasting majestic as the Gods, 
Sabaot, Jehova, Astapheus, Adonaeus, Elohim, lao, 
Ialdabaoth, Aeon from Aeon born ignorant in an 
Abyss of Light, ) 
Sophia’s reflections glittering thoughtful galaxies, 
whirlpools of starspume silver-thin as hairs of Einstein! 
Father Whitman I celebrate a matter that renders Self 
oblivion! 
Grand Subject that annihilates inky hands & pages’ 
prayers, old orators’ inspired Immortalities, 
I begin your chant, openmouthed exhaling into spacious 
sky over silent mills at Hanford, Savannah River, 
Rocky Flats, Pantex, Burlington, Albuquerque 
I yell thru Washington, South Carolina, Colorado, 
Texas, Iowa, New Mexico, 
where nuclear reactors create a new Thing under the 
Sun, where Rockwell war-plants fabricate this death 
stuff trigger in nitrogen baths, 
Hanger-Silas Mason assembles the terrified weapon 
secret by ten thousands, & where Manzano Mountain boasts to store 
its dreadful decay through two hundred forty millennia 
while our Galaxy spirals around its nebulous core. 
I enter your secret places with my mind, I speak with 
your presence, I roar your Lion Roar with mortal 
mouth. 
One microgram inspired fo one lung, ten pounds of 
heavy metal dust adrift slow motion over grey 
Alps 
the breadth of the planet, how long before your radiance 
speeds blight and death to sentient beings? 
Enter my body or not I carol my spirit inside you, 
Unapproachable Weight, 
O heavy heavy Element awakened I vocalize your consciousness to six worlds 
I chant your absolute Vanity. Yeah monster of Anger birthed in fear O most 
Ignorant matter ever created unnatural to Earth! Delusion 
of metal empires! : e000

eee Destroyer of lying Scientists! Devourer of covetous 
Generals, Incinerator of Armies & Melter of Wars! 
Judgement of judgements, Divine Wind over vengeful 
nations, Molester of Presidents, Death-Scandal of 
Capital politics! Ah civilizations stupidly industrious! 
Canker-Hex on multitudes learned or illiterate! 
Manufactured Spectre of human reason! O solidified 
imago of practitioners in Black Arts 
I dare your Reality, I challenge your very being! 
I publish your cause and effect! 
I turn the Wheel of Mind on your three hundred tons! 
Your name enters mankind’s ear! I embody your ultimate powers! 
My oratory advances on your vaunted Mystery! 
This breath dispels your braggart fears! I sing your form at last 
behind your concrete & iron walls inside your fortress 
of rubber & translucent silicon shields in Jiltered 
cabinets and baths of lathe oil, 
My voice resounds through robot glove boxes & ingot 
cans and echoes in electric vaults inert of atmosphere, 
I enter with spirit out loud into your fuel rod drums 
underground on soundless thrones and beds of lead 
O density! This weightless anthem trumpets transcendent 
through hidden chambers and breaks through 
iron doors into the Infernal Room! 
Over your dreadful vibration this measured harmony 
floats audible, these jubilant tones are honey and milk and wine-sweei water 
Poured on the stone block floor, these syllables are 
barley groats I scatter on the Reactor’s core, 
I call your name with hollow vowels, I psalm your Fate 
close by, my breath near deathless ever at your side 
to Spell your destiny, I set this verse prophetic on your 
mausoleum walls to seal you up Eternally with 
Diamond Truth! O doomed Plutonium.

A farewell 
to hormones 
.Poem © Sony Labou Tan’si 
Translated from the French 
A man of dust 
With eyes of dust 
Ever fixed on the sun 
Teeth of dust 
Wherein lurk powder-flies 
A dusty sprayed-on smile 
Skin of dust 
Rocketed to the outworn moon 
Of racism 
Apollo ninety-three 
Made in Madness 
Made in Hatred 
Made in Vanity 
The dust of shame 
The hollow laugh of silence 
Falling on man woman and child 
On your hunter’s powder-horn 
On your lipstick civilization 
On your heart-shaming technology 
On your Herculean labouring 
To construct 
This monstrosity of monstrosities 
And then to die 
Tied to the assembly-line 
Death is no longer to die 
And to die is not even to bid 
A last farewell to hormones

### 50945: Poetry before and after Hiroshima

Poetry before 
and 
after Hiroshima 
by Stephen Spender 
ning to bear in mind when considering the attitude 
of poets to war. 
Historically they have been, to say the least, ambivalent 
about it. War forms the subject of most epic poetry and of much 
poetic drama, including Shakespeare’s historical plays, and 
Troilus and Cressida. In Troilus and Cressida, it is true, the 
Grecian warriors are depicted as half-wits, war as senseless 
violence. But in the highly patriotic historical plays war is 
patriotism incandescent, soldiers are, for the most part, man- 
ly and heroic. 
In the past, indeed right up to the First World War, war has 
had great appeal for poets. Vergil begins the Aeneid with the 
words ‘Arma virumque cano”’ (I sing of arms and the man) 
connecting arms with man, almost as though men become most 
man in war. War in poetry is traditionally a kind of stripping 
those who fight down to the essential man, like nudes in 
painting. - 
€ P OETS adore ruins,’’ Auden wrote, and this is a war- 
The reason why poets have been so attracted by war is 
because it provides experiences of actual living in which 
people are reduced to the elemental conditions of their existing: 
death; the sense of being at once isolated and belonging to a 
community; the cause worth living and dying for, 
camaraderie—war provides a terrible testing in which, through 
being made aware of their courage or cowardice men realize 
some significant truth about the quality of their own physical 
and spiritual nature which would never be revealed in years 
of peace. 
Poets, when they are being poets and not just like other men, 
see life in relation to these ultimate realities. However, most 
people do not do so, except in times of crisis. They spend most 
of their lives living from day to day, occupied on the treadmill 
of work or being what is called ‘“worldly’’, impervious to the 
ultimate realities of human existence. 
But war is a situation in which everyone, or nearly everyone, 
is brought face to face with life and death. Thus it breaks down 
the barriers between the poet and the public, poetry and the 
about a world of whose existence the great majority of people 
STEPHEN SPENDER is a noted English poet who first won recognition 
in the 1930s as one of a group of writers and poets including his friend 
W.H. Auden. He is also the author of criticism, drama, fiction/transia- 
tions and an autobiography World Within World (1951). His most recent 
book is The Thirties and After: Poetry, Politics, People, published by Mac- 
Millan, London in 1978.

are scarcely aware. But if, in times of war, a poet writes about 
heroism, destruction, faith, the sacred cause, religious need, 
camaraderie, people recognize their own condition in his 
poems. War can indeed produce the sensation of life itself, as 
Tolstoy in his epic War and Peace, shows in his description 
of Prince Andrew lying wounded on the battlefield and con- 
templating hisown death. War also has given peoples the sense 
of sharing a common dream of their nationhood. The Aeneid 
is about the dream of Rome shared by the soldiers and fighters 
living and dying for it under the leadership of Aeneas, who is 
the pattern of military and civic virtues. 
Nevertheless, poets in the past whilst being very open to the 
attraction of war as a kind of lived and shared poetic drama 
have, in the long run, been repelled and disgusted by it. They 
have seen that it leads to terrible human suffering, senseless 
brutality, the breaking up of ties of affection between families 
and friends, and the destruction of those maintained condi- 
tions of civilization which are the essential basis of art. Civiliza- 
tion requires peace, and ultimately, war leads to barbarism. 
The Iliad ends in dust and ashes. In Shakespeare’s Henry VI 
there is a terrible scene of civil war in which a father finds dead 
on the battlefield the corpse of an enemy which, when he turns 
it over, he discovers to be that of his own son: a scene perhaps 
echoed by the greatest English poet of the First World War— 
Wilfred Owen—in his poem Strange Meeting, where im- 
mediately after his death a soldier has a conversation with a 
fellow soldier killed in battle at the same instant as he himself 
was killed, who at the end of the poem says, ‘I am the enemy 
you killed, my friend.” 
Historically I think then that poets have vacillated betweeen 
praise for war, because it makes people conscious of finalities, 
and revulsion at the brutality, rapine, waste, boredom, destruc- 
tion and corruption. In the First World War the poets passed 
rapidly from the phase of seeing the war as an awakening from 
the leaden materialist lethargy of the late nineteenth century, 
with its values of scientific and industrial ‘‘progress’’, to the 
phase of horror and disgust at the killing and destruction, and 
_ the boredom. 
In 1914, in Germany, Rilke, the least militarist of poets, saw 
war as a great upsurge of sacred life against the materialist cen- 
tury, just as in England Rupert Brooke saw it as a cleansing 
from the moral decadence of the England of the early part of 
the twentieth century. Inthe sonnets Brooke wrote at the out- 
break of the war he characterized the young Englishmen who 
rushed to offer their lives to their country as ‘‘swimmers into 
cleanness leaping’’.

### 50945: Poetry before and after Hiroshima

But the immense scale of the destruction soon put an end 
to this. By 1916 the two best English poets fighting in the 
trenches— Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon—were writing 
poems describing the horror, destruction and suffering pro- 
duced by the war and attacking the triumph of the hideous war 
machine over the humanity of the soldiers fighting on the 
Western front, the wickedness of the political leaders on both 
sides who did nothing to stop the slaughter, the callous insen- 
sitivity of old men and civilians at home who accepted com- 
placently the sacrifice of the lives of the young. 
These poets divided the English into the heroic victims, who 
were the soldiers at the front, and the scarcely conscious 
civilians of the home base. They no longer cared whether the 
victims were English, French or German soldiers. For them 
the real enemies were not the German soldiers but the 
militarists, politicians and arms manufacturers on both sides. 
When Sassoon and Owen, and other officers like them, went 
home on leave, they found that they hated their civilian fellow 
Englishmen. They no longer felt that England was home. Home 
was their fellow soldiers on the Western front. They had come 
to hate war and knew themselves to be pacifists, yet more im- 
portant to them than their pacifism was that, so long as the 
fighting continued, they should endure horrors with their fellow 
soldiers, 
In this one can see that, despite their detestation of war, the 
poets did feel that the suffering resultant from it had made the 
soldiers in the trenches, whether English, French or German, 
superior to those who did not fight. Here was a remnant of 
the feeling that war brings out human virtues in those who par- 
ticipate in it. To Wilfred Owen, every soldier was Christ. 
This attitude of the English war poets became a kind of poetic 
orthodoxy which lasted into the Second World War in which 
many poets fought while hating war yet feeling that they should 
share the camaraderie and agony of fellow soldiers. Anti- 
fascism—the fact that they were fighting in defence of in- 
dividual freedom against Hitlerism—perhaps qualified this at- 
titude, but not very much. The poetry of anti-fascism was not 
written by combatant poets in the armies of the democracies 
but by poets of the resistance, such as Aragon and Eluard, in 
France. 
Hiroshima entirely altered all this. From June 1945 onwards 
there was no more soldier/pacifist poetry. War had become 
totally dehumanized. The only poetry that could be written 
  
about war now was about’ the total inhumanity of the 
technology which could destroy whole cities, countries, perhaps 
the world as we know it. The anti-war poetry of today is that 
of man almost helpless against the totally destructive powers 
of his own inventing. It is written'with certainty that there can 
be no heroic, just, comradely phase of any future war. War 
now means nothing but destruction. The threat of the extinct- 
ion of all civilized values, perhaps of the human race and all 
life on earth. 
The poetry of poets who try to write about this situation 
seems to be mainly of two kinds. Firstly, that of poets who make 
metaphors of destruction, as does Jayne Cortez here in her 
poem ‘‘Stockpiling’’: 
The stockpiling of frozen trees 
in the deep freeze of the earth 
the stockpiling of dead animals 
in the exhaust pipes of supersonic rockets 
the stockpiling of desiccated plants 
ele. 
It is a magnificent effort to make poetry out of total in- 
humanity, the metaphors having the effect of making the forces 
of nuclear destruction accessible to the imagination. But when, 
at the end of the poem, Cortez declares: 
I look at this stockpiling 
at this rotting vegetation 
and I make myself understand the target 
that’s why I say I’m into life 
preservation of life now 
revolutionary change now 
it is not wholly convincing. The poet has been all too suc- 
cessful in inventing metaphors for the inhuman scientific pro- 
gress of destruction for us to feel that “being into life’’ has 
much chance to save the world; and ‘‘revolutionary change” 
seems almost pathetically vague. On the other hand, what alter- 
native to the technological inhumanity is there except brave 
assertions of life and humanity? We find these in the beautifully 
sensitive ‘‘Football Player’’ of Kazuko Shiraishi and in the 
declarations of faith in humanity of Ferlinghetti : 
...and I am awaiting 
perpetually and forever 
a renaissance of wonder 
Anti-war poetry is not only against war, It states the predica- 
ment of life against destructive technology |

### 50949: To be called men'; Kupala and Kolas, poets of liberty

“TO BE CALLED MEN’ 
Kupala and Kolas, poets of liberty 
were turbulent, shaking the 
feudal order to its foundations. 
Harbinger of freedom and democracy, 
the wind of change swept over 
Byelorussia, fanning the hopes of the 
millions living in desperate poverty and 
backwardness, in what was familiarly 
T HE years between 1905 and 1907 
known as “that godforsaken corner’’ of 
the Tsar’s domains. 
It was during the same period, at the . 
height of the revolutionary storm, that 
two voices were heard, shouting into the 
wind the pent-up, centuries-old anger of 
the peasants against their oppressors, and 
proclaiming their demand for a radical 
new order of things. The voices belong- 
ed tothe young poets Yanka Kupala and 
Yakub Kolas, whose centenary is being 
celebrated in 1982. 
My bread is the fruit of my own toil, 
I endure insults, the voices shouting at 
me. 
Holidays? I hardly know what they 
I’m just a peasant, a miserable 
muzhik. 
But today and tomorrow, and for the 
rest of my days, 
Long though my life may be, or 
short, 
There’s one thing, brothers, I'll not 
forget. 
A peasant I may be, but a man, too. 
These lines by Kupala are echoed 
by Kolas: 
Muzhik, it’s true, but no fool, for al 
that; 
I know my day will come. 
Quiet though I may be now, not 
daring to answer back, 
One of these days Ill 
Shout, Brothers! to arms! 
With such protests, Kupala and Kolas 
broke the silence which had been impos- 
ed for so long on the downtrodden 
Byelorussian peasantry, articulating the 
conditions of their daily life, their cares 
and suffering: the hungry springtimes 
when the last crumb of bread had been 
eaten; the mare staggering with exhaus- 
tion in the shafts; the wailing children; 
the worn-out and emaciated women,

~ ““My tongue is as dry as a bone in my 
mouth’, says one verse, and another: 
“Poor devils, we are, our heads in the 
noose... work in the fields... tears at 
home...”’ 
Itisnot hard to understand the impor- 
tance of the role played by the verse of 
Kupala and Kolas—linked as closely as 
it was to their people’s aspirations and 
to the problems of their time—in the 
renaissance of Byelorussian letters. A 
renaissance indeed, because although the 
country had a long literary tradition 
reaching back to the early sixteenth cen- 
tury, with its origins in the works of the 
great humanist and philosopher Frantisk 
Skorina, it had also been condemned by 
history to along, dark age of occupation 
by the Poles during which all printed mat-" 
ter in the Byelorussian language was pro- 
hibited and the feudal overlords impos- 
ed a campaign of assimilation on the 
people. And if, at the end of the eigh- 
teenth century, Byelorussia had been 
reunited with Russia—a country to which 
it had been linked from time immemorial 
by historical, cultural and linguistic 
ties—it was not until the beginning of the 
twentieth century that what amounted to 
little more than descriptive, written- 
down folklore began to evolve into a new 
national literature. The distinctive con- 
tribution by Kupala and Kolas was to 
enrich this new literature with progressive 
and revolutionary ideas, which they ex- 
pressed to artistic perfection. | 
Despite its concern with the sombre 
realities of the times, the poetry of 
Kupala and Kolas carries a heartening 
and thought-provoking message. The 
way we live now, it says, is barely anim- 
provement on death; struggle offers the 
only chance of escape. This leitmotif of 
revolt is nowhere more apparent than in 
Kupala’s “Who goes there?’’, which 
Maksim Gorki, who translated it into 
“Russian, described as ‘‘an eloquent, 
austere piece of verse.” 
Who goes there, in the marshland 
and the forest, 
Goes in that enormous crowd? 
The Byelorussian people go there! 
What are they bearing, on their 
skinny shoulders, 
Lifting in their skinny hands 
— Injustice and lies, they bear! 
Where are they carrying all the lies 
and the injustice, 
Taking them to show to whom? 
— To the whole world, to show! 
But who was it who roused these 
millions from their sleep, 
Who said, Take up your burden 
now, and go? 
— Misery and sorrow taught them so! 
But what is it they seek, then, the 
oppressed of the ages, 
The blind and the deaf, what do they 
seek? 
— To be called men! 
In its original language, we seem to 
hear in the rhythm of this poem the 
heavy, breathless tread of a huge crowd 
of people, carrying on their shoulders an 
immense load. “To be called men...” 
The laconic phrase recalls the insult in- 
flicted on a people far too long subjected 
to the most terrible of deprivations and 
denied the exercise of the most elemen- 
tary political and social rights. But “To 
be called mien...’ is also a demand, stem- 
ming from a new self-awareness. 
However it was interpreted, the poem 
made a powerful impression on the 
people, and found its way to all the cor- 
ners of Tsarist Russia. And if, at the time, 
“Who goes there?” was translated into 
ten languages, it is worth noting that in 
the special centenary edition of the works 
of the two poets, it is translated into no 
fewer than eighty, including Arabic, 
Chinese, English, French, German, Hin- 
di, Japanese and Spanish...

Familiar with the folklore of their 
country, transforming imagery into sym- 
bols, linking genuine feeling with an im- 
pressive breadth of vision, Kupala and 
Kolas opened the eyes of their people to 
spiritual horizons which lay far beyond 
the frontiers of Byelorussia, without los- 
ing sight of national realities. At the same 
time, their innate creativity, nourished by 
the oral traditions of the rural popula- 
tion, enabled them to reveal the richness, 
the freshness and the inexhaustible 
resources of their native language. Small 
wonder, then, that great masters of 
literature such as Gorki, Sholokhov, 
Aragon and many. others have paid 
tribute to the contribution made by these 
two Byelorussian poets to the heritage of 
world literature. 
Kupala and Kolas were not linked 
merely by their work and the gift which 
they shared of ‘‘conversing with all their 
countrymen’’. The circumstances of 
their lives were very similar. Both born 
in 1882, they each learned at a very early 
age what it was really like to till the earth, 
to work on the land without possessing 
the smallest plot of one’s own, to travel

from place to place in search of tem- 
porary employment. The fathers of each 
of them died young, worn out by the 
struggle against poverty. 
And it was not by chance that both 
poets chose pseudonyms of popular 
origin, Ivan Dominikovich Lutsevich 
became ‘‘Yanka Kupala’’ in evocation of 
the festival which bore that name. 
Konstantin Mikhailovich Mitskevich 
selected ‘‘Yakub Kolas’’, thus com- 
memorating the ear of grain (kolas) pro- 
duced by his native soil. 
Both poets fought for the freedom of 
their people; and both experienced the 
rigours of censorship and Tsarist oppres- 
sion, in their literary work and in their 
public activities. In 1908, Yakub Kolas 
received a prison sentence of almost three 
years, for having taken part in an illegal 
congress of teachers. 
It is not surprising, therefore, to find 
similar themes, and even similar images, 
in their writing, although each poet has 
his own distinctive personality. Kupala 
is the more lyrical of the two. Some of 
his poems, such as Kurgan (Burial 
Mound), Mogila I'va (The Lion’s Grave)

the eve of Kupala. 
Born in the same year a century ago, the two great Byelorussian poets Ivan 
Dominikovich Lutsevich (Kupala) and Konstantin Mikhailovich Mitskevich (Kolas) 
took their pen names from local fertility myths, thus expressing their love of 
their native land and their desire to see their country free and born again. Kolas, 
which means an ear of grain, evokes the legend of the days when the Byelorus- 
sian countryside was no more than an expanse of sand, marsh and untamed 
grassland. Dropped by a bird or carried on the wind or by a horse, a grain of 
barley took root and flourished in this wasteland, thus providing man with his 
daily bread. Even today, in Byelorussia, at harvest-time, the first handful of 
corn harvested is ceremonially knotted around the farmer's waist (see draw- 
ing left). Kupala, from the word koupat, meaning to bathe, is the name of a 
pagan midsummer festival on which pagan ““weddings’’ were consummated. 
On the eve of Kupala unmarried peasant girls would each fashion two circlets 
of sweet clover which they threw into a nearby river. If the two circlets floated 
side by side, the maidens would soon be wed (drawing opposite page). That 
same night the peasants would set out in search of a fern in flower. Tradition 
had it that the fern, the symbol of happiness, flowered only once a year, on 
and Ona i ja (She and I), have a roman- 
tic tone; others are taut with dramatic 
tension. His inventions, images and sym- 
bols are frequently audacious. Kolas, on 
the other hand, is a more down-to-earth 
poet, with a closer eye for detail: 
The villages have a sad look, 
Heartbreaking it is, to see them. 
In a backyard—firewood, a few 
planks 
And a heap of rubbish. 
A rickety cross at the roadside, 
A pile of dry poplar trees... 
Silence, a sort of boredom as in a 
prison 
Or in a cemetery somewhere. 
As well as a poet, Kolas was also, 
throughout his life, a distinguished 
prose-writer, noted particularly for his 
collection of short stories Skazki Zhizni 
(Tales of Life) and for his great trilogy 
Na Rostanjakh (At the Crossroads). 
During the First World War, both 
poets were conscripted into the Tsarist 
army and served outside Byelorussia. 
Understandably, they greeted the Oc- 
tober Revolution in 1917 with great en- 
thusiasm, and celebrated the event in a 
number of poems. But the vicissitudes of 
the post-war period were such that part 
of Byelorussia remained under Polish oc- 
cupation until 1939. On the other hand, 
in 1919, Eastern Byelorussia became one 
of the fifteen constituent republics of the 
USSR. Factories were built; roads were 
traced across the landscape; and the 
scourge of illiteracy, which had been rife 
throughout the population, was 
eradicated. The children of the poor were 
now to be found in universities and other 
educational establishments. Theatres 
were created, and crowds flocked, as they 
still do today, to see Kupala’s Pavlinka, 
and other dramatic works by the two 
poets. Both were among the first 
members of the Byelorussian Academy 
of Sciences and Letters, the foundation 
of which launched anewerainthe coun- 
try's economic, scientific and cultural 
ife. 
In 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the 
Soviet Union. Kupala and Kolas issued 
passionate calls for popular resistance 
against the invader, in stirring poems 
such as the former’s Belorusskim Par- 
tizanam (To the Byelorussian partisans). 
Despite the destruction by the enemy of 
entire towns and villages, and the suffer- 
ing of the people (one Byelorussian in 
four did not survive the war), there was 
no surrender. Yanka Kupala, unhappi- 
ly, did not live to see his country’s vic- 
tory, but died in 1942. Yakub Kolas 
lived until 1956, and thus witnessed the 
revival which began with the liberation, 
playing an active part in public life and 
expressing his creativity up to the very 
end. 
Today, the works of Kupala and Kolas 
are published in impressive quantities. 
Poetic gatherings are organized in their 
memory. Streets, squares, schools, 
libraries, theatres, institutions of various 
kinds and even ships bear the two poets’ 
names. Indeed, the names of Yanka 
Kupala and Yakub Kolas will always be 
linked with that of their country, to 
which they unstintingly devoted their ex- 
ceptional talents. |

fantasy, let us imagine that one 
day Saint Francis knocked at our 
door. What would happen? No doubt he 
would begin by telling us about his own 
times and what he had tried to accomplish 
during his life. And this would be the point 
at which some real problems would arise. 
Let us imagine how the conversation 
would continue. Saint Francis would re- 
mind us of his guidelines for living and right 
away we would come up against great dif- 
ficulties. No doubt he would speak of 
poverty and invite us to live the life of the 
poor, advising his brothers to accept 
neither church nor even the poorest house; 
he would preach the Christianity of Christ, 
the Christ of the Gospels who is the inspira- 
tion of the pilgrim church of the world, of 
T AKING flight into the realms of pure 
because it pursues the notion of the 
spiritual prey, souls that wait to be 
educated and helped, of that church which 
over six centuries does not appear to have 
gone very far in that direction. 
And what about us? We are still caught 
up in a totally opposed vision, one which 
cannot be reconciled with this path of 
. adversity and difficulty. Our goalis to live 
and richly appointed, to pray in churches 
which best suit our tastes. Above all, we 
strive to make of this samereligion, of this 
religion which links us through Saint Fran- 
cis to Christ, a centre of appeasement, of 
satisfaction and, indirectly, of lassitude. 
We enter the church to find peace; Saint 
CARLO BO, /talian writer and literary critic, has 
played a leading role in a number of avant-garde 
literary movements, including hermetism, in 
which such great Italian poets as Ungaretti and 
Montale have taken part. He teaches French 
language and literature at Urbino, where he has 
been rector of the university since 1950. 
This article is taken from a longer study in 
which the author, writing from the standpoint 
of a Christian of the West, calls for a return to 
the essentials of Franciscan teaching —love, 
peace and brotherhood between men and bet- 
ween the peoples of the world. 
 
From riches to rags 
seemed less propitious than the Italy of the end of the twelfth 
century for the birth of the *‘seraphic saint’’, the man whose 
life mission was *‘to follow the teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ 
and to walk in his footsteps’’. For when Francesco di Pietro di Ber- 
nardone was born, in 1182, at Assisi in Umbria, the peninsula was 
torn with strife—Pope fought Emperor, Guelph fought Ghibelline, 
bourgeois fought noble and city fought city. 
The man who was later to found a great religious order whose first 
rule was poverty was born rich. His father, Pietro di Bernardone, was 
a wealthy cloth merchant, and with his good looks, his riches and his 
romantic notions of chivalry, acquired from the chansons of the 
French troubadours, Francesco soon became the acknowledged leader 
of the worldly young blades of Assisi. 
Thirsting for knightly adventure, in 1202 he took part in the war 
between Assisi and Perugia but was taken prisoner at the battle of 
Ponte San Giovanni at which Assisi suffered a crushing defeat. Releas- 
ed a year later he became seriously ill, but on his recovery he set out, 
in 12085, to join the papal army. This journey was to be his ‘‘road to 
Damascus’’. He had got no farther than Spoleto when he had a 
vision in which he was instructed to return to Assisi and await a call 
to another form of knighthood. 
24 
F EW periods in history and few places in the world could have On his return to Assisi, in preparation for this call, he devoted 
himself to prayer and solitude. He made a pilgrimage to Rome where 
he experienced poverty at first hand, mingling with beggars and himself 
begging for alms. 
The call which he had been so patiently awaiting came to him at 
the ruined chapel of San Damiano on the outskirts of Assisi. One day 
a voice from the crucifix above the altar commanded him: “Go Francis 
and repair my ruined house’’. Taking these words literally, he returned 
home, took as much cloth from his father’s shop as he could load 
onto his horse and rode to Foligno where he sold both cloth and horse. 
On his return he tried to give the money to the priest of San Da-- 
miano, but his enraged father hauled him first before the civil 
authorities and then before the bishop. Before the startled prelate’s 
eyes he stripped off his clothing which he handed to his father say- 
ing, ‘“Until today I called Pietro di Bernardone my father; henceforth 
I can truly say: Our Father which art in heaven’’. Whereupon the 
astonished bishop gave him a cloak to cover his nakedness and he 
set off to live in the forests of Mount Subasio. ° 
With family ties broken and material goods renounced he was free 
to devote himself to God’s work. Dressed now in rough hermit’s garb 
he set about restoring first the chapel at San Damiano and then the 
chapel of Santa Maria degli Angeli, known because of its small size 
that church whichis in eternal movement 
in houses which are ever more comfortable -

### 50953: If Saint Francis came to call, would the message of the 'seraphic saint' be heeded in the modern industrial world?

If Saint Francis came to call 
Would the message of the ‘seraphic saint’ 
be heeded in the modern industrial world? 
Francis enters it so as to reinforce his desire 
to fight against himself, against everything 
which might give him a moment of tran- 
quility, a breathing-space, oblivion. 
Itis clear that, broached in this fashion, 
our hypothetical conversation offers no 
possibility of mutual understanding, the 
Saint continuing to walk the highways and 
byways of the world (certainly in another 
form, dressed differently, and with the face 
of an asocial, marginal figure condemned 
by a society that excludes him). And yet 
the first words he pronounces in our 
by Carlo Bo 
imagination and across centuries of 
Catholic tradition are simply these: ‘‘the 
spirit of poverty.’ 
The very principle of our economy is in 
contradiction with the evangelical ideal of 
Saint Francis. It is not for nothing that his 
discourse is centred on negation: not to 
possess, not to hold, not to accept. We are 
impelled to give, to render what we give 
acceptable and to discover those who are 
poorer than ourselves. 
The theme of true happiness is precise- 
ly this: happy and serene is the man who, 
stranded far from home on a stormy night, 
knocks in vain at the door of the convent. 
Saint Francis makes of this domestic 
parable the main instrument of his genius 
for spiritual individuation—man finds his 
salvationin the very moment that the world 
abandons him. 
In the depths of misfortune, continues 
the disconcerting Saint Francis, this 
trouble-maker we have welcomed into our 
home, we discover the unique sign of 
salvation. For the Saint hope does not 
come from us or from any other man, but p> 
  
Saint Francis’ love of nature has come to be 
typified by the story of how he exhorted his - 
friends the birds to sing the praises of God. He 
regarded nature as the mirror of God and his 
sense of brotherhood which extended not on- 
ly to his fellow men but to all God's creatures 
found expression in his famous Cantico di frate 
sole (Canticle of Brother Sun). This poem is not 
only one of the most beautiful in Italian 
literature, it is also one of the first to be writ- 
ten in the vernacular. Until the 13th century 
almost all Italian literary work was written in 
ecclesiastical Latin. When Saint Francis wrote 
the Cantico in 1225, not long before his death, 
he pointed the way to such men as Guido 
Cavalcanti and Guido Guinizelli towards the 
dolce stil novo’, the “sweet new style’ of 
poetry whose praises Dante sang in the Divine 
Comedy. Left, Graham Faulkner as Saint Fran- 
cis in Franco Zeffirelli’s film Francis and the 
Way to the Sun.

as the Porziuncola, which was later to become the centre of the Fran- 
ciscan Order. 
There, on the feast of St Matthias, on February 24, 1208, he heard 
the words from the Gospel with which Christ sent forth his apostles: 
“Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip 
for your journey; neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves, for 
the workman is worthy of his meat. And into whatsoever city or town 
ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide until ye 
gothence.”’ At last the meaning and purpose of his life seemed crystal 
clear. Although not an ordained priest, he began preaching to his 
fellow townsmen, quickly attracting around him a band of disciples. 
On April 16, 1209, the rule of life he had drawn up for them received 
papal sanction and the great adventure of the Franciscan Order was 
launched. 
Women, too, flocked to join him and three years later he founded 
for them a second order that came to be known as the Poor Clares 
after his first woman adherent Clare Offreduccio, a noblewoman of 
Assisi. Finally, in 1221, he formed the Third Order of Brothers and 
Sisters of Penance, a lay fraternity for those who, without withdraw- 
ing from the world or taking religious vows, wished to follow the prin- 
ciples of Franciscan life. 
Meanwhile the men’s order had grown rapidly and was no longer 
confined to Italy. In 1212 Francis had set out for the Holy Land but 
was shipwrecked in the Adriatic and was forced to return home, In 
1219 he went to Egypt where the crusaders were besieging Damietta, 
and is said to have entered the Saracen camp and preached before 
the sultan. 
I11 health, which was to dog him for the rest of his life, forced him 
to abandon projected visits to France and Spain. Besides, his presence 
was needed in Italy where the continual growth of the men’s order 
made amplification and revision of the rule of the order imperative. 
The new and final version of the Franciscan rule was approved by 
Pope Honorius III in November 1223. 
Exhausted by his many illnesses, which he called his *‘sisters’’ and 
the many penances he inflicted on “Brother Ass the body’’, Francis 
felt the need to withdraw from the external affairs of the order and 
in the summer of 1224 he went with three companions to the moun- 
tain retreat of La Verna, not far from Assisi. Here, as he prayed on 
the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, he saw a vision of a seraph 
with six wings. When the vision faded he found that his body bore 
the stigmata, the marks of the wounds of Christ, on his hands, feet 
.and side. 
As Christmas approached Francis returned to the Porziuncola and, 
despite constant illness and near blindness, he spent the first months 
of the year 1225 riding throughout Umbria on a donkey preaching 
to the people. With his eye condition worsening his companions took 
him to Rieti for medical treatment which proved unsuccessful. Then, 
after a brief stay in Siena, he was brought home to Assisi where, on 
October 3, 1226, he died at the Porziuncola. In 1228 he was canoniz- 
ed a saint by Pope Gregory 1X. |]

### 50953: If Saint Francis came to call, would the message of the 'seraphic saint' be heeded in the modern industrial world?

» from God who assigns us mysterious tasks 
and has us encounter tragic conditions on 
our way throughlife. Graceisnotareward, 
it is only the promise of a reward, of 
salvation, the promise that our terror will 
be transformed into joy and jubilation. 
Our poor man, or, more accurately, the 
poor man as we like toimagine him and deal 
with him, is a completely passive being. We 
mollycoddle the poor man, we send him to 
sleep, we do everything we canto relieve 
him of his moth-eaten coat of glory. We" 
give him something inthe hope that he will 
move on, and we even vouchsafe him a 
few words of advice so that he won't 
disturb our tranquillity. Saint Francis, on 
the contrary, sees the poor man as aking, 
as the thorn that makes our flesh bleed and, 
above all, as the face of truth. : 
In elaborating his teachings of love by 
contrasts, Saint Francis advances the 
spiritual meaning of poverty one stage fur- 
ther. He who hates us is apowerful figure, 
resembling us yet menacing our property 
area, trying to take from us our part of 
power, of glory, of ambition. And Saint 
Francis tells us that we should love him as 
ourselves, asif thisrich man was inreality 
apoverty-strickenindividual, asif inthe im- 
age of this victor we could discover the 
face of the beaten and insulted Christ. 
It might be conjectured that God sent 
Saint Francis into this world in the 
footsteps of Christin order to offer us one 
more demonstration that the Gospels ex- 
tol autopia. And this affords us the oppor- 
tunity to formulate a first objection to Saint 
Francis and to Jesus: why preach things 
which are so arduous, so difficult in fact 
as to be next to impossible to implement, 
and which two thousand years of world ex- 
perience has shown to be so—if not total- 
ly, at least in part? 
26 
Ourlives, such as we have lived and are 
living them, would appearto give thelie to 
the dream and the reality of Saint Francis 
and suggest that the natural character, nor- 
mality and enormous importance of our 
temptations constitute basic proof of the 
vanity and laughable character of Saint 
Francis’ dream, the dream of fraternity and 
of peace through fraternity. 
Herein we find one of the most disturb- 
ing and at the same time splendid aspects 
of the Franciscan wanderings—the clear 
tendency to rebellion in the saint, the 
tendency to defer obedience to his own 
convictions. It would have been easy for 
himto place himself at the head of a move- 
ment which challenged the ‘Signor Papa"’ 
Saint John the 
Evangelist and Saint 
Francis of Assisi, by El 
Greco (early 17th 
century). .

and his own bishop. But it was in this very 
context that Saint Francis understood that 
truth is indissociable from obedience and 
that obedience is very similar to the night 
of storm and cold, a chastising experience 
whose ultimate goals the recuperation of 
liberty. It is important to note, however, 
that the obedience is not of a purely 
mechanical kind, nor canit be replaced by 
a facile escapism; itis an obedience, rather, ... 
which takes its toll in tears and blood. 
The great story of Christianity has been 
written with this obedience as its main in- 
strument, as Saint Francis, with his fear of 
heresy and the tempting spirit of contradic- 
tion, was well aware. Nor, for that matter, 
did he hesitate to bind his brothers to a 
scrupulous observance of evangelical prin- 
ciples and the teachings of the Church. The 
suspicion of theology arose from the idea 
that carnal pride could return to our hearts 
as the result of uncontrolled speculation. 
What greater sacrifice could one ask of 
a man than that of submitting to the 
eradication of his own intelligence? We feel 
that God gave us our brains to use in any 
way we choose. Saint Francis, onthe other 
hand, absolutely denies this. For him the 
intelligence is only a means of increasing 
the love of God, and should be placed at 
the disposal of whoever has been called 
upon to act as our guide. 
The precepts and recommendations 
which his voice carries to us from that lost 
century have been tacitly avoided, silenc- 
ed, for a long time —from the moment, in 
fact, that man began looking to his ownin- 
terest and seeking an equilibrium which 
chance, our capacity for adaptation, and 
the illusion of being alone in the world, 
appear to have made possible. We have 
stifled or, for the moment, we appear to 
have stifled the cry of Cain, that very cry 
that Saint Francis strove to banish from our 
daily lives. Why render an account of our 
acts, why renounce the spirit of liberty, 
why make of obedience the very gateway

to prayer? Saint Francis asked and con- 
tinues to ask much of us without ever 
speaking to us of what we will be givenin 
exchange. At most he promises us 
“perfect happiness’’, something that 
nobody believes in these days. Like the 
Christ of the Gospels, the Saint does not 
lay before us hard and fast rules of sal- 
vation nor does he conjure up in our 
anguished minds the mirage of gardens of 
enchantment; we are merely men pointing 
out to other men terrestrial paradises which 
with time have come to form a single 
‘‘Eden’’ where everything is fulfilled in 
murder and the exaltation of visible 
conquests. 
The strain of madness in Saint Francis’ 
preaching does not strike or affectus asit 
struck and affected his contemporaries, 
completely taken aback as they were by 
his desire to dispossess and strip clean. The 
effect on those who saw and heard him 
preachinthe streets and squares was one 
of fury: he was at odds with the social 
model of his time. As to us, we do not 
remember him, we have eliminated him. 
What was madness, the madness of God, 
is today a curiosity. But perhaps we 
exaggerate. If he has remained in our 
memory for seven hundred years and if, 
from Dante up to the latest writers who 
from time to time have felt tempted torein- 
voke his spirit, Saint Francis has appealed 
to our intelligence, it is because his path, 
temporarily dropped from our itineraries, 
is not yet closed. 
Will Saint Francis return? For the mo- 
ment we are limited to fantasizing concer- 
ning this possibility, to turning the question 
upside downinthe form of anhypothesis: 
should he return. If he returns, if one day 
he knocks on our paper door, what will filter 
through the unending stream of other 
news, of other messages? How will we 
judge him and what will he himself find 
most surprising? 
When Saint Francis knocks at our door 
(and this happens much more frequently 
than we suppose), we only half open it; we 
admit his legend into our homes and leave 
his truths outside — his patience, his par- 
don, his love. Inthe final analysisitis that 
love alone that joins and reunites us all. 
Why do we leave his truth of love outside? 
Simply because we are incapable of this 
love; the regime of consumerism, usury 
and exploitation, the rule of do ut des {1 give 
that you may give) and the philosophy of 
life which follows from it, have as their 
primary objective the spirit of love, this 
‘’good’’ that we inscribe on our standards 
but which in reality we do not respect. This 
‘’good’’ isonly forus and we do all we can 
to obtain it and to improve it on the prac- 
tical level. But, as Saint Francis saw, it is 
never the good of others. 
Saint Francis has lost, in the same way 
that his dreams of a human community 
freed from the harsh laws of economics 
have not prevailed. The efforts which have 
been made in other continents and which 
have been inspired by his more generous 
ambitions belong to written history and it 
is unlikely that they will manifest 
themselves again in written form. In- 
dustrialized societies have increased the 
factors of social contrast which were 
known in the time of Saint Francis, but let 
us not forget that he foresaw the impor- 
tance of the problem and in his own way 
succeeded in breaking it down to its root 
causes.

E was tall, raw-boned, emaciated; 
H one of those men whose skeletons 
seem visible through the flesh— 
like Don Quixote to whom he dedicated his 
autobiography and for whom he reserved 
a special corner of his heart as the embodi- 
ment of the ideal man. Yet despite his 
physical similarity to and love of “The Man 
Jrom La Mancha’, Wifredo Lam was not 
Spanish; he was a man of the tropics, a 
Caribbean, a Cuban to his fingertips. 
Lam was born in 1902 at Sagua La 
Grande, Cuba, in the heart of a region 
whose long and determinant history of in- 
termingling of peoples and cultures has 
made it, in Lam’s own words, “‘a privileg- 
ed geographical cross-roads, both a meeting 
point and a point of departure’’. By his birth 
Lam inherited the four basic elements of the 
Caribbean ethnic intermix: African, Euro- 
pean and Indian, from his mother, and 
Chinese, from his father. 
After starting his study of painting in 
Havana, Lam set out, in 1923, for Spain 
where he was to spend a crucial period of 
his life. “When I arrived in Madrid”’, Lam 
recounted later, ‘I was like a country 
bumpkin who had seen nothing. My first 
visit to the Prado was a revelation”, Some 
thirteen years later, in 1936 and 1937, he 
played an active role in the defence of 
Madrid against Franco's forces, and at the . 
end of 1937 he moved to Paris. 
Soon after his arrival in Paris Lam met 
Picasso who introduced him to André 
Breton and other figures of the surrealist 
movement with which he was from then on 
closely associated. Lam’s encounter with 
Picasso and the surrealists was to have a 
decisive impact on his work which was to 
be moulded by the twin influences of the 
European intellectual and artistic avant- 
garde and his deeply implanted Caribbean 
roots. It was not long before this fusion 
Sound material expression in the first of his 
major works. 
In 1941, fleeing the Nazi invaders, Lam 
shipped out of Marseilles with several of his 
Parisian friends. In 1942 he reached Havana 
where the rediscovery, after an absence of 
eighteen years, of his native land and the . 
Black culture into which he had been born 
galvanized his artistic imagination. In

### 50954: Wifredo Lam, 1902-1982

Wifredo 
Lam 
1902-1982 
1943 he completed his famous painting The 
Jungle (see the Unesco Courier, December 
1981) in which the imagery and the syncretic 
‘cult myths of Cuba (African animism-— 
Spanish catholicism) found expression 
through European avant-garde forms with 
such imagination and explosive force that 
it provoked an uproar when exhibited in 
New York that same year. 
Lam remained in Cuba until 1952, when 
he returned to Paris which he was to make 
his permanent home. He continued, 
however, to make frequent trips to his native 
Cuba, especially after the 1959 revolution 
of which he had been a firm supporter from 
the start. 
By this time his paintings had earned him 
a worldwide reputation and each new work 
enhanced his position as one of the great ar- 
tists of an awakening Third World and as 
the voice of its oppressed and neglected 
cultures. Through the magic of his imagina- 
tion the universe of the occult and the 
mysterious took on colour and shape, 
becoming aware of the fact of its own ex- 
istence. Referring to The Jungle, the French 
writer Alain Jouffroy wrote that ‘it was the 
first artistic revolutionary declaration of a 
Third World that already, it would seem, 
perceived the need to place all cultures on 
a common footing, and an augury of an 
awakening to this need on a world scale... 
The Jungle affirmed that there were no in- 
superable incompatibilities between peoples 
and that they are all intimately interlinked.” 
Indeed, though Lam was a Caribbean and 
a man of the New World, he also belonged 
to the Old World. The upsurge of the Afro- 
Cuban heritage in the works of Lam's 
maturity occurred precisely because the very 
nature of the adventure of twentieth-century 
European art (we recall the discovery of 
“primitive’’ African art by Matisse and 
Picasso) had made it possible. Mestizo in 
his origins, Lam was mestizo in his art, a 
quality that brought to his works a 
dynamism that kept it in perpetual ferment 
right to the end and imbued it with the rich 
Joyousness of the adventure of Caribbean 
and modern art. 
Wifredo Lam died this year in Paris under 
a bright September sky.

### 50955: Szymanowski: a great composer rediscovered

Szymanowski 
a great composer rediscovered 
by Jerzy Waldorff 
REAT creative artists and their 
works often have a chequered 
fate. Vivaldi’s music was only 
discovered two centuries after its com- 
poser’s death. Van Gogh, like many 
other painters, lived in poverty; today his 
paintings are valued at millions of 
dollars. In some cases outstanding 
creators are celebrated during their 
lifetime but after their death their works 
are temporarily and unjustly consigned 
to oblivion. This has been the fate of 
Karol Szymanowski, who was con- 
sidered to be one of the great European 
composers in the 1930s. 
Szymanowski was born on 3 October 
1882 in the little town of Timoszowka on 
the border of the Ukraine and Podolia. 
It is a matter of coincidence that Joseph 
Conrad (Jozef Korzeniowski) the great 
English writer of Polish origin, the 
famous pianist and statesman Ignacy 
Paderewski, and the noted twentieth- 
century Polish writer Jaroslav 
Ivaszkiewicz were all born in this same 
region of Poland. Two famous women, 
Balzac’s great love Ewelina Hanska, and 
Karolina Ivanowska (later the princess of 
Wittgenstein) who was the inspiration of 
Franz Liszt, also came from the same 
area. 
Szymanowski had the good fortune to 
be born into a family which was deeply 
interested in the theatre, literature and 
above all music. They did not stand inthe 
way of his vocation and allowed him to 
study in Warsaw where he made friends 
with the pianist Artur Rubinstein and the 
violinist Pawel Kochans. These brilliant 
performers later became the most 
faithful champions of Szymanowski’s 
works in Europe and the United States. 
Initially Szymanowski was influenced 
by Chopin and Scriabin. In 1902 his 
Study in B Flat, which Paderewski in- 
cluded in his repertoire, made him inter- 
nationally known. After 1906 his sym-

and Arab music (which he discovered 
while travelling in Africa). But he soon 
found his own way, essentially Polish in 
inspiration. : 
After his journey to Africa 
Szymanowski visited Paris on the eve of 
the First World War where he met Claude 
Debussy, and London where he madethe 
acquaintance of Igor Stravinsky. As 
described, not without humour, in Ar- 
tur Rubinstein’s memoirs, the meeting 
with the outwardly cold and aloof 
Stravinsky was not a success. Then 
Szymanowski returned home by one of 
the last trains in the summer of 1914. As

phonic work's began to be played by the 
orchestras of Warsaw, Berlin and Vien- 
na. In accordance with the traditional 
practice of that time, an ambitious 
patron and man of taste, Prince 
Wladislaw Lubomirski, offered him the 
hospitality of his palace in Vienna and 
recommended him to the ‘‘Universal 
Edition’’ publishing house which was to 
publish all his works except for the ballet 
Harnasie, the Fourth Symphonie Con- 
certante, and the Second Violin Concer- 
to, which appeared under the imprint of 
the Paris house of Max Eschig. 
Szymanowski’s compositions between 
1906 and 1910 reflected his enthusiasm 
for the work of Max Reger, Richard 
Strauss, the impressionism of Debussy, 
the guns began to thunder in the West he 
was gripped by a fever of creativity and

against a background of inexpressible 
anguish. The Third Symphony (The 
Song of the Night) for orchestra, tenor 
and choir, is quite different; written to 
words by the great Persian Sufi poet 
Rumi (13th century AD) this gigantic 
work evokes the heaving of the ocean 
through its rich canvas of sound, and 
culminates in a meditation bordering on 
ecstasy: ‘“‘God and I are alone...”

piano, the best-known piece being the 
demanding Fountain of Arethusa. On his 
way to Africa Szymanowski had spent 
some time in Sicily, still imbued with the 
heritage of “greater Greece’’, and where 
he discovered Antiquity. The Myths are 
a reflection of this revelation. 
After the Treaty of Versailles the com- 
poser and his family returned from 
Elisavetgrad, where they had moved in 
1917, toa Poland reborn. After 1920 his 
works increasingly drew inspiration from 
folklore—songs, dances, fiddler’s im- 
provizations, especially those of the

mountain-dwellers of the Tatra massif. 
But when he introduces popular melodies 
and the rhythms of peasant dances into 
such compositions as the oratorio Stabat 
Mater, the ballet Harnasie, and the 
Fourth Symphonie Concertante, 
Szymanowski uses the same freedom and 
orchestral refinement as a Prokofiev, a 
Bartok or a Stravinsky. 
He rarely abandoned the tonal system. 
In his rare atonal experiments he went 
close to the serial writing of Schoenberg, 
without however employing a complete 
twelve-tone system. He was attached 
above all to the originality of melodic 
lines and to their scintillation and éclat, 
wishing to express in music the profound 
and unchanging feelings of mankind. His

sobriquet, ‘‘romantic of modernity’, q 
~ was fully deserved. As time went by, 
however, his technique became increas- 
ingly refined and rigorous. His oratorio 
Stabat Mater, universally considered to 
be a masterpiece, was produced when he 
was at the height of his powers. 
Szymanowski’s growing authority was 
recognized when he was appointed direc- 
tor of the Warsaw conservatory in 1927, 
but the envy of some of his fellow- 
musicians and government intrigues led 
him to resign in 1932. This was a blow 
from which he never recovered. But

classroom contact in order to influence 
such musicians as Grazyna Bacewicz, 
Witold Lutoslawski, Tadeusz Baird and 
Krzysztof Penderecki. Although at times 
‘they resisted Szymanowski’s ‘‘roman- 
ticism’’ these young artists nevertheless 
profited from the lessons taught them by 
the work of their older contemporary. 
While the master was encountering 
difficulties in his own country, elsewhere 
his successes were bringing him recogni- 
tion as a leading figure in European 
music. In 1929 he was awarded the Order 
of the Italian Crown and in the follow- 
ing year he became a member of the 
Prague Academy of Sciences and Arts. 
In 1931 he was awarded the French 
Legion of Honour, and became an 
honorary member of the International 
Society for Contemporary Music, to 
which Richard Strauss, Manuel de Falla, 
Maurice Ravel, Stravinsky, Bela Bartok 
and others also belonged. 
Between 1924 and 1926 
Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto 
“was performed by such musicians as 
Sampigny in Paris, Pawel Kochanski in 
New York, Stokowski and Huberman in 
Vienna. Between 1929 and 1937, the 
Stabat Mater was sung in Naples, Vien- 
na, Brussels, Paris, Klagenfurt, Warsaw, 
New York, Dusseldorf and Chicago. The 
ballet Harnasie was performed between 
1935 and 1937 in a concertante version 
in Cleveland and New York, and danc- 
ed in Prague, Paris, Belgrade and Ham- 
burg. Szymanowski himself was the 
soloist when his Fourth Symphonie Con- 
certante for piano and orchestra was per- 
formed in Copenhagen, Moscow, 
Amsterdam, Bucharest, Stockholm, 
Paris and London. 
Szymanowski’s last great success also 
brought him great distress. In 1936 his 
ballet Harnasie was staged at the Paris 
Opera to choreography by Serge Lifar 
who danced the principal role. The critics 
unanimously showered praise on the 
composer. Unfortunately, a few days 
after the opening night, a fire broke out 
in the corridors and the ballet had to be 
transferred to the Théatre des Champs 
Elysées. But there were no offers of fur- 
ther performances. 
In 1937 Szymanowski died of tuber- 
culosis, an illness he had contracted in 
childhood and one which was at that time 
often incurable. 
Two years later the Second World War 
unleashed by Hitler swept through 
Europe, destroying Poland and erasing 
the great musician’s name from memory. 
Then, with the return of peace a certain 
avant-garde which was in some cases. 
more attached to tradition than to in- 
novation slowed down the rediscovery of 
a composer who, formerly dubbed a 
‘“‘romantic’’ had in the meantime become 
a “‘classic’’ because of the vigour and 
beauty of his art. 
In spring 1975 Szymanowski’s opera 
King Roger was staged at Sadlers Wells 
in London by the New Opera Company. 
It was a triumphant success and set off 
a chain reaction, with more and more 
performances of King Roger being put 
on in vartous parts of the world. A recent 
example: Szymanowski’s opera scored a 
triumph at the Teatro Coldn in Buenos 
_ Aires in autumn 1981. 
The centenary of Szymanowski’s 
birth, inscribed on Unesco’s world calen- 
dar of anniversaries, is a fitting moment 
to contribute to the revival of his music 
in a world which more than ever stands 
in need of the beauty and peace which 
music can bring. un

### 50956: Bharati, poet and patriot

Bharati, 
poet and patriot 
by K. Swaminathan 
centenary of Subramania Bharati . 
I NDIA is celebrating this year the 
(1882-1921), whom Tamils regard 
as a Mahakavi (Great Poet) and 
Amarakavi (Immortal Poet), and whom 
historians regard as one of the most 
authentic voices of modern India pro- 
claiming the unity of the nation, its pas- 
sionate longing for freedom and the 
human cry for universal brotherhood. In 
his brief working life of two decades, 
Bharati, as journalist, poet and patriot, 
brought about a revolution in Tamil 
literature and in the thinking of the Tamil . 
people. He combined profound 
knowledge of and admiration for the 
eternal elements in the ancient Tamil 
tradition with a forward-looking accep- 
tance of the ideal of human unity. Thus 
he brought Tamil prose and poetry into 
close contact with contemporary reality 
by using the language of common speech 
in his songs and poems dealing with cur- 
rent topics like indentured labour, the 
rape of Belgium, the great Russian 
Revolution and the demand for national 
integration and real Swaraj 
(independence). 
Subramania was born on December 
11, 1882, in Ettayapuram in Tirunelveli 
district of the then Madras Presidency. 
His father Chinnaswami Iyer was in the 
service of the local Zamindar or chief- 
tain. Subramanian’s mother died when 
he was an infant. The father wished his 
first son to become an English-educated 
officer or engineer. But the boy took 
little interest in such ‘‘bread-winning’’ 
studies and failed in the matriculation ex- 
amination at the end of his high school 
course, 
But even during school days he had 
created a stir among students and 
teachers by his spontaneous gift of ver- 
sification. At 15, he was married to 7 year 
old Chellammal. He was then provided 
the sinecure job of reading daily 
newspapers to thelocal chieftain. About 
this time the title ‘Bharati’ was confer- 
red on him by a gathering of poets at a 
court function. Henceforth, literary 
K. SWAMINATHAN, Indian educator and jour- 
nalist, has been since 1960 chief editor of the 
"Collected Warks of Mahatma Gandhi’’, the 
Government of India’s project to publish a 
multi-volume edition of Mahatma Gandhi's 
writings and speeches.

circles knew him as Subramania Bharati 
or just ‘‘Bharati” (embodiment of 
Saraswati, Goddess of learning). 
This idyll in his home-town was short- 
lived. Within a year, his father passed 
away, leaving the family in straitened cir- 
cumstances. Bharati moved to Varanasi 
to be with his aunt there. The two years 
he spent in Varanasi brought about a 
great change in his outer personality and 
inner vision; he gained a sound 
knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi and 
English; passed with credit the Entrance 
Examination of the Allahabad Univer- 
sity; and read and enjoyed the English 
Romantic poets, especially Shelley. 
In search of alivelihood, Bharati went 
back to Ettayapuram in 1901, where he 
taught Tamil in a high school for a short 
period. When Bharati was 22, he came 
into contact with G.Subramania Iyer, 
editor of aleading Tamil daily, Swadesa 
Mithran, published from Madras. The 
young man was invited to join the daily 
as a sub-editor. His fluency and facility 
as a translator enabled him to bring to 
the Tamil public the inspired utterances 
of Swami Vivekananda, Aurobindo’ 
Ghose and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Soon 
the rebel in Bharati drew him into the 
vortex of Indian politics. His original ar- 
ticles in his inimitable style espousing 
“‘extremism’’ were read widely. The next 
and final step was the transformation of 
Tamil poetry by Bharati’s use of his; 
unique lyrical power for the expression. 
of modern ideas for rousing the pride and| 
patriotism of the people.

in Tamil, the first words of one of his poems 
or, as here, the invocation pronounced before 
the singing of hymns of the temple of Chidam- 
baram, a shrine held in high veneration in Tamil 
Nadu. Some thousand years later, another 
Tamil poet, Subramania Bharati was to write: 
Ye foolish folk, who roam about 
In search of myriad fancied gods, 
Have ye not heard the myriad scriptures 
Declare knowledge alone is God?

The movement against the British rule 
in India gained a new momentum with 
the partition of Bengal in 1905 and 
engulfed the whole country. The 
~ “moderate’’ Swadesa Mithran could not 
accommodate the fiery writings of 
Bharati. So he left it to join a new Tamil 
weekly India and threw in his lot with the 
extremist elements in the Indian National 
Congress which the British Government 
were trying to put down by arrests and 
imprisonment. 
To avoid possible arrest, Bharati fled 
to Pondicherry which was then a French 
settlement in South India, and he con- 
tinued to edit from there the weekly /n- 
dia. Then followed a period of grim trials 
and tribulations under the constant 
surveillance of the British and the French 
police. But there was ample recompense 
for these sufferings in his friendship with 
Sri Aurobindo, V.V.S. Iyer, 
Subramanya Siva and other patriots who 
too had sought refuge in Pondicherry. 
Though Bharati experienced moments of 
depression, poetry continued to be ‘‘the 
anchor of his purest thoughts, the nurse, 
the guide, the guardian of his heart, and 
soul of all his moral being’’. 
Bharati came out of his self-exile on 
November 2, 1918, and was promptly ar- 
rested and kept in police custody for 24 
days. However, on the intervention of 
some eminent public workers, he was 
conditionally released, and was soon 
back in his native district, Tirunelveli. His 
““extremism’’ had somewhat mellowed 
by then and he soon gravitated towards 
the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. It was 
at this juncture that his old paper 
Swadesa Mithran welcomed him back to 
Madras. He lived in Triplicane, a suburb

East Bengal representing Sarasvati 
the Hindu goddess of learning and

Bharati, a title which was confer- 
red on the great Tamil poet 
Subramania by a group of his 
fellow poets as a tribute to his 
talent. From then on he was 
known as Subramania Bharati, or 
simply, Bharati.

of Madras city, free for a while from ab- 
ject poverty. 
But soon came the end. In an attempt 
to befriend the temple elephant at 
Triplicane, he offered as usual a coconut 
to the animal unaware that it was in rut. 
Struck down by the mighty trunk and 
thrown aside, he suffered grave injuries. 
Though he was promptly rescued and 
taken to hospital, he lay seriously ill for 
a few days and passed away peacefully 
on September 12, 1921, at the age of 39. 
Bharati has left behind an impressive 
and imperishable mass of poetry and 
prose. Beside his widely popular patriotic 
poems, special mention may be made of 
his exquisite love-lyrics and nature- 
poems, and his three masterpieces; Kuyil 
Pattu (an allegorical narrative), Kannan 
Pattu (lyrics in a variety of moods on 
Lord Krishna) and Panchali Sapatham 
(the Vow of Panchali, an epic fragment 
from the Mahabharata filled with thrill- 
ing contemporary overtones). [|

’ IG ’ 
PIE hod rh SY 
  
The history of Viet Nam 
new book by Mr. Lé& Thanh Khai, 
a teacher at the Sorbonne and a 
Unesco consultant, presents the 
fullest portrait so far of the history of Viet 
Nam from its origins to 1858 {the date of 
French intervention). Drawing on the best 
Vietnamese, Chinese and European 
sources, and taking account of the most 
recent archaeological discoveries in Viet 
Nam, the author traces the development 
of Vietnamese civilization. 
The earliest Vietnamese kingdom, Van 
Lang, appeared during the Bronze Age, 
some time inthe seventh century BC. The 
dispersion pattern of the famous decorated 
drums of Dong-son reveals how its culture 
spread through southern China and south- 
east Asia. It shared many characteristics 
with other cultures of the region, including 
slash and burn farming, irrigation, the use 
of stone hoes and bronze ploughs, 
totemism, tattooing and building on piles. 
VietNam was invaded by the Han in the 
second century BC, and for over a thou- 
sand years formed part of the Chinese em- 
pire which introduced iron and brought 
Confucianism and Taoism (Buddhism 
came from the south). But integration on- 
ly went so far. Thanks to a vigorous and 
firmly established culture, to the economic 
32 
base offered by the Red River delta, to a 
relatively numerous population and to the 
solid structure of their village communities, 
the Viet were able (and here, perhaps, they 
are aunique case among the peoples south 
of the Yangtze) to preserve their identity 
and their language and finally, after many 
vicissitudes, to recover their independence 
in the twentieth century. 
The construction of the Vietnamese na- 
tion followed a dual rhythm: resistance to 
periodic invasions from the north, and the 
“march to the south’’ of a farming people 
which, pressing forward to conquer new 
lands, clashed first with the Chams and 
then with the Khmers. The monarchical 
system, at first “’patrimonial’’ and based 
ontheroyal clan, became ‘‘bureaucratic’’ 
in the fifteenth century with Confucianism 
as the official doctrine and a corps of of- 
ficials recruited by civil service examina- 
tions of a literary nature. 
But after a period of vigour Confucianism 
lost its vitality. In the nineteenth century, 
before foreign intervention, acombination 
of intellectual rigidity, economic stagnation 
and social tensions which resulted in 
numerous peasant revolts, sounded the 
death knell of the monarchy. In literature, 
however, the eighteenth and early nine- 
teenth century saw the flowering of Viet- 
namese poetry. The author traces the 
social significance of this poetry and 
translates some fine examples of it. 
Mr. Lé Thanh Khéi’s work provides a 
unique synthesis of the political history and 
cultural development of Viet Nam. It is 
richly documented and illustrated: there 
are over a hundred illustrations of 
prehistoric objects, Dong-son drums, 
religious, civil and military architecture, 
sculpture, painting, ceramics and calli 
graphy. It is also an illuminating personal 
contribution to historical debate on such 
issues as the formation of Vietnamese na- 
tionality, the ""feudal’’ or“ Asiatic’’ nature 
of the ancient system of production, and 
the re-establishment of Vietnamese unity’ 
in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. 
Itis anindispensable reference book not 
only for specialists and teachers but for the 
general reader and all those who are in- 
terested in Viet Nam and want to under- 
stand in depth certain aspects of the situa- 
tion there today.

### 50957: Hue, a city in peril

 Once the capital of the Nguyen dynasty, the city of Hue, in Viet Nam, 
stands on the north bank of the River of Perfumes, twelve kilometres 
from the coast. Grouped within the ‘‘lmperial City’’ and the ‘‘Forbid- 
den Purple City’‘. which constituted the heart of the royal capital, are 
a number of early 19th-century buildings or remains of buildings of high 
artistic and architectural interest. To this huge urban architectural com- 
plex must be added the seven royal tombs, situated a few kilometres 
to the south of the city, with their temples, palaces and gardens. To- 
day this shrine of Vietnamese culture is in a serious state of deteriora- 
tion. In addition to the damage resulting from the terrible fire of 1947 
and the fighting which took place there in 1968, the buildings are suf- 
fering from the encroachment of tropical vegetation and the ravages 
of time. At the end of the war, in 1975, the Government of the Socialist 
Republic of Viet Nam began carrying out the most urgent provisional 
protection measures. In November 1981, within the context of Unesco’s 
general aim of preserving the cultural heritage of mankind, Mr. Amadou- 
Mahtar M'Bow, the Director-General of Unesco, launched an interna- 
tional appeal for the preservation and restoration of the city of Hue. The 
initial stage of the long-term project adopted by the Unesco General Con- 
ference covers the restoration or reconstruction of fifteen monuments 
and two tombs over the period 1981 to 1986. Photos show: {1) The 
eastern entrance to the Imperial City; {2) The tomb of Minh Mang; {3)
