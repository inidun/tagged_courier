Inequality costs lives 
International Women’s Day was first honoured one hundred years ago in a 
handful of European countries. Since then, the celebration has become global, 
and much has been achieved. The 2011 International Women's Day is an 
opportunity to celebrate achievements and mobilize against the challenges 
that remain. 
There is no room for complacency. Less than 40 percent of countries 
provide girls and boys with equal access to education. Had we reached gender 
parity in primary education in 2008, there would have been an additional 3.6 
million girls in school. Disparities have increased at the secondary level in 
Africa over the last decade. Only 29 percent of researchers in the world today 
are women. Two-thirds of the world’s 796 million illiterate adults are women. 
The impact is serious. Inequality costs lives in terms of child mortality. It 
blights lives in terms of poverty and marginalization. And it slights lives in 
terms of opportunities for growth and development. 
Gender equality is a red thread weaving through all UNESCO activities to 
promote international cooperation in education, the sciences, culture, 
communication and information. We seek to promote basic human rights in 
order to transform our societies and lay the foundations for equitable and 
sustainable human development. 
This year’s International Women's Day is inspired by the theme of ‘Equal 
access to education, training and science and technology: Pathway to decent work 
for women. This goes to the heart of UNESCO's mission. We work to strengthen 
the bridges between education, training, science and technology and the 
labour market in order to promote equal opportunity to decent employment. 
This starts early, with quality education for all girls and young women from the 
primary to the tertiary level. It continues with vocational training and 
education for women who have not acquired basic skills. It proceeds with 
creating positive role models and career tracks — especially in such areas as 
science and technology.

### 191542: A Matter of commitment

  
commitment 
Interview with Michaélle Jean by Katerina Markelova 
How does a Haitian woman immigrant 
become governor-general of Canada? 
And, to top it all, with responsibilities as 
Head of State and Commander-in-Chief 
of the armed forces! (laughs) | think it’s 
first and foremost a matter of 
commitment. In Haiti | learned 
something very valuable — never remain 
indifferent! In a country where 
indifference has been responsible for 
some terrible problems, my parents 
always encouraged me to look around 
me, to develop a point of view and to 
act. | have inherited my courage, 
perseverance, pragmatism and sense of 
commitment from the women of Haiti. 
When | first arrived in Canada as a 
child, I quickly understood that 
integration meant participation. Very 
early on | started to become involved 
in the women's movement in Quebec, 
particularly by setting up a network of 
emergency refuges for battered women 
and their children. That set me on the 
path of active and responsible 
citizenship. 
That experience also brought me 
into journalism — 18 years in public 
television! Television journalists often 
find themselves moving into 
entertainment programmes, if they 
have the kind of look that stands out. 
But | was quickly assigned to the news 
service — in a newsroom, anchorwoman, 
head of broadcasting, and in front of the 
cameras.

Canada is the embodiment of 
diversity. For us, diversity is a reality, 
rooted in daily life. And, rather than see 
it as a threat, we see it as a valuable 
asset, despite all the challenges that go 
with it. Whenever | have been the victim 
of discrimination or racism — because no 
society is sheltered from these kinds of 
aberration — | always found plenty of 
people to support me, and resources 
and organisations that would stand up 
and, collectively, say “No! Not in Canada. 
That's not acceptable!” That is why a 
black woman, militant feminist to boot, 
and a former political refugee, was able 
to become Governor-general of Canada. 
What are your priorities as UNESCO 
special envoy for Haiti ? 
First of all, to make sure that we keep in 
mind the state of emergency and 
vulnerability of this country. Haiti was 
on the agenda of all the missions | have 
been on around the world, as Governor 
General of Canada. Whether in the West, 
in Latin America or Africa, | have always 
sensed the desire to be part of a pact of 
solidarity for Haiti. Given that the 
ground has already been prepared, | 
now intend to ask them for support. 
Haiti cannot get out of this alone. It’s a 
disastrous situation! But, at the same 
time, Haiti must also accept its share 
of responsibility. 
| think that the entire world is 
watching what is happening in Haiti. 
How will the international community 
respond? Will the Haitian people — and 
the Haitian state in particular — act 
responsibly? We have to succeed and 
send a message of hope to all of 
humanity. Haiti is beset with 
emergencies and miseries of every kind. 
But it is still possible to act. On one 
condition — to make sure the citizens are 
included. 
| usually say that, in Haiti, life and 
survival both depend on hope. This 
country has always been able to pick 
itself up after being knocked down. It 
triumphed over barbarity through the 
Revolution and escaped slavery by 
enfranchisement. But hope took a real 
body blow with the earthquake. 
We often hear about Haitians’ 
capacity for resilience. But | would prefer

that they were known for their 
creativity, their thinking and what they 
have to say. If we look only at their 
capacity for resilience, we will end up 
believing that these people can carry on 
waiting, because they are so good at 
holding on in the worst circumstances. 
What do you think is the role of women 
in rebuilding Haiti? 
When | went to Haiti in March 2010, | 
deliberately chose 8 March, 
International Women’s Day, to go back. 
The women of Haiti needed to hear 
someone saying that reconstruction 
would fail unless they were involved. It 
was truly amazing, amid this scene of 
total devastation, where it was almost 
impossible to go anywhere, to see 5000 
women turn out to tell me how much 
they wanted to see life triumph over 
this disaster. 
The women’s movement in Haiti is 
extremely well organized. Some leading 
women who helped to set up the 
movement across the country lost their 
lives, including some very close friends. 
All of those who survived were in 
mourning. But they were possessed by a 
limitless energy, determined to make 
sure life wins in the end! 
And what part can the diaspora play? 
The diaspora has had to overcome a 
number of challenges, and this is not 
the first time that Haiti has had to face 
difficulties. When the Duvaliers' left, in 
1986, everyone hoped for great things. 
We saw ex-patriots selling up and 
moving back home. Men, women and 
children wanted to contribute to the 
renaissance of Haiti, to the construction 
of a democratic state and to new 
governance. At that time people were 
already speaking of refounding, 
reconstruction, a new start. But it turned 
out to be a minefield. A series of coups 
and the army's straitjacket stifled any 
hope there had been. After a fleeting 
moment of euphoria, life became 
painful for Haitians for a long time. 
When the hurricanes struck in 2008 
[taking the lives of nearly 1000 people], 
| saw a bad sign — the diaspora did not 
respond. Oh, how terrible it was to see 
that! In fact, Haitians living abroad had 
1. Francois (“Papa Doc”) Duvalier and his son Jean- 
Claude (“Baby Doc") Duvalier seized power in Haiti 
from 1957 and 1986, a period characterized by 
corruption, the repression of civil rights and the 
institutionalization of fear. 
been disappointed by the behaviour of 
their compatriots in the previous years — 
the aid they had been sending home lay 
rotting in containers or was 
appropriated by corrupt officials. 
But the 2010 earthquake touched 
the hearts and minds of everybody! The 
diaspora pulled itself together and 
responded this time. As | speak to you 
now, people are struggling to join in this 
stage in the country’s development, 
which could be a turning point. People 
have said it before me — this disaster has 
to become an opportunity to act! 
On your visit to Haiti in March 2010, 
you emphasized the importance of 
education. It was during a round table 
discussion in Port-au-Prince that you 
chaired alongside the Director-General 
of UNESCO. What do expect todo in 
this area? 
Haiti is a country where it is possible to 
do a great deal in terms of education. 
Why? Because, in the very fabric of Haiti, 
in its culture, in the Haitian way of 
being, in its history, education has 
always been synonymous with 
emancipation and access to freedom. In 
the plantations, the slaves remained 
illiterate. But there was also another 
category of people — the children that 
the masters had with their slaves. These 
children were not sent to the 
plantations and were taught to read and 
write. These ‘domestic slaves’ as they 
were called, had access to knowledge. 
Some even went as far to show off their 
talents. And the plantation slaves saw all 
of this. 
Today, when you see little Haitians 
going to school, you cannot imagine the 
dreadful circumstances they are being

forced to live in! But when they go off to 
school they are always pampered, they 
are beautiful, they are proud and their 
parents are proud, too. 
All these families, even the poorest, 
bend over backwards to send their 
children to school! So the conditions are 
very favourable. If we invest in 
education, if we help Haiti to build a 
quality public education system, the 
people will immediately take it on board 
as something great and useful. 
At the present moment, there is an 
incredible number of scattered 
educational projects, but there is no 
coordination. | think that UNESCO has 
all the necessary skills to play a 
leadership role in this area and to help 
the Haitian State to create a standard 
framework for schools.

In the Arab region, the debate on 
women’s rights is currently focused on 
the reform of family law. Indeed, in the 
name of an Islam raised to the rank of 
State religion, modern laws accord a 
lower status to women than to men. 
From the Middle East to North Africa a 
normative system has been constructed 
around women — and women in 
particular — that is subordinate to Sharia 
law or the figh [Islamic law and 
jurisprudence] and which, in a variety of 
forms, legitimizes a whole range of 
D womens er  nancipation in Ar 
  
) countries 
EE
amalgams, such as between religion and 
political affiliation, political 
commandment and the application of 
Sharia law, marriage and religious 
endogamy, etc. 
Family law cements the links 
between religious and political orders, 
turning the family into a citadel of male 
domination. One only has to look at the 
rules on marriage, which include 
matrimonial subjugation, a ban on 
unions between Muslims and non- 
Muslims, and relationships between 
marriage partners based on a duty of 
maintenance, giving men the 
predominant role. And then there are 
the rules of descent and kinship, which 
are based on patrilineal genealogy and 
also apply to laws on nationality — a 
woman cannot pass on her nationality 
to her husband or children. 
Of the 22 members of the League of 
Arab States, 16 signed the Convention 
on the Elimination of all Forms of 
Discrimination against Women in 1981. 
However, they have nearly all voiced 
substantial reservations, whether 
specific or general, regarding one 
measure or another in the text. It is thus 
easy to understand that the feminist 
movements that emerged in the 1980s 
rallied around public policy issues to

protest against institutionalized 
discrimination and the differences 
between universal human rights and 
national laws. 
Hostages of the political regime 
It is interesting to note that economic, 
social and cultural reforms have been 
initiated by authoritarian governments — 
often the offspring of national liberation 
movements — exploiting family relations 
as leverage for their national politics. As a 
result, civil codes regarding the individual 
and the family, although they derive their 
origins from classic Muslim law, are part 
of a legislative policy that signals a certain 
conquest of modern legislative reason. 
This was the case for the Egyptian laws of 
1917, 1920 and 1929, then laws on 
personal status in Jordan (1951 and 
1976), Syria (1953), Tunisia (1956), 
Morocco (1957-1958) and Iraq (1959). 
Other countries recently rallied behind 
this model: Algeria and Kuwait in 1984 
and, nearer home, Mauritania in 2001. In 
all of these cases, the reforms led to 
changes in the law and a restructuring of 
Islamic normative code around women. 
This is because what is at stake is siyassa 
tachriya (“the making of a legislative 
policy”), taking account of the need for 
arbitration between the principles of the 
organisation of identity and civil society’s 
demands for equality. It is precisely for 
this reason that the law on personal and 
family status oscillates between the spirit 
of tradition and the spirit of innovation. 
Furthermore, not one of these 
policies has been implemented without 
authoritarian intervention by central 
government — such as decrees from the 
Head of State (as in Tunisia, under the 
presidency of Habib Bourguiba), 
regulations arising from a state of 
emergency (as in Egypt under President 
Anwar El Sadat) or dhahir of the King (as 
in Morocco). Almost everywhere, they 
have been accompanied by the 
establishment of National Women’s 
Unions, satellite women’s organizations, 
heavily embedded within the State 
apparatus and the party in power. And 
these organizations serve as a conduit to 
disseminate social policy regarding 
maternal and child health, education and 
literacy, rural planning and development, 
the popularization of new laws on 
personal and family status. These forms of 
“State feminism” ended up by taking 
women hostage and using them as a 
shield of stability for political regimes.

Maintaining the status quo 
Today, in countries that have been taken 
over by Islamist movements and appeals 
for conformity, these texts, marred by a 
lack of democracy, still seem to have 
only a precarious hold. They may be 
called into question at any moment, as 
was the case in Egypt with the Jihan law 
of 1979 (named after Sadat’s wife), which 
allowed a woman to obtain a divorce 
automatically during the year after her 
husband's second marriage. This law was 
revoked in 1985, under the new article 2 
of the Constitution that made Islamic 
law the principle source of legislation. It 
was the same in Tunisia when President 
Bourguiba was deposed in 1987 and 
there were increasing threats of a “return 
to origins” Once again the tutelary 
intervention of top State authorities was 
required to ensure that the law on 
personal status was not touched, that its 
In December 2008, Sana Ben Achour 
was elected president of the Tunisian 
association of women democrats (ATFD), 
whose main objective is the adoption of 
universal values of gender equality, 
human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as campaigning for the 
financial and social rights of women. 
A graduate in civil law and lecturer in the 
Faculty of legal, political and social 
sciences of Tunis, Sana Ben Achour is also 
a member of the Tunisian League of 
Human Rights (LTDH).

principles became an accepted national 
fact, and to come down hard on the 
Islamist movement — once it had been 
‘normalized’ - and, while they were at it, 
on the democrats too. 
In other words, behind the scenes of 
these legislative policies on the family, 
not only the reform of traditional law is 
at stake, but maintaining the status quo. 
Any questioning of the traditional 
asymmetry between the rights of men 
and the rights of women would be a 
threat to established public order. And 
those in power permanently renew this 
asymmetry when they grant legal 
guarantees to women without ever 
letting go of male superiority. And it is 
upon this arbitration that the reform of 
patriarchal consensus draws. If an 
example were needed, it would be 
Tunisia, because, in the wider landscape 
of family law in Islamic countries, it is 
undoubtedly the country that has gone 
furthest in terms of transgressing 
against holy law — divorce by mutual 
consent legalized as early as 1956, the 
right to vote for women in 1957, 
legalized abortion from 1962... But, like 
the other countries, it has not been able 
to halt male privilege. Which means the 
husband as head of the family, the 
continued practice of the dowry — even 
if it is just a symbolic dinar — as a 
condition for marriage, the two- 
thirds/one-third rule in favour of males 
for dividing an inheritance, etc. Under 
these conditions, one can measure the 
gulf that separates the words of 
politicians on reforms of the law on 
individual status or improvements in 
family law from the demands of 
feminists regarding women’s 
independence, and equal and 
indivisible rights.

BU lishment 
In Mauritania, the question of slavery is closely linked to 
women because, traditionally, slave status was hereditary and 
passed on by the mother. Since 2007, slavery has been a crime 
under Mauritanian law. But, in practice, it continues in more or 
less disguised forms while the perpetrators escape 
prosecution. Lawyer Aminetou Mint El Moctar has devoted her 
life to the rights of women, especially single mothers. 
Aminetou Mint El Moctar answers questions put by Laura Martel, a journalist at RFI. 
At 55, you have already spent over four

discrimination, especially against

[Solidarity with Widows Committee] or 
SOS Esclaves (SOS Slaves). In 1999, | was 
present at the trial of a woman who had 
secretly married the head of a company 
and was fighting for their two children 
to have a share of their deceased 
father’s inheritance. The court refused to 
recognise his paternity. Hearing this 
verdict literally struck her down and she 
died on the way to hospital. With no 
husband, and so no money, no 
education, and therefore no chance of 
finding work, she knew that she and her 
children would find themselves in the 
street. She died because she was unable 
to claim her rights. It was then that | 
realised it was time to fight for these 
abandoned women, so | set up the 
Association. Today, the AFCF has over 
10,000 members and employs 62 
people. Our staff and running costs are 
all paid out of members’ subscriptions, 
while our projects are funded by donor 
agencies. 
Mauritanian society is multicultural, 
with two main ethnic strands —- Arab 
Berbers and black Africans. Do women 
have the same status in both 
communities? 
Women traditionally have the same 
function in both communities — they are 
“made for marriage and to satisfy the 
desire of men”, but that translates 
differently in daily life. The constraints 
aren’t the same. For black Africans, a 
good wife pays her way essentially with 
household duties, educating the 
children and satisfying her husband. If 
she does earn money, she generally has 
to hand it over to the “master of the 
household”. Most Arab-Berber women 
escape household chores. This is not 
just because their families are generally 
better off, but also because a woman 
has to be “preserved” to make the best 
possible marriage. Pampering her and 
feeding her up are an investment. 
Family honour depends on girls 
marrying young - “she was married 
young” being an adage frequently used 
by griots as a form of praise. The 
nomadic tradition allows more freedom 
to Arab-Berber women than their black 
African sisters, in terms of what they can 
and cannot do. And Arab-Berber 
Mauritanian women have a traditional 
concept of divorce that is quite unusual. 
Not only is it acceptable, but it can even 
give a woman added value! A woman 
who has been divorced several times is 
  
considered very sought-after. |, myself, 
have three children from different 
fathers and have been married 5, 6 or 7 
times... but now it’s finished! (laughs). 
But, for black Africans, divorce is, on the 
contrary, frowned upon, and they are 
more likely to practice polygamy than 
Arab-Berbers, although the current 
obscurantist trend means a resurgence 
of this tradition for them too. These are 
all, of course, generalisations, for which 
there are many exceptions. 
Force-feeding, child marriage, 
excision, slavery, domestic service... 
the list of human rights breaches is a 
long one. What is your priority? 
The most urgent task is to establish a 
legal basis for equality between men 
and women. For centuries jurisprudence 
has mixed up religious imperatives and 
tradition to create a cocktail of 
discrimination. In Mauritania, a woman 
has a legal guardian for her entire life. It 
might be her father, her husband or 
even her son. She has no rights of her 
own. Let us take marriage as an 
example. According to the civil code, 
the legal age for marriage is 18 years, 
but with the guardian’s consent, it may 
be celebrated earlier. This, in a way, 
legalises childhood marriages and 
deprives women of the power to decide. 
That was how, one day, when | came 
home from school, | discovered | had 
been married to a friend of my father. |

Also, when inheritances are divided 
up, two-thirds go to the boys, one third 
to the girls, while only the husband can 
initiate a divorce. Mauritania signed the 
Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW), but added two reservations, 
precisely on divorce and inheritance. 
AFCF is currently campaigning to get 
these two reservations lifted. It is by 
inscribing equality between men and 
women in the law that we will acquire 
the weapons to combat concrete acts of 
discrimination, even if this is just the 
first step because many laws are not 
applied. 
This is particularly true of the 2007 law 
that makes slavery a criminal offence. 
You often point out that no one has 
been convicted since this law was 
passed. Does this mean that there are 
no more slaves in Mauritania? 
It's difficult to quantify because the 
subject is taboo. Nevertheless, we know 
that slavery still goes on, because we 
regularly pick up victims. Along with 
other associations, AFCF has denounced

cases of slavery to the authorities on 
several occasions, but so far, no action 
has been taken and no one has been 
convicted. The “masters” are people with 
high positions and are protected. 
The question of slavery is intimately 
linked to women, since, according to 
tradition, it is hereditary and passed 
down through the mother. That means 
it is more advantageous for a “master” to 
have female slaves, because he can then 
appropriate their offspring. Even so, this 
traditional form of slavery, where 
individuals are the property of a master 
from one generation to the next, is on 
the decline. Unfortunately it is being 
replaced by a more ‘modern’ form of 
slavery — domestic service. Poor families 
place their daughters with rich families, 
where they often receive only board 
and lodging. These girls, who are usually 
very young, receive no education and it 
is not uncommon for them to be 
beaten. There are many of them in 
Nouakchott. They mostly come from 
rural areas of the country, but also from 
neighbouring states like Senegal, Mali 
or Gambia. In 2009, with the 
international human rights 
organization, Terre des Hommes, we 
launched a programme that enabled us 
to help 2200 minors. 
One day, when | came home 
from school, | discovered | had 
been married to a friend of my 
father. [was 13 years old 
Do you see Mauritania as a hub for 
trafficking children? 
This form of traffic has existed for a long 
time, but has grown over the past few 
years. The traffickers seek out children in 
poor families in rural areas, promising 
their parents that they will find their 
girls work, or a religious pilgrimage, a 
favourable marriage, a sum of money, 
etc. The girls transit through 
Nouakchott, before being taken to the 
Gulf, where they are sold and married. If 
they are black, their skin is lightened. 
Once they reach the age of 18 or 20, 
their husbands throw them out into the 
street, because they are no longer 
young enough for their taste; most then 
fall into prostitution. If they are still 
minors, they may be deported. Three 
years ago | met 14 girls at the airport, all 
about 15 years old, who had lived 
through this ordeal and did not know 
where to go. The prostitution ring also 
extends out to Europe. AFCF is currently 
looking for funding for a survey to 
determine the extent of this 
phenomenon. 
Are there any areas where you can see 
progress ? 
Excision! Even though it is disappearing 
very slowly, this practice is beginning to 
be abandoned collectively, mostly as a 
result of a number of agreements and 
action by donor organizations, which 
have been providing substantial 
funding, as well as the commitment of 
some highly placed religious figures. 
A fatwa [religious law] was signed 
against excision in 2010. The police and 
the judiciary have also been made more 
aware of the issues, but once again, 
there have been virtually no 
convictions. 
Force-feeding is also on the decline, 
mostly because of a gradual change in 
concepts of beauty. But over 20% of 
Mauritanian girls jeopardize their health 
in an effort to put on weight, even if the 
traditional methods have nowadays 
been replaced by food supplements, 
often with dangerous side effects. 
And then there is political 
representation, where we made clear 
gains between 2005 and 2007, 
particularly with the establishment of a 
20% quota for women in elected 
institutions. Today, we do have a female 
Minister of foreign affairs, but the 
number of senior positions held by 
women (such as Secretary of state, 
police chief, governor) has been falling 
since 2008. Symbolically, the Ministry for 
the Advancement of Women has once 
again been merged within the Ministry 
of Social Affairs. Meanwhile, Mauritania, 
like some other countries, is under 
pressure from right-wing factions that 
want to reassign women to a more 
primitive role. 
What do you recommend women 
should do to defend their rights? 
Traditionally, women do not follow any 
in-depth religious instruction, learning 
“just what is needed to pray” But a 
better understanding of religion would 
enable them to free themselves from 
certain practices. They would know, for 
example, that the Koran does not 
impose excision and polygamy. | also 
think that religions, including Islam, 
have to adapt to the modern world — we 
should be lobbying religious scholars 
for a‘'modern’ exegesis of the scriptures. 
In Mauritania there is a majority of 
women —- some 52% of the population. 
There is, then, the potential to develop a 
female elite, able to overcome racial and 
ideological schisms. AFCF, in 
collaboration with the American 
NGOWomen'’s Learning Partnership 
trains 100 women each year in 
leadership skills. Politics is one means 
towards our ends, but it may not 
necessarily be the best, because many 
women, once in power, look after their 
own interests first. What is needed is 
collective awareness of the issues. It is 
starting. 
Why did you not go into politics? 
Because | prefer to work at grassroots 
level, with the victims. It is by getting 
women into the streets that we will gain 
most power. | know that it is a slow 
process, but | do get the feeling we are 
at a turning point — the efforts of our 
Association were rewarded with France's 
Human Rights Prize in 2007, and the 
Heroes Acting To End Modern-Day 
Slavery Award from the US Department 
of State in 2010. This encourages more 
international organizations to fund our 
projects.

Sultana Kamal was interviewed by 
Anbarasan Ethirajan, Indian 
journalist for the BBC in Bangladesh. 
    
Women may hold top political posts in Bangladesh, yet discrimination because of gender is 
institutionalized, says women’s rights activist Sultana Kamal. In this secular country where 
Islam remains the state religion, the rise of fundamentalism and disruptions in the democratic 
process are having a direct impact on women’s status. 
Bangladesh will be celebrating its 40th 
anniversary of liberation this year. 
How has life changed for women over 
these decades? 
Lots of things have changed in the last 
40 years. To begin with, generally 
women are much more conscious of 
their rights now. They are much 
stronger on demanding their rights and 
also very vocal on the political and 
social scene. 
Of course it is not the same 
everywhere in the country, and it could 
have been much better, if not for the 
interruptions in the democratic process 
or the rise of fundamentalism. But in 
general, the people have never ever 
endorsed the orthodox type of religion. 
That is why women always benefited 
from a very liberal atmosphere that 
gave them the leverage to debate and 
to take part in lots of things. 
The prime minister of Bangladesh, 
Sheikh Hasina, and the opposition 
leader, Khaleda Zia, are women, which 
is quite unusual for a Muslim majority 
country. 
| like the way you put the question — you 
think it is very unusual for a Muslim 
majority country. Yes, Bangladesh is a 
Muslim majority country but we do not 
call ourselves a Muslim country. Itis a 
country where people of many religions 
live, many cultures are alive in 
Bangladesh and very well loved and

respected. But we have to be very 
honest about the women we see at the 
top. They are not there because they are 
women or because they have come 
through a process which has actually 
supported women’s emancipation. They 
are there because they bear a legacy. 
| would be very honest here - when 
we vote for Sheikh Hasina, we in fact 
vote for her late father Sheikh Mujibur 
Rahman, the first president of the 
country. When we vote for Khaleda Zia 
we vote for her late husband, General 
Ziaur Rahman, the former military 
dictator. People still bear the images of 
these two very well known leaders. 
But then again the very fact that the 
two women are there, running the

country and really taking control of 
situations, gives other women a sense of 
confidence, a belief that women can do it. 
Which identity is dominant in 
Bangladesh? Bengali identity or 
Islamic identity? 
Many people wonder whether they are 
Muslim or Bengali first. This struggle has 
its roots in the Pakistani period. The 
main challenge to the people of East 
Pakistan from the Pakistani military 
rulers was that you had to prove you 
were a loyal Pakistani. You had to prove 
you were a true Muslim. They actually 
merged two identities together. 
But people in Bangladesh generally 
believe that we can have multiple 
identities. Yes, | am a Muslim or born to 
a Muslim family, | am also a Bengali, a 
woman, a human rights activist. | am 
known by many different names. So 
likewise, there will be Hindus and 
Christians who will have multiple 
identities. The people of Bangladesh 
basically believe in pluralism, they 
believe in Sufism. Their way of relating 
to nature, to God, to whatever mysteries 
of life, is dependent on their own 
perception of self and nature. 
People’s love of Bangladesh is mixed 
with love of the rivers, trees and nature. 
It is very much related to the basic 
harmony that they want to see 
everywhere. It is not a confrontational 
culture, but one was created artificially, 
constantly supported by forces in the 
society that have been able to capture 
power and influence through the 
economic system, educational system 
and cultural inputs. 
Have Islamist fundamentalist forces 
changed social and cultural life within 
Bangladesh? 
The fundamentalists have captured the 
main sectors of the society, like banking, 
insurance, medical and education. And 
the worst influence is on education 
because they have changed all the 
curricula, they have changed all kinds of 
information methods in the country. 
People must accept the lessons they 
teach or surrender to what they think is 
the correct path of religion. 
They get into power or stay in power 
by using the tool of fear. Whatever 
degradation in society we see in 
Bangladesh was because they used 
weapons. They use religion, which tell us 
you cannot question anything, soit is 
absolute surrender or nothing. It’s a 
question of faith, nothing else. 
They are using freedom of 
expression, democratic opportunities, to 
give religious orders. They keep saying 
we want the head of this person or this 
individual should be hanged because he 
is a traitor, whatever this person has said 
is sacrilegious. These tactics scare people. 
But you also notice that not many people 
actually support all these efforts. They 
talk against them and make their 
opinions known as soon as they know 
there will be not be any repercussion or 
retaliation by the fundamentalist forces. 
But there are other forces in the society 
which support them, give them courage 
and will protect them when they are at 
risk and that is what happens each time 
we have an election. 
There have been a number of court 
rulings in recent years that no woman 
should be forced to wear a burqa or veil. 
But if you go outside the capital people 
are still wearing traditional Islamic 
dress. 
We have to remember women in rural 
areas have little means of supporting 
themselves economically or socially. All 
these people probably belong to the 
lower middle class or poor sections of 
the society, so their struggle is very basic. 
They are using these tactics to at least 
get out of the house. As they tell us, 
‘Unless | wear a burga, my family will not 
allow me to go out! So, only to go to 
school, or work or a meeting, they have 
to use the burqa. 
How does it happen? In the rural 
areas the men are also denied 
opportunities and bullied by the social 
leaders. Unfortunately, the social leaders 
are also connected to religious hierarchy 
and push the men to control their 
women in that way. And since for many 
years this country was ruled by the 
generals who had a very strong alliance 
with the religious forces, all these things 
were promoted, deliberately nurtured 
and protected by the state. That is why 
it will not be so easy for all women to 
refuse from one day to the next to wear 
the burqa. 
You see many more burgas now in 
Bangladesh than we saw in the Pakistani 
time. This is an outcome of disruptions 
in the democratic system where people 
were forced to surrender to certain 
powers, to be silenced so that they do 
not revive the spirit of the liberation war 
of 1971. There was a direct conflict 
between hard line groups opposed to 
our independence and the powers that 
actually fought for the liberation of 
Bangladesh.

Let's talk about another major issue, 
attacks on women that include throwing 
acid on them and sexual harassment of 
young girls, which lead to suicide in 
many cases. Can these practices be 
controlled only by enacting law? 
It is a social problem and it has to be dealt 
with by social forces. We should create an 
atmosphere where women will get 
enough confidence that they can fight it. 
Also, the state, the society and the families 
will have to be involved in protecting 
women. We need to explain this to the 
families. We have to make it clear that 
women have equal rights and dignity in 
the country and that has to be 
maintained. There cannot be any 
compromise there. There has to be a 
social movement about it. But then laws 
are also helpful because they give you a 
kind of a power and confidence that you 
can also fight these legally. 
Gender bias and prejudice against 
women - is it institutionalised in 
Bangladesh? 
| would say yes, if you look at the personal 
laws that exist in the country. According 
to these laws, people are governed by 
their religious laws and those are very 
clearly discriminating against women. But 
the state is not doing anything about it. 
We have been demanding since 1972 that 
there should be a uniform civil code or 
family code for everybody. The 
government is not able to do anything 
about that and we still have a very 
confused view of what is positive

discrimination, what is equity, what is an 
affirmative action? So there is a lot of 
resistance within the society reflected in 
the state policies. 
There is controversy over how 
Bangladesh is treating the Rohingya 
ethnic refugees who fled alleged 
persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. 
What's your view on this? 
One impression | have is that these people 
are also being used by supporters of 
fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh. 
That's one thing. The other problem as | 
heard from our foreign minister is 
economic. The minute you recognize 
them as refugees and you start dealing 
with them according to the treaties, it 
represents an economic burden 
Bangladesh is not prepared for. 
Population is another problem. 
Bangladesh is not being able to deal with 
such a huge population. 
On the other hand, as a human 
rights activist | would like to say yes, all 
these problems are there. But there 
should be a decent way of dealing with 
them. | strongly feel that these people 
also have certain rights and those rights 
should be respected. 
Tell us about yourself. What prompted 
you to become a women’s rights activist? 
| was brought up among people who 
were social activists, political activists. 
My parents were deeply involved in the 
anti-British movement. Then my mother 
became the pioneer of the women’s 
movement in Bangladesh. She took a 
leading role in the language movement 
and also in the 1950s and 1960s cultural 
movements. 
  
| got involved in public life during 
the country’s liberation war. | was in 
India for some months during the nine- 
month war. With my sister, | set up a 
hospital for the wounded freedom 
fighters. Before then | was engaged in 
helping people with information, 
shelter, assisting them to cross the 
border. 
After our liberation in 1971, | started 
working with women affected by the 
war, because many came to my mother 
with a lot of problems. A number of 
women had lost their husbands and had 
difficulties with their in-laws. Many 
women wanted to remarry and keep 
their children. That is how | became 
interested in law and became a lawyer. | 
felt | could be useful to those people, to 
help them realise they do have rights 
and they can live with dignity. 
You were threatened on many 
occasions and there were attempts on 
your life. Did you ever feel you were 
ready to quit? 
Not really, because | learnt from my 
parents that the minute you quit, that is 
half the defeat. Why let others feel that 
they have won and abandon the causes 
you are fighting for? That is the strength 
of life: you will only lose your life once. 
The fundamentalists did not 
approve of my marriage to a Hindu, or 
to the people that | associated with, so 
they set fire to my house in 1995. We 
almost died. Later they threw a bomb. 
But | never worried about my own well- 
being or my own life. Yes, | have 
responsibility towards my husband and 
my daughter. They have a claim on my 
life. But the way | was brought up and 
the way | started understanding the 
issues of life taught me that you should 
never be afraid. Being afraid is not the 
solution. m

If we do not speak out, we are accomplices, says Ménica Gonzalez Mujjica, laureate of the 
2010 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. Jailed and tortured during the 
dictatorship in Chile, she never relinquished her right to free speech. Denouncing injustice 
is what counts for her, beyond gender barriers. 
Monica Gonzalez Mujica gave an interview to Carolina Jerez and Lucia Iglesias (UNESCO) 
Do women do journalism differently? 
As a woman journalist, what were your 
advantages and the obstacles you had 
to overcome throughout your career? 
Let's talk first about the advantages of 
being a woman, because there are 
some. We have a particular sensitivity, 
which | think is very useful for 
investigative journalism — a greater 
capacity for perceiving who is telling the 
truth, who is lying, who is hiding behind 
a shield, a mask or a disguise. | also feel 
that when women undertake 
something, we are more persistent and 
we only ease up when the work is done. 
We're hard-headed! And | say that 
without being a feminist. 
Of course there are obstacles, 
particularly when aggressors, torturers, 
attack us sexually in order to destroy us. | 
discovered under the dictatorship that 
rape is primarily intended to break us. No 
one could enjoy raping a woman. The 
pleasure is to humiliate a woman and rob 
her of her identity. But in my case, on the 
contrary, it made me stronger. 
What do you consider your greatest 
professional success? 
The most important accomplishment 
for me was to be able to go from 
dictatorship to democracy without 
giving up journalism. | never gave it up 
during the dictatorship, not in jail, not 
under torture, not when my friends 
were killed, or when | had to be

2006 © Eduardo Aguayo, Santiago 
separated from my daughters, or when 
| shared the pain of so many people in 
this country. When democracy came, 
| felt that there was so much to build. 
What | did right was not to give up 
journalism and | found a new way to 
continue every time | was unemployed. 
| managed to do this thanks to the 
assistance of many people -1am not a 
Superwoman. | am grateful to have met 
people who supported me and 
encouraged me to persevere when | was 
the most afraid. In this profession, you 
are put to the test every day and | want 
this to go on until | die. 
What is the situation of investigative 
journalism today? 
It is without any doubt the type of 
journalism most severely under attack 
everywhere. Investigation was the first 
victim of the economic crisis of 2008. It 
was the most expensive journalists that 
were laid off first, those who were 
dedicated to investigation. As the 
investigation’s journalism often is source 
of problems and conflicts, the crisis was 
a wonderful excuse to get rid of the 
desk best equipped to investigate the 
real, pressing issues that were decisive 
for the lives of citizens.

### 191562: Standing up to tyranny

However, | must stress that the 
quality of investigative journalism in 
Latin America is at least as high as that of 
investigative journalism in English- 
speaking countries. And not only today, 
because we also did this type of work 
under dictatorships. In Chile, for example, 
journalists denounced the Pinochet 
regime crimes under his dictatorship, 
running incredible risks. Either journalists 
have to denounce crimes and atrocities 
or they become accomplices. And it is 
true that investigative journalism always 
involves great personal sacrifices and the 
use of the journalist's own funds, 
because, let's face it, no media 
organization will pay journalists for 
months so they can carry out an in-depth 
investigation into an issue and reveal it to 
the world. 
Basically, | think that Latino-American 
investigative journalism is facing a major 
problem: the drug cartels are eroding our 
societies. Their final objective is to deprive 
us of pleasure, happiness and life. This is 
why it is so important to attack them, and 
itis also why it is so important to 
guarantee that journalists can investigate 
and inform, contrary to the current 
practice in most countries’ regions. 
What is your view of the media 
landscape in Latin America? 
Two problems pose an increasingly 
urgent threat to the right of society to be 
informed. First: the formidable 
concentration of media ownership. 
Groups take control of several media 
companies thus consolidating television, 
radio and the written press, while they 
maintain interests in other sectors of 
production, such as agriculture, mining, 
services, real estate, etc. A media 
company cannot provide objective 
reporting on corporations of which its 
owner has shares. This is very serious. 
Journalists are losing their 
independence, their dignity and 
essential skills. 
The second threat comes from 
authoritarian governments, which, 
although they came to power 
democratically, make journalists their 
enemies and submit them to constant 
threats. Here, once more, there is 
unfortunately no opposition able to 
defend freedom of information properly. 
Because freedom of information is not 
about supporting the government or the 
opposition, it is about providing quality 
journalism. Just as it is intolerable that

organized crime cartels go to war on 
journalists, it is unacceptable for 
democratically elected governments to 
engage in authoritarian practices. 
All this to say the Latin-American 
landscape of media industry is, 
objectively speaking, discouraging; it 
shows the precariousness of journalism. 
This is having a deep effect on society. 
It is democracy as a whole that is 
undermined, because a badly informed 
citizen easily becomes prey to petty 
tyrants. We who lived through 
dictatorships and who regained freedom 
only at the cost of people's lives consider 
that we cannot let democracy get weak 
and be manipulated by authoritarian 
powers again.

with the promotion of girls and women’s 
right to education, UNESCO's work to 
promote this goal has extended to all 
levels and aspects of education, the 
natural and social sciences, the 
information and communication sector 
and the complex and rich field of culture. 
In a landmark decision taken by 
UNESCO's Member States in 2007, 
UNESCO made its greatest commitment 
to the achievement of these goals by 
designating “Gender Equality” as one of 
its two global priorities for the 2008-2013 
period. 
What is Priority “Gender Equality”? 
For UNESCO, gender equality is a 
fundamental right, a commonly shared 
value and a necessary condition for the 
achievement of all internationally agreed 
development objectives. Gender equality 
is not only central to efforts to fight 
extreme poverty but it is also related to 
the global quest to limit the spread of HIV 
1. Irina Bokova on the occasion of her installation as 
Director-General of UNESCO, 23 October 2009 
and AIDS, mitigate the effects of climate 
change and achieve sustainable 
development and peace. 
UNESCO's approach and selected 
initiatives 
In its Member States and within the 
Organization, UNESCO pursues gender 
equality through a dual approach: on the 
one hand, it is engaged in actions that 
specifically seek to redress inequalities by 
targeting women and girls or men and 
boys alone and, on the other, it ensures 
that all of its programmes support gender 
equality goals through gender 
mainstreaming. 
In the area of Education, UNESCO 
strives to redress gender inequalities at all 
levels in terms of access, retention, 
completion, and quality. This includes the 
promotion of women’s increased 
participation in science, technology, 
innovation and research, as well as in 
areas such as the ethics of science, culture 
and human rights. 
UNESCO's Communication and 
Information programme aims to address 
the stereotyping of women and 
inequalities in women’s access to and 
participation in all communication 
information systems. It raises awareness 
among professionals regarding the need 
to include a gender equality perspective 
in media content. 
The Organization also works 
towards the promotion of women’s 
empowerment and gender equality 
through the integration of these 
considerations into its normative work 
in areas such as the ethics of science, 
culture and human rights. 
Within UNESCO, the Division for 
Gender Equality in the office of the 
Director-General is the key contact for 
ensuring the implementation of 
UNESCO's Global Priority Gender 
Equality. The Division aims to raise 
awareness of gender equality issues 
within the Secretariat - and among its 
Member States. 
UNESCO formulated a Priority Gender 
Equality Action Plan (GEAP) for 2008-2013 
as a road map to translate its commitment 
to gender equality into practice, to ensure 
that UNESCO programmes and initiatives 
contribute fully and actively to the pursuit 
of women’s rights, women’s 
empowerment and gender equality. 
The road to gender equality may yet 
be long and there is still a lot of hard work 
to be done, but on this 8 March 2011, we 
wish to celebrate women and the 
creation of the historic new UN Entity for 
Gender Equality and the Empowerment 
of Women — UN Women.

for Gender Equality
