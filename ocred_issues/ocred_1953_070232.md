cause this is essentially a matter 
of education that Unesco ‘was 
founded. 
1f Unesco were only an office

impossible. It is more than that : 
it is an association of some sixty-

### 189444: UNESCO and education for international understanding: an explanation for older children at school

FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING 
An explanation for older children at school 
may not have the same outlook as 
our own. And we need know- 
ledge of what these differences are 
so that we can understand each 
other and co-operate better. In 
forming these attitudes and in 
giving this knowledge what hap- 
pens in school is important. 
Dictators who have ‘wanted to 
organize their people for war have 
always done two things in their 
schools : they have used authori- 
tarian methods so that children 
grow up not as free and respon- 
sible persons but as unquestioning 
servants of the dictator’s will; and 
they have twisted what was taught 
about other countries so that hate 
was engendered instead of under- 
standing. Education among de- 
mocratic and peace-loving peoples 
will do the opposite of these things. 
It will encourage schools them- 
selves to be communities, in which 
children, though they have to 
follow certain rules for the com- 
mon good, ‘will follow them hap- 
pily, and indeed help to carry them 
out, because they are treated as real 
persons capable of showing initia- 
tive and of thinking for themselves. 
Let me give one example of the 
way in which Unesco helps forward 
such an aim. It is our duty to 
spread understanding of Human 
Rights. We called an interna- 
tional meeting of teachers last year 
to discuss how this might be done 
in schools, and we are publishing 
a practical handbook on the subject 
this year. In both you will find 
emphasis on the idea that, though 
older children might be expected 
to know something of the Uni- 
versal Declaration itself, the im- 
portant things are that the idea of 
human rights should be encou- 
raged through the teaching of 
present school subjects, and that 
schools themselves should be com- 
munities where human rights are 
observed. 
The provision of direct inform%- 
tion about other countries becomes 
more important as one goes 
through the school. We must 
have such information if we are to 
make intelligent decisions about 
‘what our own country ought to do 
in international affairs. Even 
from our own country’s point of 
view (apart from that of mankind 
as a whole) it is important that 
information be accurate in fact and 
that comment be fair in tone. 
Much of our teaching concentrates, 
quite rightly, on telling us about 
the history and the geography and 
the achievements of our own coun- 
trv. This sometimes leads us, 
though it need not, to under- 
estimate the achievements and the 
ways of life of ovhers. There is 
now no country so distant from us 
that we may not be involved, 
through something that happens 
there, in major difficulties, or in 
war itself. How many of you knew 
‘where Korea was, or really under- 
stood what the phrase “Collective 
Security ” meant, until the inva- 
sion of South Korea almost three 
years ago ? 
In all these malters Unesco is 
active. We have called meetings 
of teachers from many countries to 
consider how the teaching of cer- 
tain school subjects, like history 
and geography, can help to give us 
a better understanding of other 
peoples. This year we are holding 
a similar international meeting to 
discuss how the “grind” of lan- 
guage teaching can be speeded up 
so that we can really use a foreign 
language as a key to open an inter- 
esting civilization to our minds. 
Unesco has stimulated the estab- 
lishment of over twenty commit- 
tees of scholars to compare their 
national textbooks and see if they 
can agree on accounts of controver- 
sial matters which seem fair in 
all the countries concerned. 
Through a series of publications 
we are encouraging teaching about 
the United Nations and its essential 
role in keeping the peace and pro- 
moting the common welfare of 
mankind. I think you will agree 
that these are all important things 
to do through Unesco. 
Now ‘what do you think could be 
done in your school to give you a 
better understanding of other peo- 
ples, and of the United Nations and 
its ‘work? And how could that be 
done without overcrowding the 
time-table so that you yourself 
would protest? You will be reading 
this article either in English or in 
French or in Spanish. If you like 
to think this problem out in terms 
of your school and talk to your 
friends and your teachers about it 
and then write to me in whichever 
of the three languages you use I 
‘will be interested to read what you 
write. And if I do not have time to 
discuss what you say in detail I 
will at least thank you from our 
Unesco headquarters. 
EVERY YEAR SINCE 1922, «GOODWILL DAY» HAS BEEN CELEBRATED ON MAY 18 BY THE CHILDREN OF WALES AND BY CHILDREN OF MANY OTHER LANDS. (UNESCO PHOTO.)

— N the aver- 
— 1 age Amer- 
ican home 
blessed 
with young 
children, the 
parents’ have 
three constant 
problems. 
One is to in- 
+" duce the chil- 
dren to eat properly—to down the 
spinach before the dessert. An- 
other is to make them dress pro- 
perly—rubbers in the rain, muf- 
flers in cold weather. The third 
is to get them to the doctor or den- 
tist—on schedule. 
But, for most American children, 
the spinach, the rubbers and the 
doctor are available. 
For more than half the children 
on earth they are not. 
There are about 900 million 
children under fifteen on earth 
today. More than half—about 500 
million—live and die in want. 
The youngsters may never have 
tasted milk, or worn shoes or visit- 
ed a doctor. But they are famil- 
iar with hunger and cold and 
disease. 
The only organization that even 
begins to answer their needs is 
UNICEF—the United Nations In- 
ternational Children’s Emergency 
Fund. 
Its total expenditures have been 
less than the cost of a single air- 
craft carrier. What in the world, 
you may ask, can UNICEF do with 
so little money ? That is a long, 
exciting, heart-warming story. 
It began in 1946. In Europe, 
there were 30 million children in 
dire need as a result of the war. 
First, they needed food. As soon 
   
by Eleanor 
as the United Nations General As- 
sembly had set up the organization 
and the United Nations Appeal for 
Children had brought in some 
money, UNICEF began to supply 
food, in the cheapest, most nutri- 
tious form : dried skim milk. That 
winter three million children in the 
eleven European countries hardest 
hit by aggression received enough 
milk to keep them alive. 
They needed clothing, too. UNI- 
CEF got raw materials—cotton, 
wool and leather—and these coun- 
tries made them into dresses, suits 
and shoes. 
Tuberculosis was reaching epi- 
demic proportions. UNICEF join- 
ed the Scandinavians—who start- 
ed on their own—and, ‘with a pre- 
paration called BCG, launched 
campaigns of vaccination against 
tuberculosis in children. That 
programme has developed into 
history’s largest mass vaccination 
campaign. 
Picture a European child, in the 
early post-war emergency, being 
given a cup of milk, a blanket or 
a pair of shoes, a vaccination. 
Now picture UNICEF's later 
development. 
A 13-year-old Filipino boy was 
night-blind, could not see at all 
after dark. One night he failed to 
arrive home before sunset. His 
frantic parents sent out searching 
parties. While they were beating 
the ‘woods, his mother heard 
someone approaching the house. 
Because of the firm, rapid step, 
she knew it could not be her José. 
But it ‘was! 
“Mama,” José shouted, “I can 
see!” | 
~ orkor. 


### 70233: The Children fight for life

‘THE CHILDREN FIGHT FOR LIFE’ 
ROOSEVELT 
At school, for the past few 
months, José had been getting 
shark-liver oil capsules from UNI- 
CEF. They contain vitamin A, 
lack of ‘which causes night-blind- 
ness. Playing baseball, José had 
been late starting home. 
The “cup of milk” still is basic 
in the UNICEF programme. (An 
Italian child, asked ‘what UNICEF 
meant, said: “It is the American 
word for cow”.) But it is impor- 
tant to note that the number of 
children “sitting around the UNI- 
CEF food table” has declined from 
an early post-war figure of seven 
millions to half that. Of those 
still being fed, about 575,000 are 
refugees or are living in drought- 
stricken areas. They get skim 
milk to keep them alive. 
But the rest of the milk supply 
goes for different purposes. In 
Africa, 340,000 children get skim 
milk to combat a common diet 
deficiency condition called kwashi- 
In Central America, the 
milk is distributed in UNICEF 
assisted demonstrations fo show 
its value in improving general 
child health, so as to encourage 
permanent, locally maintained 
school-feeding programmes. In 
Asia, Latin-America and the east- 
ern Mediterranean the milk goes 
to maternal and child-welfare 
centres. 
Along ‘with the milk goes fish- 
liver oil—cod-liver oil to be taken 
by the spoonful or concentrates in 
capsule form. An important med- 
ical larget is rickets, but the over- 
all aim is to set up proper diet as 
a means to better general health. 
This would be of little lasting

I TE RNR T S A 
value if under-developed countries 
went on depending on outside food 
sources. 
So, with the help of another UN 
agency called the Food and Agri- 
cultural Organization, UNICEF 
began to teach people how {o 
increase their own milk production 
and how best to use what they had, 
by pasteurization, refrigeration and 
drying. 
Out of milk conservation equip- 
ment provided by UNICEF, four- 
teen countries in Europe, the 
Middle East and Latin-America 
soon 'will offer safe, low-cost or 
free milk to four million children. 
From the beginning, UNICEF 
has required that all countries 
requesting assistance match UNI- 
CEF’s aid, on a dollar-for-dollar 
basis, with home-supplied effort. 
Many have done more—they have 
become substantial contributors to 
the Children’s Fund as a whole. 
The “matching” principle goes 
far. Of seven million dollars’ 
worth of textiles'and leather goods 
distributed by UNICEF up to the 
middle of 1951—to all countries in 
Europe, and to Japan and Korea in 
Asia—all ‘were processed within, 
or at the expense of, the receiving 
country, except in Korea. For 
Korea, Japan did the processing. 
Result of such “matching” : for 
the seven million dollars advanced 
by UNICEF, at least one garment 
or a pair of shoes apiece for five 
or six million youngsters. 
Dr. Roger P. Stewart has a story 
of his UNICEF ‘work in Greece 
that puts the breath of life into 
these dull figures : 
In a rain-drenched Greek village, 
shattered by war, he 'was giving 
out blankets. Outside the tent, 
mothers and grandmothers stood 
hopefully in the downpour. There 
was nothing Dr. Stewart could do 
for them. His charges ‘were the 
children—shivering, 
shoeless. 
Inside the tent, the youngsters 
received half-soaked blankets with 
incredible delight, tucked them 
under their tatters and ran home. 
But one tiny five-year-old had 
stayed at Dr. Stewart's side all 
through the proceedings, though 
told his family’s quota had been 
filled. He kept looking at Dr. Ste- 
wart with dark, trusting eyes. 
The pile of blankets dwindled to 
nothing—and still he remained. 
Dr. Stewart remembered some- 
thing in his car—an indescribable 
garment found in a batch of 
gift clothing, halfway between a 
night-shirt and an overall; rainbow 
coloured, partly cotton, partly wool 
—and frilled. 
Dr. Stewart got it out of the car 
and offered it. 
The five-year-old eyes opened 
wide. There 'was a squeak of 
rapture. 
And another UNICEF ‘worker 
saw how little it takes to win the 
eternal gratitude of children. 
Child health is a small phrase— 
with big meanings. Current 
authorized programmes, assisted 
by the UN’s World Health 
Organization, call for 58,900,000 
youngsters to be tested for tuber- 
culosis. Of these, one-third to 
one-half will be vaccinated with 
BCG anti-tuberculosis serum. For 
yaws, bejel and syphilis, 23 
million ‘are to be examined, and 
all cases of infection will be 
treated. 
Against malaria and other in- 
sect-borne diseases, protection is to 
be provided for 20 million, chiefly 
in the form of DDT sprayings.

Smaller projects, such as immu- 
nization against whooping cough 
and diphtheria, will reach one and 
a quarter million children. 
Will all this really be done? 
Sceptics may note that in Asia 
alone 9 million youngsters already 
have been tested for tuberculosis 
and 3,200,000 vaccinated; 2 million 
examined for yaws and 375,000 
treated; 1,500,000 protected against 
malaria. 
“Training” is the key word in 
much of what UNICEF does. 
The first thing is to show people 
what is best to do. But the next 
and perhaps most important step 
is to train native technicians to 
handle the procedures scienti- 
fically. After that, the technicians 
train other technicians in an ever- 
widening circle. 
All UNICEF can do is to provide 
a nucleus of knowledge and initia- 
tive, a mobile corps to be sent to 
trouble spots and a store of up-to- 
date “demonstration” materials. 
Ideally, that is all UNICEF ought 
to do, since it hopes simply to teach 
people how to help themselves. 
Nevertheless, UNICEF already 
has given direct aid to 42 million 
children in 64 different countries. 
Current programmes will raise 
those figures to 60 million children 
in 72 countries. 
When UNICEF medical supplies 
and food and clothing began to go 
out all over the globe, it ‘was 
proposed that the name should be 
translated into various languages, 
or at least that the initials forming 
it should be translated into the 
various alphabets. But there was 
a standard UNICEF symbol stamp- 
ed on each packing case. And 
before much should be done about 
the translation, “UNICEF” had 
become an actual word on the 
banks of the Ganges in India, near 
the Arctic Circle in Finland and 
along the Equator in Brazil and 
Ecuador. 
The ‘word is permanent in the 
minds of those grateful peoples. 
But UNICEF is set up as a tempo- 
rary agency, a sort of step-child 
whose future is always uncertain. 
The “E” still stands for emergency, 
though the needs of 500 million - 
children in want are anything but 
temporary. My hope—and the 
only practical salvation for those 
500 million children—is that UNI- 
CEF will be made permanent. 
Thirty little orphans in a convent 
on a border between Jewish and 
Arab territories symbolize one 
reason for my hope. UNICEF 
has sent food to the convent since 
1948, when fighting disrupted the 
area and children began to starve. 
Not long ago, the five-year-olds 
decided to show their gratitude. 
With pieces of cardboard, bits of 
coloured stone and strips of satin, 
they lovingly fashioned and dress- 
ed a ten-inch high figure. Gleam- 
ing, the figure stands on an altar 
in the kindergarten, where all can 
see and remember to give thanks 
to their benefactress. 
Her name? “Mademoiselle UN- 
ICEF.” : 
I want Mademoiselle to go on 
helping them—and helping all the 
other millions of children in the 
world who so desperately need her.

### 70234: The Enchantment of Thailand

THE ENCHANTMENT 
OF THAILAND 
by Leonard COTTRELL 
  
  
  
Two centuries ago, King Rama | chose the small village of Bangkok as the site for his new capital. 
Today it is a city of 800,000 people, whose skyline is studded with the elaborate roofs and spires 
of 400 temples, one of which, the Royal Temple, is shown above. 
IAM—what does the name con- 
jure up? Pagodas with steep, 
many tiered roofs of red and 
green tiles, with gilded, pointed 
eaves? Buddhist priests in yellow 
robes gliding among the tricycle 
taxis and swarming traffic of Bang- 
kok? A group of dancers in scarlet 
and green robes spangled with gold, 
and high, golden head-dresses, mov- 
ing gracefully through the move- 
ments of the classical dance to the 
clashing music of xylophones and 
high, thin, flutes? Those who have 
visited Thailand—the modern name 
for old Siam—will certainly recollect 
those impressions, as I do whenever 
the name is mentioned. 
But there is another side to 
Thailand. In Bangkok, the capital, 
one can buy practically everything 
the West can provide; the latest 
motorcars, refrigerators, washing 
machines, cameras, radiograms. You 
can even buy television sets, although 
Thailand as yet has no television 
service. Transmitting equipment, 
however, has been ordered. There are 
luxurious hotels, restaurants with a 
European cuisine, and, in the sub- 
urbs, beautiful modern villas set in 
  
landscape gardens, and as f‘well- 
appointed as any in London or Paris. 
Yet, side by side with huge modern 
ferro-concrete cinemas showing Hol- 
lywood films, cheek by jowl with the 
modern banks and office blocks, are 
the ancient “klongs” or canals on 
which lives an enormous, literally 
floating population of Thai families 
in covered-in boats. And as one 
drives beyond the broad, smoothly- 
asphalted Raj-Damnern Avenue one 
comes upon dusty lanes between 
rows of wooden houses raised on 
stilts above the flood-water, and sees 
mothers washing their babies in the 
same muddy water from which most 
of them have to drink. 
It is partly this clash between East 
and West that has brought about the 
need for new educational methods in 
Thailand. Not only is there an ur- 
gent need for Thai technicians to 
operate western machinery; en- 
gineers for the power-houses, build- 
ers. garage mechanics, machinists 
and so on, but, in the words of a Thai 
teacher “it is necessary to make the 
children understand the relationship 
between nations, to make them 
know their own country better and 
  
(Unesco photo) 
to understand their 
responsibility to 
improve it.” 
Thailand has had 
compulsory educa- 
tion for more than 
thirty years and 
big advances have 
been made in that 
time. All the same 
the Government 
believes that sub- 
stantial improve- 
ments could be 
made in the teach- 
ing methods. In 
1949, it invited 
Unesco to send out 
a survey mission 
to study the coun- 
try’s educational 
system, especially 
in the primary and 
secondary schools. 
After considering 
the recommenda- 
tions made by this 
mission, the Thai 
Government decid- 
ed on a ten-year 
plan to improve 
education in all its 
aspects — pre-pri- 
mary, primary, sec- 
ondary vocation- 
al, adult, and tea- 
cher training. It 
then invited Unes- 
co and other UN 
Specialized Agen- 
cies such as the 
Food and Agricul- 
tural Organization 
and the Interna- 
tional Labour Offi- 
ce, to take part 
in an experimental 
educational pilot 
project in the area 
round Cha-choeng-sao, a small town 
some seventy miles from Bangkok, 
In this area there are a number of 
Thai schools, Primary and Second- 
ary, and at Cha-choeng-sao itself 
there is a Teacher Training College. 
The idea is that in this limited area 
an attempt will be made to introduce, 
into certain selected schools, the 
new methods recommended by the 
United Nations commission. If the 
Pilot Project is a success, then the 
Government of Thailand may intro- 
duce similar methods in schools 
throughout the entire country. 
I travelled by train from Bangkok 
to Cha-choeng-sao, through mile 
after mile of completely flat country. 
Immediately outside Bangkok there 
are a few trees, chiefly bamboos, and 
here and there small cultivated plots 
—long straight rows of vegetables 
with irrigation canals between them, 
and men ‘with bare feet and huge 
straw hats moving among the plots. 
Then come the rice-flelds, mile after 
mile of pale green—the green of an 
English meadow in spring—stretch- 
ing to the horizon. Thailand is one of 
the greatest rice-producing countries 
in the Far East and the country’s 
  
— 
prosperity largely depends on the 
quality of the rice crop. 
Cha-choeng-sao itself is a small 
town, built mainly of wood, like 
most Thai country towns, and 
standing on a broad, brown river, the 
Bangpakong. Scattered around it, 
on the riverside and beside the 
innumerable canals, are smaller 
villages, each with its wooden school- 
building, usually with a balcony 
overlooking the river. It is in these 
schools that UN Agencies personnel 
and their Thai “counterparts” (for 
each adviser works alongside a Thai 
teacher or “counterpart”) are con- 
ducting their experiment. The pro- 
ject’s headquarters is in a big 
wooden building adjoining one of the 
schools at Cha-choeng-sao, which is 
now being extended to accommodate 
members of the mission. 
The Europeans and Thais live and 
work together; there are offices, a 
conference room, a dining-room and 
dormitories, but life at Cha-choeng- 
sao is by no means luxurious. 
Water has to be carried from the 
river in big earthenware jars, from 
which one pours water over oneself 
when taking a shower, which, during 
nine months of the year is pretty 
often. At night the staff sleeps 
under mosquito nets, and DDT 
sprays are used in the constant war . 
against the insects which swarm in 
after dark. 
In spite of these discomforts, the 
atmosphere is happy and comradely 
at Cha-choeng-sao. One could hard-~ 
ly help feeling happy in Thailand, 
for the Thais are a friendly people, 
generous almost to a fault. In fact, 
I was told by one of my colleagues 
to be very careful about accepting 
hospitality, because, he said, it is 
quite common for a Siamese official 
‘to spend almost his entire month’s 
salary on entertaining a stranger, 
and then have to borrow against his 
next pay-day! The U.N. advisers 
and their Thai counterparts dine 
together, and the discussions which 
take place over the dining-room 
table, or in the little riverside café, 
are both friendly and outspoken. 
“They work alongside us” the 
head of the mission, Mr. Kendrick 
Marshall, told me, “they watch our 
methods and discuss them with us. 
Sometimes they agree with us; some- 
times they have better ideas of 
their own. But it’s a joint effort ail 
along the line.” 
What are these new methods 
which the Unesco consultants are 
trying to put into practice, and how 
do they differ from the older me- 
thods used in Thai Schools? A Thali 
teacher to whom I put this question 
replied : “The old system had its 
good points but on the whole we 
have come to think of it as too 
stereotyped and academic. In the 
old days education was the responsi- 
bility of the Buddhist priests, and 
even today youll find that many of 
our schools are still in the grounds 
of old monasteries. Nowadays all

Thailand is anxious to accept the best of Western ideas and techniques. But the country is equally determined to maintain its deep-rooted cultural traditions such 
as the teaching of the graceful classical dances. 
the teaching is done by secular 
teachers, but often the methods are 
out-of-date. ‘The teacher just reads 
out facts from a book, and maybe 
draws a few diagrams on the black- 
board, and the children are expected 
to learn those facts by heart. There 
is nothing to stir the child’s imagi- 
nation, nothing to encourage him to 
use his hands, nothing to arouse his 
interest in what is being taught, 
whether it be history, geography, 
science or any other subject. 
I saw an example of the older 
methods, which are still in use 
throughout most of Thailand, when 
I visited a class for five to six-year- 
olds at a primary school, near Cha- 
choeng-sao. When I arrived the 
teacher was taking the class in 
geography. The children squatted 
on the bare wooden floor, resting 
their exercise books on low benches 
in front of them. There were no 
maps on the walls, no models, no- 
thing but a broken blackboard 
before which the teacher stood 
reading out facts about rivers and 
mountains and estuaries, while the 
bored children attempted to mem- 
orize them. If it had been a 
history class the method would have 
been exactly the same. 
Then, as a contrast, I visited an- 
other school in which the new 
methods are being introduced by 
Thai teachers, guided by Unesco 
consultants. An excited group of 
children was sitting at desks arrang- 
ed in a square around a big tray 
containing sand. There were maps 
and coloured diagrams on the walls, 
and on the table beside the sand- 
tray were twigs, leaves, and small 
stones. 
After asking questions about the 
source of a local river, to which the 
pupils were quick to respond, the 
teacher invited the children to come 
forward and make a model in sand 
showing the source of the river and 
its course from the mountains to the 
sea. The children set to work eager- 
ly, making first a model of a moun- 
tain, then tracing channels in the 
sand leading from the mountain to 
the coastal plain, and planting twigs 
and leaves as trees and rice-fields 
beside their model river. 
At another school I watched a 
most fascinating experiment in 
history teaching. The subject was 
an episode in the life of King 
Ramakamheng the Great, one of the 
Thai kings of the Sukhotai period 
(13th century). This King is one of 
the heroes of Thailand. He de- 
veloped his country’s administration, 
religion, and especially home and 
industrial pottery-making. 
After the teacher had described 
certain events in the life of the King, 
several small children came forward 
dressed in the costume of the period. 
One boy wearing a black jacket with 
a gold belt, a long white robe 
trimmed at the sleeves with gold, an 
enormous black and gold hat and 
pink trousers, who represented the 
King, seated himself on a school 
chair which served him as a throne. 
His Prime Minister, played by an- 
other small boy, and dressed with 
similar magnificence, came forward 
on his knees to receive the 
commands of the King. 
“We have given justice in our gov- 
ernment”, piped the little King, 
“and if there are any abuses people 
can address themselves to me. The 
provinces are inspected by our own 
chosen men, who are our eyes and 
our ears... Let us do this work with

all our hearts so that in the future it 
may provide a livelihood for our 
people.” 
Then two even smaller boys ap- 
peared, dressed in green jackets and 
black skull-caps. They represented 
Chinese craftsman whom King Ra- 
makamheng introduced into Thai- 
land to teach his people the art of 
ceramics. These boys then handed 
out modelling clay, and, to the ac- 
companiment of singing, the chil- 
dren set about making pots, vases 
and dishes under the guidance of 
the two “Chinese” potters. 
The whole idea, of course, was to 
turn what would probably have been 
a dull lesson in history into some- 
thing alive and interesting, some- 
thing in which the children could 
take an active part. 
Another river-journey brought me 
back to Cha-choeng-sao, just in 
time to watch a demonstration of 
science teaching by a Thai instruc- 
tor, Mr. Singto. Under the old sys- 
tem science teaching consisted sim- 
ply of reading

stration of any 
kind. The familiar science equip- 
ment of a western school—retorts, 
flasks, Bunsen burners, etc. were 
absent, and it was economically 
impossible to buy such equipment 
in any quantity. So Dr. Obpurn, the 
first Unesco adviser on science teach- 
ing, soon showed the Thais how to 
make simple science equipment out 
of local materials. For example, 
Mr. Singto showed me glass flasks 
made out of discarded electric light 
bulbs, a galvanoscope manufactured 
from a cheap pocket compass and a 
few bits of wire, and a model steam 
engine ingeniously constructed from 
an old DDT tin (the boiler) and a 
small brass pipe to lead the steam to 
a tiny wind-vane which revolved un- 
der the impact of the jet—a steam en- 
gine of the original Greek type invent- 
ed more than 2,000 years ago.

“This method of science teaching,” 
said Singto, “is quite new for Thai- 
land. All we had here before this was 
one funnel, one thermometer, and one 
conical flask.” 
Agricultural training plays an im- 
portant part under the United Nations 
scheme. Mr. Dickinson, the FAO ad- 
viser attached to the Cha-choeng-sao 
Project told me that Thailand won 
first place for rice-production at the 
Chicago World Fair for several years 
running. “And yet”, he added, “at the 
same time the yield of rice in Thailand 
could be considerably improved.” 
This puzzled me for a time since I 
knew that the Thais had thousands 
of years experience in rice-farming. 
How therefore, I asked Mr. Dickinson, 
did the UN advisers think that they 
could help these people to improve 
their yield? 
“By selection,” he answered, and 
took me to an experimental rice field

Cha-choeng-sao. Here I saw students, 
under Mr. Dickinson’s guidance, se- 
lecting the best ears of rice and putt- 
ing them aside for replanting during 
the following season. “When you take 
tens of thousands of these,” Mr. Dick- 
inson said, “and select the very best, 
then you proceed gradually to greater 
yields and uniformity.” 
In this same village of Bangkla I 
talked to Mr. Roger Wilson, an Eng- 
lishman attached to the Project from 
the International Labour Office as 
consultant on Vocational Training for 
the Cha-choeng-sao Centre. Before 
he joined the ILO, he was connected 
with a Technical Training College in

SHOWS THAI CHILDREN'S DELIGHT WITH THE NEW TEACHING METHODS INTRODUCED IN THE CHA-CHOENG-SAO EXPERIMENTAL AREA BY THE 
along the riverside, with its tall- 
chimneyed rice-mill, and the inevit- 
able Wat or Buddhist temple, whose 
glittering eaves reflected the hot 
sunshine. 
“The idea of the new primary 
extension school at Bangkla” he told 
me, “was that of Thomas Wilson, my 
namesake, the original leader of the 
Technical Assistance Mission. He 
thought of it as a way of extending 
the existing primary school system 
which only lasts for four years for 
children between the ages of seven 
and eleven. This kind of school is to 
provide a three-years post-primary 
course based cn practical work.” 
Wilson went on: “The idea is that 
these children will be working in the 
usual occupations in and around 
Bangkla, in rice mills and in the rice- 
fields, in sawmills and so on, 
The training will be a sort of pre- 
paration for life, although this does 
not mean that the children are going 
to be trained as artisans, solely. The 
idea is that they should have a general 
education as well as plenty of practical 
work and the whole of the curriculum 
will be based on the rural background 
that the children understand.” 
After a two-hour river journey 
I was back at Cha-choeng-sao. It 
was my last night at the Centre and 
a memorable one, not for any 
information I received—I had already 
taken in more than I could digest— 
but as an experience of Thai 
hospitality. The members of the

mission—Siamese, American, English, 
Canadian, Czech—gathered in the 
little riverside cafe. Healths were 
drunk in Mekhong, with the local 
ricewhisky, and afterwards, inevitably, 
the local orchestra, composed of Thai 
teachers from local schools, appeared. 
Far into the night they played the old 
songs of Siam, some of which had been 
considerably influenced by American 
“Swing”, each member taking a 
chorus on his instrument and im- 
provizing on the original theme with 
amazing skill and rhythmic zest. 
Early the following morning I was 
on my way back to Bangkok, travelling 
once again through the monotonous 
landscape of green paddy-fields laced 
by brown canals along which sampans 
glided. 
My last evening in Bangkok was 
spent at the Silpakorn Theatre, the 
Thai equivalent of a National Theatre. 
Here students of the Institute of 
Fine Arts present episodes from the 
country’s classical drama, based on 
the ancient Hindu epic “The Ra- 
mayana” which in Thailand is called 
“The Ramakien”. It was a masked 
play, called in Thailand the “Khon”. 
Almost all the actors wore masks, and 
mimed their parts, the voices being 
spoken or sung by a chorus off- 
stage. The costumes were mag- 
nificent, scarlets and greens and 
yellows spangled with gold; towering 
gold head-dresses, gold embroidery, 
golden ornaments, all scintillating in 
the brilliant stage lighting. The play, 
a

which was more of a ballet than a 
drama, took a leisurely course, 
watched by the attentive Siamese 
audience which knew every line of the 
verse, every note of the music, every 
movement of the dance. For more 
than three-and-a-half hours I was 
dazzled by the colour, bewitched by 
the grace of the dancers, fascinated 
by the music. The effect was such 
that when eventually I left the theatre 
and threaded my way through the 
clamorous traffic of Bangkok I felt 
confused and bewildered. 
When I said to a Thai friend that 
night, “as a Buddhist you have as 
your ideal the attainment of serenity 
of soul, inner peace”, he agreed. 
“Then,” I asked him, “how do you 
expect to attain serenity of soul by 
bringing in Western ideas, Western 
hustle, Western machinery, auto- 
mobiles, refrigerators and so on?” 
“The play which I saw tonight”, I 
continued, “was a superb work of art, 
the product of a culture as old, 
probably older than ours, something 
supremely civilized and worth-while 
Surely you don’t want to exchange 
that for canned music and Western 
films? It seems to me that you are 
on the wrong track. Sometimes I 
think that instead of the West 
bringing technical assistance to the 
East, the East should be bringing 
spiritual assistance to the West!” 
I said this to test his reactions, 
adding that the Thais whom I had 
met seemed a very happy people, 
GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND AND UNESCO. 
generous to strangers, contented, 
smiling, serene, even if some of them 
were relatively poor. His answer 
was interesting, and did much to 
strengthen my faith in what the 
United Nations are attempting to do 
in Thailand. 
“It is true” he replied, after some 
reflection, “that not all the things 
which the West has brought to 
Thailand are good things, although 
many Thais like them, But you should 
remember the good things too. Take 
health for example. Those people you 
saw in the country, and here in 
Bangkok, living on the canals, bathing 
in the same water from which they 
drink, they are happy, it is true. But 
only if they are well.” 
He paused and then added: “Have 
you thought of the thousands who die 
each year from malaria, typhoid and 
other preventable diseases ?” 
He went on to speak with high 
praise of the work of the WHO team 
operating in northern Thailand, and 
reminded me that a huge area had 
been cleared of that dreadful disease, 
yaws, by the use of penicillin in- 
jections. “As for your fears that the 
culture of Thailand may be destroyed 
by Western innovations”, he said, “I 
don’t think there is much fear of that. 
You will never turn the Thais into 
Westerners. Our religion and culture 
are too deeply rooted for that. No! I 
think that in the end we shall take 
the best which the West has to offer, 
and leave the rest to you.”

WONDERLAND 
by Andrea SALIERI 
excited voice echoing 
through the halls of a 
stately museum? If you 
haven't yet, you probably will one 
of these days. For more school- 
children are today visiting mu- 
seums than ever before. 
Grown-ups stilt seem to think 
of museums as awe-inspiring 
“shrines”, or cold, dull mauso- 
teums, with the result that many 
adult persons are still frightened 
to set foot inside one of them. 
Children, however, react to 
utuseums in a quite different 
manner. To them the museum is 
a land of wonder; their eyes 
wander all over the place, they 
pick what they like, they walk 
away, turn and come back. Some- 
times it is only to touch a statue 
that has caught their fancy; other 
times it is to draw an insect or a 
piece of jewelry and really get to 
know it. Even exhibits which 
most adults would judge to be dull, 
hold a fascination for young chil- 
dren, and have life and a meaning 
of their own. 
Everywhere, museum curators are 
gradually beginning to establish a 
working partnership with the 
school teacher. And although 
only a short time ago such an idea 
would have been a startling novelty 
in many countries, museum di- 
rectors now agree — many in fact 
are loudly proclaiming — that 
museums are meant for children 
as much as for adults. 
Today, in the United Kingdom, 
in the Netherlands, in Sweden and 
France, in Canada, Belgium, Switz- 
erland, Poland and the U.S.S.R,, 
museums are making a special 
effort to get groups of schoolchil- 
dren and young people to visii 
their exhibits. 
In the United States, such links 
are already quite firmly estab- 
lished, since schoolchildren there 
regularly visit over 200 museums 
of all types, quite apart from the 53 
museums created specially for 
children. The International 
Council of Museums and Unesco, 
incidentally, are encouraging and 
co-ordinating many new depart- 
ures in this field. Last year, for 
example, Unesco organized an in- 
ternational seminar at Brooklyn, 
New York, whose object was to 
speed the development in all coun- 
tries of this type of co-operation. 
H AVE you ever heard a child's 
From one discovery 
to another 
DMITTEDLY, some schools seem 
to have an advantage over 
others. Many a country 
school-teacher must feel envious as 
he reads reports of his colleagues 
in the big towns, who have at their 
very doors inexhaustible resources 
for supplementing their classroom 
teaching. © Who but a teacher 
working in a large city could, for 
instance, write this account of how 
his children improved their know- 
ledge and skill as young potters ? 
“The children in Grade 6 who 
had been doing pottery work since 
October had gone on from discov- 
ery to discovery until they began 
to feel dimly that they needed to 
see ‘what others had done in the 
same line. Up to that point, they 
had learnt to use clay for them- 
selves with no model before them. 
I therefore suggested that we might 
visit the Departments of Greek and 
Egyptian ceramics in a museum to 
study techniques... They split up 
into twos and threes or went off 
alone to stand before the show- 
cases and start work... On the aver- 
age, each child made about 
twenty-five really good drawings 
during the afternoon... The intel- 
ligent appreciation they expressed 
told me that they had grasped the 
point straight away; they could 
“feel” the clay of works more than 
a thousand years old taking shape 
in their hand”. 
Many a rural school child, too, 
must be envious of the city children 
who at a science museum can learn 
things which are always rather 
hard to follow in textbooks. One 
French girl of fourteen who studied 
gravitation in this way wrote, when 
she came back: “What a better 
and clearer picture of the earth and 
the heavens I got from my visit 
to the museum... it has made me 
want to learn more about mathe- 
matics and science and helped me 
see these subjects in a new light.” 
“Do you see that castle 
over there?” 
ND yet there is no reason to 
ponder regretfully over the 
inevitable inequality between 
town and counlry, between rich 
and poor, or large and small 
schools. Countless small schools 
would spurn such sympathy. A 
friend of mine who teaches in a 
primary school in a small country 
community certainly does not feel 
deprived of resources. “A mu- 
seum?” he says, “But I do have 
one! I've always had one. Don't 
pity me because I cannot take my 
pupils to a fine building full of 
valuable collections. Just look 
around you at this museum of 
mine”. And, with a sweep of his 
arm he indicates the surrounding 
countryside, 
The average person would at 
first see nothing but fields, a stream 
fringed with poplars, a few roads 
and two or three villages. “Behind 
that wood, over there”, he says, 
“we are digging clay, the 
same red clay that potters have 
been using for hundreds of years. 
I have shards of Gallo-Roman pot- 
tery at home that the children 
found one day, and since then they 
‘have been modelling the same clay 
themselves. For art galleries we 
have all the churches in the vici- 
nity, a number of Renaissance 
houses, not to mention an eight- 
eenth-century mansion to which 
my class pays a visit every year. 
On the historical side, we have 
plenty to study too, starting with 
that castle over there.” 
The castle consists of two square 
towers and the remains of walls 
overlooking the valley. From the 
main road you can see what looks 
like an almost intact keep, arches 
smothered in ivy and a sort of 
apse built on the rock. 
The conscientious sightseer leaves 
his car and sets off up the hill, 
through the vineyards, and up the 
steep streets of the little town. We 
can imagine the scene when he 
arrives in the square and, standing 
between the town-hall, the school 
“and the fountain, looks up at the 
medieval battlements and turns {o 
question the first passer-by. Need- 
less to say, he gets no useful infor- 
mation. No one knows anything 
except that “it’s old”, dating from 
the “time of the feudal lords”, and 
that the children sometimes go and 
play there with their teacher. 
But when some children appear 
on the scene, it is a very different 
stary. The visitor is immediately 
surrounded by a band of eager 
guides. “We know all about the 
castle. The big 
tower isn’t so 
very old—only 
the fourteenth 
century. But

there was a fort here long be- 
fore the castle was built and it may 
even date back to prehistoric times 
Therest of the castlewasbuilt inthe 
twelfth century, by a baron who 
defended the country against pi- 
rates. The land used to be part of 
the Holy Roman Empire. And you 
¢an see two beautifully carved 
columns that are still standing.” 
They talk on and on proving that 
their teacher has done a good job 
with his “countryside museum.” 
My friend also talks of nature- 
study rambles, explorations along 
the stream, visits to local craftsmen 
at work, or even of showing the 
children something of modern in- 
dustry a few miles away. “I have 
no small-scale engine to show my 
pupils, so I take them to the power 
station.” He says he uses in his 
teaching “everything there is round 
about, everything that is going on 
in the district”. 
  
Sharpened observation 
NCE a teacher decides to appeal 
to his pupils’ powers of 
observation rather than to 
their verbal memory, to their curi- 
osity rather than their obedience, 
to their powers of thought and 
judgment instead of to their 
readiness lo accept unquestioningly 
what they are told, he cannot 
be content to stay placidly in 
the class-room. He feels com- 
pelled to open the door and lead 
the children out into the world, 
where, after all; the things he 
teaches about mean something in 
their own right. It is then clear 
that it would be hard to keep teach- 
ers and their pupils out of mu- 
seums, whose real purpose is {o 
sharpen observation, to teach dis- 
crimination and to satisfy curiosity, 
without altogether exhausting it. 
A young friend of mine who 
visits the Metropolitan Museum in 
New York regularly told me that 
he was learning to open his eyes 
and look. What he meant was that 
he was becoming accustomed lo 
distinguishing and comparing. In 
the Egyptian or Chinese Rooms he 
has drawn up detailed lists, solved 
minor archaeological problems, 
made sketches and compiled tabu- 
lar summaries, “just for the fun 
of it”, as he said. He was in fact 
practising research. Ile was train- 
ing himself in the art of seeing 
things accurately, which is surely 
of help to a man or woman in 
thinking accurately. 
A little imagination 
HE teacher from the-village- 
with - the - castle certainly 
would have understood him. 
For to this teacher, taking children 
tc a museum simply means “putting 
them into touch with the true and 
the beautiful”. He admits, with a 
shrug, that, if he lived in a large 
town he would probably be consi- 
dered an extremist, for he would 
be tempted to hold all his classes 
in museums. 
But he also adds that, “with a 
little imagination” every school can 
be the centre of an enormous, 
living museum. In one place 
there is a castle, in another a 
mosque, in yet another a factory, 
but in every place there are always 
things that are true and beautiful, 
to see, to touch and to understand. 
He will quote you Paul Valéry's 
words inscribed above the Palais 
de Chaillot Museum in Paris: 
“Friend, come not within these 
walls where wonders are enshrined 
unless desire bids you come”. 
“Children”, he says, “are always 
bidden by desire, and the world is 
full of marvels; all we have to do 
is point to them.”

### 70237: Children help children of other lands

CHILDREN HELP CHILDREN 
OF OTHER LANDS 
reading about the progress of rescue and relief 
work in the flooded areas of the Netherlands, 
Unesco received a letter from the organizer of a 
public affairs lecture course in Cannes, on the French 
Riviera. To his query as to how his group might 
help to restore educational facilities for the children 
of Dutch flood victims, Unesco had a ready answer; 
“Unesco Gift Coupon Project No. 100”. 
When this spontaneous offer of help came from 
Cannes, the emergency gift project No. 100 entitled 
“Flooded Schools in the Netherlands”, had already 
been announced. The project was Unesco’s response 
to a letter from Mr. Bart Lunenberg, former head of 
the Unesco Centrum in Amsterdam, who wrote: 
“Though no-one can yet know the extent of the 
damage suffered by schools, it is certain that 
throughout the area school equipment will have to 
be replaced. Laboratory materials will have been 
ruined. All books, wall maps, film strips, projectors 
etc., will have been destroyed.” 
Gift Coupon Project No. 100 was soon under way 
with, as its first contribution, a cheque for 15,000 
French francs donated by the lecture audience at 
Cannes. Fifteen 1,000 franc Gift Coupons were sent 
to these students who have since posted them to the 
Netherlands, earmarked as help for the restoration 
of the flood-damaged schools. Meanwhile, Unesco 
has learned that people in many other countries are 
helping the stricken Netherlands schools by sending 
Gift Coupons. 
When a flood or an earthquake brings devastation 
to a country, people elsewhere are quick 
sympathize and to send assistance. The plight of 
children in such disasters is particularly poignant 
and in helping them, most well wishers generally do 
so in terms of food, blankets, shelters and medical 
supplies. However, after these first needs have been 
met, young people are still without schools, and the 
schools, even if standing, are without equipment. 
In more fortunate countries it is the children who 
have been quick to understand this problem when 
they have asked Unesco: “Is there anything WE can 
do?” They have been told: “Send Gift Coupons to 
replace schoolbooks and other equipment.” 
Though less dramatic because they are relatively 
widespread and of long standing, the educational 
needs of children throughout most of Africa, Asia 
and Latin America, are just as acute as those of the 
youthful flood victims in the Netherlands. But 
where grown-ups are sometimes inclined to take for 
granted the serious handicaps to education in these 
vast areas, their children, on the contrary, have 
shown a keen and sympathetic awareness of the 
problems whether they concern the needs of a deaf 
child in Ceylon, or a juvenile delinquent in Manila 
or a village schoolboy in West Africa. 
E “a last February, while the world was still 
“ Boys’ Town” in Manila 
the handicaps suffered by young people in 
many underprivileged countries, through the 
Gift Project Catalogue of Unesco’s Gift Coupon Pro- 
gramme. In the two years since this programme 
began, youngsters in the United States, France and 
the United Kingdom, have befriended less fortunate 
children in over a score of countries throughout the 
world by sending them Gift Coupons with which to 
buy school equipment and supplies. This year, they 
are being joined by young people in Canada, Ger- 
many, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Cuba and 
Japan —all of which have recently decided to join 
the Gift Coupon Programme as donor countries. 
Gift Coupons have been used to help give 
educational opportunities to delinquent children, 
and those handicapped by physical disability, by 
economic privation and by the effects of war. And 
many of them have been sent by children to help 
children, For example, there is the story of Boys’ 
Town, Manila. 
On the outskirts of Manila is a pleasant little 
surburban community with its own shopping centre, 
school, park, playground, chapel, library and town 
hall. The population numbers about 250 youngsters 
from 7 to 17 years of age. This is “Boys’ Town”, a 
model centre for rehabilitating juvenile delinquents. 
When the teen-age girls of the Ecole Technique 
St. Honoré in Paris heard about Boys’ Town, Manila, 
(Unesco Gift Project No, 32) they began selling 1,000 
twenty-franc Unesco souvenir stamps. The money 
they raised bought twenty 1,000-franc Gift Coupons 
which provided blackboards and textbooks for Boys’ 
Town. Meanwhile, boys and girls of San Diego High 
School, California, U.S.A., were selling 480 twenty- 
five cent souvenir stamps to raise money for twelve 
210 Gift Coupons so that the Manila boys could equip 
their manual training shop with carpentry tools. 
Other French and American groups are also 
helping this project. Gift Coupons, however, have 
done more than simply provide for some of the needs 
of Boys’ Town. They have also resulted in the 
growth of international friendships between its 
young citizens and boys and girls many miles away. 
To assist physically handicapped children all over 
the world is one of the problems being tackled by the 
World Health Organization and the United Nations 
International Children’s Emergency Fund. But while 
T ODAY, more and more people are learning of 
medical care is of vital importance to blind, deaf and 
crippled children, educational needs must also be 
satisfied. Unesco has found that healthy children 
are quick to realize that in the life of a paralyzed 
child, books, films and toys and handicraft materials 
are needed along with medical equipment; that 
blind youngsters need Braille reading and writing 
materials, relief maps and musical instruments, as 
well as shelter and guidance. 
For this reason a school for blind and deaf children 
in Ceylon has been a favourite Gift Project among 
schoolchildren. Among their unseen friends around 
the world, the Ceylon youngsters include pupils of 
the Camden Street School, Glasgow, Scotland; the 
little girls of a Brownie Scout troop in Pittsburgh, 
U.S.A, and the youthful members of an apprentice 
training centre in Metz, France. Moreover, sub- 
stantial help through Gift Coupons has come to the 
Ceylon School from C.O.R.S.O. (Council of Orga- 
nizations for Relief Service Overseas, Inc.), New 
Zealand's leading overseas relief organization. 
Most Popular of all 
ENTALLY handicapped boys and girls in the 
M school for feeble-minded children at Jabuka, 
Yugoslavia, have been befriended by children 
in scores of schools, including high school pupils of 
Kidderminster, England and those at the Lycée des 
Jeunes Filles, in Moulins, France, whose Gift Coupons 
were used to buy coloured slides for the Jabuka 
children. 
Probably the single most popular of all Unesco 
Gift Projects was the “Ecole de Richard Toll” in 
Senegal, French West Africa. Schoolchildren all 
over France eagerly adopted this project, and 
completely fulfilled it within a few months. This 
means that books, periodicals, notebooks, slates, 
crayons, water colours, maps, duplicating machines 
and a film projector bought with Gift Coupons paid 
for out of the pockets of French schoolchildren, are 
now on their way to this remote African village 
school. 
Another special case is that of the 200,000 school- 
age children in the Arab refugee camps of the Middle 
East. These youngsters are literally wards of the 
United Nations, and schooling for some 65,000 of 
them is provided by Unesco and the United Nations 
Relief and Works Administration. 
Perhaps it is this or perhaps it is because, unlike 
most children mentioned in Unesco Gift Projects, 
these are homeless children, that explains why Gift 
Coupon Projects relating to Middle East schools have 
met with such a universal response. In 1951, the 
first year of the Gift Coupon Plan, they received 
nearly a thousand dollars worth of Gift Coupons— 
intended for maps, globes, books and other classrooin 
needs. In 1952, contributions from the United States, 
the United Kingdom and from donor groups in 
France, increased this help many times over. 
Among the latest of Unesco’s Gift Coupon Projects 
are those designed to bring aid to the young people 
of Israel. Since 1948, when the United Nations 
recognized Israel as a sovereign State, a tidal wave 
of immigration has doubled the country’s population. 
To shelter these newcomers until housing construc- 
tion could catch up with immigration, temporary 
camps were hastily erected. There are 100 or more 
of these “Ma’abarot” (Immigrant transit camps) in 
Israel today, home for fully a quarter of a million 
people. 
Immigrants find that there is work for all in Israel 
—though many must learn new skills. While their 
elders work, children attend school in the camps. 
But after school or work, there is simply nothing for 
young people to do; nowhere for them to go. “Home” 
is a dark or stuffy tent or hut. 
"Eventful Ma’abarots 
ODAY, something is happening. Already in half 
T of Israel’s hundred Ma’abarot, young people 
are organizing community centres, starting 
social activity programmes to replace the monotony 
of after-school and after-work with group recreation. 
Already in fifty communities group leaders are being 
chosen to start youth centre activities. 
But from the start these young people are faced 
with a crippling handicap—the complete lack of 
equipment in the Ma’abarot. They cannot learn 
handicrafts without tools and materials; they cannot 
read without books; they cannot make music without 
instruments, 
So to help them along the road, to a new life in a 
new land, Unesco has developed a series of gift 
projects for selected Ma’abarot youth centres. One 
of these is in the camp at Gilath, not far from 
Beersheba, where several times a week some 500 
youngsters will come from the scattered camps and 
settlements in the Negev desert. 
The children themselves will help to construct 
their centre, levelling playgrounds and sports fields, 
erecting huts, planting their own gardens and farm 
plots, building their own handicraft and carpentry 
workshops. The skills they will thus learn are 
essential to their future careers as pioneers in 
the long-range development of this arid, but 
potentially fruitful corner of the earth.

More than 700,000 people, or about half the Jewish population of Israel, are new settlers who have arrived in the past four years. After disembarking, this patriarch

great historic event is taking 
place in Israel today. This 
is no less than the making of 
a new nation out of human 
A 
and cultural material the an- 
tecedents of which go back 
thousands of years, and the 
developmeni of this new na- 
tion into a modern democratic 
community. Last December, as 
scientific adviser on behalf of 
Unesco, I had the good fortune to 
be able to visit this land, and see 
with my own eyes the changes that 
are taking place there. 
There is one thing in Israel that 
immediately strikes the observer 
and especially the social scientist. 
It is the remarkable process of a 
people's renascence and transfor- 
mation. This differs in several 
respects from what “normally” has 
happened in history. In Israel, it 
is confined to a very tiny area and 
is to an unusual degree a controlled 
and planned operation moving 
with extraordinary speeed. This 
means that events in Israel are 
taking place under experimental 
laboratory conditions. And it 
means, too, that the social scientist 
can study here a variety of im- 
portant problems, so to speak “in 
a test-tube”. 
This fact alone is enough to 
attract the social scientist to Israel 
today. In my own case, I will 
admit that there is another, less 
academic motive as well. It is a 
belief in the idea that man’s pro- 
gress in a world of hate will be 
helped not so much by peace 
propaganda as by a determined 
effort to understand what actually 
goes on between different human 
beings, different social and racial 
groups, between different national- 
ities — in other words, to un- 
derstand why people hate each 
other and then to discover and 
apply the remedies. This approach 
may be slow and strenuous, but it 
is functional. It is Unesco's 
approach today, and I believe it is 
apa-Magnum). 
one which fits our time and the’ 
future. 
More than 700,000 people, or 
about half of the total Jewish 
population of the country, are new 
Israelis, having arrived within the 
last four years. The job of housing 
them and getting them settled 
presents staggering problems that 
have to be solved by the State and 
local authorities. The sharp drop 
in immigration during 1952 (down 
to only about 10 per cent of the 
average for 1948-1951) gave the 
country a breathing spell during 
which it was possible to get all but 
a few thousand permanently hous- 
ed and settled. About 20 per cent

of the people are today rural 
settlers, and they are, for many 
reasons, the heart of the new 
nation. The farmlands provide 
desperately needed food, and also 
provide the kind of community 
life for the settlers which is the best 
school for nationhood. 
The rural settlements, and espe- 
cially the kibbutsim are the natural 
melting pots of Israel. It is there- 
fore a matter of urgent national 
policy to attract more people to 
them, and to train the youth for 
rural life and work. In this re- 
gard, too, the experiments that are 
being carried out in 
the Israel laboratory 
offer exciting perspec- 
tives. 
The trend of urbani- 
zation is universal and 
one of the striking 
features of all modern 
societies. How can it 
be reversed, especially 
in a population made 
up of newcomers 
whose background for 
centuries has been 
mostly urban? Israel 
has come up with 
part of the answer, 
in its rural commu- 
nities, but there still 
is a long way to go. 
Looking at Israel, I 
found that this coun- 
try offers almost un- 
equalled opportunities 
for the study of the 
kinds of problems 
we need to under- 
stand in order to live 
better with each other: 
problems of human 
relations, of cultural 
and social adjustment, 
of community integra- 
tion, of co-operation in 
a society where most 
people are strangers 
to each other. These 
problems are of vital 
importance to Israel 
right now and will be 
for a long time to 
come. They are equal- 
ly important to many 
other countries indi- 
vidually, and to our 
world at large. 
It was in recogni- 
tion of this fact thal 
Unesco decided to stu- 
dy Israel and in parti- 
cular the methods 
that are used there to 
reduce tensions and 
conflicts that inevitab- 
ly arise within a new 
population composed 
of so many different 
elements. Nations do 
learn from each other 
What can 
we learn from Israel? 
This study is now 
underway. It is being 
conducted with grants 
from Unesco and 
other sources by a 
group of leading Is- 
raeli social scientists 
from the Hebrew Uni- 
versity and the Israel 
Institute of Applied 
Social Research, both 
in Jerusalem. I doubt 
whether any country 
outside the United Sta- 
tes could have made 
available a group 
better qualified for this study. 
Apart from the high professional 
standards of these men there is the 
fact that social research in Israel 
has for years been particularly 
alert to these problems, and has 
devoted much work to them. 
The great transformation taking 
place in Israel involves, among 
other things, a rapid change in the 
working tools and the methods of 
production and management. With 
one bold move the clock was set 
forward from the age of a pre- 
dominantly underdeveloped eco- 
nomy and technology to that of our 
mid-twentieth century. 
Technological revolutions on 
this scale raise serious problems 
wherever they occur. In Israel the 
problems are aggravated by the 
fact that the population is so hetero- 
geneous and to a large extent 
composed of new arrivals from 
countries which must be classified 
as “underdeveloped” from the 
technological point of view, how- 
ever advanced they may be in 
other ways. This means that 
in addition to the learning and 
adjustment process which any 
people has to go through in 
entering the machine age, a 
number of special problems are 
posed for the people of Israel. 
How does a person fresh from an 
Oriental village or a North African 
ghetto acquire the working and 
and living habits of an industrial 
civilization? How does he become 
the operator of complicated ma- 
chines and exacting techniques 
about whose existence he previous- 
ly had no idea? And how does he 
avoid losing his human dignity and 
becoming an unhappy slave of the 
machine rather than its master? 
How, finally, can workers from 
so many different social and cultur- 
al backgrounds learn to work 
together and develop in the indus- 
trial milieu the kind of community 
which will make all of them one 
people? These and similar prob- 
lems are the subject of a pilot 
study now being conducted for 
Unesco by Professor A. Bonne of 
the Hebrew University who 
explains the project in the follow- 
ing terms : 
“The immigration into the State 
of Israel during the last four and 
a half years included a very 
considerable proportion of Oriental 
Jews who came from countries 
which are either completely agrar- 
ian or on the verge of industriali- 
zation. They experience in Israel 
their first contact with mechanized 
forms of production, industrial de- 
vices and modern labour relations. 
The problem of adjustment of la- 
bourers coming from a purely 
rural environment has been fre- 
quently dealt with as a vital issue 
in the schemes for the development 
of backward regions. So far no 
systematic investigation was made 
with regard to the experience in 
Israel with such workers who have 
found employment in workshops 
and industrial plants. The Unesco 
enquiry is intended to fill this gap.” 
One of the fascinating aspects of 
this study will be concerned with 
the adaptation to the industrial 
process of ancient handicraft skills 
that many Oriental Jews have

brought with them from countries 
such as Yemen. Another problem, 
which is beyond the scope of the 
Unesco study but a topic of much 
discussion, centres around the pres- 
ervation of the ancient skills in 
weaving, silverwork, etc. as an 
enduring cultural tradition within 
the new industrial society. There 
are many encouraging signs that 
the old arts and crafts will not be 
lost in Israel. 
One of the most frequent re- 
marks, heard in Israel today is : 
What kind of a nation are we 
ultimately going to be when the 
present large-scale process of im- 
migration and settling has come to 
an end? Or, how will the many 
different people who have been 
scattered for so long in so many 
foreign lands and who have devel- 
oped such widely differing cus- 
toms be able to blend into one 
people? The answer, of course, 1s 
hidden in the future, and only a 
future generation will know. This 
is an accepted fact by the adult 
generation of today. Theirs are 
the problems of getting settled and 
of adjusting themselves to the best 
of their ability: 
It often means . 
resigning them- (Continued

difficult and complicated condi- 
tions. Theirs is not yet the Pro- 
mised Land. But it will be if they 
and especially the youth and the 
children make it so. 
As a social scientist with a 
“Unesco bias” I was struck again 
and again by the wonderful spirit 
and the practical skill I witnessed 
in the youth settlements, in the 
children’s villages and in the 
youth training centres all over the 
country. 
In this field, too, Unesco takes 
a good deal of interest and is 
sponsoring anether study which 
is directed by Dr. S. N. Eisenstedt 
of the Hebrew University, on 
immigrant youth. It is a vast 
field which may yield important 
results on the ways in which 
young people are integrated into 
a community, the conflicts which 
have to be overcome in the pro- 
cess, and the acute tensions which

in such societies arise between the 
older and younger generations. 
Eighty percent of the popula- 
tion today lives in towns and 
other urban conglomeralions. 
What happens here? These 
thousands of people are living 
close to each other physically. 
But, largely strangers to each 
other and lacking the close per- 
sonal ties and the common tasks 
that exist in the kibbuiz commu- 
nity, how are they living in terms 
of human relations, of community 
integration and co-operation ? 
These are problems of tremen- 
dous importance, I believe, not 
only for the future of Israel, bul 
for national communities gener- 
ally in which heterogenéous 
urban populations must learn tn 
live together peacefully and 
successfully. These problems are 
today being studied by sociolo- 
gists in many countries. Israet

can profit a great deal from 
these studies but here, too, Isreal 
itself offers almost ideal labora- 
tory conditions for study. Recently 
Unesco undertook a small “test 
tube” study of these important 
social problems in co-operation 
with a pioneering enterprise just 
being launched. 
The new enterprise is the 
Community Health Centre at Beth 
Mazmil near Jerusalem, organiz- 
ed under the auspices of the Ha- 
dassah Medical Organization. 
The Centre is established in a 
brand new suburban settlement 
of about 500 families. Beth Maz- 
mil is, in fact, a miniature mod- 
el of urban Israel and a cross- 
section of the nation as a whole. 
The Centre started its activities iu 
the community by a comprehen- 
sive survey of the entire popula- 
tion, family by family, and ind 
vidual by individual. The survey,

which is now nearing its comple- 
tion, includes a sociological sludy 
of the tensions between differ- 
ent nationality groups, {en- 
sions between new immigrants 
and old-timers, and political 
tensions. It is hoped that a 
continuing observation of the 
Community Centre by social 
scientists will show how far this 
new type of organization is 
successful in reducing conflicts 
within the settlement. 
The Unesco projects in Israel 
should be completed by the end 
of the year. Of course this is 
only a beginning and little more 
can be done than scratching the 
surface of the problems. It is 
hoped, however, that others will 
carry on the work and particu- 
larly that the social scientists ol 
Israel will be encouraged to 
continue the exploration of these 
great human problems. IM
