DUTIES OF 
THE STATE 
ERTAIN “general” questions are, in 
their seeming innocence, fraught with 
a kind of danger. These, indeed, are 
the most interesting questions—those 
which, if we but probe their implications, 
force us to re-examine the intellectual struc- 
tures on which our communal life is based. 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization has inscribed just 
such a question on the agenda of its Gen- 
eral Conference, which is meeting for its 
fourth session in Paris on Sept. 19. 
Delegates from Unesco’s 48 Member States, 
including internationally known educa- 
tionists, scientists and men of letters, will 
devote three days to a public debate on the 
theme: “What are the duties of the State 
in regard to education, science and culture 
for the purpose of ensuring a better under- 
standing between peoples, and what poli- 
tical steps should be taken in order to 
discharge those duties?” 
* 
T should be noted at once that the very 
| principle of this discussion marks «a de- 
parture from the current procedures of in- 
ternational organization. Unesco. like other 
specialized agencies of the United Nations. 
has hitherto convened its General Confe- 
rence for an essentially practical purpose. 
This purpose remains. Delegates at the 
fourth Session will hear the first annual 
report of the Organization's new Director- 
General, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet. They will 
approve a programme of action for the 
coming year and adopt a budget designed 
"to implement this programme. They will 
also define and provide for Unesco’s part 
in the momentous Technical Assistance Plan. 
which the Economic and Social Council is 
expected to lay before the United Nations’ 
General Assembly later this year. 
The General Conference of ‘Unesco is 
constitutionally enjoined to meet in a differ- 
ent country each year, mainly in order 
that the nature and aims of the Organi- 
zation may become as widely known as 
possible. The statesmen who framed Unes- 
co's Charter were fully aware that the work 
of preparing and holding annual interna- 
tional conferences in widely separated 
cultural areas would place a heavy burden 
on the Organization's Secretariat. By insist- 
ing on this provision, however, they demon- 
strated their belief that no consideration 
should be allowed to override one vital pur- 
pose: to reach the peoples of the world. 
Has Unesco succeeded in this task? Dele- 
gates at the third Session, held in Beirut in 
1948, were frankly not satisfied that it had 
done so. . It was for this reason that the 
General Conference decided to give iis next 
Session an ideological “theme”. The Execut- 
ive Board was instructed to select for dis- 
cussion a problem of general interest. Such 
a theme, it was hoped, would provide a 
prism through which the various activities 
of the Organization, and the deliberations 
of the Conference itself, could be seen cons- 
tantly in the light of the noble purposes for 
which Unesco was conceived. 
Y opening a full-scale debate on the 
B duties of States in the matter of interna- 
tional cultural cooperation, the General 
Conference will be turning a search- 
light on Unesco’s theoretical basis for 
existence, as well as the machinery by which 
it carries out its functions. At the same time, 
it will raise some far from innocuous issues 
concerning the duties of its Member States. 
Since the French Revolution, most modern 
democratic States have proclaimed two fun- 
damental ideas which historically—if not 
logically—have come to contradict each other. 
On one hand, the Nation was seen as 
supreme, a secular absolute. On the other, 
the State affirmed the sacred character of 
human rights. The very existence of such 
international organizations as Unesco affirms 
today that man is more than his history. 
The State is not absolute, since it has duties 
to perform: and these duties refer specifi- 
cally t» a human ideal which transcends 
the boundaries of the State.

### 74056: Food from the sea

FOOD FROM THE SEA 
T has been said that wherever a 
shoal of herrings touches the Nor- 
wegian coast a village springs up. 
This statement is true of many other 
lands bordering on the sea. Just as 
peasant communities grow up and 
prosper where the soil is rich, men 
have always settled in places from 
which fish can be easily caught. 
That this has been so from the 
earliest days of mankind is shown by 
bone remains and drawing of fish in 
palaeolithic caves. But it has often 
happened that fishing villages have 
decayed and become deserted. The 
fish have disappeared and the fish- 
ermen have been obliged to follow 
suit. 
The fluctuation of fish stocks was 
long a mystery. Some attributed 
the phenomen to sunspots or phases 
of the moon. Only in the last 
50 years has scientifc method been 
applied to the problem. It has been 
found that the migration of fish 
depends on roughly the same causes 
as the migration of men—that is, on 
the supply of food, the temperature 
and the availability of shelter. A bad 
year for the microscopic form of plant 
life called plankton may severely 
reduce the stock of fish, just as a 
drought decimates live-stock; a heavy 
swell can have the same effect on the 
sea vegetation as a spring hailstorm on 
ally decides whai should be cultivated 
each year on different kinds of soil 
so as to yield the best output, the 
fishery experts now strive for the 
“optimum catch’’——one big enough to 
leave just the right number of fish 
in the area, thus garanteeing the 
maintenance and steady increase of 
the stock. 
Ninety-eight percent of the world’s 
annual catch of fish is hauled up from 
waters north of the Equator. It 1s 
likely that the North Sea and North 
Atlantiz are exploited to the limit. 
But, 35 Dr. Kask, chief fisheries bio- 
logist of the United Nations Food 
and Agriculture Organization, told 
the recently held Pan-Pacific Science 
Congress in Auckland, New Zealand, 
the Worlds greatest ocean, the 
Pacific, is virtually untapped. One 
rookery of seals in the Bering Sea 
consumes four times as much fish a 
year as man catches during the same 
period in the whole of the Pacific. 
ENORMOUS RESOURCES 
IT is difficult to assess the food 
potentiality of the ocean depths, 
but experts seem to agree that the 
resources are enormous. An indi- 
cation of the undiscovered possi- 
bilities was provided when the 
riddle of the so-called false ocean 
by Lars LIND 
the crops. A change in the water's 
temperature forces the fish to migrate, 
either horizontally or vertically. 
But there are also man-made 
fluctuations. Overfishing in one area 
may lead to a long period of poor. 
hauls. Happily, however, man has 
also succeeded in increasing the supply 
of fish by large-scale transplantations 
from one area to another, by ’'manur- 
ing”’ the seas and by artificial fertiliz- 
ation. 
Like agriculture, fishing has now 
become a science. The fisherman's 
equipment has developed from crude 
hooks and spears to the highly special- 
ised gear used at the present time. 
There 1s, for example, the “atom- 
. trawl’’, which 1s able to fish at all 
depths, and the echo-sounder, used to 
locate shoals of herring and cod. 
Asdic, the war-time invention used to 
spot submarines, probably will soon 
be used for the same purpose. 
Just as the agriculturist scientific- 
bottom was solved. Marine scientists 
were long puzzled by the finding of 
occasional bottoms where the water 
should have bee much deeper. An 
enterprising Norwegian sent down a 
movie camera and the exposures 
revealed that the bottoms really were 
schools of cod-fish. 
In spite of news techniques and 
increased knowledge of the animal 
kingdom of the seas, many areas still 
remain almost untouched. Modern 
fishery methods are applied only in a 
limited number of countries. The 
main cause for this poor utilization of 
the ocean riches in face of the crying 
“need for increased food supplies lies 
in faulty human organization. It is 
here that international co-operation 
comes in. Since 1902 the Interna- 
tional Council for the Exploration of 
the Sea, with headquarters in Copen- 
hagen, has carried out a good deal of 
scientific fishery research. It has also 
promoted a number of conventions, 
education, science and culture.

such as those establishing size-limits 
for various kinds of fish and provid- 
ing for the introduction of closed 
seasons. 
The Food and Agriculture Orga- 
nization of the United Nations also 
takes an active interest In fishery 
preblems, acting as adviser in areas 
where primitive methods and gear are 
still being used. The organization 
supplies the secretariat for the recently 
established Inde-Pacific Fisheries 
Council, which will seek to alleviate 
Asia's acute food shortage. The over- 
all aim of these international bodies is 
to bring about a rational exploitation of 
the vast water-fallows of the world, 
three fifths of the covering about 
globe. 
Realization that the seven seas 
constitute larders crammed with food 
has led the nations of the world, 
which not long ago fought each other 
over fishing nights, to work together 
to develop this important food supply 
for the common good. 


### 74058: Most of the world: an American survey

“MOST OF THE WORLD ™,*- 
An American Survey 
“A group of trained anthropologists has studied the 
countries of Latin America, the Far East, and Africa 
in terms of population and natural and political history.” 
up the history cf the past fif- 
ty years; the rise to world in- 
fluence cf the United States; the 
development of Russian power under 
Soviet Communism; the decline of 
world influerce of the mnatione-states 
of Western Europe ; the mcvément to- 
wards political self-determination and 
independence cf pecples in Asia, Afri- 
ca, and Latin America, who in the nine- 
teenth and early twentieth centuries li- 
ved under systems of colonial rule 
The purpese of this book, Most cf the 
Werld, is to paint a picture cf this last 
group cf ccuntries, which are assuming 
increasing control cver their own pat- 
terns of power and collaboration after 
Wecrld War II. 
A group cf trained anthropologists has 
studied the countries of Latin America. 
the Far East, and Africa in terms of 
pcpulaticn and natural political history. 
and has made a detailed sociological 
map. What is refreshing in these experts 
presentation is the brcad sweep of 
their interest, their conzern not only 
for the geography and natural resources. 
but also for the human and cultural 
elements which more than any other 
factors will determine the future shape 
and history of these areas. 
What are some of the broad ccnclu- 
sicns drawn frcm that detailed and 
masterly picture thus presented ? 
On the resources side, the picture is 
of a combination of great potentialities 
and massive underdevelopment. No- 
where in the countries described are 
there the basic foundations for the in- 
tense industrial development wich 
would be comparable to that seen in 
the Ruhr. the English Midlands, the 
Eastern US.A.. or the Donetz basin of 
the USER. But important industrial 
growth can be fcreshadowed in N. 
Eastern India. Manchuria. Japan, and 
possibly Brazil. In all these areas, whe- 
ther in industrialization or the mere 
explcitation of resources. progress will 
depend on new types of organization 
F OUR major facts perhaps can sum 
x 
and skill, many of which will require 
the sccial reorganizaticn of old cultural 
habits to bring them to full fruition. 
Population Pressure 
F' national cself-determination is the 
I prime pclitical factor and driving 
ferce behind this development, the 
prime sccial factor is population pres 
sure. Without cffering any pat sclutico 
to the prcblem. one expert writes, « The 
entire set of life conditions which con- 
tribute to high mcrtality and high fer- 
tility must alter... Fcr most of the 
world this means that ways must be 
fcund tc increase agricultural preduc- 
tion, to introduce and develop indus- 
tries, t¢ promote trade, to broaden hori- 
zcns, through wider education and the 
precmotion of literacy, tc improve health 
facilities and individual welfare servi- 
ces, to insure political stability and 
leadership. In short, through balanced 
mcdernization cf all the world’s back- 
ward areas a soluticn to problems of 
overpcrulaticn may be reached. » 
The term « balanced modernization » 
is a useful cne fer those whose thoughts 
have been turned cf late to the pro- 
grammes of Technical Assistance for 
the less-develcred areas cf the world 
now under discussicn in the E:cnomic 
and Sccial Council of the United Na- 
ticns, and in the United States Congress 
in implementing Point Four of Presi- 
dent Truman's Inaugural address. 
As this bcck underscores, the task 
of mcdernization of these countries can 
nc lcnger bz conceived in the old pat- 
terns of ccntrol, and will require new 
methcds of collaboraticn between the 
more and less advanced countries of the 
werld. This is perhaps the challenge 
and the premise cf the present Techni- 
cal Assistance programme now under 
discussion,

### 74059: U.N. Technical aid plan approved by ECOSOC

U. N=TECHNIC INILIVNY 
BY ECOSOC 
  
~~ APPROVED 
HE United Nations plan for 
: an expanded programme of 
echnical aid to economically 
under-developed countries 
through a pooling of the world’s tech- 
nical skills was brought a step nearer 
completion on August 15 when it 
was approved by the Economic and 
Social Council (ECOSOC) meeting in 
Geneva. 
This scheme for extending techni- 
cal assistance, which is the United 
Nations response to President Tru- 
man’s call for a «bold new pro- 
gramme» to help the peoples of the 
under-developed countries, was first 
outlined in a combined UN-Specia- 
lized Agencies report issued at Lake 
Success on June 2. 
(A summary, of this report des- 
cribing the provisional plan under 
which it was proposed to use more 
than $85,000,000 in two years for 
technical assistance, appeared in the 
June issue of the Courier (Volume 
If, N° 5.) 
The plan described in the com- 
bined report was designed to pro- 
vide technical assistance on a scale 
never before attempted so as to am- 
plify and augment existing projects 
and to meet accumulated requests 
from governments which it has not 
to date been possible to satisfy. 
ECOSOC considered this  re- 
port during the latter part of its 
forty-one day session and on Au- 
gust 15 approved, by 15 votes to 0 
with three abstensions, a co-ordina- 
ted programme of technical assistan- 
ce together with recommendations 
for its organizational machinery, fi- 
nancial arrangements and principles 
to be applied in its execution. 
The programme is now therefore 
ready for final approval at the 359 
nations United Nations General As- 
sembly which opens at Lake Success 
on September 20. : . 
Aid Conference Proposed 
O NE of the ECOSOC recom- 
mendations which the UN As- 
sembly must consider is for a general 
conference on technical aid to be held 
at UN headquarters during or im- 
mediately following the Assembly 
Session. All UN members and non 
UN members who have joined the 
specialized agencies would be invited 
to the conference with the right to 
vote. 
This proposed conference would be 
called upon to (a) determine the to- 
tal amount of voluntary contributions 
which might be expected during the 
first year of the programme and (b) 
approve the proportionate sharing of 
contributions among the participating 
agencies. 
To co-ordinate the activities of the 
specialized agencies — the World 
Health Organization, the Internatio- 
nal Labour Organization, Unesco, ths 
Feod and Agricultural Organization 
and the International Civil Aviation 
Organization — ECOSOC  recom- 
. 
mended the formation of a technical 
assistance board. — an administrative 
body — comprising the executive 
heads of these agencies. It also re- 
commended the setting up of a com- 
mittee to discuss policy matters, on 
which all ECOSOC members 
would be represented, thus consti- 
tuting a governmental body. 
ties of the specialized agencies, it was 
decided, should be on a voluntary 
basis, and the need to make the 
most effective use of both converti- 
ble and non-convertible currencies led 
ECOSOC to the decision that 
contributions should go into a cen- 
tral receiving pool known as the 
«special account for technical assis- 
tance for economic developments. 
Under the plan approved by 
ECOSOC. the first ten million dollars 
» 
  
    00 ony p Aven 
contributed would automatically be 
distributed to the participating or- 
ganizations according to a percentage 
scale. 
Seventy per cent of the next ten 
million dollars would be similarly 
distributed, the remaining thirty per 
cent being placed in a reserve fund. 
All receipts over twenty million dol- 
lars would also be held ig reserve 
to be allocated by the technical as- 
sistance board. This scale of alloca- 
tions will be one of the matters for 
review by the UN General Assembly 
and ths special conference. 
Priority for Food 
D ECIDING that technical aid to 
increase food production and to 
reduce malnutriticn should be gran- 
ted the greatest share of the initial 
contributions, ECOSOC recom- 
mended that the Food and Agricul- 
tural Organization should receive 
twenty-nine per cent. 
Its other recommended percentage 
allocations were: The United Na- 
tions, twenty-three per cent, chiefly 
for use in industrial development; 
World Health Organization twenty- 
two per cent; Unssco, fourteen per 
cent; International Labour Organi- 
zation, eleven per cent, and Inter 
national Civil Aviation Organization, 
one per cent. 
As for the principles which should 
determine the spending of the funds 
contributed for the increased tech- 
nical aid, ECOSOC considered 
that assistance should only be given 
to countries requesting it and that 
it should not be the means for any 
foreign economic or political inter- 
ference. Countries receiving assistance 
should normally assume responsibi- 
lity for a substantial part of the costs 
of technical services with which they 
are provided and do their utmost in 
«self-help». 
The Council also recommended 
that universities, technical schools, 
foundations and research institutes be 
encouraged to release specialists to 
help in the programme. The partici- 
pating UN agencies, it considered. 
should aim at increasing 
productivity of materials and 
resotirces. The aim should also be to 
achieve a wider sharing of the bene- 
fits of higher living standards. 
Although much administrative and 
planning work will remain to be done 
after the UN Assembly has dealt 
with the technical aid programme. 
the action of ECOSOC has al- 
ready taken the project a measura- 
ble step on the road to its realization. 
This was stressed at the Council's 
closing session on August 15 by the 
President, Mr. James Thorn (New 
Zzaland) who said: «A new note has 
been struck. The under-developed 
areas are now to be regarded as 
within the sphere of influence of the 
United Nations. » Financing of the increased activi- 


### 74060: Economic Council reviews UNESCO aid proposals

ECONOMIC COUNCIL REVIEWS UNESCO AID PROPOSALS 
T HE: plan drawn up by 
Unesco defining the 
work it would be able to 
carry out under the United 
Nations extended program- 
me of technical aid to un- 
der-developed countries was 
discussed by the Economic 
and Social Council (ECO 
SOC) at Geneva, on Au- 
gust 3. 
ECOSOC delegates first 
heard Dr. Jaime Torres 
Bodet, Director-General of 
Unesco describe some of the 
ideas which had guided 
Unesco in the preparation 
of this plan. 
(Large extracts from the 
text of Dr. Torres Bodet’s 
address to the Council are 
given on page 4 of this is- 
sue of the Courier.) 
Unesco’s plan which is 
part of the combined UN- 
Specialized Agencies plan 
for technical aid considered 
by ECOSOC, was ap- 
proved in its entirety last 
June by Unesco’s Executive 
Board. (A summary of the 
proposals adopted by the 
Board was given in the July 
issue of the Courier). 
The plan will again be 
considered by the Execu- 
tive Board this month in 
the light of the action 
taken by ECOSOC, in- 
cluding its recommendation 
that Unesco should receive 
fourteen per cent of the 
tctal funds available for 
technical aid, and will be 
presented for approval to 
Unesco’s Fourth Session of 
the General Conference 
which opens in Paris on 
Szptember 19. 
Broadly speaking, Unes- 
co’s aid programme provi- 
des for assistance in tech- 
nical, elementary and fun- 
damental adult education; 
advice on the production 
and use of materials for 
education; including mass 
ccmmunication materials, 
and the technical needs of 
press, radio and film; the 
training of teachers and 
other specialized person- 
nel; planning and organi- 
zation of scientific research 
and training laboratories; 
and help in the develop- 
ment of local cultures. 
Unesco’s Helping 
Hand 
I N carrying out this pro- 
gramme, Unesco will 
make use of different me- 
thods according to the 
needs of the under-deve- 
loped countries. The most 
direct and immediate form 
of technical aid it can offer 
is in sending advisers and 
ccensultants whose work 
would range from adminis- 
trative advice to direct res- 
ponsibility for establishing 
new types of institutions 
(such as teacher training 
centres or scientific labora- 
teries). 
Cther methods Unesco 
can offer include explora- 
tory missions, permanent 
regional services through 
field science offices, and a 
broad training programme 
covering fellowships, semi- 
nars, symposia, experimen- 
tal or demonstration pro- 
jects in fundamental edu- 
cation, and regional train- 
ing centres. 
Unesco also hopes to help 
under-developed countries 
by promoting the distribu- 
tion of educational, scienti- 
fic and technical books and 
periodicals, by the publica- 
tion of special pamphlets 
and moncgraphs, and the 
setting up of scientific and 
technical institutes. 
Unesco’s approach to the 
question of technical assis- 
tance was the subject of 
many favourable comments 
from ECOSOC delegates 
during the Council’s discus- 
sion of the proposals. 
Emphasising that these 
propesals had been con- 
ceived by Unesco in terms 
of the experience it had 
already gained in the field 
of technical assistance, Dr. 
Sutch (New Zealand) com- 
mended the Unesco recom- 
mendation that: «adminis- 
trative problems... should 
be solved by the co-ordi- 
nation of projects and not 
by the setting up of new 
administrative machinery». 
The mature and circum- 
spect attitude displayed by 
Unesco in that respect was 
well brought out, said Dr. 
Sutch, by the emphasis laid 
on the selection by the re- 
cipient countries themselves 
cf the fields in which they 
need assistance, as well as 
cn the principle that, cace 
initiated, a scheme must be 
continued by the country 
itself. 
Dr. Torres Bodet remark- 
ed that the ‘discussion had 
brought out the general in- 
terest shown by members in 
Unesco’s pregramme. The 
diversity of views expressed 
on certain points of the 
programme provided no 
reasen for discouragement, 
he said, for it reflected the 
diversity of requszsts which 
the beneficiary countries 
would address to Unesco.

Unesco is designed T 
to stimulate the pro-

lofty aspiration is one of 
the conditions of peace, as 
was recognized by the Sta-

that the peace must there-

That solidarity would be 
no more than an empty

remained at once the cau- 
se and the effect of igno- 
rance—the cause because to 
it are due whole genera- 
tions lacking schools, towns 
without libraries, cities wi- 
thout health; the effect, 
because ignorance impove- 
rishes the peoples, prevents 
their making rational use 
of what they have and sub- 
jects them to the tyranny 
of nature. «The battle of 
man against nature», Mi- 
chelet once said, «of free- 
will against blind fate, be- 
gan with the world itself». 
And he added a phrase 
which I feel bound to quote 
because, to my mind, it 
brings out so well the effect 
our discussions may have 
on history: «The haves 
will ever have more, and 
the, have-nots will ever 
have less, unless industry 
bridges the gulf dividing 
rich and poor» 
That bridge can and 
must be built by technical 
assistance, and it is thus 
that such assistance will 
serve the cause of peace. 
Eut what kind of technical 
assistance? Help designed 
by foreigners from their 
own point of view only, and 
seeing in the latent possi- 
bilities of a country no 
more than a problem of ra- 
pid and all too often su- 
perficial exploitation ? Or 
the help which seeks first 
to understand the human 
factors with which it must 
cc-operate ? Clearly the 
only possible type of help 
is that which, instead of 
applying a mechanical de- 
velopment formula will sti- 
mulate new energies, will 
seek to meet the highest 
aspirations of the peoples 
for full self-expression and 
will not confine itself to 
abstract considerations of 
economic mechanisms. in 
other words, a type cf help 
which does not aim at ma- 
nufacturing «robots» and 
which, with reference to 
«Economic Man» does not 
accent the adjective or for- 
get the man to exalt a sin- 
gle one of his qualities. 
This more human view 
of technical assistance is 
assuredly not the monopoly 
of Unesco. However, within 
the plan as a whole, it does 
define our Organization's 
function and, further, hap- 
pens to be the ineluctable 
4 
sclidarity of 
condition of our effective 
participation. 
Priority 
for Education 
T is development we 
Ji have in mind. As that 
is our goal, priority 
should be granted to the 
programmes of education 
which must precede, ac- 
company and follow any 
economic development wor- 
thy of the name. That is 
why the programme pre- 
pared by Unesco accords so 
much importance, in the 
scheme for technical assis- 
tance, to fundamental edu- 
cation. Nevertheless, to con- 
fine our part to fundamen- 
tal education alone would 
be a mistake which we 
should soon regret. Cam- 
paigns against illiteracy are 
never more successful than 
when they appeal to the 
illiterate as the first stage 
in a progression whose fi- 
nal end is not so much 
learning to read as secur- 
ing the means to improve 
have in mind is not a busi- 
ness proposition; not an 
econcmic enterprise, but 
econcmic development. To 
promote the latter we have 
to plan, along with measu- 
res yielding early but pos- 
sib ly ephemeral results, 
others which gc deeper and 
will endure. The second 
group will not necessarily 
require more time for put- 
ting into operation than the 
first. In any case their pos- 
sible slowness does not 
seem to cause any special 
uneasiness to countries 
hoping much from the exe- 
cution of our projects. To 
take an instance, the re- 
quests so far received by 
Unesco are not, as might 
have been thought, for fun- 
damental, but for techni- 
cal, education. The coun- 
tries which send us these 
requests want to have their 
own physicists and che- 
mists, their own economists 
and mathematicians. I re- 
peat their own — not just 
temporary foreign advisers. 
Unesco is naturally con- 
the elementary rules of hy- 
giene and training for 
small-scale industries. 
In agreement with the 
government authorities, we 
have gone farther still in 
technical assistance by ins- 
tituting, in what we might 
call «demonstration areas», 
pilot projects such as that 
of the Gosseline Valley in 
Haiti. Here, apart from the 
fundamental education gi- 
ven to the people as a 
whole, we have opened a 
Rural Teachers’ Training 
Centre, and to ensure 
teaching material conform- 
ing as far as possible to lo- 
cal requirements, we have 
also organized a local cen- 
tre for its production. On 
the same principle we have 
started in China an expe- 
rimental centre for the 
preparation of audio-visual 
educational material. 
Our chief concern how- 
ever has kecsn, and remains, 
to provide for the peoples 
concerned, not help from 
without, of whose foreign 
origin they would always be

COUNTRIES 
i“ H, 
factors condition the economic 
development of any country 
Dr Torres Bodet addressing 
ECOSOC at Geneva, Aug. 3 
" the material circumstances 
of their lives. Some time 
ago I myself conducted a 
campaign against illiteracy 
in my own country. In a 
humble little village hun- 
dreds of miles from Mexico 
City, a peasant more than 
sixty years old said to me 
one day: «Well, sir, my fa- 
mily and I have learnt to 
read and write. For that I 
thank you. But couldn’t 
you send us someone to 
teach us something more 
practical? For instance, 1 
want to be an architects. 
That little story is signi- 
ficant. Probably the old 
man had no very clear idea 
of architecture, but almost 
by intuition, he had hit on 
the precise word whose two 
Greek roots bring to our 
minds the notion of man 
as builder and man as lea- 
der of his fellow workers. 
In developing a country, 
fundamental education—as 
my fellow-countryman well 
knew-—is only a stage; pri- 
mary education is another. 
Hzncz the attack must be 
basic, and launched simul- 
taneously against both the 
ignorance of the illiterate 
and the inadequacy of hi- 
gher scientific education. 
We must train skilled 
workmen, but also foremen 
and supervisors, engineers 
and technicians. 
I repeat that what we 
cerned to safeguard native 
cultures. Here we fully rea- 
lize that any bold scheme 
of economic development 
must necessarily involve a 
transformation, a change 
in the face of the country. 
But we do not wish to sti- 
mulate an artificial pro- 
gress without roots in the 
national life and which, 
instead of fostering growth, 
would impose a degree of 
uniformity. My very belief 
in a united world is the 
reasen for my rejection of 
a standardized world. 
Union embraces differen- 
ces; uniformity abolishes 
them and thereby in some 
sort destroys the very no- 
tion of union. Agreement is 
the direct opposite of sa- 
meness. 
First in the Field 
NESCO has the ad- 
| vantage of having 
already practised 
technical assistance bzforz 
the term was ccined, for 
the educational missions 
which we have sent to 
countries requesting them 
are surely nothing else. In 
this same year seminars or 
werking conferences have 
been arranged in Brazil on 
«A Campaign against Illite- 
racy», and in India on 
«Adult Education in Rural 
Areas», which includes both 
conscious, but an opportu- 
nity to use their own ener- 
gies in their own interests, 
material and spiritual. The 
prcgress we have been able 
to achieve through the use 
of these methods is seen 
in an increase in the capa- 
cities of the people them- 
selves, which is itself the 
best guarantee for the qua- 
lity and permanence of 
that progress. We have fol- 
lowed the same principle 
in the field of science pure 
and simple. For instance," 
our four Science Co-opera- 
tion Offices, each in its 
own area, supply the indi- . 
viduals and bodies concer- 
ned with documentation 
such as publications, films 
and details of scientific 
material and equipment, 
news, and grants for study 
abroad. 
Cur scholarship program- 
me has expanded to such 
an extent that it is the 
main activity of one of our 
departments, that of Ex- 
change of Persons, for 
which we have estimated a 
sum of more than §350,000 
in our 195C Budget. I shall 
confine myself to these 
instances, selected from 
those which will probably 
strike you as the most to- 
pical, from cur existing ex- 
perience of technical assis- 
tance. 
With all this immense va- 
riety, our work none the 
less remains within the 
terms of technical assistan- 
ce as defined by the Social 
and Economic Council. Had 
it been a question of mate- 
rial and financial help to 
secure the necessary degree 
of technical progress for 
the economic development 
cf these countries, our pro- 
jects would undoubtedly 
have been far different. We 
might then have been near- 
er meeting the aspirations 
of certain States already 
aware of their own pro- 
blems which are less in 
need of skilled advice than 
of material means to exe- 
cute their plans of develop- 
ment. \ 
In such circumstances we 
could have made provision, 
in addition to the services 
mentioned, for contribu- 
tions to purchases of scien- 
tific equipment, film projec- 
tors, motor cars fitted out 
for rural education and so 
on. It would then have 
been possible to decide on 
a fixed annual budget. Ho- 
wever, for the moment we 
have had to confine our- 
selves to the principle of 
technical assistance. 
Given a plan such as we 
are now discussing, is it not 
possible that the very spe- 
cial features of its execu- 
tion call for financial me- 
thods adapted to them? It 
is hardly possible at this 
stage to know either the 
detailed requests that Sta- 
tes make or the extent of 
their own contribution. The 
procedure imposed by the 
rigid heads of a normal 
Budget would involve 
unending risks of delay and 
lack of flexibility. 
Would it not be appro- 
priate to consider a sim- 
pler formula, more in tune 
with the complexity of this 
undertaking, than an an- 
nual budgetary appropria- 
tion ? A revolving fund for 
technical assistance, divid- 
ed, if you like, into fairly 
flexible appropriations, 
might perhaps better meet 
the requirements of a 
scheme many of the de- 
tails of which must still 
be unknown to us. 
Our budgetary estimates 
amcunt, for the first year, 
to about $6,150,030. As mat- 
ters now stand, this esti- 
mate can be no mere than 
approximate. It seems mo- 
dest enough if we think 
of all that is required, from 
the intellectual and social 
pcint of view, by economic 
develcpment. If we reflect 
on the number of experts 
available, it is considera- 
ble. It is modest again, if 
we remember the lack of 
schools and of school and 
university equipment from 
which almost every coun- 
try in the world is suffer- 
ing. It is substantial, inas- 
much as this is essentially 
a matter of technical assis- 
tance. In any case, if our 
proposals are approved by 
the General Conference, 
this sum would help us to 
give to that economic deve- 
lopment towards which the 
United Nations’ scheme is 
directing our endeavours, 
the social and human foun- 
dations needed to ensure its 
stability.

reason for my rejection of a standardized 
seworld. ” J. TORRES BODET.

### 74062: A Letter from Quitandinha

a Totton 
ther bra 
(Petropolis, Brazil, Aug. 1.) 
HE Seminar has begun work 
in a manner which far sur- 
passed our expectations. 
The preparatory work developed 
by Unesco, the organization of 
American States and the Brazilian 
Government has been exemplary. 
We have received a hundred 
delegates and observers, all of 
them distinguiched educators 1n 
their countries, who represent all 
the countries of America without 
any exception, plus England, 
France, Holland, India and 
Egypt. 
The participants found the most 
complete organization. As you 
know, we prepared regulations for 
this Seminar based on those used at 
the Caracas Seminar, which is 
nothing more than an adaptation 
of the experiences of the German 
seminar as a university institute to 
the principle of international co- 
operation. 
The opening date was the 27th 
of July, the inaugural session being 
presided over by the Brazilian 
Minister of Education. The very 
same day we proceeded to orga- 
nize five working groups which 
was a simple task, for the delegates 
had already received complete 
information on the themes to be 
dealt with at the Seminar. At 9 
o'clock in the morning, July 28, the 
groups were duly constituted and 
we began work. 
Group I, under the leadership 
of Dr. Germano Jardim, statistical 
expert of Brazil, includes such 
important personages as Dr. Anixio 
Texeira de Freitas, who has been 
called "the wizard of Brazilian 
statistics’; and Dr. Ernesto Nel- 
son, one of the most famous of 
Argentine educators, who was 
especially invited by the Organizing 
Committee. 
This group has two principal 
purposes.’ First, to present 
America with the reality of the 
problem cof illiteracy in numerical 
figures. We hope that the presenta- 
tion of this problem will be 
very clearly made in order that.it 
may arouse public opinion in the 
American nations. ~~ With this 
purpose in mind, we have organized 
the services of specialists in the 
drawing up of statistical graphs, 
who will analyze the numerical 
data the technicians will obtain 
and present their findings in the 
form of graphs. The group will 
use as a basis the excellent material 
prepared by the Inter-American 
Institute of Statistics, 
The second objective of this 
group refers to the study of 
principles of the elaboration of 
cultural statistics in the Americas, 
which thould be submitted to the 
Inter-American Statistical Confe- 
rence to meet at Bogota, No- 
vember of this year. That Con- 
ference will be attended by all the 
American States for the purpose 
of defining standards for the 1950 
general census of the Americas to 
take place i n twenty-two American 
countries. 
In this way, as you see, we shall 
succeed in making known the 
opinion of the educators with 
regard to preparing a cultural cen- 
sus. 
Group II is working on the or- 
ganization of anti-illiteracy cam- 
paigns. It functions under the 
direction of Dr. Lourenco Filho, 
well-known Brazihan educator, 
head of anti-illiteracy campaigns 
in his country, who has prepared 
a working paper for his group with 
great care. 
We hope that this group will 
draw up complete outlines on 
legislation, administrative organi- 
zation, private co-operation, fi- 
nancing, etc., which will be useful 
to the gevernments in organizing 
their campaigns. We have tried 
to bring into this group individuals 
who are present at the Seminar 
who are heads of education 
campaigns, as well as persons who 
are in a position of leadership for 
the promotion and development of 
anti-illiteracy campaigns in their 
respective countries. 
Group III deals with every- 
thing related to objectives and 
techniques in illiteracy. It studies 
also the adaptation of manuals, 
the psychology of adults, and 
teaching methods. This group is 
directed by Dr. Rex. Outstanding 
in this group is Miss Ann N. 
Clark, whese experience in the 
production of maternal for illiterates 
is well known. 
The fourth group is working on 
the subject of the American 
Primary Schocl, whose deficiency 
1s the ultimate cause of illiteracy in 
the Americas. Statistical studies 
point out that there are about 19 
million school-age children in 
America who lack schools. The 
CLASSICAL 
HE term «classical studies» has 
not that world compass for 
which Unesco strives, being 
confined to studies of ancient 
Greece and Rome. All the same, I be- 
lieve that thes develotment and the 
international crganization of classical 
studies are of considerable importance 
to Unesco. 
Eurcpeans cof earlier days learnt 
from the Greek school to look upon all 
pecple of non-European civilization az 
barbarians, and the Romans invented 
the notion of Pax Romana, which 
sancticns the rule of a single people 
de:tined, by its superior civilization, 
to play the part of protector cf all 
nations wishing to live in peace. Al- 
thcugh these idzas, hai no doubt un- 
fortunate effects, thesy nevertheless 
contributed greatly not only towards 
creating the spiritual community of 
Europe, but also towards fostering the 
concept of a civilizing vanguard, which 
did so much fer the ‘remendous 
expansion of Eurove with results 
which will end either in the unifica- 
tion or in the suicide of our unhappy 
planet. 
For a long time now the European 
mind haz been, if I may say so, 
omnivorous and, but for that western 
appetite for knowledge and study of 
all civilizations in the world. The 
icea of creating Unesco would nt have 
been conceived. - Now this attitude, 
unique, I think, in the work of a long 
series of great Europeans, who from 
their studies of the Greeks became

steeped in the ideas of cosmopolita- 
nism, respect for every man and every 
individual people, and univer:al under- 
starding. 
Finally, if Unesco can hope to bring 
about world undesrstanding, it is be- 
cause European civilization, building 
upcn the achievement of the Greek 
philosophers and their successors, has 
p:ovided it with the elements of an 
ideclogical world community. which. 
Jespite the ambiguity of such terms 
as liberty and democracy, is opening 
the way to fruitful discus:zion. This, in 
the world of the mind, represents the 
utmost measu:e of agrzement that can 
be desired. 
After these premises, which I must 
apolcgize for having thus condensed, I 
would like to add cre rzmark of a 
more special character,” There is no 
denying that Unesco must approach 
the great periods of civilization with 
the me:t ccmplete objectivity. At the 
same time, the almost overwhelming 
greatness cf its ultimate geal must 
make it humble in the setting of ts 
immediate targets. There iz therefore. 
reason for satisfacticn that Unesco 
appears to realize the ne=d of a certain 
selection of limited fields and unier- 
stand: thai slow and indirect results 
are often more effective than rapid 
ard direct ones. 
From these considerations I con- 
clude that Une:cc has the right and 
the duty to give entire encouragement 
to efforts aimed at preserving the 
supra-naticnalist and peaceful essence, 
the life and strength, of the civilization 
which was born in Greece, grew up 
under the name of Eurcpean civiliza- 
tion and conquered half the world. 
This mean: that its common history 
must he made known and appreciated. 
To take an example, we cannot 
ignore studies which endeavour to 
throw light on the sources common 
to Stalinist communism (wich is link- 
ed with Greek civilization through 
Byzantinism and Hegelian philosophy), 
to American idealism and to Unesco’s 
cwn Constitution. 
Ncthing, in fact, can better serve 
the aims of Unesco than a re-awaken- 
ing among Europeans, and among 
those of kindred civilization, ¢f a 
general interest in their common past. 
And it is natural that Unesco should 
undertake to represent the interests 
cf that Greco-Roman civilization 
which has nc seat ameng the delega- 
tions to the Unitad Nations, 
Nothing, however, would be more 
disastrous than to imagine that we 
can serve up the cream without regard 
for those whe do the work and milk 
ths cows. The study cf classical antiqui- 
ty is continually renewed by subtle 
interplay between cbserver and observ- 
ed. Consequently. any efforts towards 
popularization which are nct based 
upcn solid and recent research will 
have at the best a purely ornamental 
value. 
Philclogists, archaeologists and classi- 
cal historians arz aware of their 
responsibility. Without neglecting re- 
search, which is their spiritual daily 
bread, they seek to provide the public 
with a better knowledge and under- 
standing cf classical civilization and of 
its relations with the civilizations of 
today, Research workers in every pam 
of Europe (including Russia) and in 
the Amecricas and Australia have been 
working fcr centuries in this common 
field ; no profession has such a long 
internaticnal traditicn as c¢lassical 
rhilology (witness the use of Latin, the 
first interrational language cf the 
West). Modern conditicns, however, 
call for the development of new forms 
cf nternaticnalism. We need an 
international organization to secure 
bibliographical service and the 
establishment or continuation of 
certain great ccllective enterprises, to 
rationalize and stimulate the editing 
and publication of classical texts, to 
crganize meelings and congresses, to 
enccurage the production of good 
porular books, in a word, to ensure, 
in form: adapted to medern needs, the 
supra-naticnal character which has al- 
ways Lbtezen the mark of classical 
studies, and to help disseminate the 
preven kncwledge of our European 
past and thus contribute to that work 
of mutual understanding and of pzace 
which is Uresco’s prcud device. 
That iz why in 1948 we established 
an International Federation of 
Sccieties fcr Classical Studies. That 
is why we are delighted tc be 
affiliated with Unesco, W= hope that 
cur Federation, among the many 
institutions grouped arcund the parent 
crganization, will occupy the position 
which is due to the heir to such a 
srlendid legacy.

### 74065: A Thousand years ago... Avicenna Persian scientist and philosopher, brought knowledge to the West

  
  
  
  
A Thousand years ago... 
AVICENNA 
Persian Scientist and Philosopher, 
brought Knowledge to the West 
by Camille ABOUSSOUAN 
N the Middle Ages about 1150. 
some 50 years before Aristotle's 
Metaphysics was known, works 
by a Persian named Avicen- 
na—a Metaphysics, a book, De 
Anima, treatises, De Caelo and De 
- Animalibus, and works on science 
and philosophy—brought to West- 
ern Europe the essentials of an 
extensive and well-constructed 
system. The philosophic East thus 
~ first set foot in Europe, where it 
was to remain, closely associated 
with Thomism, until the present 
day; this Persian scholar gave the 
world a body of 335 works, scienti- 
fic even more than philosophic, 
which was to play an important 
part in the development of know- 
ledge. Up to the 18th century, his 
works on medicine were still 
"standard textbooks in all the uni- 
versities of Europe. His studies of 
mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
astronomy and botany, his treat- 
- ises on the administration of the 
- army and on the State land taxes, 
© his epistle on love, his correspond- 
ence with other scientists of the 
time, his philosophical, legal, lin- 
guistic and poetic works, and even 
‘his commentaries on magic, entitle 
him to be considered as one of the 
most striking figures in world civi- 
lization. 
~~ A thousand lunar years ago, in 
980 A.D. Abu Ali al Husain ibn 
Abdallah ibn Sina, called Avicen- 
na, was born at Afsana, near Bo- 
khara, in Persia. Thanks to the 
care lavished upon him in child- 
hood, he very early acquired a 
wide learning unusual among his 
contemporaries. Although a Per- 
sian, he wrote all his works in 
Arabic, and only a few poems, a 
“Yireatise on pulsation and another 
on the principles of science were 
written in his native language. 
- What we know of his life we have 
learnt from himself. His follower, 
“Al Juzjani, added some details, and 
writers from Al Qifti onwards have 
- repeated what is known, while Ibn 
.Khallikan and Abu Osaybia added 
comments. 
Opened Medical School 
' IKE all good Muslims, he first 
learnt the Koran; he then 
made the acquaintance of 
Arabic literature, Greek philosophy, 
law, theology, medicine, geometry, 
physics and mathematics. Porphy- 
rius, Euclid and Ptolemy occupied 
most of his time until he reached 
the age of 16, when, being more 
- learned than any of his teachers, 
he established his own school, 
- with many doctors working under 
his guidance. He was particularly 
interested in philosophy and, 
after devoting a year and a 
half almost exclusively to its 
study, he had read Aristotle's 
Metaphysics more than 40 times, 
although its meaning remained 
obscure until one day he came acr- 
oss Alfarabi’s commentary on the 
work, when all became clear. 
"Whenever I was in perplexity”, 
he said, "whenever I could not 
grasp the middle term of a syl- 
logism, I would go to the Mosque 
and pray, imploring the Creator of 
all things to open my understand- 
ing and smooth away the diffi- 
culty.” 
When he was 18 and had acqui- 
red all the learning of the time, 
he was summoned, because of his 
reputation as a doctor, to attend 
the Sultan, who had been stricken 
with a serious illness. He cured 
him and, as a reward, the ruler 
gave him permission to work in 
his magnificent library; he also 
consulted him on State affairs 
and, generally, on other matters, 
and enabled him to spend much 
time in study.

then beginning to take an interest 
in political life and, leaving Bo- 
khara, wandered from one court 
to another among ‘the Emirs of 
Northern Persia and the lands 
around the Caspian Sea. A pa- 
tron named Es-Siraji showered 
wealth upon him, and for "iim 
Avicenna wrote several works. He 
began writing the Qanur or 
“Canon of Medicine” at Juiian; 
and then wrote his first episules; 
went to Rai to attend the Prince 
Majd ad Dawla, who was ill; and 
finally to Hamadan where he cured 
the Emir, who appointed him 
Vizier. There Avicenna spent his 
days on the business of the State 
and his nights on his own works. 
The Al-Shifa and the Qanun fi- 
t-tibb his masterly work on medi- 
cine, which was the Bible of all 
doctors in the East and West for 
centuries, were written then. In 
the latter treatise, among many 
lucid explanations of the functions 
and disease of the human body, 
Avicenna says that “the retina is 
the essential organ of sight, which 
had previously been thought to be 
the crystalline lense of the eye; 
defines meningitis as inflammation 
of the membranes enveloping the 
brain; recognize the various fund- 
amental types cf jaundice; maint- 
ains against Galen that apoplexy 
is of plethoric origin; postulates 
the theory of the placental trans- 
mission of certain infections; 
draws attention to the therapeutic 
properties of aconite; puts forward 
the idea of tracheotomy; suggests 
treating cases of anaemia by 
making the patient suck fresh 
marrow from bones, etc.” 
On the death of the Emir of 
Hamadan, his enemies imprisoned 
Avicenna in the fortress of Fer- 
dajan. There he almost completed 
the sections on logic, mathema- 
tics, physics and metaphysics in 
the Al-Shifa and went on to write 
several works on philosophy and 
medicine, including the allegory of 
Hai Ben Yagzan on intelligence. 
Flight to Ispahan 
HIS enforced retirement 
gave him leisure for work, 
but it did not last very 
long. When he returned to 
Hamadan, he no longer felt secure 
and, with the help of his faithful 
companion Al Juzjani, prepared to 
flee to Ispahan. They left the 
town, disguised as Sufis, and, 
after travelling for 13 months 
through hestile lands, reached 
Ispahan where the were welcomed 
with great honour by the Emir 
Alal Addin. Avicenna completed 
the Al-Shifa there and, as the 
work was a lengthy one, made a 
summary of it, which he had 
begun at Jurjan and which is 
known as the Al Nadjat. 
So far, the development of his 
philosop had been Aristotelian, 
and these two books defined it; 
but in the last years of his life in 
Ispahan there was a very definite 
development in his work, particu- 
larly in the Kitab el-Jcharat wa’ 
tanbihat, or "Book of Theorems”, 
the last of his works which has 
come down to us complete. The 
“Theorems” marked the end of 
Avicenna’s development. 
Unfortunately, this work has 
never yet been translated in full. 
We are informed that Mlle Goi- 
chon, who is cne of the foremost 
specialists on Avicenna, has just 
finished a translation into French. 
This will help Westerners to 
realize more clearly Avicenna’s 
remarkable contribution to medie- 
val philosophy at a time when, 
one thousand years after his birth, 
he still stands an acknowledged 
master. 
This great philosopher and scien- 
tist died in piety at the age of 
57 in Ispahan, the city of roses, 
after freeing his slaves and bestow- 
ing his property on the poor.

### 74068: Famine threatens man

### 74066: Mass communication: experts review technical needs of press, film and radio

‘MASS COMMUNICATIONS 
EXPERTS REVIEW TECHNICAL 
NEEDS OF PRESS, 
FILM AND RADIO 
FTER considering the reports drawn up by the Secre- 
tariat on news agencies the press, the film and the radio 
in the fourteen countries covered by the 1949 survey, 
the Commission on Technical Needs, which met from 
25 July to 3 August 1949, spent a week in drafting very specific 
conclusions and recommendations to Unesco, in the light of 
information gathered in forty-three countries over a pericd of 
three years. 
The Commission emphasized, in the first place, the impor- 
tance it attached to Unesco’s surveys being continued so as to 
cover the whole world. 
Documents gathered and the findings of the Commission 
enable Unesco to assist in the vigorous promotion of the free 
flow of information. As a source of reference, the importance 
of the assembled data cannot be over-estimated and the Com- 
mission noted the value of this documentation to many Depart- 
ments of Unesco, to government services, professional associa- 
tions and private workers in the press, film and radio who have 
asked for either information or advice. The Commission was of 
the opinion that eventually, when the world survey was com- 
pleted, the collected reports, carefully brought up to date, should 
be published as four separate volumes dealing respectively with 
new agencies, press, film and radio. Subsequently, annual sup- 
plements should be issued keeping the information up to date. 
Fruitful Cooperation 
HE Commission was glad to note the fruitful co-operation 
established between the Mass Communications Department 
and the appropriate organs of the United Nations and the Spe- 
cialized Agencies, and particularly with the Sub-Commission on 
Freedom of Information and of the Press, the FAO (in ques- 
tions related to newsprint), the Economic Commission for 
Europe, the International Trade Organization (GATT) and the 
International Telecommunications Union. The Commission 
asked that this co-operation be developed to the greatest pos- 
sible degree. 
It also recommended that the survey reports and the recom- 
mendations as a whole should be taken into account in the 
plans for technical assistance and economic development at 
present being considered by the United Nations and its Spe- 
cialized Agencies. 
Experts considered that the information collected by Unesco, 
« which presents a unique picture of the existing facilities for 
the diffusion of ideas by word and image », should be brought 10 
the knowledge of persons and organizations that could make use 
of it. The reports published after each survey, and the annual 
supplements could obviously contain only a part of all the 
information collected. The Commission considered that Unesco 
should use this non-published information by arranging for 
the publication of pamphlets on a number of special subjects. 
Professional Training 
THE Commission laid particular stress on professional train- 
ing. Thus it reaffirmed and supplemented the suggestions 
made by previous commissions especially as regards the 
establishment of an International Institute of Press and Informa- 
tion. The Commission regarded it as essential that a beginning 
be made with this project in the course of 1950. 
It was also recommended, firstly, that missions of experts 
should be sent to the more needy countries and should help 
them, at their request, to institute new services or develop those 
already in existence, and secondly that Unesco should organize 
a number of seminars for radio and film personnel. 
The Commission furthermore suggested a number of supple- 
mentary enterprises, regarding the use of printing characters 
for printing in Asiatic languages; the organization of collective 
listening, ete. 
Finally, it suggested the setting up of « permanent advisory 
ccmmittees... composed of persons throughout the world who 
have a specialized knowledge of these individual and technical 
subjects ». 
It should be noted that the experts of the Commission on 
Technical Needs were careful to suggest to Unesco only concrete 
and practical tasks that could, for the most part, be carried out 
with the appropriations and staff available to the Mass Com- 
munications Department and certain other Unesco Departments 
aireciiy concerned.

### 74067: Remove the barriers

 
REMOVE THE BARRIERS 
By Julian BEHRSTOCK, 
Head of the Free Flow Division 
« Division of Free Flow 
of Information » is the 
rather high-sounding title 
given to that section of 
Unesco which seeks to en- 
able the people of diffe- 
rent countries to know 
each other better by ex- 
changing ideas and infor- 
mation. 
You have a personal 
stake in the success of this 
Division if: 
You have been prevented 
from ordering books from 
abroad because of the for- 
eign exchange regulations 
Fourth and latest of these 
pamphlets is "U.N. tackles the 
Problem” prepared by Petes 
Kihss, writer for the New 
York Herald Tribune” and 
an authority on the work of 
the United Nations. The 
pamphlet sets forth the broad 
outlines of the food problem, 
tells of methods used to attack 
it and suggests ways in which 
everyone may aid these 
efforts. 
Other pamphlets include 
"Fcod and People”, a debate 
between Aldous Huxley and 
Sir John Russell on the 
feasibility of solving the 
hunger problem; Alphabet 
of the Soil”, by Dr. Guillem- 
mo Nannetti, which tells of 
in force in your country ; 
Your newspaper prints 
scarcely any foreign news 
because it lacks news- 
print ; 
You have been unable to 
afford a favourite foreign 
print because of high Cus- 
‘toms duties ; 
As a start in removing 
these and many similar 
obstacles to the free flow 
of information between 
countries Unesco has 
placed emphasis on a few 
key problems capable of 
yielding practical recults. 
ATENS MAN 
By Peter DUBERG the means for fighting soll 
erosion; and “The Family's 
Fcod” by Margaret Mead, 
which tells how existing food 
stocks may best be usca for 
utmost nutritional values. 
Su oplementary materials such 
as q.scussion guides and 
picture ooklets also are 
available. - 
The Bureau of  urrent 
Affairs, 117 Piccadilly, Louw 
den W.1, is publishing the 
pamphlet series in English. 
Arrangements are being made 
with publishers 1a Latin 
America and other areas in 
order that these texts may be 
as widely reproduced as 
possible. They will also be 
obtainable through the Unesco 
National Commissions of most 
member nations. 
Reducing Economic 
Obstacles 
T HUS, a great deal of 
attention has been 
given to overcoming eco- 
nomic obstacles. 
A far-reaching proposal 
was submitted in March 
to a 34-nation conference 
on tariffs and trade at 
Annecy, France, asking 
the conference to reduce 
duties on a wide range of 
educational and scientific 
materials. 
The Annecy Conference, 
in response to Unesco’s re- 
quest, reduced duties on 
radio receivers and other- 
items of an educational 
character. In addition the 
34 nations pledged that in 
future tariff negotiations 
they would continue to 
« assist in furthering the 
objectives sought by Unes- 
co ». 
Co-operation with 
U.N. Economic Commuis- 
sions 
C OMPLEMENTING the 
action to secure re- 
duction of Customs duties, 
Unesco has launched a 
major campaign, in con- 
junction with the Regional 
1. onomic Commissions of 
the "nited Nations. to 
h ie '  *ries satisfy their

requirements and cul- 
tional, scientific Toshi . spite

Recommendations 
to Governments 
FE ABRLY in the year 
the Director-General 
sent Member States a me- 
morandum recommending 
the release of larger 
amounts of foreign ex- 
change for educational 
purchases and the simpli- 
fication and co-ordination 
of import procedures. 
Other recommendations, 
in preparation, request 
wider application of plans 
adopted under the auspi- 
ces of the Universal Postal 
Union to permit payment 
in national currency for 
subscriptions to foreign 
newspapers and periodi- 
cals and for a reduction 
of 50 per cent, on postal 
charges for printed matter.

cal conferences under

ternational Telecommuni- 
cations Union, Unesco 
has represented the pub- 
Europe . 
ed 
tional telephone and tele- 
graph regulations, Unesco 
called for greater priori- 
ties and more reduced 
rates for press messages. 
A Washington Conference 
of Inter-American broad- 
casting services adopted a 
number of Unesco-initiat- 
recommendations on 
the use of radio in the 
interests of peace and in 
the fight against illiteracy. 
The most striking sue: 
cess was obtained at a 63- 
nation Conference in Me- 
xico for the world-wide 
allocation of high frequen- 
cies. At Unesco’s sugges- 
tion, the Conference in 
February pledged that the 
frequencies allocated at 
Mexico would not be used 
« for purposes contrary to 
mutual understanding and 
tolerance ». The Fourth 
Session of the General 
Conference has been asked 
to take the first steps 
towards transforming that 
pledge into an internation- 
al convention on the use 
of broadcasting for peace. 
Freedom of Information 
M OTIVATED again by 
its concern for a 
more rational use of the 
means of mass communi- 
cation, Unesco has prepar- 
ed a number of brochures 
for publication on subjects 
such as professional train- 
ing for journalism, and 
education by radio. 
Among other continuing 
Unesco activities to pro- 
mote more abundant and 
better quality information 
is its plan for the esta- 
blishment of an Interna- 
tional Institute of Press 
 
“UNESCO FEATURES” 
« Qur newspaper is u 
small regional daily which 
lives solely on its sales and 
its advertisements. Our in- 
come does not permit us to 
have any correspondents 
outside the department or 
to commission any articles. 
We are therefore very 
happy to be able to give 
"our readers news of current 
international cultural life 
which we could not other- 
wise do... We have immedia- 
tely used some of the arti- 
cles in Unesco Features 
N° 1, which seemed likely to 
be of educational value to 
our readers », writes the adi- 
tor of Quarante-Quatre, 
Agen, Lot-et-Garonne, 
France. And the editor of a 
newspaper in Wurttemberg, 
Germany, writes as follows: 
« We thank you for 
the first issue of your out- 
standing service. The con- 
tents are of great help for 
our editorial work and we 
are sure to make use of it.» 
Mr. Song Thian Eng of 
the Sarawak Tribune tells 
us how welcome the service 
is and promises that Unesco 
Features will be published 
in the editorial column of 
his paper, which also will 
make good use of the short 
items. 
The Information Officer 
of the French administra- 
tion in Dahomey writes 
« I can assure you that 
your articles will be appre- 
ciated by the readers of 
« France-Dahomey », which 
is the official organ of the 
Dahomey colony. » 
These few extracts from 
many letters received by the 
Press Unit well illustrate 
the scope and aim of the 
newly started « Unesco 
Features ». Of the many 
thousand recipients of this 
fortnightly press service the 
majority are provincial 
newspapers and the press 
in under-developed areas. 
It is this press which 
Unesco Features mainly 
serves. Items and articles 
of recent advances in 
science and technology are

with the news from his re- 
ligion, his tribe, his village. 
He wants to read about 
other peoples. Unesco Fea- 
tures tries to help satisfy 
this need. Every fortnight 
well over 5,000 words of ar- 
ticles and short items are 
being sent from Unesco 
House in the English, 
French and Spanish lan- 
guages to newspaper editors 
in all countries where 
Unesco operates.

the United Nations General Assembly will remain <¢just another documents 
T HE Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted last December by 
unless public opinion as a whole supports the Declaration by declaring its 
will that each of the Rights proclaimed to it shall be converted into fact. 
This was one of the main points emphasised by M. Jaime Torres Bodet, 
Director General of Unesco, when he addressed the closing session of the Third 
Annual Summer School ef the World Federation of United Nations Associations, 
at ‘Geneva, on August z 23. Students from 20 nations, who attended the school 
this year, heard lectures principally on the subjects of Food and People—a Unesco 
:neme—and the Rights of Man. 
Speaking on «The role of public opi- 
nion in the achievement of Human 
Rights», M. Torres Bodet said that the 
problem of realizing these Rights was 
also that of Unesco’s own mission. 
Unesco could mot attain its objectives 
if public opinion turned away from it 
or remamed indifferent and Unesco’s 
objectives were practically identical with 
those which the Declaration proclainted. 
«The co-operation of governments is 
‘essentialy, said M. Torres Bodet, «but 
it is not enough. If we wish Human 
Rights to become a reality for everyone, 
the goodwill of governments, on which 
indeed we count, will need the active 
ungrudging ard determined co-operation 
of public opimion. 
«The achieving of the rights is indeed 
the task cof Man, of the man in the 
street. He alone will secure the appli- 
cation of cur Universal Declaration, be- 
cause be is himself its author. 
«The lawgivers who drew it up were 
nct proferring a masterpiece of inspi- 
ration from on high for the admiration 
of the learned. Throughout their work 
they were swept along by public opi- 
nicn. They wrote at its dictation. They 
set down the results of long toil among 
the masses, carried out in obscurity by 
generations of citizens devoted to the 
public weal.

“The Universal Declaration of Human Rights”. 
«If the Universal Declaration repre- 
sents a definite advance on all which 
proceeded ity, said M. Torres Bodet, 
«it is because it bas bad the advantage 
of a process of general evolution more 
rapid and more feverish than in any 
other age. If then this Declaration is 
to-day the supreme expression of our 
wil for peace and justice, the credit 
mwiust go to the men and women of the 
whole werld; the Declaration was born 
of their deepest longings. 
«Let us be franks, said M. Torres 
Bodet, «it is now eight months since 
the Declaration was published. How 
many pectle in each country, how 
meny children in edch school are aware 
of 1? What efforts have been made, 
{ do not say to apply it, but merely 
to make it known?» 
This, said M. Torres Bodet, was the 
tack in the first place of the govern- 
ments that signed it and then of the 
United Nations and their Specialized 
Agencies. Unesco, at least, was fully 
aware of its duty and had made every 
effort to stimulate the dissemination 
and study of the Declaration. 
«Buty, he went on, «these efforts 
will fail in their effect if the great vehi- 
cles of public opinion in each country, 
especially the press, cannot or will not 
play their part too. 
«l have no hesitation in saying that 
the future of this Declaration is like 
the future of Unesco itself. Unesco will 
not fulfsl its purposes without the ac- 
tive assistance of public opinion. Con- 
versely, it will have fulfilled them all 
when public opinion comes unreservedly 
to support it; its future is bound up 
with that of education, culture and 
peace. 
«But as long as it is foreign to the 
majority of mankind, the Universal De- 
claration of Human Rights will remain 
a pious resolution. Once, however, it 
has penetrated the minds and hearts 
cf men, once men have voluntarily ral- 
lied tc it, become fully aware of their 
oun rights, they must necessarily claim 
them, and no force on earth will be 
able to refuse them.»

FIGURES THAT HIT 
N March 19, 1948, the world- 
famous English scientific 
magazine Nature wrote : 
«Already, the International 
Scientific Unions are functioning 
more effectively because of the 
help given to them by Unesco, 
which has contributed during 1947 
and 1948 about half a million dol- 
lars in grants-in-aid to the Unions 
and has been instrumental in the 
formation of a new International 
Union for the Protection of Na- 
ture. 
«The wisdom of using existing 
organizations in this way cannot 
be challenged, and with its fel- 
lowship programme, facilitating 
the interchange of men of science 
and other scholars and its work 
in the reconstruction and rehabi- 
litation of learned institutions, the 
Organization has solid achieve- 
ments to its credit.» 
PROTECTION OF NATURE 
STUDIED BY SEVENTY- 
TWO COUNTRIES 
A PPROXIMATELY 150 dele- 
gates from T2 countries and 20 
international organizations atlten- 
ded the first International Tech- 
nical Conference on the Protec- 
tion df Nature, which met at Lake 
Success from August 22 {0 Sep- 
tember 1. 
This Conference, sponsored by 
Unesco in collaboration with 
the International Union for the 
Protection of Nature, studied va- 
rious problems mainly concerned 
with the effects of «planned-enter- 
prises » on the balance of nature 
and the possible consequences on 
nature’s equilibrium of the gene- 
ralized use of anti-parasitic pro- 
ducts, such as DDT and « antry- 
cide », the remedy for sleeping- 
sickness in cattle. 
In addition, discussions were 
held on interrelated forces in new 
countries of advancing civilization, 
native population and wild fauna, 
as well as problem of vanishing 
wild life. It was anticipated that 
recommendations for action to 
preserve vanishing species of wild 
life would be proposed. 
The Conference was opened by 
Dr. Frank Malina on behalf of 
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director- 
General of Unesco, who sent a 
message of welcome to the dele- 
gates.

T HESE are the facts in figures 
behind this statement by Na- 
ture. 
During 1947, Unesco spent about 
a quarter of a million dollars on . 
‘the purchase and shipment of 
scientific equipment to the war- 
devastated countries of Europe 
and Asia. The equipment, much 
of it purchased from war-surplus 
stores, consisted of workshop sets 
and laboratory apparatus of gene- 
ral utility such as microscopes, 
analytical balances, epidiascopes, 
electrical meters, etc. These goods 
were shipped to the Ministers of 
Education of eight countries for 
distribution to schools and —uni- 
versities. The equipment was sent 
principally to Poland, Greece, Cze- 
choslovakia, China and the Phi- 
lippines. Later in the year, some 
was also sent to Austria, Hungary 
and Italy. 
During 1948, Unesco decided to 
operate a new scheme: credits 
were allocated to various institu- 
tions in the war-damaged coun- 
tries for the purchase of scientific 
equipment, of their own choice, 
through Unesco. The advantage of 
this scheme is that the schools and 
universities were enabled to pur- 
chase what they need most from 
outside sources. 
ciary countries were participating 
in the scheme, namely: China, 
Poland, Greece, Czechoslovakia, 
Philippines, Italy, Hungary, Aus- 
tria, Iran, Indonesia and France. 
Now let us have a look at 
the Unesco transportation grants. 
When Unesco helps 50 scientists to 
go to a general congress or ge- 
neral assembly it does not only 
help the 50 scientists directly re- 
ceiving the grants but all the, say, 
600 scientists taking part in the 
assembly. Furthermore, a scientist 
who has attended the meeting of 
a symposium or of a general con- 
ference will relate his impressions 
to his colleagues on his return to 
his laboratory. 
Sometimes the travel help given 
one scientist might result in tra- 
vel arrangements for many other 
scientists—without any expense 
for Unesco. For instance, Unesco 
helped the Commemorial Meeting 
on the 10th Anniversary of Lord 
Rutherford’s death in Paris with 
Eleven benefi-.

AN INDEX CARD 
STOPPED AN EPIDEMIC

swollen shut by a burning, blinding inflammation. 
Scientists at the famed Pasteur Institute 
AST winter a strange disease paralysed the largest automobile factory 
workmen were off the job, their eyes 
The d isease had 
suspected it was a rare tropical malady known as keredo-conjunctivitis. 
Searching their files for a clue to check the epidemic, they found a small 
white card. This card mentioned a magazine article in an American medical 
journal, issue of January 1943. 
From the article, which because 
of the war they had never seen, the 
French scientists learned that the same 
eye infection had struck te huge 
Kaiser shipyards of California during 
the war. 
Doctors at Columbia Medical 
Center had developed a cure, and 
fully described it in the magazine 
article. ~~ Thus, in less than an 
hour—thanks to the little white 
card—the French scientists had a 
tool to work with. In a few weeks 
they stamped out the epidemic at the 
factory. 
The small white index card 
contained what scientists call an 
abstract. An abstract is a summary 
or short description of a longer article. 
Today a man would have to spend 
his full 40-hour week merely to read 
the titles of the million or so articles 
appearing each year. That is why 
in every field there are periodicals 
devoted to printing abstracts, and 
that is why most scientists make it 
their business to read = through the 
| 
a transportation grant. An emi- 
nent atomic physicist of the U.S.A. 
participated in a Unesco grant. 
Through his contacts and nego- 
tiations with French scientists, a 
scheme for the exchange of assis- 
tants between the U. 8S. A. and 
France was evolved and has been 
put into effect. 
Thanks to Unesco 
UJ NESCO has received letters of 
thanks from a number of 
scientists it has enabled to at- 
tend a congress or a general as- 
sembly. A typical one—from P. 
Dustin, of the University of Brus- 
sels—should be quoted. It reads: 
«Through the generosity of 
Unesco I have had the possibility 
of attending last fortnight the 6th 
International Cytological Congress 
in Stockholm. This meeting was of 
the greatest interest from the two 
points of view of scientific achie- 
vement and intellectual coopera- 
tion. I wish to express to you my 
gratitude for the help that was 
given me. I hope that one day I 
may be in a position myself to help 
the unique effort of Unesco to pro- 
mote international friendship bet- 
ween all scientists.» 
  
abstracts concerning their chosen 
field. 
For example, 16,500 scientists 
subscribe to a monthly bulletin called 
"Chemical Abstracts’. When a 
cheminal engineer—say in Czecho- 
slovakia—scans the pages of this 
bulletin, he learns about some 5,000 
articles appearing in some 4,300 
- pericdicals published in 31 different 
languages. Even if he knew 31 
languages, it is doubtful that he could 
afford to subscribe to all these 
journals, much less find time to read 
them through. Scientists use abstracts 
like detectives use fingerprint—to 
identify and ferret out subjects of 
special interest. 
Abstracting services try to link up 
the various fields of human know- 
ledge; to bridge the gaps of time, 
space and language. For lack of 
abstracts on Japanese science, Dr. 
Anderson—an American who won 
the Nobel Prize in 1937 for work 
on cosmic rays—knew nothing of a 
valuable article on the subject that 
a Dr. Yukawa had published two 
years earlier in Japan. 
Nearly [1,000 organizations 
throughout the world produce science 
abstracts. Yet of all the scientific 
articles appearing each year, fewer 
than half are ever abstracted. Howt 
ever, many are condensed over and 
over again by different abstracting 
services. Of all the sciences, only 
chemistry is fully and systematically 
covered; others—meteorology, stat- 
istics, fisheries, and important 
branches of botany and zoology-—are 
hardly abstracted at all. 
A recent Unesco survey of scien- 
tific articles published in the Middle 
East revealed dozens of journals un- 
known to Western scientists. And 
only a lucky accident brought to a 
Chinese nutritionist’s hand the abstract 
of an article from Jamaica on the use 
of yeast as a food to curb famine. 
To tackle such shortcomings in ‘the 
netwerk of science abstracting, 
Unesco held a world conference 1m 
Paris last month. One hundred and 
forty-seven scientists and librarians 
from 28 countries—speaking 15 
languages—attended. They decided 
that world-wide consulting machinery, 
such as exists among abstracting 
services in the fields of medicine and 
biology, should be set up for the other 
sciences, physics and engineering, 
chemistry, agriculture. 
SCIENCE AND WORLD PROGRESS 
“Science is an effort of mankind to understand the world 
~ and fo apply this understanding in the cause of progress. 
Scientists have traditionally formed a world brotherhood. 
The task of Unesco is to sustain the effort and research of 
these lea 
close the 
rned or scientific circles for the common good, fo 
breach that sometimes is found between the pure 
and the applied sciences and to open the door of science to 
all classes of the people.” 
These words are token from the report fo the United 
Nations, 1948-1949, by the Director-General of Unesco. 
We give on these pages only a few aspects of the highly 
varied activity of the Natural Sciences Department which 
deals with the following fields : Field Science Co-operation, 
Scientific Literature, Scientific Apparatus Information 
Service, Engineering Sciences, Nature Protection, Populari- 
sation of Science and its Social and International Implications.

THE WORLD ~~ SCIENC 
  
SCIENCE LIAISON 
SPANS THE WORLD 
N southern India last October, 
scientists were examining some 
300-year-old paintings on the 
plastered walls of a cave. A bit 
of the white plaster had chipped 
off, revealing the hard granite wall 
underneath. On this rock was 
revealed an earlier picture—painted 
nearly a thousand years ago. How 
to expose it without ruining the 
plaster fresco on top? 
The Indian archeologists asked 
Unesco’s science liaison office for 
South Asia to help. This office, 
located at Delhi, relayed the 
problem to Unesco headquarters 
in Paris, and also to three other 
science liaison offices round the 
world—in Shanghai, Cairo and 
Montevideo. 
A helpful answer came from 
the curator of the Vatican 
museums. His expert had stripped 
some paintings off the Apostolic 
Palaces in Rome, and thought the 
caves of India might be treated the 
same way. He suggested spraying 
the outer fresco with chemicals to 
make the oil paints insoluble; 
spreading on a thick hard layer of 
glue and lint; stripping off the 
plaster, and mounting it on a new 
backing. Then dissolve the glue 
from in front of the plaster fresco, 
and finally, scrape the remains of 
plaster off the granite wall to lay 
bare the long-hidden picture. 
A Mixed Bag 
AST year Unesco’s four science 
offices handled enquiries like 
this from 29 countries. They 
touched on every subject from the 
diseases of camels to higher mathem- 
actics, from synthetic gasoline to 
cross-breeding of cattle. 
Just recently, for instance, the 
Middle East office at Cairo was 
asked to obtain several doses of 
anti-snake-bite serum against the 
horned viper, cerastes cornutus 
— better known as the asp that kil- 
led Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. A 
hospital in Egypt wanted the serum 
to protect its laboratory workers 
while they milked the vipers of 
their venom—from which to 
manufacture their own serum on a 
large scale. Unesco in Paris 
appealed for aid to the Pasteur 
Institute, which flew the doses 
straight to Cairo as a gift.

tion of the joint WHO-Unesco 
Council for the Co-ordination of 
International Congresses of Medi- 
cal Sciences. An article about the 
significance of this Council, en- 
titled “Health Experts Set up 
World Medical Council” appeared 
in the Supplement to the Unesco 
Courier for April 1949 (Volume 
H - N° 3).     
Through Unesco’s Far Eastern 
Office in Shanghai have come 
avocado cuttings from Brazil, sugar 
cane samples from the Philippines, 
and a set of geology journals from 
South Africa, and funds for a 
Chinese scientist to attend a tuber- 
culosis conference in Paris. 
These Unesco science liaison 
offices are not merely funnels for 
piping technical advice into remote 
areas. Instead, they serve as two- 
way channels through which China 
has sent oil-seed plants to Czecho- 
slovakia, wood specimens to Hun- 
gary, and silk-worm eggs to Italy. 
Transatlantic Data

Latin American countries, the 
Unesco science liaison office in

from this area to other parts of the 
world. Bntish ‘East Africa is 
about to start the large-scale cul- 
tivation of sunflowers—a plant 
valuable for food and oil As 
enormous tracts of sunflowers are 
grown in Uruguay and Argentina, 
the East African project asked 
Unesco: What part do bees play 
in pollinating the sunflower seeds? 
The Latin American office was 
akle to return a speedy answer— 
namely, that Uruguayan and Ar- 
gentine farmers find their sun-

flowers do quite nicely with no

CMETIMES, one country’s 
problem 1s ancther country’s 
blessing. Indonesia’s inland water- 
ways were troubled by a fast- 
growing plant—a kind of water 
hyacinth. This weed choked up 
the streams, obstructed navigation 
and discouraged the fish. Unes- 
co's field liaison office helped the 
Indonesians lccate a potent weed- 
killer. Then a new headache 
crecpped up: What do to with the 
enormous bulk of dead and decay- 
ing hyacinth weeds? Meanwhile 
the Unesco office got wind of a 
successful experiment in Western 
Bengal. To revive their barren 
soil and fight famine, Bengalese 
farmers had discovered an excellent 
new fertilizer—dead hyacinth 
weeds! 
Scientists everywhere have 
always shared and pooled their 
growing knowledge. Unesco’s 
liaison offices make it easier for 
Latin America, the Middle East, 
South Asia and the Far East to 
Lenefit from scientific progress— 
and contribute to it as well 
When the United Nations go to 
work on their programme to raise 
living standards in under-privileged 
countries, the Unesco science out- 
posts will serve as ready-made 
‘centres for the increased exchange 
of technical knowledge.   


### 74076: Food and people

“Food 
and People ” 
The application or science in 
everyday life is a key factor in 
modern society. There is no field 
cf diving which has not been 
changed tremendously during the 
past 150 years as a result of this. 
That is why Unesco is interested 
in the. sccial implications of 
science and why, for 1949-50, Unesco 
is stimulating throughout the 
werld, discussions on the vital 
topic of « Food and People». 
MW In consultation with the United 
Naticns Population Division, the 
Food and Agriculture Organization 
and the World Health Organiza- 
tien, Unesco has had 20 Food and 
People articles and essays written 
by 22 authors from 11 countries. 
Their publication is due in French, 
English and Spanish. 
BW In the United Kingdom, four 
pamphlets have been published in 
editions of 45.000 by the Bureau of 
Current Affairs. In the United 
- States, the first two essays have 
been published by Science Service. 
For Latin America, publication in 
Spanish has been undertaken by 
Editorial Sudamericana of Buenos 
Aires, and the Brazilian National 
Institute of Geography and Statis- 
tics is considering publication in 
Portuguese. In Australia, the Com- 
monwealth Office of Education has 
undertaken publication of the first 
iwo essays as a Current Affairs 
Bulletin in an edition of 30.000. 
MB Over one hundred articles on 
the project have appeared in the 
newspaper. and magazines of 17 
countries. Unesco World Review in-

### IGNORE

JALAL i; 
N August 19. 1949, the Govern-- 
O ment of the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg informed Unesco 
of the publication of a decree provi- 
ding for the establishment of a per- 
manent National Commission for 
Unesco. This brings the total number 
of permanent national commissions in 
Unesco’s forty-eight Member States 
to thirty-six. 
What is the purpose of National 
Commissions and why is it important 
that they should be established in 
all the Member States of Unesco? 
The answer is to be found in the 
conviction of the representatives of 
the forty-four nations who attended 
the Conference in London for the 
establishment of Unesco, held in 
November, 1945, that Unesco must not 
become an exclusively governmental 
organization. They believed that if 
Unesco’s purpose — to advance 
« through the educational, scientific 
and cultural relations of the peoples 
of the world, the objectives of interna- 
tional peace and of the common 
welfare of mankind » is to be fulfilled, 
machinery must be provided within 
the Member States for associating 
their peoples with the work of Unesco. 
It was in this spirit that Article VII of 
the Constitution was drawn up. 
Article VII states: 
1. Each Member State shall make 
such arrangements ag suit its 
particular conditions for the pur- 
pose of associating its principal 
bodieg interested in educational, 
scientific and cultural matters 
with the work of the Organization, 
preferably by the formation of 
a Naticnal Commission broadly 
representative of the Government 
and such bodies. 
2. National Commissions or natio- 
nal co-operating bodies, where 
they exist, shall act in. an 
advisory capacity to their respec- 
tive delegations to the General 
Conference and to their Govern- 
ments in matters rélating to the 
Organization and shall function 
as agencies of liaison in all mat- 
ters of interest to it.” 
The citizen's voice 
N ATIONAL Commissions are thus offi- 
cial bodies estabilshed by govern- 
ments and charged with a certain 
measure of legal authority and res- 
ponsibility. The diversity of cultures 
and educational systems, and diffe- 
rences in physical and economic 
conditions is reflected in the member- 
ship, organization, method of appoint- 
ment and degree of authority of their 
National Commissions. The member- 
ship of all National Commissions has 
a proportion — great or small — of 
official representatives of the Govern- 
ment; the {most successful National 
Commissions are those where the 
voice of the private citizen, represen- 
ting the opinion of the organizations 
to which he belongs and of the commu- 
nity from which he comes, is clearly 
and publicly heard. 
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, the Director- 
General of Unesco, who was himself 
a delegate to the London Conference 
in 1945, speaking on 1 April, 1948 
at the Second National Conference of 
the United States National Commission 
-—- oA 
  
Teachers learn about Unesco. Dr. E. Alzona, secretary of the Philippines National 
Commission, explains the working of the Organization to teachers at Rizal City, Republic 
of the Philippines. 
in Clevelond, Ohio, defined a primary 
duty of National Commissions as 
follows: 
Unesco cannot go ahead without 
the support of the great masses 
which make up public opinion... 
The National Commissions must 
clearly understand that one of their 
main functions is to bring Unesco 
into direct contact with the people. 
We, in our work, often need spe- 
cialists, technicians and experts; but 
the greatest fruits of our efforts must 
be enjoyed by the greatest number. 
The man in the street must not 
remain unaware that Unesco exists 
and is thinking of him. His distress, 
his anxieties and his desires are the 
best reasons for cur existence. 
"There should not be a newspaper, 
a university, a college, a primary 
school or an adult organization that 
does not know what Unesco is. 
There are thousands of teachers and 
writers and millions of men and 
women who think as you and I do. 
Why not go out to them through the 
book or the spoken word, the radio 
or the film, the press or television? » 
The task of the Naticnal Commiss- 
ions is two-fold — to carry out the 
international programme adopted by 
the General Conference, composed of 
delegates selected by their Govern- 
ments after consultation with them, 
and to ensure that this international 
programme is capable of international 
application by advising their dele- 
gates in this sense and by developing 
programmes for adoption by the 
General Conference which involve 
the great masses of the people. 
Dr. Milten Eisenhower, the Chair- 
man of the United States National 
Commission, in his address at Cleve- 
land, stressed this urgent need for 
developing projects and project mate- 
rials to make Unesco a people’s 
agency for peace. He underlined the 
point that while the scholarly approach 
to the problems of world peace 
through understanding must be conti- 
nued and accelerated, the high-level 
scholarly attack must be supplemented 
by concrete projects in which the 
peoples in cities and rural areas 
throughout the world, can directly and 
immediately participate. 
National Commissions, if they are 
to carry out their role effectively, must 
achieve a form of organization which

“holding of 
permits high-level specialist activity 
and also action on practical projects 
at the community level. The United 
States National Commission of one 
hundred members, established in 
September, 1946] has gradually deve- 
loped a network of panels of experts 
and organizaticns to which programme 
responsibility is assigned. In addition 
to this vertical decentralization there 
is also horizontal decentralization. The 
regional, national and 
State conferences has stimulated the 
establishment of State and Local 
Councils and Commissions of Unesco. 
The United States Commission has 
thus achieved the greatest degree of 
popular participation reached so far by 
any of Unesco’s thirty-six National 
Commissions. The United Kingdom 
Commission, which has a membership 
nearly three times that of the United 
States Commission, united its nine 
separate elements — the United King- 
‘dom Committee and eight specialist 
Co-operating Bodies — for the first time 
this year, when they met together at

resolutions, later adopted by the 
General Conierence, calling upon 
Member States to assure that their 
National Commissions were provided 
with funds sufficient to enable them 
to establish adequate secretariats, to 
organize meetings and to «accept 
their programme respcnsibilities. 
There is encouraging evidence that 
many National Commissions are not 
only attempting to carry ont projects 
assigned to them in the international 
programme, but are also taking the 
initiative in establishing local pro- 
grammes to further the aims of 
Unesco in their countries. 
Local programmes 
I® Ausiralia, for example, the firat 
National Seminar on Education was 
organized in January, 1949, attended 
by forty-four teachers from all States 
in Australia. [ts purpose was to werk 
out methods and materials to teach 
school children about the United Na- 
tions and the Specialized Agencies. 
Similar seminars and meetings have 
been held in the Philippines and the 
United - Kingdom. New Zealand aiso 
plans to hold a seminar on this subject. 
The Kansas State Commission in the 
iInited States has embarked upon a 
"Community Affiliation Programme” 
for the exchange of people and cul- 
fural materials to develop friendship 
hetween towns in Europe and Kansas. 
The Australian and New Zealand 
National Commissions have developed 
Fellowship Schemes to bring scholars 
and students from Asia and the Poci- 
fic countries to Australia and New 
Zealand lor periods of study and re- 
search. Many ccuntries which have 
had long established feliowship pro- 
arammes have developed new schemes 
to assist war-dvastated areas. 
The need for close and regular con- 
tact between the National Commis- 
sions and the Unesco Secretariat in 
“ The establishment of the National Commis- 
sions, as provided for in our Constitution, is 
an original feature and a great strength of our 
Organization. 
Jaime TORRES BODET 
Church House, Westminster on li 
April. 
Meeting with its advisers on 17 
june, 1949, the Danish Commission deci- 
ded to increase its membership from 
twelve to twenty-four, and to esta- 
blish a small executive committee to 
be responsible for the programme bet- 
ween meetings. 
Commissions reorganize 
N Brazil, which has a Commission (I.B. 
EC.C) of one hundred members 
seventeen State Commissions 
been set up so far. A National Confe- 
rence of these Commissions was held 
in Rio de Janeiro from 24-31 August 
1949, to infcrm the general public 
about the aims and activities of 
Unesco, and to stimulate popular par- 
ticipation. 
Other National Commissions reorga- 
nised this year, or planning establish- 
ment on a more permanent basis, 
include the Austrian, Hungarian, Ita- 
lian, Turkish and South African Com- 
missions. The Indian, Luxembourg and 
Swiss. National Commissions have 
been established during recent months, 
and provisional National Commissions 
exist in Afghanistan, Burma, Sweden 
and Thailand. In Sweden the esta- 
blishment of a provisional National 
Commission of fifteen members has 
preceded the formal acceptance of 
membership of Unesco. National Com- 
missions, like all healthy organizations, 
are thus subject to growth and change. 
It must be admitted, however, that the 
thirty-six commissions listed as estab- 
lished in Member States have not 
all attained that degree of heolth and 
vitality which permits them to play an 
effective part in the work of Unesco. 
Some, in fact exist only on paper, 
and have not been provided with the 
means of translating their official de- 
crees into action. It was for this rea- 
son that the Meéting of Representa- 
tives of National Commissions, held at

Paris led the Third Session of the Ge- 
neral Conference (Beirut, November- 
December, 1948) to recommend that 
the Director-General and other senior 
members of Unésco should visit Mem- 
ber States and National Commissions. 
The Conference also called for an 
extensicn of the plan to enable secre- 
taries of Commissions to visit Unesco 
House in Paris. During the course of 
1949, therefore, Dr. Torres Bodet has 
attended meetings of the National 
Commissions of France, (22 January) 
Belgium (21 February), United States 
(30 March-2 April), United Kingdcem 
(11 April), and Denmark (17 June} 
Dr. Kuo Yu-Shou attended the first 
meeting of the Indian National Com- 
mission (9-10 April) and that of the 
Philippines National Commission (7 
June). Two Unesco representatives have 
also been sent on liaison missions tn 
Brazil and Turkey. 
Unesco’s *¢ roots’ 
T the same time the secretaries of the 
Hungarian, Norwegian, and New 
Zealand National Commissions and the 
Vice-President of the Colombian Natio- 
nal Commission visited Unesco House 
and representatives of the Indian, Mexi- 
can, South African and Swiss Com- 
missions will arrive shortly. Other Go- 
vernments which have indicated their 
acceptance of similar invitations are 
the Argentine, Austrian and Polish 
Governments. The purpose of these 
visits is to enable representatives of 
the Commissions to study the work of 
the Secretariat and to make personal 
contacts with senior members of the 
Organization. 
Measures such as these will be 
developed on an increasing scale for

tional Ccmmissions would be, as the 
Polish Delegate to the Mexican City

Supplement 
  
UNESCO COURIER 
THE FOURTH SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE 
OF UNESCO WILL BE HELD IN PARIS 
  
  
ORGANIZATION OF WORK 
OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE 
HE Executive Board has allotted two days for 
discussion of the Director-General's report by the 
General Conference. A limit of fifteen minutes 
is recommended for speeches on the report. This 
would allow about forty speakers to take part in the 
discussion. 
The remaining work of the Fourth Session may be 
sub-divided as follows: 
PLENARY MEETINGS : These should be concerned 
with the organization of the Conference, with the 
adoption of decisions regarding Unesco’s general 
policy (particularly in the discussion of the Director- 
General's report and the reports of Member States, and 
in the discussion of a general theme) and with the 
decisions based on the work of Commissions and the 
recommendations of the Executive Board. Provision 
has been made for 16 plenary meetings. 
COMMISSIONS AND SUB - COMMISSIONS: The 
Board has recommended the establishment of three 
main commissions on which all member states should 
be represgnted: Programme and Budget Commission 
(with 14 eduled meetings), Administrative Commis- 
sion (willl eight meetings), and Official and External 
‘Relations Fommission (with seven meetings).

 ¢ E fourth session of Unesco’s General 
f hr opens at the Organiza- 
tion's headquarters in Paris on Sep- 
tember 19th and is scheduled to last until 
October 5th. 
The Conference, which is the supreme 
ruling body of Unesco, will, this vear, chiefly 
be concerned with the administrative aspects 
of the programme rather than with the formu- 
lation of new ideas and fresh projects. A 
number of new schemes will, however, be 
presented to the delegates. The decision to 
give the meeting this character was taken at 
last year’s session in Beirut, Lebanon, when the 
delegates approved a long-term work plan for 
the organization, which will not require re-zxa- 
mination o: :Jditions every year. 
It is expected that some three hundred de- 
legates will attend the Conference for which 
invitations have been sent to the 48 member 
states of Unesco, to the members of the United 
Nations and of the Specialized Agencies which 
are not members df Unesco as well as to the 
U.N., the Specialized Agencies, international 
and national organizations. . 
Among the main questions on the agenda 
are an Extraordinary Programme and Budget 
Estimates for tachnical assistance to under-   
   
 
   
    
   
  
developed countries, a draft code of policies 
and modifications to Unesco’s ordinary pro- 
gramme, and a public discussion on the cultu- 
ral duties of the State. - 
Ihe Conference will also discuss the 
tor-General’s report on Unesco’s activi 
1949 and the Budget for the next 
cial year as well as electing six new mem- 
rs to the Executive Board. 
Technical Aid Programme 
 
NESCO’s plan for an extended program- 
me of technical assistance to under- 
developed areas is outlined in a special 
report by the Director General. In it he says 
that the object of Unesco in entering into the 
United Nations plan will be to furnish to eco- 
nomically under-developed countries, tern- 
tories or areas, at their request, such advice, 
technical skill, training facilities, study groups, 
pilot projects and other help, as may fall 
within Unesco’s sphere. 
The plan of the Secretary General of the 
United Nations, says the report, is one for 
Technical Assistance for Economic Develog- 
ment. Economic development is, therefore, 
the end, and technical assistance the means. 
The proposals laid by Unesco before the 
Conference are only concerned with these 
means. Such assistance, at the present time and 
in the light of the relevant resolutions, does 
not imply direct financial assistance. The 
scheme envisages financing by means of volun- 
tary contributons by donor Governments. 
(For more details see page 3.) 
  
Code of Policies and Budget 
| HE major original feature of the new pro- 
y T gramme of Unesco is the inclusion of a 
code of eighteen directives designed to 
tay down the principles governing the organi- 
zation’s practical activities (See page 16.) 
' These directives were amended and approved 
by the Executive Board at its June session. 
19th Soptemben — 4th October 1949 
- 
- 
They define the chief aims and general policy 
to be followed in planning and implementing 
the programme of the Organization. 
In addition, certain amendments to the 
ordinary programme will be submitted to the 
Conference for approval. They are either 
deletions of resolutions on which action will 
be completed in 1949 or changes in programme 
emphasis or orientation which experience has 
shown to be expedient for the better imple- 
mentation of Unesco’s programme. 
The 1950 Budget which the Director Ge- 
neral is submitting to the Conference totals 
$8,847,000, being an increase of $1,067,000 
over last year’s budget. The budget increase 
relates solely to programme activities and, in 
consequence, there is an appreciable reduction 
in the proportion of administrative expenses. 
General Debate 
 
GENERAL debate on what every nation 
A can and should do to ensure a better 
understanding between peoples will take 
place during the Conference, and the final 
- details will be worked out by the General 
Committee, 
The theme chosen is “What are the duties 
of the State in regard to education, science 
and culture forthe purpose of ensuring a bet- 
ter understanding betwsen peoples, and what 
practical steps should be taken in order to 
discharge these duties?” 
The debate will be held in a large Parisian 
hall, La Maison de la Chimie, and the three 
evenings of September 27, 28 and 29 have 
been set aside for it so that Conference dele- 
gates, Intellectual groups, student organiza- 
tions and the general public may hear distin- 
guished speakers discuss the subject. The 
names of the speakers have not yet been an- 
nounced. Ths discussions will be broadcast 
by the Radiodiffusion Francaise and interna- 
tional radio hookups will make the program- 
mes available to listeners in other parts of the 
world. : 
This Supplement includes summaries of {wo 
separale reports by the Dircctor-General on the 
work of Unesco in connection with Inierna- 
tional Wiork Camps and Children’s Communi- 
ties, from their inception lo the present fime. 
It also deals with Unesco’s practical efforts to 
facilitate the free movement of educational, 
scientific arid cultural material and the inler- 
national circulation of publications. 
  A REMINDER 
«The General Conference in- 
structs the Director-General to 
negotiate with Member States and 
National Commissions in order to 
develop plans for wider circulation 
of the Courier; such plans should 
include proposals for facilitating 
the reproduction of the Courier 
by Member States or National 
Commissions, either in the present 
working languages or in transla- 
tions provided by them.»

General Conference of Unesco at

_— 
A MEETING OF THE UNESCO ASSOCIATION WITH JAPANESE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION AND FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS, IN TOKYO. A JAPANESE PUBLICATION GIVING "UNESCO WORLD NEWS". 
INCE the beginning of 1949 Unesco 
has been going steadily ahead with the 
work of extending certain of its pro- 
gramme activities to Germany and Japan, 
within the limits indicated by the 
General Conference at Beirut, last Decem- 
ber. 
Based on the results of surveys and expe- 
riments carried out during 1948, the confe- 
rence decisions enabled Unesco to put into 
action those projects which appeared to be 
most suitable for the two countries. 
The first task was to establish effective and 
regular working relations with the Allied 
authorities and interested individuals and 
groups in both countries. For this purpose, 
three offices, which are also to act as Unesco 
Information Offices, were opened at Mainz, 
Stuttgart and Dusseldorf in the Western Zone 
of Germany, under the direction of Dr. 
J.W.R. Thompson. 
Unesco’s work is, in fact, still confined fo 
Western Germany despite attempts, made as 
long ago as 1947 and again in 1948, to 
obtain authorization for its extension to the 
Eastern Zone. On June 29, 1949, however, 
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of 
Unesco, made a new request for this autho- 
rization in a letter he addressed to the Mili- 
tary Governor of the USSR. Zone of Oc- 
cupation. 
As one of the first steps in its 1949 pro- 
gramme for Germany, Unesco undertook the 
wide distribution of its publications and 
documents in order to make its aims and 
achievements known to German individuals, 
cultural groups, libraries, universities, news- 
papers, educational and cultural journals. 
Exchange of publications 
T HE programme already carried out has 
also included assistance in exchanging 
publications between German institutions 
and those of Unesco Member States, a

study of text books in connection with the 
project for the world-wide revision of text 
books and teaching materials, the translation 
into German of several Unesco publica- 
tions, the invitation of German specialists to 
conferences called by Unesco and a survey 
of the opportunities which exist for the ex- 
change of persons between Germany and 
other countries. 
In May, a committee of experts set up by 
M. Torres Bodet, to advise him on questions 
concerning present and future Unesco acti- 
vities in Germany, held its first meeting in 
Paris. 
After reviewing the work already carried 
out, this committee formulated a series of 
recommendations for future Unesco action in 
14 
Germany, calling for Unesco fellowship 
opportunities for Germans to study abroad, 
the extension of Unesco’s Book Coupon 
Scheme to Germany, participation of Ger- 
man scholars and teachers in text book revi- 
sion programmes and the active participa- 
tion of German individuals and institutions 
in Unesco’s work in their country. These 
recommendations for the expansion of 
Unesco’s programme in Germany during 
1950 were submitted to Unesco’s Executive 
Board last june. 
The experts committee held ‘a second 
meeting at the end of August and made sup- 
plementary recommendations which will be 
considered in the formulation of a pro- 
gramme for Unesco’s activities in Germany 
during 1950. The final decision on this pro- 
gramme will rest with Unesco’s General 
Conference which opens in Paris on Septem- 
ber 19. ‘ 
In the case of Unesco’s work in Japan, 
responsibility for providing liaison with the 
occupatior authorities and implementing 
the General Conference resolutions was 
entrusted to Professor Lee Shi-Mou, who 
arrived in Japan last April. 
REP TE 
~~ Unesco in Japan - 
NESCO’S aims and activities in Japan 
are similar to those for Germany and in 
the development of the work Unesco has had 
full support from the allied authorities and 
from Japanese organizations. 
One of these, the National Association of 
Student Clubs for Unesco, has a membership 
of about 10,000 and the other, the Federa- 
tion of Co-operative Associations of Unesco, 
whose membership numbers about 200.000, 
has active committees established in most 
important centres. 
On the initiative and at the expense of 
the allied authorities, the appropriate Japa- 
nese Ministries and private organizations, 
some twenty Unesco publications have al- 
ready been printed in English and Japanese. 
In addition, a large number of tracts pro- 
duced in Japan to publicize Unesco have 
been issued in Japanese and widely cir- 
culated. 
Unesco is therefore already well-known in 
Japan and the Japanese official agencies, 
particularly the Ministry of Education, are 
keenly interested in its work. In 1948, for 
example, the Ministry of Education set aside 
30.000 yen for work associated with Unesco 
and in 1949, this was increased to 6,000,000 
yen, or approximately $12,000.

On May 19th, a fresh impetus was given 
to Unesco’s work in Japan by the holding of 
the first National Conference on Unesco 
which was attended by 2,000 delegates. 
As in the case of Germany, a Commitee 
of Experts was set up to advise M. Torres 
Bodet on the execution of the programme 
approved by the General Conference for 
Japan. This committee met in Tokyo last 
May and again last month and its recommen- 
dations will be given full consideration in the 
development of Unesco’s programme in Ja- 
pan in 1950. 
An indication of the extent to which 
Unesco hopes to step-up its work in both 
countries during 1950 is shown by the bud- 
getary estimates to cover the proposed acti- 
vities, which are to be submitted to the Ge- 
neral Conference. These represent an 
increase of some $60,000 over those of 
1949. 
"EXECUTIVE BOARD'S MEETING 
EFORE the opening of the 
Conference, the Execu- 
tive Board will meet or’ Sep- 
tember 15th to discuss a num- 
ber of points for presentation 
to the delegates, among them 
the Director General's annual 
report, proposed Unesco acti- 
vities in Germany and Japon 
and the plan of technical as- 
sistance. 
Towards the end of the 
Conference, the delegates will 
have to elect for a term of 
three years six new members 
of the Board in place of those 
whose term of office will then 
be at an end. The latter are : 
Dr Parra Perez (Venezuela), 
M. Roger Seydoux (France), 
Professor Paulo Carneiro 
(Brazil), M. R. Guntekin 
(Turkey), Professor Alf Som- 
merfelt (Norway), and Pro- 
fessor R. Stoddard (U.S.A.). 
These members are, however, 
re-eligible. 
It must be noted that mem- 
bers of the Executive Board 
of Unesco do not sit as repre- 
sentatives of their countries 
but are selected for their 
competence in fields of inter- 
est to Unesco, and care is 
always taken to see that the 
chief cultural areas of the 
world are represented among 
them. 
Finally, the delegates will 
have to decide on the venue 
of the next session of the Con- 
ference. In future this will be 
held in the spring of each 
year, at the request of the 
United Nations, in order to 
avoid overlapping the meet- 
ing of the U. N. General 
Assembly.

### 74081: UNESCO Director-General presents budget estimates: million dollar increase requested

UNESCO DIRECTOR-GENERAL 
presents budget estimates: 
million dollar increase 
requested 
res Bodet’s Budget Estimates for 
Unesco’s work in 1950, totalling 
$8,847,000, have been transmitted 
to the Organization's 48 Member 
States. They will be officially placed 
before the Fourth Session of Unesco’s 
General Conference, which opens in 
Paris on September 19. . . 
The Estimates, representing an 1n- 
crease of about one million dollars 
over the 1949 financial period, are de- 
signed to cover all phases of Unesco’s 
co-ordinated effort to organize inter- 
D IRECTCR-GENERAL Jaime Tor- 
national intellectual co-operation on 
behalf of peace and culture. They 
therefore provide for such varied pro- 
jects as — to mention only a few — 
the cperation of scientific liaison cen- 
tras on four continents, a world clear- 
ing-house for information on educa- 
tional practices and materials, “ fun- 
damental” education on an experi- 
mental basis in Haiti, the promotion 
of adequate translations of Great 
Books, the establishment of an Inter- 
national Music Council, and the dis- 
tribution of a free cultural “ feature” 
service for newspapers throughout the 
world. 
In the words of Sir Sarvepalli Rad- 
hakrishnan of India who, as chair- 
man of Unesco’s Executive Board, will 
officially present the Director-Gene- 
ral’s Budget Estiraates to the General 
conference, “the funds proposed in 
this document remain at a moderate 
scale in relation to the world’s needs 
in education, science and culture”. 
This disproportion between needs 
and rescurces is underscored by the 
Director-General himself, in his Intro- 
duction to the present volume of esti- 
mates. Admitting that the peoples of 
the world expect from Unesco results 
which it cannot honestly hope to 
achieve with the limited resources at 
its disposal, Dr. Torres Bodet points 
out that a major contribution, in his 
view, far more important than finan- 
cial contributions, is hoped for from 
National Commissions and Co-opera- 
ting Bodies. : 
“They can and must make such 
contributions when they have achieved 
a degree of cffectiveness which, it must 
bz admitted, has not yet been attained 
by all. Nevertheless, the work of the 
Secretariat which I do not regard in 
any way as separate and independent, 
is essential, and it too requires to be 
strengthened and extended”. 
This strengthening of the Secreta- 
riat, as proposed by Dr. Torres Bodet. 
cannot be viewed as a mere matter of 
adding personnel to the staff at 
Unesco’s Paris headquarters. Unesco’s 
position at the heart of a world-wide 
movement of cultural co-operation 
allows exper:s in the Secretariat to act 
as - levers, displacing much greater 
weights than their own. 
“By their very nature”, says the Di- 
rector-General, “the progress of (our) 
activities does not invoive proportio- 
nate increases in equipment and staff. 
We make no land purchases for the 
building of schools; wz are not buil- 
ders of University C.ties, nor publishers 
either of school books or encyclopae- 
dias. The best services we can render 
take the form of investigations, mis- 
sions, information, advice and sugg:s- 
tions, and these are all services re- 
quiring qualified staff”. 
It is in this spirit that Dr. Torres 
Bodet explains the increase of 
$1,067,000 which the proposed 1950 
Pudget shows over that of 1949. The 
largest increase in 1950 is in the ap- 
propriations asked for under the 
chapter of Education. Citing a typical 
example, the Director-General says : 
“It has been proved that educational 
missions can render great services to 
the Member States, but only on condi- 
ton that they are endowed with ade- 
quate staff... The mere presence in 
a Member State of one or more techni- 
cians, who can carefully study the 
conciusions reached by a mission, may 
suffica to convert work half done into 
a successful achievement”. And, spea- 
king of Fundamental Education, Dr. 
Torres Bodet again draws attention to 
the fact that the requested appropria- 
tions will serve primarily to set in mo- 
tion a multiplying process throughout 
the world. 
“In the present disorganized siate of 
fundamental education the world over, 
one of the most useful steps which 
Unzsco can take is to create a centre 
of training and production which can 
provide students and specialists with 
intensive and speedier training, while 
at the same time ensuring the output 
of teaching material. If I am propo- 
sing by way of experiment to establish 
such a centre in ene area only — to be 
selected by the Conference — it is be- 
cause I am sure that success in this en- 
terprise will lead in the next few years 
to the establishment of similar centres 
in other areas’. 
Answering anticipated objections to 
the effect that the increased Budget 
for 1950 might delay the accession to 
Unesco of States not yet members, Dr. 
Torres Bodet points out that he is 
anxious to avoid anything which might 
adversely affect the Organization's 
universal nature. And here he makes 
an observation which gives life to 
what might otherwise have been a vo- 
lume of lifeless figures:- 
“Perhaps”, writes the Director-Gene- 
ral, “the extent of the financial contri- 
bution asked for does not explain why 
certain States have not yet ratified our 
Constitution. What will militate in 
Unesco’s favour will be the services it 
is in a position to render, and it is to 
secure better results that I ask for 
increased resources. For Unesco’s pro. 
gramme to achieve signifiance in the 
eyes of the world, it must bs: more 
than a promise”. 
There follows a summary of the Di- 
rector-General’s statement on other 
programme activities: 
RECONSTRUCTION. 
  
PART from its emergency relief 
programme, the most useful help 
that Unesco can give to Recon- 
struction is in encouraging campaigns 
for collecting money. The appropria- 
tions of the Reconstruction Depart- 
ment have, therefore, been increased 
to allow it to take a still larger share 
in the campaigns to be launched in 
North America. 
EDUCATION. - 
  
DUCATIONAL seminars, the Direc- 
tor-Gzneral states, have proved 
themselves one of the best ways 
of getting the latest techniques known 
and applied over large areas of the 
world. In order, however, to bear its 
full fruit, a seminar must be looked 
upon as an opportunity for producing 
good teaching material. For that, 
experience has shown, seminars must 
be furnished with more teaching and 
administrative personnel and the work 
they do must be carried farther in the 
countries which are represented at 
them. If Unesco contemplates a long- 
term programme of seminars, these 
measures are the indispensable mini- 
mum. 
Further. Unesco has had to increase 
its share in the pilot project in Haiti, 
to undertake new preliminary surveys 
in certain specified areas and to. 
develop the already important publica- 
tions programme of the Fundamental 
Education Clearing House. The grea- 
ter part, however, of the new appro- 
priations asked for under Fundamental 
Education are intended for a specia- 
lists’ training centre and for the pro- 
duction of fundamental education ma- 
rial. 
NATURAL SCIENCES. 
 
S regards the Natural Sciences 
programme, regular work conti- 
nues. In order to prepare for the 
establishment of an International In- 
ctitute of the Arid Zones, Unesco must 
have sufficient funds to cover meetings 
of experts and studies which are ne- 
cessary for the completion of this pre- 
liminary phase. 
Unesco must also have funds for the 
task, undertaken jointly with the 
World Health Organization, of crea- 
ting a Council of Medical Sciences, to 
ensure the success of the International

A GROWING COMPANY : 
Union for the Protection of Nature, 
sponsored by Unesco, and to help the 
first International Congress of Mathe- 
maticians to be organized since the 
war. 
After an impartial examination of 
the work and role of field science co- 
operation offices, it has become appa- 
rent that their staffs should be in- 
creased by recruiting eminent scientists 
from the regions concerned to carry 
out liaison work with the local scien- 
tific institutions and associations. 
SOCIAL SCIENCES. 
EQUESTS for funds for 1950 for 
R the Social Sciences also show a 
marked increase. The reason for 
this is that certain projects already 
begun, which are of considerable 
importance to Unesco’s programme, 
must be completed. If funds were not 
available there would be detrimental 
delay in the application of the pro- 
gramme, and part of the ground gained 
in preceding years would be lost. 
It is Unesco’s duty to show its inte- 
rest in a whole series of activities of 
urgent importance to the construction 
of the defences of peace in the minds 
of men. Thus, Unesco contributes 
decisively towards the formation of as- 
sociations in the field of social scien- 
ces. It is obvious that Unesco must 
support these groups which are further 
new instruments of international col- 
 
“laboration and which ensure for the 
Organization the effective and conti- 
nuing assistance of specialists in such 
branches as sociology, comparative 
law, political economy and social psy- 
chology. 
By organizing meetings and initia- 
ting studies, surveys and observation 
missions, Unesco also encourages social 
science specialists to take an interest 
in the machinery of international ac- 
tion and to study means whereby its 
operation can be perfected. 
CULTURAL ACTIVITES. 
 
HE budget of Cultural Activities 
also reflects the proposed work in 
hand. In the field ol Arts, pro- 
gress in carrying out the programme 
has resulted in the signing of a 
contract with the International 
Council of Music, which will undertake 
important work on behalf of the Orga- 
nization, and in the proposed creation 
of a Fine Arts Review. In the field 
of libraries, in view of the extension of 
the Libraries programme, it is felt that 
the Organization should provide for a 
study course and a pilot project in 
 
 
  
Name plates of Member States being checked for use at 
the General Conference. : : 
EXCHANGE OF PERSONS. 
HE Director-General’s report on 
T the budget also underlines the 
success of Unesco’s Exchange of 
Persons programme. But much still 
remains to be done to ensure that Go- 
vernments, in preparing their fellow- 
ship programmes, take into account 
similar programmes in other countries. 
In this connection, Unesco must 
confine its attention to centralizing 
and disseminating information. 
Further, it is essential that Unesco 
should co-operate with the Internatio- 
nal Labour Organization in giving 
further attention to workers’ education 
and the exchange of workers for edu- 
cational purposes. Additional appro- 
priations are needed for these two ac- 
tivities. 
The Director-General also expresses 
his conviction that it is necessary not 
only to increase the number of Unesco 
fellowships, but to see that they make 
a definite contribution to the fulfil- 
ment of the Organization’s programme. 
TECHNICAL NEEDS. co 
F OR several years Unesco has car- 
ried out surveys of technical needs 
in radio, press and film, and has 
thus built a large volume of documen- 
tary material which, as 1949 draws to 
a close, will cover a considerable area 
of the world. 
It is therefore natural that in 1950 
the Organization should adopt for 
technical needs a policy which has 
already proved successful in education, 
namely, the sending of missions. Two 
missions will be organized in 1950, one 
for school broadcasts and the other for 
educational films. In addition, a re- 
gional seminar on school broadcasts 
will provide an opportunity for those 
countries in need of assistance and 
advice, to make contact with others, 
which have already made considerable 
progress in this field. 
LIAISON WITH MEMBER STATES. 
LTHOUGH, on the whole, the 
funds required are not very sub- 
stantial, there is ample evidence 
of the Secretariat's efforts to stimulate 
and direct the work of Member States, 
National Commissions and co-opera- 
ting bodies towards the implementa- 
tion of the Unesco programme. 
The programme for the development 
of National Commissions, howevér, 
calls for measures other than the ex- 
changes of administrative correspon- 
dence. The report outlines the extra 
funds necessary for the activities of 
the Bureau of External Relations, 
whose services have to be extended, for 
Unesco’'s Liaison Office in New York 
and for a better presentation and a 
wider dissemination of Unesco do- 
cuments and publications. 
- EXECUTIVE BOARD’S COMMENT. 
N its report to the General Confe- 
rence on the Director-General’s 
draft budget for 1950, the Executive 
Board states its conviction that the 
funds asked for remain at a moderate 
scale in relation to the world’s needs 
in education, science and culture, and 
believes the Conference should adopt 
it. 
_ The Board notes that the increase 
in the budget is allocated almost enti- 
rely to programme items. while the 
sums allocated to the units underta- 
king the central direction and admi- 
nistration of Unesco remain essen- 
tially the same and, in proportion 
to the total budget, they are reduced. 
_ Finally, the Executive Board recalls 
its previously expressed view that the 
programme should not be basically 
changed at the forthcoming confe- 
rence and expresses the hope that the 
Conference will concur in this view 
and that it will not increase the num- 
ber of activities of the Organization 
beyond those presented to the Confe- 
rence. .

In his first annual Report to

THE REPORT 
N the opening words of his Report, the Di- 
I rector-General draws attention to the excep- 
tional difficulties encountered during the 
period under review. 
“By advancing its next Session to the ninth 
month of the year”, he writes, “the General 
Conference imposed on the Secretariat, and 
indeed on the whole Organization, a particu- 
larly exacting timetable. In order to allow 
sufficient time for the documents to be comple- 
ted and despatched to Member States, the 
Committees of the Executive Board had before 
them, in the second half of May, the various 
questions to be submitted to the General Confe- 
rencz, and the draft Budget for 1950. 
“This preparation for the following year 
absorbed a considerable proportion of the time 
and energy of the higher ranks of the Secretariat 
at a moment when they should have bizcn devo- 
ting themselves wholly to the execution of the 
Programme. The work was also undertaken 
much too early for it fo be based on adequate 
experience derived from the carrying out of the 
current programme.”

in spite of his efforts to avoid any break In 
continuity. It was to avoid excessive distur- 
bance of the existing machinery, which would 
have had disastrous consquences at a time when 
work was so heavy, that he decided not to 
embark this year on a radical revision of the 
structure of the Secretariat. 
Apart from the severe time limit imposed 
upon it, the Organization found itself faced 
early this year with an additional task of the 
first importance which had not been contempla- 
ted by the General Conference at its Third 
S:ssion. This was Unesco’s participation in

cally under-developed countries which resulted 
from the Economic and Social Council’s Reso- 
lution of March 4. The new proposal involved 
not only the holding of an extraordinary session 
of the Executive Board (March 24-25) but 
also the despatch to Lake Success of two senior 
officials — Dr. Be:=by, Assistant Director- 
General in charge of Education, and M. Auger, 
Head of the Natural Sciences Department — 
who were absent from their normal duties for 
six wzeks. Meanwhile the Diector-General, 
with the help of a group of five members of the 
Executive Board, began to lay the foundations 
of Unesco’s contribution to the Plan. 
. “This question”, writes Dr. Torres Bodet, 
vill, in fact, be one of those to which we 
have had to pay most attention. It has 
also materially altered the nature of the 
Fourth Session of the General Conference, 
which was to have been a “short business 
session. Discussion of the Technical 
Assistance Plan has involved an extension 
of the Session by three days, and decisions 
on the subject will be of greatest impor- 
tance in connexion not only with that ques- 
tion itself but with the development of our 
cooperation with the United Nations and 
other Specialized Agencies’. 
A Two-Year Programme 
T was clear to the Director-General and to 
| the Executive Board that a “short business 
session’ of the General Conference could not 
und:rtake any radical revision of the programme 
adopted at Beirut, and the addition of Tech- 
nical Assistance to the agenda of the Confe- 
rence did not invalidate this conclusion. This 
meant that the .scheme adopted at Beirut must 
be regarded as a two-year programme — a 
circumstance that offered a welcome opportunity 
to bring about greater concentration in the work 
of Unesco. 
Accordingly, the Director-General selected 
from the “very large and widely ranging” two- 
years programme a number of permanent activi- 
ties or fixed projects which would have a prior 
claim this year. It was not intended to reduce 
the programm: decided on by the General 
Conference, but to establish an order of urgency 
in the matter of its execution. The various 
projects were therefore divided into three 
classes : 
. (1) Projects involving a special effort in 
1949; 
(2) Projects on which normal work should 
be carried out in 1949; 
(3) Projects whose execution could be de- 
ferred until 1950. 
In adopting “this classification the Director- 
General had the following criteria in mind : 
(a) Practical value as regards raising the 
standard of living of the ordinary people; 
(b) Likelihood of securing the corporation 
of leading intellectuals and professional people 
in the Secretariat’s work; 
(c) Likelihood of achieving tangible results 
fairly quickly. 
) “Surprise may be expressed’, he writes, 
“that these criteria do not include peace 
or international understanding. It goes 
without saying, however, that all Unesco’s 
activities are directed towards peace and 
international understanding. The ques- 
tion to decide is what of project contri- 
butes most to that end. It seems to me 
that the best type is that which does some- 
thing for man rather than merely discussing

other hand, to the execution of a

Unesco will, if necessary, assist in 
the establishment, the development 
and the co-ordination of internatio-

activities are in conformity with 
its own. 
Unesco will seek to utilize, through 
the National Commissions of Mem-

tely on this page. An outstanding result of 
the Secretariat’s work, he notes, has been a 
considerable increasz in the number of Unesco 
publications. The number of works and pam- 
phlets issued during the first half of 1949 was 
47, as compared with 48 for the whole of the 
previous year and 46 for 1947. Some of 
them were published in several languages other 
than the working languages. As for period: 
cals, which amounted to seven in 1947 and 
nine in 1948, these have now reached the num- 
ber of fourteen. 
In a section devoted to the distribution of the 
Budget and the proportion of administrative to 
executive personnel, the Director-General makes 
it clear that although the total Budget shows a 
small increase over that of the previous year, 
the purely administrative expenditure proposed 
for 1950 represents only 10.5 per cent of the 
whole draft Budget, as compared with 12.3 per 
cent in 1949. At the same time, the propor- 
tion of purely administrative staff to total staff, 
which was 27.1 per cent in 1949, 1s only 25 
per cent under his proposals for 1950. “I am

activity for the raising of standards

peo- the energies now devoted to recon- concern will be to serve the cause 
spect struction. of peace to which it is dedicated.   
The World Outside 
URNING from the internal organization of 
Unesco to its relations with the world 
outside, the Director-General insists on 
the importance of close and active cooperation 
with the Governments of Member States and 
with all the other organizations, both official 
and unofficial, which are animated by the same 
ideals as Unesco and are striving to achieve 
comparable aims. He writes : 
‘The work of the Secretariat represents 
only one part of the Organization's activities, 
and, moreover, that work cannot and must not 
be conceived as an independent activity. The 
real influence of the Organization's activities is 
in fact attributable less to its own resources than 
to its ability to coordinate the energies of the 
world in carrying out tits purposes.” 
From this point of view, the Director-General 
considers that Unesco’s overall success depends 
on a four-fold system of contacts linking the 
Secretariat with the machinery on which its effi- 
ciency depends. These are its contacts with : 
(1) the Governments of Member States; 
(2) National Commissions: 
(3) the United Nations and the Specialized 
Agencies; 
(4) international non-governmental organiza- 
tions. 
Part III of the Report (Official and Exter- 
nal Relations) gives a detailed account of re- 
cent d:velopments on these lines, including 
the accession to Unesco membership, since the 
last session of the General Conference, of four 
new States — Thailand, Switzerland, Burma 
and the Principality of Monaco. All of these 
States have completed the formalities necessary 
for their membership to becom: effective, and 
several others have announced their intention of 
becoming members. 
National Delegates in Paris 
LIST of the Member States which have 
d:legations in Paris, together with the 
names of their chief delegates and their 
deputies, on July 1, 1949, is given in the Report 
(Part III, page 3). The Director-General 
expresses his appreciation of the help given by 
the national delegates to Unesco in its work, but 
in the preamble to his Report he notes that 
ccozeration between Unesco and the Govern- 
ments of Member States needs to be strengthe- 
ned : 
In th: case of the National Commissions, 
also, the Director-General has to report that 
“there 1s a time-lag in the development of these 
essential bodies in comparison with the Secreta- 
rat. This is a situation which I can most 
readily understand but, unless it is corrected, it 
will endanger the balance of the Organization 
and jeopardize both the efficiency and the uni- 
versal significance of our work ”’. 
The Machine and the Multitude 
CONSTANT preoccupation runs like a Leit- 
moliv through the Report : the Director- 
General's sense of the social and popular 
value of Unesco’s work. He shows an anxious 
desire to avoid building an administrative wall 
between the machine ang the multitude. Thus, 
in the whole Report he announces only three new 
appointments by name, and all of them contri- 
bute to this end. They are those of Mr. Dou- 
glas Schneider (U.S.A.) to be Head of the 
Department of Mass Communications, Mr. A. 
Ramos (Brazil) to be Head of the Department 
of Natural Sciences, and Mr. Carlo a Prato 
(Italy) to be Head of the Department of Public 
Information. 
We may be allowed to conclude with a quo- 
tation from the Director-General’s report on the 
work of this last Department, to which the 
Courier belongs: 
“The Bureau of Public Information, 
which is responsible for informing the pu- 
blic about Unesco’s aims and work, has 
continued to improve its machinery... 
Besides the Press and the wireless, the Bu- 
reau has its own special organs. First and 
foremost we must mention the Courier, 
which aims at giving a full and vivid pic- 
ture of our activities every month... 
“With the limited means at its disposal, 
which if endeavours to utilize more effectively 
by improving ils contacts and adapting what it 
produces to the needs of the public, the Bureau 
of Public Information is helping to introduce 
Unesco to people who have hitherto been in- 
adequately informed about it.” Until las; April 
there was no official Head of the Bureau. The 
appointment of M. Carlo a Prato should lead 
‘to fresh progress on both the productive and the 
publicity side of the work.”

### 74085: Free movement of persons and educational, scientific and cultural material

UNESCO COURIER 
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND OF 
EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIAL 
NESCO has drawn the atten- 
tion of its Member States to 
a recommendation passed by 
the General Conference in 
Beirut that they examine 
existing national regulations and 
practices governing the importation 
and purchase of educational, scienti- 
fic and cultural materials, in order to 
introduce or extend especially favou- 
rable treatment to such material. A 
memorandum was also sent on Eco- 
nomic Obstacles and Privileges per- 
taining to the free flow of educational, 
scientific and cultural materials, defin- 
ing in general terms the obstacles 
under examination. 
The suggestion was alco made by 
Unesco that Member States should 
examine certain regulations and prac- 
tices insofar as they affect the impor- 
tation and purchase of such mate- 
rials. They are : foreign exchange 
controls; customs duties; quantitative 
restrictions; sales taxes and similar 
internal taxes; and export regulations. 
At the same time, Unesco put for- 
ward suggestions for remedial action. 
Unesco Schemes. 
NESCO has also embarked on a 
U number of schemes designed to 
reduce or eliminate certain eco- 
nomic obstacles to the free flow of 
educational, scientific and cultural 
materials, and in the light of the 
surveys undertaken, a plan of work 
for consideration by the Conference 
has been worked out. This- plan 
derives from the efforts of Unesco in 
two directions : 
(A) — to reduce tariff barriers 
applying to educational, scientific and 
cultural materials by seeking the 
assistance and advice of the Third 
Session of the Contracting Parties to 
th2 General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) Conference; 
(B) — to lescen the effect of foreign 
exchange difficulties by formulating, 
in coilaboration with the Economic 
Commission for Europe, g scheme for 
meeting the requirements of European 
countries through the conclusion of 
trade agreements on such materials. 
Unesco took the opportunity of the 
meeting at Annecy, France, of the 
Third Session of the GATT to obtain 
consideration of measures to reduce 
these obstacles. The Director-Gen- 
eral submitted to the Conference a 
memorandum on trade barriers 
affecting the import and export of 
educational, scientific and cultural 
materials, together with a list of items 
falling in these categories. He ask- 
ed GATT to include those items in 
its negotiations and take into account 
the desirability of achieving a maxi- 
mum of international trade in :cuch 
At its Beirut Session last year, the General Conference of Unesco 
asked the Secretariat to analyse those obstacles to the free movement 
of persons and of educational, scientific and cultural material which 
derive from currency and customs regulations. transport problems and 
other laws and regulations. It also requested that proposals be submitted 
for the recommendation to Member States of measures to eliminate these 
obstacles. 
This study has progressed sufficiently in the last few months to permit 
the drafting of a plan of work which is being submitted to the Fourth 
session of the Conference. It deals exclusively with currency and 
customs regulations and those rules which impede the free movement 
of persons between nations. 
products. He also submitted for 
study the text of the Draft Agreement 
to facilitate the international circu- 
lation of books, newspapers and perio- 
dicals which Unesco prepared, and 
sought the advice of the Conference 
on it. Finally, he requested GATT to 
advise Unesco on the additional prac- 
tical measures it might take to im- 
plement its mandate to reduce trade 
obstacles affecting the flow of edu- 
cational and scientific items. 
The Annecy Conference agreed to 
discuss these proposals and established 
a working party to examine the most 
practical means of studying and for- 
mulating solutions of the questions 
raised by Unesco. 
In response to Unesco’s request, 
special attention was also given to the 
reduction of customs duties through 
bilateral negotiations on certain cate- 
gories of educational material, and 
the Conference put it on record that, 
in future tariff negotiations, Govern- 
ments would, as far as possible, try 
to assist in furthering the objectives 
sought by Unesco. 
The Working Party on Unesco un- 
dertook a careful examination of the 
questions raised by the Director-Gen- 
eral and concluded that a most 
effective method for Unesco to ac- 
complish its objectives in this field 
would be to sponsor an international 
agreement to consolidate and expand 
the favourable treatment at present 
accorded to educational and scienti- 
fic materials in many countries. The 
Party then drafted the tentative text 
or an Agreement on the Importation 
of Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Materials which has been transmitted 
to Unesco and is being submitted to 
the Genera! Conference for discussion. 
: E.CE. Help. 
T the same time, Unesco has 
A endeavoured to lessen those 
obstacles to the free circulation 
of educational and scientific materials 
which derive from currency and quota 
restrictions. Thus, Unesco and the 
Economic Commirsion for Europe have 
consulted jogether on plans to meet 
the requirements of European coun- 
tries in such materials. A working 
arrangement was reached between 
the two Secretariats on the course of 
action to be followed. 
Under this plan, Unesco will submit 
to the E.CE. a list of scientific 
material and apparatus, as well as 
materials for elementary education 
which are required in many European 
countries. The E.CE. will send this 
list to its member-states and discuss 
it privately with trade representatives 
in order to bring together potential 
importing and exporting countries. 
As coon as a willingness to buy in one 
country is matched against a willing- 
ness to sell in another, the E.C.E. will 
bring the parties together and 
facilitate agreement. : 
The first list will be limited to 
items of importance to scientific and 
elementary education. If it elicits a 
favourable response, Unesco will sub- 
mit further lists on items such as 
press, film and radio equipment, tech- 
nical literature, etc. which will be 
dealt with in a similar way by the 
EC 
In the light of experience gained, 
it is proposed to extend the same 
working relationship as exists with 
the E.CE. to the Economic Commis- 
sion for Latin America and to the 
Economic Commission for Asia and 
the Far East. 
Movement of Persons. 
HE problem of the obstacles im- 
| p:zding the free movement of 
persons between nations has 
been examined by Unesco, and parti- 
cular consideration given to the work 
done on this subject by the Economic 
and Social Council of the United 
Nations and its Commission on 
Transport and Communications. 
The conclusion reached by the Se- 
cretary-General of the UN, as a 
result of the above-mentioned work 
was that it was advisable to keep the 
matter under review for a longer 
period before recommending that any 
further steps be taken on the interna- 
tional level. This seems to indicate, 
therefore, that for the time being no 
substantial change in the general 
cituation can be expected, at least 
insofar as these formalities apply to 
people wishing to travel irrespective 
of identity of profession. 
From the point of view of Unesco, 
however, it is desirable to distinguish 
certain categories of individuals tra- 
velling for educational, scientific and 
cultural purposes who, through their 
professional status or purpose of tra- 
vel, might benefit from a minimum 
of special treatment in passport and 
other formalitiec. Unesco, therefore, 
considers that membar-states might 
give special facilities with regard to 
visa and frontier formalities to per- 
sons or groups travelling for educat~ 
ional, scientific or cultural purposes. 
Member-states might also support any 
measure: aiming at facilitating tra- 
vel for educational or scientific pur- 
poses when the question of movement 
of persons comes up again before the 
Transport and Communications Com- 
mission, 
Financial Obstacles. 
tiez, however, are not the only 
or necessarily the most impor- 
tant barriers to the movement of per- 
sons for such purposes as Un:zsco 
stands for. Under existing condition-, 
the financial problem is the most 
serious obstacle. Although this diffi- 
culty would be lessened by a general 
improvement in the international 
currency <ituation, Unesco feels that 
attempts might be made within each 
interested country to increase the 
amount of currency allocation gran- 
ted to persons traveliing for educatio- 
nal, scientific or cultural ends. 
These difficulties could also be alle- 
viated by an increase in tlie number 
of fellowships or other grants to such 
persons from abroad and by a more 
universal effort towards providing 
special reductions in transport costs. 
Furthermore, host countries might 
concider the possibility of making 
generous fellowship grants to foreign 
students and scholars, in order that 
their foreign currency resources might 
e supplemented. 
These are the problems which the 
delegates to Unesco’s General Confe- 
rence have to discuss with regard to 
the free movement between nations of 
parsons and of educational, scientific 
and cultural materials.

### 74086: International work camps

INTERNATIONAL WORK CAMPS 
ROM its inception, Unesco 
has recognized the part that 
international work camps 
procuring information on the 
countries in which the camps are 
could play in reconstruction 
and in education for internatio- 
nal understanding. In the 
summer of 1947, it undertook a 
restricted project, in cooperation 
with four camps organized by 
various associations in Belgium, 
Czechoslovakia, France and Po- 
land. Unesco representatives 
visited the camps, worked and 
lived with the volunteers for a 
few days, and participated in the 
educational activities of the 
camps. ‘ 
Basing themselves upon their 
observations, the Unesco repre- 
sentatives considered that if the 
educational opportunities offered 
by the camps were fully utilised, 
the camps might become centres 
for spreading the ideals and 
principles which inspire Unesco’s 
work. The visits also enabled 
Unesco representatives to observe 
at close quarters the difficulties 
and problems with which the 
organizers were confronted, and 
as a result of these observations 
to develop an expanded pro- 
gramme for Unesco activity in 
this field. 
Coordination 
  
Conference. 
  
together, to exchange ideas 
and experiences, and thereby 
render their scattered efforts 
more effective, Unesco, in April 
1948, called a Conference of Camp 
Organizers and of associations 
which provide the camps with 
valunteers. Nineteen organiza- 
tions were represented. They dis- 
cussed the technical and educat- 
ional problems connected with 
the organization of camps and 
considered how problems might 
be solved through inter-organiz- 
ational co-operation government 
support and Unesco’s assistance. 
As their continuing agency, 
they created the Coordination 
Committee for International 
i8 :

FOLLOWING 
  
AT ITS LAST SESSION, THE GENERAL CONFERENCE ASKED THE DIRECTOR- 
GENERAL TO PREPARE DETAILED REPORTS ON VARIOUS ITEMS IN THE UNESCO 
IS A SUMMARY OF HIS REPORT ON THE HISTORY AND 
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL WORK CAMPS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES. 
Work Camps which has a small 
working body, but also invites 
representatives of all work camp 
prganizations to attend its 
meetings and participate in its 
work. Unesco provides its secre- 
tariat. The Committee, which 
meets about once a month, faci- 
litates the exchange and dissemi- 
nation of useful technical infor- 
mation and arranges for joint 
publicity. Each meeting is a 
forum where all members help 
to solve the difficulties which 
may confront any one of them, 
such as the recruitment and 
exchange of volunteers, visa and 
travel problems, etc. It also pro- 
vides Unesco with a valuable 
means of obtaining the advice 
and assistance of the work camp 
associations in regard to all its 
activities in this field. 
When the Second Conference 
of Organizing Assoclations met at 
Unesco House in March 1949, their 
number had increased to 27, aad 
the interest in these conferences 
is witnessed by the fact that, 
although Unesco did not pay the 
delegates’ travel expenses, 22 of 
the 45 attending delegates came 
to Paris from Austria, Czecho- 
slovakia, Denmark, Holland, Ru- 
mania, Sweden, Switzerland and 
the United Kingdom. They re- 
presented international and nat- 
ional organizations with widely 
differing aims and ideologies. 
This conference formulated 
specific requests for Unesco assis- 
tance. Having experienced the 
value of the past year's internat- 
ional cooperation, it recommend- 
ed that cooperation should also 
_ be established on the national 
level between the organizations 
concerned with international 
work camps and between these 
" population of 
  
organizations and the national 
commissions for Unesco. The 
delegates further agreed to the 
principle of organizing in the 
summer of 1950 a large work 
project in which all associations 
should participate and assigned 
the study of this plan to a ° 
special committee, 
. 
Types of Camps. 
HERE are two distinctly 
different types of camps: the 
smaller ones with twenty to 
fifty volunteers, which generally 
underiake short range repair or 
construction projects, and the 
bigger camps with thousands of 
participants, generally operated 
in the Eastern European 
countries, which engage In the 
building of railways, canals, etc. 
and organize their volunteers in 
national brigades of varying 
numbers, 
A total number of 135 interna- 
tional camps were organized in 
the Summer of 1948 in 23 
countries with an estimated 
fifty thousand 
volunteers. In the summer of 
1949, according to the plans 
announced 141 camps were organ- 
ized in nineteen countries, with 
work projects to include road 
building and repair, flood control 
and reforestation; agricultural 
work; medical, social and edu- 
cational work; building and 
repairing schools, hospitals, 
churches and homes; building 
and repairing playgrounds, youth 
centres and youth hostels. 
It appears from these figures 
that there has been no increase 
in the total number of camps 
over 1948, but it should be 
pointed out that the affillated 
agencies of the World Federation 
cf Democratic Youth in the 
Eastern countries of Europe 
concentrated their efforts this 
summer on the great Youth 
Rally in Hungary, and that for 
that reason they have announced 
that only one symbolic internat- 
ional camp will be organized in 
these countries. The actual in- 
crease in the number of camps 
In all other countries is over fifty 
per cent, 
. 
Unesco’s Assistance. 
NESCO maintains conti- 
nuous contact with the 
sponsoring organizations 
and renders assistance and advice 
In regard to general and specific 
problems. 
During the months preceding 
4¢he camp season, Unesco 
visited daily by a number of 
young people anxious to obtain 
information on how they may 
participate in a - work camp. 
Similar requests for information 
are recelved by mail from indi- 
viduals, organizations, schools 
and universities. Unesco has, 
therefore, gradually assumed the 
responsibility of assembling and 
diffusing data on the overall work 
camp programme. 
In order to meet what was 
considered an existing need, 
Unesco has also undertaken to 
participate in the educational 
activities of a certain number of 
camps by the loan of Unesco 
camp libraries, assistance in 
located and visits of Unesco re- 
Presentatives to the camps. 
Rapid Growth. 
 
libraries were 
procured and distributed to 
camps in eleven war-devasta- 
ted countries. Embassies and Le- 
gations in Paris contributed docu- 
mentary material on their 
countries. Each library contained 
three hundred titles in English, 
French and German. During the 
winter months, these libraries 
have, as far as possible, been 
u ilised in youth centres, stu- 
dents’ clubs or schools. 
To create and stimulate interest 
in the work camp movement and 
thereby enlist the aid of official 
authorities, the general public 
and prospective volunteers, Unes- 
co has undertaken, with the help 
of organizing bodies, to publicize 
thelr activities. 
Interest in the work of camp 
movements 1s growing rapidly. 
Everywhere new groups are 
being formed and plans made to 
enlist, through the camps, the 
cooperation of youth in the 
constructive development of the 
different countries. 
However, in spite of the 
increase in the number of spon- 
scoring organizations and camps, 
there are never enough to absorb 
the would-be campers and in 
most countries more than half of 
those who want to devote their 
holidays to this voluntary work 
have to be turned away. Many 
problems combine to hinder the 
free development of the move- 
ment : difficulties in finding suit- 
able projects; difficulties in 
procuring tools and equipment, 
in obtaining visas and travel 
facilities; present currency res- 
trictions and short holiday 
periods which limit participation 
in work camps. Certain govern- 
ments are already taking steps 
to remedy some of these diffi- 
culties,

### 74087: International circulation of publications

INTERNATIONAL 
CIRCULATION. 
OF PUBLICATIONS 
REE exchange of ideas and 
knowledge between peoples is 
on: of the main conditions of 
intellectual progress and under- 
standing and, consequently, of the 
establishment of world peace. 
therefore, a matter of primary impor- 
tance to facilitate the free circulation 
of publications, since, of all media for 
the interchange of ideas, the printed 
word in all its forms commends itself 
by reason of its long - established 
use and Is still — as regards both 
duration and accuracy of expression, 
one of the most effective instruments 
of intellectual intercourse and mass 
education. 
The draft agreement on the inter- 
national circulation of publications, 
therefore, provides that contracting 
parties undertake not to Institute or 
maintain any limitation on the entry 
into their territory of publications. 
It is, 
Under various articles, the agree- 
ment takes into account the legislation

This provides for the abolition of all 
customs duties on publications coming 
from another contracting party and 
includes the waiving of all costs, taxes, 
charges or dues which are not levied 
to the same extent on publications of 
national origin. It does not, how- 
ever, entail the abolition of taxes, 
costs, charges or dues relating to the 
importation of any articles whatsoever, 
including articles imported duty-fres, 
and in particular of statistics and 
stamp duties. 
The agreement further provides 
that no quantitative restrictions would 
be imposed by the contracting states 
whose legislation does not establish an 
exchangz control system, and makes 
provision for laws and regulations in 
force in these states. 
The ‘publications concerned include 
all which are of an educational, 
scientific and cultural character, and 
many others intended for public Ii- 
braries and collections, for the libra-

tional, research or cultural institutions, 
and private Institutions of the same 
character. The agreement also covers 
publications intended for bureaux or

In all cases, the primary purpose 
of this material must be to instruct or 
inform or to maintain, increase or

national understanding and goodwill. 
To obtain the exemption provided 
under the agreement, the materials 
concerned must be accompanied by a 
certificate that such maternal is of an 
educational, scientific or cultural cha- 
racter. The certificates can be issued 
by the appropriate governmental 
agency of the State wherein the ma- 
terial originated or by Unesco. 
The agreement also provides that 
the contracting states undertake jointly 
to consider means of reducing to a 
minimum the restrictions that are not 
removed by the agreement and which 
might interfere with the international 
circulation of educational and scientific 
material. 
All disputes arising out of the inter- 
pretation or application of the 
agreement can be referred to the In- 
ternational Court of Justice or to an 
arbitral tribunal unless it is agreed to 
have recourse to another mode of 
settlement. 
G.A.T.T. TEXT 
HILE Unesco was preparing 
the agreement on the importa- 
tion of books newspapers and 
periodicals, certain parallel develop- 
ments took place which are being 
brought to the attention of the General 
Conference. 
UNESCO COURIER 
 
T its session last year, The General Conference of Unesco asked the 
Director General to prepare a draft agreement on the importation of 
books, newspapers and periodicals. 
Secretariat in consultation with the Legal Department of the United Nations 
and will be presented to the General Conference's current session before 
submission to governments for signature. 
This draft agreement is a sequel to a similar draft accord for facilitating 
the international circulation of visual and auditory materials of an educational, 
scientific and cultural nature which was approved by the General Conference 
last year and has since been submitted to member states for signature. 
These two agreements are designed to promote the free flow of ideas by 
word and image and to encourage the understanding of peoples in confor- 
mity with the aims of Unesco. 
The Contracting Parties to the 
General Agre ment on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) which held their 
third session at Annecy, France, dur- 
ing the spring, received from the 
Director-General of Unesco a « Me- 
morandum on Trade Barriers affect- 
ing the Import and Export of Educa- 
tonal, Scientific and Cultural Mate- 
rials. » (See also page 7.) 
After carefully examining the me- 
thods of reducing trade barriers to the 
international circulation of such ma- 
terials, a special Working Party con- 
cluded that a most effective method 
for Unesco to accomplish its objective 
in this field would be to sponsor an 
international agreement, consolidating 
and extending the favourable trade 
treatment at present accorded to this 
kind of materials in many countries. 
The Working Party then proceeded 
to draft the tentative text of an 
Agreement * on the Importation of 
This text was prepared by thc 
  * 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Materials, covering the following ca- 
tegories : (a) books and publications; 
.(b) works of art and other objects of 
an cducational, scientific and cultural 
character; (c¢) visual and auditory 
materials of an educational, sc’entific 
and cultural character. 
This draft text is also being sub- 
mitted to the General Conference for 
discussion. But in a report, the Se- 
cretarlat of Unesco points out that the 
text prepared by GATT makes pro- 
vision for the materials covered by the 
two draft agreements mentioned above 
"as well as for certain other materials 
under the cat:gory of works of art. 
It will therefore, be up to the General 
Conference to decide whether to act 
on separate agresments or on one 
broad agreement to facilitate the 
international circulation of a wide 
variety of educational, scientific and 
cultural materials.

UNESCO'S CONTRIBUTION TO 
LIBRARIES RECONSTRUCTION 
~ AND DEVELOPMENT 
N the original conception of the Unesco Clearing House for Publi- 
cations, no provision had been made for the operational distribution 
of books by Unesco. In many instances, the Clearing House was, 
however, obliged to accept actual book gifts for distribution to libraries 
throughout the world, because the donor was unable or unwilling to 
do more besides actually donating the books. This was for instance 
the case last year when the French Government offered 25,000 volumes 
EGYPT AND NETHERLANDS 
JOIN BOOK COUPON SCHEME 
student in Alexandria can now 
order valuable reference books 
from Amsterdam, and pay for them 
with Unesco Book Coupons. This is 
the latest development in the Unesco 
Book Coupon Scheme launched in 
December 1948. Egypt and the Ne- 
theriands have announced their parti- 
cipation. 
Egypt has joined the Scheme both 
as book-buyer and book-supplier, and 
will receive immediately a first allio- 
cation of book coupons worth 
$15,000. As the agency responsible 
for the sale of coupons in Egypt, the 
Egyptian Government has designated 
the Administration of Generali Culture 
of the Ministry of Education at Cairo. 
All Egyptian booksellers can now 
accept book coupons in payment for 
tneir publications. 
The Netherlands have joined the 
Scheme as book-suppiiers only. The 
Stichting Grafisch Export Centrum, 
N.Z. Voorburgwal 58-60, Amsterdam- 
C., has been appointed as centralizing 
agency, to which anyone wishing to 
buy books, published in the Nether- 
lands, with Unesco book coupons, 
should send his order. 
NINE COUNTRIES NOW INCLUDED 
THESE two latest additions bring 
the total number of countries 
benefiting from Unesco’s Book Cou- 
pon Scheme to nine, namely: Czecho- 
slovakia, Egypt, France, Hungary, 
India and the United Kingdom (ali 
book-buyers and book-suppliers); the 
Netherlands, Switzeriand, and the 
United States of America (book-sup- 
pliers only). 
Another important development has 
been announced by Unesco. The 
validity of book coupons already in 
circulation, which originally had to 
be liquidated within a ten=-months’ 
experimental period, has now been 
extended until! the end of 1950. Yet 
in Czechoslovakia, a very active mem= 
ber of the Book Coupon Scheme since 
its inception, the first allocations of 
sale- and gift-coupons, totalling 
$27,000, have already been exhausted, 
and the central Czechoslovak distri= 
buting agency has applied for another 
$20,000-worth of coupons for sale to 
libraries and institutions. Other 
countries are expected to present si- 
milar requests at any moment.     
of French classics for distribution 
through Unesco. 
Almost daily, the Clearing House 
now circulates lists of publications 
offered for distribution by libraries. 
learned societies and individual 
donors. On the basis of requests 
then received, publications change 
their owners and, in promoting this 
continuous flow of publications 
from country to country, the 
Clearing House takes an active role 
by supplying information on needs 
and transport facilities, and very 
often even pays for the shipment of 
donated books. Duplicate and sur- 
plus copies, which would otherwise 
have been sent to the paper mill for 
pulping are thus again coming inte 
the hands of readers for whom 
these books would have been lost. 
Of particular importance in the 
field of libraries’ reconstruction are 
the national book centres, created 
or sponsored by Unesco, such as the 
British National Book centre, the 
Canadian Book centre and the 
United States Book Exchange, Inc. 
the former American Book Center. 
A considerable contribution to 
libraries’ reconstruction will also be 
made by the CARE/Unesco book 
programme which was started in 
1949, and which, with an ultimate 
target of more than $2,000.000 will 
play an immensely smportant role 
tn supplying libraries in war 
damaged areas with the necessary 
literature in the fields of Health 
and Welfare, Nursing, Medicine, 
Dentistry, Agricultural science, Ve- 
terinary science, biology, chemistry, 
engineering, geology, library ad- 
ministration, mathematics, physics 
physiology, psychology, sociology 
and statistics.

### IGNORE

UNESCO COURIER 
CH 
ONSIDERING that Children’s 
C Communities represented one 
of its most significant and im- 
. portant new ventures, the Secretariat 
of Unesco convened an international 
conference at Trogen (Switzerland) in 
July of last year. The purpose of 
this meeting was to provide an oppor- 
tunity for a free discussion and 
exchange of views on the problems of 
war-handicapped children. Thirty-five 
experts and directors of children’s 
communities from twelve countries as 
well as observers from the Interna- 
tional] Bureau of Education and the 
International Children’s Emergency 
Fund attended. 
One of the greatest difficulties, the 
experts found, which children’s commu- 
nities encounter In carrying out their 
work Is that of obtaining the necessary 
equipment and of securing funds and 
practical help in the form of goods or 
voluntary services. As their educa- 
tional methods are generally very 
different from the traditional methods, 
they receive little or no help from public 
authorities and derive their resources 
almost entirely from private gifts. 
The provision of the help needed to 
restore, maintain and establish commu- 
nities appeared, at this Conference, to 
be one of the most urgent and useful 
tasks. 
  
As a result of the Conference, an 
International Federation of Children’s 
Communities (LF.C.C.) was esta- 
blished with its headquarters at 
Trogen. The aim of this organization 
1s to trace children’s communities 
throughout the world, to promote the 
exchange of children and teachers 
between the different communities, to 
coordinate research and to disseminate 
information. The Secretariat of 
Unesco has given the Federation its 
support and has financed four meetings 
of the Executive Committee. 
Either directly or through National 
Commissions, Unesco has encouraged 
the establishment of national associa- 
tions of children’s communities, and 
the appomtment of national correspon- 
dents of the I.LF.C.C. 
Unesco’s surveys 
NESCO is in touch with over 
U one hundred children’s commu- 
nittes in Germany, Belgium 
France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the 
Netherlands and Switzerland. It has 
received full reports on the aims, orga- 
nization and educational methods of 
each centre, often accompanied by 
photographs, drawings, statistics and 
other material. ee 
The needs of children’s communities 
have been systematically studied by 
Unesco and are outiined in general 
lists of needs common to all children’s 
communities and lists of needs of each 
individual case, having regard to the 
location, special nature of the com- 
munity and the typs of child for which 
it 1s intended (mentally defective, del:- 
cate, difficult children, etc.) 
These lists have been published in 
English, French and Spanish in 
Unesco’s periodicals; they have been 
distributed among organizations in 
donor countries and to all the people 
concerned. Unesco has endeavoured 
to put each community in touch 
with organizations or people who 
may be able to help it. It has thus 
increased the number of international 
bonds which help to establish better 
understanding. 
Appeals for  war-handicapped 
children have also been launched suc- 
20 
cessfully in the press, by radio and by 
means of exhibitions. All the necess- 
ary steps have been taken to enable 
donors to transmit gifts of money in 
cooperation with the LF.C.C., the 
French National Association of Chil- 
dren’s Communities (F.N.A.C.C.) 
and the national correspondents. 
Last month, Unesco helped in the 
organization of an International Chil- 
dren's Camp at the « Children’s Re- 
public » at Moulin-Vieux near La- 
valdens, (Isére), France. The camp 
contained about fifty boys and girls 
between the ages of 12 and 17, 
chosen from among war victims In 
children’s communities. The camp 
programme included periods of physical 
culture, a study of the folklore of 
various countries, talks on current pro- 
blems and excursions into the surround- 
ing country. The children took a 
share in organizing and running the 
camp. They thus had an opportumty 
for personal experience of international 
cooperation and took back the benefits 
of it to their own communities. 
As the resources of children’s 
communities are generally scanty, the 
cost of the material organization of the 
camp, which amounts to about 
three million francs (approximately 
$11,000) was covered largely by 
public subscription. As the result of 
the appeal to French educational 
authorities in primary, secondary and 
technical schools, launched in the first 
week of June under the auspices of 
the French National Commission for 
Unesco, in order to obtain a donation 
of one franc from each pupil, over 
half the sum had already been handed 
to the treasurer of the F.N.A.C.C. by 
the end of June. Furthermore, 
Unesco drew the attention of the 
 
ILDRENS COMMUNITIES 
voluntary organizations concerned to 
the desirability of their assisting such 
an undertaking. 
Model Newspaper 
ECONDLY, an international seminar 
was organized for men and 
women teachers who wished to 
improve their professionnal training 
and to give their colleagues in other 
countries the benefit of their knowledge. 
Thz Seminar, which lasted a fortnight 
was held at the Ile de France Commu- 
nity School last July. 
At the last session of the Executive 
Committee of the I.F.C.C., held at 
Unesco House in June, a dummy 
model of an international newspaper, 
prepared by a specialist, was submitted 
to the members of the Executive 
Committee who decided to circulate it 
to all the children’s communities 
concerned with the idea of producing 
an international newspaper which they 
would all help to edit. This link 
between the different communities 
should help to bring about improved 
international understanding. 
At the same session, a member of 
the Executive Committee, M. Richard, 
was instructed to prepare a scheme for 
setting up a “Unesco House” at 
Trogen. Such an international centre 
would be designed to make it possible 
for children from different communities 
and teachers serving in those commun- 
ities to meet together for a period of 
three to six months. Visitors to the 
centre would thus have an opportunity 
of practical experience of international 
understanding. It would also make it 
possible to provide a more thorough 
vocational guidance service for the 
children on an international scale.

### 74090: A Colonial Arts Council?

### 74091: India's health is her job

A COLONIAL 
ARTS COUNCIL? 
i MONG the most striking mani 
A festations of the «Colonial 
Month» which has recently co- 
me to an end were the exhibitions 
of primitive art from the coloni 
in point of fact, mostly from negro 
West Africa. When I was in Africa 
in 1944, 1 was deeply impressed by 
the range and variety of its tradition- 
al art, and above all by the vigour 
and high quality; and these exhibi- 
ticns revived those impressions with 
renewed force. 
West Africa gives us the bronzes 
and terracottas of Ife, whose classical 
style, unique in black Africa, poses 
fascinating historical questions, the 
subject of correspondence in preced- 
ing issues of the «Sunday Times». 
It gives us the delightful gold weights 
of Ashanti; the rich costumes of hun- 
dreds of native rituals; the bronzes 
of Benin in which barbarism touches 
the heights of splendour; wood-car- 
vings with the natural strength and 
sense cf form after which modern 
Western sculpture is striving; masks 
in endless variety, some of what we 
are accustomed to think of as pure 
negro type, others recalling the style 
of the Far East, others reminiscent 
of Red Indians or of sophisticated 
night-clubs in New York, comic masks 
with hinged jaws looking like Charlie 
Macarthy, horrifying masks «<f the 
gods of disease, ivory masks with a 
The tragic thing, however, is that 
in West Africa, as almost everywhere 
else, this primitive art is rapidly dis- 
appearing. The objects themselves 
are disappearing, through neglect, or, 
in the case of masks and wood sculp- 
tures, through being eaten by ter. 
mites; the traditional skills of the 
carver and the weaver are dying out; 
the old religious rituals are ceasing 
to be practised as the old structure of 
African society crumbles before the 
impact of cur Western civilization — 
or rather of the disruptive economi- 
cal and technological forces which 
emanate from it, for the civilization 
itself has not taken root in negro 
Africa. 
The colonial Powers, it seems to me, 
have a serious responsibility in this 
matter, To begin with, they should 
be much more active than they are 
in collecting ang preserving all they 
can of the traditional arts eof the pri- 
mitive peoples under their charge, and 
publishing accounts of them. 
But even if all art specimens of 
a]l the colonies were properly housed 
and preserved and published, primi- 
tive art itself might well disappear; 
that would be like what has happened 
with the Dode and the Great Auk. 
If something is not done, primitive 
peoples all over the world run the 
risk of becoming debased into a new 
kind of proletariat — a geographical 
appendage to the central core of in- 
dustrial civilizaticn. They will lose

medievai dignity, animal masks with 
astonishingly effective simplification; 
figures with an Etruscan look, a Me- . 
lanesian look, “a look as of ancient 
Mexico. : R. 
Art and Life 
T HERE are even new and unfami- 
liar art-forms: as post-Renais- 
sance Europe invented the headless 
and limbless torso, so Southern Ni- 
geria invented the armless figure — 
and made an aesthetic success of it. 
Ancther thing was brought home 
to me in West Africa. The art of the 
region was mot just a collection of 
museum p'eces or objects for exhi- 
bition in a gallery; it was related to 
life. The Ashanti gold weights were 
used in the business of weighing gold. 
The masks and costumes were used in 
tribal and secret society ceremonials; 
they both canalised and expressed 
pewerful emotions. I myself saw one 
ritual in which an astonishing figure, 
completely concealed in a cylindrical 
«dress» and surmounted by a head- 
dress covered with woodcarvings, 
seemed to express the very spirit of 
life in the equatorial forest, from 
which it impressively emerged; and 1 
was shown photographs of ceremonies 
in which the dancer and costumes 
conspired to give an cverpowering ex- 
pression to the strange overtones and 
mysterious depths of savage life. 
Change and Decay 
T O say that West African art is 
primitive does not, ¢f course, 
mean that it is crude art or poor art: 
primitive art is a descriptive term 
meaning the traditional art of peoples 
who have not been industrialised and 
indeed have not reached the technical 
levels of crganization that the socio- 
logists call civilization, Furthermore, 
its tradition is not necessarily forma- 
lized; up till quite recently, much of 
the West African art has been deve- 
loping and changing with a remarkable 
degree of vitality and variety of ex- 
pression. ’ 
sicn, an essential outlet, both for their 
individual - selves and for their group 
consciousness and their national pride. 
It is obviously no good frying just 
to preserve the arts in their tradi- 
ticnal form when the social and reli- 
gious basis for them has disappeared. 
That would be to turn them into 
living fossils, mere museum pieces 
without relevance to the life around 
them. Somehow the tradition must 
be developed and adapted to the new 
cenditicns, The peoples must be proud 
of their traditions and past achieve- 
ments, but their arts must be adapted 
so that they have significance for the 
present. The individual artist and 
craftsman must be able to live by his 
arl; and the group must become aware 
of the social value of the arts for its 
own evolution, 
Adjustment 
IT is not true to say that traditional 
art is inevitably doomed to extinc- 
tion. Here and there it has been de- 
literately given a new lease of life. 
While travelling on behalf of Unesco, 
I found that in Peru, for instance, 
and Guatemala, and among some 
North American Indians, the old tra- 
ditiecns have been more or less success- 
fully adapted to prosper in the mo- 
dern werld; and in West Africa itself 
traditional music is being adapted and 
used as a means of providing expres- 
sion to the new society that is taking 
the place of tribalism. 
But in general, all too little is being 
done or even attempted. The Western 
world seems blinded to everything that 
is not quantitative. ©The volume of 
experts and imports; the proportion 
of children attending school; the num- 
ber of hospitals; the size of the popu- 
lation; these are the priorities, The 
arts are treated as the Cinderellas 
of Education Departments, or tidily 
preserved (after killing) in museums. 
We have set up an Arts Council 
in Britain, and it has done a great 
deal to make the arts come alive in 
the life of this country. But there 
are more people in the Colonies than 
in Britain, and their arts are in gra- 
ver danger than ours are or ever were. 
Why not an Art Ceuncil for and in 
the colonies ?

RAJKUMAR! AMRIT KAUR. 
INDIA'S 
|S HE 
by Daniel 
OR fifteen years, an Indian princess 
F worked side by side with Mahatma 
Gandhi in his patient struggle to 
create a nation for over 300 million 
people. As the secretary to Bapu — which 
means Father — Rajkumari Amrit Kaur 
even went to {ail in support of the Ma- 
hatma's beliefs. The day after an assas- 
sins bullet ended Gandhi's life in January 
1948, she said to a grieving nation: 
«May God have mercy on us and give 
us the strength fo be true to Bapu and 
"thus build up the India of his dreams.» 
it is this faith which she brings to her 
present task as India’s Minister of Health, 
one of the most difficult jobs facing any 
woman or man in the world. It was the 
some faith which transformed her into one 
of Gandhi's hardest-working followers. 
For Rajkumari — meaning «princess» in 
Hindustani — Amrit Kaur was born into 
a princely family, educated in England 
and France and brought up as a Chris- 
tian. 
As Gandhi's secretary, she religiously 
followed the simple, ascetic life he laid 
down. Even today, the Rajkumari still 
wears a robe of khadi, or homespun, and 
she is a strict vegetarian in her diet. She 
has an excellent radio voice and she com- 
bines Gandhi's idealism with a modern 
outlook on her work. 
This pleasant, sincere woman — who 
looks much younger than her 60 years — 
became India's minister of health in 1947 
at a time when the new country was being 
torn by rioting and upset by large-scale re- 
fugee migrations. 
The difficulties before Rajkumari Amrit 
Kaur are quite in keeping with the vast 
size and population of India. Smallpox, 
for example, is under control in large 
parts of the world, but in India there 
is a constant fear that it can become an 
epidemic at any time. The average life 
expectancy of man in Western nations is 
about 60 years; in India it is only 27. 
Much of the population lives in rural vil- 
lages and must be educated in the use 
of proper sanitary methods before it can 
be told to practise them, 
A Million Nurses Needed 
AJKUMARI Amrit Kaur is well aware 
of the fact that all cannot be reme- 
died overnight. The Bhore Committee 
report, made several years ago, estimated 
that the nation needs a million nurses to 
give ite population adequate protection. 
It is hoped this goal will be reached in 
30 years, but today there are less than 
15,000 nurses for India's 300 millions. The 
Rajkumari is attacking this problem, as 
HEALTH 
R JOB 
BEHRMAN 
well as others, with patience and a belief 
that whatever is done must be done weil 
She already has been instrumental in sett- 
ing up the first Nursing Council in India 
and she has sponsored legislation raising 
the pay level of nurses. Last year, when 
many nations contributed gifts of peni- 
cillin, atabrine and other badly-needed 
drugs to India, she personally supervised 
their distribution. 
Her eventual aim is what she once 
called «an adequate, efficient health ser- 
vice for every man, woman and child 
whether they can afford to pay for such 
a service or not. » Between the India 
of 1949 and this ideal stand tremendous 
obstacles such as bad housing, overcrowd- 
ing, poor water supply, insufficent food 
and not enough trained medical person: 
nel. To all of this, the Rajkumari has ans- 
wered: « Every litfle step forward means 
a great deal. | believe that if anyone 
wants anything badly enough, he gene- 
rally works for it and is therefore able 
in the end .to get ity 
Besides her duties as health minister, 
this frail little woman also takes part in 
such activities as the Indian Red Cross 
and various delegations to Unesco's ge- 
neral conference. It all is part of an 
extremely busy life. 
«A cabinet minister's lot is a hard onev, 
she said recently. There are endless in- 
terviews, some very interesting, some ex- 
tremely boring; endless good deeds to be 
done like the distribution of prizes at 
functions; the inauguration of something 
or other, the laying of a foundation stone 
somewhere or other and so on. When 
| lcok at my programme at the beginning 
of each day, | wonder how | am ever 
going to get through it. And yet the 
days fly by and so much is there to do 
and think and discuss and write that one 
has not time even to feel tired.» 
She believes in direct methods to get 
things done rather than the delicate pro- 
cesses of protocol and formality. She 
feels that a woman is much less patient 
with governmental red tape than a man. 
Recently, the ever-active Rajkumari attend- 
ed the World Health Assembly at Rome 
on behalf of her government. She took 
with her this same capacity for hard work 
and devotion to her job. 
Not long ago, she tcld a radio audience 
in India: 
«lt is a tremendous thing to have 
attained our political independence. it 
is an even bigger thing to be alive and 
working one's hardest so that we may 
make of India a country which will help 
lead this troubled world into the paths of 
peace.»

### 74092: Education: UNESCO's programme

EDUCATION 
  
UNESCO'S PROGRAMME 
is based on the assumption 
that understanding between 
peoples — and, consequently, lasting 
peace and security — are possible 
only when two educational conditions 
are met : every country must have a 
system of universal education adapt- 
ed to its cultural and economic needs; 
and there must be an organized de- 
sire within each country to use edu- 
cation to increase international un- 
derstanding. Without this desire a 
well-organized education system can 
be used to promote war as readily as 
peace. On the other hand, no go- 
vernment, though it have the best will 
in the world, can do much to develop 
international un- 
derstanding in an 
U NESCO’S education programme 
illiterate popula- 
tion, or in one 
which, through 
lack of technical 
skills, lives at an 
economic level 
far below that of 
the countries to- 
wards which it is 
supposed to feel 
understanding 
and goodwill. An 
empty stomach is a bad basig for hu- 
man understanding. 
If this point of view be accepted, it 
goes far towards meeting the fears of 
those who feel that Unesco, in its ef- 
forts to help countries to raise the 
level of their general education sys- 
tems, may be in danger of wandering 
too far from its primary and avowed 
purpose of contributing to peace and 
gécurity. Seminars on illiteracy. con- 
ferences on university and adult edu- 
cation, and missiong ¢n primary, se- 
condary and technical schooling be- 
come as essential to the programme as 
the analysis of textbooks and the writ- 
ing of pamphlets about world under- 
standing. 
This is not to say that Unesco’s at- 
titude should be exactly the same to- 
wards both types of activity. It may 
be assumed that most countries have 
a desire, often an intense desire, to 
raise the level of their general édu- 
cation and to extend its benefits to a 
greater proportion of the population. 
There is, in addition, a great deal of 
the necessary technical knowledge 
already scattered through the Member 
States, although it is very unevenly 
distributed. Unesco’s main contribu- 
tion is to develop services for assis- 
ting the exchange of educational ideas, 
practices and materials in such a way 
that every country will be able to 
take advantage of the experience of 
the others in creating a system of 
universal education suited to its needs 
and to the capacities of its individual 
citizens. This is the conception of an 
educational clearing house or «ex- 
change market», under which Unes- 
co’s own special responsability ig to

Assistant Direclor- 
General in Charge

ques», . 
FOR INTERNATIONAL 
UNDERSTANDING 
IN the field of education for interna- 
tional understanding, however, 
Unesco must be prepared to take more 
direct responsibility. Unfortunately. 
the desire to use education delibera- 
tely for this purpose is not as wide. 
spread as is the wish to use it for more 
obvious domestic or national purpo- 
ses. This is entirely understandable. 
The concept of education for interma- 
tional understanding is a complex 
one, and it is, at 
the present stage, 
not to be expec- 
ted that there will 
be the same po- 
pular clamour for 
it as there is, for 
example, for tech- 
nical education. 
There is, moreo- 
ver, a sad lack 
of the materials 
and skills neces- 
sary for this re- 
Even amongst 
those who are most anxious to de- 
velop education for international un- 
derstanding, there is no small diffe- 
rence of opinion as to whether the at- 
tack should be primarily by direct or 
by indirect methods, and as to the 
effect that such education can have on 
the trend of world events in the im- 
mediate future. 
All this throws on to Unesco a bur- 
den of responsibility that it should 
have no wish to avoid. It cannot, of 
course, take sides on the question of 
«direct» or «indirect» education for in- 
ternational understanding: and must, 
to the limits of its powers, help all 
countries to develop such education in 
the ways they think best. But it 
cannot afford to be mnéutral on the 
ends to be achieved : it must keep 
before the countries of the world the 
idea that, today, education of all 
kinds and at all levels should have 
as one of its functions, the develop- 
ment of understanding between peo- 
ples. The «clearing house» concept 
of Unesco’s functions is not, of itself, 
adequate to meet the situation, and 
the Organization must be prepared, 
in the sphere of education for inter- 
national understanding, to take the 
initiative more frequently and more 
strongly than in any other part of its 
educational programme. 
The notes on the education pro- 
gramme to be found in this issue will 
give some idea of how this policy has 
been carried out in practice over re- 
cent months. In the programme pro- 
posed for 1950 it can be seen even 
more clearly that Unesco’s interest in 
international understanding will strong- 
ly influence most of its educational 
activities.

### 74093: The Viani Associated Project

THE VIANI 
ASSOCIATED PROJECT 
ANI, in Colombia, is typical of 
\/ the communities to be found in 
the Andes mountains. Covering 
about 7.500 hectares, it is located in the 
upper limits of the coffee belt at an 
elevation of 1,6c0 metres. On its steep 
and rugged landscape the slopes average 
between 35 and 30 degrees and reach 
down to deep narrow valleys where level 
areas large enough to allow the building 
of a normal house are difficult to find. 
There are no roads in Viani except 
the main street that goes through the 
village, and the 6,000 inhabitants of the 
community have to use an intricate 
network of trails up and down the slopes 
to reach their widely scattered homes. 
‘For transport, they use horses and mules, 
and all farming operations to raise the 
principal crops —coffee, corn, yuca, ani-

seed, bananas and sugar cane— are per- 
formed by hand. 
After centuries of wear and tear, the 
soil of Viani is nearing complete 
exhaustion and as the wearing-out pro- 
cess continues, the helpless farmers feel 
more and more insecure as they find 
no means of preventing their soil from 
being eroded away. 
The salvation of the people of Viani, 
as is indeed the salvation of most of the 
people of Colombia and other parts of 
South America along the Andes moun- 
tains, is soil conservation and particu- 
larly the effective control and preven- 
tion of soil erosion. 
It was because Viani was considered 
as a typical rural area of Colombia that 
the Colombian Government chose it as 
the site for a fundamental education 
project, which it called «Model Rural 
Community». 
A model community 
HE Ministers of Education. Eco- 
nomy and Agriculture agreed on a 
joint action to develop on an experi- 
mental basis a model community, and 
for this purpose they established a cen- 
tre of Social Anthropology under the 
sponsorship of the school located at 
Viani. The new institution, which was 
named the Civic Centre, was supplied 
with adequate buildings and staff and 
its director became the ex-officio direc- 
tor of the Viani project. 
Finally, the Civic Centre asked that 
Unesco establish an Associated Project 
in Viani and last March, on the request 
cf the Colombian Government, Unesco 
sent to Viani Mr Patricio Sanchez, a 
young and energetic soil conservationist. 
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
After studying the community and its 
people for several weeks, Mr Sanchez, 
in co-operation with Mr Gabriel Ospi- 
na, head of the Viani Civic Centre, 
began to take positive action. 
First of all, he conducted a series of 
group discussions with the farmers of 
Viani, so as to bring home to them the 
magnitude and seriousness of the soil. 
erosion problem in their community 
and to plan with them the practical 
steps which they themselves could take 
to stop it. 
‘Then, :Mr Sanchez talked to the 
school teachers of Viani so as to show 
them how education was closely linked 
with the problem and to urge them to 
associate the question of soil conserva- 
tion with the school curriculum in all 
grades. 
Finally, he organized the rural youth 
of Viani —those aged between 12 and 
15 who had completed their «alfabe- 
tismoy and for whom there would nor- 
mally have been nothing in store but to 
revert back to their traditional exis- 
tence. He explained to them that their 
future would be of their own making 
and that they could be a factor in 
making their community a better place 
in which to live. To do this, he told 
them, they must take on the responsi- 
bility of helping to prevent the further 
wearing out of their lands. - 
Beginning to realize 
FTER four months, Mr Sanchez 
reports that the people of Viani are 
beginning to realize that they can con- 
serve their soil and that they alone can 
prevent soil erosion through the imme- 
diate, united and consistent application 
of effort and intelligence. 
His plans, however, do not end with 
soil conservation for he feels that the 
larger problem is human conservation 
through education, of which soil con- 
servation is only one of the major 
means. 
What Viani now needs, he considers, 
are the services of a practical agricul- 
turist who would help the farmers to 
raise more and better crops per hec- 
tare of land. There is also an urgent 
need for a domestic economist to visit 
the homes to show the women and girls 
how to plan better meals for the fa- 
mily. how to care for children, the aged 
and the sick and generally how to make 
their homes more comfortab'e places in 
which to live. 
Finally, Viani needs a health specia- 
list to show the people how disease can 
be prevented and an educationist to help 
in the reorientation of the educational 
system and the modification of the 
schools curriculum so as to make educa- 
tion the key to improved living condi- 
tions. 
As far as possible it is hoped to 
recruit these experts locally or from 
Central and South American countries. 
One of the aims of the project is to 
develop local leadership for its further 
implementation, and later, its extension, 
to the other Colombian communities 
and other parts of Latin America.

Member States to make appropriate provision for 
the travel expenses of participants. 
_ This system, however, met with considerable cri- 
ticism. We are accordingly considering the adoption 
of another plan, which would lead to a more equi- 
table distributicn amongst Member States of the 
expense involved. Under the new plan, Unesco would 
contribute to the travel expenses of participants 
on a sliding scale and in proportion to the distance 
travelled: board and lodging, on the other hand, 
would be the responsibility of participants or their 
governments. This plan will be laid before the 
Fourth Session of the General Conference in Sep- 
tember 1949, and the decision taken by the Confe- 
rence will be communicated to Member States by 
the end of Cctober 1949.

### 74095: What is UNESCO doing for: adults, children, universities, child war victims

WHAT UNESCO IS DOING FOR: 
ADULTS 
S a result of its relative . 
A youth, the adult education 
movement still lacks 
cohesion and unity. Each experi- 
ment has a character of its own 
peculiar to the nation in which it 
is proceeding, and public opinion 
in each country is either almost 
entirely ignorant or has little 
understanding of what is going on 
elsewhere. Thus Unesco’s task in 
this field is obvious and in strict 
accordance with its duty of forging 
links and facilitating exchanges. 
Tt was in pursuance of that two- 
fold task that Unesco convened 
last June an International Con- 
‘ference on Adult Education, which 
was held at Elsinore in Denmark. 
For ten days delegates of twenty- 
seven nations and of twenty-one 
international non - governmental 
organizations were able to ex- 
change information, to discuss 
their problems and to draw up a 
number of recommendations. The 
latter form a kind of minimum 
joint programme for adult educa- 
tion, which includes a number of 
activities international in nature, 
such as the regular convening of 
seminars, the formation eof an 
International Consultative Com- 
‘mittee, the publication of a news 
bulletin, abstracts, etc. The Con- 
ference was of the opinion that 
under present circumstances 
Unesco was the body best fitted 
adequately to execute the interna- 
tional side of the programme. 
In addition, Unesco will shortlv 
be publishing a world directo

The contest closed on lst September, and preliminary Judging of 
entries by Unesco Member States is now in progress. fying 
The contest has been conducted in two sections: one for students 
between 12 and 15 years of age. and the other for those between 
15 and 18 years of age. Prizes will be awarded in the form of grants 
to enable the winners either to travel abroad to attend conferences 
on world affairs. to acquire further education. or to purchase books 
and other educational materials, 
UNIVERSITIES 
and other schools of equiva- 
lent standard existing in the 
world to-day represent a very impor- 
tant spiritual force which has not yet 
been fully utilised for the construc- 
tion of a new and peaceful world. 
T. four thousand universities 
Now that most of the universities 
which suffered through the war have 
recovered—many of them through 
the help of Unesco—it should be 
‘ pussible for them to create a better 
international unity among themselves 
as a step to working for world 
unity. 
Among these several thousand 
universities, however, there is a high 
diversity in teaching plans and other 
features of their activities, so that if 
closer ties are to be created between 
them, it is necessary to know more 
completely and precisely the nature 
of these differences. The need there- 
fore arises for a clearing house as a 
world centre of documentation and 
information. 
This clearing house, the Interna- 
tional Bureau of Universities, has 
now been opened under the auspices 
of Unesco and is developing its 
activities at Unesco House. 
Unesco also intends to call an 
international conference with the aim 
of creating an international associa- 
tion of universities. Finally, Unesco 
is carrying out research into how the 
services of the universities can be 
used most efficiently in the interests 
of international understanding.

CHILD WAR VICTIMS 
N the programme concerned 
with war-handicapped chil- 
dren, Unesco has had to tackle 
the double problem of the educa- 
ticn of children whom it is still 
impossible to teach in normal con- 
ditions, owing to the dislocation of 
their social environment, and of 
the special re-education necessary 
to remedy the various forms of 
handicap, due to the war, which 
have caused irregularities in the 
psychological development of chil- 
dren. 
Surveys have been carried out in 
eleven European countries, with 
the cooperation of governments 
and charitable organizations, to 
discover what are the needs, and 
to study typical experiments which 
may provide a solution for certain 
specific educational problems. In- 
ternational efforts to deal with the 
question were analyzed, in consul- 
tation with the technical experts 
taking part in them, in order to 
draw general conclusions from the 
study of the many problems which 
appear to differ individually. 
The general report on «The 
Educational Problems of War-han- 
dicapped Children», with working 
references attached, is at present 
being published; this report des- 
cribes the many forms these hu- 
man problems take, and also deals 
with work in progress and the fu- 
ture efforts required to carry out 
suzcessfully a considerable task for 
which the mobilization of the ac- 
tive forces of society as a whole is 
necessary. 
The Podebrady Seminar 
T HE part that war-handicapped 
children have to play in the 
endeavour to secure international 
understanding, and the educatio- 
nal measures entailed, were des- 
cribed in various talks given by

Unesco Seminar at Podebrady in 
1948, and at the Second Interna- 
tional Congress for the Education

Unesco represen- 
tatives are often asked by 
‘citizens of countries which 
have escaped the horrors of 
war. "We've had nearly four 
vears of peace. How long 
must all this reconstruction 
work continue?”. 
Unesco’s answer is this : «It 
takes far longer to build than 
to destroy. The nations of Eur- 
ope and Asia. experienced 
continuous destruction during 
six years of total war — the 
destruction overnight, as it 
were, of a century’s accumul- 
ation of all the potentialities 
of future prosperity, freedom 
and culture. We owe them at 
least six years of peace, with 
all the aid we can give, to 
heal the grievous wounds they 
suifered ». 
With the modest means at 
its disposal, Unesco seeks 
first to meet the high priority 
needs of devastated countries. 
This emergency aid is also 
guided by the hope, which 
recent events have fully just- 
ified, that voluntary donorg in 
more fortunate countries will 
follow the example thus set. 
Over a period of three years, 
Unesco has devoted § 705.000

task is a gigantic one, Many

and women from ail over the 
world and of all creeds and 
political beliefs are working toge- 
ther in Europe this summer in 
special camps set up to aid the re- 
construction of war-stricken coun-

Some of these young people will

In most cases, volunteers in in-

free board and lodging, but they 
usually must pay their own travel 
expenses. Camp life is devoted to 
the work itself — generally from 
30 to 40 hours a week — and then

groups, goncerts amateur theatre 
projects, and a camp newspaper. 
The origin of work camps goes 
back to the first world war. At 
Cambridge, England, in 1915, there 
came into being a group of men 
and women who felt obliged, for 
their part, to meet the conflict in 
a different way. They formed 
themselves into what became 
known as the Fellowship of Recon- 
ciliation. At last, the war ended 
and, little by little, shattered con- 
tacts were restored. Finally in 1920, 
the International Fellowship of 
Reconciliation was formed at a 
meeting in Bilthoven, Holland. 
The Swiss representative at the 
meeting, Pierre Ceresole, was the 
son of a former president of the 
Swiss Confederation and a con- 
vinced pacifist. He volunteered at 
once to work in an international 
team doing reconstruction work in 
war-devastated areas. Thus Cere- 
sole « invented » the work camps, 
creating at the same time the Vo- 
luntary Service for Peace — known 
in French as the Service Civil 
This service, from 1920 to 1939, set 
up work camps on four continents. 
A Growing Movement 
L ITTLE by little, other groups 
and youth associations joined 
in, Camps were organized in 
France, in the United States, in 
England and in the Scandinavian 
countries. Each year the volun- 
teers multiplizd. In 1948 in Eu- 
iope and in the Western Hemi- 
sphere, 32 camps built playgrounds, 
youth centres and hostels; 48 built 
schools, hospitals and houses; 15 
constructed railways, roads and 
factories; 14 helped on farms and 
18 camps did social work. 
Unesco quickly recognized the 
importance of this movement in 
fostering international cooperation. 
In 1947, the organization coopera- 
ted in the operation of four camps 
and helped open a number of 
others. In 1948, Unesco brought 
together the organizers of work 
camps from nine countries in Pa- 
ris and a permanent committee 
was formed. This year, each of 
these camps will receive from 
Unesco a multilingual library on 
world affairs, the work of the Uni- 
ted Nations, and the history, geo- 
graphy and culture of various 
countries. Unesco representatives 
will visit some 32 camps. Unesco 
also helps to facilitate the granting 
of visas for volunteer workers 
moving from one country to 
another. 
This is Unesco’s role in a vigo- 
rous movement which, over the 
past 30 years, has attracted the 
world’s youth in increasing num- 
bers. ;

UNESCO FELLOWS 
REPORT PROGRESS 
Y NESCO fellow D. D. Xo- 
sambi, from India, stud- 
ying in the field of 
mathematical computing ma- 
chines in the United States, 
writes: «] have had a long 
gession with Professor Eins- 
tein, at his request. on certain 
ideas of mine which parallel 
hie own on the possible exten- 
sion of the theory of relati- 
vity. » 
Professor F. L. Polak (Ne- 
therlands), on completing his 
Unesco fellowship in Science 
and Social Development sta- 
tes: «It think I have made 
considerable progress through 
a critical study of American 
theoretical and applied social 
science. I intend to summarize 
these results next month in 
my inaugural addresg as pro- 
fessor of sociology at the Rot- 
terdam School of Economics, 
of which I will send you «a 
printed copy ». 
«Norwegian Film Director 
Nils Muller, Unesco-British 
Film fellow, reports: « The six 
monthg I spent in the British 
Film Studios were most pro- 
fitable to me. My studio 
observation work led me on 
to scores of ideas to introduce 
in the Norwegian {film pro- 
duction. Before I went to Lon. 
don, I hadn’t been directing 
any film for 18 months, owing 
to the crisis in production. On 
my arrival back, I immedia- 
tely started directing a feature 
film, and I'm now completing 
two short films. Later this year, 
I will direct three short films 
about the history of the town 
of Oslo. I feel much more sure 
of myself in my work since I 
came back from London; I 
knew much more about film- 
making than I did before I left 
Oslo. 
production in Norway will 
bring possibilities for me to 
make use of all the things I 
learned in the British Film 
Studios. » 
Text-book writer Herminia 
Ancheta (Philippines), eva- 
luating her Unesco fellowship 
experience. concludes: « Pro- 
gress in culture and education 
is most effectively accomplis- 
hed by an interchange of 
ideas. The spirit of friendship 
born of mutual collaboration 
and understanding bring about 
enduring world peace. All 
these. I believe, are some of 
the essential intangible values 
of a Unesco fellowship. » 
NOT ONLY 
FOR HIMSELF 
HESE are parts of a story 
wich is being unfolded in 
international cultural relations 
— the story of the Unesco 
fellow, a senior person who 
resumes his studies in his 
particular field of competence, 
which ig important and 
necessary to hig country. The 
absence of any direct personal 
motive is the hallmark of the 
Unesco fellow. of his pro- 
gramme of study, observation, 
visits, contacts and achiev- 
ment : a Unesco fellow 
studies not only for himself but 
for his country. 
During the three years of its 
existence, Unesco has béen 
concerned with the administra- 
tion of 262 fellowships alloca- 
ted to 31 Member States. The 
planning and administration 
of these fellowships affect and 
assist the component parts of 
Unesco’s Exchange of Persons 
programme -— the collection 
and dissemination of informa- 
tion on all types of internatio- 
nal study opportunities, and 
the promotional and advisory 
services to government and 
accredited agencies on their 
cultural exchange programmes. 
Unesco fellowships aim at 
pin-pointing and implementing 
Unesco’s on-going programme 
26 
and I hope that film 
in education, science and cul- 
ture in its Member States 
through the fellowships media. 
Unesco fellowships are there- 
fore offered to mature persons, 
in established positions, who 
can contribute to the recons- 
truction and dévelopment of 
the scientific, cultural «and 
educational life of their coun- 
try on their return from their 
period of study abroad. These 
principles apply both to 
Unesco - financed and to 
Unesco-sponsored fellowships, 
the latter being fellowships 
financed by government and 
accredited agencies, under the 
auspices of Unesco. Unesco’s 
fellowship programme, which 
was initiated as part of Unes- 
co’s assistance to war-devast- 
ated Member States. is now 
extended to aid under-deve- 
lopd areas, including trust ter- 
ritories. 
FOUR MAJOR 
SCHEMES 
INCE 1947, Unesco has 
administered four major 
schemes : 
a) 66 {fellowships financed 
by Unesco under the Unesco 
Reconstruction Fellowships 
Scheme, 
war-devastated Member States 
(Austria, China, Czechoslova- 
kia, Denmark. Greece, Hun: 
gary. Italy. the Netherlands, 
Norway, the Philippines and 
Poland), and concentrated on 
six of the specific fields that 
fall within the broad areas of 
education, science and culture 
with which Unesco is concer- 
ned, nemely : Science and So- 
cial Development, Cinema and 
Radio Education, Educational 
Problems of War- Affected 
Children, Librarianship, Edu- 
cational Administration and 
Art and Music Education. for 
study in the United States and 
Europe. 
b) 64 fellowships financed 
by the Canadian Council for 
Reconstruction through Unesco 
and offered to Austria, Bel- 
gium, British Colonial Territo- 
ries, China, Czechoslovakia, 
Denmark, France. Greece. Ita- 
ly, Luxembourg, the Nether- 
lands, Norway. the Philippines, 
Poland, and Ethiopia, under 
the auspices of Unesco. These 
fellowships give to specialists of 
these countries an opportunity 
to study in the fields of 
Science and Technology, Edu- 
cation, the Humanities, Mass 
Media, the Social Sciences, 
Public Aaniinistration and the 
Creative Arts, in which Canada 
offers oustanding faciiiiiss. 
c) 27 fellowships financed 
allocated to eleven. 
by the Lord Mayor of London’s 
Fund allocated to Austria. 
British Colonial Territories, 
Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hun- 
gary. Italy and Poland, which 
will enable sénior education- 
ists from these countries to 
study in England in the field 
of Educational Reconstruction. 
d) 20 fellowships financed 
by Unesco. In accordance with 
the resolution of the General 
Conference held in Beirut in 
November 1948, Unesco’s fellow- 
ship programme for 1948 has 
taken into consideration the 
atill existing needs of war- 
devastated Member States, as 
well as those of states in 
under-developed areas, and 
the fields of study have been 
planned as part of specitic 
Unesco projects in various 
parts of the world. With these 
principles in view, Unesco has 
created the 1949 Xlellowship 
Scheme, under which six 
1949 Reconstruction fellowships 
were cHered, one each, to Aus- 
 
{S iT PEACE 
tria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, 
Hungary, Italy and Poland. 
Four Middle East Cultural 
Liaison Fellowships were 
offered to Egypt, Iran, Iraq and 
Syria; three Mass Communi- 
cations Fellowships to Ecua- 
dor, Mexico and Peru: three 
Fundaméntal Education Fellow- 
ships to China, Colombia and 
Haiti, three Educational Mis- 
sion Fellowships to Aighanis- 
tan, the Philippines and Thai- 
land and ane Social Science 
Fellowship to India.

can assist in the promotion of

to know the total number of 
fellowships, scholarships and travel grants 
that are available in a country for scho-

want to know how the United Nations and 
its Specialized Agencies are using inter- 
national fellowship and travel study pro- 
grammes as an important tool for the 
technical, educational and scientific re- 
construction of war-devastated and less- 
developed countries ? ‘Do you want 
to know how to plan a fellowship

Consult «Study Abroad» — the 
Unesco register published in December 
1948 as the first international handbook 
providing details of available opportu- 
nities for international study and organ- 
ized arrangements made in this field. 
As a first attempt at a comprehensive 
mapping of a large and only partly 
charted sea, Volume I, which reports 
more than 15.000 fellowships donated 
by 37 countries, met with a striking 
reception from the public and owing to 
the big demand it was necessary to have 
two reprints made.

TUDY ABROAD. Volume II, 
is now in preparation and is sched- 
uled for publication and distribution in 
November 1949. This second volume 
is planned with a view to a more com- 
plete coverage of the fellowship field and 
with a broader scope to include infor- 
mation on all types of international edu- 
cational exchange. Running into 
pages, it reports the movement of more 
than 100.000 persons organized by over 
a thousand agencies in many different 
kinds of educational travel and exchange. 
The Handbook is divided into four ma- 
jor sections on fellowships, youth ex- 
change, teachers exchange and workers 
exchange. 
Section | reports on international 
fellowships, scholarships and related 
opportunities. Reports have been recei- 
ved from 42 countries, all the United 
Nations and Specialized Agencies, and 
international (private) organizations. The 
national programmes, as reported, are 
“more complete and mformative than 
those in Volume I. For instance, India 
has now reported its large annual go- 
vernmental overseas scholarship pro- 
gramme. Latin America will be repre- 
sented by at least eight countries. Fellow- 
ship programmes of stern European 
countries will, it is hoped, be more fully 
reported, and North American univer- 
sities have sent data on a great many 
more fellowships than previously. 
Periodic publication of this informa- 
tion makes for an increase in the number 
and quality of candidates applying for 
these opportunities to go and study 
abroad. It suggests to prospective donors 
areas in which new programmes might 
usefully be developed and brings into 
perspective possible overlappings of em- 
hasis, and areas of outstanding need. 
fn assembling all this information in one 
publication, Unesco is able to make more 
widely known the considerable invest- 
ment made by less developed countries 
in international training facilities for 
their nationals and similar facilities made 
available to them by them more developed 
countries. «Study Abroad» will be an 
important tool in the planning of the 
United Nations technical assistance pro- 
gramme for less developed countries, and 
in extending Unesco’s advisory services 
to member states and agencies operating 
in this field. 
Movements 
of Young People 
oy ECT ION II reports on mternational 
educational exchange movements of 
young people. Going beyond the purely 
cacademicy field, Unesco organized an 
enquiry into programmes of exchanges, 
travel and visits of young people — that 
is, persons under 25 years of age — be- 
ween countries for educational and cul- 
tural purposes. As a beginning, the 
investigation was conducted through field 
visits to nine European countries and by 
correspondence with two other countries. 
Volume II will include the results of 
this first investigation with regard to the 
various types of exchanges of young 
people, such as school trips, private vi- 
sits, organized tours and youth organiza- 
tion exchanges; it will be the first au- 
thoritative listing of 150 organizations 
with their addresses in the 11 countries 
surveyed. This section records that in 
1948 65.000 young persons travelled un- 
der programmes organized by national 
and international agencies in Il coun- 
tries. : 
Section III reports on interchange 
schemes of schoolteachers and professors 
petween countries. Unesco’s first enquiry 
into programmes of teacher exchange 
shows a striking amount of activity in 
this field and assembles for the first time 
a world picture of this type of inter- 
change, including names and addresses 
of 50 agencies sponsoring 3.000 exchan- 
ges. Unesco is planning to develop this 
enquiry and investigate possibilities of 
setting up machinery for the organization 
of exchanges on a wider international 
scale, 
Exchange of Workers 
Gy ECTION IV reports on workers 
~ international exchanges. In this field 
Unesco has maintained close co-opera- 
tive relations with the International Labour 
Organisation. The I.L.O. has underta- 
ken an enquiry into the international 
movement of trainees and apprentices for 
training and practical experience, the 
results of which are recorded in this 
section. Unesco has circulated to 1ts 
Member States a questionnaire on sche- 
mes for the international movement of 
agricultural and industrial workers for 
general educational and cultural pur- 
poses. Reports on these schemes, where- 
by workers in industrial, commercial 
or agricultural employment travel to 
another country for a certain period 
of time to enlarge their general know- 
ledge of the culture, history and/or lan- 
guage of that country, to study welfare 
and trade union organisation or for fra- 
ternal trade union or international study 
purposes in general, have been received. 
Abcut 2C00 training and educational 
exchange opportunities organised by 100 
agencies are recorded. Unesco, in colla- 
boration with the 1.L.O., is developing 
plans to extend the area of internationa 
educational exchange available to wor- 
kers. 
«Study Abroad», through the compre- 
hensive listing of agencies and institu- 
tions operating in this field, enables them 
to establish contact with one another, 
to coordinate and correlate their pro- 
grammes acd promote the establishment 
of new programmes.

Some of those invited to take part 
in the discussicns come with long ex- 
perience in the field of international 
cultural relations. They include: M. 
Marcel Abraham, head of the Cultural 
Relations department of the French Mi-

cof the Scientific and Cultural Depart- 
ment of the Norwegian Ministry of 
Church and Education. Dr. Girous, of

President of the Institute of Interna- 
tional Education in New York. 
Some of these experts are from coun- 
tries or agencies that have embarked 
cnly recently on this type of activity. 
cr whose programmes have been con- 
siderably expanded during the post-war 
years. Among them are experts from 
the United Nations, the Internationai

be represented are: The British Com- 
mittee for the Interchange of Teachers

E.A. Ford): The International Fede- 
ration of Workers’ Educational As- 
sociations (by its President, Mr. E.

barriers to the movement of per- 
sons, such as shortage of foreign ex- 
change, high costs of transportation,

A statistical commentary has been 
prepared by the Secretariat on existing 
cpportunities for international study as 
reported in Volume 1 of «Study 
Abroad». While this survey makes no 
claim to being. complete, nevertheless 
the commentary represents an initial at- 
tempt to analyze the returns compara-

conclusions reached should stimulate 
discussions on ways of co-ordinating 
existing programmes and promoting 
further opportunities in areas of espe- 
cial need.

of international fellowships, suggests 
ways in which study and travel grants 
may be used as a means cf promoting

been prepared on the exchange of youth 
werkers and teachers, fields to which 
Unesco has this year extended its col- 
lection of information and promotio- 
nal work. 
Discussions will cover the role of the 
and its Specialized 
Agencies, governments and private agen-

### 74103: The Outlook for social science

THE OUTLOOK FOR 
SOCIAL SCIENCE 
By Dr. Arthur Ramos, Head of the Department 
of Social Sciences 
I is perhaps rather early for me to have formed any definite 
impressicns about the Department of Social Sciences, for 
I tock up my post as Head of that Department only 
two weeks ago. 
[ found the Department carrying out plans and programmes 
for which a whole team of specialists and other qualified people, 
devoting their best energies and abilities to the work, is required. 
My first task will naturally be to help in carrying on these 
activities. 
I have observed that Unesco’s Department of Social Sciences 
is fostering three of the principal social sciences : Sociology. 
Political Science and Social Psychology. 
Cultural Anthropology has not yet found its place in the 
Department's programme. Admittedly, in the « Tensions » 
prcject, a few problems relating to races and minorities are 
being tackled, but no regular attention has yet been given to 
the special prcblems of Man himself. 
THE BACKWARD PEOPLES 
I N my opinion, the study of this problem should be among 
the most important of the activities of the Department of 
Social Sciences. First of all, a general study should be made 
of the living conditions and the indigenous civilization of the 
backward peoples in their native places throughout the world ; 
it would then be possible to consider them in comparison with 
the dominant cultures. In other words : a study of the life and 
culture of non-European peoples considered in relation to the 
decisive factors of European civilization. 
In this connexion, a matter which I think Unesco should 
raise in its Department of Social Sciences is the question of the 
assimilation of the Indian and Negro peoples of the New 
World and of their introduction to our culture. 
Unesco’s work in this direction should be tied in with the 
activities already being carried on by certain institutions such 
as the Institutq Indigenista Interamericano in Mexico. the Afro- 
American Institute in Cuba and others. 
Many questicns involve more than mere listing of the data 
of the problem, and I should be glad if we could employ our 
hearts as well as our brains to find solutions for the many 
difficulties which confront a large part of mankind, principally 
the so-called primitive peoples or the backward, oppressed or 
« marginal » folk who have not yet received the benefits of 
civilization. 
UNESCO PLANS 
draft Code of Policies, 
designed to furnish the 
necessary link between 
the general principles set 
forth in Unesco’s Constitution 
and the detailed resolutions in 
the annual programmes, has 
recently been adopted by the 
Executive Board and is to be 
submitted to the Fourth 
Session of the General Confe- 
rence for approval. Directives 
VII to X in this Code specify 
the Organization's aims, with 
particular reference to the 
social sciences, scientific know- 
ledge, intellectual exchanges, 
and fellowships for travel and 
research, in order to develop 
between the peoples, « in 
mutual respect for their 
several cultures, the conscious- 
. ness of human solidarity ». 
Directive VIII runs as follows: 
« Unesco will seek to improve 
and make better known the 
metheds and findings of the 
Social ‘Sciences; and, in 
particular, their possible con- 
tribution to the development 
cf international co-operation 
snd understanding.» 
NEED FOR 
PUBLICITY 
ITH this in mind, the Se- 
cretariat has given at- 
tenticn to one of tha questions 
most vitally affecting the pro-

### 74105: UNESCO plans world census of works on social science

of Works on 
cation are very nearly indissoci- 
able, as has been said. While, 
in most countries, industrial 
production has now reached a 
high level in comparison with 
the pre-war figures (as high 
as 150 %), the same cannot, 
unfortunately, be said of 
scientific output — that is, the 
publication of works setting 
out the results cof research. In 
humanistic studies, unpublish- 
ed work might, for all that is 
known of it, never haves been 
done. The situation of theses 
for the doctorate, particularly 
theses on literature and 
science, is important, for they 
constitute a considerable pro- 
portion of learned work on 
those subjects. 
The result of such works, 
not being printed is, firstly, 
that students may deal with 
subjects which have already 
been studied by others in 
universities or faculties -else- 
where and, secondly, that re-- 
search workers and specialists 
are no lenger able to obtain 
the documents and works they 
require from libraries, In 
many cascss, the originals 
themselves have been lost as 
a result of the war, and the 
typed copies have been scatte- 
tered or have disapparead com 
pletely. Some people object 
that most cof these studies are 
cf little scientific value, but 
what argument can be put for- 
ward when we think of those 
remarkable works or those 
writings of eminent professors 
for which no philanthropic 
publisher cculd be found? To 
take a concrete example, we 
need hardly remind the reader 
that such a work as Bergson’s 
«Essai sur les données immé- 
diates de la conscience» was a 
thesis for a doctorate. Wha? 
would happen to advance of 
knowledge if such works had 
of the present-day scien- 
tific world that the natu- 
ral scientists— physicists, bio- 
logists, astronomers and others 
-—are thoroughly well organi- 
sed internationally while the so- 
cial scientists—whose very study 
is how people live together— 
have formed hardly any inter- 
national associations. This 1s 
the more strange since one of 
the principal instruments of 
work in the Social Sciences is 
the comparative method: the 
process of setting side by side 
similar social phenomena deve- 
loping under widely different 
conditions. The international 
field, the richest of all areas 
for the social scientist using the 
ccmparative method, has hardly 
been much more than surveyed. 
In recent months, however, 
four of the principal Social 
Science disciplines, meeting un- 
der the aegis of Unesco. have 
proceeded to set up internatio- 
nal asscciations. The first of 
these to come into active exis- 
tence is the International Eco- 
nomic Association. According to 
the draft statutes previously 
adopted, the International Eco- 
nomic Association would come 
into existence as soon as five 
National Associations had de- 
clared their adherence. 
At the meeting of the Inte- 
rim Executive Committee of 
the Association held 15-16 July,

THE DANGEROUS 
GAP 
IEWED from the inter- 
national level, this gap 
seems even more disastrous 
for the develcpment of inter- 
change between the peoples, 
for it preserves impassable 
barriers between specialists 
belonging to different nations. 
The exchange of printed bcoks 
provides one possibility of 
international contact, and the 
spread of culture is one means, 
with the free flow of ideas 
and knowledge, of persuading 
the peoples of their sacred 
duty to help one another, Be- 
fcre we consider means of re- 
moving obstacles to the free 
flew of information and ideas, 
should ws not begin by 
correcting the insufficiency of 
infcrmation itself? Article 19 
of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, in laying 
down the right of every 
individual to freedom of op'nion 
and expression, also includes 
the right «to :eek, receive and 
impart information and ideas 
through any media and re- 
gardless of frontiers». 
REMEDY FOR 
SITUATION 
HAT then are the 
remedies? The Director- 
General of Unesco has decided 
to take a preliminary census, 
confined to works on social 
cciences which have been 
presented to a university or 
academic jury since 1 January 
1940. For this purpose, 2a 
letter has keen sent to all 
Member States, asking them 
to communicate to the Inter- 
national Collaboration Division 
of the Department of Social 
Sciences, if pcssible before 31 
December 1949, lists of such 
works—drawn up for each 
university, institute of higher 
educaticn or academy-—inclu- 
ding the author’s name. the full 
title and the number of pages 
cf the work, mention of the 
degreaz obtained, and, if any, 
the prize or honours given, and 
lastly, the place where a copy 
of the work can be obtained. 
It is of direct interest to every 
university that a list of such 
works should be published, 
and, in some countries, the 
Mistry of Education has al- 
ready arranged fcr the 
centralization of such infor- 
maticn on a national scale. The 
census should make it possible 
to draw up, first of all, an 
international index system, 
with an analytical catalogue 
arranged by subjects. 
Several different possibilities 
can later be considersd—if the 
necessary frnds are granted; 
fcr instance, the best of these 
studies might be reprcduced 
on microfilm for supply to all 
specialized libraries, or printad 
by the way of special grants- 
in-aid. 
In this way, we shall be 
able to pursue one of Ure:co’s 
fundamental purpsses — to 
assist in maintaining and 
diffusing knowledge by initia- 
ting methods of international 
co-gperation calculated to give 
the rveovle of all countries 
access to the printed and 
putliched materials produced 
by any of them, and by 
promcting the international 
interchange of scientific 
information.

held a round table conterence 
on: «long-term economic pro- 
blems of international balances. 
It is hoped that such round 
table discussicns. which are to 
be among the principal activi- 
ties of the Association, will pro- 
vide authorative statements as 
to the present situation of eco- 
nomic thinking on some of the 
outstanding questions of inter- 
national importance. 
As such, the reports of these 
discussions may prove of value 
not only to research workers 
but also to those engaged in the 
teaching of advanced economics 
throughout the world, and to 
practical administrators con- 
cerned with economic policy. 
Ancther notable activity of the 
Association, it is anticipated. 
will be to assist national eco- 
rcmic bodies to come into 
being in the many countries 
where at present no such orga- 
nisation exists. 
The sociclogists and political 
scientists are following hard 
upon the heels of the econo- 
mists in organising internatio- 
nally. In September 1949 an 
international meeting of socio- 
logists at Oslo will be taking 
the final steps to constitute an 
International Scciological Asso- 
ciation, while a meeting of po- 
litical scientists in Paris during 
the same month is expected to 
set up an International Politi- 
cal Science Association. An In- 
ternational Comparative Law 
Association is also in process of 
formaticn under Unesco’s aus- 
pices. 
Help from Unesco 
AS part of this function of 
promoting international ac- 
tivity in the Social Sciences. 
Unesco is also giving assistance 
to social sciences associations 
already in existence. The In- 
ternational Studies Conference 
is hclding a plenary session in 
Paris, 29 August - 3 September, 
part of which will be devoted 
to Unesco's work. The Confe- 
rence of the International 
Union for the Scientific Study 
of Population Problems, which 
is being held in Geneva, 27 Au- 
gust - 5 September, is examining 
on behalf of Unesco the pro- 
blems involved in the cultural 
assimilation of immigrants. 
The International Association 
for Applied Psychology, which 
is holding its ninth congress 
in Berne, 12 - 17 September, 
is likewise giving special at- 
tention to the field covered by 
the Tensions affecting Interna- 
‘tional Understanding Project. 
In this work of facilitating 
and enccuraging international 
organisation on the part of the 
Social Sciences, Unesco is 
pursuing one of its principal li- 
nes of pclicy: to give every pos- 
.ible assistance and incentive to 
social scientists everywhere to 
direct their efforts upen the key 
prcblem of the age—how the 
peoples of the world ean learn 
to live together in mutual help- 
fulness and peace.

### 74106: Half the world's population is illiterate

HALF THE FE y Message from Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, 
- WORLD’ S wo | Dffectar Garey i Unesco, § the Seminar on 
POPUL ATION Illiteracy in the American Continent, meeting 
IS ILLITERATE rn fember 1949. 
  
at Quitandinha, Brazil, from 27 July to 3 Sep- 
~. OU are meeting Lo consider 
cne of the most disquieting 
problems of our century. I 
mean the illiteracy of 
millions of beings whom 
we call in all seriousness 
cur brothers — as indeed 
they are by na‘ure and potential 
akility — and on whose shoulders we 
lay a burden of civic duties no 
different from those that we ourselves 
accept. Yet despite the right of all 
men to culture, these, our brothers, 
remain under the ycke of ignorance. 
They are excluded by poverty from 
that equality which is theirs by law. 
They are victims of g situation which 
we have done nothing to bring about, 
but fer which, knowing and admitting’ 
it as we do, we must assume the 
responsibility if we take no practical 
and effective steps first to lessen, then 
tc remedy, and finally to abolish ths 
evil through our combined efforts and 
our unanimous will. 
On 10 december 1948, at the Gzaneral 
Assembly of the United Nations, the 
representatives of all the American 
countries adopted a Declaration, of 
which article 28 reads as follows : 
« Everyone has the right to educa- 
tion. Education shall te free, at least 
“in the elementary and fundamental 
stages. Elementary education shall be 
comrulsory. Techn cal and professional 
educaticn shall be made generally 
availlable and higher educaticn shall 
te equally accessible to all cn the basis 
cf merit ». 
Brave words. But how mich ara 
they worth, if, in the Latin American 
community alone, millions cannot read 
them ? If the rest of the world is 
added, the problem becomes even mora 
desperate : half the world’s population 
is illitrate. In this age of aeroplanes, 
radio and nuclear physics, half the 
human race has still not learnt to 
read and write, When we speak of 
Human Rights, we shall do well to 
tear in mind that, as things stand, 
cne human bzing in every two is 
unable to claim respect for thos: 
Rights in writing. 
Nor is this the whole picture : thea 
incidence of illiteracy is far from uni- 
form ; in some regions there are no 
illiterates but ‘n cthers cnly a tiny 
minority of the population enjoys the 
rrivilege of bzing able to read. There 
are great areas where men and 1wo0- 
men can do nc more than scrawl, at 
the fcot of the crders they receive or 
cf the commitments they enter into, 
the symbol of a great martyrdom : a 
crass. 
The Defences of Peace 
NESTO, which was created to 
| build the defences of peace in 
the minds of men, must ponder 
on the nature of the peace 
which it is ta prepare and stvengthen 
Is it the peace of slaves, who know 
not bu: to yield ? Or is it the peace 
of men, of men made free by aware- 
nes: of their destiny, and by intelligent 
and active sharing in a common 
literty, to redeem mankind ? 
Without universal education the 
ideal cf freedom is mo more than an 
unputd debl, « dangled deceit. The 
prcblem of illiteracy is of course one 
cf educaticn. But it is more than this: 
it is a universal tragedy which affects 
us all directly and which is at once 
eccnomic, pclitical and social in 
character. 
Some may think it cf little im- 
portance. There is, they may say, 
little relation ketween the cultural 
ievel of a country and the numbear of 
its people able to read and write at 
any given moment. There were more 
illiterates in ‘he France of Louis XIV 
than in the France of Napcleon III, 
yet the age of Racice, Pascal 
Moliére was not on that account 
inferior to tha: of Thiers, Renan and 
Victor Huge, There was perhaps more 
reading in the Spain of Isabella II 
than in 16th century Spain, Yet the 
latter pericd cannct boast a poet such 
as Lore de Vega, a playwright such 
as Tirso de Molina, or storyteller such 
as Cervantes. There were moe illite- 
rates in Shakespeare's than in 
Dicken's England ; yet neither did 
diplomas add lustre to Pickwick’s ad- 
ventures, nor did the lack of schocls 
and 
I would pot warn you against 
ssphistries so glaring, were it not daily 
arparent that minds which seem the 
keenest, and hearts which seem the 
scundest, are being infected by the 
- false notion that progress is a material 
investment, a kind cf merchandise, and 
that with a little capital and a hand- 
ful of skilled technicians we can save 
whcle centuries of time in our fight for 
civilizaticn. There can be few atti- 
tudes mere dangercus than that cf 
cne whose vanity and superficiality 
leads him to think that the mere pur- 
chase ¢f a gramophone and a plenti- 
ful collection cf reccrds makes him 
the equal cf a Beethcven or a Bach. 
No one, however wealthy, is rich 
enough to purchase czither the title 
deeds of genuine bnrogress or its 
effective enjoyment. Peoples, like 
individuals, must choose one of two 
courses : either they may copy the 
klue-grint cf an artificial type of econo- 
mic development, which must prove 
transitory and vain ; ¢r they must pro- 
gress by their cwn efforts, tackling 
each problem from its bz2ginning, 
which calls akove all for humility and 
There are great areas where men and 
women can de no move than scrawl, at 
the fect of the ordexs they wreceive ox 
of the cammitments hey entex inte, the 
symbol of a great martyrdom : a cress. 
deny laurels to the author of The 
Tzmpest, 
Such arguments put the question in 
a false light, and those who use them 
are equivocating. Egually misleading 
is the assertion that in scme ccmmuni- 
ties the illiterates are to be nreferred 
as human beings to those who have 
been through the schools ; that the 
value cf giving an illiterate the power 
to read what may not have been worth 
writing is dubicus ; or, as stated ty a 
great South American, that men of 
America need the alphabet less than 
they need the plcugh and the hammer. 
All these excuses —or, if you will, 
these apologies for illiteracy — imply 
some criticism of the kind of iife that 
awaits the ignorant when, though still 
unlettered in the strict sense, they are 
no longer illiterate. Such criticisms 
may seem plausible. But do they 
really detract from the importance and 
urgency of the question ? Do they not 
denote a paradoxical superficiality ? 
Far from facing the problem sguarely. 
do they not deliberately elude it? 
The mere fact that illiterates exist, 
who gre harder-working and plsasan- 
ter to deal with than university 
graduates. does not mean that 
universities are necessarily havens of 
laziness or bitterness; the fact that 
rlcughs and hammers are necessary 
does not mean that books or news- 
papers are not; the fact that there 
were many illiterates in the years 
when gifted writers composed Don 
Quixote or the alexandrines of « Phé- 
dre » gave no reason, still less 
encouragement, to Cervantes {0 invent 
the adventures cf the Knignt of the 
Lions, or to Racine to describe the 
fateful loves of the stepmother of 
Hippolytus. 
perseverance -- and, in a word, for 
education at all possible levels, 
Scheme for Technical 
Assistance 
OU have probably already 
heard somz comment cn the 
Scheme for Technical Assis- 
tance evolved jcintly by the 
United Nations and the Specialized 
Agencies. Unezco shared in the pre- 
paration of this plan, and its Gene- 
ral Conference will next September 
decides what vbrogramme and budget 
should be adopted to afford technical 
aid to under-developed countries from 
1650 onward, 
We shall bring to this vast under- 
taking our keenest enthusiasm and 
our best endeavours. If we obtain 
the approval of th2 General Confe- 
rence, we shall, in agreement with 
the countries concerned, investigate 
their most pressing needs with the 
chject of sending them missions, teach- 
ears and advisers whose essential task 
will be to create, without detriment 
to the cultural individuality of the 
country, more favourable conditions 
for the development of ‘echnical edu- 
cation and :cientific investigation. 
I an ccnvinced of the benefits 
which this plan offers to many of the 
world’s peoples; but it is alsc my 
belief that none of those advantages 
will be lasting unless a high priority 
is given to education. Hence the vital 
importance which I, as Director- 
General of Unesco, attach to the work 
you are now undertaking. 
The teaching of reading and writing 
is not an end in itself; it is, however, 
a means to an end and an essential 
rart cof any well-conceived and well- 
balanced plan of sceial advancement. 
Any plan for technical assistance 
must rest — often directly — upon a 
vigerous educaticnal campaign ; and 
where illiterates are mumerous, any 
educational campaign must presuppose 
an energelic struggle against illitera- 
cy. 
What Illiteracy Means 
CME years befcre 1 entered the 
Crganizaticn to which I now 
kzlong, I took part, in my own 
country, in a national literacy 
campaign. During the examination 
period, 1 vizited a rural community 
which the inspectors had described to 
me as one cf the keenest and most 
determined c¢f the campaign, In a 
strawthatched hut, a girl vilunteer 
was teaching reading and writing to 
a group of peasant women. For black- 
bcard shes had a yard or two of 
shaktby dark ¢ilcloth. After the 
learners had read me a few pas- 
sages, 1 asked one of them, the 
coldest, to write out two or three 
sentences which I picked from the 
primer the teacher was using, With- 
cut hesitation she wrota out the 
words I dictated. 
But I was disturbed, less by her 
spelling mistakes than by a certain 
machine-like swiftness which suggest- 
ed the mctions of an automatcn. 
I askad her to write her own name, 
and :aw at once that this was an 
untried task for hand and mind alike. 
She tock the chalk hesitantly, and 
very slowly, letter by letter, began to 
trace her name. When she had finish- 
ed she read it out several times under 
her breath. Then suddenly, to every- 
kody’s surprise, she burst into tears. 
There was certainly no bitternass in 
that weeping ; its real cause was sure- 
ly the surprise of finding her real 
self, suddenly, after so many years of 
ignorance, during which that, self had 
been absant in exile. 
In those few shaky, ill-formed 
strokes, she saw herself more clearly 
than in a mirror—kumble and obe- 
dient, bcwed down by her poor past. 
And were not those triumphant tears 
a lesson to us all, ard an immense 
forgiveness ? 
Time presses. We cannct leave 
millicns ¢f men and women injustly 
isolated and cut off-from our life be- 
cause the soil of their mind is untilled. 
In ccming to this Seminar, you, the 
teachers cf America, have undertaken 
a responsiblity to which I pay tribute 
with respect and gratitude. 
May your work te crowned with 
success. But how can we doubt of 
success, when the “ask is so ncble and 
you meet in this magnificent land of 
Brazil, of which Stefan Zweig has 
said in a famous passage: « Thz 
bountifulnes: of life itself causes free- 
dem to flourish ».

### 74107: Arts and letters: UNESCO's programme

### 74089: Children's communities

ARTS AND LETTERS UNESCO'S 
Fall Unesco’s activities, those 
connected with Arts and 
Letters, are. if not the most 
difficult, at least the most delicate. 
They are based on a fundamental 
tenet of modern thought — that 
appreciation of art is essential to the 
mental and moral health of everyone. 
Any weakening of artistic feeling in 
mankind in general indicates a decline 
in the moral sense and prepares the 
way for outbreaks of violence. Only 
men endowed with some imagination 
and, I might almost say. some creat- 
ive imagination — which. fortunately, 
is within the reach of all — can 
understand others; if the artistic 
seno2 were to disappear fromm mankind 
or were to become the monopoly of a 
jealous and exclusive caste, the world 
would be a desert of dreary crime and 
bloodthirsty folly. 
The preservation of the artistic 
sense where it now flourishes, and its 
dissemination and fostering where 
poverty, ignorance or the mechaniza- 
tion of life have choked it, are closely 
bound up with Unesco's purposes. It 
is principally through their art that 
the peoples draw close to one another 
and reach intuitive understanding; and 
to induce them to know and love their 
fellows through art, in a world in 
which artistic appreciation has become 
general, is to induce them to know 
and love what is deepest and most 
characteristic in their fellows, The 
difficulties are great. "While, on the 
one ‘hand, Unesco’'s efforts must be 
directed towards the mass of ordinary 
people, in order to prepare them to 
receive the message of creative minds, 
and thus come under the heading of 
dissemination, in other respects, the 
Organization's activities border on 
creation itself. We know that no rules 
can be laid down for creative activity 
and that, in every age, artists have 
asked only to be left to workj in 
peace. But there would be serious 
gaps in Unesco’s work if the Organi- 
zation could not secure their willing 
co-operation. 
Unesco’s Tasks 
Unesco is already doing much to 
popularize art. We cannot give even 
a scanty idea of that work in a few 
lines; let it suffice to say that one 
of Unesco’'s most important tasks in 
the field of literature is to encourage 
and promote the translation and publi- 
cation of the classics of every coun- 
try’s literature, particularly in lan- 


### 74108: Art in general education

ART IN GENERAL EDUCATION 
E are all artists in varied 
\ X / degrees. For life itself is an 
art which we practise well 
or indifferently, in ways that are 
routine or inspired. But every- 
where and always, in primitive and 
civilized communities, in prehisto- 
ric as in modern times, some 
people have been recognised as 
more artistically endowed than 
others, as having such skills and 
awareness as to mark them out as 
specialists. 
They are the avowed artists. 
Consequently, and unfortunately, 
there has been a complementary 
tendency to assume that those 
with less obvious: artistic abilities 
were not capable of any kind of 
creative expression; they had «no 
eye for painting, no ear for mu- 
sic». Increasingly, this opinion is 
being discredited. 
In the process of initiation to 
life which is commonly known as 
education, the arts in various ti- 
mes and places have received 
greater or lesser emphasis accord- 
ing to the points of view of those 
charged with educational direction. 
Until quite recently, in most of the 
europeanized systems of education, 
the main emphasis was placed on 
intellectual and physical training, 
with the arts relegated to a less 
important position as decorative 
frills cn the borders of the serious 
business of rational and practical 
learning, the basic grounding in 
the three R’s and the hard grind- 
ing of facts. 
Education through Art 
CWADAYS, as a consequence 
of many pioneer experiments 
and researches in the past fifty 
years and of increased psycholo- 
gical knowledge, many educators 
in many places doubt the real 
effectiveness of rigidly exclusive 
systems of intellectual education; 
some educators in some places are

guages in which they have never 
hitherto appeared. For instance, many 
masterpieces from other cultures will 
be introduced into the Arab world. In 
this way, it will be possible to incor- 
porate in the life of every people 
vital elements which have so far been 
lacking. The same purpose is served 
by travelling exhibitions of colour 
reproductiones of masterpieces of paint- 
ing; thanks to such reproductions, 
which have reached a very high degree

Two Fronts 
Unesco’s work is always carried on, 
however, on two fronts. Every one of 
"its activities must contribute, directly

but each of 
is also designed to 
or indirectly, to the 
mankind as a whole;

“Museums are becoming an increasingly important factor in the education of adults 
and children alike”. : 
putting more emphasis on methods 
of education which include the 
arts, whilst a few educators in a 
1ew places advocate and practice 
entire education through art. For 
them art is nct just a part of 
education; it is the means of edu- 
cation. 
Rehind such changes in educa- 
ticnal practice, there is usually a 
feeling that one of the chief cau- 
ses of individual unhappiness and 
general unrest in the contampo- 
rary world is to be found in those 
processes of civilization and sys- 
tems of education which tend to 
classify and divide, to oppose in- 
tellect and intuition, to separate 
work from play, to offset carning 
a living against enjoyment of lei- 
sure. At this critical phase of hu- 
man evolution, when in science, 
economics, religion, and politics 
the trend appears to be towards 
split and fission, dualism and op- 
position, ordinary men and women 
sense the deepest need of spiritual 
and moral values to balance in- 
tellect. They need to live by feel- 
ing as much as by thought: they 
require ritual and pageantry as 
much as food and knowledge. We 
must then recognize the value of 
the arts to unite and harmonize, 
not merely recuperating sick 
minds and bodies, although the 
therapeutic power of art is indis- 
putable, but exprescsing whole and 
zestful health. 
It is in this light that the pro- 
ject for Art in General Education 
takes its place within the wider 
Unesco task of seeking to unite 
the peoples of the world by means 
of greater knowledge and under- 
standing. Art is often described as 
the universal language, but this 
is an obvious half-truth which we 
accept with reservation knowing 
well that the arts of one people 
need interpretation to another and 
that each different kind of :art 
  
requires some measure of techni- 
cal knowledge for its full appre- 
ciation. 
A Process of Creation 
Ww HAT is in fact universal is the 
process of creating art. It is 
for this reason that the Unesco 
project is more concerned with 
educational means than with ar- 
tistic ends, seeking to explore by 
research and enquiry what is being 
done in various parts of the world 
by all kinds of people in the fields 
of visual arts and crafts, music, 
dance. drama and creative writing 
in the domains of primary, secon- 
dary and adult education. Through 
the medium of a clearing house 
and in the pages of a quarterly 
bulletin entitled «Art and Educa- 
tion» this project serves to ex- 
change news and views of what 
is being done from one place to 
another, from individual to indi- 
vidual, from group to group, wi- 
thout seeking to impose or endorse 
any sectional style or theory. 
As the project develops it is in- 
tended to arrange for the mutual 
circulation of informative exhi- 
bitions, to encourage and, as far 
as possible, sponsor the exchange 
of sp:ccialists, teachers and stu- 
dents. In particular, since the ap- 
proach to the arts as a means of 
educaticn is still very much in the 
experimental stages in most coun- 
tries, it will be desirable to keep 
in close touch with new develop- 
ments and to foster special stu- 
dies and research. The possibility 
cf establishing an International 
Committee to further such deve- 
lopments is now under consider- 
ation. 
So it is that through the arts 
the defences of peace may be con- 
structed not only in the minds of 
men but frem their hearts and 
through their hands. 
  
must not forget that one of its duties 
is to bring to artists. as to all creative 
minds. a new hope and new influence, 
4 new persuasive force. Artists have 
too often tomented division and hat- 
red between men: and it would be 
sad if the development of the artistic 
sense among the common people 
resulted only in opening their minds 
to new notions of violence -— which 
is always a possibility. The present- 
day artist is conscious that, if his 
work cannot flourish as a part of 
international life but remains confined 
within the borders of a single nation, 
it has in it something ineffectual, al- 
most unreal. Artists of nations which 
are less favourably situated. whose 
art has difficulty in overstepping 
frontiers, are thus almost inevitably 
driven to confuse the radiating power 
of art with political might, and to 
encourage among their people either 
the suspicious isolation of those who 
turn their backs on the world, or the 
aggressive tendencies of those who 
would subjugate it. It is not for 
Unesco to offend artists by vain 
preaching, to which they would, in 
any case, remain deaf, but to bring 
them to live and act naturally as 
world citizens, so that the internatio- 
nal outlook may become second na- 
ture to them. The enquiry which 
Unesco io carrying out among artists 
throughout the world on the obstacles 
of every sort — political, economic, 
or moral — which deprive their art 
of complete freedom (an enquiry 
which may lead to practical results 
by the irresistible force of evidence 
alone) is, in our opinion, an instance 
of the unobtrusive work which 
Unesco can legitimately do to foster 
artistic creation. The ultimate aim of 
Unesco is to ensure that the defini- 
tion of artists as free citizens of a 
world which desires to be free, may 
be understood in the fullest sense and 
hecome an accepted truth. 


### 74109: The Museums Division

THE 
MUSEUMS 
DIVISION 
Ore of Unesco’s objects is io give @ 
fresh impulse to education and 
the spread of culture, to try to extract 
frem man the quintessence of his emo- 
tional and intellectual gifts so that 
he can use them creatively and 
constructively. 
Part of Unesco’s work in this sphere 
bears om museums which, Through 
the dirlay of objects, preserve, exhibit, 
explain and illustrate the record of 
all human activity, thus increasing 
man’s knowledge of himself and of 
the world in which he lives. 
The programme of the Museums 
and Historical Monuments Division 
covers museums of art, history, 
archaeology, ethnography and folklore, 
science and technological ‘nuseums, 
health museums, natural history 
museums, planetaria and botanical 
gardens, 
Unesco’s task is to consider these 
institutions from the standpoint of 
museography which covers the 
rroblems common to all museums 
— organization and administration, 
the preservation of collections, their 
installation, their display and, as a . 
logical consequence, their educational 
message. } 
Museums are qgssuming an ever 
greater place in school curricula, and 
becoming an increasingly important 
factor in the education of adults and 
children alike. 
It is this aspect of their work that 
rarticularly interests Unesco, for their 
value as repositories of knowledge is 
practically unlimited. They speak more 
elcquently even than books, and are 
hampered by no barriers of language. 
They are an ideal means of pro- 
moting friendship and understanding 
between the nations, and thus ad- 
vance Unesco’s main purpose. 
However, each must not work solely 
in its own sphere, Exchanges of 
infcrmation and views are essential 
It will be one of the tasks of the Divi- 
sicn to assemble and disseminate 
such information, cn the one hand, 
and especially, through the review 
«MUSEUM», and, on the other, 
through close co-operation with the 
cther prcgramme sections of Unesco, 
like those for Education, Fundamen.al 
Education, the Popularizaticn of 
Science, and sc forth. 
The International Council of 
Museums, which works in close co-Ope- 
ration with the Dwision, is the centrat 
agency fcr professional contacts. 
If, today, education is the basis cn 
which to build a more united world, 
culture is no less necessary if that 
world is to te harmonious and civilized.

### 74110: A Tribute to Frédéric Chopin

A TRIBUTE 
FREDERIC 
- CHOPIN 
REDERIC CHOPIN, the Polish composer whose work 
represents the acme of pianoforte composition, died 
in Paris on 17 October 1849, in an apartment in the 
Place Venddme. The first centenary of his death is being 
commemorated this year throughout the world, but on a 
particularly large scale in Poland, and in France. the country 
where he lived and became famous. 
Unesco could not let this centenary pass without paying 
its own tribute, and since the beginning of the year projects 
have been under preparation : 
(1) the foundation of two scholarships in Paris for young 
Polish composers. 
(2) the publication of a complete catalogue of the 
recordings of the works of Chopin. 
(3) the organization of a concert consisting of compositions 
specially written for the occasion by a number of ‘prominent 
living composers. 
SCHOLARSHIPS 
Th project entails the financial co-operation of the 
International Music Fund, of which Serge Koussevitsky, 
the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is 
the Chairman. Thanks to it, two young composers from 
Chopin's own country will come to Paris, as the master 
himself came in 1831, fo benefit from the wonderful environ- 
ment the city still provides for artists from all four corners 
of the earth. 
So far as Chopin is concerned, there are few other 
composers so many of whose works have been so 
frequently recorded and played, for that purpose, by 
so many different artists. Unesco has embarked on drawing 
up as complete a catalogue as possible of thes recordings. 
By the time this issue of the «Courier» goes fo press, this 
catalogue will have already appeared in the shape of a 
240-page volume edited by M. Armand Panigel, with an 
introduction and commentary by M. Marcel Beaufils. 
A CONCERT 
O' 3 October, two days before the closing of the 
Fourth General Conference of Unesco, there will be 
a concert at the Salle Gaveau, consisting of the first 
performance of "Homage to Chopin”, a series of ten pieces 
of chamber, vocal and instrumental music. These works have 
been specially written for the occasion at Unesco's request, 
in memory of Chopin, by the following composers : 
’ Bohuslav Martinu 
Andrzej Panufnik 
Florent Schmitt 
Jacques Ibert Alexandre Tansman 
G.-F. Malipiero Heitor Villa-Lobos. 
These masters of contemporary music, have expressed, in 
music, their admiration for the great Polish composer. The 
concert of 3 October is belng arranged in association with 
Radiodiffusion Francaise, and will be broadcast both in 
France and abroad, the following artists taking part : the 
pianists Hélene Pignaret and Arnaldo Estrella, the singer 
Iréne Joachim, the cellist Maurice Maréchal, the Calvet 
Quartet and the Marcel Couraud Choir.

LIBRARIES’ TASK IN COMMUNITY 
who work in public libra- 
ries have become dissatis- 
fied with their traditional pas- 
sive role of dispensers of books 
“when more active methods 
were obviously needed to help 
the average pérson meet the 
complex problems of to-day. 
Now many public libraries are 
taking increasing responsibili- 
ty for the continuing education 
of people in the communities 
they serve. They collaborate

EDUCATION 
This year Unesco’s work in 
this area is being carried out 
‘nainly through publications. 
One is a « Public Library Ma- 
rifesto », a brief statement in 
simple terms of the standards 
of service endorsed by Unesco. 
Printed as a leaflet and a pos- 
ter in six languages, it will 
be displayed and distributed 
by public libraries throughout 
the world. 
Ready for issue soon will be 
four books on basic public li- 
brary problems — the modern 
public library in the commu. 
nity, bringing service to people 
in outlying areas, work in 
adult education and the pro- 
fessional training of librarians.

these books should be very

others who are responsible for 
bringing effective public libra- 
ry service to the people,

ver all the various moral and 
material dfficulties with which 
the artists ‘of today may have 
to contend. It is intended to 
elucidate the facts. 
Apart from the examination 
itself, the Secretariat of Unesco 
is assembling the fullest possible 
information on the difficulties 
that the artist meets with to-day 
in the free performance of his 
function. The object here is 
to assemble facts of importance, 
official decuments and written 
information from artists themsel- 
ves, all of which will be 
brought to the knowledge of the 
rublic through a ktulletin pu- 
blished every two months. 
While, however, the exami- 
nation is designed to clarify the 
difficult problem of the free- 
dom of the artist in the modern 
world, Unesco does not intend 
to confine itself to mere theo- 
retical speculation. Such an 
examination, if it is to be of 
any use, must lead to concrete 
results. It must enable Unesco 
to present, to the Florence Ge- 
neral Conference, definite pro- 
jects that shall form a basis 
for action.

### IGNORE

  
L 
IGHT, wind, storm, the free 
elements of nature, are all 
universal and the same 
throughout the world. Whe- 
ther in the desolate wastes 
of the Arctic or the hot and steamy 
jungles of Africa, the virgin forest 
of the Amazon, the steppes of Sibe- 
ria or the savannas of Patagonia, the 
same phenomena move in the atmos- 
phere, giving it life, stirring it, warm- 
ing or chilling it, and giving it 
colour. 
Man, through his senses, interprets 
what he sees and feels in that light, 
then transforms it and fixes it in 
art — art which is more or less endur- 
ing according to the human warmth 
and the force of social significance 
with which he imbues that interpre- 
tation of nature and its phenomena. 
All the great civilizations of ancient 
times have understood this, from the 
primitive cultures of Mesopotamia 
and Egypt, India and China onwards. 
So, too, have the great corresponding 
civilizations of America, Mayan, 
Aztec and Inca. Thus, in all of them, 
we find an astonishing similarity of 
themes and symbolism in the major 
and minor arts of their peoples. 
A large expedition, organized and 
sponsored by the Mexican National 
Institute of Anthropology and the 
zation of the First Mayan Empire. 
The city of Palenque, rich in legen- 
dary ruins, was the abode of the 
chief Mayan nobles and priests, where 
they built their most sumptuous pal- 
aces and temples. 
PALENQUE 
DISCOVERIES 
HE expedition explored the 
| Temple of Laws and brought 
to light ancient reliefs and 
paintings. The Mexican 
archaeologists discovered that these 
‘paintings in the temple were 
superimposed on others, and 
they finally found 20 distinct layers 
bearing witness to different eras in the 
flowering of Mayan culture. The 
tombs of the Mayan nobles buried 
in Palenque have yielded to Mexican 
historians a number of pottery spe- 
cimens and symbolic statuettes. And 
it is in those objects — the expres- 
sion of what might be called a mi- 
nor art — that we may see the first 
signs of what has been the distin- 
guishing characteristic of Mexican 
«civilization up to the present day: 
the awe and gratitude of the people 
of Mexico for the splendid panorama, 
bathed in so rare a light, that lies 
around them.

PAPER AND STONE 
r T° was that light of the Valley 
| of Mexico, at once harsh and 
pellucid, which, in an Aztec era 
before the time of Cortes, shone 
on the pretty fretted paper hanging 
on the stone statues in the temples. 
The Conquistadores were in fact ama- 
zed to see the stone gods adorned 
with ornaments and streamers of pa- 
per. Paper and stone. Two such dif- 
ferent things — the one frail, requir- 
ing refined and delicate sensibility; 
~- the other solid, suitable for great en- 
during masses. Yet the union of these 
two substances perfectly symbolizes 
Mexican art: the dualism of the 
grandiose and the ephemeral. 
Mexican native paper is an impor- 
tant cultural factor in the country’s 
history. Witchcraft and idolatry, to- 
temism and ancestor-worship still 
endure almost unchanged and linked, 
in many forms of art, with paper.

### 74114: Art in Central America

ART IN CENTRAL AMERICA. ._...... 
Before the time of Cortes, the Aztecs 
used to adorn those taking part in 
their solemn processions with gar- 
lands of painted paper. It was also 
their custom to deck with paper robes 
‘the bodies of the illustrious dead, 
whether they were warriors slain in 
battle or powerful merchants. 
ART AND FEATHERS 
Ts same luminous air which 
stirred the ornamental pa- 
pers, blew from hill to hill 
and from valley to valley; it passed 
into the Indians’ lungs, to issue forth 
in music played on primitive flutes; 
and in that clear air beautiful multi- 
coloured birds would fly, covered 
with delicate plumage. The plumage 
was used by the ancient Mexicans to 
produce another great and character- 
istic form of art—that of the 
feather-worker, shaping the long gai- 
ly-coloured plumes into ornaments, 
devices and crests. The wind itself 
was at last caught, fashioned and . 
set for all time in the native pottery. 
The symbol of the wind is remark- 
able for its constant hold on the 
popular mind in Mexico. More than 
four centuries removed in time from 
the earlier world, the themes of fire 
and wind, traditionally associated, 
are still used in Mexican pottery and 
ceramics. 
WIND SYMBOLS 
PREDOMINATED 
N the Mayan and Aztec Emp- 
I ires, those phenomena were the 
centre of complex philosophic 
systems and of religious ideas. 
Pots for cooking on the fire are 
‘always ornamented with wind symbols 
(spirals, crossed-spirals, swirled ar- 
rows). Such representations of the 
wind theme are always flat, never in 
relief. Repeated close to one another 
on a common earthen cooking pot, 
they combine to give the whole a 
peculiarly dynamic effect, savouring 
strongly of the primitive. 
Thus we come to present-day Mex-  
  
ico, leaving behind the vigorous and 
impressive art of the Maya and the 
Aztecs. The art of great stone sculp- 
ture has given place to the art of 
metal jewels, earthenware toys, cut- 
out paper, painted pottery and deli- 
cate featherwork — in all, the de- 
lightful popular art of Mexico. 
The Indian Fa Nl that 
when the Spanish shi kthe Con- 
quistadores loomed over the horizon 
of Anahuac — as the whole region 
from the coast to the city of Mexico 
was called — a doleful voice was 
heard lamenting in the darkness of 
the night and crying: « We must go, 
my children. Our gods are dead and 
we must die with them. » 
In reality, what died was only one 
part of a great civilization. Wind, 
light — that incomparable light of 
the Valley of Mexico — fire — that 
element in which stone and water, 
colours and music blend in such per- 
fect harmony — all these have endu- 
red. : 
And the Mexican people have also 
endured and developed; a people 
able to reproduce faithfully all the 
familiar elements of nature, a people 
that not only take nature's gifts, but 
also gradually change and mould 
nature to their own measure.
