{® ALGERIA Market day in the Mzab 
The Mzab region of Algeria is a rocky Saharan plateau etched with deep ravines. In the history of Islam it is known as the 
place where the ‘“Mzabites’’ or ‘‘Mozabites’’, heterodox Berbers belonging to the Ibadite sect, settled in the 11th century. 
The Mozabites became established in the towns of Algeria where they exercised a virtual monopoly over trade in such pro- 
ducts as spices, fabrics, carpets, and meat—especially mutton, a favourite dish in Arab countries. The chief town of the 
Mzab, Ghardaia, is noted for its picturesque architecture and as a date-producing centre. Above, market scene at Ghardaia.

A world history, a monument 
without parallel in the world, 
the cultural treasures of an ancient 
city, a community in search of its 
cultural identity, the quest for 
peace—these apparently disparate 
subjects, which make up the content 
of this issue of the Unesco Courier, all 
form part of the common heritage of 
mankind that Unesco is pledged to 
preserve and defend. 
The bicentenary of the birth of 
Simon Bolivar, the great Latin 
American liberator and the visionary 
whose noble ambition it was to unify 
a continent, is celebrated in prose and 
verse by Arturo Uslar-Pietri and René 
Depestre. 
Drs. Soekmono and Voiite, respec- 
tively Director and former Unesco 
Co-ordinator of the Borobudur resto-   
ration project, trace the history of the 
thousand-year-old Buddhist sanc- 
tuary of Chandi Borobudur and tell 
how, after centuries of neglect and 
abandon, this monument to human 
genius has been saved for posterity by 
a combination of Indonesian pride 
and perseverance and an effort of in- 
ternational co-operation and solidari- 
ty inspired by Unesco. 
+ Erkin Yussupov describes how, over 
its two thousand years of existence, 
the “stone village” of Tashkent has 
grown to become the capital of the 
Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and 
the fourth largest city of the USSR. 
One of the cultural cross-roads of 
central Asia, Tashkent houses a 
magnificent collection of ancient 
manuscripts which, as Muzaffar 
Khayrullaev, Director of the Al-Biruni 
Institute of Oriental Studies tells us, 
bear witness to the interpenetration of 
philosophical and scientific thought 
and aesthetic and moral values of cen- 
tral Asia over the centuries. 
Thousands of kilometres away, in 
the Arctic Circle, live the Laplanders 
of Finnoscandinavia, a people united 
by a common language and a life based 
on the herding of reindeer. Pekka 
Aikio describes how the Laplanders 
are affirming their cultural identity 
and their right to maintain their age- 
old way of life. 
Finally, Constantin Ene explores 
the complex problems of disarina- 
ment and proposes a number of ways 
in which the cause of peace, vital to 
human survival, can be advanced.

BOLIVAR 
THE LIBERATOR (1783-1830) 
Undimmed by time, a bright 
vision of a New World 
WO hundred years after his 
birth, Bolivar undoubtedly re- 
mains one of that tiny but 
distinguished group of people who have 
had something to teach mankind. He 
died in 1830, but the sheer magnitude of 
his personality is still being revealed to us 
and still has the power to move us. In the 
eyes of his contemporaries, he was the 
outstanding leader of the struggle for the 
political independence of Latin America, 
a charismatic figure who, virtually 
without resources, managed to overcome 
all manner of obstacles and setbacks in 
directing and sustaining the long-drawn- 
out and difficult fifteen-year offensive 
which was to put an end to Spanish domi- 
nion over America. His unyielding 
tenacity, his conviction that in- 
dependence could and should come 
about in his own lifetime and his far- 
reaching vision of the future of the New 
World, all set him apart from the many 
other exceptional leaders who emerged 
during the war for the emancipation of 
the continent. 
For the Western world, he soon 
became the symbol of the struggle against 
despotism and the old monarchies. His 
name was synonymous with freedom. 
The revolutionaries of 1830 and 1848, the 
“Carbonari’’, the liberals, the young 
Romantics all looked to him and his ex- 
ample. He was the hero who had pitted 
himself against three hundred years of 
ARTURO USLAR-PIETRI, noted Venezuelan 
writer and his country’s former ambassador and 
permanent delegate to Unesco, is the author of

the old régime in Spanish America, had 
succeeded in bringing it to an end, and 
had proclaimed a new order of 
democracy and freedom in its stead. His 
admirers ranged from the restless young 
people in the Paris of the Bourbons, who 
sported the ‘‘Bolivar hat’ as though it 
were a battle standard, to students of 
world politics and to Byron, who gave 
Bolivar’s name to the boat on which he 
dreamed of bringing freedom to Greece. 
Bolivar had become the eternal 
, ““Liberator’’, the man who had per- 
sonified a continent’s determination to 
be free and who had striven to establish a 
political order founded on justice and the 
rights of the individual. 
There can be no doubt that, as a 
military leader, he won significant vic- 
tories against all the odds. He sowed the 
seeds of destiny, in that nations were 
born of the battles he waged, and he 
secured freedom for vast numbers of 
people and an enormous landmass. In 
1825, when his triumph at Ayacucho put 
an end to the Spanish Empire and made

him the arbiter of the destinies of Latin 
America, he conceived and attempted to 
give substance to the grandiose plan of 
uniting America as he saw it, in a bid to 
bring about a new age of stability and 
justice for mankind. Indeed, his disagree- 
ment with his former followers and the 
growing difficulties he had to contend 
with stemmed from his vision of the 
future. 
For him, independence was not so 
much an end in itself as a necessary step 
along the road to a more difficult but 
much more ambitious project. His aim 
was not merely to replace one set of men 
by another, to put Creole leaders in the 
seats vacated by the Spanish viceroys and 
governors and thereby perpetuate the 
political and social patterns inherited 
from the colonial past. He wanted 
. something totally different: literally to 
create a powerful and free New World, 
setting an example through its institu- 
tions, intent on dispensing justice in all its 
forms, and laying the foundations for a 
new global order which Bolivar himself 
spoke of as a ‘‘new equilibrium for the 
universe’’. 
Right from the start, Bolivar was 
distinguished for the clarity and boldness 
of his thinking. Had he done no more

» and charged with significance. His 
language faithfully reflected his tempera- 
ment and his deep anxieties. He was a 
master of concision and of striking 
similes. His words were as good as his 
deeds. 
There have been few other figures in 
history who combined as he did the gifts 
and qualities of a man of action and those 
of a thinker, of those who were leaders of 
men and also visionaries, whose political 
acumen did not prevent them from form- 
ing grand designs or from rising above 
petty day-to-day concerns. His tragedy 
was his inability to ensure that his vision 
of the future would come true. He could 
not rest content with the extraordinary 
task he had accomplished, since he con- 
sidered it merely as the necessary prelude 
to the new political organization of Latin 
America and a new world equilibrium. 
Only a person of his quality could have 
regarded the second stage as being more 
important than the first. 
Bolivar is a figure of infinite variety. If 
we see him as being no more than the 
leader of a highly successful insurrection, 
we obliterate one whole side of his per- 
sonality and overlook some of the most 
interesting and admirable aspects of his 
achievement. He was never just a man of 
action, perpetually engaged in a struggle 
that must often have seemed hopeless; 
nor was he an ideologist unimaginatively 
applying doctrines and examples culled 
from other countries and other historical 
situations. 
What is more, he was not just a politi- 
cian bogged down in the immediate pre- 
sent. A study of his life leaves us con- 
stantly amazed at the profusion and 
variety of talents he displays. In his eyes, 
the past of the Latin American peoples 
was as alive as their present. He identified 
himself totally with the historical and 
cultural predicament of his fellow 
Americans, and yet at the same time he 
could look forward to the future as he 
wished to see it and could work for a far- 
reaching transformation of society and 
its goals. He was not blinded by the 
various brilliant political theories of his 
day. He had carefully scrutinized the 
ideas of Rousseau and Montesquieu, 
comparing them with his own experience 
in the struggle and with the lessons of the 
American past. 
His conclusion was that the future of 
the American peoples did not lie in mere- 
ly imitating or adapting the ideas and in- 
stitutions of other nations born of differ- 
ing historical and cultural circumstances; 
in his opinion, only the facts, however in- 
tractable, could be the starting point for 
the determined and clear-sighted effort 
needed, since the colonial past had in no 
way prepared those peoples for their dif- 
ficult metamorphosis. 
One fundamental theme of Bolivar’s 
ideas on nation-building was what we, in 
present-day international parlance, 
would call the cultural constraints on 
development and the difficulty of adap- 
ting foreign models. He was forever aler- 
ting legislators—dazzled as they were by 
the examples of the institutions that 
emerged from the revolutions in the 
United States and France—to the impor- 
6 
tance of allowing for specific Hispano- 
American practices, traditions and ex- 
periences of the past. He ardently desired 
freedom, justice and democracy, but he 
did not lose sight of the social and 
political realities which three hundred 
years of life under colonial rule had 
created in the America he knew. 
Nor did he lose sight of the interna- 
tional situation hovering on the horizon. 
The independence of Latin America 
could not be envisaged and achieved as if 
it were an isolated local phenomenon: it 
was a major upheaval establishing a new 
situation and a new pattern of worldwide 
relations. The sudden emergence of a free 
and sovereign America would inevitably 
produce significant changes in political 
relationships all over the world. This was 
the exceptionally wide-ranging context 
within which Bolivar’s action and think- 
ing evolved and which afforded him his 
status and relevance as the guide of the 
American peoples and the embodiment 
of their spirit. 
and wealth, he climbed the mountain of 
silver that had been the symbol of col- 
onial authority, accompanied by the 
representatives of Argentina, Peru and 
Chile. As he took in the panorama 
stretching out before him, as he felt—and 
expressed—the compelling need for in- 
tegration as the only course capable of 
securing the future of so vast a slice of 
humanity and territory, he caught a 
glimpse of the scenario of universal 
history. It was at this time that he conven- 
ed the Panama Congress that was to 
bring together representatives of the 
whole of America in a bid to work out the 
practical aspects of the continent’s 
policies, its self-defence and the joint ac- 
tion it would be required to take in its 
dealings with the rest of the world. 
We need only leaf through the main 
documents in which his ideas are 
assembled to realize that his conception 
of the common destiny of Latin America 
never changed. As early as 1812, in Car- 
tagena, when he had scarcely emerged 
To commemorate the bicentenary of the

This, moreover, is an attitude that 
prevailed throughout his life and in all his 
writings. From the outset, his vision of 
independence embraced the whole conti- 
nent and, in this respect, he was at one 
with his celebrated predecessor Francisco 
Miranda. The issue as they both saw it 
was not to win independence for a few 
portions of the Spanish Empire but to en- 
sure that the whole territory it covered 
would become conscious of its identity 
and destiny, and would attain full 
sovereignty. This accordingly implied a 
form of political organization and the 
adoption of goals that would encompass 
the entire New World. From the very 
beginning, he spoke in the name of 
America rather than of Venezuela, and 
was not afraid to suggest ways in which 
political integration could come about. 
As he said on several occasions, 
‘““America is our homeland”’. 
The question now is what he meant by 
America and what form of integration he 
had in mind. His scheme of things did not 
rule out any significant part of the 
America that had been subjugated by the 
European powers. He started with the 
peoples of Venezuela, New Granada and 
Ecuador which were close at hand and 
were subsequently to combine to form 
Colombia, but he went on to include all 
parts of the Empire in successive designs 
for co-operation. 
When, in 1825, after the final and 
decisive victory at Ayacucho, he arrived 
at Potosi, that magical centre of power 
from the ruins of the first attempt he 
made to set up an independent republic in 
Venezuela, he issued a bold manifesto 
sounding the alarm against the mistaken 
belief that any part of America could 
achieve and preserve its independence in 
isolation. As long as Venezuela was not 
liberated, the independence of New 
Granada would be threatened, since an 
expeditionary force organized from 
Venezuela and setting out from the 
“Provinces of Barinas and Maracaibo’ 
would be able to penetrate into *‘the fur- 
thest reaches of southern America’. 
Indeed, the huge efforts which he ex- 
pected on the part of the enemies of 
freedom were exactly the same as those 
he himself had to make throughout the 
long hard years of his political and 
military career. From then on, the whole 
of Latin America became the theatre of 
operations for a single combat, the strug- 
gle for independence, only to be achieved 
by the integration of all its peoples in a 
single body that would guarantee the uni- 
ty of its presence and action on the world 
scene. 
In the astonishing letter which he wrote 
in Jamaica in 1815 to ‘‘a gentleman of 
that island’’, he painted the most detailed 
and challenging picture of his vision of 
the American destiny. His theme was not 
Venezuela but rather ‘‘a vast, varied and 
unknown country, the New World’. He 
looked upon it as a fact of history and 
geography, asking impatiently whether 
the entire New World was not mobilized

and armed to defend itself, and adding: 
“On this battlefield, some 2,000 leagues 
long and 900 leagues wide at its extremes, 
sixteen million Americans are either 
defending their rights or are being 
oppressed’. 
In his view, an unavoidable historical 
phenomenon had occurred, one that was 
bound to have far-reaching consequences 
for the world. It was here that he express- 
ed the gist of his thinking: the projected 
independence of America was a necessary 
goal “because world equilibrium 
demanded it’. 
This, then, represented his fundamen- 
tal view of things. The time had come to 
strike a new universal balance. The pat- 
tern of imperial domination could not 
continue. In the words used by Virgil in 
his prophetic Eclogue, a new order was to 
- come to pass. The Spanish Empire had to 
be brought to an end so that an authentic 
New World could come into being and 
engage in a dialogue on fair and just 
terms with the other powers of the earth. 
For Bolivar, the term ‘‘New World”’ 
did not have the restricted connotations 
earlier historians had given it. He did not 
conceive of it merely as a recent adjunct 
to an old world and an old order but as a 
heaven-sent opportunity of creating a 
new society that would not repeat the 
mistakes of the old world and would 
usher in a new era in relations between all 
nations. 
Bolivar thus became the prophet not 
only of the New World but of a new 
world order. Henceforward, he sensed 
and made it plain that the time was ripe 
for the emergence of new and indepen- 
dent nations and also that the very ex- 
istence of such nations would dictate the 
setting-up of a new pattern of relation- 
ships. Using words that would be equally 
relevant to the struggle currently being 
waged by the new nations of Latin 
America, Asia and Africa to bring about 
a new order of relations, to the dramatic 
dialogue going on between North and 
South, or to the far-reaching process of 
the emergence of the Third World, 
Bolivar said: “There is another balanced 
order of importance to us, and this is the 
equilibrium of the universe. This struggle 
cannot be partial for its outcome will af- 
fect vast interests scattered all over the 
world’. 
How topical and alive his words sound 
today! Their subject is the key issue now 
being feverishly debated in the leading in- 
ternational fora. Two hundred years 
. after his birth, Simén Bolivar is in the 
front line of the fight for the establish- 
ment of a new international order. 
Unesco formally acknowledged this 
when, in 1978, its governing bodies ap- 
proved the creation of the International 
Simén Bolivar Prize ‘‘to be awarded 
every second year, starting on 24 July 
1983, the bicentenary of the birth of 
Simon Bolivar, to those who have made 
an outstanding contribution to the 
freedom, independence and dignity of 
peoples and to the strengthening of 
solidarity among nations, or who have 
fostered their development or facilitated 
the quest for a new international 
economic, social and cultural order’.

‘Bolivar in the rock 
of Santa Marta* 
I rose early to sing you 
in the path where your good news 
precedes all our dreams. From son to son 
of the Caribbean I dance your ideas. 
Supported by your roots my steps 
feel the pulsation of the fate of men: 
Help! Simon Bolivar, help! 
Captain, times are bad! 
The world needs your health, 
The planet is losing the life of your roots 
like a young queen her hair! 
I seek you in the rock of Santa Marta 
Are you still a beguiler of shores? 
Have you said the last word to the waves 
of solitude that have withered our lands! 
What of the morning star remains in you? 
Where is the house you had at Jacmel? 
How many times have they heralded in you 
the myth of the genius burned alive at the stake 
of his own legend? How many times 
have they hailed the return in force of your life 
in the seeds of nourishing maize? 
Where shines your heritage as the father of bread 
and the peace of women, father 
of the house where we would live in peace 
each people enlightening the other in a single universe? 
We have lost treasures with your name 
We have taken for life the word libertador 
turning it into a maker of frontiers. 
Where is the roof you had at Rosario 
on your creole home of the Americas? 
Where is the house of a single crystal 
where you will enter as one leaves one’s mother’s womb? 
Inventor of new seeds, 
man of beginnings, prophet 
of the guitar and cacao, 
each day of sunshine is in danger, 
each starry night brings to our doors 
the nuclear shame which will extinguish life.

the door will open, whatever the street, 
you are welcome, they will not dare 
to shatter the right of everyone to be a sun 
if they know that the strong tenderness of a man 
has come back to the house of huinan brothers.

### 53922: Borobudur, Indonesia's Buddhist sanctuary: a sermon in stone

Indonesia’s Buddhist sanctuary — 
a sermon In stone 
In the centre of the Indonesian island of 
Java, on a fertile plain bordered by rugged 
mountains and volcanoes, stands the 
magnificent Buddhist sanctuary of Chandi 
Borobudur. With its stone terraces rising 
skywards, wave upon wave, with its profu- 
sion of unique stone reliefs and statues of 
the Buddha, capped by a great central 
stupa, Borobudur has been called ‘the 
vastest, oldest, and most beautiful monu- 
ment in the southern hemisphere’’. But for 
centuries after it was built over a thousand 
years ago, Borobudur was abandoned and 
Jorgotten. When it was rediscovered in the 
nineteenth century it was ravaged with 
decay, and although a number of repairs 
and holding operations were carried out, it 
seemed doomed to eventual collapse. In the 
years after Indonesia became independent, 
the new nation made the preservation of this 
tangible evidence of its glorious past a 
priority objective. Today, through a unique 
combination of multidisciplinary technical 
skills, Indonesian pride, and international 
co-operation channelled through Unesco’s 
international campaign for Borobudur, this 
great work of human genius has been saved 
for posterity. The finishing touches have 
now been put to a vast archaeological rescue 
operation which has taken ten years and has 
involved the stone-by-stone dismantlenient 
and reconstitution of the square lower ter- 
races of the colossal edifice. Here, 
Dr. Soekmono, of Indonesia, the Director 
of the Borobudur Restoration Project, 
traces the history of the monument and of- 
fers an interpretation of its significance; 
in a second article Dr. Soekmono and Dr. 
C. Voiite, Unesco Co-ordinator of the 
Borobudur project 1971-75, describe the 
threats to Borobudur and show how at- 
tempts to save it have finally been crowned 
with success. 
  
R. SOEKMONO, Indonesian archaeologist and 
ancient historian, is director of the Borobudur restora- 
tion project. Professor of archaeology at the University 
of Indonesia, of which he is also executive secretary, he 
has published several studies on Borobudur, notably 
Chandi Borobudur, A Monument of Mankind pub- 
lished in 1976 by Unesco and Van Gorcum, Assen/Ams- 
terdam, The Netherlands. 
by R. Soekmono 
ANY theories have been advanced about the origin of 
Borobudur, perhaps the most poetic being one claiming 
that it originally represented a lotus flower floating on 
the surface of a lake which once covered the surrounding plain, the 
mythical lotus from which the future Buddha will be born. 
No written documents about the construction of the monument 
survive, but inscriptions point to the conclusion that it was pro- 
bably founded around the year 800 AD during the Golden Age of 
the powerful Sailendra dynasty of Central Java. 
Nor do we know with certainty how long Borobudur was in ac- 
tive use, or when it ceased to function as a monument to glorify the 
greatness of the Sailendra kings and, at the same time as.a centre 
of Buddhist pilgrimage. 
The general assumption is that the Chandis (the name given to 
monuments dating back to the ancient period of Indonesian 
history) fell into disuse when people were converted to Islam in the 
fifteenth century. However, it is quite possible that the monuments 
in Central Java were abandoned as early as the tenth century, when 
historical importance shifted from there to East Java. 
Whatever the truth may have been, it was not until 1814 that 
Chandi Borobudur emerged, actually and figuratively, from its 
dark past. Java was then under British rule, and the representative 
of the British Government, Sir Stamford Raffles, took a keen in- 
terest in the island’s history. In 1814, when he was informed of the 
existence of a huge monument called Chandi Borobudur, he sent 
a Dutch engineer named Cornelius to investigate. 
Cornelius hired some 200 villagers to fell trees, burn down 
bushes and dig away the earth and rubbish in which the monument 
had long been buried. The activities of Raffles and Cornelius 
stimulated interest in Borobudur, and a later Dutch administrator 
arranged for further removal of the debris so that by 1835 the en- 
tire edifice was freed from its last disfiguring cover. 
The monument that stood revealed is a colossal stepped pyramid 
consisting of nine superimposed terraces and crowned by a huge 
bell-shaped stupa. It was built around and on top of a flattened 
hill, of andesite, a porous, bluish-grey volcanic rock which had 
been taken from nearby rivers. Laid without mortar, the stones 
had been made to grip by means of dovetails in the horizontal con- 
nexions, and indentations in the vertical joints. This system allows 
a certain flexibility, so that the monument can withstand slight 
movements without an immediate danger of collapse. 
The structural design is complicated, but a main vertical division 
into three parts—base, body, and top—is evident. The base forms 
a square with sides measuring some 120 metres, the total area thus 
being slightly less than one and a half hectares. 
The four-metre-high walls of the base are supported by a 
foothold resembling a huge plinth, 1.5 metres high and 3 metres 
across. In 1885, the Chairman of the Yogyakarta Archaeological 
Society made the sensational discovery that these walls encased a 
series of 160 carved reliefs, which became known as the monu- 
ment’s “hidden foot’’. (A photographic record of the reliefs was 
made in 1890-91, after which the ‘‘foot’’ was again hidden with the 
original stones, except for the southeast corner.). 
Some scholars have suggested that these reliefs had been 
deliberately covered to conceal them from the eyes of pilgrims. 
However, the use of 12, 750 cubic metres of stone to make the en- 
casement, and the sacrifice of architectural elements and reliefs, 
seem to indicate that the soundness of the monument was at stake. 
As a considerable part of the gradually mounting foundations of 
the stepped pyramid had to rest on loose filled earth, sliding pro- 
bably took place. In other words, the encasing wall was a retaining 
embankment thrown up to prevent further sliding and to avoid 
worse disaster.

Aerial photos, above and top of page, show the basic architec- 
tural features of Borobudur, a stepped pyramid consisting of 
nine superimposed terraces and crowned by a huge bell-shaped 
Stupa 35 metres above the ground. Cross-section, right, 
shows how the vertical layout of the structure, divided into a 
base, a central and an upper part, corresponds to the three 
spheres of the Universe in the Buddhist cosmogony: 
kamadhatu, the sphere of the Desires; rupadhatu, the sphere of 
Forms; and arupadhatu, the sphere of Formlessness. 
10 
>» The body, or middle part of the monument, is composed 
of five terraces which diminish in size with height. The first 
of these terraces stands back some seven metres from the 
sides of the base creating a broad platform right round the 
monument. The other terraces retreat only two metres at 
each stage, and balustrades at the outer sides convert the nar- 
row galleries into corridors. 
The superstructure is in its turn clearly distinguished from 
the terraces. It consists of three circular platforms, each of 
which supports a row of bell-shaped stupas containing Bud- 
dhas half visible through perforated stonework. Surmoun- 
ting the rows of stupas, which are arranged in concentric 
circles, the great central dome on top of the monument soars 
into the sky to a height of nearly thirty-five metres above the 
ground. ’ 
Access to the upper part of the monument is provided by 
stairways in the middle of each side of the pyramid. The 
stairs lead through a series of gates (most of which have been 
lost) directly to the circular platforms, at the same time in- 
tersecting the corridors of the square terraces. The main en- 
trance is at the eastern side, as is clear from the start of the 
narrative reliefs. 
Chandi Borobudur is one of the most complex and in- 
tegrated religious symbols in the world; each of its levels has 
a different kind of sculptural symbolism. It should be con- 
sidered, not as a temple, but as a place of pilgrimage, or a 
school or university of a special type. The Buddhist student 
is guided gradually along successive terraces and staircases to 
the uppermost platform, experiencing physically as well as 
spiritually the long and hard journey in search of the 
Ultimate Truth. 
Buddhism lays particular stress on the stages of mental 
preparation to be undergone before attaining liberation from 
all earthly bonds and the ultimate exclusion from being 
reborn. The universe has three spheres. The lowest sphere is 
kamadhatu or the Sphere of the Desires. At this stage man 
is bound to his desires. The higher sphere is rupadhatu or the 
Sphere of Forms, where man has abandoned his desires but 
is still bound to name and form. The highest sphere is 
arupadhatu, or the Sphere of Formlessness. In this sphere 
there is no longer either name or form. Man is once and 
forever freed from all bonds with the phenomenal world. 
At Chandi Borobudur the Sphere of Desires is represented 
by the base; the Sphere of Forms by the square terraces; and 
the Sphere of Formlessness by the three circular platforms 
and the great stupa. 
The base is concealed from the visitor’s sight today, but 
the 160 reliefs and the short inscriptions carved over many of 
the panels (apparently constituting instructions to the 
sculptors indicating the scene to be carved) depict the work- 
ings of morality on earth.

Blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their 
corresponding purgatorial punishments, and praiseworthy 
activities like charity and pilgrimages to sanctuaries, and 
their subsequent rewards, are both shown. The pains of hell 
and the pleasures of heaven, and scenes of daily life are 
represented in a full panorama of samsara, the endless cycle 
of birth and death, the chain of all those forms of delusional 
existence from which Buddhism brings release. 
In contrast to the openness of the earthly life in the Sphere 
of Desires, the path leading to ultimate salvation requires a 
narrowing of bodily sight and concentration of the mind. 
The narrow galleries of the Sphere of Forms help the faithful 
to achieve this. At first sight they are bewildering. The walls 
and facing balustrades are packed with reliefs. No less than 
1,300 panels of narrative reliefs for a total length of 2,500 
metres, and a further 1,212 decorative reliefs, flank the cor- 
  
  
ridors. The biography of the Lord Buddha, from his descent 
from heaven until his enlightenment, is depicted on the main 
wall of the first gallery. The reliefs which cover the walls of 
the second, third and fourth galleries tell the story of the 
tireless wanderings of Sudhana in search of the Highest 
Wisdom and the Ultimate Truth. 
The narrative reliefs on the walls read from right to left, 
those on the balustrades from left to right. This was done for 
the purposes of the pradaksina, the ritual circumambulation 
which the pilgrim makes, moving in a clockwise direction 
and keeping the sanctury to his right. The narrative starts at 
the left and ends at the right of the eastern stairway, confirm- 
ing that this stairway is the real entrance to the monument. 
The perseverance of the principal figures of the Sphere of 
Forms and their tireless efforts to reach the Ultimate Goal 
despite their involvement with the extreme richness and

Borobudur’s 
hidden foot 
The base of Borobudur, usually call- 
ed ‘the hidden foot”, is concealed 
+ from view by a heavy stone encase- 
ment which was probably built to 
prevent the still-uncompleted monu- 
ment from collapsing through sub- 
sidence. Adorning it is a remarkable 
series of 160 reliefs which were only 
discovered in 1885, over ten cen- 
turies after they were created. The 
hidden foot was then exposed and 
its masterpieces photographed 
before being covered up again, ex- 
cept for the southeast corner. The 
panels, which are outstanding for 
their enthralling panorama of scenes 
from everyday life, illustrate the 
workings of Karma, the Law of 
Cause and Effect. Scenes are shown 
which may lead to a future incarna- 
tion characterized by “a short life”, 
‘a long life”, “much pain*, “little 
pain”, “‘ugliness’, “‘gracefulness’’ 
and so on. Since the pious visitor to 
Borobudur should walk around the 
sanctuary in a clockwise direction in 
accordance with the rite of 
pradaksina, the initial deed is usually 
depicted on the right side of the 
panel, the good or bad result on the 
left. Left above, a two-part scene 
divided by the tree at centre il- 
lustrates wicked deeds that lead to 
the torments of hell: people throw- 
ing fish and turtles into a cauldron 
are themselves cooked over a fire 
(right of central tree), and a mother- 
slayer plunges headfirst into hell 
(left). Left centre, refusal to give 
alms leads to poverty. Left below,

THE GREAT VEHICLE 
In the sense that there was no god to be worshipped, Buddhism was not 
originally a religion. It was rather a doctrine explaining how to achieve the 
ultimate release from all sufferings. Underlying the doctrine is the conviction 
that life is inisery. Since the phenomenal world is not real, life in all its aspects 
is illusion. Life is both a continuation of earlier lives and a preparation for the 
next one, a station in the endless cycle of being born and reborn. The forin and 
circumstances of each station are determined by their predecessors. 
The determining factor is the karma, the balance of good and bad acts. A 
positive balance will secure a better next life and a life that continues to improve 
will culminate in a rebirth in heaven. This however does not break the cycle of 
birth and rebirth, since a celestial being is also a temporary manifestation. The 
ultimate goal is therefore to avoid any form of rebirth. 
In the further development of Buddhisin, the attainment of nirvana, ab- 
solute non-existence, ceased to be the ultimate goal. To be consistent with the 
Buddha’s example, it was the salvation of others that should be striven for 
rather than one’s own. The figure of the Bodhisattva, one whose nature was 
enlightenment, replaced the image of nirvana. This school, which becane 
established in Indonesia, is called Mahayana or The Great Vehicle. Its principle 
is to pursue salvation for the many, and the ideal of the Mahayana Buddhist 
is to become a Bodhisattva. R.S.

beauty of forms, provide a model for the pilgrim as he 
perambulates the successive stages. 
In striking contrast to the square terraces of the Sphere of 
Forms the circular platforms representing the Sphere of 
Formlessness are plain: no carvings, no ornaments, no 
embellishments. The only break in the monotonous plain- 
ness is offered by the row of stupas that encircle the great 
central dome. 
The complete openness of the arupadhatu, and the 
magnificent view from it, symbolize the endless widening of 
his spiritual horizon that the pilgrim can achieve by con- 
sistently following the devout conduct in life of the Lord 
Buddha. Having absorbed the spirit of the arupadhatu, he 
knows the delight of becoming wiser, if not enlightened, and 
the ordinary visitor finds that his own weary journey is richly 
rewarded. 
The exceptional design of Chandi Borobudur has led to 
much speculation about why it was built; the identification 
_of the monument with the cosmic mountain is only one of 
many interpretations by which scholars have sought to reveal 
its mysteries in the over 500 learned studies that have been 
devoted to Borobudur. 
The most satisfactory explanation of the symbolic mean- 
ing of the monument has been found by Dr. J.G. de 
Casparis, who has made a minute analysis of a number of 
eighth and ninth-century inscriptions. In one of them dating 
from 842 AD he recognized the compound word 
Bhumisambha-rabhudara which he recognized as the 
original name of Chandi Borobudur. 
This complicated word serves both to explain the 
significance of the mountain and to name its founders as 
well. As a technical term in Mahayana Buddhism (see box 
page 13) the compound means: ‘“The mountain of the ac- 
cumulation of virtue on the ten stages of the Bodhisattva’. 
A Bodhisattva is one who, like the historical Buddha 
Gautama, has set out to attain Enlightenment. The term may 
also be interpreted in architectural terms as ‘“The mountain 
which is terraced in successive stages’’ or in a more general 
sense as the ‘‘King(s) of the accumulation of earth’’. i.e. the 
Sailendra dynasty (saila indra = king of the mountains). 
Such ambiguity in a technical term is quite common in the 
Sailendra charters, as de Casparis has convincingly shown. 
In the prehistoric cultures of Indonesia, a stepped pyramid 
is the symbol of the abode of the ancestors in the mountains 
and hence it can be plausibly argued that ancestor worship 
played a significant part in the designing of the monument. 
Consequently, the symbolical meaning of Chandi 
Borobudur has a twofold origin, in Mahayana Buddhism 
and in ancestor worship. In this context de Casparis inter- 
preted the great stupa as the tenth storey of the monument. 
The ten mounting terraces of the structure correspond to the 
ten successive stages the Bodhisattva must achieve before at- 
taining Buddhahood; they also correspond to the Sailendra 
kings who had until then ruled the kingdom. 
Borobudur is exceptionally rich in stone statues depicting 
Dhyani (transcendental) Buddhas seated cross-legged on 
lotus cushions and facing outwards. At first sight they all 
seem alike but they differ, especially as to the position of 
the hands {mudra). Right, a Dhyani Buddha in the Abhaya 
mudra symbolizing the reassurance to refrain from fear.

It is well known that kings identified themselves with their 
divine patrons: Hindu kings with Siva or Visnu, and Bud- 
dhist kings with Bodhisattvas. The liberation from the cycle 
of birth and death constitutes the final goal in Hinduism (just 
as it was in the early evolution of Buddhism) but to the 
Mahayana Buddhist it is the statt of the Path to be followed 
by the Bodhisattva. A Sailendra king had to do his utmost 
to pave the way for the attainment of Buddhahood. He had 
to accumulate as much virtue as possible during his reign. He 
also had to glorify his predecessors, and one of the most 
meritorious ways of doing this was to erect monuments 
dedicated both to his patron and to his forefathers. 
In terms of ancestor worship, a predecessor is assumed to 
have reached a higher stage of perfection than a successor. 
The most remote forefather, the founder of the dynasty, is 
assumed to have attained the ultimate perfection. And the 
other ancestors are ranked successively by order of seniority. 
This was apparently the underlying idea of the founder of 
Chandi Borobudur when he decided to create a monument 
that differed radically from the traditional design. His dar- 
ing break with tradition was meant to demonstrate the high 
esteem in which he held the forefather whom he identified 
with the Buddha; and a stepped pyramid with a stupa on top 
was a most appropriate symbol for depicting the virtue the 
dynasty had accumulated along the Path of the Bodhisattva. 
Chandi Borobudur can only be understood by fusing Bud- 
dhism and ancestor worship.

### 53924: How Borobudur was saved

How Borobudur was saved 
by R. Soekmono and Caesar Voiite 
HE present restoration project for Borobudur is the 
] culmination of a long period of studies and research. 
Earlier restoration and conservation measures dealt 
only partially with the factors endangering the monument, 
even the major work carried out by Theodoor Van Erp bet- 
ween 1908 and 1911. Van Erp rebuilt the crumbling stupas 
and cleaned many of the carvings of lichen and moss. Never- 
theless, if all the cleaning operations, repairs and studies car- 
ried out since the rediscovery of Borobudur in 814 are in- 
cluded then research and conservatory action can be said to 
have covered more than 150 years. 
The threat to Borobudur was due to a combination of 
causes. The monument was built on an unpropitious site, not 
on level ground but around and over the top of a hill. As they 
worked the builders tipped loose earth and rubble before 
them so that the foundations of the edifice rest on a layer of 
man-made fill. Even during construction this unstable fill 
caused sliding which the builders countered by taking 
remedial measures notably the retaining wall which conceals 
the “‘hidden foot’’ (see previous article). 
Borobudur is in an earthquake zone and has suffered 
seismic shocks ever since it was built. As recently as 1961 two 
earthquakes took place within a month. Though only very 
slight they dislodged numerous stones in the leaning walls 
and produced new cracks and fissures. 
For over a thousand years the rigours of the tropical 
climate have probed the latent weaknesses of the edifice. 
Sudden changes of heat and cold between day and night in 
an arca where temperatures may vary by 20° Centigrade in 
twenty-four hours cause porous stones to crack. But the 
worst havoc has been caused by the heavy rains (over 2,000 
millimetres a year on average, with torrential downpours of 
up to 15mm in five minutes). They overwhelmed the inade-

quate drainage system, percolating down into the central 
core where they washed away the earth and weakened the 
foundations. As a result the terrace walls sagged and tilted 
at crazy angles and the floors sloped inwards. The lower ter- 
race walls were particularly affected and were on the brink 
of collapse. Had they done so the whole colossal structure 
would have come tumbling down in a great slithering avalan- 
che of earth and masonry. 
Moisture on the stones had also corroded many of the 
beautifully carved reliefs and favoured the growth of 
disfiguring patches of mosses and lichens.

Damaged Buddha statues await repair. During the rescue operation a computerized stone registration system was used to keep track 
of over a million stone blocks which were dismantled, cleaned, dried, restored and treated before being re-erected on new founda- 
tions. Some stones had to be stored carefully for 4 or 5 years before rebuilding. 
  
ment continued to receive special attention: In 1948 two In- 
dian archaeologists were invited to survey it, and in 1955 the 
Government asked for Unesco’s assistance. Regular measur- 
ings carried out in 1959 revealed alarming irregularities; the 
actual differences may have seemed insignificant but since 
the slightest movement of a leaning wall might have been 
fatal no deviation could be neglected. 
Since Chandi Borobudur is so integrated and deterioration 
was so widespread, it could not be effectively safeguarded by 
partial restoration measures. Thus a bold plan was evolved: 
to dismantle and rebuild the square terraces and at the same 
time install an efficient drainage system behind the walls and 
It was also decided that the earth-core of the monument 
would have to be hydrologically isolated from the stone 
masonry, and for this purpose it was proposed to install a 
combination of filter layers and impervious structures when 
building the new foundations. In any case, the weakness of 
the foundations dictated a reconstruction of walls and floors 
on new foundations of reinforced concrete. Adequate 
strengthening of these foundations could only be achieved by 
the construction of concrete slabs which would spread the 
weight of the walls and the balustrades over a wide surface. 
Another imperative was to maintain a certain flexibility in 
the monument. Thus it was decided to construct independent 
under the floors. ring-like foundations under each of the galleries. 
FROM REDISCOVERY TO RESTORATION 
Some time after being founded by a 
king of the Sailendra dynasty of central 
Java in the 9th century AD, Chandi 
Borobudur is abandoned. 
1814. It is rediscovered by Sir Stamford 
Raffles and the envelope of rubble and 
vegetation around it is gradually remov- 
ed. Specialists study all aspects of the 
monument, recording its features in 
drawings and photographs. 
1885. Discovery of the “Hidden Foot”, 
bas-reliefs concealed by a retaining wall 
built to prevent the edifice from 
collapsing. 
1907-1911. Restoration work carried out 
by Theodoor Van Erp. “Thanks to him 
the disappearance of the monument was 
avoided’. He dismantles and rebuilds the 
three circular terraces and the stupas. 
1929. A new commission appointed to 
identify damage sources and propose 
means of arresting further decay. 
1950. The Republic of Indonesia joins 
the United Nations and Unesco. 
1955. Indonesia asks Unesco to advise on 
problems of counteracting stone 
weathering on Indonesian monuments, 
especially Borobudur. A comprehensive 
restoration plan is proposed. 
1967. The Indonesian Government again 
asks Unesco for technical assistance. 
1968. Experts from several countries 
carry oul on-site studies in close co- 
operation with the Indonesian Ar- 
chaeological Institute and Government 
agencies. 
January 1971. International panel 
meeting in Yogyakarta unanimously 
agrees that the only way to save 
Borobudur from distintegration is to 
dismantle and rebuild the square 
terraces. 
April 1971. Indonesia sets up the Badan 
Pemugaran Candi Borobudur {Agency 
for the Restoration of Chandi 
Borobudur) to handle all aspects of the 
restoration project... A Unesco co- 
ordinator appointed. 
December 1972. International Con- 
sultative Committee set up. Unesco laun- 
ches international appeal. 
29 January 1973. The Governinent of In- 
donesia and Unesco sign a formal agree- 
ment for the implementation of the 
Borobudur Restoration Project. On the 
same day agreements regarding volun- 
tary contributions for the preservation of 
Borobudur are also signed between 
Unesco and several donating Member 
States. A special International Trust 
Fund established, being managed by the 
Director-General of Unesco assisted by 
an Executive Committee comprising 
representatives of Member States con- 
tributing to the project. 
1975. Work begins on north facade. 
Restoration will take 7 years after 
dismantlement. 
Early 1981. Reconstruction of east and 
west facades well advanced. 
October 1982. Final restoration work 
completed. 
23 February 1983. Grand celebration in- 
augurated by the President of the 
Republic of Indonesia. 
Total cost amounts to over § 20 million, 
two-thirds of which are provided by the 
Government of Indonesia.

### 53924: How Borobudur was saved

It was originally intended to open up the bas-reliefs of the 
“Hidden Foot’ for permanent inspection by inserting a 
covered trench in the encasement around the foot of the 
monument. However, this part of the plan had to be aban- 
doned because of the risk of sliding and collapse, especially 
during earthquakes. 
A vast amount of preliminary research was carried out 
before the final design was adopted. The disciplines involved 
in these preparatory activities included: airphoto analysis, 
archaeology, architecture, chemistry, conservation tech- 
niques, engineering seismology, foundation engineering, tech- 
nology, landscape planning, meteorology, microbioloby, 
petrography, physics, soil mechanics, surveying and ter- 
restrial photogrammetry. It can ecasily be imagined hat a 
project of such complexity and magnitude as this required 
special measures for organization and management. 
International involvement at first consisted of the provi- 
sion of expert advice and assistance in the training of Indone- 
sian personnel. Then Indonesia asked Unesco to launch a 
campaign to mobilize international support for the operation 
(see box page 17). 
The execution of the project has been in Indonesian hands. 
In April 1971 the Indonesian Government established a 
special agency, the Badan Pemugaran Candi Borobudur 
(Agency for the Restoration of Chandi Borobudur). Staffed 
by senior engineers and archaeologists and assisted by scien- 
tific advisors from several universities, the autonomous 
Badan has handled all aspects of the project, technical and 
administrative, national and international. The setting up of 
the Badan and the simultaneous appointment of a Unesco

co-ordinator proved to be of the greatest benefit. Awareness 
of a common responsibility soon developed complete mutual 
understanding and the closest co-operation. 
The Badan has carried out all the photographic and non- 
photographic documentation and survey work, stone 
restoration, dismantling, stone conservation work and 
reconstruction, including the construction of the watertight 
layers behind the walls. Over 600 technicians and labourers 
have been involved.

average it took about two weeks to treat and repair each 
stone. Then the blocks had to be moved back to their million

ten thousand stones that had fallen off the building over the 
years, matching them with the existing architecture and 
finally restoring them to their original places.

The Borobudur project thus constitutes an example of 
very close multidisciplinary collaboration between a large 
number of specialists from many different fields all con- 
tributing to the preservation and better understanding of a 
monument which is a highlight in mankind’s cultural, artistic 
and technical achievements. 
It has reflected a nation’s desire to preserve its cultural 
heritage for the future; the wish of a people to permit the 
greatest possible number of persons to enjoy the artistic crea-

### 53926: Tashkent; the capital of Uzbekistan celebrates its two thousandth anniversary

TASHKENT 
The capital of Uzbekistan celebrates 
its two thousandth anniversary 
ASHKENT, the capital of the 
Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic 
and one of the major cities of cen- 
tral Asia, is two thousand years old. 
The earliest references to it occur in 
certain Chinese chronicles of the second 
century BC which speak of the oasis of 
Tashkent. A century later this oasis is 
called Yuni or Yuini, and is described as 
forming part of the powerful State of 
Kangyu, with a town of the same 
name— Yuni—at its centre. The distin- 
guished orientalist V.V. Bartold, who 
analysed these chronicles, advanced the 
theory that the region of Yuni was iden- 
tical with that now occupied by Tashkent. 
Professor M.E. Masson, a specialist in 
the history of Tashkent, came to the same 
conclusion. 
Later the region came to be known as 
Chzhesi, which apparently renders the 
Chinese pronunciation of Tashkent’s an- 
cient name, Shash or Chach. 
Information about the history of 
Tashkent is also found int the writings of 
the Greek astronomer and geographer 
Ptolemy, who refers in his Guide to 
Geography to a city called ‘‘Stone 
Tower®’. The great scholar and en- 
cyclopaedist Abu Rayhan al-Biruni 
(973-1048), who was familiar with 
Ptolemy’s work, wrote that the city 
which was called “Stone Tower’ in 
Greek was actually Binkent, the capital 
of Ash-Shash, ‘‘which in the Turkic 
tongue is Tashkand’’. 
The name Chach is found in early 
eighth-century documents originating in 
Sogdiana, the historical area which now 
forms part of Uzbekistan. The famous 
ninth-century mathematician and 
astronomer al-Khwarizmi mentions the 
names of Shash and Tarband (probably 
today’s Otrar). Valuable information 
concerning the history of medieval 
Tashkent may be gathered from Arabic, 
Persian and Turkish manuscripts of the 
ninth-twelfth centuries. The city’s ex- 
istence was known in Russia as early as 
the fourteenth century, and is mentioned 
in the “Book of the Grand Design” 
under the name of Tashkur. 
ERKIN YUSSUPOV, Soviet educator, is vice- 
president of the Academy of Sciences of the 
Uzbek SSR. He is the author of several scientific 
works.

Valley, a vast area devoted to the growing of sub-tropical crops and known as “‘the 
Pearl of Uzbekistan’’. 
  
Part of an ancient fort, dating from the 2nd or 1st century BC, excavated at the site of

were a feature of central Asian fortifications. 
the site of the ancient town of 
Manguryuk, where remains of dwellings 
and fortifications have been unearthed. 
The archaeologists have established that 
here, in the earliest years of the modern 
era, craftsmanship and trade were 
developing alongside agriculture and 
livestock-raising. 
During the Middle Ages, Tashkent 
underwent many changes of fortune. In- 
vasion first by the Arabs, then by the 
hordes of Genghis Khan, incursions by 
neighbouring nomad tribes and wars bet- 
ween the various feudal States led more 
than once to devastation and ruin, but 
the city never totally disappeared. Its 
favourable geographical position and the 
strong traditions and solid relationships 
established over the ages in the fields of 
craftsmanship and commerce, invariably 
provided the incentives for renewal. 
Restoration of the natural tributaries of 
the Chirchik river, the construction of 
canals, the transformation of the city in- 
to a major commercial, industrial and 
cultural centre and the growth of new ur- 
ban settlements in the vicinity all con- 
solidated the reputation of Chach as “the 
land of a thousand cities.”’ 
The Middle Ages were a period of great 
expansion for Tashkent, Its skilled crafts- 
men produced metal tools, weapons, 
decorative objects and household articles 
of the highest quality. Others excelled at 
processing farm products, and others still 
produced cotton and wool textiles, pot- 
tery and glassware. In terms of the 
. number of its merchants, Tashkent held 
third place among the great trading cen- 
tres of central Asia, after Bukhara and 
Samarkand. At the same time, the 
world’s scientific and cultural heritage 
was enriched by the achievements of the 
many scholars and writers who have lived 
and worked in Tashkent. These have in- 
cluded the philosopher, poet and 
theologian Abubakir Kaffalon Shoshi 
(10th century), the physician Abu Ab- 
dullakh Mukhammad ibn Yusup al [loki

Ubaidulla ibn Yusup Ali Alkakhal (16th 
century), the poets Badir Chachi (14th 
century), Kulfat (18th century) and 
Komy Tashkandi (19th century) and the 
linguist Kamaliddin Khafuz Kokhakki 
(16th century). 
The development of production, com- 
merce, science and culture in ancient and 
medieval Tashkent did not take place in a 
backwater. Study of the objects unearthed 
by archaeologists, of manuscripts, ar- 
chitecture, and the age-old trades and 
ceremonial customs of the people of 
Tashkent reveals a combination of purely 
local traditions with influences from 
other lands. This is not surprising; 
peoples and cultures cannot develop in 
isolation. As a result of immemorial links 
with- neighbouring regions and with the 
more distant countries of the east, the 
cultural traditions, the language and the 
literature of Chach underwent external 
influences and in turn exercised their own 
influence elsewhere. 
The seventeenth and eighteenth cen- 
turies saw a strengthening of commercial 
and economic ties between Tashkent and 
Russia, as the mutual advantage of such 
relationships became increasingly ap- 
parent. The merchants of Tashkent 
travelled to the Russian frontier towns of 
Siberia. In 1739-1740, the first Russian 
caravan made its way to Tashkent from 
the newly-established city of Orenburg, 
in the Urals. 
The absorption of Tashkent, together 
with the whole of central Asia, into the 
Russian empire in the second half of the 
nineteenth century opened a new chapter 
in the city’s history. The seemingly 
endless period of internecine wars came 
to an end, industry continued to develop, 
and by the beginning of the twentieth 
century Tashkent had been transformed 
into the economic, cultural and ad- 
ministrative centre of the governorate- 
general of a multinational province, 
Turkestan. 
After the October Revolution of 1917, 
the city began to expand more rapidly 
than ever before, thanks to the 
disinterested and fraternal collaboration 
of the different peoples of our country. 
During the darkest days of the Civil War, 
a decree adopted on the initiative of V.I. 
Lenin created the first institution of 
higher education in the Soviet East—the 
Turkestan State University, which at- 
tracted noted scholars from Moscow, 
Petrograd and other cities. A ‘science 
train’’ carrying books, personnel and 
equipment set out from Moscow and ar- 
rived two months later at Tashkent, 
whose people will never forget the names 
of the engineers, teachers and doctors 
who fostered the rapid development of 
education, health services, science and 
culture, and who did so much to 
eradicate illiteracy, build new schools, 
and create institutions of higher educa- 
tion and scientific and cultural centres. 
In a relatively short time, Tashkent 
became a major centre of sdcial, 
economic and intellectual progress for 
the whole of central Asia, as the city 
where many writers, politicians, scien- 
tists and intellectuals from all the Central 
Asian republics and from Kazakhstan 
came to complete their education.

### 53926: Tashkent; the capital of Uzbekistan celebrates its two thousandth anniversary

» Between 1941 and 19435, the city played 
an important part in the struggle against 
the Hitlerite invaders. Hundreds of 
thousands of its people fought valiantly 
on the battlefields. As a city far behind 
the front, Tashkent gave refuge to hun- 
dreds of thousands of evacuees from the 
areas then occupied by the Nazis, 
lavishing particular care on the children 
who had lost both parents during the 
fighting. Among the moving episodes of 
this period, the exemplary behaviour of 
Shaakhmed Shamakhmudov, a foundry- 
worker, and his wife is still remembered. 
During the darkest time of the war they 
adopted and brought up no fewer than 
fifteen orphans of eight different na- 
tionalities. Their gesture was emulated by 
tens of thousands of their fellow-citizens, 
who became foster-parents to children in 
similar circumstances.

people from . sixty countries study 
alongside Soviet students in more than 
twenty establishments of higher educa- 
tion. There are a large number of 
technical high schools and hundreds of 
primary and secondary schools. The 
quality of the city’s medical services is 
high. 
It would be difficult to enumerate all 
the features of life in this effervescent, 
kaleidoscopic modern city. Tashkent 
regularly hosts meetings of writers from 
Asian, African and Latin American 
countries. Its international film festivals, 
eight of which have been held since 1968, 
have won a high reputation. Every year 
international conferences and symposia 
are held on themes related to social pro- 
gress, science and technology. All these 
activities contribute to the strengthening 
of mutual understanding, friendship and 
peace among peoples. The international 
prestige of Tashkent is also reflected in 
the fact that it was there that the leaders 
of India and Pakistan met in January 
[966 to settle a number of controversial 
issues between their two countries; the 
result of this meeting was the historic 
“Tashkent Declaration”.

tourists, Tashkent is a member of the 
United Towns Organization and has 
special links with Tunis, Skopje, Mar- 
rakesh, Potiala, Seattle, Tripoli and a 
number of other cities. 
The two millennia of Tashkent’s 
history are spanned by an invisible 
bridge, whose outline may nevertheless 
be discerned in the city’s architecture and 
also in the domains of science, literature 
and art. The songs, dances, poetry, music 
and popular wisdom of ancient Chach, 
constantly enriched through contacts 
with the cultural achievements of dif- 
ferent countries during different periods 
in history, have won their place in the 
modern world. 
Modern dance, spoken poetry, and the 
applied arts are not merely echoes from a 
distant past; they are also achievements 
of our times. Traditions of popular crafts- 
manship acquired during generations of 
meticulous labour find a place in modern 
industry. Cloth woven of gold thread, 
national costumes and decorative art ob- 
jects are universally admired. The 
dancers of the Uzbek State Ensemble 
‘““Bakhor’ and the singers and in- 
strumentalists of the ‘‘Yalla’’ and 
‘“‘Navo’ companies combine the tradi- 
tional and the modern in their 
repertoires. 
Drama has also followed a long path 
from past to present in Tashkent, whose 
people took pride in the fact that the 
Uzbek Academy of Music, the Alisher 
Navoi, was selected to represent the 
USSR at the 1982 Berlin International 
Opera Festival. 
This fusion of the traditional and the 
contemporary finds an echo in the hearts 
of millions of people, whatever their 
aspirations. May the invisible bridge 
which spans Tashkent’s two thousand 
years of history serve the cause of peace, 
brotherhood and friendship between all 
peoples of the West and the East.

» are gradually being concentrated in the 
Institute of Manuscripts of the Academy 
of Sciences. However, the richest collec- 
tion is that of the Abu Rayhan al-Biruni 
Institute of Oriental Studies. 
At present the Institute’s manuscript 
holdings amount to more than 18,000 
volumes containing over 40,000 works, 
as well as a considerable collection of 
deeds and official documents evoking the 
grandeur and decline of the feudal States 
of central Asia. 
The manuscripts cover a period of 
almost a thousand years from the mid- 
tenth to the early twentieth centuries and 
an area ranging from the Near East to 
northern India, Iran, the Arab countries 
and the Maghreb. 
For the most part, the texts are in 
languages which were common in the 
Muslim East during the Middle Ages: 
Arabic, Persian and various Turkic 
languages. Urdu and Pushtu are also 
represented. 
Thematically, the manuscripts encom- 
pass virtually all the domains of medieval 
written culture—the natural and exact 
sciences, the humanities (history, poetics 
and philology), literature, music, ar- 
chitecture and philosophy. Some are 
devoted to Islamic themes: the Qur’an, 
the Qur’anic sciences, the hadith, 
jurisprudence, Sufism, and other cur- 
rents of Islamic thought. Others are con- 
cerned with various crafts, with 
agriculture, commerce, and with subjects 
related to construction. There are many 
dictionaries, encyclopaedias, glossaries 
and other works of reference. 
Some of the manuscripts are unique, 
either because copies are to be found 
nowhere elsc in the world’s archives, 
because they constitute the most com- 
plete example of a given text, because no 
earlier version exists, or because as works 
of art they have no equal. 
One outstanding example in the 
Museum of the Peoples of Uzbekistan is 
the seventh-century Qur’an of Uthman, 
transcribed on parchment. A unique 
specimen of the treatise on chemistry by 
ar-Rhazes (ninth-tenth centuries) 
discovered in the Institute of Oriental 
Studies is a valuable source of knowledge 
concerning research in the natural 
sciences in the medieval East. 
The Institute also contains several 
works by the great Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 
tenth-eleventh centuries), notably several 
pages from his Canon of Medicine, the 
oldest of which dates from the thirteenth 
century. There are many works by Al- 
Biruni (tenth-eleventh centuries) the most 
precious being a copy of his en- 
cyclopaedic work “The Book of 
Understanding of the Elements of 
Astrology’’ which deals with matters 
related to astronomy, mathematics, 
geodesy and other subjects. The 
manuscript dates from the thirteenth cen- 
tury and is considered to be one of the 
oldest transcriptions of this text. 
A unique seventeenth-century volume 
entitled ‘‘Collected Writings of Wise 
Men’ contains 107 treatises by the great 
thinkers and scholars of Antiquity and 
the Middle Ages: Aristotle, Plato and 
Galen among the Greeks; Al-Kindi, Ibn 
28 
Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Badzh among 
the Arabs; Farabi and Ibn Sina from cen- 
tral Asia; Bakhmaniar from Azerbaijan; 
and many others. These documents 
create a complex picture of the intellec- 
tual inquiry and philosophical systems of 
the great minds of the past. The 
manuscript was written in Damascus, 
doubtless by an amateur of philosophy 
who devoted much of his time to collec- 
ting philosophical works. 
In the Middle Ages literature and 
especially poetry constituted the most 
widespread and popular form of express- 
ing spiritual and emotional experience. 
They were also, especially in the hands of 
the great masters of verbal expression, a 
means of transmitting popular wisdom, 
ding musician who introduced many in- 
novations into Indian music and is con- 
sidered to have invented the sitar. He 
wrote on many subjects but he was most 
famous of all in India for the songs which 
he wrote in the Hindi vernacular. The 
copy in the Institute’s possession is par- 
ticularly valuable because three of the 
five poems were transcribed by the great 
poet Hafiz (fourteenth century). 
Another of the Institute’s treasures is 
an album containing original letters by 
fifteenth-century scholars, poets and 
writers compiled for the Uzbek poet and 
statesman Ali Shir Navoi. It includes let- 
ters by the famous Abd al Rahman 
Djami. These letters deal with the social, 
economic and cultural life of Khorassan

The poetry of the medieval East is 
represented in the Institute’s archives by 
the works of great artists of central Asia, 
India, Iran, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, 
and the Arab countries. Examples in- 
clude a fourteenth-century copy of a 
peom "by Yusuf Balassagun entitled 
“Knowledge, bringer of happiness”. 
The archives also contain a unique ex- 
ample of the Khamsah (*‘Pentology’’) by 
the great fourteenth-century Indian poet 
Amir Khusru. In the words of Jawaharlal 
Nehru, Khusru was an outstanding poet 
who wrote mainly in Persian but was also 
a master of Sanskrit. He was an outstan- 
and central Asia in the fifteenth century 
and constitute an invaluable document 
for the study of the history of the empire 
of the Timurids. 
Works by medieval historians are well 
represented in the Institute’s holdings. 
They include a twenty-volume universal 
history by Ibn al-Assiri and a history of 
the ancient and medieval world by Ibn 
Muhammad al-Djuwayni (thirteenth cen- 
tury). The pearl of the collection is an 
early (fourteenth century) copy of a text 
by Rashidaddin ibn Imadovla, who was 
famous throughout the East. There are 
also Uzbek translations of historical 
works in Arabic and Persian, from the 
seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries.

Some of these manuscripts are 
veritable works of art. Their pages are 
embellished with brightly coloured orien- 
tal designs and illuminated with gold 
paint, and the texts are executed in ex- 
quisite calligraphy. Works by the great 
poets Firdusi, Nizami, Saadi, Navoi, 
Amir Khusru, Hafiz and Dzhami are 
decorated with miniatures of exceptional 
artistic quality. 
All these manuscripts, which relate to 
different periods in the history of the 
peoples of a vast region, constitute an 
irreplaceable source of information 
concerning the social, economic and 
spiritual life of the peoples of the Near 
and Middle East, of central Asia, India, 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and eastern 
China. 
Before the October Revolution of 
1917, the department of Eastern 
Manuscripts of the Tashkent Public 
Library, whose archives formed the basis 
of the collection now conserved by the 
Al-Biruni Institute, possessed no more 
than a few hundred works. Today the In- 
stitute’s holdings are growing every year 
thanks to subventions from the 
Government. 
There is also an active programme for 
the exchange of microfilms with other 
manuscript archives throughout the 
world. The Institute already possesses 
more than 3,000 microfilms. Each year it 
receives hundreds of requests for 
photocopies of rare texts from the United 
States, the Federal Republic of Germany, 
Afghanistan, the Arab countries, India, 
Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, 
and other countries. Research students 
from many countries come to work at the 
Institute. 
In recent decades, the orientalists of 
xe HEIR R58 
BA PT EP 
onl X — = A 
Uzbekistan have done much to place the 
study of manuscripts on a more 
systematic footing. Ten volumes of 
manuscripts have already been published 
and three more are in preparation. There 
is also an ongoing programme for the 
publication of catalogues of works by in- 
dividual thinkers and poets. Manuscripts 
belonging to the Al-Biruni Institute also 
formed the basis for the publication in 
Russian and Uzbek for the first time of 
Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine, in six 
volumes; a six-volume selection of works 
by Al-Biruni; a multi-volume edition of 
the works of the great Uzbek poet Ali 
Shir Navoi; works by Farabi, the 
‘Aristotle of the East’’; as well as works 
by Zahir ud-din Babur, and the tenth- 
eleventh century historians Narshakhi 
and Baikhaki, and other writers. 
Preparations are currently being made 
to celebrate the 1,200th anniversary of 
the birth of the great scholar Mukhamm- 
ed ibn Moussa al-Khorezmi, whose name 
is linked with the invention of algebra 
and the logarithm. Plans have been made 
for the first-ever edition, in Russian and 
Uzbek, of his major works on 
mathematics, astronomy and geography. 
The work of the Institute of Oriental 
Studies on the rich cultural heritage of 
the peoples of the East has been recogniz- 
ed by the award of the first International 
Avicenna Prize. The study and publica- 
tion of the works of the great humanists 
of the East, the propagation of their 
noble ideals, the strengthening of scien- 
tific contacts and the exchange of 
manuscript material make an important 
contribution to international cultural and 
scientific co-operation and hence to 
friendship between peoples.

Norway—constitutes the most densely

fact, the historical development of nor-

temperate influence of the Gulf 
Stream. Without this warm current the

Finland and Norway north of the Arc- 
tic Circle. It is not easy to say how 
many of them are Laplanders since on- 
ly Finland has attempted to define what 
might be called the “Lapp ethnic 
group’ and the criteria on which this 
definition is based are not accepted in 
either Sweden or Norway. In Finland, 
a person who speaks Lapp as his 
primary language or whose parents or 
one of whose sets of grandparents 
spoke Lapp is considered to be a 
Laplander. On the basis of this defini- 
tion the Laplanders of Finland elect a 
representative body commonly called 
the “Lapp Parliament”, yet the situa- 
tion remains paradoxical since Lapp 
does not have the status of an official 
language and in the statistics it is not 
recognized as a mother tongue.

Definition of a “Lapp cultural iden- 
tity’ is an even trickier question in the 
neighbouring countries of .Sweden and 
Norway, where the Lapp ethos has 
always been closely linked with 
reindeer herding, to such an extent 
that, at times, only Lapp reindeer 
farmers have been considered 
Laplanders. 
In 1973, Lapp territory was defined 
in Finland as consisting of the com- 
mons of Enontekid, Inari and Utsjoki 
and the Lapp community’s domain of 
Sodankyld. It was at this time that 
language was designated as the 
criterion for belonging to the Lapp peo- 
ple. This definition increased the Lapp 
population of Finland to somewhat 
more than 4,500 people, ten per cent of 
whom live outside their territory, in 
southern Finland or abroad. This may 
appear at first glance a conservative 
estimate. 
Sweden and Norway undertook 
demographic studies of the Laplanders 
in the 1970s. It was found that while the 
Swedish Lapp population numbered 
from 17,000 to 20,000 individuals, only 
2,000 of them were reindeer farmers. 
Norway was found to have approx- 
imately 2,500 Lapp reindeer farmers, 
for eighty per cent of whom reindeer 
farming was their main professional ac- 
tivity, out of a total of between 35,000 
and 50,000 Laplanders. These figures

During their seasonal migrations reindeer herds cover very considerable distances, ranging in Norway, for example, from 300 to 
400 kilometres. Special agreements allow the reindeer herders, who live a nomadic or semi-nomadic life, to cross the national fron- 
tiers of the Scandinavian States with their herds. 
do not take into account the coastal 
Lapps, the “Maritime Laplanders”, 
who pose extremely complicated prob- 
lems of cultural identity. Thus it ap- 
pears that neither the use of the Lapp 
language nor the practice of reindeer 
farming are adequate criteria for judg- 
ing who is to be included in the Lapp 
population. 
The wild reindeer, from which our 
modern herds are descended, were at 
one time to be found throughout the 
northern hemisphere. From very early 
times the species branched out into two 
distinct types: the arctic mountain 
reindeer and the forest reindeer, 
adapted to the conifer forest zone. The 
nordic reindeer is descended from the 
mountain reindeer, while the forest 
reindeer, increasingly rare, has almost 
A Lapp reindeer-farmer feeds his herd. In the Finnoscandinavian countries, with the 
growth of domesticated herds,pasturelands are coming under pressure and at times the 
reindeer are faced with local shortages of graze.

disappeared from the Finnoscandina- 
vian environment. 
Traditional forms of domestic 
reindeer husbandry have survived only 
in Eurasia. Broadly speaking, all the 
Eurasian zone north of the zero degree 
isotherm can be considered reindeer- 
raising territory. Of the world’s four 
and a half million reindeer, about three 
million are domesticated, seventy- 
seven per cent in the Soviet Union, 
twenty-one per cent in North America, 
and much smaller numbers in Scotland 
and Greenland. Small herds have also 
been relocated in remote places such as 
the islands adjacent to the Antarctic 
continent, where they have adapted 
very well. 
According to Soviet specialists, there 
is enough pastureland in the USSR to 
maintain three and a half million 
reindeer, while North America is 
estimated to have pasturage available 
to feed three million. But in the Nordic 
countries the number of reindeer can- 
not be appreciably increased; the 
Swedish and Finnish pasturelands are 
overgrazed and from time to time in 
certain areas reindeer herds are faced 
with famine. 
There are four principal zones of 
Eurasian reindeer-raising. To the ex- 
treme east the nomadic Chukchi and 
Koryaks raise very large herds. They 
use reindeer as draught animals and as »

a source of milk. In western Eurasia, 
however, the Lapps-have developed a 
totally or semi-nomadic husbandry 
with the reindeer serving as both pack - 
and draught animals as well as for the 
production of milk. On the Soviet 
coastline of the Arctic Ocean, the total- 
ly nomadic Samoyed* use their reindeer 
neither for milk nor as pack animals. 
The forest Tungus, the Soyots and their 
neighbours, who occupy a small area 
between the Samoyeds and Chukchi 
and the Koryaks, are semi-nomadic 
reindeer farmers, milking their herds 
and using them as beasts of burden as 
well as for breeding. 
Man’s first contact with reindeer was 
Modern Lapp nomads use snowmobiles, 
to follow and round up their herds. 
as prey to be hunted and snared by 
means of traps, ditches and stockades. 
Many traces of reindeer-herding 
civilizations are to be found in Finland, 
but little is known of more ancient 
times when reindeer were exclusively 
hunters’ prey. At Jiebmaluokta, near 
Alta, however, a rock carving has been 
found which depicts an enclosure for 
reindeer. It is in the shape of a four- 
leafed clover in which were enclosed 
reindeer and elk. Several reindeer are to 
be seen entering the enclosure while a 
hunter, goad in hand, is herding them 
into a corner. Since this carving is 
thought to be between 5,500 and 6,000 
years old, it would appear that a fairly 
sophisticated form of reindeer hunting 
was practised by the coastal Lapps as 
far back as 3,000 BC. 
* The editors of the Unesco Courierwish to point 
out that the Russian word “‘Samoyed” is used in 
English and in many other languages as a purely 
technical term without reference to its original 
sense. 
The coastal Laplanders were, 
perhaps, the first to domesticate the 
reindeer in Scandinavia. At first the 
reindeer were used as harness, pack and 
decoy animals, and for their milk. Not 
yet very numerous, the reindeer accom- 
panied these primitive semi-nomadic 
hunters in their search for game. As the 
wild reindeer became more and more 
scarce, the Laplanders increased the 
size of their domesticated herds and in 
their search for pasturelands gradually 
became totally nomadic. 
The first written evidence of reindeer 
raising is contained in tax registers of 
the 14th and 15th centuries. Since the 
reign of Gustavus Vasa, the sovereigns 
motor-driven snow scooters, 
of Sweden have recognized the siidas 
(traditional Lapp administrative 
districts), by virtue of which Lapland 
was separated by a frontier from the 
rest of the realm. Recent jurisprudence 
seems to be unanimous in accepting 
that since that epoch the right of the 
Laplander to raise reindeer has not 
been only a recognized, but also a 
transmissible, hereditary, right. 
At the end of the 17th century, 
Lapland was still an undivided region 
situated on the frontiers of the Nordic 
States. The separation of the Kingdoms 
of Denmark-Norway and of Sweden- 
Finland, which was agreed to at 
Strémstad in 1751, had significant 
repercussions on the Laplanders’ rights 
and way of life. An annex to the treaty 
of Stromstad specified that the Lapps 
could cross the new frontier and make 
use of the land and waters for husban- 
dry and fishing, but could own taxable 
land in one State only. In addition, they 
had to choose between Norwegian and 
Swedish nationality. The Lapps lost 
these rights when the frontier was clos- 
ed, first in 1852, then in 1854 and 1889. 
The annex to the treaty of 1751 con- 
tinues nevertheless to exert a certain in- 
fluence in Sweden and Norway. Thus, in 
1972, the two countries ratified an agree- 
ment about the reindeer pasturelands, 
according the Lapps of the siidas in 
Sweden the right to use certain frontier 
land on the Norwegian side as spring 
and summer pasturage, the Lapps of 
Norway having, reciprocally, the right 
to use certain regions in Sweden for 
winter pasture. As it now stands, the 
agreement is criticized on both sides; it 
seems to put the economic interests 
related to reindeer-raising before the 
political and national interests of the 
Lapp community. 
In Sweden and Norway, an essential 
aspect of the annual reindeer-raising 
cycle is the transhumance between 
various seasonal pasturelands. These 
migrations in Sweden follow ancient 
custom, respecting the boundaries bet- 
ween the siidas. In Norway, these 
migratory movements can cover 
distances of up to 400 kilometres, going 
from high mountain terrain to the 
coastal archipelago of the Arctic Ocean 
in the summer, and in the opposite 
direction in the fall. Often a number of 
communities follow the same itinerary, 
the herds setting out at intervals of a 
few weeks. 
By means of what is designated as a 
“reindeer-raising concession’’, the 
right to raise reindeer is being granted

throw new light on the question of

reindeer-raising domain of Finland 
corresponds to the territories of the an-

that the majority of today’s reindeer 
farmers are its lawful ‘owners. Should 
these ancient rights be recognized, if 
only in part, the protection of the 
reindeer pasturelands and the defence of 
the traditional Lapp way of life would 
undoubtedly be greatly strengthened.

HE ending of the arms race and 
) the achievement of disarmament 
have become a fundamental 
challenge of primary importance and 
urgency. Under the present cir- 
cumstances of grave international ten- 
sion the attainment of real disarma- 
ment measures has emerged as the main 
path to the revival of the policy of 
détente, mutual confidence and co-

A strategy 
for disarmament 
by Constantin Ene 
  
Since its inception the United Na- 
tions has devoted much time and effort 
to international action for disarma- 
ment. Yet, even today the traditional 
way pursued by humanity—the search 
for security through the possession of 
arms—still has a strong appeal. Effi- 
cient action in favour of disarmament, 
commensurate with its intended goal, 
should include, along with a strong 
political campaign, a reasoned orga- 
nization of efforts. 
Disarmament requires deeper insight 
and analysis. The first special session of 
the United Nations General Assembly 
devoted to disarmament had this in

mind when it proclaimed a ‘‘strategy’’ 
for disarmament. Unesco has also tried 
to achieve the same objective by apply- 
ing international co-operation in the 
fields of education, science, culture and 
information to the search for ways of 
removing obstacles to disarmament 
and of stimulating further thought and 
action. 
The main task of the second United 
Nations Special Session on Disarma- 
ment, held in June 1982, was to develop 
these efforts further. A prospective 
view on disarmament should discover 
in the investigation of the arms race 
and its dynamic not only the roots of

the escalating spiral of competition 
but, above all, the source of a dynamic 
and a more rational approach towards 
disarmament. 
The existence of nuclear weapons 
and the continuing arms race have 
brought the world to a very critical 
juncture, 
In military terms the accumulated 
destructive power, especially of nuclear 
weapons, the emergence of a new 
military technology and the armament 
dynamic pose a most serious threat to 
international peace and security and 
confront mankind with the prospect of 
self-extinction. In economic terms, the 
arms race causes a huge wastage of 
financial, material and human 
resources, produces particularly grave 
distorting and destabilizing effects on 
economic growth and considerably 
diminishes the economic and social ad- 
vancement of all peoples; in political 
terms, it perpetuates the use and the: 
threat of force in international life, 
hinders” the solution of other vital 
problems facing mankind and stifles in- 
novating processes. 
Historical experience proves that 
periods of détente were never accom- 
panied by a relaxation of the arms race. 
This is, in fact, one of the reasons 
behind the unprecedented tension we 
are experiencing in international life to- 
day. And the existing tension is used as 
an excuse to step up the arms race even 
more feverishly. 
Indeed the early part of the current 
decade shows clear signs of a new 
round of arms escalation, under the 
powerful impact of modern military 
technology, which is destabilizing by its : 
nature, and of new military doctrines. . )

time and war-time periods. WAR. Oil on canvas by Dado. 
   
Of special gravity is the deployment 
of nuclear missiles of intermediate 
range in Europe, on a continent where 
the existing vast arsenals, of nuclear 
weapons alone, already pose an in- 
calculable threat to the European na- 
tions and where the two military . 
alliances face each other. 
The seriousness of the present condi- 
tion is evinced by the fact that the 
reassessment of the military and 
strategic relationship is being under- 
taken against a background of an un- 
precedented exacerbation of interna- 
tional tension, in a world climate load- 
ed with numerous unsolved complex 
problems and dominated by acute 
mistrust. Any of these moments of ten- 
sion could become the trigger of partial 
or all out use of existing weapons, in- 
cluding nuclear ones.

Unger Franz (Austria) 
» debates and the negotiations held dur- 
ing the past two decades, which pro- 
duced no more than resolutions on 
disarmament, while the arms race, far 
from being slowed down, was given a 
new and strong impetus. 
It is obvious that mankind has reach- 
ed a deadlock which can be overcome 
only by a new and courageous ap- 
proach. More than twenty-five years 
ago Bertrand Russell and Albert Eins- 
tein said: ‘We have to learn to think in 
a new way. We have to learn to ask 
ourselves not what steps can be taken to 
give military victory to whatever group 
we prefer, for there no longer are such 
steps; the question we have to ask 
ourselves is: what steps can be taken to 
prevent a military contest of which the 
issye must be disastrous to all parties’. 
The new approach, based on the 
analysis and the appreciation of past 
experiences should necessarily be 
multidimensional. 
The essential factor is the political 
will of governments to overcome the in- 
ertia imposed by the technological arms 
race. International effort always pro- 
ceeds from the national effort. To that 
end States should give disarmament 
priority in their foreign policy, par- 
ticipate in good faith in negotiations, 
seek and propose solutions to the ex- 
isting problems and take unilateral in- 
itiatives, when necessary, as a 
demonstration of good will and 
readiness to increase mutual con- 
fidence. At times of tension, like the 
one we are experiencing, unilateral in- 
itiatives are especially important. 
History convincingly reveals the 
value of such initiatives in the field of 
disarmament. A positive experiment 
was the decision taken by the USA and 
the USSR in 1964-1965 to announce in- 
dividual reduction of their military ex- 
penditure on the basis of ‘‘mutual 
example’. 
National example and unilateral in- 
itiative may play an important role as a 
36 
  
  
Hassan Rizig-alla Taha (Sudan) 
confidence building measure. However, 
only on the basis of negotiated measures, 
under strict international control, can 
disarmament be achieved. 
A new approach to disarmament re- 
quires a fundamental revision of the at- 
titude of States, primarily of the heavi- 
ly armed States, towards the concept of 
security. 
The accumulation of weapons, par- 
ticularly nuclear weapons, today con- 
stitutes much more of a threat than a 
protection. It is high time therefore, to 
put an end to this situation and seek 
guaranteed security by way of disarma- 
ment. Real security can be obtained on- 
ly through arms reduction and disar- 
mament. Since the arms race contains 
in itself the cause of disruption of the 
very military balance it seeks, the 
military balance must be sought at 
steadily lower levels. 
Disarmament has become an integral 
component of national security. The 
history of the last two decades, 
characterized by the departure from 
disarmament efforts and their replace- 
ment by arms control, i.e. controlled 
joint armaments, evinces the fact that 
the policy of arms control cannot con- 
stitute the way of achieving genuine 
progress towards disarmament. 
When agreements of this type were 
reached in the past—a particularly dif- 
ficult process, with the slow pace of the 
negotiations being constantly surpassed 
bythe fast-moving military technological 
innovations, with destabilizing effects— 
the ceilings established under the 
respective agreements were so high that 
they served merely to codify a still 
greater competition and a massive and 
steady growth of nuclear armaments. 
The arms control policy did not lead 
to disarmament nor did it help build a 
real and durable relaxation of tension. 
The only viable alternative is a com- 
prehensive long-term programme of 
genuine disarmament, within an agreed 
step-by-step framework, leading to the

THE ARMS 
RACE 
In 1981, the United Nations 
launched an international poster 
competition on the theme of disar- 
mament. On these pages we pre- 
sent a selection from the 66 of- 
ficial entries from United Nations 
Member States. The winning 
poster was by Gerhard Voigt of the 
German Democratic Republic (see

ultimate goal of general and complete 
disarmament. 
Resolute action in favour of disar- 
mament must be organically integrated 
into a long-term policy designed to 
bring about the ultimate removal of 
force and war from international life. 
History proves that as long as the 
military balance is considered the cor- 
nerstone of an international system 
based on force, in particular on 
military force, the search for such a 
balance will only serve to conceal the 
steadily soaring arms spiral, with all its 
consequences for the peace, security 
and progress of mankind. 
The conclusion of international 
treaties, both at world and regional 
levels, on non-resort to the use and 
threat of force in relations between 
States, as well as of international in- 
struments to secure the settlement of all 
disputes between them by peaceful 
means only, could substantially favour 
progress towards disarmament. 
By the same token, due considera- 
tion should be given to the natural rela- 
tionship between détente and disarma- 
ment, since progress achieved in the 
field of détente is complementary to, 
and mutually conditional on progress 
in the field of disarmament. 
Disarmament should be tackled in 
direct relation with the social and 
economic needs of States, in particular 
of developing countries. 
The relationship between disarma- 
ment and development embodies two 
facets of one and the same imperative, 
namely, reshaping international struc- 
tures and the system of traditional rela- 
tions based on inequality and on 
dominance by the more powerful. 
Linking disarmament to develop- 
ment efforts may open new vistas and 
provide new levers capable of setting 
the disarmament process on a new 
course, one which would meet the 
needs of the broad masses of the people 
and eliminate economic underdevelop- 
ment. Such an approach could 
materialize in a broad international ac- 
tion aimed at the freezing and reduc- 
tion of military budgets. 
Any innovating approach to disar- 
mament efforts should be based on the 
active participation and contribution 
by all States. Disarmament is a matter 
of vital concern to all countries and 
peoples, whether big or small, irrespec- 
tive of their military force or the types 
of weapons they possess. Therefore 
decisions in this field can no longer be 
taken by a restricted group of States. 
As a corollary of this, the United 
Nations should be the focus of inter- 
national activities devoted to 
disarmament. 
The arms race directly affects the life 
and security of the people around the 
world. Therefore they should be the 
first to have a say in disarmament 
negotiations and be able to protect their 
own interests. 
Public opinion has been lulled into 
apathy by arguments that problems of 
armaments, because of the high 
technology involved, are too complex 
to be understood and dealt with by 
non-experts. The latest mass participa- 
tion in peace demonstrations all over 
the world indicates mark a new mo- 
mentum in the history of disarmament. 
It should become the central task of 
peace education to raise societal con- 
sciousness and activate public opinion to 
try to bring about change. As the presi- 
dent of Romania put it ‘‘one should not 
expect to solve the vital problems of 
mankind at the negotiating table only. 
The masses should defend by their own 
force, the life, security and future 
development of human civilization. It 
is the masses who will be able to impose 
disarmament...” 
A primordial role devolves upon 
scientists, who are best situated to

know the dangers overshadowing 
mankind as a result of the huge ac- 
cumulation of nuclear weapons and of 
other means of destruction. Conse- 
quently, they must be provided with 
adequate conditions enabling them to 
voice their views at the United Nations, 
in the Geneva Committee on disarma- 
ment and in other negotiating fora. 
Implementation of dynamic -ton- 
cepts in the field of disarmament re- 
quires efficient debating and 
negotiating fora. The first United Na- 
tions Special Session on Disarmament 
created a more democratic machinery. 
It is essential now to use it more effi- 
ciently. Far from being a matter of 
form, the institutional and the pro- 
cedural aspects of the negotiating 
bodies have a direct impact on the very 
content of the work. They may provide 
or, on the contrary, deprive the 
negotiating machinery of the necessary 
instruments to mobilize the political 
will of States. In this respect, the con- 
duct of negotiations outside military 
alliances, which, by definition, 
stimulate mistrust and confrontation, 
is of special importance. 
The task of the day is to resume the 
disarmament negotiations. The decisive 
factor for achieving genuine results is 
the political will of States, especially of 
those possessing nuclear weapons. This 
goal can only be reached by the mo- 
bilization of governments, political 
organizations and social forces favour- 
ing disarmament, by encouraging the 
peoples and public opinion all over the 
world to work together and to 
recognize the urgent need to halt and 
reverse the arms race, in particular the 
nuclear arms race. The international 
organizations—the United Nations, 
Unesco and other specialized institu- 
tions—can make a major contribution 
to developing international action in 
order to reach this goal.

Unesco issues medal 
for Fez campaign 
The latest medal issued by Unesco in sup- 
port of its campaigns to safeguard the 
cultural heritage is devoted to the city of 
Fez (Morocco). The first capital of the Sheri- 
fian empire of the Maghreb, Fez was found- 
ed at the end of the second century of the 
Hegirg (8th century AD). For over 30 years 
the old Medina of Fez has been the site of 
social and economic developments which 
have disturbed its traditional balance and 
threatened its architectural heritage and 
spiritual values. In recent years the Moroc- 
can Government has undertaken a vast ef- 
fort to safeguard Fez, and in 1976 Unesco 
decided to support this effort by an interna- 
tional campaign. Launching the campaign 
in April 1980, the Director-General of 
Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, de- 
clared: "Fez must be saved. For its popula- 
tion whose well-being is linked to its 
renovation; for Morocco, whose spintual 
capital it remains; for the Islamic world for 
which it is a unique testimony of the many 
cultural achievements of Islam; and finally 
for the whole international community, for, 
as the precious inheritance of all, it now 
belongs to the common heritage of 
mankind”, 
Enquiries about the medal, struck at the 
Paris Mint in gold, silver and bronze, should 
be addressed to: Philatelic and Numismatic 
Programme, Unesco, 7 Place de Fontenoy, 
75700 Paris. 
136 sites on World Heritage List 
Twenty-four sites of outstanding cultural 
or natural interest have been added to the 
World Heritage List by the World Heritage 
Committee, which met at Unesco’s Paris 
headquarters from 13 to 17 December 
1982 under the chairmanship of Mr. R.O. 
Slatyer, of Australia. The Committee, which 
consists of delegates from 24 States, has 
the task of implementing the Convention 
ROOM 
for the Protection of the World's Cultural 
and Natural Heritage which was adopted by 
Unesco’s General Conference in 1972. The 
Convention came into force in 1975, and 
has now been ratified or accepted by 69 
States. The 24 sites added to the List, 
bringing its total number to 136, are: the 
Tassilli n’Ajjer, the M’Zab valley, Djémila, 
Tipasa and Timgad (Algeria}; the national 
parks of western Tasmania and the Lord 
Howe Islands (Australia); the historic town 
centre of Olinda (Brazil); the Tai National 
Park (lvory Coast); the old city of Havana 
and its fortifications (Cuba); the historic 
Cahokia mounds of illinois (USA}; the Royal 
Salt Works at Arc-et-Senans (France); the 
historic national park, the Laferriére citadel, 
the Sans-Souci palace and the site of Les 
Ramiers (Haiti}; the Rio Platano biosphere 
reserve (Honduras); the historic centre of 
Florence (ltaly}; the archaeological sites of 
Leptis Magna, Sabratha and Cyrene 
(Shahhat) (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya); the 
Aldabra Atoll (the Seychelles); the Holy City 
of Anuradhadpura, the historic city of 
Polonnaruva and the ancient city of Sigiriya 
(Sri Lanka); the Selous game reserve (Tan- 
zania); and the ancient town of Shibam and 
its wall {Democratic Republic of Yemen). 
“Space Flight’ sculpture 
presented to Unesco 
A bronze statuette entitled ‘Space 
Flight” has been presented to Unesco by 
the Government of the USSR. The 
sculpture, which depicts a young woman 
springing into space holding out an open 
book, was carried aboard the Soviet space 
vessel which returned to earth on 10 
December 1982 after establishing a dura- 
tion record in orbit. It was presented to the 
Director-General of Unesco, Mr. Amadou- 
Mahtar M'Bow, during the ‘’Soviet Days” 
held at Unesco’s Paris headquarters from 
13 to 21 December 1982 to mark the 60th 
anniversary of the formation of the Soviet 
Union, by the First Deputy Minister of 
Culture of the USSR, Mr, Yuri Barabash, the 
permanent delegate of the USSR to 
Unesco, Mr. Yuri Khiltchevsky, and the 
cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaia. Concluding
