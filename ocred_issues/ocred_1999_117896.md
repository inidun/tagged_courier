Johannesburg. Between about six and 
eight o’clock in the evening, employees 
quit their offices in the formerly flouri- 
shing “City of Gold”. Many head for the 
outlying townships. Others drive back to 
the carefully-guarded luxury suburbs 
north of Johannesburg. The commuters’ 
destination depends on the colour of their 
skin. 
The affluent night owls who, in the 
heyday of apartheid, drove downtown in 
the evening to have a drink in the Carlton 
Tower are seldom seen. The city centre

organized crime, prostitution, drug abuse 
and rough justice prevail. 
Those who remain behind in the city 
centre have nowhere to go. They are street 
children or incorrigible adventurers who 
get a kick out of what has been stigmatized 
as the “most dangerous town in the world”. 
All the street children are black boys 
most of whom have run away from poor 
homes to escape abuse of one kind or 
another. On the streets they learn the art 
of survival. This means finding a suitable 
clan and carving out a place for yourself 
in a hierarchy that dictates who wears the 
jersey on cold nights. Even if you are free- 
zing, the worst enemy is not being cold 
but being alone. 
A warm place to go 
They might have spent the day sca- 
venging, begging and stealing. Many sniff 
glue. Official shelters for street children, 
some run by the churches, provide bunks 
and a soup kitchen. On some nights 
Samaritans hand out food. But while 
almost all the children have spent time at 
one of these shelters, they never stay there 
too long. Some of them, once their basic 
needs have been catered for, head off for 
the Thari cinema in Market Street.

VITAL STATISTICS 
hile South Africa (population 41 million, 
We 1.2 million km2) has a per capita 
income ($3,210) which places it among the 
middle-income countries, its income disparities 
are among the most extreme in the world. 
One-third of the population has a “first world” 
standard of living, but over half live in “third 
world” conditions. In the latter group, almost all 
of whose members are black, only half have pri- 
mary education, only one quarter of households 
have access to electricity and running water, and 
one third of the children suffer from chronic mal- 
nutrition. Unemployment levels are among the 
highest in the world. |

Although it is in dire need of renova- 
tion, this movie-house has become a kind 
of haven, a secure, warm place where 
homeless people can find shelter. As well 
as street kids, it attracts other underprivi- 
leged people who have slipped through 
the very loose “net” of the South African 
social security system. 
The proprietor of the cinema has no 
objection to his auditorium being used by 
the waifs as a kind of dormitory. The only 
condition he insists on is that they do not 
consume alcohol or use drugs. Every 
night, between 20 and 30 kids make 
themselves as comfortable as possible on 
the cinema’s threadbare carpet. 
It’s like belonging 
to a big family’ 
One regular guest remarks,“It’s pretty 
hard to get accepted here, but once you 
are it’s like belonging to a big family.” He 
talks about the hard reality of life in the 
million-population city outside. Inside, you 
can find a place among the rows of dilapi- 
dated seats and see second-rate films packed 
with action. Once, when he was spending 
the night outside in the street, somebody 
stole his shoes while he was asleep. T hat is 
just one more reason to pay two rand (50 
cents) for a place to doze between Terminator 
and Air Force One. 
Another regular is 66-year-old Miklos 
Zenasi, who comes in about the same 
time each evening and looks for his favou- 
rite place in the front row. Here he dis- 
creetly settles down for the night. Miklos, 
who 1s known to everyone as “The old 
man”, openly admits that he is no longer 
the wild bull he was once reputed to be. 
He deserted from the Hungarian army, 
fled the communist regime, and by roun - 
dabout routes eventually found his way to 
South Africa. Now, he says, he is too old 
for that kind of excitement.What’s more, 
he adds, pointing to different parts of his 
body, he’s a mass of aches and pains. For 
a while he lapses into silence before final- 
ly revealing that he has spent more nights 
in recent years beneath the screen than 
anywhere else. 
Around six o'clock in the morning, 
when Arnold Schwarzenegger has got 
even with his last enemy, the city outside 
begins to throb with life again. It is time 
for the Thari to expel its children for ano- 
ther day. It may well see them again in the 
evening just as Howard is checking the 
focus of the lens for a further round of 
dreams. u

ysDullaart, a 31-year-old South African pho- 
tographer on the staff of the Johannesburg 
Star newspaper, won the 1999 World Press Photo 
Award (“Daily Life” category), with the picture 
story on Johannesburg street children from which 
photos published in this feature have been selected. 
Dullaart worked as unobtrusively as possible using 
asmall Leica camera. He quotes with approval the 
great French photographer Henri Cartier Bresson 
who once said “Anyone who wants to catch fish 
should not disturb the water.” In other words, if you 
want to take picturesin a cinema, it's a good idea 
not to disturb the performance. 
“Living and working in Johannesburg has 
taught me many things about street children,” he 
says. “Eager to see their response to the Thari 
cinema photos, | arranged for some of the boys fea- 
tured in them to meet me at the annual World Press 
Photo Exhibition. | was amazed when they com- 
mented instead on a story about street children in 
Romania. ‘But they are white, was their initial 
reaction, followed by a discussion which gave me 
the impression that it was themselves they saw in 
those photos from Romania.” TD. m

ALL HUMAN RIGHTS 
FOR ALL 
  
Federico Mayor 
  
As this issue goes to press, 
UNESCO isin process of electing 
a new Director-General. 
In accordance with UNESCO's 
Constitution, UNESCO'S 
Executive Board, comprising 
representatives of 58 Member 
States, recommends a single 
candidate to the UNEso 
General Conference. The 
Conference, in which each of 
UnEesoo’s 187 Member States 
has one vote, isthe 
Organization’s sovereign 
governing body. It will take a 
decision on the Board's 
proposal on November 12, and 
the new Director-General will 
assume his functions a few 
days later. 
Further details about the 
election will appear in the 
next issue of the Courier. 
The end of the millennium has seen some remarkable advances in political demo- 
cracy. Oppressed peoples everywhere are at last, or once again, tasting freedom. 
  
They owe these victories largely to themselves, to the intelligence, determination, 
and even the genius of their citizens. 
But this freedom will be fragile as long as it is cast in a single mold, the vehicle of a 
uniform globalization which speaks with a single voice, primarily that of commerce. 
Principles may be universal; the mechanisms that infuse life into them are shaped by a 
host of features that are specific to each society. 
No vision of democracy—which transcends politics and includes economic, social 
and cultural life—can really take root if it is a sterile copy that fails to take account of 
the history and myths, the values and traditions of each people.While these roots are 
necessary, however, they provide no justification for citing “cultural relativism” as an 
excuse for violating the basic principles on which the rights of human beings are foun- 
ded. Respect for “cultural identity” cannot legitimize anti-democratic practices. 
A second danger arises from the fact that the field in which these rights are elabo- 
rated and exercised is all too often limited. The recent commemoration of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights was a reminder that human rights comprise not only 
political and civil rights but also, on exactly the same basis, economic and social rights, 
such as the right to a job, housing, health and education. 
One and a half billion people live in dire poverty. Their most fundamental right, the 
right to life, the bedrock of all other rights, is constantly threatened. So the still unfini- 
shed struggle to extend and strengthen human rights includes the duty to promote 
development. 
This duty is not only a matter of legal formalism or an ethical imperative. 
Fundamental freedoms will remain very fragile as long as poverty, exclusion and inequa- 
lities persist. The forces of globalization encourage the establishment of the rule of law, 
but a version of law biased in favour of rules needed for successful business activity. They 
also do more to sharpen economic and social tensions rather than to reduce them. 
The momentum created by efforts to establish the rule of law in a growing number 
of countries is coming up against a major obstacle. The principles and rules that govern 
international relations are increasing their influence on the lives of nations, but they are 
very far indeed from being democratic. The strongest still hold sway. 
This is true where individual states are concerned. They feel their wings have been 
clipped, and see their legitimate prerogatives being eroded by the rise of a kind of pri- 
vate-sector absolutism,which tends to limit the functions of government to security and 
mediation,paralyzing its role as the guarantor of the general interest and depriving it of 
the necessary means to apply the rule of law. 
It 1s also true of the community of states because there is still no world structure 
which is accepted as the embodiment of the force of law. The United Nations is a 
unique international democratic forum, but its authority has been weakened first by 
nearly half a century of the Cold War and then by unilateral actions taken by the major 
powers, in defiance of the very principles they profess to defend. 
The rule of law is indivisible; it must encompass freedom and welfare, individual 
countries and the world at large. [|

### 117899: Climatic changes that make the world flip

CLIMATIC CHANGES 
THAT MAKE THEWORLD FLIP 
  
+ Robert Matthews 
Global warming’s impact on the environment is not necessarily a drawn-out affair. Recent 
evidence shows that dramatic changes or ‘climatic flips’ could happen virtually overnight. 
The once-green land of Ireland tur- 
I ned into a frozen wilderness. Harp 
seals swimming among ice-floes off 
the coast of France. Polar bears prowling 
the streets of Amsterdam. These are the 
images conjured up by the latest research 
into global warming. 
Yes, you read that correctly: global war- 
ming—the rise in the world’s average tem- 
perature caused by the trapping of the sun’s 
heat by pollution in the atmosphere. 
If you are baffled by that, then prepare 
to be shocked. For the same research is now 
suggesting that such dramatic changes in 
the climate of northern Europe could take 
place in as few as 10 years. 
Again, this figure is not a misprint: no 
zero has gone missing. Scientists have 
recently uncovered compelling evidence 
that global warming can have a devastating 
impact on timescales far shorter than 
anyone believed possible. Not centuries, 
not even decades, but years, in what are 
being called “climatic flips”. One leading 
expert has recently gone on record to warn 
that some north Atlantic countries could 
find themselves plunged into Arctic condi- 
tions over the space of just 10 years. 
Risk of 
sudden upheaval 
In geological terms,that is as fast as the 
blink of an eye.But even in human terms, 
such a rate of climatic change is incredi- 
bly—and quite probably intolerably— 
rapid. It is far from clear whether any eco- 
nomy or agricultural system could cope 
with such sudden upheaval. 
Yet evidence is now mounting that such 
“climatic flips” not only can happen, but 
have happened in the past. It is evidence 
that adds new urgency to the global war- 
ming debate, which has lost much of its 
momentum in recent years. It also high- 
lights the frightening complexity of the task 
# Science correspondent of the London Sunday 
Telegraph

facing scientists trying to predict the earth’s 
response to human activity. 
Arguments about climatic change typi- 
cally focus on how increasing levels of so- 
called greenhouse gases—principally car- 
bon dioxide from burning fossil fuels—in 
the earth’s atmosphere trap ever more of 
the sun’s heat. 
Huge efforts have been put into predic- 
ting the likely global temperature rise cau- 
sed by the extra greenhouse gases, and cur- 
rent best estimates point to a rise of 1.5 
degrees Celsius or so over the next century. 
But while scientists warn that even so 
apparently small a rise in temperature could 
cause upheaval in everything from agricul- 
tural practices to the spread of disease, the 
rate of change hardly seems terrifying. Surely 
we can cope and have coped with events that 
change over several generations? 
Such arguments are buttressed by ano- 
ther, apparently compelling, argument 
against rapid climate change. The earth’s 
oceans have colossal thermal inertia, and 
would surely iron out any sudden upheaval: 
weight for weight, it takes ten times more 
energy to heat water than it does solid iron. 
Small wonder,then,that scientists were 
unsurprised when they failed to find any 
signs of rapid climatic changes when they 
first studied ancient ocean sediments, the 
isotope levels of which retain a record of 
past temperatures. 
The end of the Ice Age: 
a puzzling discovery 
But this apparently comforting 
confluence of theory and data is now 
known to contain two huge loopholes. The 
first reared its head in the early 1980s, when 
a joint U.S.-European team of scientists 
working in Greenland made a puzzling dis- 
covery. They had extracted an ice-core from 
a site in the southern part of the country, 
By analysing icy sediments (ice-cores) extracted from deep beneath the earth's surface scientists can plot the 
course of climate change thousands of years ago. Below, a sample taken at Lake Annecy (France) in winter.

and had measured isotope levels in the gas 
trapped at different depths in an attempt 
to gauge the temperature in the region over 
thousands of years. 
Because the ice builds up relatively 
rapidly, the ice-core was expected to give 
the researchers the most fine-detailed pic- 
ture yet of temperature changes in the 
region. Plotting out the corresponding tem- 
peratures, the researchers discovered some- 
thing puzzling—and disturbing. 
As expected, the core showed the rise in 
temperature corresponding to the end of 
the last Ice Age around 11,000 years ago. 
But it also showed that the bulk of that 
warm-up had taken place in the space of 
just 40 years. 
At the time, no one knew what to make 
of the result, which flew in the face of eve- 
rything scientists then knew about climate 
change—or thought they knew. In the years 
that followed, however, further ice-cores 
were extracted, and they revealed an even 
more dramatic story: a 5- to 10-degree 
increase in temperature and doubling of 
precipitation over Greenland in the space of 
just 20 years. 
Nothing in the earlier ocean sediment 
core data had prepared scientists for such a 
finding—nor could it. For this was the first 
loophole in the argument against sudden 
climatic flips: the absence of evidence from 
the original ocean sediment cores simply 
reflected the very broad-brush picture they 
gave of temperature change. They lacked 
the detail offered by ice-cores. 
Prompted by the Greenland findings, 
scientists have since tracked down locations 
where ocean sediment builds up fast 
enough to give a record of temperature 
comparable in detail to that from the ice- 
cores. And, sure enough, they reveal the 
same story of rapid climatic change in loca- 
tions as far apart as California and India. 
The history of science shows that fin- 
ding evidence for some astonishing pheno- 
menon is often only part of the story. To

evidence has to be backed up 
by a more comprehensive 
explanation 
comprehensive explanation.And for many 
years the standard explanation for why Ice 
Ages begin and end provided yet more rea- 
sons for thinking all climatic change must 
be slow and graceful. 
That explanation rests on work by a Ser- 
bian scientist named Milutin Milankovitch, 
who in 1920 linked Ice Ages to changes in the 
shape of the earth’s orbit. Caused by the push 
and pull of the other planets, these orbital 
changes altered the concentration of sunlight 
reaching the planet. Such changes would 
naturally take place very gradually, on times- 
cales of many thousands of years—a recipe 
for climatic change that is anything but 
abrupt. 
A global heat 
transporter 
Yet, once again, there is a loophole in 
this comforting argument—as Wallace 
Broecker of Columbia University, New 
York State, realized around the time 
climate experts were puzzling over the 
ice-core data. 
This loophole centres on a very specific 
feature of the earth’s oceans:their circula- 
tion patterns. Ocean currents transport 
heat around the globe like a vast conveyor 
belt. In the Atlantic, for example, warm 
water travels northwards from the Gulf of 
Mexico, passing its heat to the air by eva- 
poration as it goes. This makes the current 
progressively cooler, saltier and denser until 
eventually, near Iceland, the water is so 
heavy that it sinks, and begins a long jour- 
ney southward,along the ocean floor. 
Broecker realized that this complex, 
subtle process—which he called “The 
Conveyor”’—could be the Achilles heel of 
the earth’s climate,allowing subtle changes 
to be turned into dramatic upheaval. For 
instead of having to alter the whole body 
of the oceans, just a small change in tem- 
perature might be enough to alter the beha-

viour of the Conveyor—and trigger radical 
and rapid climatic change over a large area. 
For example, gradually melting ice from 
the Arctic could dilute the saltiness of the 
Conveyor to a critical density where it no 
longer sinks and begins its journey south - 
ward to pick up more heat.The Conveyor 
would, in effect, be switched off, isolating 
the north Atlantic from the warming waters 
of the tropics. The result would then be dis- 
tinctly paradoxical, with a slight warming of 
the Arctic causing temperatures of north 
Atlantic countries to plunge. 
Broecker’s explanation is now widely 
believed to lie at the heart of rapid climate 
change in the past. Worryingly, however, 
global warming is predicted to have preci- 
sely the type of warming effect on the Arc- 
tic ice that threatens the existence of the 
Conveyor. Computer projections of the 
effect of pollution on global temperatures 
predict an inflow of cold, fresh water into 
the northern Atlantic—water that could 
dilute the Conveyor enough to switch it off. 
The Achilles heel 
of the earth’s climate 
If that happened, says Broecker, winter 
temperatures in the north Atlantic region 
would fall by 10 or more degrees Celsius 
within 10 years, giving places like Dublin 
the climate of Spitsbergen, 400 km north of 
the Arctic Circle. “The consequences could 
be devastating,” he says. 
It is a scenario that gains credibility from 
ice-core data, according to climate expert 
Kendrick Taylor of the Desert Research Ins- 
titute in Reno, Nevada. He says that many 
cores suggest that around 8,000 years ago 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
there was a sudden plunge back to a “mini Ice 
Age” which lasted around 400 years. The 
most likely cause, says Taylor, was the release 
of melted ice-water from lakes in Canada into 
the Atlantic, which switched off the heat- 
transporting Conveyor. 
“The change in freshwater flux to the 
oceans was large, but not that much diffe- 
rent from what greenhouse-induced 
changes may produce in the future,” he said 
in arecent paper in American Scientist. “It is 
ironic that greenhouse warming may lead 
to rapid cooling in eastern Northern Ame- 
rica,Europe and Scandinavia.” 
So just how close is the Conveyor to 
switching off once again?T he short answer 
is: no one knows. Computer models have 
still to identify the critical density of sea- 
water at which the Conveyor will switch off, 
or the greenhouse gas concentrations nee- 
ded to release the requisite amount of melt- 
water. 
Cutting pollution 
buys time 
What computer models have shown, 
says Taylor, is that reducing pollution emis- 
sions buys time—both by slowing the rate 
of global warming, and also by driving the 
climate more gently, which seems to 
increase its stability against rapid change. 
But while scientists struggle to capture 
the full complexity of the climate on their 
supercomputers, evidence of other causes 
of dramatic climate change is beginning to 
emerge. 
Last July, Professor Martin Claussen and 
his colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for 
Climate Science, Germany, reported evi- 
dence that today’s Sahara desert was created 
A MUDDY MYSTERY 
he effectsthat scientists now believe can shape 
the earth’s climate are astonishingly subtle, and 
one of the most bizarre centres on the connection 
between Ice Ages, earthquakes, and mud. 
Last year a team from the Southampton Ocea- 
nography Centre in Britain announced in the jour- 
nal Nature the discovery of a 450-billion-cubic- 
metre deposit on the sea-floor off the coast of 
Sardinia—the aftermath of a truly enormous slide of 
mud: enough to engulf the whole of France to a 
depth of a metre. 
Carbon dating of the plankton above and below 
the mud bed suggest that the slide took place 
around 20,000 years ago—at the height of the last 
Ice Age. Thiswas a time when so much water had 
been turned to ice that sea-levelswere 120 metres 
lower than they are today—a fact that the team 
suspects is crucial to the cause of the colossal 
mud-slide. 
Formed out of thousands of years of river depo- 
sits, the mud would have been rich in organic mat- 
ter—material that rots to produce huge amounts 
of methane gas. Normally this gas would have 
been locked into the mud by the huge pressure of 
sea-water lying over the submerged sediments. 
But as the Ice Age deepened and sea-levels fell,   
the mud deposits would find themselves exposed, 
and thus able to release their pent-up methane 
gas. 
This gas is a very potent source of global war- 
ming, and the sudden release of huge amounts of 
it might have helped push the earth back out of 
the Ice Age. 
Certainly the timing of the Sardinian mud- 
slide—at the height of the last Ice Age—is intriguing, 
says team member Professor Euan Nisbet of Lon- 
don’sRoyal Holloway College: “It is possible that a 
big slide could have released enough methane to 
act asawarming trigger.” 
It is an idea that has gained strength from a 
recent discovery by researchers at Duke Univer- 
sity in North Carolina. In a paper also published in 
Nature last year, they argue that the sheer weight 
of ice pressing down on the earth’s crust may have 
triggered huge earthquakes during the Ice Age. 
Could these have triggered massive submarine 
mudslides, releasing methane that led to the end of 
Ice Age? As yet, no one knows. But it points to yet 
another astonishingly subtle link between the envi- 
ronment, climate—and us. u

in a sudden climatic “flip” that took place 
just 5,500 years ago, turning vast areas of 
lush grassland into an arid wilderness and 
devastating ancient civilizations. 
Using a sophisticated computer model 
of the land, sea and atmosphere, the team 
has discovered just how subtle are some of 
the effects that can turn Milankovitch-style 
changes in the earth’s orbit into major cli- 
mate upheaval. 
The Sahara’s quick-change act 
They found that over the last 9,000 
years the gravitational pull of the planets 
has altered the tilt of the earth’s axis by 
about halfa degree, and changed the timing 
of earth’s closest approach to the sun by 
around five months. 
By themselves, such subtle changes 
should not cause major climatic effects. 


### 117899: Climatic changes that make the world flip

‘The change in freshwater 
flux to the oceans was large, 
but not that much different 
from what greenhouse-induced 
changes may produce 
in the future. It is ironic that 
greenhouse warming may lead 
to rapid cooling in eastern 
Northern America, Europe and 
Scandinavia’ 
 
But when Claussen and his colleagues 
included the effect of vegetation in their 
computer model, they found that it cau- 
sed rainfall levels to plummet over the 
Sahara region. 
They traced the cause to “feedback” 
effects,in which a slight drop in vegetation 
level makes the earth’s surface slightly bet- 
ter at reflecting sunlight, which causes rain- 
fall levels to drop—prompting more vege- 
tation loss,and so on. 
According to Claussen, these feedback 
effects turned the vast, once-green Sahara 
into a brown wasteland within just 300 years. 
“It was the largest change in land cover 
during the last 6,000 years,” he says. “It was 
very severe, ruining ancient civilizations.” 
The discovery is likely to force histo- 
rians to rethink their explanations of events 
in the region. For according to Claussen, it 
contradicts the long-held belief that the col- 
lapse of agriculture in the region was cau- 
sed by ancient farmers exhausting the soil: 
“Although humans lived in the Sahara and 
used the land to some extent, we think that 
ancient land use played only a negligibly 
small role.”

The findings are also being seen as ano- 
ther warning of just how unstable even 
today’s climate may be. “It is capable of 
changing very abruptly,” says climate 
expert Andrew Goudie of Oxford Univer- 
sity. “We've known that the extent of the 
Sahara has yo-yoed back and forwards for 
millions of years, and that about 8,000 
years ago it was much wetter than today, 
with big rivers feeding into the Nile. But I 
hadn’t realized just how rapid the chan- 
geover had been.It is salutary.” 
Temperature 
nose-dives 
Also in July, a team of researchers from 
the universities of Illinois and Minnesota 
reported the discovery of another climatic 
“flip” in the northern hemisphere around 
9,000 years ago, which temporarily plunged 
the region back into an Ice Age. 
Using lake sediments from Minnesota, 
the team confirmed the existence of the 
cold snap around 8,200 years ago, as revea- 
led by the ice core data. But they also found 
evidence for another dive in temperatures 
around 8,300 to 8,900 years ago. T he team 
thinks this older cold snap was linked to 
the release of melted ice from lakes into the 
Atlantic—which may have switched off the 
Conveyor. But the researchers now think 
that the more recent flip most likely had 
another—and as yet unknown—origin. 
What is clear is that until we know 
much more about the complexity of climate 
change, all bets about how much time we 
have to take action are definitely off. What 
evidence we do have increasingly points to 
the stark possibility that we may have far 
less time than we thought. 
“I used to believe that change in climate 
happened slowly and would never affect 
me,” admits Taylor. “Now I know that our 
climate could change significantly in my 
lifetime.” [|

### 117900: When the press plugs the schoolbook gap

WHEN THE PRESS PLUGS 
THE SCHOOLBOOK GAP 
  
+ Asbel Lopez and Lucia Iglesias Kuntz 
Educational supplements for young readers are flourishing 
in the Latin American press 
A few weeks ago, several children 
wrote to the editors of Zurqui, the 
educational supplement of the Costa 
Rican daily newspaper La Nacion. They 
complained that their parents wouldn’t 
let them cut out and paste figures from 
the paper as the instructions indicated. 
Defending themselves, the parents argued 
they did not want to spoil their precious 
family collections of Zurqui issues. In the 
following week’s supplement, the editors 
came up with a suggestion: photocopy the 
figures, so that children could cut them 
out and parents could keep their newspa- 
per intact. 
This is just one sign of the growing 
interest generated by the educational sup- 
plements published by many Latin 
American papers. A distressed 11-year- 
old schoolgirl in Bogotd, the capital of 
Colombia, phoned the country’s largest 
daily, El Tiempo, to beg for a back issue 
because she had lost her own copy. What 
she really wanted was Mi Tiempo, an edu- 
cational supplement the paper distributes 
free to pupils at 80 public and private 
schools in the city. “The girl was upset 
because she lost the paper before she’d 
finished doing all the activities in it,” says 
Ofelia Corradine, the managing editor of 
the monthly, which prints 31,000 copies. 
For most of the school pupils in 
Bogotd’s poorest neighbourhoods—30 
per cent of which are taking part in the 
project—M i Tiempo 1s not only the closest 
to a schoolbook that pupils have ever 
come across but also something they can 
take home to colour, draw in, and write 
down what they think. One of the issues 
in the first half of 1999, for example, ran 
articles about tolerance and getting along 
with others, with plenty of space where 
the children could express their opinions. 
“Each child gets a copy, so they deve- 
lop a close personal relationship with the 
supplement,” says Corradine. These

children who have mostly never owned 
schoolbooks or at best have had to learn 
from borrowed ones, acquire a sense of 
ownership which is an important aspect 
of the media’s current educational 
projects. 
Aralynn McMane, director of the 
World Association of Newspapers (WAN), 
a Paris-based body which awards an 
annual World Young Reader Prize (see box 
page 16), says “in recent years we have

mentor with something useful 
and relevant to say.’ 
smarter. They sound less like grown-ups 
lecturing or pandering to children and 
more like a trusted friend or mentor with 
something useful and relevant to say.” 
George Kelly, one of the founders of 
the WAN and adviser on educational pro- 
jects to several Latin American newspa- 
pers, says the best supplements are pro- 
duced in Brazil and Argentina. Folha and 
O Estado, two major dailies in Sdo Paulo, 
Brazil’s economic capital, put out two 
children’s weeklies, Folhinha and 
Estadinho. Brazilian journalist Marcelo 
Soares thinks they are valuable because 
they carry articles which interest children 
“without treating them like slaves of 
Xuxa,” a famous Brazilian former model 
who presents children’s programmes on 
television. These supplements also try to 
explain in simple terms current events 
like the war in Kosovo or the recent 
Turkish earthquake. Estadinho also carries 
regular columns on language and science. 
‘A fun way to read’ 
Other smaller papers are hot on their 
heels. In the Argentine city of Bahia 
Blanca, La Nueva Provincia sends a fort- 
nightly supplement called El Diario de los 
Chicos to 3,000 subscribers aged between 
5 and 14. One of its writers, known as 
“Santiago”, is a 12-year-old film critic 
with a collection of 700 film reviews from 
newspapers all over the world. In the city 
of Paysandu, Uruguay’s most widely read 
provincial paper, El Telégrafo, publishes 
Gurises (which comes from a Guarani 
Indian word meaning “children”), an 
eight-page tabloid whose motto is “A fun 
way to read”. Ever Thursday, the day it 
appears, ‘“there’s plenty of fun in 
Paysandi’s schools,” says Enrique 
Sénchez, a journalist on El Telégrafo. 
Gurises publishes material for class- 
room use and gives news about school 
events, competitions and other children’s 
activities. It also provides an outlet for 
imaginative work by printing unpublished 
stories and, with backing from the World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF), tries to get across 
to its readers the importance of protec- 
ting nature,with a section of photographs 
on environmental issues. In 1996, the 
government of this northeastern 
Uruguayan province declared Gurises to 
be “of value” to the province because it 
encouraged children to read. 
The newspapers are usually not just 
concerned with attracting young readers, 
but also with getting their parents into the 
habit of reading the paper every day. 
Latin American newspapers depend more 
heavily for survival on news-stand sales 
than on income from advertising. T his is 
because most Latin American countries 
do not have independent bodies to verify

circulation: advertising agencies have to 
make do with circulation figures provided 
by the newspapers themselves. This 
creates lack of confidence and limits 
advertising sales. 
The result is a flurry of promotional 
activities to boost circulation, with initia- 
tives such as subscribers’ clubs—started 
by El Tiempo in Bogota—and competi- 
tions with flashy prizes and gifts of 
atlases, encyclopaedias, health booklets, 
football posters, CDs and cookbooks. 
Education sells papers 
Education has become a weapon in the 
battle for new readers. The day Zurqui 
comes out in Costa Rica, sales of its parent 
paper, La Nacion, go up by 25 per cent. On 
Tuesdays in Paraguay, when ABC Escolar 
hits the streets, the circulation of ABC, one 
of the country’s main papers, rises between 
20 and 40 per cent without any other pro- 
motion, says Natalia Laporta, the supple- 
ment’s editor. Last July and August, 
Aprendo, the children’s supplement of La 
Prensa de Panama had a pull-out section of 
historical photos of the Panama Canal, 
which will return to Panamanian owner- 
ship this December. “When we printed the 
cut-out features on Sundays, sales of the 
main paper went up by 17 per cent, a 
record for us,” says Wendy Tribaldos, who 
is in charge of the supplement. 
The supplements can increase the 
circulation of their parent papers largely 
because education continues to be regar- 
ded in Latin America as a means of social 
advancement.! But they also have defini- 
te advantages over other teaching 
methods and resources. 
One is their considerable capacity to 
relate knowledge to the present. Producing

a schoolbook, from the moment someone 
thinks of writing it until the time it lands on 
a pupil’s desk, takes at least two years. In 
countries with few resources to update their 
school primers regularly, this period can be 
much longer. But newspapers record 
events which happened only a few days ago. 
Kelly remembers a Latin American 
geography supplement which showed the

Development Programme (UNDP), 23 per cent

and the Caribbean do not reach the fifth year. 
most recent political changes around the 
world. “If you went to a school, the atlas in 
the library would still probably show the 
Soviet Union as a single country,” he says. 
Some of the supplements follow the sylla- 
bus prescribed by their country’s educa- 
tion ministry. Zurqui’s editor, Patricia 
Brenes, says “the fact that the supplement 
is connected with Costa Rica’s official syl- 
labus is an additional attraction. That’s 
why it’s used so much by parents and espe- 
cially teachers.” 
Following such programmes involves 
tackling the same subjects every year, but 
the editors try to vary their approach each 
time around. To teach about resistance to 
the invasion of Nicaragua by the U.S. fili- 
buster William Walker in 1856, Zurqui 
used a play and included a script and ins- 
tructions about how to make costumes. 
The following year, it printed cut-outs to 
put in a history corner in the classroom. 
Later the children were encouraged to 
produce a newspaper which featured the 
main historical events and a description 
of daily life in those days. 
Low-cost reading 
The great advantage of the supple- 
ments is that they are much cheaper than 
schoolbooks and books in general. The 
edition of La Naciéon which contains 
Zurqui costs only $0.39, while school text-

ReadRight, which in the last 8 months has printed 
12 stories which can be pulled out and saved. Lisa 
Blakeway, editorial director of the project, which 
was launched in January 1999, says these illus- 
trated stories have been the supplement’s most 
popular feature. 
ReadRight has a print run of 485,000 copies 
which are inserted into the Sunday Times, as

out free in 900 rural and township schools, most

The supplement is aimed at teachers, parents 
and pupils and can include reading and com- 
prehension exercises, mapwork, life-skills acti- 
vities, essay competitions, book reviews by chil- 
dren, stories to discuss in class and a course 
about how the government is organized. 
The Sunday Times'scommitment to education 
goes back further than ReadRight. The South 
African government's inability to supply school- 
children with textbooks they need to follow the 
country’s new educational curriculum inspired the 
paper to publish all the coursesin it over a 6-week 
period. ReadRight, which is an extension of this 
initiative, boosted the parent paper’s circulation 
by 7 per cent. Now, there are plans to set up 
quarterly workshops for teachers.

Costa Rican children’s supplement Zurqui uses catchy illustrations and simple language to explain 
the basics of plant photosynthesis to its readers (left). 
At right, the Argentine supplement E Diario de los Chicos hails peace in Northern Ireland, commenting 
that “when people or peoples accept the ideas of others, peace is possible.” 
on new teaching methods.” This meant, 
he said, that the supplement was “an 
extremely valuable reference tool for both 
pupils and teachers.” 
The teachers and children recognize 
the value of the supplements. Maria 
Virginia Lépez Jorddn, a secondary 
school teacher in Jujuy (Argentina), says 
“they've provided me with up-to-date 
material which you can’t get in school 
textbooks. I've worked with teachers in 
other subjects like history, geography, 
ethics and civics. The pupils can weigh up 
the various sources, which stimulates dis- 
cussion and helps them form opinions.” 
Other advantages the teachers usually 
mention are the interest the supplements 
generate in the classroom, the valuable 
extra source of information they provide 
and the way they illustrate abstract ideas 
with concrete examples. 
Learning without tears 
Despite all this, the supplements are 
sometimes criticized for being over-aca- 
demic. The press ought to be encouraging 
interesting and enjoyable extra-curricular 
activities, but instead it is becoming a 
kind of school in itself. 
Kelly says that despite attractive desi- 
gn and bright colours, the content is 
sometimes too serious, especially in 
Colombia and Argentina. Supplements 
try to talk in an adult way about complex 
political and social topics. “A British child 
would quickly switch off,” he says. Still, 
he underlines that one of the best ways to 
judge the quality of the supplements is to 
see how schools make use of them. “If 
they do—and this is happening—it means 
the supplements must be providing some- 
thing that the country needs.” 
Kelly thinks the press projects in 
schools should first of all entertain chil- 
dren and encourage them to express 
themselves. “There is nothing which 
assures that being serious will make 
people learn better. The opposite tends to

cross the world, wherever 
A sir regimes have been 
toppled and free market economic 
systems have been introduced, the 
establishment of the “rule of law” has 
vaulted to the top of the agenda. Good 
laws effectively applied respond to a 
growing aspiration for the full exercise of 
human rights to be guaranteed. Legal 
reform is also part and parcel of the 
process of integration into globalized 
markets. This process is bound to be a 
long one. 
In the former Eastern bloc, attempts to 
simply import laws from the West have 
largely failed (pp. 19-20). The heritage of 
the recent and remote past is a heavy 
burden, as a former Ukraine Justice 
Minister (pp. 24-25) describes from fi rst- 
hand experience. But, as recent changes in 
Kyrgyzstan suggest (pp. 21-23), it is not 
necessarily an insuperable obstacle. 
Tradition also cuts different ways in 
Third World countries where disregard of 
customary law may create new forms of 
injustice (pp. 28-30). Post-apartheid South 
Africa is trying to find a new role for 
customary law (pp. 33-34). Benin, via the 
independence of its new constitutional 
court, is reviving its tradition as “a 
pioneer of democracy”. A report (pp. 34- 
35) citing examples in the fields of labour 
and business law shows how Chinese 
citizens are increasingly turning to the 
courts to find redress for grievances. The 
legal omnipotence of the political 
authorities is being eroded. 
But in a world where legal systems are 
so different (pp. 26-27), lack of resources 
means that the transition process is going 
to be an uphill job. This “enforcement 
gap” helps to explain why there are 
winners and losers in the globalization of 
the rule of law.

in transition 
 
+ Yash Ghai and John Kohut 
In a number of countries emerging from authoritarian rule, a new quest for the rule of law is 
being encouraged by popular pressure and globalization 
Nobody has a more 
sacred obligation 
to obey the law 
than those who make 
the law.

n the steppes of Central Asia in countries 
0: so long ago under Stalinist rule, youths 
are being taught something unimaginable a 
decade ago: to defend their legal rights in the 
event of being stopped by police. After 17 years of 
dictatorship, Benin has a new constitutional court 
to which even the humblest citizen can appeal. 
Almost one third of its decisions so far have 
concerned human rights violations. 
The passion for the principle,if not always the 
practice, of the rule of law is not coincidental. 
Much of the world has changed radically in 
recent years, moving from one-party authorita- 
rian rule and command economics to multi-party 
politics or to free markets,and often both.Rule of 
law—a system in which,in theory and in practice, 
the law is binding on all persons as well as the 
government, a system which treats all equally—is 
seen as instrumental to the success of such trans- 
formation. 
The present wave of transition started 20 
years ago in Latin America with the dismantling 
of military rule and the establishment of demo- 
cracy. This was followed by the collapse of com- 
If there is consensus 
on the need for a rule of law, 
the dynamics involved 
in success or failure in getting 
to such a goal are varied 
munist regimes in the Soviet bloc, and the shift 
towards more democratic political systems and 
free market-oriented reform. Meanwhile, a num- 
ber of states and territories in Africa and Asia, as 
a result of mass movements (Benin, Indonesia) or 
political evolution (Taiwan), are changing autho- 
ritarian or dictatorial regimes to more participa- 
tory and accountable systems. 
Momentum for legal reform has come from 
growing popular pressure at national level, as well 
as from globalization,the catch-word not only for 
increasing trade and economic integration, but 
also for standards of civil conduct affecting ordi- 
nary people’s basic rights. Membership in econo- 
mic and political groupings and federations often 
brings international pressure for countries to pro- 
tect basic rights through a rule of law. 
While a set of laws in itself doesn’t guarantee 
individuals rights—Nazi Germany and Stalinist 
Soviet Union had legal codes—a legal system 
equitably and tenaciously implemented is a cor- 
nerstone of democracy. “I can’t conceive of 
democracy without a rule of law,” says Meir 
Leker, Secretary General of the International 
Association of Legal Science. 
The force of tradition 
If there is consensus on the need for a rule of 
law, the dynamics involved in success or failure in 
getting to such a goal are varied. First of all there 
1s tradition. For instance, one legal scholar traces 
the absence of the rule of law in Russia back to 
the influence of Russian Orthodoxy on the legal 
consciousness and a tradition of absolutism unin- 
terrupted for nearly half a millennium. On the 
other hand, a strong traditional sense of freedom 
can give impetus to the establishment of the rule 
of law after a period of dictatorship. Secondly, 
socio-economic factors play a part: in free mar- 
kets, workers, business owners and investors all 
demand protection. Then there is the Weberian 
analysis that as political leaderships move away 
from charismatic legitimacy based on great 
deeds—such as leading a revolution—they seek 
legitimacy elsewhere, including in effective 
government through the law. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, USAID (the U.S. 
Agency for International Development) and the 
Ford Foundation sponsored law reform pro- 
grammes in the South directed more at economic 
and social development than political development. 
By and large they failed. Governments which pas- 
sed the laws had little commitment to them. 
Sufficient resources were seldom provided for the 
implementation of the laws. Most projects overesti- 
mated the capacity of states to absorb new policies 
and institutions; for example there were not 
enough, or not enough well trained, lawyers,jud ges, 
administrators, who understood or were able to 
operate the new laws. Most projects underestimated 
the persistence of custom and customary practices. 
Many similar issues arise in current efforts to 
build a rule of law. Here we assess the dynamics 
at play in those attempts. u

### 117902: No quick fix

No quick fix 
 
+ Stephen Holmes 
Foreigners have swamped the former Soviet bloc with legal advice, 
but the results have fallen far short of expectations 
ver the past half-dozen years, a flock of 
0 development agencies and private 
foundations have organized a multimillion- 
dollar effort to promote “the rule of law” in the for- 
mer Soviet bloc. Aimed at fostering stability in the 
region, these multilateral and bilateral efforts,often 
overlapping, were not entirely eleemosynary. While 
political stability would reduce the security burden 
on the West,economic stability would presumably 
provide a new market for Western goods and a 
favourable business climate for Western investment. 
  
Embedded in these legal assistance programmes 
are a handful of basic assumptions, the most impor- 
tant of which is that the free market is created, sus- 
tained, and constantly re-attuned by legislative and 
adjudicative decisions that must be reliably enfor- 
ced.Essentially, law is seen as a springboard to eco- 
nomic development. In line with this idea, the lion’s 
share of foreign aid for legal reform in Eastern 
Europe and Russia has been devoted to improving 
the security of acquisitions and transactions. 
But considerable resources have also been 
aimed at promoting, for instance, voting rights and 
due-process rights for criminal suspects. Unfortu- 
nately, in these areas too, more attention has been 
paid to on-paper legislative advances than to solving 
pervasive problems of compliance and implemen- 
tation. Strictly on-paper reform efforts flowed natu- 
rally from the weakness of enforcement capacities in 
Eastern Europe after 1989 and Russia after 1991, 
and to some extent from a long tradition of legal 
regulations which appeared “on the books” but 
were not followed or enforced in practice. 
What have we learned from these imperfect 
efforts? 
Lesson one: 
the magnitude of the problem 
The first steps of legal reform, such as the draf- 
ting and ratification of a bill of rights,may be rela- 
tively easy. But subsequent steps,such as creating 
an honest civil service,are much harder. 
Improving the quality of public institutions 
requires a broad and deep social consensus and 
capacity for co-operation. Law is a public good, 
and politically disorganized societies, by definition, 
have a hard time creating public goods. The unde- 
renforcement of basic rights in,say, Russia is often 
a product of fiscal insolvency. The miserably low 
salaries and benefits of Russian judges, which have 
engendered a crisis of understaffing and low-quality 
personnel, constitute a major obstacle to the deli- 
very of justice in the Russian Federation. 
One must thus recognize that legal reform is a 
branch of state-building. Legal development pro- 
jects have scored only modest successes in the 
region because, among other reasons, the post- 
communist state remains incapable of repressing 
force and fraud. 
But the post-communist state must not only 
become stronger; it must simultaneously become 
more accountable. Accountable government, in 
turn, presupposes a society well-organized enough 
to discipline office-holders.

| Human-rights projects in the region have ten- 
ded to channel resources toward private actors in 
civil society and to neglect government as a partner. 
Commercial-law projects, by contrast, have chan- 
neled resources, including Western expertise, to 
governmental agencies, neglecting “civil society” 
or private-sector actors as potential partners. The 
first lesson of a half-decade of abortive or stalled 
legal reform is therefore the need to compensate 
for these symmetrical shortcomings. Legal deve- 
lopment projects must aim at increasing the res- 
ponsiveness of government to social interests and 
opinions. 
Lesson two: 
the illusions of reform 
by decree 
The rule of law implies that the legislature 
wields serious powers and bears serious responsi- 
bilities. It is therefore next to impossible to conduct 
a successful legal reform programme without a 
reform majority in the lawmaking body. If the legis- 
lature and the executive branches are unable to co- 
operate, as they are in Russia,many of the laws in 
force will be anti-reform or, at the very least, incom- 
petently or shoddily drafted. 
The designers of foreign technical assistance 
programmes should not, therefore, overestimate 
the effectiveness of rule of decree, that is, by one- 
sided executive-branch decisions, that do not repre- 
sent a wide social consensus and have not been 
hammered out in a process of consultation with 
social forces outside a small clique in the Kremlin. 
Foreign-funded projects should target technical 
assistance to areas of legal reform where executive- 
legislative co-operation is possible. 
Lesson three: 
the inadequacy 
of mirror-imaging 
Much of Western legal-development aid has 
aimed at replicating Western institutions abroad. 
In the early 1990s, especially, Western-trained legal- 
development professionals often strove to trans- 
form the legal systems of Eastern Europe and Rus- 
sia to make them resemble the legal systems they 
knew at home. But law is not a kitchen appliance 
that we can unplug in the United States or Ger- 
many and simply plug in again in Bucharest or 
Sofia. Recipient input in (even a veto over) model 
selection and import is essential. 
Lesson four: 
lack of trained development 
professionals 
Lawyers are trained to solve routine problems 
within routine procedures. They are not trained to 
reflect creatively on the emergence and stabiliza- 
tion of the complex institutions which lawyering 
silently presupposes. Ordinary legal training, the- 
refore, is not adequate to the extraordinary pro- 
blems faced by the manager of a legal development 
project in Eastern Europe or Russia.Legal reform 
a9 
& 8 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
cannot succeed without attention to social context, 
local infrastructure, professional skills, logistic 
capacities,and political support. 
The much-lamented lack of donor co-ordina- 
tion is rooted in the weak theoretical framework 
underlying the foreign funding of legal reform. T he 
European Union and the U.S. should jointly create 
and fund a “Legal Reform Strategies Centre” to 
provide a “driver’s manual” for legal reform ,based 
on empirical studies. 
Lesson five: 
project selection, 
governmental support 
For the sake of sustainability, project selection 
must give greater weight to recipient interest and 
commitment than to donor interest and commit- 
ment.Law is an aspect of sovereignty. As a conse- 
quence,many foreign-funded rule-of-law projects 
will inevitably operate under joint supervision of 
the foreign donor and the local government. T his 
doubling of oversight and reporting requirements 
may in some cases paralyze the operation of the 
programme or destroy its coherence. This is rea- 
son enough for development agencies to continue 
to work as closely as possible with “clients” or part- 
ners within the government. T hat necessity, howe- 
ver,imposes certain limits on project selection. 
The “rule of law” slogan, remember, is redo- 
lent of the Cold War, when it was used to express 
the West’s sense of moral superiority over the Soviet 
bloc. Today, it is essential that Western-financed law 
programmes avoid all appearance of triumphalism 
or imperialism. Since anti-piracy laws aim at 
making Russians pay more for Western videos, 
CDs, and software, over-emphasis on such laws can 
leave the impression that the West 1s seeking “tri- 
bute” after its “victory”’in the Cold War. 
Lesson six: 
project selection: social support 
Given the limited resources at the disposal of 
foreign legal assistance programmes, it makes sense 
to choose projects strategically. Projects with some 
potential for producing interim successes—and the- 
refore able to sustain donor interest and commit- 
ment—should be favoured over projects that will 
have no visible benefits for 20 or 50 years. 
In general, foreign support should be given to 
law reform efforts which combine top-down and 
bottom-up features, working both with the regula- 
tors and the regulated.Stated differently, the crea- 
tion of a functioning rule-of-law system depends 
on negotiated rule-making. Foreign-funded legal 
development projects should aim at strengthening 
consultative and co-operative relations between 
state and society. T he relative strength of such rela- 
tions in Poland and Hungary helps explain the 
modest but important advances they have achie- 
ved in the area of legal reform. It is the weakness of 
state-society relations elsewhere in the former 
Soviet bloc that explains the weakness of the rule of 
law in many post-communist states today. u 
It is better to do 
your own duty, however 
imperfectly, than to 
assume 
the duties of another 
person, however 
successfully.

### 117903: Kyrgyzstan: breaking out of the old shell

Kyrgyzstan: breaking out 
of the old shell 
  
* Cynthia Guttman 
In Kyrgyzstan, widely regarded as the most democratic country in Central Asia, legal reform 
is running up against old attitudes and dire economic conditions 
  
y 
 
Fourth year law students at Kyrgyz National State University:enroliment in this field has surged 
over the past decade, but students complain about the lack of recent reading materials. 
  
* UNesco Courier journalist 
staff member slips a CD-Rom into a compu- 
ter,calls up all the legislation passed in Kyr- 
gyzstan since last August and scrolls down several 
screens of amendments and laws. Such readily avai- 
lable information and technology are rare in this 
cash-strapped nation of 4.7 million inhabitants that 
has built its reputation since independence in 1991 
on the boldness of its democratic reforms, to such 
an extent that it can be hard for the judicial profes- 
sion to keep up. 
In a district court of the capital, there are no 
such modern installations. The walls here are in 
dire need of repainting, a bare lightbulb hangs over 
an uncluttered desk staffed by two clerks, a manual 
typewriter sits atop a large locker, and a hard bench 
is propped in a corridor leading to the judge’s office. 
Inside, there is no sign of being in a state body—no 
official portrait, no flag, no emblem or uniformed 
officials. 
The case underway involves a private bank,the 
national securities commission and a newspaper, 
none of which has a lawyer. The bank is suing the 
securities commission for defamation after the lat- 
ter accused it of providing false information and 
publicized the affair in the press. Into the fifth 
A t the Judicial Training Centre in Bishkek, a 
hearing, the case, one of the more complex ones 
heard by this judge, exemplifies an all too common 
problem.“The main difficulty is applying the new 
laws,” she says. “Sometimes there are many contra- 
dictions within the law, which makes our task very 
difficult, especially given the number of new laws 
adopted in the last two years.” 
Her struggle echoes that of many of the coun- 
try’s 300-odd judges trying to come to grips with 
new laws and codes (including a civil, tax code and 
criminal code) governing entirely novel fields of 
expertise: leasing and selling buildings, franchising, 
property rights,private business,bankruptcy, ban- 
king, customs and organized crime. And there is 
more to come:the family code is being revised and 
the final touches have just been put on a new elec- 
toral code, which will be put to the test this fall. 
This intense activity is a far cry from the days when 
new laws were passed down from Moscow and the 
judicial system was under the helm of the commu- 
nist party. Now judges and lawyers are not only 
expected to understand the new legislation along 
with international instruments, but to help conceive 
new laws and amend former ones. 
Economic integration 
Since independence, Kyrgyzstan has often hai- 
led itself as “the Switzerland of Central Asia”—a 
multiethnic country that has gone further than any 
of its neighbours in constructing an open society. 
Surrounded by gas-rich Uzbekistan and oil-rich 
Kazakhstan, not to mention China—some argue 
that the resource-poor country had no other option 
than to invest in democratic reforms as a way to 
attract international attention and integrate into 
the world market. Along with efforts to fight cor- 
ruption, make the state administration more effi- 
cient and institutions more credible, President 
Asker Akaev has repeatedly stressed the importance 
of strengthening economic integration. Last 
November, Kyrgyzstan became the first country in 
the region to join the World Trade Organization. 
“This is all out of our own domestic national 
interests,” says Ednan Karabaev of the Kyrgyz-Rus- 
sian Slavic University. “We started by reforming the 
state, while Uzbekistan began with the economic 
structure. In our case, the previous governing struc- 
ture would not have allowed the reforms to succeed, 
whereas in Uzbekistan, there would have been a »

social explosion had it started off by changing the 
political structure.” Although recognizing that they 
have little tradition of self-governance, the Kyrgyz 
are fond of claiming that democratic principles are 
deeply embedded in their nomadic traditions. Law 
professor Galina Mukambaeva is delving into 
M anas, the revered national epic, in an attempt to 
prove that her nation of nomadic tribes had its own 
structure and ideology over 2,000 years ago. In the 
capital, a fiery equestrian statue of the legend’s hero 
1s just as present as a giant one of Lenin, which stands 
next to the shrine where the Kyrgyz flag is guarded, 
a proud symbol of newfound nationhood. 
A hybrid system 
The turning point in this democratization pro- 
cess came in May 1993, when Kyrgyzstan adopted 
a new constitution that established a secular demo- 
cratic society “based on the fundamentals of rule of 
law”. The country counts a fledgling opposition 
press (see box), legalized trade unions (albeit weak), 
some 20 political parties, and over 1,000 non- 
governmental organizations. It recently became the 
first country in the former Soviet Union to autho- 
rize private land ownership. Most observers would 
agree that the country has a solid legal framework 
but the context remains very fragile for putting it 
into practice. Extreme poverty is on the rise,private 
business lacks the wherewithal to kickstart the eco- 
nomy, and many, especially in rural areas, long for 
the times when the state provided a cushioned secu- 
rity. In the south, a hostage crisis and border war are 
dragging on. They have already claimed over a 
dozen lives and displaced several thousand people. 
The separation of three branches of power is 
one of the cornerstones of the Constitution,which 
represents a radical break from the omnipotence 
of the state. “There were situations at the begin- 
ning of independence when the government tried to 
use the judges and courts,” says Mr Tylebaliev, 
2 2 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
chairman of the Supreme Court.“But now things 
have changed, and the court system is indepen- 
dent.” Not everyone would agree that such a long 
road has been travelled ,however,starting with the 
judges themselves. Seventy per cent of them prac- 
ticed during the Soviet period. Now they have to 
learn to function in a hybrid system mingling ele- 
ments from the European and Anglo-American 
models, with many laws from Soviet times still pre- 
vailing in amended form. 
“We're moving from an inquisitorial model to 
an adversarial model. Under the previous system, 
the prosecutors would bring the case, the judges 
were very passive,” explains Lamar Cravens,of the 
American Bar Association’s Central and East Euro- 
pean Law Initiative.“Without a habit of initiative, 
it’s very hard to enforce the new procedural rules.” 
Lawyers are also faced with the task of sharpening 
their advocacy skills and understanding all the 
defence mechanisms available to them in protecting 
their clients. Natalia Ablova, director of the Bureau 
on Human Rights and Rule of Law, regrets that all 
too many lawyers fail to apply international human 
rights instruments in arguing their cases. 
Herding sheep 
to make ends meet 
But even with the strongest commitment, 
judges can seldom devote themselves heart and 
mind to their task. “Salary is one of the most impor- 
tant elements necessary for judges to keep their 
independence. I know of judges who keep sheep 
and cattle to survive,” says Anarkul Toksobaeva, 
A new sense of responsibility 
T° is no more poignant illustration of extreme poverty in Kyrgyzstan than the sight of elderly 
women erring the streets, hawking a few newspapers that passersby might not have picked up 
at one of the city's kiosks. Freedom of expression is a constitutional right and was further bolstered 
by a referendum in 1998 forbidding the adoption of laws limiting press freedom. A fledgling oppo- 
sition press exists, and yet, over the years, it has lived through a steady tug of war with government. 
An emblematic figure of the opposition press is Zamira Sydykova, editor-in-chief of Res Publica, vie- 
wed by many as the veteran opposition newspaper. Sydykova spent two and a half months in pri- 
son over a series criticizing the chairman of the Kyrgyz gold mining company. Another journalist spent 
four months in prison over an article on the appalling conditions of workers living in factory dormi- 
tories. Last year, an edition of the paper wasbanned in a region w here a toxic spill by a foreign com- 
pany occurred. Sydykova puts her problems down to money and the high risk involved in criticizing 
sacred cows: “ Such cases come up every time you touch someone in a high position, and the state 
isalways the winner.” More recently, the editor of the opposition daily Vechernii Bishkek ran into pro- 
blems with law enforcement, allegedly over tax issues Talgat Asyrankulov, president of Independent 
Bishkek TV, one of four independent channels, believes he has avoided problems by sticking to firm 
principles: “ we broadcast information that has been checked three times and presents several dif- 
ferent viewpoints. We show no violence, no drugs and make no political declarations” The OSCE 
monitors press freedom and triesto serve asa clearing house for complaints, but JerzyWieclaw urges 
caution in the matter. “ Newspapers sometimes run into problems because they don’t check their 
information. There should be an element of responsibility, and this is still something new here.” m

Checking the headlines at a kiosk in Bishkek,the capital.The country boasts a small 
opposition press and several independent television channels 
director of the Judicial Training Centre, which orga- 
nizes seminars for judges on analysing new legisla- 
tion. A judge earns approximately $40 per month— 
more than a teacher ($15 to $20 a month) or a 
government clerk ($10 a month) but far short of the 
minimum required to survive. Such a context can 
undermine the ideal of judicial independence. “If 
you don’t come under pressure from a member of 
parliament, you come under the pressure of the 
shadow economy,” notes Toksobaeva. 
The selection process is also a point of debate: 
judges are appointed for a set term by the presi- 
dent upon the recommendation of an attestation 
committee, a process that parliament is seeking to

the major problem of this country:to have elected

cement agencies are judged weak and often unk- 
nowledgeable about their own law and internatio- 
nal obligations. “People’s rights are frequently vio- 
lated, whether by a state body or another person, 
but they have no custom of turning to the courts,” 
says Mirgul Smanalieva, head of the Attorneys 
Association of Kyrgyzstan.“One of our goals is to 
organize T V programmes to explain to people how 
they should behave and who they should turn to 
when their rights are violated.If each citizen knew 
their rights and could fight for them, maybe our 
system would work more effectively.” 
Such an investment in civil society is considered 
one of the keys to entrenching rule of law. “It’s a little 
better than before but people still don’t know their 
rights, they don’t know what the constitution means, 
how their taxes are spent or how to lobby for their 
interests,” says Asiya Sasykbaeva, head of the Inter- 
belim center, an umbrella organization providing ser- 
vices to improve NGO capacity. T he Soros foundation 
is earmarking 8 per cent of its budget towards law 
programmes (against 2.5 per cent at present) to sup- 
port law and human rights projects, open up legal aid 
centres and improve the competence of administrative 
officials in the regions. Schools are also a target. “The 
goal is to make every student feel they are a citizen of 
this country and to understand they have human 
rights,” says Atyrkul Alisheva of the Institute for Regio- 
nal Studies, explaining the aim of her textbook on 
law, constitution and human rights, which is being 
used for the first time this year in high schools. 
Soul-searching 
At the university level, where law is a subject in 
growing demand, new disciplines are being intro- 
duced, especially in the field of international law. 
Some faculties are trying to encourage more ana- 
lysis and less rote learning, more practice and less 
theory. Although new books are being written by 
professors, many of those still in use date from 
Soviet times, libraries are poor, there is a lack of 
published legal commentaries and a number of law 
faculties are short of qualified teaching staff. The 
multiplication in the number of universities since 
independence (from 9 to 23) has also led to wide 
gaps in quality. The ABA is urging the government 
to set up a national competency standards exam 
for all students wishing to practice law. 
In a country still soul searching after the col- 
lapse of the USSR, youth are likely in the best posi- 
tion for shaping a new ideology. According to the 
OSCE’s Jerzy Wieclaw, “educated youth want to 
think and behave like Europeans, this is their point 
of reference.” Although jobs in the legal field are 
hard to come by at present, Smanalieva has no 
doubts about the commitment of the young. 
“There is a big difference between the young gene- 
ration and ours. We had a complex about expressing 
our minds openly, and this interferes with our abi- 
lity to be creative. T he young speak openly and bra- 
vely and can convince. They are the ones who will 
really bring in reforms.” u

hedding 350 years of colonial servitude 
when it became a state eight years ago, 
kraine has confronted enormous difficul- 
ties in establishing the institutions of democracy, 
including a rule of law. 
In 1995 Ukraine became a member of the 
Council of Europe, voluntarily taking upon itself 
to fulfil obligations concerning the adoption of a 
new democratic constitution, the drafting of new 
civil and criminal codes, the reform of the judi- 
ciary and the harmonizing of its legislation with 
European norms and standards of human rights 
and freedoms. In June 1996, the passage of a 
constitution expressing Ukraine’s desire to build 
a rule of law was hailed by the Council of Europe. 
Yet on the whole there is less democracy in 
Ukraine today than there was four years ago. 
Ukraine is in default of its obligations under the 
terms of its accession to the Council of Europe, the 
judiciary generally remains corrupt and efficient, 
executive and legislative intransigence have left ini- 
tiatives with respect to Ukraine’s commitments 
suspended in a legislative purgatory, and corrup- 
tion is rampant in Ukraine’s public administration. 
As a result, Ukrainian society’s view of the law is 
marked by cynicism and scepticism. 
Soviet legacy 
The genesis of the problem lies in the legacy of 
Soviet rule and the monopoly of state power in 
Ukrainian society. Soviet era elites retained power 
after independence and now continue to wield tre- 
mendous administrative control over the lives of 
citizens. Today they oversee the unbridled distribu- 
tion of state property, and exercise control over 
most economic activity, resulting in widespread 
institutional corruption. They have expanded their 
power by establishing new administrative bodies to 
regulate the private sector and citizens’ private acti- 
vities through the imposition of licences, quotas 
and other controls. With institutions of civil socie- 
ty too weak to hold them to account, the governing 
nomenklatura has no incentive to promote signifi- 
cant democratic, especially legal, reforms so long as 
its members continue to be the principal beneficia- 
ries of the existing system. 
In 1995, I as Minister of Justice designed a 
reform programme in line with the principles of 
the Council of Europe and the provisions of 
Ukraine’s constitution.Our key objectives were to 
have the ministry of justice take the leading role 
in the administration of justice in the country, to 
promote and secure individual human rights and 
freedoms, to create a market-oriented legal infra- 
structure, and generally to incorporate transpa- 
rency and openness in the legal system. 
A comprehensive legal reform programme 
was undertaken, involving everything from the 
rights of the accused upon detention and arrest, 
to the principle of an accused’s innocence until 
guilt is proven. 
‘Clean hands’ 
to wipe out corruption 
But weak governance has allowed corruption 
to flourish.It has resulted in the emergence of the 
present machinery of government where respon- 
sibilities overlap and accountabilities are diffuse, 
in ministerial ownership of commercial activities 
and associated conflicts of interest, in the low pay 
and poor supervision of civil servants and in the 
lack of a public service ethos in the civil service.

A July 1997 demonstration of Kiev tradespeople demanding tax reductions and measures 
against bureaucratic corruption. 
approach based on a transparent, accountable 
public service is a daunting task. 
The ministry of justice undertook concrete 
measures to bring the issues of transparency and 
accountability in government to public attention. 
In April 1997, the President of Ukraine adopted 
a “National Programme against Corruption”, 
popularly referred to as the “Clean Hands” cam- 
paign, developed by the ministry. This program- 
me proposed a systemic approach to the problem 
of corruption, including legislative initiatives, 
deregulation of the economy, and the reform of 
public administration to make it more accoun- 
table and transparent. 
Judges under threat 
The ministry’s reform efforts were vehemently 
resisted by the entrenched nomenklatura in govern- 
ment and the judiciary, largely by implementing 
the programme to the minimum necessary extent, 
then claiming that it had been carried out. 
The problem of building an independent judi- 
ciary proved particularly acute. Today’s judges 
still carry the burden of Soviet traditions, when 
the judiciary often acted in tandem with prosecu- 
tors and communist party officials to suppress the 
rights of individuals. They are under-trained and 
so poorly paid that they are largely at the mercy 
of threats and bribes from the political and admi- 
nistrative authorities over which they should be 
exercising control. It is common for judges to 
receive threats from local authorities to cut off 
electricity, gas and heat if “appropriate” decisions 
are not rendered. Both the public and the judicia- 
ry remain ignorant of the citizens’ constitutional 
rights to be protected from official interference in 
the judicial process. Efforts to establish a legal 
basis for a market economy have not met with 
greater success. 
It is easier to change 
laws than it is to change 
mentalities and inertia.

Making the leap to a rule of law 
Indeed, most citizens of Ukraine are alarmin- 
gly resigned to the status quo, and do not yet 
appreciate, let alone insist upon, the enforcement 
of the rights they now possess. Thus, reform of 
the legal system is hampered by a collective 
memory of the use of the law by state authorities 
as an instrument of oppression, and not as the 
handmaiden of individual liberty. 
This situation is compounded by the state of 
the legal profession. Numerous attempts have fai- 
led over the past few years to establish a profes- 
sional, self-governing law society which would 
ensure the protection of the rights of citizens and 
the provision of quality legal services. The prima- 
ry impediment to the realization of this goal is 
that Ukraine today still possesses a legal culture 
where lawyers are seen, and see themselves, as 
servants of the state. Most law school graduates 
still seek employment in law enforcement bodies 
or in government agencies. 
Stalinist forces 
on the prowl 
The prokuratura—established by Stalin as a 
completely autonomous law enforcement body 
with extensive powers of supervision over all 
levels of government and administration, and 
powers to initiate actions in criminal matters— 
continues to perform many of its Soviet-era func- 
tions, including supervision over judicial deci- 
sions. Even though under Council of Europe 
obligations that are incorporated in the constitu- 
tion, the prokuratura was to have shed its Stalinist 
responsibilities, its investigative powers have been 
expanded. After a brief attempt at reform, the 
State Security Service, the SBU, is once again 
performing many of the functions of its predeces- 
sor, the KGB. With some exceptions, the legal 
profession has largely been silent and ineffective 
in safeguarding citizens against these and other 
abuses of their rights. 
To turn this situation around requires the emer- 
gence of a new legal culture based on the principles 
of the rule of law set out in the constitution. T hese 
provide for a new relationship between the indivi- 
dual and the state, whereby the state undertakes to 
foster, preserve and protect the human rights and 
freedoms of the individual. Realization of these 
objectives requires an understanding of what the 
constitutional rights of the Ukrainian citizen mean 
and how they should be applied. 
This is fundamentally the responsibility of 
Ukraine’s law schools. And here they are failing 
miserably. They remain fundamentally conserva- 
tive. Educators continue to teach that the law is 
an instrument of sanction by the government, 
and not an instrument to protect the rights of citi- 
zens against the excesses of the state. The 
Ukrainian Legal Foundation has made a start 
towards the creation of a new law school along 
the European model by founding the Ukrainian 
Centre for Legal Studies, which teaches human 
rights and market-oriented commercial law. ®

### 117905: A World's eye view of the law

A world’s eye view of the law 
A variety of different legal systems and traditions grew up over many centuries. 
Some were exported far and wide. Now there are signs that they are starting to converge. 
  
   
BB Civil law 
i Common law 
Customary law 
Mixed systems 
Eo Islamic law 
 
2 6 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
Major legal systems 
Civil law: Inspired by Roman law. Legislation is the 
primary source of law. Civil codes are the centre- 
piece of the legal framework and the foundation of 
all other laws which complement or make excep- 
tions to it. The codes are mainly characterized by a 
high level of abstraction which enables the judge 
to interpret and analyse situations either by 
applying the legislation or by extrapolatiing from 
the overall framework. France is a prototypical civil 
law nation. Over 60% of the world population is 
influenced by this tradition. 
Common law: Derived from English unwritten law 
that evolved from the 12th century onward. Known 
as “judge-made law”. Jurisprudence is the primary 
source of law. Developed through an inductive 
approach, legal concepts emerge and progress over 
time,constructed by an amalgamation of numerous 
cases that bring together the legal scope of these 
concepts. Common law prevails in the United King- 
dom, the U.S.A. and most Commonwealth coun- 
tries,influencing over 30% of the world population. 
Islamic law: Controlled, ruled and regulated by the 
Islamic religion and followed by over 20% of the 
world population. Its main source is the holy book, 
the Koran, complemented by the Sunna—limited 
interpretation of the Koran by the prophet. This legal 
methodology is known as Shariah (the way to fol- 
low). The sacred law purports to regulate all aspects 
of society and its citizens. One unique characteristic 
of Islamic law is the precedence of collective rights 
over individual rights. Individual rights and freedoms 
are restricted by the religion’s moral and divine impe- 
ratives. Recent developments have favoured an 
extensive interpretation of the moral rules to adapt to 
the new reality of the 21st century. 
Mixed systems. They include two or more legal 
methods used concurrently or interactively in a 
multi-cultural or multi-religious society. The legal 
systems of many North African and Middle Eastern 
countries are strongly influenced by the civil law tra- 
dition, but in some areas, especially those relating to 
personal status, family matters and property law, 
these countries tend to follow Islamic tradition. 
Customary law: Body of usage and customs that 
have, through time, acquired force of law. T here are 
many expressions of customary law, which can be 
developed notably through religion, race or cultu- 
ral identity. It plays an important role in a relatively 
large number of mixed law countries and, over time, 
many of these nations tend to implement their “cus-

Legal systems in former Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe. The vast majority of these countries were 
part of the civilist legal tradition prior to the 1917 
revolution or postwar changes. Following those 
events, parts of their codes were invalidated to 
accommodate communist ideology, and their civil 
codes were never fully abrogated between 1917- 
1991. Since 1991, Russia and other East European 
countries have been undergoing important reforms

This code has never been discovered but it ismentioned in other 
documents as a consolidation of “ordinances” or laws laid 
down by Mesopotamian kings 
Hm 2050 BC:Ur-Nammu’s Code 
Earliest known written legal code. Evidence shows it was sup- 
ported by a legal system including specialized judges, the giving 
of testimony under oath, and the power of judges to order 
damages to be paid to a victim by the guilty party. 
Hm 1700 BC:Hammurabi’s Code 
This Babylonian king came to power in 1750 BC. Under his rule, 
a code of laws was developed and carved on a huge rock column. 
The expression “an eye for an eye” has come to symbolize the 
code’s underlying principle. 
Hm 1300 BC:The Ten Commandments 
The Prophet Moses received a list of ten laws directly from God. 
Known as the Ten Commandments, they later became part of 
the Bible. 
m 1280 BC to 880 BC:The Laws of Manu 
A written compilation of legal rules which had been passed on 
from generation to generation. It formed the basis of the caste 
system in India, w here people were classified by their social stan- 
ding. Punishment only used as a last resort. Members of higher 
castes punished more severely than those of lower castes. 
Hm 621 BC:Draco’s Law 
Draco, a Greek citizen, was chosen to write a code of law for 
Athens. The code was so severe that the word “ draconian” has 
come to mean unreasonably harsh. 
Hm 450 BC:The Twelve Tables 
These laws written to govern Romans are considered to form 
the foundation of much modern public and private law. Pro- 
moted the organization of public prosecution of crimes and ins- 
tituted a system whereby injured parties could seek compen- 
sation from their aggressors. A basic principle is that the law must 
be written.dustice should not be left to judges alone to inter- 
pret.

The first Chinese imperial code of laws dealt with theft, robbery, 
prison, arrest and general rules It served as a model for the Tang

BW 529: Justinian’s Code 
The Byzantine emperor Justinian is remembered for his codifica- 
tion of Roman law known as the Corpus Juris Civilis. Many legal 
maxims still in use today are derived from the code, which inspi- 
red the modern concept of justice. 
BW 604:The 17-Article Constitution of Japan 
Written by a Japanese prince regent, the Constitution shaped mora- 
lity and law in Japan. One of its dauses said that “ peace and har- 
mony should be respected because they are very important for inter- 
group relations” . Shows emphasis of “ Oriental law” which seeks 
to prevent disputes, whereas “ Western law” seeks to resolve 
disputes.

m 1215:Magna Carta 
King John of England signed Magna Carta (the “ great charter”), 
conceding a number of legal rights to his barons and to the

### 117906: In traditional societies, the jury is out on legal reform

In traditional societies, 
the jury is out 
on legal reform 
  
+ Yash Ghai 
Customary laws do not always easily fit into human rights development 
theories. But they can play an indispensable role in ensuring justice 
have embraced the idea of the rule of law in 
the conviction that legal reform helps nur- 
ture nascent democracy and market-oriented 
economic reforms. 
Despite very important advantages in establi- 
shing a rule of law regime, it is nevertheless a long- 
term enterprise. Meanwhile there are certain costs 
and problems—so often ignored by legal refor- 
mers—with the shift to law as a primary mode of 
organization and framework for policy. 
In many societies it is foolish to think of new 
legal institutions as a panacea. We cannot assume 
that reliance on legal reform will necessarily suc- 
ceed, or that it is appropriate in all cases. 
Psychological attitudes and social conditions 
necessary for the rule of law may be absent in cer- 
tain societies. The rule of law is not easily establi- 
shed in societies where the notion of power is per- 
sonalized, rather than located in an office. Nor is 
the concept of the limitation of power readily assi- 
milated in societies dominated by monarchs or 
chiefs or other kinds of hierarchy. States which 
are largely agrarian, based on the peasantry and 
under the influence of traditional ideologies, are 
less likely than largely urban societies to demand 
the accountability from their rulers that is essen- 
tial for the rule of law. Thus constitutional 
reforms in imperial Ethiopia did little to limit or 
regulate the government.As a result,introduction 
of a rule of law in a Western sense may not only 
fail, but also, it could backfire: that is to say, some 
of the consequences of reliance on law as a 
method of social regulation may be negative. 
Contemporary discussions of the strategy of 
law tend to overlook the reality of countries that 
N umerous countries in the South recently are largely “pre-modern”. Modernity is associa- 
ted with a concept of “rationality” based on a 
belief in the scientific method, and confidence 
that society can be changed and reformed by 
conscious design. Law itself is a deliberate crea- 
tion, aimed at clear objectives and regulation. In 
that sense the role of state law in modern societies 
which have been integrated on the basis of the 
economy, particularly the market economy, and 
which are closely connected to the apparatus of 
the state, can be different from that in societies 
which are still dominated by customary values, 
institutions and practices. 
Cultural factors 
and local loyalties 
Pre-modern societies in most Asian and 
African states have their own systems of gover- 
nance and dispute settlement. Cultural factors 
are more, or at least as, important as the econo- 
mic. Local loyalties transcend loyalty to the state. 
Community pressures are more powerful than 
state sanctions in influencing social behaviour. 
Justice according to local expectations and by 
local institutions is more highly valued than that 
of state law and tribunals. 
Customary laws and methods do not always 
easily fit into the human rights development theo- 
ries which now dominate the redesign of state 
structures, such as the separation of powers or pro- 
fessionalization of justice. There are undoubtedly 
problems with traditional or informal justice. But it 
1s an important resource and we should attempt to 
improve its efficacy rather than to eliminate it. 
Traditional justice can form the basis of inexpensi- 
ve, participatory and accessible forms of justice.

   Making the leap to a rule of law 
A particularly apt illustration of the role of 
customary law comes from the persistence of 
belief in witchcraft in a large number of societies. 
Many aspects of the community, such as recipro- 
city, arrogance or private accumulation of wealth 
may be more effectively managed through fear of 
punishment for transgressions by witchcraft than 
by state regulation. National criminal law may 
command little allegiance in a community which 
does not identify with the state, and which has its 
own moral standards. The weakening of traditio- 
nal structures by modern laws may undermine 
communal mechanisms which help to maintain 
social cohesion. 
Thus the emphasis on the law at the expense 
of customary systems can have quite unexpected 
consequences. It can weaken traditional institu- 
tions, for example of dispute resolution, before 
the institutions of a rule of law can be fully set up 
across a country. It is well known that the tradi- 
tional function of dispute settlement was to main- 
tain balance and harmony in the community and 
Customary laws and methods 
do not always easily fit 
into the human rights 
development theories 
which now dominate 
the redesign of state 
structures, such as 
the separation of powers or 
professionalization of justice 
therefore it aimed at reconciliation. Modern 
methods focus more on retribution and thus may 
fail to remove the underlying causes of conflict. 
There is widespread feeling in Papua New 
Guinea that its problems of crime and violence 
are associated with the decline of traditional sanc- 
tions. The operation of the institutions of modern 
law can put access to justice beyond the means of 
the large majority of people, particularly in the 
rural areas. Courts or other tribunals may not be 
available locally. The apparatus of justice, and 
those required to mobilize it, tend to concentrate 
in urban centres (in Mozambique, for example, a 
recent survey found that only 5 per cent of 
lawyers are located outside Maputo, the capital). 
Access to justice 
Moreover,the financial cost of justice through 
a formal legal system is much greater than in tra- 
ditional systems (as Western states are discove- 
ring). Costs include high salaries and other perks 
for judges; the fees of prosecutors and defence 
lawyers; construction of buildings, libraries and 
remand centres. Rules of fair trial require the pro- 
vision of legal aid, at least in trials for serious 
offences. Few developing states have adequate

### 117906: In traditional societies, the jury is out on legal reform

» diverting them from the more material needs of 
the people. 
The grafting of a modern legal system on to a 
customary one may reduce real access to justice 
for some social groups. One reason is that lawyers 
are able to use their power to oust from the legal 
sector those without full legal qualifications and 
to secure monopolies of legal services. In 
Cambodia and Mozambique, for example, an 
increasingly organized legal profession has exclu- 
ded from the system paralegal defenders who pre- 
viously rendered important legal services after a 
period of six-12 months training, compared with 
several years training for lawyers. This has increa- 
sed the cost of legal services and has reduced 
access to legal representation. 
A fair trial 
Furthermore, formal systems of justice are 
marked by lengthy delays. These are the results 
not only of procedural rules, but also of the shor- 
tage of lawyers and judges (and sometimes of the 
lack of transport to take remand prisoners to 
courts). Police are seldom trained or able to cope 
with the formal legal system. They lack forensic 
and investigative skills, and this leads to long per- 
iods of detention or remand of suspects, or the 
use of pressure, sometimes amounting to torture, 
to extract confessions. The notion of a fair trial 
involves at least one appeal. There is a serious 
backlog of cases, and consequently a denial of 
justice. At the same time, traditional institutions 
which not only would deal expeditiously and 
effectively with these cases, but also provide sta- 
bility in social relations, are marginalized or abo- 
lished. Unencumbered by complex rules of pro- 
cedure and restrictions on admissibility of 
evidence, traditional leaders were able to settle 
disputes speedily. 
Formalization of the legal system and the legal 
profession may decrease the capacity of the 
government itself to make use of the legal system. 
This is the consequence of the high salaries that 
lawyers can command in the private sector. The 
problem is, once again, illustrated by Cambodia 
and Mozambique. Top lawyers in both these 
countries have gravitated to the private sector, 
particularly to service large corporations. As 
governments cannot hire lawyers of equal compe- 
tence due to official salary scales, the government 
1s at considerable disadvantage during negotia- 
tions with a corporation or investors as a group. 
In both these states, considerable legislative draf- 
ting is done by private firms of lawyers; in fact 
they, and not the government end by making poli- 
cy in crucial public matters. The difficulties for 
the government are aggravated as these develop- 
ments lead to greater integration of the national 
economy into the global system, increasing the 
reliance on lawyers with international and com- 
parative expertise. 
This brings us to a fundamental problem 
underlying legal reform in many pre-modern

societies. The assumption behind the present stra- 
tegy of law, reflected in foreign assistance for 
democratization or conditions for other forms of 
assistance, is that there is a unity of purpose bet- 
ween democracy and markets, and that similar 
institutions and laws serve them both. However, 
the law for the market may have a different struc- 
ture and dynamics from that for democracy. Law 
for democracy is about the empowerment and 
protection of all people, particularly the weak; but 
law for the market is about conferring power on 
the rich and the well organized. Property, a prin- 
cipal legal instrument for the market, reduces the 
scope for commons, i.e., property owned collecti- 
vely, and transforms it into a private entity. 
This results in the impoverishment of many 
and the enrichment of a few. Property, combined 
with another legal instrument for the market, 
contract, has become the major means whereby 
capitalists own, and exercise control over, the 
labour, and other resources, of the poor. 
Laws made 
by private interests 
These developments have at least two adverse 
effects on democracy. First, more and more poli- 
cies and laws are made at the behest of foreign 
states and capital, reducing the scope of national 
democratic decision making. Increasingly these 
laws are made by private interests, either in inter- 
national economic institutions, or more directly 
by commercial corporations through joint ven- 
tures and arbitration regimes. For example, many 
countries have been pressed to bring in legislation 
on intellectual property rights, particularly in 
genetic engineering, which has opened natural 
resources to foreign ownership. In India such 
legislation was opposed widely by farmers and 
other interest groups, but the government was 
under great pressure from the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) and the U.S. government to 
enact it. Finally, mention can be made of laws or 
regulations which have eaten away at workers’ 
rights,or welfare provisions for education or heal- 
th, despite considerable public opposition. 
Secondly, there is a distinct shift of domestic 
political power to wealthy domestic classes, in 
alliance with foreign capital. A large part of these 
developments are brought about by and encapsu- 
lated in the law, which is often imposed, as the 
above examples show, and as is illustrated by the 
conditions imposed on Korea, Thailand and 
Indonesia by the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund for assistance to them during the 
recent financial crises. 
I realize that there is no easy answer to the 
problems of change. There is undoubtedly a dan- 
ger of romanticizing traditional systems, forget- 
ting the oppression that takes place within its 
interstices. It is sufficient here to warn against the 
opposite tendency, the romanticizing of formal 
legalized systems,and to urge caution in the stra- 
tegy of law. nu 
lt goes without saying 
that a law 
to be valid must be clear 
enough to make its 
commands.

### 117907: Benin: justice on the horizon

Benin: justice on the horizon 
   
The law is paramount in Benin, but the courts and the police are still not 
enforcing it effectively 
  
 
Mathieu Kérékou,democratically elected president of Benin in 1996.He was required 
by the country’s constitutional court to retake the oath of office after leaving out several 
words during the first ceremony. 
  
© Director of the Unesco Courier 
6 enty-five thieves burned alive in Benin by 
vigilante groups,” read the headline on a 
recent news agency story. After a spate of 
robberies and rapes, the thieves, mostly immigrants, 
were publicly burned to death in the southeastern 
province of Couffo in August. The government 
sent troops to beef up the local police, but lynch law 
is spreading and replacing police work and the judi- 
cial process. 
Yet the U.S. State Department and human 
rights organizations both within and outside Benin 
say the country has become “a constitutional demo- 
cracy”’ and “is now living under the rule of law”. 
Benin is held up as an example in sub-Saharan 
Africa, where “the wind of democracy” that blew in 
the early 1990s is otherwise dying down. 
Benin is ahead of the pack,says Maurice Glele 
Ahanhanzo, a member of the country’s constitu- 
tional court, because legal principles are now so 
deeply rooted in the population that “they have 
become the main instrument for regulating life in 
society”. However, the Beninese can see that these 
principles are still very far from being effectively 
applied, even by the courts. They draw their own 
conclusions, all too often by taking the law into 
their own hands. 
Benin’s “democratic revival”’is home-grown— 
it hasn’t been copied from elsewhere. Unlike the 
situation in many other French-speaking African 
states,it does not stem from the loss of a powerful 
ally after the Berlin Wall came down. Nor is it the 
result of pressure following France’s decision, 
announced by President Francois Mitterrand in a 
speech to francophone African leaders in June 
1990, to make aid to African countries conditional 
upon their progress towards democracy. If there has 
been any outside influence, it has come from the 
foreign aid agencies whose intervention became 
indispensable because of Benin’s rundown eco- 
nomy. 
The “democratic revival”is above all the result 
of a dynamic process within Beninese society that 
was triggered by the rejection of 17 years of 
“Marxist-Leninist” dictatorship. The old regime’s 
death knell was sounded in February 1990 by a 
conference, the first of its kind in Africa,that brought 
together the “dynamic forces of the nation”. A 
constitution adopted a few months later was “in its 
entirety devised, sought for and drafted by the 
people of Benin,” says Ahanhanzo. It started by 
“affirming the deep-rooted opposition” of the Beni- 
nese people to the previous regime’s legal viola- 
tions and other failings. 
A counterweight 
to the authorities 
Another factor lies in the prestigious history of 
Benin, previously known as Dahomey, and the nos- 
talgia it gives rise to. The educational system was 
much better than elsewhere. The country was a seed- 
plot of intellectuals and earned the nickname “the 
Latin Quarter of Africa” after the famous Paris stu- 
dent district. Its “graduates” staffed colonial admi- 
nistrative services all over West Africa. T he remarkable 
“democratic revival” fits into a long history that 
Beninese are very proud of. The preamble to the 
constitution states that Beninese want to “once more 
be the pioneers of democracy and the defenders of 
human rights that we were until quite recently.” 
The constitution devotes 33 articles to a detailed 
exposition of all basic rights, as if its authors had 
wanted to cover all the authoritarian practices the 
country had experienced. The articles set forth 
political,civil, economic and social rights,including 
a “right to development” in all its forms. Above 
all, the document makes the constitutional court the 
keystone of the new rule of law. T he court is em po- 
wered to give an opinion, when requested to do so, 
on any prospective laws or regulations which might 
infringe human rights. Even more important, it 
can also, on its own initiative, pass judgment on such 
laws or regulations after they have been adopted. 
What’s more, any citizen can bring a suit of this »

» nature before the court without paying a fee. 
This facility, which does not exist in the world’s 
old, most entrenched democracies,is widely used. 
Around a third of the court’s 468 decisions up to the 
end of 1998 concerned human rights violations. 
Some other decisions have been widely trumpeted. 
The court’s seven judges annulled the election of the 
wife of the country’s first democratically-elected 
president, Nicéphore Soglo, as a parliamentary 
deputy. They also forced his successor, former dic- 
tator Mathieu Kérékou, who was democratically 
elected in March 1996, to re-take his oath of office 
because he had “omitted” several words the first 
time round. 
The court has become the main counterweight 
to the authorities because of its wide powers and the 
extremely independent way it has used them. Its 
integrity is unquestioned. According to a recent 
survey! it is the country’s best-known institution 
and, for 94 per cent of those polled, the one they 
‘There’s a two-speed 
approach to civil liberties. 
At the top you've got 
tremendous freedom; at the 
bottom, 
trust most. 
Totally different opinions were expressed about 
the police and the other courts,however. All those 
polled felt that “a policeman can wield complete 
power over you at the drop of a hat”. Arbitrary 
arrests,unauthorized searches, brutal detention in 
custody for longer than the maximum legal period 
are common, and prison conditions are inhuman. 
Ninety-two per cent of those who took part in the 
survey said they had no confidence in the legal 
system because it was corrupt and too slow. 
“There’s a two-speed approach to civil liberties,” 
says Julien Togbadja, head of Benin’s Human Rights 
League. “At the top you’ve got tremendous freedom; 
at the bottom, massive violations.” Ninety-four per 
cent of those polled said “powerful people often 
intervene to halt or pervert the course of justice.” 
The judges have some solid arguments on their 
side,starting with their extremely inadequate faci- 
lities and pay. The first computers, for example, 
have only just arrived—as a gift. Justice gets a 
normal share of the national budget (1.6 per cent in 
1999) but the country has only 144 judges (one for 
every 8,000 citizens), a fifth of the figure in indus- 
trialized countries. Given their meagre salaries ran- 
ging from $200 to $600 a month gross, heroic 
efforts are needed to resist bribery. 
For ordinary citizens, justice is remote. The 
only court of appeal sits in the capital and 90 per 
1.The survey was carried out for a conference on “the 
critical assessment of respect for individual human rights 
and democratic practice in Benin” (Cotonou,September 
17-18, 1998) organized by Benin’s Institute for Human 
Rights and the Promotion of Democracy.

cent of the population neither speak nor read French, 
the only language used in law books and trials. In prin- 
ciple, legal fees don’t exist, but the courts are increa- 
singly asking those involved to contribute to their 
costs. Also, for cultural reasons, lawsuits create hatred 
and bitterness which endure for generations. As a 
result, Beninese go in for extra-legal “arrangements” 
and at worst resort to lynching. 
Democratic revival 
But they still want the law to be more widely 
applied. “Civil society is very active in the face of the 
authorities’ many attempts to curb freedoms,” says 
Togbadja. The impetus for this mobilization comes 
from the independent media (about 10 newspapers, 
a dozen radio stations and four television channels), 
human rights NGOs (no less than 100 of them), the 
churches and, says Togbadja, “a handful” of politi- 
cians. This is because “the political class grew up 
under the old totalitarian regime,” says Virgile Akpovo 
of the Human Rights Institute. 
The democratic revival is going strong, chorus 
Benin’s human rights campaigners. They are parti- 
cularly happy about the start of a programme to 
modernize the legal system and improve prison 
conditions, as well as to apply a constitutional clause 
that says human rights must be taught in schools and 
even in the armed forces. 
But the activists also firmly agree that the move- 
ment is fragile and that the main threat comes not 
from people’s attitudes or from laws or institutions, 
but from underdevelopment. Social and economic 
rights are virtually a dead letter because of widespread 
corruption and impoverishment. 
In addition, says Ahanhanzo, “there can be no rule 
of law without a state.” He criticizes liberalization and 
structural adjustment policies, and asks “how can 
anyone think of downsizing a state which is already 
in poor shape?’ As Senegalese President Abdou 
Diouf likes to point out, “hunger is incompatible 
with democracy,” because it means people “can’t 
play their part as citizens.” nu

### 117908: South Africa: blending tradition and change

South Africa: blending 
tradition and change 
  
+ Ferial Haffajee 
In South Africa’s Herculean task of law reform, women’s groups are in the vanguard 
of the movement to adapt traditional law to post-apartheid society 
hen former President Nelson Mandela 
Ww married Graca Machel last year, their Wes- 
tern ceremony was simple and secret. But 
their customary marriage in the verdant hills of 
Xunu in the Transkei was treated like an occasion 
of state. Machel was welcomed in traditional dress 
by the elders of the Tembu clan in a ceremony 
beamed around the world. And Mandela’s elders 
negotiated her bride price or lobola with Machel’s 
Mozambican kin. 
 
In January 1999,Thabo Mbeki is blessed by village elders before successfully running for the 
South African presidency after the retirement of Nelson Mandela.

Financial Times 
The event was significant for many reasons, yet 
above all, it moved traditional customs and laws 
from the fringes to the centre of South African 
society. It signaled a shift in power for customary law 
which the apartheid state treated as common law’s 
“poor cousin”. 
A groundswell of innovation is underway to 
instill new authority, resources and dignity to cus- 
tomary law. Not only is the aim to correct historical 
injustice, but to rebuild trust in the criminal justice 
system and respect for the rule of law. T he challenge 
lies in building a legal system which integrates 
common and customary law in line with the new 
constitution, enshrining such fundamental prin- 
ciples as gender equality. “The old, unequal rela- 
tionship between common law as the big brother 
and customary law as the poor cousin is gone,” 
says Professor Thandabantu Nhlapo of the South 
African Law Commission. “Both have to be judged 
in terms of the constitution.” T his harmonization 
process marks a major step in South Africa’s Her- 
culean task of legal reform. The first step lay in 
repealing apartheid laws. Next came the need to 
reconstitute the Law Commission, which was domi- 
nated by racist judges of the old regime.N ow it must 
shape new laws to govern a new social order. 
Customary law in South Africa has suffered 
similar travails to those of other African countries 
with a colonial past. Afrikaner governments inherited 
a dual legal system of common and customary law 
from British colonizers. They codified this mixed 
system into the Native Administration Act which in 
1986 became the Black Administration Act— 
sculpted as a tool to divide, by fine-tuning the sepa- 
rate system of administration for blacks. Under the 
Act,customary law was tolerated so long as it wasn’t 
deemed “repugnant” to common law, in which case 
it was nullified. 
Swift, cheap justice 
Yet customary law is probably the only form of 
Justice known to many South Africans. About half the 
population lives in the countryside where traditional 
courts administer customary law in over 80 per 
cent of villages. The courts, which are also found in 
some urban townships, deal with everyday disputes 
like petty theft, property disagreements and domestic 
affairs—{rom marriage to divorce and succession. 
(The courts cannot impose fines of more than $6 and 
serious crimes are tried by formal courts.) 
Justice 1s swift and cheap as the courts are run 
with minimal formalities and charge less than a 
dollar for a hearing. The judges use everyday lan- 
guage, and the rules of evidence allow the com- 
munity to interject and question testimonies. T hese 
courts are close to the people who don’t have the 
money or time to travel to towns for formal courts. 
Yet the system is not without its critics—namely 
women, who are barred from serving as judges and 
often discriminated against as litigants. Paradoxically, 
women’s groups, under the umbrella of the Rural 
Women’s Movement, have been in the vanguard of 
efforts to recognize customary law and adapt it to post- 
apartheid society. Discussions about ways of elevating 
customary law are intertwined with debates on making »

> it gender-neutral. Three issues top the agenda: tradi- 
tional marriages,inheritance rights and the status of 
traditional courts. 
Under apartheid, traditional or customary law 
marriages were not legally recognized and only 
regarded as “unions”.If a couple couldn’t afford a 
common law marriage, the woman was considered 
a “minor” who wasn’t even allowed to open a credit 
account with a local grocer. Most rural women 
raise their children alone as their husbands are 
migrant workers in mines and industrial centres. 
“The women couldn’t buy anything. They had to 
wait for their husbands to return from the city in 
order to sell property,” says Likhapa Mbatha of 
the Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS), a 
legal think-tank. Thus, the Recognition of Custo- 
mary Marriages Act was passed last year after close 
collaboration between the SA Law Commission 
and the women’s movement. For Mbatha, “It’s a 
recognition that South Africa is in Africa.” 
Reforming and recognizing 
traditional courts 
This first victory was about righting an apartheid 
wrong: disrespect for customary law. The next step 
lies in making it gender-neutral. According to cus- 
tomary law, only males can inherit property and 
wealth.Nhlapo’s sub-committee has proposed brin- 
ging this law into line with the non-discriminatory 
common law. Indeed, the proposal may not be as 
radical as it appears. In a research project, CALS 
found that many villages have informal ways of 
ensuring inheritance to widows and daughters. A 
parliamentary decision on the proposed changes is 
anxiously awaited. 
The third priority lies in reforming and reco- 
gnizing traditional courts. South Africa’s common 
law criminal justice system is buckling under the 
weight of shrinking budgets and poor management, 
according to the National Director of Prosecu- 
tions. Nhlapo sees a partial remedy in expanding the 
operations of the traditional courts which have the 
respect of the people—an essential ingredient in 
reinforcing the rule of law. “You must empower 
traditional courts to dispense justice in a way and in 
a language that people understand,” says Nhlapo, 
“by bringing traditional courts in line with the 
constitution and financially investing in them.” To 
begin breaking down the gender barricades to jus 
tice, the South African Law Commission recom- 
mends having elected councillors preside with tra- 
ditional chiefs in their courts. However, the women’s 
lobby does not fully trust the chiefs and headmen. 
So instead of formally recognizing these courts or 
expanding their powers, the lobby would simply like 
to see them treated as local arbitration tribunals. Not 
surprisingly, the proposition has ignited an open 
battle with the traditional leaders, who want to 
strengthen their courts. 
The jury is still out on the traditional courts 
system. Whatever the outcome, it will be a milestone 
in South Africa’s history and quest for justice. ®

+ Katherine Arms 
In an increasingly conflict-prone society, ordinary Chinese are shunning guanxi— personal

abourers fell victim is now so common that 
the case might well have escaped public notice. 
Four years ago the women, from a poor area of 
inland Hebei province, came to the country’s capi- 
tal to work at the Huayi Clothing Mill,a fully Chi- 
nese-owned business. Given a slowdown in the eco- 
nomy, the women considered themselves lucky to 
have jobs. Unfortunately, however, the clothing mill 
didn’t pay its workers for more than a year. 
The women complained to local authorities, 
but to no avail.Finally, as a last resort they applied 
to the Centre for Women’s Law Studies and Legal 
Services in Beijing for help. 
Recently, they won their lawsuit and have been 
awaiting a decision on damages. Their lawyer esti- 
mates that a total of between $120,000 and

$230,000 will be awarded to the 80 women. 
Amounting to between $1,500 and $2,900 per per- 
son,that may not sound like much, but compared 
to the average per capita income in China it repre- 
sents a small fortune. 
What is perhaps most amazing about this story 
is that the women bothered to turn to the courts at 
all given that the judicial system has such shallow 
roots in both pre- and post-revolution China. 
Though the legal system is in its infancy and, accor- 
ding to human rights activists, is subject to govern- 
ment interference in the case of sensitive political 
issues, it is nevertheless being taken increasingly 
seriously. 
In imperial times up until the beginning of this 
century, China didn’t even have lawyers. Rather, 
it had scribes, commonly known as “litigation

people who felt they had been wronged. Engaging in 
this practice was potentially dangerous. “Habitual 
litigation tricksters” could be exiled to the “mala- 
rial regions” of the south. 
After the 1949 communist revolution, the prio- 
rity of the judicial system was to serve socialism, a 
principle which often worked against protection of 
individuals’ rights. Things got worse. During the 
Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Mao Zedong 
wiped out legal institutions in favour of “revolutio- 
nary justice”. 
Coping with 
a judicial vacuum 
In this vacuum, ordinary Chinese people have 
had to depend on informal neighbourhood com- 
mittees, commonly run by elderly, retired women 
workers forming a sort of granny patrol, or on party 
or government leaders to intervene in disputes. 
Invariably, the politically well-positioned have used 
guanxi, the Chinese term for personal connections, 
to sway arbitrators. Meanwhile, those without good 
guanxi have often had no choice but to suffer in 
silence, or make a desperate journey to Beijing 
where they camp outside the State Council’s peti- 
tion office for days or weeks hoping that some 
government official might give them a sympathetic 
ear. 
Since the end of the Cultural Revolution and the 
beginning of economic reform in the late 1970s, the 
Chinese leadership has gradually been rebuilding a 
legal system. T his year, for the first time, the govern- 
ment amended the national constitution to declare 
China a country governed “according to the law”. 
This may seem banal, but legal experts say the 
clause is important. Although reference to a “rule of 
law” is not made as such, “basically, the spirit is the 
same,” says Wang Chenguang, associate professor of

One underlying reason for the switch to reliance on 
law is that the old party and community structures 
can no longer cope. In big cities, where high rises now 
house significant swathes of society, many of them 
recently arrived, neighbours no longer know each 
other as they did,say, two decades ago when govern- 
ment restrictions on movement made it virtually 
impossible to switch abodes. Local committee elders 
are reluctant to interfere in the lives of people they 
don’t know, and residents are unwilling to counte- 
nance interference, says Wang, a former member of 
Beijing University’s law faculty and practicing lawyer 
in Beijing. 
Corruption and regionalism 
At a practical level, Beijing now sees the legal sys- 
tem as a possible solution to two of its biggest hea- 
daches:corruption,which President Jiang Zemin has 
called the single biggest threat to the future of the 
Communist Party; and regionalism, in which local 
officials give preference to local companies, official 
bodies and other entities,a trend which many central 
government officials believe undermines national 
unity. 
Meanwhile, say other experts, society is simply 
becoming increasingly conflict-ridden as the rapid 
change to a free-market economy presents all sorts of 
new opportunities for disputes. For example, since 
China abandoned co-operative farming and turned 
towards free enterprise, more and more people have 
flocked to cities and towns to find work. The poor and 
uneducated are frequently victimized by greedy or 
abusive bosses. 
There are now in China some 140,000 lawyers, 
still a small number in a country of 1.2 billion people. 
But with free enterprise growing law is increasingly 
popular amongst students as a lucrative vocation. 
Since the Centre for Women’s Law Studies opened 
in 1995, six staff lawyers have assisted more than 7,000 
people, according to Guo Jianmei, a lawyer and the 
centre’s director. She says they have tried more than 
400 cases and have won more than half. Guo credits 
the UN Fourth World Conference on Women held in 
Beijing in 1995 with giving the centre a big push. 
“Many people from foreign countries came here 
and they asked us, ‘Do you have legal aid? and we 
told them we didn’t.It started the whole discussion,” 
she says. 
Spreading the word about basic legal rights is a 
fundamental necessity. In 1993, Xie Lihua founded 
Rural Women Knowing All, the first publication for 
migrant women. She was interested in the plight of 
rural women in big cities without money and exploi- 
ted by employers. There are an estimated one million 
migrant women in Beijing alone,many of whom have 
no idea they have rights, says Xie, whose magazine 
has a circulation of 220,000 and an estimated reader- 
ship of 14 million. 
“It used to be:‘I order you to do this’without any 
question,” says Xie. Now “we are moving from a plan- 
ned economy to a market economy and with this move 
our laws have to change as well.” u

### 117910: Law and social justice

Law and social justice 
  
* Kerry Rittich 
Law reform in the service of democracy must find ways 
of protecting the vulnerable 
to the top of the development agenda. Interna- 
ional financial institutions and influential 
donors continually stress the importance of the rule 
of law, a healthy regulatory environment and strong 
and consistent enforcement of rights to successful 
economic development. In the new world order, the 
state’s role is to facilitate private activity rather than 
guarantee the welfare of its citizens. 
But there is growing concern that market reforms 
and globalization are connected to greater social stra- 
tification and economic inequality. What is often 
overlooked is that legal reform may enhance rather 
than alleviate this stratification and inequality. 
It is important to see legal reform as a key part 
of a broader set of policy, legislative and institutio- 
nal reforms which are designed to create not simply 
rule- and norm-based societies but particular types 
of market economies. There are no “free” markets; 
functioning markets depend upon a legal infra- 
structure and acommitment to the rule of law. The 
growing interest in legal reform indicates nothing if 
not the widespread recognition of this fact. 
egal reform and “good governance” have vaulted 
Tradeoffs between 
efficiency and equity 
Respecting the rule of law and protecting rights 
however does not mean that there is any one best set 
of laws,even in a market economy. Yet legal reform 
projects in developing and transitional countries have 
become inseparably associated with the idea of a 
single, optimal path or model. Current projects 
emphasize strong protection for property rights,the 
consistent enforcement of contracts and, increasin- 
gly, financial sector regulation as the foundation of an 
investor-friendly legal infrastructure. At the same 
time, states in transition to markets have been dis- 
couraged from adopting or retaining “excessive” 
regulations, including protective labour market poli- 
cies that might impede growth and efficiency. 
Market-oriented legal reforms can affect the for- 
tunes of different groups in at least three different 
ways. T he first is through the types of reforms that are 
implemented. Because legal reforms allocate rights 
and entitlements, different rule structures may well 
benefit different groups in different ways. In some 
instances, there may be tradeoffs between efficiency 
and equity. Strong property rights will protect 
owners and entrepreneurs but may contribute to the 
disadvantage of renters and workers; environmen-

tal and consumer protection laws protect the public 
at large but impose costs on businesses. 
Second, people can be affected by the absence of 
particular laws. Labour standards and laws authori- 
zing collective bargaining, for example, have been 
crucial in industrialized societies. If they are weak or 
missing as they are in many developing countries,or 
if they are indefinitely postponed because priority is 
given to implementing laws and regulations which 
facilitate economic transactions, vast numbers of 
people can find themselves worse off than they need 
be in the market for labour. Particular groups may 
also be harmed. Women with caregiving obligations 
are likely to be systematically disadvantaged and shut 
out of better work opportunities without market 
regulations which ensure that part of these costs are 
borne by others. T his is especially likely where social 
programmes and subsidies are reduced or eliminated 
at the same time, as has occurred in many parts of 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
Open debate 
Finally, where legal reforms follow a “standard 
form” or are designed by experts from afar, a com- 
mon experience in transitional states, the risk is 
that local history and priorities will be ignored or 
displaced and democratic control over decisions 
about basic social organization is weakened. 
To avoid aggravating inequality and worsening 
the position of those who are frequently already 
vulnerable in the reform process, three conditions 
need to be met. 
First, conflicts of interests—between workers 
and entrepreneurs, for example—as well as the 
necessary tradeoffs that legal reforms often entail 
should be acknowledged openly, rather than hidden 
behind the veil of efficiency. This will allow coun- 
tries to debate more openly the political and distri- 
butive choices that legal reforms involve. 
Second, donor countries and international 
financial institutions need to rethink the position 
that state “intervention” is usually or necessarily 
the enemy of economic development. 
Third, developing states need much more 
space, indeed they should be actively encouraged, 
to accommodate distributive, equity and social 
concerns not only through social programmes and 
transfers but through the processes of legal and 
regulatory reform as well. T his would allow greater 
attention to labour market concerns and environ- 
mental protection as well as to poverty alleviation 
and gender,racial and ethnic equity. u

### 117911: Taking the sweat out of sweatshops

TAKING THE SWEAT 
OUT OF SWEATSHOPS 
  
+ Ruth Mayne 
Thanks to an alliance between northern consumers and workers in the South hundreds 
of companies have adopted codes of conduct designed to improve labour conditions 
From London to Nicaragua, consu- 
mers and workers are uniting to attack 
an age-old scourge: sweatshops. Major 
consumer campaigns are gaining ground 
across Western Europe and North America 
by joining forces with non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and trade unions in 
the South to demand respect for workers’ 
basic rights. 
The roots of the campaigns go back to the 
late 1980s, when NGOs and trade unions 
began working together to mobilize and chan- 
nel growing public awareness and outrage 
over exploitative labour practices as countries, 
particularly in the South, competed for foreign 
investment by denying workers’fundamen- 
tal rights (like joining a trade union) and large 
companies relocated factories from country 
to country in search of cheap labour. 
The campaigns have basically taken two 
approaches. The first, dubbed fair trade ini- 
tiatives, seeks to help small producers in 
developing countries receive a fair price for 
their work. NGOs help them by promoting 
niche markets for their products—ranging 
from handwoven rugs to coffee beans. 
Eventually, the producers also gain access 
to mainstream markets, with special labels 
indicating their “fair trade” products. 
In the second spate of campaigns, refer- 
red to as ethical trade initiatives,N GOs, trade 
unions and consumers pressure (via petitions 
and demonstrations) large multinational 
companies to adopt codes of conduct res- 
pecting minimum labour standards for their 
factories and those of their suppliers. While 
both kinds of campaign can complement one 
another, they have different aims. Labels aim 
at helping individual producers in developing 
countries, whereas codes seek to improve 
labour conditions in mainstream industries 
such as retailing and manufacturing textiles, 
clothing, footwear and toys in both the North 
and South.

rer, which agreed to a code of conduct after 
a heated consumer campaign in North Ame- 
rica and Europe backed up by media exposés 
of labour abuse in Indonesia, China and 
Thailand. Clothing companies like Levi 
Strauss, Liz Clairborne and The Gap have 
also adopted codes to protect their brand 
names. While there is no precise data concer- 
ning the number of companies adopting 
codes, the International Labour Organisa- 
tion (ILO) counted and reviewed more than 
200 codesin a 1998 report.O ver 80 per cent 
of the codes had been adopted by multina- 
tional enterprises, mostly based in the North. 
A new departure 
The code campaigns can be seen as a 
response to the stark failure of governments 
and multilateral institutions to help ensure 
a fair distribution of trade benefits to wor- 
kers and small producers. With govern- 
ments and business increasingly hostile to 
statutory regulation and trade unions since 
the late 1980s, the campaigning groups 
have focused on market-based mechanisms 
to achieve social and environmental goals. 
The code campaigns have made it 
easier to build consensus between northern 
and southern NGOs than previous 
attempts at reforming the world trading 
system. Trade union proposals in the mid- 
1990s for a workers’ rights clause at the 
World Trade Organization!, for example, 
were viewed with great suspicion by many 
developing country governments. They saw 
such clauses as a new form of northern pro- 
tectionism aimed at keeping cheaper sou- 
thern goods out of their markets. They were 
also mindful of past campaigns gone awry: 
consumer boycotts backfired as companies 
simply changed suppliers or relocated their 
factories. The result: lost jobs, not improved 
working conditions. The codes mark a new 
departure by stressing the need for co-ope- 
ration: companies are encouraged to adopt » 
1 The International Confederation of Free Trade 
Unions (ICFTU) has suggested a social or 
workers’ rights clause that would make WTO 
privileges conditional on compliance with a set of 
internationally agreed fundamental workers’ 
rights. The ILO would retain the role of 
monitoring and judging infringements.

A textile factory in a Nicaragua free zone in 1990, before the adoption of an ethical code. 
a strategy of long-term engagement with 
suppliers to improve working conditions 
over time, rather than taking the simpler 
but potentially more damaging route of 
withdrawing their business when labour 
abuses are found and highlighted by consu- 
mer campaigns. 
For codes to be effective, they must meet 
a few basic conditions. First, all relevant 
actors—especially workers—have to be invol- 
ved in their design and implementation.Not 
only must they include the seven core ILO 
conventions (assuring respect for human 
rights at the workplace, including freedom of 
association and collective bargaining) but 
they must address local concerns, like 
migrant labour. The codes should also apply 
to “flexible” and informal sector workers 
where possible and promote long-term enga- 
gement to improving conditions. Indepen- 
dent verification is indispensable. 
Boosting morale 
and productivity 
In the UK, for example, the top five retai- 
lers, including Marks & Spencer and C &A, 
have agreed to adopt ethical codes of conduct 
after three years of consumer lobbying gal- 
vanized by the Clothes Code Campaign laun- 
ched by Oxfam, an international non-govern- 
mental aid organization. Thousands of 
consumers petitioned the companies, while 
Oxfam staff made the case for ethical trade 
with senior corporate managers who soon 
saw the commercial advantages of the codes. 
A code can do more than just safeguard a 
company’s public image. By improving wor- 
king conditions, a code can boost staff morale 
and productivity—both essential for making 
a company more competitive. 
However, consumer support is only one 
part of the equation: local labour associa- 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
tions must play a central role in developing 
and implementing codes. In the Dominican 
Republic, for example, the non-govern- 
mental organization CIPAF (Research 
Centre for Action on Women) is joining 
forces with Oxfam to develop a code for 
workers in the free trade zones. The Domi- 
nican campaign is linked to a wider network 
of women’s associations trying to improve 
labour conditions across Central America 
under the banner, “Work, yes—but with 
dignity!” (See article next page.) 
Even though the Dominican constitu- 
tion and labour code enshrine the right to 
freedom of association and collective bar- 
gaining, many companies in the free trade 
zones prevent unionization by intimidating 
and black-listing organizers, while massively 
hiring temporary workers. According to local 
NGOs, confrontation was the traditional res- 
ponse, with workers’organizations denoun- 
cing company violations and employers dis- 
puting the allegations, while threatening to 
move their operations to other countries. 
The government was left paralyzed, fearful 
of losing jobs. However, these dynamics are 
now changing in the Dominican Republic. 
Given the campaign’s international expo- 
sure, companies are now beginning to nego- 
tiate with workers and government to pro- 
duce a joint code of conduct for all free trade 
zones in the country. 
Practice lags 
behind rhetoric 
While the campaigns mark a major step 
forward, they have limits. Codes can com- 
plement but not replace government regu- 
lation. Governments are ultimately res- 
ponsible for enforcing human rights and 
the rule of law. However imperfectly they 
perform this role in practice, they are the 
body best suited to mediate between the 
different interest groups in society when 
setting and enforcing labour standards. 
Another key concern is that corporate 
practice often lags behind the rhetoric of 
support for ethical trade.In a 1998 review 
of 215 codes of conduct, the ILO found 
that only 15 per cent included freedom of 
association and collective bargaining. Only 
25 per cent of the codes had provisions to 
prevent forced labour—or the refusal to 
contract with companies using forced 
labour. And very few had monitoring requi- 
rements. 
The ILO also points out the arbitrary 
nature of consumer pressure campaigns 
which mainly single out companies with a 
brand name to protect. They also tend to 
focus on exporting companies and so do 
not necessarily cover workers in the domes- 
tic sector. 
Fear of 
bureaucracy 
But these are arguments for improving 
the initiatives rather than abandoning them 
altogether. Some of the problems could be 
in part rectified by a shift to home-grown 
industry or sector-wide codes of conduct 
which would promote greater involvement 
by developing country suppliers and 
governments. The ILO might also help to 
develop an internationally agreed model 
code of conduct—although this might 
spark resistance. 
Some NGOs are concerned that ILO 
involvement would overly-bureaucratize 
the campaigns. Some developing country 
governments are also wary of ILO support 
for these schemes out of fear of northern 
protectionism. 
The campaigns are now at a crossroads. 
Hundreds of codes have been adopted by 
companies, the next step lies in applying 
them.One thing is certain:the impetus for 
voluntary initiatives will not go away as long 
as the workers fail to receive a fair distri- 
bution of the wealth they help to create.

### 117912: Work, yes - but with dignity!

‘WORK, YES—8BUT 
WITH DIGNITY?! 
  
+ Roberto Fonseca 
ETHICS 
Nicaraguan workers have prevailed on foreign employers to adopt a code of ethics enshrining 
respect for their rights and better working conditions 
After more than a decade of war and 
internal conflict, peace officially retur- 
ned to Nicaragua in May 1990.T hou- 
sands of members of the so-called “Contra 
army” laid down their weapons and tens of 
thousands of reservists and soldiers were reti- 
red.Many of them automatically swelled the 
army of the unemployed. 
“When the war ended, we didn’t know 
what to do, we felt exposed. I got a job in a 
factory at the Las Mercedes industrial free 
trade zone, picking up garbage and cleaning 
machinery,” says Eugenia. Her experience is 
echoed by many women working in the 
country’s maquila’ assembly industries. Euge- 
nia never thinks of leaving her job. “There 
aren’t any other factories” she says, “and I'm 
40) years old, so I have to stay where I am and 
put up with things without complaining.” 
Violence 
The Las Mercedes free zone currently 
has more than 20 textile assembly plants, 
most of them Asian-owned and directly pro- 
viding over 18,000 jobs, 80 per cent of them 
held by women. These factories exported 
more than $135 million worth of goods in 
1997, compared with the slightly more than 
$200 million earned by the country’s main 
export, coffee. For many years, the local 
media attacked the violation of labour laws 
by the factories. Women in particular were 
the victims of persistent physical,psycholo- 
gical and verbal abuse. They were also fired 
simply because they became pregnant. 
“There was a really violent aspect to life 
in the free zone,” says Sandra Ramos, leader 
of the Maria Elena Cuadra Movement of 
Working and Unemployed Women.“To try 
to end the abuses, we forced a code of 
conduct on the assembly plants.” 
The 10-article code deals with matters 
like maternity leave, working hours, overtime 
wages, regular medical checkups and job secu- 
rity. It 1s the first of its kind to be negotiated 
and put into effect in Central America, where 
Editor-in-chief, La Prensa, Managua (Nicaragua) 
there are about 1,100 such factories 
employing more than 300,000 workers. 
Under the banner, “Work, yes—but with 
dignity!” (the slogan of a coalition of women’s 
labour groups lobbying for codes of conduct 
across Central America), the Nicaraguan ini- 
tiative owes its success to workers’determi- 
nation and strong public support which took 
the shape of a 30,000-signature petition. 
The ministry of labour made the code a 
ministerial edict on January 23, 1998. Within 
about a week, all of the factory owners of Las 
Mercedes accepted the code in an open letter 
to the labour minister: “We have decided of 
our own accord to comply with the ministe- 
rial edict because we think it will improve and 
harmonize relations between employers and 
employees.” 
Working conditions slowly began to get 
better. A survey carried out in January 1999 
by the Maria Elena Cuadro M ovement sho- 
wed that since the code was adopted most 
workers (95 per cent of the 2,562 women 
polled) had not been victims of the kind of 
mistreatment common up until then. The 
survey also found that factories began ope- 
ning creches and food areas where workers 
could eat meals brought from home or 
bought from vendors. But the workers also 
said there was a long way to go before they 
had social security, decent wages and good 
factory hygiene. T he average monthly wage 
was less than $100, far below the estimated

cost of a family’s basic needs of around $150 
a month. 
“Regulation of foreign investment in 
Nicaragua is inadequate,” says Ramos. Bac- 
ked by women MPs, her movement is now 
pushing for parliament to reform the laws 
governing the free trade zone.“The code of 
conduct was a first step,” she says,“but it’s 
only a means to an end.” 
The whole matter is a tricky one, howe- 
ver, and demands caution. Ramos says inter- 
national consumer campaigns to press for 
codes of ethics can be risky. Pressure applied 
the wrong way could lead to closure of the 
factories and the loss of local jobs. 
‘Clean’ clothes 
“At international level, some people are 
campaigning with good will, but others are see- 
king to advance their own national interests 
through these campaigns.” The Nicaraguan acti- 
vists are against, for example, boycotting Central 
America’s free trade zones. They are also oppo- 
sed to the idea that consumers in rich countries 
should only buy locally-made goods. Trade 
unions in the United States in particular have 
promoted this approach, which Ramos rejects 
as nationalistic. On the other hand, “We think 
the campaign in Europe for ‘clean’ clothing pro- 
ducts, which doesn’t talk about a boycott but 
about improving working conditions, is more 
effective,” she says of campaigns like that of 
Oxfam (see article page 37). 
“What we ask campaigners in rich coun- 
tries to do is negotiate directly with the big 
textile firms there so they respect workers’ 
rights in their factories in poor countries and 
later to organize an independent inspection to 
check whether the factory owners are kee- 
ping their word. 
“Anyway,” says Ramos, “the code of 
conduct isn’t something invented in the North. 
It was thought up by women of the South. We 
haven’t copied any foreign model.” u

trade zones, where they are exempt from taxes and

### 117913: Move over Milan, Manila is taking over the catwalk

MOVE OVER MILAN, MANILA 
|S TAKING THE CATWALK 
  
+ Allen T. Cheng 
Reviving a piece of fashion heritage, a Filipino housewife creates an alternative 
sense of style 
Until the late 1980s Patis Tesoro was a 
housewife and part-time fashion desi- 
gner who enjoyed an upper-middle class 
life in the exclusive neighbourhoods of San 
Juan, a town on the outskirts of Manila. 
Occasionally, she would tailor-make an out- 
fit for people in her rich circle of friends,and 
it would bring enough money to buy the 
expensive ornaments with which she deco- 
rates her spacious home. 
But in the aftermath of nation-building 
that followed the 1986 overthrow of Presi- 
dent Ferdinand Marcos, Tesoro found her 
true calling as a social activist, entrepreneur, 
and leader in development economics. Seeing 
that ethnic wear was a part of Philippine 
identity that was dying out as the result of an 
# Hong Kong-based journalist 
invasion of polyester and cotton goods based 
on Western design, Tesoro set out to save 
one humble piece of heritage:pifia, a hand- 
woven fibre derived from the pineapple leaf, 
the mainstay of the traditional ethnic dress 
called the barong. (See box on facing page). 
Turning over a new leaf 
More than a decade later, her designs are 
de rigueur for Philippine high society. Along 
the way to success, Tesoro almost single-han- 
dedly helped create thousands of jobs for 
peasants and weavers throughout the Philip- 
pines. In a country whose per capita GDP is 
roughly $880 a year, pifia weavers can now 
earn as much as $200 or $300 a month. Such 
an income makes it much more likely that 
women will stay in the villages and weave 
pina rather than go abroad to be domestic 
servants, who earn salaries ranging from $300 
to $400 a month. Though Tesoro had a lot of 
help from others, she used no capital except 
her own pocket money and grants totalling no 
more than a few million pesos!. Her story is 
that of raw determination, strategic lobbying 
of the right government officials, and smart 
marketing at home and abroad. It is also a tale 
of how the developing world can transform 
tradition into business that creates wealth 
and shores up cultural identity. 
For developing nations, the potential 
economic rewards alone of building fashion 
design and retailing capabilities are enor- 
mous. Currently the South is the hub of tex- 
tile and clothes manufacturing, Asia being the 
biggest producer (garments account for 45 
1.1US$ = around 40 pesos.

per cent of Hong Kong’s exports) with Latin 
America now emerging as a player. 
But these are largely “low-end” opera- 
tions where the gross profit margins are 
fairly small—perhaps only 10 per cent. The 
big margins, as much as 200 per cent, go to 
designers and retailers, predominantly Wes- 
tern. Ironically in recent years many Western 
fashion houses have turned to ethnic themes 
from Africa, Latin America and Asia for 
creative inspiration. In the middle of this 
supply chain, trading houses that source 
from manufacturers and sell to retailers 
enjoy margins of 20-30 per cent. 
If the developing world has thus far been 
relegated to a sweatshop role, things may be 
changing in Asia as the region’s economies get 
back on track following the 1997 financial 
crisis, and as indigenous designers discover 
their abilities.

THE SECOND LIFE 
OF A 400-YEAR- 
OLD TRADITION 
rought by the Spanish galleons to the Phi- 
lippines in the 1580s, the pineapple soon 
became a major crop in the isles. The variety that 
prospered then bore a fibrous fruit with leaves 
that grew up to two metres, three times longer 
than the leaves of today’s edible variety. 
Natives took those leaves and stripped them 
down to fibres, which they spun into threads to 
make a shimmering, soft fabric, softer than the 
softest hemp, yet with more texture than silk. By 
the 1600s, pifia and abaca—a fabric made from 
the fibres of a plant related to the banana— 
became the major exports of the Philippines. 
Natives traded pifia and abaca with merchants 
from the Middle East, Malaysia, China and India. 
“It was what everyone wore—pifia and abaca,” 
says Patis Tesoro. It wasn’t until the 1700s that 
locals began importing cotton from England. 
The pina plant couldn’t compete with impor- 
ted cotton or silk, both of which were mass pro- 
duced in Europe and in China. Despite that, pifia 
and abaca were what many rural Filipinos conti- 
nued to wear well into this century. The process 
of weaving these fibres was far more cumber- 
some than cotton or silk, both of which can be 
spun into very long threads by machines. The 
pia fabric had to be hand-woven because its 
fibres were never more than two metres in 
length and were hard to attach to each other. 
As a result, pina fabric was far more expen- 
sive to weave than either cotton or silk. Because 
of its higher price, pifia became the fabric of 
choice of Filipino noblemen. “It used to be that if 
you wore a pifia barong, you'd really made it,”

emerging, as good as anywhere in the 
world,” says Professor Edward Newton, 
chairman of Hong Kong’s Institute of Tex- 
tiles and Clothing, Asia’s biggest such 
research centre and think tank. 
But to realize potential a lot of artistic 
creativity is needed, as well as a sense of 
what sells, gumption, risk-taking and a vision. 
“I always felt that we Filipinos were loo- 
king for an identity,” says Tesoro at a coffee 
shop she’s built adjacent to her museum-like 
studio, which is filled with rolls of traditional 
fabrics and tropical spices. “What we needed 
to do was to get back to our roots. We were 
losing our identity. We were being overw- 
helmed by Western civilization.” 
Ethnic roots 
Tesoro’s story begins in the late 1980s. 
In the euphoria after the downfall of the 
Marcos regime, Tesoro and her close friends 
began a process of soul searching. Many 
wanted to do something to contribute to 
the new republic and decided to look at their 
ethnic roots: a complex history of ethnic tri- 
bal traditions, flavoured by Spanish and 
American colonialism. 
Along with two other well-connected 
wealthy friends, Tesoro, now 48 and a 
mother of four, opened the Padrones de 
Casa Manila, a museum that celebrates 
more than 300 years of Philippine history. 
It was then that Tesoro came to realize that 
many traditional industries were dead or 
dying during years of neglect under Marcos. 
Among them was what once was the pride 
and joy of the Philippines: natural fibres. 
Tesoro was particularly intrigued by pifia 
cloth, which by that time was nearly impos- 
sible to find. 
When Tesoro went in 1986 to the 
Visayas, a set of islands where pifia still grew 
wild, she found only a handful of part-time 
weavers—most of them women in their late 
70s or 80s. Clearly pifia was going to die 
with these women,says Tesoro, who began 
lobbying local officials to set up courses to 
train the next generation of weavers. It took 
Tesoro nearly two years of lobbying officials 
before they took any action. 
It was finally only by contacting Victor 
Ordofiez, Under Secretary of Education,and 
Carlos Dominguez, Secretary of Agriculture, 
that Tesoro was able to convince the govern- 
ment to take action. In 1988, Tesoro and 
the Aklan State College of Agriculture in

Samples of pifia material. 
 
the Visayas began a series of courses on pifia 
weaving. It took another year of lobbying 
government officials for Tesoro to convince 
the government to put up more funding to 
train local farmers to begin cultivating pifia 
again. “It was not easy,” says Tesoro. 
Re-establishing the pifa trade was even 
more difficult. She recalls the first meeting she 
held with former growers, weavers, leaf strip- 
pers and traders. She asked why they stopped 
selling pifia. “There was a shouting match,” 
says Tesoro. “People blamed each other and 
the middlemen. What it came down to was the 
price of pifia was just too low. There wasn’t 
nearly enough a profit margin for the industry. 
People would rather go overseas to be 
domestic helpers than be weavers.” 
Status symbol 
By now, the government’s Fiber 
Industry and Development Association was 
on her side. Together they began setting up 
a distribution channel for the pifia. In turn, 
she promised the growers and weavers that 
she would buy their supply and also help 
promote their fabrics nationally by inte- 
grating them into her fashion designs. In 
fact, it was Tesoro who continually was 
willing to pay a higher price for pifia at the 
beginning. By marketing her pia barongs to 
her rich friends, Tesoro was able to influence 
how the elites of Manila dressed. 
Tesoro’s clients list today reads like a 
Who’sWho of the Philippines: Cory Aquino 
and her daughters,former President Fidel 
Ramos and his wife, President Estrada and 
his wife, and almost every major business 
tycoon in the country. “It is now a status 
symbol again,” claims Tesoro, whose outfits 
sell for as much as $1,000 each. 
In fact, it was by enlisting the help of 
former first lady Amelita Ramos that Tesoro 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
was not only able to get more funding grants 
to train both growers and weavers but also 
spread the gospel about the importance of 
pina as a fabric among Philippine elites. Toge- 
ther, Tesoro, the former first lady, and a few 
others, founded the Katutubong Pilipino 
Foundation, which is dedicated to the revival 
of traditional Philippine arts, crafts and culture. 
Today, Tesoro is no longer the only 
buyer of pifia. Many younger Filipino desi- 
gners are turning to it. In fact, the pifia 
industry today employs more than 2,500 
people in the state of Aklan alone, which 
produced 80,000 metres of pifia fabric in 
1998, up from a mere 3,000 metres a year 
back in 1986. Aklan is the centre of the 
pifia industry in the Philippines. Here,more 
than 80 per cent of the country’s pifia pro- 
ducts are produced. The industry’s annual 
turnover is roughly US$1 million a year. 
Much of the Philippine’s pifia exports 
FASHION TIPS 
FROM THE 
PHILIPPINES 
Fr those wishing to launch a fashion busi- 
ness, using their own funds or other sources 
of investment, Tesoro has this advice: 
1. Identify partners in government and local com- 
munities who can be won over to your cause. 
2. Learn about the community you will rely on. 
3. Make all partners see that the project will raise 
living standards and benefit the country and its 
culture. 
4. Selling to big fashion housesisn’t that difficult 
because they are always looking for new ideas, 
innovative products and materials. But ensuring 
adequate supplies is a challenge. [| 
  
    
began after the Paris Fair of May 1997, when 
Tesoro and then first lady Ramos put on a 
major show to promote traditional Philip- 
pine fibres to the world’s top fashion houses. 
That show was the re-introduction of pifia to 
the world. New York-based Filipino-Ame- 
rican designer Josie Natori is now experi- 
menting with pifia, for instance. More may be 
on the way. The Japanese textile group, 
Kanebo, for instance, is experimenting for 
the first time with the mass manufacturing of 
pifia by mixing its fibres with others. 
Newton shares the view that many deve- 
loping nations will explode on to the world 
fashion scene. He is particularly optimistic 
about India and China, which have the market 
girth to produce influential fashion culture 
and may some day rival the West. Besides 
Tokyo, he sees the emergence of Hong Kong 
and Shanghai as possible rivals to Milan, 
Parisand London in the next decade or two. 
Hong Kong already plays the pivotal 
role as the sourcing centre for the entire gar- 
ment industry and is also beginning to pro- 
duce some top fashion design talent. Shan- 
ghai will rise, supported by its growing 
middle class, which demands not just Wes- 
tern brands but Chinese ones as well. 
Indeed, in China today Jeans West is already 
a leading domestically-produced blue jean. 
Unique products 
“Some day, ‘Made in China or Hong 
Kong’ will become a status symbol,” says 
Newton. 
Smaller countries such as the Philippines 
will have fewer chances of producing name 
brands because the home markets in most ins- 
tances are just too small to give them global 
presence. T here, says Newton, designers 
should focus on niche design and products. “If 
you don’t have uniqueness, then you have to 
be competitive in making cheap garments 
like any other developing country in the 
world,” he says. 
Finding the right designs however is a 
huge challenge. Newton believes talented 
young designers would do well to study 
fashion in the West, as did Japan’s Kenzo 
(Paris) and Josie Natori (New York). 
However, Tesoro’s example suggests 
breakthroughs are possible by looking inward. 
She now hopes to professionalize the Philip- 
pines’ natural fibre industry so that future 
designers will have more ingredients to use in 
their ethnic designs. u

CONNEXIONS 
The divide between the Internet and television is fading fast. How will television survive 
this whirlwind of convergence? 
Does the future of television lie in the 
Internet, as many people in the global 
audiovisual industry believe? 
Television has ruled the media roost 
during the second half of this century. But 
is the familiar TV set, watched passively 
from a distance by lolling couch potatoes, 
now destined to be dethroned by the 
interactive computer, operated by users 
working inches from the screen? Or will 
TV and computer combine to spawn a 
new generation of hybrid products and 
audiovisual services, resembling neither 
the TV set nor the computer as we know 
them? 
Imagine for example a screen full of 
images you could activate any time you 
liked. If you were watching the film 
Titanic, you would use an infra-red remo- 
te control to click, like a computer mouse, 
on the face of Leonard DiCaprio to fetch 
a biography of him from the Web or send 
him an e-mail. You would click on his 
shoes to buy a pair of the same kind or 
even click on the wreck of the famous 
ship to download, for a price,other videos 
about it. 
Conglomerates 
locked in battle 
We're not there yet. Indeed, any pre- 
dictions must be offered with a grain of 
salt. After all, is anyone clever enough to 
predict exactly what the tumultuous affair 
between the Internet and television will 
give birth to? However, crystal balls aren’t 
needed to see the increasingly fuzzy line 
between television and the computer. 
After sizing each other up as rivals, the

Digital technology makes it possible to transmit a video via the Internet. 
worlds of computers and the audiovisual 
media have realized they need each other 
and can gain from technological “conver- 
gence”. With the digital revolution, any 
text, drawing, sound or picture can be 
turned into standard computer format 
and used either on the Internet or on tele- 
vision (as it goes digital). 
This has set off major shifts in a new 
industry arising at the crossroads between 
audiovisual services, computers and tele- 
communications. A major battle is raging 
between two giant conglomerates On one 
side 1s the world’s biggest Internet service 
provider, America Online (AOL), which 
has joined forces with Philips and 
DirecTV, the leading U.S. satellite digital 
television operator, in a bid to win the 
race to capture the next century’s custo- 
mers. On the other side, AT &T, the worl- 
d’s biggest telecommunications firm and 
the main U.S. cable operator (which also 
provides high-speed Internet access) has 
teamed up with Microsoft,which is trying 
to impose its software on the Internet net- 
works and in the new decoders used by 
digital TV sets. 
Many factors are pushing the two 
worlds of the Internet and television 
towards each other. The Net is drawing 
away more and more viewers from TV 
and threatening its revenue from adverti- 
sing. Recent surveys in the U.S. show 
television viewing (which averages four 
hours a day compared with three in 
Europe) has dropped since the under-30s 
have plugged in to the Web. The trend is 
expected to accelerate as more young 
Americans get high-speed Web access, 
which is currently only available in 
700,000 homes. 
The big guns of the Web—those who 
provide services and software—want to 
turn TV viewers into Netizens so they can 
expand their markets. The number of 
Internet users is tiny compared with the »

number of people who watch television. 
In rich countries, 95 per cent of the popu- 
lation watch television, but only 20-35 per 
cent of families have computers, which 
still scare a lot of people because they are 
complicated to use and are still associated 
mostly with the workplace. 
Cyberspace 
in the salon 
So at the dawn of the 21st century, 
sound, video images and television pro- 
grammes are proliferating on the Web. 
Meanwhile, as television becomes digital, 
it 1s starting to offer interactive facilities 
and access to the Internet. 
Since WebTV was launched in the 
United States in 1996 and purchased by 
Microsoft the following year, the race has 
been on to provide television viewers with 
access to the Net via their TV screens. T his 
facility is currently being offered through 
boxes linking the TV set to a telephone 
line. As digital TV spreads, super-decoders 
will give future viewers access—through 
cable, satellite or radio—to a profusion of 
channels (many of them paying) as well as 
to the Web and other interactive digitally- 
provided services, such as personalized 
weather forecasts and news services, data- 
banks which can provide in-depth material 
about TV programmes, shopping centres 
and home banking. Recent surveys suggest 
that there will be 61 million decoders ope- 
rating in the world by 2003. 
There seems to be a growing consensus 
that the Net will not become a really wides- 
pread medium until it reaches people’s 
homes through the TV set. A recent survey 
in Britain showed that 70 per cent of people

chance this will happen in developing coun-

There seems to be a growing 
consensus that the Net will 
not become a really 
widespread medium until 
it reaches people’s homes 
through the TV set 
which allows TV viewers to access the Net. 
In Britain, the majority of the population is 
expected to take up digital television within 
a matter of years. Chris Smith, the Culture 
Secretary, said last September he wanted 
the new technology to bring the Internet 
into every home. 
With Internet heading into the home, 
electronic commerce is set to take off— 
which just happens to be one of the aims of 
the technological convergence. The viewer, 
for example, will see an advertising banner 
at the top of the screen announcing a bar- 
gain price for, say, a pair of jeans. It will take 
just a click of the remote-control to get to 
the maker’s website and order a pair. 
The Net providers are also using this 
same method to offer TV viewers an endless 
range of online services—information,trai- 
ning and entertainment. Far from killing off 
TV in years to come, Internet will actually 
give it a second wind by drawing it further 
(than cable or satellite) into the age of diver- 
sity and abundance. 
At the same time as the Net goes on 
television, television will stake new terri- 
tory on the Net by offering access to exis- 
ting TV channels and new “webchannels” 
set up specially for it. 
TV programmes 
live on the Net 
This expected boom in TV on the 
Internet is a bit surprising in view of the 
very poor quality of the images. At present, 
putting a video film online is a bit like 
trying to get a camel through the eye of a 
needle. The feed down a telephone line is 
far too slow and irregular. Reception qua- 
lity varies according to the bandwidth and 
the number of people connected. The 
images come through at the rate of four or 
five a second (five times slower than a nor- 
mal television transmission), the size of the 
picture is no more than 25 cm?2, and line 
congestion causes frequent sudden breaks

smallest to the major networks, know that 
over the next decade big innovations will 
transform the scene, with greater speed, 
3D images, full-screen pictures and other 
improvements. 
According to the managers of 
Comfm, a French Web portal (gateway 
site) which provides access to radio and 
TV stations around the world, in mid- 
1999 over 100 TV stations were transmit- 
ting their programmes round the clock 
live on the Net. Hundreds of other gene- 
ral and specialist channels offer audiovi- 
sual archives, either free or paying. 
By broadcasting television on the Net, 
you can reach a global audience much more 
cheaply than by cable or satellite. Also, in an 
increasingly competitive environment due 
to the skyrocketing supply of programmes 
on offer, TV stations plan on using the Web 
to make themselves more attractive. For 
example a “webviewer”, during a football 
match, can look up biographies of the 
players or the history of the teams by clic- 
king on a banner which runs across the 
screen. A viewer can also plunge deeper 
into a subject while the TV news is on by 
delving into the Web to get extra informa- 
tion and video material which is available on 
demand. It remains to be seen, however, 
whether this mass of material will overw- 
helm the average viewer. 
Online TV stations, despite their cur- 
rent hesitations, also dream of becoming 
successful Web portals. The programmes 
would draw in consumers and then steer 
them towards virtual shopping centres. 
They would sell not just videocassettes, 
games and CDs but all kinds of other 
items, from clothes to cheese. 
Several of the big networks are also 
hoping to win back on the Web some of the 
viewers they are losing to new stations and 
to the Net. The major networks are busy 
setting up websites which complement 
their television programmes without com- 
peting with them. The giant U.S. network, 
ABC, has launched the first-ever live inter- 
active “web-only” news programme. It 
goes out on the Web in the middle of the 
day, at 12.30, to target a new audience of 
office-workers during their lunch-break. 
Special-interest 
TV channels 
An entirely new kind of TV, the web- 
channel, is also emerging in the shape of 
countless small stations operated by com- 
panies, political organizations and spe- 
cial-interest groups (medicine and 
cooking, for example). One big advantage 
they have is that production and broad- 
casting costs are negligible. Many of the 
people setting up such webchannels think 
mass television has a limited future. They 
are betting that audiences will become 
more and more fragmented just as they 
did with the growth in cable-and-satellite 
    CONNEXIONS 
delivered programmes. With digitaliza- 
tion, this fragmentation is expected to 
increase and give rise to television com- 
munities, with viewers tuning into thema- 
tic programming. While watching highly- 
specialized channels, webviewers can look 
up material about the topic being presen- 
ted or chat with other people connected 
to the site. 
More than 40 million people—about 
a quarter of all those online—already have 
software to access these sites and down- 
load sound and video from them onto 
their computers. The world’s leading 
audiovisual portal, Broadcast.com 
(recently taken over by Yahoo!), gets half a 
million visitors every day. 
What about the future? As television 
and the Web converge, will the familiar old 
TV set disappear? It seems unlikely, since 
the two means of communication are dis- 
tinct—the Internet meets the needs of the 
individual, and television addresses a mass 
audience. They also have different publics— 
the active Net-user and the passive TV 
viewer. So we can be fairly sure TV will 
stay T'V, whatever kind of screen we shall use 
to watch it. There will always be people 
who want to lap up the programmes offered 
on their favourite channel. Mass TV will 
always have a role in broadcasting major 
events which bring a mass audience toge- 
ther,such as the funeral of Princess Diana 
or the World Cup football final. nu 
How much longer can the couch potato survive?

### IGNORE

- 
TALKING TO... 


### 117915: Antonio Tabucchi: a committed doubter

ANTONIO TABUCCHI: 
A COMMITTED DOUBTER 
An Italian novelist jolts the forces of complacency in the world of fact as well as fiction 
The central figure in your best-known novel, 
Pereira Declares, A Testimony, is an 
ageing and lonely widower who is in charge 
of the cultural pages of a newspaper. 
Why did you choose an anti-hero as your 
main character? 
I’ve always been drawn to tormented 
people full of contradictions. The more 
doubts they have the better. People with 
lots of doubts sometimes find life more 
oppressive and exhausting than others, 
but they're more energetic—they aren’t 
robots. I prefer insomnia to anaesthesia. | 
don’t go for people who lead full and 
satisfying lives. In my books, I'm not on 
the side of the authorities. I'm with those 
who’ve suffered. My first novel, Piazza 
d’Italia, was an attempt to write history 
that hasn’t been written, history as writ- 
ten by the losing side, in this case the 
Tuscan anarchists. My books are about 
losers, about people who've lost their way 
and are engaged in a search. 
What are they looking for? 
They're looking for themselves through 
others, because I think that’s the best way 
to look for oneself. The main character in 
Indian Nocturne, who retraces the steps of 
a friend who’s disappeared in India, is invol- 
ved in such a quest. And so is Spino, the 
character in The Edge of the Horizon who 
tries to find out the identity of an unknown 
corpse.l don’t know whether these people 
are going to find themselves, but as they live 
their lives they have no choice but to face 
up to the image others have of them. They're 
forced to look at themselves in a mirror,and 
they often manage to glimpse something of 
themselves. 
After the success of Pereira Declares with the 
Italian public, there was some talk of your 
running for election to the Italian Senate. Do 
you regret ruling out that opportunity? 
No, I'm happy to go on living the life 
I’ve chosen. I'm a university teacher and 1 
like my job. Literature is my life of cour- 
se, but from an ontological point of view. 
From an existential point of view, I like 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - November 1999 
being a teacher. Literature for me isn’t a 
workaday job, but something which 
involves desires, dreams and fantasy. I 
don’t want to promote my own image 
either. I don’t like going on television or 
mixing in literary circles. I live quietly at 
home among my family and friends. 
Besides, there are politicians who do the 
job far better than I ever could. I think it’s 
more interesting to keep a sharp eye on 
politics. My job is to look at what politics 
is doing, not be a politician myself. 
Your latest novel, “The Lost Head of 
Damasceno Monteiro” (1997), is based on the 
story of a man who was murdered in a 
Republican National Guard police station on 
the outskirts of Lisbon and whose headless 
body was found in a park. Why did you use 
this real-life event? 
I was in Portugal when this shocking 
act occurred. I was deeply revolted. When 
a crime offends human nature, it offends 
us personally. You feel both horrified and 
guilty. My emotions, sensitivity and ima- 
gination as a writer were moved by this 
event. Look, I have here the documents 
drawn up by human rights investigators 
from the Council of Europe in Strasbourg 
who monitor conditions of detention in 
European countries. They talk about the 
relations between the police and citizens 
in police stations—places of detention to 
which you or I would be taken today if we 
broke some law or other in the street. 
If a politician’s job is to 
soothe people, to show that 
all’s well because of his or 
her presence, mine is to 
disturb people, to sow the 
seeds of doubt. The capacity 
to doubt is very important for 
human beings. For heaven’s 
sake, if we don’t have any 
doubts, we're finished! 
Did you use these documents when you were 
writing the novel? 
Yes, I wanted to know about the situation 
in Portugal, which is rather concerning.Rea- 
ding other reports made me realize things are 
the same nearly everywhere else in Europe, 
including in countries which seem more 
democratic. But democracy isn’t a state of 
perfection. It has to be improved, and that 
means constant vigilance. I thought I had to go 
beyond the actual event and talk about it 
through a novel—to give fictional treatment 
to this violent occurrence. In a novel, my fee- 
lings and sense of outrage can find a broader 
means of expression which would be more 
symbolic and applicable to many European 
countries. 
What was the Portuguese public's reaction 
to the book? 
I didn’t get many requests for interviews. 
People generally don’t go in for self-criticism, 
so I'm not surprised when a foreign writer is 
attacked for looking too closely at this kind of 
incident. But when Sergeant José dos Santos, 
the killer, finally confessed to his crime and 
was sentenced to 17 years in jail, the Portu- 
guese press asked me how I'd been able to pre- 
dict the outcome of the trial in my novel, as if 
I was a fortune-teller. I was in Istanbul at the 
time, and when I got back to my hotel I found 
newspapers had faxed me lists of questions. 
But I don’t think I have any particular talent 
for prediction, because when you have three 
or four elements in hand, you don’t have to be 
a genius to reach certain conclusions. Fantasy 
and imagination are also a kind of intuitive 
knowledge which doesn’t have much to do 
with Wittgensteinian logic,! as I said in my 
book “Plato’s Gastritis”. But they are a form 
of knowledge, one involving suspicion and 
doubt. 
1. Ludwig Wittgenstein,Austrian-born British 
philosopher (Vienna 1889-Cambridge 1951), was 
one of the founders of modern analytic 
philosophy. “The limits of my language constitute 
the limits of my mind,” he wrote in his Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus. In “Plato’s Gastritis”, 
Tabucchi criticizes this logic, which he describes 
as “very sensible but very limited” because “it 
only allows us to talk of what is known”.

KEEPING HISOPTIONS OPEN 
  
ntonio Tabucchiis used to writing hisnovelson 
hot, empty July afternoonsin Lisbon, where he 
lives for six months of the year. But this summer, he 
had other thingson hismind. None of his colleagues 
in the International Parliament of Writers was able 
to go to East Timor to write about the referendum 
there in late August, a historic step in the Timorese 
people’sfight forindependence from Indonesia. He 
hesitated to go to thisisland 700 kilometres from 
Australia because he was afraid he wouldn't be able 
to get back in time to give key evidence in favour of 
a gypsy family in a court case in Florence. 
Thisisa typical situation in the 56-year-old wri- 
ter’slife. Tabucchi waits for things to happen and 
keeps all his options open. He knows that an encoun- 
ter with a book, a picture or a person can give a new 
twist to a person’slife. Hisown changed after he read 
on a train journey a poem called Tabacaria (“The 
Tobacconist’s”), by the Portuguese poet Fernando 
Pessoa (1888-1935). He went to study in Lisbon and 
developed a passion for the country which, he says, 
isnow part of his “genetic baggage”. 
With Maria José de Lancastre, he has translated 
much of Pessoa’s work into Italian and written a book 
of essays and a play about him. In 1992, he wrote a 
novel in Portuguese, Requiem: A Hallucination, which 
a friend later translated into Italian for him. Tabuc- 
chiismarried to a native of Lisbon and has a daugh- 
ter “who is more Portuguese than Italian and a son 
who ismore Italian than Portuguese”. 
He wasborn in Vecchiano, a village not far from 
Pisa, in Tuscany. Nearby is the University of Siena, 
where he teaches literature six months of the year. 
The subject of his next course will be the Brazilian 
poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade (1902-87), 
whom he got to know in Rio de Janeiro. 
Tabucchi writes a column for the Italian news- 
paper Corriere della Sera and for Spain’s H Pais. 
Among his various awards are France’s Medicis 
Prize for the best foreign novel in 1987, Europe’s 
Jean Monnet Prize in 1994 and the Nossack Prize 
from the Leibniz Academy in 1999. 
In the 1995 Italian parliamentary election cam- 
paign, the hero of his novel Pereira Declares 
became the symbol of left-wing opposition to com- 
munications magnate Silvio Berlusconi. Many 
people identified with the Portuguese journalist 
who, in 1938 during the Salazar dictatorship, com- 
mitted a bold act of rebellion. Today Tabucchi is 
known first and foremost as “the author of Pereira”. 
  
( ol 
TALKING TO... 
This book continues your debate with the 
Italian semiologist and writer Umberto Eco. 
What's the root of your disagreement with 
him? 
Eco sees the intellectual as an organizer 
of culture, someone who can run a maga- 
zine or a museum. An administrator, in 
fact. I think this is a melancholy situation 
for an intellectual. I claim the right to take 
a stand once in a while. When something 
strange happens in the world or in your 
home, you have to look into it to see if you 
can pin it down, work it out, talk about it 
and sound the alarm: “Look out! This is 
happening in my home, in my town, in the 
world, which is also my home.” On the 
other hand, an intellectual would be totally 
witless if he said: “Something terrible is 
happening in my home but I can’t get 
interested in it because I'm putting toge- 
ther a catalogue for an exhibition of pain- 
tings in my local museum.” 
So what do you think an intellectual should be 
doing? 
If a politician’s job is to soothe people, 
to show that all’s well because of his or 
her presence, mine is to disturb people,to 
sow the seeds of doubt. The capacity to 
doubt is very important for human 
beings. For heaven’s sake,if we don’t have 
any doubts, we’re finished! An intellectual 
is going to have doubts, for example, 
about a fundamentalist religious doctrine 
that admits no doubt, about an imposed 
political system that allows no doubt, 
about a perfect aesthetic that has no room 
for doubt. Doubts are like stains on a 
shirt. I like shirts with stains, because 
when I'm given a shirt that’s too clean, 
one that’s completely white, I immediate- 
ly start having doubts. It’s the job of intel- 
lectuals and writers to cast doubt on per- 
fection. Perfection spawns doctrines, 
dictators and totalitarian ideas. 
Are you absolutely certain about this? 
There are some fundamental values 
it’s impossible to be wrong about. 
Nobody can disagree with the saying “do 
not do unto others what you would not 
have done unto yourself”. That’s some- 
thing basic, that’s part of human nature. I 
don’t have any doubts either about the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Perhaps some more should be added to 
the list, but I don’t have the slightest 
doubt about human rights. 
Doubts begin when political action is taken. 
For example, was it right or wrong to underta- 
ke military intervention in Kosovo to stop 
human rights violations?

gypsies to move on. 
 
Yes of course. But remember that 
during the Kosovo war, writers could 
express themselves freely, which I think 
was a very good thing. Many members of 
the International Parliament of Writers 
(IPW) did so because we set up a network 
of newspapers, including Libération 
(France), El Pais (Spain) and Corriere 
della Sera (Italy). Every day, a writer 
spoke up. There were many conflicting 
viewpoints, but I think writers’ opinions 
were expressed with great freedom during 
the war. Who were the only people who 
didn’t have any doubts at the time? 
Politicians and the military. But writers 
expressed one doubt after another. An

pletely different from and contradictory

re. | think this is very important. 
But politicians also have to make decisions. 
There comes a moment when doubts have to 
be left behind. 
Yes, but I still prefer politicians who lis- 
ten to the doubts of others and start having 
a few doubts themselves. It’s very useful 
when politicians have doubts because there 
are so many choices to be made in the 
world. Unfortunately politicians in Europe 
these days are more concerned with figures 
and accounts than with principles. They're 
like Eco’s intellectuals: political adminis- 
trators and bureaucrats. 
One of the most worrying kinds of violence in 
Europe nowadays is rooted in xenophobia. 
What do you think about that? 
Xenophobic violence is the most 
serious conflict in Europe today, one 
which I think it’s imperative for intellec- 
tuals and writers to oppose in word and 
deed. It has broken out in many coun- 
tries, for economic and social reasons like 
unemployment and clandestine migra- 
tion. But we have to make a distinction 
between skinheads, for example, who are 
simply the embodiment of brute force, 
and people whose speeches and writings 
provide theoretical backing for racial 
hatred and attacks on minorities. This is 
being done openly, with virtual impunity. 
In June 1999, Italy’s third-biggest news- 
paper, Giomale della Toscana, printed an 
article entitled “Florence, the capital, but 
the capital of gypsies”—note the use of 
the word “but”. In it, a columnist sneered 
at seminars on gypsy culture that had 
been organized by the Maichelucci 
Foundation, of Fiesole, near Florence. 
Fifty years after half a million gypsies 
were exterminated in the Second World 
War—thousands of them in Auschwitz— 
we're again preparing the mass killing of 
this minority. 
Why are gypsies so often the target of this 
kind of violence? 
Xenophobia manifests itself especially 
against civilizations and cultures that are 
weak because they lack economic 
resources, means of subsistence or land. So 
nomadic people are the first targets of this 
kind of aggression. Sometimes it isn’t phy- 
sical violence but violence in the form of 
intolerable, subhuman living conditions 
Xenophobic violence 
is the most serious conflict 
in Europe today, one which 
| think it’s imperative 
for intellectuals and writers 
to oppose in word and deed 
like those the gypsies on the outskirts of 
Florence have to put up with. I’ve critici- 
zed this situation in a report that was 
recently published in Italy’. Many gypsies 
have fled their own countries and are 
nomads by necessity after escaping from 
the war in Yugoslavia. A society which 
considers itself civilized can’t treat people 
like that. It’s contrary to the notion of 
culture and hospitality, to the very spirit of 
our civilization, which originates in 
Ancient Greece and European humanism. 
What did you mean when you titled one of 
your articles “I am an Albanian”? 
The salt of any interesting civilization 
is mixture.A civilization that’s closed and 
inward-looking is sterile. Civilizations 
that are worthy of attention have mana- 
ged to incorporate a variety of ingredients 
and elements. As a writer, I've always 
been interested in others. The most 
important basis of any novel is wanting to 
be someone else, and this means creating 
a character. We all want to be someone 
else but without ceasing to be ourselves. | 
think it’s very important to defend this

TALKING TO... 
© idea in real life too. 
| What has had the greatest influence on your 
political life? 
It’s hard to say. Perhaps the story of 
my country, my childhood, my grandfa- 
ther, the First World War. My interest in 
human rights originates in anti-war fee- 
lings that go back to my childhood. I was 
born in the Second World War during the 
Nazi invasion of my country. I vividly 
remember the stories my grandfather told 
me about the carnage of the First World 
War, which people tend to forget was one 
of the worst massacres in human history. 
So this antipathy to violence goes back to 
my childhood, to my grandfather and to 
the anarcho-libertarian and republican 
tradition of my native Tuscany. 
You're one of the founders of the International 
Parliament of Writers. How did it get started? 
Three hundred intellectuals from 
around the world, including Toni 
Morrison, Giinter Grass and Octavio Paz, 
founded it in 1993 after the murder of the 
Algerian writer and poet Tahar Djaout. 
| The idea was to set up an organization to 
protect, almost physically, writers and 
intellectuals threatened with death, perse- 
cuted or imprisoned in their countries. A 
year later, we set up a council of about 50 
members. Its first president was Salman 
Rushdie, who was unfortunately not just a 
symbol but a living target of such persecu- 
tion. Our current president is the Nigerian 
writer Wole Soyinka. We have a network of 
about 30 “refuge” cities which offer writers 
and their families a decent place to live and 
enough money to subsist and take part in 
the city’s cultural activities—its libraries, »

TALKING TO... 
on independence or autonomy. 
East Timorese lining up to cast ballots in the August 30, 1999 referendum 
schools and associations. 
Are any of these cities outside Europe? 
Yes, they exist in Brazil and Australia. 
Mexico City recently became a refuge- 
city, in line with a tradition going back to 
the 1920s and 1930s, when the Mexican 
capital took in many persecuted intellec- 
tuals from Europe. I went to Mexico City 
in March 1999 with the secretary-general 
of the IPW, the French writer Christian 
Salmon, to sign an agreement whereby 
the Mexican authorities provided a refuge 
for two writers, Vladimir Arsenijevic from 
Serbia and the Kosovar-Albanian writer 
Xhevdet Bajraj. Both of them now live in 
Casa Citlapletel, a house run by the 
Friends of the IPW association. 
Has any IPW action given you particular 
satisfaction? 
Everything it’s done has been useful. 
Our notion of a writer is a very broad one. 
It includes Shakespeare and a journalist 
working on a newspaper in a remote villa- 
ge in Afghanistan. But I'm very happy 
that Italy, whose only refuge-city so far is 
Venice, will soon have three more such 
towns in Tuscany—Grosseto, Pontedera 
and Certaldo. I'm very fond of Certaldo 
because it was the birthplace of 
Boccaccio, the great medieval Italian 
novelist. They're all quite small towns 
where writers can get together more easi- 
ly than in a big city. 
The IPW organized support for the August 
1999 self-determination referendum in East 
Timor. Why? 
When you have a foreign invasion—in 
this case by the Indonesian army—wri- 
ters, intellectuals, newspapers and maga- 
zines are the first targets of repression. 
Xanana Gusmao, the Timorese leader, is 
a poet and a journalist. In 1994, the [PW 
voiced support for the self-determination 
of the Timorese people in the name of 
fundamental principles of justice and civi- 
lization. More recently, we asked for the 
referendum to be held without fraud and 
without violence by the anti-independen- 
ce militias which are conniving with the 
Indonesian regime. I think the internatio- 
nal community, the United Nations, will 
have to insist and bring pressure to bear 
so a military power like Indonesia doesn’t 
crush the people of this little island. So I 
agree with Nobel Peace Prize winner José 
Ramos Horta when he says that if you call 
for troops to get out of Kosovo, you must 
also demand the withdrawal of 
Indonesian troops from East Timor, even 
though the public seems to think that a 
European country is more important than 
a tiny island in the Indian Ocean. People 
have a right to live, even on an island 
which seems insignificant to most people.
