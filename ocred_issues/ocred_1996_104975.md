FO E N CONT E BR § 
To our readers 
Since our regular “Encounters” feature first appeared, 
on the inside front cover of the July 1989 issue, your tal- 
ented and imaginative contributions have abundantly 
illustrated the range of the creative cross-fertiliza- 
tion that the feature is intended to encourage. 
The invitation we issued then is still open to all our 
readers: “Send us a photo (of a painting, a sculpture, 
or a piece of architecture) which you regard as a good 
example of cultural cross-fertilization. Alternatively, 
send us pictures of two works from different cultural 
backgrounds in which you see a striking connection 
or resemblance. Please send a short caption with your 
photos. Each month we will publish one of your 
contributions.” 
In anticipation of many more rewarding encounters.

An endless quest by Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat 
Readers of this issue may well be struck by a paradox: an obsession with 
the ephemeral has been a permanent feature of human history. | 
Death has always been there to remind us of the unchanging order of 
things: that whatever has a beginning must sooner or later come to an 
end. Whence the urge to look beyond temporary things and seek the 
eternal—through religion, philosophy, and art. Some cultures have been 
built on the aspiration to transcend time, to construct enduring 
monuments and give tangible shape to the absolute. The temples of 
ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome bear witness to this ambition, as do 
the cathedrals of Christianity and the mosques of Islam. 
; Animism, Hinduism and Buddhism have a diametrically opposite 
- approach. For them, acceptance of life’s impermanence is a way of 
bringing eternity into better focus. Mural paintings, ceremonial masks 
and mandalas have meaning only because the ephemeral is a pathway to 
the timeless. In a sense, therefore, an ancient temple and a sacred dance 
are two routes leading towards the same destination: achievement of 
the absolute via experience of the transitory. 
, Modernity has wrought a disturbing change in representations of the 
ephemeral. By shutting its eyes to transcendence, it consigns the 
! ; ephemeral to the void.

SWIMMING AGAINST THE TIDE 
BY EZI0O MANZINI 
aml lak tt 
esign is inseparable from its age. 
But its role may also be to break 
away from the spirit of the age and 
1 * heraldanew era. 
Two hundred years ago, the seemingly sta- 
tic pre-industrial world began to stir. Slowly 
at first, and then with growing speed, it 
embarked on an unstoppable quest for nov- 
elty. Right from the start, industrial design 
was one of the main driving forces behind this 
process of acceleration, for reasons that were 
both ethical (the new versus the old in the 
name of progress) and mercantile (the new 
replacing the old in the name of commerce). 
Design was both a product and a component 
of its time. How do things stand today? 
It is often said that acceleration and tran- 
sience are the defining features of our age. But 
today we wonder where all this speed is tak- 
ing us. Perhaps design should swim against 
the tide and contribute to this questioning. 
Perhaps it should promote profundity and 
duration in what seems to be an increasingly 
superficial and constantly changing world. In 
other words, perhaps design should emphasize 
the “solid side” of a changing world. 
Language pollution 
Freed from its inertia, matter lends itself to 
unlimited transformation. The physical world 
no longer seems to be a solid vehicle for per- 
manent meanings, but a constantly changing 
fluid. At the same time, progress in informa- 
tion technology and communications opens 
up a new dimension of human experience that 
is liberated not only from matter, but from 
the constraints of space and time. Even the 
certainties of memory are called into question 
by the greater possibilities of “fiction”, of 
juggling with information and images to cre-

ate a potentially infinite variety of “virtually 
real” pasts, presents and futures. 
These developments are both fascinating 
and disturbing. We cannot yet fully gauge their 
human and social implications. The only thing 
we can really be sure of is that the changes 
under way are of far-reaching importance. New 
cultural instruments must be created to con- A: Warhol-Robot

fronta phenomenon whose consequences will 
be mainly negative unless itis kept under con- 
trol. We can already see this today. What ought 
to be communication, and therefore exchange, 
has led to a new form of isolation, and what 
ought to be information has become no more 
than background noise. We discover that 
words and images are products that are “con- 
sumed” and produce rubbish that eventually 
pollutes our language. 
But matter that seemed to have dissolved in 
the ever-changing flow of information reap- 
pears elsewhere in our experience. The rubbish 
accumulated by our societies is matter that 
has again become dense and inert, trapped in its 
own heaviness and duration. It is used matter, 
stripped of its original meaning, that invades 
our space and our time as tangible evidence of 
the irreducible physicality of our environ- 
ment. We discover that the fluid world of 
information and “fiction” needs powerful 
stage machinery in order to function, that all 
this machinery consumes and is consumed, 
and that it all forms a huge entropic system 
which uses resources and creates waste. 
Nobody today would deny this obvious 
fact. We talk anxiously about “the environ- 
ment problem”, and ask ourselves questions 
about how to promote “sustainability”, in 
other words about how to put an end to the 
 
war that the human race has more or less 
unwittingly declared on its environment. We 
cast around for solutions. Some turn to an 
idealized past that will never return; others 
look just as naively to an increasingly tech- 
nological and dematerialized future. As we 
have just seen, in the current economic and 
cultural context, dematerialization is more 
than offset by the increase in consumer goods. 
The solution to the problem—the creation of 
a more harmonious relationship between 
humans and their environment—is not and 
cannot be purely technical. 
And so we move between two contrasting 
worlds: a virtual world without substance or 
history, and an environment in which cum- 
bersome and durable rubbish is accumulating. 
Living matter 
Of course it is very tempting to turn away 
from the problems of the environment and 
take refuge in the virtual world. But to do so 
is to forget that between the immaterial world 
of information and the world of “dead mat- 
ter”, or rubbish, there is a world of bodies, 
things and images which change in ways and at 
a pace determined by our innermost natureas 
human beings—biological beings who live in an 
ecosystem, and cultural beings who constantly 
try to make sense of things. And this world of »

» matter which is “living” in both a biological 
and a semiotic sense is a world which needs 
permanence as well as change, repetition as well 
as novelty, and solidity as well as fluidity. 
The world of living matter consists of 
change and permanence. It could be thought of 
as a fluid with a solid component. Today we 
should fix our attention on the solid compo- 
nent. It is being eroded by change, but it 
remains the basis of our search for meaning 
and by its very nature it curbs consumption 
and reduces waste (both physical and semi- 
otic). Itis here that we shall find the answer to 
the basic questions concerning our cultural 
future (the construction of meaning) and our 
existential future (the preservation of living 
conditions). 
Permanence in change 
In the past, the idea of solidity was based on 
the permanence of things, on a duration of 
forms and relationships which seemed intrin- 
sic to them (the inertia of matter and social 
conventions). Today that solid world, which 
was the basis of our models for interpreting 
reality, has ceased to exist.

It has been superseded by a fluid world, in 
which the permanence we so much need can no 
longer be taken for granted but must be 
acquired by a deliberate act of the will. “Solid- 
ity”, when it exists, is the result of a project. 
Some may feel that there is not much point 
in seeking solidity in a world fascinated by 
promises of immateriality. For myself I prefer 
to think that the best way to make sense of 
things is to rediscover and revalue their core of 
solidity. In doing this we should reject nos- 
talgia and naivety, and remember that the solid 
world of the past can now be no more than a 
memory. The kind of solidity (of products, 
relationships, ideas) that we can seek today is 
that of forms stabilized in a context of per- 
petual change. 
Since this solidity is no longer an intrinsic 
quality of things, it must be the result of a 
deliberate endeavour to define what must 
endure so that everything else can change with- 
out losing meaning and without destroying 
the planet. If it takes that course, design will 
belong to its time, and the meaning it acquires 
will help to shape the future. ||

morning dew on a leaf, the billowing 
“shapes of clouds, the dancing move-

of a young child—these all change quickly. They 
are not frozen in time. Why should art be 
frozen, be still? So much of our art here is made

The artist knows it, and the gods surely know 
it. The earth just for this moment is more beau- 
tiful because of it. What more is needed? It 
changes as we change, as the day changes, until 
again we make something of beauty.” 
These words, spoken many years ago by 
the famous Indian dancer Rukmini Devi, give 
insight into one of the fundaments of Indian 
creativity: the ephemeral. In India all existence 
is believed to bein constant transition. Every- 
thing is in a cyclical state of creation and

ate tnelr nouses with sacred wil 
destruction, of birth, death, and rebirth. There 
is no permanence—all is thought to be in bal- 
ance with its opposite. In a country where the 
present is layered and infused with untold 
generations of the past, history is viewed by 
most as irrelevant. 
Aside from the Indian concern for social 
and cultural traditions, the documentation and 
preservation of the ancient is primarily a West- 
ern invention. Even the most substantial of 
structures, temples and palaces built and carved 
of stone were deserted in the centuries before 
the modern era when their original purposes 
were no longer deemed pertinent. Tradition is 
important only as a means for coping with the 
present, not as a way to canonize the past. The 
maintenance of inherited traditions enables the 
observer to ensure balance and harmony in his 
or her life. 
Most traditional art is in some way tied to 
ritual. The central motivation of many Hindu 
rituals is darshan, literally translated as “view- 
ing” or “eye contact”. Darshan is that sacred 
moment in which the devotee experiences direct 
contact with the deity. In Hinduism, darshan 
is achieved through the spiritual presence of a 
god or goddess who is believed to manifest 
materially within a natural or man-made object. 
Divine spirit may be invoked to enter any puri- 
fied container—a sacred tree or rock, a sculpture 
of stone or bronze, or even, in some cases, the 
body of a priest or supplicant. To facilitate this 
process, both object and devotee must undergo 
preparation. 
An ornately carved sculpture that has been 
in worship for a thousand years will be 
adorned each day with fresh milk and butter, 
honey, sandal paste and ash and dressed anew 
in clean garments and strings of heady-scented 
blossoms. The store rooms and treasuries of 
major temples are filled with magnificent tex- 
tiles and jewellery in order to provide the 
appropriate change of appearance to fit each 
day. In this way even the most permanent of 
objects is inseparably tied to the transitory. 
Each time itis viewed, its presence is different.

### 104918: A Moment of grace

The very material of many sacred sculptures 
is ephemeral. The most basic of elements, clay, 
is considered sacred in India. Hindu legends 
abound with descriptions of the magical prop- 
erties of clay (mitts). From carth all creation is 
fashioned and to earth it eventually returns. 
Mittiis the body of the Mother Goddess, the 
Sustainer of Life. It is easily procured and 
sculpted and, when purified by fire or other 
sacred elements, it becomes an appropriate ves- 
sel for facilitating darshan with the gods. 
Once each year for special festivals in eastern 
India, potters apply clay to structures of straw 
and sticks to create large and elaborate sculp- 
tures of the gods that become the principal 
images in community shrines. On festival day 
all the sculptures are carried in procession to a 
nearby river and allowed to dissolve in the cur- 
rent. The deity has been honoured, the devotees 
have received their darshan, the god is requested 
to return to the heavens, and the sculptures no 
longer have any value. Ephemeral images of the 
Ey day of the year this 
woman paints a different 
design on the brick surface in 
front of her home in Tamil 
Nadu state, southern India. 
Usually the painting only lasts 
an hour or two before being 
erased underfoot. 
gods arecreated for specific festivals and rituals 
throughout India. 
Protection 
from evil spirits 
Most Indian society and ritual is centred on 
the home. The deity that protects the home 
and all of its inhabitants is generally viewed as 
feminine, most often the Goddess Lakshmi, 
who governs household activities and ensures 
the health and welfare of each family member. 
Her worship, usually conducted by women, 
is considered essential to the maintenance of 
harmony and prosperity. Throughout India 
women regularly paint their homes with dec- 
orative designs sacred to the goddess. They 
begin by covering the surface with a new layer 
of wet clay mixed with cow dung. Upon this 
“canvas”, they paint designs handed down 
from mother to daughter through countless 
generations. Almost all of them create asacred

celebrated by cooking new rice. 
» decoration at least once a year, but some paint 
anew one every single day! 
The style and form of decoration is gov- 
crned by the traditions of each subculture. In 
most areas the painting is applied to the front 
of the house on or around the main entrance. 
The door is considered the means of entry 
into the home for good and evil spirits as well 
as household members. Consequently, the 
front door must be protected with symbols 
auspicious to Lakshmi and prohibitive to 
negative energy. The women of some areas 
paint only their doors; others just the thresh- 
old; some paint the exterior walls facing the 
street; while elsewhere they paint the ground 
in front of the house. Each painting is a private 
invocation by a woman to her deity. Although 
often very beautiful, its artistic merit is usu- 
ally considered of secondary importance. Cer- 
tainly it would never be signed. Itis a form of 
personal communication, valuable only for 
the moment of its creation. After that, it is 
left to crumble or to be rubbed away, its full 
function complete. 
Exquisite rice-flour 
designs 
In the foothills of the Himalayas, women 
paint their homes only once or twice each year: 
for Deepavali, the annual festival honouring 
Lakshmi, and for special birthdays or wed- 
dings in the family. They usually use organic 
pigments such as rice flour for white, mineral 
ochre for yellow and rust for red, vermilion 
for bright red, and henna for green. The pow- | 
ders are applied directly to the ground for 
floor designs, or mixed with water to decorate 
windows and doors. 
They generally employ floral motifs sim- 
ilar to those that embellish their colourful 
shawls. In the extremely dry desert of western 
Rajasthan bordering Pakistan, the wives of 
camel and goat herders decorate their homes 
only once each year for Deepavali. They cover 
the entire front walls of their homes in bold 
geometric designs reminiscent of (but not 
influenced by) mid-twentieth century West- 
ern geometric abstraction. A village which for 
most of the year is barely distinguishable from 
the drab landscape of the surrounding desert 
is transformed into a powerful visual invoca- 
tion to the goddess on this important occa- 
sion. The colour will last only a few weeks 
until it is bleached out by the incessant sun. 
In contrast, the women living in the castern 
section of the same state repaint their homes 
often. They resurface their walls and floors with 
locally-mined red ochre for every important 
occasion (religious festivals and important fam- 
ily events, such as conception, birth, reaching

mmm, 
puberty, betrothal and marriage). They then 
cover both surfaces with decorations specific to 
the event using pigment made from white lime. 
Every single day of the year in more than 
a million houses in the south Indian state of 
Tamil Nadu women paint decorations on the 
ground outside their front doors. On regular 
days they userice flour or ground white stone 
powder applied to the dampened surface of 
dirt or pavement. Some first mark out a grid 
of dots which they connect in fluid designs, 
while others work entirely freehand. On fes- 
tival days or during auspicious months, bril- 
liant commercial coloured powders are used 
to fill in the complex patterns. 
The women pride themselves on never 
repeating a design and the streets are trans- 
formed into endless galleries of colourful 
artistry. Most paintings arc completed before 
sunrise, at which time the artist usually walks 
past her neighbours to compare their produc- 
tions and to gather inspiration for the follow- 
ing days’ paintings. Within an hour or two all 
the paintings arc gone—blown away or kicked 
into dust by the ongoing traffic of the day. 
In the eastern state of Orissa women grind 
parboiled rice into a paste which they apply to 
the mud walls of their houses using many dif- 
ferent techniques (by hand, rag and brush). 
Many festivals herald the repainting of walls; 
but the most important paintings are created

during the two months from mid-December 
until mid-February dedicated to the special 
worship of Lakshmi. Both walls and floors 
arc covered with exquisite floral and animal 
motifs on the most important day. 
Among other symbolic designs, a tempo- 
rary shrine is painted on the floor inside and 
a wooden altar set upon it. A terracotta pot 
filled with freshly harvested rice is then placed 
upon the altar. Encouraged by high-pitched 
ululations, the Goddess is invited to invest 
her spirit in the pot, thereby blessing the home 
and its inhabitants. At the moment when con- 
tact (darshan) with the deity is experienced 
by the women, the ceremony is complete, the 
Goddess is requested to leave, and the paint- 
ings no longer have any value. 
Throughout India women’s sacred paint- 
ings are personal expressions within a tradi- 
tional medium, the voice of the feminine in a 
male-dominated culture. They are a means of 
communication between the soul of a devotee 
and her duty, painted prayer which brings bal- 
ance to a woman's life and which creates a bond 
to other women throughout the subconti- 
nent. Communion with the Divine, as per- 
ceived in many Hindu rituals, is usually fleet- 
ing: both the work of art and the experience it 
produces are cphemeral. They create a moment 
of grace and harmony within a cosmos of con- 
stant change. [|

he ceremonial art of the northwest 
coast of North America has long 
inspired admiration. In the past, huge 
carved and painted totem poles, 
masks, head-dresses and rattles as well as carved 
or painted chests, boxes and bowls figured 
prominently in elaborate feasts and potlatches 
(ceremonial occasions on which gifts were dis- 
tributed to affirm social status), and continue 
to be important to contemporary northwest 
coast communities. 
Important aspects of this art are not per- 
manent or tangible, for while some objects 
exist for short periods of time and deterio-

rate, others are created and/or destroyed as 
part of ceremonial events. 
Even during their “lifetimes”, these cere- 
monial objects do not necessarily remain 
unchanged. Study of the paint on northwest 
coast masks has revealed that some of them 
have been repainted in dramatically different 
designs and colours since their creation. Some- 
times clements such as pieces of copper or 
abalone have been added to areas which origi- 
nally were only painted. 
Along with this evolution in the appearance, 
form and life of objects, there has always been an 
emphasis on producing new ones to replace 
those which have grown old. Part of every pot- 
latch has been the revelation of fine new masks 
and other objects commissioned by proud hosts 
to be presented for the admiration of their 
assembled guests. The concept of the mask or fig- 
ure remains permanent, but it is recreated and re- 
presented in the ceremonial context. 
The destruction of masks created for cere- 
monial purposes occurs in another context 
amongst the Heiltsuk of Bella Bella, British 
Columbia. It is their tradition to burn masks 
and other ceremonial objects representing the 
crests and privileges of a deceased person. In 
1990, following the memorial potlatch held 
to honour Hereditary Chief Wigvilba Wakas 
(Leslie Humchitt), masks and other objects 
created by Nuxalk artist Glenn Tallio (Chief 
Wakas’s son-in-law) were burned “as a gesture 
of love and respect”. 
Dance and theatre 
In 1967 I went to the Bella Coola Valley armed 
with photographs of masks, head-dresses and 
rattles known to have been part of Nuxalk 
winter ceremonies. The people were excited to 
see the photographs and loved to discuss them. 
The conversation usually focused upon who

had once owned and used the object in ques- 
tion, and when it had last been publicly dis- 
played in the community. 
In some households I was shown masks 
or other carvings. I was enthralled with these 
objects which were currently held in the com- 
munity. But frequently I detected some puz- 
zlepent on the part of my hosts as to why I 
was so interested in them. Comments like, 
“But you really ought to see it danced. . .” 
began to impress me, as I could sec that the 
Nuxalkmc were not as reverent towards these 
ceremonial objects as I was. The mostimpor- 
tant thing is not merely a carved mask or rat- 
tle, but the role it plays within the integrated 
ritual complex in which it is involved. 
Each part of a costume contributes to the 
creation of a particular personage or character 
and that character is unmistakably linked with 
a song and a dance. When a man brings out a 
carved and painted mask, and shows it proudly, 
he says “I dance that”. Little is said about the 
merits of the mask, while long descriptions of 
the dramatic movements of the masked dancer 
are readily offered. 
In fact, this art, while involving some very 
fine tangible elements, is essentially an 
ephemeral art of dance and theatre. This was 
apparent in seven Kwakwaka’wakw masked 
dances performed in March 1996, in the north- 
ern coastal community of Alert Bay. In prepa- 
ration for these dances, as much attention was 
paid to instructing the dancer in correct body 
movements and hand gestures as was lent to 
fitting on his mask and other costume items. 
These movements were presented in careful 
synchronization with particular drum beats, 
song passages and choruses provided by the 
accompanying singers. When the Grizzly Bear 
danced, the fierce mask worked in concert with 
the snarls, song and rhythmic drum beating 
that filled the air, and with the lumbering 
movements around the dance floor and the 
clawing gestures of the dancer. 
Living memory 
Part of the ephemeral nature of northwest coast 
ceremonial art is the vast historical knowledge 
and understanding that the creators and the 
witnesses of the art traditionally bring to their 
experience. Through the oral histories of the 
northwest coast peoples, the iconography of 
the objects and dramatic content of the art can 
be explained. Most figures represented in the 
plastic arts and events which are presented in 
dance or dramatic form are derived from the 
elaborate family histories of those involved. 
Through speeches, those witnessing the cere- 
mony are reminded of that history, and hence 
they are able to fully appreciate and understand 
what they are witnessing. 
Once objects are removed from the com- 
munity or are beyond living memory, their 
meaning may be lost. |

BY LUKE TAYLOR 
  
he religious life of the Aborigines of 
Central Australia focuses upon the 
activities of the original creator beings, 
who instituted the first ceremonies 
and produced the first sacred objects and 
designs used in them. Today, Aboriginal peo- 
ple say they “follow up” these ancestors in 
thetr own activities and care for the sites which 
contain their powerful essence. They hold cer- 
emonies to honour the creative activities of 
the original beings and to release a measure of 
ancestral power in order to maintain the 
world’s fertility. The production of art forms 
avery important part of these events. 
At various stages in the performances, cer- 
emonial leaders paint powerful graphic designs 
onthe dancers’ bodies in red and yellow ochre, 
white pipe clay and charcoal. Coloured bird 
down or vegetable fluff may be attached to add 
texture or fixed around an enveloping frame- 
work that temporarily transforms the dancer 
into a representation of the ancestral being. 
More elaborate designs, sometimes extend- 
ing over considerable distances, are made on the 
ceremontal ground. They may include sculp- 
tural elements such as mounds or hollows.

with sacred objects may be inserted into the 
ground at certain points. The designs depict 
schematically the features of landscape made 
by the ancestral beings, whom the dancers imi- 
tate as they make their way across them. 
The designs are destroyed during the cere- 
mony, having served their purpose of pro- 
viding a temporary bridge between the cre- 
ative past and the world of the Aborigines 
today. The aesthetic aim is not to construct a 
permanent monument but to produce a pow- 
erful effect, thus maintaining knowledge about 
the nature of the ancestral world and trans- 
mitting it to the younger generation. 
The motifs often consist of concentric cir- 
cles joined by parallel lines or incorporate 
other features such as animal tracks, arcs and 
straight lines often representing the shelters 
or tools used by the Ancestral beings. 
The concentric circles are symbolic of 
female generative power and the straight line 
joining motifs suggest male procreative power. 
The conjunction of these elements in a cere- 
monial context is considered by performers 
to release procreative energy and thus maintain 
the life cycle. |

ody painting and scarification are, 
like jewelry and costume, ways of 
covering, disguising and trans- 
forming the body. But although 
the aim is almost without exception to beau- 
tify the body, aesthetic considerations are usu- 
ally ancillary to social, religious or political 
preoccupations. However different the motives 
of the societies that engage in these practices, 
the common denominator is an attempt to 
dissociate the human body from its purely

tural dimension. 
Body painting lies somewhere between 
scarification, which leaves lasting marks, and 
accessories that can be put on, taken off and 
replaced at a moment's notice. Unlike jewelry 
or clothing, it alters the appearance of the skin;

scariftcations made by the Bobode of Mali and 
Burkina Faso on the heads of babies when they 
are afew days old. The scarifications are etched 
onto the still malleable skull tissue as well as the 
skin and last until the subjects die, enabling 
the corpse to be identified by the dead person’s 
ancestors. At the other end of the spectrum is 
the ritual during which married women of the 
Mfumte-Wuli people of western Cameroon 
wrap the red leaves of an ornamental plant 
around their hips once a year, on the day when 
agreat annual feast is held to celebrate the mar- 
riages that have taken place during the year. 
Some body paint can last for a very long 
time. When the Mfumte-Wuli rub their skin 
with the leaves of a plant they call mabiyeru, 
they obtain a black pigmentation that lasts 
for two years. Penetrating deep into the sub- 
cutaneous tissue, this technique bears some 
resemblance to tattooing, although unlike tat- 
tooling it is not permanent. Among the young 
. women and children it is replacing scarifica- 
tion, which has fallen into disuse.

cral days, sometimes even several weeks, like the 
henna used in North Africa. The effects of 
charcoal make-up, which can be as casily cffaced 
as watercolour, are more transient. 
Appearance 
and reality 
The Kayapo Indians of the Xingu region of 
Amazonia (Brazil) are inveterate body- 
painters. Not to wear body paint seems out of 
the question, except in such exceptional cir- 
cumstances as an illness during which the sick 
and their kinsfolk withdraw from commu- 
nity life. Like scarification in sub-Saharan 
Africa, body painting is here an emblem of 
the group’s cultural and ethnic identity. It is as 
if the Kayapo have chosen to indicate a person’s 
membership of the group by using ephemeral 
signs which are painted again and again, 
whereas in Africa permanent, incradicable 
markings are used for this purpose.

painting for everyday use and body painting 
for specific rituals. The former, which can be 
likened to clothing, consists mainly of black 
designs, covering almost the entire body, traced 
with genipapo, a dye extracted from the fruit 
of Genipa americana which remains visible 
for several days. Only the extremities (feet, 
ankles and head) are painted in red or rucu (a 
dye extracted from the seed of Bixa orellana), 
a colour associated with energy and vitality. 
When called for by particular circumstances

charcoal orgenipapo. Although these two forms 
of genipapo painting (daily patterns and ritual-

very much alike, only the everyday painting is 
specifically described as “fine painting”.

### 104947: Art's back-to-the-land movement

ART'S BY GILLES A. TIBERGHIEN 
BACK-TO-THE-LAND MOVEMENT 
© THE UNESCO Courier @ DECEMBER 1996 
t the end of the 1960s, a number of 
artists, most of them American, 
challenged the notion that galleries 
and museums are the most suit- 
able places in which to exhibit art. They pre- 
ferred natural sites, derelict industrial zones, 
quarries and mines, where they produced 
works out of natural materials, sometimes on 
a massive scale, thus creating a new tendency 
known as “earth art” or “land art”. 
At the end of the 1950s, interest in the 
human body, the “events” staged by the Fluxus 
movement that flourished in New York and 
 
Germany, Allan Kaprow’s “happenings” and 
productions by the Living Theater and other 
street theatre companies focused attention on 
the importance of movement and improvisa- 
tion, and created a cultural environment which 
also provided a context for music, painting and 
sculpture. At a time when the consumer soci- 
ety was riding high, artists started creating 
works that appealed to the active conscience of 
individuals and encouraged them to redefine 
their position as spectators. 
Body art, in which the body becomes a vehi- 
clefor experimentation, was the logical outcome

tunnels” are specially 
constructed pipes each 
measuring 6 metres long and

are aligned with the solstice 
and their sides are pierced 
with holes corresponding to 
the constellations. They act as 
observatories and a mirror of 
the day and night skies.

Heizer marked the ground with his heels. One 
of Richard Long’s first works, Line Made by 
Walking (1967), was the result of his walking to | 
and fro in a straight line over a stretch of grass, - 
leaving behind an ephemeral trace of his passage. 
From then on, two trends emerged which 
either combined or were mutually exclusive. 
The first, found chiefly in Europe, focused on 
the body (Gilbert and George) or body move- 
ment (Richard Long, Hamish Fulton). The sec-

ond, more particularly American, trend sought 
to create a new relationship between the body 
and space by intervening in the natural world, 
which it used both as an inscriptive vehicle and 
as a material. From 1968 on, for example, Heizer 
-created a series of works in the deserts of the 
American West, in some cases drawing inspira- 
tion from Indian pictograms, as in Primitive 
Dye Painting (1969), in others seeking to pro- 
duce simple geometrical forms with “nega- 
tive”—in other words hollowed-out—sculp- 
tures, such as Rift or Dissipate (1968).

works with a diameter of 91 and 24 metres 
respectively. He was returning to the primitive 
architectural forms that inspire certain land-art 
artists. Such imposingly large works have to be 
explored by spectators, who are prompted by 
their movement in space to look afresh at how 
sculpture relates to the movements of their 
own bodies. 
The distinctive feature of land art is this 
use of carth (or sand, rock, or wood) on nat- 
ural sites, which then become components of 
the sculpture, or even the sculpture itself, as in 
Heizer’s Double Negative (1969). This work 
consists of two colossal gashes ten metres 
wide, 17 metres deep and almost 500 metres 
long, gouged out of the side of a plateau, pro- 
longed by two platforms consisting of 240,000 
tonnes of excavated rubble. 
Involving the spectator 
This form of art should be distinguished from 
arte povera, which appeared in Italy around 
the same time. Examples of it, made out of 
natural materials, were mostly exhibited in 
galleries. A distinction should also be made 
between land art and other forms of inter- 
vention in the natural world, many of them 
  
more recent, such as the work of Nils-Udo, 
Bob Verschueren and Andy Goldsworthy, 
who practise what might be called vegetable 
art in that they often work with flowers, bark 
and leaves. A similar case is the work of Michael 
Singer, who erects large ephemeral structures of 
wood and bamboo in the open air (First Glade 
Ritual Series 4, 1979). 
Whether they are ephemeral or not, land art 
works are not easily accessible, either because 
they no longer exist, or because they are located 
in remote spots. In a sense, the effort needed 
to reach them contributes to the pleasure expe- 
rienced in looking at them. The journey and 
the crossing of the landscape rather than the 
landscapeitself are in some respects a constituent 
part of these works. For example, Richard 
Long—who denies any affiliation with land art 
even if it may fairly be asserted that he had a 
hand in its beginnings—shows, in galleries where 
he exhibits, not only captioned photographs 
and maps that indicate a date, a place and some- 
times the duration of the journey, but also 
stones arranged in a circle or row, which he did 
not bring back from his travels but extracted 
from quarries, and whose purpose is to pro- 
vide the spectator with a kind of perceptible 
equivalent of the essence of his art: walking. 
Other related art forms display some of 
the concerns of the exponents of land art. Cer-

tain artists consider the most important cle- 
ment to be “the process”. One of them is Peter 
Hutchinson, who used a rope to tic together 
five floating calabashes and waited for them 
to rot (Threaded Calabash, 1969). Others 
focus on “the environment”, such as Christo 
and Jeanne-Claude, who unfurled a 40-km- 
long cloth fence across Sonoma and Marin 
counties in California and left it there for two 
weeks (Running Fence, 1972-76). Others are 
more interested in light, in our relationship 
with the sun and the stars, or in landscapes. 
Others again find inspiration in the notion 
of the garden, whether traditional or pic- 
turesque, or make allusions to sanctuaries and 
fortresses. 
Photography, although not essential, often 
plays a central role in this form of art because

equivalent of a singular artistic experience, in 
which case itis presented as secondary for both 
artist and spectator, or a document about a 
work which itis up to the spectator to go and 
experience on the spot. For even in the case of 
certain monumental creations, which can only 
be fully appreciated from the air, photography 
cannot replace direct contact with the work 
itself. It is only through such contact that we 
can experience the human condition and the 
precariousncss of the world, and become aware 
of such notions as duration and transience— 
which is indeed the purpose of this kind of 
art, just as it was of seventeenth-century Van- 
itas still-life paintings of objects symbolizing 
the vanity of earthly achievements. [|

ne basic objective of this work was to 
aspire to absolute purity. In a sense, nature 
should represent itself. Anything alien to 
nature was excluded because of its impurity. 
This means that only materials found in the 
chosen natural space have been used and shaped. 
In view of the overwhelming profusion of 
natural phenomena, it appeared that they 
could only be worked on in small or very 
small fragments, detached from their context.

playing.

Just as everyone wants peace. But the fact is 
they lost nature long ago. They do not even

### 104950: Installation art

INSTALLATION ART 
nce upon a time there was paint- 
ing and there was sculpture. But 
that was along time ago. The tech- 
nologies employed by artists now 
include film, video, slide projection, sound 
and computers, and there is no limit placed 
upon the materials that may be used. The pre- 
sent-day visitor to a gallery or museum of 
contemporary art can expect to be met by 
almost anything. 
At the Dia Foundation in New York there 
isaroom filled to waist height with earth. Wal- 
ter de Maria’s 50m> Earth, made ata time in the 
late 1960s when artists were beginning to exam- 
ine the relationship between the industrial and 
natura] landscapes of the world and the ways 
in which they were represented in the gallery, 
has to be carefully tended and watered to keep 
it looking and smelling fresh. Although one can 
only stand at the doorway and look in, the 
physical presence of the work is impressive. 
At the Saatchi Gallery in London there is 
aroom filled to waist height with used car oil. 
A channel let into the tank allows one to enter 
the gallery which, because of the perfect reflec- 
tive qualities of the still, black liquid seems 
to dissolve as the strong illumination from 
the skylight also appears below one’s feet. 
However opposed their ultimate effects, 
these examples of what has come to be known 
as installation art share the idea that an art- 
work 1s not an object in the gallery but some- 
thing that extends throughout, thoroughly 
occupies and is to some extent congruent with 
its space. 
It has been more than a quarter of a century 
since art—some art at least—required its spec- 
tators to experience it differently. The term 
“installation” covers a huge variety of art- 
works, a variety of form, materials, content 
and cffect so broad that there seems little that 
could justify giving them all the same generic 
name. However, it is possible to identify a 
number of factors, principally concerning a 
new perception of the space and time within

ers—as “ready-made” works of art. These 
defied the idea that the artist’s touch, as the 
sign of 2a unique expressive act, was essential to 
art. They also demonstrated that it is the con- 
text in which we encounter things that largely 
determines how we behave towards them. If 
we come across something in an art gallery, 
whatever itis, we are predisposed to treat it as 
if it wereart. By extension, to talk about the 
meaning of the work is to speak of what arises 
out of this encounter and not to refer to 
something that lives in the work waiting to be 
unlocked and released. Contrary to conven- 
tional wisdom, this is not merely the justifi- 
cation that the charlatan seeks in order to pass 
off just anything as art, but an opportunity 
to reflect upon the particular qualities of one’s 
experience here, now. 
A good illustration of this is given by Gary 
Hill's Tall Ships. As the viewer walks down a 
broad, darkened corridor, other figures appear 
to close in from left and right. Whenever the 
spectator pauses to take a closer look, they 
too stop and stare back, making one feel 
extremely self-conscious, before turning and 
walking away. The figures are video projec- 
tions triggered by the presence of the specta- 
tor: in other words, there is only something 
there to look at because you are looking. 
However varied installations are, the thing 
they have in common is the fact that their mean- 
ings depend upon a relationship between the 
objects and images of which they are consti- 
tuted and the space that contains them. This 
space is also the space inhabited by the spectator, 
and as such it is an environment subject to the

vagaries and contingencies of daily existence. 
Things occur in our lives over which we exercise 
little or no control. Chance plays a large part in 
what happens to us, and the same is true to a 
greater or lesser extent in installation. Even some- 
thing as simple as stipulating that a work must 
be viewed in natural light, as the Welsh artist 
Bethan Huws does with her painstakingly pre- 
pared but apparently empty interiors, is suffi- 
cient to place one’s endeavours in the hands of 
fate. The gallery environment is not stable, but 
prone to change according to the season, the 
time of day and the amount of cloud cover.

the sun comes out or goes in, but one is expe- 
riencing an environment whose full potential 
cannot be revealed in one instant.

Another contrasting example of the way in 
which chance acts within the structure set up 
by the artist to make the work could be seen 
in Zurich’s Shedhalle in the late 1980s when 
Christian Marclay carpeted the floor with 
blank-grooved records. Visitors could only 
“see” the installation by walking on the discs, | 
an eventuality which inevitably led to their 
becoming scuffed and scratched. The very act 
of viewing leaves its trace. 
Perishable materials 
Installations unfold in time, their significance 
develops out of the spectator’s being with and 
in them. It is as much in this—the importance 
of duration—that their unfixable, ephemeral 
quality lies as in the fact that they may physi- 
cally change or degrade. Of course, some do 
change. Anya Gallacio’s use of perishable mate- 
rials such as flowers, fruit, chocolate or ice, 
means not only that her work will change from 
day to day, butalso that she can never be certain 
how those changes will affect the way the work 
looks. Flowers fade, dry out and shrivel, ice 
melts, oranges rot. Painting the gallery walls

One can also sce this mixing together of 
input from different senses at work in the 
German artist Joseph Beuys’s Plight, now part 
of the collection at the Pompidou Centre in 
Paris. The work comprises a blackboard and a 
thermometer lying on top of a grand piano in 
aroom cntirely lined with thick rolls of felt. 
It is impossible to consider the various refer- 
ences suggested by this work without taking 
account of the full range of its sensory impact. 
The cosy, insulating warmth of the felt 
quickly becomes suffocating, a point made 
both by the presence of the thermometer and 
the closed lid of the piano. The silence of the 
instrument emphasizes a synaesthetic equiva- 
lence between the stifling of sound and the 
containment of heat, just as the work’s Eng- 
lish title indicates the somewhat contradic- 
tory notions of a pledge and a predicament. 
With installation, then, the experience of art is 
inflected with sensorily rich, tactile elements. 
It is sull visual art, but the eye that appre- 
hends is unequivocally and inescapably housed 
in a body. 
Duchamp explained his works as being 
things that interested or amused him, and it is 
this quality of being interested in or fasci- 
nated by things rather than struck or absorbed 
by their beauty that characterizes installation. 
Many installations are, of course, beautiful, 
but the manner in which they are viewed is 
akin to the way in which we watch television, 
go for a drive, or fill a supermarket trolley. 
Our involvement in these activities is distracted 
in the full sense implied by the critic Walter

more traditional art forms. 
Awkward questions 
Beuys’s ambiguity and Marclay’s chance appear 
in other situations as uncertainty. The kind of 
reflection we are triggered into by installation 
can as well be broadly social and political as 
poctic or spiritual. At the Venice Biennale of 
1993, the U.S.-based German artist Hans Haacke 
broke up the stone floor of the German pavil- 
ion. A photograph of Hitler making a pre-war 
visit to the Biennale was mounted at the door 
while on the gallery ’s back wall the word “Ger- 
mania” was written up in a Fascist typeface. 
Picking one’s way across the fractured, loose 
and uneven floor was a precarious venture, 
appropriately symbolic of the difficulties inher- 
ent in the country’s own task of economic and 
soctal integration after reunification. 
In a comparable vein, the Russian Ilya 
Kabakov has, since the break-up of the Soviet 
Union, made a series of profoundly affecting 
environments that pose awkward questions 
about the transition to a new model of social 
organization. For the 1991 Carnegie Interna- 
tional he created an entire “school” complete 
with pupils’ work and meticulously kept 
attendance and academic records. The pupils 
and staff had been told they had to abandon 
these fruits of their earlier endeavours and 
move to another establishment. There was, 
though, no information on exactly where they 
were to go or what to expect when they 
arrived. Why, Kabakov asks, need so much of 
our former lives be jettisoned? It has been and 
remains of value in making us what we areand 
without it our sense of self-worth and our 
very identity as people is profoundly under- 
mined. And here we recognize that what, in 
installation, might strike us as transient, con- 
tingent, diffuse or unresolved is itself expres- 
sive of the character and qualities of contem- 
porary life. R

### 104954: Apocalypse now: a self-destroying Tinguely machine

  
APOCALYPSE NOW 
A self-destroying 
Tinguely machine 
by Michel Conil Lacoste 
Homage to New York, by the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely 
(1925-1991), noted for his machine-like kinetic sculptures, was 
presented at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, on 
17 March 1960. 
The event consisted of the self-destruction, in a hellish noise 
punctuated by detonations, of an enormous scrap metal con- 
struction into which as usual a number of miscellaneous objects 
had been incorporated: bicycle wheels, pram wheels, a coin- 
throwing contraption made by Robert Rauschenberg, wireless 
sets, shopping trolleys, a piano. The sense of smell was also 
involved, asin Métamatic 17 the year before: as if fo satisfy all the 
senses, the commotion was completed by an emission of mal- 
odorous fumes. The stage-by-stage eruption was punctuated by 
bangs, crashes, smoke, fiery explosions and mechanical break- 
downs, which took Tinguely himself by surprise, and eventually 
the firemen were called in. After half an hour, the whole thing— 
or what was left of it—was destroyed by remote control. The 
museum, the curators and the small group of assistants escaped 
unharmed from this auto da fé of metal, whose discrganizer con- 
fessed laterthat there had been moments when he had “pressed on 
regardless”. 
What was the point of this suicidal fury? The “sculptor’s” 
answer to this question is worth quoting: “Homage to New York 
was a simulacrum of catastrophe. As I saw it, the apocalypse was 
to be a plastic event. I wanted to create the end of civilization in 
plastic terms. It was ‘anironical suicide’, to use Duchamp'’s expres- 
sion, Everything went up in flames, asat the end of a civilization. 
In reality, we are atthe beginning of a civilization, at the begin- 
ning of the era of automatization. But weare not like the Egyptians 
who were convinced thatthe world they had invented would con- 
tinue to exist, We no longer believe in eternity. We are like any 
human being who grows old and thinks he is going to die. All the 
ancient civilizations believed in finality, but for us finality is move- 
ment. Finality is transformation.” (Art Press) mn

Virtual reality is computer

n the galaxy of three-dimensional virtual 
images into which we have entered, 
paintings and the handful of sculptures 
still produced using traditional methods 
have become a marginal phenomenon. Art pro- 
duced using simulation techniques is moving 
towards the conquest of a three-dimensional 
world of space and objects which we can enter 
and where we can move about freely. 
Art is breaking away from the straitjacket 
of convention and quitting the museum. Real- 
ity is no longer a matter of appearance but is 
becoming increasingly artificial and staged. 
The replacement of traditional paintings 
and sculptures by ready-made objects is a reac- 
tion to the impact of photography. The intro- 
duction of raw reality into art is a response to 
the opportunity which the photographic 
image offers of dissociating the representation 
of an object from its physical presence. The 
microphone and recording technology have 
brought the same phenomenon to music, 
where a composer like John Cage introduces 
| 
into his scores unusual or simple sounds which 
are the musical equivalent of ready-mades. 
Artists are proposing a new relationship with 
reality. Today, faced with the advent of virtual 
reality, we find ourselves cherishing the tangible. 
We are starting to attach an ethical value to the 
reality with which we come into violent contact 
at the same time as it eludes us. Now that we 
can conjure up all manner of images on our 
magic screens and reconstitute all kinds of things 
in virtual space, we are rediscovering a taste for 
risk in a world where images are analysed to 
death. Many people regard the computer as a 
machine that disembodies, but in fact the oppo- 
sites the case. The whole body becomes a com- 
mand post that is drawn into cyberspace and 
hooked up to a multitude of sensorial and track- 
Ing systems.

relevant. We have ceased to believe in the power 
of images; they have become too lightweight 
and insubstantial. They do not live up to our 
expectations. Even when they excite or move us, 
we act like an onlooker during a storm who 
impassively watches a shipwreck from the shore. 
When images began to move, the first audi- 
ence of the Lumiere brothers’ short film 
L’Arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat (1895) 
were apparently terrified that the locomotive 
drawing into the station would come out of 
the screen into the cinema. Today we no longer 
jump out of our seats when we see such images, 
but many people wish we did. Virtual reality 
has created a desire to use simulation techniques 
to transcend simulation and achieve the mental 
state of the man who became so involved in a 
play that he was ready to leap onstage to rescue 
the hero. Today we use a joystick or a mouse 
to create on our computer screens the creatures 
and images of our choice, but the time will come 
when monsters and fighter-bombers in elec- 
tronic games will be capable of transporting our 
virtual being into their virtual universe. 
We no longer want to look through win- 
dows. We want to step through doors into 
other worlds and come and go between them. 
We want reality, and so we ask for images that 
not only act on us but can react to our inter- 
ventions, in some cases unpredictably. Illusion 
and utopia are becoming less alluring, while 
reality is becoming more attractive, even as an 
unsophisticated form of entertainment. We 
want to get closer to reality and even touch it.

eye of the camera lens but feeling impressions

sory perspectives opens a whole network of 
possible interactions that escape linear per-

world is that those who have access to it can 
meet in it other “explorers”. Thus we have a

leable environment. What should we do or 
want to do and experience in it? 
Artists face an exciting challenge as they 
seck to extract dramatic effects from these new 
possibilities. The notion of the finished work 
has given way to that of performance by those 
at the receiving end, who use the work of art 
as an instrument whose possibilities they can 
exploit. [|

### 104962: Higher education and new technologies

bi) 
w anos | Federico Mayor 
} & 
New information and communication technologies, espe- 
cially the Internet, are offering researchers, educators, 
artists and administrators all over the world an opportunity 
to form the most cultivated, specialized, versatile and active 
intellectual community that the world has ever known—a 
kind of global university. 
The emergence of these technologies has revolution- 
ized our ways of thinking and living in recent years and 
opened up heady prospects for creating worldwide links 
between universities, institutes of higher education and 
research, libraries, laboratories and hospitals, disseminat- 
ing knowledge, promoting personalized teaching, educa- 
tion tailored to the needs of individuals and groups, the 
exchange of ideas and data and the implementation of col- 
lective projects.

It soon became clear that among the many fields where 
the new technologies may be applied—espeeially the high- 
capacity networks known as information superhighways 
that can carry data, sound and images—higher edueation, 
research and the promotion and dissemination of knowl- 
edge are those with the richest potential. 
But we should not let our hopes run away with us. In 
the wealthy nations privatization and deregulation are pro- 
ducing mixed and sometimes even disastrous results in 
human and ethical terms, notwithstanding some undeni- 
able advantages in terms of freedom of initiative and job 
creation. In the poorer countries they usually lead to highly 
aggressive and dehumanized market competition. 
Looking no further than the production, exchange and 
dissemination of knowledge, we can see that the technology 
explosion is increasing the enormous disparities between 
North and South. Within the countries of the North, it is 
widening the gap between the insiders (engineers, intellectuals 
and the cultured, well-off classes) and the outsiders who do 
not have the means to buy access to telecommunications.

creating as many dangerous illusions as fruitful achieve- 
ments. And what about the cost? Infrastructure, hardware, 
software and training costs are already exorbitant for Europe, 
as it tries to catch up with the American lead. They are crip- 
pling for the less-well-off countries, and a fortiori for the 
developing world, whose aspirations to modernity are already 
nndermined hy the struggle for survival. If we want the 
poor countries to have a ninimum of new information tech- 
nology, they will have to be helped. 
Cyberspace has no frontiers, limits or rules. Theoretically 
it belongs to everyone. A supremely efficient vector of com- 
munication and a place where freedom of thought may be 
exercised, it welcomes all who use it. But it is only acces- 
sible to those who have the requisite electricity, computers, 
telephone hooknps and know-how. This paradox recalls 
the ambivalence of the word “sharing”, which denotes both 
conjunction, as in the breaking and distribution of bread, 
and division, as in “time-sharing”. A whole must he divided 
before the parts can be distributed. 
Sharing, dialogue, exchange and interactivity are 
extremely ambiguous words. Often enough a person is only 
interactive with the screen, or at best with data placed at his 
or her disposal by thie provider or, on the Internet, with a peer 
group of researchers and specialists. Where is the relational 
interactivity, the give-and-take that encourages social cohe- 
sion and creates human warmth? The university has always 
been a place where people of flesh and blood can meet and 
live the life of the mind and share each other’s company. 
Where can students of the global university of electronic 
knowledge get together for convivial talk? The new tech- 
nologies have created a new kind of communication that 
tends to promote dialogue between person and machine and 
threatens to supersede hnman communication. 
The paradox of cyberspace 
One consequence of the rise of the audiovisual communi- 
cations media is the passivity of human behaviour in front 
of the screen. The citizen of the twenty-first century is a tele- 
viewer rather than a “teleactor”, and is usually regarded 
as a consumer—of images, information, entertainment and 
knowledge. Only students who have learned to master 
interactive machines and processes since childhood and 
know how to extract from the electronic media exactly what 
they need for their own growth can resist the powerful fas- 
cination of multimedia. For those who are less familiar with 
the technology, the discovery of the medium takes prece- 
dence over the message. Another paradox of the new situ- 
ation is that content is the poor relation in a revolution 
based on hardware, technology and processes. 
One reason for drawing attention to the dangers associated 
with these changes is to improve our capacity to cope with 
them. We must welcome and exploit the possibilities opened 
up by the new information technology, especially in view of 
current trends in higher edncation: increasing diversification 
of the student population and student demand (in terms of 
age, expectations and training programmes), financial diffi- 
culties in many cases due to cuts in government expenditure 
on higher education and the need to make training courses 
more flexible in order to follow market requirements. 
We must keep pace with change and, if possible, keep 
ahead of it. In order to present a synthesis of the main trends 
in higher edncation and set forth guidelines for its future 
policies in this field, UNESCO recently published a policy 
paper entitled Change and Development in Higher Edu- 
cation. It is to be expected that the new information tech- 
nologies will broaden access to higher education in all its 
diversity, and that the role of open universities and dis- 
tance-education systems will continue to expand. 
Learning without frontiers 
Steps must be taken to use the mobility, flexibility, leanness 


### 104962: Higher education and new technologies

and speed of the new information technologies to bring about 
real sharing of knowledge. Actions speak louder than words: 
Unesco did not wait until all the promise of these technolo- 
cies was fulfilled before launching its “Learning without 
Frontiers” programme. Its Member States decided that in 
1996-97 special attention would be paid to the use of tech- 
nology in education. In higher education, the UNITWIN/ 
UNESCO Chairs Programine is continuing to promote solidar- 
ity and co-operation between universities. An effort is being 
made to support university chairs and networks using new 
technology for education in general and distance education 
in particular. To promote diversification in ways and means 
of transmitting knowledge, the number of distance-education 
centres and open universities must be increased. 
The poor countries must be helped to acquire new tech- 
nologies and equipment, to train their people and enter 
existing networks, in short to modernize along with the oth- 
ers. Is a global information society really conceivable in a 
world where the overwhelming majority of citizens would be 
starved of training and information? In this massive effort of 
active solidarity, we must also carefully weigh up the power 
factors associated with the new information technology and 
make sure that “aid” does not lead to neo-colonialism. If we 
are not careful, aid donors will try to provide training tai- 
lored to their own needs, to advise setting up networks 
corresponding to demands they have defined for their own 
situation, and to back up training with programmes that 
they regard as relevant (and/or profitable?) for themselves. 
Each country should define its own needs, make its own 
requests, set up its own structures and constitute the 
regional network it desires to mateh its own aspirations. 
Solidarity, co-operation and aid: nothing is more demand- 
ing than real generosity, which puts recipients first and 
seeks to give then: the means to choose without inflnencing 
their choice. The information revolution is too rich in edu- 
cational and human potential to be left to market forces or 
those who use market forces for their own exclusive profit. 
Perhaps the greatest challenge of the twenty-first century 
will be to ally progress with fairness. ||

in 1865. The surrounding landscape 
is a blend of ¢leared forest, pas- 
tureland and a network of drainage 
canals some 250 kilometres long. 
The canals are used to flood the land 
when necessary and to provide access 
to the lake. Without them, at least 
 
on the Hungarian side, it would be 
impossible to get through the reeds, 
which grow in a belt up to 5 or 6 
kilometres wide. 
The Park was declared a Ramsar 
Convention! zone in 1989. Its reeds, 
muddy ponds and open water are a 
paradise for birds; 260 species have 
been recorded. Large numbers of 
egrets, herons, geese and grebe nest 
there, and it is a stopping off point 
for thousands of migrating geese, as 
well as storks and peregrine falcons. 
Thirty-six species of fish live in the 
lake. Frogs, toads, reptiles and 
insects abound. There are 1,513 
recorded species of plants, some of 
which grow only on alkaline soil, like 
the dwarf aster (Aster tripolium), 
which covers the ground with a 
mauve carpet. 
The Park has five funetions: nature 
conservation, land management, 
research, environmental education and 
ecotourism. However, its managers are 
having a hard time coping with fund- 
ing problems. As a result of cuts in 
public expenditure researchers can 
no longer count on state funding and 
have had to look for other sources. All 
the same, the Ministry of Agriculture 
is providing the reserve with financial 
aid in order to save three species of 
domestic animal from extinetion: the 
water buffalo, the Hungarian grey 
cow—whose number has risen from 
282 in 1960 to 2,500 today—and 
the Racka sheep. To tend the mead-

A few kilometres away, the Ans-

trast to what we saw on our visit to 
the reserve onthe Arizona (U.S.A.)-

here is privately owned,” he satd. 
“We have to rent it from 1,200 own-

might earn from farming. It costs us 
28 million schillings a year.”

total of 7,600 hectares. There is no 
industry around the lake, hut farm- 
ing and grape-growing both prosper. 
In summer the lakeside villages are 
visited by thousands of holiday- 
makers who love fishing and (non- 
motorized!) aquatic sports. Itis eas- 
ier to reach the lake on the Austrian 
side because there are not so many 
reeds, and the water is cleaner 
because sewage pipes have heen 
widely installed. Because the sur- 
rounding land is flat, no pesticide 
run-off reaches the lake. There are 
no rangers. Guides accompany visi- 
tors, who are only admitted to the 
Park on weekdays for lengthy hikes 
on asphalted roads built for that 
purpose. People in the vicinity 
receive a (quarterly newsletter from 
Aloys Lang entitled Geshnatter 
(“Cackle”), of which 6,000 copies 
arc printed. It is a mine of infornia- 
tion on nature and local life. 
On one of the roads we came 
npon a strange sight. A man was sit- 
ting in his car pointing a shotgun sky- 
wards. “Ilere hunting is still legal 
until 1999,” Aloys Lang explained, 
“when a contract made prior to the 
creation of the reserve expires, but 
only for local people with hunting 
licences.” When he heard this story, 
Attila Fresch burst out laughing, 
“The geese aren’t crazy. They know 
they’ve got nothing to worry about on 
the Iungarian side!” A single logo 
unites the two park reserves: two 
red geese facing a green goose on a 
white background symbolize the 
Austrian and IIungarian flags and a 
shared determination to preserve the 
region’s wildlife. |

initiatives RECTO THE RESCUE! 
When Bulgaria has problems protecting bears, when the Poles are developing ecotourism, 
the Czechs want to create a evele track in Moravia, and the Romanians are trying to encour- 
age public involvement in environmental legislation, where do they all go for help? The 
answer is the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe (REC). Set 
up in 1990 by the United States. the European Community and Hungary, the Center ini- 
tially confined its activities to Hungary, but in 1995 became an international foundation 
designed to help the people of the new democracies of Eastern Europe participate in envi- 
ronmental decision-making. The countries concerned include Albania, Bulgaria. Croatia, 
Estonia, Hungary. Latvia, Lithuania. Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
REC does not finance large-scale projects, but grants funds collected in the West to a 
large number of projects put forward by accredited non-governmental organizations. Its pro- 
grammes encourage experience sharing and the promotion of regional co-operation. e.g. by 
protecting the Danube, which flows through eight countries. A REC-organized seminar on 
this subject enabled officials from the Danube countries to meet and work together. in some 
cases for the first time. 
The Center works with non-governmental organizations engaged in fieldwork. with local 
authorities, governments. academic institutions, the media and the private sector. 
Recently it moved to new premises in a Budapest suburb that contain a library and a 
sophisticated electronic information exchange system. REC organizes a wide range of 
training courses open not only to the fifteen beneficiary countries but also to participants 
from Armenia. Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. 
As well as disseminating information, the courses strengthen East-East co-operation by 
bringing people together from all over the region. |

LAKE VICTORIA CLEAN-UP 
Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest 
freshwater body, is faring badly as 
overfishing and oxygen depletion 
are threatening fish stocks and bio- 
diversity. More than 200 indige- 
nous species face extinction, and 
fisheries, an important economic 
resource, face potential colapse. 
Algae, especially the potentially 
toxic blue-green variety, are 
spreading rapidly, and the water 
R L 
hyacinth has begun choking impor- 
tant waterways. Water-borne dis- 
eases, too, are on the rise. To help 
fight the Lake’s degradation the 
World Bank has contributed fund- 
ing to a programme run by the 
three riparian countries (Kenya, 
Tanzania, Uganda) to help them to 
manage fisheries, reduce pollution 
and improve water quality. [|

Six previously unknown primate

white-headed marmoset (Callithrix 
saterei), the size of a squirrel. The 
marmosets swing their way through 
the trees with great agility but 
unlike other primates do not use 
their long tails to hang from the 
branches. The females mate with 
several males, and the father car-

Both a UNEesco Biosphere 
Reserve and a World 
Heritage site, Cote d'Ivoire’s 
Tai National Parkis an area 
of remarkable biological 
diversity and home to one of 
the last representative 
samples of forest wildlife in 
West Africa.

park status by government decree on 
28 August 1972 in an area which had 
been a “forest and wildlife refuge” 
originally created by the French 
administration in 1926. In 1978 the 
  
Park was accepted as a biosphere 
reserve and in 1982 it became a 
World Heritage sitc. 
Straddling the borders of the 
departments of Guiglo and Sassan- 
dra, the Park comprises some 
454,000 hectares of dense evergreen 
to which 96,000 
hectares of the N’zo Animal Reserve

granitic area which flattens out near 
the coast where the granite gives 
way to schist. The soil in the north is 
fragile although protected from ero- 
sion by dense vegetation. Further 
south the soil is far more fertile, hen- 
efiting from the influence of the 
Hana and Meno rivers as well as 
heavy rainfall (more than 1900 mil- 
limetres annually). Itis around these 
rivers that the 230 bird species, and 
47 of the 54 species of large mam- 
mals known to occur in Guinean rain 
forest are most in evidence, as well as 
primates, ungulates and carnivores.

regions. Cape buffaloes (Syncerus 
caffer)livein couples or in herds of up 
toten. They livein marshland around 
the Hana and the Meno in the south of 
the Park and also along long-estab- 
lished trails that run through the sec- 
ondary forest. But they have a strong 
preference for dense undergrowth. 
Pygmy hippopotamus (Choerop- 
sis liberiensis), once found in Nigeria 
and today occasionally spotted in 
Sicrra Leone, can also be seen in the 
Park. They live in couples and much 
prefer conditions on land, where 
they find food and refuge in case of 
danger, to an aquatic environment. 
They venture into open country, usu- 
ally at dusk. Researchers at a sci- 
entific station near the village of Tai 
have come across them disporting 
themselves on Mount Niénokoué. 
Scientists are particularly inter- 
ested in the population of chim- 
panzees (Pan troglogytes verus) of 
which there are from 2,000 to 
3,000 specimens in the Park. The 
chimps use tools to crack nuts, orga- 
nize hunting and food sharing and 
practise division of labour aceord- 
ing to sex. They are elusive crea- 
tures, however, since the presence 
of humans disturbs them and their 
sexual cycle. Their reproduction 
rate gives little grounds to predict a 
population explosion. 
Tai National Park is home to 230 
bird species, 28 of which are 
endemic to the Guinean zone. Eight 
of them are threatened, including 
the white-breasted guinea fowl (A ge- 
lastes meleagridis). 
Of the 1,300 higher plant 
species identified in Southwest 
Africa, atleast 870 are found in the 
Park: 80 per cent of them are 
endemic to the Guinea-Congo sec- 
tor and 10 per cent to the south- 
western part of Cote dIvoire. The 
northern part of the humid primary 
forest consists largely of climbing 
palms with spiny blistered leaves 
(Eremospatha macrocarpa), and of 
Diospyros mannii, small trees 
belonging to the family that includes 
ebony and niangons (Turietia utilis).

through the Park visitors can see

trees whose trunks soar towards the 
light like a simplified human form 
joyfully thrusting out a multitude 
of arms. There is a greater variety 
of endemic plants in the south of 
the Park because of its more fertile 
soil and heavier rainfall. One of the 
region’s rarities is also found there, 
Armorphophallus staudtii, a species 
that was thought to have disap- 
peared until it was rediscovered in 
1977. 
Ant-hills built on dead tree 
trunks are found on the edge of the 
trails which wind around the virgin 
forest in the south and lead to the 
Park’s ecological station. 
A BARRIER AGAINST CLIMATIC 
DETERIORATION 
Tai National Park faces a number 
of threats. In addition to those orig- 
inating in the usual economic activ- 
ities found in forests, the arrival 
since 1989 of hundreds of thousands 
of Liberian refugees fleeing civil war 
in their country has considerably 
increased demographic pressure on 
the environment. Cropland (coffee, 
cacao, palms, hevea) may expand 
and make inroads on the reserve’s 
peripheral areas. Poaching and 
unsupervised panning for gold must 
also be reckoned with, although 
development programmes set up in 
recent years (especially under the 
auspices of the Dutch Tropenbos 
Foundation, UNESCO’s Man and the 
46 THE UNESCO Courier HB DECEMBER 1996 
Biosphere Programme, and German 
technical co-operation schemes) have 
closely involved people living in the 
Tai forest. 
Since 1988, a Park Development

Autonomous Project for the conser-

In the first half of the seventeenth cen- 
    
tury the territory known nowadays as 
the Ukraine was embroiled in the rebel- 
lion of the Cossacks, military settlers who organized commu- 
nities in the vast steppe area between the territories controlled 
by the Polish government and those controlled by the Crimean 
Khanate. The leading figure of this rebellion, Bohdan Khmel- 
nytsky, was to leave a profound and enduring mark on the polit- 
ical landscape of this part of Europe. 
Ukrainian lands were the core of the medieval Kiev state 
known to historians as Kievan Rus’, a commercial crossroads 
between Western Europe, the East and the Byzantine Empire. 
Under pressure from nomadic invasions and internal rivalries, 
it splitinto a dozen or so smaller principalities at the beginning 
of the thirteenth century. The largest of these principalities, 
Galicia-Volhynia, came under the domination of the kingdom 
of Poland after a period of relative independence and resis- 
tance to the Mongol conquests. Some of the others were con- 
trolled by the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania, before 
being joined to Poland after the Union of Lublin in 1569. Early 
in the seventeenth century, increasing oppression of the Ortho- 
dox peasants of the Ukraine by the Catholic Polish nobility led 
to social, ethnic and religious tensions that sparked off rebel- 
lions in which the Cossacks played a leading role. 
Ardent defenders of their “ancient freedoms” and champions 
of the Orthodox faith, the Cossacks organized themselves behind 
the Dnepr rapids into the so-called Zaporozhian Sich (“fortifi- 
cation behind the rapids”) and chose Bohdan Khmelnytsky, an 
officer belonging to the Ukrainian minor nobility, as their hetman 
(commander in chief). Ile led a number of Cossack risings. 
A good tactician, an excellent politician and an astute diplo- 
mat, Bohdan Khmelnytsky concluded an important alliance 
with the Crimean Tatars that enabled him to win decisive vic- 
tories over Poland. He then began peace negotiations. As the 
leader of a force that sought only to uphold its autonomous sta- 
tus, he did not at first seek territorial expansion or political dom- 
ination. As time went by, however, the Cossacks’ position hard- 
ened, and a series of campaigns were waged to wrest a number 
of territories from Polish dominion. A Ukrainian government was 
established, led by Khmelnytsky, who proved to be a remark- 
able political leader and administrator. 
A Ukrainian state was created as the continuation of Kievan 
Rus’. Power was delegated by the central government to local 
authorities, and Khmelnytsky introduced to Ukrainian towns 
the system of autonomous municipal administration known as

the Magdeburg law, from the German city where it was first 
established. Self-governing bodies were established in cities, 
boroughs and villages, where civilian administrators co-operated 
with the military authorities. 
Although these were troubled times, Khmelnytsky paid 
much attention to cultural development in his country, espe- 
cially by granting financial support and privileges to the monas- 
teries, which at that time were centres of education and print- 
ing. Bulos of Aleppo, who accompanied the Patriarch of Antioch, 
Macarius II, through the Ukraine on his way to Moscow, 
recorded bis amazement when he discovered that, “All the [Cos- 
sacks], including their women and daughters, with very few 
exceptions know how to read and are familiar with the Church’s 
liturgy and hymns. What is more, the priests instruct orphans and 
do not let them wander through the streets in ignorance.” 
Nevertheless, the new state’s prospects were not favourable. 
The Ukraine was surrounded by powerful countries, and after 
a major defeat the Crimean Tatars went over to the Polish side 
and Khmelnytsky had to look for new allies. In 1654 be obtained 
Muscovite military aid in exchange for recognizing the Tsar's 
sovereignty over the Ukraine, but when he realized that Muscovy 
intended to curtail Ukrainian rights, he concluded a treaty with 
Sweden, which was then at war with Poland and Russia. When 
Khmelnytsky died in 1657, he had not succeeded in redressing 
the balance of power in the Ukraine’s favour. No later hetman 
proved able to achieve this goal. |

### 104973: Isabelle Leymarie talks to Bernard Maury

Listening 
Isabelle Leymarie talks to B ERNARD MAU RY 
Atalented pianist and a fine teacher, Bernard Maury is a spiritual son and 
disciple of the American jazz pianist Bill Evans. He hails from southwestern 
France, where he grew up in a music-loving family. 
BM You have often said that if rhythm is the 
body of music, then harmony is its soul. 
Could you enlarge on this? 
Bernard Maury: When I first became inter- 
ested in jazz, as a teenager, it was 
almost impossible to get hold of scores. 
I'd trained as a classical pianist, but 
since I hadn’t studied harmony, was 
incapable of playing jazz without a 
score. Sure, I could always retran- 
scribe certain melodies by ear, but 1 
also had to find the accompaniment, 
and my rough and ready chords didn’t 
sound anything like those I heard on 
records by Erroll Garner or Oscar 
Peterson, pianists whose tone colours 
I'admired a lot. 
After a bit of practice managed to 
make sense of certain solos, but learn- 
ing chords out of their context wasn’t 
good enough. I wanted to know the 
reason for certain harmonic config u- 
rations. For me a chord is not an iso- 
lated thing but the result of a pro- 
gression. I became interested in 
counterpoint as well as harmony 
because it deals with the movement of 
voices. As Debussy knew, a chord has 
its own intrinsic colour, which creates 
a particular climate, and I wanted to 
4 | THE UNESCO Gourier WN DECEMBER 1996 
construct chords in my own way, by 
controlling their tonal colour. 
When I was twenty I had a few ele- 
mentary harmonics lessons, but mostly 
Istudied alone, soaking up textbooks, 
following my own lines of research and 
analysing classical works. It’s very 
rewarding to find out basic principles 
by yourself. Playing jazz taught me to 
see harmony in a different way from 
that usually taught in music schools. 
Harmony is a matter of logic and ear, 
but it shouldn’t be made too abstract. 
It must live. 
BM How did you come to jazz? 
B. M.: When I was around twelve or 
thirteen, I went to a lecture given by 
the musicologist Ilugues Panassié. It 
was an eye-opener. I'd already heard 
about jazz, but until then no one had 
told me anything about its history— 
and it’s part of a very different cul- 
ture from my own. In Toulouse, where 
I went to study later on, jazz bands 
always played at university dances. I 
began to paraphrase around themes, 
then I took the plunge. I’ve got a fairly 
analytical mind, and | tried to under- 
stand how the phrases were built; 1 
imitated the great musicians, and I 
chose my masters. 
BM How did you meet Bill Evans? 
B. M.: In 1972 he came to Paris for a 
concert with his bass player Eddy 
Gomez and his drummer Marty Morell. 
Bill had been my idol for several years, 
and I was dying to meet him. At the 
time I was playing in a Paris club with 
the saxophonist Johnny Griffin. One 
night after our set, a couple of Amer- 
icans who’d been sitting at the bar 
came over and started chatting. Pretty 
soon I realized they were Gomez and 
Morell. The next day a friend invited 
me to have lunch with Bill Evans him- 
self! And we hit it off right away. 
I had some great times with him, 
When he sat down at the piano I never 
missed a note. lle was one of the great 
names of jazz, try as he might to deny 
it—he was a very modest man. “It didn’t 
come at all naturally,” he told me. “I 
had to work darned hard.” He would 
play certain sequences again and again 
so I could really understand them. He 
never gave lessons, but if he felt some- 
one was receptive to his music and 
could sce what he was up to, he would

zo out of his way to explain. I had 
already been trying to analyse his music 
for quite a while. Two years before, I'm 
not sure I would have had the faintest 
idea about what he was doing. 
MW You spent two years in Brazil. Have you 
been influenced by Brazilian music? 
B. M.: I loved Brazilian music before I 
went to live in Rio de Janeiro—the 
samba, of course, but above all the 
jazzy bossa nova—Dbecause of its har- 
monic wealth and its poetry. Its unob- 
trusive rhythm brings out the melody 
and the harmony, and the different ele- 
ments balance beautifully. Brazil has 
produced extremely talented musicians 
and lyricists such as Antonio Carlos 
Jobim. While I was there I accompa- 
nied the singer Maria Creuza, and when 
I was playing in a club in Copacabana 
I teamed up with the great pianist 
Johnny Alf, one of the precursors of 
bossa nova.

IB What qualities does a student of jazz 
need to have? 
B.M.: You've got to be highly motivated. 
It’s fringe music and rarely brings fame 
or riches. It’s more like evangelism than 
a profession. You need to be stubborn 
and take the hard knocks in your stride, 
You need a musical ear and sensibility, 
although it’s true that the ear can be 
trained. You’ve got to be rigorous, but 
you've also got to know how to let your 
imagination take flight, be logical at cer- 
tain times and not at others, and know 
how to forget the academic side of jazz 
and let creativity take over. 
HW What about teaching jazz? 
B. M.: Most of all you have to love 
music. It’s a bit like religious faith, 
which often goes with evangelism; you 
want to share something you love. Yon 
learn a lot from teaching because you 
have to dismantle niechanisms that are 
sometimes unconscious. You can play 
interesting ideas intuitively, but you 
need to analyse them in order to pass 
them on to others, and this opens up 
new horizons. Teaehing is very reward- 
ing, but it’s primarily a matter of giving. 
I think if I hadn’t taught, there are 
pieces I’d have been quite incapable of 
playing because I wouldn't have 
understood them. 
BW What are your current plans? 
B. M.: As a tribute to Bill Evans, I’ve 
just founded the Bill Evans Piano Acad- 
emy in Paris. We don’t only teach the 
piano. Bill was one of the most important 
jazz pianists of the second half of the 
century, up there with Bud Powell and 
Thelonious Monk. Modern jazz musi- 
cians owe him an enormous debt. In the 
world of jazz he’s also a direct descen- 
dent of the French school of Faure, 
Ravel, Debussy, Lili Boulanger and 
Henri Dutilleux. The Bill Evans Piano 
Academy aside, I've got two recording 
projects: one solo and the other playing 
unpublished compositions by Bill Evans 
that I'll be choosing with the help of 
his family. |]

### 104974: Hungary's appointment with Europe

  
1100 years aqo 
Hungary's appointment 
with Europe 
by Péter Deme 
 
This year Hungarians have been celebrating the 1100th 
anniversary of the settlement of the Carpathian Basin by 
their ancestors. According to historical sources the process 
actually began in 895%, when the main mass of migrants 
under their leader, Arpad, crossed the Verecke Pass in 
the eastern Carpathians and descended to the plain in 
response to an appeal for help by Arnulf, the Holy Roman 
Emperor, who was seeking to assert his authority over the 
Moravians. 
The Magyars were a federation of semi-nomadic, semi- 
agrarian tribes which came from the East. In their new 
homeland they gradually abandoned raiding and military 
expeditions, and developed new social and political stru c- 
tures appropriate to a more settled way of life. Arpad’s 
great-grandson, Geza, played a prominent role in this 
process, but it was above all Geza’s son Stephen (997- 
1038), the first Hungarian King, who laid the foundations 
of the new Hungarian state. For his coronation, which took 
place according to tradition on Christmas Day, in the year 
1000, he asked the Pope to send him a crown, thereby 
committing himself and his country to the Western European 
world. In recognition of the long process whereby the Mag- 
yars and other peoples in the region became a European 
nation in the Carpathian Basin, Hungarians are already 
preparing to celebrate in the year 2000 the millenary of the 
birth of the Hungarian state. | || 
* The anniversary is being celebrated in 1996 because the IIungarian Parliament 
decided that the thousandth anniversary of settlement in the Carpathian Basin 
shonld be commemorated in 1896 instead of 1895, because many of the arrange- 
ments for the commemorative celebrations were delayed. Author's note
