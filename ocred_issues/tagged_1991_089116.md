Untitled 
19809, tapestry cartoon (50 x 50 cm) by Raymond Pichaud 
in Western art a cartoon was originally a full-sized drawing done on pasteboard and used as a model for a tapestry, a fresco painting, a mosaic or a stained glass design. In its purity of line 
and geometric tension, this cartoon by the contemporary French artist Raymond Pichaud seems to be the fruit of an encounter between this Western tradition and the spirit of African art.

### 89092: Interview with Tahar Ben Jelloun

  TAHAR 
BEN JELLOUN 
Tahar Ben Jelloun is a Moroccan poet and 
novelist who spans two cultures, Arab and 
French. In 1987 he became the first Arab 
writer to win France's most prestigious 
literary prize when his novel La Nuit sacrée 
was awarded the Prix Goncourt. 
An English translation of La Nuit sacrée 
appeared in 1989 under the title The 
Sacred Night, and several of his other 
works have been published in English, 
including The Sand Child (1987) and Silent 
Day in Tangier (1991). 
Alert to the hopes and sufferings of Arab 
men and women and to the stirrings of 
freedom in the world at large, Tahar Ben 
Jelloun here talks about his work and the 
commitment to truth and justice from 
which it springs. 
W Let's start at the beginning. You are an 
Arab writer who writes in French, Why? 
— I belong to a specific category of writers, 
those who speak and write in a language 
different from that of their parents. I am a 
Moroccan, an Arab. My culture is Arab, 
Islamic, but it was in French, the language of 
the former colonial power, that I spontane- 
ously expressed myself when I began to write. 
This is a paradox which stems from a histor- 
ical situation. Morocco, which was a French 
Protectorate from 1912 to 1956, managed to 
be receptive to French culture without losing 
any part of its identity. I don’t feel guilty 
about expressing myself in French; nor do I 
feel that I am continuing the work of the 
colonizers. Actually, what I express in French 
could very well be expressed in any other 
language. 
All the same, the fact that I do not use the 
language of my people perhaps means that I 
can take liberties with certain themes which 
the Arabic language, the language of the 
Qur'an—which naturally intimidates me— 
would not allow me to take. On the one hand 
there are taboos and prohibitions; on the other 
there is my own sense of propriety. It is 
difficult for us to ill-treat the Arabic language.

### 89092: Interview with Tahar Ben Jelloun

For me poetry is a situation—a state of being, 
a way of facing life and facing history. 
B® Do you mean that the language of tradi- 
tion, of unchanging values, is your mother 
tongue, whereas to break new ground and 
explore other directions, you need to express 
yourself in a foreign language? 
— Yes, it helps and liberates the imagination. 
For many people, poetry is working with 
words, with language. It is hard to imagine a 
poet who expresses himself in a language other 
than that of his people. But there is another 
conception of poetry, which is, for me, a 
broader and more accommodating one. For 
me poetry is a situation—a state of being, a 
way of facing life and facing history. Poetry 
is not only a set of words which are chosen 
to relate to each other, it is something which 
goes much further than that to provide a 
glimpse of our vision of the world. It does this 
through images, through a musical universe. 
And this universe can very well be expressed 
in words and syllables which are not those of 
one’s mother tongue. 
I'am a guest of the French language. My 
poems in French are born of my interaction 
with the French language, which is not the 
same as that of a French poet. 
Bm Precisely. What kind of adaptation bas 
there been between the French language and 
your universe and between your universe and 
the French language? 
— There has been no adaptation, but rather 
a marriage, a kind of cohabitation that I have 
entered into with French and which means 
that I give this rather Cartesian language 
another feel, another memory. I introduce it 
into a world to which it could never other- 
wise have been admitted. If you send a French 
sociologist, researcher or journalist to 
Morocco, he will not see the kind of things 
that I see as a result of my deep involvement 
as an Arab and a Moroccan. The French 
investigator will not see these things or be able 
to express them. 
In a sense, we Arab writers who write In 
French are the ones who offer hospitality to 
the French language! Not only do we adopt 
it, we invite it home, we transform it, we take 
it to places where it is not accustomed to go. 
Sometimes it gets lost, but so much the better 
since it’s a language which is somewhat too 
rigid except when it is taken in hand by great 
poets like Mallarmé, Baudelaire or Rimbaud. 
Jean Genet transformed French-into a beau- 
tiful rebel princess. But few French poets have 
done with the language what poets like Kateb 
Yacine or Aimé Césaire, two great franco- 
phone poets, have done. These are writers 
who have gone very far creatively, experimen- 
tally, and as craftsmen of the language. 
® Different images? Different sounds? 
— Above all a different manner. Poetry is a 
form of mathematics, a highly rigorous rela- 
tionship with words. The genius of an Aimé 
Césaire is to know how to choose words with 
fantastic precision and to marry them in such 
a way that they produce unexpected images. 
By doing this he creates new insights into 
meaning which are surprising and sublime. 
This 1s beauty, something that cannot be 
explained away technically. Beauty is first and 
foremost an emotion. When I read Aimé 
Césaire’s Cahiers d'un retour an pays natal for 
the first time, [ was spellbound. The same 
thing when I discovered Kateb Yacine’s 
Nedjma. Perhaps my sensibility steers me 
towards these writers who are out on their 
own. 
B For writers like you and them, has writing 
in French made for a bigger or smaller reader- 
ship in the countries where you were born? 
— It may seem odd, but writing and pub- 
lishing in France has enabled me to commu- 
nicate with a pretty wide public, even in the 
Maghreb. And this public reads me just as well 
in French as in Arabic. Those who read me 
in French are more numerous, perhaps 
because they want to go to the original. But 
I must say that Arab publishing is in such a 
mess today that so far I haven't found my 
public in the Arab world. Piracy or unautho- 
rized reproduction is doing terrible harm. The 
pirates not only steal translations, they tamper 
with them so that your work 1s distorted and 
your relationship with the public is perverted. 
Not to mention countries where books are 
purely and simply banned because of an occa- 
sional erotic or political allusion, for example. 
I think that on the whole publishing in 
the Arab world is in a bad way. What is pub- 
lished there is not always subjected to serious 
standards of criticism. Vast quantities of stuff 
get into print. Some of it is good, but much 
of it is bad. There is a confusion which reflects 
a general situation, 
Wm In what sense? 
— The Arab world as a whole has been in the 
grip of a serious crisis for forty-odd years. [ 
say “grip” because the crisis has become a state 
of being which takes hold of people and steri- 
lizes them, paralyzing their creative impulse. 
As if the Arab world had not experienced 
sufficient pain to produce great writers such 
as Dostoevsky or Kafka, who were born of 
suffering and humiliation. Perhaps we have 
not yet reached the bottom of the pit. 
We do not have many intellectuals who 
can speak out for us internationally. We have 
no writers who are recognized, respected and 
loved outside the Arab world. The rest of the 
world only seems to have become aware of 
the existence of Naguib Mahfouz since he won 
the Nobel Prize two years ago. Basically

people are only interested in the Arab world 
when there is trouble. Who in Europe knows 
the work of Yusuf Idris, Edouard Kharrat and 
Chaker Essayab? Mahmoud Darwish is only 
known in Europe to supporters of the Pales- 
tinian cause, and not even to all of them. 
W You are not sticking to the point. . . . 
— If we have no Arab intellectuals of interna- 
tional stature, it is because, on the one hand, 
we live in a state of generalized mediocrity, 
we are suspended in the pit without touching 
the bottom, as I said just now, and on the 
other because the world does not look to us 
out of a healthy desire for knowledge. The 
two reasons are complementary, I think. 
W Let's examine the first reason a little more 
closely. What stands in the way of creative 
thinking? The position occupied by the 
intellectual? 
— For me the intellectual, the man of thought, 
doubt and analysis, should by definition give 
the best of himself. He may find himself in 
one of two distinct situations: he lives either 
in a country where freedom prevails—real 
freedom not sham freedom—or in a country 
where repression provokes him to make some 
kind of an outburst because he can no longer 
endure humiliation, fear and silence. In each 
of these two cases, he can create. 
But the intellectual may also find himself 
in a nebulous, ill-defined, equivocal situation. 
This is often our case. What have we achieved 
since the end of the Second World War? We 
have established, or more exactly we have 
allowed to be established, petty bourgeois 
regimes in which everything is average, medi- 
ocre. In this situation of “averageness”, which 
I'would prefer to call mediocrity, intellectuals 
try to keep going. But their situation is very 
difficult. Those who have had the courage to 
voice their opposition have often paid a very 
high price. We should pay tribute to them. 
Wm [5 there not also a habit of “thinking 
together”, a fear of being noticed, of standing 
out from the community at large? People feel 
safer, finally, in this average situation. 
— There is a constant, something which you 
find everywhere. The individual, as a unique 
entity, as a singular human being, is not really, 
fully recognized. What is recognized, even 
today, and whatever people may say, is what 
lies behind the individual: the clan, the family, 
the tribe, the district or the village, but not 
the expression of the individual's uniqueness. 
However, a modern civilization is only pos- 
sible when it is accepted that singular beings 
exist and express themselves freely. 
In our societies, when a person expresses 
disagreement with the general consensus, 
when he or she is no longer at one with the 
rest of the tribe, then that person is rejected. 
An individual voice can be heard in a choir 
that otherwise sings in unison. This is some- 
thing that is not excused. 
Of course, there are also degrees, nuances, 
and steps forward. Egypt, for instance, seems 
to me to be in process of breaking up this pat- 
tern, perhaps because it is a country steeped 
in history and because its experience of 
modern democracy goes back to 1923. . . | 
Egypt has a head start, historically speaking, 
it has had the time to train minds for the exer- 
cise of citizenship. It is the country which has 
suffered more ordeals than the others to get 
where it 1s. . . . 
To be fair, we should cite particular break- 
throughs in other Arab countries. But what 
is certain is that a long road lies ahead. Sub- 
jectivity 1s still generally frowned on. People 
do not understand that a writer or a film- 
maker explores his subjectivity and expresses 
it in public. 
W Take the great Egyptian singer Um 
Kalsum. When she sang she tugged at the 
heartstrings of tens of millions of Arabs. . . 
Is that subjectivity or not? 
— It 1s somewhere between subjectivity an 
widely shared values. She played on a key- 
board of emotions, but these emotions were 
attuned to archetypes, rather conventional sty- 
lized sentiments. We are rarely shown any- 
thing of a private world. Her songs are rooted 
much more in what you might call a “collec- 
tive subjectivity”. 
W You naturally compare Western societies 
with Arab societies. If intellectuals aren’t 
often portrayed in a good light in the Arab

world, why is this so and what can be done 
about it? Intellectuals and writers have 
played a big part in bringing change to the 
West. 
— For the moment I don’t see change coming 
about through the intellectuals, for the simple, 
terrible reason that there is a gulf between the 
Arab peoples and Arab intellectuals. 
W Were the ties all that close between Voltaire 
and the French peasantry in the eighteenth 
century? 
— There has always been, everywhere, a 
polemical, sometimes even violent relationship 
between intellectuals and the people. But the 
important thing is that there should be a rela- 
tionship of some kind. In the Arab world, 
since the cultural disruptions caused by coloni- 
zation, there 1s no longer a link between the 
cultural habits of peoples and the ways of 
thinking and creating of modern intellectuals. 
They are two separate worlds. The only 
example which comes to mind, in recent years, 
of a marked congruence between the people 
and the intellectuals, is the case of the musi- 
cian Sheikh Imam and the performer-poet 
Fuad Nagm in Egypt. And even then, their 
message was transmitted through the medium 
of popular song on cassettes. If they had been 
writers In an ivory tower that symbiosis 
would not have existed. 
I would add that although they were very 
popular, it was popularity within an intellec- 
tual, militant stream of opinion. They got 
through not to the peasant masses but to the 
intelligentsia in the broadest sense of the term. 
Not only the intellectuals, the thinkers, but 
the hundreds of thousands of people who can 
read a newspaper, who watch the television, 
who live in the cities, who travel perhaps. . . 
who are, in any case, influenced by the cinema, 
the radio, and television. 
  
~ There has always 
been, everywhere, a 
polemical, sometimes 
even violent 
relationship between 
intellectuals and the 
people. But the 
important thing is that 
there should be a 
relationship of some 
kind.   
It the circumstances are propitious, 
writers, painters, sculptors and poets can make 
an impact on those groups. But they cannot 
reach the masses, above all the peasants. 
Perhaps they could do so gradually, if the 
media tried to make them known and helped 
them to get their message across to the greatest 
number. But as a rule the media are open to 
those whose material is undemanding, 
inoffensive—actors and singers. 
All day long they broadcast soap operas 
which propagate a lowbrow ideology. Today 
people watch only this kind of stuff. As 2 
result, most intellectuals worth their salt have 
no option but to get quietly on with their 
work, far from the limelight. Myself, I don’t 
think there’s anything wrong in taking that 
decision, hoping that future generations will 
discover one’s work and like it. 
W [f you think that little can be expected of 
the intellectuals for the moment, where will 
change come from? 
— Let's take the example of Europe. Until 
very recently there were three powerful dic- 
tatorships in Europe: Spain, Portugal and 
Greece. The future for these countries seemed 
totally blocked, it was impossible to see what 
they could do. And yet they have been reborn, 
initially because of a new-found political 
legitimacy. Finally they accepted the very 
simple idea that to lead a country, you must 
periodically hold a national consultation in 
which people representing different 
programmes can make a bid for power. 
It all starts when power is desacralized and 
politicians become vested with it, not because 
they have bought the best machine-guns or 
chosen the best moment to overthrow their 
comrades, but because they have a vision of 
the future, a programme for which they have 
obtained a majority which trusts them.

ER TEs 
W But aren’t you putting the cart before the 
horse? 
— Yes of course. That's what intellectuals do. 
It’s a long hard job, and it’s not by producing 
committed, ideological literature that you can 
get the message across. There are two levels: 
specifically political work and creative work. 
In general the two are quite distinct, otherwise 
you have art or literature which is disem- 
bodied, sterile. 
® How can intellectuals prepare the ground 
for progress? 
— They must get people used to the existence 
of doubt, of criticism, of disagreement, praise 
the courage involved in opposition, insist on 
the right to say no, to be alone, to stand out 
from the herd. Creative artists can say all this 
in their own way and in their own field, by 
hard, rigorous work. 
Two attitudes are possible. Creative artists 
can do their own thing, try to satisfy them- 
selves without bothering whether their coun- 
trymen understand them or not. Or else 
they can try to invest the strongholds of mass 
culture. Unfortunately it is impossible to 
disregard such an important medium as 
television, for example. We should know 
how to use it, learn to work in it and express 
new values in it. And of course we must 
fight for that. New ideas should confront 
old ideas, as they do everywhere. We must 
refer again to the example of Europe. People 
have fought to make Europe what it is today. 
Freedom is not something that is served up 
on a plate, like breakfast. It has to be earned. 
Be vigilant, for nothing one achieves lasts 
for ever. 
® But how should an intellectual approach 
this task? 
  
Freedom is not 
something that is 
served up on a plate, 
like breakfast. 
It has to be earned, 
Be vigilant, for 
nothing one achieves 
lasts forever.   
— First and foremost through self-expression. 
But what is happening today? There seems to 
be a kind of sound-proof barrier. The intellec- 
tuals cannot be heard. Are they expressing 
themselves but we can’t hear them? Perhaps. 
Perhaps they are shouting their heads off and 
we can’t hear them, 
® [sn’t one big problem that of being able 
to communicate freely with the rest of the 
world? Keeping abreast of what's going on 
elsewhere, of what other people are thinking? 
— Yes, there isn’t enough information and no 
attempt is made to encourage people to know 
what's going on. But there is always rumour, 
the weapon of the poor. Rumour, humour, 
irony—they can be very effective but of course 
they’re not enough. 
B® Who in your opinion, in the novel, art or 
literature, have prepared or are preparing a 
way to the future? You mentioned Naguib 
Mabfouz. 
— Yes, Mahfouz is our national monument. 
But don’t forget Taha Hussein before him. Or 
the Iraqi writer Al Sayyab, who died in 
Kuweit in 1962. To my mind he is a very great 
poet. Modern, ahead of his time, he broke new 
ground in Arab poetry. He had a vision of the 
world that was universalist and at the same 
time deeply rooted in his native country. And 
great rigour in the use of Arabic. 
Adonis has brought new life to Arabic, 
but in a way which does not seem to me 
entirely successful. His poetry is highly tech- 
nical, highly cerebral. Mahmoud Darwish is 
quite the opposite. He is a poet of verbal 
generosity, who has a sense of imagery, a 
broad perception, and writes for a mass 
audience. The ideal would be a mixture of 
Adonis and Darwish. A poet like that would

be the greatest poet of the Arab world. . . . 
But we don’t have such a poet. . . . There are 
very few great poets in the world anyway. 
B® What about short story writers? 
— Some of them have produced very good 
work. First of all there is Yusuf Idris, a very 
fine writer whom I would rank with William 
Faulkner. In a few pages he can express the 
preoccupations of a whole society. By 
describing a seemingly trivial incident or 
character, he leaves traces which endure. Idris 
Is a great writer. 
BW Painters? 
~ The painters I like are abstract painters. For 
me the greatest of them is the Moroccan 
painter Ahmed Charkawi, who died in 1967 
at the age of thirty-six. He is a painter who 
wspires strong feelings. He uses the basic 
colours and signs of our conscious or uncons- 
clous universe, our universe as Arabs and 
Africans. 
B Working in depth with language, signs and 
images is one way of preparing the ground 
for modernity, preparing people for detached 
thinking, for freedom. Does it lead to disin- 
tegration or to synthesis? Is it a search for com- 
promise between what is inside and what is 
outside, between old and new, or is it a source 
of great tension which destroys all sense of 
continuity? 
~ Initially, to my mind, we have to talk in 
terms of making a clean break. We must do 
this to shock people and make them think. 
Later we must try to look for common 
ground. Above all we must stop posing as 
victims of the West and behaving negatively 
towards the West. We must participate with 
the West on an equal footing in the reconstruc: 
tion of the world. We must have our say, not 
through violence, aggression or fear. We must 
speak out calmly and forcefully. We shall only 
be able to enter the new world era if we agree 
to engage in dialogue with the other side. It 
is through accepting other people in our own 
countries that we shall come to respect our 
neighbours and be respected in our turn. Then 
we shall be able to imagine our common 
future together. If we want the state to respect 
and guarantee human rights, we must respect 
one another first. The newborn child must see 
men showing respect for women, for example, 
and vice versa. 
Bm [5 your own work an attempt to break 
things apart or to see things whole? 
— I came to poetry through the urgent need 
to denounce injustice, exploitation, humilia- 
tion. [ know that’s not enough to change the 
world. But to remain silent would have been 
a kind of intolerable complicity. 
The break is there: a break with the litany 
of silences. Uttering in poetry the desire for 
a more human world, while recognizing the 
limits of literature. And yet one must write, 
even and above all if human beings are not 
particularly good or decent. 
B® Which characters and which themes in 
your work are most representative of your 
attitude? 
— My characters are often driven by a pas- 
sionate desire for justice. They are rebellious 
and incorruptible. I would cite two of them, 
a woman, Harrouda, and a man, Moha. Fach 
of them, in different books, bears witness to 
the wounds of the peoples of the Maghreb. 
Perhaps they are marginal, but they forcefully 
express a passion for truth and dignity. When 
[think about my work with a certain detach- 
ment, I realize that I have written about the 
dispossessed, the condition of immigrants, the 
condition of women who do not enjoy the 
same legal rights as men, the Palestinians who 
are deprived of their land and condemned to 
exile and despair. Even in the short book I 
wrote about the sculptor Giacometti [ deve- 
loped these main themes, themes of solitude 
and anguish. 
I who love life in spite of all that mars it, 
I who love friendship, jokes and laughter, actu- 
ally write about wounds, the eternal treasons 
of life. It’s not very funny but it’s sincere. My 
commitment 1s to sincerity.

SEA FEVER

### 89093: Sea fever

¢ 
I; they but knew, almost all men in their degree, some time 
or other, cherish very nearly the same feeling toward the ocean 
with me,” says Ishmael, the narrator of Herman Melville’s great 
novel Moby Dick. Melville was alluding to a universal bond 
between people and their ocean, though he readily admitted 
many of his contemporaries were unaware of it. 
What are the reasons for this bond? Some scientists believe 
that our reactions may have something to do with the sound 
waves emitted by water. Others feel there is a connection with 
the visual appeal of water. Water is playful and refreshing. For 
most of us it is an essential ingredient of natural beauty. 
Our feelings for the sea seem to reflect intuitively the impor- 
tance of water to life. Water made life possible on Earth. 
Without it there would have been no atmosphere, and condi- 
tions on the planet would have been too extreme to make life 
possible. Life probably originated in water, and we still carry 
traces of these origins. The blood that runs through our veins 
is similar in the composition of its salts to sea water. So is the 
amniotic fluid in which the human embryo floats for the dura- 
tion of its gestation period. No wonder then that babies appear 
to thoroughly enjoy a warm bath, as though it were a return 
to the maternal womb. 
Some scientists believe that there may even have been an 
aquatic phase in our evolution. In their view, our ancestors may 
have spent a good deal of their time in the balmy waters of 
tropical seas rather than in trees or on grass flats. The theory 
is by no means universally accepted, but it would help explain 
our attraction to the sea and our kinship with dolphins and 
whales, mammals that joined the migration to the sea but stayed 
there and readapted to fish-like forms and habits. 
If any of the above is true, our feelings toward the ocean 
should be universal. And that is what this issue of the UNESCO 
Courier seeks to explore. By examining the role of the ocean 
in the human imagination, it looks for similarities in the ways 
in which people in different parts of the world have sought to 
express their feelings about the sea. Are there themes common 
to sea stories of the distant past and their modern equivalents? 
What about cultural divisions? Are there, for instance, similar- 
ities between the attitudes towards the sea of the Polynesians, 
who have always been surrounded by water, and the Chinese? 
In the last few decades there have been dramatic changes 
in our uses of the sea. Driven by a need for more space and 
resources, we built machinery to explore and exploit the sea, 
even to its deepest reaches. We apportioned and reapportioned 
it, and sought to live or relax along its shores in ever growing 
numbers. And finally we acquired the ability to affect and even 
change it. 
Much of this was, at least initially, accompanied by a sense 
of optimism. During the 1960s, the annual food yield from the 
sea increased rapidly. New and valuable mineral and energy 
resources were discovered, and later recovered, from the sea 
floor. Marine transportation methods were revolutionized. New 
uses of the ocean were proposed and studied: obtaining clean 
energy from the difference in temperature between warm sur- 
face layers and cold deep waters, for instance, or from tides and 
waves; recovering new and promising drugs from a variety of 
marine organisms; or disposing of certain wastes, safely and 
effectively, in the ocean environment. 
But soon this sense of optimism was marred by a number 
of incidents. Just over thirty years ago the Minamata incident 
shocked the world. People living in or near the Japanese town 
of that name were poisoned, killed or crippled for life by indus- 
trial pollutants discharged into the sea and returned to them 
through the marine food chain. Shortly thereafter, other inci- 
dents occurred, seemingly with increasing frequency. There was 
concern over radioactive contamination caused by the fallout 
from nuclear tests. Pesticides such as DDT began to affect the 
coastal environment. Valuable fish stocks disappeared, fished 
to near-ruin by increasingly effective fishing methods. Massive 
oil spills, from platforms as well as vessel accidents, smothered 
beaches and birds, causing a public outcry and providing visible 
evidence for the first time that there were limits to human 
domination of the sea. No matter how much we may think 
we control the sea, it has many ways of reminding us that it 
will always have the last word. 
The development of mass communications, especially of 
television, has greatly affected our perception of the sea to the 
extent that we no longer need to be at sea, or even see it in 
person, to experience its mysteries. As a result of television 
today’s generation knows more about the sea than any before, 
although the information is not necessarily based on first-hand 
experience; nor 1s it always of high quality. 
Today the ocean is perceived less as a place of danger and 
menace than as a beautiful, romantic place where it is possible 
to live and relax. In it live creatures not like Moby Dick, the 
threatening monster that sank Captain Ahab’s ship, but gentle, 
singing whales. In an age when sea travel has become far safer 
than 1t once was, we relive the fear of shipwreck in the com- 
fort of our living rooms. We feel more comfortable and familiar 
with the sea, and yet at the same time we want it to remain 
mysterious. What lurks beneath the surface, in the eternal 
darkness of the abyss? L.C. N 
LUC CUYVERS is a Belgian writer and film producer who specializes in marine 
and maritime affairs. He is president of the Mare Nostrum Foundation, a non- 
profit educational organization created to inform the general public about ocean 
resource issues. He is the author of 4 books and numerous articles on the ocean, 
and recently completed an 8-part international television series on man’s rela- 
tionship with the sea, entitled The Blue Revolution. 11

things I already knew. I repeat, ].M.D. Solitude and I have 13

the same past and the same present. What I found in the note- 
book resembled my own memory: a leitmotiv of the sea as set 
down in a private iconography. From it I reproduce three 
fragments at random. 
  
III. Looking at the sea . . . 
When one is seventeen years old and comes from the Masca- 
rene Islands, strewn like pieces of rock or lava off the southeast 
coast of Africa, one fast feels all but cursed, as though doomed 
to go round in circles for ever. Distances are not distances but 
a number of spans. After closing books and magazines, and espe- 
cially the big illustrated encyclopaedia with reproductions, 
maps, names of countries and words never seen before—at ship 
alone: binnacle and bobstay, crossjack and garboard, jibboom 
and sheer strake, spanker gaff, stanchion—; on coming out of 
the cinema, after seeing Geronimo, Mutiny on the Bounty, Pépé 
le Moko and The Count of Monte-Cristo and a ragbag of westerns, 
both silents and talkies, Indian films and Egyptian films, which 
carry you off to worlds and lands and great ports open to every 
fantasy, where you are attacked by the most malignant form 
of inanition there is—that hungering after departure which 
pounds in your head, in your heart, in your guts—you end up 
inventing “‘solitudes crowded with loneliness”, to quote the 
poignant title of a book by the Black American beat poet, Bob 
‘Kaufman. 
And so, to ward off ill fortune, you go down to the sea. 
You choose twilight because of the sun dipping behind the 
horizon to drink, leaving behind it long minutes of a light so 
special that, in describing it, one is unsure whether to compare 
it with flames or gémbers. Then, when evening rises from the 
calm waters of the harbour, the merchant ships and the occa- 
sional ocean liners, berthed or anchored off shore, light up one 
after the other. The world catches fire. Fascination increases. 
Imagination runs wild. Dreams become a kind of madness. You 
go on board; you embark for Genoa, Marseilles, Lisbon, 
Southampton, Amsterdam. . . . At last you're going to know 
the big ports. You'll be Christopher Columbus, Magellan, 
Vasco da Gama, Amerigo Vespucci, Diego Cao. . . . On deck, 
you look back to give a last wave to your friends left behind 
on the pier. Once in your cabin, you touch the bulkheads with 
the flat of your hands and the iron rivets with your fingers to 
make sure that you're really on your way and you take one 
last look through the porthole: how small the island is! You 
tell yourself that you're no longer cursed because you're going 
to see what’s on the other side of the water. . .. You repeat 
it to yourself in creole: lote koté dilo. . . . 
But this is how it is: at each twilight, the other side of the 
 
water is a sheer sky wall against which the ship runs aground. 
Now is still not time to leave. You'll have to come back 
tomorrow . . . and come back again . . . and yet again. 
One day I, ]. M.D. Solitude, will no longer go back to look 
at the sea; the boot will be on the other foot. The curse will 
no longer spring from the cramped feeling of the island but 
from the gigantism of metropolises visited all too many times, 
from an immensity in which something vital will be lacking; 
a patch of land, a garden at the end of the ocean. . . . 
 
VII. Golgotha amid the waves 
I see the Sacred Hill as the crest of an Atlantic wave. The cross 
carried by a man crowned with thorns is a slave ship advancing 
beneath the exertions of men chained naked to their oars. The 
cries of the crowd are beats struck on a huge bilge drum to 
set the stroke. Flagellation is matched by whipping. That one 
was sold for thirty pieces of silver, this one for thirty pennies, 
perhaps less. One was crucified, the other flayed or burned alive.

Christ was called Jesus, the slave was called nobody. One was 
denied, the other was negation in person. And more than one 
Pontius Pilate still washes his hands today before other Passions. 
Whenever I think of this, my mind goes back to those lines 
by René-Guy Cadou, dead at the age of thirty and buried in 
the humble cemetery of Louisfert, in Brittany: 
“If they could do that to the King of the Jews 
What wouldn't they do to a poor nigger. . ..” 
and it occurs to me that those who most desecrated the seaways 
were not pirates and that Gorée isn’t so far from Gethsemane. 
  


### 89094: Fragments for a private iconography of the sea

IX. The bird from the sea 
At noon, on the Senegalese coast, at Cayar, near Dakar, I walk 
side by side with Jacques Howlett. We have deserted a talking 
shop on negritude, organized on the occasion of the First World 
Festival of Negro Arts. Wrongly or rightly, we thought it more 
profitable to come and listen to the sea than to have our minds 
plugged with critical comment. He tells me about the latest 
  
manuscripts received at Présence Africaine of which he has long 
been a pillar. But very soon we realize how beside the point 
it is to be talking about literature when the sea is there in all 
its splendour beneath the raw sun. 
Silence! . . . 
We walk, dazzled by the glare from the white sand. Only 
the sight of the worm-eaten wood of a few abandoned boats, 
too old to be any use, their colours high and dry, offers some 
relief to our eyes. It'll be a long time yet before the return of 
those that went out at first light to cast their nets offshore. 
They'll be back at the end of the day. To our great regret, we 
shan’t be witnessing their noisy, turbulent ritual as they come 
through the channel. A fight with the waves just a few yards 
away from the shore. Each time, the blessed insolence of the 
boatmen, cocking a snook at the swell. No, we shan’t be seeing 
any of that. 
But a strange voice interrupts the silence. A sort of muted 
chanting. Jacques and I start searching between the skeletons 
of the boats and discover an old man sitting on a stone, a chisel 
in his hand, working away at a piece of wood clamped between 
his knobbly knees. He accompanies each of his movements, 
each incision in the wood, with a guttural threnody, mournful, 
slow or animated according to how gently or violently the tool 
penetrates the heart of the wood. 
He goes on working for a few moments as though not 
aware that we are watching him. Then, slowly, he lifts his head 
and with a movement of the chin acknowledges our presence. 
He then goes back to his sculpture. Qur attention is focused 
mainly on his chant, trying to understand its meaning. It grows 
in intensity as, beneath his carvings, a bird’s head emerges from 
the block of wood. We no longer care about time slipping by, 
transported as we are by the rite unfolding before our eyes. 
Now the hornbill’s features can clearly be seen. The old 
man puts down his tool in order to take a closer look at his 
work. His eyes dwell on every angle. Then with his skinny 
fingers he strokes every detail, staring straight ahead now at 
the sea. He seems elsewhere. . . . He gets up, about to leave. 
I can no longer restrain myself. I call him: 
“Tell me, grandad, what were those words you were 
chanting just now?” 
“I was just calling to the bird hidden in the piece of wood. 
Without words, son, you can dig away as much as you like 
with the chisel. Nothing will come if you don’t call, especially 
when you're working before the sea. . ..” 
Saying this, he went off, carrying with him at arm’s length 
the bird’s head, surely destined to become the first piece of a 
weather vane fixed on the prow of a boat to indicate the direc- 
tion of the wind. 
I didn’t like to ask him why “especially before the sea”.

### 89095: The Wondrous deep

The sea has always inspired a sense 
of awe. Some peoples have 
~ responded eagerly to its call, while 
others have remained firmly attached 
to the land. For desert peoples like 
the Arabs it was a source of fear and 
wonder; the Chinese, for all the 
glorious chapters in their maritime 
history, pursued their destiny 
essentially on land. Many of the 
world’s cultures have risen from the 
~ waves: Polynesian civilization was 
propagated by some of the most 
intrepid and skilful seafarers ever 
g known. The Greek sailors who ply 
the seven seas today continue a 
tradition which can be traced back to 
Homeric times. ;   
The wondrous deep 
|. classical times the seas of Islam represented 
another world and, for the Arabs, who were the 
sons of nomads and had lived on the land since 
time immemorial, it was a dual world. At once 
close and familiar when seen from the shore, it 
became an object of terror when on all sides there 
was nothing but water extending to the horizon. 
Subject to laws beyond good and evil, the marine 
world was considered to be situated at the very 
edge of the habitable universe. There members 
of the same species and indeed of the same family 
tore one another to pieces and pursued each other 
mercilessly. The Dadjal (the Antichrist) beat his 
drums in the suffocating heat of bewitched 
islands. Satan was not far. Perhaps, when all was 
said and done, it was he who ruled beneath the 
waters. 
The earliest references to the sea in Arab 
poetry reflect this hostile world, beyond the 
compass of the human mind. The poet Al 
Muhalhil issued a warning which was to become 
the leitmotiv of relations between the Arab imagi- 
nation and the sea: “Setting sail on the sea 
without taking care/Is a sure way of courting 
disaster.” 
For the early Arab poets the sea was also the 
supreme symbol of strength and power. The pre- 
Islamic poet Malik Ibn Nuweyra describes an 
attack made by his tribe against an enemy camp 
in the following terms: “They saw us arrive with 
the first dawn rays/More ruinous yet than the 
foaming seas”. And Antara Ibn Shaddad 
recounting a battle enjoins: “Question them as 
to my valour/When the tribes of Kalb, of Ghaniy 
and Amir/Came crashing down like waves. ...” 
The advent of Islam hardly affected the Arab 
image of the sea. It is often described in the 
Qur’an as an emblem of divine power or benevo- 
lence and the sea in fury is seen as denoting the 
Apocalypse: “When heaven is split open, when 
the stars are scattered, when the seas swarm 
over. ...” (Surat 82, verses 1 to 3); “When the 
sun shall be darkened, when the stars shall be 
thrown down . . . when the seas shall be set 
boiling. . . .” (Surat 81, verses 1, 2 and 5). 
The waves (Mawdj, Amwad)) are an image 
of extreme danger. The Arabic root “M.W.D]J.” 
covers a semantic field dominated by ideas of 
imbalance, upheaval, agitation, turmoil and 
storm. The term crops up many times in the 
Qur'an: “And when waves cover them like 
shadows, they call upon God...” (Surat 31, verse 
32); “And waves come on them from every side,

and they think they are encompassed; they call 
upon God . . . : ‘If Thou deliverest us from these, 
surely we shall be among the thankful’ (Surat 
10, verse 22). 
The Hadith (the words of the Prophet) sound 
the same note: “He who takes to the sea in 
stormy weather has only himself to blame”. 
TRAVELLERS AND 
STORYTELLERS 
The Arabs were not seafarers, even though their 
early traditions reveal some familiarity with the 
world of the sea and the Qur'an evokes the 
dangers and riches of the ocean to illustrate the 
power and bounteousness of God. The Prophet’s 
by Rachid Sabbaghi 
tribe, the Quraysh, no doubt already had sea links 
with Abyssinia via the Red Sea. But, as scholars 
such as W. Barthold and G. Hourani have shown, 
there appears to be little doubt that they did not 
have any ships of their own. They were, for 
example, incapable of going after fugitives who 
took to the sea. When the Empire was founded, 
the Arabs had to rely on the knowledge of the 
Egyptian Copts to establish their first naval fleet 
in the Mediterranean. 
However, until the Ottomans came to power 
the Mediterranean was considered to be of only 
marginal interest and held by the Caliphate to 
be not directly relevant to its ambitions. The 
Arabs had their first real experience of the sea 
in the Great Eastern Sea (Al Bahr Sharqui Al 
Kabir), that part of the Indian Ocean which 
extends from the coast of India to East Africa, 
including its two branches formed by the Gulf 
and the Red Sea. The most notable contribution 
made by Arab navigators and geographers related 
to knowledge of this sea. 
The Arabs had from very early times acted 
as middlemen in the far-flung trade between the 
East (India, China, Ceylon, Java) and the West 
(Egypt, Syria, Rome). However, after Baghdad 
had been founded (762 AD) and the ports of Basra 
and Siraf had been developed, they started to 
trade on their own account, from Hang-chou in 
the Far East to Sofala on the east coast of Africa. 
Those who first taught the Arabs seamanship 
were doubtless the Persians who under the 
Sasanids had formed a true maritime aristocracy 
all around the western part of that same Great 
Eastern Sea. : 
By the ninth century, when the Abbasids 
were at the height of their power, the Arabs had 
fully mastered and perhaps progressed beyond the 
available stock of knowledge about the sea. Their 
navigators had by then acquired a fairly rigorous 
understanding of monsoons and winds. They no 
longer made do with plying up and down the 
coast but sailed directly from the Arabian coast 
to the confines of the Indian peninsula; the straits 
lying between the Gulf and the China Sea were 
well known to them. Similarly, black Africa was 
no longer altogether a terra incognita; their ships 
sailed from Aden in East Africa all the way to 
Sofala (or Sofalat al Zindj as it was known to 
Arab geographers). They also plied the Red Sea, 
the Mediterranean, the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea 
and a number of navigable rivers like the Nile 
and the Indus. 17

### 89095: The Wondrous deep

The widespread use of nautical charts (Rah- 
manis) and manuals (Dafatirs) dates from this 
period. In his The Meadows of Gold and Mines of 
Gems, Mas’udi, the great tenth-century ency- 
clopaedist and traveller, gives the names of a large 
number of Nakhuda (ship captains) and specialists 
on the Indian Ocean with whom he was per- 
sonally acquainted. It was also a golden age for 
sea literature, travellers’ tales and descriptions of 
wondrous things (“Mirabilia”} in which the sea 
had a central part. Few have survived. One of the 
earliest travellers’ tales is that attributed to the 
merchant Suleyman, who made several journeys 
to India and China and described his impressions 
of the countries he visited and the peoples he 
encountered in his Akhbar Al-Sin wa Al Hind 
(Account of China and India). 
Another interesting author of that period is 
Buzurg ibn Shahriyar. Himself a ship captain, in 
around 953 AD he compiled an anthology of tales 
of the sea entitled Kitab Adja’ib Al Hind which 
contains several curious stories about the adven- 
tures of sailors in the East Indies and other parts 
of the Indian Ocean. Intended for the common 
reader, mingling actual experience and fiction, 
Buzurg’s tales largely belong to the genre known 
as “Adj’aib” (“Mirabilia”) which was much in 
vogue at the time. 
The Thousand and One Nights, the first com- 
pilations of which, according to the specialists, 
date from the ninth century, contain a number 
of tales centring on the sea, including the famous 
“Adventures of Sindbad the Sailor”. The Egyp- 
tian oceanographer and man of letters Hussein 
Fawzi has shown, in a splendidly erudite book 
(Le discours de Sindbad l'ancien, 1942), the distinc- 
tively Arab qualities of this story and its inter 
textual references to contemporary Arab mari- 
time literature, making it a kind of bible of nau- 
tical knowledge for that period. 
THE WAY OF WONDERS 
What were Muslim Arab navigators and traders 
looking for in such far-off lands as Japan and 
Madagascar? The “wondrous” merchandise with 
which, according to travellers and geographers, 
those countries abounded, ranging from silk in 
China to ebony in the Wak-Wak islands (Borneo, . 
the Philippines), from topazes and rubies in 
Sirandib (Ceylon) to tin in the peninsula of 
Malacca. As commonplace as such goods may 
seem today, for travellers at that time they were 
fabulous treasures, full of enchantment and magic. 
Many passages in the Thousand and One 
Nights bear witness to this. But Sindbad also 
travels in quest of knowledge, roused by the call 
of distant lands, the lure of the unknown, the 
mystery of otherness. 
The Indian Ocean which was the doorway 
to these Jands of plenty was also swarming with 
Bawaridj, the pirate ships that plied its waters, 
and its islands were inhabited by cannibals. We 
are told by the author of the Summary of Wonders 
that “To the right of the island of Kalah lies the 
island of Balus. Its inhabitants eat human flesh”, 
while in the words of al-Idrisi, “The denizens of 
this island (Baltus) are black and go naked. . .. 
Should a foreigner chance upon them, they hang 
him up by the feet, cut him into pieces and eat 
him. . . . Their speech is incomprehensible”. 
The skies above this sea are sometimes dar- 
kened by the open wings of huge birds known 
as Rukh or Anka (Pheng to the Chinese and 
Simorg to the Persians). According to al-Kazwini, 
“The Anka is the largest bird there is. It hunts 
elephants, whales and dragons. When it flies, its 
wings make a noise like a torrent. When it spreads 
its wings, the sun is hidden and the sky is 
darkened”. 
Travellers of the period tell us of other sea 
monsters that infested the depths of the Great 
Eastern Sea. Some were so big that “from head 
to tail is a four-month voyage”. From afar the

giant turtles resembled islands. A merchant left 
the following eye-witness account: “We found in 
the middle of the sea an island on which grass 
grew protruding from the water. We landed and 
prepared to eat. The island started to move. The 
sailors shouted ‘Back to the ship! Back to the ship! 
It’s a turtle, awakened by the fire for the meal. 
. . . Back to the ship before it plunges beneath 
the water!” ” 
On the Wak-Wak islands strange trees were 
said to grow whose fruit took the form of women 
which died a few hours after being picked but 
not before providing the famished traveller with 
intense and mysterious pleasures: “On these 
islands there are trees which bear as their fruit

exists, it 1s subject to divine law—the ultimate 
guarantee that the world has a meaning, and it 
was this law that travellers, geographers and cos- 
mographers always thought they were obeying 
when they embarked on their journeys. In so 
doing, they were bringing their intelligence to 
bear on the visible signs of creation, trusting in 
the benevolence of God to take care of everything 
that exceeded the bounds set by Him upon that 
intelligence. N 
Sindbad’'s maiden voyage 
One day when we were under sail we found 
ourselves becalmed before a small island lying 
just above the water and covered with 
verdure like a meadow. The captain bad the 
sails lowered and informed the members of 
the crew that those who wished to go ashore 
could do so. I was one of those who availed 
themselves of the opportunity. However, just 
as we were pleasantly engaged in eating and 
drinking and resting our weary limbs, the 
island suddenly shook all over and made us 
reel. . . 
«+ « The shudder that passed through the 
island was not unnoticed on the boat; from it 
cries arose telling us to go back on board at 
once lest we perish; that what we had taken 
for an island was the back of a whale. The 
quickest on their feet made off in the rowing 
boat, others went swimming away. I for my 
part was still on the island, or rather on the 
whale, when it plunged into the sea, and I 
just had time ro seize hold of a piece of wood 
that been brought from the boat to make a 
fire. However, the captain, after taking on 
board those who were in the rowing boat and 
rescuing some of those who were swimming, 
wanted to take advantage of the favourable 
fresh wind that had started up; he had the 
sails raised and in so doing robbed me of 
any hope of getting back to the boat. 
So I remained at the mercy of the waves, 
driven first one way then another; I fought 
“with them for my life for the rest of the day 
and the following night. The next day I no 
longer had any strength and was giving up 
all hope of avoiding death when happily a 
wave cast me upon an island.

The legacy of 
   
Aco China was a landlocked state and its 
expansion to the coast opened a new chapter in 
Chinese history. Rule of the sea was achieved 
under the T’ang dynasty (618-906 AD) and mar- 
itime expansion continued under the Sung 
(960-1279 AD). Sung seamanship became a 
byword for excellence in the Asian maritime 
world, but Chinese technological superiority 
endured many challenges both on land and at sea, 
and the Mongol conquest of the Southern Sung 
ushered in the Yiian dynasty and brought the first 
hint of a naval threat that eventually reduced 
China to almost semi-colonial status. 
During the early Ming dynasty (1368-1644 
AD), the Chinese state sponsored epic maritime 
expeditions which took hundreds of ships and 
tens of thousands of men to countries as far away 
as East Africa. Chinese emissaries played the role 
of arbitrators in Ceylon and Sumatra, and in 
return over sixty embassies visited China within 
a short space of time, many bearing gifts of

design, which depended so heavily on state 
patronage, leadership and finance, lost its staun- 
chest and most energetic patron when the Yung- 
lo emperor died in 1423, although voyages con- 
tinued under Hsiian-te. No royal patron, court 
official or private adventurer ever emerged to 
resume or indeed to finance such expeditions 
again. 
Instead of going on to develop the maritime 
empire that had seemed to lie within its reach, 
China now turned its back to the sea. The reasons 
for this were historical, ideological and perhaps 
even temperamental. One reason may have been 
an intrinsic lack of interest in the sea on the part 
of the Chinese, for never again in Chinese his- 
tory were such proclivities for maritime expan- 
sion to be revealed. Another may be found in the 
Confucian ethos which held trade and mercan- 
tile concerns in low esteem. The Chinese never 
considered trade to be a source of the state’s

domestic power, and merchants were never 
thought worthy of a leading role in state-building. 
A partnership between the state and the mer- 
chants in an overseas adventure for national glory 
or profit would have meant turning the whole 
Chinese social order and value system upside 
down. 
A COUNTRY WITH ITS BACK 
TO THE SEA 
As it turned away from the sea and concentrated 
on the defence of its land frontiers and the reor- 
ganization of its finances, China lost the initia- 
tive in the East Asian maritime world. In the six- 
teenth and seventeenth centuries, a new maritime 
order developed in the region. Led by the 
Japanese and closely followed by the Europeans, 
it was driven by the profit motive. The new Euro- 
pean masters of the Asian seas were soon 
clamouring for concessions at the gates of China.

The Ming government, already predisposed 
towards a defensive maritime policy, closed the 
major ports and evacuated the coastal population 
inland. 
"For the next 200 years, the coast of China 
became a shady world, peopled by fidalgos (Por- 
tuguese noblemen), burghers, Wakoes (Japanese 
pirates), marauders and conniving merchants and 
officials, with in their midst perhaps a few honest 
traders and people earning a living from the sea. 
It was a world of romance, terror, treachery and 
illicit gain, dominated by the so-called “merchant 
princes” who amassed fortunes from the inter- 
Asian carrying trade, thereby building up polit- 
ical power and becoming virtually the paymasters 
of local officials. 
The new rulers of China after 1644, the 
Manchus at the head of the Ch’ing dynasty, were 
without experience of the sea and had inherited 
a maritime world which the late Ming had aban- 
doned to private trade and local autonomy. They 
took forty years to pacify the south, but when 
this was done they returned the people to the 
coast and repealed the prohibition against 
overseas navigation. At the same time they 
adopted an open-door policy by opening four 
22 ports to foreign trade. 
    
THE CHINA TRADE 
By the late seventeenth century, the Dutch and 
Spanish had been driven from the trading stations 
they had established on the China coast and their 
places taken by the English (from the 1670s) and 
the French (after 1699). In the 1720s came the 
Ostenders, who were later followed by Dutch, 
Danes, Swedes and others, under the flags of their 
East India Companies. As European trade with 
China developed, it was brought under semi- 
official management by a system of controls and 
regulations, the most intense period of legislation 
being from 1740 to 1760. 
European trade with China between 1684 and 
the First Opium War in 1839 marked a revolu- 
tion in the maritime history of China. After a 
break of 250 years the Chinese state was again 
turning its attention to the sea. This was the great 
era of trade in China tea, which displaced spices, 
pepper and Chinese silk as Europe’s leading 
import from East Asia. A distinctive hybrid 
between “official trade” and “private trade” was 
devised by the Ch’ing to meet importunate 
Western demands, to safeguard the livelihood of 
Chinese coastal peoples and to maintain the secu- 
rity of the coast. The relationship between

Chinese merchants and the Europeans during this 
long period was generally peaceful for, despite 
their diametrically opposed views about the place 
of trade and merchants in society, both European 
mercantilism and Chinese Confucianism advo- 
cated active state intervention and a monopolistic 
system as the means of attaining their ends. 
From the beginning, the Ch’ing correctly 
judged the maritime frontier to be the most likely 
source of their major domestic and foreign policy 
difficulties and acted accordingly. But as time 
went by they found security in a conservative 
orthodoxy, and when China was exposed by sea 
to all that was new and changing in the late eight- 
eenth century, they failed to respond to the 
stimulus and missed the chance to join the new 
world order. 
The traditional world order was challenged 
by the new. After 1826 a rapid increase in imports

industrial goods and equipment and, most damag- 
ingly, consumer goods, served to highlight the 
importance of merchants, industry and trade to 
the national wealth of Western countries, whereas 
industrial development was a concept that did not 
exist in the Ch’ing official vocabulary. Finally, 
China had not realized that it was necessary to 
maintain her technology—she was humiliated in 
the nineteenth century by a few gunboats 
despatched to her shores by “barbarians” from 
outside. 
The dockyard at Foochow that produced out- 
dated warships, some of which sank on going 
down the slipway, the fleet that remained idle at 
one port while another fleet was being destroyed 
elsewhere on the coast, and several unsuccessful 
major industrial enterprises symbolized the failure 
of a country that had once been technologically 
advanced to make up for more than five centuries 
of neglect. Foreign warships, merchant ships, pas- 
senger and freight steamers frequented Chinese 
ports and sailed upriver at will. Finally, the total 
defeat of China at sea in the Sino-Japanese War of 
1894-1895 raised the key question of whether eco- 
nomic and military reforms can be achieved 
without political and institutional reforms. HW

How merchants travel 
Upon a vessel four decks are built. The vessel 
is fitted out with rooms, cabins and saloons 
for merchants. Several of the cabins contain 
private rooms and conveniences. There are 
keys for the cabins, which are locked by their 
owners. The merchants bring their 
concubines and wives along with them. 
Often there will be one person in his cabin 
without any other person on board knowing 
that he is there, and it is not until they 
arrive at their destination that people find 
that they have been voyaging together. 
The sailors have their children living in 
these cabins; they plant pot herbs, vegetables 
and ginger in wooden tubs. The ship’s 
steward has the appearance of a great emir; 
when be goes ashore, archers and Abyssinians 
walk before him with javelins, swords, 
kettledrums, horns and trumpets. Upon his 
arriving at the inn where be is to be lodged, 
they plant their lances on either side of the 
door and continue to behave in this manner 
throughout his stay. Among the inhabitants 
of China there are some who own many 
ships on which they send their message- 
bearers abroad. The Chinese are the richest 
people in the world.

### 89097: In the wake of Ulysses

In the wake of Ulysses 
by Andre Kedros 
Tee are some 2,000 Greek islands. Most of 
them are barren rocks. Some lack fresh water and 
are uninhabited. But ever since the earliest times 
Greeks have lived in the largest and most beau- 
tiful of them and Greek civilization has flourished 
there. A people with so many islands is bound 
to have special links with the sea. 
The Greeks were bold seafarers long before 
the Phoenicians came on the scene. Like the wan- 
derings of Ulysses, the mythical expedition of 
Jason and the Argonauts, the heroes who sailed 
aboard the Argo to recover the Golden Fleece, 
is inspired by early Greek exploration of the 
Mediterranean. We owe a late account of this 
expedition to Apollonius of Rhodes, who was 
born around 295 BC. We can be sure that Homer, 
who 1s thought to have lived five centuries before, 
knew an earlier version of the exploits of the 
Argonauts. The sorceress Circe living on the 
island of Aeaea, the dangerous strait of Scylla and 
Charybdis, and the Sirens, all feature in the 
Odyssey but also appear in the voyage of the 
Argonauts, which was recorded long before. 
7X Le Xi, 
  
The small sailboats of Antiquity and rowing 
vessels like the longship Argo were sturdily built. 
Greek sailors trusted them implicitly. They knew 
all about the dominant winds and currents, but 
Poseidon the sea-god was given to sudden terrible 
rages. As they plied the seas far from their 
homeland, Jason, Ulysses and their companions 
faced terrible dangers. It took far more courage 
to set out on a long voyage without maps or 
compass and brave violent storms than it did to 
fight against the King of Colchis or the Trojans. 
These journeys were plagued by hunger, thirst, 
fatigue and stress. . . . How else can we explain 
the fact that Ulysses weeps so often? 
When storms blew up, the Greeks depended 
on skilful seamanship to save them. Without a 
steady hand on the tiller all was lost. The Greeks 
have never been good swimmers and shipwreck 
would almost invariably be fatal. Ulysses himself 
barely escapes drowning on two occasions. 
Ulysses has angered Zeus. The god hurls a 
thunderbolt at his ship, which is shattered to 
pieces. Billowing waves sweep the crew into the 
sea. Ulysses, the only survivor, clings to a piece 
of wreckage. A gust of wind blows him towards 
the strait guarded by Scylla and the whirlpool 
Charybdis, who swallows up the debris of the 
ship. Ulysses just manages to grasp a fig-tree 
growing on the rocks above the waves. Then 
Charybdis spits back the mast and the keel, and 
Ulysses continues his adventurous wanderings. 
But before long the son of Laertes falls victim 
to the anger of another god, Poseidon, who has 
long been persecuting him. 
Aboard the raft which the nymph Calypso has 
unwillingly allowed him to build, Ulysses comes 
in sight of the land of the Phaeacians. Suddenly 
a violent gust of wind breaks up his fragile craft. 
Ulysses manages to haul himself on to a plank but 
he 1s battered by the waves and is soon overcome 
by exhaustion. Leucothea, the white goddess, 
saves him in the nick of time. She gives him her 
veil to tie around his waist, and he manages to 
swim through the stormy sea to Phaeacia.

### 89097: In the wake of Ulysses

eS 
Many Greek sailors over the centuries in 
similar perilous situations to those described in 
the Odyssey have lost their lives because they did 
not know how to swim. This failing, which I 
have often noticed among fishermen and sailors 
serving in one of the world’s biggest fleets of mer- 
chant ships, is particularly surprising since the 
Greeks are outstanding divers. 
SPONGE DIVERS 
In ancient times, sponge diving was practised in 
Greece more widely than it is today. Sponges 
were used for various, and sometimes unusual, 
purposes. Soldiers drank from them when they 
had no goblets and made them into protective 
cushions which they wore beneath their armour. 
Today synthetic sponges compete with natural 
sponges. Nevertheless, beautiful women still 
prefer real sponges, as do painters, craftsmen, 
polishers, cabinet-makers and surgeons. 
Sponge divers can still be found on some 
Greek islands such as Kalymnos and Skyros, 
where their marvellous but arduous skills are 
\ i Rn A = 2 
handed down from father to son. The only differ- 
ence is that they have to sail further and further 
away, near to the coast of Cyprus or Libya. And 
they must dive deeper and deeper. The old men 
» remember the time when they used to skin-dive 
to find sponges 30 metres underwater. Today 
their successors have to dive more than 60 metres, 
wearing diving suits and other equipment. Their 
outfits are often the worse for wear, and accidents 
are frequent. The men’s health suffers. On the 
quayside of the port of Kalymnos, old men of 
forty can often be seen. 
THE ANGER 
OF POSEIDON 
Thousands of Greek sailors serve in the merchant 
navy. Many of them accept low wages to work in 
old tubs which often sail under flags of con- 
venience and which they describe among them- 
selves as floating coffins. 
When one of these decrepit hulks runs into 
a storm the crew need all the courage they can 
find. Heavy seas pound the deck murderously. 25

Flying Dutchman which haunts the imagination 
of northern seamen. It’s not ghost captains that 
they fear but real ones who let themselves be cor- 
rupted by cynical shipowners and deliberately 
sink their ships on desert island reefs. Barratry, 
the fraudulent breach of duty by the master of 
a ship, which often endangers the life of the crew, 
is still relatively frequent. The older the ship, the 
greater the temptation to barratry. The sailors 
know this and are secretly afraid. 
Of course not all shipowners are so 
unscrupulous. Many of them have combined 
their maritime instinct with a genius for business 
and have become very rich without infringing the 
laws of trade. 
A VISION OF THE SEA 


### 89097: In the wake of Ulysses

Greek shipowners, sailors and fishermen make 
their living from the sea. But the Greek people 
as 2a whole also lives from the sea, albeit indirectly. 
Greece has profited from the tourist boom 
more than most countries. Hundreds of thou- 
sands of foreigners spend their holidays there each 
year. What are they looking for? Archaeological 
sites such as Delphi, Mycenae and Delos are still 
a magnet for visitors. The beautiful marble of 
ancient temples, theatres and statues bears wit- 
ness to the cult of beauty in a distant past and 
glows in the soft light of the present. But more 
and more tourists are flocking to Greece to realize 
an ideal vision of the sea. They head for the Greek 
islands to escape from oil-polluted beaches and 
the dirt of the big city, hoping to bathe in trans- 
parent waters and make friends with the Greeks 
who live in close contact with the sea. (Even if 
they do not bathe in it, for the good reason that 
they cannot swim). 
One myth that symbolizes perhaps more 
than any other the extraordinary symbiosis of the 
Greeks with the sea, as well as their inadequacy 
as swimmers, it is that of Orion, son of Hyrieus 
king of Boeotia. Orion was a giant who walked 
across the sea from island to island without ever 
getting out of his depth. One day when Apollo 
was engaged in an archery contest on the beach 
with his sister Artemis, the goddess and huntress 
whose arrows never missed their target, he 
pointed to an object floating far out to sea. 
“I bet you can’t reach it,” he said. 
Artemis strung her bow and her arrow sped 
unerringly to its distant target, which was, alas, 
the head of Orion who was walking as usual in 
the water far from the shore. 
When she saw that she had killed the good 
giant by mistake, Artemis was so distressed that 
she bore Orion to heaven and transformed him 
into a constellation. |

The Coloured Beach 
It was again a fine day on the sixteenth. I 
went to the Coloured Beach to pick up some 
pink shells. I sailed the distance of seven 
miles in a boat and arrived at the beach in 
no time, aided by a favourable wind. A man 
by the name of Tenya accompanied me, with 
servants, food, drinks and everything else he 
could think of that we might need for our 
excursion. The beach was dotted with a 
number of fishermen’s cottages and a tiny 
temple. As I sat in the temple, drinking 
warm tea and sake, I was overwhelmed by 
the loneliness of the evening scene. 
Lonelier I thought 
Than the Suma beach— 
The closing of autumn 
On the sea before me. 
Mingled with tiny shells 
I saw scattered petals 
Of bush-clovers 
Rolling with the waves. 
I asked Tosai to make a summary of the 
day’s happenings and leave it at the temple 
as a souvenir.

|. Polynesian myth, the primal spiritual force 
is Tangaroa, the atua, or god, of the ocean. The 
sky, Raki, is his parent, and Hinemoana, the 
woman of the sea, is his partner. Tangaroa 
appears in different forms within the diverse but 
connected cultures of Polynesia as a figure who 
cannot be escaped and must always be accom- 
modated. 
The Polynesians inhabit a world which con- 
sists almost entirely of ocean. Apart from New 
Zealand, the land area they know consists of small 
islands, some of them volcanic outcrops and 
many others mere coral atolls. Habitable land 
constitutes no more than 1.5 per cent of 
Polynesia. 
In Polynesian mythology the land comes 
from the sea, from which it has been drawn by 
the demi-god Maui. Islands are great fish dragged 
from the depths, or waka (canoes) from which 


### 89098: Pacific pioneers

Maui brought lesser islands to the surface. 
The indigenous people of Polynesia share a 
high level of linguistic, ethnic and cultural unity, 
tempered by a diversity resulting largely from 
adaptation to the specific island worlds where 
they have made their homes. They live within 
the vast area of the Pacific which is known as the 
Polynesian Triangle and is divided into two 
closely related yet culturally distinct areas, 
Western Polynesia and Eastern Polynesia. The 
former comprises Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu and, 
historically, part of Fiji. The latter consists of 
Hawaii, the Tahiti group of islands, the Cook 
Islands, the Marquesas, Rapanui (Easter Island) 
and Aotearoa (New Zealand). 
THE PEOPLING OF POLYNESIA 
Who were these people and where did they come 
from? Modern scholarship concludes that their 
ancestors were Austronesian seafarers who 
worked their way from a starting point some- 
where in Southeast Asia down the island chains 
to what is now the western Polynesian Triangle. 
Archaeological evidence based on the remains of 
their distinctive pottery suggests that these people 
were capable of sailing over vast areas of ocean 
from one group of islands to another. 
What was to become Polynesian culture 
began to appear about 6,000 years ago in the 
Tonga-Samoa triangle. Then, some 2,000 years

later, some of these proto-Polynesians broke out 
into Eastern Polynesia. It is widely believed that 
this great leap into oceanic space took them to 
the Marquesas Islands, from which they then dis- 
persed to Hawaii, the Tahiti group and from 
there to Aotearoa. This last major movement 
seems to have occurred about a thousand years

-ago. A glance at the Polynesian triangle on a map 
of the Pacific is enough to give some idea of the 
extraordinary distances involved. 
Were these migrations purposeful or were 
they accidental “drift” voyages? The scholarly 
consensus, based on computer simulation of 
ancient weather conditions and other evidence, 
such as the distribution of plants and animals, sug- 
gests that although some accidental voyages may 
have occurred there was intended and purposeful 
migration. 
One argument against the drift thesis is that 
the known pattern of migration conflicts with 
the prevailing easterly winds of the Triangle. In 
fact the wind shifts to the west at more or less 
regular times, and waiting for this west wind 
became an important element in Polynesian reli- 
gious beliefs. Tawhiri-a-matea, the god of winds,

is almost as important in Polynesian traditions 
as Tangaroa, and in the whakapapa (genealogy) 
of creation, he is the elder brother with whom 
Tangaroa most closely interacts. This relationship 
was active and constant, and when the Polyne- 
slans put out to sea it was into the hands of these 
two atua that they entrusted themselves. 
THE CANOE, SYMBOL OF PRESTIGE 
The dominating cultural object in migration tra- 
dition was the waka or canoe, which was a 
symbol of mana, tribal authority, chiefly pres- 
tige and, most of all, wealth. Building a great

canoe was a major exercise which required the 
full commitment of the skilled members of the 
tribe and called for resources that only a few of 
the high island cultures of Polynesia could afford. 
The decoration of the waka and the ritual 
associated with it became a major focus of reli- 
gious life. 
Far from being a frail and inadequate vessel, 
the traditional Polynesian canoe was, for its time, 
at the leading edge of maritime technology. We 
know from historical evidence and more recent

simulated research that its double hulls, lashed 
together with sennit, were capable of sailing at 
great speed. The heavy stresses experienced in 
modern twin-hulled catamarans were avoided by 
keeping the canoe hulls quite close together so 
that they did not create too much resistance to 
the pressure of the sails on the hulls. The latter 
were able to “give” to the pressure of wind and 
to flex and “work” with the movement of the 
waves. 
The distinctive Polynesian sprit sail which 
drove these canoes was woven from pandanus 
fibre. Recent simulated studies suggest that it had 
more driving force than even the fore and aft rig 
of modern vessels. It was, however, more difficult 
to control. A remarkable modern reconstruction 
of a Polynesian voyaging canoe, the Hawaiian- 
built Hokule’a, has made swift voyages between 
Hawaii and Tahiti, Tahiti and Raratonga, and 
Raratonga and New Zealand. 
PRODIGIOUS FEATS OF MEMORY 
But the waka by itself was not enough. The great 
voyages would have been impossible without 
mastery of a developed and sophisticated system 
of navigation. Considerable astronomical 
knowledge was required, and an intimate under- 
standing of oceanic wind patterns and other 
natural and seasonal phenomena. A navigator 
would, for example, need to know the rising and 
setting positions of roughly 1,000 azimuth stars.

As well as performing that prodigious feat of 
memory, the priestly navigator would have to 
make and master “memory maps” of island 
groups and know much about wind patterns and 
wave systems. The absorption and retention of 
this huge volume of knowledge, transmitted 
without notebooks or instruments, were a part 
of religious practice. We know that these naviga- 
tional systems were workable because they have 
been tested extensively in the Hokule’a 
experience. 
Why did these people undertake their 
remarkable travels? There is much historical evi- 
dence of inter-island trading in canoes between 
Samoa and Tonga, Tahiti and other islands of 
eastern Polynesia. But what of the migration 
voyages over hundreds of miles of ocean? Poly- 
nesian traditions speak of competition on over- 
crowded islands, defeat in war, and chiefly con- 
flicts of family and prestige. Much voyaging, 
however, seems to have been driven by that most 
human of all needs—the lure of the far horizon 
and the desire to know and to explore. Whatever 
the motive, it is clear that these remarkable 
seafarers were supremely confident in their 
ability, in the capacity of their craft and in the 
goodwill of their atua. 
The high and ornately carved stern posts and 
low-slung prows of the Maori and Tahitian waka 
are examples of a blending of art and belief. Art, 
knowledge, and the pride of the community all 
focused on the canoe. The smaller, more

utilitarian waka for fishing and coastal travel were 
less adorned, but there was always some 
decoration—carving, inlaid shellwork or the geo- 
metric design of the Jashings holding the craft 
together. 
There is art in both the structural design and 
the decoration of these canoes. To the Polyne- 
sians, art is inseparable from function. The carved 
prow of a Maori war canoe is a defiant figure 
flying over Tangaroa towards the enemy. The 
small carved figures carried aboard fishing and 
voyaging canoes were not works of art taken 
along as prized possessions, but symbols and 
residing places of the protective atua of the Poly- 
nesians. 
Everything to do with Tangaroa was 
decorated—fish-hooks, sinkers, spears. Art was 
necessary to evoke from the atua a good catch. 
Even today the custom of returning the first fish 
to Tangaroa remains an important one. Art and 
custom decree that the god of the ocean must be 
appeased. |

The sea of courage 
Perhaps the encyclopaedist who would prove 
most instructive for us would be Hegel when 
he ascribed man’s finest qualities to the sea. 
In describing this sea, he spontaneously 
lit upon the expression he had used to 
characterize the logic of History: the cunning 
of Reason (die List der Vernunft); nor is it 
inappropriate to hark back to the lliad and 
to cunning Odysseus. Let us consider the 
passage devoted to the sea. The seafarer is a 
man who, better than any other, symbolizes 
human grandeur, courage and endeavour: 
“The sea arouses courage” (Das Meer 
erweckt den Mut) 
Here courage is bound up with 
intelligence and must also involve cunning 
as it is divected against an element which is 
the most cunning, the least trustworthy and 
the most deceptive: “This infinite expanse is 
perfectly malleable for there is no pressure it 
resists, not even a breath; it seems infinitely 
innocent, submissive, good-natured and 
docile and it 1s precisely this pliability that 
transforms the sea into the most dangerous 
and the most powerful element. 
“Against such deceitfulnesss and such 
violence man pits no more than a simple 
piece of wood, relies solely on bis courage 
and ingenuity and moves from what is firm 
to what is unsupported, bringing with the 
floor that be bas set beneath his feet— 
himself”

Music of the waves 
Te: sea, a source of sustenance to those who live on her 
shores, the homeland of travellers, of those who span worlds; 
the sea, which rises and falls with all the majesty of 2 symphonic 
poem. The sea, fountainhead of sounds and rhythms. The sea 
wind plucks the strings of guitars, harps and lutes, and makes 
the tom-tom skin vibrate. It fills the bellows of the accordion. 
Great music and light music, Debussy and Trenet, live and 
breathe the cadence of the waves as they endlessly advance and 
retreat. 
I am a son of Alexandria, and my vocation as a musician 
grew in a port city, a seaside city where from childhood my 
rovings were accompanied by the tang of algae, by glittering 
cascades of spray, by the splashing of waves against the stone 
blocks of the j etty and their discreet murmuring as they died 
on the sand, by the sirens of liners, by the lapping of water 
around the hulls of the caiques, and the cries of seagulls. 
As I walked along the seashore to school, I would hear the 
first songs of the day being intoned by the fishermen as they 
drew in their nets, hauled their boats ashore or serenaded an 
early morning bather. 
After the war, a film entitled Fiévre was shown in Alexandria 
in which Tino Rossi, alone in the middle of the Mediterranean, 
sang Schubert’s Ave Maria unaccompanied. As I spent most of 
my time on the Maiscaizone, the cockleshell my father had given 
me, I identified spontaneously with the hero of the film and 
sang away as I pulled on the oars. Later, I learned that the writer- 
sailor Gérard d’Aboville sang my songs during a solo voyage, 
to break the silence, fight exhaustion or simply to amuse 
himself. 
When I wrote the music of Milord for Edith Piaf, I tried 
to remember the sounds I had heard in the sailors’ dives I knew 
when I was a teenager, with the disturbing beauties of the port 
and the songs the seamen bawled out to the accompaniment 
of a honky-tonk piano. 
Songs of the sea, of love, of death. 
Songs of the deep or the shore. . . 
.. My memory is steeped in them, and my verses some- 
times hymn the urge to travel. It was on the Greek island of 
Spetsai that the sea whispered my first notes to me.

### 89099: Music of the waves

Wherever there is sea, songs are born to reduce tensions, 
ease parting, salute arrivals, win the girls waiting on the jetty 
or console the wives dressed in black who have learned that 
the sea, their rival, has kept their husbands. 
The songs of Dorival Caymmi, a poet, singer and musician 
from the north of Brazil, describe the daily odyssey of the 
fishermen of Bahia, lovers of the ocean, victims of its fury, cap- 
tivated by its sorcery and by Yemanja, goddess of the waves, 
who sometimes takes them to her underwater kingdom. 
Before Hertzian waves, the waves of the sea transmitted 
music between people, countries and continents, mingling with 
other forms of music to give rise to new melodies and new 
rhythms. 
The bandoneon, a portable harmonium invented by the 
German musician Heinrich Band to accompany religious 
processions, was introduced by the sailors of Hamburg to the 
  
by Georges Moustaki 
portefios of Buenos Aires, where it became indissociable from 
the tango. 
At Tananarive I bought a kind of musical bow and a drum 
whose notes could be modulated by a stick fixed on to its skin. 
Some time later I came across almost identical instruments in 
Brazil where they were known as the “berimbau” and the 
“cuica”. 
Andalusian music, which originated in Pakistan or Byzan- 
tium, was brought to north Africa and southern Spain by 
nomads who travelled by land and sea. 
The meeting of European folklore and emigrants to the New 
World with the pulsating songs of the African slaves, all borne 
by sea, created the musical expression of the two Americas. This

fiesta in honour of Yemanja, 
goddess of the sea and of 
fertility. 
 
  
T. musical tradition of the Brazilian littoral 
began with the arrival of the first Portuguese navi- 
gators and developed during the 300 years or 
more which saw the forced migration of slaves 
from Africa. This century it has achieved nation- 
wide popularity and recognition through the 
talents of Dorival Caymmi, a2 mulatto of Afro- 
Italian origin who drew inspiration from the 
songs of Portuguese sailors, mestizo fishermen 
and worshippers of the three black divinities of 
the sea. 
THE AFRO TRADITION 
The coastline of Brazil is almost 8,500 kilometres 
long—longer than that of almost any other 
country in the world. Along it the early sixteenth- 
century colonists first settled. Only later did 
colonization spread to the hinterland with the 
gold rush to Minas Gerais in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, the rubber boom which attracted settlers 
up the Amazon, and the development of coffee- 
growing inland from Sfo Paulo. The inaugura- 
tion of a new capital, Brasilia, in 1960 constituted 
an official challenge to the Brazilians passion for 
the sea. 
Maritime culture is important in the big 
northeastern cities such as Recife and Fortaleza, 
and throughout the region as a whole. But it is 
primarily in Bahia that the ripple of waves turns 
most easily to music. Early Portuguese influences 
such as that of the majurada (“Sailor, it’s the fish 
in the sea/ that taught me to swim, that taught 
me to swim. ...”) were followed by African Can- 
domblé chants which established a tradition of 
sea songs, whose musical form and religious 
power attested doubly to their black origins. The 
people of Salvador de Bahia, the most African of 
Brazilian cities, sing for all the Orixas, the saints 
of their syncretic religion, but they keep their 
best offerings for Yemanja, the goddess of the 
deep sea more beloved than her fellow-divinities, 
Oxum god of the shore and Ayoka goddess of 
the deep. 
“On the second day of February, festival day 
at sea, 
I want to be the first to celebrate Yemanja. 
Thus sang young Dorival Caymmi, who left 
Bahia in 1938 to seek fame and fortune in Rio 
de Janeiro, where he was a fantastic success with 
his big guitar and his serious way of singing about 
gods, fish, fishermen, and the sea off Bahia. 
“The raft set sail with Chico Ferreira and 
Bento, 
the raft returned alone. . ..” 
“How many have lost 
husbands and sons in the waters of the sea.” 
While Caymmi sang of dramatic events from 
the lives of the fishermen of northeastern Brazil 
and their families—disconsolate widows, weeping 35

fiancées waiting for their men to return, offerings 
begging Yemanja to provide fish—Admiral Paulo 
Moreiro da Silva, the architect of modern Brazil's 
fishing policy, said jokingly that “The hunger 
problem of the northeast would be solved if we 
turned the map of Brazil upside down and sent 
the great shoals of fish from the south to the 
north”. In rich, cold, southern Brazil, where the 
economy 1s based largely on industry and agricul 
ture and where the coast is sparsely populated, 
sardines are plentiful and fishing is practised on 
a large scale with modern vessels. 
In the northeast, where fishing has always 
been a source of subsistence, the fish are bigger 
and finer, but they are caught individually on the 
line, from rudimentary craft such as the savesros 
of Bahia or even from rafts. The recent industri- 
alization of fishing in the region has largely 
brought profits to 2 handful of companies from 
the south. 
POETIC INSPIRATION 
Solitary adventures like that immortalized by 
Hemingway in The Old Man and the Sea are 
common in the warm waters off Bahia, Ceara and

Pernambuco. They have inspired many poems, 
including one written by Caymmi and his great 
friend Jorge Amado, which contains the words: 
“It 1s sweet to die at sea, in the green waves 
of the sea. . . . The siren has seduced the hand- 
some sailor. . ..” 
Caymmi’s influence on Brazilian popular 
music has been far-reaching. Many other com- 
posers inspired by folklore have followed his 
example, and have brought the music of distant 
regions to Rio, the cultural centre of the Brazilian 
sub-continent. As a composer and guitarist 
Caymmi has been a great innovator in the field 
of harmony. Already a veteran, he wrote four of 
the early songs of Jodo Gilberto, the creator of 
the bossa nova. His musical heirs are countless. 
Caymmi was still very popular when the 
bossa nova appeared on the scene. He shared its 
glory on the record in which he and Gilberto, 
accompanied by Cuarteto em Cy, sing a bossa 
nova classic, “The fishermen’s suite”: 
“My raft is off out to sea. . ./ when I come 
home from the sea a fine fish I shall bring/ my 
friends will come back too/and we shall give 
thanks to God in heaven. . . .” 
“Farewell, farewell fisherman, do not forget 
me/I am praying for fair weather/that the 
weather won’t be foul. . .. 
“With weather like that we stay in port/He 
who goes to sea does not come back. . . .” 
A NEW CULT 
From the historic encounter between Caymmi 
36 and the bossa nova a new cult was born on the 
shores of a sea that had become symbolic, an 
urban sea edged by the concrete buildings south 
of Rio from which people can greet the summer 
from their windows: 
“Day of light, festival of the Sun, and the 
little boat glides on the tender blue of the sea” 
(O Bargquinho by Mensecal and Boscoli, recorded 
by Jodo Gilberto in 1961). 
This is the cult of health, beauty and passion. 
From Tereza de Praia, in which Dick Farney and 
Lucio Alvez sang “She belongs to nobody, she 
can’t be mine, she can’t be his”, to Tom Jobim 
and Vinicius de Moraes’s great hit The girl from 
Ipanema, the shapely beauty of the girls (and 
boys) of Rio who congregate on the beaches and 
in the bars of Ipanema, Copacabana and Leblon 
has become the great source of inspiration for the 
poets of salt water and ice-cold beer. 
Most of the movements that have changed 
the life of the Carioca and of Brazilians in general 
have come into being and found expression in 
song on the beaches of Rio: cultural resistance 
to the dictatorship, the liberalization of morals, 
and now the prevention of AIDS. 
As the urban population increases, the 
problem of seawater pollution gets worse in spite 
of all that has been done to extend sewage pipes 
further from the shore. The ecological balance 
is precarious. A great effort is being made to 
restore beauty to the beaches and purity to the 
water. 
Perhaps this is a response to the dearest 
wishes of Yemanja, whose cult is gaining ground 
in Rio not only among the traditional practi- 
tioners of Candomblé, the country’s second 
religion after Roman Catholicism, but also 
among the general public. New Year’s Eve has 
become a great festival in honour of the sea 
goddess. That night, southern Rio comes to a halt 
as hundreds of thousands of worshippers throw 
flowers into the sea while cascading fireworks 
illuminate the scene. 
The moment symbolizes what is expected of 
the sea throughout the year. When it is not a 
receptacle for the city’s wastes it is the recipient 
of requests for good luck and happiness, money, 
health and love. It is almost as if the sea can 
absorb all the negative energies of humankind and 
return them in the form of food and fortune. 
Perhaps the Bahia song-writers Geronimo 
and Vevé Calasans were seeking to placate the sea 
divinities of Brazil when they wrote: 
“A dozen roses . . . I wanted to give, 
but without asking a thing, I threw them in 
the sea, 
embracing the sea, but without asking a thing 
I just gave thanks. ...” n

### 89101: Night watch, alone

MITIE is a 7.60-metre cutter with 
A blue hull and white sails. We 
named her for friendship— 
ours, that of the people we hoped to meet 
on our two-year cruise—and for a song 
well known to international volunteer 
workcampers. We only discovered much 
later the other Amitié which appears, 
dragged up on the beach, in a painting by 
Van Gogh. 
os watch, a one 
One late April afternoon, our Amitié 
nosed out of the harbour of Las Palmas, 
capital of the Canary Islands, and turned 
west. Objective? Bridgetown, Barbados, 
some 2,700 sea and tradewind miles 
toward sunset. On board were Nicole 
(France), Glyn (UK) and I (USA). Glyn’s 
first son had just been born back in 
England. In a paternal gesture (and 
perhaps to ward off storms and evil 
spirits—sailors still tend to worry about 
both), he streamed astern, on a short line, 
a rubber duck borrowed from the new 
baby. “There,” announced Glyn, making 
sure the line was tied fast to a cleat, “by 
the time he gets back to England, that 
duck’s going to be a very salty bluewater 
sailor!” 
The first night and day were har- 
rowing as we crossed a heavily-travelled 37

north-south shipping lane. We were not 
much bigger than a single lifeboat on the 
deck of one of the monster craft that 
loomed on all sides. Our radar reflector 
probably graced their screens with a blip 
not much bigger than that of a seagull. 
Then the shipping lane was behind us. 
And before us? Nothing. We would 
not see another human being for over a 
month. 
Nothingness. . . . Sea, sky, wind, 
waves: huge rollers towering above our 
stern, raising us to their crests in slow- 
motion roller-coaster style, and depositing 
us (not always gently) in the following 
trough. A nothingness made the more 
impressive by the fact that, as we settled 
into a routine, each of us spent several 
hours out of every twenty-four on watch 
alone. 
Nothingness, the sea? Beneath our 
keel were something like two kilometres 
of salt and water—elemental substances 
that make up some 70 per cent of you and 
me. The surface of this ever-heaving, 
often-roiling liquid was about one metre 
beneath the seat of the slicker trousers— 
then, as the weather warmed, swimsuit— 
of whoever was on watch. 
Close enough to observe the dolphin 
fish that followed us, the dolphins that 
preceded us, and the flying fish chased by 
some ominous icthyomorphous cousins 
off the crests of waves and practically into 
the open jaws of frigates and other sea 
birds that wheeled and waited for a 
winged snack. 
SOLITUDE 
Nothingness, the sky? Sun and stars gave 
us our bearings; the sight of a bird trying 
to light on the wildly gyrating masthead 
gave us mirth; and the Moon and Jupiter 
joined forces—I enjoyed night watch— 
to light up whatever reading matter I 
wanted, even an old copy of Le Monde (a 
newspaper not renowned for large type). 
Not nothingness, then; but solitude 
for certain. A solitude made the more 
present by the disappearance of Glyn’s 
son’s ducky. A sharp tooth had been at 
work: the line was severed, not 
unravelled. 
Solitude, then, although humankind 
wasn’t far: strewn along the whole trans- 
atlantic crossing were bobbing oil drums, 
38 petroleum-coated plastic containers of 
 
The sea’s hand 
I lost my way. 
And I found the sea’s hand, 
its ever open route, 
the glittering green waves. 
I walked beside it, 
ob gentle lull of evening. 
Ob drunken rapture of dawn. 
And the monster of the tempest 
took me in his arms. 
Elmer Diktonius (1896-1961) 
Finnish writer      
many shapes and sizes and other flotsam 
and jetsam of our “civilization”. One 
plastic box wheedled to nobody but us 
and the birds: “Drink Coca-Cola!” “Like 
hell I willl” I shouted after it as it drifted 
astern, already on the lookout for another 
yachtsman-client, improbable before a 
few days . . . or months. 
Other news that came, via the BBC, 
included civil war in Africa, student dis- 
turbances in Europe, and twice-daily time 
checks for our navigation. We also heard 
May Day in Red Square: thank you, 
Radio Moscow; the bands came in loud 
and clear and we cavorted in the 
1.5-square-metre cockpit. 
“IT'S RAINING IN RIO" 
About two a.m. one night I craned my 
neck as two planes approached each other 
in opposite directions overhead. At first 
mesmerized by their warning flashes, I 
then jumped for the radio and heard two 
British Airways pilots chat offhandedly: 
“Hope you've brought your mac, friend; 
it’s raining in Rio. Over.” Crackle. 
“Roger, friend. And 7 advise you to take 
the Underground in from Heathrow. 
They've got the motorway dug up a treat 
again. Over.” 
For me, there was nobody to talk to, 
but I was speechless anyway. And then I 
started laughing out loud. Those fellows 
were each doing about 800 knots and 
would reach their respective destinations 
in scant hours. We were churning out 
about four knots and had several weeks 
to go yet. 
Little by little, night solitude turned 
one’s thoughts inwards. Fear? I honestly 
searched for it, and knew there were 
objective reasons to find it. A Swedish 
sailboat had recently been becalmed in 
mid-Atlantic and turned up in the West 
Indies with no more drinking water and 
only one tiny pot of jam left to eat for 
the five-person crew. We ourselves had 
had a dicey moment when one of the 
crosstrees started to crawl down the port 
stay—that could have been catastrophe. 
Luckily, Glyn was on deck at the same 
time as I and, standing on my joined hands 
(a prayerful stepping stool they made), 
managed to jury-rig a repair. In Las Palmas 
we had met Poland’s first single-handed 
round-the-world sailor, Leonid Telega. 
He showed us his logbook in which the 
Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, whom 
he had met in Tahiti, had written that his 
boat’s name, Opty, made him “half an 
optimist”. No, there was not much fear, 
however. (No superman, I'm scared of 
high places.) 
On the other hand there was some 
(pardonable?) satisfaction. Contrary to 
friends’ predictions, I had managed to 
learn to use a sextant—we were, in fact, 
only about five sea miles off course when 
we arrived “on the other side”; not bad for 
a bunch of amateurs. And I had managed 
to rig a twin headsails arrangement—Fred 
and Jim we called them—following the 
example of a pre-war French solo sailor 
and seascape painter, Marin-Marie. They 
enabled Amitié to steer herself most of 
the time. (Giving time to think.) 
I felt only a distant relative of the 
Tabarly-type racers. Amitié was a friendly 
donkey, not a sleek racehorse; our only 
competitor was danger, not the chronom- 
eter; and minus an obsession with speed, 
we were able to savour the slow passing 
of time. 
THE CALL OF THE DEEP 
But if the racers were distant relatives, 
they were kin all the same and I thought 
often of them. Other nocturnal kindred 
visitors included some of our hardy 
predecessors, who managed with wood, 
hemp and canvas (compared with our ° 
fibreglass hull and synthetic running rig- 
ging and sails), who had no radios, no self- 
inflating life-rafts, and were often months 
on a single crossing. 
Grandad among the solo artists was 
probably Yankee Capt. Joshua Slocum, 
who built his boats with his own hands 
and may well have been—as early as the 
nineteenth century—the first singlehander

to circumnavigate the globe. There was 
also Vito Dumas, an Argentine relative 
of writer Alexandre, who had to operate 
on himself with a penknife at sea when 
an abcess threatened his life. Then there 
was painter Marin-Marie, just mentioned. 
In 1933, he crossed the Atlantic from east 
to west—a real “first” —alone but in rela- 
tive comfort and with a modicum of rest. 
Of sixty-five days at sea, he only spent 
twenty-three at the helm. The twin- 
headsails system he invented obligingly 
steered his eleven-metre cutter Winibelle 
II the rest of the time. 
Why did they do it? Why were we 
doing it? “To get away from it all” —at 
least for a while—and literally to rub 
shoulders with Nature in her many 
moods, to be in and of and completely 
dependent on Nature, and to learn not 
to try to dominate her, but to co-operate 
with her. To test ourselves, too, since we 
were fairly young at the time. For the 
sheer joy of the days when the Sun shone 
and the wind sped us along leaving a 
straight bubbling, glistening wake astern; 
for the thrill of facing nasty blows (that 
had been in the winter Mediterranean a 
few months earlier—and we’d had quite 
enough of that particular kind of thrill!). 
And, finally, because one hot summer 
evening years before, sitting on 
Geneviéve, a hulk where we lived under 
the Pont de la Concorde in Paris sniffing

at the gracelessly perfumed Seine, with 
auto exhaust fumes wafting down on us 
from the bridge above, Glyn and I had 
suddenly decided that the open sea was 
for us. 
Despite a strict prohibition on 
alcohol, my thirty-first birthday was 
celebrated with the merest thimble of 
medicinal rum. It came as a reminder of 
temporal reality—by then, after three 
weeks at sea, firmly in inverted commas: 
“reality”. But I was never bored. The 
racers have no time to be bored; I had 
time not to be bored. Not too many Deep 
Thoughts crossed my mind, but it was 
ready to receive and nurture those that 
happened its way, doubtless a bit ruffled 
by the tradewind that pushed us inex- 
orably towards the New World. 
THE RHYTHMS OF NATURE 
Day thirty-five dawned with Barbados’ 
eastern shore beginning to rise before us 
from the flat bed of the western horizon. 
As Amitié drew closer, I was first 
bemused, then astonished, then (a little) 
frightened by repeated rapid glintings of 
light. Closer still, and the glintings proved 
to come from the windscreens and 
windows of cars zipping along the shore 
roads of Barbados, reflecting back to us 
the light of the Sun rising at our stern. 
“Zipping” is too weak a word: the drivers 
seemed to have been maddened to dizzy- 
ingly, fantastically dangerous speeds along 
those winding narrow roads: now I did 
feel fear, fear for the drivers’ lives! 
Later, I realized that the cars had been 
moving at a careful leisurely pace, that I 
in fact had slowed down, that in one- 
month-plus at sea my own biorhythm 
had relaxed, to match the rhythms of the 
elements of Nature: the slow, relatively 
regular respiration of the waves, wind and 
stars. 
My night watches alone left me with 
many questions and perplexities, but also 
with one secure conviction (on which I 
have certainly not acted sufficiently 
since): “faster” is not necessarily “better”. 
Thank you, Amite. |

It corresponds approximately to the 
Western concept of the soul. The ka is also 
the life force, the principle of life, and then 
all that keeps a person alive, from food to 
royal favour. 
The island of ka would thus be a place 
where there is an abundance of all the good

the early meaning of ka, it might also be 
thought of as the island of the spirit, the 
island of the ghost—the enchanted island.

primarily the western coast of the Red Sea 
and later came to include the coast of 
Arabia opposite and notably the Yemen 
(where the land of the famous Queen of 
Sheba was located). 
As early as the old empire, the Egyp- 
tians sent expeditions to the land of Punt 
in search of aromatic essences and incense. 
Sometimes accidents happened, for the 
coast is dotted with many reefs and islands. 
These voyages were laborious and often 
dangerous, and those who returned embroi- 
dered the stories of their adventures with 
extraordinary details to charm and astonish 
their listeners. This must have been the 
origin of the story of the shipwrecked sailor.

am going to tell you something. . . 
that happened. . . while I was going 
to the mines of the sovereign and had 
gone down on the Very Green aboard a 
ship 120 cubits long and forty cubits 
wide.! Aboard were 120 sailors, the 
flower of Egypt. Whether they kept 
watch on the sky or the land, their hearts 
were more steadfast than that of a lion. 
They could announce 2 storm before it 
happened. 
THE STORM AND THE SHIPWRECK 
A storm had broken when we were on 
the Very Green and before we had 
reached land. We carried on sailing, but 
the storm redoubled its violence, raising 
a wave of eight cubits. . . . Then the ship 
sank without any survivors. And I was 
cast away on an island by a wave of the 
Very Green. I spent three days alone, 
with only my heart for companionship. 
Lying inert beneath the shelter of a tree 
(?), I embraced the tree. Then I stretched 
my legs and went in search of something 
to eat. I found figs and grapes, magnifi- 
cent vegetables of all kinds, the fruits of 
the sycamore... . and cucumbers as if they 
had been cultivated. There too were fish 
and birds. Everything imaginable was 
there. I took a grip of myself and threw 
down on to the ground (some of these 
foodstuffs), for I had too much to carry. 
Then, when I had taken a fire-stick I 
made a fire and a burnt offering to the 
gods. 
A BEARDED SERPENT APPEARS 
Then I heard the sound of thunder. I sup- 
posed that it was a wave of the Very 
Green. The trees cracked and the earth 
trembled. When I uncovered my face, I 
saw that a serpent was coming: he meas- 
ured thirty cubits and his beard exceeded 
two cubits; his limbs were plated with 
gold, his eyebrows (?) were in real lapis 
lazuli. He came forward cautiously (?). 
He opened his mouth to me while I 
was on my belly before him, saying: 
“Who has brought you [here], who has 
brought you, little one? Who has brought 
you? If you tarry before telling me who 
has brought you to this island, I shall 
make sure that you see that, after being 
reduced to cinders, you have become 41

something that is no longer visible.” [I 
replied:] “You speak to me and I do not 
grasp [what you say}: I am before you and 
I have lost my senses.” 
Then he put me in his mouth, car- 
ried me to his lair and put me down 
gently so that I was safe and sound, 
without anything having been taken 
from me. He opened his mouth to me 
while I was on my belly before him, and 
then said to me: “Who has brought you 
[here], who has brought you, little one? 
Who has brought you onto this island of 
the Very Green whose two shores are in 
the waves?” 
[The Egyptian tells the story of the 
shipwreck] 
THE SERPENT 
MAKES A PROMISE 
Then he said to me: “Fear not, little one; 
don’t look so tormented now that you 
have come to me. God has certainly 
allowed you to live, since he has brought 
you to this island of kz where everything 
can be found and which is filled with all 
kinds of good things. Here you will pass 
month after month until you have spent 
four months on this island. Then a boat 
will come from the country, manned by 
sailors whom you know. You will return 
with them to your country and you will 
die in your city.? Happy are they who 
can tell what they have experienced, once 
‘the painful moments have passed! 
“I shall tell you a similar story, which 
happened on this island where I was with 
my fellows, among whom there were 
children. There were seventy-five of us 
serpents in all, including my children and 
my fellows. Not to mention a very young 
girl whom I had obtained by prayer. A 
star fell, and set them ablaze. This hap- 
pened when I was not with [them]; they 
burned while I was not in their midst. I 
nearly died because of them when I found 
them in a single heap of bodies. 
“If you are strong, master your heart: 
you will clasp your children to your 
breast, you will embrace your wife, you 
will see your house again, and that will 
be worth more than anything. You will 
return to the country where you lived in 
the midst of your brothers.” : 
THE PRINCE 
OF THE LAND OF PUNT 
Then, prostrate on my belly, I touched 
the earth before the Serpent with my 
forehead and said: “I shall tell the Sover- 
eign of your power and will see that he 
42 isinformed of your greatness. I shall have 
[perfumes] brought to you—ibi, hekenou, 
tudeneb, kbesayt, and the temple incense 
in which each god rejoices. I shall thus 
tell what has happened [on this island], 
mindful of what I have seen by virtue of 
[your] power. You will be thanked in the 
city, before the notables of all the 
country. I shall sacrifice bulls for you as 
a burnt offering, I shall twist the necks 
of game birds for you. I shall have ships 
laden with all the precious products of 
Egypt brought to you, as is meet for a god 
who loves men, in a distant country that 
men do not know.” 
Sea and darkness 
At first I thought it impossible to 
remain alone at sea for three hours. 
But at five o’clock—five hours after 
my shipwreck—I found it natural to 
be waiting still. The sun was going 
down. . . . Suddenly the sky grew 
crimson and I continued to scan the 
horizon. Then it turned dark purple 
and I continued to look at it. On 
one side of the raft, the first star 
came out, set like a yellow diamond 
in the wine-red sky. And all at once 
pitch-black night descended upon the 
sea. 
My first impression, on realizing 
that I was so completely immersed in 
darkness that I could no longer see 
my band before my eyes, was that I 
would not be able to surmount my 
terror. The sound of the water 
lapping against my raft was my only 
way of knowing that, slowly but 
surely, I was continuing to advance. 
Plunged in the gloom, I realized that 
never during the daytime had I been 
so alone. The darkness added to my 
feeling of loneliness on this raft 
which I could not see but which I 
felt gliding beneath me on a viscous 
sea inhabited by strange animals. To 
feel less lonely, I started looking at 
my watch. Ten to seven. Much 
later—two or three hours later, so it 
seemed to mel—I looked again: five 
to seven. When the big hand reached 
the figure twelve, it was seven o'clock 
precisely and the sky was streaming 
with stars. I bad the impression that 
so much time bad gone by that dawn 
was about to break.

Then he laughed at me,’ [or rather] 
at what I had said and which he thought 
crazy, and said: “You do not have much 
frankincense, while you were born pos- 
sessing resin of the turpentine tree. But 
frankincense belongs to me, the prince of 
[the land] of Punt. As for this hekenou 
perfume which you thought of bringing, 
it is the main product of this island. It will 
come to pass, when you have left this 
place, that you will never again see this 
island, which will be transformed into 
waves.” 
THE RETURN HOME 
This ship came as the Serpent had 
predicted. I went and perched high in a 
tree and recognized the people who were 
aboard. Then I went to announce this 
piece of news [to the Serpent], but I found 
that he [already] knew. And he said to 
me: “[Go back] healthy, healthy, little 
one, to your home—may you see your 
children again! Make sure that my repu- 
tation is good in your city. That is all 
ask of you.” Then I prostrated myself on 
my belly, arms outstretched before the 
Serpent. And he gave me a cargo of 
frankincense, hekenou, iudeneb, khesayt, 
tichepes, chaasekh perfumes, black eye 
wash, giraffes’ tails, much resin of the tur- 
pentine tree, ivory tusks, hunting dogs, 
monkeys, baboons, and all kinds of pre- 
cious goods. I loaded it all on the ship. 
Then, when I prostrated myself to thank 
him, he said to me: “You will reach your 
country in two months, you will clasp 
your children to your breast, you will 
become young again, you will be buried 
there.” Thereupon I went down to the 
shore to the ship and hailed the crew. I 
gave thanks, on the shore, to the master 
of this island and also [to] those who were 
on board. 
Then we set sail northwards, towards 
the court of the Sovereign and we reached 
our country two months later, exactly as 
the Serpent had said. I was taken to the 
Sovereign and I gave him the presents I 
had brought back from the island. He 
thanked me in the presence of notables 
from the whole country, then I was raised 
to the rank of Companion and rewarded 
with serfs belonging to him. =

### 89103: The Strange destiny of Urashima Taro

The strange destiny of Urashima Tao 
Fo. the deep waters of my childhood rose a 
fantastic edifice called the Ryugn, the palace of 
the Dragon. Contrary to what this rather fright- 
ening name might suggest, a soft, feminine 
atmosphere prevailed there. The dragon was 
rarely to be seen and a very beautiful young 
woman, Otohime, lived in this underwater palace 
whose walls were decorated with enamels and 
corals. She wore an exotic dress. Was she the 
daughter of the dragon king or some other animal 
which had undergone metamorphosis? My pic- 
ture book did not say. 
A man named Urashima Taro lived with her 
as her guest. These two charming figures spent 
days and months together in an atmosphere of 
continual joy. They lacked for nothing. Count- 
less multicoloured fishes—sea bream, sole and 
thousands of others—danced a fantastic ballet to 
the sound of exquisite music. Their table was 
laden with delicious dishes. Do they eat fish and 
shellfish even at the bottom of the sea, I often 
wondered naively. But as to the nature of the link 
that bound this extraordinary couple, I never gave 
it a thought. Were they lovers, or were they mar- 
ried? My old book of stories said only that the 
young man was happy. That was enough for me. 
I knew why Urashima Taro lived at the 
bottom of the sea. The young fisherman had gone 
to the help of a giant turtle who was being 
attacked by some naughty children on the beach. 
Grateful for his aid, the sea creature transported 
its saviour to this wonderful place. 
Being such a bookworm as a child, I also 
knew the end of the story. After a few years had 
gone by, the hero tired of an existence given over 
to games and amusements. Nostalgia took him 
back to his home country, where he found to his 
amazement no trace of either his home or his 
mother. Nobody recognized him. . . . That was 
why I was in no hurry to turn the page and leave 
behind the pictures of the dragon’s palace. 
The last illustration to the story was dis- 
tressing for a child. On a deserted beach a piti- 
fully thin old man with a long white beard could 
be seen. He seemed overwhelmed by his strange 
destiny. Beside him was a small, precious-looking 
box from which a plume of white smoke spiralled 
upwards. Though forbidden to do so, the 
fisherman had opened the present Otohime had 
given him as a souvenir of their life together. The

three years he thought he had spent with her were 
the equivalent of 700 years on Earth! The 
fisherman’s death, which was clearly imminent, 
seemed to me enigmatic. What offence had he 
committed to deserve such a terrible punishment? 
Lee on, I learnt that the legendary figure 
of Urashima Taro had lived for centuries in the 
collective memory of my fellow-countrymen, 
symbolizing for them the sea that surrounds their 
small islands. 
This figure appears for the first time in 
written form in the Nibon-shoki (the “Written 
Chronicles of Japan”, compiled in 720) which 
describe mythical and historical events from the 43

the story I read when I was a child. 
Subsequently the legend reappears in many 
works belonging to different genres. The 
Manyoshu (7597), the oldest anthology of Japanese 
poetry, contains several poems which tell the 
story of Urashima. A folk tale dating from 
medieval times (otogi-zoshi) gives a particularly 
detailed version which reflects a Buddhist desire 
to edify and, through the theme of the quest for 
immortality, the influence of Chinese literature. 
After aging in the twinkling of an eye, Urashima 
is transformed into a crane by a feather in one 
of the three boxes given to him by Otohime, who 
returns to him in the form of a turtle. Thus the 
story ends with the uniting of two creatures that 
symbolize longevity—a thousand years of life for . 
the crane, ten thousand for the tortoise. A no play 
tells the same story. The legend also crops up in 
several tales from oral folklore. Several modern 
Japanese writers have also produced variants of it.

was a simplified, perhaps over-simplified, version. 
But even today I love it, with its pitiless ending, 
more than any other. Urashima’s mysterious

### 89103: The Strange destiny of Urashima Taro

adventure is still deeply rooted in my memory 
where, paradoxically, it is inseparable from the 
sound of a military march. Like all Japanése chil- 
dren who grew up during the Second World War, 
I often sang in those days a song called “Urashima 
Taro” which was put out by the Ministry of Edu-- 
cation. Its words gave an even simpler version of 
the fisherman’s story. Its rhythmical music is by 
no means exceptional. This tune linked to a 
specific moment in history has often come back 
to me when in my imagination I have plunged 
to the bottom of the sea. 
M... I today explain, as an adult, why I prefer 
the version of the story that I do? Would this not 
be an act as fatal as the opening of the little box? 
By way of explanation, I shall describe another 
legendary image of the underwater world which 
is also engraved in the memory of the Japanese 
people. 
In an episode of the Kojiki (“Records of 
ancient matters”), a seminal text of Japanese liter- 
ature compiled in AD 712, two mythical figures 
find themselves in a similar situation to that of 
Urashima and Otohime, but their lives are quite 
different. Toyotamabime no mikoto, the 
daughter of the sea god, welcomes to the palace 
of her father Watatshumi an earth divinity, 
Yamasachibiko. She marries her guest and, unlike 
Otohime, becomes pregnant. Thus, for the 
individual, the cycle of time is renewed by procre- 
ation. As far as I know, Urashima Taro and Oto- 
hime did not have any children, although they 
lived together for three years—or 700 according 
to our earthly measurement. To my mind, this 
universe under the sea can only exist outside 
human time. 
Now we can understand that what breaks the 
spell is affection, linked to a personal concept of 
time. Urashima’s first mistake is to wish to return 
to his mother and his village. Then, by clinging 
to the memory of the underwater palace which 
perhaps still lingers on in the box, he irrevocably 
breaks the rules of the game. Then, inevitably, 
everything goes up in smoke. The bewitched 
fisherman will return to human time to face his 
destiny. In my children’s picture book the story 
ended there. When Pandora opened the box she 
did at least find Hope inside it, unlike Urashima 
Taro. This children’s version of the story is more 
cruel but it is also more authentic. If the sea of 
Eternal Life exists, so do the life and death of 
individual human beings. The imagination must 
accept the reality of human life. 
With this smoke, which is in the end far too 
explanatory, it only remains for me to disappear

### 89105: Moby Dick, monster of the forbidden seas

|. 1839 eighteen-year-old Herman Melville, the 
son of a prominent but impoverished American 
family, sailed as a deckhand from New York to 
Liverpool and back aboard the packet ship St. 
Lawrence. This was his first taste of the sea. Less 
than two years later, after a short and unsuccessful 
spell as a teacher, he returned. Signing on this 
time as a lowly whalerman, despite his genteel 
origins, he embarked upon the Acushnet, which 
took him from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, round 
Cape Horn, to the Pacific. There, after deserting 
the Acushnet and becoming involved in a mutiny 
on another whaling ship, he became variously a 
harpooner and beachcomber on islands from the 
Galapagos—where just a few years earlier Charles 
Darwin had preceded him on board the Beagle— 
to Tahiti. In 1844 he returned to Boston from 
Honolulu as an enlisted seaman aboard the man- 
of-war United States. 
It was then that his writing career truly 
began, informed by his first-hand experience of 
the sea, its calms and tempests, its exhilarations 
and tribulations. For Melville, the sea was both 
massively actual, alive with observable creation, 
yet at the same time a kind of cosmic key or 
cipher. Within its ebbs and flows, its moving sur- 
faces and mysterious depths, its plenitude of life- 
forms from plankton to leviathans, was to be 
found the very riddle of existence. “You must 
have plenty of sea-room to tell the truth in”, he 
proclaimed. 
He could hardly have better indicated the 
ocean dimensions of the epic tale then taking 
shape in his imagination, one which would take 
its hero, Captain Ahab and his ship-of-all-nations, 
the Peguod, backwards and forwards across the 
great Atlantic and Pacific fishing lanes in pursuit 
of that most sumptuous of aquatic creatures, the 
white whale, Moby Dick, which would give its 
name to his novel. 
A LONGSTANDING TRADITION 
Yet in speaking of “‘sea-room”” Melville was also 
aligning himself with a very longstanding tradition 
in Western culture. The Book of Jonah, to take 
one starting-point, explicitly alluded to in Chapter 
9 of Moby Dick, relates a parable of would-be 
flight and guilt in which the sea is portrayed as 
the tempestuous domicile of a “great fish” that 
swallows and later spews forth the recalcitrant 
prophet. Then there is Homer who, with the 
Iliad and the Odyssey, composed epics that became 
founding stories in the Graeco-Roman legacy. In 
the latter, especially, which recounts Odysseus’s 
journey homeward to his faithful wife Penelope 
after the Trojan war, we have one of the classic 
expressions of the sea as both actual and figurative 
domain. 
Other landmarks in Western literature, the 
anonymous Beowulf and the Nordic sea sagas, 
_ delineate the sea as a place of northern dark and 
cold. Sebastian Brant’s Narrenschiff, a fifteenth- 
  
by A. Robert Lee 
century German satiric masterpiece, bequeaths us 
the image of a Ship of Fools afloat on a sea of 
illusion and false hopes. The European Renais- 
sance, an age of boundless discovery, yields 
images of the sea as at once a site for battles and 
piracy, for the unknown, and for possible routes 
to Utopia, reflected in Shakespeare’s The Tempest 
or Camdes’s Os Lusiadas (The Lusiads), the 
national epic of Portugal. Camdes, not inciden- 
tally, was favourite reading for Melville. Other 
poetry of the sea ranges from Coleridge’s ghostly 
The Ancient Mariner to Rimbaud’s intensely 
imagined Le batean ivre, with the lyrics of a Fer- 
nando Pessoa, a Hart Crane or a Rafael Alberti 
there to enrich the list. 
But it has perhaps been in the modern novel 
that the sea has found its most striking literary 
expression. Who has not relished the voyaging 
and the shipwrecks of Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, 
Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels or Stevenson’s Treasure 
Island? Do not Antarctic fantasias like Poe’s The 
Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym or Jules Verne’s 
underwater empire of Captain Nemo in Twenty 
Thousand Leagues Under The Sea weave a spell 
which extends well beyond childhood? Nor has 
the sea lost any of its fascination for our century, 
though it does have a growing rival in the immen- 
sities of outer space. In Joseph Conrad, Polish- 
born and also an ex-mariner, one can turn to a 
tale of the Malaysian Straits like Lord Jim or of 
ocean journeying from the Thames to the River 
Congo in Heart of Darkness. English fiction also

mere theme: its rhythms and cadences get drawn 
into the very story-telling itself. 
Herman Melville thus joins distinguished 
company, and not only on account of Moby Dick. 
The sea marks much of his other fiction. Still, 
it is Melville’s “whale-book”, as he liked to call it, 
which remains central. Perhaps this is because 
Moby Dick so dazzlingly combines high adven- 
ture with philosophy, authentic sea lore with a 
taste for metaphysics. “I have written a wicked 
book”, Melville told his fellow writer, Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, “and feel as spotless as the lamb”. 
How, then, does Melville’s epic picture the sea? 
Firstly, there is the sea as a physical power, 
Melville’s ability to render the smack of wind and 
current. Nowhere more dramatically does he do 
so than when Ahab and his men confront the 
breaching of the white whale: 
“Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not 
by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by the 
peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, 
did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; 
but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of 
\ 
\ 
  
  
  
breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from 
the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms 
his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and 
piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his 
pace to the distance of seven miles or more. In 
those moments, the torn, enraged waves he 
shakes off, seem his mane. . ..” 
Here, sea and whale become one, the ocean 
as a kingdom with leviathan as one of its ruling 
presences. Few of Nature’s dramas, for Melville, 
ever matched the sight of a Sperm Whale rising 
from out of the sea’s very depths. 
But Melville knew the sea to have a myriad 
of quite other incarnations. It could also be a place 
of rapacity, of warring and predatory species and 
none more so than the shark. With just the right 
touch of gallows humour, he describes how 
sharks will rip into the flesh of a captured whale: 
“. .. thousands of sharks, swarming around 
the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fat- 
ness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were 
often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails 
against the hull, within a few inches of the 
sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could 
just see them (as before you heard them) wal- ~ 
lowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning 
over on their backs as they scooped out huge 
globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a 
human head. . ..” 
In contrast, in a chapter appropriately called 
“The Grand Armada”, Melville depicts the sea 
as wonderfully feminine and maternal, an arena 
for birth as much as death. He describes a whale- 
boat which inadvertently has steered into a school 
of newly born whales and their mothers: 
“But far between this wondrous world upon 
the surface, another and still stranger world met 
our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended 
in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the 
nursing mothers of the whales, and those that by 
their enormous girth seemed shortly to become 
mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a con- 
siderable depth exceedingly transparent; and as 
human infants while suckling will calmly and fix- 
edly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two 
different lives at the time . . . even so did the 
young of these whales seem looking up towards 
us, but not at us. . ..” 
At the heart of the engaging peace and beauty 
of this scene is Melville’s recognition that 
however we may view the sea, it always retains 
its own way of being. Hence the infant whales 
look towards, but not at, their human observers. 
FORBIDDEN SEAS 
As, too, the Peguod travels ever closer towards 
destruction, Melville undertakes an extensive 
survey of every aspect of whale life. He takes a 
positive pleasure in playing the self-appointed role 
of cetologist, supplying lists, systems of categori- 
zation, quotations and fables from a multitude 
of sources—and not least from legendary explorers’ 
like Thomas Cook and Charles Darwin. He 
proves just as alert in describing dolphins, por- 
poises, walruses, brit, crustacea, seabirds, and the 
huge floating colonies of algae and seaweed. It is 
almost as if he wants to drive home the vital, 
incalculable abundance of the seas and their func- 
tion as repositories, places of rebirth and con- 
unuity. What is more, if ever a book cautioned 
against ecological arrogance, it is Moby Dick. In 
our own nuclear age, in which global warming

and pollution have become everyday facts, 
Melville’s story of Ahab’s monomania and of a 
technology which seeks to maim or even destroy 
one of creation’s supreme creatures could not 
offer a timelier warning. 
Yet rooted in fact as they are, Melville’s 
accounts of the sea and its creatures are also inter- 
spersed with flights of speculation and 
philosophy. From the outset, Ishmael, the nar- 
rator, makes no secret of the matter. Contem- 
plating his own going to sea, he declares “Yes, 
as every one knows, meditation and water are 
wedded for ever”. He speaks of the great seas as 
“watery prairies” which arouse nothing less than 
“mystical vibrations”. “Noah’s flood”, he muses 
at a later point, “is not yet subsided; two thirds 
of the world it still covers”. And with an eye to 
the sea as a source of endlessly proliferating myth 
and ritual, he invokes two of the most ancient 
of world cultures: 
“Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? 
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and 
make him the own brother of Jove? Surely all 
this is not without meaning. And still deeper the 
meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because 
he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image 
he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was 
drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see 
in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the

ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key 
to it all.” 
In passages like this, Moby Dick confirms how 
Melville writes both a sea-story, one of the 
greatest, yet also something infinitely more ambi- 
tious. The Pequod’s “‘voyage-out”, in another of 
his phrases, may well take us literally, exhilarat- 
ingly, into an Atlantic or Pacific. But it also takes 
us into matching other seas, “forbidden seas” as 
Ishmael calls them. These are the seas which exist 
within us and where the very first and last of all 
meanings might be encountered. n

### 89106: Reflections on the ocean

Reflection on the ocean 
by Elisabeth Mann Borgese 
OME human attitudes towards the 
ocean are universal and timeless— 
almost like the ocean itself. Whether 
they originated in one place and spread 
from there into all cultures, or whether 
they were born identical, in different 
places, settings, and times, we do not 
know. 
However this may be, human beings 
have always regarded the sea as the origin 
of all things. In virtually all mythologies 
of the world, water is given primacy over 
the other elements. It was the first thing, 
after which came all others. To the 
Greeks as to the Aztecs, even the gods 
were “born of water”, Myths of creation, 
from Peru and Mexico to North 
America, India and Scandinavia, depict 
the Earth as being created from the sea, 
and life as evolving from the sea. 
A second univeral perception of the 
sea is the perception of ambiguity. The sea 
is seen as a giver of life and a taker of life: 
an element of calm and beauty, of physical 
and spiritual nourishment, a conveyor of 
wealth and power, a road to new lands, to 
new knowledge, a medium of communi- 
cation. At the same time, however, it 
separates lands and their peoples. It 
remains mysterious, unfathomable and

irrational. In its wrath, with its storms and 
floods, it destroys wealth and power. It 
drowns and kills life. It is horrible to 
behold, generating fear, bereavement and 
mourning. The Great Flood, exter- 
minating 2 humankind at odds with 
nature and its laws, is a universally recur- 
rent myth of doom and damnation. 
Other perceptions, though rooted in 
these universal ones, are more closely 
linked to specific cultures. In the 
northern, terrestrial hemisphere, for 
instance, we tend to think of the oceans, 
and especially the seabed, as an extension 
of the landmass. In the southern, aquatic 
hemisphere, people living in island states 
think of the land as a continuation of the 
water mass, the most important part of 
their environment. The Western image 
of the oceans is as complex as the Western 
self-image. The souls of Westerners are 
mirrored in the ocean, in its very 
ambiguity between creation and destruc- 
tion, good and evil. 
‘HE WHO RULES THE SEA, 
RULES THE LAND’ 
The role the world ocean has played in 
the evolution of Western culture is indeed 
enormous. 
Since the Stone Age fisheries have 
constituted the basis of the economies of 
coastal communities. For fisheries to be 
successful, ships had to be built, and this 
encouraged the development of science, 
technology, exploration, trade and naval 
power. The power and influence of the 
Hanseatic League, the medieval federa- 
tion of north German cities, was based 
on their maritime skills. With its variants 
in many other languages, the expression 
“He who rules the sea, rules the land” 
has been conventional wisdom, and naval

battles have decided peoples’ destinies 
from Greek Antiquity to modern times. 
Western culture thrived on its 
overseas discoveries and conquests, based 
on sea power. It has seen the ocean as a 
great educator, nursing a love for freedom 
in seafaring people. Republics are the cre- 
ation of maritime peoples; tyranny was 
born inland. In his Philosophie des Rechts 
(Philosophy of Law), the philosopher 
Hegel compares the role of the seas in 
industrial societies with the role of the

earth in agricultural, less developed, 
societies. 
Oceans, storms and waves; ships and 
sailors; fishermen, mermaids and sea 
monsters have filled the pages of our liter- 
ature, the canvasses of our painters, and 
the scores of our music. Occidental music 
is indeed the art form most suited to cap- 
ture the essence of the sea, the playing of 
silvery ripples and the crashing of surf. 
The swelling of storms and their exhaus- 
tion find expression in crescendo and 
decrescendo. The rolling of waves and 
their eternal cadences are readily trans- 
lated into the measures of musical time.

FARMING THE SEA 
Today the ocean has become our “last 
frontier”. Penetrated ever deeper by the 
industrial revolution, its immensity is 
shrinking, yielding to ever more rapid 
and efficient means of communication. Its 
wilderness, where humans used to hunt 
and gather at their own risk, is being 
transformed into farms and mines, just as 
terrestrial wilderness has been trans 
formed over the past 10,000 years. 
Fishing from the wild is being over-

taken by sea farming and aquaculture, 
which introduce human intervention 
and, potentially, genetic engineering, into 
the life cycle of every commercially 
fished species. Chemicals, pharmaceu- 
ticals, energy, metals and minerals are 
extracted and produced from the seas, 
while the marine sciences are trans- 
forming concepts of the genesis of our 
planet. They have demonstrated that con- 
tinents are drifting, and oceans are born, 
made and remade through volcanic 
masses welling up from mid-ocean rifts, 
expanding the seafloor and forcing con-

continents clash, their landmasses forced 
up into mountains. 
Strange creatures have been disco-

THE MIRROR OF THE OCEAN 
What do contemporary Westerners 
project onto the mirror of this new kind 
of ocean? What do they discover about 
themselves? 
Perhaps: that science and mystery are 
not zero-sum values, such that one 
decreases as the other grows. Western 
science may be the gredtest of all sciences, 
but while spaces are indeed shrinking, the 
mystery of the sea remains as deep as it 
ever was. The more we know, the more 
we know how little we know. And some 
of our science, at least, may make us 
relive old myths in new clothes: universal 
myths of genesis and Leviathans and 
Great Floods. 
Perhaps: that we still feel awe and 
love and fear faced by the power and the 
beauty of the sea, just as we always did; 
that we yearn for its healing and dan- 
gerous elementariness, for its purity as an 
escape from the sophistication and cor-

our minds. Do we want Development, or 
do we want Environment? 
Western culture has been programmed 
with an Either-Or writ large. Good or 
evil. Ego or other. Egotism or altruism. 
Mine or yours. Nationalism or interna- 
tionalism. It is easy to say but hard to see 
that these might be mutually dependent, 
be considered as a whole. 
In the case of the oceans we will have 
to learn to see it. For there, beneath our 
eyes, everything flows, everything 
interacts with everything else; boundaries 
are fictitious, and neither sovereignty nor 
ownership holds solutions. What is mine 
is dependent on you; what is yours is 
dependent on me. If we want to get things 
done, we have to do them together, across 
sectoral uses, across fictitious geographic 
boundaries, or we cannot do them at all. 
Development depends on conservation. 
Without conservation it simply cannot 
happen. Economics becomes part of 
ecology; culture, part of nature; the 
human being, part of the animal family. 
The flowing ocean environment reveals 
these facts, while the apparently solid 
state of terra firma could maintain in us 
the illusion of separateness and indepen- 
dence, superiority and domination. 
Other cultures have stayed closer to 
a unitary world-view. In the West we had 
to return to the sea to regain it, and thus 
it is no accident that, in the evolution of 
Western culture, the search for a new 
world order starts from the Law of the 
Sea, a term which in itself symbolizes the 
unity between culture (Law) and Nature 
(Sea) and all that flows from it. [|

A metaphysical dream 
Infinity! My love for the sea, whose 
enormous simplicity I have always 
preferred to the pretentions 
multifariousness of the mountains— 
my love for the sea is as old as my 
love for sleep, and I am fully aware 
of the common root of these two 
sympathies, 
I have within myself much that 
is Indian: a great deal of inert and 
heavy longing for that form of 
perfection, called “Nirvana™, or 
nothingness, and even though I am 
an artist, I have a rather unartistic 
inclination towards eternity. . . . 
The sea is not landscape. It is the 
experience of eternity, of nothingness 
and death: a metaphysical dream.

### 89106: Reflections on the ocean

The United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea 
The adoption in 1982 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was 
a milestone in the history of international relations. The Convention contains the first 
comprehensive, binding, enforceable international environmental law. It is the first legal 
instrument effectively to integrate environment and development within the concept 
of sustainable development. It is also the first instrument to provide for a system of 
mandatory, binding settlement of disputes arising not only from environmental issues 
but from all other issues relating to the uses of seas and oceans. 
The Convention is based on two fundamental concepts: the concept of the Common 
Heritage of Mankind and the idea that the problems of ocean space are closely 
interelated and need to be considered as a whole. 
The concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind, applicable to areas (such as 
the deep seabed or outer space), to resources (such as minerals and metals), and to 
abstractions (such as science and technology) subsumes four other fundamental 
concepts: 
Development: The Common Heritage of Mankind must be developed for the benefit 
of mankind as a whole. 
Equity: In the distribution of benefits, particular consideration must be given to 
the poor and disadvantaged. 
Environment: The Common Heritage of Mankind must be developed with due 
consideration for the conservation of the environment and its resources. Mankind 
includes present and future generations, which have an equal right to share in the 
common heritage. 
Security: The Common Heritage of Mankind is reserved for exclusively peaceful 
purposes. 
The incorporation of the Common Heritage concept in the UN Convention is of 
such far-reaching cultural importance that we have not even begun to fathom all its 
implications. 
The Common Heritage of Mankind implies a new economic theory, based on a 
new concept of ownership, or rather non-ownership, which may provide a point of 
convergence in a common effort to meet the environmental chalienge. 
The economics and philosophy of the common heritage provide a logical basis 
for common and comprehensive security. Common, since in the contemporary world 
the security of one can no longer be founded on the insecurity of the other and the 
security of each must be the security of all. Comprehensive, since in the contemporary 
world, security comprises economic and environmental security as well as military 
security. 
The idea that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and should 
be considered as a whole has important consequences. For while the problems arising 
from the different uses of the oceans interact, the uses of the sea in turn interact 
with terrestrial activities. Much of the world's food comes from the sea; seabed metals 
and minerals are bought and sold on the world commodity market; offshore oil is used 
for the same purposes as onshore oil; the marine environment is part of the biosphere; 
the naval arms race cannot be dissociated from the general question of the arms race 
and disarmament. 
An integrated approach to other world problems is just as necessary as it is for 
the management of ocean affairs. Land boundaries are becoming porous, as production 
systems, financial systems, communication and information systems move unhindered 
across them. 
In the case of the oceans this interrelationship was more obvious. This is why the 
Law of the Sea is the most advanced legal instrument and institutional framework for 
the integration of Environment and Development. Let us try to learn the lessons the 
ocean has taught us and apply them to wider global concerns. E.M.B.

Sailor beware! 
A round-up of nautica 
superstitions and rituals 
0. the bridge of yachts bobbing at berth in 
their harbours a common sight is a no entry sign 
with the picture of a shoe placed over it. The mes- 
sage is clear and is always heeded by those who 
are lucky enough to board one of these graceful 
craft: first remove your shoes. If you are so 
curious as to ask questions about this form of 
courtesy, you tend to receive vague replies to the 
effect that the high heels worn by women would 
damage the deck or that the dust picked up from 
the quay would make the boat dirty. 
But apart from the fact that the decks of these 
noble vessels are made of teak, which is one of 
the hardest woods there is, we can be sure that 
their owners would not take the same precautions 
to protect the sitting-room floors of their houses. 
Even stranger, this prohibition does not concern 
working shoes but only town shoes. One’s 
Sunday best in fact. 
One of my friends, a Sicilian fisherman, was 
talking to me one day about an uncle of his, who 
was a great believer in traditions. “It was a cold 
February morning”, he said, “and we had gone 
off to fish. It was still dark. In the first glow of 
dawn my uncle saw that I had kept my shoes on 
my feet. Furious, he ordered me to take them off 
and, after attaching them to a rope, threw them 
into the water where they remained in tow”. He 
was a kind man and, knowing that his thought- 
less nephew possessed only one pair, this was his 
compromise solution. 
This prohibition is widespread in the North 
Sea, among the deep-sea fishermen of England and 
Scotland—but the Malay fishermen of Penang 
take the same curious precaution. Where yachting 
circles are concerned, it may have originated in 
England along with the practice of sailing as a 
sport, assuming along the Mediterranean coast 
and probably elsewhere this pseudo-rational 
veneer that we have seen. 
What is the link between shoes and boats? 
To understand, we perhaps need to refer to 
another superstition, associated this time with a 
particular accident of birth. 
Some babies are born with the amnion or 
inner membrane which enclosed the foetus before 
54 birth—known as a caul—covering their heads. All

] by Pier Giovanni d Ayala 
over the world numerous beliefs have been 
attached to this. Generally, the caul is thought 
to possess extraordinary qualities and it is not by 
chance that, in northern Europe and Sicily alike, 
it is reputed to be a preservative against drowning. 
Being born with a caul on one’s head is a sign 
of good luck. 
“Good” births are traditionally thought to 
be those where the child passes through the 
amniotic waters head first. “Bad” ones are those 
known as breech births, where the feet appear 
first, making for a difficult delivery which, in 
former times, was likely to result in the death of 
the mother or the child. 
While birth is a voyage through the salt 
waters of the maternal womb, death is thought 
of in mythological and religious belief as a 
journey to the beyond. In both cases, there are 
certain rules. It 1s the custom for the dead to leave 
“feet first” and, in keeping with the solemnity 
of the occasion, they depart from from the world 
of the living in their best clothes—and in their 
best shoes. 
This then is the explanation. He who, 
wearing such shoes, undertakes a sea voyage in 
a boat will be accompanied by the spectre of 
death, in a world where danger looms on every 
side. 
THE NECESSARY SACRILEGE 
Since earliest times in many civilizations, water 
and the sea have been linked to the nether world 
of death, the abyss and the primal chaos to which 
all creatures return before being reborn to other 
lives. 
Crossing the water by means of a man-made 
device (a bridge or boat) involves a direct con- 
tact with the element that separates life from 
death, which also serves as a bridge into the 
beyond. This journey into the next life is depicted 
in many myths, from that of the Greeks’ ferryman 
Charon to the Mesopotamian, Egyptian or Scan- 
dinavian legends. In order to commit the 
sacrilege—albeit a necessary one—of crossing the 
water, one is required to take a number of sym- 
bolic precautions. 
For the Romans, the pontifex maximus, the 
“bridgemaker”, represented the supreme religious 
authority, vested in Julius Caesar when he com- 
manded a bridge to be built over the Rhine. The 
annual ceremony of casting a doll into the Tiber 
from the Sublicius bridge, the oldest bridge in 
Rome, served to remind the ancients of the 
human sacrifices needed to build it. 
In more recent times, the cross thrown by 
the Greek Orthodox bishop into the sea on 55

Top, fishing boats in Bangkok

Twelfth Night in order to bless it and the act per- 
formed by the Doge of Venice in marrying the 
sea with his city and casting a ring into the waters 
may be understood as a ritualized means of 
obtaining redemption. 
This sheds an interesting light on Christ’s 
walking on the water and on the feat accom- 
plished by Moses, for whom the Red Sea divided, 
enabling him and his people to cross it on foot. 
Many are the heroes and saints who have thus 
shown sacrilege to be necessary and reparation 
possible. 
THE BAPTISM OF BLOOD 
The ritual often involves a blood sacrifice, 
whether real or symbolic—that of Iphigenia, who 
in Greek mythology has to be sacrificed by her 
father Agamemnon so that the Greek fleet can 
sail to Troy, or that of the young Persian who 
has his throat cut in the bows of the Greek flag- 
ship before the battle of Salamis. 
From the the Anatolian coast all the way to 
Alexandria in Egypt, a sheep is always sacrificed 
in the bows of a boat, thus perpetuating the 
ancient Mediterranean ritual and the symbolic 
substitution, dating back to Abraham, of a lamb 
for a human being. This is indirectly testified to 
by Homer’s crimson-cheeked ships and the sheep- 
skins hanging from the stems of fishermen’s 
boats, from the eastern Mediterranean to 
Portugal. 
Even today, ships are “baptised”, from the 
smallest boat to the giant oil tanker. Why is this? 
A Sicilian fisherman told me one day: “Do you 
not baptise your son and give him a name? It’s 
the same for boats. They are Christian creatures” 
(In Sicily, “Christian” and “man” are syn- 
onymous). 
There are many practices connected with the 
building and launching of boats. All reflect sym- 
bolically the idea that a ceremony is necessary 
to give life to and purify the inert matter, and 
to protect the seafarer and the members of his 
family. Greek and Italian shipowners often call 
their ships after one of their nearest and dearest 
or after a saint or a hero, thereby suggesting that 
the vessel is part of a larger spiritual family. 
BOATS WITH EYES 
Whether blood is shed or is replaced by wine— 
champagne at modern launching ceremonies—, 
the sacrificial rite is always performed in order 
to give life to the ship. 
In Laos, “eyes” are given to boats in a 
ceremony which involves the feigned sacrifice of 
a maiden and the fixing of her eyes on the prow. 
The prows of dugout canoes in Bali depict the 
head of Makara, the mythical elephant-fish. 
Viking drakkars displayed a dragon’s head and 
Greek and Roman ships looked at the waves 
through the eyes of boars or dolphins. The figure- 
heads of the great Western sailing ships fixed their 
 
  
hieratic gaze on the waters, and even today junks 
on the China Sea have eyes. 
Considering then that ships are living, almost 
human things, it is natural that they should be 
threatened by the same dangers as members of 
the crew. They have to be protected from mis- 
fortune by means of various symbolic signs which 
might appear to be fulfilling no more than a 
decorative function. 
In the archipelagoes of Melanesia, as in the 
Trobriand Islands for instance, the pirogues that 
participate in gift exchange ceremonies (k#lz) bear 
elaborate sculptures on their prows representing 
the mythical hero Manikiniki in the form of the 
life-giving Serpent. The serpent-hero and the- 
pirogue become a single creature. In order to 
acquire the powers needed to achieve this union, 
the sculptor has to serve an apprenticeship that 
may last for more than twenty years. 
On the Mediterranean shore, when the boats 
belonging to a particular village are painted in 
green or red monochrome, one can be sure that 
the effigy of that village’s patron saint in the 
church will be dressed in the same colour. In 
another village, where blue predominates, the

local boats will be placed under the protection 
of the Virgin who is venerated here and who 
wears a blue wrap. A boat may also be painted 
in honour of a more personal and familiar saint. 
If someone has made a vow to St. Francesco di 
Paola, his boat will have a brown stripe addeu 
to it, the same colour as the cowl worn by the 
hermit saint, who according to legend crossed the 
Strait of Messina on his coat. St. Francesco, 
incidentally, is the patron saint of the Italian mer- 
chant navy. 
IN SEARCH OF SALVATION 
The sailor who at the risk of his life has embarked 
upon the sacrilegious voyage is required to give 
thanks when he again sets foot on dry land. All 
Greek schoolchildren are familiar with the story 
of the prophet Elijah, whom seafarers, both 
Christian and Muslim, hold in undying devotion. 
Legend has 1t that the holy prophet was a sailor. 
“One day, tired of confronting the danger of the 
waves, he took an oar on his shoulder and walked 
so far up into the mountains, so far away from 
the sea, that a peasant who knew nothing of boats 
mistook the oar for a flail. There the holy 
prophet planted his oar, on which the green 
leaves of an oak tree grew, and made his abode.” 
A white chapel graces many of the Greek 
islands, built on the highest point and dedicated 
to the prophet Elijah by some sailor grateful for 
having survived the perils of the sea. Even if this 
custom seems to bear Homeric echoes, it is a fact 
that holy shrines dedicated to the sea are very fre- 
quently situated on a hill inland. Notre-Dame de 
la Garde in Marseilles and Genoa, Our Lady of 
Montserrat in Barcelona, Our Lady of Guadalupe 
in Mexico City and other ancient or recent sanc- 
tuaries thus bear witness to the seafarer’s secret 
need to remove himself from the source of 
danger, the sea. He accordingly sets out, often 
barefoot, on a pilgrimage to the place of salva- 
tion, the land—more precisely to the moun- 
tainous heartland. 
There the salt water becomes the fresh water 
of a well or of-a miraculous fountain where the 
survivor of a shipwreck washes off the bitter 
danger, as is the custom in the Sicilian sanctuary 
of the Black Virgin of Tindari, which overlooks 
the blue expanse of the Tyrrhenian Sea. There 
the votive offering—picture, model, candle, part 
of the rigging—is laid at the foot of the holy 
effigy. Here lies salvation, in this place away from 
the dangers of the everyday world. Here time is 
eternal; the time of horror and the night of the 
storm are no more. 
This journey into the symbolic universe of 
humankind must perforce remain incomplete. But 
it 1s only by not rejecting all these beliefs out of 
hand on the grounds that they are childish 
leftovers from a benighted past that we shall get 
any closer to understanding the secret world of 
seafarers and to recognizing how much courage 
and dignity they need to ply their hard trade.

The “‘Bag-Noz’’ (The ghost ship) 
Whenever some disaster is about to occur in 
the vicinity of the lle de Sein, an island off 
the coast of Brittany, a ghost ship is seen. . . . 
It is called a “bagnoz” (night boat) 
because it usually heaves in sight at nightfall 
without it being possible to say where it is 
coming from nor where it is going. For it 
suddenly vanishes just when one is looking at 
it, then reappears a moment later somewhere 
else on the horizon. Onward it plies in full 
sail, Jolly Roger at halfmast. . . . 
Its crew—which must be large—wail and 
shout as though calling for help, with piteous, 
heart-rending cries. But as soon as anyone 
seems to want to draw near, the vision fades, 
and the voices themselves become so distant 
that one can no longer tell whether they are 
calling from the depths of the sea or from the 
depths of the sky. 
It is related however that one night a 
pilot from the island managed to sail 
sufficiently close to the ghost ship to see that 
there was nobody on board except a 
helmsman at the stern. The pilot called out 
to the man: 
“Can I do anything for yous Do you 
want a tows” 
Instead of answering, the man swung the 
tiller round and the boat disappeared.

The sea is a treasure-house which 
belongs to all mankind. The marine 
~ sciences have revealed the crucial role 
played by the oceans in regulating 
the Earth's climate and have unlocked 
many secrets of the deep. A source of 
wealth and perhaps potentially a

fragile and must be protected if it is 
to continue to sustain human life 
and inspire the imagination.

ANKIND lives beside the sea. 
Over 145 of the world’s nations 
are coastal or island states, and 
the majority of the world’s population 
lives within 200 kilometres of a coastline. 
Today the use of coastal space for living, 
trade, resources development and recre- 
ation is increasingly intensive. In the 
United States, for example, even though 
there is abundant space inland, it is fore- 
cast that 80 per cent of the population 
will be living within 80 kilometres of the 
sea by the year 2000. 
In addition to this migration to 
coastal areas, many works of literature 
and music testify to mankind’s emotional 
link to the sea. Intellectually, however, 
the tie is much weaker. Although since 
the beginning of recorded history the sea 
has been used as a highway between 
different lands, this vast region has never 
been explored with the same urgency or 
thoroughness as the land. The world 
ocean is truly the last geographic frontier 
on Earth. 
Why should this be so? Perhaps one 
reason is that until the twentieth century 
there was little demand for scientific 
studies on the sea, and in any case the 
means did not exist for putting man into 
 
by Don Wal 
the sea to make direct observations. Even 
today, marine exploration does not arouse 
as much public interest as the exploration 
of space. The rhythm of events tends to 
be slow, the events themselves are not of 
great visual interest, and they do not 
receive wide publicity. And yet the world 
ocean has a major influence on our lives. 
THE EARLY DAYS OF OCEANOGRAPHY 
It is widely agreed that oceanography 
began as an interdisciplinary science 115 
years ago, when the British HMS 
Challenger expedition (1872-1876) left 59

England on a round-the-world scientific 
voyage. The team that wrote up the 
results of the three-and-a-half-year expe- 
dition formed the first international net- 
work of marine scientists. The fifty- 
volume set of reports and the extensive 
sample collections taken by the expedi- 
tion are still being studied by marine 
scientists today. 
It was also during the 1870s that the 
first marine laboratory was established, 
at Naples, Italy. The Marine Biological 
Laboratory was founded at Woods Hole, 
Massachusetts, in 1893, and by the turn 
of the century oceanographic studies were 
being conducted in many places 
throughout the world. In 1902 the Inter- 
national Council for the Exploration of 
the Seas, the first intergovernmental 
organization concerned with marine 
science, was founded in Denmark. 
Most maritime research before the 
beginning of World War I was in marine 
biology relating to fisheries development. 
Before then, few samples of marine 
minerals were taken from the sea, and the 
study of ocean currents and water depths 
was mostly confined to improving the 
safety of navigation in shallow coastal 
waters. However, the tragic loss of the 
steamship Titanic in 1912 set in motion 
  
Where do the seas 
come from? 
Some think that the sea is a vestige 
of the primal humidity of which the 
most substantial and most essential 
part evaporated under the effect of 
the beat, while the rest changed into 
the sea. Others maintain that, all the 
original humidity having been 
subjected to the fire of the Sun’s 
revolutions, which removed 
therefrom all that was pure, the 
residue became salinity and 
bitterness. . . . Yet others believe that 
the sea is that which escaped, through 
the density of its constitution, from 
the Earth’s filtering of the aqueous 
humidity, exactly like fresh water 
which, mixed with ash then filtered, 
ceases to be fresh and becomes salty. 
.. It is sometimes reckoned that 
the sea is a sweat which the Earth 
secretes beneath the action of the Sun, 
which beats it by turning constantly 
around it. . . .

drift trajectories. These studies still con- 
tinue, though Earth-orbiting satellites 
make the tracking safer and more 
accurate. 
World War I stimulated the need for 
more information about the oceans, espe- 
cially to aid the detection and destruction 
of enemy submarines. Since the primary 
means of submarine detection was sound 
propagation through the water, this need 
promoted the advancement of physical 
oceanography and the field of marine 
acoustics was born. During World War 
IT more research was carried out in this 
field and by the end of the war effective 
sonar (sound navigation and ranging) 
systems were installed on both subma- 
rines and surface ships. The scene was set 
for a major expansion in the field of 
oceanography in the postwar years. 
PREDICTIVE INFORMATION, 
THE KEY TO EFFECTIVE USE 
OF THE SEA 
The primary product of marine scientific 
research is predictive information that 
will eventually enable the sea to be used 
in ways that are beneficial to mankind. 
Without the supporting foundations of 
excellent science and technology, exploi- 
tation of the ocean’s resources is wasteful, 
economically inefficient and potentially 
harmful to the marine environment. Lack 
of scientific information is bound to con- 
tribute to misuse of the world ocean in 
such areas as overfishing, waste disposal, 
and coastal and open ocean pollution. 
Many of the uses of the ocean are 
commercial, but not all. Public safety is 
also important. For example, accurate 
advanced warning and movement predic- 
tion of marine weather systems such as 
typhoons and hurricanes can save thou- 
sands of lives and billions of dollars.

cerned about the complex issue of global 
warming and a consequent gradual rise of

sea level. We need to know more about 
how the oceans interact with and 
influence the Earth’s atmosphere and its 
quality. At present we may not be com- 
pletely certain that accelerated burning of 
fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution 
has caused these problems. But we cannot 
afford not to do the necessary science that 
will enable us to know for sure. This 
work will require an unprecedented inter- 
national pooling of scientists and research 
assets. No one nation can do it alone. 
THE TOOLS 
OF THE MARINE SCIENTIST 
In seeking the answers to these and other 
questions, modern oceanographers use a 
3-tier family of macroscale, mesoscale and 
microscale “platforms” and techniques to 
study the oceans. Macroscale platforms 
are remote-sensing systems such as air- 
craft, balloons and Earth-orbiting 
spacecraft which provide the “big pic- 
ture’, permitting scientists to observe 
large areas of the ocean surface. Satellites 
in particular provide the only means of 
measuring air-sea interaction processes in 
real time. 
The principal mesoscale platform is 
the ship, which is the primary and gener-

ally the cheapest means of obtaining data 
at sea by means of long-term research 
programmes using relatively large teams 
of scientists and large quantities of 
instrumentation. In recent years, sophisti- 
cated ship designs, high-powered on- 
board computer capabilities and new 
sensor technologies have made the 
modern research ship several times more 
productive than the vessels of only 
twenty years ago. Ship platforms are also 
remote sensing systems. They work at the 
air-ocean interface and make observations 
and take samples through the use of 
lowered mechanical “eyes and hands”. 
The last, microscale category of plat- 
forms puts the trained mind and eye of 
the scientist into the sea. For about $1,000 
a scientist diver can be fully equipped 
with the self-contained underwater 
breathing apparatus (SCUBA) and ena- 
bled to operate at depths of about 40 
metres. This research technique is today 
used by marine scientists throughout the 
world, including under ice in polar 
regions. At depths greater than 40 metres, 
the marine scientist will use a submer- 
sible. Using manned submersibles, 
oceanographers can descend to depths of 
up to 6,000 metres to make direct, 17 situ 
observations and measurements. 
Since they were first developed in the 
1950s, over 150 manned submersibles 
have been built. Today about twenty- 
four are being used for marine science 
support in eleven countries. Currently 
discussions are going on in several coun- 
tries about building a new generation of 
manned submersibles capable of diving 
into the deepest parts of the oceans. A

BW The ocean covers nearly two-thirds of the 
Earth's surface, an area of 361,000,000 square 
kilometres. The Pacific Ocean alone covers 
more of the Earth's surface than all the land 
masses put together. 
Hl Two-thirds of the Earth's land masses are 
north of the equator. The southern hemisphere 
is often called ‘the ocean hemisphere’. 
WM The average depth of the ocean is 3,730 
metres. Its greatest depth is nearly 11,000 
metres, but only 2 per cent of the sea floor is 
deeper than 6,000 metres.

ical arms for work tasks, and a variety of 
instrumentation sensors depending on the 
scientific mission. 
The vehicle is controlled from a sur- 
BM The total volume of the sea is over 1.5 bil- 
lion cubic kilometres. The oceans contain over 
86 per cent of all the water on our planet. 
HM The water in the oceans has been there for 
about 3 billion years. It has been thoroughly 
mixed more than a million times. As a result, 
this well-mixed “chemical solution” contains 
the same relative proportion of chemical ele- 
ments (salts) no matter where a sample is taken. 
HM Only six elements make up 99 per cent of 
the salts in seawater: sodium, calcium, chlorine, 
magnesium, potassium and sulphur. The 
amount of these elements in a given volume 
of seawater may vary from place to place. This 
is called “salinity”. The average for the world 
ocean is 35 grams per kilogram of seawater. 
It is estimated that if all salts in the world ocean 
were extracted and put on land, the layer would 
be 150 metres thick. 
Hl Life in the sea begins with photosynthesis 
when solar energy is captured by microscopic 
plants in the sea, phytoplankton, which are the 
first step in the marine food chain. Like terres- 
trial plants, phytoplankton absorb carbon diox- 
ide and release oxygen to the sea. A large por- 
tion of our planet's oxygen is produced from 
the sea. 
Because seawater rapidly filters out the 
penetration of solar energy, most marine life 
is found in relatively shallow, upper layers of the 
sea. In fact, about 90 per cent of the life in the 
sea can be found in the upper 30 metres. The 
highest biological productivity exists near coast- 
face vessel using television pictures from 
the ROV as well as instrument readings 
for depth and compass heading. Almost 
a thousand ROVs have been built since 
their introduction in the late 1960s, but 
only a few have been used for marine 
science. In the past five years, however, 
several have been acquired by marine 
research organizations. 
FUTURE EXPECTATIONS 
The distance between scientific investiga- 
tion of the ocean and commercial prac- 
tice is great. At every step of the way 
there are major problems which need to 
be addressed to ensure that the people of 
our planet can enjoy maximum use of the 
resources of the ocean. One of these 
problems is lack of public interest and 
thus investment in marine science and 
technology. Because marine science 
produces results over the long term, it is 
difficult for short-term governments to be 
concerned about it. Since modern marine 
science calls for international co- 
operation, the political difficulties 
become even more complex. Can ocean 
science prevail in this context? Clearly, 
the answer is that it must. | 
lines, where river and other runoff from land 
provides a steady supply of nutrients. Even 
though these coastal areas represent only 
about 15 per cent of the ocean's area, they are 
the primary areas for marine life. Essentially, 
the rest of the world ocean is thinly populated 
and more of a biological desert. 
MW The principal current system of the oceans 
is called “wind-driven circulation”. its engine 
is the wind that blows across the ocean surface 
at a constant velocity and from the same direc- 
tion season after season and year after year. 
The motion of the surface waters due to wind 
forces is modified by the shape of the ocean 
basins and the Earth's rotational motion. This 
results in a generalized circulation pattern con- 
sisting of giant circular water movements in 
each major ocean. These circulations are called 
“gyres’’. Direction of circulation is clockwise in 
the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise 
in the southern hemisphere. Major surface cur- 
rents such as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic 
and the Kuroshio in the Pacific are examples - 
of wind-driven circulation and each is part of 
a larger gyre in that ocean basin. These mas- 
sive movements of seawater act as part of our 
planet's “air conditioning system". Excess heat 
is transported from the tropical regions to the 
higher latitudes where there is a heat deficit. 
This process helps to keep the average regional 
temperatures throughout the planet constant 
from year to year.

### 89109: The Ghost ship of the Arctic

  
   
  
  
  
0. of the world’s strangest sea stories is still 
unfinished, and looks like remaining so for a long 
time, perhaps for ever. This is the story of the 
Baychimo, the deserted ghost ship that refuses to 
die and still haunts human memory and curiosity. 
A fine, trim, solid steel 1,322-ton cargo 
steamer owned by the Hudson’s Bay Company, 
the Baychimo was built in Sweden in 1914. She 
was originally used to collect furs from Eskimo 
trappers along the Victoria Island coast of 
Canada’s North-West Territory. With her single 
tall funnel, curved bridge and long high prow, 
the Baychimo was sturdily built to withstand the 
floes and pack-ice of the dangerous northern 
waters in which she operated. 
She actually pioneered fur trading with the 
Eskimo settlements around the Beaufort Sea, 
forging her way many times on her 3,200-

of the Hudson Bay Company’s lonely outposts. 
On 6 July 1931 she left Vancouver, British 
Columbia, on such a journey, with skipper John 
Cornwell and his crew of thirty-six men. They

expected a hard trip, for all their runs were hard, 
but what they did not know was that this was 
to be the Baychimo’s last manned voyage. 
PRISONERS 
OF THE PACK-ICE 
Day and night, under the misty glow of the never- 
setting sun, the Baychimo steamed on eastward. 
Eventually they reached the end of their normal 
eastward run by the shores of Victoria Island. 
With the hold crammed with cargo, the relieved 
captain turned the Baychimo about for Van- 
couver. 
Unfortunately winter came early that year 
to this bleak northern wasteland. Ferocious winds 
and deep-freezing conditions brought the dreaded 
pack-ice south much quicker than usual. By 30 
September only a narrow stretch of open water 
remained for the ship to steam through, and on 
1 October the ice closed in. 
Her engines at stop, she could only move as 
the creaking ice willed. She was not far from the 
Alaskan village of Barrow, where the company 
had permanent huts built ashore. Seeing that a 
terrible blizzard was imminent, Cornwell ordered 
his men to trudge across the kilometre or so of 
ice to shelter in these huts, where they remained 
for two days, half-frozen and unable to venture 
out. 
Then the first extraordinary thing in the Bay- 
chimo’s strange story happened. Without warning 
the pack-ice loosened and moved away from the 
Baychimo’s sides, leaving her free to move again. 
The crew rushed aboard and for three solid hours 
the ship steamed away to the west at full speed. 
Disaster seemed to have been narrowly averted. 
But once more the ice gripped the little cargo 
steamer, and on 8 October a sickening crack her- 
alded the sudden appearance of a deadly black 
fault-line in the ice. It actually cracked right across 
the patch where some of the crew were playing 
football. 
Now the ice that had held the ship had 
broken away, it began to move slowly but surely 
towards the shore. To Cornwell it seemed only 
a matter of hours before his rugged little vessel 
would be crushed like an empty eggshell. Radio 
SOS messages were sent out but these doughty 
men hung on in the hope that they and their ship 
might be saved. By 15 October their plight 
seemed so desperate that the Hudson Bay Com- 
pany sent two aircraft from the base at Nome, 
almost 700 kilometres away. Twenty-two of the 
Baychimo’s crew were rescued, and her skipper 
and fourteen men were left behind to wait until 
the melting ice released the ship and its precious 
64 cargo. They knew they might have to wait as long 
a ra. 
as a year, so they built a small shelter on the pack- 
ice a short distance from the shore. 
Their sojourn proved to be short and 
startling, for on the pitch black night of 24 
November a hellish blizzard descended, trapping 
the men inside their wooden shelter. When at 
last the storm abated, they emerged into the 
wintry gloom to find that the Baychimo had com- 
pletely vanished beneath mountains of ice over 
20 metres high. They searched around as much 
as they could, but on failing to find their doomed 
ship they came to the conclusion that she had 
been broken to pieces in the blizzard and had 
sunk. 
A GHOST SHIP 
They reached the safety of the mainland and pre- 
pared to return home. In a few days, however, 
an Eskimo seal-hunter brought the astonishing 
news that he had seen their ship some 70 
kilometres away to the south-west. Already the 
Baychimo had been turned into a ghost ship, a 
polar puppet pushed this way and that by the 
power of ice, wind and water. The fifteen men 
trudged to where the Eskimo led them and, sure 
enough, there was the ship. 
It was obvious to the captain that the chances 
of salvaging his vessel were nil. The ice was not 
going to allow it. So the men rescued the more 
valuable furs from the hold and reluctantly left 
the Baychimo for ever. In due course they were 
flown back home. A

### 89109: The Ghost ship of the Arctic

  
As the months went by, the Company's base 
in Vancouver received strange reports from 
Eskimo sources that their ship had again been 
sighted, this time hundreds of kilometres to the 
east. On 12 March 1932, a young trapper and 
explorer named Leslie Melvin discovered her 
while on a journey from Herschel Island to 
Nome by dog-team. She was floating inshore 
peacefully enough. He managed to board her and 
found that many of the furs were still intact in 
the hold. Unfortunately, as he was alone and 
without much equipment, far from his base in 
Alaska, he could do nothing, 
Some months went by and a group of wan- 
dering prospectors saw the ship and also managed 
to board her. They reported that everything was 
in perfect order. In March 1933 the Baychimo 
apparently drifted back to roughly the point 
where her captain had abandoned her. A group 
of some thirty Eskimos saw her floating idly in 
the freezing waters and went out in their kayaks, 
but no sooner had they clambered aboard than 
a terrific storm blew up. They were trapped on 
the ghost ship without food for ten days before 
they could get away. 
ADRIFT IN THE ARCTIC 
By August 1933 the Hudson Bay Company knew 
that the Baychimo was moving calmly in a north- 
erly direction, but she was still much too far from 
civilization to make salvage operations a possi- 
bility. The next visitors were an exploring party 
on a schooner. They came across her in July 1934, 
and boarded her for a few hours. 
By now the legend of the little grey tall- 
funnelled ghost ship was well known among the 
Arctic Eskimos, many of whom sighted her from 
time to time on their travels. By September 1935 
she had reached the Alaskan coast, always 
managing to avoid the crushing grip of the pack- 
ice, always surviving the worst polar storms. 
Nature seemed unable to destroy her, but man 
was unable to rescue her, 
After 1939 the Baychimo was seen scores of 
times, mostly by Eskimos but occasionally by 
explorers, traders and pilots. Each time she eluded 
whatever pursuit was possible, and over the inter- 
vening years she has sailed on crewless and alone. 
In March 1962 a small party of Eskimos dis- 
covered the ship again while fishing from their 
kayaks. This time she was floating serenely in the 
Beaufort Sea near a desolate strip of coastline. 
Once again there was no means of capturing her, 
so they left the desolate, rusting, but still 
uncrushed hulk to drift away into the unknown 
‘once more. The last recorded sighting, again by 
Eskimos, was in 1969—thirty-eight years after she 
was abandoned. But this time she was once more 
fast in the pack-ice of the Beaufort Sea between 
Icy Cape and Point Barrow. 
A representative of the Hudson Bay Com- 
pany told me, at their headquarters in Winnipeg, 
that even now they cannot say definitely whether 
or not the Baychimo is still afloat.

### 89110: The Four pillars of Neptune's temple

The four pillars of Neptune's 
temple - 
His breast must have been protected all round with oak and 
bronze, who first launched bis frail boat on the rough sea. . . . 
TI. ocean is the largest expanse on Earth and 
the vastest resource available to humankind. It 
contains in abundance, in a state of continual 
regeneration, the source of life from which the 
human race emerged. It inspires the industry of 
Homo faber and whets the imagination of Homo 
sapiens, stimulating his creative genius and 
challenging his spirit of adventure and courage. 
The scientific, technological, industrial, economic 
and social responses to the ocean’s hold on the 
human imagination may be grouped under four 
headings, each of which corresponds to a dream: 
the achievements of the maritime genius (walking 
on the sea); the conquest of the abyss (penetrating 
the ocean depths); the exploitation of the oceans 
(harvesting food from the sea); the new Atlantis 
(inhabiting the sea). These are the four great 
pillars of Neptune’s temple. 
The achievements of the 
maritime genius 
Free man, you will always cherish the sea 
(Charles Baudelaire) 
The sea has inspired human genius to invent a 
host of navigational devices. The Greeks, the 
Chinese, the Arabs, the Portuguese, the 
Spaniards, the British, the Italians, and the 
French, among other peoples, may claim to have 
invented the astrolabe, the compass, portulans 
and sea charts, the chronometer for calculating 
longitudes, the anchor and rigging, the keel and 
66 the rudder. The polders of Holland and the 
(Horace, Odes, 1, 111, 9) 
embankments promised for Bangladesh, the artifi- 
cial harbour of Arromanches and the Channel 
Tunnel rank with with the lighthouse of Alex- 
andria as Wonders of the World. The Statue of 
Liberty in New York harbour and the Colossus 
of Rhodes were born of the same spirit of inven- 
tion. Dictionaries in every language abound in 
words that designate things and events 
experienced, dreamed of and created under the 
sway of the sea. However, the ship remains the 
most beautiful of these creations. 
Many peoples have left the mark of their 
genius on the design of ships which have been 
the witnesses and often the agents of their des- 
tiny. The history of science and technology, 
which forms the infrastructure of the history of 
civilizations, is a fresco in which naval pomp and 
circumstance play as big a part as they do on the 
Bayeux Tapestry. The English poet John Masefield 
wrote of a “Quinquireme of Nineveh from dis- 
tant Ophir/Rowing home to haven in sunny 
Palestine/With a cargo of ivory”. Today, twenty- 
seven centuries later, giant oil tankers ply in their 
wake. 
The strands of legend and history, dream and 
reality, have been woven into a rich tapestry of

### 89110: The Four pillars of Neptune's temple

In 1868, Jules Verne described for the enchant- 
ment of generations of “children in love with 
maps and prints”, how Professor Aronnax and 
his two companions discovered beneath the 
pounding waves Captain Nemo’s electrically- 
powered steel monster the Nautilus, as vainly pur- 
sued and harpooned by Ned Land as the white 
whale Moby Dick had been in 1851 by Captain 
Ahab in Melville’s novel. 
Less than a century after Jules Verne, the 
American nuclear submarine Nautilus became the 
first vessel to sail beneath the polar ice-cap and 
took only a few years to cover more than ten 
times “Twenty Thousand Leagues under the 
Sea”. Also in our own time, the divers of the 
French vessel Calypso descended to the most 
secret corners of the “World of Silence”; the 
“Extraordinary Voyages” of Jules Verne’s imagi- 
nation were emulated in real life by Comman- 
dant Jacques-Yves Cousteau; while the French 
marine engineer Camille Rougeron amused him- 
self by designing a submarine supertanker which 
could carry several million tonnes of crude from 
one deepwater terminal to another. May God 
preserve us! 
All these feats, both mental and physical, 
were performed a few cables beneath the surface, 
in the blue sea that is penetrated, caressed and 
brought to life by the not totally absorbed rays 
of the Sun. However, no one ventured into the 
ocean depths until the early 1930s when William 
Beebe and Otis Barton made the first dives in the 
bathysphere, a steel sphere suspended on a cable 
attached to a boat. By 1934 these courageous men 
had reached a depth of just under 1,000 metres. 
It was not until 1954, twenty years after 
Beebe and Barton’s exploit, which was without 
practical consequences but had a catalytic effect 
on the collective imagination, that psychological 
taboos and technological obstacles to deep-sea 
exploration were finally overcome when Georges 
Houot and Pierre Willm in the bathyscaphe 
FNRS 3 reached a depth of more than 4,500 
metres off Dakar. The spherical cabin of the 
bathyscaphe, which was made of high-quality 
steel, had to resist pressures of over 400 kg per 
cm? Its success was due to the scientific imagi- 
nation of professor Auguste Piccard, the 
engineering skills of French submarine con- 
structors, and the courage of the two pioneer 
divers. 
The hidden depths of the ocean have been

occasions—to a depth of 9,050 metres in the 
Kouriles trench by Houot and Willm in 1958 
aboard the Archiméde, and frequently in recent 
years at the mid-Atlantic ridge, where the con- 
tinental plates supporting Europe and America 
meet and fray. Although no sea monster has yet 
appeared, this does not necessarily mean that such 
monsters do not exist. Neither have the stocks 
of living creatures which accumulate at certain 
depths according to the hypothesis proposed by 
the Danish oceanographer Hans Petterson! ever 
yet been seen beneath the arc lights (which 
perhaps drive them away). 
The exploitation of the oceans 
The sea is the forest 
(Victor Hugo, Les pauvres gens) 
The most imaginative and universal poet of the 
nineteenth century, exiled at the age of fifty on 
a cliff overlooking the sea, regarded the sea as a 
sterile and frightening immensity, a cemetery of 
wrecks, a hostile power, a source of uncontroll- 
able energy ready to crush and bury the coastal 
poor who were condemned to forage for their 
meagre food supplies using ways and means that 
had hardly changed since biblical times. 
AF XARE & 
  
  
 
Within less than two generations, this night- 
mare situation had changed into a far more 
hopeful one. Lone fishermen were replaced by 
industrial fisheries. Then came the development 
of aquaculture. Soon it will be possible to order 
robots by remote control to shovel up the man- 
ganese nodules which carpet the seabed. If ther- 
monuclear fusion of hydrogen in confined con- 
ditions is successfully developed, the sea—which 
contains inexhaustible supplies of hydrogen—will 
become the reservoir of a virtually free and non- 
polluting energy source, which could satisfy all 
our energy needs in a new golden age. Perhaps 
we shall see a happy ending to the wonderful Per- 
sian story of the poor fisherman who cast his net 
after imploring Allah and invoking Moses and 
caught a bottle which he was unwise enough to 
uncork after breaking the seal of Solomon to do 
so. A genie emerged from the bottle “in the form 
of smoke which rose to the clouds, billowing over 
the sea . . . before solidifying into a monstrous 
giant”. The genie would have wiped out the over- 
curious fisherman if the latter had not persuaded 
it to get back into the bottle. For us the genie 
was the cataclysmic mushroom cloud which rose 
above the Pacific Ocean off the island of Bikini 
on 26 May 1956 after the testing of a ther- 
monuclear bomb. Today there are grounds for 
hoping that scientists working on nuclear fusion 
may return this particular genie to its bottle, pos- 
sibly in the form of a Tokamak? or some other 
form of apparatus serving this fourth and last 
pillar of Neptune's temple. 
The new Atlantis 
The sea begins and ceases and then again begins 
And when after thought I long rest my gaze 
On the calm of the gods, I have here my reward. . . . 
But the wind is rising! . . . I must try to live! 
(Paul Valéry, Le Cimetiére Marin) 
The imagination and the sea have been closely 
linked ever since the legend of Atlantis. But is 
it really a legend?* Whatever the case, it may be 
converted (or restored) to reality. More and more 
people dream of lotus-eating on tropical islands, 
and holiday clubs and leisure centres of all kinds 
are proliferating. Offshore oil platforms could 
already serve as models or embryos for earthly 
paradises. 
We must aim higher and settle in ever more 
remote locations. Today it is possible to build off- 
shore and even way out to sea, far from the dirt 
and noise of cities, islands dedicated to the higher 
pursuits of humanity. Habitations can be built 
above the deep blue waters, looking out over a 
vast expanse, the inviolate horizon and “the calm 
of the gods”, but above all in the freedom of the 
open sea, subject only to international law. The

auspices of the World Confederation of Under-

### 89111: The Diver's lonely world

THE DIVER'S LONELY WORLD 
T. pearls described in sixth-century-BC Sin- 
ghalese and Indian literature and the sponges 
mentioned by Homer and Hippocrates must have 
been fished by divers. The oldest unequivocal 
reference to diving is in book sixteen of the 
liad, in which Patroclus gives the following 
description of the Trojan Cebriones whom he 
has just hit with a stone and knocked from his 
chariot: “Ha! Quite an acrobat, | see, judging 
by that graceful dive! The man who takes so neat 
a header from a chariot on land could dive for 
oysters from a ship at sea in any weather and 
fetch up plenty for a feast. | did not know the 
Trojans had such divers.” Thucydides and other 
historians of Antiquity also describe how divers 
managed to take enemy fleets by surprise. 
The first skin divers certainly lived in parts 
of the world such as the east Mediterranean and 
Polynesia and on the shores of the Yellow Sea 
in southeast Asia where there was a combina- 
tion of several favourable factors for diving, 
including relatively calm seas, clear water, and 
a temperature enabling divers to stay in the 
water for a reasonable time. 
Until the end of the Renaissance diving was 
limited in time (by lung capacity) and depth (by 
visibility). From the time of the Roman author 
Vegetius in the fifth century to that of Leonardo 
da Vinci in the fifteenth, people thought of con- 
necting the diver to the surface by means of 
an air tube, but attempts to do so came to 
nothing since certain principles of hydrostatics 
(the branch of mechanics which deals with the 
equilibrium of fluids) were only established by 
Pascal in the seventeenth century, It then 
became known that an underwater swimmer 
breathing through a tube linked to the surface 
needs to exert a force greater than the water 
pressure in order to inhale. The human respira- 
tory muscles are weak. Two metres underwater 
the effort to inhale is very tiring, and impossible 
any deeper. 
Nevertheless, experiments with diving bells 
were carried out during this period. These bell- 
shaped hulls open to the water at the bottom 
were modelled on saucepans or on the urns 
containing air which Roman divers placed on 
the seabed, with the mouth facing downwards, 
and used to supply themselves with air. 
‘BELLS AND CAISSONS 
In 1690, Edmond Halley invented a method of 
renewing the air inside the diving bell from 
barrels lowered to the seabed. 
Taking up an idea formulated a hundred 
years before by Denis Papin, the English 
engineer John Smeaton (1724-1792) went one 
step further when he fitted a pump to the bell 
in order to provide it with fresh air from a ship 
on the surface. 
But diving bells were heavy, unwieldy, and 
difficult to use. A diver has to breathe air at the 
surrounding water pressure, the inflow of air 
must be sufficient to keep him or her supplied 
with oxygen, and carbon dioxide must be elimi- 
70 nated so that it is not reinhaled. 
Early in the nineteenth century, the German 
engineer Augustus Siebe took the decisive step 
of providing the diver with a “bell” tailored to 
his own size—a diving suit in which the diver 
was equipped with a copper helmet with port- 
holes, and supplied with compressed air 
pumped from the surface. The supply of air was 
continuous, and excess air escaped through the 
edge of the helmet below the chin. By 1837 
Siebe had developed an improved model with 
a valve which let air out without letting water in. 
Inventers next tried to make an autono- 
mous diving suit which would free divers from 
the need to be in contact with the surface and 
enable them to move about more easily. 
Borelli (1680), Fréminet (1776), Forfait 
(1783), Klingberg (1796) and de Drieberg with 
the Triton (1811) had already tried to construct 
apparatus of this kind, in which the diver 
breathed through the mouth by means of a tube 
connected to a container carried on his back 
and caused the air to circulate by activating a 
bellows with movements of the head. 
Further improvements were added by W.H. 
James (1825-1828) and then by Condert, who 
designed a system for adjusting the supply of 
compressed air, a primitive regulator and a free 
escape system for surplus air. Cabirol improved 
this apparatus even further in 1885. 
SCUBA DIVING 
In 1860, a French mining engineer, Benoit Rou- 
quayrol, and a naval officer, Auguste Denay- 
rouze, made a decisive improvement to the 
diving suit when they invented a regulator, a 
valve which provides air at a pressure equal to 
the prevailing water pressure. 
In 1864, a swimmer equipped with a gas 
regulator supplied by a pump on the surface 
could thus easily move around up to 40 metres 
down. 
In the following year, these brilliant 
inventors devised a system for providing the air 
supply directly from a container carried on the 
diver's back. This was the birth of modern 
SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing 
apparatus) diving. 
Divers could now operate for up to half an 
hour at a depth of ten metres without any link 
with the surface. The apparatus was outstand- 
ingly successful. Jules Verne understood its 
potential immediately and equipped Captain 
Nemo and his men with it in Twenty Thousand 
Leagues under the Sea. [|

UNESCO IN ACTION 
ENVIRONMENT 
ca ,- EE 
E.. us human beings the ocean is an alien 
environment where there are no familiar fea- 
tures to help us get our bearings, a place of 
which we still know little. Sometimes we over- 
estimate its wealth, sometimes we neglect its 
importance. We behave as if the oceans can 
absorb anything, and do not suspect that they 
play a crucial role in the regulation of climate. 
We think that there are unlimited stocks of 
fish, whereas in reality world fishing has 
already reached saturation point. Where the 
sea 1s concerned, we seem to find it hard to 
distinguish myth from reality. . . 
These contradictions between what we 
believe and what is true, between what we 
want and what is possible, are nowhere more 
apparent than in the Mediterranean, that “sea 
in the midst of land”, the cradle and crossroads 
of ancient civilizations, which is today pointed 
to as an example of pollution and degradation. 
What are the facts, and what does the future 
hold for these shores “where the orange tree 
blossoms”? 
Since 1976, political and economic differ- 
ences notwithstanding, all the Mediterranean 
countries have been co-operating within the 
framework of the Barcelona Convention to 
protect their common sea from pollution. The 
Mediterranean is a closed sea, without big 
tides, and accidents like those involving the 
Amoco Cadiz off Brittany in 1978 or the Exxon 
Valdez off Alaska in 1989 could have disas- 
trous consequences for the historic cities on 
its shores, for its beaches, for its tourist and 
port facilities, and for the fragile economy of 
its coastal regions. A small oil slick which 
recently appeared off Genoa caused conster- 
nation on the Italian and French rivieras. 
“Integrated coastal management comes up against 
administrative compartmentallzation.” 


### 89112: The Blue Plan for the Mediterranean

  
The Blue Plan for the Mediterranean 
hy Michel Batisse 
Naturally enough, co-operation between 
the Mediterranean countries focused initially 
on risks of oil spills and the discharge of toxic 
wastes and other pollutants. However it soon 
became clear that the harm being done to the 
sea originated mainly from the land—from the 
coast, from rivers, and from the atmosphere. 
Contrary to what is often said, the main 
sources of offshore pollution in the Mediter- 
ranean are plastic bags, lumps of tar and occa- 
sional algae blooms produced by nutrient-rich 
agricultural fertilizer. On the coast, however, 
the situation varies widely. On the one hand 
there are sparsely populated areas which are 
still very clean; on the other there are zones 
where considerable chemical and bacteriolog- 
ical pollution is caused by urban, industrial 
and agricultural wastes. It is on the coastal 
regions of the Mediterranean countries that 
human activities are focused and where all 
kinds of pressures are created. 
The Mediterranean basin, whether consi- 
dered in its totality or in terms of individual 
countries, provinces and sites, behaves as a 
“system” whose components act and react 
together. Any attempt to understand the 
present and possible future situation of the 
Mediterranean has to be based on an analysis 
of the system and its possible futures. Any 
action which affects only one or another of 
the components of the system and ignores the 
overt or covert links between them runs the 
risk of failure. It may, for instance, be futile 
to try to attract more tourists to a stretch of 
coast where the necessary water resources are 
not available, or if a polluting industry is 
created nearby. 
The Mediterranean countries decided to 
produce a system-based and future-oriented 
study which would help them to understand 
the nature and extent of current developments

and to make sound policy decisions. This tool 
is the Blue Plan. In it population is regarded 
as the primary component in the Mediterra- 
nean system, for it is people who, by their 
number, age, needs, aspirations and move- 
ments, are the dominant factor of change since 
they act directly, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively, on all the other components of 
the system—agriculture, industry, energy, 
tourism, transport, soils, forests, continental 
waters, the coastal areas and the sea itself. 
Scenarios for the future 
In the Blue Plan, 2 number of scenarios have 
been constructed for the Mediterranean 
system until the year 2025. They are based on 
coherent sets of hypotheses relating to demo- 
graphic change, to types of development and 
the growth rates that result from them, to 
environmental policies, and to levels of co- 
operation between the northern and southern 
Mediterranean countries. 
Of course these scenarios do not claim to 
predict the future, which will doubtless emerge 
from the course of history as erratically as it 
always has. But they aim to show what may 
happen in the logic of things, depending on

Fishermen are depicted 
on this mosaic from the ancient city of Utica, 
Tunisia (4th century AD), 
whether or not certain conditions exist. Two 
types of scenario have been constructed: so- 
called “trend” scenarios which, to a greater 
or lesser degree, prolong observable current 
developments in different parts of the system; 
and “alternative” scenarios which depart con- 
siderably from current developments, pay 
more attention to the environment, and are 
based on far more effective economic and tech- 
nical co-operation between the countries of 
the northern shores of the Mediterranean and 
those of the south and east. The latter coun- 
tries are and will be in a far more difficult posi- 
tion than those of the north. The population 
of their Mediterranean coastal regions may rise 
from 60 million today to somewhere between 
100 and 130 million in the year 2025, whereas 
population in the northern countries may 
only rise from 80 to 90 million at most. Popu- 
lation growth alone would create a parallel 
growth in needs, with major socio-economic 
and environmental consequences. 
The results of the different scenarios of the 
Blue Plan are too complex to be summarized 
in a few lines. It is clear however that the trend 
: : " 3 
| eo b 4 vr phe | 
HE Sr AC hy 
scenarios describe situations which it is hard 
to accept from either an ecological or an eco- 
nomic point of view, They suggest the whole- 
sale destruction of coastal landscapes by ram- 
pant urbanization, increased pollution, 
damage to the terrestrial and marine environ- 
ment, and a marked deterioration in living 
conditions in the countries of the south. The 
figures are alarming. To take but one example, 
between now and 2025, an average of one 
power station would have to be built every 
twenty kilometres from the coast of Morocco 
to that of Turkey. 
The alternative scenarios are of course 
more acceptable, even if they are based on the 
supposition that major difficulties will have 
been overcome. The most obvious of these 
difficulties concerns the radical change in poli- 
cles implicit in the channelling of massive aid 
from north to south. At the same time there 
would have to be a real change in attitudes, 
both in the north and in the south, towards 
the environment and the consumption of 
resources. Perhaps the rarest of these resources 
is fresh water, whose scarcity imposes con- 
siderable limitations on development in many 
Mediterranean countries, and which will have 
to be economically and rigorously managed. 73

74 
The most threatened resource, however, 
is the coastline itself. It is there that the most 
serious conflicts arise about land use. I would 
cite one example to illustrate the importance 
of the choices which will have to be made. By 
the beginning of the next century, almost all 
the Mediterranean countries will have to 
import much of their food. To obtain the 
necessary foreign currency, their most pre- 
cious capital will in many cases be a natural 
and cultural heritage which is concentrated on 
the coast. Depending on the scenario, these 
areas may be visited by between 125 and 190 
million foreign tourists each year from Europe 
or elsewhere. But the coast will not attract 
tourists if it is blighted by anarchic building 
and infrastructure development and by all 
kinds of pollution on land, on the beaches and 
at sea. There are other places where tourists 
can go. 
Priority to the coast 
If the idea of “saving” the Mediterranean is 
to make any sense at all, it is essential that the 
coastline be properly managed. All the com- 
ponents of the “coastal system” must be taken 
into account, both on land (controlled urban 
development, wastewater treatment, agricul- 
ture without excessive discharge of fertilizers 
and pesticides, respect for productive land, 
appropriately sited industries and clean tech- 
nologies, the control of air and water-polluting 
emissions at source, the development of 
highways and airports in the hinterland, the 
conservation of forests and humid zones) and 
at sea (the development of ports with debal- 
lasting facilities for ships, control of dredging 
and waste disposal, the disposal of wastewater 
offshore, limitations on marina development, 
the protection of aquatic plant life and the 
seabed, regulation of fishing). 
Unfortunately, there is no tradition of 
integrated coastal management of this kind. 
In most countries matters concerning the land 
and those concerning the sea are handled by 
different parts of the administrative system. 
MICHEL BATISSE, 
French engineer and physicist, is internationally 
known for his work on the environment and 
natural resources. Currently a consultant with 
UNESCO and the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), he has headed the Blue Plan 
Regional Activity Centre for the Mediterranean at 
Sophia Antipolis, France, since it was created 
in 1985. 
Integrated management conflicts with cor- 
poratism, private interests and administrative 
compartmentalization. However, there is 
reason to react, and all those of us who are

interested in the sea or go to the seaside can 
do something to help. 
The Blue Plan for the Mediterranean 
shows both the limits and the possibilities of 
protecting the shoreline. It also shows that 
other blue plans could be useful for the future 
of other regions. By the very nature of the 
problems that exist there—between north and 
south, between the environment and develop- 
ment, between land and sea—the Mediterra- 
nean basin is a truly representative microcosm 
of the planet as a whole. 
The Blue Plan has been 
published in English under 
the title Futures for the 
| Mediterranean Basin (Oxford 
University Press, 1990).  
This region has seen a succession of rich 
and varied civilizations: Egyptians and Phoe- 
nicians, Greeks and Hittites, Romans and Car- 
thaginians, Arabs and Franks, the Italian 
Renaissance, the rise of the modern world. It 
was doubtless right and proper that it should 
break new ground in reflecting on the future. 
But now it must vigorously continue the 
action it has begun so that its future will be 
worthy of its past. Time is running out if we 
are to modify or reverse the degradation of 
the coastline. If Venus, goddess of beauty, 
daughter of the Mediterranean, ever rises from 
the waves again, let us make sure that she is 
not covered with red algae, plastic and tar.

### 89113: An Ecological Eldorado: Peru's Manu National Park

An ecological Eldorado: Peru's Manu 
National 
Park 
by Jose SerraVega 
M... National Park in south-east Peru 
rises from the sweltering fastnesses of the 
Amazonian forest up through a labyrinth of 
giddying scarps to an altitude of 4,000 metres 
on the eastern slopes of the Andes. The two 
great rivers that flow through the region, the 
Manu and the Madre de Dios, rush down from 
the high plateaux to the plain where, slack- 
ening their course, they meander along 
through a succession of different ecosystems 
and climates, joining up to flow together into 
the Amazon. 
In the west, flocks of vicunas, the occa- 
sional guemal (a small American deer) and 
fearsome mountain lions roam across the 
frozen peaks and the cold, wind-swept 
plateaux dotted with black lakes where all that 
grows is a coarse yellow grass known as ichu. 
From time to time a spectacled bear can be 
seen, a species found nowhere else in South 
America. The mountain forest stretches out 
further down between altitudes of 3,800 and 
2,500 metres, shrouded in thick mist. Lower 
down the temperature rises and rainfall 
increases, making for a proliferation of plant 
and animal life. Manu National Park consists 
mainly of tropical rainforest whose tangle of 
giant trees, creepers, plant parasites and 
orchids, climbing plants and epiphytes, pro- 
vides a habitat for a huge variety of wildlife. 
In the vast Amazonian plain down below, the 
river Manu winds its way through a valley 
 
made well-nigh impenetrable by the density 
of the vegetation, forming in places oxbow 
lakes—cochas—which teem with aquatic life. 
The lure of the unknown 
For centuries people have been drawn to the 
Amazon by the lure of the unknown, a thirst 
for adventure and the prospect of fortune. The 
Incas of Cuzco sought to expand their empire 
in this region and found themselves with no 
choice but to trade with the warlike tribes of 
the region in order to obtain the colourful 
feathers with which they decorated their 
ceremonial costumes and the hallucinogenic 
and medicinal plants on which they relied. 
Legend has it that Paititi, the lost city 
where the Incas are believed to have hidden 
enormous quantities of gold and silver after 
learning of the murder of their ruler Atahu- 
alpa at the hands of the Spanish conqueror 
Francisco Pizarro, was located in the Manu

region. The Spanish armies, in their search for 
this Eldorado and its fabulous treasures, 
penetrated deep into the jungle where they 
were decimated by disease and hostile Indians, 
They too ended up by abandoning all attempts 
to settle there. 
For three more centuries it was not 
known whether the rivers in the Madre de 
Dios basin flowed northwards or westwards. 
Some geographers of the time, who embel- 
lished their maps with mythical creatures and 
monstrous caimans, thought that the 
Amazon's source lay somewhere within it, 
The rubber boom in the late nineteenth 
century attracted thousands of adventurers to 
the area. For twenty-odd years the tapping of 
trees for latex was a thriving industry and 
Amazonia edged its way into the world 
market, but competition from the British 
plantations in Asia brought this activity to a 
sudden end.

only to be shaken off in the 1960s with the 
development of the trade in furs—ocelor, 
Jaguar, otter, black lizard—and exotic wood— 
mainly mahogany and cedar. Around the same 
time people started taking an interest in the 
exceptional biological resources to be found 
there. In 1968 the Peruvian authorities 
organized an expedition into the basin of the 
river Manu and its tributary the Sotileja. On 
the basis of the information collected, they 
declared Manu a national park in June 1973. 
In 1977 UNESCO recognized it as a biosphere 
reserve and since 1987 it has been on the 
World Heritage List. 
The core of the biosphere reserve is Manu 
National Park, which has an area of 15,328 
km? from which all economic or touristic 
activities are barred. It 1s bounded in the east 
by a buffer zone measuring some 2,500 km? 
where the aim is to preserve the forest while 
allowing limited tourism and scientific 
research. Further south is a transitional zone 
covering 900 km? inhabited by a few settlers 
and by Indian communities which continue 
to practise their traditional activities, within 
set bounds. 
The Cocha Cashu biological observatory 
was established in 1969 beside a cutoff of the 
river Manu. Its laboratories and research facil- 
ities can accommodate about twenty 
researchers. The work done there has helped 
to provide a fuller picture of the forms of life 
present 1 the reserve and of tropical forest 
ecosystems in general. Another observatory 
is being built outside the national park so that 
certain studies can be carried out which are 
not allowed in the park itself. But there is a 
huge amount to be done. The forest harbours 
countless mysteries. We know little about its 
aquatic forms of life and virtually nothing 
about the tropical montane rainforest or the 
grasslands of the high plateaux or punas. 
In a sense, then, the legendary treasures 
of Eldorado do exist in the form of the sixteen 
ecosystems present within the 18,800 km? of 
the reserve, which have remained practically 
intact since the dawn of time. 
Parrots, monkeys, and turtles 
The most characteristic feature of the tropical 
rainforest is doubtless its fabulous diversity. 
It would be impossible here to list even the 
main forest species in the reserve. To give 
some idea of its biological resources, 
researchers have identified 1,200 vascular 
plants within an area of 4 km? around the 
76 Cocha Cashu observatory. One tenth of the 
 
Macaws, members of 
the parrot family which often 
live in groups. 
plants in the reserve have not yet been identi- 
fied and may belong to species hitherto 
unknown to scientists. When an inventory 
was made of canopy insects within one hec- 
tare of rainforest, 41,000 species of inver- 
tebrates were found, including 12,000 kinds 
of beetle. In one single tree there were 43 types 
of ant belonging to 26 different genera, prac- 
tically as many as in the whole of the British 
Isles. 


### 89113: An Ecological Eldorado: Peru's Manu National Park

No less than fifteen per cent of the world’s 
bird species are found in Manu park, whose 
denizens include majestic condors, tiny hum- 
mingbirds, and noisy black and yellow 
icteridae whose hanging nests look like great 
purses made of straw. There are twenty-eight 
species of macaws and parrots, including the 
very rare blue-headed parrot. 
From beneath the trees these birds are 
easier to hear than to see, but they can some- 
times be glimpsed in the open spaces along the 
river. At sunrise a squawking, multicoloured 
flight of parrots can sometimes be seen 
swooping down on the furrowed banks of the 
Manu to gobble up the clay which is rich in 
mineral salts. Herons, wild geese and ducks, 
delicate spoonbills and other gangling waders 
mingle on the shores with sleepy caimans that 
can move into action with devastating speed. 
Kingfishers, large-billed toucans and stiletto- 
billed snakebirds also live by the river, feeding 
on its plentiful supply of aquatic animals. 
Perhaps the strangest bird of all is the hoatzin, 
which nests at the riverside. Its young have 
claws on their wings which they use to 
clamber about in the trees before they learn 
to fly. Its digestive system resembles that of 
ruminants. 
The forest is also the habitat of monkeys, 
thirteen species of which have so far been 
identified, including the tiny pygmy marmoset, 
the smallest in the world, which weighs barely 
120 grams, the restless emperor tamarin, 
which owes its name to its superb white 
moustaches, worthy of emperor Franz-Josef 
of Austria, the spider monkey and the howling 
monkey whose roars, imitating those of the 
jaguar, have curdled the blood of more than 
one tourist. 
The jaguar itself, like the puma and the 
ocelot, is mainly nocturnal but can be seen 
prowling along the river bank at the time of 
the year when turtles come there to lay their 
eggs. Tapirs, peccaries and wild dogs come to 
the water during the daytime to drink. There 
are also many other mammals—small bats 
which sleep head downwards, hanging from 
the branches over the cochas, vampire bats 
which live exclusively on blood, giant 
anteaters and armadillos, some of which weigh 
as much as fifty kilograms. 
There are also large numbers of giant 
otters. Much sought after for their valuable 
furs, these carnivorous mammals once came 
near to extinction in the Amazon basin. 
Insatiably curious and extremely fast-moving 
in the water, otters hunt and fish in groups. 
Endowed with powerful teeth, they do not 
hesitate to attack one-and-a-half-metre-long 
caimans in order to defend their young or 
obtain food. 
Many dangers lurk in this spellbindingly 
beautiful world, vibrant with sounds and 
colours. In the forests and swamps there are

poisonous snakes and other dangerous crea- 
tures. The most fearsome and aggressive of the 
snakes is the deadly bushmaster (Lachesis 
muta), which can be more than three metres 
long and is reputed to pursue people who are 
foolhardy enough to cross its path. The most 
common reptiles are pit vipers of the genus 
Bothrops, which are capable of detecting 
sources of heat from a distance and can thus 
hunt in the dark, and the brightly-coloured 
coral snakes of the genus Micrurus, which are 
distant cousins of the Asian and African 
cobras. The rivers and lakes are the home of 
the anaconda and the gigantic aquatic boa 
which can be as much as nine metres long. By 
the riverside or on drifting trunks it is not 
uncommon to see river turtles basking in the 
sun in the company of black lizards. The largest 
reptile in the reserve, which has been observed 
at Cocha Cashu, 1s a black female lizard nearly 
five metres long and over 500 kilos in weight. 
The forest hunters 
The most mysterious area in the reserve is the 
Pusharo gorge, a colossal gateway through 
which the river Palotoa finds its way out of 
the mountains. On one side of the gorge, con- 
cealed by the vegetation, is a thirty-metre-long 
frieze of rock carvings which display solar 
symbols, snakes, women’s heads, spirals and 
crisscross patterns. Behind, a ramp, which is 
probably artificial, leads to a stone terrace. 
Like many other examples of rock art scat- 
tered through Amazonia, they have been 
neither studied nor interpreted. They are the 
remains of a forgotten Amazonian culture 
probably dating back to the earliest settlers in 
America. 
Today very few people live in this com- 
plex and wonderful setting. A few Amahuaca 
and Yaminahua Indians live in the valleys of 
the Panahua and Pinquén rivers and in the 
northeastern part of the reserve. In the rainy 
season, the Neolithic Amahuaca hunters, 
fishermen and farmers return to the sources 
of the two rivers to tend their crops. During 
the dry season, from July to December, they 
go back to the banks of the Manu where they 
harvest the river turtle eggs which are the main 
source of protein in their diet. The indigenous 
peoples have permission to live on the 
resources of the reserve, and care is taken not 
to disturb their traditional way of life, which 
is the result of thousands of years of adapta- 
tion to the harsh forest environment. 
Even more mysterious are the Kugapakori, 
who lead 2 nomadic existence between the 
basins of the Madre de Dios and the Uru- 
bamba. They jealously defend their territory 
and shoot arrows at anyone who crosses the 
invisible frontier that runs around i. 
The Machiguenga people are very 
different. Converted to the ways of the 
modern world, some have settled in the vil- 
lage of Tayakome, a distance of five hours by 
canoe upstream from Cocha Cashu, where 
missionaries brought them from their home 
territory in the upper reaches of the Uru- 
bamba valley. The rest live in small scattered 
groups consisting of a few households, 
provided by the government with rudimen- 
tary schools and with teachers, many of whom 
speak their language.

make space for big stock-raising farms. 
A multinational oil company has disco- 
vered an enormous deposit of natural gas at 
the north-east edge of the Manu Park, which 
is believed to extend beneath the actual 
reserve. A camp set up for the prospectors has 
already caused incalculable harm. Wild 
animals have been exterminated, rivers have 
been polluted with oil and chemical products 
and indigenous groups have been driven from 
their traditional hunting grounds. 
But this is nothing in comparison with the 
ecological and human disaster that would be 
triggered by the installation of a pipeline to 
transport gas to Cuzco, along with a power 
station which would produce electricity 
exported to Brazil via a 350-km-long high- 
voltage cable, 120 km of which would pass 
though the reserve. Almost 300 km of a road 
planned to run from Puerto Bermtdez, in the 
centre of Peru, to the frontier of Bolivia would 
cross the northern part of the reserve.

### 89114: The Return of the Fulk al-Salamah

The return of the Fulk al-Salamah 
by Francois-Bemard Huyghe 
Ox 25 April 1991 the Fulk al-Salamab, the 
“Ship of Peace”, dropped anchor in the port 
of Mina Qabus in Muscat. Six weeks had 
already gone by since the ship, which had been 
loaned by Sultan Qabus of Oman to 
UNESCO's Maritime Silk Roads expedition, 
had left its passengers at Hakata, Japan. But 
the festivities to celebrate the return of the cap- 
tain and his crew had been postponed until 
the end of Ramadan. Like the celebrations on 
17 November last that had marked the start 
of the voyage, these were in traditional Omani 
style and featured hundreds of dancers. 
It would be an understatement to say that 
the expedition received a royal welcome. Her- 
alded by fireboats spouting great jets of water 
and with a helicopter whirring above our 
heads, escorted by launches and patrol ships 
and encircled by a flotilla of white boats 
decked out in the national colours, our ship 
pulled into port. There we were greeted by 
floating rigs adorned with the United Nations 
flag, the Sultan’s portrait and a mysterious 
flower that several of us—clearly no great 
shakes as botanists—took for a lotus, seeing 
it as a possible symbol of East-West relations, 
Later we were told that the flower thus 
depicted was a new variety of rose, the “Sultan 
Qabus”. 
But it was the noises that made the strong- 
est impression: drumbeat, chanting and 
whooping sounds punctuated the dances per- 
formed by hundreds of dancers on board boats 
crammed with people. They brandished sticks, 
swords and kandjars—the traditional dagger 
sported by Omani men on solemn occasions. 
Meanwhile, on land, ministers, members of 
the royal family, an escort, other dances, and 
a procession of official cars awaited us. . . . 
Our arrival in Muscat coincided with the 
twentieth anniversary of the Sultan's accession 
to power. In actual fact, what was being 
celebrated in the city, transformed into a daz 
zling tricolour array by thousands of light 
bulbs in the national colours—green, red and 
white—was the amazing leap in time that had 
78 been made in less than a generation, and the 
change that had occurred in people’s minds. 
It was the transition, effected through dynastic 
succession and with the help of petrodollars, 
from an Oman immersed in its history, where 
electricity and sunglasses were suspected of 
bringing the evils of modernism, to the most 
up-to-date form of civilization. And yet, here 
more than anywhere else, there was clearly a 
concern to maintain spiritual values, and evi- 
dence of a discipline that seemed to be freely 
accepted. 
The stereotype image is of an “Arabian 
Switzerland”, of a place where camels and 
computers exist side by side, but what I actu- 
ally saw was: a city rebuilt in accordance with 
aesthetic standards which endow it with unity; 
a military parade ended with a tribal march- 
past featuring ancient rites of war; sheiks from 
Dofar visiting an ultra-modern cultural centre 
in Salalah, amazed to see objects from their 
everyday lives being displayed in showcases; 
hundreds of youngsters moving together in 
unison to create an electronic tableau vivant 
reminiscent of the opening of the Olympic 
Games, and in the stands every single man 
without exception dressed in the traditional 
Omani costume. Few places present such 
striking contrasts. 
[ leave 1t to better-informed observers than 
I to explain how the people can experience 
such a culture shock while remaining seem- 
ingly unperturbed. I would also ask them to 
make allowances for what may be no more 
than a superficial impression. 
Losing our bearings 
But for us passengers of the Fulk al-Salamah 
the culture shock had been even greater. We 
had left behind us the agricultural and urban 
Mediterranean world with its layer cake of 
different cultures, and found ourselves face to 
face with something radically other. The Euro- 
pean writer of these lines, who had been 
taught to see the succession of Egyptian, 
Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic civili- 
zations as a harmonious continuum within

which “influences” could be identified and 
studied, was gradually losing his bearings. 
From kafenion to fonduk, from Memphis to 
Ephesus, from the archaeological museum in 
Athens to the one in Cairo, a line of develop- 
ment could be discerned, or interactions could 
be seen. Now there was no longer any per- 
ceptible pattern, 
At the seminars which we attended ashore 
and during the twice-daily working meetings 
on board we were supposed to be adding to 
our knowledge. Inundated with new informa- 
tion, faced with the impossible task of sum- 
ming up that which constitutes the fabric of 
all the different cultures, namely exchange,

could at least try to remember what our points 
of reference were, for they seemed to have 
gone astray somewhere in the Red Sea. 
In Athens, we hadn't yet lost the thread. 
It was—excuse the play on words—silk. We 
knew that the introduction of this precious 
fibre in ancient Rome had triggered a riot of 
indulgence and a craze for imported fabrics, 
leading finally to a debt of such proportions 
that the English historian Edward Gibbon 
considered it to be one of the causes of the 
fall of the Roman Empire. The case of Byzan- 
tium is no less striking. In the time of the late 
empire silk clothes were highly prized and 
passed on from generation to generation, so 
it is not surprising that the introduction into 
Byzantium of the modest silk-worm in the 
mid-sixth century caused a total upheaval. 
Trade in this precious commodity and its sub- 
sequent manufacture were strictly controlled 
by the state. Silk was also the source of con- 
siderable economic activity in some parts of 
Greece up to the nineteenth century. 
At a seminar in [zmir in Turkey we like- 
wise discovered the role of ancient Smyrna in 
the silk trade and the relationship of the city’s 
periods of prosperity and decline with fluc- 
tuations of the international market. The links 
between the maritime silk route and the 
caravan trails helped to reassure us that we 
were indeed finding similarities and exploring 
a unifying network which was a cause of strife 
among the powerful but which was usually 
kept open in the interests of a deep-rooted 
need for security, 
Little by little, we turned from silk to 
other commodities. The spice road increas- 
ingly attracted our attention, and this was per- 
fectly logical. The expression “silk roads” was 
to be understood not in geographical and eco- 
nomic terms but, to quote one of our fellow 
passengers, as a “‘metaphor of dialogue”. 
A sense of identity 
To return to Oman, what we found bewil- 
dering there was not the absence of such links 
but their profusion. Archaeological studies 
have only recently been undertaken in the 
country, but they already reveal links that 
reach far back into pre-Islamic times. As early 
as the third millennium BC and right up to 
the beginning of the following millennium, 
Oman, the land of Magan, exported copper 
and diorite to Mesopotamia. At the same time 
pottery from Mesopotamia appeared in 
Omani tombs. Similarly, relations between 
Magan culture and the Indus Civilization can 
apparently be traced back to about 2,300 BC. 
A number of stories from later times 
provided us with other examples of cultural 
exchanges between Oman and other countries. 
One of the specialists on board recounted 
to us the tale of an Omani merchant of Indian

origin, Sayyid, who lived in the thirteenth cen- 
tury. Not only did he have frequent and cor- 
dial commercial dealings with the Chinese 
navigators who came to Oman but, when 
Prince Ma’abar took exception to these friend- 
ships, Sayyid fled to the court of Kubla Khan, 
who showered him with gifts and wedded him 
to a Korean princess. He died a rich man in 
Bejing in 1299. 
A story from the early fifteenth century 
concerns the famous Chinese navigator Zheng 
He, a Muslim, who travelled several times to 
El Balidid, present-day Salalah, in the south 
of Oman. Zheng He was provided with inter- 
preters who were trained in a special school; 
their writings are the source of our information 
about his visits to Oman. 
These cases are striking not only because 
they suggest vast areas for study. The first two 
examples take us back several thousand years, 
and far from the regions which the expedition 
had studied. The second two show that rela-

means confined to trade but had a cultural 
dimension. 
The history of Oman, until relatively 
recent times, seems to consist only of accounts 
by foreign observers and of the records of 
trade. For a people which has taken as its 
national heroes Sindbad the Sailor and Vasco 
da Gama’s helmsman, Ahmed bin Majud, 
travel and discovery led not to self-enrichment 
but to identity. 
Coming into port 
With hindsight, our magnificent welcome in 
Muscat came to assume a significance that it 
had not possessed at the moment when we 
landed there. Several times during our voyage 
we had talked about how we had gained 
another sense of time and had come to see 
travelling in another light. We had slipped our 
moorings, both physically and metaphorically, 
forgotten our everyday lives for several 
months and formed a community. We had dis- 
covered that coming into port is an event, that 
it has nothing in common with the triviality 
of modern travel which blots out distances and 
differences. The distant noise of war reached 
us but was somehow muffled. And this helped 
to remind us of the strangeness of our adven- 
ture, causing us to look at the world with new 
eyes. 
One specialist pointed out that the 
presiding geniuses of our journey, Marco Polo 
and Ibn Batuta, had been able to roam freely 
through the then known world without being 
arrested or murdered. What was their secret? 
What signs of peace did they use, what code 
of salutation? Our voyage could be an occa- 
sion for meditating upon the rituals that defuse 
aggression in different cultures. 
If the longest journeys are in the mind,

the flood of sounds and colours that greeted 
us in Muscat or celebrated the homecoming 
of the Fulk al-Salamah perhaps showed that 
the traveller is someone for whom novelty can 
be a source of inner change. Far from the 
world of total and instantaneous media 
coverage, we had come to see things in a 
different way. [|

AEA ALS al 
UNESCO launches 
AIDS appeal 
An appeal for international 
solidarity with the victims of AIDS 
was launched by a group of 
leading personalities meeting 
under UNESCO auspices in Venice 
on 8 June. The signatories of the 
Venice Appeal, which is intended 
to further the Giobal Programme 
on AIDS co-ordinated by the World 
Health Organization (WHO), call on 
all those who wish to fight this 
terrible pandemic to contribute to 
national! programmes to combat 
AIDS in the countries that are 
most stricken in Africa, in order to 
strengthen preventive education, 
training and scientific research, 
and to support those orphaned by 
AIDS, especiaily by covering their 
educational expenses. A bank 
account has been opened for this 
purpose: UNESCO Sidaids World,

Germany supports 
educational projects in 
Sahel 
Under an agreement signed in 
December 1990, Germany is 
contributing 1.5 million dollars to 
a basic education project to be 
carried out by UNESCO in six 
countries of the African Sahel: 
Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, 
Mauritania, Niger and Senegal. 
The first stage of the project will 
last 3 years and is designed to 
enable each of these countries to 
produce 100,000 textbooks for 
use in literacy and post-literacy 
work, 
An ethics of development 
The importance of an ethical code 
of development as a factor in 
lasting peace was emphasized by 
Mr Federico Mayor, Director- 
General of UNESCO, in a recent 
interview with the French daily 
newspaper Le Monde. ‘Together 
we must work out a moral code 
for development”, Mr, Mayor said, 
“which, over and above interest 
rates, technology transfers, the 
price of raw materials, financial 
flows, tariff and non-tariff barriers, 
etc., helps us to devise forms of 
development of which we can all 
be proud, because they 
incorporate universal and eternal 
values, in particular those of law 
and justice.” 
“How'’, he went on, ‘‘can we 
devise forms of human 
development that do not give rise 
to these huge migratory 
movements—resulting in a 
diasporized humanity—, these 
inequalities in respect of food, 
health, education and access to 
scientific and technological 
knowledge that affect hundreds of 
millions of people, the threats 
hanging over the biosphere and 
the environment in general, the 
scourge of ever less cultural and 
biological diversity, loss of values, 
a diminishing sense of solidarity, 
loneliness and drugs? The answer 
that is given to these questions 
will largely determine how we 
reshape international relations.” 
The Arabia Plan 
Within the framework of the World 
Decade for Cultural Development 
(1988-1997), UNESCO has 
faunched a plan for the promotion 
of contemporary Arab culture, 
known as the “Arabia Plan”. 
Among the projects proposed as 
part of the Plan are the creation 
of training fellowships, the setting 
up of a data bank on Arab culture, 
action to provide financial support 
for the international distribution of 
Arab films and to increase public 
awareness of the major 
achievements of Arab art in such 
fields as architecture, miniatures 
and the graphic arts. 
The media and the cultural 
heritage 
A major international conference 
and festival entitled “Media Save 
Art 91” took place in Rome from 
17 to 22 June under the joint 
patronage of UNESCO and the 
Italian Government. The aim was 
to alert public opinion to the 
dangers threatening the culturai 
heritage and to seek closer co- 
operation between the media and 
institutions responsible for 
protecting the heritage. 
Highlights of the occasion 
included an exhibition on the 
restoration of works of art, the 
projection of films and audio- 
visual documents on art and 
culture, and discussions among 
leading specialists on the role of 
the mass media in safeguarding 
the cuitural heritage. 
Mandela and De Klerk 
awarded Houphouét-Boigny 
Peace Prize 
Nelson Mandela and Frederik 
de Klerk, of South Africa, were 
named on 27 June first winners 
of the Houphouét-Boigny 
Peace Prize by an international 
jury of eleven distinguished 
figures nominated by the Director- 
General of UNESCO. The president 
of the jury, Mr Henry Kissinger, 
said that the two prizewinners 
had been chosen for their 
contribution to international 
peace, to encourage them to 
continue their efforts, and as a 
tribute to what they had done to 
educate their peoples towards 
understanding and towards 
overcoming prejudices that many 
considered to be insurmountable 
only a few years ago. 
The prize, worth 800,000 
French francs, will be presented 
later this year. It is intended to 
honour persons, institutions or 
associations that have made a 
significant contribution to the 
promotion, maintenance or 
restoration of peace.

Les nouvelles polyphonies corses. 
CD Philips 81885-2 
This CD 1s an example of the 
worldwide trend to update and 
revitalize folk music. It features 
Corsican vocal music traditionally 
performed a capella but here 
accompanied by Manu Dibango, 
Ryuichi Sakamoto and other 
musicians mainly associated with 
pop music. it might seem sacrilege 
to provide instrumental backing, but 
this in no way detracts from the 
superb voices of the Bonifacio 
church singers. A rough poetry 
(“Onda™, “Terra Brusgiata™), true to 
the spirit of Corsica, is distilled by 
this music whose beauty matches 
that of Bulgarian music, better 
known internationally. 
Radio Bratislava. 
CD Philips 848 207-2 
This is an anthology of the finest 
examples of folk music broadcast 
on the radio stations of Eastern 
Europe (Prague, Budapest, Sofia, 
Thessalonica, Skopje, Warsaw, 
Helsinki, etc.) that have taken part 
in the Bratislava Radic contest over 
the past twenty-odd years. The 
pieces, which are seldom 
performed on the radio, range from 
the fiery to the melancholic. 
Especially noteworthy are an epic 
song from western Bulgaria and a 
wistful melody performed by 
herdsmen of central Slovakia. The 
instruments played include the 
cymbalum, associated with gypsy 
music, and the domra. At a time 
when things are moving in Eastern 
Europe, this welcome recording 
serves to remind us how rich and 
varied is its musical heritage.

CD VeraBra No. 28 
The new German label VeraBra 
seems to go in for eclectic musical 
forms, as reflected in the title of 
this CD. The title song, described 
as a ‘rumba’, is a successful 
marriage of flamenco and salsa. 
“Mi patio” is a tango, but 
modernized and adapted to the 
tastes of young people in Argentina 
today. “A Gill Evans'’ (presumably 
a misspelling of Gil Evans, who 
worked with Miles Davis), has a 
jazzy flavour, while most of the 
other compositions are cioser to 
traditional bulerias, alegrias and 
sevillanas. The guitar playing is 
quite dazzling.

CD Contemporary/Carrére 
9031-73600-2 
Harrell is a young trumpeter who 
is increasingly in demand, both for 
the quality of his playing and for 
his compositions, The title of this 
CD is “Forms”, which is very 
appropriate to this dense, lyrical 
and highly structured music, which 
is also of a consistently high 
quality. Harrell is the teader on this 
session, but Daniic Pérez arouses 
the most admiration. Pérez, a 
23-year-old from Panama whose 
first recording this is, is Dizzy 
Gillespie's current pianist and has to 
be heard to be believed. An 
exponent of a polytonal, polymedal, 
“modern” style of jazz, he is an 
attentive accompanist and virtuoso 
soloist who has well and truly 
assimilated the lessons of the 
pianists who came before him. But 
his rhythmic inventions are most 
fully brought into play in Latin jazz 
and | hope that it won't be too 
long before he is given an 
opportunity to record in this vein, 
which is perfectly suited to his 
temperament.

The best thing about Spike Lee's 
latest film “Mo Better Blues’ was 
its soundtrack. Marsalis, Blanchard 
and their rhythm section—all 
seasoned musicians despite 
their youth—are producing 
some of the best jazz around, 
tightly scored and, on some 
tracks, full of bounce, in the 
good old Dixieland tradition. 
A special word of praise for 
Cynda Williams, who also acts in 
the film and who gives a vibrant 
rendering of the old W.C. Handy 
number ‘‘Harlem Blues’ in a 
sparkling new arrangement for 
strings by pianist Claire Fisher.

Conductor Olivier Holt, 
CD Cybelia CY 879 
The Cybelia record company is 
trying to make French music better 
known, and particularly the music 
of living composers. Dominique 
Probst was born in 1954 in a family 
of musicians. A percussionist, he 
has composed a great deal for the 
theatre and it was therefore natural 
that, after many changes of 
direction, he should try his hand at 
opera when seeking to forge his 
own style. The libretto by the writer 
Eugéne lonesco is based on the 
martyrdom of Father Kolbe, who in 
1941 gave his life to save a 
prisoner at Auschwitz. After 
Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, 
Penderecki and a few other lesser 
composers, Probst in his turn 
denounces the horrors of Nazism. 
First performed in Italy in 1988, this 
ambitious work was originally 
commissioned by the Paris Opera 
House. Although in live 
performance the work is not always 
entirely convincing, on record it 
comes over with an impressive 
simplicity and authenticity.

The famous label EMI/HMV is 
reissuing its treasures of 
nineteenth- and twentieth-century 
French music. As we know all too 
well, everybody loves French music 
except the French. This people, 
particularly sensitive when its sense 
of national pride is at stake, seems 
however to be changing its attitude, 
Gounod is not just the composer of 
“Faust”; he wrote two symphonies 
under the influence of the classical 
composers, particularly 
Mendelssohn. A far cry from 
Berlioz, Gounod was true to a 
tradition and contributed to it. As 
for Vincent d'Indy, he seemed to 
have sunk without a trace. However, 
the work of this nationalist 
composer marked by Wagner 
reveals a refined lyricism. His 
second symphony is to be 
savoured, especially for its mystery. 
Also to be rediscovered are the 
symphonic fragments from Henri 
Dutilleux’s ballet “Le Loup”, which 
enjoyed great success when first 
performed by Roland Petit in 1953. 
This appealing work sheds valuable 
light on the development of one of 
the great twentieth-century masters. 
Other CDs in this collection are 
devoted to Castillon and Rabaud,

In 1954 a group of musicians 
including Adolf Busch, Marcel

the Marlboro Festival in Vermont 
(US.A). The aim was to provide a 
place where musicians, whether 
recognized masters or promising 
young talents, world famous or 
unknown, could come together and 
play purely for the pleasure of it, 
without there being any kind of 
pecking order. The celebrated 
cellist Pablo Casals honoured the 
Festival with his presence from 
1960 to 1973. He is featured as 
conductor on the first of 
these CDs where he reveals a 
iuminous poetry which also 
pervades the other recordings. 
Each one is a gem that does full 
justice to the composer 
represented and brilliantly illustrates 
one of the most marvellous musical 
events of our time.
