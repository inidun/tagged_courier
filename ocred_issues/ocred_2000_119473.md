It was a feast day. The end of 
B Ramadan.The people of Djenné 
gathered on the great square 
in front of the mosque for nine o’clock 
prayers on this holy day. 
The ritual drew to a close. The men 
were sitting on the ground listening 
to the Imam’s sermon, spoken 
by the greatest griot (storyteller)! 
a slim, alert man with a silver tongue. 
His metallic voice roamed through 
the audience, seeming to probe their 
reactions. 
With his hands and his gaze, he took 
the pulse of the crowd. 
At the end of the sermon, his eagle 
eye caught sight of the upraised staff of 
the patriarch, who sharply struck the 
ground with it three times. Everyone 
listened to the sound in complete 
silence. Then the storyteller prepared to 
pass on the old chief’s words. 
The storyteller listened to the words, 
the sentences and the sounds, gathering 
them for a moment in his ears, his heart 
and his head.Then his tongue caressed 
them, cleansed them, drew them out, 
spun them, rinsed them and delivered 
them to the gathering, purged of all 
anguish and poison. For the spoken 
word can be a pain that kills and a 
dagger that scars for life. 
He said: 
That the north wind rises with every 
dawn 
And murmurs each day 
And drains everything of water 
That the waters of the two rivers 
Flow eastward each day 
He said: 
That the walls have stopped weeping 
That it’s time to heal 
The wounds left by winter 
They understood: 
They turned towards the West >

he site of Djenné has been inhabited since 250 
B.C. It has always been a commercial cross- 
roads between the desert and the savannah, on 
the trans-Saharan caravan routes which vehi- 
cled the gold trade. From the 15th century on, 
Djenné also became a centre for the spread of 
Islam. Almost 2,000 traditional adobe houses 
with Arab decoration have survived. They are 
built on hillocks to escape flooding by the Bani 
and Niger rivers during the rainy season. Djenné 
was placed an Unesco’s World Heritage List in 
1988. [|

### 119475: Cultural cloning or hybrid cultures?

n 
ULTURAL CLONING 
OR HYBRID CULTURES? 
 
OPINION 
  
D Eduardo Portella 
To raise the issue of culture today is to position oneself at the crossroads of two 
forces, globalization and the persistence of national identity, that are both contra- 
  
dictory and intertwined. Culture can no longer be developed without a basic, 
existential, vital tension between the universal, the regional, the national and the local. 
Although cultures remain anchored in their national contexts, it is increasingly hard 
to believe that the traditional concepts of identity, people and nation are inviolable. Our 
societies have never experienced such a widespread break with traditions that have 
grown up over centuries. 
But we must ask ourselves whether modern trends usually presented as possible 
threats to these traditions, including that of the nation-state, might not turn out to be 
  
fertile soil for culture, i.e. favourable to the coexistence of diversity. They might help to 
avoid the two pitfalls of ordered cohesion and artificial uniformity. 
The first arises from the hegemonic identity model being based on a single, total, 
dominant, integrating culture. It was seen as something fixed and immutable. It was 
brandished as a weapon, and we are only now beginning to measure its impact. The 
twentieth century saw the most sophisticated cultures give in to barbarism. It took us a 
long time to realize that racism flourishes where cultural identity is regarded as an abso- 
lute. Cultures based on exclusion inevitably lead to the exclusion of all culture. T hat is 
why the concept of cultural identity as we have known it since the beginning of globa- 
lization is out of date. 
But culture must not free itself from national identity by surrendering to the might 
of globalization and privatization.Emerging post-national identities have not yet shown 
their capacity to withstand inequality, injustice, exclusion and violence. To subordinate 
culture to criteria developed in the laboratories of the dominant ideology, which make 
a cult of the ups and downs of the stock market, the uncertainties of supply and 
demand, the snares of functionality and urgency, is to cut off its vital supply of social 
oxygen and to replace creative tension with the stress of the marketplace. 
Two big dangers loom ahead.The first is the current tendency to relegate culture to 
the status of a superfluous product, whereas cultural perception could well become for 
  information societies what scientific knowledge has been for industrial societies. It is

On the rise: construction of a dam as part of the giant Three Gorges project on China's Yangtze River. 


### 119476: Large dams: the end of an era?

LARGE DAMS—HE END 
OF AN ERA? 
  
D Peter Coles 
Growing debate about the rights and wrongs of large-scale dam construction focuses 
on the very meaning of development 
At the last count,there were around 
a 40,000 large dams on the world’s 
rivers, according to the International 
Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD).! 
Most of them were built in the last 35 years. 
A further 1,600 are under construction in 
over 40 countries. But is the era of building 
very large dams coming to an end? Pres- 
sure groups of displaced rural communities 
1. ICOLD, founded in 1928, seeks to advance the 
art and science of dams. It has some 6,000 
individual members and National Committees in 
80 countries. ICOLD defines a large dam as one 
that is over 15 metres high. 
D British journalist specializing in scientific and 
environmental issues 
1 0 The Unesco Courier - April 2000 
and ecology organizations have already dis- 
rupted dam building in the United States 
and India. 
This coming August the independent 
World Commission on Dams (WCD), set 
up in 1998 by the World Bank and IUCN 
(the World Conservation Union) to look at 
the long term developmental effectiveness 
of dams, will publish its conclusions after 
two years of fact-finding. Preliminary 
reports to the Commission, whose 12 com- 
missioners span most groups of stakehol- 
ders, are already suggesting that the deve- 
lopment benefits may not be all they 
promised. And that the people who gain 
least from dams are those already at the 
bottom of the socio-economic pile. 
“Dams are both a technology option 
and a development choice,” said South 
African Minister of Education and WCD 
Chair Professor Kader Asmal last Decem- 
ber. By focusing on dams as a reflection of 
societal needs, he said, WCD is inevitably 
confronting the very meaning of “develop- 
ment”. “We are tackling the question of 
how knowledge, interests, and values deter- 
mine the context within which dams are 
either chosen or rejected as the preferred 
option, and how such decisions can best be 
negotiated between competing interests.” 
Part of WCD’s remit is to find out what 
these interests are. They might, for

example, include the needs of industry and 
urban residents versus agriculture and rural 
populations, or, more cynically, the dam 
industry versus those interested in inter- 
mediate technology or traditional solutions 
to development challenges. 
For ICOLD, the links between dam 
building and development are obvious.Two 
prerequisites for the development of a 
nation are energy and water, says one 
ICOLD paper. But since these resources 
are most scarce precisely where demand is 
rising most rapidly, dams have become 
almost synonymous with development.So, 
while dam building in developed countries 
has slowed to a trickle in the last decade, 
major constructions are underway in indus- 
trializing countries, like China’s massive 
Three Gorges project and India’s Narmada 
Valley Development project (see article 
below). Over half of all large dams (more 
than 22,000) are in China, while India has 
become the third largest dam constructor 
in the world, with over 3,000 large dams. 
Smoothing 
the flood-and-drought cycle 
Although dams produce power without 
contributing to the greenhouse effect— 
about 20 per cent of world electricity and 
seven per cent of all energy, according to 
[COLD —their primary purpose is water 
control. Reservoirs can provide drinking 
water, while smoothing out the “boom and 
bust” cycles of flooding and drought 
brought about by monsoons. They do this 
by storing excess water in reservoirs during 
the rainy season and releasing it in times of 
scarcity. But by far the greatest use of dams 
is to supply irrigation water for agriculture. 
In developing countries, according to the 
United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), irrigation accounts for over 75 
per cent of water consumption. In some 
countries,the figure is o ver 90 per cent. 
At present, according to [COLD, one 
third of all food produced already comes 
from irrigated land. And the organization 
sees irrigation as the only way to meet the 
future increase in demand, expecting 80 
per cent of food production to come from 
irrigated land by 2025. 
But the case for irrigation is far from 
clear-cut. According to the International 
Rivers Network (IRN),a non-governmen- 
tal organization, irrigation canals cause 
eutrophication2. Meanwhile, the crops pro- 
duced are often for export and do not feed 
the sectors of the population that are 
expanding most rapidly—the poor. And 
2. Eutrophication is a phenomenon occurring in 
stagnant water, whereby vegetation proliferates 
and the water’s oxygen content is reduced. 
ironically, these are the very people who 
lose their homes, farms and livelihoods 
when river valleys are flooded by dams. 
Even before a dam has produced a single 
watt of power, or litre of irrigation water, 
tens of thousands of people may need to be 
evacuated from the river valleys to make way 
for the reservoir. World-wide, the flooded 
valleys that accompany large dams have for- 
ced at least 30 million people to abandon 
their homes since the 1930s, according to 
IRN. In the past, governments have seen the 
human cost of displacement as an inevitable 
“side effect” of development.N ow these dis- 
placed people are fighting to be heard. 
“Past experiences,” says one report to the 
Commission, “show that typical resettlement 
programmes are: often prepared late in the 
project cycle; under financed; devised using 
insufficient understanding of people’s social, 
cultural,economic, psychological conditions 
and environment in which they were loca- 
ted; implemented with a very short time 
frame, with limited objective of restoring pre- 
vious income levels, and too often terminated 
even before all displaced people were resett- 
led and rehabilitated.” One question that 
WCD will be trying to answer in its final 
report is whether the loss of an ancient rural 
lifestyle is the inevitable price a nation has to 
pay to achieve security for the majority. 
Some of those opposed to large-scale 
dam construction, like IRN, see the deve- 
PLANET 
lopment that dams supposedly promote as 
spurious in any case, even for the largely 
urban communities who benefit. In its 
publicity for Silent Rivers, a book by Patrick 
McCully that IRN co-published, the NGO 
says that “massive dams are much more 
than simply machines to generate electricity 
and store water. They are concrete, rock 
and earth expressions of the dominant 
ideology of the technological age: icons of 
economic development and scientific pro- 
gress to match nuclear bombs and motor 
cars.” 
Other critics suggest that the dam 
industry simply turned to developing coun- 
tries because the market in developed 
countries had almost dried up. In the past, 
loans from the World Bank and internatio- 
nal aid programmes indirectly kept the 
multi-billion dollar industry afloat, while 
scoring lucrative trade and technology 
transfer deals for the lending nations. But 
now, under mounting opposition from 
pressure groups,the U.S.and many Euro- 
pean governments have declined to become 
involved in projects like the Three Gorges 
and Narmada dams. 
With power still mainly in the hands of 
the dam builders,the coming WCD report 
might at least provide guidelines on how to 
include the dispossessed among those who 
benefit, while minimizing the extent of irre- 
versible damage. [|

A BARRAGE 
OF PROTEST 
 
D Peter Coles and Lyla Bavadam 
The tide may be turning against 
the giant Narmada dam project in India 
from the historic city of Baroda in 
India’s Gujarat state.D uring the sum- 
mer months the baked earth cracks in the 
heat. When the monsoon comes, villagers 
perch on the furniture like chickens to avoid

PLANET 
In August 1999, protesters campaigning against the building of a dam on the Narmada River in India were 
ready to drown themselves in the rapidly rising monsoon waters. 
NBA, offered no resettlement land and only 
minimal cash compensation.Many of these 
villagers, says the report, now have menial 
jobs in the slums of Jabalpur, the main city in 
the region. 
The plight of the Vadaj oustees could 
be shared by over 300,000 others as 
construction moves slowly ahead on the 30 
large dams, 150 medium and 3,000 smaller 
dams in a vast project that will transform 
the Narmada into a staircase of reser voirs 
and turbines. For the past 15 years, the 
backlash of opposition from NBA, a 
coalition of local people’s movements 
opposed to the different dams, has been 
challenging the view of development that 
these dams promote. NBA argues that the 
beneficiaries of the project will be city dwel- 
lers, not the rural communities forced to 
leave their homes in the flooded valley. 
Over 80 per cent of India’s rural house- 
holds have no electricity—and little hope of 
ever being connected to the electricity grid— 
according to Arundhati Roy, the acclaimed 
Indian author who hasrecently championed 
NBA's struggle. She says the increased food 
that the dams’ irrigation canals may produce 
will be destined for export, doing little to feed 
THE REALITIES OF RESETTLEMENT 
n some cases resettlement has meant the frag- 
mentation of village communities, because 
neighbours are given land in different sites. 
Meanwhile, over 5,000 oustees from villages in 
Gujarat are being rehoused in settlements along- 
side others from Maharashtra and Madhya Pra- 
desh. People from three different states, each with 
their own languages and dialects, culinary habits 
and dress, are thrown together. 
Resettled people may also have to face hostility 
from their host communities. New lands can be 
barren rocky ground or waterlogged, saline 
stretches where farming is impossible. Fishing com- 
munities find themselves far from the river on 
which their livelihood has depended for centuries. 
Often, these resettled people try to return to their 
original homes, even if all that remainsisa muddy 
hilltop. 
Uncertainty is another dimension of resettle- 
ment. Entire generations grow up not knowing 
what the ultimate fate of their village will be. As 
NBA activist Shripad Dharmadhikari explains,   
“when it is announced that an area will face sub- 
mergence, all development work comes to a halt. 
So if a school is being built or roads are being 
constructed it is all stopped. The actual submer- 
gence may remain on paper but the work stops.” In 
the village of Kakarana Behena, a Bhillala tribes- 
man said the electric supply to his village was cut 
when its status as a submergence village became 
known. Power supply was stopped a year ago but 
the waters are still below Kakarana. 
There are also social ramifications. Sulgaon is a 
village in the prosperous and fertile Nimad region 
that will be submerged when the Maheshwar dam 
in Madhya Pradesh is constructed. Lakshman Pati- 
dar says it is becoming increasingly difficult to find 
bridesfor eligible boys. “Who will want to send their 
daughtersto a home that will soon be under water?’ 
he asks. And, like other Nimadi farmers, Patidar 
values his land above all else. Since boysinvariably 
join their fathers on the farm they get little formal 
education. Thiswill make it even harder to adapt to 
their loss of livelihood and culture. |

the nation’s poor. In 1995, she says, some 30 
million tons of unsold grain were stockpiled 
in state granaries, while 350 million Indians 
still live below the poverty line. What is more, 
most of the people affected by the Narmada 
project, says NBA, are tribal communities, 
fishing villages and Dalits (the so-called 
“oppressed lower stratum of the Hindu caste 
system), who already benefit least from 
India’s prosperity. 
The notion of dam building as a prime 
technology solution to development is not 
new. Back in the 1940s, just after Indepen- 
dence,Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru saw 
dams as “the Temples of Modern India”. The 
Narmada Valley Development Project was 
to be a showcase for this vision. Although this 
particular project stayed on the drawing 
board for over 30 years, mostly because of 
disputes over water rights between the three 
states—Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and 
Gujarat—through which the Narmada flows, 
India went on to build some 3,600 dams. 
Coupled to the Green Revolution of the 
1960s, these dams provided massive irri- 
gation systems that have underpinned a

fourfold increase in food production.And 
similar prospects are being heralded for the 
Narmada dams. According to official 
figures, the Sardar Sarovar dam, the last 
and largest of the dams before the river 
reaches the Arabian Sea, will provide water 
for 20-30 million people all year round, 
especially in the arid areas of Kutch, Sau- 
rashtra and the state of Rajasthan. At the 
same time, the 138.6-metre multi-purpose 
dam is scheduled to produce 1,450 MW of 
hydroelectric power, while its reservoir 
should smooth out the yearly seesaw of 
floods and droughts, protecting some 
400,000 people. 
World Bank withdrawal 
NBA contests just about all the official 
statistics on the future benefits of the pro- 
ject. It also questions the very principle of 
the dams from the point of view of deve- 
lopment.Led by Medha Patkar,a sociolo- 
gist originally from Bombay, NBA argues 
that the benefits will never justify the irre- 
versible loss of forest, fisheries, farmland, 
culture and livelihood for the hundreds of

thousands of displaced people. Some 30 
million people depend directly or indirectly 
on the 1,312-km-long river and its valley, 
with its fertile farmland, historic temples 
and pilgrimage routes. 
In 1986, a year after the World Bank lent 
$450 million to construct Sardar Sarovar, 
NBA commissioned a series of impact 
assessment studies that, it claims, exposed 
crucial flaws in the official cost-benefit ana- 
lyses for the entire project. But at the heart of 
NBA’s campaign is the apparent lack of 
resettlement provision for oustees. With 
mounting international support, NBA was 
able to force a review of the Narmada pro- 
ject. In 1991 the World Bank commissioned 
an independent inquiry, whose report essen- 
tially endorsed the NBA claims, saying that 
there had been “no proper appraisal” of the 
project’s impact. Two years later, in an 
unprecedented about-turn, the World Bank 
withdrew from the scheme. 
In 1994, India’s Supreme Court upheld 
a case presented by NBA, freezing all 
construction on the Narmada dams until 
the state governments carried out adequate 
impact assessments. NBA insists that there 
must be no displacement if there are no 
realistic plans for resettlement. With the 
exception of Sardar Sarovar, none of the 
dam projects had any resettlement plans, 
says the organization. NBA is adamant that 
it is not opposed to the development that 
the dams promise. It is also looking for a 
compromise solution, calling for the final 
height of the dams to be reduced. The lower 
the final height, the fewer people will be 
forced to move to make way for the reser- 
voirs and the less land will be lost. 
Rally in the valley 
Although it now seems unlikely that 
NBA's actions will stop the dams, the orga- 
nization has brought the issue of resettle- 
ment to the fore.In 1998 the Madhya Pra- 
desh government set up a task force to look 
at resettlement possibilities. It found that 
not only was there no land in Madhya Pra- 
desh to house oustees but that the land pro- 
mised by Gujarat either did not exist, or 
was of too poor quality. Madhya Pradesh 
has now called for a new evaluation.The 
state of Gujarat, however, has dug in its 
heels. Not only did it refuse to allow the 
independent World Commission on Dams, 
set up by the World Bank (see page 10), to 
visit the Sardar Sarovar site, it also challen- 
ged the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling.In 
February 1999, after a four-year morato- 
rium, the Supreme Court reversed its ear - 
lier decision, allowing construction to begin 
again at Sardar Sarovar,adding a further 5 
metres to the 80 metres already built. 
NBA has now reinforced its struggle, 
PLANET 
organizing a series of passive sit-ins and 
hunger strikes. At the end of July last year 
Arundhati Roy organized a “Rally in the 
Valley”, marching with 400 other public 
figures and supporters from village to vil- 
lage in the affected area. An estimated 
10,000 oustees joined the rally in the fertile 
Nimad region of Madhya Pradesh, where 
the local farmers will lose their land if 
construction goes ahead. And when the 
monsoon rains began in August 1999, 
Medha Patkar and other NBA members 
took up positions in the village of Dom- 
khedi,refusing to move as the flood waters 
rose up to their shoulders. Police in boats 
finally removed them. At the end of last 
year, Arundhati Roy published a closely- 
documented essay entitled “The Greater 
Common Good” in Outlook magazine,cri- 
ticizing the Narmada Valley project both in 
principle and in its application. 
As the mud flies between NBA and 
supporters of the project, the withdrawal 
of the World Bank could have unpredic- 
table effects in the longer term. With most 
international aid programmes now 
unwilling to be associated with the dams, 
the developers are looking for private sector 
funding. This could be much harder to 
influence than an institution such as the 
World Bank, which has a “worthy” image to 
protect. |

### 119478: USA: commercials in the classroom

USA: COMMERCIALS 
IN THE CLASSROOM 
  
PD Mark Walsh 
Channel One has survived a decade of criticism over a daily TV show for schools in the U.S, 
where advertisers are ready to pay premium rates to reach youthful audiences 
began in U.S.classrooms. After a 1989 
test run, Channel One debuted in the 
spring of 1990 in 400 secondary schools 
across the country. It was the brainchild of 
Christopher Whittle,a brash media entre - 
preneur from Tennessee who had built an 
empire by dreaming up new ways to expose 
Americans to advertising and marketing. 
“Were this a perfect world, we would 
agree that government, not commercials, 
should provide this technology and pro- 
gramming,” Mr. Whittle said at the time. He 
frequently quipped that students believed 
“Chernobyl is Cher’s full name” —proof 
that they were in dire need of relevant cur- 
rent-events programming. 
Channel One wasn’t the first case of 
advertising in the schools. American students 
were accustomed to seeing athletic score- 
boards sponsored by Coca-Cola or Pepsi, 
advertisements in yearbooks, and newspaper- 
in-education programmes. But the daily class- 
room news show for teenagers was something 
different, and it caused quite a stir. The basic 
offer was this: Channel One provided schools 
with a satellite dish, a videotape recorder, 
wiring, and a television monitor in each class- 
room to show the 12-minute daily pro- 
gramme, which includes two minutes of 
advertising. Schools signed a contract gua- 
ranteeing that they would show Channel One 
to most students virtually every school day. 
12,000 schools 
The schools could use the in-school 
video network for other purposes, such as 
producing their own local student news 
shows, or to run educational documentaries. 
Critics called it a bargain with the devil. 
Schools were ceding control of a small part 
of their class time, and providing advertisers 
with access to students’ attention in unpre- 
cedented fashion, they said. 
Many educators did fight the concept. 
Virtually every major education group in the 
A Ten years ago, a commercial revolution

United States passed resolutions opposing 
Channel One. Some states, such as New 
York, banned it outright in public schools 
while others threatened to withhold school 
funding for the two minutes per day schools 
gave over to advertisers. 
But at the time, the United States wasin 
the throes of an education reform movement 
that favoured decentralized control and 
school-based decision-making. And many 
local school boards and school principals 
decided they would accept the video equip- 
ment. Some found the news show informa- 
tive at a time when few teenagers picked up 
a newspaper or tuned into network television 
news. And the commercials were rarely dif- 
ferent from the ones students saw thousands 
of times watching television at home. 
Before long, Whittle Communications 
had wired some 12,000 schools,and eight 
million students in U.S. middle and high 
schools were watching Channel One daily. 
Although Channel One became profitable, 
the classroom news show couldn’t save Mr. 
Whittle’s crumbling media empire. He sold 
Channel One in 1994 to K-IIT Communi- 
cations Corp.,now known as Primedia Inc. 
Meanwhile, with the ground broken by 
Channel One, American companies and 
advertisers have come up with many new 
forms of commercial messages in and 
around schools: 
D Major soda bottlers such as Pepsi and 
Coca-Cola vie for exclusive beverage 
contracts with school districts,so they can 
place logo-laden soda machines on cam- 
puses and share revenue with the schools. 
D Time and Newsweek magazines and 
The NewYork Times publish special news- 
magazines for elementary and secondary 
school classrooms, most of which carry 
advertising. 
D A mathematics workbook published 
by McGraw-Hill, a major textbook publisher, 
caused a stir last year because of its use of 
product trade names and logos in word pro- 
blems. The publisher said it was trying to 
make the texts more relevant to students. 
D In a venture modeled somewhat after 
Channel One, a California company called 
ZapMe! Corp. provides schools with a pac- 
kage of free computers and an Internet 
connection as long as they agree to have stu- 
dents use them at least four hours a day. 
ZapMe! carries advertising targeted at stu- 
dents.

Channel One’s news content comes in 
for heavy scrutiny. The tone of its daily 
show has see-sawed over the years between 
an emphasis on hard news and serious 
topics and what some educators derided 
as a too light, pop culture orientation. In 
recent years,however, the show has empha- 
sized social issues of interest to teenagers 
and world reports. “I think that if you went 
back to the early 1990s what you would 
have seen is more of a headline approach,” 
said Paul Folkemer, Channel One’s exe- 
cutive vice president for education. “Our 
present strategy has a more in-depth look, 
with more of a teaching side to it.” 
The January 4, 2000, programme was 
fairly typical. Fresh into the new millen- 
nium, Channel One offered an extended 
report on the surprise resignation of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. It interviewed 
national security experts and dug up video 
of a 1997 visit to Russia by its own corres- 
pondent, including shots of Russian citizens 
selling their belongings in the streets. Other 
elements of the day’s show included a pop 
quiz, a regular feature designed to engage 
students in the classroom, a report about the 
conclusion of an airliner hijacking in India, 
and two commercial breaks. Among the 
advertisements on this day were one for 
Juicy Fruit gum and two “public service 
announcements”: an anti-drug message 
and one warning young people about poten- 
tial dangers on the Internet. 
“I have a role every day in the discussion 
of what we are going to air. I’ve tried to link 
all of our materials to national education 
standards,” explains Dr. Folkemer, a former 
school principal. Dr. Folkemer considers 
himself Channel One’s equivalent of a 
school district’s assistant superintendent 
for curriculum, who typically oversees what 
is taught and which books and tests are 
  
WORLD OF LEARNING 
used. The United States has no federally 
mandated curriculum standards, but groups 
for virtually all school subjects have deve- 
loped voluntary standards. Dr. Folkemer has 
emphasized several initiatives that show up 
on Channel One. Teaching the News, for 
example, helps educators identify which 
subjects the Channel One news report will 
relate to on a given day. 
Another initiative is The Power of One, 
which includes a series of stories that stress 
the difference that one individual can make. 
Last November, for example, Channel One 
featured a Virginia high school student who 
started a project to raise money to provide 
goats for families in strife-torn Rwanda. A 
Channel One reporter, Tracy Smith, tra- 
veled to Rwanda last year to report on the 
receiving end of the charitable project. Her 
report also explained the background to the 
conflict among Rwandan ethnic groups. 
Such foreign reporting forays are a staple of »

### 119478: USA: commercials in the classroom

WORLD OF LEARNING 
Channel One, and some observers give the 
network credit for its emphasis on world 
news. In 1998, Brill’s Content, a national 
magazine of media criticism, lauded Channel 
One for providing a more substantive report 
on the Indonesian political crises than NBC 
Nightly News, one of the major national 
news programmes, did on the same day. 
But William H oynes, a professor of socio- 
logy at Vassar College, criticizes the news 
content. An analysis of 36 programmes found 
that only about 20 per cent of airtime was 
devoted to coverage of news stories, with the 
rest of the time filled with a news quiz, wea- 
ther, sports and Hollywood gossip. His 
research, conducted with a media expert, 
concluded that the channel’s “real function 
is not journalistic but commercial.” Hoynes 
also criticizes the channels reporting style. 
“The anchors are cast as adventurers who tra- 
vel the world for a good story,” he said. “It 
focuses the news and the drama on the indi- 
vidual personalities instead of the issues and 
events... Channel One news serves as a pro- 
motional vehicle for itself and for youth cul- 
ture and style,” Hoynes added. This approach, 
not incidentally, promotes a friendly envi- 
ronment for advertising, he believes. 
Reaching 
the teen market 
Without a doubt, the presence of advertising 
remains the most controversial aspect of 
Channel One.The advertising debate had 
appeared to quieten down until early 1999, 
when several prominent American conser- 
vatives joined with longtime liberal critics of 
commercialism in schools. This coalition 
successfully lobbied a U.S. Senate com- 
mittee to hold an oversight hearing on 
school commercialism that was focused 
almost entirely on Channel One. 
Although there was no serious prospect 
of federal legislation on the issue,the May 
1999 hearing was nevertheless a dramatic 
confrontation between Channel One’s pro- 
ponents and its legion of critics. Despite 
their decision to co-operate, liberals and 
conservatives have distinct concerns. The 
latter tend to focus on the contents of the 
programme, objecting to a variety of pop 
culture references such as a riff of music 
from the shock rocker Marilyn Manson or 
ads for R-rate movies, restricted because 
they contain sex or violence. Phyllis Schlafly, 
the president of the Eagle Forum, and a pro- 
minent conservative activist, called Channel 
One a “devious device to enable advertisers 
to circumvent parents.” 
The liberal attack on Channel One is 
from the perspective of consumers versus 
advertisers and big business, arguing that 
corporate advertisers should not be able to 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - April 2000 
buy access to children’s minds in school 
and that public schools should not abdicate 
control of class time to commercial interests. 
Ralph Nader, an American liberal icon, 
called Channel One “the most brazen mar- 
keting ploy in the history of the United 
States.” The programme conveys a mes- 
sage of materialism, Mr. Nader said, and it 
“corrupts the integrity of schools and 
degrades the moral authority of schools 
and teachers.” A year ago, Commercial 
Alert, a consumer organization affiliated 
with Mr. Nader, wrote to all the major 
advertisers on Channel One, urging them to 
end their sponsorship of the show. 
The letters cited four main concerns: 
“Our decision to advertise 
on Channel One was made 
only after a thorough review 
of the programming and 
its benefits to schools 
and school children” 
Channel One forces children to watch the 
ads; it wastes valuable class time (in 1998, 
two researchers asserted that the two minutes 
of time devoted to commercials in Channel 
One’s 12,000 schools was costing those 
schools some $300 million in lost time); it 
wastes taxpayers’dollars for education;and 
its content is under the control of its produ- 
cers and not of parents or elected school 
boards. Most advertisers did not even 
respond to the letter, much less agree to 
drop their advertising. One company that did 
respond was Nabisco, which has advertised 
Bubble Yum gum on the show. “Our decision 
to advertise on Channel One was made only 
after a thorough review of the programming 
and its benefits to schools and school chil- 
dren,” the company wrote to Commercial 
Alert.“We do not believe evidence supports 
the charge that two minutes of daily adver- 
tising is putting our children’s future at risk.” 
Advertisers such as Nabisco, Pepsi, 
Proctor & Gamble (with ads for Clearasil 
skin cream and Pringles potato chips), 
movie studios and the U.S.Armed Forces 
(for recruitment) pay premium rates (up to 
$200,000 for a 30-second spot) to reach 
Channel One’s audience of eight million 
students. As the channel's advertisement 
to media buyers puts it, the show “is viewed 
by more teens than any other programme 
on television.” Another industry advertise- 
ment refers to the channel as “the smartest 
place to reach tweens.” Tweens is a Madison 
Avenue term for children 9-14 years old, a 
coveted demographic group. “Many chil- 
dren and especially teens are difficult for 
advertisers to reach,” said Gary Ruskin, 
the director of Commercial Alert. “So the 
product hawkers are going where the kids 
are—where they are forced to be, in school.” 
New outlets 
Channel One executives paint the advertising 
critics as a loud but small group that is pushing 
tired old arguments. “I don’t know of anyone 
who is an advocate of simply commercia- 
lism,” said Andy Hill, Channel One’s president 
of programming. “The debate has been about 
two minutes of advertising and not about 10 
minutes of good programming. Our critics 
tend not to be people in schools.” Roy Lewis, 
a teacher in California, asserted that “what 
Channel One does so beautifully is provide 
background.” But critics point out that there 
are other ways of bringing news into the 
school: CNN has developed an ad-free news- 
cast for the classroom, but the cable station 
does not offer schools the equipment to go 
along with it. 
Now Channel One’s journalism is 
moving beyond the classroom. It recently 
began submitting twice-monthly reports to 
a morning television news show on CBS 
television. It has similar projects in the works 
for the MTV cable channel and a new 
women’s cable network called Oxygen. 
Channel One is developing a media literacy 
curriculum for schools, and its website, which 
has long supplemented the TV show with 
additional information,quizzes, and the like, 
is getting an infusion of spending. 
Primedia, which publishes such maga- 
zines as Seventeen, Soap Opera Digest, and 
Automobile, does not disclose revenues for 
Channel One. But Simba Information Inc., 
which tracks spending on educational media, 
estimates that Channel One and a sister unit 
that sells documentaries to schools had reve- 
nues of $118.5 million in 1999. 
Primedia recently sold off some of its 
educational properties, including the vene- 
rable American classroom magazine, My 
Weekly Reader. T here has been speculation 
that the company wanted to divest itself of 
Channel One as well, but the company has 
a new chief executive officer, Tom Rogers, 
who came from the NBC television net- 
work. Mr. Rogers seems to be intent on 
keeping Channel One and fitting it into a 
media future in which television, the 
Internet, and education are expected to 
merge in new forms. |

disappear in the foreseeable future. Linguistic diversity 
isimperilled, and with it a part of the human heritage, 
for language is the cornerstone of cultural diversity, 
which is in its turn a mainstay in the preservation of 
biodiversity (pages 18-19). 
There are many reasons for language warsin which 
English at the world level (pages 23-24) and other 
“major” regional languages gain ground at the 
expense of “minority” languages. But the big batta- 
lions do not always win,as the struggles to preserve 
Basque, Berber and Gikuyu illustrate (pages 24-28). 
At the same time, coexistence between languages 
can and is being fostered (page 29). Through interna- 
tional co-operation to promote multilingualism, espe- 
cially in education (pages 30-31); through specific natio- 
nal policies, as in India (pages 33-34); and through 
grassrootsinitiatives like that of the Ecuadorian Shuar, 
who have used the rebirth of their language asa spring- 
board into the modern world (pages 32-33). 
Also in Ecuador, the story of the Zaparo (pages 19 
and 22) shows the other side of the coin. The Zaparo 
did not mobilize until late in the day, and their lan- 
guage now seems doomed to disappear and with it 
their very existence as an ethnic group. As the last 
article in this Focus section reveals (pages 35-36),the 
fate of a language depends ultimately on the commit- 
ment of its users. Meanwhile, the disappearance of 
minority languages may be accompanied by the emer- 
gence of new hybrid tongues or variants spawned by 
the diversification of dominant languages. [|

6,000 languages: 
an embattled

to die out in the near future? Specialists 
reckon that no language can survive 
unless 100,000 people speak it. Half of the 
6,000 or so languages in the world today are 
spoken by fewer than 10,000 people and a quar- 
ter by less than 1,000. Only a score are spoken 
by hundreds of millions of people. 
The death of languages is not a new pheno- 
menon. Since languages diversified, at least 
30,000 (some say as many as half a million) of 
them have been born and disappeared, often 
without leaving any trace.Languages usually have 
a relatively short life span as well as a very high 
death rate. Only a few, including Basque, 
Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, 
Persian, Sanskrit and Tamil, have lasted more 
than 2,000 years. 
A re the vast majority of languages doomed 
Minority languages 
sidelined 
What is new, however, is the speed at which 
they are dying out. Europe’s colonial conquests 
caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eli- 
minating at least 15 per cent of all languages spo- 
ken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe 
has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of 
the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. In 
Brazil, about 540 (three-quarters of the total) 
have died out since Portuguese colonization 
began in 1530. 
The rise of nation-states, whose territorial 
unity was closely linked to their linguistic homo- 
geneity, has also been decisive in selecting and 
consolidating national languages and sidelining 
others. By making great efforts to establish an 
official language in education, the media and the 
civil service, national governments have delibera- 
tely tried to eliminate minority languages. 
This process of linguistic standardization has 
been boosted by industrialization and scientific 
progress, which have imposed new methods of 
communication that are swift, straightforward 
and practical. Language diversity came to be seen

as an obstacle to trade and the spread of know- 
ledge. Monolingualism became an ideal, and at 
the end of the 19th century the notion of a uni- 
versal language was born—a return to Latin was 
even considered—which gave rise to a spate of 
artificial languages, the first of which was 
Volapiik. The one that gained the widest accep- 
tance and has survived longest is Esperanto. 
More recently, the internationalization of 
financial markets, the dissemination of informa- 
tion by electronic media and other aspects of glo- 
balization have intensified the threat to “small” 
languages. A language not on the Internet is a lan- 
guage that “no longer exists” in the modern 
world. It is out of the game.It is not used in busi- 
ness. 
The rate of language extinction has now rea- 
ched the unprecedented worldwide level of 10 
every year. Some people predict that 50 to 90 per 
cent of today’s spoken languages will disappear 
during this century. Their preservation is an 
urgent matter. 
The effects of the death of languages are 
serious for several reasons. First of all, it is pos- 
sible that if we all ended up speaking the same 
language, our brains would lose some of their 
natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness. We 
would never be able to plumb the origins of

human language or resolve the mystery of “the 
first language”. As each language dies, a chapter 
of human history closes. 
Multilingualism is the most accurate reflec- 
tion of multiculturalism. The destruction of the 
first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second. 
Imposing a language without any links to a peo- 
ple’s culture and way of life stifles the expression 
of their collective genius. A language is not only 
the main instrument of human communication. 
It also expresses the world vision of those who 
speak it, their imagination and their ways of using 
knowledge. 
Dying whispers 
of traditional cultures 
To grasp how differently each tongue reflects 
the world, one only needs to list the words that 
crop up in every language with exactly the same 
meaning, words like I, you, us, who, what, no, all, 
one, two, big, long, small, woman, man, eat, see, 
hear, sun, moon, star, water, fire, hot,cold, white, 
black, night, land. There are about 300 at the 
most. 
The threat to multilingualism is similar to the 
threat to biodiversity. Not just because most lan- 
guages are like disappearing “species”, but becau- 
se there is an intrinsic and causal link between 
biological diversity and cultural diversity. Like 
Languages: conflict or coexistence? 
plant and animal species, endangered languages 
are confined to small areas. More than 80 per 
cent of countries that have great biological diver- 
sity are also places with the greatest number of 
endemic languages. This is because when people 
adapt to their environment, they create a special 
stock of knowledge about it which is mirrored in 
their language and often only there. Many of the 
world’s endangered plant and animal species 
today are known only to certain peoples whose 
languages are dying out. As they die, they take 
with them all the traditional knowledge about the 
environment. 
The 1992 Rio Earth Summit set up machine- 
ry to combat shrinking biodiversity. Now it is 
time for a Rio summit to tackle languages. The 
need to protect languages began to be apprecia- 
ted in the middle of the 20th century, when lan- 
guage rights were included in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (article 2). Since 
then, a number of instruments have been adop- 
ted, and projects have been launched (see pages 
30-31) to safeguard what is now considered a 
heritage of humanity. These laws and initiatives 
may not prevent languages from dying out, but at 
least they will slow down the process and encou- 
rage multilingualism. [|

Zaparo’s lost secrets

¢ y name is Manari, which in my lan- 
M guage, Zaparo, means a hefty lizard 
that lives in the forest. But if we want 
to register ourselves for official purposes, we're 
obliged to put down Spanish names. So I'm also 
called Bartolo Ushigua. The Zaparo used to be 
one of the Amazon’s greatest Indian peoples. 
Our shamans were very powerful because they 
knew the medicinal secrets of more than 500 
plants.” 1

brought all the misfortunes that have speeded up 
the decline of the Zaparo—settlers, disease, the 
rubber boom, slavery, wars, oil drilling and “the 
modern world”. 
“When the white rubber traders came to our 
forest,” says Manari, “they took away our people to 
work as slaves and to sell them off like chattels. 
T hey also brought with them diseases that our sha- 
mans didn’t know how to cure. So most of our 
people died.” 
“The Zaparo are officially extinct in this 
country,” announced an article published in 
Ecuador nearly 10 years ago. But today they are still 
fighting to survive, though the number of threats are 
more than they can count—in their language, num- 
bers only go up to three.

Winners and 
losers 
Half the world’s population uses a total of eight 
languages in daily life, while one sixth of the world’s 
languages are spoken in New Guinea alone 
buted. According to estimates made by the 
Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), which 
campaigns for preservation of the least-known 
tongues, only three per cent of the world’s 6,000 lan- 
guages are used in Europe, whereas half of them are 
spoken in the Asia-Pacific region, with the top prize 
going to New Guinea (the Indonesian territory of 
Irian Jaya plus Papua New Guinea), which is home 
to one sixth of the world’s languages. 
Linguistic diversity does not match population 
density: 96 per cent of languages are spoken by 
only four per cent of the world’s population and over 
80 per cent are endemic, i.e. confined to one 
country. Only about 20 languages are spoken by 
hundreds of millions of people in several countries. 
Although the figures vary according to the 
method of counting, the Millennium Family Ency- 
clopaedia (Dorling Kindersley, London,1997),esti- 
mates that around half the people in the world use 
in everyday life one of the planet’s eight most wides- 
pread languages: Chinese (1.2 billion speakers), 
English (478 million), Hindi (437 million), Spanish 
(392 million),Russian (284 million), Arabic (225 
million), Portuguese (184 million) and French (125 
million). SIL and Linguasphere Observatory (see 
page 31) provide comparable figures,by adding to 
those who speak a language as a mother tongue 
those for whom it is a “second language”. (see p. 21). 
T: linguistic heritage is very unevenly distri- 
Ten languages 
die out every year 
This imbalance leads specialists to forecast that 
95 per cent of all living languages will die out during 
the next century. At present, 10 languages disappear 
every year somewhere in the world. Some go so far 
as to claim a language dies out every two weeks. The 
rate of disappearance is especially high in areas 
where linguistic diversity is greatest. 
In Africa,more than 200 languages have fewer 
than 500 speakers each and may soon die out. T he 
minimum number of speakers to ensure survival is 
put at 100,000. 
In North America, the biggest threats are to 
indigenous and Creole languages. With the excep- 
tions of Navajo, Cree and Ojibwa, the 200 Ame- 
rindian tongues which have survived until now in the 
United States and Canada are endangered. 
Between a third and a half of Latin America’s 
500 Amerindian languages are in danger, with the

where most languages are spoken by very small 
communities. 
The languages of Southeast Asia are each spoken 
by relatively large numbers of people, and the future 
of about 40 of the 600 to 700 languages there will 
depend largely on government policies. 
On the other hand, only six languages out of 
north-east Asia’s 47 have any real chance of survival 
in the face of Russian. Twenty are “nearly extinct”, 
eight are “seriously endangered” and 13 are “endan- 
gered”. T he first group are spoken by only a dozen 
people at most. The second group are more widely 
used but are not being passed down to children. The 
third category includes tongues spoken by some chil- 
dren but fewer and fewer, according to the forth - 
coming UNESCO Red Book on Endangered Lan- 
guages: Europe and N orth-east Asia. 
In Europe, where the number of languages 
varies by a factor of two according to the criteria 
used to define them, 123 languages are spoken, 
including nine which are nearly extinct, 26 seriously 
endangered and 38 endangered, according to the 
UNESCO book. L

### 119480: Zaparo's lost secrets

> For the last three years young Zaparo led by 
Manari and supported by the Pastaza Indigenous 
Peoples’ Organization (OPIP) have been engaged 
in a battle to save their culture and traditional way 
of life as hunters and gatherers. They have three 
main objectives: to keep alive the Zaparo langua- 
ge, to clearly mark out Zaparo territory and to 
arrange a meeting with Zaparo who live over the 
border in Peru.The results so far have not been 
very encouraging. 
The last shaman 
They have not been able to meet their Peruvian 
kinsfolk, from whom they have been separated since 
a war between Ecuador and Peru nearly 60 years 
ago. The journey can take a month when the river is 
low and up to three months during a flood. It was 
only a couple of months ago that someone gave the 
Zaparo a small motor-boat. Diplomatic contacts 
would also have to be made to enable the Ecuadorian 
Zaparo to journey into disputed territory. 
“We're Ecuadorians,” says Manari, “but once 
upon a time the Zaparo were a single people living 
in a single forest. So we're not used to getting per- 
mission to cross borders or search for our people.” 
The plan is for a group of four children, alrea- 
dy chosen, to go and meet the shamans on the 
Peruvian side who will teach them their methods. 
This is crucial if the community is to survive, 
because when the last shaman died three years 
ago, the Zaparo lost their only source of knowled- 
ge about their traditions, the healing power of 
plants and the secrets of the jungle. “Since my 
father died, there’s been no one to look after us, 
and many people are ill and dying,” says Manari. 
Traditional knowledge and the remedies of 
shamans can only be handed down through lan- 
guage. Preserving the Zaparo language is more 
than just a cultural matter. The physical survival 
of the community itself is at stake. And the plan 
to save it is a race against time because only five 
very old people still speak Zaparo and they live 
several days’ journey from each other. One of 
them is Sasiko Takiauri, who was born about 70 
years ago on the banks of the Conambo. “In those 
days,” he says, “everyone spoke Zaparo. I didn’t 
learn Quechua until I was 18.” 
The story of Zaparo is similar to that of other 
indigenous languages in the Ecuadorian-Peruvian 
region. Zaparo forms part of the Zaparoan lin- 
guistic group, together with Arabela, Iquito and 
Taushniro, and is related to other languages that 
have already disappeared (Konambo, Gae and 
Andoa).It gave way to Quechua relatively recent- 
ly. It was about 60 years ago, according to Sasiko, 
that the Zaparo began identifying with the cultu- 
re of the Quechua Indians through frequent tra- 
ding with the Quechua village of Sarayacu. 
These days, Sasiko’s grandchildren and great- 
grandchildren who live in the Zaparo villages of 
Llanchama, Cocha, Jandia Yacu and Mazaramu, 
are taught Quechua and Spanish under a bilin- 
gual curriculum decreed by the government.T he 
teachers, secondary school graduates who do not 
originate from the villages where they teach, are 
paid $4 a month and openly say they will leave 
the region as soon as they can. Most of their 
pupils do not speak Spanish and learn Quechua 
almost entirely in oral form. 
“We don’t like asking for help,” says Manari, 
“but since there are now only a few of us left, we're 
afraid it’s the end of the road.” Meanwhile, the old 
folk, led by Sasiko, are once again giving children 
names in the vernacular—such as Newa, Toaro, 
Mukutzagua (Partridge, Parrot, Oriole)—to show 
the world the Zaparo have not died out. [|

ack in 1919, U.S. President Woodrow 
B Wilson managed to have the Treaty of 
Versailles, which ended the First World War 
between Germany and the Allies, written in 
English as well as French. Since then,English has 
taken root in diplomacy and gradually in econo- 
mic relations and the media. The language now 
seems set to have a monopoly as the worldwide 
medium of communication. 
As the 21st century begins, faster economic 
globalization is going hand in hand with the gro- 
wing use of English. More and more people are 
being encouraged to use or send messages in 
English rather than in their own language. Many 
do not mind.They see this as part of the unavoi- 
dable trend towards worldwide uniformity and a 
means whereby a growing number of people can 
communicate directly with each other. 
From this point of view, the spread of English 
may be seen as a positive development which saves 
resources and makes cultural exchange easier. 
After all, it might be said, the advance of English 1s 
not aimed at killing off local languages but 1s sim- 
ply a means of reaching a wider audience. 
Perhaps. But accepting that as the last word 
ignores the deep-rooted ties between individual 
freedom and political power, between the linguis- 
tic, social and economic mechanisms which in 
every society underpin relations between people 
and groups and between culture and communi- 
ties. A person makes a mark through his or her 
ability to use the most useful language or lan- 
guages. And over several generations, the most 
useful language eliminates the others. 
Cultural imperialism is much more subtle 
than economic imperialism, which is itself less

tangible and visible than political and military 
imperialism, whose excesses are obvious and easy 
to denounce. It would be wrong to say that the 
world domination of English is something delibe- 
rately organized and supported by the Anglo- 
Saxon powers, hand in glove with political initia- 
tives or the penetration of the world economy by 
their transnational firms. The “language war” has 
very seldom been regarded as a war and has 
never, anywhere, been declared. 
T he military, diplomatic, political and econo- 
mic strategies of the major powers can be studied 
and criticized, but linguistic strategies seem to be 
inconspicuous and tacit, even innocent or non- 
existent. T he history of the past century has obli- 
ged many powers to take a more modest attitude 
to language, but has it taught them to stand up to 
domination by a single language? 
Many years after the founding in 1945 of the 
Arab League, whose current 22 member states have 
250 million people, the countries which share a 
French linguistic heritage broke new ground by 
creating a joint policy. In order to promote linguis- 
tic, economic and political co-operation, they set 
up the International Organization of French- 
Speaking Countries, which (like the 
Commonwealth) embraces more than 50 coun- 
tries with over 500 million inhabitants. 
Since 1991, there have been conferences of 
Dutch-speakers from eight or more communities

» representing some 40 million people, as well as 
Ibero-American summits, which every two years 
bring together more than 20 countries (350 mil- 
lion inhabitants). Turkish-speaking summits have 
been held biennially since 1992, with delegates 
from six independent countries (120 million 
people) of Europe, Central Asia and small ethnic 
communities elsewhere. Since 1996, the 
Association of Portuguese-speaking countries has 
brought together people from seven countries 
(200 million people). 
Pockets 
of resistance 
Will unco-ordinated resistance by the world’s 
most widely-used languages be enough to cope 
with the threat of cultural uniformity? Perhaps 
not, since each language has its own geographical 
sphere in which it is used with varying degrees of 
competence. If you add up the number of spea- 
kers of the world’s dozen most-used languages, 
you come up with a figure of more than three bil- 
lion—half of humanity—which easily surpasses 
the two billion for whom English is more or less 
the official language (the Commonwealth and the 
United States). Backed by a concerted strategy, 
these major languages would surely make head- 
way in international institutions. 
It is not just the future of the world’s major 
languages that is at stake. Further down the scale 
are 100 or so tongues officially recognized by 
governments or sub-national regions, such as the 
constitutional languages of India and the lan- 
guages of the Russian nationalities. These lan- 
guages have their place and a right to defend it. At 
the bottom of the scale are thousands of some- 
times struggling languages variously called native, 
minority, communal or ethnic tongues. Most are 
in danger of disappearing. They are spoken by 
some 300 million people. 
Will minor languages die out, as some pre- 
dict? Yes, because the best way to kill off a lan- 
guage is to teach another one. The monopoly that 
about 100 national languages have on education 
makes it inevitable that languages not taught in 
schools will be confined to the home and to folk- 
lore and eventually be pushed out of nurturing 
cultural environments. 
Language murder or “linguicide”, whether it 
is carried out intentionally or not, is one of the 
basic tools of ethnocide, of the deculturation of 
peoples which has always been perpetrated by 
colonization and is still the semi-official aim of 
governments which do not recognize the rights of 
their native ethnic minorities. As local languages 
are increasingly excluded from education sys- 
tems, “linguicide” is speeding up. 
The language issue in the 21st century 
raises two questions. How can widely-used or 
national languages resist the encroachment of 
English? And how can minority languages in dan- 
ger of extinction be saved and gain access to deve- 
lopment? [| 


### 119483: The Trials of a Gikuyu writer

The trials of a Gikuyu writer 
 
DP Mwangi wa Mutahi 
Kenyan novelist Mwangi wa Mutahi is now an ardent defender of his native language 
but he was once as hostile to it as some of his own teachers 
    
  
 
2 4 The Unesco Courier - April 2000 
Kenya gained independence. My sole language, as 
a child, was Gikuyu. It was the language in which 
we sang songs, narrated stories, exchanged riddles or 
merely chatted, while around us adults conversed in 
proverb-loaded exchanges. To the best of my recol- 
lection, Gikuyu, spoken by about 22 per cent of the 
Kenyan population, was the only language we were 
taught during the first three years at school, although 
I had learnt the English alphabet in nursery school. In 
our fourth year, English was reintroduced, and we 
was born into a peasant family in 1963, the year

had to bid farewell to Gikuyu. From there on, spea- 
king or writing in our mother tongue was forbidden by 
school rules. Speaking it exposed us to beating and 
punishment, and in some cases temporary expulsion. 
The resentment with which Gikuyu and other African 
languages were treated in my school was almost uni- 
versal in Kenyan primary schools. In the mind of my 
educators, African languages were not actually lan- 
guages but primitive vernaculars. 
For a while, before and after my college studies, I 
taught in secondary school, an experience which gave 
me the opportunity to show my own attitudes towards 
African languages.Would I be able to nurture Gikuyu 
in my students, or would I worship foreign languages

### 119483: The Trials of a Gikuyu writer

while despising my own? Not surprisingly, I turned 
out to be as good a disciple of the colonial heritage as 
my fellow teachers who worked hard to enforce the 
school rules. I found myself beating and punishing 
students whenever and wherever they attempted to 
speak in their mother tongue. Like many before me, 
I found myself adopting the colonial doctrine accor- 
ding to which speaking and learning African lan- 
guages stunt the student’s ability to learn. And 
because the national examinations were in English, 
students were easily convinced that they needed to 
master this language in order to excel. 
Decades after acquiring political independence, 
the colonial system of education remains intact. No 
significant policy changes in the teaching of Kenya’s 
lan guages—the country counts about 40—have been 
made. With the exception of Kiswahili, proclaimed 
by the late leader Jomo Kenyatta as an official lan- 
guage along with English, the government tends to 
look upon local languages as a threat to national 
unity. Emphasis is still put on excelling in English- 
language examinations, and plenty of African edu- 
cators uphold this system. It is the route to prestige, 
to potential studies and jobs, locally and abroad. 
Writer's block 
For me, the turning point came at the age of 32, 
when I sat down to write my first novel. At the 
time I was living in the United States, working as a 
research scientist. In writing N goima, 1 wished to 
portray the independent Kenyan government in 
its true neo-colonial colours. I wanted to write for 
an audience of peasants, workers and dispossessed 
people. My story exposes issues of corruption and 
neglect in the health care system through a woman 
who runs into complications during her pregnancy. 
I began writing in English, but after the first two 
paragraphs I realized that the message that I wanted 
to deliver, in my mind, was in Gikuyu.T his language 
that I had grown up speaking at home was more 
deeply rooted in my mind than I had thought. Asthe 
story unfolded and I tried to write dialogue, I stum- 
bled again. Was it not false to have my two main cha- 
racters, both peasant farmers, speak in English? Both 
were at home in the Gikuyu language and culture. By 
this time, the writing of N goima was at a standstill. 
Several months later, without having picked up 
the manuscript again, I had the opportunity to 
return home to Kenya, where I spent time among 
the kind of people I knew when I was growing up. 
In a mysterious manner, this visit home rekindled 
my writing of N goima. It was as if I had the oppor- 
tunity of conversing in person with my two fic- 
tional characters. At the beginning of 1997, I started 
N goima again, this time in Gikuyu. My thoughts 
were so clear that in two months I had completed 
the first draft of the novel. 
Gikuyu’s written development has been stunted 
because there are not enough people writing in it. 
New words,terms and spellings have lagged behind 
other more widely spoken tongues. I ran into these dif- 
ficulties throughout the writing of my novel but found 
inspiration in two other writers (Gakaara and Ngugi)

who had chosen to write in Gikuyu before me. My 
book started selling in February 1999. My father, a 
peasant whose reading for most of his life had been 
confined to the Bible and hymns, told me that reading 
the book had been an “educational experience” for 
him. In following the characters’lives, he had also gai- 
ned a better understanding of some of the social and 
economic issues facing his community. 
A way to empowerment 
The way N goima has been received is a small tes- 
timony that African languages are well and truly alive, 
even though publishers rarely accept manuscripts in 
them and English continues to be equated with natio- 
nal and international recognition. Although intellec- 
tuals and writers have taken a firm stand in defence of 
all Kenyan languages, their real bedrock of support is 
found amongst peasants and workers. They are the 
ones who have kept the languages alive and evolving. 
They are also the ones who are in dire need of reading 
materials in their mother tongue.

Writers and scholars from all regions of Africa 
gathered in Eritrea last January for a timely confe- 
rence entitled “Against all Odds: African languages

conference of its kind on African soil, and was held 
in a country that has incorporated nine languages 
into its education and development agenda.l rea-

guages are going to die, but rather push for ways in 
which they can be more widely spoken, read and 
translated. To some, writing in our own language is 
a betrayal of the elite system. I now see it as the way 
to break with neocolonial mentalities and empo- 
wer the African people. Listening to writers in Afri- 
can languages from all over the continent was an 
inspiration to continue writing in Gikuyu, and I am 
now back home, busy at work on my new novel. Bl

izebgatin im a yelli ghriba” (“Please, 
father Inouba, open the door / Oh Ghriba 
girl, jingle your bracelets”). 
This refrain from a Kabyle song, “A Vava 
Inouva,” rang out around the world in the early 
1970s. Only 10 million or so Berbers, scattered 
over the Sahara and North Africa, could unders- 
tand the words, but the song became an interna- 
tional hit. 
Its young Algerian author, Hamid Cheriet, 
took the stage name of Idir (“he shall live” in 
Kabyle). “At a time when many epidemics were 
raging, new-born babies were called Idir to ward 
off bad luck,” he says. “I chose it as a tribute to 
my culture, which I felt was threatened.” 
The Berber people, who mostly live in the 
mountains of Morocco and Algeria, speak Shawiya, 
Shilha, Kabyle, Mzab, Rifain, Tachelhit, Tuareg, 
Targi and Tarifit—all dialects of Tamazight, their 
native tongue, which is only recognized as a natio- 
nal language in Niger and Mali. In other places, 
Berber culture is ignored or even banned. 
“They give me an Algerian passport, but I 
have to get permission to speak my own langua- 
ge,” says Idir who, like the great Martinican poet 
“Tw elli yi n taburt a vava invba / ccencen 
t 
 
Aimé Césaire, speaks up for “those who have no 
voice.” 
It never occurred to him to write in French, 
the language of the colonizer in which he did all 
his schooling, right up to a Ph.D in geology. Nor 
would he write in Arabic, which was taught as a 
second language in Algeria at the time. 
“If I hadn’t left my village, I'd never have spo- 
ken a word of Arabic,” he says. “French and 
Arabic would allow me to get my message over to 
a wider audience, but I wouldn’t know how to go 
about it or what to say.” 
Kabyle is a language of feelings and storytel- 
ling that flows naturally in poetry. It is also the 
language Idir has chosen to use. “To sing in 
Kabyle is a militant act, a way of expressing my 
rebellion, to say that I exist,” he says. “If I'd had 
another profession, I would have found other 
ways to express the same demands.” 
Three languages for Algeria 
The young Hamid Cheriet stumbled on sin- 
ging by accident. He was born in 1955 in Ait 
Lahcéne, a remote mountain village in Kabylia. 
When he was nine, he went with his parents, sis- 
ter and two brothers to Algiers. He attended a 
school run by Jesuits,where “being Kabyle meant 
you were part of some kind of dirty rebellion.” 
His natural sciences teacher taught him to 
strum a guitar. The future geologist started writing 
songs when he was 16 and warmed to the Kabyle 
singers. In 1973, he was asked to stand in at the last 
minute for the famous singer Nouara, who was 
unable to sing live on the Kabyle radio station in 
Algiers the lullaby he had written for her. 
Idir was an immediate success. In 1975, he 
came to Paris to sign a contract with Pathé- 
Marconi and stayed in France. Ever since, this 
child of the Aurés mountains has celebrated 
Berber culture through music, thus extending a 
movement launched in the 1940s by major 
Algerian writers such as Jean Amrouche, 
Mouloud Mammeri, Mouloud Feraoun and 
Kateb Yacine.T hese pioneers had to use French 
to defend the Berber language if they were to get 
a hearing. As Amrouche put it:“I think and write 
in French, but I weep in Kabyle.” 
These days, Idir can go further than that. He 
advocates three languages for Algeria—Arab, 
Berber and French. “I want Algeria to take into 
account those who live on its land, who love the 
country and want to build it whatever their origin, 
language or religion,” he says. “Islam shouldn’t be

## [Page 27](119473eng.pdf#page=27) 0

### 119484: Berber's shining star

  
an official religion. Religion is for believers, not 
governments. Arabic shouldn’t have a special sta- 
tus just because it’s the holy language of the 
Koran—especially classical Arabic, a sanitized 
tongue ordinary people can’t understand. No lan- 
guage is more worthy than another, even if Berber 
is the oldest in terms of years. Fate has put these 
languages on this land and they must remain 
there.” 
Straddling two cultures 
But for the time being, the Kabyle radio station 
that opened in 1948 is still the only media outlet in 
Algeria that uses Berber. It is also “the only one 
monitored by a censorship board,” says Idir. Ano- 
ther French colonial legacy enables “you to get 
credits in Berber towards your baccalaureate gra- 
duation exam if you want.” But the language is not 
part of the national curriculum. Since his election 
in April 1999, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has 
ruled out officially recognizing Berber, except after 
a referendum that Kabyles fear might backfire. 
A Basque writer 
Languages: conflict or coexistence? 
“It’s a very dangerous idea. If such a vote took 
place, the result might well be ‘no’,” says Idir. 
“And if people say ‘no’ and reject a part of them- 
selves, it would mean there’s nothing we can do 
together. Except for a few fanatics, Berbers have 
never wanted independence.” Their main 
demand is to be recognized as Berbers in their 
own country. “As a Kabyle, I want to be an 
Algerian through and through, not just partially, 
as I am today,” he says. 
A member of a minority group both in Algeria 
and in France, Idir has chosen to straddle cultures. 
“Identities”, the title of his latest album, released by 
Sony at the end of last year,is far from bland.Sin- 
ging with him are Ireland’s Karen M atheson,Geof- 
frey Oryema from Uganda, Bretons Gilles Ser vat 
and Dan Ar Braz, the French-Galician Manu Chao, 
the French groups Gnawa Diffusion and Zebda 
(of Arab and Berber origins), all of them represen- 
tatives of small cultures. He says they have allowed 
him to show that his own minority culture can be 
part of the wider world. [| 


### 119485: A Basque writer leaps into translation

leaps into translation 
“Euskera, ialgi adi kanpora” (“Basque language, step forward!”). Bernard Atxaga® 
couldn’t agree more with these words from a 16th-century Basque song. 
  
J Among Bernardo Atxaga’s 
works published in English are 
Lone Man (Harvill,1996) and 
Obabakoak (Vintage, 1993) 
ome 600,000 people in the Spanish Basque 
ountry and Navarra, and another 80,000 in 
the Pyrénées Orientales department of south- 
western France. Its origins are unknown, but it 
has probably existed for over 4,000 years. 
Euskera’s development was severely stunted 
during Spain’s 40-year Franco dictatorship. Then 
came a major recovery. Euskera became a shared 
literary language, won recognition in 1979 as a 
joint official language with Spanish, and has been 
promoted through teaching. 
Basque literature has also been flowering in 
the hands of a group of dedicated writers. One of 
them,Bernardo Atxaga, 48, who won the Spanish 
National Fiction Prize in 1989 for Obabakoak, is 
the first writer in the Basque language to achieve 
an international reputation.

S 
Did the crackdown on Euskera during the Franco 
era really happen, or is it a myth? 
It definitely happened, but it’s also true that 
Euskera wasn’t doing so well before the Civil War. 
Only a society that can afford to have doctors on 
call on Sundays, as it were, can afford to be 
concerned about saving its language. Before the 
war, the Basque country was confronted with ter- 
rible economic problems. Saving the language 
was a miracle only intellectuals and priests could 
have performed. My own case is typical, in a way. 
My grandfather and great-grandfather were car- 
penters. They had plenty of other things to worry 
about than preserving the language. I had a diffe- 
rent kind of education from theirs, and it led me 
to ask why I was losing the use of a language that 
I had inherited. Political repression was fierce 
when I was a child. My brothers and I were bea- 
ten at school if we were caught speaking Euskera, 
the language we spoke at home. We knew we ris- 
ked punishment if we spoke Basque in public. 
With the coming of democracy, Basque autonomy 
and laws covering language, the situation changed 
totally within a few years. Today Basque isa 
compulsory school subject. What do you think about 
this? 
English is compulsory too. This is a very com- 
plex issue. How far does a state have the right to »

» lay down the law in education? At present, all 
states do so. The education ministry plays a very 
important role in all countries, and the area of 
freedom in this sphere is very small. That being 
said, people who live in the Basque country and 
don’t want to know anything about our language 
and culture aren’t worthy of respect. 
Do you think Euskera is used too much as a political 
pawn? 
I really don’t think so. I don’t see how half a 
million people can cause much mischief for 35 
million Spanish-speakers. On the contrary, I 
think there’s been a lot of unfairness on the part 
of the majority group. National newspapers never 
print anything positive about our language. I 
think that’s unjust. 
| see translation 
as a physical leap. 
And the leap from Basque 
to Spanish is enormous 
The unification of Euskera around an agreed version 
of the language continues to provoke controversy. 
Do you think standardization was necessary to 
enable Euskera to survive? 
No language in the world can develop if it is 
fundamentally divided. All languages spin off 
variants, but at the same time they seek the com- 
mon basis without which no language can per- 
form its higher functions. You can’t write books 
about architecture in pidgin, you have to use stan- 
dard English, which is better qualified to express 
what you want to say. Among English-speakers, 
each community develops its own accent, its own 
way of using the language. You can be for or 
against this but, as a language teacher I know 
used to tell his Chicano students: “You can speak 
Spanglish if you like, but if you want to study law, 
you'll have to write in English.” All languages that 
develop tend towards simplification. The same 
friend told me that language is nowhere more 
complex than in a village. In Chicago or New 
York, English is a lot simpler than it is in a remo- 
te village in Ireland. 
You're completely bilingual. Why do you always 
write first in Euskera? 
In literary terms, I'm used to thinking in 
Euskera. My stories or poems come to me in 
Euskera. It’s my personal language, the one I use 
to jot down ideas in my notebooks, whether I'm 
in Stockholm or Madrid. I’ve become used to 
doing that. It’s not much to do with ideology, it’s 
just the way I work. Some writers need to go into 
a monastery and stay there for a few months 
without setting foot outside. My writing ritual

involves writing first in Basque. I’ve come to the 
conclusion that it isn’t very important. I might 
just as well write in some other language. 
But you insist on translating your own work. 
Some languages are quite close to each other, 
they're like tracings that match when you put one 
on top of another. This is the case with Catalan 
and Spanish. I see translation as a physical leap, 
and the jump from Catalan to Spanish is like 
stepping off the pavement onto the road. With 
Basque, the leap is enormous. And leaving it to a 
translator is a risky business. My translations are 
usually the work of several hands. Close friends of 
mine produce a rough draft and I extract a final 
version from it. It’s very hard to explain what it’s 
like being a bilingual writer. Sitting down to 
translate one’s own work is a mind-bending expe- 
rience. Every time I do it, the gap between the 
two texts seems to widen. 
Yet your books are translated into other languages 
from Spanish. Isn’t that a bit of a cop-out? 
Not at all, because I believe that language is 
always part of a person’s way of life, and for me 
Spanish is also a first language. There are two first 
languages in my life and luckily I can express 
myself just as well in both. 
Do you consider yourself a nationalist? 
I rather like Spain. I'm not in favour of politi- 
cal independence. I don’t think Spain’s a bad 
society or a bad country. You can be part of it and 
have a critical eye. [|

Languages: conflict or coexistence? 
Concordant voices 
 


### 119486: In praise of multilingualism

  
In praise of multilingualism 
We ought to promote trilingualism and save ‘small languages’ by teaching them, says 
linguist Joseph Poth? 
Is there a link between language policy and the 
culture of peace? 
Yes,they’re directly connected. When a minority 
mother tongue comes under attack, its users feel 
uncomfortable and experience an inner conflict. And 
when people aren’t at peace with themselves, they 
can’t be at peace with others. Languages are still the 
only tools which allow us to communicate—to 
relate to and understand each other—whether by 
writing, speaking or through the Internet. This idea 
of focusing on languages as instruments of dia- 
logue to tackle intolerance and violence has been the 
driving force behind UNEScO’s Linguapax pro- 
gramme (see box page 30) for more than 15 years. 
Isn’t the international community very slow in 
getting to grips with the language question? 
It’s coming round to it. Sixty-nine countries 
presented a draft resolution to the United Nations 
General Assembly in December 1999 to promote

Division 
respect for multilingualism. UNEsco’s General 
Conference has just passed four resolutions backing 
language diversity and multilingual education. The 
European Union and the Council of Europe are 
planning a European Year of Languages in 2001 with 
UNESco backing. This is a good example of inter- 
national co-operation because it involves all lan- 
guages, not just European ones. It will also mark the 
start of many other projects around the world. 
How do you explain this about-turn? 
For several years now, the language question has 
been high on the world education agenda. UNESCO 
member states are increasingly asking us to help 
solve very complicated language problems and 
issues. Europe, along with Asia and Latin Ame- 
rica, has realized that the third millennium will be 
an era of co-operation and and confederation and 
that the need to preserve identities will have to be 
balanced with the demands of communication. 
What’s the chief aim of international language 
policy? 
To promote trilingualism in every society. This is a 
goal some countries achieved a long time ago. 
Luxemburg, for example. If you tell Luxembur- 
gers they can “afford the luxury” of having three lan- 
guages because they're rich,they’ll tell you they’re 
rich precisely because they're rooted in trilingualism. 
What are these three languages we have to learn? 
Our mother tongue,obviously, a “neighbour”lan- 
guage and an international language. UNESCO’s 
language policy replaces the standard idea of a 
“foreign”language with the notion of a neighbour 
language, a language spoken just over the border. We 
most often go to war against our neighbours, so we 
have to learn their language, discover their needs and 
ambitions and know their culture and values. 
Minority languages are meanwhile steadily 
disappearing. How can they be saved? 
Alanguage is always in danger when it isn’t part 
of the school curriculum. Once it’s given the status 
of a teaching language, even for just part of the cur- 
riculum, a whole “rescue apparatus” is created and 
the language becomes alive again and is saved. 
Is monolingualism a handicap? 
It’s always a great disadvantage. It means you only 
see the world through the inevitably limited dimen- 
sion of a single language, even if it’s a world language. 
It’s also a factor of domination because people who 
can afford to stay monolingual live in countries that 
have overwhelming political, economic and military 
power. And it adds to “linguistic insecurity”, a new 
concept which reflects a very old truth. Even at 
UNESCO, we see it regularly at international gathe- 
rings. Delegates who speak minority languages often 
don’t speak up. They have very good ideas but don’t 
dare to express them because they feel uncomfortable

Defenders of diversity 
Movements supporting linguistic diversity are building up the pressure 
for an international agreement on language rights

UNESco’s work in the field of languages began to take off in 
the mid-1980s. A key step was the launch of the Linguapax pro- 
ject in 1986. T his was designed “to associate the teaching of lan- 
guages with the promotion of international understanding and 
peace,” says Félix Marti, head of UNESCO’s Advisory Committee 
for Linguistic Pluralism and Multilingual Education, which was 
set up in 1998. 
In the last 15 years, Linguapax has provided technical 
back-up for a number of national and regional projects, inclu- 
ding the rebuilding of Cambodia’s educational system around 
the Khmer language. This involved producing two million 
school textbooks in Khmer and training a team of Cambodian 
teachers and editors. Linguapax has also set up an inter-uni- 
versity network co-ordinated by the University of Mons 
(Belgium) to promote the project and its methods, and is wor- 
king on a report on the world’s languages (see below). 
Protecting linguistic diversity and encouraging multilingual 
education are two closely-related goals. To promote the for- 
mer, Linguapax has put together guides and manuals for tea- 
chers and policy-makers in countries, especially in Africa, that 
want to incorporate local languages into their education sys- 
tem. A new project, called Pericles, will promote the learning 
of neighbouring languages by encouraging young people from 
adjacent countries to work together to preserve shared natural 
and cultural heritage sites. A project currently at an experi- 
mental stage in the border region where Luxemburg, France 
and Germany meet is designed to be applied internationally 
wherever there is a desire to boost regional co-operation or in 
areas recovering from wars. 
There is international awareness about the need to protect 
the non-tangible heritage of humanity such as languages but 
there is no legal instrument to back it up. “Unfortunately the- 
re’s no international agreement referring specifically to linguis- 
tic rights,” says Marti.“It’s a very sensitive subject, but it is up 
to UNESCO to draft an international instrument to protect 
them which could be adopted by most countries.” 
Report on 
the World’s Languages 
“What is the name of your language?Is it used in written form? 
Where is it spoken? What are its geographical frontiers?’ T hese 
and many other questions feature in a UNESCO world language 
survey begun in 1997.The answers to them, along with input from 
research institutes, specialists and bibliographical sources, will go 
into the first edition of a UNEsco Report on theWorld’s Languages, 
to be published in 2001. 
3 0 The Unesco Courier - April 2000 
The report will provide a new working tool to help pro- 
tect the linguistic heritage of humanity. It will comprise rele- 
vant and objective information about the status, use and 
evolution of the world’s languages. As well as filling an infor- 
mation gap, the report has the more ambitious goal of pro- 
posing solutions and possible action to further the rescue 
and development of languages in danger of dying out. 
The first International 
Mother Language Day

At the suggestion of UNESCO member states,the Organi-

Headquarters in Paris. 
 
NGOs for 
linguistic pluralism 
The defence of languages, their variety and pluralism is 
winning increasingly wide international support,especially 
through the work of non-governmental organizations. Below, a 
sample of activities in this field. 
Terralingua

http://cougar.ucdavis.edu/nas/terralin/ 
Terralingua, a nongovernmental organization set up in 1996, 
believes that preservation of the physical and the intangible heri- 
tage of humanity are two sides of the same coin, because their 
fates are intertwined and they are threatened by the same socio- 
economic factors. Everything that is done to protect the lands, 
languages and cultures of indigenous peoples is vital for safe- 
guarding the planet’s diversity, because although these people 
comprise only five per cent of the world’s population they speak 
57 per cent of its languages and inhabit regions where biologi- 
cal diversity is greatest. 
The Terralingua website, which has a wealth of informa- 
tion and links to other organizations with the same goals, is 
open to all kinds of contributions, from proverbs and poems 
in any language to money donations to the Endangered Lan- 
guage Fund,whose watchword is “When a language is gone, 
it 1s gone forever”.

Surfing on 
a sea of languages 
A mass of information about languages can be 
found on the Internet, which is increasingly used as 
a working tool by students, translators and tea- 
chers. They can find sites from which they can 
download for free the characters of currently used 
alphabets, such as Cyrillic, Mandarin or Hebrew, 
alphabets that have died out, such as Egyptian hie- 
roglyphics, and even invented languages such as 
that created by J.R.R. Tolkien, author of the epic tri- 
logy The Lord of the Rings, not to mention sites offe- 
ring exercises in English or Spanish. 
Surfers can also access the terminology database 
of the European Union’s translation service. Titled 
Eurodicautom, it is a kind of super-dictionary with 
more than 5.5 million entries in 12 European lan- 
guages. 
But in the battle for multilingualism, the Internet 
is a double-edged sword, since most of its contents 
are only in English. The 1999-2000 edition of 
UNEsco’s World Communication and Information 
Report quotes from surveys done by the Internet 
Society and by Euromarketing to the effect that 
58% of Internet users are English-speakers. After 
them, far behind, come those who speak Spanish 
(8.7%), German (8.6%), Japanese (7.9%) and 
French (3.7%). 
In terms of the number of web pages, the domi- 
nation of English is even greater—at 81%, followed 
by German (4%), Japanese,French and the Scan- 
dinavian languages (2% each) and Spanish (1%). 
The world’s other languages account for barely 8% 
of the Net’s web pages.

PD Marcos Almeida 
The Shuar people of the Ecuadorian Amazon have turned their language into a powerful tool 
to safeguard their autonomy and cultural identity 
It would not be a good 
thing for the Mixe 
language to disappear, 
because it represents 
our culture. We have 
inherited it from our 
ancestors. If it were to 
be lost, nothing would 
be left from the past

orian Amazon. Long known to the outside world 
as the Jivaro, their tough, independent character 
and their legendary technique of shrinking human 
heads have been described by many travellers and mis- 
sionaries. T hey proudly claim that they have never been 
conquered.Now these one-time hunters and gathe- 
rers, who turned to rearing cattle, growing citrus fruit 
or practicing traditional horticulture deep in the Ama- 
zonian forest, have taken a route into the modern world 
that enables them to keep their language and culture. 
Salesian Catholic priests who came to the 
region to convert the indigenous people to Chris- 
tianity witnessed the land seizures, settler brutality 
and other injustices of which the Shuar were vic- 
tims. They answered their appeal for help by streng- 
thening the cohesion of Shuar society and culture 
so that they could meet the challenges of rampant 
greed and modernization. 
In 1964, the priests helped the Shuar to shape 
their destiny by setting up the Federation of Shuar 
Centres, the first autonomous organization of its 
kind in Latin America.A precursor of the indige- 
nous Indian movement which became an impor- 
tant political force in Ecuador in the 1990s, the 
federation became to all intents and purposes a 
Shuar state within the Ecuadorian state. Its man- 
date covered everything from land distribution to 
the administration of health and education services. 
T- Shuar are an indigenous people of the Ecua- 
d 
Bilingual schooling by radio 
The main agent of this limited autonomous inte- 
gration was the Bi-cultural Shuar Radio Education 
System (SERBISH). Radio proved to be the most 
suitable means of communication in the inaccessible 
region of dense forests and impenetrable mountains 
where the Shuar live. A radio education scheme using 
Shuara and Spanish began in 1968 and four years 
later officially became the backbone of the bilingual 
schools which had recently been set up. 
The chief purpose of bilingual and bicultural 
education was to teach people Spanish so they 
could demand equal treatment as Ecuadorian citi- 
zens and to enable Shuara to become a vibrant 
modern language. Shuar families were enthusiastic 
from the start about a system which did not require 
them to send their children away to austere Salesian 
boarding schools where they would be cut off from 
their environment and culture. Making bilingua- 
lism acceptable meant Shuar children no longer 
needed to be ashamed of speaking their own lan- 
guage. 
SERBISH started out with 33 schools. Within 
two years it was broadcasting to 120 and numbers 
have been rising ever since. Today, it reaches four 
provinces of eastern Ecuador, and provides educa- 
tion for about 7,500 children—out of a Shuar 
population of 70,000—in 297 schools teaching 
from primary to the end of the secondary level. 
Linguistic pioneers 
The ministry of education has authorized the 
work of “tele-auxiliaries”, Shuar teachers paid by 
the government or local volunteers who receive a 
wage for helping children to listen and learn from 
the radio programmes while the teacher attends to 
pupils at another grade. 
The school system comprises a national curricu- 
lum which prepares children for official exams in Spa- 
nish and another which teaches a course in Shuar lan- 
guage and culture. At first, the courses kept close to 
the national curriculum, including its religious bias 
due to the Salesians’ influence. Today coursework 
focuses more on the traditional Shuar world-view, 
and includes components on folklore, craft techniques 
and local plant and animal life as well as lessons to 
prepare children for modern life. In addition to a 
secondary school diploma in Intercultural Bilingual 
Education (EIB) and in chemistry and biology, SER- 
BISH has for the past year offered one in farming tech- 
nology, including sustainable use of resources. 
The Shuar are rightly proud of being pioneers, 
not just in Ecuador but worldwide, and are not 
deterred by the current serious problems of their 
country, crushed by heavy foreign debt, massive 
financial crisis and a plan to make the U.S. dollar 
the national currency which may have grave conse- 
quences for the poorest Ecuadorians. 
The Shuar Federation’s radio equipment has not 
been updated since the 1960s, which means recep- 
tion is poor in some remote communities. Agree- 
ments were signed last year with foreign aid institu- 
tions including Germany’s GTZ, which topped up 
the meagre funding from the Ecuadorian ministry of 
education.Many teachers, who earn just over $40 a 
month, cannot travel to the remotest communities, 
which can only be reached by small plane. 
But it will take more than that to discourage the

determined Shuar. Relying on their organizational 
strength,they now have some very ambitious pro- 
jects, incljuding one for an educational television 
station, for which they are seeking foreign technical 
assistance and funding. 
In the search for an alternative to modernization 
imposed from above, the Shuar have managed to 
reduce semi-illiteracy to seven per cent and total 
illiteracy to two per cent. With the self-confidence 
his people are famous for, Guillermo Sensu, head of 
EIB for Morona-Santiago province, declares his 
faith in the future.“I can assure you we’re going to 
fight for our rights to education,” he says. 


### 119489: India: bursting at the linguistic seams

India: bursting 
at the linguistic seams 
  
D Amitav Choudhry 
In Ecuador, where a third of the population 
speaks one or more indigenous languages, people 
had to wait until the new 1998 Constitution for 
formal recognition that “For the indigenous 
peoples, Quechua, Shuara and other ancient lan- 
guages are officially used.” 
French linguist Louis-Jean Calvet notes that 
Shuar linguistic policy is atypical because it is com- 
pletely independent of the state.“As a policy for a 
minority, decided by them and applied by them, it 
shows how the expansion of the world’s steadily- 
growing language empires is not inevitable and that 
it is possible to fight to be different in a world that’s

languages are facing extinction as majority languages gain ground

choice.

consists of 26 states and six Union territories, a 
number of which were formed in 1956 on a unilin- 
gual basis to reduce the number of linguistic mino- 
rities by bringing together people who speak a com- 
mon language. But the official languages adopted 
by the states and territories are not necessarily spo- 
ken by all their respective populations; not one of 
them is completely monolingual. 
English, a social 
status symbol 
This structure has encouraged the develop- 
ment of some languages at the expense of others. 
There are, for instance, over 1,600 languages 
known as mother tongues, the great majority of 
which have no official status and therefore lack 
protection. Further complexity is added by the 
fact that every language community consists of at 
least three interlanguages. Hindi alone has 48 
variants. In this country where nationhood is a 
recent phenomenon, language has become a focal 
point of socio-political action. Unsurprisingly, 
language policy has always been a subject of 
debate and controversy between politicians, edu- 
cators and planners. 
Today in the official domain there is a strict hie- 
rarchy of Indian languages. At the top are Hindi 
and English. Next come the official languages of 
the states and territories, followed by languages 
which, although not used for administrative pur- 
poses, are spoken by more than a million people. 
Hundreds of others at the foot of the ladder are 
monitored by a Commissioner for Linguistic Mino- 
rities who only has advisory powers and cannot 
force state governments to follow his recommen- 
dations. Some state governments are optimistically 
hoping that minority languages within their juris- 
diction will die out before they get a chance to be 
used in education. 
Meanwhile, English is gaining ground. In 1949 
constitutional provision was made for parliamen- 
tary business to be transacted in Hindi or in English 
but that after 15 years only Hindi should be used. 
However, after this time had elapsed, Hindi was 
just as much a foreign language as English for two- 
thirds of the population. Regarded as a “neutral” 
language for wider communication, and the lan- 
guage of technology, modernity and development, 
English is also a social status symbol. T he resultant 
Anglomania is detrimental not only to the growth of 
Indian languages but also to the “normal” deve- 
lopment of Indian society. It sometimes reaches 
grotesque proportions. Politicians who decry the 
use of English sometimes send their children to the 
best schools in which English is the medium of ins- 
truction. 
Itis up to the intellectual elites of minority com- 
munities to promote their mother tongues. Often 
bi- or trilingual,they must initiate projects to keep 
out the neo-colonial intruder, give a new impetus to 
dying languages and adapt them to the modern 
world. [|

D Jean-Louis Calvet 
Languages: conflict or coexistence? 
States rarely manage to force people to use a language against their will. 
The fate of languages ultimately depends on their speakers’ needs 
  
D Professor of social linguistics at 
the University 
of the Sorbonne, in Paris, 
and author of a score of books, 
which have been translated into a 
dozen languages. His works 
published in English include 
Roland Barthes, A Biography 
(1995). 
nterlocking parts ranging from the single cell 
o the ecosphere, the planet’s languages can be 
presented as a system based on gravity. Today the 
keystone of that system is English, a “hypercen- 
tral” language around which a dozen “supercen- 
tral” languages gravitate. Between 100 and 200 
“central” languages, linked to the supercentral 
ones through bilingual speakers, are in their turn 
surrounded by 4,000-5,000 “peripheral” lan- 
guages. 
These languages do not all have the same 
weight, the same vigour or the same prospects. The 
future of the vast majority is in doubt, and more 
and more efforts are being made to preserve them. 
Languages, like baby seals or whales, are regarded 
as endangered species (see pages 18 and 19). 
But anxiety is not only focusing on the “per- 
ipheral” languages. Concern is also being expres- 
sed about the widely-spoken hyper or super-central 
languages, including English and French. In the 
United States, organizations such as US English, 
US First and Save Our Schools are campaigning 
for English to be recognized as the country’s sole 
official language in face of growing bilingualism 
due to substantial Hispanic immigration. In 
France, the 1994 “Toubon Law” was an attempt to 
regulate the use of French by resisting the use of 
words borrowed from other languages. 
The myth 
of language purity 
Language purity is a myth which leads only to 
stagnation. The Latin that Cicero spoke is per- 
haps a pure language, but nobody speaks it any 
more. Today different versions of Latin that have 
developed over the centuries are used. They 
include Italian, Spanish, Romanian, French and 
Catalan. 
This myth, this desire to protect, illustrates a 
thoughtless fear of change, of borrowing words and 
expressions from other languages. It is as if only 
stability could somehow guarantee identity. How 
far can or should policies to protect languages go? 
Is it possible to keep alive language forms abando- 
ned by their users, sustaining them by a kind of 
drip-feed or other forms of intensive medication? 
Some language policies have been successful. 
In Turkey in the early part of the 20th century, 
J: as ecology depicts the world as a series of Kemal Atatiirk used authoritarian methods to 
reform the spelling of Turkish, and struck out of 
the Turkish dictionary words borrowed from 
Arabic and Farsi. Indonesia has adopted a uni- 
fying language, Bahasa. In other countries, things 
have been less straightforward. Arabization in 
Algeria is still confronted by major obstacles, and 
the attempt by the late Guinean president Sekou 
Touré to make his country officially multilingual 
was a total failure. 
“Language war”: 
a convenient metaphor 
A language policy can only work if it is attu- 
ned to the way in which a society is evolving.Only 
rarely can a language or reform be imposed on 
people against their will. Is it possible to defend 
(or save) a language whose speakers don’t want it 
any more? The issue is not the language itself but 
the importance attached to it by its speakers. A 
language policy cannot ignore them. 
A language disappears not only because it is 
dominated by another, but also—and perhaps 
above all—because people decide to abandon it 
and do not pass it on to their children.The term 
“language war” is a convenient metaphor, but 
languages themselves cannot wage war on each 
other. It is people who struggle, fight or agree 
with each other. We can follow their conflictual 
relationships by looking at the relationship bet- 
ween their languages. 
Linguists are always sorry when a language dies 
out, but languages are not museum pieces. They 
belong to the people who speak them and constantly 
change and adapt to their needs. They are there to 
serve people and not vice-versa. T he evolution of 
language forms and the relationships between them 
is an ongoing process, and while some die, others 
are born, sometimes before our eyes. 
Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the 
break-up of Yugoslavia, new countries have 
appeared and new languages are making them- 
selves heard—Bosnian,Serbian, and Croatian, for 
example, which until recently were considered to 
be a single language, Serbo-Croat. The speakers 
of these languages are affirming their identity by 
stressing and increasing the difference between 
them, though this only amounts to a few dozen 
words. Likewise, the division of Czechoslovakia »

» into the Czech Republic and Slovakia has pushed 
the Czech and Slovak languages further apart. 
In francophone Africa, local forms of the offi- 
cial language, French, are emerging. Slightly dif- 
ferent variants of French are spoken in Senegal, 
Gabon, Niger and Cote d’ Ivoire. 
T hese differences, slight though they are so far, 
perhaps herald a break-up of French, which may 
become a kind of mother tongue for a new genera- 
tion of speakers, just as Latin is the mother of the 
Romance languages. T he same goes for English, Ara- 
bic and Spanish. The Spanish spoken in Madrid is 
not quite the same as that spoken in Buenos Aires, 
and there are differences between London English 
and Bombay English. The Arabic of Rabat isnot at all 
the same as that spoken in Riyadh. 
The function of languages influences their 
form. The languages used for trade in the markets 
of African capitals are gradually becoming different 
from their vernacular forms. The Wolof spoken in 
Dakar is no longer the Wolof that rural people 
speak, and the Bambara heard in Bamako is not 
the same as that spoken in Ségou, 230 kilometres 
away. 
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
in various situations, Creole languages developed 
as a linguistic solution to the communication pro- 
blem faced by slaves speaking different languages 
when they were taken to the 
Indian Ocean islands or to the 
Caribbean. Using European 
tongues such as English, 
French or Portuguese as a 
basis, they created languages

which today are different. A Mauritian, a Haitian 
and a Guyanese cannot understand each other, 
even though their languages have a common 
ancestor—French. Perhaps the children of immi- 
grants will one day speak, along with the langua- 
ge of their host country, a Germanicized version 
of Turkish, say, or a Frenchified Arabic. 
An ever-changing 
language map 
English may not escape this process. Its world 
domination today is indisputable and will proba- 
bly last for a while. But history shows that the 
more a language spreads geographically, the more 
variations it generates,so what happened to Latin 
may happen to English. 
This being the case, the world language map is 
clearly going to change over the next few centuries. 
Many languages currently spoken by only a few 
people are dying out and new ones are appearing 
or will appear. This means that in the gravitational 
model described above, languages and their func- 
tions will evolve. The hypercentral and supercen- 
tral languages may change, and some peripheral 
languages may become central (and vice-versa). 
Like history itself, the history of languages does 
not stand still. It moves on, constantly changing 
and being shaped by the practices of users. |

DNA 
IN THE DOCK 
  
DP Martine Jacot 
ETHICS 
Genetic fingerprinting provides virtually flawless proof and is helping to identify criminals and 
free people jailed for crimes they did not commit. But does it violate basic human rights? 
all agree that the arrival of genetic tes- 
ting in their daily lives is a far more 
revolutionary development than the intro- 
duction of fingerprinting at the end of the 
19th century. It is now just about impossible 
to say a criminal has “disappeared without 
leaving any trace,” even if he or she wore 
gloves. 
Forensic science has made a great leap 
forward since 1985,when British scientist 
Alex Jeffreys discovered a new way of 
identifying people genetically through 
their DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the 
molecule at the core of each living cell. It 
is now possible to draw up a person’s 
genetic identity card within five or six 
hours at minimal cost! working from infi- 
nitesimal pieces of evidence, such as a 
minute speck of blood, a single hair, a 
trace of saliva left on a cigarette butt, a 
stamp, a glass or a toothbrush,from sweat 
on clothing or, more important, a tiny 
drop of a rapist’s sperm. However despite 
this “proof”, we should remember that 
just because a person’s “traces” have been 
found at the scene of a crime, it does not 
necessarily mean they are guilty.

Except in the case of identical twins, 
the structure of a person’s DNA is 
unique. About 10 per cent of DNA 
contains chromosomes. The rest of it, 
whose purpose is unknown, is “non- 
coding” DNA which provides no infor- 
mation about health or genetic abnorma-

lities, at least not yet, and is partly made 
up of identical sequences. It is these 
“repeat units”’that are analysed to compi- 
le a person’s genetic profile, which takes 
the form of a series of figures. These data 
are like bar codes which can be easily sto- 
red as a computer file. This is a positive 
development, say many Western crimino - 
logists and the families of crime victims. 
Defenders of civil liberties who predict 
new Orwellian nightmares, beg to differ. 
An Afro-American called A.B. Butler 
is one of those whose life was saved by 
DNA testing. He was freed in January 
1999 after 16 years in prison in Tyler, 
Texas, and his 99-year jail sentence for 
kidnapping and raping a young white 
woman in 1983 was quashed. As soon as 
he heard about DNA tests, he asked to be 
given one, knowing that the police had 
kept a sample of the rapist’s sperm. Three 
laboratories confirmed that his genetic 
fingerprint was not that of the rapist. 
Since the FBI began testing people’s 
DNA in 1989, at least 54 prisoners serving 
long sentences, mostly for rape, have been 
declared innocent in the United States. The 
defence of 35 of them was handled by the 
law school at New York's Yeshiva University 
as part of the Innocence Project (IP) laun- 
ched in 1992 by Prof. Barry Scheck. The 
project’s goal is to make DNA tests routine 
when evidence has been kept in the case of 
prisoners who claim to be innocent but 
cannot afford a good lawyer. The stakes are 
high. Six of the prisoners freed by the 
efforts of the students and teachers involved 
in the project were on death row. 
Building databases 
“Genetic testing can also help find the 
real criminal more quickly,” says Scheck. “It 
can help solve old crimes that have puzzled 
everyone and save a tremendous amount of 
time and money in an investigation. It can 
also help curb serial killers or compulsive 
rapists,” who could be identified before they 
commit more crimes. Such “advances” pre- »

ETHICS 
suppose the existence of ways to compare 
the genetic profile of someone being sought 
and the profile of a suspect. This means 
building a database of genetic fingerprints. 
In the absence of such databases, police in 
the Western world investigating serious 
crimes proceed by trial and error,analysing 
DNA from entire villages and neighbou- 
rhoods. 
Police in Britain,who were pioneers in 
the field, created such a database in 1995 
“backed by women’s groups who suppor- 
ted technology that could identify rapists 
quickly,” says Peter Martin,a former chief 
of Scotland Yard’s laboratories. “When it 
was then found that rapists often already 
had a record of petty crime,” the databa- 
se was expanded. 
An identikit picture 
from a piece of chewing gum 
In Britain, anyone arrested or suspec- 
ted of a crime can be asked to provide a 
saliva sample to compile their DN A iden- 
tity card. The database currently has the 
“bar codes” of about 700,000 people, and 
in 10 years time five million of the coun- 
try’s 58.6 million people are expected to be 
in it. In five years, the database has enabled 
thousands of matches or “cold hits” to be 
made that Martin says have led to the 
identification of more than 260 murderers, 
400 rapists and 2,500 burglars. 
Police everywhere are naturally keen 
to gather all the information they can. 
Some are now dreaming of being able to 
make an identikit picture of a criminal 
just from a piece of chewing gum found 
near the scene of the crime. Current ana- 
lysis done on non-coding DNA by the 
PCR3 method enables the sex of a person 
to be determined but not the age or 
colour of hair or eyes. But it will be pos- 
sible in the future, scientists say. Some 
human rights defence organizations say 
such cataloguing must stop immediately 
and deplore the inadequacy of safeguards 
to protect individual liberties. 
The fiercest debate about this issue is 
raging in the United States around the 
FBI's launch in October 1998 of a national 
database, Codis, which combines biologi- 
cal and computer processes to link up 
databases in each of the 50 U.S. states. The 
FBI says it has 260,000 files on people that 
3. Polymerase Chain Reaction, or genetic 
amplification, which became routine in the late 
1980s,is the fastest, cheapest and most accurate 
method. It requires less DNA than the earlier 
RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length 
Polymorphism) method, which is no longer used 
in Western countries. It is now possible,by 
looking at a specific marker on sex chromosomes, 
to identify a person’s sex by PCR. 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - April 2000 
have already helped pinpoint the authors 
of more than 200 crimes, though so far 
only sex offences and violent crimes. 
Resistance to the compilation of such 
databases has focused on one key ques- 
tion. Should a sample for a DNA test be 
taken from someone without their per- 
mission? The law in Western countries is 
not always clear on this but the principle 
has been accepted—in Germany, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, France 
and the U.S.—that a sample of blood or 
saliva can be taken on the orders of a 
judge or a police officer in the course of

an investigation. 
But the line between police require- 
ments and individual liberties is still a very 
hazy one. “When there’s an investigation 
among the inhabitants of a village after a 
crime, sample-taking should be voluntary,” 
says Jean Michaud, a member of the 
French National Ethics Committee, “yet a 
refusal (to allow a DNA test) can be inter- 
preted as grounds for suspicion.” 
Many police admit however that a per- 
son’s DNA can always be analysed from 
their confiscated toothbrush or their coffee 
cup without them knowing, which does 
not directly violate their “physical person” 
or their “human dignity”, concepts reco- 
gnized in laws on bioethics that have been 
passed in many Western countries. Such 
“unfair methods” are clearly condemned 
in theory but not explicitly by law. 
Constitutional protection 
In the United States, the Massachusetts 
state legislature passed a law in 1997 allo- 
wing the archiving of data on convicted cri- 
minals with retroactive effect. All prison 
inmates in the state were therefore “asked” 
to give a blood sample, ostensibly for the 
“statistical” reason that many prisoners 
commit new crimes after their release.But 
some refused, citing—on the advice of their 
lawyers—the fourth amendment to the 
U.S. constitution which protects citizens 
against “unreasonable searches and sei- 
zures”.A Boston court set a precedent in 
August 1998 by ruling in their favour and 
giving the opinion that taking DNA 
samples without permission was a clear vio- 
lation of human rights. 
“Why don’t we make a database of all 
poor people?’ asked one of the prisoners’ 
lawyers, Benjamin Keehn. “Are they also 
more likely to commit crimes? Where do 
you stop?’ The protest against such 
moves, which has spread to other states,is 
organized by the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) Freedom Network, which 
has 250,000 members. The ACLU appea- 
led before the National Commission on 
the Future of DNA Evidence, a 19-mem- 
ber body of distinguished experts set up 
at the request of President Bill Clinton, 
against the extension of the federal Codis 
system to any person who was arrested. 
ACLU’s associate director, Barry 
Steinhardt, said it would mean “equating 
arrest with guilt” and would give “police 
officers, rather than judges and juries, the 
power to force persons to provide the 
state with evidence that harbours many of 
their most intimate secrets and those of 
A GENETIC 
DATABASE 
FOR EUROPES 
POLICE 
In 1997, the European Union Council of Minis- 
ters® “invited member states to consider esta- 
blishing national DNA databases’ and “exchange 
DNA analysis results” as a way of making “a 
significant contribution” to criminal investiga- 
tions, provided it was “limited to exchanging 
data from the non-coding part of the DNA mole- 
cule, which can be assumed not to contain infor- 
mation about specific hereditary qualities. 
“It is up to each member state,” the Council 
said, “to decide on the conditions under which, 
and the offences regarding which, the DNA ana- 
lysis results may be stored in a national database. 
The taking of DNA material for the purpose of sto- 
ring DNA analysis results should be subject to 
safeguards designed to protect the physical inte- 
grity of the person concerned.” 
It added that “creation of a European DNA 
database should be considered as a second step 
once the conditions for the exchange of the DNA 
analysis results are realized.” [|

their blood relatives.” 
Another set of vital questions arises 
from this debate. Who owns the DNA 
used to establish a person’s genetic ID— 
the person concerned, the laboratory 
which did the test, or the police? Should 
the sample be destroyed or kept, and if 
kept, for how long? The “bar codes” in the 
files may for the moment be of little use to 
snoopers, but the “original” DNA 
samples contain chromosomes and there- 
fore a mass of genetic information about 
the person and their relatives,since the 23 
pairs of chromosomes we all have are pas- 
sed down half and half from each of our 
parents. 
Who can guarantee that the DNA 
samples held in the police databases and 
laboratories will not one day be analysed 
by nosy people working for, say, life 
insurance companies to find out if someo- 
ne is likely to develop this or that disease? 
Germany, Austria, Finland, Sweden, 
Denmark and the Netherlands have all 
removed this risk by ordering the destruc- 
tion of the samples once the ID has been 
established. Other countries allow police 
and labs to keep them—forever in Britain, 
for 40 years in France’s planned database 
and for various periods in different U.S. 
states. The excuse is usually that the 
sample might need to be examined again 
in the future. 
A Pandora’s box 
Especially in the last group of coun- 
tries, non-governmental organizations 
and ethics committees have criticized 
  
ETHICS 
the growth of “small genetic databases” 
collected by laboratories with government 
authorization and by private firms acting 
in accordance with the law. 
Steinhardt points to a survey carried 
out by the American Management 
Association which found that six per cent 
of employers were already using genetic 
tests as part of job-hiring procedures 
without the knowledge of the candidates. 
The Pentagon, he told the U.S. commis- 
sion,currently has samples from three mil- 
lion of its present and former employees in

fy soldiers killed in the Viet Nam War. 
“Once the genetic information is col- 
lected and banked, pressures will mount 
to use it for other purposes than those for 
which it was gathered,” he said. “In fact, 
on several occasions, the FBI has already 
requested access to this data for purposes 
of criminal investigations.” 
Prof. Philip Reilly, a member of the 
commission, agrees. “There is a prolifera- 
tion of databases with DNA in all sorts of 
areas in our society which theoretically 
could be linked one way or another.” He 
also notes that “we already collected in 
1999 blood from 99.8 per cent of the 
babies born in the United States and we 
are storing it without their consent. We also 
subject it to DNA analysis in some cases.” 
The U.S. commission finally recom- 
mended that details of the 15 million 
people arrested in the U.S. every year not 
be archived at federal level. ACLU says it 
will fight the establishment of any genetic 
database, which it regards as a Pandora’s 
box. It is also contesting in court a recent 
Massachusetts law which authorizes dis- 
closure of details from the police genetic 
database for undefined “humanitarian 
purposes”.

### 119492: African museums on a meet-the-people mission

AFRICAN MUSEUMS ON A 
MEET-THE-PEOPLE MISSION 
  
DP Cynthia Guttman 
Plagued by low visitor attendance, African museums are breaking out 
of their rigid colonial moulds and courting local communities 
Since he started teaching aspiring 
curators in the early 1980s, Emmanuel 
Nnakenyi Arinze has advocated a 
hands-on approach that even comes with a 
dress code. “I tell my students that ‘the 
African curator does not come to work in a 
tie because you are going to be working 
with your hands, on objects that are dirty, 
in storage, in galleries or outside, or with 
children who will pour ink over you.” 
It’s a small detail that nonetheless points 
towards deeper currents of change running 
through African museums as curators and 
their colleagues seek to define a model that 
makes sense for Africans today. T he process, 
initiated in piecemeal fashion in the 1980s, 
received a galvanizing thrust forward after 
Mali’s Alpha Oumar Konaré, the first Afri- 
can to preside the International Council of 
Museums, sounded the alarm by declaring 
in 1991 that “it is time, high time . . . to kill 
the Western model of museum in Africa.” 
A crisis had been brewing for years. 
Besides acute cutbacks in financing and trai- 
ning, excessive bureaucracy and political 
D Unesco Courier journalist 
interference in museum leadership, the most 
glaring sign of trouble was simply that Afri- 
can people, just about everywhere, were 
shunning their museums. In many cases, 
they were discarded as “places for tourists 
or museums for whites” as Alexis Adandé, 
director of the West African Museums Pro- 
gramme puts it. 
All museums, even those founded after 
independence, were forced to address the cri- 
sis. Across the continent, directors have star- 
ted to shake up their institutions, develop 
more outward-looking attitudes and tune into 
the lives and concerns of local people. This 
starts with a novel approach to exhibitions 
that involves consulting communities from 
the outset—not only to spark their interest, 
but also because they own objects deemed of 
higher symbolic value in their eyes than those 
gathering dust in museum showcases. 
In Bulawayo (Zimbabwe), the local 
community was asked to bring in old pho- 
tographs for display in the local art gallery. 
“The exhibition proved very popular as it 
rekindled past memories of people’s life- 
styles,” recalls Francis Musonda, chairman 
of SADCAMM, an association which

groups museums from the southern Africa 
region. 
In an experimental-style exhibition in 
Ouidah (Benin) in 1985, families were 
encouraged to display objects relating to local 
festivals and family heritage. T he exhibit, sta- 
ged with artifactsranging from portraits and 
masks to statuettes representing female divi- 
nities—which until then had been passed 
down within the same families for several 
generations—was warmly greeted by the 
population who for the most part were vie- 
wing these precious pieces for the first time. 
It created such interest that a small family 
museum was eventually opened in the city. 
Appealing to an elite 
In Nigeria, Arinze, who has held a num- 
ber of prominent positions in the field of 
museum development, organized a crowd- 
drawing exhibition on drums, during which 
musicians from selected villages were invited 
to a city museum to share their know-how 
and traditions with visitors. “People in our 
communities must be part of the process of 
exhibiting objects that come from them. We 
should give them a chance to talk to us about 
those objects and how they want to see them 
shown to a wider audience,” he says. “When 
an object is put here in isolation from its true 
meaning, communities feel distanced from 
it and slightly offended.” 
All these types of initiatives enhance com- 
munities pride in their heritage and stimulate 
awareness about the value of safeguarding 
objects, while often shedding new light on 
local history. They break the Western stereo- 
type of a museum as a place where people 
come to look at objects on display. With some 
rare exceptions—such as Niamey’s “arts and 
crafts” style concept with architectural 
models linked to the country’s ethnic groups, 
parks explaining the country’s fauna and 
flora, and pavilions presenting different dress 
styles and customs—African museums were 
created to satisfy the curiosity of an elite, 
almost to the total exclusion of the locals. 
Despite post-independence efforts to make 
them vehicles for encouraging nationalism

and fostering unity, the fact remains that col- 
lections were constituted by foreign powers, 
and mostly for their interest alone. 
“The great problem for ethnographic- 
style museums is to think about new ways of 
using objects which for the most part have 
‘died’,” explains Adandé, referring to the intri- 
cate ‘living’relationship between an object, 
such as a mask, and the role it plays in a given 
cultural context. In the case of the palace- 
museum in Abomey (Benin), artifacts belon- 
ging to rulers of the former 17th-century king- 
dom are brought out during ritual ceremonies 
linked to the cult of ancestors. These objects 
are “charged” to regain their sacred power, 
and at the end of the ceremony rendered 
inanimate, since a fully charged object can- 
not be left on show for viewing by the average 
visitor. But this type of initiative is not feasible 
when objects have been collected in one part 
of the country for display in another. 
But museum directors are still faced 
with the question of bringing meaning back 
into collections constituted during colonial 
times. “Should these objects be returned to 
populations to create local museums or be 
used for educational purposes, especially 
for youth from cities?’ asks Adandé. 
Shaje’aT shiluila, president of AFRICOM, 
a pan-African organization of museums, insists 
that the continent’s museums have a critical 
role to play in valorizing traditional knowledge 
that can serve Africa’s development. “If the 
definition of a museum is to collect, preser ve 
and transmit, this can be applied to a very 
broad range of concerns, from learning about 
different styles of conflict resolution to iden- 
tifying the health practices of different ethnic 
groups,” she affirms. 
Reaching a youthful audience 
Pointing to conflicts that have torn so 
many African countries apart in the past 
decade, Tshiluila insists on the potential of 
museums to bring about greater understan- 
ding between ethnic groups. In this regard, 
Tanzania’s Village Museum hasdrawn atten- 
tion well beyond its borders. In 1994, the 
museum launched an annual event during 
which one or two ethnic groups (out of about 
140) show their culture to others. T hey build 
or rehabilitate traditional houses, explain to 
visitors the purpose of various cultural arti- 
facts used, organize seminars about their his- 
tory and culture, and share food and music. 
Because they are involved in the event from its 
inception, communities are given the chance 
to reflect upon what they value most about 
their heritage, and to find the most stimula- 
ting ways of presenting it to others. 
The idea of getting messages across can 
extend to a broad range of concerns, from 
health or agriculture techniques to urbaniza- 
tion. In Swaziland for example, curator 
Rosemary Andrade has opened up the doors 
of the national museum to exhibitions on 
HIV-Aids prevention, in partnership with 
local NGOs. On another occasion, noticing 
the talents of Mozambican refugees at recy- 
cling materials, she staged an exhibition 
showcasing their skills, to promote greater 
tolerance between these recent arrivals and 
the locals. 
It could be argued that every exhibition is 
an educational endeavour, but if there is one 
audience that museums feel they have to 
reach, it is children and youth. “Museums 
and heritage sites provide an education 
resource that has been devastatingly unde- 
rutilized by teachers,education departments, 
universities, NGOs and museums them- 
selves,” says Dammon Rice, head of the 
Museum Ambassador Programme in South 
Africa. This initiative trains young people to 
teach their peers about museums in the Cape 
Town area by giving presentations in schools 
and running museum tours. 
A number of other museums now orga- 
nize workshops for teachers, who are encou- 
raged to link issues in the curriculum with col- 
lections in the museum. In Benin, the national 
heritage school runs training aimed at increa- 
sing the ability of museum educators across 
the continent to design programmes for 
schools and local communities.

created after independence, was among the 
first to realize that its prime role was educa- 
tional. “Even though we started from scratch 
when we built our own museum, we realized 
that we could be doing much more to let 
people know that we existed. And we wanted 
to catch people at an early age, in primary 
school,” explains the museum’s director T'ic- 
key Pule. 
In one of the longest running outreach pro- 
grammes in Africa,known as the Zebra on 
Wheels, staff from the national museum set 
out once a term with a van filled with artifacts 
to organize daylong exhibits in rural schools, 
along with talks and slideshows and movies 
on the country’s environment and cultural 
heritage. Besides bringing the museum to the 
village, the programme exposes children to 
crafts and customs from different parts of Bots- 
wana, fostering a sense of national pride. 
Encouraging children to take pride in 
their heritage is an investment that curators 
know has long-term payoffs. In Zimbabwe, 
a programme involving school students aims 
to limit vandalism around archaeological 
sites. In T sodiolo, Botswana, on a site where 
there are over 1,000 rock paintings locals are 
involved in the opening of a museum and 
are being trained as guides. They are also 
sharing with museum professionals their 
knowledge of this ancient site, which is up 
for world heritage status nomination. 
A museum without walls 
This process however, has to be nurtured, 
especially when it comes to turning sites into 
cultural attractions. “It takes a lot of time to 
strike up a dialogue with communities, espe- 
cially rural ones. In fact, it’s always what people 
don’t say that is important,” says Malagasy 
museum director and archaeologist Jean-Aimé 
Rakotoarisoa. For the past several years,he 
has been working with villagers on a 14th- 
century fortified site that is still considered 
sacred. His aim: to create a “museum without 
walls or collections”—an itinerary around the

and an adjacent “sacred” forest harbouring 
rare plant species that have remained untou- 
ched for centuries. He would like to see chil- 
dren from the city visit the site as part of their 
school programme, be guided through it by 
the villagers and encourage the revival of lost 
craft techniques. 
Given the number of venerated cultural 
and historical sites around the island—and 
throughout Africa—there is potential for this 
kind of approach to flourish,provided com- 
munities feel they have a hold on the pro- 
cess.“ All too often this type of operation dies 
off within six months because an outsider turns 
up with the money, and when it runs out, the 
project dies.” Rakotoarisoa cautions against 
making calculations based largely on the eco- 
nomic viability of such projects, expressing

In Namibia, high schools have become key actors in documenting scientific collections 
first on the continent to leap into the 
Internet age: visitors can walk through 
a virtual collection of rock art, search an 
online database of collections or find out 
about ongoing programmes. Even more 
engaging are efforts to hook up the coun- 
try’s schools to the Net and heighten envi- 
ronmental awareness, via an annual contest 
held for the first time in 1999. 
The rule: students give the museum a 
helping hand by computerizing hand writ- 
ten data on its insect collection, the fifth 
largest in Africa. In return, their schools 
win computers and Internet access.“We 
have over 1.5 million insects in our ento- 
mology collection, 70,000 handwritten 
insect catalogue records, and the usual 
excuses—no staff, no money and no tech- 
nical resources,” says the museum’s Joris 
Komen, the driving force behind the pro- 
ject. Museums in developing countries 
often have problems obtaining data on their 
biodiversity because many insect specimens 
are kept in foreign museums, and most

records are still handwritten. “Instead of 
going along the tried and failed path of see- 
king foreign donor support to fill our third- 
world museum with foreign consultants, 
expertise and resources, we took it upon 
ourselves to motivate our local corporate 
community to support us indirectly by 
giving them a chance to be socially respon- 
sible,” continues Komen. 
A ripple effect 
In less than a year, organizers of the 
contest raised some $200,000 in computer 
equipment,services,media,ad vertising and 
prizes, mostly from the private sector. A team 
of supporters and volunteers—many from 
technical colleges—reconfigured the dona- 
ted computers for the schools involved. T he 
Insect @thon 1999 contest involved 92 stu- 
dents from 16 schools throughout Namibia, 
including one for children with learning disa- 
bilities. Transport was organized to a techno- 
logy training centre in Windhoek, and in just 
two days, the students, aged between 11 and 
19, had computerized 20,897 insect inven- 
tory records using an innovative child- 
friendly capture screen designed by the 
museum on which they had to fill in eleven 
different data fields. Despite minimal tech- 
nical skills, students scored a remarkably low 
13 per cent error margin. Participants recei- 
ved a string of prizes, from books and cd- 
roms to radio cassette players. 
The contest has had a ripple effect and 
led to the launch of SchoolNet Namibia, a 
network among schools, telecommunications 
and electricity service providers, the business 
community and other stakeholders to pro- 
mote Internet development. At present, only 
28 per cent of Namibia’s 1,600 schools have 
a telephone connection, and only a handful 
are online. Money allowing, the museum 
intends to take the model to Zimbabwe and 
Zambia. Meanwhile, the contest’s winning 
team, which entered the highest number of 
records, will visit Sweden in May 2000 for 
two weeks—to computerize handwritten 
Namibian insect records held by several 
museums there. [|

    CONNEXIONS 
MEDIA SELF-CONTROL, 
THE SOUTHS NEW OPTION 
  
D Jean Huteau 
As part of a growing trend in the developing world, press councils are encouraging 
responsible journalism and press freedom 
independence have become new 
watchwords for media in developing 
countries. Regimes that had been authori- 
tarian, in some cases since independence, 
have genuinely committed themselves to 
freedom of the press. Constitutions and 
laws have been amended, codes of 
conduct drawn up and press councils 
established. 
But these developments have not 
taken place everywhere, and their results 
have not always been conclusive. 
However, a number of countries have 
managed in the last few years to create a 
free press in extremely difficult circum- 
stances and set up a model self-regulato- 
ry structure. One of them is South Africa 
(see box opposite page). 
The symbolic date of change was 
November 9 1989, when the Berlin Wall 
came down. In central and eastern 
Europe, the explosion of press freedom 
was such that in some countries journa- 
lists had to pick up the job as they went 
along because there were not enough pro- 
fessionals to teach them. 
Since the early 1990s, pluralism and 
An explosion 
of press freedom 
But the shock wave rolled beyond the 
borders of the former Warsaw Pact coun - 
tries. Developing countries in Africa and 
Asia under one-party rule underwent a 
similar transformation, triggering the 
same kind of media explosion, albeit in a 
range of different situations. 
The context in Africa is one of civil 
wars, international conflicts and even 
genocide, for which some media, such as 
the notorious “hate radios”, bear direct 
and crushing responsibility. In Rwanda 
and Burundi, virtually all the media are 
under government control. Fighting is

still going on in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, where 84 journalists have 
been imprisoned, media outlets have been 
taken over or shut down, newspapers bur- 
ned and their offices looted. 
Africa, Asia and Latin America have 
also seen countless unwarranted libel 
actions, censorship, harassment, arrests 
and killings of journalists. Over the last 10 
years, 58 journalists have been murdered 
in Algeria and 44 in Colombia. Ethiopia 
has jailed more journalists than almost 
any other country in the world. 
But this tragic decade also saw encou- 
raging changes. UNESCO helped to point 
the way forward in 1988 when it produced 
a new communications strategy based on 
independence and pluralism. The collapse 
of the Soviet bloc deprived developing 
countries of a point of reference and bac- 
king. Since independence, many of these 
countries had adopted the model of the 
one-party state, which was seen as the only 
way to generate the energy needed to tack- 
le economic backwardness. 
The 1990 summit of French-speaking 
states at La Baule, in France, called on 
the countries of francophone Africa to 
introduce more democracy. The English- 
speaking states of the Commonwealth, 
meeting in Harare (Zimbabwe), the follo- 
wing year, followed suit and resolved to 
expel countries which did not comply.

This was what happened to Nigeria, 
Africa’s biggest country, then under mili- 
tary rule. 
In May 1991, the Windhoek 
Declaration, drawn up after a UNESCO 
seminar and later approved by UNESCO’s 
Executive Board, said that an “indepen- 
dent, pluralistic and free press” was vital 
for “democracy and economic develop- 
ment”. The death knell had sounded for 
the notion of the media controlled by a 
one-party state to promote national deve- 
lopment. Similar declarations were made »

rences in Alma Ata (Kazakhstan), 
Santiago (Chile), Sana’a (Yemen) and 
Sofia (Bulgaria). 
Laws and constitutions were amended 
in Benin and Mozambique in 1990, 
Burkina Faso (1991), Madagascar, 
Ghana and Kenya (1992), Nigeria 
(1993), Cameroon and post-apartheid 
South Africa (1996) and Thailand 
(1997). In Cameroon, public pressure 
forced the government to enact press 
freedom measures in 1991 as a prelude to 
free elections and the abolition of censor - 
ship the following year. 
Watchdogs against 
bias and inaccuracy 
In countries that are sometimes having 
their first taste of freedom, excesses and 
errors seem almost inevitable, including 
press violations of privacy, libel and 
calumny, outrageous behaviour and 
unwarranted intrusion. Some new jour- 
nalists lack experience and training. The 
issue of responsibility, which no free 
media outlet can dodge, soon arises. 
Cote d’Ivoire, which had been marked 
since independence in 1960 by censor- 
ship and self-censorship, is a good 
example. T he explosion of freedom spaw- 
ned about 80 political parties and a hun- 
dred or so newspapers and other publica- 
tions. Two years later, only a dozen of the 
40 daily papers were still appearing and 
the government-controlled press had the 
upper hand. But the media had become a 
forum for debate. 
After the media explosion, the press 
was criticized for “lack of training and 
professional responsibility, triviality, ill

he media regulation and self-regulation mecha- 
Tome in South Africa consist of: 
® Apressombudsman and an appeal panel set 
up in 1997 by journalists and publishers’ associa- 
tions. The panel is composed of publishers, jour- 
nalists, and members of the public, who are in the 
majority. Itis funded by the newspaper publishers 
association (www.inc.co.za/online/ombudsman). Its 
power is limited to publishing reprimands and cor- 
rections which the ombudsman or the panel 
consider necessary. Complaints against the press 
are lodged by private individuals or institutions 
first with the ombudsman, who will try to settle the 
matter. If this fails, the complaint becomes a formal 
one. The complainant can appeal against the 
ombudsman’s decisions to the appeal panel. At 
each stage, discussions between the conflicting 
parties are held. 
® The Broadcasting Monitoring and Complaints 
Committee (BMCC), made up of four members 
from the legal profession and the media and chaired 
by a working or retired judge. The committee reports   
to the Independent Broadcasting Authority, an audio- 
visual regulatory body set up by law in 1993. The law 
which created the authority provides for rectifications 
(broadcast on radio and TV), publication paid for by 
the guilty party, injunctions, fines and temporary 
or permanent suspension of broadcasting licences. 
The committee examines violations of the codes of 
conduct for news and advertising which are part of 
the law and also violations of the terms of the licence- 
holders’ contracts. 
® The Advertising Standards Authority, which 
monitors advertising and complaints about it. 
® The Broadcasting Complaints Commission 
(BOCSA), setup in 1993 by the National Broadcasters’ 
Association, isan independent regulatory body grou- 
ping private and community radio stations, aswell as

will, over-zealousness, ignorance and 
political and religious pressure.” The 
press mixed politics with intrusion into 
private life, sometimes descending into 
the gutter. This led to a vicious circle whe- 
reby the authorities used media excesses 
as a pretext to strike at the newly-free 
media by arresting and jailing journalists. 
Many private individuals sued the press. 
Cote d’Ivoire’s government and jour- 
nalists’ trade unions decided to interve- 
ne in September 1995 by drawing up a 
code of conduct and establishing a press 
council modelled on those in Germany 
and Quebec; one half of the members 
are publishers, the other half journalists. 
This gave birth to the Press Freedom

and Professional Ethics Monitor 
(OLPED). On World Press Freedom 
Day in 1999, the World Association of 
Newspapers and the French-based non- 
governmental organization Reporters 
Sans Frontieres noted that there were 
“genuinely independent” press organs in 
Cote d’Ivoire and that journalists could 
work safely. 
Adopting a code of conduct and set- 
ting up an independent press council to 
monitor its application and hear com- 
plaints from the public are the first two 
self-regulatory measures taken in develo- 
ping countries to head off government 
intervention and regulation which would 
bring unforeseeable restrictions. In the 
developing world, mechanisms of this 
kind also educate the public and promote 
press freedom. 
A trend is now underway. Press coun- 
cils were set up in South Korea, India, 
Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and 
Indonesia in the years after 1960. In the 
1990s, a dozen more appeared—in the 
Philippines and Mozambique in 1991, 
Ghana (1992), Nigeria (1992 ; revived in 
1999), Fiji (1993), Cote d’Ivoire (1994), 
Senegal (1996), and Peru, Thailand, 
South Africa and Tanzania (1997).

be criticized on the grounds that half the 
members were government representa- 
tives and the other half journalists—it was 
an unprecedented step towards freedom 
of expression in the Arab world. When the 
country got caught up in a spiral of 
repression in 1994, the council was dis- 
solved. Nigeria’s press council was a 
casualty of dictatorship but was revived 
after free elections in 1999. 
When Morocco began political 
reform, a journalistic code of conduct was 
adopted and there were calls for a press 
council. But the most liberal example of 
self-regulation is South Africa, which set 
up a system in 1997 (see box) clearly 
based on the Swedish model, the oldest 
and one of the most respected in Europe. 
In Asia, a seminar organized in 1996 
by the Asian Media Information and 
Communication Centre (AMIC) in 
Singapore and Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn 
University revealed that in most Asian 
countries press councils were not protec- 
ting the local media against attacks on 
press freedom or offering ordinary citi- 
zens the means to counter abuses by the 
media. Since then, however, AMIC has 
offered many courses and written mate- 
rial about laws and self-regulation mecha- 
nisms. A press council has been set up in 
Thailand and Indonesia’s press law was 
recently amended. A big effort is also 
being made in this area by the Asia Press 
Foundation, which includes 15 or so 
media institutes in the region. 
The need for codes of conduct is 
bound to increase with the world media 
boom. However wide the North-South 
gap may be, nothing suggests that the 
  
  
  
growth of the media in developing coun- 
tries—though too slow and inadequate— 
1s going to stop. Despite often tragic obs- 
tacles, wars and economic inequality, 
media expansion will continue, even in 
developing countries. In two big demo- 
cracies, Brazil and India, the circulation 
of the daily press grew by 24 per cent and 
47 per cent respectively between 1993 
and 1997. Such advances involve setting 
up or strengthening regulatory and self- 
regulatory mechanisms. 
A framework 
for independence 
As soon as a national press achieves a 
significant level of organization and 
influence, the issue of its responsibility 
inevitably arises. Experience has shown 
that a press like South Africa’s, despite 
the country’s colonial past and history of 
discrimination, has inherited certain 
structures which were helpful when it 
came to devise a self-regulatory mecha- 
nism. It was the same in India where, 
taking a cue from the British press, the 
media played an important part in the 
achievement of national independence. 
Pakistan, which turned away from such 
structures, has had a lot more difficulty 
establishing an independent press. 
In developing countries where struc- 
tures of this kind exist, journalism has a 
promising future. A framework for inde- 
pendence and pluralism has now been 
defined. While it would be a mistake to 
ignore the fact that great obstacles lie 
ahead, the encouraging progress made so 
far must be welcomed. |

ENKI BILAL: 
A JOURNEY TO THE END 
OF TIME 
In comics, books and movies, a Yugoslav-born French artist visits the future to put the past 
in perspective and wields humour as a weapon against horror 
Memory is a recurrent theme in your work 
and the leitmotif of your latest book, co- 
written with the French novelist Dan Franck. 
Its title is Un siecle d’amour—a century of 
love—but it’s really about a century of terror. 
The creative process is based on 
memory. Artists are a compound of 
memory and sensibility. How could they 
talk about humanity and the world 
without delving into history and drawing 
on memory—their own and the memory 
of society and of nature? Memory can be 
more or less prominent in an artist’s 
work. But even when it’s scarcely percep - 
tible, it’s always the raw material of art. 
How do you differentiate between history and 
memory? 
Let’s take the case of Un siecle 
d’amour. It isn’t a book about history, 
even though it starts in 1914, ends in 
1999 and moves from Guernica to the 
Holocaust, Hiroshima and events in 
Africa—fairly classic chapters of history. 
Each episode evokes the experiences of a 
woman caught up in the torment of war. 
Dan wrote the stories of these 13 wit- 
nesses, victims and heroines of our times. 
I painted their portraits. But the book is 
not very accurate historically. It starts in 
Sarajevo 1914 and ends in Saravejo 1999 
and not—as respect for chronology would 
have required—with events in Kosovo, 
decisive though these were for this book. 
Readers should see this as a deliberate act 
of infidelity to history rather than an 
attempt to misrepresent it. Sarajevo, a 
multi-ethnic, multicultural city sacrificed 
to horror, has come to symbolize the 
memory of this murderous century. 
In Le Sommeil du monstre (“The Sleeping 
Monster”), an animated film based on the war 
in Sarajevo that you wrote and drew, you 
flash forward to 2026 to observe today’s 
world. Why did you use this technique? 
It’s very odd, but when I depict a bru- 
tal scene, I feel deeply uneasy if I set it in 
the present. If I situate it 20 or 30 years 
later, however, I enjoy the creative process. 
The horrible pictures from Africa and 
Chechnya that you see everywhere in the 
media bring us information (I won’t get 
involved in the debate about its quality) in 
The Egyptian god Horus in the Paris metro in 2003.

real time. Such images come to us via two 
vehicles of reality, photography and repor- 
ting. They are part of a language that is 
quite different from the artists. 
So there is a feeling of personal unea- 
siness as well as a desire to step back from 
reality, to be disconnected from it. But 
this doesn’t keep me from returning to 
the real world. I visit the future to come 
back to the past and the present. 
These three dimensions of time often overlap 
in your books. The first scene in Le Sommeil 
du monstre, for example, takes place in an old 
New York yellow cab transformed into a flying 
machine. This kind of contemporary detail 
ensures that readers don’t feel totally 
immersed in a science fiction world. 
I don’t want them to be.What’s more, 
I find the term science fiction slightly irri- 
tating. I am against all kinds of labels, 
Religion can become very

develops into a sect 
mentality. All kinds of

codifications and classifications in litera- 
ture. I don’t think there’s a hard-and-fast 
boundary between the worlds of Jules 
Verne, George Orwell and H.P. Lovecraft 
and those of Baudelaire, Kafka and Poe. | 
think the boundaries between genres are 
fading away. More and more authors are 
weaving the future into their works, whe- 
ther they are writing novels or philosophy. 
That said, I have loved science fiction 
since I was a teenager. Science fiction 
enabled me to observe the world in its 
cosmic dimension, to have a global vision 
of the Earth which influences the ques- 
tions I ask about the existence of other life 
forms and about the human condition. 
What worries you most about today’s world? 
Without falling into the trap of “knee- 
jerk ecology”, I must say that I am afraid for 
our planet. It is becoming weaker all the 
time. I have a sense of terrible waste. We 
have taken too much out of the Earth, we 
have heedlessly consumed its resources and 
caused irreparable harm. 
Religious fundamentalism also alarms 
me.Imagine “T alibanism” on a world scale! 
It’s terrifying. Religion can become very 
dangerous, especially if it develops into a

Twenty years ago, when the world was divi- 
ded into two camps, everything was simple, 
almost simplistic. Our side was good, the 
other was evil. We knew where the enemy 
was. That’s the world we grew up in. We 
were shaped in its mould. Then, all of a sud- 
den,everything fell apart. The change was 
so swift and so abrupt that it took us una- 
wares. Our minds weren’t ready for it. The 
war in Yugoslavia proves the point. It was 
almost a nineteenth-century war. It was 
archaic. And “archaicists” are the ones who 
caused it.

An old yellow cab flies over New York in the year 2026. 
  
   
Nike, the main hero of Le Sommeil du 
monstre, battles the “Obscurantis Order”, 
a kind of sect headed by “three new, 
self-proclaimed charismatic leaders”. 
Is that a veiled allusion to 
the three leaders who brought 
about the break-up of Yugoslavia, 
Serbia’s Milosevic, Croatia's Tudjman and 
Bosnia’s Izetbegovic? 
The idea for the “Obscurantis Order” 
arose from fundamentalism, but readers 
are free to make their own interpretations. 
That’s the point of the book: everyone can 
make of it what they will. There’s nothing 
to stop people making a connection with 
the three war leaders you mentioned, who 
were fully tolerated and cynically accepted 
by Europe. Better things could have been 
done. Europe should have intervened as 
soon as the rise of nationalism began in 
1987. Not necessarily militarily—a carrot- 
and-stick approach could have been used 
by saying, “Hey, Europe is under construc- 
tion, don’t miss the boat.” At that time, 
Yugoslavia was better placed than any 
other East European country to join the 
European Union. 
How did you feel about the war that ravaged 
the country where you were born? 
It hit me like a smack in the face. I've 
lived in France since 1960, but I was born 
4 8 The Unesco Courier - April 2000 
in Belgrade. My father was from 
Herzegovina and my mother came from 
Czechoslovakia at the age of two. I spent 
the first nine years of my life in 
Yugoslavia. I was born a Yugoslav or, if 
you like, a “Yugoslovak”—that’s what I 
was called by Alain Resnais, the director 
of La vie est un roman, a film for which I 
designed the sets. 
I loved that country. Split, Dubrovnik, 
Sarajevo, Belgrade. I went back as soon as 
I could,even though it was to relive child- 
hood memories more than anything else. 
Then I was sucked into the terrible reali- 
ty of the war. But at the same time, I 
remained on the outside. A good thirty 
years had gone by since I left, I was an 
observer, above the fray, I didn’t take any 
strong positions. 
It was painful. I felt as if I was caught 
in the grip of this history, yet at the same 
time I tried to stay detached in order to 
understand what was going on. I'm not 
sure I succeeded. Some situations are 
irrational. I saw French intellectuals 
taking positions that sometimes seemed 
grotesque. I mistrusted these opinions, 
even if their basis was sound, even if they 
reflected a kind of generosity. 
In short, it was a very hard time, but 
obviously nowhere near as hard as it was 
for the people on the spot. I experienced 
and exorcised my anxiety in my own way, 
with Le Sommeil du monstre. 
The world of that comic book is sombre and 
dominated by cold colours. But humour keeps 
on breaking through, even at the most tragic 
moments. For example, you write, “A rocket 
slammed through a wing of the hospital, 
causing three casualties, including an innocent 
Sony television set that was switched off”. 
That is part of the inexplicable rela- 
tionship between the author and his work. 
I need humour, of course. It defuses cer- 
tain situations. It adds a light touch to 
stories that would otherwise be utterly 
turgid. 
On the opening page of La Foire aux 
immortels, you quote this passage from the 
writings of Choublanc, the Fascist governor of 
Paris in 2023: “Immortality is a form of 
dictatorship of life over death. As a dictator, 
and someone who is alive, all that’s left for 
me is to become immortal. And | will! Even if | 
die in the process!” 
That is a completely way-out comic 
book in which Egyptian gods play the 
game Monopoly in a flying pyramid that 
has run out of fuel and hovers over Paris. 
In it I describe the quest for immortality 
in its most ludicrous forms. Choublanc, 
who believes memory and history are

S— eC 
outdated concepts, will do anything in his 
power to achieve immortality. At the same 
time, Alcide Nikopol, a deserter launched 
into outer space in a flying refrigerator in 
1992, falls out of the sky deep-frozen! 
This wretched mortal is rescued by the 
god Horus, who wants to use his body to 
settle his scores with the other Egyptian 
deities. Thirty years have gone by. Paris 
has changed a lot. Alcide is totally lost. 
His memory gradually comes back and, 
with it, Baudelaire’s poems, which he 
recites all through the events that take 
place. The first one describes death at its 
most repellent. 
I don’t like death. I'm terrified of it 
and I'm always thinking about it in a 
somewhat abstract way. I’ve come to 
terms with it as best I can. We might as 
well laugh about it, don’t you think? 
The monstrous dictator's name is Choublanc, 
which means a loser in French. Is that because 
he is doomed to fail? Is there any symbolism 
in the names you give your characters? 
It’s very odd. Both names and titles 
come to me automatically. I don’t know 
how it happens or where they come from. 
But I do know that I'm incapable of wri- 
ting a book or making a film without kno- 
wing the title beforehand. It comes out of 
the blue. There’s nothing premeditated 
about it. When I started the story about 
Choublanc, I didn’t even know how it was 
going to develop. I already have the title of 
my next book, which is a follow-up to Le 
Sommeil du monstre. It’s 32 décembre— 
“December 32”. When I started writing 
32 décembre, 1 didn’t even known what the 
expression meant. Now, one of the book’s  
aims is to find a meaning for its title. 
Why did you name the head of the 
“Obscurantis Order” Warhole? Your female 
characters, painted in a dominant colour, owe 
something to Andy Warhol. 
There’s a pun in Warhole. There's a 
gaping hole over Nike’s head in the hospital 
at Sarajevo. But it’s also a deliberate allusion 
to Andy Warhol. Names can harbour a host of 
meanings. In the next book, you'll see that 
Warhole is also an artist. An artist of supreme 
evil. He has decided to turn evil into an art- 
form. His geopolitical strategy in the first 
book will be replaced by an artistic strategy. 
a 
TALKING TO... 
You often name your characters after real 
people. Nike's last name is Hatzfeld, a 
journalist with the French daily Libération who 
was seriously wounded in Sarajevo in 1992. In 
Froid Equateur, you allude to the Albanian- 
born choreographer Angelin Preljoca. 
To me, news is the raw material for 
any projection into the future. I soak up 
news, and my story, which is set in the 
future, is packed with events from the 
present. And if my readers don’t follow 
current political events, they are some- 
times likely to get lost. 
Anjelin is a rather special case. Froid »

### 119495: Enki Bilal: a journey to the end of time

Ll 
TALKING TO... 
Equateur came out in 1992. Two years 
later,I designed the sets and costumes for 
his Romeo and Juliet. It was an exceptional 
and exciting encounter on two counts. 
Wide-eyed, I discovered the world of 
dance, which until then had been pretty 
much a closed book to me. At the same 
time I came to know a gifted artist who 
has since become a friend. 
Doesn't the fact that both of you are from the 
Balkans explain Romeo and Juliet’s success? 
Ofcourse it does. We have a shared Bal- 
kan sensibility. I was immediately won over 
by the way Anjelin wanted to stage Romeo 
and Juliet—his radical approach, the social 
setting of adrama that takes on political and 
even ethnic overtones. It was a deeply ful- 
filling experience which gave me an oppor- 
tunity to serve not only the world’s most 
beautiful love story but also an artist who 
uses dancers’ bodies to externalize his ideas. 
For an illustrator,it’s fascinating to see how 
bodies express them selves. 
The heroine in your book The Woman Trap is 
called Jill Bioskop. Her last name means 
“cinema” in Serb. Froid Equateur begins and 
ends with scenes of a movie being made. Are 
you a film buff? 
Movies have stimulated my imagina- 
tion ever since I was a child. When I was 
a teenager, | was fascinated by an art form 
which I felt was both close to and parallel 
to what I dreamed of doing. Cinema held 
an extraordinary attraction, but at the 
same time it seemed inaccessible. So I 
started drawing, which for me was a way 
of making movies freely, alone at home. 
Later, you directed two fiction films, Bunker 
Palace Hotel and Tykho Moon. Does film- 
making involve more constraints than creating 
comic strips? 
The two activities are worlds apart. 
Cinema 1s nothing but constraints. When 
you create a comic book, you don’t have to 
think about production costs, shooting 
locations, equipment and actors. 
Everything depends on the author, who is 
extraordinarily free. But inherent in that 
freedom is the danger of going off the rails. 
Illustrators have to harness their freedom 
all the time, keep it under control. 
But the film industry is changing. New 
tools such as small digital cameras are 
enabling younger directors to make movies 
with low budgets and, above all, enjoy 
greater freedom than their predecessors. I 
think we're heading towards a bipolariza- 
tion in cinema. On the one hand spectacu- 
lar blockbusters, on the other a small-scale, 
almost underground cinema that is bound 
to be very interesting. 
How does the world of your comic strips 
relate to that of your films? 
It’s the same world, the same preoccu- 
pations, the same atmosphere. I’ve been 
criticized for making “comic strip” films. 
That’s completely ridiculous. What on 
earth is a “comic strip” film? This false 
perception may explain why my films 
haven’t really been successful in France. 
In Japan, on the other hand, they met 
with exceptional acclaim, just like my 
books. 
The comic strip had a chequered career before 
it achieved recognition as the ninth art. Are 
comic strip artists well thought of in the world 
of the arts? 
Personally, I am in a very fortunate 
position.I get a lot of media attention,too 
much sometimes. I have to be careful. But 
in some quarters I still feel there is a cer- 
tain contempt for graphic art in general. 
In some literary, publishing and even 
cinema circles, people still think words 
are on a higher plane than pictures. 
All the same, in 1992 the editors of the French 
literary magazine Lire chose Froid Equateur as 
their “book of the year”. 
The choice was very badly received 
both in the literary world and the comic 
strip world. The press didn’t talk about it. 
It was pretty funny. 
It’s odd, but the art world denigrates 
illustration and comic strips. A year ago, 
the French magazine Beaux-Arts published 
some stories about the comic strip festival 
held in the southwestern city of Angou- 
léme. T he lead article kicked off by war- 
ning readers that just because the editors 
were publishing a special section about 
comic strips it didn’t necessarily mean they 
considered them to be art. 
Not long before, Beaux-Arts had publi- 
shed a five-page piece about me. And now all 
of a sudden it was as if they regretted it. They 
didn’t want to turn off their old subscribers. 
But at the same time, they wanted to attract 
younger readers. This is a pretty dishonest 
approach. But I'm hopeful. I think the people 
who think this way are, fortunately, doomed 
either to disappear or to change. [
